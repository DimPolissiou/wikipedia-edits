Extra point kicks will be from the 15 yard line, and defenses can return blocked PAT's, fumbles or interceptions on two-point tries for a two-point defensive conversion.\n* Outlaw all chop blocks anywhere on the field. Previously, the chop block was legal when an offensive lineman chops a defensive player \"while the defensive player is physically engaged above the waist by the blocking attempt of another offensive teammate\".\n* Expand the definition of a \"[[horse-collar tackle]]\" to include tackles where a player is grabbed by the jersey at or above the name plate and dragged to the ground.\n* Making the act of calling time-out when not permitted to do so subject to a delay-of-game penalty (5 yards).\n* Changing from a five-yard penalty to a loss of down when a receiver goes out of bounds and comes back in to illegally touch a forward pass.\n* Eliminating multiple spots of enforcement for a double foul committed after a change of possession.\n* The umpire will now line up in the offensive backfield directly across from the referee at all times in the game, ending the practice of the umpire moving behind the defensive line when the offense is inside the five-yard line or in the final 2:00 of the first half & the final 5:00 of the second half.\n\nThe following changes were approved for only the 2016 NFL season at the owners' meeting on March 23.  Both are subject to become permanent rules or scrapped for the 2017.\n* Moving the [[touchback]] spot after kickoffs and other free kicks to the 25-yard line, similar to the NCAA rule adopted in the [[2012 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2012 season]] (a touchback after a turnover or punt will still be placed on the 20-yard line). The goal for this rule change is to decrease the number of kickoff returns: kick returners may be more reluctant to bring the ball out from the end zone because of the greater risk of being tackled before reaching the 25-yard line. NFL officials concede that this may in fact increase kickoff returns because kickers may instead attempt to pin returners inside the 10-yard line.<ref>{{cite web|last=Breech|first=John|title=NFL implements huge new touchback rule, admits it could backfire|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25528216/nfl-implements-huge-new-touchback-rule-admits-it-could-backfire|website=[[CBSSports.com]]|accessdate=March 23, 2016|date=March 23, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326124530/http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25528216/nfl-implements-huge-new-touchback-rule-admits-it-could-backfire|archivedate=March 26, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* Players committing two [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] penalties in the same game will be automatically ejected from the game.

The Rams previously played at the Coliseum during their first stint in Los Angeles from 1946 to 1979.\n\n====Rams bid for Los Angeles====\n{{main|SoFi Stadium}}\nThe Rams and the St. Louis CVC (Convention & Visitors Commission) began negotiating deals to get the Rams' home stadium, [[The Dome at America's Center]] (then known as Edward Jones Dome), into the top 25 percent of stadiums in the league (i.e., top eight teams of the thirty-two NFL teams in reference to luxury boxes, amenities and overall fan experience). Under the terms of the lease agreement, the St. Louis CVC was required to make modifications to the Edward Jones Dome in 2005. However, then-owner, [[Georgia Frontiere]], waived the provision in exchange for cash that served as a penalty for the city's noncompliance. The City of St. Louis, in subsequent years, made changes to the score board and increased the natural lighting by replacing panels with windows, although the overall feel remains dark. The minor renovations which totaled about $70&nbsp;million did not bring the stadium within the specifications required under the lease agreement.\n\nOn February 1, 2013, a three-person [[arbitral tribunal]] selected to preside over the arbitration process found that the Edward Jones Dome was not in the top 25% of all NFL venues as required under the terms of the lease agreement between the Rams and the CVC. The tribunal further found that the estimated $700&nbsp;million in proposed renovations by the Rams was not unreasonable given the terms of the lease agreement. Finally, the city of St. Louis was ordered to pay the Rams attorneys' fees which totaled a reported $2&nbsp;million.\n\nPublicly, city, county and state officials expressed no interest in providing further funding to the Edward Jones Dome in light of those entities, as well as taxpayers, continuing to owe approximately $300&nbsp;million more on that facility. As such, if a resolution could not reached by the end of the 2014\u20132015 NFL season and the City of St. Louis remains non-compliant in its obligations under the lease agreement, the Rams would be free to nullify their lease and relocate.\n\nOn January 31, 2014, both the ''Los Angeles Times'' and the ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' reported that Rams owner [[Stan Kroenke]] purchased 60 acres of land adjacent to the [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|Forum]] in [[Inglewood, California]]. It would be, by the most conservative estimates, sufficient land on which an NFL-sized stadium may be constructed. The purchase price was rumored to have been between US$90\u2013100&nbsp;million. Commissioner Roger Goodell represented that Kroenke informed the league of the purchase. As an NFL owner, any purchase of land in which a potential stadium could be built must be disclosed to the league. This development further fueled rumors that the Rams intended to return its management and football operations to Southern California. The land was initially targeted for a Walmart Supercenter but [[Walmart]] could not get the necessary permits to build the center. Kroenke is married to [[Ann Walton Kroenke]] who is a member of the [[Walton family]] and many of Kroenke's real estate deals have involved Walmart properties.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wagoner|first=Nick|title=Stan Kroenke buys 60 acres in L.A.|url=http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nfl/story/_/id/10380150/st-louis-rams-owner-stan-kroenke-buys-60-acres-land-los-angeles|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=September 4, 2014|date=February 1, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921005816/http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nfl/story/_/id/10380150/st-louis-rams-owner-stan-kroenke-buys-60-acres-land-los-angeles|archivedate=September 21, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ksdk.com/story/sports/nfl/rams/2014/01/30/stan-kroenke-plot-of-land-california-st-louis-rams/5069985/ |title=Report: Rams owner bought 60 acres of land in California |last=Piper |first=Brandie |publisher=Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc. |date=January 31, 2014 |website=ksdk.com |accessdate=September 4, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140221154310/http://www.ksdk.com/story/sports/nfl/rams/2014/01/30/stan-kroenke-plot-of-land-california-st-louis-rams/5069985/ |archivedate=February 21, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Farmer|first1=Sam|last2=Vincent|first2=Roger|title=Owner of St. Louis Rams plans to build NFL stadium in Inglewood|url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/nfl/la-sp-0105-nfl-la-stadium-20150105-story.html#page=1|accessdate=May 19, 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 5, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528184109/http://www.latimes.com/sports/nfl/la-sp-0105-nfl-la-stadium-20150105-story.html#page=1|archivedate=May 28, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On January 5, 2015, The Los Angeles Times reported that [[Kroenke Sports & Entertainment]] and [[Stockbridge Capital Group]] were partnering up into developing a new NFL stadium on property owned by Kroenke.

Extra point kicks will be from the 15 yard line, and defenses can return blocked PAT's, fumbles or interceptions on two-point tries for a two-point defensive conversion.\n* Outlaw all chop blocks anywhere on the field. Previously, the chop block was legal when an offensive lineman chops a defensive player \"while the defensive player is physically engaged above the waist by the blocking attempt of another offensive teammate\".\n* Expand the definition of a \"[[horse-collar tackle]]\" to include tackles where a player is grabbed by the jersey at or above the name plate and dragged to the ground.\n* Making the act of calling time-out when not permitted to do so subject to a delay-of-game penalty (5 yards).\n* Changing from a five-yard penalty to a loss of down when a receiver goes out of bounds and comes back in to illegally touch a forward pass.\n* Eliminating multiple spots of enforcement for a double foul committed after a change of possession.\n* The umpire will now line up in the offensive backfield directly across from the referee at all times in the game, ending the practice of the umpire moving behind the defensive line when the offense is inside the five-yard line or in the final 2:00 of the first half & the final 5:00 of the second half.\n\nThe following changes were approved for only the 2016 NFL season at the owners' meeting on March 23.  Both are subject to become permanent rules or scrapped for the 2017.\n* Moving the [[touchback]] spot after kickoffs and other free kicks to the 25-yard line, similar to the NCAA rule adopted in the [[2012 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2012 season]] (a touchback after a turnover or punt will still be placed on the 20-yard line). The goal for this rule change is to decrease the number of kickoff returns: kick returners may be more reluctant to bring the ball out from the end zone because of the greater risk of being tackled before reaching the 25-yard line.

The Rams previously played at the Coliseum during their first stint in Los Angeles from 1946 to 1979.\n\n====Rams bid for Los Angeles====\n{{main|SoFi Stadium}}\nThe Rams and the St. Louis CVC (Convention & Visitors Commission) began negotiating deals to get the Rams' home stadium, [[The Dome at America's Center]] (then known as Edward Jones Dome), into the top 25 percent of stadiums in the league (i.e., top eight teams of the thirty-two NFL teams in reference to luxury boxes, amenities and overall fan experience). Under the terms of the lease agreement, the St. Louis CVC was required to make modifications to the Edward Jones Dome in 2005. However, then-owner, [[Georgia Frontiere]], waived the provision in exchange for cash that served as a penalty for the city's noncompliance. The City of St. Louis, in subsequent years, made changes to the score board and increased the natural lighting by replacing panels with windows, although the overall feel remains dark. The minor renovations which totaled about $70&nbsp;million did not bring the stadium within the specifications required under the lease agreement.\n\nOn February 1, 2013, a three-person [[arbitral tribunal]] selected to preside over the arbitration process found that the Edward Jones Dome was not in the top 25% of all NFL venues as required under the terms of the lease agreement between the Rams and the CVC. The tribunal further found that the estimated $700&nbsp;million in proposed renovations by the Rams was not unreasonable given the terms of the lease agreement. Finally, the city of St. Louis was ordered to pay the Rams attorneys' fees which totaled a reported $2&nbsp;million.\n\nPublicly, city, county and state officials expressed no interest in providing further funding to the Edward Jones Dome in light of those entities, as well as taxpayers, continuing to owe approximately $300&nbsp;million more on that facility. As such, if a resolution could not reached by the end of the 2014\u20132015 NFL season and the City of St. Louis remains non-compliant in its obligations under the lease agreement, the Rams would be free to nullify their lease and relocate.\n\nOn January 31, 2014, both the ''Los Angeles Times'' and the ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' reported that Rams owner [[Stan Kroenke]] purchased 60 acres of land adjacent to the [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|Forum]] in [[Inglewood, California]]. It would be, by the most conservative estimates, sufficient land on which an NFL-sized stadium may be constructed. The purchase price was rumored to have been between US$90\u2013100&nbsp;million. Commissioner Roger Goodell represented that Kroenke informed the league of the purchase. As an NFL owner, any purchase of land in which a potential stadium could be built must be disclosed to the league. This development further fueled rumors that the Rams intended to return its management and football operations to Southern California. The land was initially targeted for a Walmart Supercenter but [[Walmart]] could not get the necessary permits to build the center. Kroenke is married to [[Ann Walton Kroenke]] who is a member of the [[Walton family]] and many of Kroenke's real estate deals have involved Walmart properties.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wagoner|first=Nick|title=Stan Kroenke buys 60 acres in L.A.|url=http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nfl/story/_/id/10380150/st-louis-rams-owner-stan-kroenke-buys-60-acres-land-los-angeles|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=September 4, 2014|date=February 1, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921005816/http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nfl/story/_/id/10380150/st-louis-rams-owner-stan-kroenke-buys-60-acres-land-los-angeles|archivedate=September 21, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ksdk.com/story/sports/nfl/rams/2014/01/30/stan-kroenke-plot-of-land-california-st-louis-rams/5069985/ |title=Report: Rams owner bought 60 acres of land in California |last=Piper |first=Brandie |publisher=Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc. |date=January 31, 2014 |website=ksdk.com |accessdate=September 4, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140221154310/http://www.ksdk.com/story/sports/nfl/rams/2014/01/30/stan-kroenke-plot-of-land-california-st-louis-rams/5069985/ |archivedate=February 21, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Farmer|first1=Sam|last2=Vincent|first2=Roger|title=Owner of St. Louis Rams plans to build NFL stadium in Inglewood|url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/nfl/la-sp-0105-nfl-la-stadium-20150105-story.html#page=1|accessdate=May 19, 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 5, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528184109/http://www.latimes.com/sports/nfl/la-sp-0105-nfl-la-stadium-20150105-story.html#page=1|archivedate=May 28, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On January 5, 2015, The Los Angeles Times reported that [[Kroenke Sports & Entertainment]] and [[Stockbridge Capital Group]] were partnering up into developing a new NFL stadium on property owned by Kroenke.

In lieu of this the city of St. Louis responded on January 9, 2015, by unveiling an [[National Car Rental Field|outdoor, open air, riverfront stadium]] that could have accommodated the Rams and an [[MLS]] team with the hope that the NFL bylaws can force them to stay.

It took place simultaneously with the naval [[Battle of Artemisium|battle at Artemisium]], in August or September 480 BC, at the narrow coastal pass of [[Thermopylae]] (\"The Hot Gates\"). The Persian invasion was a delayed response to the defeat of the [[first Persian invasion of Greece]], which had been ended by the [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490 BC. By 480 BC Xerxes had amassed a massive army and navy, and set out to conquer all of Greece. The Athenian politician and general [[Themistocles]] had proposed that the allied Greeks block the advance of the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae, and simultaneously block the Persian navy at the Straits of [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]].\n\nA Greek force of approximately 7,000 men marched north to block the pass in the middle of 480 BC. The Persian army, alleged by the ancient sources to have numbered over one million, but today considered to have been much smaller (various figures are given by scholars, ranging between about 100,000 and 150,000)<ref>{{cite book|last=Sacks|first=Kenneth|title=Understanding Emerson: \"The American scholar\" and his struggle for self-reliance |year=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-09982-8|url=https://archive.org/details/understandingeme0000sack |url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/understandingeme0000sack/page/157 157]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cassin-Scott|first=Jack|title=The Greek and Persian Wars 500-323 B.C. |year=1977|publisher=Osprey|isbn=978-0-85045-271-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geWUfjew_PEC&pg=PA11|page=11}}</ref> arrived at the pass in late August or early September. The vastly outnumbered Greeks held off the Persians for seven days (including three of battle) before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous [[last stand]]s. During two full days of battle, the small force led by Leonidas blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could pass. After the second day, a local resident named [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]] betrayed the Greeks by revealing a small path used by shepherds. It led the Persians behind the Greek lines. Leonidas, aware that his force was being outflanked, dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat with 300 [[Spartan hoplite|Spartans]] and 700 [[Thespiae|Thespians]], fighting to the death. Others also reportedly remained, including up to 900 [[helots]] and 400 [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]]; most of these Thebans reportedly surrendered.\n\nThemistocles was in command of the Greek Navy at Artemisium when he received news that the Persians had taken the pass at Thermopylae. Since the Greek strategy required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, given their losses, it was decided to withdraw to [[Salamis Island|Salamis]]. The Persians overran [[Boeotia]] and then captured the evacuated Athens. The Greek fleet\u2014seeking a decisive victory over the Persian armada\u2014attacked and defeated the invaders at the [[Battle of Salamis]] in late 480 BC. Wary of being trapped in Europe, Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia (losing most to starvation and disease), leaving [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] to attempt to complete the conquest of Greece. However, the following year saw a Greek army decisively defeat the Persians at the [[Battle of Plataea]], thereby ending the Persian invasion.\n\nBoth ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae as an example of the power of a patriotic army defending its native soil. The performance of the defenders is also used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as [[force multiplier]]s and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds.\n\n==Sources==\n{{Main|Herodotus}}\nThe primary source for the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]]. The Sicilian historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], writing in the 1st century BC in his ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'', also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian [[Ephorus]]. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus'.<ref>Diodorus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Diod.+11.28 XI, 28\u201334],</ref> The Greco-Persian Wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], and are referred to by other authors, as in [[Aeschylus]] in ''[[The Persians]]''.\n\nArchaeological evidence, such as the [[Serpent Column]] (now in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]]), also supports some of Herodotus' specific claims.<ref>Note to Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.81 IX, 81]</ref> George B.

In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece requesting \"earth and water\" but very deliberately omitting Athens and Sparta.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.32.1 VII, 32]</ref> Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city-states met at [[Corinth]] in late autumn of 481 BC,<ref name=VII145>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.145.1 VII, 145]</ref> and a confederate alliance of [[History of Greece|Greek city-states]] was formed. It had the power to send envoys to request assistance and dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points, after joint consultation. This was remarkable for the disjointed and chaotic Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.<ref name = h226>Holland, p. 226</ref>\n\nThe \"congress\" met again in the spring of 480 BC. A [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] delegation suggested that the Greeks could muster in the narrow [[Vale of Tempe]], on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes' advance.<ref name = h248>Holland, pp. 248\u2013249</ref> A force of 10,000 [[hoplite]]s was dispatched to the Vale of Tempe, through which they believed the Persian army would have to pass.

Herodotus claimed that there were, in total, 2.6 million military personnel, accompanied by an equivalent number of support personnel.<ref name=VII186>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.186 VII, 186]</ref> The poet [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]], who was a near-contemporary, talks of four million; [[Ctesias]] gave 800,000 as the total number of the army that was assembled by Xerxes.<ref name = ctes>{{cite web|url=https://www.livius.org/ct-cz/ctesias/photius_persica2.html|title=Photius' excerpt of Ctesias' Persica|publisher=Livius.org|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nModern scholars tend to reject the figures given by Herodotus and other ancient sources as unrealistic, resulting from miscalculations or exaggerations on the part of the victors.<ref name = h237>Holland, p. 237</ref> Modern scholarly estimates are generally in the range 120,000\u2013300,000.<ref name=\"Holland, p. 394\">Holland, p. 394.</ref>{{cref|b}} These estimates usually come from studying the logistical capabilities of the Persians in that era, the sustainability of their respective bases of operations, and the overall manpower constraints affecting them. Whatever the real numbers were, however, it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering an overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea.<ref name=souza>de Souza, p. 41.</ref>\nThe number of Persian troops present at Thermopylae is therefore as uncertain as the number for the total invasion force.

Herodotus agrees with this figure in one passage, quoting an inscription by [[Simonides]] saying there were 4,000 Peloponnesians.<ref name = VII228>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.228.1 VII, 228]</ref> However, elsewhere, in the passage summarized by the above table, Herodotus tallies 3,100 Peloponnesians at Thermopylae before the battle.<ref name = VII202/> Herodotus also reports that at Xerxes' public showing of the dead, \"helots were also there for them to see\",<ref name = VIII25>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.25.1 VIII, 25]</ref> but he does not say how many or in what capacity they served. Thus, the difference between his two figures can be squared by supposing (without proof) that there were 900 helots (three per Spartan) present at the battle.<ref name = \"Macan\">Macan, note to Herodotus VIII, 25</ref> If helots were present at the battle, there is no reason to doubt that they served in their traditional role as armed retainers to individual Spartans. Alternatively, Herodotus' \"missing\" 900 troops might have been [[Perioeci]], and could therefore correspond to Diodorus' 1,000 Lacedemonians.<ref name = \"Macan\"/>\n*The number of Lacedemonians\n:Further confusing the issue is Diodorus' ambiguity about whether his count of 1,000 Lacedemonians included the 300 Spartans. At one point he says: \"Leonidas, when he received the appointment, announced that only one thousand men should follow him on the campaign\".<ref name=dsXI4/> However, he then says: \"There were, then, of the Lacedemonians one thousand, and with them three hundred Spartiates\".<ref name=dsXI4/> It is therefore impossible to be clearer on this point.\n\n[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]' account agrees with that of Herodotus (whom he probably read) except that he gives the number of Locrians, which Herodotus declined to estimate. Residing in the direct path of the Persian advance, they gave all the fighting men they had - according to Pausanias 6,000 men - which added to Herodotus' 5,200 would have given a force of 11,200.<ref>Pausanias [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+10.20.1 X, 20]</ref>\n\nMany modern historians, who usually consider Herodotus more reliable,<ref name=Green>Green, p. 140</ref> add the 1,000 Lacedemonians and the 900 helots to Herodotus' 5,200 to obtain 7,100 or about 7,000 men as a standard number, neglecting Diodorus' Melians and Pausanias' Locrians.<ref>Bradford, p. 106</ref><ref name = russel>Bury, pp. 271\u2013282</ref> However, this is only one approach, and many other combinations are plausible. Furthermore, the numbers changed later on in the battle when most of the army retreated and only approximately 3,000 men remained (300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebans, possibly up to 900 helots, and 1,000 Phocians stationed above the pass, less the casualties sustained in the previous days).<ref name=Green/>\n\n==Strategic and tactical considerations==\n[[File:Nicolo arena battleofthermopylae.svg|thumb|250px|A flow map of the battle]]\nFrom a strategic point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks were making the best possible use of their forces.<ref name = L248/> As long as they could prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they had no need to seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor.<ref name = L248/> Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in the same place for very long.<ref name = h285>Holland, pp. 285\u2013287</ref> The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.<ref name = h285/>\n\nTactically, the pass at Thermopylae was ideally suited to the Greek style of warfare.<ref name = L248/> A [[hoplite]] [[phalanx formation|phalanx]] could block the narrow pass with ease, with no risk of being outflanked by cavalry. Moreover, in the pass, the phalanx would have been very difficult to assault for the more lightly armed Persian infantry.<ref name = L248/> The major weak point for the Greeks was the mountain track which led across the highland parallel to Thermopylae, that could allow their position to be outflanked. Although probably unsuitable for cavalry, this path could easily be traversed by the Persian infantry (many of whom were versed in [[mountain warfare]]).<ref name = h288>Holland, p 288</ref> Leonidas was made aware of this path by local people from [[Trachis]], and he positioned a detachment of Phocian troops there in order to block this route.<ref name = h262>Holland, pp. 262\u2013264</ref>\n\n===Topography of the battlefield===\n[[File:Thermopylae map 480bc.png|thumb|250px|Map of Thermopylae area with modern shoreline and reconstructed shoreline of 480 BC.]]\n\nIt is often claimed that at the time, the pass of Thermopylae consisted of a track along the shore of the Malian Gulf so narrow that only one chariot could pass through at a time.<ref name=\"VII176\" /> In fact, as noted below, the pass was 100 metres wide, probably wider than the Greeks could have held against the Persian masses. Herodotus reports that the Phocians had improved the defences of the pass by channelling the stream from the hot springs to create a marsh, and it was a causeway across this marsh which was only wide enough for a single chariot to traverse. In a later passage, describing a Gaulish attempt to force the pass, Pausinias states \"The cavalry on both sides proved useless, as the ground at the Pass is not only narrow, but also smooth because of the natural rock, while most of it is slippery owing to its being covered with streams...the losses of the barbarians it was impossible to discover exactly. For the number of them that disappeared beneath the mud was great.\"<ref>http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D10%3Achapter%3D21</ref>\n\nIt is also said that on the southern side of the track stood cliffs that overlooked the pass. However, a glance at any photograph of the pass shows there are no cliffs, only steep slopes covered in thorny bushes and trees. Although no obstacle to individuals, such terrain would not be passable by an army and its baggage train.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nOn the north side of the roadway was the [[Malian Gulf]], into which the land shelved gently. When at a later date, an army of Gauls led by [[Brennus (3rd century BC)|Brennus]] attempted to force the pass, the shallowness of the water gave the Greek fleet great difficulty getting close enough to the fighting to bombard the Gauls with ship-borne missile weapons.\n\nAlong the path itself was a series of three constrictions, or \"gates\" (''pylai''), and at the centre gate a wall that had been erected by the Phocians, in the previous century, to aid in their defence against [[Thessalian]] invasions.<ref name=\"VII176\">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.176.1 VII, 176]</ref> The name \"Hot Gates\" comes from the [[hot spring]]s that were located there.<ref name=\"VIII201\">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.201.1 VIII, 201]</ref>\n\nThe terrain of the battlefield was nothing that [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] and his forces were accustomed to. Although coming from a mountainous country, the Persians were not prepared for the real nature of the country they had invaded. The pure ruggedness of this area is caused by torrential downpours for four months of the year, combined with an intense summer season of scorching heat that cracks the ground. Vegetation is scarce and consists of low, thorny shrubs. The hillsides along the pass are covered in thick brush, with some plants reaching {{convert|10|ft|m}} high. With the sea on one side and steep, impassable hills on the other, King Leonidas and his men chose the perfect topographical position to battle the Persian invaders.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Battle For The West: Thermopylae |last=Bradford |first=Ernle |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |year=1980 |isbn=0-07-007062-8 |location=New York |pages=68\u201369}}</ref>\n\nToday, the pass is not near the sea, but is several kilometres inland because of [[Sedimentation#Geology|sedimentation]] in the Malian Gulf.

Herodotus suggests they were brought to the battle as hostages to ensure the good behavior of Thebes.<ref name = VII205/> However, as Plutarch long ago pointed out, if they were hostages, why not send them away with the rest of the Greeks?<ref name = L144/> The likelihood is that these were the Theban \"loyalists\", who unlike the majority of their fellow citizens, objected to Persian domination.<ref name = L144/> They thus probably came to Thermopylae of their own free will and stayed to the end because they could not return to Thebes if the Persians conquered Boeotia.<ref name = h291/> The Thespians, resolved as they were not to submit to Xerxes, faced the destruction of their city if the Persians took Boeotia.<ref name = L144/>\n\nHowever, this alone does not explain the fact that they remained; the remainder of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there.<ref name = L144/> It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster.<ref>Lazenby, pp. 259\u2013260</ref> This seems to have been a particularly Thespian trait \u2013 on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to a fight to the death.<ref name = L144/>\n\n[[File:Battle of Thermopylae Spartans and Persians.jpg|thumb|left|Spartans surrounded by Persians, Battle of Thermopylae. 19th century illustration.]]\nAt dawn, Xerxes made [[libation]]s, pausing to allow the Immortals sufficient time to descend the mountain, and then began his advance.<ref name=VII223>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.223.1 VII, 223]</ref> A Persian force of 10,000 men, comprising light infantry and cavalry, charged at the front of the Greek formation.

In Western culture at least, it is the Greeks who are lauded for their performance in battle.<ref name = hxviii>Holland, p. ''xviii''.</ref> However, within the context of the Persian invasion, Thermopylae was undoubtedly a defeat for the Greeks.<ref name=\"Lazenby, p. 151\">Lazenby, p. 151.</ref> It seems clear that the Greek strategy was to hold off the Persians at Thermopylae and Artemisium;<ref name = L248/> whatever they may have intended, it was presumably not their desire to surrender all of Boeotia and Attica to the Persians.<ref name = L248/> The Greek position at Thermopylae, despite being massively outnumbered, was nearly impregnable.<ref name = h294/> If the position had been held for even a little longer, the Persians might have had to retreat for lack of food and water.<ref name = h285/> Thus, despite the heavy losses, forcing the pass was strategically a Persian victory,<ref name = h294/> but the successful retreat of the bulk of the Greek troops was in its own sense a victory as well. The battle itself had shown that even when heavily outnumbered, the Greeks could put up an effective fight against the Persians, and the defeat at Thermopylae had turned Leonidas and the men under his command into martyrs. That boosted the morale of all Greek soldiers in the second Persian invasion.<ref name = h294/>\n\nIt is sometimes stated that Thermopylae was a [[Pyrrhic victory]] for the Persians<ref name=\"Tung & Tung, p. 239\">Tung & Tung, p. 239.</ref><ref name=\"Marozzi, p. 74\">Marozzi, p. 74.</ref> (i.e., one in which the victor is as damaged by the battle as the defeated party). However, there is no suggestion by Herodotus that the effect on the Persian forces was that. The idea ignores the fact that the Persians would, in the aftermath of Thermopylae, conquer the majority of Greece,<ref name = Cawk105>Cawkwell, pp. 105\u2013106</ref> and the fact that they were still fighting in Greece a year later.<ref name = IX1>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.1.1 IX, 1]</ref> Alternatively, the argument is sometimes advanced that the last stand at Thermopylae was a successful delaying action that gave the Greek navy time to prepare for the Battle of Salamis.{{cref|c}} However, compared to the probable time (about one month) between Thermopylae and Salamis, the time bought was negligible.<ref name = hnet>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/greco-persian-wars-battle-of-thermopylae.htm/6 |title=Greco-Persian Wars: Battle of Thermopylae |publisher=HistoryNet |accessdate=27 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090228234109/http://www.historynet.com/greco-persian-wars-battle-of-thermopylae.htm/6| archivedate= 28 February 2009 | url-status=live}}</ref> Furthermore, this idea also neglects the fact that a Greek navy was fighting at Artemisium during the Battle of Thermopylae, incurring losses in the process.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.1.1 VIII, 1\u201319]</ref> [[George Cawkwell]] suggests that the gap between Thermopylae and Salamis was caused by Xerxes' systematically reducing Greek opposition in Phocis and Boeotia, and not as a result of the Battle of Thermopylae; thus, as a delaying action, Thermopylae was insignificant compared to Xerxes' own procrastination.<ref name = Cawk105/> Far from labelling Thermopylae as a Pyrrhic victory, modern academic treatises on the Greco-Persian Wars tend to emphasise the success of Xerxes in breaching the formidable Greek position and the subsequent conquest of the majority of Greece. For instance, Cawkwell states: \"he was successful on both land and sea, and the Great Invasion began with a brilliant success.\n... Xerxes had every reason to congratulate himself\",<ref>Cawkwell, p. 104.</ref> while Lazenby describes the Greek defeat as \"disastrous\".<ref name=\"Lazenby, p. 151\"/>\n\nThe fame of Thermopylae is thus principally derived not from its effect on the outcome of the war but for the inspirational example it set.<ref name = hnet/><ref>Lazenby, p. 150</ref> Thermopylae is famous because of the heroism of the doomed rearguard, who, despite facing certain death, remained at the pass.<ref name=\"hxviii\"/> Ever since, the events of Thermopylae have been the source of effusive praise from many sources: \"Salamis, Plataea, Mycale and Sicily are the fairest sister-victories which the Sun has ever seen, yet they would never dare to compare their combined glory with the glorious defeat of King Leonidas and his men\".<ref>Michel de Montaigne, quoted in Holland, p. ''xviii''.</ref> A second reason is the example it set of free men, fighting for their country and their freedom:\n\n<blockquote>So almost immediately, contemporary Greeks saw Thermopylae as a critical moral and culture lesson. In universal terms, a small, free people had willingly outfought huge numbers of imperial subjects who advanced under the lash. More specifically, the Western idea that soldiers themselves decide where, how, and against whom they will fight was contrasted against the Eastern notion of despotism and monarchy\u2014freedom proving the stronger idea as the more courageous fighting of the Greeks at Thermopylae, and their later victories at Salamis and Plataea attested.<ref name=\"hanson\">{{cite web|url=http://www.victorhanson.com/articles/hanson101106.html |title=Victor Hanson article |publisher=Victor Hanson article |date=11 October 2006 |accessdate=27 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319045718/http://www.victorhanson.com/articles/hanson101106.html |archivedate=19 March 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref></blockquote> While this paradigm of \"free men\" outfighting \"slaves\" can be seen as a rather sweeping over-generalization (there are many counter-examples), it is nevertheless true that many commentators have used Thermopylae to illustrate this point.<ref name = L248>Lazenby, pp. 248\u2013253</ref>\n\nMilitarily, although the battle was actually not decisive in the context of the Persian invasion, Thermopylae is of some significance on the basis of the first two days of fighting.

Some English renderings are given in the table below. It is also an example of [[Laconic phrase|Laconian brevity]], which allows for varying interpretations of the meaning of the poem.<ref name=\"Ziogas\"/> Ioannis Ziogas points out that the usual English translations are far from the only interpretation possible, and indicate much about the romantic tendencies of the translators.\n\nIt was well known in ancient Greece that all the Spartans who had been sent to Thermopylae had been killed there (with the exception of [[Aristodemus of Sparta|Aristodemus]] and [[Pantites]]), and the epitaph exploits the conceit that there was nobody left to bring the news of their deeds back to Sparta. Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (always called 'stranger') for sympathy, but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention much further than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to break the news that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out. The stranger is also asked to stress that the Spartans died 'fulfilling their orders'.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!'''Translation'''\n!'''Notes'''\n|+\n|-\n|Go tell the Spartans, thou who passest by,<br />That here, obedient to their laws, we lie.<ref>Strachey, p. 481</ref>\n|[[William Lisle Bowles]]\n|-\n|Stranger, tell the Spartans that we behaved <br />as they would wish us to, and are buried here.<ref>Golding, exceprt from The Hot Gates.</ref>\n|[[William Golding]]\n|-\n|Stranger!

A variant of the epigram is inscribed on the [[Polish Cemetery at Monte Cassino]].\n\n[[John Ruskin]] expressed the importance of this ideal to [[western culture|Western civilization]] as follows:<blockquote>Also obedience in its highest form is not obedience to a constant and compulsory law, but a persuaded or voluntary yielded obedience to an issued command ....

[the epitaph in Greek]<ref name=rusk>Ruskin, p. 212</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Cicero]] recorded a [[Latin]] variation in his ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes]]'' (1.42.101):\n\n:''Dic, hospes, Spartae nos te hic vidisse iacentes''\n:''dum sanctis patriae legibus obsequimur.''\n\n:Tell, stranger, to Sparta that you saw us lying here\n:since we followed the sacred laws of the fatherland.<ref name=\"Ziogas\" />\n\n====Leonidas monument====\n[[File:\u0398\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c0\u03cd\u03bb\u03b5\u03c2 - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|Monument in honour of Leonidas - Vassos Falireas, 1955]]\nAdditionally, there is a modern monument at the site, called the \"Leonidas Monument\" by {{interlanguage link|Vassos Falireas|el|\u0392\u03ac\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a6\u03b1\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2}}, in honour of the Spartan king.

The monument is made of marble and features a bronze statue depicting the god [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]], to whom the ancient Thespians accorded particular [[Religion in ancient Greece|religious veneration]]. Under the statue, a sign reads: \"In memory of the seven hundred Thespians.\"\n\nA plate below the statue explains its symbolism:\n* The headless male figure symbolizes the anonymous sacrifice of the 700 Thespians to their country.\n* The outstretched chest symbolizes the struggle, the gallantry, the strength, the bravery and the courage.\n* The open wing symbolizes the victory, the glory, the soul, the spirit and the freedom.\n* The broken wing symbolizes the voluntary sacrifice and death.\n* The naked body symbolizes Eros, the most important god of the ancient Thespians, a god of creation, beauty and life.\n\nThe monument to the Thespians is placed beside the one to the Spartans.\n\n===Associated legends===\n[[File:The Battle of Thermopylae engraving.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''The Battle of Thermopylae'', 19th century engraving]]\nHerodotus' colorful account of the battle has provided history with many apocryphal incidents and conversations away from the main historical events. These accounts are obviously not verifiable, but they form an integral part of the legend of the battle and often demonstrate the [[laconic]] speech (and wit) of the Spartans to good effect.\n\nFor instance, [[Plutarch]] recounts, in his ''Sayings of Spartan Women'', upon his departure, Leonidas' wife [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Gorgo]] asked what she should do if he did not return, to which Leonidas replied, \"Marry a good man and have good children.\"<ref>Plutarch, Apophthegmata Laconica [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0197%3Achapter%3D51%3Asection%3D2 Plut. Apoph. 51.2] and Moralia, 240 E (6)</ref>\n\nIt is reported that, upon arriving at Thermopylae, the Persians sent a mounted scout to reconnoitre. The Greeks allowed him to come up to the camp, observe them, and depart. Xerxes found the scout's reports of the size of the Greek force, and that the Spartans were indulging in [[calisthenics|callisthenics]] and combing their long hair, laughable. Seeking the counsel of [[Demaratus]], an exiled Spartan king in his retinue, Xerxes was told the Spartans were preparing for battle, and it was their custom to adorn their hair when they were about to risk their lives. Demaratus called them \"the bravest men in Greece\" and warned the Great King they intended to dispute the pass. He emphasized that he had tried to warn Xerxes earlier in the campaign, but the king had refused to believe him. He added that if Xerxes ever managed to subdue the Spartans, \"there is no other nation in all the world which will venture to lift a hand in their defence.\"<ref name=VII209>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.209.1 VII, 209]</ref>\n\nHerodotus also describes Leonidas' reception of a Persian embassy. The ambassador told Leonidas that Xerxes would offer him the kingship of all Greece if he joined with Xerxes. Leonidas answered: \"If you had any knowledge of the noble things of life, you would refrain from coveting others' possessions; but for me to die for Greece is better than to be the sole ruler over the people of my race.\"<ref>Plutarch, Moralia, 225, saying 10</ref> Then the ambassador asked him more forcefully to surrender their arms. To this Leonidas gave his famous answer: {{lang|grc|[[Molon labe|\u039c\u03bf\u03bb\u1f7c\u03bd \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03ad]]}} (pronounced {{IPA-el|mo\u02c8l\u0254\u02d0n la\u02c8be}}) \"Come and get them.\"<ref>Plutarch, Apophthegmata Laconica, Saying 11.</ref>\n\nSuch laconic bravery doubtlessly helped to maintain morale. Herodotus writes that when [[Dienekes]], a Spartan soldier, was informed that Persian arrows would be so numerous as \"to block out the sun\", he retorted, \"So much the better...then we shall fight our battle in the shade.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.226.1|title=Herodotus,  The Histories, Book 7, chapter 226, section 1|publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter the battle, Xerxes was curious as to what the Greeks had been trying to do (presumably because they had had so few men) and had some Arcadian deserters interrogated in his presence. The answer was: all the other men were participating in the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. When Xerxes asked what the prize was for the winner, the answer was: \"an olive-wreath\". Upon hearing this, [[Tigranes]], a Persian general, said: \"Good heavens, [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], what kind of men are these that you have pitted against us? It is not for riches that they contend but for honour!\" (Godley translation) or otherwise, \"Ye Gods, Mardonius, what men have you brought us to fight against?

The battle is revisited in countless [[adage]]s and works of popular culture, such as in films (e.g., ''[[The 300 Spartans]]'' (1962) and ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' (2007), based on the events during and close to the time of the battle), in literature, in song, in television programs, and in video games.

It took place simultaneously with the naval [[Battle of Artemisium|battle at Artemisium]], in August or September 480 BC, at the narrow coastal pass of [[Thermopylae]] (\"The Hot Gates\"). The Persian invasion was a delayed response to the defeat of the [[first Persian invasion of Greece]], which had been ended by the [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490 BC. By 480 BC Xerxes had amassed a massive army and navy, and set out to conquer all of Greece. The Athenian politician and general [[Themistocles]] had proposed that the allied Greeks block the advance of the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae, and simultaneously block the Persian navy at the Straits of [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]].\n\nA Greek force of approximately 7,000 men marched north to block the pass in the middle of 480 BC. The Persian army, alleged by the ancient sources to have numbered over one million, but today considered to have been much smaller (various figures are given by scholars, ranging between about 100,000 and 150,000)<ref>{{cite book|last=Sacks|first=Kenneth|title=Understanding Emerson: \"The American scholar\" and his struggle for self-reliance |year=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-09982-8|url=https://archive.org/details/understandingeme0000sack |url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/understandingeme0000sack/page/157 157]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cassin-Scott|first=Jack|title=The Greek and Persian Wars 500-323 B.C. |year=1977|publisher=Osprey|isbn=978-0-85045-271-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geWUfjew_PEC&pg=PA11|page=11}}</ref> arrived at the pass in late August or early September. The vastly outnumbered Greeks held off the Persians for seven days (including three of battle) before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous [[last stand]]s. During two full days of battle, the small force led by Leonidas blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could pass. After the second day, a local resident named [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]] betrayed the Greeks by revealing a small path used by shepherds. It led the Persians behind the Greek lines. Leonidas, aware that his force was being outflanked, dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat with 300 [[Spartan hoplite|Spartans]] and 700 [[Thespiae|Thespians]], fighting to the death. Others also reportedly remained, including up to 900 [[helots]] and 400 [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]]; most of these Thebans reportedly surrendered.\n\nThemistocles was in command of the Greek Navy at Artemisium when he received news that the Persians had taken the pass at Thermopylae. Since the Greek strategy required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, given their losses, it was decided to withdraw to [[Salamis Island|Salamis]]. The Persians overran [[Boeotia]] and then captured the evacuated Athens. The Greek fleet\u2014seeking a decisive victory over the Persian armada\u2014attacked and defeated the invaders at the [[Battle of Salamis]] in late 480 BC. Wary of being trapped in Europe, Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia (losing most to starvation and disease), leaving [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] to attempt to complete the conquest of Greece. However, the following year saw a Greek army decisively defeat the Persians at the [[Battle of Plataea]], thereby ending the Persian invasion.\n\nBoth ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae as an example of the power of a patriotic army defending its native soil. The performance of the defenders is also used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as [[force multiplier]]s and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds.\n\n==Sources==\n{{Main|Herodotus}}\nThe primary source for the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]]. The Sicilian historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], writing in the 1st century BC in his ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'', also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian [[Ephorus]]. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus'.<ref>Diodorus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Diod.+11.28 XI, 28\u201334],</ref> The Greco-Persian Wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], and are referred to by other authors, as in [[Aeschylus]] in ''[[The Persians]]''.\n\nArchaeological evidence, such as the [[Serpent Column]] (now in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]]), also supports some of Herodotus' specific claims.<ref>Note to Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.81 IX, 81]</ref> George B.

Herodotus agrees with this figure in one passage, quoting an inscription by [[Simonides]] saying there were 4,000 Peloponnesians.<ref name = VII228>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.228.1 VII, 228]</ref> However, elsewhere, in the passage summarized by the above table, Herodotus tallies 3,100 Peloponnesians at Thermopylae before the battle.<ref name = VII202/> Herodotus also reports that at Xerxes' public showing of the dead, \"helots were also there for them to see\",<ref name = VIII25>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.25.1 VIII, 25]</ref> but he does not say how many or in what capacity they served. Thus, the difference between his two figures can be squared by supposing (without proof) that there were 900 helots (three per Spartan) present at the battle.<ref name = \"Macan\">Macan, note to Herodotus VIII, 25</ref> If helots were present at the battle, there is no reason to doubt that they served in their traditional role as armed retainers to individual Spartans. Alternatively, Herodotus' \"missing\" 900 troops might have been [[Perioeci]], and could therefore correspond to Diodorus' 1,000 Lacedemonians.<ref name = \"Macan\"/>\n*The number of Lacedemonians\n:Further confusing the issue is Diodorus' ambiguity about whether his count of 1,000 Lacedemonians included the 300 Spartans. At one point he says: \"Leonidas, when he received the appointment, announced that only one thousand men should follow him on the campaign\".<ref name=dsXI4/> However, he then says: \"There were, then, of the Lacedemonians one thousand, and with them three hundred Spartiates\".<ref name=dsXI4/> It is therefore impossible to be clearer on this point.\n\n[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]' account agrees with that of Herodotus (whom he probably read) except that he gives the number of Locrians, which Herodotus declined to estimate. Residing in the direct path of the Persian advance, they gave all the fighting men they had - according to Pausanias 6,000 men - which added to Herodotus' 5,200 would have given a force of 11,200.<ref>Pausanias [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+10.20.1 X, 20]</ref>\n\nMany modern historians, who usually consider Herodotus more reliable,<ref name=Green>Green, p. 140</ref> add the 1,000 Lacedemonians and the 900 helots to Herodotus' 5,200 to obtain 7,100 or about 7,000 men as a standard number, neglecting Diodorus' Melians and Pausanias' Locrians.<ref>Bradford, p. 106</ref><ref name = russel>Bury, pp. 271\u2013282</ref> However, this is only one approach, and many other combinations are plausible. Furthermore, the numbers changed later on in the battle when most of the army retreated and only approximately 3,000 men remained (300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebans, possibly up to 900 helots, and 1,000 Phocians stationed above the pass, less the casualties sustained in the previous days).<ref name=Green/>\n\n==Strategic and tactical considerations==\n[[File:Nicolo arena battleofthermopylae.svg|thumb|250px|A flow map of the battle]]\nFrom a strategic point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks were making the best possible use of their forces.<ref name = L248/> As long as they could prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they had no need to seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor.<ref name = L248/> Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in the same place for very long.<ref name = h285>Holland, pp. 285\u2013287</ref> The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.<ref name = h285/>\n\nTactically, the pass at Thermopylae was ideally suited to the Greek style of warfare.<ref name = L248/> A [[hoplite]] [[phalanx formation|phalanx]] could block the narrow pass with ease, with no risk of being outflanked by cavalry. Moreover, in the pass, the phalanx would have been very difficult to assault for the more lightly armed Persian infantry.<ref name = L248/> The major weak point for the Greeks was the mountain track which led across the highland parallel to Thermopylae, that could allow their position to be outflanked. Although probably unsuitable for cavalry, this path could easily be traversed by the Persian infantry (many of whom were versed in [[mountain warfare]]).<ref name = h288>Holland, p 288</ref> Leonidas was made aware of this path by local people from [[Trachis]], and he positioned a detachment of Phocian troops there in order to block this route.<ref name = h262>Holland, pp. 262\u2013264</ref>\n\n===Topography of the battlefield===\n[[File:Thermopylae map 480bc.png|thumb|250px|Map of Thermopylae area with modern shoreline and reconstructed shoreline of 480 BC.]]\n\nIt is often claimed that at the time, the pass of Thermopylae consisted of a track along the shore of the Malian Gulf so narrow that only one chariot could pass through at a time.<ref name=\"VII176\" /> In fact, as noted below, the pass was 100 metres wide, probably wider than the Greeks could have held against the Persian masses. Herodotus reports that the Phocians had improved the defences of the pass by channelling the stream from the hot springs to create a marsh, and it was a causeway across this marsh which was only wide enough for a single chariot to traverse. In a later passage, describing a Gaulish attempt to force the pass, Pausinias states \"The cavalry on both sides proved useless, as the ground at the Pass is not only narrow, but also smooth because of the natural rock, while most of it is slippery owing to its being covered with streams...the losses of the barbarians it was impossible to discover exactly. For the number of them that disappeared beneath the mud was great.\"<ref>http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D10%3Achapter%3D21</ref>\n\nIt is also said that on the southern side of the track stood cliffs that overlooked the pass. However, a glance at any photograph of the pass shows there are no cliffs, only steep slopes covered in thorny bushes and trees. Although no obstacle to individuals, such terrain would not be passable by an army and its baggage train.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nOn the north side of the roadway was the [[Malian Gulf]], into which the land shelved gently.

The pure ruggedness of this area is caused by torrential downpours for four months of the year, combined with an intense summer season of scorching heat that cracks the ground. Vegetation is scarce and consists of low, thorny shrubs. The hillsides along the pass are covered in thick brush, with some plants reaching {{convert|10|ft|m}} high.

Herodotus suggests they were brought to the battle as hostages to ensure the good behavior of Thebes.<ref name = VII205/> However, as Plutarch long ago pointed out, if they were hostages, why not send them away with the rest of the Greeks?<ref name = L144/> The likelihood is that these were the Theban \"loyalists\", who unlike the majority of their fellow citizens, objected to Persian domination.<ref name = L144/> They thus probably came to Thermopylae of their own free will and stayed to the end because they could not return to Thebes if the Persians conquered Boeotia.<ref name = h291/> The Thespians, resolved as they were not to submit to Xerxes, faced the destruction of their city if the Persians took Boeotia.<ref name = L144/>\n\nHowever, this alone does not explain the fact that they remained; the remainder of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there.<ref name = L144/> It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster.<ref>Lazenby, pp. 259\u2013260</ref> This seems to have been a particularly Thespian trait \u2013 on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to a fight to the death.<ref name = L144/>\n\n[[File:Battle of Thermopylae Spartans and Persians.jpg|thumb|left|Spartans surrounded by Persians, Battle of Thermopylae. 19th century illustration.]]\nAt dawn, Xerxes made [[libation]]s, pausing to allow the Immortals sufficient time to descend the mountain, and then began his advance.<ref name=VII223>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.223.1 VII, 223]</ref> A Persian force of 10,000 men, comprising light infantry and cavalry, charged at the front of the Greek formation.

The battle itself had shown that even when heavily outnumbered, the Greeks could put up an effective fight against the Persians, and the defeat at Thermopylae had turned Leonidas and the men under his command into martyrs.

Xerxes had every reason to congratulate himself\",<ref>Cawkwell, p. 104.</ref> while Lazenby describes the Greek defeat as \"disastrous\".<ref name=\"Lazenby, p. 151\"/>\n\nThe fame of Thermopylae is thus principally derived not from its effect on the outcome of the war but for the inspirational example it set.<ref name = hnet/><ref>Lazenby, p. 150</ref> Thermopylae is famous because of the heroism of the doomed rearguard, who, despite facing certain death, remained at the pass.<ref name=\"hxviii\"/> Ever since, the events of Thermopylae have been the source of effusive praise from many sources: \"Salamis, Plataea, Mycale and Sicily are the fairest sister-victories which the Sun has ever seen, yet they would never dare to compare their combined glory with the glorious defeat of King Leonidas and his men\".<ref>Michel de Montaigne, quoted in Holland, p. ''xviii''.</ref> A second reason is the example it set of free men, fighting for their country and their freedom:\n\n<blockquote>So almost immediately, contemporary Greeks saw Thermopylae as a critical moral and culture lesson. In universal terms, a small, free people had willingly outfought huge numbers of imperial subjects who advanced under the lash. More specifically, the Western idea that soldiers themselves decide where, how, and against whom they will fight was contrasted against the Eastern notion of despotism and monarchy\u2014freedom proving the stronger idea as the more courageous fighting of the Greeks at Thermopylae, and their later victories at Salamis and Plataea attested.<ref name=\"hanson\">{{cite web|url=http://www.victorhanson.com/articles/hanson101106.html |title=Victor Hanson article |publisher=Victor Hanson article |date=11 October 2006 |accessdate=27 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319045718/http://www.victorhanson.com/articles/hanson101106.html |archivedate=19 March 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref></blockquote> While this paradigm of \"free men\" outfighting \"slaves\" can be seen as a rather sweeping over-generalization (there are many counter-examples), it is nevertheless true that many commentators have used Thermopylae to illustrate this point.<ref name = L248>Lazenby, pp. 248\u2013253</ref>\n\nMilitarily, although the battle was actually not decisive in the context of the Persian invasion, Thermopylae is of some significance on the basis of the first two days of fighting.

Some English renderings are given in the table below. It is also an example of [[Laconic phrase|Laconian brevity]], which allows for varying interpretations of the meaning of the poem.<ref name=\"Ziogas\"/> Ioannis Ziogas points out that the usual English translations are far from the only interpretation possible, and indicate much about the romantic tendencies of the translators.\n\nIt was well known in ancient Greece that all the Spartans who had been sent to Thermopylae had been killed there (with the exception of [[Aristodemus of Sparta|Aristodemus]] and [[Pantites]]), and the epitaph exploits the conceit that there was nobody left to bring the news of their deeds back to Sparta. Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (always called 'stranger') for sympathy, but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention much further than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to break the news that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out. The stranger is also asked to stress that the Spartans died 'fulfilling their orders'.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!'''Translation'''\n!'''Notes'''\n|+\n|-\n|Go tell the Spartans, thou who passest by,<br />That here, obedient to their laws, we lie.<ref>Strachey, p. 481</ref>\n|[[William Lisle Bowles]]\n|-\n|Stranger, tell the Spartans that we behaved <br />as they would wish us to, and are buried here.<ref>Golding, exceprt from The Hot Gates.</ref>\n|[[William Golding]]\n|-\n|Stranger!

Under the statue, a sign reads: \"In memory of the seven hundred Thespians.\"\n\nA plate below the statue explains its symbolism:\n* The headless male figure symbolizes the anonymous sacrifice of the 700 Thespians to their country.\n* The outstretched chest symbolizes the struggle, the gallantry, the strength, the bravery and the courage.\n* The open wing symbolizes the victory, the glory, the soul, the spirit and the freedom.\n* The broken wing symbolizes the voluntary sacrifice and death.\n* The naked body symbolizes Eros, the most important god of the ancient Thespians, a god of creation, beauty and life.\n\nThe monument to the Thespians is placed beside the one to the Spartans.\n\n===Associated legends===\n[[File:The Battle of Thermopylae engraving.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''The Battle of Thermopylae'', 19th century engraving]]\nHerodotus' colorful account of the battle has provided history with many apocryphal incidents and conversations away from the main historical events. These accounts are obviously not verifiable, but they form an integral part of the legend of the battle and often demonstrate the [[laconic]] speech (and wit) of the Spartans to good effect.\n\nFor instance, [[Plutarch]] recounts, in his ''Sayings of Spartan Women'', upon his departure, Leonidas' wife [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Gorgo]] asked what she should do if he did not return, to which Leonidas replied, \"Marry a good man and have good children.\"<ref>Plutarch, Apophthegmata Laconica [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0197%3Achapter%3D51%3Asection%3D2 Plut. Apoph. 51.2] and Moralia, 240 E (6)</ref>\n\nIt is reported that, upon arriving at Thermopylae, the Persians sent a mounted scout to reconnoitre. The Greeks allowed him to come up to the camp, observe them, and depart. Xerxes found the scout's reports of the size of the Greek force, and that the Spartans were indulging in [[calisthenics|callisthenics]] and combing their long hair, laughable. Seeking the counsel of [[Demaratus]], an exiled Spartan king in his retinue, Xerxes was told the Spartans were preparing for battle, and it was their custom to adorn their hair when they were about to risk their lives. Demaratus called them \"the bravest men in Greece\" and warned the Great King they intended to dispute the pass. He emphasized that he had tried to warn Xerxes earlier in the campaign, but the king had refused to believe him. He added that if Xerxes ever managed to subdue the Spartans, \"there is no other nation in all the world which will venture to lift a hand in their defence.\"<ref name=VII209>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.209.1 VII, 209]</ref>\n\nHerodotus also describes Leonidas' reception of a Persian embassy. The ambassador told Leonidas that Xerxes would offer him the kingship of all Greece if he joined with Xerxes. Leonidas answered: \"If you had any knowledge of the noble things of life, you would refrain from coveting others' possessions; but for me to die for Greece is better than to be the sole ruler over the people of my race.\"<ref>Plutarch, Moralia, 225, saying 10</ref> Then the ambassador asked him more forcefully to surrender their arms. To this Leonidas gave his famous answer: {{lang|grc|[[Molon labe|\u039c\u03bf\u03bb\u1f7c\u03bd \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03ad]]}} (pronounced {{IPA-el|mo\u02c8l\u0254\u02d0n la\u02c8be}}) \"Come and get them.\"<ref>Plutarch, Apophthegmata Laconica, Saying 11.</ref>\n\nSuch laconic bravery doubtlessly helped to maintain morale. Herodotus writes that when [[Dienekes]], a Spartan soldier, was informed that Persian arrows would be so numerous as \"to block out the sun\", he retorted, \"So much the better...then we shall fight our battle in the shade.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.226.1|title=Herodotus,  The Histories, Book 7, chapter 226, section 1|publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter the battle, Xerxes was curious as to what the Greeks had been trying to do (presumably because they had had so few men) and had some Arcadian deserters interrogated in his presence. The answer was: all the other men were participating in the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. When Xerxes asked what the prize was for the winner, the answer was: \"an olive-wreath\". Upon hearing this, [[Tigranes]], a Persian general, said: \"Good heavens, [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], what kind of men are these that you have pitted against us?

It leaves [[cauterization|cauterized]] wounds in flesh, but can be deflected by another lightsaber blade, or by [[energy shield]]s. The blade has even been used as a tool to weld metal. Other times, the lightsaber has been shown to cause bleeding wounds in the flesh, sometimes accompanied by burns. Some exotic saber-proof materials have been introduced in the ''[[Star Wars expanded universe|Expanded Universe]]''. An active lightsaber gives off a distinctive hum, which rises in pitch and volume as the blade is moved rapidly through the air. Bringing the blade into contact with another lightsaber's blade produces a loud crackle.\n\n==Conceptual origin==\nThere are several literary precedents in science fiction for a \"[[sword]]\" of pure energy that can cut through anything, notably:[[File:Analog_magazine_cover_art_showing_a_lightsaber.jpg|thumb|upright|Gordon R.

Adding a few \"[[greeble]]s\" (surface details), Christian managed to hand-make the first prototype of a lightsaber prop for Luke before production began. [[George Lucas]] decided he wanted to add a clip to the handle, so that Luke could hang it on his belt. Once Lucas felt the handle was up to his standards, it went to John Stears to create the wooden dowel rod with front-projection paint so that the animators would have a glow of light to enhance later on in post production. Due to lack of preparation time, Christian's prototype and a second spare were used for the shooting in Tunisia, where filming on ''Star Wars'' began.<ref>Star Wars Insider magazine issue No 98 January 2008</ref> It was discovered, however, that the glowing effect was greatly dependent on the rod's orientation to the camera, and during the [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]/[[Darth Vader]] duel, they could clearly be seen as rods. Because of this, the glow would be added in post-production through rotoscoping, which also allowed for diffusion to be employed to enhance the glow.\n\n=== Visual effects ===\nKorean [[animator]] [[Nelson Shin]], who was working for [[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]] at the time, was asked by his manager if he could animate the lightsaber in the live action scenes of a film. After Shin accepted the assignment, the live action footage was given to him. He drew the lightsabers with a [[rotoscope]], an animation which was superimposed onto the footage of the physical lightsaber blade prop. Shin explained to the people from Lucasfilm that since a lightsaber is made of light, the sword should look \"a little shaky\" like a fluorescent tube. He suggested inserting one frame that was much lighter than the others while printing the film on an [[optical printer]], making the light seem to vibrate. Shin also recommended adding a [[degaussing|degausser]] sound on top of the other sounds for the weapon since the sound would be reminiscent of a magnetic field. The whole process took one week, surprising his company. Lucasfilm showed Shin the finished product, having followed his suggestions to use an [[X-Acto|X-Acto knife]] to give the lightsaber a very sharp look, and to have sound accompany the weapon's movements.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Interview with Nelson Shin| publisher = [[CNN]]|date = November 9, 2007 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/10/18/talkasia.nelsonshin/index.html}}</ref>\n\n===Sound===\nThe lightsaber [[sound effect]] was developed by sound designer [[Ben Burtt]] as a combination of the hum of idling [[Movie projector#Automation and the rise of the multiplex|interlock motors]] in aged movie projectors and interference caused by a television set on a shieldless [[microphone]].

Each lightsaber is unique, though some may bear resemblance to others, especially if there is a connection between the builders. The first film appearance of a dual-bladed lightsaber (first depicted in the comic series ''[[Tales of the Jedi]]'') was in ''The Phantom Menace'', wielded by [[Darth Maul]]. The video game ''[[The Force Unleashed]]'' introduced two other variants: a lightsaber pike (a lightsaber with a shorter blade but a long handle, resembling a spear) and a [[Tonfa]]-style lightsaber with right-angle hilt. [[Count Dooku]] wields a standard lightsaber with a curved hilt.\n\nThe [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] adds several lightsaber types, including short<ref name=\"KOTOR1\">{{cite video game|title=[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]] |developer=[[BioWare]] |publisher=[[LucasArts]] |date=November 19, 2003 |platform=PC }}</ref> and dual-phase (adjustable length) weapons.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Anderson |first=Kevin J. |authorlink=Kevin J.

His blade also has an unstable, fiery appearance, explained in canon reference books as stemming from a cracked kyber crystal.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pinchefsky |first=Carol |title=Kylo Ren's janky lightsaber, explained |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/kylo-rens-janky-lightsaber-explained |website=SyFy Wire |accessdate=October 18, 2019 |date=December 31, 2015}}</ref> The Inquisitors of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] are depicted as wielding a unique variation of a double-bladed saber, mounted on a rotating ring enabling the blades 360 degrees of rotation. More obscure lightsaber variations, such as the \"lightwhip\", an elongated flexible blade used in a matter akin to a [[whip]], the \"lightclub\", an enlarged standard lightsaber, and the \"shoto\", a dramatically smaller variation often paired with a standard sized saber have also made appearances.\n\n===Colors===\nLightsabers depicted in the first two released films, ''A New Hope'' and ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', had blades that were colored either blue (for the Jedi) or red (for the Sith). [[Luke Skywalker]]'s new lightsaber in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' was colored blue during the initial editing of the film, and appears so in both an early movie trailer and the official theatrical posters. However, it was changed to green in the film's final edit after initial viewings by the filmmakers, who felt that it would better stand out against the blue sky of [[Tatooine]] in outdoor scenes, and this color change is also reflected in the film's re-release posters. [[Mace Windu]]'s purple-bladed lightsaber, as first seen in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'', was requested by the actor [[Samuel L. Jackson]] for two reasons; purple is his favorite color and that the purple blade is one way to make his character stand out among other Jedi. Jackson is known to frequently request that the characters he plays use an item that is purple in color.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubyo5eZz_Jc|title=Samuel L.

The color of this crystal becomes the blade's color when installed into a lightsaber hilt. In the book ''[[Star Wars: Ahsoka]]'' and the comic series ''Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith'', it is shown that dark side users remove the crystal from a defeated Jedi's lightsaber and concentrate force energy on it to break its connection to the light side, a process known as \"bleeding\" to create a red crystal. The process can also be reversed, as shown in ''Ahsoka'' when the titular character does so to a pair of crystals taken from an Inquisitor; she uses them in a pair of white-bladed lightsabers.\n\nA multitude of blade colors have appeared in the Expanded Universe before the precursor films rendered many of the explanations for their coloring [[canon (fiction)|non-canonical]].\n\n{{anchor|Darksaber}} The Darksaber is a unique lightsaber that has a distinct black blade with a white halo, introduced in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' (2008) and subsequently appearing in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', where it is described as an ancient lightsaber created by the first [[Mandalorian]] to become a Jedi, and later serves as a symbol of Mandalorian authority.

Anderson personally trained [[Mark Hamill]] (Luke Skywalker) and, in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi'', performed all the stunts as [[Darth Vader]] during the lightsaber duels wearing Vader's costume. Anderson's role in the trilogy was highlighted in the film ''[[Reclaiming the Blade]]'' where he shared his experiences as a fencer developing the lightsaber techniques for the three original movies.\n\nThe lightsaber duels in the ''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy were specifically choreographed by stunt-coordinator [[Nick Gillard]] to be miniature \"stories\". For these films, Gillard was the primary sword instructor for [[Liam Neeson]] ([[Qui-Gon Jinn]]), [[Ewan McGregor]] (Obi-Wan Kenobi), [[Ray Park]] ([[Darth Maul]]) and [[Hayden Christensen]] (Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader) among other actors. His goal in choreographing the action for ''The Phantom Menace'' was to create stunts that flow from the story; \"You can't just think, 'I'm a [[stunt coordinator]], I'm going to make a big stunt happen',\" Gillard said. \"It's all about making it tie in nicely with the film so that you don't notice the stunts.\"{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nIn writing the prequel trilogy, George Lucas said he wanted the lightsaber combat to be \"reminiscent of what had been done in the previous films but also something that was more energized. We'd seen old men, young boys, and characters who were half-droid, but we'd never seen a Jedi in his prime. I wanted to do that with a fight that was faster and more dynamic \u2013 and we were able to pull that off.\"<ref>{{Cite book| last = Bouzereau| first = Laurent| last2 = Duncan| first2 = Jody| title = Star Wars: The Making of Episode I: The Phantom Menace| place=New York| publisher = Ballantine Publ.

So with Obi-Wan Kenobi, for instance, he's got a very business-like style \u2013 when he was younger he could border on the flashy and might twirl his lightsaber a bit, because he was taught by Qui-Gon. Qui-Gon was brash, that rubbed off on Obi-Wan and Obi-Wan then taught Anakin, who was way too old to learn anyway... I think the style really worked well.

In the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]], there were several [[Star Wars video games|''Star Wars'' video games]] available on the [[Wii]] (''[[Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]'', ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'', ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Lightsaber Duels]]'', ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Republic Heroes]]'' and ''[[Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars]]'') and one on the [[Xbox 360]] (''[[Kinect Star Wars]]'') that utilized motion controls to wield a lightsaber through arm gestures. ''Unleashed'' and ''Duels'', both developed by [[Krome Studios]], have more precise control of the lightsaber, allowing players to swing it in any of five different directions (up, down, left, right or forward) with the [[Wii Remote]], while ''Kinect'' takes advantage of [[Kinect#Kinect for Xbox 360 (2010)|the eponymous, camera-based motion controller]] to grant the player a more fluid, one-to-one control method of swinging the lightsaber.\n\nPrior to the seventh generation, there were also a few earlier ''Star Wars'' games that used gesture-based control to simulate lightsaber combat, such as the two bonus levels of the [[arcade game]] ''[[Star Wars Trilogy Arcade|Star Wars Trilogy]]'', where the player controls Luke Skywalker as he wields his lightsaber against [[Boba Fett]] and Darth Vader in ''Return of the Jedi'' by pushing a joystick in one of eight directions to follow on-screen offensive and defensive cues,<ref name=\"SWTA overview at AllGame\">{{allgame | 15820 | first=Christopher Michael | last=Baker | accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref> and a [[TV game]] released around the release of ''Revenge of the Sith'', titled ''Star Wars: Saga Edition - Lightsaber Battle Game'', in which the player swings a lightsaber-shaped controller to deflect blaster bolts from infantry (such as [[battle droids]] and [[clone troopers]]) and duel against characters from across the saga.\n\nBy the time [[Disney]] purchased Lucasfilm, new technological advances made [[augmented reality]] possible, leading to the creation of some more notable motion-controlled lightsaber video games that took advantage of that feature. One of them came in the form of a special activity mode in the official ''Star Wars'' fan app on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in which players use their smartphone's motion sensors to practice and master blaster deflection with a training droid (which appears on the phone's rear camera), similar to the deflection training exercises featured aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' in ''A New Hope'', while progressing through the ranks of the Jedi or Sith order. Another is in ''Star Wars: Jedi Challenges'', which works with a Lenovo Mirage AR headset, a tracking sensor and a dedicated lightsaber controller that launched in December 2017. One of the multiple game modes available in ''Challenges'', which was jointly developed by Disney and [[Lenovo]], enables players to confront ''Star Wars'' villains in lightsaber duels, such as Darth Maul and Kylo Ren.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/31/star-wars-jedi-challenges-augmented-reality-game-launches-with-lenovo-mirage-headset.html|title=Lenovo, Disney launch ''Star Wars'' Jedi aurgmented reality game that lets you use a real lightsaber|first=Arjun|last=Kharpal|date=August 31, 2017|publisher=[[CNBC]]|accessdate=October 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Speculative fiction|Film}}\n* [[List of Star Wars weapons|List of ''Star Wars'' weapons]]\n* [[Physics and Star Wars|Physics and ''Star Wars'']]\n* [[Photonic molecule]]\n* ''[[Star Wars: Evolution of the Lightsaber Duel]]''\n\n== References ==\n'''Footnotes'''\n{{notelist}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Lightsabers}}\n*{{Star Wars Databank|subject=lightsaber|text = Lightsaber}}\n* {{Wookieepedia|Lightsaber}}\n* [http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/lightsaber1.htm \"Howstuffworks \u2013 Inside the Lightsaber\"]\n* [http://www.shortlist.com/news/scientists-could-create-real-lightsabers#art Scientists Could Create Real Lightsabers]\n\n{{Star Wars universe|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Star Wars weapons]]\n[[Category:Fictional swords]]\n[[Category:Jedi]]\n[[Category:Sith]]\n[[Category:Fictional martial arts]]\n[[Category:Fictional energy weapons]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the song by EXO|Lightsaber (song)}}\n{{short description|Fictional weapon}}\n{{Infobox fictional artifact\n|color           = Black\n|name            = Lightsaber\n|image           = Lightsaber, silver hilt, blue blade.png\n|caption         = A blue beamed lightsaber\n|alt             = Lightsaber with blue beam\n|first           = [[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977)\n|first_ep        = \n|first_type      = \n|date            = \n|creator         = [[George Lucas]]\n|episode_creator = \n|source          = {{Linkcolor|LightBlue|Star Wars}}\n|source_type     = franchise\n|company         = [[Lucasfilm]] \n|type            = Energy sword\n|genre           = [[Science fiction/Science fantasy]]\n|traits          = \n|affiliation     = [[Jedi]]<br />[[Sith]]<br />[[Knights of Ren]]\n}}\n{{Use American English|date = July 2019}}\n\nA '''lightsaber''' is a fictional energy sword featured in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise.

It leaves [[cauterization|cauterized]] wounds in flesh, but can be deflected by another lightsaber blade, or by [[energy shield]]s. The blade has even been used as a tool to weld metal. Other times, the lightsaber has been shown to cause bleeding wounds in the flesh, sometimes accompanied by burns. Some exotic saber-proof materials have been introduced in the ''[[Star Wars expanded universe|Expanded Universe]]''. An active lightsaber gives off a distinctive hum, which rises in pitch and volume as the blade is moved rapidly through the air.

Adding a few \"[[greeble]]s\" (surface details), Christian managed to hand-make the first prototype of a lightsaber prop for Luke before production began. [[George Lucas]] decided he wanted to add a clip to the handle, so that Luke could hang it on his belt. Once Lucas felt the handle was up to his standards, it went to John Stears to create the wooden dowel rod with front-projection paint so that the animators would have a glow of light to enhance later on in post production. Due to lack of preparation time, Christian's prototype and a second spare were used for the shooting in Tunisia, where filming on ''Star Wars'' began.<ref>Star Wars Insider magazine issue No 98 January 2008</ref> It was discovered, however, that the glowing effect was greatly dependent on the rod's orientation to the camera, and during the [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]/[[Darth Vader]] duel, they could clearly be seen as rods. Because of this, the glow would be added in post-production through rotoscoping, which also allowed for diffusion to be employed to enhance the glow.\n\n=== Visual effects ===\nKorean [[animator]] [[Nelson Shin]], who was working for [[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]] at the time, was asked by his manager if he could animate the lightsaber in the live action scenes of a film. After Shin accepted the assignment, the live action footage was given to him. He drew the lightsabers with a [[rotoscope]], an animation which was superimposed onto the footage of the physical lightsaber blade prop. Shin explained to the people from Lucasfilm that since a lightsaber is made of light, the sword should look \"a little shaky\" like a fluorescent tube. He suggested inserting one frame that was much lighter than the others while printing the film on an [[optical printer]], making the light seem to vibrate. Shin also recommended adding a [[degaussing|degausser]] sound on top of the other sounds for the weapon since the sound would be reminiscent of a magnetic field. The whole process took one week, surprising his company. Lucasfilm showed Shin the finished product, having followed his suggestions to use an [[X-Acto|X-Acto knife]] to give the lightsaber a very sharp look, and to have sound accompany the weapon's movements.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Interview with Nelson Shin| publisher = [[CNN]]|date = November 9, 2007 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/10/18/talkasia.nelsonshin/index.html}}</ref>\n\n===Sound===\nThe lightsaber [[sound effect]] was developed by sound designer [[Ben Burtt]] as a combination of the hum of idling [[Movie projector#Automation and the rise of the multiplex|interlock motors]] in aged movie projectors and interference caused by a television set on a shieldless [[microphone]].

Each lightsaber is unique, though some may bear resemblance to others, especially if there is a connection between the builders. The first film appearance of a dual-bladed lightsaber (first depicted in the comic series ''[[Tales of the Jedi]]'') was in ''The Phantom Menace'', wielded by [[Darth Maul]]. The video game ''[[The Force Unleashed]]'' introduced two other variants: a lightsaber pike (a lightsaber with a shorter blade but a long handle, resembling a spear) and a [[Tonfa]]-style lightsaber with right-angle hilt. [[Count Dooku]] wields a standard lightsaber with a curved hilt.\n\nThe [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] adds several lightsaber types, including short<ref name=\"KOTOR1\">{{cite video game|title=[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]] |developer=[[BioWare]] |publisher=[[LucasArts]] |date=November 19, 2003 |platform=PC }}</ref> and dual-phase (adjustable length) weapons.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Anderson |first=Kevin J. |authorlink=Kevin J.

His blade also has an unstable, fiery appearance, explained in canon reference books as stemming from a cracked kyber crystal.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pinchefsky |first=Carol |title=Kylo Ren's janky lightsaber, explained |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/kylo-rens-janky-lightsaber-explained |website=SyFy Wire |accessdate=October 18, 2019 |date=December 31, 2015}}</ref> The Inquisitors of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] are depicted as wielding a unique variation of a double-bladed saber, mounted on a rotating ring enabling the blades 360 degrees of rotation. More obscure lightsaber variations, such as the \"lightwhip\", an elongated flexible blade used in a matter akin to a [[whip]], the \"lightclub\", an enlarged standard lightsaber, and the \"shoto\", a dramatically smaller variation often paired with a standard sized saber have also made appearances.\n\n===Colors===\nLightsabers depicted in the first two released films, ''A New Hope'' and ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', had blades that were colored either blue (for the Jedi) or red (for the Sith). [[Luke Skywalker]]'s new lightsaber in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' was colored blue during the initial editing of the film, and appears so in both an early movie trailer and the official theatrical posters. However, it was changed to green in the film's final edit after initial viewings by the filmmakers, who felt that it would better stand out against the blue sky of [[Tatooine]] in outdoor scenes, and this color change is also reflected in the film's re-release posters. [[Mace Windu]]'s purple-bladed lightsaber, as first seen in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'', was requested by the actor [[Samuel L. Jackson]] for two reasons; purple is his favorite color and that the purple blade is one way to make his character stand out among other Jedi. Jackson is known to frequently request that the characters he plays use an item that is purple in color.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubyo5eZz_Jc|title=Samuel L.

The color of this crystal becomes the blade's color when installed into a lightsaber hilt. In the book ''[[Star Wars: Ahsoka]]'' and the comic series ''Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith'', it is shown that dark side users remove the crystal from a defeated Jedi's lightsaber and concentrate force energy on it to break its connection to the light side, a process known as \"bleeding\" to create a red crystal. The process can also be reversed, as shown in ''Ahsoka'' when the titular character does so to a pair of crystals taken from an Inquisitor; she uses them in a pair of white-bladed lightsabers.\n\nA multitude of blade colors have appeared in the Expanded Universe before the precursor films rendered many of the explanations for their coloring [[canon (fiction)|non-canonical]].\n\n{{anchor|Darksaber}} The Darksaber is a unique lightsaber that has a distinct black blade with a white halo, introduced in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' (2008) and subsequently appearing in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', where it is described as an ancient lightsaber created by the first [[Mandalorian]] to become a Jedi, and later serves as a symbol of Mandalorian authority. It subsequently appears briefly in the first season finale of ''[[Star Wars: The Mandalorian]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Darksaber|url=https://www.starwars.com/databank/darksaber|website=StarWars.com|accessdate=January 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What is the Darksaber?|url= https://www.starwars.com/news/what-is-the-darksaber|date=February 11, 2020|last=Knox|first=Kelly|accessdate=February 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://io9.gizmodo.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-darksaber-the-bl-1840779738 | title = Everything You Need to Know About the Darksaber, the Black Blade That Freed Mandalore | first = James | last= Whitbrook | date = January 3, 2020 | accessdate = January 3, 2020 | work = [[io9]] }}</ref>\n\n===Choreography===\nThe technical lightsaber choreography for the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy was developed by [[Hollywood]] sword-master [[Bob Anderson (fencer)|Bob Anderson]]. Anderson personally trained [[Mark Hamill]] (Luke Skywalker) and, in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi'', performed all the stunts as [[Darth Vader]] during the lightsaber duels wearing Vader's costume. Anderson's role in the trilogy was highlighted in the film ''[[Reclaiming the Blade]]'' where he shared his experiences as a fencer developing the lightsaber techniques for the three original movies.\n\nThe lightsaber duels in the ''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy were specifically choreographed by stunt-coordinator [[Nick Gillard]] to be miniature \"stories\". For these films, Gillard was the primary sword instructor for [[Liam Neeson]] ([[Qui-Gon Jinn]]), [[Ewan McGregor]] (Obi-Wan Kenobi), [[Ray Park]] ([[Darth Maul]]) and [[Hayden Christensen]] (Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader) among other actors. His goal in choreographing the action for ''The Phantom Menace'' was to create stunts that flow from the story; \"You can't just think, 'I'm a [[stunt coordinator]], I'm going to make a big stunt happen',\" Gillard said. \"It's all about making it tie in nicely with the film so that you don't notice the stunts.\"{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nIn writing the prequel trilogy, George Lucas said he wanted the lightsaber combat to be \"reminiscent of what had been done in the previous films but also something that was more energized. We'd seen old men, young boys, and characters who were half-droid, but we'd never seen a Jedi in his prime. I wanted to do that with a fight that was faster and more dynamic \u2013 and we were able to pull that off.\"<ref>{{Cite book| last = Bouzereau| first = Laurent| last2 = Duncan| first2 = Jody| title = Star Wars: The Making of Episode I: The Phantom Menace| place=New York| publisher = Ballantine Publ.

So with Obi-Wan Kenobi, for instance, he's got a very business-like style \u2013 when he was younger he could border on the flashy and might twirl his lightsaber a bit, because he was taught by Qui-Gon. Qui-Gon was brash, that rubbed off on Obi-Wan and Obi-Wan then taught Anakin, who was way too old to learn anyway... I think the style really worked well. The Jedi style of fighting is an amalgamation of all the great [[swordsmanship|swordfighting]] styles. Melding them together is the difficult part \u2013 to move from a [[Kendo]] style to, say, [[rapier]] requires a complete change in body and feet movement, and this must look effortless.

In the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]], there were several [[Star Wars video games|''Star Wars'' video games]] available on the [[Wii]] (''[[Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]'', ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'', ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Lightsaber Duels]]'', ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Republic Heroes]]'' and ''[[Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars]]'') and one on the [[Xbox 360]] (''[[Kinect Star Wars]]'') that utilized motion controls to wield a lightsaber through arm gestures. ''Unleashed'' and ''Duels'', both developed by [[Krome Studios]], have more precise control of the lightsaber, allowing players to swing it in any of five different directions (up, down, left, right or forward) with the [[Wii Remote]], while ''Kinect'' takes advantage of [[Kinect#Kinect for Xbox 360 (2010)|the eponymous, camera-based motion controller]] to grant the player a more fluid, one-to-one control method of swinging the lightsaber.\n\nPrior to the seventh generation, there were also a few earlier ''Star Wars'' games that used gesture-based control to simulate lightsaber combat, such as the two bonus levels of the [[arcade game]] ''[[Star Wars Trilogy Arcade|Star Wars Trilogy]]'', where the player controls Luke Skywalker as he wields his lightsaber against [[Boba Fett]] and Darth Vader in ''Return of the Jedi'' by pushing a joystick in one of eight directions to follow on-screen offensive and defensive cues,<ref name=\"SWTA overview at AllGame\">{{allgame | 15820 | first=Christopher Michael | last=Baker | accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref> and a [[TV game]] released around the release of ''Revenge of the Sith'', titled ''Star Wars: Saga Edition - Lightsaber Battle Game'', in which the player swings a lightsaber-shaped controller to deflect blaster bolts from infantry (such as [[battle droids]] and [[clone troopers]]) and duel against characters from across the saga.\n\nBy the time [[Disney]] purchased Lucasfilm, new technological advances made [[augmented reality]] possible, leading to the creation of some more notable motion-controlled lightsaber video games that took advantage of that feature. One of them came in the form of a special activity mode in the official ''Star Wars'' fan app on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in which players use their smartphone's motion sensors to practice and master blaster deflection with a training droid (which appears on the phone's rear camera), similar to the deflection training exercises featured aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' in ''A New Hope'', while progressing through the ranks of the Jedi or Sith order. Another is in ''Star Wars: Jedi Challenges'', which works with a Lenovo Mirage AR headset, a tracking sensor and a dedicated lightsaber controller that launched in December 2017. One of the multiple game modes available in ''Challenges'', which was jointly developed by Disney and [[Lenovo]], enables players to confront ''Star Wars'' villains in lightsaber duels, such as Darth Maul and Kylo Ren.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/31/star-wars-jedi-challenges-augmented-reality-game-launches-with-lenovo-mirage-headset.html|title=Lenovo, Disney launch ''Star Wars'' Jedi aurgmented reality game that lets you use a real lightsaber|first=Arjun|last=Kharpal|date=August 31, 2017|publisher=[[CNBC]]|accessdate=October 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Speculative fiction|Film}}\n* [[List of Star Wars weapons|List of ''Star Wars'' weapons]]\n* [[Physics and Star Wars|Physics and ''Star Wars'']]\n* [[Photonic molecule]]\n* ''[[Star Wars: Evolution of the Lightsaber Duel]]''\n\n== References ==\n'''Footnotes'''\n{{notelist}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Lightsabers}}\n*{{Star Wars Databank|subject=lightsaber|text = Lightsaber}}\n* {{Wookieepedia|Lightsaber}}\n* [http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/lightsaber1.htm \"Howstuffworks \u2013 Inside the Lightsaber\"]\n* [http://www.shortlist.com/news/scientists-could-create-real-lightsabers#art Scientists Could Create Real Lightsabers]\n\n{{Star Wars universe|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Star Wars weapons]]\n[[Category:Fictional swords]]\n[[Category:Jedi]]\n[[Category:Sith]]\n[[Category:Fictional martial arts]]\n[[Category:Fictional energy weapons]]\n", "name_user": "UpdateNerd", "label": "safe", "comment": "date formatting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber"}

He was born in [[Humpolec]], [[Bohemia]] (today in the [[Czech Republic]]).\n\n==Life and career==\nHis mother, Karol\u00edna Hrdli\u010dkov\u00e1, educated her child herself; his skills and knowledge made it possible to skip the primary level of school. The family [[History of immigration to the United States|emigrated to the U.S.]] in 1881, when he was only 13. After arrival, the promised job brought only a disappointment to his father who started working in a cigar factory along with teenaged Alois to earn living for the family with 6 other children. Young Hrdli\u010dka attended evening courses to improve his English, and at the age of 18, he decided to study medicine since he had suffered from tuberculosis and experienced the treatment difficulties of those times. In 1889, Hrdli\u010dka began studies at Eclectic Medical College and then continued at [[Homeopatic College in New York]]. To finish his medical studies, Hrdli\u010dka sat for exams in [[Baltimore]] in 1894. At first, he worked in the [[Middletown asylum]] for mentally affected where he learnt of [[anthropometry]]. In 1896, Hrdli\u010dka left for [[Paris]], where he started to work as an anthropologist with other experts of then establishing field of science.\n\nBetween 1898 and 1903, during his scientific travel across America, Hrdli\u010dka became the first scientist to spot and document the [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|theory of human colonization of the American continent]] from east Asia, which he claimed was only some 3,000 years ago. He argued that the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] migrated across the [[Bering Strait]] from Asia, supporting this theory with detailed field research of skeletal remains as well as studies of the people in [[Mongolia]], [[Tibet]], [[Siberia]], [[Alaska]], and [[Aleutian Islands]]. The findings backed up the argument which later contributed to the theory of global origin of human species that was awarded by the [[Thomas Henry Huxley Award]] in 1927.\n\nAle\u0161 Hrdli\u010dka founded and became the first [[curator]] of physical anthropology of the U.S. National Museum, now the [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Museum of Natural History]] in 1903.

He was a critic of [[hominid]] evolution as well as the Asia hypothesis, as he claimed there was little evidence to go on for those theories. He dismissed finds such as the [[Ramapithecus]] which were labeled as hominids by most scientists, instead believing that they were nothing more than [[fossil]] [[apes]], unrelated to human ancestry.<ref>The primate fossil record, Walter Carl Hartwig, p. 370</ref><ref>Bones of contention, controversies in the search for human origins, Roger Lewin, p. 89</ref><ref>God-apes and fossil men: paleoanthropology of South Asia, Kenneth A.

He was born in [[Humpolec]], [[Bohemia]] (today in the [[Czech Republic]]).\n\n==Life and career==\nHis mother, Karol\u00edna Hrdli\u010dkov\u00e1, educated her child herself; his skills and knowledge made it possible to skip the primary level of school. The family [[History of immigration to the United States|emigrated to the U.S.]] in 1881, when he was only 13. After arrival, the promised job brought only a disappointment to his father who started working in a cigar factory along with teenaged Alois to earn living for the family with 6 other children. Young Hrdli\u010dka attended evening courses to improve his English, and at the age of 18, he decided to study medicine since he had suffered from tuberculosis and experienced the treatment difficulties of those times. In 1889, Hrdli\u010dka began studies at Eclectic Medical College and then continued at [[Homeopatic College in New York]]. To finish his medical studies, Hrdli\u010dka sat for exams in [[Baltimore]] in 1894. At first, he worked in the [[Middletown asylum]] for mentally affected where he learnt of [[anthropometry]]. In 1896, Hrdli\u010dka left for [[Paris]], where he started to work as an anthropologist with other experts of then establishing field of science.\n\nBetween 1898 and 1903, during his scientific travel across America, Hrdli\u010dka became the first scientist to spot and document the [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|theory of human colonization of the American continent]] from east Asia, which he claimed was only some 3,000 years ago. He argued that the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] migrated across the [[Bering Strait]] from Asia, supporting this theory with detailed field research of skeletal remains as well as studies of the people in [[Mongolia]], [[Tibet]], [[Siberia]], [[Alaska]], and [[Aleutian Islands]]. The findings backed up the argument which later contributed to the theory of global origin of human species that was awarded by the [[Thomas Henry Huxley Award]] in 1927.\n\nAle\u0161 Hrdli\u010dka founded and became the first [[curator]] of physical anthropology of the U.S. National Museum, now the [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Museum of Natural History]] in 1903. He was the founder of the ''[[American Journal of Physical Anthropology]]'' in 1918.<ref>[[Charles C. Mann]]. ''[[1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus]]''. Knopf (2005) {{ISBN|978-1-4000-3205-1}}. p 164.</ref>  After he stepped down, the journal volume number, which had reached Volume 29 in 1942, was restarted at Volume 1 in 1943.\n\nHrdli\u010dka was involved in examining a skull to determine that it belonged to Adolph Ruth, who was sensationalized in the press when Ruth went missing in Arizona in 1931 searching for the legendary [[Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine]].
