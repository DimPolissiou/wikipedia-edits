A significant number of Lamanites convert to [[Christianity]], band together and take the name Anti-Nephi-Lehies, rejecting the name Lamanite.  The king of the newly formed people dies, and his son becomes king, changing his name to Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

Thus adopting the name Anti-Nephi-Lehi was a way of symbolizing their own rebellion against traditional Lamanite ways, or becoming anti-Lamanite.<ref>Vogel, D. (2004).

Thus, rather than having the sense \"against\", it may have the meaning \"the one of Nephi and Lehi\".<ref>Hugh Nibley, Quoted in Eldin Ricks, Book of Mormon Study Guide, p. 63. as cited in Ludlow, A Companion to Your Study of the Book of Mormon, 209-210</ref>\n* [[Hugh Nibley]] further suggested that it could have semitic origins and mean \"Nephi brought face to face with other descendents of Lehi\".<ref>Hugh W.

Matthews, \"The Lamanite Converts Firm in the Faith,\" in Studies in Scripture: Book of Mormon, Part 1, pp. 337-339</ref>\n* Historian [[Dan Vogel]] notes that in the Book of Mormon, the land of [[Lehi-Nephi]] was a region where Limhi's people had been kept captive before rebelling and escaping.  Thus adopting the name Anti-Nephi-Lehi was a way of symbolizing their own rebellion against traditional Lamanite ways, or becoming anti-Lamanite.<ref>Vogel, D. (2004). Joseph Smith: The Making of a Prophet. Signature Books. e-book location 8365 of 19201</ref>\n\n\nLDS Church scholars who believe the Book of Mormon was written in [[reformed Egyptian| a language related to Egyptian]] with semitic influences suggest further potential meanings:\n\n* [[Hugh Nibley]] suggested that \"Anti\" may be a reflex of the Egyptian \"nty:\", ''he of, the one of.'' Thus, rather than having the sense \"against\", it may have the meaning \"the one of Nephi and Lehi\".<ref>Hugh Nibley, Quoted in Eldin Ricks, Book of Mormon Study Guide, p. 63. as cited in Ludlow, A Companion to Your Study of the Book of Mormon, 209-210</ref>\n* [[Hugh Nibley]] further suggested that it could have semitic origins and mean \"Nephi brought face to face with other descendents of Lehi\".<ref>Hugh W. Nibley, Teachings of the Book of Mormon, Semester 2, p. 428</ref>\n* [[John Gee]], [[Brian M. Hauglid]] and Paul Hoskisson suggest the name is a transliteration.<ref>Hoskisson, Paul Y.; Hauglid, Brian M.; and Gee, John (2002) \"What's in a Name?

The first settler was John Gray also known as George Gray. Prior to that time, an early deed was recorded of this section as far as Hays, known then as Six Mile Ferry. This section was granted to John Gray by John and Thomas Penn, sons of William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania. The original deed is in the hands of the C. L. Whitaker family of Dravosburg.\n\nThe property, formerly known as Mt. Gray, 18 remembered as the Cunningham farm, a heritage of the Gray family. The first home of the Cunningham family was a two room log house overlooking the River, built in 1851& and known as Amity Settlement arid later was the home of Conrad Goldstrom. The second home of the Cunningham family is now Airways Tavern at the junction of the Lebanon Church Road and the Pittsburgh-McKeesport Boulevard. The Jabez Grooms Family lived in this house and farm for many years. The civil War halted further building on the hill as many of the young men were in the service.\n\nIn 1789, the land where Richland Cemetery is located was deeded to Conrad Latterbock. The land extended back as far as the property now known as Curry Hollow. The cemetery section was used as a private burial place and was known by two names - Richland and Coventry. In 1837 this land was deeded to the Curry family and known as the Curry Place. Part of this land is still known as Curry Hollow. The Curry home was a log house located near the Junction of the Elizabeth Road and Washington Avenue.\n\nDravosburg, a part of Mifflin Township, was incorporated into a March 31, 1903. The first Burgess was Stephen Crump elected May 6, 1903. The first councilmen who held the first meeting in the Risher Real Estate Office, located at the site of the Richards Building, were V. C. McCune, J. D. Myers, E. E. Chester, Charles Corey, C. L Stoops, John Ord and Harvey Berger. Mr. McCune was elected President of Council. Mr. Berger was ill when the first meeting was held and died two days later. This meeting was held May 11, 1903.\n\nThe first order of business after organization was to hire a policeman, who also served as street commissioner, buy a revolver, a mace, two pairs of handcuffs and order a lockup built. It was ready June 7, l904. This building located across the tracks from the P.R.R. Station still stands but has net been used as a Jail for a few years.\n\nSince the first mine was opened in 1835, a great change has taken place. From a small group of homes centered around the mine, the town grew into a flourishing residential community. If, in 1903, Dravosburg was a quiet, peaceful community, why the revolver, mace, handcuffs and a lockup built?\n\nDravosburg started with the opening of a coal mine at the extreme north end of town by William and John Cunningham in 1835 and continued to operate until 1856 when it was sold to Mr. William Stone. Mr. Stone operated the mine until his death. It was then taken over by his heirs and operated until it was worked out. The area was known as Stonesburg.\n\nOn March 22, 1856, Mr. Whigham hauled coal across the river to McKeesport. The ice was four feet thick. In 1840 the Dravo mine was opened by James O'Neil. Mr. O'Neil operated the mine until 1851. It was then sold to Michael Dravo and sons. Six beehive coke ovens were built. The slack from the mine was used in the manufacture of coke. The coke was shipped by river to southern markets.\n\nIn 1809, the mine and coke ovens were sold to J. C. Risher by John P. Dravo. A third mine known as the Amity mine was opened in 1851 by J. C. Risher. Mr. Risher leased the mine to Daniel Bushmiller who operated it until 1859. It vas then taken back by the Rishers. Mr. Risher operated the mine until his death in 1889. The mine was then taken over by S. S. Crump and was then known as the Risher mine. It continued to operate until 1900, when it was sold to the Pittsburgh Coal Company. They shipped coal by rail and river until the mine was worked out.\n\nAs early as 1865, there were two saw mills in Dravosburg. One was owned and operated by William McCleary who sold the mill in 1880 to Alva Gulp. Mr. McCleary stayed on and under his supervision, the mill did a thriving business. Mr. Culp owned the mill only two years when his hand was amputated by a saw he was operating. Mr. Culp also owned a boat yard, but lost all interest in the work and the mill was abandoned. The machinery was sold, but the buildings stood until they were destroyed in the 1936 flood. The mill was located about 300 yards south of the Stone's Coal Tipple.\n\nThe Risher mill was in the upper part of town and was a boat yard and dock. In 1900 W. C. McCune purchased the holdings and operated it until his death in 1918. It was then bought by the Hillman Coal Company and was used as a landing and boat yard until April, 1951, when they moved to Elicia, Pennsylvania. The Ohio Barge Line is now using the river front as a landing.\n\nWhen Dravosburg incorporated as a Borough, a school board was needed. On May 6, 1903, five directors were elected. They were Dr. A. H. Aber, Dr. F. F. Sumney, Charles Downey, John Kerr, G. L. Applegate and Sam Morrison. There was a tie between Applegate and Morrison - Applegate was chosen. The first school in Dravosburg was under the jurisdiction of Mifflin Twp. located on the river road later known as the Amity Hotel. In 1850 a small one room school was built at the foot of the hill on McClure Street. William Hull taught here as long as the building remained. In 1855 a two room school was built beside the one room building. Robert L. Riggs taught the upstairs room and Miss Lissie Corey, who later became Mrs. William Whitaker, taught the downstairs room. A small one room school stood at the mouth of Martins Hollow near the site of the German Lutheran Church that was moved when the P.V.C. RR came through in 1873. In 1891, a frame school was built on the hill at the present site of the Third Street Building but was destroyed by fire in 1905. Classes were held in the Richard's building and the German Lutheran Church until the brick building was built on Third Street. It was completed in 1907. In 1896 the Amity Academy was established as a private school with the McClain Brothers teaching. It was located on Washington Avenue near Second Street. During. World War II, the McCave School was built on the Weiskircher farm on the North Hill. It was named in honor of W. L. McCave who served many years on the school board.\n\nPrior to 1885 only private boats were available in Dravosburg. In 1862 packets were put in service. The first boat trip to Pittsburgh was called the Reece. The Reece also made trips to Elizabeth. It carried freight mail and passengers. The fare to Pittsburgh was $1.00 one was. The ferry boats Tillie, Jac Gumbert and H. B. Sinclair were used to ferry people to McKeesport. When the Dravosburg Bridge over the Monongahela and the Third Street Bridge over the Youghiogheny were built, the ferry boats were taken out of service.\n\nThe first attempt at Christian work in this locality was the organization of a Union Sunday School in the early 1850's. In 1860, S. S. Crump took charge and continued the work for two years. In 1866, Levi Risher reorganized the school which became the corner stone of the present Presbyterian Church. Mr. Risher left in 1869. The Pastors of the First Presbyterian Church in McKeesport and of the Lebanon Church carried on the work. In 1870, Mrs. J. C. Risher built the first Presbyterian Church located on Washington Avenue. It was dedicated March 26, 1871 and was deeded to the Pittsburgh Presbytery on August 4, 1886. On April 1, 1891, it was deeded to the congregation known as Amity Presbyterian. Rev. Schriver of Lebanon Church conducted services. In 1874, the congregation effected a church body with 29 charter members. In May, 1877, Rev. Levi Risher was installed as a regular pastor. The church now had 110 members and 140 in the Sunday School. Rev. Risher continued as pastor for four years. Rev. Cyrus B. Hatch was the next minister, serving from 1885 to 1891. Rev. John Waddel served from 1892 to 1896. Rev. W. S. McKee served from 1896 to 1905. In 1902, work was started on the parsonage located at the corner of Mound Avenue and Raymond St. Rev. N. N. Rodgers served from 1905 to 1910. Rev. T. R. Turner served from 1910 to 1917. During Rev. Tuner's term, lots where the Church now stands, were purchased. Rev. T. R. Lewis served from 1917 to 1921. Rev. J. M. Cox, while still a student, came January 22, 1922 and was installed June 21, 1922. Work started on the new Church August, l924. The Sunday School room was the only one planned at this time. Rev. Cox left in 1928. Rev. John S. Vance served from 1828 to 1929.\n\nOn October 6, 1901, the Sunday School of the First Christian Church met and organized in the public school building. The Rev. J. A. Joyce of McKeesport presided. A new church was built on a site donated by S. S. Crump at the comer of Duquesne Ave. and Raymond St. The building was completed in 1902. The first service was January 18, 1902.\n\nWhen the Pittsburgh Virginia and Charleston R.R. came through town in 1873, an old Lutheran Church stood at the mouth of Martins Hollow. The railroad had to go into court for permission to purchase the land because it was gift from John F. Dravo When the property was sold another site had to be bought. The Site of the St. John's s Lutheran Church was chosen. The congregation also owned a burial ground on the North Hill on Duquesne Ave.\n\nThe Methodist Church was organized October 31, 1889. Rev. Marshall B. Lytle held services in the German Lutheran Church building now known as St. John's Lutheran Church on Fifth Street until early summer of 1900. In the meantime, a Tabernacle was built at the corner of Third Street and Euclid Ave., later the home of James Cothery, Sr. The Methodist Church was built across the street and completed June 22, 1902 and was dedicated by Bishop J. W. Hamilton of' Pittsburgh.\n\nJ. C. Risher laid out the plan of Amity about 1851. The leaders of the community campaigned for a Post Office. They wanted Amity to be the name of the new Post Office but was rejected because there was a town by that name in Washington County. The name Dravosburg was chosen in honor of John F. Dravo. The population in 1875 was 1900. John F. Dravo was the first Postmaster. Those that followed were W H. Crump, Peter Ables, T. D. Watkins, Dr. F. F. Sumney, E. McBride, H. Seilers, John Brown, F. Downey, E. H. S. E. Rogerson, F. A. Meehan,J. N. Nicols, Robert J. Creely, and John R. Palcsey.\n\nThe Dravosburg bridge was built 1889 - 1890 at a cost of $110,000.00. The Mansfield Bridge cost $8,.000,000.00. Street cars came to Dravosburg in 1890 but the tracks ended on McClure Street at the PVC RR Crossing. Patrons got off the cars and walked a long flight of stairs and boarded a car for Pittsburgh. The viaduct was built in 1897.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usacitiesonline.com/pacountydravosburghistory.htm|title=history of Dravosburg, Pennsylvania|website=www.usacitiesonline.com|access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nDravosburg is located at {{coord|40|21|1|N|79|53|22|W|region:US_type:city}} (40.350219, -79.889391).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|1.1|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|1.0|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi}}, or 9.73%, is water.\n\nDravosburg is bounded on the north, west and south by [[West Mifflin, Pennsylvania|West Mifflin]].

The first settler was John Gray also known as George Gray. Prior to that time, an early deed was recorded of this section as far as Hays, known then as Six Mile Ferry. This section was granted to John Gray by John and Thomas Penn, sons of William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania. The original deed is in the hands of the C. L. Whitaker family of Dravosburg.\n\nThe property, formerly known as Mt. Gray, 18 remembered as the Cunningham farm, a heritage of the Gray family. The first home of the Cunningham family was a two room log house overlooking the River, built in 1851& and known as Amity Settlement arid later was the home of Conrad Goldstrom. The second home of the Cunningham family is now Airways Tavern at the junction of the Lebanon Church Road and the Pittsburgh-McKeesport Boulevard. The Jabez Grooms Family lived in this house and farm for many years. The civil War halted further building on the hill as many of the young men were in the service.\n\nIn 1789, the land where Richland Cemetery is located was deeded to Conrad Latterbock. The land extended back as far as the property now known as Curry Hollow. The cemetery section was used as a private burial place and was known by two names - Richland and Coventry. In 1837 this land was deeded to the Curry family and known as the Curry Place. Part of this land is still known as Curry Hollow. The Curry home was a log house located near the Junction of the Elizabeth Road and Washington Avenue.\n\nDravosburg, a part of Mifflin Township, was incorporated into a March 31, 1903. The first Burgess was Stephen Crump elected May 6, 1903. The first councilmen who held the first meeting in the Risher Real Estate Office, located at the site of the Richards Building, were V. C. McCune, J. D. Myers, E. E. Chester, Charles Corey, C. L Stoops, John Ord and Harvey Berger. Mr. McCune was elected President of Council. Mr. Berger was ill when the first meeting was held and died two days later. This meeting was held May 11, 1903.\n\nThe first order of business after organization was to hire a policeman, who also served as street commissioner, buy a revolver, a mace, two pairs of handcuffs and order a lockup built. It was ready June 7, l904. This building located across the tracks from the P.R.R. Station still stands but has net been used as a Jail for a few years.\n\nSince the first mine was opened in 1835, a great change has taken place. From a small group of homes centered around the mine, the town grew into a flourishing residential community. If, in 1903, Dravosburg was a quiet, peaceful community, why the revolver, mace, handcuffs and a lockup built?\n\nDravosburg started with the opening of a coal mine at the extreme north end of town by William and John Cunningham in 1835 and continued to operate until 1856 when it was sold to Mr. William Stone. Mr. Stone operated the mine until his death. It was then taken over by his heirs and operated until it was worked out. The area was known as Stonesburg.\n\nOn March 22, 1856, Mr. Whigham hauled coal across the river to McKeesport. The ice was four feet thick. In 1840 the Dravo mine was opened by James O'Neil. Mr. O'Neil operated the mine until 1851. It was then sold to Michael Dravo and sons. Six beehive coke ovens were built. The slack from the mine was used in the manufacture of coke. The coke was shipped by river to southern markets.\n\nIn 1809, the mine and coke ovens were sold to J. C. Risher by John P. Dravo. A third mine known as the Amity mine was opened in 1851 by J. C. Risher. Mr. Risher leased the mine to Daniel Bushmiller who operated it until 1859. It vas then taken back by the Rishers. Mr. Risher operated the mine until his death in 1889. The mine was then taken over by S. S. Crump and was then known as the Risher mine. It continued to operate until 1900, when it was sold to the Pittsburgh Coal Company. They shipped coal by rail and river until the mine was worked out.\n\nAs early as 1865, there were two saw mills in Dravosburg. One was owned and operated by William McCleary who sold the mill in 1880 to Alva Gulp. Mr. McCleary stayed on and under his supervision, the mill did a thriving business. Mr. Culp owned the mill only two years when his hand was amputated by a saw he was operating. Mr. Culp also owned a boat yard, but lost all interest in the work and the mill was abandoned. The machinery was sold, but the buildings stood until they were destroyed in the 1936 flood. The mill was located about 300 yards south of the Stone's Coal Tipple.\n\nThe Risher mill was in the upper part of town and was a boat yard and dock. In 1900 W. C. McCune purchased the holdings and operated it until his death in 1918. It was then bought by the Hillman Coal Company and was used as a landing and boat yard until April, 1951, when they moved to Elicia, Pennsylvania. The Ohio Barge Line is now using the river front as a landing.\n\nWhen Dravosburg incorporated as a Borough, a school board was needed. On May 6, 1903, five directors were elected. They were Dr. A. H. Aber, Dr. F. F. Sumney, Charles Downey, John Kerr, G. L. Applegate and Sam Morrison. There was a tie between Applegate and Morrison - Applegate was chosen. The first school in Dravosburg was under the jurisdiction of Mifflin Twp. located on the river road later known as the Amity Hotel. In 1850 a small one room school was built at the foot of the hill on McClure Street. William Hull taught here as long as the building remained. In 1855 a two room school was built beside the one room building. Robert L. Riggs taught the upstairs room and Miss Lissie Corey, who later became Mrs. William Whitaker, taught the downstairs room. A small one room school stood at the mouth of Martins Hollow near the site of the German Lutheran Church that was moved when the P.V.C. RR came through in 1873. In 1891, a frame school was built on the hill at the present site of the Third Street Building but was destroyed by fire in 1905. Classes were held in the Richard's building and the German Lutheran Church until the brick building was built on Third Street. It was completed in 1907. In 1896 the Amity Academy was established as a private school with the McClain Brothers teaching. It was located on Washington Avenue near Second Street. During. World War II, the McCave School was built on the Weiskircher farm on the North Hill. It was named in honor of W. L. McCave who served many years on the school board.\n\nPrior to 1885 only private boats were available in Dravosburg. In 1862 packets were put in service. The first boat trip to Pittsburgh was called the Reece. The Reece also made trips to Elizabeth. It carried freight mail and passengers. The fare to Pittsburgh was $1.00 one was. The ferry boats Tillie, Jac Gumbert and H. B. Sinclair were used to ferry people to McKeesport. When the Dravosburg Bridge over the Monongahela and the Third Street Bridge over the Youghiogheny were built, the ferry boats were taken out of service.\n\nThe first attempt at Christian work in this locality was the organization of a Union Sunday School in the early 1850's. In 1860, S. S. Crump took charge and continued the work for two years. In 1866, Levi Risher reorganized the school which became the corner stone of the present Presbyterian Church. Mr. Risher left in 1869. The Pastors of the First Presbyterian Church in McKeesport and of the Lebanon Church carried on the work. In 1870, Mrs. J. C. Risher built the first Presbyterian Church located on Washington Avenue. It was dedicated March 26, 1871 and was deeded to the Pittsburgh Presbytery on August 4, 1886. On April 1, 1891, it was deeded to the congregation known as Amity Presbyterian. Rev. Schriver of Lebanon Church conducted services. In 1874, the congregation effected a church body with 29 charter members. In May, 1877, Rev. Levi Risher was installed as a regular pastor. The church now had 110 members and 140 in the Sunday School. Rev. Risher continued as pastor for four years. Rev. Cyrus B. Hatch was the next minister, serving from 1885 to 1891. Rev. John Waddel served from 1892 to 1896. Rev. W. S. McKee served from 1896 to 1905. In 1902, work was started on the parsonage located at the corner of Mound Avenue and Raymond St. Rev. N. N. Rodgers served from 1905 to 1910. Rev. T. R. Turner served from 1910 to 1917. During Rev. Tuner's term, lots where the Church now stands, were purchased. Rev. T. R. Lewis served from 1917 to 1921. Rev. J. M. Cox, while still a student, came January 22, 1922 and was installed June 21, 1922. Work started on the new Church August, l924. The Sunday School room was the only one planned at this time. Rev. Cox left in 1928. Rev. John S. Vance served from 1828 to 1929.\n\nOn October 6, 1901, the Sunday School of the First Christian Church met and organized in the public school building. The Rev. J. A. Joyce of McKeesport presided. A new church was built on a site donated by S. S. Crump at the comer of Duquesne Ave. and Raymond St. The building was completed in 1902. The first service was January 18, 1902.\n\nWhen the Pittsburgh Virginia and Charleston R.R. came through town in 1873, an old Lutheran Church stood at the mouth of Martins Hollow. The railroad had to go into court for permission to purchase the land because it was gift from John F. Dravo When the property was sold another site had to be bought. The Site of the St. John's s Lutheran Church was chosen. The congregation also owned a burial ground on the North Hill on Duquesne Ave.\n\nThe Methodist Church was organized October 31, 1889. Rev. Marshall B. Lytle held services in the German Lutheran Church building now known as St. John's Lutheran Church on Fifth Street until early summer of 1900. In the meantime, a Tabernacle was built at the corner of Third Street and Euclid Ave., later the home of James Cothery, Sr. The Methodist Church was built across the street and completed June 22, 1902 and was dedicated by Bishop J. W. Hamilton of' Pittsburgh.\n\nJ. C. Risher laid out the plan of Amity about 1851. The leaders of the community campaigned for a Post Office. They wanted Amity to be the name of the new Post Office but was rejected because there was a town by that name in Washington County. The name Dravosburg was chosen in honor of John F. Dravo. The population in 1875 was 1900. John F. Dravo was the first Postmaster. Those that followed were W H. Crump, Peter Ables, T. D. Watkins, Dr. F. F. Sumney, E. McBride, H. Seilers, John Brown, F. Downey, E. H. S. E. Rogerson, F. A. Meehan,J. N. Nicols, Robert J. Creely, and John R. Palcsey.\n\nThe Dravosburg bridge was built 1889 - 1890 at a cost of $110,000.00. The Mansfield Bridge cost $8,.000,000.00. Street cars came to Dravosburg in 1890 but the tracks ended on McClure Street at the PVC RR Crossing. Patrons got off the cars and walked a long flight of stairs and boarded a car for Pittsburgh. The viaduct was built in 1897.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usacitiesonline.com/pacountydravosburghistory.htm|title=history of Dravosburg, Pennsylvania|website=www.usacitiesonline.com|access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nDravosburg is located at {{coord|40|21|1|N|79|53|22|W|region:US_type:city}} (40.350219, -79.889391).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|1.1|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|1.0|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi}}, or 9.73%, is water.\n\nDravosburg is bounded on the north, west and south by [[West Mifflin, Pennsylvania|West Mifflin]].

Known for years as \"William Doyle's Tavern,\" its strategic location, at the intersection of the road (now [[U.S. Route 202]]) linking Swede's Ford ([[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]]) and Coryell's Ferry ([[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]]) and the road (now [[Pennsylvania State Highway 611|PA Route 611]]) linking [[Philadelphia]] and [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]], allowed the hamlet to blossom into a village. The first church was erected in 1815, followed by a succession of congregations throughout the 19th century.<ref name=\"PlaceNamesDoylestown\">MacReynolds, George, ''Place Names in Bucks County, Pennsylvania'', Doylestown, Bucks County Historical Society, Doylestown, PA, 1942, Doylestown Borough.</ref>\n\nA second inn, the ''Sign of the Ship'' was established in 1774 built diagonally across from the Doyle Tavern, Samuel Flack was innkeeper in 1778.<ref name=\"PlaceNamesDoylestown\"/>\n\n[[File:Fountain House 2010.JPG|thumb|left|The Fountain House (Doylestown, Pennsylvania)|Fountain House]]The Fountain House, at the corner of State and Main Streets, was built in 1758 and is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nAs the population of Central and Upper Bucks County grew throughout the 18th and into the 19th century, discontent developed with the county seat's location in [[Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Newtown]], where it had been since 1725. Eight petitions with a total of 184 signers were submitted to the General Assembly, some as early as 1784 requesting to move the county seat to Doylestown. Among the signers were Andrew Armstrong, John Armstrong, John Davis, Andrew Denison, Jesse Fell, Joseph Fell, John Ingham (of Ingham Springs), Michael Frederick Kolb, Zebulon M. Pike (of Lumberton), Samuel Preston, Robert Shewell, Walter Shewell, and Fulkerd Sebring.<ref name=\"PlaceNamesDoylestown\"/> The General Assembly approved the move by an Act on February 28, 1810, the first Court session was opened on May 11, 1813. An outgrowth of Doylestown's new courthouse was the development of \"lawyers row\", a collection of [[Federal architecture|Federal-style]] offices. One positive consequence of early 19th-century investment in the new county seat was organized fire protection, which began in 1825 with the Doylestown Fire Engine Company.\n\nA post office was established on January 1, 1802, Charles Stewart was the first postmaster, who carried letters to recipients in the bell-shaped crown of his high beaver hat as he walked about the village. When Stewart died on February 7, 1804, his son-in-law Enoch Harvey became the next postmaster. On October 9, 1804 Harvey advertised in the ''Pennsylvania Correspondent'', published in Doylestown, of a list of letters remaining in the post office for Wm. R. Hanna, Esq., Newtown; Doct. Felix Robertson, Bucks County; Robert Wehir, Shamony, Bucks County; Robert A. Farmer, Esq., Birdsborough; Israel Childs, Buckingham.<ref name=\"PlaceNamesDoylestown\"/>\n\nA bill to erect Doylestown into a borough was introduced into Legislature in February 1830, but failed, as well as a second attempt in the session of 1832. \"An Act to erect the Village of Doylestown, in the County of Bucks, into a Borough\" was passed and signed into law by Governor [[Joseph Ritner]] on April 16, 1838.<ref name=\"PlaceNamesDoylestown\"/>\n\n[[File:Bucks Courthouse.JPG|thumb|left|Bucks County Courthouse]]\nAn electric telegraph station was built in 1846, and the [[North Pennsylvania Railroad]] completed a branch to Doylestown in 1856. The first gas lights were introduced in 1854. Because of the town's relatively high elevation and a lack of strong water power, substantial industrial development never occurred and Doylestown evolved to have a professional and residential character.<ref name=\"PlaceNamesDoylestown\"/>\n\n[[File:Pugh Dungan Hs BucksCo PA.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pugh Dungan House]]]]\nDuring the mid-19th century, several large tracts located east of the courthouse area were subdivided into neighborhoods. The next significant wave of development occurred after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when the {{convert|30|acre|ha|adj=on}} Magill property to the southwest of the town's core was subdivided for residential lots.\n\nIn 1869 Doylestown established a water works. The first telephone line arrived in 1878, the same year that a new courthouse was erected.  1897 saw the first of several trolley lines connecting Doylestown with [[Willow Grove, Pennsylvania|Willow Grove]], Newtown and Easton. A private sewer system and treatment plant were authorized in 1903. The Borough took over and expanded sewer service to about three-quarters of the town in 1921.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Doylestown became best known to the outside world through the \"Tools of the Nation-Maker\" museum of the [[Bucks County Historical Society]]. [[Henry Chapman Mercer]] constructed the reinforced concrete building in 1916 to house his collection of mechanical tools and utensils. Upon his death in 1930, Mercer also left his similarly constructed home [[Fonthill (house)|Fonthill]] and adjacent [[Moravian Pottery and Tile Works]], to be operated as a museum. The home was left on the condition that his housekeeper be allowed to live there for the rest of her life. She lived there and gave tours until the mid-1970s.\n\nIn 1916, Doylestown Country Club was established and still operates a private golf course and caddy program.<ref>http://www.doylestowncountryclub.com</ref>\n\n[[File:County Cinema Dtown.JPG|thumb|left|The County Theater in the [[Doylestown Historic District]]]]\nBy 1931, the advent of the automobile and improved highway service had put the last trolley line out of business as Doylestonians used the automobile as the primary means of travel within the region. The Great Depression took its toll, as many grand old houses constructed a century earlier fell into disrepair. During the 1930s, the Borough also expanded its land area to the north by admission of the tract known as the Doylestown Annex.\n\nIn the decade following World War II, Doylestown's business community boomed. During the 1940s, streets were paved for the first time in two decades and parking meters were introduced downtown in 1948. However, the postwar housing boom did not begin in earnest until the 1950s, when 550 new homes were built. The housing boom continued into the 1960s and 1970s, as more than 1,600 new homes were built during those decades and the Borough's population grew from 5,917 in 1960 to 8,717 in 1980.\n\nAs with many small towns across the country, the growth of the postwar decades also brought a new competitor to the downtown business district, the shopping mall. By the 1960s, the toll could be seen in Doylestown by the numerous vacant buildings and dilapidated storefronts in the center of town. The Bucks County Redevelopment Authority responded with a federal urban renewal scheme that called for the demolition of 27 historic buildings. The local business community objected to such wholesale clearance and responded with its own plan called Operation '64, the Doylestown Plan for Self-Help Downtown Renewal. This private initiative was successful in saving Doylestown's old buildings and historic character, while improving business at the same time. One historic landmark that could not be saved was the 80-year-old courthouse and clock tower, which was replaced by the present county complex in the early 1960s.\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, the downtown business district was again showing the toll of massive new competition from the latest wave of suburban shopping centers, as well as the recession that hit hardest in the northeastern states. In response, the Borough Council established a volunteer group of civic-minded representatives from business organizations, government, and the residential community to begin formulating plans for the downtown area in 1992. This effort resulted in streetscape improvements composed of cast iron street lamps and brick pavers, facade improvements and other beautification efforts, and the establishment of a Main Street Manager Program.\n\n[[File:Main Street NB approaching Court Street Doylestown.jpg|thumb|right|Main Street]]\nAs the 1990s progressed, the downtown area rebuilt itself largely by turning to an out-of-town audience. Doylestown had long been respected as a bucolic tourist destination. The gentry of Philadelphia and New York, including figures of the Manhattan theater and literary scenes, maintained country estates in the area and often summered there. The Mercer Museum, Moravian Pottery and Tile Works, and the local [[National Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa]] brought a regular stream of short-term visitors through the area as well. With charitable support, the [[art deco]] County Theater was restored and reopened showing art-house fare, and a new main library and art museum were built around the ruins of the old stone jail, across the street from the Mercer Museum. An official \"resort town\" designation exempted the area from liquor license caps,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} and empty commercial space began to fill with a dense and vibrant nighttime scene of bars and restaurants.\n\nThis development goes hand in hand with the broader development of the region. As the Philadelphia metropolitan area expanded from southern into central Bucks County, the fields and farms of the communities around Doylestown quickly began to sprout housing developments. This development brought thousands of people to the area, but the neighborhoods created often lacked longstanding institutions or discernible centers. Doylestown, more centrally located than Delaware River border town of [[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]], which had traditionally served this function, was able to position itself as the regional center of culture and nightlife.\n\nArchival collection and community programming are two functions of the Doylestown Historical Society, established in 1995, whose mission is \"to commemorate and preserve the history of Doylestown so that its people, places and events may long be remembered.\"\n\nThe [[Doylestown Historic District]], [[Pugh Dungan House]], [[Fonthill (house)|Fonthill]], [[The Fountain House (Doylestown, Pennsylvania)|Fountain House]], [[Oscar Hammerstein II Farm]], [[James-Lorah House]], [[Mercer Museum]], [[Moravian Pottery and Tile Works]], and [[Shaw Historic District, Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Shaw Historic District]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|2.2|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\nDoylestown Borough is bordered by [[Doylestown Township]] except to the northeast where it borders [[Buckingham Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Buckingham Township]].\n\nNatural features of Doylestown Borough include Cooks Run and [[Neshaminy Creek]].<ref name=\"MacReynolds\">MacReynolds, George, ''Place Names in Bucks County, Pennsylvania'', Doylestown, Bucks County Historical Society, Doylestown, PA, 1942.</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 627\n|1850= 1006\n|1860= 1432\n|1870= 1601\n|1880= 2070\n|1890= 1733\n|1900= 1764\n|1910= 1854\n|1920= 1369\n|1930= 1371\n|1940= 4976\n|1950= 5262\n|1960= 5917\n|1970= 8270\n|1980= 8717\n|1990= 8575\n|2000= 8227\n|2010= 8380\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=8297\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=January 31, 2008|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=December 11, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HQu4Spqa?url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=June 17, 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the 2010 census, the borough was 94.8% Non-Hispanic White, 2.3% Black or African American, 0.2% Native American, 1.9% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, and 1.5% were two or more races. 2.8% of the population were of Hispanic or Latino ancestry [https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/census/profile/PA].\n\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 8,227 people, 3,952 households, and 1,908 families residing in the borough.

is a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]] in the U.S. state of [[Pennsylvania]]. It is located 15 miles (24 km) northwest of [[Trenton, NJ]], 25 miles (40 km) south of [[Easton, PA]], {{convert|25|mi|km}} north of Center City [[Philadelphia]] and {{convert|65|mi|km}} southwest of [[New York City]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the borough population was 8,380.<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |accessdate=June 7, 2011 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archivedate=May 31, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nLike most of the region, the area of what is now Doylestown was inhabited by the [[Lenape]] people until the arrival of the Europeans.\n\nDoylestown's origins date to March 1745 when William Doyle obtained a license to build a tavern on what is now the northwest corner of Dyers Road and Coryell's Ferry Road (now Main and State Streets). Known for years as \"William Doyle's Tavern,\" its strategic location, at the intersection of the road (now [[U.S. Route 202]]) linking Swede's Ford ([[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]]) and Coryell's Ferry ([[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]]) and the road (now [[Pennsylvania State Highway 611|PA Route 611]]) linking [[Philadelphia]] and [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]], allowed the hamlet to blossom into a village. The first church was erected in 1815, followed by a succession of congregations throughout the 19th century.<ref name=\"PlaceNamesDoylestown\">MacReynolds, George, ''Place Names in Bucks County, Pennsylvania'', Doylestown, Bucks County Historical Society, Doylestown, PA, 1942, Doylestown Borough.</ref>\n\nA second inn, the ''Sign of the Ship'' was established in 1774 built diagonally across from the Doyle Tavern, Samuel Flack was innkeeper in 1778.<ref name=\"PlaceNamesDoylestown\"/>\n\n[[File:Fountain House 2010.JPG|thumb|left|The Fountain House (Doylestown, Pennsylvania)|Fountain House]]The Fountain House, at the corner of State and Main Streets, was built in 1758 and is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nAs the population of Central and Upper Bucks County grew throughout the 18th and into the 19th century, discontent developed with the county seat's location in [[Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Newtown]], where it had been since 1725. Eight petitions with a total of 184 signers were submitted to the General Assembly, some as early as 1784 requesting to move the county seat to Doylestown. Among the signers were Andrew Armstrong, John Armstrong, John Davis, Andrew Denison, Jesse Fell, Joseph Fell, John Ingham (of Ingham Springs), Michael Frederick Kolb, Zebulon M. Pike (of Lumberton), Samuel Preston, Robert Shewell, Walter Shewell, and Fulkerd Sebring.<ref name=\"PlaceNamesDoylestown\"/> The General Assembly approved the move by an Act on February 28, 1810, the first Court session was opened on May 11, 1813. An outgrowth of Doylestown's new courthouse was the development of \"lawyers row\", a collection of [[Federal architecture|Federal-style]] offices. One positive consequence of early 19th-century investment in the new county seat was organized fire protection, which began in 1825 with the Doylestown Fire Engine Company.\n\nA post office was established on January 1, 1802, Charles Stewart was the first postmaster, who carried letters to recipients in the bell-shaped crown of his high beaver hat as he walked about the village. When Stewart died on February 7, 1804, his son-in-law Enoch Harvey became the next postmaster. On October 9, 1804 Harvey advertised in the ''Pennsylvania Correspondent'', published in Doylestown, of a list of letters remaining in the post office for Wm. R. Hanna, Esq., Newtown; Doct. Felix Robertson, Bucks County; Robert Wehir, Shamony, Bucks County; Robert A. Farmer, Esq., Birdsborough; Israel Childs, Buckingham.<ref name=\"PlaceNamesDoylestown\"/>\n\nA bill to erect Doylestown into a borough was introduced into Legislature in February 1830, but failed, as well as a second attempt in the session of 1832. \"An Act to erect the Village of Doylestown, in the County of Bucks, into a Borough\" was passed and signed into law by Governor [[Joseph Ritner]] on April 16, 1838.<ref name=\"PlaceNamesDoylestown\"/>\n\n[[File:Bucks Courthouse.JPG|thumb|left|Bucks County Courthouse]]\nAn electric telegraph station was built in 1846, and the [[North Pennsylvania Railroad]] completed a branch to Doylestown in 1856. The first gas lights were introduced in 1854. Because of the town's relatively high elevation and a lack of strong water power, substantial industrial development never occurred and Doylestown evolved to have a professional and residential character.<ref name=\"PlaceNamesDoylestown\"/>\n\n[[File:Pugh Dungan Hs BucksCo PA.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pugh Dungan House]]]]\nDuring the mid-19th century, several large tracts located east of the courthouse area were subdivided into neighborhoods. The next significant wave of development occurred after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when the {{convert|30|acre|ha|adj=on}} Magill property to the southwest of the town's core was subdivided for residential lots.\n\nIn 1869 Doylestown established a water works. The first telephone line arrived in 1878, the same year that a new courthouse was erected.  1897 saw the first of several trolley lines connecting Doylestown with [[Willow Grove, Pennsylvania|Willow Grove]], Newtown and Easton. A private sewer system and treatment plant were authorized in 1903. The Borough took over and expanded sewer service to about three-quarters of the town in 1921.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Doylestown became best known to the outside world through the \"Tools of the Nation-Maker\" museum of the [[Bucks County Historical Society]]. [[Henry Chapman Mercer]] constructed the reinforced concrete building in 1916 to house his collection of mechanical tools and utensils. Upon his death in 1930, Mercer also left his similarly constructed home [[Fonthill (house)|Fonthill]] and adjacent [[Moravian Pottery and Tile Works]], to be operated as a museum. The home was left on the condition that his housekeeper be allowed to live there for the rest of her life. She lived there and gave tours until the mid-1970s.\n\nIn 1916, Doylestown Country Club was established and still operates a private golf course and caddy program.<ref>http://www.doylestowncountryclub.com</ref>\n\n[[File:County Cinema Dtown.JPG|thumb|left|The County Theater in the [[Doylestown Historic District]]]]\nBy 1931, the advent of the automobile and improved highway service had put the last trolley line out of business as Doylestonians used the automobile as the primary means of travel within the region. The Great Depression took its toll, as many grand old houses constructed a century earlier fell into disrepair. During the 1930s, the Borough also expanded its land area to the north by admission of the tract known as the Doylestown Annex.\n\nIn the decade following World War II, Doylestown's business community boomed. During the 1940s, streets were paved for the first time in two decades and parking meters were introduced downtown in 1948. However, the postwar housing boom did not begin in earnest until the 1950s, when 550 new homes were built. The housing boom continued into the 1960s and 1970s, as more than 1,600 new homes were built during those decades and the Borough's population grew from 5,917 in 1960 to 8,717 in 1980.\n\nAs with many small towns across the country, the growth of the postwar decades also brought a new competitor to the downtown business district, the shopping mall. By the 1960s, the toll could be seen in Doylestown by the numerous vacant buildings and dilapidated storefronts in the center of town. The Bucks County Redevelopment Authority responded with a federal urban renewal scheme that called for the demolition of 27 historic buildings. The local business community objected to such wholesale clearance and responded with its own plan called Operation '64, the Doylestown Plan for Self-Help Downtown Renewal. This private initiative was successful in saving Doylestown's old buildings and historic character, while improving business at the same time. One historic landmark that could not be saved was the 80-year-old courthouse and clock tower, which was replaced by the present county complex in the early 1960s.\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, the downtown business district was again showing the toll of massive new competition from the latest wave of suburban shopping centers, as well as the recession that hit hardest in the northeastern states. In response, the Borough Council established a volunteer group of civic-minded representatives from business organizations, government, and the residential community to begin formulating plans for the downtown area in 1992. This effort resulted in streetscape improvements composed of cast iron street lamps and brick pavers, facade improvements and other beautification efforts, and the establishment of a Main Street Manager Program.\n\n[[File:Main Street NB approaching Court Street Doylestown.jpg|thumb|right|Main Street]]\nAs the 1990s progressed, the downtown area rebuilt itself largely by turning to an out-of-town audience. Doylestown had long been respected as a bucolic tourist destination. The gentry of Philadelphia and New York, including figures of the Manhattan theater and literary scenes, maintained country estates in the area and often summered there. The Mercer Museum, Moravian Pottery and Tile Works, and the local [[National Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa]] brought a regular stream of short-term visitors through the area as well. With charitable support, the [[art deco]] County Theater was restored and reopened showing art-house fare, and a new main library and art museum were built around the ruins of the old stone jail, across the street from the Mercer Museum. An official \"resort town\" designation exempted the area from liquor license caps,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} and empty commercial space began to fill with a dense and vibrant nighttime scene of bars and restaurants.\n\nThis development goes hand in hand with the broader development of the region. As the Philadelphia metropolitan area expanded from southern into central Bucks County, the fields and farms of the communities around Doylestown quickly began to sprout housing developments. This development brought thousands of people to the area, but the neighborhoods created often lacked longstanding institutions or discernible centers. Doylestown, more centrally located than Delaware River border town of [[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]], which had traditionally served this function, was able to position itself as the regional center of culture and nightlife.\n\nArchival collection and community programming are two functions of the Doylestown Historical Society, established in 1995, whose mission is \"to commemorate and preserve the history of Doylestown so that its people, places and events may long be remembered.\"\n\nThe [[Doylestown Historic District]], [[Pugh Dungan House]], [[Fonthill (house)|Fonthill]], [[The Fountain House (Doylestown, Pennsylvania)|Fountain House]], [[Oscar Hammerstein II Farm]], [[James-Lorah House]], [[Mercer Museum]], [[Moravian Pottery and Tile Works]], and [[Shaw Historic District, Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Shaw Historic District]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|2.2|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\nDoylestown Borough is bordered by [[Doylestown Township]] except to the northeast where it borders [[Buckingham Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Buckingham Township]].\n\nNatural features of Doylestown Borough include Cooks Run and [[Neshaminy Creek]].<ref name=\"MacReynolds\">MacReynolds, George, ''Place Names in Bucks County, Pennsylvania'', Doylestown, Bucks County Historical Society, Doylestown, PA, 1942.</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 627\n|1850= 1006\n|1860= 1432\n|1870= 1601\n|1880= 2070\n|1890= 1733\n|1900= 1764\n|1910= 1854\n|1920= 1369\n|1930= 1371\n|1940= 4976\n|1950= 5262\n|1960= 5917\n|1970= 8270\n|1980= 8717\n|1990= 8575\n|2000= 8227\n|2010= 8380\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=8297\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=January 31, 2008|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=December 11, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HQu4Spqa?url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=June 17, 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the 2010 census, the borough was 94.8% Non-Hispanic White, 2.3% Black or African American, 0.2% Native American, 1.9% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, and 1.5% were two or more races. 2.8% of the population were of Hispanic or Latino ancestry [https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/census/profile/PA].\n\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 8,227 people, 3,952 households, and 1,908 families residing in the borough.

The district was built in 1905 by various architects. It was designated a [[Chicago Landmark]] on October 25, 1989. It is often regarded as one of three [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] upper-middle to upper-class neighborhoods, the other two being [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] / [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]] to the direct north and the sister communities of [[Beverly, Chicago|Beverly]] / [[Morgan Park, Chicago|Morgan Park]], on the far southwest side.\n\n==Boundaries==\nThe neighborhood is roughly bounded by 67th Street to the north, 71st Street to the south, [[DeWitt Clinton Cregier|Cregier]] Avenue to the west, and Jeffery Boulevard to the east. Directly north of the neighborhood lies the 18-hole Jackson Park Golf Course, a part of the Chicago Park District's [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]], the third largest park in the city and home of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]], 1893.

Its initial purpose was as a collection of model homes that would overlook the prized [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]], which had hosted the World's Fair less than a decade prior. The neighborhood featured (and is still present) some of the most innovative concepts of the time, including large front yard setbacks, 50-foot lot widths, underground utilities, and no alleys. When Chicago annexed Hyde Park just in time for the 1890 census (to beat out [[Philadelphia]] as the second largest metro-area in the nation), the Highlands were left under governorship of the South Shore area.\n\nAt the time of [[World War II]], the neighborhood saw huge loss in residence and a destruction of the area was suggested. With the arrival of the 1970s, the neighborhood again began to rise as a major thoroughfare of South Side luxury. It was designated a [[Chicago Landmark]] on October 25, 1989.

House prices now range from about $300,000 to $1.5 million.\n\n==Notable residents==\nNotable residents have included members of the [[Whitehall]] Family, [[Jesse Jackson]], [[Ramsey Lewis]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Gale Sayers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/J/JacksonPark.html|title=Jackson Park Highlands District|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|year=2003|accessdate=2007-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607152004/http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/J/JacksonPark.html|archive-date=2007-06-07|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Landmark Designation 1989-10-25\">{{cite web|last=McLenahan|first=William|title=Designation of Jackson Park Highlands District as Chicago Landmark|date=October 25, 1989|accessdate=November 29, 2019|work=Chicago City Council Journal of Proceedings|pages=5929-5934|url=https://chicityclerk.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/document_uploads/journals-proceedings/1989/102589_optimize.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Chicago Landmark districts}}\n{{Neighborhoods in Chicago}}\n{{Chicago}}\n\n{{coord|41.770|-87.579|type:landmark_region:US-IL|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Neighborhoods in Chicago]]\n[[Category:South Side, Chicago]]\n[[Category:Historic districts in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1905]]\n[[Category:1905 establishments in Illinois]]\n\n\n{{Chicago-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Hmains", "label": "safe", "comment": "category refine, sort sequence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Park_Highlands_District"}
