After graduating from high school in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Juan Rico|John \"Johnny\" Rico]], his girlfriend Carmen Iba\u00f1ez, and [[psychic]] best friend Carl Jenkins enlist in the Federal Service, despite Rico's parents' disapproval of military service. Carmen becomes a spaceship pilot, while Carl joins [[Military Intelligence]]. Rico enlists in the Mobile Infantry and is surprised to find Isabelle \"Dizzy\" Flores, his fellow ex-student, has deliberately transferred to his squad.\n\nIn Mobile Infantry basic training, Career Sgt Zim ruthlessly trains the recruits. Rico befriends fellow cadet Ace Levy and is later promoted to squad leader. He subsequently receives a [[Dear John letter]] from Carmen, as she desires a career with the fleet and now serves under Rico's high-school sports rival, Zander Barcalow. Following a [[Live fire exercise|live-fire training]] incident that kills one of Rico's squad members and causes another to quit out of guilt, Rico is demoted and [[Flagellation|flogged]]. He resigns and calls his parents to ask them if he can return home, but rescinds his resignation after an asteroid, reported to be launched by the Arachnids, obliterates Buenos Aires, killing his mother and millions of others.\n\nAn invasion force is deployed to [[Klendathu]], the Arachnids' home planet, but the operation severely underestimates the Arachnids and is a total disaster. Rico is severely wounded and mistakenly reported [[killed in action|KIA]]. After recovering, he, Ace, and Dizzy are reassigned to the \"Roughnecks\", an [[Special forces|elite unit]] commanded by Lt. Jean Rasczak, Rico's former high-school teacher. He quickly gains the respect of his peers and is promoted to the rank of Corporal after taking out a tanker bug. His relationship with Dizzy continues to grow, and they have sex during their night on Tango Urilla.\n\nThe Roughnecks respond to a distress call from Planet \"P\", where they reconnoiter an outpost that has been devastated by Bugs. They soon realize that the distress call is a trap, and the Arachnids swarm the outpost. Rico, now an acting sergeant, euthanizes a mortally wounded Rasczak after a buried Bug bites off his legs. Dizzy is killed, but the surviving Roughnecks are rescued by Carmen and Zander. Rico and Carmen encounter Carl, now a high-ranking intelligence officer, at Dizzy's funeral. Carl reveals that there is reason to believe an intelligent \"brain bug\" is directing the other Bugs and has been learning how to fight humans. He [[Battlefield promotion|field-promotes]] Rico to lieutenant and gives him command of the Roughnecks, ordering the Mobile Infantry units under his control to return to \"P\" in an attempt to capture the brain bug.\n\nThe Fleet encounters unexpected heavy fire from the Bugs and Carmen's ship is destroyed. Carmen and Zander's escape pod crashes into a Bug tunnel system near Rico. They are surrounded by Bugs and a brain bug uses its [[proboscis]] to pierce Zander's skull and eat his brain. As it is about to do the same to Carmen, she cuts off its proboscis with a knife. Rico, Watkins and Ace arrive and threaten the Bugs with a small [[Tactical nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]], which the brain bug recognizes. They flee while the brain bug makes its escape. Arachnids pursue them and Watkins, mortally wounded, sacrifices himself by detonating the bomb to enable the others to escape.\n\nAfter returning to the surface, they find that former Sergeant Zim, who had requested a demotion to private so that he could serve at the front, has captured the brain bug. Carl tells Rico and Carmen that the humans will soon be victorious now that Military Intelligence can study the brain bug. Carl mentally scans the Bug and reveals that it is afraid, to the cheers of the troops. A [[propaganda]] clip shows Carmen, Ace, and Rico as model servicemen, encouraging viewers to enlist in the armed forces.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Casper Van Dien]] as [[John Rico|Pvt./Cpl./Sgt./Lt.

[[Paul Verhoeven]] had never read the book, and attempted to read it for the film, but it made him \"bored and depressed\", so he read only a few chapters:\n\n<blockquote>I stopped after two chapters because it was so boring \u2026 It is really quite a bad book. I asked [[Edward Neumeier|Ed Neumeier]] to tell me the story because I just couldn't read the thing. It's a very right-wing book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/paul-verhoeven/|title=Triple Dutch: Paul Verhoeven's sci-fi trilogy|last1=Smith|first1=Adam|last2=Williams|first2=Owen|date=February 12, 2015|website=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|url-status=dead|accessdate=December 7, 2016|quote=I stopped after two chapters because it was so boring,\" says Verhoeven of his attempts to read Heinlein's opus. \"It is really quite a bad book. I asked Ed Neumeier to tell me the story because I just couldn't read the thing. It's a very right-wing book. And with the movie we tried, and I think at least partially succeeded, in commenting on that at the same time. It would be eat your cake and have it. All the way through we were fighting with the fascism, the ultra-militarism. All the way through I wanted the audience to be asking, 'Are these people crazy?'}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=October 2019}}</blockquote>\n\nNeumeier had previously worked with Verhoeven as a writer on ''[[RoboCop|Robocop]]'' (1987).\n\nThe \"bug planet\" scenes were filmed in the [[badlands]] of [[Hell's Half Acre (Wyoming)|Hell's Half Acre]] in [[Natrona County]], Wyoming.<ref name=\"audiocommentary\" />\n\nTwo nude scenes were kept in the original version (the co-ed shower and a bedroom romp between Rico and Dizzy), although these were modified in the broadcast version. The cast agreed to do the co-ed shower scene only if Verhoeven agreed to direct the scene naked, which he did.<ref name=\"audiocommentary\"/>\n\nIn the [[audio commentary]] on the DVD or Blu-ray release, Verhoeven remarks that he had hoped to cast actors whose age more closely matched that of the characters\u2014and indeed of real-world soldiers\u2014but that the producers felt such actors would look too young. The teacher and leader of the \"Roughnecks\" in the novel are combined into one role played by Ironside.<ref name=\"audiocommentary\"/>\n\nTest audience reactions led to several minor changes before the film was released. Originally, it was clear that Carmen was torn between Rico and Zander. Test audiences, regardless of gender, strongly felt that a woman could not love two men at once, so scenes which portrayed this were cut. These audiences also felt it was immoral for Carmen to choose a career ahead of being loyal to Rico, to the extent that many commented that, in so doing, Carmen should have been the one to die instead of Dizzy. While admitting it may have been a bad commercial decision not to change the film to accommodate this, the producer and director did cut a scene from after Zander's death in which Carmen and Rico kiss, which the audience believed made the previous betrayal even more immoral.<ref name=\"audiocommentary\"/>\n\n===Relationship to novel===\nBecause the film originated from an unrelated script, with names and superficial details from the [[Starship Troopers|novel]] being added retroactively, there are many differences between the two.<ref name=\"gemsbok\">{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/thursday-theater-starship-troopers-paul-verhoeven-robert-heinlein/|title=Poking Fun at Militarism: How Paul Verhoeven\u2019s Cult Classic ''Starship Troopers'' Willfully Discards Robert Heinlein\u2019s Novel|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=February 4, 2016|website=The Gemsbok|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}</ref> While the novel has [[Starship Troopers#Controversy|been accused of]] promoting militarism, fascism, and military rule,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/godwin.if.html|title=Meme, Counter-meme|last=Godwin|first=Mike|date=October 1, 1994|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nitrosyncretic.com/pdfs/nature_of_fedsvc_1996.pdf|title=The Nature of \"Federal Service\" in Robert A.

After graduating from high school in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Juan Rico|John \"Johnny\" Rico]], his girlfriend Carmen Iba\u00f1ez, and [[psychic]] best friend Carl Jenkins enlist in the Federal Service, despite Rico's parents' disapproval of military service. Carmen becomes a spaceship pilot, while Carl joins [[Military Intelligence]]. Rico enlists in the Mobile Infantry and is surprised to find Isabelle \"Dizzy\" Flores, his fellow ex-student, has deliberately transferred to his squad.\n\nIn Mobile Infantry basic training, Career Sgt Zim ruthlessly trains the recruits. Rico befriends fellow cadet Ace Levy and is later promoted to squad leader. He subsequently receives a [[Dear John letter]] from Carmen, as she desires a career with the fleet and now serves under Rico's high-school sports rival, Zander Barcalow. Following a [[Live fire exercise|live-fire training]] incident that kills one of Rico's squad members and causes another to quit out of guilt, Rico is demoted and [[Flagellation|flogged]]. He resigns and calls his parents to ask them if he can return home, but rescinds his resignation after an asteroid, reported to be launched by the Arachnids, obliterates Buenos Aires, killing his parents and millions of others.\n\nAn invasion force is deployed to [[Klendathu]], the Arachnids' home planet, but the operation severely underestimates the Arachnids and is a total disaster. Rico is severely wounded and mistakenly reported [[killed in action|KIA]]. After recovering, he, Ace, and Dizzy are reassigned to the \"Roughnecks\", an [[Special forces|elite unit]] commanded by Lt. Jean Rasczak, Rico's former high-school teacher. He quickly gains the respect of his peers and is promoted to the rank of Corporal after taking out a tanker bug. His relationship with Dizzy continues to grow, and they have sex during their night on Tango Urilla.\n\nThe Roughnecks respond to a distress call from Planet \"P\", where they reconnoiter an outpost that has been devastated by Bugs. They soon realize that the distress call is a trap, and the Arachnids swarm the outpost. Rico, now an acting sergeant, euthanizes a mortally wounded Rasczak after a buried Bug bites off his legs. Dizzy is killed, but the surviving Roughnecks are rescued by Carmen and Zander. Rico and Carmen encounter Carl, now a high-ranking intelligence officer, at Dizzy's funeral. Carl reveals that there is reason to believe an intelligent \"brain bug\" is directing the other Bugs and has been learning how to fight humans. He [[Battlefield promotion|field-promotes]] Rico to lieutenant and gives him command of the Roughnecks, ordering the Mobile Infantry units under his control to return to \"P\" in an attempt to capture the brain bug.\n\nThe Fleet encounters unexpected heavy fire from the Bugs and Carmen's ship is destroyed. Carmen and Zander's escape pod crashes into a Bug tunnel system near Rico. They are surrounded by Bugs and a brain bug uses its [[proboscis]] to pierce Zander's skull and eat his brain. As it is about to do the same to Carmen, she cuts off its proboscis with a knife. Rico, Watkins and Ace arrive and threaten the Bugs with a small [[Tactical nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]], which the brain bug recognizes. They flee while the brain bug makes its escape. Arachnids pursue them and Watkins, mortally wounded, sacrifices himself by detonating the bomb to enable the others to escape.\n\nAfter returning to the surface, they find that former Sergeant Zim, who had requested a demotion to private so that he could serve at the front, has captured the brain bug. Carl tells Rico and Carmen that the humans will soon be victorious now that Military Intelligence can study the brain bug. Carl mentally scans the Bug and reveals that it is afraid, to the cheers of the troops. A [[propaganda]] clip shows Carmen, Ace, and Rico as model servicemen, encouraging viewers to enlist in the armed forces.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Casper Van Dien]] as [[John Rico|Pvt./Cpl./Sgt./Lt.

[[Paul Verhoeven]] had never read the book, and attempted to read it for the film, but it made him \"bored and depressed\", so he read only a few chapters:\n\n<blockquote>I stopped after two chapters because it was so boring \u2026 It is really quite a bad book. I asked [[Edward Neumeier|Ed Neumeier]] to tell me the story because I just couldn't read the thing. It's a very right-wing book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/paul-verhoeven/|title=Triple Dutch: Paul Verhoeven's sci-fi trilogy|last1=Smith|first1=Adam|last2=Williams|first2=Owen|date=February 12, 2015|website=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|url-status=dead|accessdate=December 7, 2016|quote=I stopped after two chapters because it was so boring,\" says Verhoeven of his attempts to read Heinlein's opus. \"It is really quite a bad book. I asked Ed Neumeier to tell me the story because I just couldn't read the thing. It's a very right-wing book. And with the movie we tried, and I think at least partially succeeded, in commenting on that at the same time. It would be eat your cake and have it. All the way through we were fighting with the fascism, the ultra-militarism. All the way through I wanted the audience to be asking, 'Are these people crazy?'}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=October 2019}}</blockquote>\n\nNeumeier had previously worked with Verhoeven as a writer on ''[[RoboCop|Robocop]]'' (1987).\n\nThe \"bug planet\" scenes were filmed in the [[badlands]] of [[Hell's Half Acre (Wyoming)|Hell's Half Acre]] in [[Natrona County]], Wyoming.<ref name=\"audiocommentary\" />\n\nTwo nude scenes were kept in the original version (the co-ed shower and a bedroom romp between Rico and Dizzy), although these were modified in the broadcast version. The cast agreed to do the co-ed shower scene only if Verhoeven agreed to direct the scene naked, which he did.<ref name=\"audiocommentary\"/>\n\nIn the [[audio commentary]] on the DVD or Blu-ray release, Verhoeven remarks that he had hoped to cast actors whose age more closely matched that of the characters\u2014and indeed of real-world soldiers\u2014but that the producers felt such actors would look too young. The teacher and leader of the \"Roughnecks\" in the novel are combined into one role played by Ironside.<ref name=\"audiocommentary\"/>\n\nTest audience reactions led to several minor changes before the film was released. Originally, it was clear that Carmen was torn between Rico and Zander. Test audiences, regardless of gender, strongly felt that a woman could not love two men at once, so scenes which portrayed this were cut. These audiences also felt it was immoral for Carmen to choose a career ahead of being loyal to Rico, to the extent that many commented that, in so doing, Carmen should have been the one to die instead of Dizzy. While admitting it may have been a bad commercial decision not to change the film to accommodate this, the producer and director did cut a scene from after Zander's death in which Carmen and Rico kiss, which the audience believed made the previous betrayal even more immoral.<ref name=\"audiocommentary\"/>\n\n===Relationship to novel===\nBecause the film originated from an unrelated script, with names and superficial details from the [[Starship Troopers|novel]] being added retroactively, there are many differences between the two.<ref name=\"gemsbok\">{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/thursday-theater-starship-troopers-paul-verhoeven-robert-heinlein/|title=Poking Fun at Militarism: How Paul Verhoeven\u2019s Cult Classic ''Starship Troopers'' Willfully Discards Robert Heinlein\u2019s Novel|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=February 4, 2016|website=The Gemsbok|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}</ref> While the novel has [[Starship Troopers#Controversy|been accused of]] promoting militarism, fascism, and military rule,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/godwin.if.html|title=Meme, Counter-meme|last=Godwin|first=Mike|date=October 1, 1994|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nitrosyncretic.com/pdfs/nature_of_fedsvc_1996.pdf|title=The Nature of \"Federal Service\" in Robert A.

Before the match a massive crowd outside the stadium rushed the gates, burst the barriers and swarmed on to the pitch. Kick-off was delayed for 45 minutes as mounted police, with PC [[George Scorey]] on his white charger \"Billy\" \u2013 hence the [[FA Cup Final 1923|\"White Horse Final\"]] \u2013 particularly visible, encouraged people to move behind the touchlines.

Bolton were 3\u20131 up with 22 minutes remaining and, despite being reduced to nine fit men through severe injury to two players, looked set to win the match when Blackpool's [[Stan Mortensen]] scored from a Matthews cross. With less than five minutes remaining Blackpool equalised from a Mortensen free kick (his [[Hat-trick#Association football|hat-trick]], which remains the only one ever scored in a Wembley FA Cup Final) and shortly after the restart, with everybody anticipating extra time, Matthews passed to [[Bill Perry (footballer)|Bill Perry]] who put the ball in the back of the net securing a 4\u20133 victory for Blackpool.\n\n===Bert Trautmann===\nThe final of 1956 saw Manchester City win 3\u20131 against Birmingham City.

However, as they have not won the FA Cup since then, this means that Notts County have been waiting longer than any other winning professional club to win the trophy for a second time. Their first ever final appearance had come three year's earlier in 1891, where they were defeated 3\u20131 by [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] at [[The Oval]], despite having beaten the same side 7\u20131 in the league only a week earlier.\n\nIn 1901 [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] became the first team from outside the Football League to win the FA Cup since the league was founded, with a 3\u20131 replay victory over [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].\n\n1958 saw Leeds United beaten 2\u20131 at home to Cardiff City in the third round for the third consecutive year.\n\nIn 1958\u201359, [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] club [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] had one of the great cup runs, beating [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and holding [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] to a draw in the semi-final before losing the replay.

They were a [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] outfit when they beat holders Arsenal 1\u20130 thanks to a goal by [[Trevor Brooking]]. Four second-level clubs \u2013 [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in 1982, Sunderland in 1992, [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in 2004 and Cardiff City in 2008 \u2013 have since reached the final, though all four lost.\n\nIn 1984, [[Johnny Hore]]'s [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] side narrowly missed out on being the first [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] side to reach the final.

Lincoln City were eventually knocked out in the quarter-finals, a 5\u20130 reversal at Arsenal.\n\n===Come-backs===\nIn 1966, Everton became only the second side ever to win the cup after being two goals down, without the need of extra time. The Merseysiders had gone two goals down with thirty-one minutes remaining before coming back to win 3\u20132, emulating Blackpool's achievement of thirteen years earlier, however, while Blackpool had been up against a Bolton side reduced to nine fit men, Sheffield Wednesday, by contrast, were in no way handicapped. The match, however, was largely forgotten as it was overshadowed by England's [[1966 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] victory later that year.\n\n==Records and statistics==\n\n===Individual records===\n\n====Most wins and final appearances====\nThe record for most FA Cup wins by a player is held by [[Ashley Cole]], who has won it seven times (with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 2002, 2003 and 2005, and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2012).

The closest anyone has come to breaking this long-standing record was [[Ian Rush]], who scored 44 FA Cup goals in his career, from 1979\u201398.\n\nW. \"Doc\" Dowden scored 19 FA Cup goals for [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] in the 1929/30 season. This is believed to be the record for one individual in a season. For rounds proper only, the highest total is that of Albert Brown who scored 15 times for Tottenham in 1900/01.\n\nWhen [[Peter Osgood]] scored for Chelsea in the 1970 final, he became the last player to date (and ninth in total) to score in every round of the cup.\n\nIn one tie, between Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic vs. Margate, [[Ted MacDougall]] scored 9 of Bournemouth's goals in their 11\u20130 victory.\n\n====Scoring firsts====\nIn 1876, [[Thomas Hughes (footballer)|Thomas Hughes]] was the first to score more than once in the final, in a replay match in which Wanderers defeated Old Etonians 3\u20130. In the same final, [[Alexander Bonsor]] from the losing side became the first to score in two consecutive finals (both of which his team lost).\n\n[[Eddie Kelly (footballer)|Eddie Kelly]] from Arsenal became the first substitute to score when he came on the pitch in the 70th minute of the 1971 final and scored in the 96th. [[Stuart McCall]] from Everton scored two goals after coming in from the bench in the 1989 final in the 90th and 102nd minutes.\n\nIn 2001, [[Dagenham & Redbridge F.C.]] goalkeeper [[Tony Roberts (footballer)|Tony Roberts]] became the first goalkeeper in the history of the tournament to score a goal, this happened in a Fourth Round Qualifying game against [[Basingstoke Town]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/low/football/fa_cup/2695925.stm BBC News, 27 January 2003]</ref>\n\n====Scoring streaks====\nIn 1886, [[James Brown (footballer born 1862)|Jimmy Brown]] of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] became the first to score in three consecutive finals from 1884 to 1886 (winning all three).\n\nIn 1887, Aston Villa legend [[Archie Hunter]] became the first player to score in every round of the FA Cup in Villa's victorious 1887 campaign (beginning from the second round, as Villa had a bye in the first). This feat was bettered in 1901 by [[Sandy Brown (Scottish footballer born 1879)|Sandy Brown]] of Tottenham Hotspur, who scored in all rounds from the first.\n\n[[File:Drogba chelsea.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|In 2012, [[Didier Drogba]] of Chelsea became the first player to score in four FA Cup Finals]]\nIn the 2012 final, [[Didier Drogba]] became the first player to score in four FA Cup Finals.\n\n====Fastest goals====\n[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa's]] [[Bob Chatt]] scored the winner in the [[1895 FA Cup Final]] with the then-fastest goal after just 30 seconds;<ref name=\"Chatt\">{{cite web|title=FA Cup Trivia |work=www.thefa.com |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/05/48711.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20040106155319/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/05/48711.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 January 2004 |accessdate=18 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> his record stood until broken by [[Louis Saha]] in [[2009 FA Cup Final|2009]], who scored in 25 seconds.<ref name = \"Saha\">{{cite news | title= Chelsea 2\u20131 Everton  | work= [[BBC Sport]]| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/8060989.stm| accessdate=31 May 2009 | date=30 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Louis Saha, Everton.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Louis Saha]] of Everton scored in a record 25 seconds in the [[2009 FA Cup Final]]]]\nOn 30 May 2009, [[Louis Saha]] scored the fastest ever goal in an FA Cup Final (after 25 seconds) for Everton, who lost 2\u20131 to eventual winners Chelsea.<ref name = \"Saha\"/>\n\nOn 13 February 2010, [[Jimmy Kebe]] of [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] scored the fastest goal in the FA Cup proper after just 9 seconds of Reading's Fifth Round tie against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].<ref>[http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/2010/quickest-goal-150210.aspx Quick goal in The Cup]</ref>\n\n====Hat\u2013tricks====\n[[William Townley]] scored the first hat\u2013trick in an FA Cup final for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] when they beat [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C|Sheffield Wednesday]] 6\u20131 in [[1890 FA Cup Final|1890]].\n\nIn [[1894 FA Cup Final|1894]], [[James Logan (footballer, born 1870)|Jimmy Logan]] became the second player to score three goals in the final of the competition, with his [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] beating [[Bolton Wanderers F.C|Bolton Wanderers]] 4\u20131.\n\nThe third hat-trick in an FA Cup final was scored by [[Stan Mortensen]] for [[Blackpool F.C|Blackpool]] against [[Bolton Wanderers]] in the [[1953 FA Cup Final]].\n\nIn 1922, [[England national amateur football team|England amateur]] international Wilfred Minter created an unusual scoring record. In an era when there was some dispute whether or not a hat\u2013trick had to be scored as consecutive goals, Minter performed the feat twice in one match, as well as scoring a seventh, as he scored all of [[St Albans City F.C.|St Albans City]]'s goals against [[Dulwich Hamlet F.C.|Dulwich Hamlet]].

The first missed penalty occurred in 1913, with [[Charlie Wallace]] from Aston Villa being the unlucky player, although Villa did win 1\u20130 over Sunderland. Two penalties were not converted until 1994, when [[Eric Cantona]] kicked from the spot in the 60th and 66th minutes to contribute to Manchester United's 4\u20130 win over Chelsea.\n\n[[File:Beasant.jpg|thumb|[[Dave Beasant]] of Wimbledon was the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in an FA Cup Final, in 1988]]\nIn 1988, [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]'s [[Dave Beasant]] became the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in an [[FA Cup Final 1988|FA Cup final]] at Wembley, when he denied [[John Aldridge]] of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (although Charlie Wallace of Aston Villa was the first to miss a penalty in the final).

Byrne, who had a reputation for being as hard as nails, broke his [[collarbone]] as early as the 3rd minute. Despite being in agony, he played on for the next 87 minutes, and also an additional half hour of extra time. Despite the crippling injury he achieved legendary status, by not only helping [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] to win the cup for the first time in their history, following a 2\u20131 victory, but he also managed to provide an assist, breaking forward on the left and crossing for [[Roger Hunt]] to score the opening goal.\n\nIt has been otherwise commonplace for Cup Final players to continue playing despite injury. The first injured player forced to retire from a match was [[Arthur Dunn]] ([[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]]), who injured a knee 15 minutes into the second half against [[Blackburn Olympic F.C.|Blackburn Olympic]] in 1883. His team carried on playing with ten men but lost.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Early F.A.

In 1873, [[Julian Sturgis]] was the first man from outside the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] to win the Cup.\n\nIn 1996, [[Eric Cantona]] became the first non-British or Irish player to captain a winning side in the FA Cup Final.\n\nIn 1997, [[Ruud Gullit]] became the first overseas manager to win the FA Cup, as his Chelsea side beat Middlesbrough 2\u20130. [[Roberto Di Matteo]] scored what was then the fastest goal in a Wembley cup final, after 42 seconds.\n\n====Other individual firsts====\nIn the 1946 final, [[Arthur Turner (footballer born 1922)|Arthur Turner]], of Charlton Athletic, became the only player to play in the final who never played a League game for his club, since the [[the Football League|League's]] inception.<ref name=\"Collett 2003 790\"/>\n\nThe 2003 Final was the first in which a goalkeeper was substituted.

Fifth are Aston Villa on 846 goals.\n\n====Winning streaks====\nAfter winning the competition from 1884 to 1886, [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] became the second club to win three consecutive FA Cups and remain the only club still in existence to win \"three in a row\" to this day, as Wanderers, who achieved the feat 6 years earlier, were disbanded in 1883.\n\n[[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] hold the record for holding the FA Cup the longest, but only by virtue of the suspension of the competition for World War II.\n\n====Undefeated streaks====\nIn 2013, Chelsea set a record of 29 FA Cup matches without defeat (excluding penalty shoot-outs). Their loss to Manchester City in the 2013 semi-finals was their first since a quarter-final loss to Barnsley in 2008.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21921311 Chelsea 1\u20130 Man Utd]</ref>\n\nArsenal are currently the holders of the most FA Cup trophies (13).\n\n====Most final losses====\nIn 1969 Leicester City lost their fourth FA Cup Final, 1\u20130 to Manchester City. No other team has made it to the Final so many times without ever winning. However, 13 other teams have lost as many or more Finals but have also won the Cup at least once. The record number of Final defeats stands at 8 for Everton, although they have also won the Cup on 5 occasions.\n\n===Game records===\nOn 15 October 1887, [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] defeated [[Hyde F.C.|Hyde]] 26\u20130, which remains the record score in an FA Cup tie.\n\nIn 1903 [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] defeated [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] 6\u20130, a record that was matched by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 2019, when they defeated Watford 6\u20130. \n\nIn 1959, [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] became the first team to lose a player to injury in the Final and go on to win with 10 men, beating Luton Town 2\u20131 after having goalscorer [[Roy Dwight]] carried off with a broken leg after 33 minutes.\n\n1971 saw the longest tie in Cup history. [[Oxford City F.C.|Oxford City]] and [[Alvechurch F.C.|Alvechurch]] play 6 games for a total of 660 minutes. Alvechurch won the final game 1\u20130 to progress to the first round proper.\n\n====Tournament game streaks====\nIn 1963, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] became the quickest winners of all time, apart from the special circumstances of [[1873 FA Cup Final|1873]]. They played their first match on 4 March, after 12 postponements, and won the final on 25 May, 82 days later.<ref>{{cite book |last= Collett |first= Mike |title= The Complete Record of The FA Cup |year= 2003 |isbn= 1-899807-19-5 |pages=782}}</ref>\n\nThe 1973\u201374 competition saw the record set for the highest number of games played in one season by one club.

Multiple replays no longer take place, so this record is unlikely to be beaten.\n\n===Competition records===\n1910 saw the start of a string of 14 consecutive finals (including 3 replays, thus 17 matches) in which the losing side failed to score. This series was not approached until 1994\u20132000, with seven consecutive finals (no replays).\n\nIn 1948, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] became the only team to win the FA Cup after being drawn against top-division opposition in every round.\n\n1956\u201357 saw the record for highest number of rounds played in a row, when former League club [[New Brighton A.F.C.|New Brighton]] played in nine rounds. They started in the preliminary round, and progressed through four qualifying rounds to the fourth round proper, where they lost to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. They had just one replay \u2013 for their first round tie. The 1977\u201378 competition saw this record equalled by [[Blyth Spartans F.C.|Blyth Spartans]], who progressed from the 1st qualifying round to the 5th round proper. The games for the 2nd qualifying round and the 5th rounds proper went to a replay. The 1979\u201380 competition saw the record equalled again, this time by [[Harlow Town F.C.|Harlow Town]], who progressed from the Preliminary round through four qualifying rounds to the fourth round proper, where they lost to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. The matches for the 2nd and 3rd rounds went to a replay.\n\nIn 1959, [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] fielded the same 11 players in every round of the competition (9 matches including replays).\n\n1976\u201377 was the season with the largest number of matches (173) in the competition proper. Due to the abolition of multiple replays, the record is unlikely to be beaten. In seasons after 1996 (when penalty shootouts were introduced) the most ties (163) occurred in 2008\u201309.\n\nA record 763 clubs were accepted for the [[2011\u201312 FA Cup]].\n\n===Penalty shootouts===\nIn the 1971\u201372 competition, [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] became the first team to win a match in a [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]], beating [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] 4\u20133 after a 0\u20130 draw in the third-fourth playoff.<ref name=\"complete1\"/>\n\nThe [[2005 FA Cup Final]] between [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] was the first final ever to have to go to [[penalty shootout (football)|penalties]] as the score was still 0\u20130 after extra time. [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] won the shootout \u2013 and thus the Cup \u2013 5\u20134. It was the first 0\u20130 draw in an FA Cup final since 1912.\n\nOn 22 January 2008, [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] became the first club in the FA Cup to miss all four of their penalties in a penalty shootout, against [[Barnet FC|Barnet]] in a third round replay.<ref>\"[http://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/mostpopular.var.1989368.mostviewed.is_towns_spot_of_bother_a_record.php Is Town's spot of bother a record?]\" ''Swindon Advertiser''.

This double was even more extraordinary in that the league was won without a single defeat, a feat which would not be repeated in the top division until 2003\u201304, by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Equally impressive was that the cup was won without conceding a single goal. Such was the team's dominance that it was nicknamed [[The Invincibles (football)|\"The Invincibles\"]].\n\nIn 1897 Aston Villa won the FA Cup and League Championship on same day, with results in League matches confirming their championship as they beat Everton 3\u20132 in the final.\n\n1961 saw [[Tottenham Hotspur]] become the first club in the 20th century to win the FA Cup and league championship in the same season, known famously as [[Double (association football)|The Double]]. They also retained the FA Cup the following year.\n\nIn 1986, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 3\u20131 in the first all-[[Merseyside]] FA Cup final to complete the double and claim their first FA Cup triumph for 12 years. The teams would meet again in the final just 3 years later.\n\nIn 1994, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] completed the double thanks to a 4\u20130 win over [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at Wembley. [[Eric Cantona]] scored two penalties and the other goals came from [[Mark Hughes]] and [[Brian McClair]].\n\nIn 1996, a late goal from [[Eric Cantona]] saw [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] become the first team to win the double twice as they beat [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] 1\u20130 at Wembley, a week after clinching the league title and overtake Tottenham's total of eight cup wins.\n\nIn 1998, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] beat Newcastle 2\u20130. This was the second time Arsenal had done the domestic double, which includes winning the Premier League and FA Cup in the same year.\n\nIn 1999, Manchester United completed [[The Treble]] by also winning the [[Premier League|FA Premier League]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]].\n\nIn 2002, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] matched [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s record of three doubles as they defeated [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] 2\u20130 at the [[Millennium Stadium]] and clinched the league title four days later.\n\nIn May 2010, Chelsea became the seventh club to complete the league and FA Cup \"[[Double (association football)#England|Double]]\", by beating [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] 1\u20130 in the 2010 final.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/8680493.stm Chelsea 1\u20130 Portsmouth]</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Manchester City became the first English side to win the [[Treble (association football)#Domestic trebles|domestic treble]] with their Cup win, having already secured the [[EFL Cup]] and the Premier League.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McNulty |first1=Phil |title=Man City 6-0 Watford: City clinch historic domestic treble |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48236232 |website=BBC Sport |accessdate=18 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] also won the [[Welsh Cup]] in the year of their FA Cup win in 1927, becoming the only team in the world to achieve a transnational cup double.\n\n==Oddities==\nIn 1873, [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield]] confirmed a unique place in FA Cup history, knocking out [[Shropshire Wanderers F.C.|Shropshire Wanderers]] on the toss of a coin; the only time a tie has been decided in this way.<ref>{{cite book |last= Collett |first= Mike |title= The Complete Record of The FA Cup |year= 2003 |isbn= 1-899807-19-5 |page=537}}</ref>\n\nThe only game to be played on [[Christmas Day]] took place in 1888, [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield Athletic]] beating [[Cliftonville F.C.|Cliftonville]] 7\u20130.<ref name=\"Collett 2003 878\"/>\n\nIn 1921, [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham]] set the record for shortest FA Cup run \u2013 they forgot to send in their entry form.\n\nIn 1931 West Bromwich Albion became the only team to win the FA Cup and get promoted in the same season, defeating Birmingham City 2\u20131 in the final.\n\nIn 1990, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] won the competition in a replay against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. This was United manager [[Alex Ferguson]]'s first trophy at United, and this success is seen by many as having saved him from being dismissed after 4 unsuccessful seasons.\n\nFor the first time, the FA Cup was played under a roof in the final of the [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303 season]], held on 17 May 2003 at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]], with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] benefiting from cover from the rain. Arsenal were 1\u20130 winners.\n\n[[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] became the first side to win the FA Cup and be relegated in the same season, after beating [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] 1\u20130 in the [[2013 FA Cup Final|2013 final]]. Their fate in the Premier League was sealed three days after their triumph, following a 4\u20131 defeat to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22430454 | work=BBC News | title=Arsenal 4\u20131 Wigan | date=14 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Participants==\n\n===Amateur, university and professional teams===\nIn 1883 [[Blackburn Olympic F.C.|Blackburn Olympic]] broke the \"old order of things\" to defeat [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]] in the final to become the first professional club to win the trophy. The win marked a turning point in the culture of the game in England.\n\nIn 2002, [[Team Bath F.C.|Team Bath]] (from the [[University of Bath]]) became the first university team to enter the competition since [[Gonville & Caius A.F.C.|Gonville & Caius]] in 1881, and progressed through the qualifying rounds before being knocked out in the first round proper by [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]].\n\n===Scottish sides===\nIn 1884 and 1885 Scottish side [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] reached the final, the first time a non-English side had done so.

They were beaten 2\u20131 by QPR.\n\nThe 1927 final resulted in a [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] victory over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. To the present day, Cardiff City are the only non-English-based team to win the trophy.\n\n==Traditions==\n\n===Ribbons===\nIn 1901, Tottenham became the first team to attach ribbons in their team colours to the trophy, a tradition that continues to this day.\n\n===Equipment===\nIn the 1933 final, Everton players wore shirts numbered 1\u201311, and Manchester City players 12\u201322. This was the first major competitive game ever to have the players' shirts numbered.\n\nThe [[FA Cup Final 1973|1973 FA Cup Final]] was the first that a yellow ball was used in a Cup Final (although an orange ball had been used in previous finals, for example in 1968).  An orange ball was used in the [[2014 FA Cup Final|2014]] and [[2015 FA Cup Final|2015 Cup Final]]s, as they were used throughout the competition.\n\n===Referees===\nSince 1902, referees can only officiate one Cup Final, though they are allowed to have prior Final experience as an assistant referee.\n\n===Royal attendance===\nIn 1914, [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] became the first monarch to watch the FA Cup Final between [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the last cup final played at [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]].\n\nThe 'Matthews Final' of 1953 was the first football match attended by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|The Queen]], in her Coronation year.<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4829.asp 80 facts about the Queen] British Monarchy</ref>\n\n===Triangular corner flags===\nIt is commonly held that previous winners of the FA Cup are traditionally the only clubs allowed to use [[triangular corner flags in English football]].

The Football Association however argued that it would be better to carry on to provide relief for the workers and soldiers.{{sfn|Barber|1981|p=1914\u20135}} In the following year the competition was suspended.\n\nThe [[1923 FA Cup Final|1923 final]] was the first FA Cup final to be played at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], which was known at the time as the Empire Stadium. Over 200,000 people squeezed into a stadium meant for 127,000 and many spilt out onto the pitch. It took three-quarter of an hour for mounted police to clear the field before the game could start.

For one season only, as the intermediate [[Football League North and South|Football League North and Football League South]] were of variable quality, to boost clubs' income each tie was played over two legs (one home, one away with the scores being added together to decide who went through) to increase the number of matches in the season. Matches that were level at the end of both legs were replayed at the stadium of whichever team had played the second leg away. The final, played at a neutral venue, remained a single match affair, decided by extra time if teams were level after 90 minutes.

The following year, on 16 March 1872, [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] became the first winners of the FA Cup, beating [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]] 1\u20130 at [[The Oval]].

Before the match a massive crowd outside the stadium rushed the gates, burst the barriers and swarmed on to the pitch.

Bolton were 3\u20131 up with 22 minutes remaining and, despite being reduced to nine fit men through severe injury to two players, looked set to win the match when Blackpool's [[Stan Mortensen]] scored from a Matthews cross. With less than five minutes remaining Blackpool equalised from a Mortensen free kick (his [[Hat-trick#Association football|hat-trick]], which remains the only one ever scored in a Wembley FA Cup Final) and shortly after the restart, with everybody anticipating extra time, Matthews passed to [[Bill Perry (footballer)|Bill Perry]] who put the ball in the back of the net securing a 4\u20133 victory for Blackpool.\n\n===Bert Trautmann===\nThe final of 1956 saw Manchester City win 3\u20131 against Birmingham City. Roughly 15 minutes before the end of the game, Man City's goalkeeper [[Bert Trautmann]] (a German who had been taken as a [[prisoner of war]] by the British in 1945) injured his neck when he made a save at the feet of Birmingham's [[Peter Murphy (footballer born 1922)|Peter Murphy]].

However, as they have not won the FA Cup since then, this means that Notts County have been waiting longer than any other winning professional club to win the trophy for a second time. Their first ever final appearance had come three year's earlier in 1891, where they were defeated 3\u20131 by [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] at [[The Oval]], despite having beaten the same side 7\u20131 in the league only a week earlier.\n\nIn 1901 [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] became the first team from outside the Football League to win the FA Cup since the league was founded, with a 3\u20131 replay victory over [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].\n\n1958 saw Leeds United beaten 2\u20131 at home to Cardiff City in the third round for the third consecutive year.\n\nIn 1958\u201359, [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] club [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] had one of the great cup runs, beating [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and holding [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] to a draw in the semi-final before losing the replay.  Their progress from the First Round proper included wins over Ilford, Swindon Town (replay), Manchester United, Cardiff City, Tottenham Hotspur, Sheffield United (replay).\n\nWhen [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] beat Leeds United 1\u20130 in the [[FA Cup Final 1973|1973 FA Cup Final]], Sunderland were the first Cup winners from outside the top flight since [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in 1931. The feat was repeated twice over the next seven seasons (by [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in 1976 and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in 1980) but has not been accomplished since.\n\nIn 1980, [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] became the last side to date to win the competition from outside the top division in football. They were a [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] outfit when they beat holders Arsenal 1\u20130 thanks to a goal by [[Trevor Brooking]]. Four second level clubs \u2013 [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in 1982, Sunderland in 1992, [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in 2004 and Cardiff City in 2008 \u2013 have since reached the final, though all four lost.\n\nIn 1984, [[Johnny Hore]]'s [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] side narrowly missed out on being the first [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] side to reach the final.

Starting in the first round proper, Argyle had beaten [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] (in a replay), [[Barking F.C.|Barking]], [[Newport County F.C.|Newport County]] (in a replay), [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]], [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] (in a replay).<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/6426535.stm Where are they now?] BBC Sport, 8 March 2007</ref>\n\nIn 1989, [[Sutton United 2\u20131 Coventry City (1989)|Sutton United beat Coventry City]] 2\u20131 at Gander Green Lane. Sutton United were in the Conference at the time, whilst Coventry were in the First Division, and had won the cup 18 months earlier. This was the last occasion that a non-League club beat a top division club in the FA Cup until Luton Town defeated Norwich City in the 4th round in 2012\u201313 season.\n\nOn 11 December 2007 [[Chasetown F.C.|Chasetown]] became the smallest team ever to reach the FA Cup third round. The [[Southern League Division One Midlands]] side stunned League One Port Vale as Danny Smith's last-minute goal sealed a 1\u20130 win after Port Vale missed two penalties. There was a five division gap between the two teams.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/football_league/article3041096.ece Chasetown hopeful of hosting tie at home] The Times, 12 December 2007</ref>\n\nPremier League side [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] [[Norwich City 0\u20131 Luton Town (2013)|lost at home]] to non-League [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] in the [[2012\u201313 FA Cup]] competition. This was the first time a non-league side had defeated top flight opposition since 1989, and the first time that a non-League side had won away at a top flight side since [[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]] had won at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in 1985\u201386.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/26/norwich-city-luton-town-fa-cup Luton Town's Scott Rendell makes FA Cup history as Norwich City fall], The Guardian, 26 January 2013</ref>\n\nThe [[2016\u201317 FA Cup]] had two non-League teams reaching the fifth round; [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] and Sutton United, both of the [[National League (division)|National League]]. Sutton United's run included a 3\u20131 win away to [[EFL League One|League One]] side [[AFC Wimbledon]] in a third round replay and a 1\u20130 win at home to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] of the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] in the fourth round, before succumbing 2\u20130 to eventual winners [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the fifth round. Lincoln City became the first non-League side in 103 years to reach the quarter-final stage of the FA Cup, since [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.]] of the [[Southern Football League]] in [[1913\u201314 FA Cup|1913\u201314]], and the first outright since the non-League became part of the [[English football league system]] as opposed to running parallel to it. Their run included a 3\u20132 victory over League One [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in the second round, two Championship scalps in rounds three and four \u2014 a 1\u20130 replay win against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and 3\u20131 against [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], respectively \u2014 before [[Burnley F.C. 0\u20131 Lincoln City F.C. (2017)|a 1\u20130 win]] away to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] of the [[Premier League]] in the fifth round. Lincoln City were eventually knocked out in the quarter-finals, a 5\u20130 reversal at Arsenal.\n\n===Come-backs===\nIn 1966, Everton became only the second side ever to win the cup after being two goals down, without the need of extra time. The Merseysiders had gone two goals down with thirty-one minutes remaining before coming back to win 3\u20132, emulating Blackpool's achievement of thirteen years earlier, however, while Blackpool had been up against a Bolton side reduced to nine fit men, Sheffield Wednesday, by contrast, were in no way handicapped. The match, however, was largely forgotten as it was overshadowed by England's [[1966 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] victory later that year.\n\n==Records and statistics==\n\n===Individual records===\n\n====Most wins and final appearances====\nThe record for most FA Cup wins by a player is held by [[Ashley Cole]], who has won it seven times (with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 2002, 2003 and 2005, and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2012). With Chelsea's victory over Portsmouth in the [[2010 FA Cup Final|2010 final]], Cole beat the record of five jointly held by [[Charles Wollaston]] ([[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]]), [[Arthur Kinnaird, 11th Lord Kinnaird|Arthur Kinnaird]] ([[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] & [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]]) and [[Jimmy Forrest (footballer)|Jimmy Forrest]] ([[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]).\n\nCole has appeared in 8 finals, having also been on the losing side for Arsenal in 2001.\n\nThe record for most FA Cup wins by a manager is held by [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]], who won it seven times (with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2014, 2015 and 2017.\n\n====Most goals====\nNotts County's [[Harry Cursham]] has scored the most goals in the FA Cup, with 49 goals in 44 appearances from 1877-91. Cursham has held the record continuously since 1887. The closest anyone has come to breaking this long-standing record was [[Ian Rush]], who scored 44 FA Cup goals in his career, from 1979-98.\n\nW. \"Doc\" Dowden scored 19 FA Cup goals for [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] in the 1929/30 season. This is believed to be the record for one individual in a season. For rounds proper only, the highest total is that of Albert Brown who scored 15 times for Tottenham in 1900/01.\n\nWhen [[Peter Osgood]] scored for Chelsea in the 1970 final, he became the last player to date (and ninth in total) to score in every round of the cup.\n\nIn one tie, between Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic vs. Margate, [[Ted MacDougall]] scored 9 of Bournemouth's goals in their 11\u20130 victory.\n\n====Scoring firsts====\nIn 1876, [[Thomas Hughes (footballer)|Thomas Hughes]] was the first to score more than once in the final, in a replay match in which Wanderers defeated Old Etonians 3\u20130. In the same final, [[Alexander Bonsor]] from the losing side became the first to score in two consecutive finals (both of which his team lost).\n\n[[Eddie Kelly (footballer)|Eddie Kelly]] from Arsenal became the first substitute to score when he came on the pitch in the 70th minute of the 1971 final and scored in the 96th. [[Stuart McCall]] from Everton scored two goals after coming in from the bench in the 1989 final in the 90th and 102nd minutes.\n\nIn 2001, [[Dagenham & Redbridge F.C.]] goalkeeper [[Tony Roberts (footballer)|Tony Roberts]] became the first goalkeeper in the history of the tournament to score a goal, this happened in a Fourth Round Qualifying game against [[Basingstoke Town]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/low/football/fa_cup/2695925.stm BBC News, 27 January 2003]</ref>\n\n====Scoring streaks====\nIn 1886, [[James Brown (footballer born 1862)|Jimmy Brown]] of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] became the first to score in three consecutive finals from 1884 to 1886 (winning all three).\n\nIn 1887, Aston Villa legend [[Archie Hunter]] became the first player to score in every round of the FA Cup in Villa's victorious 1887 campaign (beginning from the second round, as Villa had a bye in the first). This feat was bettered in 1901 by [[Sandy Brown (Scottish footballer born 1879)|Sandy Brown]] of Tottenham Hotspur, who scored in all rounds from the first.\n\n[[File:Drogba chelsea.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|In 2012, [[Didier Drogba]] of Chelsea became the first player to score in four FA Cup Finals]]\nIn the 2012 final, [[Didier Drogba]] became the first player to score in four FA Cup Finals.\n\n====Fastest goals====\n[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa's]] [[Bob Chatt]] scored the winner in the [[1895 FA Cup Final]] with the then-fastest goal after just 30 seconds;<ref name=\"Chatt\">{{cite web|title=FA Cup Trivia |work=www.thefa.com |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/05/48711.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20040106155319/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/05/48711.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 January 2004 |accessdate=18 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> his record stood until broken by [[Louis Saha]] in [[2009 FA Cup Final|2009]], who scored in 25 seconds.<ref name = \"Saha\">{{cite news | title= Chelsea 2\u20131 Everton  | work= [[BBC Sport]]| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/8060989.stm| accessdate=31 May 2009 | date=30 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Louis Saha, Everton.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Louis Saha]] of Everton scored in a record 25 seconds in the [[2009 FA Cup Final]]]]\nOn 30 May 2009, [[Louis Saha]] scored the fastest ever goal in an FA Cup Final (after 25 seconds) for Everton, who lost 2\u20131 to eventual winners Chelsea.<ref name = \"Saha\"/>\n\nOn 13 February 2010, [[Jimmy Kebe]] of [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] scored the fastest goal in the FA Cup proper after just 9 seconds of Reading's Fifth Round tie against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].<ref>[http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/2010/quickest-goal-150210.aspx Quick goal in The Cup]</ref>\n\n====Hat\u2013tricks====\n[[William Townley]] scored the first hat\u2013trick in an FA Cup final for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] when they beat [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C|Sheffield Wednesday]] 6\u20131 in [[1890 FA Cup Final|1890]].\n\nIn [[1894 FA Cup Final|1894]], [[James Logan (footballer, born 1870)|Jimmy Logan]] became the second player to score three goals in the final of the competition, with his [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] beating [[Bolton Wanderers F.C|Bolton Wanderers]] 4\u20131.\n\nThe third hat-trick in an FA Cup final was scored by [[Stan Mortensen]] for [[Blackpool F.C|Blackpool]] against [[Bolton Wanderers]] in the [[1953 FA Cup Final]].\n\nIn 1922, [[England national amateur football team|England amateur]] international Wilfred Minter created an unusual scoring record. In an era when there was some dispute whether or not a hat\u2013trick had to be scored as consecutive goals, Minter performed the feat twice in one match, as well as scoring a seventh, as he scored all of [[St Albans City F.C.|St Albans City]]'s goals against [[Dulwich Hamlet F.C.|Dulwich Hamlet]]. Despite his feat, they actually lost the game 8\u20137.<ref>{{cite book |last= Ward |first= Andrew |title= Soccer's Strangest Matches |year= 1992 |isbn= 0-86051-771-3 |pages=53\u201355}}</ref>\n\n====Penalties====\nThe first penalty in the final was not converted until 1910, with [[Albert Shepherd]] scoring from the spot in the Newcastle 2\u20130 Barnsley replay. The first missed penalty occurred in 1913, with [[Charlie Wallace]] from Aston Villa being the unlucky player, although Villa did win 1\u20130 over Sunderland. Two penalties were not converted until 1994, when [[Eric Cantona]] kicked from the spot in the 60th and 66th minutes to contribute to Manchester United's 4\u20130 win over Chelsea.\n\n[[File:Beasant.jpg|thumb|[[Dave Beasant]] of Wimbledon was the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in an FA Cup Final, in 1988]]\nIn 1988, [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]'s [[Dave Beasant]] became the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in an [[FA Cup Final 1988|FA Cup final]] at Wembley, when he denied [[John Aldridge]] of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (although Charlie Wallace of Aston Villa was the first to miss a penalty in the final).

Byrne, who had a reputation for being as hard as nails, broke his [[collarbone]] as early as the 3rd minute. Despite being in agony, he played on for the next 87 minutes, and also an additional half hour of extra time. Despite the crippling injury he achieved legendary status, by not only helping [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] to win the cup for the first time in their history, following a 2-1 victory, but he also managed to provide an assist, breaking forward on the left and crossing for [[Roger Hunt]] to score the opening goal.\n\nIt has been otherwise commonplace for Cup Final players to continue playing despite injury. The first injured player forced to retire from a match was [[Arthur Dunn]] ([[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]]), who injured a knee 15 minutes into the second half against [[Blackburn Olympic F.C.|Blackburn Olympic]] in 1883.

In 1873, [[Julian Sturgis]] was the first man from outside the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] to win the Cup.\n\nIn 1996, [[Eric Cantona]] became the first non-British or Irish player to captain a winning side in the FA Cup Final.\n\nIn 1997, [[Ruud Gullit]] became the first overseas manager to win the FA Cup, as his Chelsea side beat Middlesbrough 2\u20130. [[Roberto Di Matteo]] scored what was then the fastest goal in a Wembley cup final, after 42 seconds.\n\n====Other individual firsts====\nIn the 1946 final, [[Arthur Turner (footballer born 1922)|Arthur Turner]], of Charlton Athletic, became the only player to play in the final who never played a League game for his club, since the [[the Football League|League's]] inception.<ref name=\"Collett 2003 790\"/>\n\nThe 2003 Final was the first in which a goalkeeper was substituted.

Fifth are Aston Villa on 846 goals.\n\n====Winning streaks====\nAfter winning the competition from 1884 to 1886, [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] became the second club to win three consecutive FA Cups and remain the only club still in existence to win \"three in a row\" to this day, as Wanderers, who achieved the feat 6 years earlier, were disbanded in 1883.\n\n[[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] hold the record for holding the FA Cup the longest, but only by virtue of the suspension of the competition for World War II.\n\n====Undefeated streaks====\nIn 2013, Chelsea set a record of 29 FA Cup matches without defeat (excluding penalty shoot-outs). Their loss to Manchester City in the 2013 semi-finals was their first since a quarter-final loss to Barnsley in 2008.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21921311 Chelsea 1\u20130 Man Utd]</ref>\n\nArsenal are currently the holders of the most FA Cup trophies (13).\n\n====Most final losses====\nIn 1969 Leicester City lost their fourth FA Cup Final, 1\u20130 to Manchester City. No other team has made it to the Final so many times without ever winning. However, 13 other teams have lost as many or more Finals but have also won the Cup at least once. The record number of Final defeats stands at 8 for Everton, although they have also won the Cup on 5 occasions.\n\n===Game records===\nOn 15 October 1887, [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] defeated [[Hyde F.C.|Hyde]] 26\u20130, which remains the record score in an FA Cup tie.\n\nIn 1903 [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] defeated [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] 6\u20130, a record that was matched by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 2019, when they defeated Watford 6-0. \n\nIn 1959, [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] became the first team to lose a player to injury in the Final and go on to win with 10 men, beating Luton Town 2\u20131 after having goalscorer [[Roy Dwight]] carried off with a broken leg after 33 minutes.\n\n1971 saw the longest tie in Cup history. [[Oxford City F.C.|Oxford City]] and [[Alvechurch F.C.|Alvechurch]] play 6 games for a total of 660 minutes. Alvechurch won the final game 1\u20130 to progress to the first round proper.\n\n====Tournament game streaks====\nIn 1963, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] became the quickest winners of all time, apart from the special circumstances of [[1873 FA Cup Final|1873]]. They played their first match on 4 March, after 12 postponements, and won the final on 25 May, 82 days later.<ref>{{cite book |last= Collett |first= Mike |title= The Complete Record of The FA Cup |year= 2003 |isbn= 1-899807-19-5 |pages=782}}</ref>\n\nThe 1973\u201374 competition saw the record set for the highest number of games played in one season by one club.

Multiple replays no longer take place, so this record is unlikely to be beaten.\n\n===Competition records===\n1910 saw the start of a string of 14 consecutive finals (including 3 replays, thus 17 matches) in which the losing side failed to score. This series was not approached until 1994\u20132000, with seven consecutive finals (no replays).\n\nIn 1948, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] became the only team to win the FA Cup after being drawn against top-division opposition in every round.\n\n1956\u201357 saw the record for highest number of rounds played in a row, when former League club [[New Brighton A.F.C.|New Brighton]] played in nine rounds. They started in the preliminary round, and progressed through four qualifying rounds to the fourth round proper, where they lost to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. They had just one replay \u2013 for their first round tie. The 1977\u201378 competition saw this record equalled by [[Blyth Spartans F.C.|Blyth Spartans]], who progressed from the 1st qualifying round to the 5th round proper. The games for the 2nd qualifying round and the 5th rounds proper went to a replay. The 1979\u201380 competition saw the record equalled again, this time by [[Harlow Town F.C.|Harlow Town]], who progressed from the Preliminary round through four qualifying rounds to the fourth round proper, where they lost to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. The matches for the 2nd and 3rd rounds went to a replay.\n\nIn 1959, [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] fielded the same 11 players in every round of the competition (9 matches including replays).\n\n1976\u201377 was the season with the largest number of matches (173) in the competition proper. Due to the abolition of multiple replays, the record is unlikely to be beaten. In seasons after 1996 (when penalty shootouts were introduced) the most ties (163) occurred in 2008\u201309.\n\nA record 763 clubs were accepted for the [[2011\u201312 FA Cup]].\n\n===Penalty shootouts===\nIn the 1971\u201372 competition, [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] became the first team to win a match in a [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]], beating [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] 4\u20133 after a 0\u20130 draw in the third-fourth playoff.<ref name=\"complete1\"/>\n\nThe [[2005 FA Cup Final]] between [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] was the first final ever to have to go to [[penalty shootout (football)|penalties]] as the score was still 0\u20130 after extra time. [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] won the shootout \u2013 and thus the Cup \u2013 5\u20134. It was the first 0\u20130 draw in an FA Cup final since 1912.\n\nOn 22 January 2008, [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] became the first club in the FA Cup to miss all four of their penalties in a penalty shootout, against [[Barnet FC|Barnet]] in a third round replay.<ref>\"[http://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/mostpopular.var.1989368.mostviewed.is_towns_spot_of_bother_a_record.php Is Town's spot of bother a record?]\" ''Swindon Advertiser''.

This double was even more extraordinary in that the league was won without a single defeat, a feat which would not be repeated in the top division until 2003\u201304, by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Equally impressive was that the cup was won without conceding a single goal.
