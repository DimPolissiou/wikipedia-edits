If they were unsuccessful after three ascents, teams would incur a 4-hour time penalty.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*At Stanley Park, teams had to find the [[totem pole]]s and watched a traditional [[Squamish people|Squamish]] [[First Nations]] dance before receiving a blessing by the chief, along with their next clue, which instructed teams had to collect two paddles and take them to the [[Vancouver Rowing Club]], where they would find their next clue.\n*At the Vancouver Rowing Club, teams had to pick a [[kayak]] and travel to Harbour Green Park Dock to decipher a word puzzle of [[International maritime signal flags|maritime flags]], in which each flag represents a letter, to decode a nautical phrase (\"Three sheets to the wind, splice to the mainbrace, weigh anchor and set sail\") and receive their next clue.\n\n;Additional note\n*Teams began the ninth leg at [[El Capitolio]] in Havana.\n\n===Leg 10 (Canada)===\n[[File:Banff Springs Hotel - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|right|Teams ended this leg of the Race in [[Alberta]] at the [[Banff Springs Hotel]] inside [[Banff National Park]].]]\n'''Airdate''': 13 August 2012\n*{{TAR travel|bus}} Vancouver ([http://www.westinbayshore.com/ Westin Bayshore Hotel]) to [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], [[Alberta]] ([https://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_fhbro_eng.aspx?id=2618 Banff National Park Administration Building])\n*Banff ([http://www.wildbillsbanff.com/ Wild Bill's Saloon])\n*[[Canmore, Alberta|Canmore]] ([[Mount Rundle|Rundle Mountain]]) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who's climbing the walls?}}\n*{{TAR clue|Detour|Search|Ski}} [[Lake Louise, Alberta|Lake Louise]] ([http://www.skilouise.com/ The Lodge of the Ten Peaks])\n*[[Banff National Park]] ([[Great Divide Trail]])\n*Lake Louise ([[Chateau Lake Louise]])\n*Banff ([[Banff Springs Hotel]]) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop Pacific|10}}\n\nIn this Roadblock, one team member had to [[Ice climbing|ice climb]] {{convert|25|m|ft}} to the top of a frozen [[waterfall]] using [[ice axe]]s and [[crampons]] to retrieve their next clue.\n\nThe Detour was a choice of Search or Ski. Both Detour options required teams to drive themselves to The Lodge of the Ten Peaks in [[Lake Louise, Alberta|Lake Louise]] and pick up skiing equipment before taking the [[ski lift]] up the mountain. In Search, teams had to use an [[Avalanche transceiver|avalanche rescue beacon]] to search a marked area for a transmitter buried beneath the snow. Once teams dug up the transmitter, they could exchange it for their next clue. In Ski, both team members had to go through a [[slalom skiing]] course and pass through all the flags to receive their next clue.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*At the Westin Bayshore Hotel, teams had to sign up for one of two buses, the first of which carried two teams and departed an hour before the second, to their next destination: [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], [[Alberta]].\n*Upon arrival in Banff, teams travelled to Wild Bill's Saloon where they had to ride a [[mechanical bull]] for a combined total of sixty seconds. Teams had an option to hang on the bull for an even longer time as the team with the longest time would have a 30-minute advantage in the next task, the Roadblock.\n*After the Detour, teams had to travel though the [[Great Divide Trail]] in [[Banff National Park]] where they had to lead a team of [[sled dog]]s around a {{convert|3|km|mi}} course to find their next clue\n*At Chateau Lake Louise, teams had to extract a clue from an [[ice sculpture]] with only the tools provided. The tools were essentially random items, such as a shoe, that they were required to use in order to receive their next clue.\n\n===Leg 11 (Canada \u2192 China)===\n[[File:Chemin de ronde muraille long.JPG|thumbnail|Teams visited the [[Mutianyu]] section of the famous [[Great Wall of China]] for the Roadblock.]]\n'''Airdate''': 14 August 2012\n*{{TAR travel|bus}} Banff (Banff Springs Hotel) to [[Calgary]] ([[Calgary International Airport]])\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} Calgary (Calgary International Airport) to [[Beijing]], '''[[China]]''' {{flagicon|CHN}} ([[Beijing Capital International Airport]])\n*Beijing ([[:zh:\u4e1c\u76f4\u95e8\u5185\u5927\u8857|Ghost Street]] {{in lang|zh}}) {{TAR clue|Detour|Waiter|Wheel}}\n*Beijing ([http://www.wzsfeet.com/ Wuzhisheng Foot Reflection Health Center])\n*Beijing ([[Marco Polo Bridge]])\n*{{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who can crack the warrior code?}} Beijing ([[Great Wall of China]] \u2013 [[Mutianyu]])\n*Beijing ([[Forbidden City]] \u2013 [[Imperial Ancestral Temple|T\u00e0imi\u00e0o Temple]]) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop Pacific|11}}\n\nThe Detour was a choice between Waiter or Wheel. In Waiter, teams had to take food orders from customers in a restaurant in [[Mandarin Chinese]] and recite each order to the chef. If they pronounced the orders correctly, the chef would give them the meals to serve to the customers. Once every customer on the table received their meal, teams would receive their next clue. In Wheel, teams had to spin a wheel with different [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese delicacies]] on it and completely eat the dish the wheel stopped on. After each team member ate two dishes, they would receive their next clue.\n\nIn this Roadblock, one team member had to figure out how to pass through nine rows of warriors, who were guarding their next clue. In each row of warriors, only one warrior would let them through and the others would block them. If the team member was blocked by a warrior three times, they would have to go back to the first row and start again. Once they passed through all nine rows, they would receive their next clue.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*On Ghost Street, teams had to find a marked stall for their next clue.\n*At Wuzhisheng Foot Reflection Health Center, each team member had to endure a continuous ten-minute [[foot massage]], five minutes for each foot, to receive the next clue. In the event teams were unable to bear the painful part of the massage, they would tap one side of their chair and say \"uncle\" to signal the masseuse to stop; however, the consequence of doing so would result in restarting the massage from the beginning. \n*At Marco Polo Bridge, teams had to count the number of [[Chinese guardian lions|lion head]] statues. Once teams provided the correct number (446), they would receive their next clue.\n\n===Leg 12 (China \u2192 Australia)===\n[[File:Fraser Island a05 lake mckenzie.jpg|thumb|[[Lake McKenzie]] located in [[Fraser Island]], was the location of the final Roadblock and the Finish Line of the Race.]]\n'''Airdate''': 15 August 2012\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} Beijing (Beijing Capital International Airport) to [[Guilin]] ([[Guilin Liangjiang International Airport]])\n*Guilin ([[:zh:\u6842\u6e56 (\u6842\u6797)|Guihu Lake]] {{in lang|zh}})\n*Guilin ([[Li River|Lijiang River]])\n*{{TAR clue|Detour|Teach|Learn}} [[Yangshuo County]] (Kindergarten School)\n*[[Baisha, Yangshuo County|Baisha]] (Baisha Market)\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} Guilin (Guilin Liangjiang International Airport) to [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]] {{flagicon|Queensland}}, '''Australia''' {{flagicon|AUS}} ([[Brisbane Airport]])\n*Brisbane ([[Kangaroo Point, Queensland|Kangaroo Point]] \u2013 [https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/things-to-see-and-do/council-venues-and-precincts/parks/using-council-parks/park-bookings-and-consents/designated-sites-for-park-bookings/captain-burke-park-kangaroo-point Captain Burke Park])\n*Brisbane ([[Dutton Park, Queensland|Dutton Park]] \u2013 [[Boggo Road Gaol]])\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} Brisbane ([[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]] \u2013 [[Archerfield Airport]]) to [[Fraser Island]] (75 Mile Beach)\n*Fraser Island ([[Lake McKenzie]]) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who has total recall?}} {{TAR clue|Pit Stop Pacific}}\n\nThe final Detour of the ''Race'' required teams to travel to a Kindergarten School in [[Yangshuo County]] to complete either Teach or Learn. In Teach, teams had to choose one of the Kindergarten students and teach them 10 [[Australian English vocabulary|Australian slang words]]. Once their student correctly recited all 10 words to the teacher, teams would receive their next clue. In Learn, teams had to choose one of the Kindergarten students who would teach them how to say the same 10 Australian slang words in Mandarin Chinese. If teams recited all 10 words correctly to the teacher, they would receive their next clue.\n\nIn the final Roadblock of the ''Race'', one team member had to wade out to clue boxes in the lake which each contained a multiple choice question based on previous experiences on the ''Race''. Then they had to place coloured rings around the clue boxes which corresponded to the correct answer. If they got the questions right (5 were shown, but 7 clue boxes were present), they would receive the final clue.\n\n:{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Question\n!colspan=2|Answer\n|-\n!The famous nightclub you visited upon arrival in Havana is called:\n|style=\"background: #595647;\"|{{white|C}}\n|Tropicana\n|-\n!The famous cooking school you attended in Paris was:\n|style=\"background: #D39644;\"|{{white|B}}\n|Le Cordon Bleu\n|-\n!In Istanbul you scrubbed each other down.

If a team asked the wrong fisherman for the clue, they would be given a fish instead.\n*At Baisha Market, teams had to locate a marked stall and convince 10 locals to buy a vegetable slicer for no less than [[Renminbi|\u00a5]]5 each, to receive their next clue.\n*Upon arrival in Brisbane, teams had to search the airport car park for a marked vehicle containing their next clue, sending them to [[Kangaroo Point, Queensland|Kangaroo Point]], where they had to find Captain Burke Park to retrieve their next clue.\n*At Boggo Road Gaol, one team member was locked in a cell while the other team member had to answer five questions about the teams of the ''Race''. The questions were:\n:*Which team would lend you a helping hand?\n:*Which team would lie to you?\n:*Which team worked best together?\n:*Whose relationship do you envy?\n:*Which was the unluckiest team?\n:Then that team member was locked in a cell while their teammate had to answer the same five questions. If both team members answers were a perfect match, they would receive their next clue.\n*At Archerfield Airport, teams had to board a charter flight to their final destination: [[Fraser Island]]. Once in Fraser Island, teams had to drive themselves to 75 Mile Beach for their next clue.\n*After completing the Roadblock, teams had to dig up a treasure chest containing A$250,000 within a marked area and carry it to the nearby Finish Line.\n\n;Additional note\n*During the Pit Stop, all teams flew from Beijing to [[Guilin]] and began the final leg of the ''Race'' at Guihu

The idea behind iMUSE is to synchronize music with the visual action in a video game so that the audio continuously matches the on-screen events and transitions from one musical theme to another are done seamlessly.<ref name=\"1UP.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/features/imuse-secret-organic-music |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124035050/http://www.1up.com/features/imuse-secret-organic-music |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-24 |title=iMUSE and the Secret of Organic Music |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2013-08-28 }}</ref><ref name=\"Sweet 2012\"/> iMUSE was developed in the early 1990s by composers [[Michael Land]] and [[Peter McConnell]] while working at [[LucasArts]]. The iMUSE system is [[patent]]ed by LucasArts,<ref>{{ cite patent |country=US |number=5315057|status=patent| title =  Method and apparatus for dynamically composing music and sound effects using a computer entertainment system | invent1 = LAND MICHAEL Z [US]; MCCONNELL PETER N [US] | assign1 = LUCASARTS ENTERTAINMENT CO [US] }}</ref> and was added to the fifth version of the [[SCUMM]] game engine in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/SCUMM/Versions |title=SCUMM Versions |publisher=[[ScummVM]] |date=2005-04-10 |accessdate=2013-08-28}}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n\niMUSE was developed out of [[Michael Land]]'s frustration for the audio system used by LucasArts while composing ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]''. His goal was to create a system which would enable the composer to set the mood via music according to the events of the game. The project was much more daring than he had imagined. He brought in an old friend, [[Peter McConnell]], to collaborate on creating the system, which they later patented together.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mixnmojo.com/features/sitefeatures/LucasArts-Secret-History-Monkey-Island-2-LeChucks-Revenge/9 |title=LucasArts' Secret History: Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge - The Music of LeChuck's Revenge |date=2008-08-04 |accessdate=2013-08-28 |publisher=[[The International House of Mojo]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Sweet 2012\"/> iMUSE was also found to be useful to account for differences in processing speed between personal computers at the time, as there was no direct means of synchronizing sound with gameplay rendering.

It is used throughout the [[United Kingdom]] to pass the details of stranded motorists between all the major UK motoring organisations and their 500 plus [[vehicle recovery]] agents. In many cases it is also used by the vehicle recovery agent to pass the details to the attending recovery vehicle.\n\n==History==\n[[File:TDold.jpg|thumb|right|The very first standards meeting in 1994 (Boys with their Toys)]]\nOn 30 June 1994, a group of representatives from the UK seven major motoring organisations and the Institute of Vehicle Recovery were invited a meeting at [[Brooklands Museum]]. Brooklands Museum was chosen as the venue because the meeting's chairman Andy Lambert was involved with the museum, having transported the vast majority of the exhibits there, and could therefore show people items they would not normally get to see. He clearly hoped that this would be enough incentive to get \u2018the clubs\u2019 to sit-down in the same room together. It soon emerged that it was a shared dream of all those present that \u2018common standards\u2019 for all aspects of [[vehicle recovery]] could be introduced to the industry. Amongst other things, this group laid the foundations of Turbo Dispatch project.\n\nBecause of the reliability of delivery needed it was decided that [[Mobitex]] should be used. In the UK there was only one provider of Mobitex, namely RAM Data, which later became a subsidiary of [[British Telecom|BT]] called Transcomm. This is why many users still refer to RAMing jobs. Ian Lane of Motor Trade Software (MTS) designed and wrote the protocols along with the [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]] software.  Much pioneering work was carried out during early 1995. In the autumn of 1995 [[Green Flag]] and Delta Rescue were the first motoring organisations to start experimenting with transmissions to the [[Automobile repair shop|garages]], with the first genuine job being sent to Southbank Garage at the end of the year.\n\nThe point where most recovery operators learned about Turbo Dispatch was during the Association of Vehicle Recovery Operators' AVRO EX 1996. Despite it being [[Green Flag]]'s 25th Anniversary, the motoring organisation set up a mini \u2018Control Room\u2019 at the show and let people see for the first time how the system worked. By the end of that year [[the Automobile Association]] had set up a trial in London, sending jobs to selected recovery operators.\n\nTowards the end of 1997, the AA's Evan Anderson became greatly involved in promoting the concept of Turbo Dispatch within the AA. This was undoubtedly the turning point, because Evan seemed to accept that although MTS and RAM did have a monopoly, it was not an intentional one. Anyone else could develop a system, but quite simply nobody else had successfully done so.\n\nIn the following year, the [[RAC plc|RAC]] went live and by the end of the year all the major players in the industry had adopted Turbo Dispatch. By the year 2005 it is estimated that around 92% of the 4 million \u2018garaged\u2019 breakdowns a year were sent to recovery operators using Turbo Dispatch.\n\nThe system is clearly popular with motoring organisations, because of the saving in job dispatcher talking on the telephone to recovery operators. What surprised a lot of people was how popular it was with the operators as well, mainly for the same reasons. A busy controller does not want to take job details over the telephone, when he can have it appear on his computer screen. Because he could then use the same system to dispatch the job to his driver, it meant the whole process could be handled in seconds.\n\n==Technical review==\nThe following notes describe the method of automatically transferring job details from a motoring organisation (or club's) computer into their recovery operator's computer using the Mobitex data network. Since each of the motoring organisations is likely to have its own unique computer system and working practices, it is not practical to attempt to define how automatic job transfer would be best achieved for them. Consequently, only a typical recovery operator's computer installation is defined below.\n\nTypically, the recovery operator job logging and invoicing system is based around a [[personal computer]]. This will be connected to the Mobitex data network by a Masc.{{clarify|date=January 2012}} [[radio modem]] (sometimes called a Mobidem) using one of the PC's [[RS-232]] communication ports. Job transmission will entail the motoring organisation's computer using the recovery operator's unique Mobidem number to call his computer.\n\nOnce a connection has been made the job details are transmitted in the data format defined in the Turbo Dispatch Format Manual, and the call terminated. A dedicated communications computer will usually be employed to constantly monitor the radio modem via the RS232 port. This will operate a program TD.EXE, running under [[Windows]]. Data received from the radio modem will be transferred to an incoming message queue on the other computer, for subsequent automatic processing by the main job taking software (a maximum of 5 seconds delay). An audible sound will also be generated by the communications computer.\n\nImmediately the job details are received by the recovery operator's communications computer, it will transmit an  automatic acknowledgement to the origin of the job message and place the job details in a queue awaiting manual acceptance by the recovery operator's controller. Job Dispatch will be completed by the recovery operator's controller, either by accepting, or rejecting the job and the corresponding transaction being dispatched to the motoring organisation.\n\nThe Turbo Dispatch application was initially restricted to employing the MASC protocol of the Transcomm Mobile Data Network.

It is used throughout the [[United Kingdom]] to pass the details of stranded motorists between all the major UK motoring organisations and their 500 plus [[vehicle recovery]] agents. In many cases it is also used by the vehicle recovery agent to pass the details to the attending recovery vehicle.\n\n==History==\n[[File:TDold.jpg|thumb|right|The very first standards meeting in 1994 (Boys with their Toys)]]\nOn 30 June 1994, a group of representatives from the UK seven major motoring organisations and the Institute of Vehicle Recovery were invited a meeting at [[Brooklands Museum]]. Brooklands Museum was chosen as the venue because the meeting's chairman Andy Lambert was involved with the museum, having transported the vast majority of the exhibits there, and could therefore show people items they would not normally get to see. He clearly hoped that this would be enough incentive to get \u2018the clubs\u2019 to sit-down in the same room together. It soon emerged that it was a shared dream of all those present that \u2018common standards\u2019 for all aspects of [[vehicle recovery]] could be introduced to the industry. Amongst other things, this group laid the foundations of Turbo Dispatch project.\n\nBecause of the reliability of delivery needed it was decided that [[Mobitex]] should be used. In the UK there was only one provider of Mobitex, namely RAM Data, which later became a subsidiary of [[British Telecom|BT]] called Transcomm. This is why many users still refer to RAMing jobs. Ian Lane of Motor Trade Software (MTS) designed and wrote the protocols along with the [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]] software.  Much pioneering work was carried out during early 1995. In the autumn of 1995 [[Green Flag]] and Delta Rescue were the first motoring organisations to start experimenting with transmissions to the [[Automobile repair shop|garages]], with the first genuine job being sent to Southbank Garage at the end of the year.\n\nThe point where most recovery operators learned about Turbo Dispatch was during the Association of Vehicle Recovery Operators' AVRO EX 1996. Despite it being [[Green Flag]]'s 25th Anniversary, the motoring organisation set up a mini \u2018Control Room\u2019 at the show and let people see for the first time how the system worked. By the end of that year [[the Automobile Association]] had set up a trial in London, sending jobs to selected recovery operators.\n\nTowards the end of 1997, the AA's Evan Anderson became greatly involved in promoting the concept of Turbo Dispatch within the AA. This was undoubtedly the turning point, because Evan seemed to accept that although MTS and RAM did have a monopoly, it was not an intentional one. Anyone else could develop a system, but quite simply nobody else had successfully done so.\n\nIn the following year, the [[RAC plc|RAC]] went live and by the end of the year all the major players in the industry had adopted Turbo Dispatch. By the year 2005 it is estimated that around 92% of the 4 million \u2018garaged\u2019 breakdowns a year were sent to recovery operators using Turbo Dispatch.\n\nThe system is clearly popular with motoring organisations, because of the saving in job dispatcher talking on the telephone to recovery operators. What surprised a lot of people was how popular it was with the operators as well, mainly for the same reasons. A busy controller does not want to take job details over the telephone, when he can have it appear on his computer screen. Because he could then use the same system to dispatch the job to his driver, it meant the whole process could be handled in seconds.\n\n==Technical review==\nThe following notes describe the method of automatically transferring job details from a motoring organisation (or club's) computer into their recovery operator's computer using the Mobitex data network. Since each of the motoring organisations is likely to have its own unique computer system and working practices, it is not practical to attempt to define how automatic job transfer would be best achieved for them. Consequently, only a typical recovery operator's computer installation is defined below.\n\nTypically, the recovery operator job logging and invoicing system is based around a [[personal computer]]. This will be connected to the Mobitex data network by a Masc.{{clarify|date=January 2012}} [[radio modem]] (sometimes called a Mobidem) using one of the PC's [[RS-232]] communication ports. Job transmission will entail the motoring organisation's computer using the recovery operator's unique Mobidem number to call his computer.\n\nOnce a connection has been made the job details are transmitted in the data format defined in the Turbo Dispatch Format Manual, and the call terminated. A dedicated communications computer will usually be employed to constantly monitor the radio modem via the RS232 port. This will operate a program TD.EXE, running under [[Windows]]. Data received from the radio modem will be transferred to an incoming message queue on the other computer, for subsequent automatic processing by the main job taking software (a maximum of 5 seconds delay). An audible sound will also be generated by the communications computer.\n\nImmediately the job details are received by the recovery operator's communications computer, it will transmit an  automatic acknowledgement to the origin of the job message and place the job details in a queue awaiting manual acceptance by the recovery operator's controller. Job Dispatch will be completed by the recovery operator's controller, either by accepting, or rejecting the job and the corresponding transaction being dispatched to the motoring organisation.\n\nThe Turbo Dispatch application was initially restricted to employing the MASC protocol of the Transcomm Mobile Data Network. This [[communications protocol|protocol]] was  adopted because it eliminates the complexity of retries which would result from employing a session based protocol on the radio modems e.g. [[Hayes Microcomputer Products|Hayes]] or [[X.28]].\n\n==Control==\n[[File:TDtoday.jpg|thumb|right|Delegates at a standards meeting 2006 at BT Transcomm's Heathrow headquarters]]\nThe Turbo Dispatch Standards Group used to meet on average two or three times a year.\nIts brief was to \"Maintain a common standard for message and data formats to be used in electronic data communications between host computers and/or data terminals in fixed/mobile environments\".\n\nAll major motoring organisations send representatives and all changes/additions to the standard are discussed and must be agreed by all those present at the meeting.

He is best known for playing the lead in ''[[Johnny Got His Gun (film)|Johnny Got His Gun]]''; Sonny Crawford in ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' where he and his fellow co-stars, [[Cybill Shepherd]] and [[Jeff Bridges]], rose to fame; as James Hart, the first-year law student who battles with Prof. Kingsfield, in the film adaptation ''[[The Paper Chase (film)|The Paper Chase]]''; and for playing President [[George W. Bush]] multiple times, including on the [[sitcom]] ''[[That's My Bush!]]'' and in the comedy film ''[[The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course]]'' and the [[docudrama]] ''[[DC 9/11: Time of Crisis]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nBottoms was born in [[Santa Barbara, California]], the eldest of four sons of Betty ([[married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Chapman) and James \"Bud\" Bottoms, who is a sculptor and art teacher. \n\nHe is the eldest brother of actors [[Joseph Bottoms]] (born 1954), [[Sam Bottoms]] (1955\u20132008) and [[Ben Bottoms]] (born 1960). In 1967, Bottoms toured [[Europe]] as part of the Santa Barbara Madrigal Society.\n\nSam Bottoms died from brain cancer in 2008.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nndb.com/people/379/000173857/|title=Sam Bottoms| website=[[NNDB]]| accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref> At one point, Sam was the only sibling close to Timothy.<ref name=people/> \n\nBottoms married twice.  His first marriage to folksinger Alicia Cory in 1975 produced one son Bartholomew, before ending in divorce in 1978.  His second marriage to Marcia Moreheart in 1984 produced three children:  Bodie, Bridget, and Benton.<ref name=people/>\n\n==Career==\nBottoms made his film debut in 1971 as Joe Bonham in [[Dalton Trumbo]]'s ''[[Johnny Got His Gun (film)|Johnny Got His Gun]]''. The same year, he appeared alongside his brother Sam in ''[[The Last Picture Show]]''. (He portrayed the same character in the 1990 sequel ''[[Texasville]]''). In 1973's [[The Paper Chase (film)|''The Paper Chase'']], he starred as [[Harvard]] law student Hart facing the fearsome Professor Kingsfield ([[John Houseman]]).  Among the other films he has appeared in are ''[[Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing]] ''(1973), ''[[The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder]]'' (1974), ''[[Operation Daybreak]]'' (1975), ''[[A Small Town in Texas]]'' (1976), ''[[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|Rollercoaster]]'' (1977) ''[[Hurricane (1979 film)|Hurricane]]'' (1979), ''[[Invaders from Mars (1986 film)|Invaders from Mars]]'' (1986) and ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]] ''(2003).\n\nBottoms has portrayed [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] in three widely varying productions. In 2000\u20132001, he played a parody of Bush in the [[Comedy Central]] [[sitcom]] ''[[That's My Bush!]]''; he subsequently appeared as Bush in a cameo appearance in the family film ''[[The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course]]''. Finally, following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Bottoms once again played Bush, this time in a serious fashion, in the telefilm ''[[DC 9/11]]'', one of the first movies to be based upon the attacks.\n\nDuring an episode of the Fox television show ''[[That '70s Show]]'' in which a [[tornado]] warning has been issued and the students of the high school are trapped, Bottoms is seen as the panicking principal. He appeared in a recurring role during the first season of the [[FX Network|FX]] series ''[[Dirt (TV series)|Dirt]]'' as Gibson Horne, who owned the magazine that series main character [[Lucy Spiller]] worked for.\n\nHe also co-produced the documentary ''Picture This \u2013 The Times of Peter Bogdanovich in Archer City, Texas'' (1991), a behind-the-scenes work about the making of the films ''The Last Picture Show'' and ''Texasville''. In the documentary, he revealed that he had a crush on his co-star [[Cybill Shepherd]] during ''The Last Picture Show,'' but she did not reciprocate his romantic feelings, even though she said in a separate interview that she found him \"very attractive\".<ref>{{cite magazine| url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/picture-perfect-2/| title=Picture Perfect| date=February 1999| magazine=[[Texas Monthly]]| accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref> He was also heavily featured in the [[Metallica]] video for \"[[one (Metallica song)|One]]\", which featured footage of the film ''Johnny Got His Gun''.\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Johnny Got His Gun (film)|Johnny Got His Gun]]'' (1971) as Joe Bonham\n* ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' (1971) as Sonny Crawford\n* ''[[Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing]]'' (1973) as Walter Elbertson\n* ''[[The Paper Chase (film)|The Paper Chase]]'' (1973) as Hart\n* ''[[The White Dawn]]'' (1974) as Daggett\n* ''[[The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder]]'' (1974) as Vrooder\n* ''[[Operation Daybreak]]'' (1975) as Jan Kubis\n* ''[[A Small Town in Texas]]'' (1976) as Poke Jackson\n* ''[[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|Rollercoaster]]'' (1977) as Young Man\n* ''[[The Other Side of the Mountain Part 2]]'' (1978) as John Boothe\n* ''[[Hurricane (1979 film)|Hurricane]]'' (1979) as Jack Sanford\n* ''[[The High Country]]'' (1981) as Jim\n* ''[[Tin Man (1983 film)|Tin Man]]'' (1983) as Casey\n* ''[[Hambone and Hillie]]'' (1983) as Michael Radcliffe\n* ''[[The Census Taker]]'' (1984) as Pete\n* ''[[What Waits Below]]'' (1984) as Maj.

He is best known for playing the lead in ''[[Johnny Got His Gun (film)|Johnny Got His Gun]]''; Sonny Crawford in ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' where he and his fellow co-stars, [[Cybill Shepherd]] and [[Jeff Bridges]], rose to fame; as James Hart, the first-year law student who battles with Prof. Kingsfield, in the film adaptation ''[[The Paper Chase (film)|The Paper Chase]]''; and for playing President [[George W. Bush]] multiple times, including on the [[sitcom]] ''[[That's My Bush!]]'' and in the comedy film ''[[The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course]]'' and the [[docudrama]] ''[[DC 9/11: Time of Crisis]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nBottoms was born in [[Santa Barbara, California]], the eldest of four sons of Betty ([[married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Chapman) and James \"Bud\" Bottoms, who is a sculptor and art teacher. \n\nHe is the eldest brother of actors [[Joseph Bottoms]] (born 1954), [[Sam Bottoms]] (1955\u20132008) and [[Ben Bottoms]] (born 1960). In 1967, Bottoms toured [[Europe]] as part of the Santa Barbara Madrigal Society.\n\nSam Bottoms died from brain cancer in 2008.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nndb.com/people/379/000173857/|title=Sam Bottoms| website=[[NNDB]]| accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref> At one point, Sam was the only sibling close to Timothy.<ref name=people/> \n\nBottoms married twice.  His first marriage to folksinger Alicia Cory in 1975 produced one son Bartholomew, before ending in divorce in 1978.  His second marriage to Marcia Moreheart in 1984 produced three children:  Bodie, Bridget, and Benton.<ref name=people/>\n\n==Career==\nBottoms made his film debut in 1971 as Joe Bonham in [[Dalton Trumbo]]'s ''[[Johnny Got His Gun (film)|Johnny Got His Gun]]''. The same year, he appeared alongside his brother Sam in ''[[The Last Picture Show]]''. (He portrayed the same character in the 1990 sequel ''[[Texasville]]''). In 1973's [[The Paper Chase (film)|''The Paper Chase'']], he starred as [[Harvard]] law student Hart facing the fearsome Professor Kingsfield ([[John Houseman]]).  Among the other films he has appeared in are ''[[Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing]] ''(1973), ''[[The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder]]'' (1974), ''[[Operation Daybreak]]'' (1975), ''[[A Small Town in Texas]]'' (1976), ''[[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|Rollercoaster]]'' (1977) ''[[Hurricane (1979 film)|Hurricane]]'' (1979), ''[[Invaders from Mars (1986 film)|Invaders from Mars]]'' (1986) and ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]] ''(2003).\n\nBottoms has portrayed [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] in three widely varying productions. In 2000\u20132001, he played a parody of Bush in the [[Comedy Central]] [[sitcom]] ''[[That's My Bush!]]''; he subsequently appeared as Bush in a cameo appearance in the family film ''[[The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course]]''. Finally, following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Bottoms once again played Bush, this time in a serious fashion, in the telefilm ''[[DC 9/11]]'', one of the first movies to be based upon the attacks.\n\nDuring an episode of the Fox television show ''[[That '70s Show]]'' in which a [[tornado]] warning has been issued and the students of the high school are trapped, Bottoms is seen as the panicking principal. He appeared in a recurring role during the first season of the [[FX Network|FX]] series ''[[Dirt (TV series)|Dirt]]'' as Gibson Horne, who owned the magazine that series main character [[Lucy Spiller]] worked for.\n\nHe also co-produced the documentary ''Picture This \u2013 The Times of Peter Bogdanovich in Archer City, Texas'' (1991), a behind-the-scenes work about the making of the films ''The Last Picture Show'' and ''Texasville''. In the documentary, he revealed that he had a crush on his co-star [[Cybill Shepherd]] during ''The Last Picture Show,'' but she did not reciprocate his romantic feelings, even though she said in a separate interview that she found him \"very attractive\".<ref>{{cite magazine| url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/picture-perfect-2/| title=Picture Perfect| date=February 1999| magazine=[[Texas Monthly]]| accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref> He was also heavily featured in the [[Metallica]] video for \"[[one (Metallica song)|One]]\", which featured footage of the film ''Johnny Got His Gun''.\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Johnny Got His Gun (film)|Johnny Got His Gun]]'' (1971) as Joe Bonham\n* ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' (1971) as Sonny Crawford\n* ''[[Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing]]'' (1973) as Walter Elbertson\n* ''[[The Paper Chase (film)|The Paper Chase]]'' (1973) as Hart\n* ''[[The White Dawn]]'' (1974) as Daggett\n* ''[[The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder]]'' (1974) as Vrooder\n* ''[[Operation Daybreak]]'' (1975) as Jan Kubis\n* ''[[A Small Town in Texas]]'' (1976) as Poke Jackson\n* ''[[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|Rollercoaster]]'' (1977) as Young Man\n* ''[[The Other Side of the Mountain Part 2]]'' (1978) as John Boothe\n* ''[[Hurricane (1979 film)|Hurricane]]'' (1979) as Jack Sanford\n* ''[[The High Country]]'' (1981) as Jim\n* ''[[Tin Man (1983 film)|Tin Man]]'' (1983) as Casey\n* ''[[Hambone and Hillie]]'' (1983) as Michael Radcliffe\n* ''[[The Census Taker]]'' (1984) as Pete\n* ''[[What Waits Below]]'' (1984) as Maj.
