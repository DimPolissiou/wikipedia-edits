Guides are available for practitioners, and other books aim to provide a theoretical basis and evidence for the practice. Energy medicine often proposes that imbalances in the body's \"energy field\" result in illness and that by re-balancing the body's energy-field health can be restored.<ref name=\"NCCAM\"/> Some modalities describe treatments as ridding the body of negative energies or blockages in 'mind'; illness or episodes of ill health after treatment are referred to as a 'release' or letting go of trauma stored in the body, turbid energy or a 'contraction' in the body-mind. Usually, a practitioner will then recommend further treatments for complete healing.\n\nThe US-based ''[[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]]'' (NCCIH) distinguishes between health care involving scientifically observable energy, which it calls \"Veritable Energy Medicine\", and health care methods that invoke physically undetectable or unverifiable [[energy (esotericism)|\"energies\"]], which it calls \"Putative Energy Medicine\":<ref name=NCCAM>{{cite web | year=2005 | url=http://nccih.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/energymed.htm | title=Energy Medicine: An Overview | author=National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health}}</ref>\n\n* Types of \"veritable energy medicine\" include [[magnet therapy]], [[colorpuncture]], and [[light therapy]]. Medical techniques involving the use of electromagnetic radiation (''e.g.'' [[radiation therapy]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]]) are not considered \"energy medicine\" in the terms of alternative medicine.\n* Types of \"putative energy medicine\" include biofield energy healing therapies where the hands are claimed to direct or modulate \"energies\" which are believed to effect healing in the patient;<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Warber, S.

Guides are available for practitioners, and other books aim to provide a theoretical basis and evidence for the practice. Energy medicine often proposes that imbalances in the body's \"energy field\" result in illness, and that by re-balancing the body's energy-field health can be restored.<ref name=\"NCCAM\"/> Some modalities describe treatments as ridding the body of negative energies or blockages in 'mind'; illness or episodes of ill health after a treatment are referred to as a 'release' or letting go of a 'contraction' in the body-mind. Usually, a practitioner will then recommend further treatments for complete healing.\n\nThe US-based ''[[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]]'' (NCCIH) distinguishes between health care involving scientifically observable energy, which it calls \"Veritable Energy Medicine\", and health care methods that invoke physically undetectable or unverifiable [[energy (esotericism)|\"energies\"]], which it calls \"Putative Energy Medicine\":<ref name=NCCAM>{{cite web | year=2005 | url=http://nccih.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/energymed.htm | title=Energy Medicine: An Overview | author=National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health}}</ref>\n\n* Types of \"veritable energy medicine\" include [[magnet therapy]], [[colorpuncture]], and [[light therapy]]. Medical techniques involving the use of electromagnetic radiation (''e.g.'' [[radiation therapy]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]]) are not considered \"energy medicine\" in the terms of alternative medicine.\n* Types of \"putative energy medicine\" include biofield energy healing therapies where the hands are claimed to direct or modulate \"energies\" which are believed to effect healing in the patient;<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Warber, S.

Lynch hated playing them right up until his departure from the band, saying it made him feel like he was in a cover band.\n\nThe recording process in 1988 was a low-key affair, with many of Petty's friends contributing, including the members of the [[Traveling Wilburys]], minus [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name=\"RS\"/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.spin.com/featured/tom-petty-full-moon-fever-interview-cover-story/|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|title=Tom Petty\u2019s 1989 Full Moon Fever Cover Story: Raised on Promises|date=August 1989|first=Michael|last=Corcoran}}</ref> Recorded mainly in the relaxed atmosphere of [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]]'s garage studio, Petty would later say it was the most enjoyable record of his career.<ref name=\"The Editors\">{{cite magazine|title=The 100 Best Albums of the 1980's |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=1989-11-16 |first=|last=The Editors|issue=565 |accessdate=2013-01-27 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-albums-of-the-eighties-20110418/tom-petty-full-moon-fever-20110330}}</ref> Recording of ''Full Moon Fever'' was actually interrupted to allow time for recording of the first Wilburys' album. Two songs recorded during the sessions did not make the ''Full Moon Fever'' album. \"Down the Line\" and \"Don't Treat Me Like A Stranger\" were released as B-sides. During the sessions, Petty wrote \"Indiana Girl\", an early draft of what would eventually become \"[[Mary Jane's Last Dance]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicrockreview.com/2014/04/1989-tom-petty-full-moon-fever/|title=Full Moon Fever by Tom Petty|website=classicrockreview.com}}</ref>\n\n==Musical style and themes==\nThe album is noted for being heavily influenced by Jeff Lynne, resulting in a cleaner and glossier version of the Heartbreakers' roots rock from previous albums.<ref name=\"RS\"/><ref name=\"amrev\"/> Lynne incorporated layers of keyboards and backing vocals, giving it a [[The Beatles|Beatlesque]] feel.<ref name=\"RS\"/><ref name=\"amrev\"/> The songs show Petty paying dues to his influences with a [[Byrds]] cover (\"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\") and a nod to [[Del Shannon]] in \"[[Runnin' Down a Dream]]\".

Lynch hated playing them right up until his departure from the band, saying it made him feel like he was in a cover band.\n\nThe recording process in 1988 was a low-key affair, with many of Petty's friends contributing, including the members of the [[Traveling Wilburys]], minus [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name=\"RS\"/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.spin.com/featured/tom-petty-full-moon-fever-interview-cover-story/|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|title=Tom Petty\u2019s 1989 Full Moon Fever Cover Story: Raised on Promises|date=August 1989|first=Michael|last=Corcoran}}</ref> Recorded mainly in the relaxed atmosphere of [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]]'s garage studio, Petty would later say it was the most enjoyable record of his career.<ref name=\"The Editors\">{{cite magazine|title=The 100 Best Albums of the 1980's |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=1989-11-16 |first=|last=The Editors|issue=565 |accessdate=2013-01-27 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-albums-of-the-eighties-20110418/tom-petty-full-moon-fever-20110330}}</ref> Recording of ''Full Moon Fever'' was actually interrupted to allow time for recording of the first Wilburys' album. Two songs recorded during the sessions did not make the ''Full Moon Fever'' album. \"Down the Line\" and \"Don't Treat Me Like A Stranger\" were released as B-sides.

It is about {{convert|1|mi|km}} wide and {{convert|2|mi|km}} long.

Originally, the area was known as '''Crow Hill.''' It was a succession of hills running east and west from [[Utica Avenue]] to Washington Avenue, and south to Empire Boulevard and [[Jamaica Avenue|East New York Avenue]].<ref>\"[http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Town/Eastern/C.html The Eastern District of Brooklyn]\" by Eugene Armbruster 1912 updated 1941.</ref> The name was changed when Crown Street was cut through in 1916.<ref>\"[http://www.brooklyn.net/neighborhoods/crown_heights.html Crown Heights]\" from the 1939 \"WPA Guide to New York City\"</ref>\n\nThe northern half of Crown Heights is part of [[Brooklyn Community Board 8|Brooklyn Community District 8]] and is patrolled by the 77th Precinct of the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD).<ref name=\"NYCPlanning8\"/><ref name=\"NYPD 77th Precinct\"/> The southern half is part of [[Brooklyn Community Board 9|Brooklyn Community District 9]] and is patrolled by the 71st Precinct of the NYPD.<ref name=\"NYCPlanning9\"/><ref name=\"NYPD 71st Precinct\"/> Crown Heights's primary [[ZIP Code]]s are 11213, 11216, 11233, 11238, and 11225. Politically, it is represented by the [[New York City Council]]'s 35th, 36th, and 41st Districts.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early history ===\nAlthough no known physical evidence remains in the Crown Heights vicinity, large portions of what is now called [[Long Island]] including present-day Brooklyn were occupied by the [[Lenape]], (later renamed [[Delaware Indians]] by the [[European ethnic groups|European]] [[colonists|colonizers]]). The [[Lenape]] lived in communities of bark- or grass-covered [[wigwam]]s, and in their larger settlements\u2014typically located on high ground adjacent to fresh water, and occupied in the fall, winter, and spring\u2014they fished, harvested shellfish, trapped animals, gathered wild fruits and vegetables, and cultivated corn, tobacco, beans, and other crops.\n\nThe first recorded contact between the indigenous people of the New York City region and [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] was with the Italian explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in 1524 in the service of France when he anchored at the approximate location where the [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]] touches down in [[Brooklyn]] today. There he was visited by a [[canoe]] party of [[Lenape]]. The next contact was in 1609 when the explorer [[Henry Hudson]] arrived in what is now [[New York Harbor]] aboard a [[Dutch East India Company]] ship, the ''[[Halve Maen]]'' ''([[Half Moon (ship)|Half Moon]])'' commissioned by the [[Dutch Republic]].\n\n[[European ethnic groups|European]] habitation in the New York City area began in earnest with the founding of a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[fur trade|fur trading]] settlement, later called ''\"Nieuw Amsterdam\"'' ([[New Amsterdam]]), on the southern tip of [[Manhattan]] in 1614. By 1630, Dutch and English colonists started moving into the western end of [[Long Island]].

The area benefited by having its rapid transit in a subway configuration, the [[IRT Eastern Parkway Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Eastern center}}), in contrast to many other Brooklyn neighborhoods, which had elevated lines.  Conversion to a [[commuter town]] also included tearing down the 19th century Kings County Penitentiary at Carroll Street and Nostrand Avenue.<ref>[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/189979/community/posse/ Brooklyn Museum open collection] Crow Hill Penitentiary gate</ref>\n\nBeginning in the early 1900s, many upper-class residences, including characteristic [[brownstone]] buildings, were erected along Eastern Parkway. Away from the parkway were a mixture of lower middle-class residences. This development peaked in the 1920s. Before [[World War II]] Crown Heights was among New York City's premier neighborhoods, with tree-lined streets, an array of cultural institutions and parks, and numerous fraternal, social and community organizations.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n[[File:Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn jeh.JPG|thumb|right|The former Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn, now an apartment house]]\n\nFrom the early 1920s through the 1960s, Crown Heights was an overwhelmingly white neighborhood and predominantly Jewish.<ref name=\":0\" /> Population changes began in the 1920s with newcomers from Jamaica and the West Indies, as well as African Americans from the South. In 1950, the neighborhood was 89 percent white, with some 50 to 60 percent of the white population, or about 75,000 people, being Jewish, and a small, growing black population. By 1957, there were about 25,000 blacks in Crown Heights, making up about one-fourth of the population. Following the end of World War II, suburbanization began to rapidly affect Crown Heights and Brooklyn. Robert Moses expanded the borough\u2019s access to Long Island through expressway construction, and by way of the G.I. Bill, many families moved east. Most of these opportunities were limited to whites. Levittown in Long Island, for example, forbid applications from black families. As the Jewish, Irish and Italian populations of Crown Heights moved out of Brooklyn, black people from the south and immigrants from the Caribbean continued to move there.  The 1957 departure of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the destruction of Ebbets Field for public housing for its black population symbolically served as the end of the old white ethnic Crown Heights<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bums: An oral history of the Brooklyn Dodgers.|last=Golenbock|first=Peter|publisher=Contemporary Books|year=2000|isbn=|location=Lincolnwood, Ill|pages=}}</ref> and in the 1960s the neighborhood experienced mass white flight. The demographic change was astounding; in 1960 the neighborhood was 70% white, by 1970 it was 70% black. The one exception to this pattern was the Lubavitch Hasidic Jews.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Y_iZX71ejZgC&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=jews+%22crown+heights%22+1950%27s&ct=result#PPA92,M1.|title= ''Race And Religion Among the Chosen Peoples of Crown Heights'' By Henry Goldschmidt}}</ref>\n\nThere were thirty-four large synagogues in the neighborhood, including the [[Bobov]], Chovevei Torah, and [[770 Eastern Parkway]], home of the worldwide [[Lubavitch]] movement. There were also three prominent [[Yeshiva]] elementary schools in the neighborhood, Crown Heights Yeshiva on Crown Street, the Yeshiva of Eastern Parkway, and the Reines Talmud Torah.\n\n===Late 20th century===\nThe 1960s and 1970s were a time of turbulent race relations in the area: With increasing poverty in the city, racial conflict plagued some of its neighborhoods, including Crown Heights, with its racially and culturally mixed populations. The neighborhood's relatively large population of Lubavitch Hasidim, at the request of their leader, the Lubavitcher Rebbe [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] stayed in the community after other whites left.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 1964 the [[Labor Day Carnival]] celebrating Caribbean culture was moved to the neighborhood when its license to run in Harlem was revoked. It now attracts between one and three million people and is held on the first Monday in September.\n\nDuring the [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] administration, Crown Heights was declared a [[War on Poverty|primary poverty area]] due to a high unemployment rate, high juvenile and adult crime rate, poor nutrition due to lack of family income, relative absence of job skills and readiness, and a relatively high concentration of elderly residents. Violence broke out several times in the neighborhood during the late 20th century, including during the [[New York City blackout of 1977]]: More than 75 area stores were robbed, and thieves used cars to pull up [[roll-down curtain]]s in front of stores.\n\nIn 1991, there was a three-day outbreak known as the [[Crown Heights Riot]], which started between the neighborhood's [[West Indian]]/[[African American]] and Jewish communities. The riots began on August 19, 1991 after Gavin Cato, the son of two [[Guyanese people|Guyanese]] immigrants, was struck and killed by a car in the motorcade of prominent [[Hasidic]] rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]]. A mob began to attack a Jewish volunteer ambulance, which withdrew. Rumors circulated that the ambulance refused to treat Gavin Cato's injuries while removing members of Schneerson's motorcade instead. Yankel Rosenbaum, a visiting rabbinical student from Australia, was killed in the riot, while Jews and blacks were assaulted, and there was property damage amid rock throwing in the ensuing riots. The riot unveiled long-simmering tensions between the neighborhood's black and Jewish communities, which impacted the [[1993 New York City mayoral election|1993 mayoral race]] and ultimately led to a successful outreach program between black and Jewish leaders that somewhat helped improve race relations in the city.<ref>Edward S.

Crown Heights is bounded by Washington Avenue to the west, [[Atlantic Avenue (New York City)|Atlantic Avenue]] to the north, Ralph Avenue to the east, and Clarkson Avenue/East New York Avenue to the south. It is about {{convert|1|mi|km}} wide and {{convert|2|mi|km}} long. Neighborhoods bordering Crown Heights include [[Prospect Heights, Brooklyn|Prospect Heights]] to the west, [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]] and [[Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn|Prospect Lefferts Gardens]] to the south, [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]] to the east, and [[Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford-Stuyvesant]] to the north.\n\nThe main thoroughfare through this neighborhood is [[Eastern Parkway]], a tree-lined boulevard designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] extending {{convert|2|mi|abbr=off}} east\u2013west. Originally, the area was known as '''Crow Hill.''' It was a succession of hills running east and west from [[Utica Avenue]] to Washington Avenue, and south to Empire Boulevard and [[Jamaica Avenue|East New York Avenue]].<ref>\"[http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Town/Eastern/C.html The Eastern District of Brooklyn]\" by Eugene Armbruster 1912 updated 1941.</ref> The name was changed when Crown Street was cut through in 1916.<ref>\"[http://www.brooklyn.net/neighborhoods/crown_heights.html Crown Heights]\" from the 1939 \"WPA Guide to New York City\"</ref>\n\nThe northern half of Crown Heights is part of [[Brooklyn Community Board 8|Brooklyn Community District 8]] and is patrolled by the 77th Precinct of the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD).<ref name=\"NYCPlanning8\"/><ref name=\"NYPD 77th Precinct\"/> The southern half is part of [[Brooklyn Community Board 9|Brooklyn Community District 9]] and is patrolled by the 71st Precinct of the NYPD.<ref name=\"NYCPlanning9\"/><ref name=\"NYPD 71st Precinct\"/> Crown Heights's primary [[ZIP Code]]s are 11213, 11216, 11233, 11238, and 11225. Politically, it is represented by the [[New York City Council]]'s 35th, 36th, and 41st Districts.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early history ===\nAlthough no known physical evidence remains in the Crown Heights vicinity, large portions of what is now called [[Long Island]] including present-day Brooklyn were occupied by the [[Lenape]], (later renamed [[Delaware Indians]] by the [[European ethnic groups|European]] [[colonists|colonizers]]). The [[Lenape]] lived in communities of bark- or grass-covered [[wigwam]]s, and in their larger settlements\u2014typically located on high ground adjacent to fresh water, and occupied in the fall, winter, and spring\u2014they fished, harvested shellfish, trapped animals, gathered wild fruits and vegetables, and cultivated corn, tobacco, beans, and other crops.\n\nThe first recorded contact between the indigenous people of the New York City region and [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] was with the Italian explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in 1524 in the service of France when he anchored at the approximate location where the [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]] touches down in [[Brooklyn]] today. There he was visited by a [[canoe]] party of [[Lenape]]. The next contact was in 1609 when the explorer [[Henry Hudson]] arrived in what is now [[New York Harbor]] aboard a [[Dutch East India Company]] ship, the ''[[Halve Maen]]'' ''([[Half Moon (ship)|Half Moon]])'' commissioned by the [[Dutch Republic]].\n\n[[European ethnic groups|European]] habitation in the New York City area began in earnest with the founding of a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[fur trade|fur trading]] settlement, later called ''\"Nieuw Amsterdam\"'' ([[New Amsterdam]]), on the southern tip of [[Manhattan]] in 1614. By 1630, Dutch and English colonists started moving into the western end of [[Long Island]]. In 1637, Joris Jansen de Rapalje<ref>\"[http://theojanssen.ca/database/n1258.html Notes for: Jan Joris Jansen (Rapalje) De_Rapalie]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\" from the Janssen Verheul families in Canada and Holland database</ref> purchased about {{convert|335|acre|km2}} around [[Wallabout Bay]] and over the following two years, director Kieft of the [[Dutch West India Company]] purchased title to nearly all the land in what is now [[Brooklyn|Kings County]] and [[Queens|Queens County]] from the indigenous inhabitants.\n\nFinally, the areas around present-day Crown Heights saw its first [[European ethnic groups|European]] settlements starting in about 1661/1662 when several men each received, from [[Pieter Stuyvesant|Governor Peter Stuyvesant]] and the [[Board of directors|directors]] of the [[Dutch West India Company]] what was described as \u201ca parcel of free (unoccupied) woodland there\u201d on the condition that they situate their houses \u201cwithin one of the other concentration, which would suit them best, but not to make a hamlet.\u201d<ref>\"[http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/CHN_report.pdf Crown Heights North Historic District: Designation Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025182900/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/CHN_report.pdf |date=October 25, 2007 }}\" prepared by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission April 24, 2007 (pdf)</ref><ref>\"[http://www.brooklynsoc.org/PLG/selfandcommunity/ch3-1.html Chapter 3.1: Woodland to City Neighborhood: 300 Years of Change]\" by Jerome Krase, [[Brooklyn College]] Sociology Department ''\"Self and Community in the City\"'', University Press of America 1982</ref>\n\n=== Early and mid-20th century ===\n[[File:Imperial Apts Bedford Pacific jeh.jpg|thumb|left|Imperial Apartments on Bedford Avenue, built in 1892]]\n\nCrown Heights had begun as a fashionable residential neighborhood, a place for secondary homes in which Manhattan's growing [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] class could reside. The area benefited by having its rapid transit in a subway configuration, the [[IRT Eastern Parkway Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Eastern center}}), in contrast to many other Brooklyn neighborhoods, which had elevated lines.  Conversion to a [[commuter town]] also included tearing down the 19th century Kings County Penitentiary at Carroll Street and Nostrand Avenue.<ref>[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/189979/community/posse/ Brooklyn Museum open collection] Crow Hill Penitentiary gate</ref>\n\nBeginning in the early 1900s, many upper-class residences, including characteristic [[brownstone]] buildings, were erected along Eastern Parkway. Away from the parkway were a mixture of lower middle-class residences. This development peaked in the 1920s. Before [[World War II]] Crown Heights was among New York City's premier neighborhoods, with tree-lined streets, an array of cultural institutions and parks, and numerous fraternal, social and community organizations.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n[[File:Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn jeh.JPG|thumb|right|The former Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn, now an apartment house]]\n\nFrom the early 1920s through the 1960s, Crown Heights was an overwhelmingly white neighborhood and predominantly Jewish.<ref name=\":0\" /> Population changes began in the 1920s with newcomers from Jamaica and the West Indies, as well as African Americans from the South. In 1950, the neighborhood was 89 percent white, with some 50 to 60 percent of the white population, or about 75,000 people, being Jewish, and a small, growing black population. By 1957, there were about 25,000 blacks in Crown Heights, making up about one-fourth of the population. Following the end of World War II, suburbanization began to rapidly affect Crown Heights and Brooklyn. Robert Moses expanded the borough\u2019s access to Long Island through expressway construction, and by way of the G.I. Bill, many families moved east. Most of these opportunities were limited to whites. Levittown in Long Island, for example, forbid applications from black families. As the Jewish, Irish and Italian populations of Crown Heights moved out of Brooklyn, black people from the south and immigrants from the Caribbean continued to move there.  The 1957 departure of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the destruction of Ebbets Field for public housing for its black population symbolically served as the end of the old white ethnic Crown Heights<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bums: An oral history of the Brooklyn Dodgers.|last=Golenbock|first=Peter|publisher=Contemporary Books|year=2000|isbn=|location=Lincolnwood, Ill|pages=}}</ref> and in the 1960s the neighborhood experienced mass white flight. The demographic change was astounding; in 1960 the neighborhood was 70% white, by 1970 it was 70% black. The one exception to this pattern was the Lubavitch Hasidic Jews.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Y_iZX71ejZgC&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=jews+%22crown+heights%22+1950%27s&ct=result#PPA92,M1.|title= ''Race And Religion Among the Chosen Peoples of Crown Heights'' By Henry Goldschmidt}}</ref>\n\nThere were thirty-four large synagogues in the neighborhood, including the [[Bobov]], Chovevei Torah, and [[770 Eastern Parkway]], home of the worldwide [[Lubavitch]] movement. There were also three prominent [[Yeshiva]] elementary schools in the neighborhood, Crown Heights Yeshiva on Crown Street, the Yeshiva of Eastern Parkway, and the Reines Talmud Torah.\n\n=== Late 20th century===\nThe 1960s and 1970s were a time of turbulent race relations in the area: With increasing poverty in the city, racial conflict plagued some of its neighborhoods, including Crown Heights, with its racially and culturally mixed populations. The neighborhood's relatively large population of Lubavitch Hasidim, at the request of their leader, the Lubavitcher Rebbe [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] stayed in the community after other whites left.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 1964 the [[Labor Day Carnival]] celebrating Caribbean culture was moved to the neighborhood when its license to run in Harlem was revoked. It now attracts between one and three million people and is held on the first Monday in September.\n\nDuring the [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] administration, Crown Heights was declared a [[War on Poverty|primary poverty area]] due to a high unemployment rate, high juvenile and adult crime rate, poor nutrition due to lack of family income, relative absence of job skills and readiness, and a relatively high concentration of elderly residents. Violence broke out several times in the neighborhood during the late 20th century, including during the [[New York City blackout of 1977]]: More than 75 area stores were robbed, and thieves used cars to pull up [[roll-down curtain]]s in front of stores.\n\nIn 1991, there was a three-day outbreak known as the [[Crown Heights Riot]], which started between the neighborhood's [[West Indian]]/[[African American]] and Jewish communities. The riots began on August 19, 1991 after Gavin Cato, the son of two [[Guyanese people|Guyanese]] immigrants, was struck and killed by a car in the motorcade of prominent [[Hasidic]] rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]]. A mob began to attack a Jewish volunteer ambulance, which withdrew. Rumors circulated that the ambulance refused to treat Gavin Cato's injuries while removing members of Schneerson's motorcade instead. Yankel Rosenbaum, a visiting rabbinical student from Australia, was killed in the riot, while Jews and blacks were assaulted, and there was property damage amid rock throwing in the ensuing riots. The riot unveiled long-simmering tensions between the neighborhood's black and Jewish communities, which impacted the [[1993 New York City mayoral election|1993 mayoral race]] and ultimately led to a successful outreach program between black and Jewish leaders that somewhat helped improve race relations in the city.<ref>Edward S.
