He described the American preference for the position and called it ''the English-American position''. Discussing [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski|Malinowski's]] ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia'', Kinsey wrote, \"It will be recalled that Malinowski (1929) records the nearly universal use of a totally different position among the [[Trobrianders]]&nbsp;... [and]&nbsp;... that caricatures of the English-American position are performed around&nbsp;... campfires, to the great amusement of the natives who refer to the position as the 'missionary position.'\"<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/> To date, lexicographers and sexologists have not found use of the term ''missionary position'' before Kinsey.<ref>Priest, 30.</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Robert Priest examined the origins of the term and concluded that Kinsey had confused several factors in accidentally coining the term.<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/> First, according to Malinowski, Trobrianders played and sang mocking songs under the full Moon, and not around a campfire. In ''Sexual Behaviors'', Kinsey wrote that the Trobrianders mocked face-to-face man-on-top woman-below intercourse, but does not give context. He mentioned that the position was learned from \"white traders, planters, or officials\", but does not discuss missionaries. Kinsey also recalled that the medieval Catholic Church taught the position, and upon seeing the natives mocking it, assumed that missionaries had taught it to them. Finally, Malinowski wrote that he saw an engaged Trobriand couple holding hands and leaning against each other, which the natives described as ''misinari si bubunela''&nbsp;\u2014 the ''missionary fashion''. Upon accidentally combining these similar facts, Kinsey invented a new phrase despite believing that he was reporting an old one.<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/>\n\nFrom then on, the story of the name's origin may have been retold until it became largely accepted, with its connection to Kinsey and Malinowski having faded. Writers began using the expression for sexual intercourse in the late 1960s, and as [[Alex Comfort]]'s bestseller ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' (1972) and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (1976) spread the term ''missionary position'', it gradually replaced older names.<ref>Priest, 30-31.</ref> By the 1990s, it had spread to other languages: ''Missionarsstellung'' ([[German language|German]]), ''postura del misionero'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), ''missionarishouding'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and ''position du missionaire'' ([[French language|French]]).<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/>\n\nIn [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'' (Act 1, Scene 1), the missionary position was [[euphemism|euphemistically]] called [[Beast with two backs|\"the beast with two backs\"]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=othello&Act=1&Scene=1&Scope=scene|title=Othello, Act I, Scene 1 :-: Open Source Shakespeare|website=www.opensourceshakespeare.org}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\nThough there are a number of variations and adoptions of the missionary position, the classic missionary position involves a man and a woman, with the woman lying on her back and the man on top. Variations in the positions may vary the angle and depth of penile penetration.\n\n===Basic position===\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}\nIn the missionary position, a woman lies on her back on a bed or other surface with her legs comfortably spread with the soles of the feet resting. The penetrating partner may approach the woman on his knees between her spread legs; and either uses his arms to hold himself up, or lets his weight rest on her. When the woman's vagina is sufficiently lubricated, which may involve [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] her [[vulva]] or [[clitoris]] in particular, the man will level his erect penis with her vagina for [[sexual penetration|penetration]], and may use fingers to open the woman's labia and guide the penis in.\n\nWith the penis inside the woman's vagina, the man can control the force, depth, pace, and rhythm of [[Pelvic thrust|thrusts]], and can also control to some extent the female partner's movements. Subject to the man's weight and position, the woman may have some control by pushing her feet and legs against the mattress and by side movements in her pelvis as well as by clutching onto and moving with her partner.<ref name=\"Kar\">{{cite book |first1=Nilamadhab |last1=Kar |first2=Gopal Chandra |last2=Kar| title = Comprehensive Textbook of Sexual Medicine | publisher = [[Jaypee Brothers| Jaypee Brothers Publishers]]|pages=107\u2013108| isbn = 978-8180614057|year=2005| accessdate = February 10, 2014 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=YxcjMPbGHQIC&pg=PA107}}</ref>  A woman can increase the force of a man's thrust by moving against the man's rhythm.\n\nThe man may straddle the woman, taking the woman's legs between his. This restricts and further controls the woman's movements, and the man can increase the tightness on the penis by pressing the woman's thighs together. However, this increases vaginal friction and makes thrusting more difficult.\n\nDuring sexual intercourse, most women experience involuntary [[vaginal contraction]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8174183 |year=1994 |last1=Kratochv\u00edl |first1=S |title=Vaginal contractions in female orgasm |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=28\u201333 |journal=Ceskoslovenska Psychiatrie}}</ref> The contraction causes the [[pelvic muscles]] to tighten around the penis, which increases the level of her partner's arousal and sexual frenzy and results in the man increasing the pace and force of thrusts as he approaches orgasm, which in turn further increases the woman's vaginal contraction. After a man has achieved orgasm, he will normally collapse onto the woman and will normally not be capable of further thrusting. Some men try to control their orgasm until their female partner also orgasms, but this is not always achieved. At times, a woman can achieve orgasm after the man has ceased thrusting by contracting her vaginal muscles and with pelvic movements, or the couple may change to another position that enables the woman to continue thrusting until she has reached orgasm, such as a [[woman on top]] position.\n\nDuring sexual intercourse in the missionary position, the penis is in preferential contact with the [[Anterior#Superior and inferior|anterior]] wall of the vagina and the tip of the penis reaches the [[Fornix of the vagina|anterior fornix]], while in the rear-entry position it is in preferential contact with the posterior wall of the vagina and probably reaches the posterior fornix.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of Sexual Intercourse: Second Experience in Missionary Position and Initial Experience in Posterior Position |journal=Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy |volume=28 |pages=63\u201376 |year=2002 |doi=10.1080/00926230252851203 |pmid=11898711 |author1=A.

A woman can adjust the position of her legs for comfort, variety and to control the angle and depth of penetration. Generally, the higher a woman's legs, the deeper is the penetration. When the legs are raised in any way, the woman has less control of the rhythm of thrusts. Also, raising the legs raises the woman's pelvis, reduces the angle of penetration, and lowers the level of clitoral stimulation.\n\nA woman's legs can remain flat or raised toward her chest, or wrapped around the penetrating partner at various heights: at the back of the legs, at the buttocks or back or over the shoulders, in a position called the ''Wiener Auster'' or Viennese oyster.<ref>''Lexikon der Erotik'' by Lykke Aresin and Kurt Starke.

This is a deep penetrating position and may not be suitable for men with larger than average penis size.

''The Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight''. The Kegan Paul Arabia library, vol. 7. London: Kegan Paul, 1999.</ref> while the man penetrates her while standing. The woman can move her body freely. She can dangle her legs over the edge or raise them to any height or manner mentioned above. The woman can rest her legs on the man or he can hold them or separate them. The woman has a greater ability to move her pelvis and to arch her back, and the man can raise, support or  restrict the movement of her pelvis. The woman is not weighed down by the man's weight. This position, sometimes called the ''butterfly position'', adds variety to the angle and depth of penetration and generally enables the man to withdraw and then fully thrust the penis, with faster and more forceful thrusts. The downside of this position is that the angle of penetration results in reduced [[Sexual stimulation|clitoral stimulation]], and the woman may need direct clitoral [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]], either by herself or by the man, to achieve orgasm. Alternatively, the woman may either arch her back or raise her torso onto her elbows or arms to reduce the angle and enhance clitoral stimulation. Also, prior to and after the man's orgasm, the man may need to lie down on the woman.\n\n===Riding high===\n{{See also|Coital alignment technique}}\nIn the riding high missionary variant, the man enters the woman and then shifts his body up and forward toward her head. He then rocks back and forth, stimulating her clitoris with his pelvic bone, or base of his penis. This results in more consistent clitoral stimulation at the cost of a man's deep thrusting; accordingly, some men prefer to use it during only part of sex.<ref>{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Kira |url=http://www.savvymiss.com/love-advice/sex-advice/sex-sex-sex-archive/article/rethink-the-missionary-position-three-ways-to-spice-up-a-classic-4383/page-browse/1/sspn//8ac9f9dfdf.html |title=Rethink the Missionary Position: Three Ways to Spice up a Classic |publisher=Savvy Miss |accessdate=2008-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20071224001208/http://www.savvymiss.com/love-advice/sex-advice/sex-sex-sex-archive/article/rethink-the-missionary-position-three-ways-to-spice-up-a-classic-4383/page-browse/1/sspn//8ac9f9dfdf.html |archivedate=2007-12-24 }}</ref>\n\n===Anal sex, tribadism and other aspects===\n<!-- NOTE: This section combines these matters because, per MOS:PARAGRAPHS, \"Short paragraphs and single sentences generally do not warrant their own subheading.\"  -->\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Wiki-anal missionary.png\n| width1 = 180\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Wiki-tribadism02.png\n| width2 = 180\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: two men engaged in the missionary position during anal sex.

It is often regarded as a romantic position because the two partners face each other and may maintain eye contact; there is potentially a greater amount of skin-to-skin contact than in any other position; and the couple can hold each other in their arms, which can easily segue into cuddling when sex is over.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Partners may engage in other intimate contact, such as kissing, or guiding each other's hips with their hands.<ref name=\"BestLove\">{{cite web |author=Cynthia Perkins |url=http://www.smolderingembers.com/missionary-sex-position.html |title=The Missionary Sex Position |publisher=Best Love Making Positions and Techniques |accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sextherapyinphiladelphia.com/sexual-positions/ |title=Sexual Positions |publisher=Sex Therapy in Philadelphia |accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Aly Walansky |url=http://www.askmen.com/dating/love_tip/59_love_tip.html |title=Sexual Positions Women Enjoy |publisher=AskMen |accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the woman needs a high level of trust in the man on top who is in a dominant position vis-a-vis the woman below. The trust is demonstrated by the woman [[Spreadeagle (position)#Sex position|spreading her legs]] in an implicit invitation for the man on top to enter the most sexually sensitive part of her body.<ref name=\"Colombia\"/> This, as well as her lack of control, the social expectation of passivity of the woman and the possibility of pregnancy, heightens her feeling of vulnerability. Her lack of control is accentuated because once the man is in place, he is very difficult to dislodge without his co-operation.

Thomas Stuttaford notes that it may be more comfortable to do so: \"The discomfort of early penetrative sex, if there is any, is usually related to tension in the pelvic or thigh muscles and/or anxiety that has prevented the usual vaginal lubrication.

He described the American preference for the position and called it ''the English-American position''. Discussing [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski|Malinowski's]] ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia'', Kinsey wrote, \"It will be recalled that Malinowski (1929) records the nearly universal use of a totally different position among the [[Trobrianders]]&nbsp;... [and]&nbsp;... that caricatures of the English-American position are performed around&nbsp;... campfires, to the great amusement of the natives who refer to the position as the 'missionary position.'\"<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/> To date, lexicographers and sexologists have not found use of the term ''missionary position'' before Kinsey.<ref>Priest, 30.</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Robert Priest examined the origins of the term and concluded that Kinsey had confused several factors in accidentally coining the term.<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/> First, according to Malinowski, Trobrianders played and sang mocking songs under the full Moon, and not around a campfire. In ''Sexual Behaviors'', Kinsey wrote that the Trobrianders mocked face-to-face man-on-top woman-below intercourse, but does not give context. He mentioned that the position was learned from \"white traders, planters, or officials\", but does not discuss missionaries. Kinsey also recalled that the medieval Catholic Church taught the position, and upon seeing the natives mocking it, assumed that missionaries had taught it to them. Finally, Malinowski wrote that he saw an engaged Trobriand couple holding hands and leaning against each other, which the natives described as ''misinari si bubunela''&nbsp;\u2014 the ''missionary fashion''. Upon accidentally combining these similar facts, Kinsey invented a new phrase despite believing that he was reporting an old one.<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/>\n\nFrom then on, the story of the name's origin may have been retold until it became largely accepted, with its connection to Kinsey and Malinowski having faded. Writers began using the expression for sexual intercourse in the late 1960s, and as [[Alex Comfort]]'s bestseller ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' (1972) and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (1976) spread the term ''missionary position'', it gradually replaced older names.<ref>Priest, 30-31.</ref> By the 1990s, it had spread to other languages: ''Missionarsstellung'' ([[German language|German]]), ''postura del misionero'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), ''missionarishouding'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and ''position du missionaire'' ([[French language|French]]).<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/>\n\nIn [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'' (Act 1, Scene 1), the missionary position was [[euphemism|euphemistically]] called [[Beast with two backs|\"the beast with two backs\"]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=othello&Act=1&Scene=1&Scope=scene|title=Othello, Act I, Scene 1 :-: Open Source Shakespeare|website=www.opensourceshakespeare.org}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\nThough there are a number of variations and adoptions of the missionary position, the classic missionary position involves a man and a woman, with the woman lying on her back and the man on top. Variations in the positions may vary the angle and depth of penile penetration.\n\n===Basic position===\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}\nIn the missionary position, a woman lies on her back on a bed or other surface with her legs comfortably spread with the soles of the feet resting. The penetrating partner may approach the woman on his knees between her spread legs; and either uses his arms to hold himself up, or lets his weight rest on her. When the woman's vagina is sufficiently lubricated, which may involve [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] her [[vulva]] or [[clitoris]] in particular, the man will level his erect penis with her vagina for [[sexual penetration|penetration]], and may use fingers to open the woman's labia and guide the penis in.\n\nWith the penis inside the woman's vagina, the man can control the force, depth, pace, and rhythm of [[Pelvic thrust|thrusts]], and can also control to some extent the female partner's movements. Subject to the man's weight and position, the woman may have some control by pushing her feet and legs against the mattress and by side movements in her pelvis as well as by clutching onto and moving with her partner.<ref name=\"Kar\">{{cite book |first1=Nilamadhab |last1=Kar |first2=Gopal Chandra |last2=Kar| title = Comprehensive Textbook of Sexual Medicine | publisher = [[Jaypee Brothers| Jaypee Brothers Publishers]]|pages=107\u2013108| isbn = 978-8180614057|year=2005| accessdate = February 10, 2014 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=YxcjMPbGHQIC&pg=PA107}}</ref>  A woman can increase the force of a man's thrust by moving against the man's rhythm.\n\nThe man may straddle the woman, taking the woman's legs between his. This restricts and further controls the woman's movements, and the man can increase the tightness on the penis by pressing the woman's thighs together. However, this increases vaginal friction and makes thrusting more difficult.\n\nDuring sexual intercourse, most women experience involuntary [[vaginal contraction]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8174183 |year=1994 |last1=Kratochv\u00edl |first1=S |title=Vaginal contractions in female orgasm |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=28\u201333 |journal=Ceskoslovenska Psychiatrie}}</ref> The contraction causes the [[pelvic muscles]] to tighten around the penis, which increases the level of her partner's arousal and sexual frenzy and results in the man increasing the pace and force of thrusts as he approaches orgasm, which in turn further increases the woman's vaginal contraction. After a man has achieved orgasm, he will normally collapse onto the woman and will normally not be capable of further thrusting. Some men try to control their orgasm until their female partner also orgasms, but this is not always achieved. At times, a woman can achieve orgasm after the man has ceased thrusting by contracting her vaginal muscles and with pelvic movements, or the couple may change to another position that enables the woman to continue thrusting until she has reached orgasm, such as a [[woman on top]] position.\n\nDuring sexual intercourse in the missionary position, the penis is in preferential contact with the [[Anterior#Superior and inferior|anterior]] wall of the vagina and the tip of the penis reaches the [[Fornix of the vagina|anterior fornix]], while in the rear-entry position it is in preferential contact with the posterior wall of the vagina and probably reaches the posterior fornix.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of Sexual Intercourse: Second Experience in Missionary Position and Initial Experience in Posterior Position |journal=Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy |volume=28 |pages=63\u201376 |year=2002 |doi=10.1080/00926230252851203 |pmid=11898711 |author1=A.

A woman can adjust the position of her legs for comfort, variety and to control the angle and depth of penetration. Generally, the higher a woman's legs, the deeper is the penetration. When the legs are raised in any way, the woman has less control of the rhythm of thrusts. Also, raising the legs raises the woman's pelvis, reduces the angle of penetration, and lowers the level of clitoral stimulation.\n\nA woman's legs can remain flat or raised toward her chest, or wrapped around the penetrating partner at various heights: at the back of the legs, at the buttocks or back or over the shoulders, in a position called the ''Wiener Auster'' or Viennese oyster.<ref>''Lexikon der Erotik'' by Lykke Aresin and Kurt Starke.

The female lies on her back and moves her legs behind her head, with the groin area being completely exposed. The male partner penetrates the vagina from the top. This is a deep penetrating position and may not be suitable for men with larger than average penis size. However, in most cases, the female will not be flexible enough to achieve this position fully, and will need to stop well before the legs are behind the head.

She can dangle her legs over the edge or raise them to any height or manner mentioned above. The woman can rest her legs on the man or he can hold them or separate them. The woman has a greater ability to move her pelvis and to arch her back, and the man can raise, support or  restrict the movement of her pelvis. The woman is not weighed down by the man's weight. This position, sometimes called the ''butterfly position'', adds variety to the angle and depth of penetration and generally enables the man to withdraw and then fully thrust the penis, with faster and more forceful thrusts. The downside of this position is that the angle of penetration results in reduced [[Sexual stimulation|clitoral stimulation]], and the woman may need direct clitoral [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]], either by herself or by the man, to achieve orgasm. Alternatively, the woman may either arch her back or raise her torso onto her elbows or arms to reduce the angle and enhance clitoral stimulation. Also, prior to and after the man's orgasm, the man may need to lie down on the woman.\n\n===Riding high===\n{{See also|Coital alignment technique}}\nIn the riding high missionary variant, the man enters the woman and then shifts his body up and forward toward her head. He then rocks back and forth, stimulating her clitoris with his pelvic bone, or base of his penis. This results in more consistent clitoral stimulation at the cost of a man's deep thrusting; accordingly, some men prefer to use it during only part of sex.<ref>{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Kira |url=http://www.savvymiss.com/love-advice/sex-advice/sex-sex-sex-archive/article/rethink-the-missionary-position-three-ways-to-spice-up-a-classic-4383/page-browse/1/sspn//8ac9f9dfdf.html |title=Rethink the Missionary Position: Three Ways to Spice up a Classic |publisher=Savvy Miss |accessdate=2008-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20071224001208/http://www.savvymiss.com/love-advice/sex-advice/sex-sex-sex-archive/article/rethink-the-missionary-position-three-ways-to-spice-up-a-classic-4383/page-browse/1/sspn//8ac9f9dfdf.html |archivedate=2007-12-24 }}</ref>\n\n===Anal sex, tribadism and other aspects===\n<!-- NOTE: This section combines these matters because, per MOS:PARAGRAPHS, \"Short paragraphs and single sentences generally do not warrant their own subheading.\"  -->\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Wiki-anal missionary.png\n| width1 = 180\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Wiki-tribadism02.png\n| width2 = 180\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: two men engaged in the missionary position during anal sex.

It is often regarded as a romantic position because the two partners face each other and may maintain eye contact; there is potentially a greater amount of skin-to-skin contact than in any other position; and the couple can hold each other in their arms, which can easily segue into cuddling when sex is over.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Partners may engage in other intimate contact, such as kissing, or guiding each other's hips with their hands.<ref name=\"BestLove\">{{cite web |author=Cynthia Perkins |url=http://www.smolderingembers.com/missionary-sex-position.html |title=The Missionary Sex Position |publisher=Best Love Making Positions and Techniques |accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sextherapyinphiladelphia.com/sexual-positions/ |title=Sexual Positions |publisher=Sex Therapy in Philadelphia |accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Aly Walansky |url=http://www.askmen.com/dating/love_tip/59_love_tip.html |title=Sexual Positions Women Enjoy |publisher=AskMen |accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the woman needs a high level of trust in the man on top who is in a dominant position vis-a-vis the woman below. The trust is demonstrated by the woman [[Spreadeagle (position)#Sex position|spreading her legs]] in an implicit invitation for the man on top to enter the most sexually sensitive part of her body.<ref name=\"Colombia\"/> This, as well as her lack of control, the social expectation of passivity of the woman and the possibility of pregnancy, heightens her feeling of vulnerability. Her lack of control is accentuated because once the man is in place, he is very difficult to dislodge without his co-operation.

Thomas Stuttaford notes that it may be more comfortable to do so: \"The discomfort of early penetrative sex, if there is any, is usually related to tension in the pelvic or thigh muscles and/or anxiety that has prevented the usual vaginal lubrication.

Grant has created characters and stories in visual mediums as drawings, paintings, in films and on stage.\n\n==Career==\nGrant moved to New York City in 1970 to study [[acting]] technique with [[Lee Strasberg]]. He joined the professional acting unions: [[Screen Actors Guild]], [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]] and [[Actors' Equity Association]]; and was represented by the William Morris Agency, who created the stage name 'Carson Grant'. He trained with [[Wally Harper]], who coached his [[baritone]] voice, and Phil Black who trained him with modern [[jazz]] and [[fencing]].\n\nGrant performed various acting roles with [[New York City Opera]] and began his film acting career in films as ''Man on a Swing'', ''[[The Front]]'' and ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]''. He portrayed 'Romeo' in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' at New Jersey [[Shakespeare]] in the Park and was young '[[Thomas Jefferson]]' in ''The Last Ballot'' in the WNET 13 [[wikt:bicentennial|Bicentennial]] series.\n\nGrant painted large oil [[canvases]] and constructed many [[art installations]] in [[alternative exhibition spaces]] as part of the [[East Village, Manhattan]] 1970s Art Movement, participating in [[Colab]], Charas PS64 - El Bohio, [[ABC No Rio]], [[Fashion Moda]]; and many group art shows in the East Village, the Westside, and the Bronx in alternative spaces. [[Leo Castelli]] recognized Grant's installation of living sand sculptures 'Coney Island Bathing Beauties' shown in \"The [[Coney Island]] Art Show 1981,\" and his triptych 'In Life Turmoil' in the \"[[Time Square]] Show\" 1980 organized by Collaborative Project Inc. [[Colab]]. Grant had a cobalt blue '[[graffiti]] tag' of a pine tree coastline with his initials CFG, and on a midnight graffiti session, he had painted ten foot high cobalt blue iris flowers stretching the block-long 100 foot wall on the Lower East Side Con Edison plant, at Avenue C and 14th Street, titled \"Open your Irises\", in protest of the pollution produced by the energy plant. Influenced by [[Robert Rauschenberg]]'s use of art for social change, Grant's one-man exhibition was called \"Nature-Nuclear\" at the 1979 Jack Morris Gallery, NYC, where he constructed a large climb-up-into 'scarred [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]] [[Uterus]]' post-nuclear, with her distorted next-generation traveling down her maimed [[fallopian tubes]] into her contaminated womb (30' x 40'. The work, encouraged the viewer to consider [[alternative energy sources]] to protect our [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].<ref>Dalton, James. \"How Does a Man Imagine Post Nuclear.\" ''Pawtucket Times''. p.17.

In 1981, as the WSAC group marched to Lincoln Center to protest President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s budget cuts to the Arts, Grant's photographs appeared on the front page of the Westsider Newspaper,.<ref>\"Artists march to Lincoln Center rally on Reagan's Budget Cuts to the Arts\", 'The Westsider Newspaper', NYC, August 1981, p. 1</ref><ref>Prytyskacz, Jean. \"Focus on an Artist.\" ''Westside Arts Coalition Newsletter''. Spring 2007, p.5</ref> In 1981, he organized a 'not-for-profit' art group called 'EAU' ''Environmental Artists United'' which created educational art exhibitions merging art and environmental conservation, which received grants from America the Beautiful Fund and [[Avon Foundation]]. Grant exhibited his artwork in alternative spaces throughout the boroughs, as one of the artists in the [[New York City]] 1970's and 1980's Art Movement.\n\nGraduating as a [[Psi Chi]] Honors Society recipient in Psychology and elected Psi Chi president at [[CUNY]] - [[Hunter College]] BA program, Grant's master thesis on the ''Therapeutic Validity of Drama/Art Therapy'', earned him an MA ([[Summa Cum Laude]]) at [[University of Connecticut]]. He pursued postgraduate work at [[Columbia University]]. Grant presented his research at [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]]'s [[Drama Therapy]] Association 1985 convention.\n\n===Art installations and digital media===\nGrant attended and taught at [[Pratt School of Art and Design]], New York City to enhance his knowledge of computer graphics and digital editing. He worked as a computer graphic artist, animator and editor using [[AT&T]]- [[NASA]] software, creating formats for the premiere of [[CD-ROM]] and [[DVD]] and Internet technology, for companies such as Fusion, Advanced Graphics, Exhibit Technologies, Carabineer, and [[Ogilvy & Mather Advertising]].\n\nPainting on the computer tablet, Carson created [[animations]] for the 1991 ''Sony's Time Square Video Screen'', present-day ''Panasonic panel'' hung on the [[One Times Square]] building, for the Ayer advertising campaign \"Breakthrough with the Unexpected\" animation of an egg cracking to release a butterfly <ref>Taylor, Cathy. \"Gratis Ads Light Great White Way.\" ''Adweek''. p.21. February 25, 1991,</ref> and also projects for IBM, Intel, Kodak, DeBeers, Shell, American Express, and [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'s ''Global Access Interactive Gallery'' in [[Washington, DC]].\n\nFor the [[SIGGRAPH]] - 1990 Convention, Texas, to honor [[John F. Kennedy]]'s memory, Grant constructed the suspended 3D hologram sculpture (100' x 100') titled ''Harmony Mountain'' inside the second floor of the old [[Dallas]] Union Train Station, where a viewer could walk around and under the mountainous shape. In the artist's words, \"The installation's purpose was to harness viewers' peaceful thoughts and funnel them through the five pointed ''[[Texas Star]] Vortex'' (20' diameter) which was hung between the two massive exterior columns on the balcony over looking the historically tarnished [[Dallas]] [[Dealey Plaza]] and [[Texas School Book Depository]]. Grant was honored with the SIGGRAPH Vision in Art Award.\n\nGrant participated as a visual artist in many group art exhibitions in New York City as a curator, a contributing painter and photographer.<ref>Prytyskacz, Jean. \"Focus on an Artist.\" ''Westside Arts Coalition Newsletter''.

{"title_page": "Dye-sublimation printer", "text_new": "{{History of printing}}\nA '''dye-sublimation printer''' is a [[Printer (computing)|computer printer]] which uses heat to transfer dye onto materials such as a plastic, card, paper, or fabric. The [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] name was first applied because the dye was considered to make the transition between the solid and gas states without going through a liquid stage. This understanding of the process was later shown to be incorrect, as there is some liquefying of the dye. Since then, the proper name for the process became to be known as '''dye-diffusion''', though this has not eliminated the original name.<ref name=\"Drake/ Han\"> Chemical technology in Printing and Imaging Systems, ed. J A G Drake, 1993, pp 73-85</ref> Many [[consumer]] and [[professional]] dye-sublimation printers are designed and used for producing [[photograph]]ic prints, ID cards, clothing, and more.\n\nThese are not to be confused with dye sublimation heat transfer imprinting printers, which use special inks to create transfers designed to be imprinted on textiles, and in which the dyes do indeed sublimate.<ref name=\"Drake/ Han\" /> These are done at lower temperatures but higher pressures, particularly in [[all-over print]] processes. \n\nFor ID card printing, text and bar codes are necessary, and they are printed by means of an additional black panel on the (YMCKO) ribbon.  This extra panel works by [[thermal transfer printing]] instead of dye diffusion: a whole layer, instead of just some of the dye in the layer, transfers from the ribbon to the substrate at the pixels defined by the thermal head.  This overall process is then sometimes called dye diffusion thermal transfer (D2T2).\n\n== Printing technique ==\nDye-sub printing is a [[digital printing]] technology using full color artwork that works with [[polyester]] and [[polymer]]-coated [[Substrate (printing)|substrates]]. Also referred to as digital sublimation, the process is commonly used for decorating apparel, signs and banners, as well as novelty items such as cell phone covers, plaques, coffee mugs, and other items with sublimation-friendly surfaces.  The process uses the science of [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]], in which heat and pressure are applied to a solid, turning it into a gas through an [[endothermic]] reaction without passing through the liquid phase.\n\nIn sublimation printing, unique sublimation dyes are transferred to sheets of \u201ctransfer\u201d paper via liquid gel ink through a [[piezoelectric]] print head. The ink is deposited on these high-release inkjet papers, which are used for the next step of the sublimation printing process. After the digital design is printed onto sublimation transfer sheets, it is placed on a [[heat press]] along with the substrate to be sublimated.\n\nIn order to transfer the image from the paper to the substrate, it requires a heat press process that is a combination of time, temperature and pressure. The heat press applies this special combination, which can change depending on the substrate, to \u201ctransfer\u201d the sublimation dyes at the molecular level into the substrate. The most common dyes used for sublimation activate at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. However, a range of 380 to 420 degrees Fahrenheit is normally recommended for optimal color.\n\nThe end result of the sublimation process is a nearly permanent, high resolution, full color print. Because the dyes are infused into the substrate at the [[Molecule|molecular]] level, rather than applied at a topical level (such as with [[screen printing]] and [[direct to garment printing]]), the prints will not crack, fade or peel from the substrate under normal conditions.\n\n==Operation==\nThe most common process lays one color at a time, the dye being stored on a polyester ribbon that has each colour on a separate panel. Each coloured panel is the size of the medium that is being printed on; for example, a 6\" by 4\" dye sub printer would have four 6\" by 4\" panels.\n\nDuring the printing cycle, the printer rollers will move the medium and one of the coloured panels together under a thermal printing head, which is usually the same width as the shorter dimension of the print medium. Tiny heating elements on the head change temperature rapidly, laying different amounts of dye depending on the amount of heat applied. Some of the dye diffuses into the printing medium.\n\nAfter the printer finishes printing the medium in one colour, it winds the ribbon on to the next colour panel and partially ejects the medium from the printer to prepare for the next cycle. The entire process is repeated four or five times in total: the first three lay the colours onto the medium to form a complete image; there may or may not then be a black thermal transfer process; while the last one lays the laminate over top. This layer protects the dyes from UV light and moisture.\n\n==Comparison with inkjet printers==\nTraditionally, the advantage of dye-sublimation printing has been the fact that it is a continuous-tone technology, where each dot can be any color. In contrast, inkjet printers can vary the location and size of ink droplets, a process called [[dithering]], but each drop of ink is limited to the colors of the inks installed. Consequently, a dye-sublimation printer produces true continuous tones appearing much like a chemical photograph. An inkjet print is composed of droplets of ink layered and scattered to simulate continuous tones, but under magnification the individual droplets can be seen. In the early days of inkjet printing, the large droplets and low resolution made inkjet prints significantly inferior to dye-sublimation, but some of today's inkjets produce extremely high quality prints using microscopic droplets and supplementary ink colors, producing superior color fidelity to dye-sublimation.\n\nDye sublimation offers some advantages over inkjet printing.  For one, the prints are dry and ready to handle as soon as they exit the printer.  Since the thermal head doesn't have to sweep back and forth over the print media, there are fewer moving parts that can break down.  The whole printing cycle is extremely clean as there are no liquid inks to clean up.  These factors make dye-sublimation generally a more reliable technology over inkjet printing.\n\nDye-sublimation printers have some drawbacks compared to inkjet printers. Each of the colored panels of the ribbons, and the thermal head itself, must match the size of the media that is being printed on. Furthermore, only specially [[coated paper]] or specific plastics can accept the sublimated ink. This means that dye-sublimation printers cannot match the flexibility of inkjet printers in printing on a wide range of media.\n\nThe dyes diffuse a small amount before being absorbed by the paper. Consequently, prints are not razor-sharp. For photographs, this produces very natural prints, but for other uses (such as graphic design) this slight blurriness is a disadvantage.\n\nThe amount of wasted dye per page is also very high; most of the dye in the four panels may be wasted for a typical print. Once a panel has been used, even to just print a single dot, the remaining dye on that panel cannot be reused for another print without leaving a blank spot where the dye was used previously. Due to the single-roll design of most printers, four panels of colored dye must be used for every print, whether or not a panel is needed for the print. Printing in monochrome saves nothing, and the three unused color panels for that page cannot be recycled for a different single-color print. Inkjet printers can also suffer from 'dye wastage' as the ink cartridges are prone to drying up with low usage (without 'heavy use', the cartridge nozzles can become clogged with dried ink).  Dye-sublimation media packs, (which contain both ribbon and paper), are rated for an exact number of prints which yields a fixed cost per print. This is in opposition to inkjet printers where inks are purchased by volume.\n\nFor environments that print confidential or secret documents, a dye-sublimation printer is a potential security risk that must be handled carefully. Due to the mechanism of printing, a perfect color-separated negative image of the printed page is created on the supply roll color panels, and the \"waste roll\" of dye panels can be unrolled to see everything that has been printed with the printer. For such environments, the waste roll should be shredded or incinerated onsite rather than simply being discarded in the trash. Also, for home users, the waste roll from a photo printer can be similarly recovered from the garbage and used to see everything that has been printed. Since the supply roll is plastic, the lifespan of a used roll can be years or decades long, permitting image recovery long after disposal.\n\nAlso, dye-sublimation papers and ribbons are sensitive to skin oils, which interfere with the dye's ability to sublimate from the ribbon to the paper.  They must also be free of dust particles, which can lead to small colored blobs appearing on the prints. Most dye-sublimation printers have filters and/or cleaning rollers to reduce the likelihood of this happening, and a speck of dust can only affect one print as it becomes attached to the print during the printing process. Finally, dye-sublimation printers fall short when producing neutral and toned black-and-white prints with higher [[Optical density|density]] levels and virtually no [[metamerism (color)|metamerism]] or bronzing.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\n==Applications==\n[[Image:Dye sublimation printing insecurity.jpg|thumb|300px|Used dye panels retain a viewable image of the printed document, and an example of wasted dye that cannot be reused.]]\n\nPreviously, the use of dye-sub printing was limited to industrial or high-end commercial printing. Dye-sub photo printing has been used in [[medical imaging]], graphic arts proofing, security, and broadcast related applications. But nowadays, it is extremely popular in event photography and photo booths or kiosks that requires high speed, on-demand printing.\n\n[[Alps Electric Co.|Alps Electric]] produced the first quality dye-sub printers for home consumers in the $500\u2013$1,000 price range, bringing dye-sublimation technology within the reach of a wider audience. Now there are many dye-sublimation printers on the market starting from as low as $100, especially [[postcard]]-sized mobile [[photo printer]]s.\n\nThe ability to produce instant photo prints inexpensively from a small printer has led to dye sublimation solutions supplanting traditional instant photos in some applications, such as with ID photography with a [[card printer]].\n\nSeveral corporations  market desktop size units as stand-alone printers and for print kiosk and [[photo booth]] applications. Some of these units are based on generic printers. Some manufacturers, offer [[software development kit]]s with their printers, suggesting that these companies hope to attract [[system integrator]]s as a potential market.\n\nDesktop size stand-alone dye-sub photo printers are also being applied by social photographers in event photography. The units' instant print ability allows photographers to produce and sell lab quality prints immediately during the event they are attending, with a minimal amount of hardware.<ref>https://www.ghelanistudios.com/</ref>\n\nDye-sublimation can also be used as an indirect printing process. Standard black and white [[laser printer]]s are capable of printing on plain paper using a special \"transfer toner\" containing sublimation dyes which can then be permanently heat transferred to T-shirts, hats, mugs, metals, puzzles and other surfaces.\n\n===Textiles===\nThe dye-sublimation printing process is used to print on [[polyester]] or other synthetic fabrics. It is used for applications such as [[T-shirts]], banners, table covers, id cards, [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] and flags. The original printers were an [[electrostatic]] technology using toners but now are generally large format inkjet printers using specially formulated inks. The dye sublimation inks are a disperse dye suspended in a liquid [[solvent]], like water. The images are initially printed on coated heat-resistant transfer paper as a reverse image of the final design, which is then transferred onto polyester fabric in a heat press operating at a temperature around 180 to 210 C (375 F). Under high temperature and pressure, the dye turns into a gas and permeates the fabric and then solidifies into its fibers. The fabric is permanently dyed so it can be washed without damaging the quality of the image.\n\nAdvantages of dye-sublimation over other methods of textile printing:<ref>{{cite book |title=Graphic Designer's Digital Printing and Prepress Handbook |last= Sidles |first= Constance J. |pages= 26\u201327 |publisher= Rockport Publishers |date= 2001 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MfLXgLvRHIcC&lpg=PA26&dq=dye%20sublimation%20fabric&pg=PA26#v=onepage&q=dye%20sublimation%20fabric&f=false |accessdate= 2011-10-05 |isbn= 9781564967749 }}</ref> images are permanent and do not peel or fade, dye does not build up on the fabric.\n*Colors can be extraordinarily brilliant due to the bonding of the dye to the transparent fibers of the synthetic fabric, truly continuous tones can be achieved that are equivalent to photographs, without the use special techniques such as half-screen printing, and the image can be printed all over the entire item, with no difficulty in printing all the way to the edges.\n\n==Print speed for dye sublimation thermal printers==\nAs dye-sublimation thermal printers utilize heat to transfer the dye onto the print media, the printing speed is limited by the speed at which the elements on the thermal head can change temperature. Heating the elements is easy, as a strong electric current can raise the temperature of an element very quickly.  However, cooling the elements down, when changing from a darker to a lighter color, is harder and usually involves having a fan/heatsink assembly attached to the print head.  The use of multiple heads can also speed up this process, since one head can cool down while another is printing.  Although print times vary among different dye-sublimation printers, a typical cheap home-use dye-sub printer can print a 6\" x 4\" photo in 45 \u2013 90 seconds. More heavy-duty printers can print much faster; for example, a Sinfonia Colorstream S2 dye-sublimation printer can print a 6\" x 4\" photo in as little as 6.8 seconds, and a Mitsubishi CP-D707DW is known to have a faster print of under 6 seconds for similar size.  In all cases, the finished print is completely dry once it emerges from the printer.\n\n==Ink for piezo printers==\n[[Image:RGB dye sublimation panels.jpg|thumb|300px|A disassembled dye sublimation cartridge.]]\n\nThere are two types of dye sublimation inks for piezo dye sublimation printers available in the market. The most popular one is aqueous dye sublimation ink for use in both desktop and large format printers. The other is solvent dye sublimation ink that can be used in XAAR, Spectra and some [[Konica]] printhead wide format printers.\n\nDue to the fast development of [[digital textile printing]], dye sublimation inks are becoming more and more popular in digital [[inkjet]] printing on [[fabrics]].\n\nPrint speeds for large-format piezo printers using aqueous dye sublimation ink continue to increase. Speeds range from 18 square meters per hour in a smaller 44\" wide printer to over 3,000 square meters per hour in a high-speed industrial textile printer.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Barcode printer]]\n*[[Card printer]]\n*[[Daisy wheel printer]]\n*[[Dot matrix printer]]\n*[[Inkjet printer]]\n*[[Label printer]]\n*[[Label printer applicator]]\n*[[Line matrix printer]]\n*[[Line printer]]\n*[[Thermal transfer printer]]\n*[[ID card printer]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dye-Sublimation Printer}}\n[[Category:Computer printers]]\n[[Category:Non-impact printing]]\n", "text_old": "{{History of printing}}\nA '''dye-sublimation printer''' is a [[Printer (computing)|computer printer]] which uses heat to transfer dye onto materials such as a plastic, card, paper, or fabric.

The most popular one is aqueous dye sublimation ink for use in both desktop and large format printers. The other is solvent dye sublimation ink that can be used in XAAR, Spectra and some [[Konica]] printhead wide format printers.\n\nDue to the fast development of [[digital textile printing]], dye sublimation inks are becoming more and more popular in digital [[inkjet]] printing on [[fabrics]].\n\nPrint speeds for large-format piezo printers using aqueous dye sublimation ink continue to increase. Speeds range from 18 square meters per hour in a smaller 44\" wide printer to over 3,000 square meters per hour in a high-speed industrial textile printer.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Barcode printer]]\n*[[Card printer]]\n*[[Daisy wheel printer]]\n*[[Dot matrix printer]]\n*[[Inkjet printer]]\n*[[Label printer]]\n*[[Label printer applicator]]\n*[[Line matrix printer]]\n*[[Line printer]]\n*[[Thermal transfer printer]]\n*[[ID card printer]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dye-Sublimation Printer}}\n[[Category:Computer printers]]\n[[Category:Non-impact printing]]\n", "name_user": "82.19.114.120", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Undid revision 948774026 byMrOllie(talk))", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye-sublimation_printer"}

Hinault attacked early in the stage, together with [[Luis Herrera (cyclist)|Luis Herrera]]. Herrera was already far behind in the general classification, but was interested in the [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. Hinault and Herrera worked together: Hinault was only interested in the time gains, and Herrera was only interested in reaching the mountain tops first. Herrera won the stage, with Hinault seven seconds back. LeMond had to stay in the next group, because team tactics did not allow him to attack his teammate.<ref name=\"Gann\"/> Stage thirteen was run as an individual time trial. Hinault was not so strong anymore, and did not win the stage, but still won time on LeMond, who was now in second place in the general classification, more than five minutes behind Hinault.<ref name=\"Gann\"/> In stage fourteen, Herrera attacked early again to win points for the mountain classification. He was followed by a group of eight cyclists, including LeMond but not Hinault. Herrera won the stage, with the LeMond group reaching the finish one minute later. One minute after that, the group with Hinault reached the finish, but less than one kilometer from the finish, Hinault and five other cyclists crashed. The rules of the Tour says that time losses due to crashes in the last kilometer are not counted, but a cyclists has to reach the finish on his own strengths. Hinault, still on the ground, was checked by the Tour doctor for some minutes, but was able to get back on his bike and finish the stage, his face all covered with blood. His nose was broken, and breathing was more difficult than normal.<ref name=\"Gann\"/>\n===Pyrenees===\nHinault survived the next two flat stages, but ran into problems in the seventeenth stage, with the [[Col d'Aspin]], the [[Col du Tourmalet]] and [[Luz Ardiden]]. On the Tourmalet, Hinault had to let LeMond, [[Stephen Roche]] and [[Pedro Delgado]] go. Delgado then left on his own, with Roche chasing him, and LeMond staying close to Roche, who was the biggest threat in the general classification. LeMond felt that he was stronger, and asked his team director [[Paul Koechli]] permission to attack. Koechli refused that, and told LeMond to stay with Roche. LeMond stayed with Roche while some other cyclists caught up and Herrera and [[Fabio Parra]] went clear of the group. At the end of the stage, LeMond finished almost three minutes behind Delgado, with Hinault a further minute behind. In the general classification, Hinault remained in front, with LeMond 2 minutes 25 seconds behind.<ref name=\"Gann\"/> LeMond was frustrated after the stage, because he felt that he could have won the stage, and could have led the general classification for a few days. Hinault, who knew that his Tour victory was now certain only because LeMond had been waiting for him, promised that in the [[1986 Tour de France|next edition]], he would help LeMond to win the Tour.<ref name=\"Gann\"/> In the remaining stages, Hinaults lead was not seriously challenged.

The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013453}}\n\nAdditionally, there was a [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]], where cyclists were given points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=453\u2013454}} The system for the [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]] was changed for the 1987 Tour: in previous years, more points were earned in flat stages than in mountain stages, which gave sprinters an advantage in this classification; in 1984 all stages gave 25 points for the winner.<ref name=\"kbnl\">{{cite news|url=http://kranten.kb.nl/view/article/id/ddd%3A010962071%3Ampeg21%3Ap021%3Aa0310|title=Ruim ton voor winnaar|language=Dutch|publisher=Koninklijke Bibliotheek|work=Het Vrije Volk|date=28 June 1985|page=21|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThere was also a [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. The points system for the classification was changed: mountains in the toughest categories gave more points, to reduce the influence of the minor hills on this classification.<ref name=\"kbnl\" /> The organisation had categorised some climbs as either ''[[hors cat\u00e9gorie]]'', first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red [[polka dot]]s.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}}\n\nThe combination jersey for the [[Combination classification in the Tour de France|combination classification]] was introduced in 1985.<ref name=\"kbnl\" /> This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=454\u2013455}}\n\nAnother classification was the [[young rider classification in the Tour de France|young rider classification]]. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders that rode the Tour for the first time were eligible, and the leader wore a white jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=454\u2013455}}\n\nThe sixth individual classification was the [[intermediate sprints classification in the Tour de France|intermediate sprints classification]]. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. Its leader wore a red jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nFor the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]], the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow [[Casquette|caps]].{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}} There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]], in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after each [[Mass start|mass-start]] stage to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pp=211\u2013216}} At the conclusion of the Tour, Maarten Ducrot won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=76}} The [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]] was given in honour of Tour founder [[Henri Desgrange]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col du Tourmalet]] on stage 17.

Hinault attacked early in the stage, together with [[Luis Herrera (cyclist)|Luis Herrera]]. Herrera was already far behind in the general classification, but was interested in the [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. Hinault and Herrera worked together: Hinault was only interested in the time gains, and Herrera was only interested in reaching the mountain tops first. Herrera won the stage, with Hinault seven seconds back. LeMond had to stay in the next group, because team tactics did not allow him to attack his teammate.<ref name=\"Gann\"/> Stage thirteen was run as an individual time trial. Hinault was not so strong anymore, and did not win the stage, but still won time on LeMond, who was now in second place in the general classification, more than five minutes behind Hinault.<ref name=\"Gann\"/> In stage fourteen, Herrera attacked early again to win points for the mountain classification. He was followed by a group of eight cyclists, including LeMond but not Hinault. Herrera won the stage, with the LeMond group reaching the finish one minute later. One minute after that, the group with Hinault reached the finish, but less than one kilometer from the finish, Hinault and five other cyclists crashed. The rules of the Tour says that time losses due to crashes in the last kilometer are not counted, but a cyclists has to reach the finish on his own strengths. Hinault, still on the ground, was checked by the Tour doctor for some minutes, but was able to get back on his bike and finish the stage, his face all covered with blood. His nose was broken, and breathing was more difficult than normal.<ref name=\"Gann\"/>\n===Pyrenees===\nHinault survived the next two flat stages, but ran into problems in the seventeenth stage, with the [[Col d'Aspin]], the [[Col du Tourmalet]] and [[Luz Ardiden]]. On the Tourmalet, Hinault had to let LeMond, [[Stephen Roche]] and [[Pedro Delgado]] go. Delgado then left on his own, with Roche chasing him, and LeMond staying close to Roche, who was the biggest threat in the general classification. LeMond felt that he was stronger, and asked his team director [[Paul Koechli]] permission to attack. Koechli refused that, and told LeMond to stay with Roche. LeMond stayed with Roche while some other cyclists caught up and Herrera and [[Fabio Parra]] went clear of the group. At the end of the stage, LeMond finished almost three minutes behind Delgado, with Hinault a further minute behind. In the general classification, Hinault remained in front, with LeMond 2 minutes 25 seconds behind.<ref name=\"Gann\"/> LeMond was frustrated after the stage, because he felt that he could have won the stage, and could have led the general classification for a few days. Hinault, who knew that his Tour victory was now certain only because LeMond had been waiting for him, promised that in the [[1986 Tour de France|next edition]], he would help LeMond to win the Tour.<ref name=\"Gann\"/> In the remaining stages, Hinaults lead was not seriously challenged.

The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013453}}\n\nAdditionally, there was a [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]], where cyclists were given points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=453\u2013454}} The system for the [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]] was changed for the 1987 Tour: in previous years, more points were earned in flat stages than in mountain stages, which gave sprinters an advantage in this classification; in 1984 all stages gave 25 points for the winner.<ref name=\"kbnl\">{{cite news|url=http://kranten.kb.nl/view/article/id/ddd%3A010962071%3Ampeg21%3Ap021%3Aa0310|title=Ruim ton voor winnaar|language=Dutch|publisher=Koninklijke Bibliotheek|work=Het Vrije Volk|date=28 June 1985|page=21|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThere was also a [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. The points system for the classification was changed: mountains in the toughest categories gave more points, to reduce the influence of the minor hills on this classification.<ref name=\"kbnl\" /> The organisation had categorised some climbs as either ''[[hors cat\u00e9gorie]]'', first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red [[polka dot]]s.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}}\n\nThe combination jersey for the [[Combination classification in the Tour de France|combination classification]] was introduced in 1985.<ref name=\"kbnl\" /> This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=454\u2013455}}\n\nAnother classification was the [[young rider classification in the Tour de France|young rider classification]]. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders that rode the Tour for the first time were eligible, and the leader wore a white jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=454\u2013455}}\n\nThe sixth individual classification was the [[intermediate sprints classification in the Tour de France|intermediate sprints classification]]. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. Its leader wore a red jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nFor the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]], the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow [[Casquette|caps]].{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}} There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]], in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after each [[Mass start|mass-start]] stage to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pp=211\u2013216}} At the conclusion of the Tour, Maarten Ducrot won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=76}} The [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]] was given in honour of Tour founder [[Henri Desgrange]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col du Tourmalet]] on stage 17.
