Among his disciples were Saint Eulogius, Alvarus Paulus, and [[Samson of C\u00f3rdoba]]. \n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/30_10_0750-0850-_Speraindeo_Abbas.html Opera Omnia by Migne Patrologia Latina with analytical indexes]\n\n[[Category:853 deaths]]\n[[Category:Christian writers]]\n[[Category:Christian critics of Islam]]\n[[Category:Spanish male writers]]\n[[Category:Mozarabic people]]\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]\n[[Category:9th-century Latin writers]]\n\n\n{{Al-Andalus-writer-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speraindeo"}
{"title_page": "BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Awards", "text_new": "The '''BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Awards''', ''Premios Fundaci\u00f3n BBVA Fronteras del Conocimiento'', in Spanish, are an international award programme recognizing significant contributions in the areas of scientific research and cultural creation. The categories that make up the Frontiers of Knowledge Awards respond to the knowledge map of the present age. As well as the fundamental knowledge that is at their core, they address developments in information and communication technologies, and interactions between biology and medicine, ecology and conservation biology, climate change, economics, humanities and social sciences, and, finally, contemporary musical creation and performance. Specific categories are reserved for developing knowledge fields of critical relevance to confront central challenges of the 21st century, as in the case of the two environmental awards. \n\nThe awards were established in 2008, with the first set of winners receiving their prizes in 2009. [[The BBVA Foundation]] \u2013 belonging to financial group [[BBVA]] \u2013 is partnered in the scheme by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), the country\u2019s premier public research organization.\n\nIn their eleven editions, as many as seven winners of BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Awards have gone on to win the Nobel Prize. They are: Robert J. Lefkowitz, 2009 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Laureate in Biomedicine and winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2012; Shinya Yamanaka, 2010 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Laureate in Biomedicine and Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine 2012; Lars Peter Hansen, 2010 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Laureate in Economics, Finance and Management, and 2013 Nobel Laureate in Economics; Jean Tirole, 2008 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Laureate in Economics, Finance and Management and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics 2014; Angus Deaton, 2011 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Laureate in Economics, Finance and Management and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics 2015; James P.

The categories that make up the Frontiers of Knowledge Awards respond to the knowledge map of the present age. As well as the fundamental knowledge that is at their core, they address developments in information and communication technologies, and interactions between biology and medicine, ecology and conservation biology, climate change, economics, humanities and social sciences, and, finally, contemporary musical creation and performance. Specific categories are reserved for developing knowledge fields of critical relevance to confront central challenges of the 21st century, as in the case of the two environmental awards. \n\nThe awards were established in 2008, with the first set of winners receiving their prizes in 2009.

It is one of the largest paved squares in the United Kingdom.\n\nLocated in the heart of [[Nottingham City Centre]], the square is bounded by [[Beastmarket Hill]] to the West, [[Long Row]] to the North, and [[South Parade, Nottingham|South Parade]] to the South. The Eastern end of the square is dominated by the [[Nottingham Council House|Council House]], which served as Nottingham's [[town hall]] until 2010.<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loxley_House,_Nottingham Loxley House]</ref>\n\nThe nature of the square means it is often used for large local events, fairs, concerts and exhibitions.\n\n==History==\nThe early market square, from the 11th Century until 1928, covered an area of about 5.5 acres (22,260 square metres), with its narrow western edge near Mount Street, broadening out to its eastern edge, adjacent to High Street. The perimeter then, being formed by what is now: [[Long Row|Long Row West]], [[Long Row]], [[Long Row|Long Row East]], High Street, [[Poultry, Nottingham|Poultry]], [[South Parade, Nottingham|South Parade]], [[Beastmarket Hill]], and Angel Row.<ref>[https://nottinghamhiddenhistoryteam.wordpress.com/2014/01/02/nottinghams-old-market-square/ Hidden History]</ref> Because of its size during these several centuries, it was frequently referred to as the, 'Great Market Place'.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/articles/tts/tts1931/itinerary1931p2.htm Thoroton]</ref>\n\nThis [[public square]] has long been at the centre of Nottingham life. In the early days before the [[City of Nottingham]] was formed, the area was the centre-point between the [[Normans|Norman]] town of Nottingham, situated around the Castle Rock, and the old [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] town which was based around the current [[Lace Market]] at [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham|St. Mary's Church]], also called Snothryngham, Snottingaham or Snottingham.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/swinnerton1910/chapter1.htm Nottinghamshire history > Cambridge County Geographies: Nottinghamshire, (1910)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The central point between the two towns became a major market point, and hence the square has been at the centre of Nottingham's growth around it for hundreds of years since. The two towns were once divided by a wall. The old positioning of this historic wall was reinstated when the square was redesigned in the 2000s, with a stainless steel drainage channel down the centre of the Square. This marks the Wall that divided the livestock from the agricultural feed and foodstuffs.\n\nThe square was the original setting of [[Nottingham Goose Fair]], an annual fair held in October originating over 700 years ago. The Goose Fair was moved in 1928 for redevelopment of the square.\n\nThe square was the location of [[Smith's Bank]] which, established in 1688, was the earliest provincial bank in England. Its successor, the [[National Westminster Bank]], is still located in the same premises.\n\nWhen the [[Nottingham Exchange]] was demolished and the new [[Nottingham Council House]] built, the Square was redesigned in 1927 with several platforms creating a central procession way. However, the decline in the quality, changes in function, and issues surrounding disabled access spurred a City Council-led international redevelopment competition in 2003 known as [http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/features/2004/03/old_market_square_designs_introduction.shtml Square One].\n\nThe Square continues to be affectionately nicknamed, 'Slab Square', which is a colloquialism and an accurate description, owing to the high number of concrete slabs that made up the former Square, and the high number of granite slabs in place after the 2007 redesign.<ref>[https://www.agefotostock.com/age/en/Stock-Images/Rights-Managed/X9Y-1152789 Pre 2007]</ref><ref>[https://www.picturesofengland.com/England/Nottinghamshire/Nottingham/pictures/1168323 Post 2007]</ref> There was a mosaic of the city [[coat of arms]] in front of the Council House on the square. This fell into a state of dis-repair before the redesign, but was subsequently removed, renovated and installed near the [[Nottingham Royal Concert Hall|Royal Concert Hall]] entrance.\n\nConstruction of the new design cost \u00a317 million. Work began in 2005. The Square was scheduled to reopen before the end of 2006, but following delays reopened in March 2007.\n\nHistorically the Square forms a meeting place for the people of Nottingham and is also the location for local events, civil protests, royal visits, celebrations, and public mourning. A number of Nottingham's defining moments have taken place in the Square.\n\nOne of the most significant civil protests to start here was the protest by [[Luddites]] (a social movement of British textile artisans) in the early nineteenth century, who protested growth in industrial machinery which was seen to be taking jobs. This protest eventually led to the destruction by fire of the [[4th Duke of Newcastle]]\u2019s mansion house, which was built for the 2nd Duke in 1679 on the remaining foundations of the earlier medieval castle.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/gill1904/dismantled.htm Gill Notts History]</ref> The mansion house, the grounds, and the remaining fortifications including the renovated gatehouse, are [[colloquially]] known as, \u2018[[Nottingham Castle]]\u2019 or simply, \u2018the Castle\u2019. Trophies won by [[Nottingham Forest|Nottingham Forest Football Club]] including the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] and the [[FA Cup]] have all been held aloft in front of crowds here. Nottingham ice dance legends [[Torvill and Dean]] also stood on the Council House balcony following their famous Olympic Triumph. In 2004, a memorial service to remember the life of Nottingham Forest's former manager [[Brian Clough]] was held there in front of national television cameras and thousands of local football supporters.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090418073216/http://www.brianclough.com/civic_tribute.html Civic Tribute]</ref> A statue of [[Brian Clough]] is located just off the square at the junction of King Street and Queen Street.<ref>[https://www.gpsmycity.com/attractions/brian-clough-statue-48800.html Statue]</ref>\n\nAs well as many shops, bars and department stores, the Square is also home to the [http://www.nctx.co.uk/ Nottingham City Transport] Travel Centre.

A similar circular arrangement of plants and flowers was created in each of the two squares of grass at the east end. \n\nAround 1940, the grass, flowerbeds and earth at the west end were removed, and the two areas utilized as reservoirs to provide a ready supply of water for use by fire-fighters during the war years.

It is one of the largest paved squares in the United Kingdom.\n\nLocated in the heart of [[Nottingham City Centre]], the square is bounded by [[Beastmarket Hill]] to the West, [[Long Row]] to the North, and [[South Parade, Nottingham|South Parade]] to the South. The Eastern end of the square is dominated by the [[Nottingham Council House|Council House]], which served as Nottingham's [[town hall]] until 2010.<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loxley_House,_Nottingham Loxley House]</ref>\n\nThe nature of the square means it is often used for large local events, fairs, concerts and exhibitions.\n\n==History==\nThe early market square, from the 11th Century until 1928, covered an area of about 5.5 acres (22,260 square metres), with its narrow western edge near Mount Street, broadening out to its eastern edge, adjacent to High Street. The perimeter then, being formed by what is now: [[Long Row|Long Row West]], [[Long Row]], [[Long Row|Long Row East]], High Street, [[Poultry, Nottingham|Poultry]], [[South Parade, Nottingham|South Parade]], [[Beastmarket Hill]], and Angel Row.<ref>[https://nottinghamhiddenhistoryteam.wordpress.com/2014/01/02/nottinghams-old-market-square/ Hidden History]</ref> Because of its size during these several centuries, it was frequently referred to as the, 'Great Market Place'.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/articles/tts/tts1931/itinerary1931p2.htm Thoroton]</ref>\n\nThis [[public square]] has long been at the centre of Nottingham life. In the early days before the [[City of Nottingham]] was formed, the area was the centre-point between the [[Normans|Norman]] town of Nottingham, situated around the Castle Rock, and the old [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] town which was based around the current [[Lace Market]] at [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham|St. Mary's Church]], also called Snothryngham, Snottingaham or Snottingham.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/swinnerton1910/chapter1.htm Nottinghamshire history > Cambridge County Geographies: Nottinghamshire, (1910)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The central point between the two towns became a major market point, and hence the square has been at the centre of Nottingham's growth around it for hundreds of years since. The two towns were once divided by a wall. The old positioning of this historic wall was reinstated when the square was redesigned in the 2000s, with a stainless steel drainage channel down the centre of the Square. This marks the Wall that divided the livestock from the agricultural feed and foodstuffs.\n\nThe square was the original setting of [[Nottingham Goose Fair]], an annual fair held in October originating over 700 years ago. The Goose Fair was moved in 1928 for redevelopment of the square.\n\nThe square was the location of [[Smith's Bank]] which, established in 1688, was the earliest provincial bank in England. Its successor, the [[National Westminster Bank]], is still located in the same premises.\n\nWhen the [[Nottingham Exchange]] was demolished and the new [[Nottingham Council House]] built, the Square was redesigned in 1927 with several platforms creating a central procession way. However, the decline in the quality, changes in function, and issues surrounding disabled access spurred a City Council-led international redevelopment competition in 2003 known as [http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/features/2004/03/old_market_square_designs_introduction.shtml Square One].\n\nThe Square continues to be affectionately nicknamed, 'Slab Square', which is a colloquialism and an accurate description, owing to the high number of concrete slabs that made up the former Square, and the high number of granite slabs in place after the 2007 redesign.<ref>[https://www.agefotostock.com/age/en/Stock-Images/Rights-Managed/X9Y-1152789 Pre 2007]</ref><ref>[https://www.picturesofengland.com/England/Nottinghamshire/Nottingham/pictures/1168323 Post 2007]</ref> There was a mosaic of the city [[coat of arms]] in front of the Council House on the square. This fell into a state of dis-repair before the redesign, but was subsequently removed, renovated and installed near the [[Nottingham Royal Concert Hall|Royal Concert Hall]] entrance.\n\nConstruction of the new design cost \u00a317 million. Work began in 2005. The Square was scheduled to reopen before the end of 2006, but following delays reopened in March 2007.\n\nHistorically the Square forms a meeting place for the people of Nottingham and is also the location for local events, civil protests, royal visits, celebrations, and public mourning. A number of Nottingham's defining moments have taken place in the Square.\n\nOne of the most significant civil protests to start here was the protest by [[Luddites]] (a social movement of British textile artisans) in the early nineteenth century, who protested growth in industrial machinery which was seen to be taking jobs. This protest eventually led to the destruction by fire of the [[4th Duke of Newcastle]]\u2019s mansion house, which was built for the 2nd Duke in 1679 on the remaining foundations of the earlier medieval castle.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/gill1904/dismantled.htm Gill Notts History]</ref> The mansion house, the grounds, and the remaining fortifications including the renovated gatehouse, are [[colloquially]] known as, \u2018[[Nottingham Castle]]\u2019 or simply, \u2018the Castle\u2019. Trophies won by [[Nottingham Forest|Nottingham Forest Football Club]] including the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] and the [[FA Cup]] have all been held aloft in front of crowds here. Nottingham ice dance legends [[Torvill and Dean]] also stood on the Council House balcony following their famous Olympic Triumph. In 2004, a memorial service to remember the life of Nottingham Forest's former manager [[Brian Clough]] was held there in front of national television cameras and thousands of local football supporters.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090418073216/http://www.brianclough.com/civic_tribute.html Civic Tribute]</ref> A statue of [[Brian Clough]] is located just off the square at the junction of King Street and Queen Street.<ref>[https://www.gpsmycity.com/attractions/brian-clough-statue-48800.html Statue]</ref>\n\nAs well as many shops, bars and department stores, the Square is also home to the [http://www.nctx.co.uk/ Nottingham City Transport] Travel Centre.

In one register, the king (his name appears inscribed around his head) stands in front of his phalanx of heaviy armoured soldiers, with a curved weapon in his right hand, formed of three bars of metal bound together by rings. In another register a figure, the king, his name again inscribed around his head, rides on his chariot in the thick of the battle, while his kilted followers, with helmets on their heads and lances in their hands, march behind him.<ref name=\"JF46\"/>\n\nOn the other side of the stele is an image of [[Ninurta]], a god of war, holding the captive Ummaites in a large net. This implies that Eannatum attributed his victory to Ninurta, and thus that he was in the god's protection (though some accounts say that he attributed his victory to [[Enlil]], the patron deity of Lagash).<ref name=gard/><ref name=\"JF46\"/>\n\nThe victory of Eannatum is mentioned in a fragmentary inscription on the stele, suggesting that after the loss of 3,600 soldiers on the field, [[Ush, king of Umma]], was killed in a rebellion in his capital city of [[Umma]]: \u201c[\u2026] (Eanatum) defeated him.
