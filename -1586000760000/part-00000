Two years later, on 17 January 1983, he appeared on the first edition of the BBC's ''[[Breakfast Time (British TV programme)|Breakfast Time]]'', British television's first national breakfast show, and presented the sports news there until 1985, which meant getting up at two o'clock in the morning five days a week.

The aircraft was now enveloped in flames and ammunition was exploding. Nevertheless, despite the intense heat and the danger from exploding oxygen bottles this officer and airman entered the burning wreckage in an attempt to rescue another member of the crew who was pinned down. Without any protective clothing they lifted aside the burning wreckage and, with great difficulty, succeeded in extricating the injured man.

Shortly after they met, Icke left home following one of a number of frequent arguments he had started having with his father.

Two years later, on 17 January 1983, he appeared on the first edition of the BBC's ''[[Breakfast Time (British TV programme)|Breakfast Time]]'', British television's first national breakfast show, and presented the sports news there until 1985, which meant getting up at two o'clock in the morning five days a week. In the middle of 1983 he achieved his ambition when he co-hosted ''[[Grandstand (TV series)|Grandstand]]'', at the time the BBC's flagship national sports programme.<ref>Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 93\u201395, 99\u2013100.</ref> He also published his first book that year, ''It's a Tough Game, Son!'', about how to break into football.<ref>Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 98.</ref>\n\nIcke and his family moved in 1982 to [[Ryde]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].<ref>Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 109.</ref> His relationship with ''Grandstand'' was short-lived\u2014he wrote that a new editor arrived in 1983 who appeared not to like him\u2014but he continued working for [[BBC Sport]] until 1990, often on [[bowls]] and [[snooker]] programmes, and at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]].<ref>Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 104.</ref> Icke was by then a household name, but has said that a career in television began to lose its appeal to him; he found television workers insecure, shallow and sometimes vicious.<ref>Icke, ''Tales from the Time Loop'', 7.</ref> \n\nIn August 1990 his contract with the BBC was terminated when he initially refused to pay the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] (also known as the \"poll tax\"), a local tax [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s government introduced that year.

{"title_page": "Tax rate", "text_new": "{{For|a type of taxation system in the United Kingdom and elsewhere|Rates (tax)}}\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n{{Taxation|expanded=Distribution}}\nIn a [[tax]] system, the '''tax rate''' is the [[ratio]] (usually expressed as a [[percentage]]) at which a business or person is taxed.  There are several methods used to present a tax rate: statutory, average, marginal, and effective.  These rates can also be presented using different definitions applied to a tax base: inclusive and exclusive.\n\n==Statutory==\nA '''statutory tax rate''' is the legally imposed rate.  An income tax could have multiple statutory rates for different income levels, where a sales tax may have a flat statutory rate.<ref name=\"whatisthedif\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtax.org/PDF/WhatIsTheDifferenceBetweenTaxRates.pdf|title=What is the difference between statutory, average, marginal, and effective tax rates?|publisher=Americans For Fair Taxation|accessdate=2007-04-23|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614190648/http://www.fairtax.org/PDF/WhatIsTheDifferenceBetweenTaxRates.pdf|archivedate=2007-06-14}}</ref>\n\nThe statutory tax rate is expressed as a percentage and will always be higher than the effective tax rate.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://deanebarker.net/blog/post/1024|title=Statutory vs. Effective Tax Rate|date=2011-12-31|newspaper=DeaneBarker.net|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-28}}</ref>\n\n==Average==\nAn '''average tax rate''' is the ratio of the total amount of taxes paid to the total [[tax base]] (taxable income or spending), expressed as a percentage.<ref name=\"whatisthedif\"/>\n\n* Let <math>t</math> be the total tax liability.\n* Let <math>i</math> be the total tax base.\n\n::<math>= \\frac{t}{i}.</math>\n\nIn a [[proportional tax]], the tax rate is fixed and the average tax rate equals this tax rate. In case of [[tax bracket]]s, commonly used for [[progressive tax]]es, the average tax rate increases as taxable income increases through tax brackets, asymptoting to the top tax rate. For example, consider a system with three tax brackets, 10%, 20%, and 30%, where the 10% rate applies to income from $1 to $10,000, the 20% rate applies to income from $10,001 to $20,000, and the 30% rate applies to all income above $20,000. Under this system, someone earning $25,000 would pay $1,000 for the first $10,000 of income (10%); $2,000 for the second $10,000 of income (20%); and $1,500 for the last $5,000 of income (30%). In total, they would pay $4,500, or an 18% average tax rate.\n\n==Marginal==\nA '''marginal tax rate''' is the tax rate on income set at a higher rate for incomes above a designated higher bracket, which in 2016 in the United States was $415,050. For annual income that was above cut off point in that higher bracket, the marginal tax rate in 2016 was 39.6%. For income below the $415,050 cut off, the lower tax rate was 35% or less.<ref name=IRS>{{cite web | url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17/ar02.html | title=2016 Federal Tax Schedules | publisher=[[irs.gov]] | accessdate=2017-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Piper|first=Mike|title=Taxes Made Simple: Income Taxes Explained in 100 Pages or Less|publisher=Simple Subjects, LLC|date=Sep 12, 2014|isbn=978-0981454214}}</ref>\n\nThe marginal tax rate on income can be expressed mathematically as follows:\n\n::<math>\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta i}</math>\n\nwhere ''t'' is the total tax liability and ''i'' is total income, and \u2206 refers to a numerical change. In accounting practice, the tax numerator in the above equation usually includes taxes at federal, state, provincial, and municipal levels. Marginal tax rates are applied to income in countries with progressive taxation schemes, with incremental increases in income taxed in progressively higher [[tax brackets]], resulting in the tax burden being distributed amongst those who can most easily afford it.\n\nMarginal taxes are valuable as they allow governments to generate revenue to fund social services in a way that only affects those who will be the least negatively affected.\n\nIn economics, one heavily disputed theory is that marginal tax rates will impact the incentive of increased income, meaning that higher marginal tax rates cause individuals to have less incentive to earn more.  This is the basis of the [[Laffer curve]] theory, which theorizes that population-wide taxable income decreases as a function of the marginal tax rate, making net governmental tax revenues decrease beyond a certain taxation point.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} \n\nWith a [[flat tax]], by comparison, all income is taxed at the same percentage, regardless of amount. An example is a sales tax where all purchases are taxed equally. A [[Tax per head|poll tax]] is a flat tax of a set dollar amount per person.  The marginal tax in these scenarios would be zero, however, these are both forms of regressive taxation and place a higher tax burden on those who are least able to cope with it, and often results in an underfunded government leading to increased deficits.\n\n===Implicit marginal tax rate===\nFor individuals who receive [[means test]]ed benefits, benefits are decreased as more income is earned. This is sometimes described as an implicit tax.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/the-marginal-tax-rate-mess/|title = The Marginal Tax Rate Mess|last = Folbre|first = Nancy|date = 28 October 2013|work = The New York Times}}</ref> These implicit marginal tax rates can exceed 90%<ref>http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/08/opinion/mccaffery-marginal-tax-rates/</ref> or even greater than 100%.<ref>https://www.epionline.org/wp-content/studies/shaviro_02-1999.pdf</ref> Some economists{{who|date=June 2019}} argue that these issues create a disincentive for work or promotion and may result in a structural income inequality.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Effective==\nThe term '''effective tax rate''' has different meanings in different contexts. Generally its calculation attempts to adjust a nominal tax rate to make it more meaningful.  It may incorporate econometric, estimated, or assumed adjustments to actual data, or may be based entirely on assumptions or simulations.<ref>For example, [http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/files/EffectiveTaxRates1999-2006.pdf one study] provides the caveat that \"The effective tax rate calculations utilize information on the median level of assessment within a given geographical area. While a property is likely to be near the median level of assessment, the actual level of assessment for any given property could be greater or lesser than the median.\"</ref>\n\nThe term is used in financial reporting to measure the total tax paid as a percentage of the company's accounting income, instead of as a percentage of the taxable income.

Pretax cash income is the sum of wages, salaries, self-employment income, rents, taxable and nontaxable interest, dividends, realized capital gains, cash transfer payments, and retirement benefits plus taxes paid by businesses (corporate income taxes and the employer's share of Social Security, Medicare, and federal unemployment insurance payroll taxes) and employee contributions to 401(k) retirement plans.

It will be lower than the statutory rate because unrealized profits are reinvested without tax.\n\nFor example: When dividends are both taxed as income, and also generate a tax credit in the UK and Canadian system, the effective tax rate is the net effect of both - the net tax divided by the actual dividend's value.\n\nFor example: When contributions are made to Tax Deferred Accounts the reduced tax base will result in reduced taxes calculated at the statutory marginal rate.

However, those countries still define their tax rates on a tax exclusive basis.\n\nFor direct rate comparisons between exclusive and inclusive taxes, one rate must be manipulated to look like the other. When a tax system imposes taxes primarily on [[income]], the tax base is a household's pre-tax income. The appropriate income tax rate is applied to the tax base to calculate taxes owed.

If an individual's gross income is $100 and income tax rate is 20%, taxes owed equals $20.\n\nThe income tax is taken \"off the top\", so the individual is left with $80 in after-tax money. Some tax laws impose taxes on a tax base equal to the pre-tax portion of a good's price. Unlike the income tax example above, these taxes do not include actual taxes owed as part of the base. A good priced at $80 with a 25% exclusive sales tax rate yields $20 in taxes owed. Since the sales tax is added \"on the top\", the individual pays $20 of tax on $80 of pre-tax goods for a total cost of $100. In either case, the tax base of $100 can be treated as two parts\u2014$80 of after-tax spending money and $20 of taxes owed.

There are several methods used to present a tax rate: statutory, average, marginal, and effective.  These rates can also be presented using different definitions applied to a tax base: inclusive and exclusive.\n\n==Statutory==\nA '''statutory tax rate''' is the legally imposed rate.  An income tax could have multiple statutory rates for different income levels, where a sales tax may have a flat statutory rate.<ref name=\"whatisthedif\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtax.org/PDF/WhatIsTheDifferenceBetweenTaxRates.pdf|title=What is the difference between statutory, average, marginal, and effective tax rates?|publisher=Americans For Fair Taxation|accessdate=2007-04-23|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614190648/http://www.fairtax.org/PDF/WhatIsTheDifferenceBetweenTaxRates.pdf|archivedate=2007-06-14}}</ref>\n\nThe statutory tax rate is expressed as a percentage and will always be higher than the effective tax rate.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://deanebarker.net/blog/post/1024|title=Statutory vs. Effective Tax Rate|date=2011-12-31|newspaper=DeaneBarker.net|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-28}}</ref>\n\n==Average==\nAn '''average tax rate''' is the ratio of the total amount of taxes paid to the total [[tax base]] (taxable income or spending), expressed as a percentage.<ref name=\"whatisthedif\"/>\n\n* Let <math>t</math> be the total tax liability.\n* Let <math>i</math> be the total tax base.\n\n::<math>= \\frac{t}{i}.</math>\n\nIn a [[proportional tax]], the tax rate is fixed and the average tax rate equals this tax rate. In case of [[tax bracket]]s, commonly used for [[progressive tax]]es, the average tax rate increases as taxable income increases through tax brackets, asymptoting to the top tax rate. For example, consider a system with three tax brackets, 10%, 20%, and 30%, where the 10% rate applies to income from $1 to $10,000, the 20% rate applies to income from $10,001 to $20,000, and the 30% rate applies to all income above $20,000. Under this system, someone earning $25,000 would pay $1,000 for the first $10,000 of income (10%); $2,000 for the second $10,000 of income (20%); and $1,500 for the last $5,000 of income (30%). In total, they would pay $4,500, or an 18% average tax rate.\n\n==Marginal==\nA '''marginal tax rate''' is the tax rate on income set at a higher rate for incomes above a designated higher bracket, which in 2016 in the United States was $415,050. For annual income that was above cut off point in that higher bracket, the marginal tax rate in 2016 was 39.6%. For income below the $415,050 cut off, the lower tax rate was 35% or less.<ref name=IRS>{{cite web | url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17/ar02.html | title=2016 Federal Tax Schedules | publisher=[[irs.gov]] | accessdate=2017-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Piper|first=Mike|title=Taxes Made Simple: Income Taxes Explained in 100 Pages or Less|publisher=Simple Subjects, LLC|date=Sep 12, 2014|isbn=978-0981454214}}</ref>\n\nThe marginal tax rate on income can be expressed mathematically as follows:\n\n::<math>\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta i}</math>\n\nwhere ''t'' is the total tax liability and ''i'' is total income, and \u2206 refers to a numerical change. In accounting practice, the tax numerator in the above equation usually includes taxes at federal, state, provincial, and municipal levels. Marginal tax rates are applied to income in countries with progressive taxation schemes, with incremental increases in income taxed in progressively higher [[tax brackets]], resulting in the tax burden being distributed amongst those who can most easily afford it.\n\nMarginal taxes are valuable as they allow governments to generate revenue to fund social services in a way that only affects those who will be the least negatively affected.\n\nIn economics, one heavily disputed theory is that marginal tax rates will impact the incentive of increased income, meaning that higher marginal tax rates cause individuals to have less incentive to earn more.  This is the basis of the [[Laffer curve]] theory, which theorizes that population-wide taxable income decreases as a function of the marginal tax rate, making net governmental tax revenues decrease beyond a certain taxation point.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} \n\nWith a [[flat tax]], by comparison, all income is taxed at the same percentage, regardless of amount. An example is a sales tax where all purchases are taxed equally. A [[Tax per head|poll tax]] is a flat tax of a set dollar amount per person.  The marginal tax in these scenarios would be zero, however, these are both forms of regressive taxation and place a higher tax burden on those who are least able to cope with it, and often results in an underfunded government leading to increased deficits.\n\n===Implicit marginal tax rate===\nFor individuals who receive [[means test]]ed benefits, benefits are decreased as more income is earned. This is sometimes described as an implicit tax.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/the-marginal-tax-rate-mess/|title = The Marginal Tax Rate Mess|last = Folbre|first = Nancy|date = 28 October 2013|work = The New York Times}}</ref> These implicit marginal tax rates can exceed 90%<ref>http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/08/opinion/mccaffery-marginal-tax-rates/</ref> or even greater than 100%.<ref>https://www.epionline.org/wp-content/studies/shaviro_02-1999.pdf</ref> Some economists{{who|date=June 2019}} argue that these issues create a disincentive for work or promotion and may result in a structural income inequality.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Effective==\nThe term '''effective tax rate''' has different meanings in different contexts. Generally its calculation attempts to adjust a nominal tax rate to make it more meaningful.  It may incorporate econometric, estimated, or assumed adjustments to actual data, or may be based entirely on assumptions or simulations.<ref>For example, [http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/files/EffectiveTaxRates1999-2006.pdf one study] provides the caveat that \"The effective tax rate calculations utilize information on the median level of assessment within a given geographical area. While a property is likely to be near the median level of assessment, the actual level of assessment for any given property could be greater or lesser than the median.\"</ref>\n\nThe term is used in financial reporting to measure the total tax paid as a percentage of the company's accounting income, instead of as a percentage of the taxable income. [[International Accounting Standard]] 12,<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/docs/consolidated/ias12_en.pdf IAS 12], paragraphs 86.</ref> define it as income tax expense or benefit for accounting purposes divided by accounting profit.

Marilyn Manson is a heavy metal band that the NJSEA has deemed objectionable. Marilyn Manson's right of passage to perform at Giants Stadium is now impeded by roadblocks created by the collision between well established constitutional and contractual principles. This Court ordered on April 29, 1997 that the NJSEA appear on May 6, 1997, to show cause why the NJSEA should not be preliminarily and thereafter permanently enjoined and restrained from: (1) prohibiting plaintiffs Marilyn Manson, Inc., Artie Festivals N.J., Inc. (\"Artie\"), and Delsener/Slater Enterprises, Ltd. (\"Delsener/Slater\") from presenting the OzzFest '97 concert performance including the band Marilyn Manson at Giants Stadium on June 15, 1997; (2) prohibiting or otherwise interfering with ticket sales for OzzFest '97 to be held at Giants Stadium on June 15, 1997; and (3) taking any action to repudiate or otherwise breach its agreement to lease Giants Stadium to plaintiffs on June 15, 1997. Plaintiffs ultimately seek (1) a judgment declaring that the NJSEA has violated plaintiffs' rights under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the corresponding provisions of the New Jersey Constitution; (2) an order permanently enjoining the NJSEA from violating plaintiffs' Federal and State constitutional rights, (3) an award of damages, costs, and attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988, and (4) a judgment on plaintiffs' claims for anticipatory breach of contract and promissory estoppel.

So to fuck with the police I had a friend of mine, Corey, who happens to be black, accompany me and my bodyguard, Aaron, into my meeting with these moronic individuals. Wearing a police hat, I asked the officer in charge what problems he had with our show. He nervously shuffled through his notes and said \"There's one song in particular\", as if he couldn't remember what it was, and then he mumbles \"Rock and Roll Nigger\", specifically so as not to offend Corey, who looks like he'll kick the shit out of anyone who's white. I went on to explain to him that not only did Patti Smith write the song (and not me) but that the song represents that isolation and discrimination of people for their ideas and their beliefs and their art which ironically was exactly what this asshole was doing. He still didn't seem to understand so I told him quite simply I would do the song and we would see what happened when it was done. Though I told him the show would not be changed, I did change it in several simple ways. I donned a police uniform and something given to me by a fan, a badge formerly in the possession of an officer shot in the line of duty. I also invited Corey to help me sing, in particular the lines with the word nigger in them. We performed the song as an encore, and I introduced it by saying, \"I want to tell you about something that happened recently. There's a song that's twenty years old written by a woman named Patti Smith. And a couple of white cops came up to me and they said, 'You can't sing that song.'

He called the Sneaker Pimps \"very confused individuals.\" He disputed their claim that they weren't issued a master recording, suggesting that they had created a remix for the song, but refused permission for it to appear on the [[Single (music)|single]] when they were informed it would appear as a [[A-side and B-side|b-side]], instead of as the main single version. He also characterized their involvement as \"a bit of a favor, in a sense, because we had already written the song, and I was interested in finding a girl to sing [[Backing vocalist|back-up vocals]] on it, and [they] were begging, asking to be involved with us. I thought they had a good single, and the girl's voice was great. When we worked on the song, I think they were a little upset, because there wasn't much for them to do because the song was already done.\" Manson also announced plans to shoot a music video for the song following the conclusion of the tour in Mexico City.<ref name=\"confusedpimps\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1431778/marilyn-manson-sneaker-pimps-very-confused-individuals/ |title=Marilyn Manson: Sneaker Pimps \"Very Confused Individuals\" |publisher=MTV |date=1997-09-16 |accessdate=2019-01-14 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114034155/http://www.mtv.com/news/1431778/marilyn-manson-sneaker-pimps-very-confused-individuals/ |archivedate=2019-01-14}}</ref>\n\nThe second to last show of the tour on September 14, 1997 at [[Santiago]], [[Chile]]'s Central Court National Stadium attracted protests from a [[bishop]] and a local trucker's [[Trade union|union]]. The protesters alleged the band was promoting Satanism in the majority [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] nation.<ref name=\"confusedpimps\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nEight days after the end of the tour former guitarist, [[Scott Putesky]] (aka Daisy Berkowitz), filed a lawsuit against the band, their lawyer, Nothing Records and the frontman for [[breach of contract]] and [[legal malpractice]]. The suit alleged [[wrongful dismissal]] and outstanding [[Royalty payment#Music|royalties]]. Putesky claimed he was discharged after a six-year tenure, which included helping start the band, with no warning during the recording of ''Antichrist Superstar''. He said the band simply bought him a plane ticket home as a way of informing him his employment was terminated. The band's manager asserted that Putesky sent a letter of resignation and thought the departure was on amicable terms.<ref name=\"ScottSues\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\nReviews of the tour from music critics of the period were generally divided among political, religious and generational lines, with a few notable exceptions. Before the Salt Lake City show even commenced, the editorial board of ''The Salt Lake Tribune'' dismissed the band's songs as \"profanity [laced] and [[anti-establishment]] swill\" and likened allowing such \"low-class entertainment\" to perform at the Utah State Fairpark to \"accommodating the [[Ku Klux Klan]].\"<ref name=\"discordantjournalism\">{{cite news |author=Tribune Editorial | date= 1997-01-11 | url=https://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=print&p_docid=100F81522A6AF27F | title= Discordant Concert | work= The Salt Lake Tribune | access-date= 2019-02-06 | page= A8}}</ref> Guided by that editorial slant, ''The Salt Lake Tribune'' writer Steven Brophy disparaged the actual concert. Seemingly disappointed with the absence of the band's alleged props and antics such as, \"[[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] [[Sex toy|sexual devices]], on-stage nudity and simulated sex acts\", Brophy dismissed the show as \"tame, poorly done [[B movie|B-movie]] theatrics\" and the band thus, \"if the [[Sex Pistols]] were the original [[The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle|great rock n' roll swindle]], then Marilyn Manson is the sequel.\"<ref name=\"mormonassholewriteconcertreview\"/> Scott Iwasaki of ''Deseret News'' shared similar sentiment going so far as to describe Manson as \"the pretentious prince of industrial metal\", the band as \"uninspiring\", and the bible-tearing portion of the performance, \"been there, done that. C'mon guys, time for a new [[gimmick]]. This one's getting old.\" Both writers disdained the band's song catalog with the sole exception of their cover of Eurythmics' \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\", which they noted elicited a [[sing-along]] from the audience. While Brophy thought opening act L7 \"outplayed Manson\", Iwasaki was less enthusiastic and described their \"slick choreography and power chords [as] nothing but [[Judas Priest]] leftovers.\"<ref name=\"pretentiousmormonpretendtoberockjournalist\"/>\n\n{{quote|Then there's the mainstream media, playing its usual double-faced game. Namely: run endless sensationalistic stories about Manson, and then run numerous editorials rife with the usual \"we're so jaded and above it all\" tone [that] give the impression \"it's just Alice Cooper again\", as if any kid today could give a flying whizz about a guy who last released a memorable album in 1973, you know, before most of Manson's fans were born.<ref name=\"MansonWantsYouToThink\"/>}} \n{{quote|Unlike the other theatrical rock performers to who he's often compared&mdash;Cooper, KISS&mdash;Manson's art is not merely meant for the passive consumption of spectacle. He's overtly rhetorical, constantly striving to influence his audience and uses his theatrics to implant within them the germ of his Satanic philosophy, which afterall is really a more colorful version of good ol' atheistic existentialism a la Nietzsche, Sartre and Camus. This theme was exemplified in Manson's forlorn reading of \"Man That You Fear\" at the show's conclusion, standing, as he was, alone at center stage, slowly buried beneath a barrage of artificial snow.\n\nIn a world in which the anaesthetized, TV-fed masses wait to be told what to think by slimy politicians, hypocritical religious leaders and conniving corporations, Manson's true sin is to posit the notion that all of these people are full of shit, that the only way to live an authentic life is to take away their reins of power and remake yourself in your own image. To think for yourself: A notion that truly scares many people out of their wits.\n\nNever mind the bollocks&mdash;that's why they're protesting.<ref name=\"MansonWantsYouToThink\"/>}}\n\n== Broadcasts and recordings ==\n\nDue to \"disagreements\" between Nothing Records and its distributor, Interscope, ''Dead To The World'' and ''[[Remix & Repent]]'' were put on hold from release in 1997.<ref name=\"DTTWVidDelay\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1431775/new-nin-video-but-no-new-manson/ |title=New NIN Video, But No New Manson |publisher=MTV |date=1997-11-04 |accessdate=2019-01-14 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114030219/http://www.mtv.com/news/1431775/new-nin-video-but-no-new-manson/ |archivedate=2019-01-14}}</ref> It was finally launched on February 10, 1998 on VHS, documenting the infamous tour of the same name by Marilyn Manson.

Marilyn Manson is a heavy metal band that the NJSEA has deemed objectionable. Marilyn Manson's right of passage to perform at Giants Stadium is now impeded by roadblocks created by the collision between well established constitutional and contractual principles. This Court ordered on April 29, 1997 that the NJSEA appear on May 6, 1997, to show cause why the NJSEA should not be preliminarily and thereafter permanently enjoined and restrained from: (1) prohibiting plaintiffs Marilyn Manson, Inc., Artie Festivals N.J., Inc. (\"Artie\"), and Delsener/Slater Enterprises, Ltd. (\"Delsener/Slater\") from presenting the OzzFest '97 concert performance including the band Marilyn Manson at Giants Stadium on June 15, 1997; (2) prohibiting or otherwise interfering with ticket sales for OzzFest '97 to be held at Giants Stadium on June 15, 1997; and (3) taking any action to repudiate or otherwise breach its agreement to lease Giants Stadium to plaintiffs on June 15, 1997. Plaintiffs ultimately seek (1) a judgment declaring that the NJSEA has violated plaintiffs' rights under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the corresponding provisions of the New Jersey Constitution; (2) an order permanently enjoining the NJSEA from violating plaintiffs' Federal and State constitutional rights, (3) an award of damages, costs, and attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988, and (4) a judgment on plaintiffs' claims for anticipatory breach of contract and promissory estoppel.

So to fuck with the police I had a friend of mine, Corey, who happens to be black, accompany me and my bodyguard, Aaron, into my meeting with these moronic individuals. Wearing a police hat, I asked the officer in charge what problems he had with our show. He nervously shuffled through his notes and said \"There's one song in particular\", as if he couldn't remember what it was, and then he mumbles \"Rock and Roll Nigger\", specifically so as not to offend Corey, who looks like he'll kick the shit out of anyone who's white. I went on to explain to him that not only did Patti Smith write the song (and not me) but that the song represents that isolation and discrimination of people for their ideas and their beliefs and their art which ironically was exactly what this asshole was doing. He still didn't seem to understand so I told him quite simply I would do the song and we would see what happened when it was done. Though I told him the show would not be changed, I did change it in several simple ways. I donned a police uniform and something given to me by a fan, a badge formerly in the possession of an officer shot in the line of duty. I also invited Corey to help me sing, in particular the lines with the word nigger in them. We performed the song as an encore, and I introduced it by saying, \"I want to tell you about something that happened recently. There's a song that's twenty years old written by a woman named Patti Smith. And a couple of white cops came up to me and they said, 'You can't sing that song.'

According to Manson, the songwriting process consisted of his band writing and recording the song. They then sent the Sneaker Pimps a [[Audio mastering|master tape]] of their work, \"almost in a [[remix]] sense, that they would take our ideas and interpret them.\" Manson described the Sneaker Pimps' contributions to the song as \"very magical\" and added that he \"adored\" vocalist [[Kelli Ali]]'s input.

He called the Sneaker Pimps \"very confused individuals.\" He disputed their claim that they weren't issued a master recording, suggesting that they had created a remix for the song, but refused permission for it to appear on the [[Single (music)|single]] when they were informed it would appear as a [[A-side and B-side|b-side]], instead of as the main single version. He also characterized their involvement as \"a bit of a favor, in a sense, because we had already written the song, and I was interested in finding a girl to sing [[Backing vocalist|back-up vocals]] on it, and [they] were begging, asking to be involved with us. I thought they had a good single, and the girl's voice was great. When we worked on the song, I think they were a little upset, because there wasn't much for them to do because the song was already done.\" Manson also announced plans to shoot a music video for the song following the conclusion of the tour in Mexico City.<ref name=\"confusedpimps\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1431778/marilyn-manson-sneaker-pimps-very-confused-individuals/ |title=Marilyn Manson: Sneaker Pimps \"Very Confused Individuals\" |publisher=MTV |date=1997-09-16 |accessdate=2019-01-14 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114034155/http://www.mtv.com/news/1431778/marilyn-manson-sneaker-pimps-very-confused-individuals/ |archivedate=2019-01-14}}</ref>\n\nThe second to last show of the tour on September 14, 1997 at [[Santiago]], [[Chile]]'s Central Court National Stadium attracted protests from a [[bishop]] and a local trucker's [[Trade union|union]]. The protesters alleged the band was promoting Satanism in the majority [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] nation.<ref name=\"confusedpimps\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nEight days after the end of the tour former guitarist, [[Scott Putesky]] (aka Daisy Berkowitz), filed a lawsuit against the band, their lawyer, Nothing Records and the frontman for [[breach of contract]] and [[legal malpractice]]. The suit alleged [[wrongful dismissal]] and outstanding [[Royalty payment#Music|royalties]]. Putesky claimed he was discharged after a six-year tenure, which included helping start the band, with no warning during the recording of ''Antichrist Superstar''. He said the band simply bought him a plane ticket home as a way of informing him his employment was terminated. The band's manager asserted that Putesky sent a letter of resignation and thought the departure was on amicable terms.<ref name=\"ScottSues\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\nReviews of the tour from music critics of the period were generally divided among political, religious and generational lines, with a few notable exceptions. Before the Salt Lake City show even commenced, the editorial board of ''The Salt Lake Tribune'' dismissed the band's songs as \"profanity [laced] and [[anti-establishment]] swill\" and likened allowing such \"low-class entertainment\" to perform at the Utah State Fairpark to \"accommodating the [[Ku Klux Klan]].\"<ref name=\"discordantjournalism\">{{cite news |author=Tribune Editorial | date= 1997-01-11 | url=https://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=print&p_docid=100F81522A6AF27F | title= Discordant Concert | work= The Salt Lake Tribune | access-date= 2019-02-06 | page= A8}}</ref> Guided by that editorial slant, ''The Salt Lake Tribune'' writer Steven Brophy disparaged the actual concert. Seemingly disappointed with the absence of the band's alleged props and antics such as, \"[[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] [[Sex toy|sexual devices]], on-stage nudity and simulated sex acts\", Brophy dismissed the show as \"tame, poorly done [[B movie|B-movie]] theatrics\" and the band thus, \"if the [[Sex Pistols]] were the original [[The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle|great rock n' roll swindle]], then Marilyn Manson is the sequel.\"<ref name=\"mormonassholewriteconcertreview\"/> Scott Iwasaki of ''Deseret News'' shared similar sentiment going so far as to describe Manson as \"the pretentious prince of industrial metal\", the band as \"uninspiring\", and the bible-tearing portion of the performance, \"been there, done that. C'mon guys, time for a new [[gimmick]]. This one's getting old.\" Both writers disdained the band's song catalog with the sole exception of their cover of Eurythmics' \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\", which they noted elicited a [[sing-along]] from the audience. While Brophy thought opening act L7 \"outplayed Manson\", Iwasaki was less enthusiastic and described their \"slick choreography and power chords [as] nothing but [[Judas Priest]] leftovers.\"<ref name=\"pretentiousmormonpretendtoberockjournalist\"/>\n\n{{quote|Then there's the mainstream media, playing its usual double-faced game. Namely: run endless sensationalistic stories about Manson, and then run numerous editorials rife with the usual \"we're so jaded and above it all\" tone [that] give the impression \"it's just Alice Cooper again\", as if any kid today could give a flying whizz about a guy who last released a memorable album in 1973, you know, before most of Manson's fans were born.<ref name=\"MansonWantsYouToThink\"/>}} \n{{quote|Unlike the other theatrical rock performers to who he's often compared&mdash;Cooper, KISS&mdash;Manson's art is not merely meant for the passive consumption of spectacle. He's overtly rhetorical, constantly striving to influence his audience and uses his theatrics to implant within them the germ of his Satanic philosophy, which afterall is really a more colorful version of good ol' atheistic existentialism a la Nietzsche, Sartre and Camus. This theme was exemplified in Manson's forlorn reading of \"Man That You Fear\" at the show's conclusion, standing, as he was, alone at center stage, slowly buried beneath a barrage of artificial snow.\n\nIn a world in which the anaesthetized, TV-fed masses wait to be told what to think by slimy politicians, hypocritical religious leaders and conniving corporations, Manson's true sin is to posit the notion that all of these people are full of shit, that the only way to live an authentic life is to take away their reins of power and remake yourself in your own image. To think for yourself: A notion that truly scares many people out of their wits.\n\nNever mind the bollocks&mdash;that's why they're protesting.<ref name=\"MansonWantsYouToThink\"/>}}\n\n== Broadcasts and recordings ==\n\nDue to \"disagreements\" between Nothing Records and its distributor, Interscope, ''Dead To The World'' and ''[[Remix & Repent]]'' were put on hold from release in 1997.<ref name=\"DTTWVidDelay\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1431775/new-nin-video-but-no-new-manson/ |title=New NIN Video, But No New Manson |publisher=MTV |date=1997-11-04 |accessdate=2019-01-14 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114030219/http://www.mtv.com/news/1431775/new-nin-video-but-no-new-manson/ |archivedate=2019-01-14}}</ref> It was finally launched on February 10, 1998 on VHS, documenting the infamous tour of the same name by Marilyn Manson.

Mellor''' (born [[Yorkshire]], UK) is a British scientist, probably best known for his \"unified vacuole theory\" which states that in plant [[endosymbiosis|endosymbioses]] generally, the micro-symbiont and the macro-symbiont share their lytic [[Vacuole|vacuolar]] compartments [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuole]. This stems from his earlier [[symbiosome]] (or \"symbiosome is a lysosome\" theory) which states that the organelle that microsymbionts inhabit, partially takes over the [[lysosomal]] functions in these cells, analogous to the role of protein bodies in seeds [http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/8/831 (Mellor, 1989)] in particular that the [[rhizobia]]l [[symbiosome]] is an organ-specific form of lysosome or [[vacuole]] in [[legume]] [[root nodule]]s. This enables the symbionts to share parts of their metabolism, especially nitrogen metabolism, in (terminally) differentiated cells. This view was very highly contested during the 1990s when the \"peribacteroid membrane\" was initially but wrongly considered as being involuted plasma-membrane (or [[cell membrane]], as it is known in animals), but the lysosomal view is now generally accepted as being exhaustively experimentally verified and has entered mainstream thinking in plant physiology. Over 30 years later, and over 20 years after leaving biology as his main interest, Google Scholar (in 2020) verified R. B. Mellor as still being number 33 in the world as most influential researcher in the field of plant-microbe interactions.  \n\n== The Marburg and Basel Years (plant biology) ==\nR. B. Mellor was also very interested in how plants distinguish between symbiotic and pathogenic infections and in 1984 set about measuring defence responses including [[ Phytoalexin ]] and [[ Chitinase ]] in nodules infected with different [[rhizobia]]l mutants and it gradually appeared that in Rhizobia the nod genes are responsible for producing different [[nod factor]]s (lipo-chitin molecules) and that amongst their many effects was that they can provoke plant defence responses, so that it was essential that these genes were switched off (by molecules called \"nodoffs\") after infection, or that symbiosis could not take place. This convincing model won general acclaim and indeed the paper with David Collinge [https://plen.ku.dk/english/employees/?pure=en/persons/11699] was later reprinted (Mellor and Collinge, 1995) as that year\u2019s number one most important publication in the area of Plant Sciences <ref> [https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/46.1.1-a] ''JEB'' </ref> .\n\nIn other works R. B. Mellor has claimed that in [[legume]]s the [[root nodule]] cytoplasm may be under water stress and the plant may combat this by utilising the bacterial/fungal (in the case of e.g. vesicular [[arbuscular mycorrhiza]]) disaccharide sugar [[trehalose]]. The concept has been repeatedly confirmed e.g <ref> [https://doi.org/10.1007/s00344-018-9876-x] Kosar, F., Akram, N.A., Sadiq, M. et al. J Plant Growth Regul (2019) 38: 606</ref>.  and indeed, this effect explains why nodulated plants have a higher [[drought-tolerance]] than non-nodulated plants <ref> [https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1399-3054.1998.1020303.x] ''Physiol Plant''</ref>, which clearly is an issue of primary importance in responding to climate change and [[global warming]].\n\n== The G\u00f6ttingen Years (environmental nanotech) ==\nHowever, R. B. Mellor was also interested in [[applied science]] and after leaving the University of Basel he became Director of R&D at a German chemical company where he led the group that invented and patented a system to power immobilized oxido-reductase enzymes and artificial co-factors using [[Electric power|electrical power]] out of a domestic socket.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v355/n6362/abs/355717a0.html ''Nature'']</ref> The impact of this breakthrough was absolutely enormous: For example, twenty-five years later the authors Eltarahony et al [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215017X17303545] in their round-up review paper state that \"... <i>Mellor et al. [1992] pioneered the concept of current promotion, electrode bioreactor and denitrification control, this concept, [is now] widely used to treat different types of wastewater, such as toxic and refractory organic wastewater as well as wastewater containing heavy metal ions. </i> ... \". Today newer developments and derivations of this technology are used to ensure safe water supplies for well over half a billion people worldwide. In 2020, R B Mellor was identified by Google Scholar as being in the top 20 researchers worldwide in environmental nanotechnology \"molecular machines\".\n\n== The London Years (computing and maths) ==\nIn early 2000 R. B. Mellor joined and helped [[Startup company|start-up]] the IT University of Copenhagen [http://www.itu.dk], alongside [[Mads Tofte]] and others, and subsequently in 2005 became Director of Enterprise at Kingston University [http://www.kingston.ac.uk], London (and quadrupling enterprise income) in Computing, Information Systems and Mathematics, while teaching the mathematical modelling of business processes and knowledge management at MSc level. The field of 'Knowledge Management' had been somewhat moribund since the [[I-Space (conceptual framework)|I-Space]] concept of the late [[Max Boisot]], but Mellor, influenced by [[Stiglitz]], realized that econometric methods can be used to quantify the value of knowledge management and his breakthrough computer modelling resulted in a complete explanation of the developmental life-cycle of SMEs ([[small and medium-sized enterprises]]), firstly in his 2011 book and then later expanded upon in his 2018 publication \"Big Data Modelling the Knowledge Economy\" <ref>[https://dx.doi.org/10.1504/IJKBD.2018.094896 ''IJKBD''] </ref>. In 2020, R B Mellor was identified by Google Scholar as being in the top 10 researchers worldwide in computer modelling. \n\nHe runs a Masters programme around IT Consultancy [https://www.kingston.ac.uk/postgraduate-course/it-strategic-innovation-msc/] as well as a select \"[[Big Data]]\" research group engaged with modelling organizations, especially [[Science Park]]s, in the context of [[regional development]]. \n\nEnquiries about self-funded PhD projects from motivated individuals interested in pursuing doctoral studies on this and similar topics are welcome. \n\nMost recently, working together with his friend Matthias Georg Will [https://ethik.wiwi.uni-halle.de/2166_199920/matthias/], an econometric computer model was developed which explains why, in modern business environments, flat organizations can only exist if employees are able to competently evaluate incoming innovations and their judgement is accepted by their managers, a situation typified by the successful tech firms. This is because, as R. B. Mellor pointed out, the benefits of a successful innovation are smaller than the losses incurred by adopting a poor innovation. Thus, if employees cannot distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" innovations, then in environments where poor-fit innovations abound, the formation of poorly-performing hierarchies in firms is inevitable (and is actually surprisingly sustainable) because even managers that make decisions by flipping a coin can avoid expensive harm, half of the time. <ref>[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpat.2019.03.007 ''Simpat''] </ref>.\n\n==Personal life==\nKeen on outdoor activities, R. B. Mellor has cycled across most of Europe; in the 1970s with his friend [[John Jowett]] he traversed Scotland on foot and also in 1980 co-wrote \u201cThe Pennine Way Pub Guide\u201d (with John Jowett and Paul Wilson). He has climbed most of the central [[Pyrenees]] and in the 80's and 90's was occasional guide (bergf\u00fchrer) for the Alpine Association (Alpenverein) in the [[Dolomites]] and Austrian [[Eastern Alps]]. Always interested in music, he added support to the Danish [[Soca music]] band [https://www.worldcat.org/title/lets-go-bananas/oclc/471326612 Tropicats] on their 1995 CD \"Lets go Bananas\". He holds an enhanced certificate for working with children and the vulnerable, and can often be found holding careers talks etc in local schools and colleges.\n\n==Works== \nRobert B. Mellor, BSc, PhD, DSc was the first member of his family to ever attend university, nonetheless he has taught fluently in a range of languages at the [[University of Basel]] (founded 1460), [[K\u00f8benhavns Universitet]] (founded 1479), the [[University of Marburg]] (founded 1527) and has delivered invited lectures at many other Universities around the globe. Today he is author of over 100 scientific publications in reputable journals as well as eleven books, several of which have been translated into other languages. His impact factor (h-Index) is 25 [https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=4q0Q7N8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate] , putting him well into the top decile (10%) of researchers world-wide. He is an active consultant with over twelve years industrial experience and he lectures at postgraduate level on subjects like \u2018information systems and econometrics\u2019, \u2018mathematical knowledge management\u2019, \u2018strategic innovation\u2019 and \u2018tech entrepreneurship\u2019. He has received many international prizes for his work and ideas. \n\n===Articles===\n* Mellor, R.B., J. Ronnenberg, W.H. Campbell and S.

Mellor was also interested in [[applied science]] and after leaving the University of Basel he became Director of R&D at a German chemical company where he led the group that invented and patented a system to power immobilized oxido-reductase enzymes and artificial co-factors using [[Electric power|electrical power]] out of a domestic socket.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v355/n6362/abs/355717a0.html ''Nature'']</ref> The impact of this breakthrough was absolutely enormous: For example, twenty-five years later the authors Eltarahony et al [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215017X17303545] in their round-up review paper state that \"... <i>Mellor et al. [1992] pioneered the concept of current promotion, electrode bioreactor and denitrification control, this concept, [is now] widely used to treat different types of wastewater, such as toxic and refractory organic wastewater as well as wastewater containing heavy metal ions. </i> ... \". Today newer developments and derivations of this technology are used to ensure safe water supplies for well over half a billion people worldwide. In 2020, R B Mellor was identified by Google Scholar as being in the top 20 researchers worldwide in environmental nanotechnology \"molecular machines\".\n\n== The London Years (computing and maths) ==\nIn early 2000 R. B. Mellor joined and helped [[Startup company|start-up]] the IT University of Copenhagen [http://www.itu.dk], alongside [[Mads Tofte]] and others, and subsequently in 2005 became Director of Enterprise at Kingston University [http://www.kingston.ac.uk], London (and quadrupling enterprise income) in Computing, Information Systems and Mathematics, while teaching the mathematical modelling of business processes and knowledge management at MSc level. The field of 'Knowledge Management' had been somewhat moribund since the [[I-Space (conceptual framework)|I-Space]] concept of the late [[Max Boisot]], but Mellor, influenced by [[Stiglitz]], realized that econometric methods can be used to quantify the value of knowledge management and his breakthrough computer modelling resulted in a complete explanation of the developmental life-cycle of SMEs ([[small and medium-sized enterprises]]), firstly in his 2011 book and then later expanded upon in his 2018 publication \"Big Data Modelling the Knowledge Economy\" <ref>[https://dx.doi.org/10.1504/IJKBD.2018.094896 ''IJKBD''] </ref>. In 2020, R B Mellor was identified by Google Scholar as being in the top 10 researchers worldwide in computer modelling. \n\nHe runs a Masters programme around IT Consultancy [https://www.kingston.ac.uk/postgraduate-course/it-strategic-innovation-msc/] as well as a select \"[[Big Data]]\" research group engaged with modelling organizations, especially [[Science Park]]s, in the context of [[regional development]]. \n\nEnquiries about self-funded PhD projects from motivated individuals interested in pursuing doctoral studies on this and similar topics are welcome. \n\nMost recently, working together with his friend Matthias Georg Will [https://ethik.wiwi.uni-halle.de/2166_199920/matthias/], an econometric computer model was developed which explains why, in modern business environments, flat organizations can only exist if employees are able to competently evaluate incoming innovations and their judgement is accepted by their managers, a situation typified by the successful tech firms. This is because, as R. B. Mellor pointed out, the benefits of a successful innovation are smaller than the losses incurred by adopting a poor innovation. Thus, if employees cannot distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" innovations, then in environments where poor-fit innovations abound, the formation of poorly-performing hierarchies in firms is inevitable (and is actually surprisingly sustainable) because even managers that make decisions by flipping a coin can avoid expensive harm, half of the time. <ref>[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpat.2019.03.007 ''Simpat''] </ref>.\n\n==Personal life==\nKeen on outdoor activities, R. B. Mellor has cycled across most of Europe; in the 1970\u2019s with his friend [[John Jowett]] he traversed Scotland on foot and also in 1980 co-wrote \u201cThe Pennine Way Pub Guide\u201d (with John Jowett and Paul Wilson). He has climbed most of the central [[Pyrenees]] and in the 80's and 90's was occasional guide (bergf\u00fchrer) for the Alpine Association (Alpenverein) in the [[Dolomites]] and Austrian [[Eastern Alps]]. Always interested in music, he added support to the Danish [[Soca music]] band [https://www.worldcat.org/title/lets-go-bananas/oclc/471326612 Tropicats] on their 1995 CD \"Lets go Bananas\". He holds an enhanced certificate for working with children and the vulnerable, and can often be found holding careers talks etc in local schools and colleges.\n\n==Works== \nRobert B. Mellor, BSc, PhD, DSc was the first member of his family to ever attend university, nonetheless he has taught fluently in a range of languages at the [[University of Basel]] (founded 1460), [[K\u00f8benhavns Universitet]] (founded 1479), the [[University of Marburg]] (founded 1527) and has delivered invited lectures at many other Universities around the globe. Today he is author of over 100 scientific publications in reputable journals as well as eleven books, several of which have been translated into other languages. His impact factor (h-Index) is 25 [https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=4q0Q7N8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate] , putting him well into the top decile (10%) of researchers world-wide. He is an active consultant with over twelve years industrial experience and he lectures at postgraduate level on subjects like \u2018information systems and econometrics\u2019, \u2018mathematical knowledge management\u2019, \u2018strategic innovation\u2019 and \u2018tech entrepreneurship\u2019. He has received many international prizes for his work and ideas. \n\n===Articles===\n* Mellor, R.B., J. Ronnenberg, W.H. Campbell and S.
