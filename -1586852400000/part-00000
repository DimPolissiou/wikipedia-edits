He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nMasvidal co-founded Cynic with drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in the late 80\u2019s, having released four demos from 1988-1991 that circulated in the underground tape trading community. Masvidal developed a reputation in the South Florida music scene for his musicianship and attention began to grow quickly around the band. In 1989, while still in high school, Masvidal toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]], but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular act, but Masvidal persevered with Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990. In 1991, Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert were recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''. In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine placed the album as the 70th greatest metal album of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-100-greatest-metal-albums-of-all-time-113614/|title=The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time|last=Christe|first=Christopher R.

Roadrunner released a reissue of Focus in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. Cynic took a 12 year hiatus in 1995 after recording \"''The Portal Tapes\"'' demos. Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]], where he also began work as a session musician and composer for network TV and film. [[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[\u00c6on Spoke]]]]\n\n\n\n\nDuring Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[\u00c6on Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\".

OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, OwL unveiled a video for the song \"Kali In My Arms\", which was featured in the HBO TV series and film, ''[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]''.

He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nMasvidal co-founded Cynic with drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in the late 80\u2019s, having released four demos from 1988-1991 that circulated in the underground tape trading community. Masvidal developed a reputation in the South Florida music scene for his musicianship and attention began to grow quickly around the band. In 1989, while still in high school, Masvidal toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]], but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular act, but Masvidal persevered with Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990. In 1991, Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert were recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''. In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine placed the album as the 70th greatest metal album of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-100-greatest-metal-albums-of-all-time-113614/|title=The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time|last=Christe|first=Christopher R.

Roadrunner released a reissue of Focus in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. Cynic took a 12 year hiatus in 1995 after recording \"''The Portal Tapes\"'' demos. Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]], where he also began work as a session musician and composer for network TV and film. [[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[\u00c6on Spoke]]]]\n\n\n\n\nDuring Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[\u00c6on Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\".

OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, OwL unveiled a video for the song \"Kali In My Arms\", which was featured in the HBO TV series and film, ''[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]''.

It was intended to be a romantic allegorical account of Maximilian's own participation in a series of [[Tournament (medieval)|jousting tournaments]] in the guise of the tale's eponymous hero, Freydal. In the story, Freydal takes part in the tournaments to prove that he is worthy to marry a princess, who is a fictionalised representation of Maximilian's late wife, [[Mary of Burgundy]].\n\nThe text was never completed, although a manuscript draft is held by the [[Austrian National Library]]. 256 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature paintings]] to accompany the text were created by court painters, and 255 are preserved in an [[illuminated manuscript]] \u2018tournament book\u2019 held by the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. These miniatures vividly record the different types of jousts that were popular at the time as well as the [[Masquerade ball|court masquerades]], or \u2018mummeries\u2019, that took place at the end of the day after each tournament. It is the most extensive visual record of late medieval tournaments and court masquerades that exists.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Portrait of Maximilian I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], 1519.]]\n[[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and his father [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] were part of what was to become a long line of [[Holy Roman Emperors]] from the [[House of Habsburg]].

He attended his first tournament at the age of 14 and was captivated by its traditions and spectacle.<ref name=Freeman/> He staged many tournaments, including those to celebrate his wedding to Mary of Burgundy in 1477, his coronation as King of the Romans in 1486 and on the occasion of the [[First Congress of Vienna]] in 1515.<ref name=Freeman/> Maximilian was himself a participant in tournaments from 1485 until 1511, when he was in his 50s.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}</ref> His affinity for jousting contributed to his [[soubriquet]] the \u201clast knight\u201d.<ref name=Freeman/>\n[[File:Freydal fol164.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Post-tournament festivities: grotesque-style dancers or mummers dance a [[moresca]] while Freydal, in a mask and holding torches, looks on (''Freydal'' ms. fol.164, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=Locke123/>]]\n\n==Creation and history==\nMaximilian appears to have begun planning ''Freydal'' in 1502.<ref name=moma123>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=123}}</ref> The name ''Freydal'' was derived from ''Freyd-alb'', meaning \"white joyful young man\"<ref>{{harvnb|Strobl|1913|p=4}}</ref> In that year, he instructed his court taylor, Martin Trummer \"to have drawn in a book all those costumes as yet seen in mummeries organised by his majesty\".<ref name=moma123/> A \u201cmummery\u201d was a late medieval courtly [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] or costumed dance.<ref name=moma122>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=122}}</ref>\n\nThis developed into the commissioning of planning sketches for the entire work, created over the next ten years.<ref name=moma123/> They were drawn in pen on [[laid paper]], using brown and black ink with watercolour over black chalk and leadpoint.<ref name=moma123/> A collection of 203 of these are housed in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|pp=120, 123}}</ref> A small number of additional drawings are held at the [[British Museum]] and the [[Vatican Library]].<ref name=moma123/>\n\nMaximilian took a leading part in the creation of the work.<ref name=Clephan87>{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=87}}</ref> His instructions on the subjects to be illustrated as well as corrections, in his own hand, of some of the proofs have survived.

This results in a spectacular splintering of the lances. In the ''Scharfrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields) the shield is shown loosely fixed to the rider's breastplate, the aim being to dislodge it. In contrast, the objective of the ''Antzogenrennen'' is to unseat the opponent and his shield is fixed to his armour.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Feldrennen'' (or ''Kampfrennen'') jousts replicate skirmishes in war and the riders wear battlefield armour. The rarest type of joust depicted is the ''Kr\u00f6nlrennen'' where one rider wears the armour of a joust of peace but wields the lance of a joust of war and the other rider  has the opposite combination.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nOne of the most spectacular jousts depicted is the ''Bundrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields without [[bevors]])<ref name=moma121/> and its variation, ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' (joust of war with flying and exploding shields).<ref name=moma125>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=125}}</ref> In the ''Bundrennen'', the shield is held in place on the rider's breastplate with a complicated spring mechanism and when it is struck in the right place by the opponent it is ejected high into the air.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' increases the spectacle by attaching multiple triangular platelets to the shield which, when the shield is ejected, come loose and explode into the air like a firework display.<ref name=moma125/> Maximilian claimed to have invented this type of joust.<ref name=Freeman/> \n[[File:Freydal 05.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Foot combat between Freydal and Claude de Vaudry (''Freydal'' ms. fol. 39, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=moma120/>]]\nIn each of the tournaments, the participants are shown engaging in a foot combat.

It was intended to be a romantic allegorical account of Maximilian's own participation in a series of [[Tournament (medieval)|jousting tournaments]] in the guise of the tale's eponymous hero, Freydal. In the story, Freydal takes part in the tournaments to prove that he is worthy to marry a princess, who is a fictionalised representation of Maximilian's late wife, [[Mary of Burgundy]].\n\nThe text was never completed, although a manuscript draft is held by the [[Austrian National Library]]. 256 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature paintings]] to accompany the text were created by court painters, and 255 are preserved in an [[illuminated manuscript]] \u2018tournament book\u2019 held by the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. These miniatures vividly record the different types of jousts that were popular at the time as well as the [[Masquerade ball|court masquerades]], or \u2018mummeries\u2019, that took place at the end of the day after each tournament. It is the most extensive visual record of late medieval tournaments and court masquerades that exists.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Portrait of Maximilian I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], 1519.]]\n[[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and his father [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] were part of what was to become a long line of [[Holy Roman Emperors]] from the [[House of Habsburg]]. Maximilian was elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1486; upon his father's death in 1493 he succeeded to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=303}}</ref>\n\nDuring his reign, Maximilian commissioned a number of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars and artists to assist him in completing a series of projects, in different art forms, intended to immortalize his life and deeds and those of his Habsburg ancestors.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\">{{harvnb| Watanabe-O'Kelly|2000|p=94}}</ref> He referred to these projects as ''Gedechtnus'' (\"memorial\"),<ref name=\"Kleinschmidt162\">{{harvnb|Kleinschmidt|2008|p=162}}</ref> and included a series of stylised autobiographical works: ''Freydal'', the prose romance ''[[Weisskunig]]'', and the poem ''[[Theuerdank]]''.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\"/>\n\n''Freydal'' and ''Theuerdank'' are closely linked and together give an allegorical account of the events leading to Maximilian's marriage to [[Mary of Burgundy]] in 1477.<ref name=moma120>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=120}}</ref> Mary died five years later, in 1482.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=300}}</ref> In ''Freydal'', which is partly a tribute to Mary,<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\">{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88}}</ref> the eponymous hero pursues his fair lady by [[jousting]] in [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]].<ref name=Freeman>{{harvnb|Freeman|2019}}</ref> ''Theuerdank'' is effectively a sequel in which the hero overcomes dangers on the journey to his wedding.<ref name=moma120/> ''Freydal'' has a comedic tone which contrasts with ''Theuerdank'', which has more of the character of a tragedy.<ref name=McLaren/>\n\nThe theme of ''Freydal'' reflects Maximilian's lifelong enthusiasm for jousting. He attended his first tournament at the age of 14 and was captivated by its traditions and spectacle.<ref name=Freeman/> He staged many tournaments, including those to celebrate his wedding to Mary of Burgundy in 1477, his coronation as King of the Romans in 1486 and on the occasion of the [[First Congress of Vienna]] in 1515.<ref name=Freeman/> Maximilian was himself a participant in tournaments from 1485 until 1511, when he was in his 50s.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}</ref> His affinity for jousting contributed to his [[soubriquet]] the \u201clast knight\u201d.<ref name=Freeman/>\n[[File:Freydal fol164.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Post-tournament festivities: grotesque-style dancers or mummers dance a [[moresca]] while Freydal, in a mask and holding torches, looks on (''Freydal'' ms. fol.164, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=Locke123/>]]\n\n==Creation and history==\nMaximilian appears to have begun planning in 1502.<ref name=moma123>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=123}}</ref> The name ''Freydal'' was derived from ''Freyd-alb'', meaning \"white joyful young man\"<ref>{{harvnb|Strobl|1913|p=4}}</ref> In that year, he instructed his court taylor, Martin Trummer \"to have drawn in a book all those costumes as yet seen in mummeries organised by his majesty\".<ref name=moma123/> A \u201cmummery\u201d was a late medieval courtly [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] or costumed dance.<ref name=moma122>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=122}}</ref>\n\nThis developed into the commissioning of planning sketches for the entire work, created over the next ten years.<ref name=moma123/> They were drawn in pen on [[laid paper]], using brown and black ink with watercolour over black chalk and leadpoint.<ref name=moma123/> A collection of 203 of these are housed in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|pp=120, 123}}</ref> A small number of additional drawings are held at the [[British Museum]] and the [[Vatican Library]].<ref name=moma123/>\n\nMaximilian took a leading part in the creation of the work.<ref name=Clephan87>{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=87}}</ref> His instructions on the subjects to be illustrated as well as corrections, in his own hand, of some of the proofs have survived.

The narrative ends with Freydal setting out to search for her, and ''Theuerdank'' then takes up the subsequent story.<ref name=moma121/>\n\nThe work reflects Maximilian's vanity, as exemplified by a poem which forms part of the draft text:<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\"/>{{Quotation|This did the gallant Freydal<br>In knightly deeds of fame<br>Thus rendering illustrious<br>The glories of his name.<br>His virtues and his goodness<br>Are manifest to all;<br>His many glorious triumphs<br>At tilt, at masks and ball...<br>His like will ne\u2019er be seen again.<ref>translation {{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88, note 1}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, the tournaments described are based on encounters Maximilian actually had. This is evidenced by a list of people involved in the story in the first seven [[Paper quire|quire]]s of the draft text, and who are known to have been actual courtiers.<ref name=Silver64/>\n\n===Illuminated manuscript tournament book===\n[[File:Freydal 02.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|left|Freydal in a \u201cjoust of war with flying and exploding shields\u201d (''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'') with Sigmund von Welsperg (''Freydal'' ms. fol. 29, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|pp=175\u2013176}}</ref>]]\nThe miniatures in the tournament book manuscript illustrate the types of [[jousting]] popular at the time, both on horse and on foot.<ref name=McLaren/> Freydal features in each illustrated combat and his opponent is an historical figure with whom Maximilian actually jousted.<ref name=McLaren/> Each picture, in the lower margin, identifies the name of the opponent and the other courtiers depicted.<ref name=Locke123>{{harvnb|Locke|2015|p=123}}</ref>\n\nTwo types of joust, ''Rennen'' (or \u201cjousts of war\u201d where the lance has a sharpened tip<ref name= joust>{{harvnb|Jeep|2001|p=759}}; {{harvnb|Silver|2002|p=63}}</ref>) and ''Stechen'' (or \u201cjousts of peace\u201d where the lance has a blunted tip<ref name= joust/>) are depicted for each tournament.<ref name=Clephan87/><ref name=moma121/> Within these two broad groupings, eleven sub-types are shown.<ref name=moma121/> In the ''Welsches Gestecht'' (Italian joust of peace) a board separates the jousters so that they can ride more closely to each other and strike their opponent frontally with greater force. This results in a spectacular splintering of the lances. In the ''Scharfrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields) the shield is shown loosely fixed to the rider's breastplate, the aim being to dislodge it. In contrast, the objective of the ''Antzogenrennen'' is to unseat the opponent and his shield is fixed to his armour.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Feldrennen'' (or ''Kampfrennen'') jousts replicate skirmishes in war and the riders wear battlefield armour. The rarest type of joust depicted is the ''Kr\u00f6nlrennen'' where one rider wears the armour of a joust of peace but wields the lance of a joust of war and the other rider  has the opposite combination.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nOne of the most spectacular jousts depicted is the ''Bundrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields without [[bevors]])<ref name=moma121/> and its variation, ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' (joust of war with flying and exploding shields).<ref name=moma125>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=125}}</ref> In the ''Bundrennen'', the shield is held in place on the rider's breastplate with a complicated spring mechanism and when it is struck in the right place by the opponent it is ejected high into the air.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' increases the spectacle by attaching multiple triangular platelets to the shield which, when the shield is ejected, come loose and explode into the air like a firework display.<ref name=moma125/> Maximilian claimed to have invented this type of joust.<ref name=Freeman/> \n[[File:Freydal 05.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Foot combat between Freydal and Claude de Vaudry (''Freydal'' ms. fol. 39, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=moma120/>]]\nIn each of the tournaments, the participants are shown engaging in a foot combat. A variety of weapons are used, including [[Mace (bludgeon)|iron clubs]] (''Eisenkolben''), [[Flail (weapon)|flails]] (''Drischel''), swords (''Turnierschwert'')<ref name=krause179>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|p=179}}</ref> and daggers.<ref name=krause181>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|p=181}}</ref> The ''[[Melee (tournament)|m\u00eal\u00e9e]]'' is also shown in the manuscript.<ref name=Clephan87/>\n\nAfter each of the sixty-four tournaments is a scene depicting a [[moresca]] (a pantomime dance) or other post-tournament festivities with male courtiers, including the knights who had competed in the tournament, dressing up to dance in a variety of exotic costumes.<ref name=Locke121/> Known as \u2018mummeries\u2019, these were a regular feature of the evening entertainment after tournaments.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nThe male courtiers in the mummeries in the manuscript dress up, amongst other things, in costumes based on nationality or ethnicity, for example [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] or [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] costume, or as animals such as [[apes]] and creatures with bird's heads.<ref name=Locke121/> In one masquerade illustrated, the male participants engage in [[cross-dressing]] and wear women's gowns.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nIn each scene, all the men are dressed in the same costume and normally wear a mask.

Not only is it the largest surviving tournament book, it is also an unparalleled pictorial source of jousting from the late medieval period.<ref>{{harv|Terjanian|2019|pp=120-121}}</ref> It is the only one to depict spectacular falls.<ref name=Freeman/> In addition to illustrating the jousts themselves, it represents a remarkable catalogue of the weaponry used during tournaments<ref name=Freeman/> and is the most extensive record of mummery, the early court masquerade, that exists.<ref name=moma122/> The manuscript has been recognised in [[UNESCO]]\u2019s [[Memory of the World]] programme.<ref>{{harv|Taschen Catalogue}}</ref>\n\nHowever, ''Freydal'' was intended to be not only an artistic work but also political propaganda.<ref>{{harv|Barber|1974|p=298}}</ref> As part of what he called his \u2018memorial projects\u2019 or ''Gedechtnus'', Maximilian I used literary and visual works such as ''Freydal'' to model and enhance his public image. His aim was to make up for his actual powerlessness and lack of centralised control over his own realms by presenting himself and his exploits as superior to any others.<ref name=muller>{{harv| M\u00fcller|2003|pp=307-308}}</ref> As the historian [[Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller]] ([[:de:Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller |de]]) has said, the extent to which Maximilian employed this strategy meant that his court

He made the most of the opportunity and won at the [[1977 Austrian Grand Prix|\u00d6sterreichring]] for his maiden victory, finishing seventh in the championship, with 22 points.\n\n===1978\u20131981: Williams===\nBy late 1977, he had caught the attention of [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]], who was looking to rebuild his Formula One racing team.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> [[Frank Williams Racing Cars|Williams Grand Prix]] had struggled for success in its first years and after Williams had restarted his team in 1977, Jones was entrusted to give them their first taste of it. As well as Williams, he also signed with Haas-Hall for 1978, and competed in a [[Lola Cars|Lola]] 333CS in the [[Can-Am]] series, winning the title. Jones took nine poles in ten races but missed the [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca|Laguna Seca]] race due to a Formula One scheduling conflict. Stand-in [[Brian Redman]] finished twelfth in that race after the kill wire was crimped under a valve cover, resulting in intermittent ignition. Of the nine races in which he competed, Jones won five (Atlanta, Mosport, Road America, Mid-Ohio, and Riverside.) He finished second to [[Elliot Forbes-Robinson]] at Charlotte after hitting a chicane and losing a spark plug wire, retired through accident at [[Circuit Mont-Tremblant|St Jovite]] and lost a radiator at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]]. He finished third at [[Circuit Trois-Rivi\u00e8res|Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]] after losing a shift fork and being stuck with only second and fifth gears on the tight road circuit. At that race, water-injected brakes were first used in Can-Am, developed by the Haas team and copied with varying degrees of success by others. Jones ran one Can-Am race in 1979 (Mid-Ohio), where he and [[Keke Rosberg]] finished 1\u20132, with Jones winning his last Can-Am start. For Williams, his best result that season was a second-place finish at [[1978 United States Grand Prix|Watkins Glen]]. Jones helped put the team on the Formula One map in 1979 using the [[Williams FW07]], after winning four races in the span of five events near the end of the season. Jones finished third in the championship that year, and it was the springboard to an excellent 1980 campaign. Jones's best years in Formula One had just begun, in the middle of the ground-effect era.\n\nJones won seven races in 1980, although the [[1980 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]] was later removed from the championship and the [[1980 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]] was a non-championship race, so only five counted towards the Championship. Throughout the season he had a car which consistently made the podium, and he achieved ten during the year. At the end of the season he had beaten [[Nelson Piquet]] by 13 points in the standings, becoming Australia's first World Champion since [[Jack Brabham|Sir Jack Brabham]]. He had a good chance to repeat his success in 1981, but a very combative relationship with [[Carlos Reutemann]] led to an intense rivalry that possibly cost both drivers a chance at the championship. He finished four points behind Piquet for the championship and three behind Reutemann.\n\nAfter winning the championship in 1980, Jones and Williams competed in the then non-championship [[Australian Grand Prix]] at Calder Park in November. Driving his FW07B against a field consisting mostly of [[Formula 5000]]'s (and [[Bruno Giacomelli]]'s [[Alfa Romeo 179]]), Jones, who had previously finished 4th in the race in [[1977 Australian Grand Prix|1977]] (he was penalised 60 seconds for a jumped start, and officially finished just 20 seconds behind winner [[Warwick Brown]] showing that if not for the penalty he would have won by 40 seconds), joined his father Stan as a winner of the Australian Grand Prix.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1981, Jones was awarded the No.1 driver of the season by the editor of the AUTOCOURSE annual. During his championship year in 1980, the AUTOCOURSE editor awarded Jones the No.1 slot not just because he was World Champion but because in the editor's opinion \"Jones extracted every ounce of potential from the Williams FW07 -and more importantly, he did it consistently. All season Jones never gave anything less than his best.\" In 1981 despite missing the championship, the AUTOCOURSE editor still gave the No.1 driver award to Jones because \"in 1981 Alan Jones was outstanding, his racing instincts sharper than ever, his driving aggressive and confident.\"\n\n===Later Formula One career: 1982\u20131986===\n[[File:1985 European GP Alan Jones 03.jpg|thumb|Jones during practice for the [[1985 European Grand Prix]]]]\nJones announced his retirement after the 1981 season, which he managed to cap with a win in [[1981 Caesars Palace Grand Prix|Las Vegas]], but came out of retirement for a one-time drive with [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] in {{f1|1983}} at the [[1983 United States Grand Prix West|United States Grand Prix West]] at [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] where he qualified 12th but retired after 58 laps through driver [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]. A week later he again drove for Arrows in the non-championship [[1983 Race of Champions|Race of Champions]] at [[Brands Hatch]] where he qualified and finished third behind reigning World Champion [[Keke Rosberg]] (Williams) and rookie American driver [[Danny Sullivan]] ([[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]]). This was to be his last drive for the team, a bid to raise enough money to drive in the [[1983 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]] the week after the Race of Champions failed which saw Arrows use its regular drivers [[Marc Surer]] and [[Chico Serra]] (whom Jones had replaced at Long Beach) instead.\n\nDuring a 2012 Grand Prix Legends interview, Jones revealed that he had been contacted by [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] to drive for the team from mid-1982 after the death of [[Gilles Villeneuve]] and the injury forced retirement of [[Didier Pironi]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=In the hot seat|magazine=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]] magazine|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-2004/12/hot-seat|date=April 2004|page=12|accessdate=13 April 2015}}</ref> As he was enjoying life back in Australia at the time, Jones did not give them an answer straight away and basically gave them the run around, a move he regrets as it was possible that, as the 1980 World Champion, Ferrari would have wanted to keep him for 1983 when he was looking to make a comeback, which would have seen him drive the car which won the Constructors' Championship in 1983. After taking too long to give them an answer, the Scuderia instead offered the drive to {{f1|1978}} World Champion [[Mario Andretti]] who drove the last two races of the [[1982 Formula One season|1982 season]] at Monza and Caesars Palace.\n\nJones did not compete in Formula One during {{f1|1984}}, though he did drive some [[World Sportscar Championship]] races in [[1983 World Sportscar Championship season|1983]] and [[1984 World Sportscar Championship season|1984]]. He made a full-time comeback to F1 late in {{f1|1985}} when [[Haas Lola|Team Haas]] was created and Jones became the first driver for the team. The American owned and sponsored team was based in England and made its debut at the [[1985 Italian Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]]. Jones qualified the new [[Lola THL1]] 9.851 seconds slower than pole man [[Ayrton Senna]] in his [[Lotus 97T|Lotus]]-[[Renault F1|Renault]] and retired after only 6 laps with a blown engine. Jones was joined at Haas in {{f1|1986}} by former [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] works driver [[Patrick Tambay]]. The comeback was unsuccessful more due to the [[Cosworth#Other Formula One engines|Ford]] [[V6 engine]]'s lack of power compared to its rivals from [[Honda F1|Honda]], [[Techniques d'Avant Garde|TAG]]-[[Porsche in Formula One|Porsche]], [[BMW in Formula One|BMW]], [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and Renault, than any lack of effort from the team and its drivers.\n\nAt the end of the 1986 season after the Haas team lost its sponsorship and ran out of money, Jones retired from Formula One for good having won 12 races, 6 pole positions and one World Championship.\n\n==Post Formula One career==\n\n===Sports and Touring Car racing===\n[[File:Alan Jones (racecar driver).jpg|thumb|right|Jones in 2007]]\nJones' post Formula One career was initially spasmodic in nature. Briefly in demand for his services as a Touring Car co-driver, he raced occasionally in his home country's biggest endurance race, the [[Bathurst 1000]] but success was elusive. In 1982 he attempted his first full season of racing, driving a [[Porsche 935]] to dominate the [[1982 Australian GT Championship]]. This championship included races against local [[Touring Car racing|touring car]] ace [[Peter Brock]] driving [[Bob Jane]]'s 6.0 litre [[Chevrolet Monza]]. The duels between Australia's two biggest motorsport names at the time have often been regarded as some of the best racing seen domestically in Australia. Soon after he made his first failed comeback to Formula One. During 1982 he formed his own touring Car team, combining the resources of V8 [[Ford XE Falcon|Ford Falcon]] driver [[Bob Morris (motor racing)|Bob Morris]] and rotary [[Mazda RX-7]] racer Barry Jones into a single two-car team but results were mixed and the exercise dissipated by the end of the season, though Jones and Jones did win the CRC 300 at [[Amaroo Park]] in a [[Mazda RX-7]] (Alan Jones was to drive with Bob Morris in the Falcon in the Oran Park 250 endurance race, but elected after the race started to let Morris drive the 100 lap race solo. Morris went on to win the race). 1984 brought a top six finish at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] with [[Kremer Racing]], and a top four finish at the [[1984 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]], again teaming with Warren Cullen in a [[Holden VK Commodore]]. Cullen and Jones, who drove the final stint in the race and required pain killing injections after having the steering wheel wrench out of his hands during practice which damaged ligaments in his elbow, were unlucky not to finish 2nd, but a brake problem with the car saw him forced to use more fuel than normal and a late race stop for fuel allowed the [[Holden Dealer Team]] VK Commodore of [[David \"Skippy\" Parsons|David Parsons]] and [[John Harvey (racing driver)|John Harvey]] to sneak into 2nd and the Mazda RX-7 of [[Allan Moffat]] and [[Gregg Hansford]] to claim 3rd.\n\nJones was quickly snapped up as teammate to [[Colin Bond]] in Bond's newly formed [[Alfa Romeo|factory supported]] [[Colin Bond Racing|Network Alfa]] touring car team for the [[1985 Australian Touring Car Championship]] driving an underpowered [[Alfa Romeo Alfetta|Alfa Romeo GTV6]] in Australia's first full year using the international [[Group A]] touring car rules. After some giant killing performances in the early rounds of the championship, Jones abandoned his first serious [[Australian Touring Car Championship|ATCC]] campaign to make his second Formula One comeback with the Haas Lola team.\n\nJones joined Kremer Racing for the [[1984 24 Hours of Le Mans]] where he would share a [[Porsche 956]]B with [[1983 24 Hours of Le Mans|1983 Le Mans]] winner (and fellow Aussie) [[Vern Schuppan]] along with former F1 driver [[Jean-Pierre Jarier]]. After dicing for the lead with the pole sitting [[Lancia LC2]] of [[Bob Wollek]] and [[Alessandro Nannini]] for the first third of the race, damage caused when Schuppan was the innocent victim of a spinning [[Roger Dorchy]], and finally a broken conrod, saw Jones finish his first [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] start in 6th place. Jones had previously driven for the Kremer brothers when he and Schuppan drove a 956 to 5th place in the [[1000 km Silverstone|1983 1000 km of Silversone]]. Later in 1984, Jones drove with Schuppan for the factory backed [[Rothmans]] [[Porsche in motorsport|Porsche]] team at the [[1984 1000 km of Sandown Park|1000 km of Sandown Park]], the final round of the [[1984 World Sportscar Championship season|1984 World Sportscar Championship]] and the first ever [[FIA]] World Championship race to be held in Australia. After Schuppan qualified the Porsche 956B 3rd behind teammates [[Stefan Bellof]] and [[Jochen Mass]], Jones started the race and got the jump on the West German pair and had the honour of leading the first lap of the first [[FIA]] World Championship race ever held in Australia. Jones and Schuppan eventually finished 9th, 12 laps down on Bellof and [[Derek Bell (racing driver)|Derek Bell]] after numerous punctures.\n\nOn 20 September 1987 at [[Sportsland SUGO|SUGO]] Jones won a round of [[Japanese Touring Car Championship|All Japan Touring Car Championship]] driving [[TOM'S|Toyota Team Tom's]], [[Toyota Supra in motorsport|Group A, Toyota Supra MA70 Turbo]]. Unfortunately the factory backed Supra could not compete, even with the Private Ford Sierras, thus for the remaining two JGTC races he scored only one additional podium on 6 December at Suzuka where he finished 3rd. After returning home again in 1987 his career did not pick up again until a competitive 3rd placing at the [[1988 Bathurst 1000]] with Colin Bond's team in a [[Ford Sierra RS500]], saw him signed up as full-time number two driver to [[Tony Longhurst]] in Longhurst's [[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]] run [[LoGaMo Racing|team]] to drive a Sierra in [[1990 Australian Touring Car season|1990]]. The [[Benson & Hedges]] sponsored Sierra's were brutally fast but disappointingly fragile and results were again elusive. The team switched to [[E30 M3|BMW M3 Evolution]]'s in [[1991 Australian Touring Car season|1991]] saw the return of reliability at the cost of speed. Jones took the occasional podium result while Longhurst took two wins against the all-powerful [[Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R]]'s. A switch to [[Glenn Seton Racing]] mid-season in 1992 brought improved results and race wins and he finished runner up to his team leader [[Glenn Seton]] as their V8 [[Ford EB Falcon|Ford Falcons]] dominated the [[1993 Australian Touring Car Championship]]. Jones' reputation as a hard charger was shown in the 1993 ATCC when he was involved in a number of incidents, most notably pushing the [[Holden VP Commodore|Holden Commodore]] of [[Mark Skaife]] off the track at [[Symmons Plains Raceway]] before also doing the same to the [[Holden Racing Team]]'s Commodore driven by Australia's [[1987 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1987 500cc Grand Prix motorcycle]] World Champion [[Wayne Gardner]] less than half a lap later. Rule changes to make the Commodore's more competitive saw the team's dominance fade over the next few years. The [[1995 Bathurst 1000]] looked to be a high point with a memorable 1\u20132 finish for their two cars fading into just a second for the car Jones shared with veteran [[Allan Grice]], the pair finishing behind the [[Holden VR Commodore|Holden Commodore]] of ex-F1 driver [[Larry Perkins]] and [[Russell Ingall]] (Seton, leading by 5 seconds with just 9 laps remaining, retired with a dead engine).\n\nBy this point the team was sundering apart and Jones took the major sponsor ([[Phillip Morris International]]) to form a new team with engineering brothers Ross and Jim Stone as partners, known commercially as [[Alan Jones Racing|Pack Leader Racing]] (the Pack Leader name came about as the use of the Peter Jackson cigarette brand was banned following the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]]'s blanket ban on all cigarette advertising from 1 January 1996). Initially fast, the partnership was fading by 1997 and the Stones bought Jones out, re-badging the team as [[Stone Brothers Racing]]. Jones returned to race with Tony Longhurst's [[Longhurst Racing]] team again in 1998 by this time his form was fading. From 1999 onwards he no longer raced full-time, driving just the endurance races as a hired gun. His final race was with [[Dick Johnson Racing]], driving into a 7th-placed finish at the [[2002 Bathurst 1000]].\n\n===CART===\nIn August 1985, one month before his return to Formula One at the Italian Grand Prix, Jones' association with Team Haas owner Carl Haas saw him used as a substitute for injured [[Newman/Haas Racing]] driver (and {{f1|1978}} World F1 Champion) [[Mario Andretti]] in a [[1985 IndyCar season|Champ Car World Series]] race at [[Road America]] in [[Wisconsin]]. In his only IndyCar start and showing he had lost none of the speed, skill and determination that took him to the World Championship, Jones drove Andretti's [[Lola Cars|Lola T900]]-[[Cosworth]] to third place behind [[Jacques Villeneuve (elder)|Jacques Villeneuve Sr.]] (winner) and Mario's son [[Michael Andretti]] (2nd).\n\n===A1 Grand Prix===\nJones then become involved in the [[A1 Team Australia|Australian franchise]] of the [[A1 Grand Prix]] as Team Director in 2005 until the series demise in 2010.\n\n===Grand Prix Masters===\nHe attempted to race in the [[Grand Prix Masters]] World Series at Kyalami in November 2005 but had to pull out before qualifying due to neck pains.\n\n===Media===\nAfter retiring from F1 for good after 1986, Jones became a commentator with [[Nine Network|Channel Nine]] as part of their Formula One coverage in Australia in {{f1|1987}}, a role which lasted until 2002 with change of network rights for Formula 1. This association with Nine saw him hosting F1 telecasts from Nine's Sydney studios working mostly with [[Darrell Eastlake]], but sometimes with former [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|Grand Prix motorcycle]] World Champion [[Barry Sheene]] on 500cc Grand Prix telecasts. Jones also worked as a pit reporter during the [[Australian Grand Prix]] where his relationships with those in F1 made it easier for him to obtain relevant information, and also as a pit reporter for Nine's broadcasts of the [[Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix]].\n\nIn March 2013, Jones signed with [[Network Ten]] as a commentator for their Formula One coverage where he joins regular hosts [[Matthew White (journalist)|Matthew White]] and former [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|MotoGP]] rider [[Daryl Beattie]].\n\n===Author===\nHis autobiography ''AJ: How Alan Jones Climbed to the top of Formula One'' has been co-authored with motorsport writer Andrew Clarke was released in August 2017 by [[Penguin Random House]].\n\n==Personal life==\nJones separated from his wife Beverley in the late 1980s. In 1996 he began a relationship with Amanda Butler Davis and in 2001 their twins, Zara and Jack, were born.\n\nJones also has a daughter, Camilla, born in 1990.\n\nJones' adopted son [[Christian Jones|Christian]] now races in various forms of motorsport.\n\nHis eldest daughter, Emma, has two daughters (born 2001 and 2004).\n\n==Honours==\nJones was made a Member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in 1980 for \"service to motor racing\" and was inducted into the [[Sport Australia Hall of Fame]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1088003&search_type=quick&showInd=true|title=Jones, Alan Stanley, MBE|publisher=It's an Honour|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahof.org.au/hall-of-fame/member-profile/?memberID=112&memberType=athlete|title=Alan Jones MBE|publisher=Sport Australia Hall of Fame|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nJones and his father Stan, along with [[Graham Hill|Graham]] and [[Damon Hill]], and [[Keke Rosberg|Keke]] and [[Nico Rosberg]], are the only father/son combinations to ever win the Australian Grand Prix.\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Career summary===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

He was the first driver to win a [[Formula One]] World Championship with the [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] team, becoming the [[1980 Formula One season|1980 World Drivers' Champion]] and the second Australian to do so following triple World Champion [[Sir Jack Brabham]]. He competed in a total of 117 Grands Prix, winning 12 and achieving 24 podium finishes. In 1978 Jones won the [[Can-Am]] championship driving a [[Lola Cars|Lola]].\n\nJones is also the last Australian driver to win the [[Australian Grand Prix]], winning the [[1980 Australian Grand Prix|1980 event]] at [[Calder Park Raceway]], having lapped the field consisting mostly of [[Formula 5000]] cars while he was driving his Formula One Championship winning [[Williams FW07|Williams FW07B]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nJones attended [[Xavier College (Melbourne)|Xavier College]] and is the son of [[Stan Jones (racing driver)|Stan Jones]], an Australian racing driver and winner of the [[1959 Australian Grand Prix]], and wanted to follow in his footsteps. Jones initially worked in his father's [[Holden]] dealership while racing a [[Mini]] and a [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|last=Small|first =Steve|title=The Guinness Complete Grand Prix Who's Who|page=209|publisher =Guinness Publishing|ISBN=0851127029}}</ref> The younger Jones left for Europe in 1967, to make a name for himself, but found that he could not afford even a [[Formula Ford]] drive.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> He therefore returned home but was back in 1970 and set about building his career in company with compatriot [[Brian McGuire]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\nThe two men bought and sold second-hand cars and Jones was eventually able to afford a [[Formula Three]] [[Lotus 41]] which he intended to adapt to [[Formula Two]] specification and take back to Australia to sell, in order to finance a season of Formula Three.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite book|last1 =Jones|first1 =Alan|last2 =Botsford|first2 =Keith|title=Alan Jones: Driving Ambition|publisher =Stanley Paul & Co.|page =23|ISBN =0091462401}}</ref> However the machine was written off in a testing accident at [[Brands Hatch]] in which Jones suffered a broken leg.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn late 1970, Jones signed with a firm for whom McGuire was working, designed to promote drivers' interests and was selected to compete in a series of races in Brazil.<ref>{{cite book|last1 =Jones|first1 =Alan|last2 =Botsford|first2 =Keith|title=Alan Jones Driving Ambition|publisher =Stanley Paul & Co.|pages =25\u201326|ISBN =0091462401}}</ref> However, in his first two races the engine failed and in the third the gearbox broke, which meant the opportunity ended.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite book|last1 =Jones|first1 =Alan|last2 =Botsford|first2 =Keith|title=Alan Jones: Driving Ambition|publisher =Stanley Paul & Co.|page =28|ISBN =0091462401}}</ref>\n\nFor 1971, Jones campaigned a [[Brabham|Brabham BT 28]] converted to BT35 specification,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> in [[Formula Three]] and had a moderately successful season which led to a series of tests for [[March Engineering|March]] at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]. However, despite the success of the test, Jones was not offered a drive by March and for 1972, drove a [[Group Racing Developments|GRD]] in Formula Three.<ref>{{cite book|last1 =Jones|first1 =Alan|last2 =Botsford|first2 =Keith|title=Alan Jones: Driving Ambition|publisher =Stanley Paul & Co.|pages =34\u201336|ISBN =0091462401}}</ref> Jones did enough that season to be kept on by GRD for the next year with a new sponsor and only lost the 1973 championship due to a misfiring engine in the last round at [[Brands Hatch]].<ref>{{cite book|last1 =Jones|first1 =Alan|last2 =Botsford|first2 =Keith|title=Alan Jones: Driving Ambition|publisher =Stanley Paul & Co.|page =37|ISBN =0091462401}}</ref> In 1974, Jones began the season in Formula Atlantic but felt it was a very amateurish effort, but a chance meeting with [[Harry Stiller]] led to a drive in the latter's March 74.  At the end of the season, Jones made his F5000 debut for Stiller in the final round of the European Championship at Brands Hatch in a Chevron B24/28 owned by John MacDonald.  It was planned to enter [[Formula 5000]] for 1975.<ref>{{cite book|last1 =Jones|first1 =Alan|last2 =Botsford|first2 =Keith|title=Alan Jones: Driving Ambition|publisher =Stanley Paul & Co.|page =43|ISBN =0091462401}}</ref> However, Stiller's initial plans fell through but after some delay, during which Jones was effectively unemployed, Stiller arranged to purchase a [[Formula One]] [[Hesketh Racing|Hesketh 308]] and signed Jones to drive the car.<ref>{{cite book|last1 =Jones|first1 =Alan|last2 =Botsford|first2 =Keith|title=Alan Jones: Driving Ambition|publisher =Stanley Paul & Co.|page =45|ISBN =0091462401}}</ref>\n\n==Formula One==\n\n===1975\u20131977: Hesketh, Hill, Surtees and Shadow===\n[[File:Williams27800x532.jpg|thumb|200px|1980 championship winning car [[Williams FW07]]]]\nHis first race was the [[1975 Spanish Grand Prix]] at the fast [[Montjuic Park|Montju\u00efc]] circuit in the purchased Hesketh although the weekend turned out to be one of the most tragic in [[Formula One]] history \nwhen [[Rolf Stommelen]]'s crash caused the death of five spectators. After four races in Formula One the team ceased racing after Stiller moved abroad.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> However, Jones was named as a replacement for the injured Stommelen in [[Embassy Hill|Graham Hill]]'s team.

He made the most of the opportunity and won at the [[1977 Austrian Grand Prix|\u00d6sterreichring]] for his maiden victory, finishing seventh in the championship, with 22 points.\n\n===1978\u20131981: Williams===\nBy late 1977, he had caught the attention of [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]], who was looking to rebuild his Formula One racing team.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> [[Frank Williams Racing Cars|Williams Grand Prix]] had struggled for success in its first years and after Williams had restarted his team in 1977, Jones was entrusted to give them their first taste of it. As well as Williams, he also signed with Haas-Hall for 1978, and competed in a [[Lola Cars|Lola]] 333CS in the [[Can-Am]] series, winning the title. Jones took nine poles in ten races but missed the [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca|Laguna Seca]] race due to a Formula One scheduling conflict. Stand-in [[Brian Redman]] finished twelfth in that race after the kill wire was crimped under a valve cover, resulting in intermittent ignition. Of the nine races in which he competed, Jones won five (Atlanta, Mosport, Road America, Mid-Ohio, and Riverside.) He finished second to [[Elliot Forbes-Robinson]] at Charlotte after hitting a chicane and losing a spark plug wire, retired through accident at [[Circuit Mont-Tremblant|St Jovite]] and lost a radiator at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]]. He finished third at [[Circuit Trois-Rivi\u00e8res|Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]] after losing a shift fork and being stuck with only second and fifth gears on the tight road circuit. At that race, water-injected brakes were first used in Can-Am, developed by the Haas team and copied with varying degrees of success by others. Jones ran one Can-Am race in 1979 (Mid-Ohio), where he and [[Keke Rosberg]] finished 1\u20132, with Jones winning his last Can-Am start. For Williams, his best result that season was a second-place finish at [[1978 United States Grand Prix|Watkins Glen]]. Jones helped put the team on the Formula One map in 1979 using the [[Williams FW07]], after winning four races in the span of five events near the end of the season. Jones finished third in the championship that year, and it was the springboard to an excellent 1980 campaign. Jones's best years in Formula One had just begun, in the middle of the ground-effect era.\n\nJones won seven races in 1980, although the [[1980 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]] was later removed from the championship and the [[1980 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]] was a non-championship race, so only five counted towards the Championship. Throughout the season he had a car which consistently made the podium, and he achieved ten during the year. At the end of the season he had beaten [[Nelson Piquet]] by 13 points in the standings, becoming Australia's first World Champion since [[Jack Brabham|Sir Jack Brabham]]. He had a good chance to repeat his success in 1981, but a very combative relationship with [[Carlos Reutemann]] led to an intense rivalry that possibly cost both drivers a chance at the championship. He finished four points behind Piquet for the championship and three behind Reutemann.\n\nAfter winning the championship in 1980, Jones and Williams competed in the then non-championship [[Australian Grand Prix]] at Calder Park in November. Driving his FW07B against a field consisting mostly of [[Formula 5000]]'s (and [[Bruno Giacomelli]]'s [[Alfa Romeo 179]]), Jones, who had previously finished 4th in the race in [[1977 Australian Grand Prix|1977]] (he was penalised 60 seconds for a jumped start, and officially finished just 20 seconds behind winner [[Warwick Brown]] showing that if not for the penalty he would have won by 40 seconds), joined his father Stan as a winner of the Australian Grand Prix.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1981, Jones was awarded the No.1 driver of the season by the editor of the AUTOCOURSE annual. During his championship year in 1980, the AUTOCOURSE editor awarded Jones the No.1 slot not just because he was World Champion but because in the editor's opinion \"Jones extracted every ounce of potential from the Williams FW07 -and more importantly, he did it consistently. All season Jones never gave anything less than his best.\" In 1981 despite missing the championship, the AUTOCOURSE editor still gave the No.1 driver award to Jones because \"in 1981 Alan Jones was outstanding, his racing instincts sharper than ever, his driving aggressive and confident.\"\n\n===Later Formula One career: 1982\u20131986===\n[[File:1985 European GP Alan Jones 03.jpg|thumb|Jones during practice for the [[1985 European Grand Prix]]]]\nJones announced his retirement after the 1981 season, which he managed to cap with a win in [[1981 Caesars Palace Grand Prix|Las Vegas]], but came out of retirement for a one-time drive with [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] in {{f1|1983}} at the [[1983 United States Grand Prix West|United States Grand Prix West]] at [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] where he qualified 12th but retired after 58 laps through driver [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]. A week later he again drove for Arrows in the non-championship [[1983 Race of Champions|Race of Champions]] at [[Brands Hatch]] where he qualified and finished third behind reigning World Champion [[Keke Rosberg]] (Williams) and rookie American driver [[Danny Sullivan]] ([[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]]). This was to be his last drive for the team, a bid to raise enough money to drive in the [[1983 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]] the week after the Race of Champions failed which saw Arrows use its regular drivers [[Marc Surer]] and [[Chico Serra]] (whom Jones had replaced at Long Beach) instead.\n\nDuring a 2012 Grand Prix Legends interview, Jones revealed that he had been contacted by [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] to drive for the team from mid-1982 after the death of [[Gilles Villeneuve]] and the injury forced retirement of [[Didier Pironi]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=In the hot seat|magazine=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]] magazine|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-2004/12/hot-seat|date=April 2004|page=12|accessdate=13 April 2015}}</ref> As he was enjoying life back in Australia at the time, Jones did not give them an answer straight away and basically gave them the run around, a move he regrets as it was possible that, as the 1980 World Champion, Ferrari would have wanted to keep him for 1983 when he was looking to make a comeback, which would have seen him drive the car which won the Constructors' Championship in 1983. After taking too long to give them an answer, the Scuderia instead offered the drive to {{f1|1978}} World Champion [[Mario Andretti]] who drove the last two races of the [[1982 Formula One season|1982 season]] at Monza and Caesars Palace.\n\nJones did not compete in Formula One during {{f1|1984}}, though he did drive some [[World Sportscar Championship]] races in [[1983 World Sportscar Championship season|1983]] and [[1984 World Sportscar Championship season|1984]]. He made a full-time comeback to F1 late in {{f1|1985}} when [[Haas Lola|Team Haas]] was created and Jones became the first driver for the team. The American owned and sponsored team was based in England and made its debut at the [[1985 Italian Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]]. Jones qualified the new [[Lola THL1]] 9.851 seconds slower than pole man [[Ayrton Senna]] in his [[Lotus 97T|Lotus]]-[[Renault F1|Renault]] and retired after only 6 laps with a blown engine. Jones was joined at Haas in {{f1|1986}} by former [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] works driver [[Patrick Tambay]]. The comeback was unsuccessful more due to the [[Cosworth#Other Formula One engines|Ford]] [[V6 engine]]'s lack of power compared to its rivals from [[Honda F1|Honda]], [[Techniques d'Avant Garde|TAG]]-[[Porsche in Formula One|Porsche]], [[BMW in Formula One|BMW]], [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and Renault, than any lack of effort from the team and its drivers.\n\nAt the end of the 1986 season after the Haas team lost its sponsorship and ran out of money, Jones retired from Formula One for good having won 12 races, 6 pole positions and one World Championship.\n\n==Post Formula One career==\n\n===Sports and Touring Car racing===\n[[File:Alan Jones (racecar driver).jpg|thumb|right|Jones in 2007]]\nJones' post Formula One career was initially spasmodic in nature. Briefly in demand for his services as a Touring Car co-driver, he raced occasionally in his home country's biggest endurance race, the [[Bathurst 1000]] but success was elusive. In 1982 he attempted his first full season of racing, driving a [[Porsche 935]] to dominate the [[1982 Australian GT Championship]]. This championship included races against local [[Touring Car racing|touring car]] ace [[Peter Brock]] driving [[Bob Jane]]'s 6.0 litre [[Chevrolet Monza]]. The duels between Australia's two biggest motorsport names at the time have often been regarded as some of the best racing seen domestically in Australia. Soon after he made his first failed comeback to Formula One. During 1982 he formed his own touring Car team, combining the resources of V8 [[Ford XE Falcon|Ford Falcon]] driver [[Bob Morris (motor racing)|Bob Morris]] and rotary [[Mazda RX-7]] racer Barry Jones into a single two-car team but results were mixed and the exercise dissipated by the end of the season, though Jones and Jones did win the CRC 300 at [[Amaroo Park]] in a [[Mazda RX-7]] (Alan Jones was to drive with Bob Morris in the Falcon in the Oran Park 250 endurance race, but elected after the race started to let Morris drive the 100 lap race solo. Morris went on to win the race). 1984 brought a top six finish at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] with [[Kremer Racing]], and a top four finish at the [[1984 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]], again teaming with Warren Cullen in a [[Holden VK Commodore]]. Cullen and Jones, who drove the final stint in the race and required pain killing injections after having the steering wheel wrench out of his hands during practice which damaged ligaments in his elbow, were unlucky not to finish 2nd, but a brake problem with the car saw him forced to use more fuel than normal and a late race stop for fuel allowed the [[Holden Dealer Team]] VK Commodore of [[David \"Skippy\" Parsons|David Parsons]] and [[John Harvey (racing driver)|John Harvey]] to sneak into 2nd and the Mazda RX-7 of [[Allan Moffat]] and [[Gregg Hansford]] to claim 3rd.\n\nJones was quickly snapped up as teammate to [[Colin Bond]] in Bond's newly formed [[Alfa Romeo|factory supported]] [[Colin Bond Racing|Network Alfa]] touring car team for the [[1985 Australian Touring Car Championship]] driving an underpowered [[Alfa Romeo Alfetta|Alfa Romeo GTV6]] in Australia's first full year using the international [[Group A]] touring car rules. After some giant killing performances in the early rounds of the championship, Jones abandoned his first serious [[Australian Touring Car Championship|ATCC]] campaign to make his second Formula One comeback with the Haas Lola team.\n\nJones joined Kremer Racing for the [[1984 24 Hours of Le Mans]] where he would share a [[Porsche 956]]B with [[1983 24 Hours of Le Mans|1983 Le Mans]] winner (and fellow Aussie) [[Vern Schuppan]] along with former F1 driver [[Jean-Pierre Jarier]]. After dicing for the lead with the pole sitting [[Lancia LC2]] of [[Bob Wollek]] and [[Alessandro Nannini]] for the first third of the race, damage caused when Schuppan was the innocent victim of a spinning [[Roger Dorchy]], and finally a broken conrod, saw Jones finish his first [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] start in 6th place. Jones had previously driven for the Kremer brothers when he and Schuppan drove a 956 to 5th place in the [[1000 km Silverstone|1983 1000 km of Silversone]]. Later in 1984, Jones drove with Schuppan for the factory backed [[Rothmans]] [[Porsche in motorsport|Porsche]] team at the [[1984 1000 km of Sandown Park|1000 km of Sandown Park]], the final round of the [[1984 World Sportscar Championship season|1984 World Sportscar Championship]] and the first ever [[FIA]] World Championship race to be held in Australia. After Schuppan qualified the Porsche 956B 3rd behind teammates [[Stefan Bellof]] and [[Jochen Mass]], Jones started the race and got the jump on the West German pair and had the honour of leading the first lap of the first [[FIA]] World Championship race ever held in Australia. Jones and Schuppan eventually finished 9th, 12 laps down on Bellof and [[Derek Bell (racing driver)|Derek Bell]] after numerous punctures.\n\nOn 20 September 1987 at [[Sportsland SUGO|SUGO]] Jones won a round of [[Japanese Touring Car Championship|All Japan Touring Car Championship]] driving [[TOM'S|Toyota Team Tom's]], [[Toyota Supra in motorsport|Group A, Toyota Supra MA70 Turbo]]. Unfortunately the factory backed Supra could not compete, even with the Private Ford Sierras, thus for the remaining two JGTC races he scored only one additional podium on 6 December at Suzuka where he finished 3rd. After returning home again in 1987 his career did not pick up again until a competitive 3rd placing at the [[1988 Bathurst 1000]] with Colin Bond's team in a [[Ford Sierra RS500]], saw him signed up as full-time number two driver to [[Tony Longhurst]] in Longhurst's [[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]] run [[LoGaMo Racing|team]] to drive a Sierra in [[1990 Australian Touring Car season|1990]]. The [[Benson & Hedges]] sponsored Sierra's were brutally fast but disappointingly fragile and results were again elusive. The team switched to [[E30 M3|BMW M3 Evolution]]'s in [[1991 Australian Touring Car season|1991]] saw the return of reliability at the cost of speed. Jones took the occasional podium result while Longhurst took two wins against the all-powerful [[Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R]]'s. A switch to [[Glenn Seton Racing]] mid-season in 1992 brought improved results and race wins and he finished runner up to his team leader [[Glenn Seton]] as their V8 [[Ford EB Falcon|Ford Falcons]] dominated the [[1993 Australian Touring Car Championship]]. Jones' reputation as a hard charger was shown in the 1993 ATCC when he was involved in a number of incidents, most notably pushing the [[Holden VP Commodore|Holden Commodore]] of [[Mark Skaife]] off the track at [[Symmons Plains Raceway]] before also doing the same to the [[Holden Racing Team]]'s Commodore driven by Australia's [[1987 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1987 500cc Grand Prix motorcycle]] World Champion [[Wayne Gardner]] less than half a lap later. Rule changes to make the Commodore's more competitive saw the teams dominance fade over the next few years. The [[1995 Bathurst 1000]] looked to be a high point with a memorable 1\u20132 finish for their two cars fading into just a second for the car Jones shared with veteran [[Allan Grice]], the pair finishing behind the [[Holden VR Commodore|Holden Commodore]] of ex-F1 driver [[Larry Perkins]] and [[Russell Ingall]] (Seton, leading by 5 seconds with just 9 laps remaining, retired with a dead engine).\n\nBy this point the team was sundering apart and Jones took the major sponsor ([[Phillip Morris International]]) to form a new team with engineering brothers Ross and Jim Stone as partners, known commercially as [[Alan Jones Racing|Pack Leader Racing]] (the Pack Leader name came about as the use of the Peter Jackson cigarette brand was banned following the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]]'s blanket ban on all cigarette advertising from 1 January 1996). Initially fast, the partnership was fading by 1997 and the Stones bought Jones out, re-badging the team as [[Stone Brothers Racing]]. Jones returned to race with Tony Longhurst's [[Longhurst Racing]] team again in 1998 by this time his form was fading. From 1999 onwards he no longer raced full-time, driving just the endurance races as a hired gun. His final race was with [[Dick Johnson Racing]], driving into a 7th-placed finish at the [[2002 Bathurst 1000]].\n\n===CART===\nIn August 1985, one month before his return to Formula One at the Italian Grand Prix, Jones' association with Team Haas owner Carl Haas saw him used as a substitute for injured [[Newman/Haas Racing]] driver (and {{f1|1978}} World F1 Champion) [[Mario Andretti]] in a [[1985 IndyCar season|Champ Car World Series]] race at [[Road America]] in [[Wisconsin]]. In his only IndyCar start and showing he had lost none of the speed, skill and determination that took him to the World Championship, Jones drove Andretti's [[Lola Cars|Lola T900]]-[[Cosworth]] to third place behind [[Jacques Villeneuve (elder)|Jacques Villeneuve Sr.]] (winner) and Mario's son [[Michael Andretti]] (2nd).\n\n===A1 Grand Prix===\nJones then become involved in the [[A1 Team Australia|Australian franchise]] of the [[A1 Grand Prix]] as Team Director in 2005 until the series demise in 2010.\n\n===Grand Prix Masters===\nHe attempted to race in the [[Grand Prix Masters]] World Series at Kyalami in November 2005 but had to pull out before qualifying due to neck pains.\n\n===Media===\nAfter retiring from F1 for good after 1986, Jones became a commentator with [[Nine Network|Channel Nine]] as part of their Formula One coverage in Australia in {{f1|1987}}, a role which lasted until 2002 with change of network rights for Formula 1. This association with Nine saw him hosting F1 telecasts from Nine's Sydney studios working mostly with [[Darrell Eastlake]], but sometimes with former [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|Grand Prix motorcycle]] World Champion [[Barry Sheene]] on 500cc Grand Prix telecasts. Jones also worked as a pit reporter during the [[Australian Grand Prix]] where his relationships with those in F1 made it easier for him to obtain relevant information, and also as a pit reporter for Nine's broadcasts of the [[Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix]].\n\nIn March 2013, Jones signed with [[Network Ten]] as a commentator for their Formula One coverage where he joins regular hosts [[Matthew White (journalist)|Matthew White]] and former [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|MotoGP]] rider [[Daryl Beattie]].\n\n===Author===\nHis autobiography ''AJ: How Alan Jones Climbed to the top of Formula One'' has been co-authored with motorsport writer Andrew Clarke was released in August 2017 by [[Penguin Random House]].\n\n==Personal life==\nJones separated from his wife Beverley in the late 1980s. In 1996 he began a relationship with Amanda Butler Davis and in 2001 their twins, Zara and Jack, were born.\n\nJones also has a daughter, Camilla, born in 1990.\n\nJones' adopted son [[Christian Jones|Christian]] now races in various forms of motorsport.\n\nHis eldest daughter, Emma, has two daughters (born 2001 and 2004).\n\n==Honours==\nJones was made a Member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in 1980 for \"service to motor racing\" and was inducted into the [[Sport Australia Hall of Fame]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1088003&search_type=quick&showInd=true|title=Jones, Alan Stanley, MBE|publisher=It's an Honour|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahof.org.au/hall-of-fame/member-profile/?memberID=112&memberType=athlete|title=Alan Jones MBE|publisher=Sport Australia Hall of Fame|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nJones and his father Stan, along with [[Graham Hill|Graham]] and [[Damon Hill]], and [[Keke Rosberg|Keke]] and [[Nico Rosberg]], are the only father/son combinations to ever win the Australian Grand Prix.\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Career summary===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

Only a [[Noli me tangere]] painting attributed to Franz Carl Stauder remains. The Neo=Gothic [[altar]], [[pulpit]] and [[baptismal font]] were installed in 1874.

However, by the mid-14th century the lords of [[Freyberg]] had acquired the [[jus patronatus]] over the church.<ref name=\"Beck\" /> In the early 15th century the village came into the possession of several [[Ulm]] citizens and [[Gutenzell Abbey]]. The abbey also had the right to exercise [[High, middle and low justice|low justice]].<ref name=\"Oberamt\">{{cite book|editor=K\u00f6niglich Statistisch-Topographisches Bureau (W\u00fcrttemberg)|title=Beschreibung des Oberamts Laupheim|publisher=Hallberger |  |date=1856|location=Stuttgart|pages=264f. |url= |isbn = |language=de}}</ref> The parts belonging to the Ulm citizens were sold to ''Spital'', a charitable institution for all citizens founded in 1239, from the [[Free imperial city]] [[Biberach an der Riss]] in 1439.<ref name=\"Ortsteil\" /> The rights to carry out high justice was first executed by the counts of Kirchberg but passed on to the Biberach Spital following its acquisition of parts of the village.<ref name=\"Oberamt\" /> When in 1536 Biberach introduced the [[Reformation|Protestant reformation]], Oberholzheim became Protestant as well. This meant that [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Gutenzell Abbey kept the responsibility for the maintenance of the church, but the instalment of Protestant clerics rested with the Protestant Spital in Biberach.<ref name=\"Ortsteil\" /> During the [[Thirty Years' War]], and in the course of the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]], a Catholic priest was installed in Oberholzheim in 1628, but had to abandon the [[parish]] after only four years in 1632. Up to 1803 two thirds of the village belonged to the Spital from Biberach and one third to Gutenzell Abbey.<ref name=\"Oberamt\" />\n \nDuring the course of the [[German mediatisation]] and the dissolution of Gutenzell Abbey, the part of the village belonging to the abbey became property of the [[Bavaria]]n counts of T\u00f6rring<ref name=\"Leo\">{{cite web | url = https://www.leo-bw.de/web/guest/detail-gis/-/Detail/details/ORT/labw_ortslexikon/17035/Oberholzheim+-+Altgemeinde%7ETeilort | title = Oberholzheim- Altgemeinde~Teilort |last= |first=   |author-link= | date  =  | publisher  = State of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] | language = German | page  = | format =  | accessdate = 23 February 2019}}</ref> whereas the Spital property within the village was handed over to the [[Margraviate of Baden]] in 1803.

All three symbols are held in [[Or (heraldry)|or]] and are on an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] in [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]]. The sword and the key represent the patron saints of the local church, St Peter and Paul whereas the ploughshare refers to the [[Agriculture|agrarian]] history and nature of the village.

In 1275 the church seemed to have still been affiliated to Weissenburg Abbey and already been dedicated to [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]].<ref name=\"Leo\" /> \nRemains of an earlier structure, incorporated into the current building, are the square base of the [[bell tower]] as well as the lower parts of the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]].<ref name=\"Ortsteil\" /> The church was converted into [[Baroque]] style in 1739 under the guidance of Maria Bernarda von Donnersberg, [[abbess]] of Gutenzell Abbey. None of the Baroque furnishings have, however, survived the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] renovation carried out in 1874. Only a [[Noli me tangere]] painting attributed to Franz Carl Stauder remains. The Neo=Gothic [[altar]], [[pulpit]] and [[baptismal font]] were installed in 1874. The [[painted ceiling|ceiling]] was painted by [[Hans Gottfried von Stockhausen]] in 1953 and 1954.<ref name=\"Beck\" /> \n\n=== Tithe barn ===\nThe [[tithe barn]] was erected in 1498 on instructions from Gutenzell Abbey. The abbey had the rights of [[tithe]]s in the village.

On 27 January 1968 [[COMUSMACV]] General [[William Westmoreland]] ordered the establishment of a new [[MACV]]/ARVN headquarters (known as MACV Forward) at [[Phu Bai Combat Base]] to control the war in Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb and [[Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean Province]]s.
