It was founded in 1957 and went out of business in 1997. At the time it filed the second time for bankruptcy, it had 169 Best stores and 11 Best Jewelry stores in 23 states, and a nationwide mail-order service. When in operation Best Products was traded on the [[NASDAQ]] exchange as \"BESTQ\".\n\n== History ==\nThe company was founded by [[Sydney Lewis]] and Frances Lewis. Sydney Lewis, a [[lawyer]] educated at [[Washington & Lee]] and [[Harvard Business School]], worked with his father managing an encyclopedia sales operation in Richmond. Lewis thought of selling additional merchandise along with the bills for encyclopedias. In 1957, the Lewises sent out their first catalog. The first showroom was at 4909 West Marshall Street in Richmond, just across the street from the new [[The Shops at Willow Lawn|Willow Lawn Shopping Center]].\n\nThe company had a strong sense of promotion and artistic sensibilities; it was legend in artistic circles that it would trade store merchandise for art. As a result, the company, as well as the Lewises, gathered a significant collection of 20th-century art. Much of the Lewis Collection can be seen at the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]].\n\n=== Sculpture in the Environment ===\nIn the 1970s, Best Products contracted with [[James Wines]]' \"[[Sculpture in the Environment]]\" (SITE) architecture firm to design nine highly unorthodox retail facilities, notably a tongue-in-cheek structure called the \"Indeterminate Facade\" in [[Houston, Texas]] with a severely distressed facade. This building purportedly \"appeared in more books on 20th-century architecture than photographs of any other modern structure\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.texaschapbookpress.com/magellanslog54/indeterminatefacadeintro.htm |title=Bye-bye, Best Products: An Architecture Fairy Tale |accessdate=August 8, 2015 |website=Magellan's Log |publisher=Texas Chapbook Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827012947/http://www.texaschapbookpress.com/magellanslog54/indeterminatefacadeintro.htm |archivedate=August 27, 2006 |url-status=dead |first=Diebold |last=Essen |date=August 2003}}</ref> In Richmond, the company built the Peeling Wall showroom that appeared to have a peeling facade (located on [[Midlothian Turnpike]]) as well as a Forest showroom that appeared to have trees growing out of it (located at 9008 [[Quioccasin Road]]). The store in Sacramento also had a unique design. In the morning, its corner entryway would slide open, and would slide back shut at night. The structure, with its breakaway entry removed, is now a Best Buy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mall-hall-of-fame.blogspot.com/2009/01/outparcel-best-products-store-at-arden.html |title=Best Products Arden Fair, Sacramento |date=January 12, 2009 |accessdate=August 8, 2015 |website=Mall Hall of Fame blog |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->}}</ref> Photographs of these storefronts appeared in several Best catalogs. One anchored the [[Eudowood Plaza]] in [[Towson, Maryland]], featuring a tilted front. As of 2007, most of these distinctive buildings have been converted into conventional buildings by removing the architectural embellishments, or in a few cases, demolished. The only building to retain its distinctive features is the Forest building in Richmond, now home to the West End Presbyterian Church, which has stated that the forest in the entryway has been an asset to the church's environment.\n\nTheir Parham Road headquarters, built in 1981 and designed by [[Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer]], was notable for an American Institute of Architects award and the use of [[Art Deco]] eagles rescued from a New York building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.henricomonthly.com/news/the-best-of-times |title=The Best of Times: Best Plaza awaits its next chapter |accessdate=August 8, 2015 |last=Griset |first=Rich |publisher=Henrico Monthly |date=<!--undated-->}}</ref> The giant BEST letters of the headquarters could be seen along Interstate 95 at Parham Road. Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer subsequently designed the West Wing of the Virginia Museum, which was funded by the Lewises<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://modentechgadgets.blogspot.com/2020/04/top-gadgets-in-kitchen.html|title=Top 7 gadgets in Kitchen|website=Top 7 gadgets in Kitchen|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>.\n\n=== Retail concept ===\n\nBest employed the \"catalog showroom\" concept for many of its product offerings. Although some product categories (such as sporting goods and toys) were stocked in traditional self-serve aisles, the majority of products (notably consumer electronics, housewares, and appliances) were featured as unboxed display models. Customers were permitted to examine and experiment with these models, and if found to be desirable, they could be purchased by submitting orders to store personnel. Saleable versions of the merchandise (usually boxed and/or in its original packaging) would then be retrieved from storage and delivered to a customer service area for subsequent purchase.\n\n=== Acquisitions ===\nAs a cost-saving measure, Best jointly published its catalog with [[Service Merchandise]] (founded by [[Harry Zimmerman]]) and [[Modern Merchandising]] (founded by [[Harold Roitenberg]]), and had regional non-compete agreements with those chains.\n\nIn 1982, Best acquired catalog competitors: [[Basco (department store)|Basco]], a chain with 19 catalog showrooms in the Northeast and Ohio; and Modern Merchandising, headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota with 76 showrooms under the names [[LaBelle's]], [[Dolgin's]], [[Jafco]], [[Miller Sales]], Rogers and Great Western. This was followed by the acquisition of Ashby's, a 9-store women's clothing chain, and the opening of four Best Jewelry stores in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Guide to the Records of Best Product Co., Inc. |publisher=Virginia Historical Society |year=2002 |isbn=0-945015-22-4 |editor-last=Gilmour |editor-first=Laura E. |oclc=248421247}}</ref>\n\n=== Bankruptcy ===\n[[File:BestStore.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Terrarium facade of [[Hialeah, Florida]] showroom]]\nBest filed twice for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection. The first bankruptcy period began in January 1991 and lasted through June 16, 1994. The second and final filing was made on September 24, 1996. At the time of the second filing, Best operated 169 Best stores and 11 Best Jewelry stores in 23 states, and a nationwide mail-order service.\n\nBest Products was traded on the [[NASDAQ]] exchange as \"BESTQ.\" It was de-listed on November 29, 1996, and Best did not appeal the NASDAQ decision.

It was founded in 1957 and went out of business in 1997. At the time it filed the second time for bankruptcy, it had 169 Best stores and 11 Best Jewelry stores in 23 states, and a nationwide mail-order service. When in operation Best Products was traded on the [[NASDAQ]] exchange as \"BESTQ\".\n\n== History ==\nThe company was founded by [[Sydney Lewis]] and Frances Lewis. Sydney Lewis, a [[lawyer]] educated at [[Washington & Lee]] and [[Harvard Business School]], worked with his father managing an encyclopedia sales operation in Richmond. Lewis thought of selling additional merchandise along with the bills for encyclopedias. In 1957, the Lewises sent out their first catalog. The first showroom was at 4909 West Marshall Street in Richmond, just across the street from the new [[The Shops at Willow Lawn|Willow Lawn Shopping Center]].\n\nThe company had a strong sense of promotion and artistic sensibilities; it was legend in artistic circles that it would trade store merchandise for art. As a result, the company, as well as the Lewises, gathered a significant collection of 20th-century art. Much of the Lewis Collection can be seen at the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]].\n\n=== Sculpture in the Environment ===\nIn the 1970s, Best Products contracted with [[James Wines]]' \"[[Sculpture in the Environment]]\" (SITE) architecture firm to design nine highly unorthodox retail facilities, notably a tongue-in-cheek structure called the \"Indeterminate Facade\" in [[Houston, Texas]] with a severely distressed facade. This building purportedly \"appeared in more books on 20th-century architecture than photographs of any other modern structure\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.texaschapbookpress.com/magellanslog54/indeterminatefacadeintro.htm |title=Bye-bye, Best Products: An Architecture Fairy Tale |accessdate=August 8, 2015 |website=Magellan's Log |publisher=Texas Chapbook Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827012947/http://www.texaschapbookpress.com/magellanslog54/indeterminatefacadeintro.htm |archivedate=August 27, 2006 |url-status=dead |first=Diebold |last=Essen |date=August 2003}}</ref> In Richmond, the company built the Peeling Wall showroom that appeared to have a peeling facade (located on [[Midlothian Turnpike]]) as well as a Forest showroom that appeared to have trees growing out of it (located at 9008 [[Quioccasin Road]]). The store in Sacramento also had a unique design. In the morning, its corner entryway would slide open, and would slide back shut at night. The structure, with its breakaway entry removed, is now a Best Buy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mall-hall-of-fame.blogspot.com/2009/01/outparcel-best-products-store-at-arden.html |title=Best Products Arden Fair, Sacramento |date=January 12, 2009 |accessdate=August 8, 2015 |website=Mall Hall of Fame blog |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->}}</ref> Photographs of these storefronts appeared in several Best catalogs. One anchored the [[Eudowood Plaza]] in [[Towson, Maryland]], featuring a tilted front. As of 2007, most of these distinctive buildings have been converted into conventional buildings by removing the architectural embellishments, or in a few cases, demolished. The only building to retain its distinctive features is the Forest building in Richmond, now home to the West End Presbyterian Church, which has stated that the forest in the entryway has been an asset to the church's environment.\n\nTheir Parham Road headquarters, built in 1981 and designed by [[Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer]], was notable for an American Institute of Architects award and the use of [[Art Deco]] eagles rescued from a New York building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.henricomonthly.com/news/the-best-of-times |title=The Best of Times: Best Plaza awaits its next chapter |accessdate=August 8, 2015 |last=Griset |first=Rich |publisher=Henrico Monthly |date=<!--undated-->}}</ref> The giant BEST letters of the headquarters could be seen along Interstate 95 at Parham Road. Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer subsequently designed the West Wing of the Virginia Museum, which was funded by the Lewises.\n\n=== Retail concept ===\n\nBest employed the \"catalog showroom\" concept for many of its product offerings. Although some product categories (such as sporting goods and toys) were stocked in traditional self-serve aisles, the majority of products (notably consumer electronics, housewares, and appliances) were featured as unboxed display models. Customers were permitted to examine and experiment with these models, and if found to be desirable, they could be purchased by submitting orders to store personnel. Saleable versions of the merchandise (usually boxed and/or in its original packaging) would then be retrieved from storage and delivered to a customer service area for subsequent purchase.\n\n=== Acquisitions ===\nAs a cost-saving measure, Best jointly published its catalog with [[Service Merchandise]] (founded by [[Harry Zimmerman]]) and [[Modern Merchandising]] (founded by [[Harold Roitenberg]]), and had regional non-compete agreements with those chains.\n\nIn 1982, Best acquired catalog competitors: [[Basco (department store)|Basco]], a chain with 19 catalog showrooms in the Northeast and Ohio; and Modern Merchandising, headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota with 76 showrooms under the names [[LaBelle's]], [[Dolgin's]], [[Jafco]], [[Miller Sales]], Rogers and Great Western. This was followed by the acquisition of Ashby's, a 9-store women's clothing chain, and the opening of four Best Jewelry stores in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Guide to the Records of Best Product Co., Inc. |publisher=Virginia Historical Society |year=2002 |isbn=0-945015-22-4 |editor-last=Gilmour |editor-first=Laura E. |oclc=248421247}}</ref>\n\n=== Bankruptcy ===\n[[File:BestStore.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Terrarium facade of [[Hialeah, Florida]] showroom]]\nBest filed twice for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection. The first bankruptcy period began in January 1991 and lasted through June 16, 1994. The second and final filing was made on September 24, 1996. At the time of the second filing, Best operated 169 Best stores and 11 Best Jewelry stores in 23 states, and a nationwide mail-order service.\n\nBest Products was traded on the [[NASDAQ]] exchange as \"BESTQ.\" It was de-listed on November 29, 1996, and Best did not appeal the NASDAQ decision.

Her daughter, Ana Maria, is not Arnaldo's as everyone thinks, but Pablo's.\n\nThese two will have to face the lies, conflicts and sources that prevent them from regaining true happiness and love.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telenovelasplus.com/argumento-de-el-amor-las-vuelve-locas.html|title=Argumento de \u201cEl amor las vuelve locas\u201d|website=telenovelasplus.com|accessdate=25 May 2014|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Main ===\n* [[Lilibeth Morillo]] as ''Fernanda Santana de Arismendi''\n* [[Carlos Montilla]] as ''Pablo Mart\u00ednez''\n* [[Jorge Aravena]] as ''Arnaldo Arismendi''\n* Fabiola Colmenares as ''Raquel Espina''\n* [[Marisa Rom\u00e1n]] as ''Vanessa Montilla''\n* [[Juan Carlos Garc\u00eda (actor)|Juan Carlos Garc\u00eda]] as ''Guillermo \"Memo\" Morales''\n* Ana Karina Casanova as ''Ana Mar\u00eda Arismendi Santana''\n\n=== Secondary ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Nohely Arteaga]] as ''Mara Montilla''\n* [[Beatriz Vald\u00e9s]] as ''Scarlett Conde''\n* Henry Soto as ''Eduardo C\u00f3rdova''\n* Yanis Chimaras as ''Luciano Santib\u00e1\u00f1ez''\n* [[Gledys Ibarra]] as ''Irene P\u00e9rez''\n* [[Roberto Lamarca]] as ''Tob\u00edas San Juan''\n* Tania Sarabia as ''Olvido''\n* Alberto Alifa as ''Ignacio Aguirre''\n* Milena Santander as ''Pastora Cabrera''\n* [[Carmen Julia \u00c1lvarez]] as ''Amparo''\n* Chony Fuentes as ''Yolanda''\n* Loly S\u00e1nchez as ''Maximiliana Santana''\n* [[Daniela Bascop\u00e9]] as ''Rosaura Escobar''\n* [[Luis Ger\u00f3nimo Abreu]] as ''Emilio Aldana''\n* [[Mar\u00eda Antonieta Duque]] as ''Amapola Castillo''\n* Carlos Augusto Maldonado as ''Carli\u00f1o Costera''\n* Fernando Villate as ''Goliath Gonz\u00e1lez''\n* [[Rhandy Pi\u00f1ango]] as ''Alex''\n* [[Claudia La Gatta]] as ''Cristina Caudal''\n* [[Beba Rojas]] as ''Lily Fajardo''\n* Erika Schwarzgruber as ''Abiga\u00edl''\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb name|0450896|El amor las vuelve locas}}\n\n{{Venevisi\u00f3n telenovelas in 2000-2019}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amor Las Vuelve Locas, El}}\n[[Category:2005 telenovelas]]\n[[Category:Venevisi\u00f3n telenovelas]]\n[[Category:2005 Venezuelan television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Venezuelan telenovelas]]\n[[Category:2005 Venezuelan television series endings]]\n[[Category:Spanish-language telenovelas]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Caracas]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_amor_las_vuelve_locas"}

This article recounts controversies and allegations relating to both the domestic version of CNN, and its sister channels [[CNN International]] and [[CNN-News18]].\n\n==Allegations of bias==\n\nCNN has often been the subject of allegations of [[political party|party]] [[Media bias|bias]]. In research conducted by the [[Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy]] at [[Harvard University]] and the Project for Excellence in Journalism, the authors found disparate treatment by CNN of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates during the earliest five months of presidential primaries in 2007: \"The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates\u2014by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst (63% negative) and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral. It's not that Democrats, other than Obama, fared well on CNN either. Nearly half of the Illinois Senator\u2019s stories were positive (46%), vs. just 8% that were negative. But both Clinton and Edwards ended up with more negative than positive coverage overall. So while coverage for Democrats overall was a bit more positive than negative, that was almost all due to extremely favorable coverage for Obama.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shorensteincenter.org/2007/10/the-invisible-primary-invisible-no-longer/ |title=The Invisible Primary \u2014 Invisible No Longer - Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy |publisher=Shorensteincenter.org |date= |accessdate=November 14, 2012}}</ref>\nIn September 2009, a Pew Research Poll showed that Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to rate the network favorably, and Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to see CNN unfavorably.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/14/business/media/14survey.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Trust in News Media Falls to New Low in Pew Survey | first=Richard | last=P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a | date=September 14, 2009 | accessdate=March 31, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Octavia Nasr firing===\nIn 2010, Chief [[Middle East]] correspondent [[Octavia Nasr]] was fired after a [[Twitter|tweet]] saying she was \"Sad to hear of the passing of Saved [[Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah]]...

Her reason for her removal was given as \"As you know, her tweet over the weekend created a wide reaction.

In research conducted by the [[Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy]] at [[Harvard University]] and the Project for Excellence in Journalism, the authors found disparate treatment by CNN of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates during the earliest five months of presidential primaries in 2007: \"The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates\u2014by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst (63% negative) and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral. It's not that Democrats, other than Obama, fared well on CNN either. Nearly half of the Illinois Senator\u2019s stories were positive (46%), vs. just 8% that were negative. But both Clinton and Edwards ended up with more negative than positive coverage overall. So while coverage for Democrats overall was a bit more positive than negative, that was almost all due to extremely favorable coverage for Obama.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shorensteincenter.org/2007/10/the-invisible-primary-invisible-no-longer/ |title=The Invisible Primary \u2014 Invisible No Longer - Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy |publisher=Shorensteincenter.org |date= |accessdate=November 14, 2012}}</ref>\nIn September 2009, a Pew Research Poll showed that Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to rate the network favorably, and Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to see CNN unfavorably.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/14/business/media/14survey.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Trust in News Media Falls to New Low in Pew Survey | first=Richard | last=P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a | date=September 14, 2009 | accessdate=March 31, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Octavia Nasr firing===\nIn 2010, Chief [[Middle East]] correspondent [[Octavia Nasr]] was fired after a [[Twitter|tweet]] saying she was \"Sad to hear of the passing of Saved [[Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah]]...
