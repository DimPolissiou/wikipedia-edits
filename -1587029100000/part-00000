Austin]], who was an [[Anglo-American]] colonizer of [[Mexican Texas]]. As a teenager, Williams started working in the family's mercantile business in [[Baltimore]]. He spent time in South America and [[New Orleans]], fleeing the latter because of debts. He landed in Mexican Texas in 1822, having learned French and Spanish. Stephen F. Austin hired Williams for his colony in 1824. Williams first worked as a [[clerk]], and later assumed the title of secretary to the ''[[ayuntamiento]]'', a local government established for the colony by the Mexican state of [[Coahuila and Texas]].  He worked for Austin for about a decade.\n\nIn 1834, Williams quit as secretary of the Austin Colony to work as a merchant, then formalized a partnership with [[Thomas F. McKinney]]. The next year he also made deals with the provincial government in [[Monclova]] for a bank charter and for large tracts of land in Texas. At that time he was a representative in the Coahuila and Texas legislature. However, by 1836, Williams and his partner, Thomas F. McKinney, supported the [[Texas Revolution]] against Mexico. Williams borrowed money against his family's lines of credit, which the partners applied to ships and ammunition on behalf of the rebel government.\n\nAfter Texas gained [[Texas independence|independence]], Williams focused most of his business activities in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], and represented Galveston County for one term in the Republic of Texas legislature.  Through his partnership with McKinney he was invested in the Galveston City Company, and established diverse business interests there. The partnership ended when their business was acquired by [[Henry Howell Williams]] in 1842.\n\nAfter 1842, Williams worked toward establishing a bank in Texas. He briefly returned to public service when he accepted a diplomatic mission to negotiate a treaty with Mexico, which had still not recognized the sovereignty of the [[Republic of Texas]]. In the first year of Texas statehood, he ran twice for the U.S. House of Representatives, losing both times. In 1848 Williams succeeded in introducing the first bank in Texas: the Commercial & Agricultural Bank (C & A Bank).  This was the only institution to legally issue paper money, though his charter and the bank's practices faced legal challenges throughout its existence, including anti-banking legislation and scrutiny from various [[Texas Attorney General|Texas Attorneys General]]. Favorable decisions rendered by the district courts saved Williams and his bank for about four years. C & A Bank remained solvent during the [[Panic of 1857]], but anti-banking politics were on the rise. Many of Williams' friends and allies distanced themselves from the bank and encouraged him to give up the project, but he resisted their advice.  He died in 1858 after a short illness.  \n\n==Early life==\nSamuel May Williams was born October 4, 1795, in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], to Howell and Dorothy (Wheat) Williams.<ref name=tsha>Henson (2010).</ref><ref name=nichols190>Nichols (1952), pp. 190{{endash}}191.</ref><ref name=\"henson5\">Henson (1976), p. 5.</ref> His ancestors arrived in [[New England]] in the 1630s, and his family tree included a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and a president of [[Yale University]].<ref name=frantz>Frantz (1952), pp. 2{{endash}}3.</ref> Williams had four brothers and three sisters.<ref name=tsha/> His immediate family consisted of sailors and merchants; Howell Williams was a ship captain, and Samuel's uncle, Nathaniel Felton Williams, was a commission merchant in [[Baltimore]]. After some schooling in his native city, Samuel apprenticed to Nathaniel. A younger brother, also named Nathaniel Felton Williams, succeeded him as their uncle Nathaniel's apprentice.<ref name=\"henson5\"/>\n\nThe Williams family conducted a robust trade with Argentina, shipping food in exchange for cash or hides.<ref name=\"cartwright60\">Cartwright (1998), p. 60.</ref> Williams left Baltimore to oversee freight bound for [[Buenos Aires]], where he stayed to conduct further business in South America.<ref name=tsha/><ref name=nichols190/> There Williams learned the Spanish and French languages, and his business dealings gave him experience in navigating Spanish business and political customs.<ref name=\"cartwright60\"/> In 1818, Williams boarded at a hotel in Washington, D. C. (where pirate and New Orleans denizen [[Jean Lafitte]] had been a resident), and the next year, Williams was living and working in New Orleans.<ref name=\"henson1976-6\">Henson (1976), pp. 6{{endash}}7.</ref> Historians disagree about the timing of Williams's return to the United States from South America. While Joe B. Frantz and Ruth G. Nichols estimate his arrival to New Orleans as the year 1815,<ref name=nichols190/><ref>Frantz (1952), p. 2.</ref> Margaret Swett Henson disputes this as a possibility, though she is less certain about timeline.<ref name=\"henson1976-6\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===Gone to Texas===\nThe [[Panic of 1819]] in the United States forced many Americans into insolvency. By 1822, the opening of Mexican Texas to Anglo-colonization offered these distressed families an opportunity to escape debts by moving outside the jurisdiction of American law. Sometimes these debtors abandoned their property and wrote the letters \"GTT\" on their doors, an acronym for [[Gone to Texas]].<ref name=\"henson3\">Henson (1976), p. 3.</ref> Though Williams sold tobacco to the [[Karankawa people]] on [[Galveston Island]] in 1821,<ref>Cartwright (1991), p. 58.</ref> he joined the ranks of the immigrant debtors in May 1822. He and a female companion left New Orleans and the United States to escape debts and poor economic prospects. They registered under the names of Mr. and Mrs. E. Eccleston, and passed over the gangplanks of the [[sloop]] ''Good Intent''. The sailing ship met a storm in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and finally made landfall at the mouth of the [[Colorado River]] on June 18.<ref name=\"henson3\"/> \n\nAt this time Texas was a part of Mexico. [[Moses Austin]] had negotiated a contract to colonize part of Texas, but his death in 1821 put the deal in limbo. As Williams first arrived in Texas, [[Stephen F. Austin]], the son of Moses Austin, traveled to [[Mexico City]] in order to reinstate the contract and facilitate implementation of the Austin Colony. During Austin's visit, word reached Mexico City of a Mr. Eccleston, who was literate in English, Spanish, and French. By late 1823, Austin had returned to Texas and met Eccleston, who had established a local reputation by clerking and teaching school. Austin hired him in November. This is around the time that Williams reverted to his birth name. For a time both Williams and Austin had lived and worked in the same area of New Orleans, but there is no direct evidence that they had known each other prior to their meeting in 1823.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 3{{endash}}5.</ref>\n\n===Stephen F. Austin Colony===\n{{Main|Old Three Hundred}}\n[[File:San felipe de austin shs cabin 2007.jpg|thumb|alt=Replica log cabin representative of 1820s and 1830s Texas at San Felipe, Texas|Replica log cabin at San Felipe de Austin Historic Site]]\nWilliams was with Austin when the new empresario selected a location for his colonial headquarters, [[San Felipe de Austin]]. Austin first hired Williams as a translator and clerk, whose language skills, both in English and Spanish, were necessary to fulfill his responsibilities. Another critical skill was his handwriting. In an era when all documents were written by hand, the ability to write legibly was critical to properly reading them later.  Williams' knowledge of Mexican culture and Spanish business practices were also assets.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 9{{endash}}10.</ref> In the fall of 1824, Austin appointed Williams as a recording secretary for the [[Old Three Hundred|Austin Colony]]. Though [[Mexico]] had not yet established an ''[[ayuntamiento]]'' (local government) in the colony, Austin had told [[Jose Antonio Saucedo]] about his intention to establish the recording secretary position with all of the responsibilities of a secretary for an ''ayuntamiento''.<ref>Barker (1926), p. 117.</ref> Also in 1824, Williams received his own [[headright]], which included two leagues (about 4,428 acres each) and three ''labores'' (about 640 acres each). Austin had promised Williams an annual salary of $1,000, ($24,434 in 2019) but the colony was not generating much revenue.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 11{{endash}}13.</ref>\n\nWilliams continued to accept additional responsibilities at the Austin Colony. He managed the Public Land Office, and he served as its postmaster from 1826. He served as secretary of the ''ayuntamiento'' from 1828 to 1832,<ref>Nichols (1952), pp. 192{{endash}}194.</ref> a post requiring him to record official documents in Spanish and send them to the state government.<ref name=henson1992>Henson (1992), p. 4.</ref> Austin later claimed that Williams had been underpaid for his service and later compensated him with {{convert|49000|acre|sqkm}} of land in Texas.<ref name=tsha/> With his existing land grant of {{convert|9387|acre|sqkm}}, Williams had accumulated more than {{convert|58000|acre|sqkm}} of land in Texas.<ref name=henson1992/>\n\n===After the Austin Colony===\nEarly in 1834 Williams co-founded the partnership of McKinney and Williams, setting up a warehouse at [[Brazoria, Texas|Brazoria]], then relocated to [[Quintana, Texas|Quintana]] at the mouth of the [[Brazos River]]. The firm operated small steamboats on the Brazos and used its warehouse to manage transfer of freight to and from the larger ships operating on the Gulf of Mexico.<ref>Nichols (1952), pp. 198{{endash}}199.</ref>\n\nAn internal political battle in Mexico caused the state of [[Coahuila y Tejas|Coahuila and Texas]] to split into two capitals. Those loyal to [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] (''santanistas'') controlled the original capital, [[Saltillo]], while the rival ''federalistas'' established their capital at [[Monclova]]. During meetings at the state capital, Williams bought 100 [[league (unit)|leagues]] of land in northeast Texas from the Monclova government at an eighty percent discount. During the trip he also secured a bank charter, while selling $85,000 worth of its stock.<ref>Cartwright (1991), p. 61.</ref> However, back in Anglo-Texas, [[Consultation (Texas)|the Consultation]] nullified the land deal when it declared all large land grants voided in November 1835.<ref>Henson (1992), p. 5.</ref>\n\nIn 1835, Williams was elected as a delegate to the Coahuila and Texas Legislature, representing the district of Brazos.<ref>Nichols (1952), p. 196.</ref> That legislature offered for sale 3.5 million acres of land in the Mexican state, an action which many Texians (ethnic Anglos living in Mexican Texas) perceived as corrupt. His participation in the Monclova government aroused the resentment of such persons, many of whom were already suspicious of Williams because of his former position of power in granting land in the Austin Colony. From the perspective of Williams, a member of the federalist Monclova government, the massive land sale was a justified state action in defense of the [[Mexican Constitution of 1824]], which was challenged by Santa Anna and the Saltillo government. The Monclova government was raising money to prepare for a possible civil war in Coahuila.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 62{{endash}}63.</ref>\n\n===Texas independence===\n[[File:Wreck of the Invincible.jpg|thumb|alt=Artist's depiction of the Invincible as wrecked in 1837|''Invincible'' depicted as wrecked in 1837]]\nWith ''santanista'' [[Mart\u00edn Perfecto de Cos|General Mart\u00edn Perfecto de Cos]] marching from Saltillo, the Monclova legislature ended its session in late-May 1835 with most of its members fleeing the region. Many of the federalists were captured, including Williams who was taken after crossing the [[Rio Grande River]] at [[Presidio|Presidio, Texas]]. He was incarcerated at [[San Antonio]], but escaped on horseback in a plot engineered by his friend, [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Navarro]]. Williams arrived in San Felipe de Austin as an enemy of Santa Anna and Cos. At the same time, his actions in Monclova made him unpopular with Anglos in Texas.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 73{{endash}}75.</ref>\n\nWilliams went on a tour of the eastern United States in order to raise capital for his bank.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 79.</ref> Williams was selling stock in [[New York City|New York]] when he read about a possible war in Texas. He pivoted toward [[Texas independence]] while relying on financial assistance from his brother, Henry Howell Williams. He borrowed against his brother's credit to obtain the 125-ton schooner [[Texan schooner Invincible|''Invincible'']] in support of a Texian naval force.<ref>Cartwright (1991), pp. 63{{endash}}64.</ref> In May 1836, Williams returned with ammunition and supplies loaded on his schooner, along with as many as 700 volunteers on three other boats.<ref>Nichols (1952), p. 200.</ref> Mostly as a result of procurements Williams made in the United States in 1835, the McKinney and Williams partnership had contracted $99,000 in short-term debt on behalf of the [[Republic of Texas]]. The new government was not able to repay the debt.<ref>Henson (1992), pp. 8{{endash}}9.</ref><ref name=frantz/> These loans to the Texas cause had been leveraged by letters of credit from Henry Howell Williams. Thus the Republic of Texas mounted substantial debt from the account of the McKinney and Williams partnership, which in turn had at least of portion of its financial backing from Henry Howell Williams. After independence, Williams served the Republic of Texas as its loan commissioner while serving simultaneously as a procurement officer for the Texas Navy, serving both the [[Sam Houston]] and [[Mirabeau Lamar]] administrations.<ref>Nichols (1952), p. 203.</ref>\n\n===Galveston===\n====Mercantile business====\n[[File:Sb new york.png|thumb|alt=1842 advertisement for a steam packet line, with McKinney and Williams listed as agents|Advertisement for the steamer ''New York'' (via Portal to Texas History)]]\n[[File:Galveston wharf fees18Feb43.png|thumb|right|alt=1843 rates at the Galveston Wharf|Rates at the Galveston Wharf, 1843 (via Portal to Texas History)]]\n[[File:Galveston strand adv1844.png|thumb|alt=1844 advertisement|An 1844 advertisement jeweler near McKinney and Williams (via Portal to Texas History)]]\n[[File:Plan of the City of Galveston, Texas.jpg|thumb|alt=1845 Galveston map|Map of Galveston, circa 1845]]\nMcKinney and Williams were investors and co-founders of the Galveston City Company with [[Michel Branamour Menard|Michel B. Menard]]. Menard hatched the development scheme in 1833, coordinating to acquire a Mexican title to bayside land at the east end of Galveston Island from [[Juan Seguin]]. The next year Galveston City Company purchased from Seguin a ''[[Spanish customary units#League (unit of area)|league]] and a [[Spanish customary units#Labor (unit of area)|labor]]'', or about 4,605 acres.<ref name=mccomb42>McComb (1986), pp. 42{{endash}}43.</ref><ref>Henson (1976), p. 94.</ref> The McKinney and Williams investment was initially a fifty-percent share.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 94.</ref> In December 1836, the Republic of Texas announced it would validate this title in exchange for $50,000 in cash or merchandise. While there is no evidence of any payment to the Texas government, this action transferred land on the east end of the island to the Galveston City Company.<ref>Cartwright (1991), pp. 71{{endash}}72.</ref><ref name=mccomb42/> Both Williams and McKinney joined the company's board of directors, and voted with the board to make lots available for sale on April 20, 1838.<ref>McComb (1986), p. 43.</ref> \n\nMcKinney and Williams relocated its headquarters from Quintana to Galveston in 1838. The firm already operated a diverse set of businesses on the island: they owned a race track, operated a tavern and stables, and offered houses for let,<ref name=\":0\" /> and they owned the Tremont hotel, for which Henry Howell Williams was the managing partner.  The Tremont continued operating in Galveston through 1865.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />  Their principal developments were their three-story warehouse and the wharf at Twenty-fourth Street.<ref name=\":0\">Henson (1976), p. 105.</ref> In 1839, McKinney and Williams received goods from [[Liverpool]], [[England]], and loaded the same ship with Texas [[cotton]], establishing direct trade between England and the Republic of Texas.<ref name=\":1\">Nichols (1952), pp. 204{{endash}}205.</ref> McKinney and Williams divested their commission business in 1842, selling it to Henry Howell Williams, who ran it as a division of his commission house in Baltimore.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 115.</ref>\n\nIn 1839, Williams represented [[Galveston County, Texas|Galveston County]] in the lower house of the [[Congress of the Republic of Texas]].<ref>Nichols (1952), p. 206.</ref> McKinney and Williams used their commission house to support the Williams campaign. They offered to buy Texas Treasury notes (redbacks) for 50 cents on the dollar just as rival commission houses offered only 37.5 cents on the dollar.<ref>Cartwright (1998), p. 76.</ref> Substantively, he campaigned based on a conservative monetary policy in response to the Republic's devaluing currency.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 105\u2013109.</ref> \n\nWilliams once used his position in the House to assert the interests of the Galveston City Company, challenging the election of [[John M. Allen (soldier)|John M. Allen]], the town's first mayor. He led the passage of a bill to change Galveston's charter, which imposed a requirement of land ownership in order to vote in municipal elections. Effectively this reduced the number of eligible voters by half, and this paved the way for the \"conservatives\" to elect John W. Walton over the \"liberal\" John M. Allen in 1840. Allen transported the town's archives and stored them in his home, which was guarded by two artillery pieces. McKinney recruited a group of men to recapture the archives, and Allen surrendered them without incident.<ref>McComb (1986), pp. 43{{endash}}44.</ref>\n    \nWilliams chaired the finance committee for the lower house, and served as a member of the naval affairs committee. Williams allied with [[Sam Houston]]'s faction against President [[Mirabeau Lamar]]'s spending proposals and his Indian policy. He issued a finance report and proposal on January 12, 1840, which included two Hamiltonian recommendations: the recall of older debt instruments and stopping further issuance of unsecured debt. In addition, he proposed that Texas only accept payments in cash from importers and suggested a broad fifteen percent tariff on imported goods. This proposal was a political success, as all of its recommendations were adopted. However, inflation continued into 1841, as Texas redbacks traded at 37.5 cents on the dollar before he went to Austin and later depreciated to 12.5 cents. He sponsored a successful bill which established a state charter for the city of Galveston and another to build a local lighthouse. Williams promoted a bill to emancipate Cary McKinney, a slave of his business partner. Cary was just one of two enslaved persons emancipated in recognition to service to the Republic of Texas. Though Cary's family was not emancipated, he purchased his family members, and in this way, he reunited his own family.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 105\u2013109.</ref>\n\nPresident Sam Houston selected Williams for a diplomatic mission to Mexico. As late as 1843, Mexico did not recognize the sovereignty of Texas, while Santa Anna offered a general amnesty and other concessions to Texas provided it agreed to re-incorporate itself into Mexico. Houston agreed to a cease fire and peace talks. He appointed Williams and [[George Washington Hockley|George W. Hockley]] as envoys, charging them with entertaining a proposal which was unpopular in Texas.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 116{{endash}}118.</ref> The two envoys accepted their official orders in September 1843, but they lacked the authority to stand behind their own agreements, which would be subject to approval by the President and the Texas Congress. According to the Secretary of State, [[Anson Jones]], their job was to extend the process as long as possible. Meanwhile, unknown to Williams and Hockley, Texas negotiated an annexation treaty with the United States and appealed for sovereign recognition from Great Britain. The Texas War Department, on the other hand, instructed them to demand demilitarization of the [[Nueces Strip]], the corridor in south Texas between the Rio Grande and [[Nueces River|Nueces]] rivers. Diplomatically, Mexico claimed all of Texas as its sovereign territory; militarily, Mexico fortified at the Nueces River. Withdrawing from the Nueces Strip was an untenable position for Mexico, though Jones had told them that Mexico would agree to it. Williams and Hockley sailed for [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] in early October, but the venue changed to [[Sabinas]] while they in transit. After arriving, an illness postponed the meetings, so negotiations did not start until December. Their counterparts, Cayetano Montero and Alexander Ybara, did not consent to the Texans' proposal that Mexico withdraw troops beyond the Rio Grande River.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 120{{endash}}125.</ref>\n\nWilliams acquired a sugar plantation in 1844. This 1,100 acre parcel was located near the coast and west of Quintana, at the San Bernard River. Joseph and Austin Williams, two of his sons, managed the plantation for a brief period before its sale in 1850.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 149.</ref> \n\nWilliams ran for US Congress twice. A special election in 1846 was necessary to determine representation for Texas for the few months remaining of the Twenty-ninth Congress. Williams was one of six candidates for the Texas Second district while running on a platform of national assumption of Texas's debt. Texans would benefit from the passage of such legislation; however, Williams and his former business partner had not been repaid by the Republic of Texas for its war debt. He finished second to [[Timothy Pillsbury]]. He challenged Pillsbury for the seat in November and lost by a wider margin, the last time he would run for public office.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 132{{endash}}137.</ref>\n\n====Commercial and Agricultural Bank====\n[[File:Commercial and Agricultural Bank of Texas $1.00 (one dollar) private scrip (8519862080).jpg|thumb|alt=One dollar scrip issued by the Commercial & Agricultural Bank|$1.00 (one dollar) private scrip issued by Commercial and Agricultural Bank of Texas]]\n[[File:Galveston island 1853.png|thumb|alt=1853 map of Galveston|Map of 1853 showing eastern entrance to Galveston Bay and the east end of Galveston Island (via Portal to Texas History]]\nWilliams was president of the first incorporated bank to operate in Texas. The Commercial and Agricultural Bank opened in Galveston on December 30, 1847, and later established a branch in [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]], as well as agencies in New Orleans, New York City, and [[Akron, Ohio]]. Williams continued as the bank's president until his death.<ref>Nichols, pp. 208{{endash}}210.</ref> Williams exploited his latent 1835 Mexican bank charter and an old resolution from the Republic of Texas. He had permission to open a bank during the Texas Republic, but did not use this privilege. The Texas bank inspector, Niles F. Smith, never had an opportunity to execute his duties in 1837, but he was never officially relieved of his appointed post. Williams recalled inspector Smith in 1847, who certified the bank's assets in Galveston, New Orleans, and New York. Williams operated out of a building at the corner of Market and Tremont streets.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nThree months later the Texas Legislature proscribed the distribution of paper money, creating a civil fine of $5,000 per offense. Despite this law, $30,000 of the Commercial & Agricultural bank notes had been circulating in New Orleans that year, with another $18,000 distributed in Texas. Meanwhile, Williams maintained a large cache of specie to cover redemptions of his notes. Two members of the Texas Congress headed an opposition to the C & A Bank: [[Guy M. Bryan]] and [[Elisha M. Pease]]. Attorney General and Pease-ally John W. Harris filed a lawsuit against Williams, who retained Galveston-attorney, [[Ebenezer Allen (Texas politician)|Ebenezer C. Allen]]. Harris filed a total of four suits against Williams with $75,000 in fines. In 1849, a District Court ruled that an 1841 law that gave Williams banking privileges was still valid.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 141\u2013144.</ref>\n\nIn 1849, Williams gained an ally in the state congress. His former partner in the mercantile trade, Thomas McKinney gained a seat in the lower house and sought to repeal the 1848 banking laws. McKinney also found common cause with Williams in relation to the incoming Attorney General, [[Andrew Jackson Hamilton]]. For McKinney it was personal, and for Williams it was business. Hamilton had prosecuted the case against Williams in district court and was then the official in charge of enforcing the 1848 banking act. McKinney took over as chairman of a special investigations committee, which determined that Hamilton had failed to report \"widespread corruption\". After the legislature passed a reform bill to change the office of Attorney General into an elected one, McKinney campaigned for the election of Ebenezer C. Allen, Williams's lawyer.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 144\u2013145.</ref>\n\nLiquidity in Galveston conferred an advantage for local business interests to finance large infrastructure projects. The C & A bank financed the Galveston and Brazos Navigation Company, chartered in 1850. The company cut a channel through the shallow, sandy bottoms, from the coast at the west end of Galveston Island to the mouth of the Brazos River.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 147.</ref>\n\nIn March 1852, the Texas Supreme Court ruled on the state's appeal in the Williams case. The prosecution strategy was based on challenging the legality of the charter, but the court affirmed the 1835 charter and the 1841 relief law. In response to the decision, Bryan and Hamilton devised a new strategy, emphasizing the illegality of paper money issuance, and fining anyone who issued or circulated paper money. By the end of the year, a new attorney general, [[Thomas J. Jennings]] sued officers of the C & A Bank, though it was dismissed by District Judge [[Peter W. Gray]]. Jennings continued to file similar suits against two Galveston financiers into the next year, while Gray continued to dismiss them.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 151\u2013153.</ref>\n\nEarly in 1857, District Judge Gray fined [[Robert G. Mills]] $100,000 after a jury found him guilty of violating the 1848 banking act. The jury in the Williams trial was deadlocked, but his legal team recommended that he consent to a fine of $2,000 with a guilty plea. A few weeks later, Gray lost his election bid for the Texas Supreme Court to [[Oran M. Roberts]], with the court seating an anti-banking, pro-agrarian judge. The political climate did not favor Williams and his banking interests in 1857, but an economic panic was a greater threat. A bank closed for business in New York that August, and by October, three banks in New Orleans stopped paying in specie. This triggered a mass of demands for redemptions at both Galveston banks, which prompted Williams to refuse to honor some depositors' checks. An early closing triggered a sharp discount on his bank notes, but local fears were allayed after local merchants honored the Williams notes at par, and Williams reversed his policy, resuming payments in specie. Williams survived the Panic of 1857. However, political and legal prospects for his bank did not improve. Williams persisted in the banking business despite the legal challenges, and he resisted the advice of family and friends to divest of C & A Bank.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 156\u2013161.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n===Family life===\nIn 1822, Williams and a female companion arrived in Texas under the assumed names of Mr. and Mrs. E. Eccleston.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 3.</ref> He left unresolved debt in New Orleans, but there may have been other reasons for his departure. The couple lived together in San Felipe de Austin, but there is no indication of their marital status or even her name. They had a son together named Joseph Guadalupe Victoria Williams, who was born in San Felipe de Austin in 1825. The next year Williams split up with her, and she left the colony, taking their son with her. After her death, Williams brought Joseph back to Texas and raised him as a member of his family.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 7{{endash}}8.</ref>\n\nWilliams married Sarah Patterson Scott on March 4, 1828, at San Felipe de Austin. A native of [[Kentucky]], she emigrated to Texas with her parents William and Mary Scott in 1824. Sarah Williams gave birth to nine children, five of whom survived to adulthood.<ref>Nichols (1952), pp. 195{{endash}}196.</ref> By 1829, Samuel and Sarah Williams were caring for two children: their newborn daughter Sophia Caroline Williams and his four-year-old son \"Vic\" from the previous relationship. By 1830, Williams had already moved his family from ''Calle Commercio'' to a lot on the outskirts of town, and added onto this wood-framed house, then finished it with locally milled siding and brick, and with imported sash from New Orleans. In addition to his annual salary of $1,000, he received a seven-league bonus in 1830 for service to the ''ayuntamiento''. He selected seven leagues scattered throughout the colony.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 19{{endash}}21.</ref>\n\nAfter escaping from jail in June 1835, Williams moved his family from the seat of the Austin Colony to Quintana.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 74, 76.</ref> While Samuel was in the United States, Sarah fled her home during the [[Runaway Scrape]] early in 1836. By that time, the Williams's had already relocated from San Felipe de Austin to Quintana, the site of the McKinney and Williams warehouse, where the McKinneys also lived. Thomas McKinney and [[William H. Jack]] transported a small contingent of people from Quintana over the Gulf to McKinney's warehouse at the mouth of the [[Neches River]].<ref>Henson (2012), pp. 85{{endash}}86.</ref>\n\nFor the four years ending in the summer of 1839, business travels on behalf of his own interests and in support of the Texas cause kept him occupied in the United States. He only resided with his family for eight months during this period.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. vi{{endash}}vii.</ref>\n\n===Freemasonry===\nThe Independent Royal Arch Lodge No. 2, Free & Accepted Masons initiated Williams in New York City on November 21, 1835.<ref>Duncan (1904), p. 280.</ref> Williams received the first three degrees of Freemasonry that same night. Four days later, on November 25, 1835, he received all the degrees of the Royal Arch chapter in Jerusalem Chapter No. 8, Royal Arch Masons. Six days later, on December 1, 1835, he received the orders of Masonic Knighthood in Morton Commandery No. 4, Knights Templar. A week after that, on December 8, 1835, the General Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, meeting in Washington, D.C., granted Williams a charter for a chapter of Royal Arch Masons to be known as San Felipe de Austin Chapter No. 1, it being the first Royal Arch chapter in Texas, and he was installed as its first presiding officer.<ref>Lightfoot (1943), pp. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\nAs a Freemason, Williams became a member of a fraternity that included a number of other early Texas patriots like Stephen F. Austin, Sam Houston, [[Jose Antonio Navarro]] and [[Lorenzo de Zavala]].<ref>Carter (1955), pp. 425\u2013466.</ref> Williams \"was the moving spirit\" behind the formation of the first Masonic lodge in Galveston, and is considered \"the father\" of Galveston's Harmony Lodge No. 6.<ref>Petitfils (1997)</ref> Williams represented Harmony Lodge at the annual Grand Lodge meeting in December 1839.

The large tract included a pasture, a vegetable garden, and several outbuildings. They kept henhouse and a cowpen for their own consumption of eggs and other dairy, as well as stables and a carriage house. The Williams' owned slaves, perhaps all from the same family, who worked in the house and other parts of the property. Allegedly a cook attempted to poison the family in 1842; however, there is no record to indicate any punishment, legal or otherwise.<ref>Henson (1992), pp. 17, 19.</ref>\n\nThis suburban area near the Williams house was home to several local merchants during the 1840s. In addition to the McKinney house, his neighbors included Michel Menard, John Sydnor, and two of the Borden brothers. Menard was a co-founder of Galveston with McKinney and Williams, and engaged as a merchant with J. Temple Doswell. Sydnor was a commission merchant, and is known to have auctioned enslaved persons, though there is a question about whether this was a regular part of his business. Thomas and [[Gail Borden|Gail Borden Jr.]] co-published the ''[[Telegraph and Texas Register]]'' before moving to Galveston. Thomas surveyed land in the Austin Colony before the Texas Revolution. Gail, during part of his stay in Galveston, was a collector of customs, but he is best known for inventing a process for condensed milk.<ref>Henson (1992), pp. 27{{endash}}37.</ref> Despite the population growth of Galveston through 1850, this neighborhood ceded its popularity among the wealthy to the Broadway corridor in the next decade.<ref>Henson (1992), p. 40.</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nWilliams died on September 13, 1858 after an illness of about two weeks.

The ruling had three consequences for the bank: it made the bank responsible for paying a large fine imposed by the lower court, it lost the ability to issue notes, and all notes outstanding were to be redeemed and destroyed. This effectively killed the bank, though Williams did not live quite long enough to witness its ending.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 162{{endash}}163.</ref> Biographer Margaret Swett Henson writes, \"The ten-year court battle with its political overtones had eroded his once robust health, and despairing of vindication, he relinquished the struggle and allowed despondency to triumph.\"<ref>Henson (1976), p. 163.</ref> Journalist Gary Cartwright claims that Williams \"died a bitter and frustrated old man, emotionally, physically, and financially drained.\"<ref>Cartwright (1998), p. 83.</ref> \n\nWilliams, through his business partnership with McKinney, supported the war for independence with cash, and with goods and services in-kind, including ships, mercenaries, and ammunition. Williams died in 1858, without seeing any repayment by the Republic or by the State of Texas. McKinney continued to assert the claims of the partnership, but died in 1873 before succeeding in this advocacy. Upon his death, the state acknowledged $17,000, a small portion of the claim, but did not remit any funds to his estate. The State of Texas finally acknowledged the legacy of the Williams and McKinney contributions through a repayment in 1835.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 137-138.</ref> \n\nTexas historian Joe Frantz characterizes the partnership of McKinney and Williams as \"Underwriters of the Texas Revolution,\" since, \"without their aid [Sam] Houston's army conceivably would have lacked clothes, provisions, and most especially, arms.\"<ref>Frantz (1952), p. 1.</ref> Yet Cartwright notes a lack of acknowledgement of the legacy of Williams in his adopted hometown: \"Today hardly anyone in Galveston remembers his name or what he did. The city of Galveston is tireless, almost shameless, in its devotion to its heroes, but there is no street, no park, no school or building or monument that bears the name Samuel May Williams.\"<ref>Cartwright (1998), p. 83.</ref> He also cites examples of actions by Williams which were corrupt, or at least, perceived to be corrupt by dint of their association with what many Texans considered to be unsavory business and political dealings. Williams was labelled a \"Monclova speculator\" by some of his Texian contemporaries, a reference to his advantageous land acquisitions from the rebelling anti-Santanista faction in Coahuila.<ref>Cartwright (1998), p. 61.</ref> After Texas independence, the Republic brokered a deal acknowledging a legacy land grant from the Monclova government and conveying it to the Galveston Town Company, which included Williams as one of its business partners.<ref>Cartwright (1998), pp. 71{{endash}}72.</ref> Cartwright alleges that Williams was conscious of his own standing in Galveston when he ran for the Congress of the Texas Republic in 1839. Leading up to the election, McKinney and Williams offered favorable exchange rates for Texas treasury notes compared to their local business rivals, which Cartwright suggests was a successful attempt to buy votes.<ref>Cartwright (1998), p. 76.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|last=Barker|first=Eugene C.|year=1926|version=1969 reprint| title=The Life of Stephen F.

Austin]], who was an [[Anglo-American]] colonizer of [[Mexican Texas]]. As a teenager, Williams started working in the family's mercantile business in [[Baltimore]]. He spent time in South America and [[New Orleans]], fleeing the latter because of debts. He landed in Mexican Texas in 1822, having learned French and Spanish. Stephen F. Austin hired Williams for his colony in 1824. Williams first worked as a [[clerk]], and later assumed the title of secretary to the ''[[ayuntamiento]]'', a local government established for the colony by the Mexican state of [[Coahuila and Texas]].  He worked for Austin for about a decade.\n\nIn 1834, Williams quit as secretary of the Austin Colony to work as a merchant, then formalized a partnership with [[Thomas F. McKinney]]. The next year he also made deals with the provincial government in [[Monclova]] for a bank charter and for large tracts of land in Texas. At that time he was a representative in the Coahuila and Texas legislature. However, by 1836, Williams and his partner, Thomas F. McKinney, supported the [[Texas Revolution]] against Mexico. Williams borrowed money against his family's lines of credit, which the partners applied to ships and ammunition on behalf of the rebel government.\n\nAfter Texas gained [[Texas independence|independence]], Williams focused most of his business activities in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], and represented Galveston County for one term in the Republic of Texas legislature.  Through his partnership with McKinney he was invested in the Galveston City Company, and established diverse business interests there. The partnership ended when their business was acquired by [[Henry Howell Williams]] in 1842.\n\nAfter 1842, Williams worked toward establishing a bank in Texas. He briefly returned to public service when he accepted a diplomatic mission to negotiate a treaty with Mexico, which had still not recognized the sovereignty of the [[Republic of Texas]]. In the first year of Texas statehood, he ran twice for the U.S. House of Representatives, losing both times. In 1848 Williams succeeded in introducing the first bank in Texas: the Commercial & Agricultural Bank (C & A Bank).  This was the only institution to legally issue paper money, though his charter and the bank's practices faced legal challenges throughout its existence, including anti-banking legislation and scrutiny from various [[Texas Attorney General|Texas Attorneys General]]. Favorable decisions rendered by the district courts saved Williams and his bank for about four years. C & A Bank remained solvent during the [[Panic of 1857]], but anti-banking politics were on the rise. Many of Williams' friends and allies distanced themselves from the bank and encouraged him to give up the project, but he resisted their advice.  He died in 1858 after a short illness.  \n\n==Early life==\nSamuel May Williams was born October 4, 1795, in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], to Howell and Dorothy (Wheat) Williams.<ref name=tsha>Henson (2010).</ref><ref name=nichols190>Nichols (1952), pp. 190{{endash}}191.</ref><ref name=\"henson5\">Henson (1976), p. 5.</ref> His ancestors arrived in [[New England]] in the 1630s, and his family tree included a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and a president of [[Yale University]].<ref name=frantz>Frantz (1952), pp. 2{{endash}}3.</ref> Williams had four brothers and three sisters.<ref name=tsha/> His immediate family consisted of sailors and merchants; Howell Williams was a ship captain, and Samuel's uncle, Nathaniel Felton Williams, was a commission merchant in [[Baltimore]]. After some schooling in his native city, Samuel apprenticed to Nathaniel. A younger brother, also named Nathaniel Felton Williams, succeeded him as their uncle Nathaniel's apprentice.<ref name=\"henson5\"/>\n\nThe Williams family conducted a robust trade with Argentina, shipping food in exchange for cash or hides.<ref name=\"cartwright60\">Cartwright (1998), p. 60.</ref> Williams left Baltimore to oversee freight bound for [[Buenos Aires]], where he stayed to conduct further business in South America.<ref name=tsha/><ref name=nichols190/> There Williams learned the Spanish and French languages, and his business dealings gave him experience in navigating Spanish business and political customs.<ref name=\"cartwright60\"/> In 1818, Williams boarded at a hotel in Washington, D. C. (where pirate and New Orleans denizen [[Jean Lafitte]] had been a resident), and the next year, Williams was living and working in New Orleans.<ref name=\"henson1976-6\">Henson (1976), pp. 6{{endash}}7.</ref> Historians disagree about the timing of Williams's return to the United States from South America. While Joe B. Frantz and Ruth G. Nichols estimate his arrival to New Orleans as the year 1815,<ref name=nichols190/><ref>Frantz (1952), p. 2.</ref> Margaret Swett Henson disputes this as a possibility, though she is less certain about timeline.<ref name=\"henson1976-6\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===Gone to Texas===\nThe [[Panic of 1819]] in the United States forced many Americans into insolvency. By 1822, the opening of Mexican Texas to Anglo-colonization offered these distressed families an opportunity to escape debts by moving outside the jurisdiction of American law. Sometimes these debtors abandoned their property and wrote the letters \"GTT\" on their doors, an acronym for [[Gone to Texas]].<ref name=\"henson3\">Henson (1976), p. 3.</ref> Though Williams sold tobacco to the [[Karankawa people]] on [[Galveston Island]] in 1821,<ref>Cartwright (1991), p. 58.</ref> he joined the ranks of the immigrant debtors in May 1822. He and a female companion left New Orleans and the United States to escape debts and poor economic prospects. They registered under the names of Mr. and Mrs. E. Eccleston, and passed over the gangplanks of the [[sloop]] ''Good Intent''. The sailing ship met a storm in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and finally made landfall at the mouth of the [[Colorado River]] on June 18.<ref name=\"henson3\"/> \n\nAt this time Texas was a part of Mexico. [[Moses Austin]] had negotiated a contract to colonize part of Texas, but his death in 1821 put the deal in limbo. As Williams first arrived in Texas, [[Stephen F. Austin]], the son of Moses Austin, traveled to [[Mexico City]] in order to reinstate the contract and facilitate implementation of the Austin Colony. During Austin's visit, word reached Mexico City of a Mr. Eccleston, who was literate in English, Spanish, and French. By late 1823, Austin had returned to Texas and met Eccleston, who had established a local reputation by clerking and teaching school. Austin hired him in November. This is around the time that Williams reverted to his birth name. For a time both Williams and Austin had lived and worked in the same area of New Orleans, but there is no direct evidence that they had known each other prior to their meeting in 1823.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 3{{endash}}5.</ref>\n\n===Stephen F. Austin Colony===\n{{Main|Old Three Hundred}}\n[[File:San felipe de austin shs cabin 2007.jpg|thumb|alt=Replica log cabin representative of 1820s and 1830s Texas at San Felipe, Texas|Replica log cabin at San Felipe de Austin Historic Site]]\nWilliams was with Austin when the new empresario selected a location for his colonial headquarters, [[San Felipe de Austin]]. Austin first hired Williams as a translator and clerk, whose language skills, both in English and Spanish, were necessary to fulfill his responsibilities. Another critical skill was his handwriting. In an era when all documents were written by hand, the ability to write legibly was critical to properly reading them later.  Williams' knowledge of Mexican culture and Spanish business practices were also assets.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 9{{endash}}10.</ref> In the fall of 1824, Austin appointed Williams as a recording secretary for the [[Old Three Hundred|Austin Colony]]. Though [[Mexico]] had not yet established an ''[[ayuntamiento]]'' (local government) in the colony, Austin had told [[Jose Antonio Saucedo]] about his intention to establish the recording secretary position with all of the responsibilities of a secretary for an ''ayuntamiento''.<ref>Barker (1926), p. 117.</ref> Also in 1824, Williams received his own [[headright]], which included two leagues (about 4,428 acres each) and three ''labores'' (about 640 acres each). Austin had promised Williams an annual salary of $1,000, ($24,434 in 2019) but the colony was not generating much revenue.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 11{{endash}}13.</ref>\n\nWilliams continued to accept additional responsibilities at the Austin Colony. He managed the Public Land Office, and he served as its postmaster from 1826. He served as secretary of the ''ayuntamiento'' from 1828 to 1832,<ref>Nichols (1952), pp. 192{{endash}}194.</ref> a post requiring him to record official documents in Spanish and send them to the state government.<ref name=henson1992>Henson (1992), p. 4.</ref> Austin later claimed that Williams had been underpaid for his service and later compensated him with {{convert|49000|acre|sqkm}} of land in Texas.<ref name=tsha/> With his existing land grant of {{convert|9387|acre|sqkm}}, Williams had accumulated more than {{convert|58000|acre|sqkm}} of land in Texas.<ref name=henson1992/>\n\n===After the Austin Colony===\nEarly in 1834 Williams co-founded the partnership of McKinney and Williams, setting up a warehouse at [[Brazoria, Texas|Brazoria]], then relocated to [[Quintana, Texas|Quintana]] at the mouth of the [[Brazos River]]. The firm operated small steamboats on the Brazos and used its warehouse to manage transfer of freight to and from the larger ships operating on the Gulf of Mexico.<ref>Nichols (1952), pp. 198{{endash}}199.</ref>\n\nAn internal political battle in Mexico caused the state of [[Coahuila y Tejas|Coahuila and Texas]] to split into two capitals. Those loyal to [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] (''santanistas'') controlled the original capital, [[Saltillo]], while the rival ''federalistas'' established their capital at [[Monclova]]. During meetings at the state capital, Williams bought 100 [[league (unit)|leagues]] of land in northeast Texas from the Monclova government at an eighty percent discount.

His participation in the Monclova government aroused the resentment of such persons, many of whom were already suspicious of Williams because of his former position of power in granting land in the Austin Colony. From the perspective of Williams, a member of the federalist Monclova government, the massive land sale was a justified state action in defense of the [[Mexican Constitution of 1824]], which was challenged by Santa Anna and the Saltillo government. The Monclova government was raising money to prepare for a possible civil war in Coahuila.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 62{{endash}}63.</ref>\n\n===Texas independence===\n[[File:Wreck of the Invincible.jpg|thumb|alt=Artist's depiction of the Invincible as wrecked in 1837|''Invincible'' depicted as wrecked in 1837]]\nWith ''santanista'' [[Mart\u00edn Perfecto de Cos|General Mart\u00edn Perfecto de Cos]] marching from Saltillo, the Monclova legislature ended its session in late-May 1835 with most of its members fleeing the region. Many of the federalists were captured, including Williams who was taken after crossing the [[Rio Grande River]] at [[Presidio|Presidio, Texas]]. He was incarcerated at [[San Antonio]], but escaped on horseback in a plot engineered by his friend, [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Navarro]]. Williams arrived in San Felipe de Austin as an enemy of Santa Anna and Cos.

Thus the Republic of Texas mounted substantial debt from the account of the McKinney and Williams partnership, which in turn had at least of portion of its financial backing from Henry Howell Williams.

The next year Galveston City Company purchased from Seguin a ''[[Spanish customary units#League (unit of area)|league]] and a [[Spanish customary units#Labor (unit of area)|labor]]'', or about 4,605 acres.<ref name=mccomb42>McComb (1986), pp. 42{{endash}}43.</ref><ref>Henson (1976), p. 94.</ref> The McKinney and Williams investment was initially a fifty-percent share.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 94.</ref> In December 1836, the Republic of Texas announced it would validate this title in exchange for $50,000 in cash or merchandise.

The firm already operated a diverse set of businesses on the island: they owned a race track, operated a tavern and stables, and offered houses for let,<ref name=\":0\" /> and they owned the Tremont hotel, for which Henry Howell Williams was the managing partner.  The Tremont continued operating in Galveston through 1865.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />  Their principal developments were their three-story warehouse and the wharf at Twenty-fourth Street.<ref name=\":0\">Henson (1976), p. 105.</ref> In 1839, McKinney and Williams received goods from [[Liverpool]], [[England]], and loaded the same ship with Texas [[cotton]], establishing direct trade between England and the Republic of Texas.<ref name=\":1\">Nichols (1952), pp. 204{{endash}}205.</ref> McKinney and Williams divested their commission business in 1842, selling it to Henry Howell Williams, who ran it as a division of his commission house in Baltimore.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 115.</ref>\n\nIn 1839, Williams represented [[Galveston County, Texas|Galveston County]] in the lower house of the [[Congress of the Republic of Texas]].<ref>Nichols (1952), p. 206.</ref> McKinney and Williams used their commission house to support the Williams campaign.

Allen (soldier)|John M. Allen]], the town's first mayor. He led the passage of a bill to change Galveston's charter, which imposed a requirement of land ownership in order to vote in municipal elections. Effectively this reduced the number of eligible voters by half, and this paved the way for the \"conservatives\" to elect John W. Walton over the \"liberal\" John M. Allen in 1840. Allen transported the town's archives and stored them in his home, which was guarded by two artillery pieces. McKinney recruited a group of men to recapture the archives, and Allen surrendered them without incident.<ref>McComb (1986), pp. 43{{endash}}44.</ref>\n    \nWilliams chaired the finance committee for the lower house, and served as a member of the naval affairs committee. Williams allied with [[Sam Houston]]'s faction against President [[Mirabeau Lamar]]'s spending proposals and his Indian policy. He issued a finance report and proposal on January 12, 1840, which included two Hamiltonian recommendations: the recall of older debt instruments and stopping further issuance of unsecured debt. In addition, he proposed that Texas only accept payments in cash from importers and suggested a broad fifteen percent tariff on imported goods. This proposal was a political success, as all of its recommendations were adopted. However, inflation continued into 1841, as Texas redbacks traded at 37.5 cents on the dollar before he went to Austin and later depreciated to 12.5 cents. He sponsored a successful bill which established a state charter for the city of Galveston and another to build a local lighthouse. Williams promoted a bill to emancipate Cary McKinney, a slave of his business partner. Cary was just one of two enslaved persons emancipated in recognition to service to the Republic of Texas. Though Cary's family was not emancipated, he purchased his family members, and in this way, he reunited his own family.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 105\u2013109.</ref>\n\nPresident Sam Houston selected Williams for a diplomatic mission to Mexico. As late as 1843, Mexico did not recognize the sovereignty of Texas, while Santa Anna offered a general amnesty and other concessions to Texas provided it agreed to re-incorporate itself into Mexico. Houston agreed to a cease fire and peace talks. He appointed Williams and [[George Washington Hockley|George W. Hockley]] as envoys, charging them with entertaining a proposal which was unpopular in Texas.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 116{{endash}}118.</ref> The two envoys accepted their official orders in September 1843, but they lacked the authority to stand behind their own agreements, which would be subject to approval by the President and the Texas Congress. According to the Secretary of State, [[Anson Jones]], their job was to extend the process as long as possible. Meanwhile, unknown to Williams and Hockley, Texas negotiated an annexation treaty with the United States and appealed for sovereign recognition from Great Britain. The Texas War Department, on the other hand, instructed them to demand demilitarization of the [[Nueces Strip]], the corridor in south Texas between the Rio Grande and [[Nueces River|Nueces]] rivers. Diplomatically, Mexico claimed all of Texas as its sovereign territory; militarily, Mexico fortified at the Nueces River. Withdrawing from the Nueces Strip was an untenable position for Mexico, though Jones had told them that Mexico would agree to it. Williams and Hockley sailed for [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] in early October, but the venue changed to [[Sabinas]] while they in transit. After arriving, an illness postponed the meetings, so negotiations did not start until December. Their counterparts, Cayetano Montero and Alexander Ybara, did not consent to the Texans' proposal that Mexico withdraw troops beyond the Rio Grande River.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 120{{endash}}125.</ref>\n\nWilliams acquired a sugar plantation in 1844. This 1,100 acre parcel was located near the coast and west of Quintana, at the San Bernard River. Joseph and Austin Williams, two of his sons, managed the plantation for a brief period before its sale in 1850.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 149.</ref> \n\nWilliams ran for US Congress twice. A special election in 1846 was necessary to determine representation for Texas for the few months remaining of the Twenty-ninth Congress. Williams was one of six candidates for the Texas Second district while running on a platform of national assumption of Texas's debt. Texans would benefit from the passage of such legislation; however, Williams and his former business partner had not been repaid by the Republic of Texas for its war debt. He finished second to [[Timothy Pillsbury]]. He challenged Pillsbury for the seat in November and lost by a wider margin, the last time he would run for public office.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 132{{endash}}137.</ref>\n\n====Commercial and Agricultural Bank====\n[[File:Commercial and Agricultural Bank of Texas $1.00 (one dollar) private scrip (8519862080).jpg|thumb|alt=One dollar scrip issued by the Commercial & Agricultural Bank|$1.00 (one dollar) private scrip issued by Commercial and Agricultural Bank of Texas]]\n[[File:Galveston island 1853.png|thumb|alt=1853 map of Galveston|Map of 1853 showing eastern entrance to Galveston Bay and the east end of Galveston Island (via Portal to Texas History]]\nWilliams was president of the first incorporated bank to operate in Texas. The Commercial and Agricultural Bank opened in Galveston on December 30, 1847, and later established a branch in [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]], as well as agencies in New Orleans, New York City, and [[Akron, Ohio]]. Williams continued as the bank's president until his death.<ref>Nichols, pp. 208{{endash}}210.</ref> Williams exploited his latent 1835 Mexican bank charter and an old resolution from the Republic of Texas. He had permission to open a bank during the Texas Republic, but did not use this privilege. The Texas bank inspector, Niles F. Smith, never had an opportunity to execute his duties in 1837, but he was never officially relieved of his appointed post. Williams recalled inspector Smith in 1847, who certified the bank's assets in Galveston, New Orleans, and New York. Williams operated out of a building at the corner of Market and Tremont streets.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nThree months later the Texas Legislature proscribed the distribution of paper money, creating a civil fine of $5,000 per offense. Despite this law, $30,000 of the Commercial & Agricultural bank notes had been circulating in New Orleans that year, with another $18,000 distributed in Texas. Meanwhile, Williams maintained a large cache of specie to cover redemptions of his notes. Two members of the Texas Congress headed an opposition to the C & A Bank: [[Guy M. Bryan]] and [[Elisha M. Pease]]. Attorney General and Pease-ally John W. Harris filed a lawsuit against Williams, who retained Galveston-attorney, [[Ebenezer Allen (Texas politician)|Ebenezer C. Allen]]. Harris filed a total of four suits against Williams with $75,000 in fines. In 1849, a District Court ruled that an 1841 law that gave Williams banking privileges was still valid.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 141\u2013144.</ref>\n\nIn 1849, Williams gained an ally in the state congress. His former partner in the mercantile trade, Thomas McKinney gained a seat in the lower house and sought to repeal the 1848 banking laws. McKinney also found common cause with Williams in relation to the incoming Attorney General, [[Andrew Jackson Hamilton]]. For McKinney it was personal, and for Williams it was business. Hamilton had prosecuted the case against Williams in district court and was then the official in charge of enforcing the 1848 banking act. McKinney took over as chairman of a special investigations committee, which determined that Hamilton had failed to report \"widespread corruption\". After the legislature passed a reform bill to change the office of Attorney General into an elected one, McKinney campaigned for the election of Ebenezer C. Allen, Williams's lawyer.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 144\u2013145.</ref>\n\nLiquidity in Galveston conferred an advantage for local business interests to finance large infrastructure projects. The C & A bank financed the Galveston and Brazos Navigation Company, chartered in 1850. The company cut a channel through the shallow, sandy bottoms, from the coast at the west end of Galveston Island to the mouth of the Brazos River.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 147.</ref>\n\nIn March 1852, the Texas Supreme Court ruled on the state's appeal in the Williams case. The prosecution strategy was based on challenging the legality of the charter, but the court affirmed the 1835 charter and the 1841 relief law. In response to the decision, Bryan and Hamilton devised a new strategy, emphasizing the illegality of paper money issuance, and fining anyone who issued or circulated paper money. By the end of the year, a new attorney general, [[Thomas J. Jennings]] sued officers of the C & A Bank, though it was dismissed by District Judge [[Peter W. Gray]]. Jennings continued to file similar suits against two Galveston financiers into the next year, while Gray continued to dismiss them.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 151\u2013153.</ref>\n\nEarly in 1857, District Judge Gray fined [[Robert G. Mills]] $100,000 after a jury found him guilty of violating the 1848 banking act. The jury in the Williams trial was deadlocked, but his legal team recommended that he consent to a fine of $2,000 with a guilty plea. A few weeks later, Gray lost his election bid for the Texas Supreme Court to [[Oran M. Roberts]], with the court seating an anti-banking, pro-agrarian judge. The political climate did not favor Williams and his banking interests in 1857, but an economic panic was a greater threat. A bank closed for business in New York that August, and by October, three banks in New Orleans stopped paying in specie. This triggered a mass of demands for redemptions at both Galveston banks, which prompted Williams to refuse to honor some depositors' checks. An early closing triggered a sharp discount on his bank notes, but local fears were allayed after local merchants honored the Williams notes at par, and Williams reversed his policy, resuming payments in specie. Williams survived the Panic of 1857. However, political and legal prospects for his bank did not improve. Williams persisted in the banking business despite the legal challenges, and he resisted the advice of family and friends to divest of C & A Bank.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 156\u2013161.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n===Family life===\nIn 1822, Williams and a female companion arrived in Texas under the assumed names of Mr. and Mrs. E. Eccleston.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 3.</ref> He left unresolved debt in New Orleans, but there may have been other reasons for his departure. The couple lived together in San Felipe de Austin, but there is no indication of their marital status or even her name. They had a son together named Joseph Guadalupe Victoria Williams, who was born in San Felipe de Austin in 1825. The next year Williams split up with her, and she left the colony, taking their son with her. After her death, Williams brought Joseph back to Texas and raised him as a member of his family.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 7{{endash}}8.</ref>\n\nWilliams married Sarah Patterson Scott on March 4, 1828, at San Felipe de Austin. A native of [[Kentucky]], she emigrated to Texas with her parents William and Mary Scott in 1824. Sarah Williams gave birth to nine children, five of whom survived to adulthood.<ref>Nichols (1952), pp. 195{{endash}}196.</ref> By 1829, Samuel and Sarah Williams were caring for two children: their newborn daughter Sophia Caroline Williams and his four-year-old son \"Vic\" from the previous relationship. By 1830, Williams had already moved his family from ''Calle Commercio'' to a lot on the outskirts of town, and added onto this wood-framed house, then finished it with locally milled siding and brick, and with imported sash from New Orleans. In addition to his annual salary of $1,000, he received a seven-league bonus in 1830 for service to the ''ayuntamiento''. He selected seven leagues scattered throughout the colony.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 19{{endash}}21.</ref>\n\nAfter escaping from jail in June 1835, Williams moved his family from the seat of the Austin Colony to Quintana.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 74, 76.</ref> While Samuel was in the United States, Sarah fled her home during the [[Runaway Scrape]] early in 1836. By that time, the Williams's had already relocated from San Felipe de Austin to Quintana, the site of the McKinney and Williams warehouse, where the McKinneys also lived. Thomas McKinney and [[William H. Jack]] transported a small contingent of people from Quintana over the Gulf to McKinney's warehouse at the mouth of the [[Neches River]].<ref>Henson (2012), pp. 85{{endash}}86.</ref>\n\nFor the four years ending in the summer of 1839, business travels on behalf of his own interests and in support of the Texas cause kept him occupied in the United States. He only resided with his family for eight months during this period.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. vi{{endash}}vii.</ref>\n\n===Freemasonry===\nThe Independent Royal Arch Lodge No. 2, Free & Accepted Masons initiated Williams in New York City on November 21, 1835.<ref>Duncan (1904), p. 280.</ref> Williams received the first three degrees of Freemasonry that same night. Four days later, on November 25, 1835, he received all the degrees of the Royal Arch chapter in Jerusalem Chapter No. 8, Royal Arch Masons. Six days later, on December 1, 1835, he received the orders of Masonic Knighthood in Morton Commandery No. 4, Knights Templar. A week after that, on December 8, 1835, the General Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, meeting in Washington, D.C., granted Williams a charter for a chapter of Royal Arch Masons to be known as San Felipe de Austin Chapter No. 1, it being the first Royal Arch chapter in Texas, and he was installed as its first presiding officer.<ref>Lightfoot (1943), pp. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\nAs a Freemason, Williams became a member of a fraternity that included a number of other early Texas patriots like Stephen F.

The large tract included a pasture, a vegetable garden, and several outbuildings. They kept henhouse and a cowpen for their own consumption of eggs and other dairy, as well as stables and a carriage house. The Williams' owned slaves, perhaps all from the same family, who worked in the house and other parts of the property. Allegedly a cook attempted to poison the family in 1842; however, there is no record to indicate any punishment, legal or otherwise.<ref>Henson (1992), pp. 17, 19.</ref>\n\nThis suburban area near the Williams house was home to several local merchants during the 1840s. In addition to the McKinney house, his neighbors included Michel Menard, John Sydnor, and two of the Borden brothers. Menard was a co-founder of Galveston with McKinney and Williams, and engaged as a merchant with J. Temple Doswell. Sydnor was a commission merchant, and is known to have auctioned enslaved persons, though there is a question about whether this was a regular part of his business. Thomas and [[Gail Borden|Gail Borden Jr.]] co-published the ''[[Telegraph and Texas Register]]'' before moving to Galveston. Thomas surveyed land in the Austin Colony before the Texas Revolution. Gail, during part of his stay in Galveston, was a collector of customs, but he is best known for inventing a process for condensed milk.<ref>Henson (1992), pp. 27{{endash}}37.</ref> Despite the population growth of Galveston through 1850, this neighborhood ceded its popularity among the wealthy to the Broadway corridor in the next decade.<ref>Henson (1992), p. 40.</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nWilliams died on September 13, 1858 after an illness of about two weeks.

The ruling had three consequences for the bank: it made the bank responsible for paying a large fine imposed by the lower court, it lost the ability to issue notes, and all notes outstanding were to be redeemed and destroyed. This effectively killed the bank, though Williams did not live quite long enough to witness its ending.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 162{{endash}}163.</ref> Biographer Margaret Swett Henson writes, \"The ten-year court battle with its political overtones had eroded his once robust health, and despairing of vindication, he relinquished the struggle and allowed despondency to triumph.\"<ref>Henson (1976), p. 163.</ref> Journalist Gary Cartwright claims that Williams \"died a bitter and frustrated old man, emotionally, physically, and financially drained.\"<ref>Cartwright (1998), p. 83.</ref> \n\nWilliams, through his business partnership with McKinney, supported the war for independence with cash, and with goods and services in-kind, including ships, mercenaries, and ammunition. Williams died in 1858, without seeing any repayment by the Republic or by the State of Texas. McKinney continued to assert the claims of the partnership, but died in 1873 before succeeding in this advocacy. Upon his death, the state acknowledged $17,000, a small portion of the claim, but did not remit any funds to his estate. The State of Texas finally acknowledged the legacy of the Williams and McKinney contributions through a repayment in 1835.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 137-138.</ref> \n\nTexas historian Joe Frantz characterizes the partnership of McKinney and Williams as \"Underwriters of the Texas Revolution,\" since, \"without their aid [Sam] Houston's army conceivably would have lacked clothes, provisions, and most especially, arms.\"<ref>Frantz (1952), p. 1.</ref> Yet Cartwright notes a lack of acknowledgement of the legacy of Williams in his adopted hometown: \"Today hardly anyone in Galveston remembers his name or what he did. The city of Galveston is tireless, almost shameless, in its devotion to its heroes, but there is no street, no park, no school or building or monument that bears the name Samuel May Williams.\"<ref>Cartwright (1998), p. 83.</ref> He also cites examples of actions by Williams which were corrupt, or at least, perceived to be corrupt by dint of their association with what many Texans considered to be unsavory business and political dealings.

The NWA generally promoted strong [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shooters]] as champions, to give their worked sport credibility and guard against double-crosses. While doing strong business in the [[Midwest]] (the NWA's core region), these wrestlers attracted little interest in the CWC territory.

Mondt and McMahon wanted Rogers to keep the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, but Rogers was unwilling to sacrifice his $25,000 deposit on the [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|championship belt]] (championship holders at the time had to pay a deposit to insure they honored their commitments as champion). Rogers lost the NWA World Heavyweight Championship to [[Lou Thesz]] in a one-fall match in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] on January 24, 1963, which led to Mondt, McMahon, and the CWC leaving the NWA in protest, creating the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) in the process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/titles/nwa/worldheavyweight-detail.html|title=Online World of Wrestling|website=www.onlineworldofwrestling.com|access-date=December 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/wwwf-wwf/wwwf-wwf.htm|title=World Wide Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Federation|website=www.kayfabememories.com|access-date=December 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== World Wide Wrestling Federation ==\n\n=== Rise of Bruno Sammartino (1963\u20131979) ===\n[[File:Wwwf logo.jpg|thumb|140px|The official WWWF logo from 1963 to 1979]]\nThe World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) was formed on January 24, 1963.

Each little lord respected the rights of his neighboring little lord. No takeovers or raids were allowed.

I, of course, had no allegiance to those little lords.<ref name=\"1991SI\"/>}}\n\nUpon taking over the company, McMahon immediately worked to get WWF programming on syndicated television all across the United States. This angered other promoters and disrupted the well-established boundaries of the different wrestling promotions. In addition, the company used income generated by advertising, television deals, and tape sales to secure talent from rival promoters.\n\nCapitol Sports already controlled most of the northeastern territory, but the younger McMahon wanted WWF to be a national wrestling promotion; something the NWA did not approve of. He shortly defected his promotion from the NWA, much like the [[American Wrestling Association]], which controlled the U.S. Northern Midwest. To become a national promotion, WWF would have to become bigger than AWA or any NWA promotion.\n\nMcMahon's vision for his promotion was starting to become possible when he signed AWA talent [[Hulk Hogan]], who had achieved popularity outside of wrestling \u2013 notably for his appearance in ''[[Rocky III]]'' as [[Hulk Hogan|Thunderlips]].<ref>{{IMDb title|0084602}}</ref> McMahon signed [[Roddy Piper|Rowdy Roddy Piper]] as Hogan's rival, and shortly afterward signed [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura]]. Other significant wrestlers who were part of the roster included: [[Big John Studd]], [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]], [[Jimmy Snuka|Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka]], [[Don Muraco|\"The Magnificent\" Don Muraco]], [[Junkyard Dog]], [[Paul Orndorff|\"Mr. Wonderful\" Paul Orndorff]], [[Greg Valentine|Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine]], [[Ricky Steamboat|Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat]], and [[Nikolai Volkoff]]. In 1984, Hogan was [[push (professional wrestling)|pushed]] to main event status. He defeated WWF Heavyweight Champion [[The Iron Sheik]] at Madison Square Garden on January 23, 1984 and thus evolved into one of the most recognizable and popular faces in professional wrestling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/hulk-hogan-beats-iron-sheik-to-win-first-wwf-title|title=Hulk Hogan beats Iron Sheik to win first WWF title|last=Editors|first=History com|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=December 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hulk Hogan And Brutus Beefcake.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Hulk Hogan And Brutus Beefcake|[[Hulk Hogan]] (left), [[Sergeant Slaughter]] (centre) and [[Brutus Beefcake]] (right) were mainstays of 1980's WWF wrestling]]\nWith reasonable revenue being made, McMahon was able to secure television deals, and WWF was being shown across the United States.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} McMahon also began selling [[videotape]]s of WWF events outside the Northeast through his [[WWE Home Video|Coliseum Video]] distribution company, again angering other promoters.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The syndication of WWF programming forced promotions to engage in direct competition with the WWF.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The increased revenue allowed McMahon to sign more talent, such as [[Brutus Beefcake]], [[Tito Santana]], [[Jake Roberts|Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts]], [[Butch Reed]], and [[Jim Duggan|\"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan]].\n\nHowever, for McMahon to truly turn WWF into a national promotion, he needed to have WWF touring the entire United States.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Such a venture was impossible with the revenue WWF currently had, so McMahon envisioned a way to obtain the necessary capital through a risky all-or-nothing gamble on a [[supercard]] concept called [[WrestleMania]] in 1985. WrestleMania would be a [[pay-per-view]] extravaganza, viewable on [[closed-circuit television]] and marketed as the [[Super Bowl]] of professional wrestling. WrestleMania was not the first supercard seen in professional wrestling, as the NWA had previously run [[Starrcade]] in 1983. However, McMahon's vision was to make WWF and the industry itself mainstream, targeting more of the general television audience by exploiting the entertainment side of the industry. With the inaugural WrestleMania, WWF initiated a joint-promotional campaign with [[MTV]], which featured a great deal of WWF coverage and programming, in what was termed the ''[[1980s professional wrestling boom|Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]]''. The mainstream media attention brought on by [[Celebrity|celebrities]] including [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Mr. T]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]] at the event helped propel WrestleMania to become a staple in popular culture, and the use of celebrities has been a staple of the company to the present day.\n\nWith the success of WrestleMania, other promotions which tried hard to keep the regional territory system alive started to merge under [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP).{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Starrcade]] and [[The Great American Bash]] were the JCP versions of [[WrestleMania]], but even when operating inside of its territory, JCP had trouble matching the success of WWF.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} After [[Ted Turner]] purchased majority of JCP's assets, the promotion would become [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), providing WWF with a competitor until 2001, when WCW and its trademarks were purchased by WWF.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} WrestleMania would become an annual pay-per-view phenomenon, being broadcast in nearly 150 countries and in almost 20 different languages.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nPerhaps the peak of the 1980s wrestling boom was [[WrestleMania III]] at the [[Silverdome|Pontiac Silverdome]],{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} which set an attendance record of 93,173. In the main event [[Hulk Hogan]] retained the WWF Championship against [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Powell|first=John|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania3.html|title=Steamboat \u2013 Savage rule WrestleMania 3|accessdate=October 14, 2007|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling}}</ref> McMahon used the success of WrestleMania to create more pay-per-views and traditions such as [[SummerSlam]], the [[Royal Rumble]] and the [[Survivor Series]], the latter two both receiving their names from unique stipulation matches featured at the event.\n\nMcMahon's focus on entertainment rather than giving his product a legitimate sports feel, the policy that became the concept of [[sports entertainment]], led to great financial success for WWF.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} During the 1980s, Hulk Hogan would crossover into mainstream prominence presented as an all-American hero.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Hogan's time as the face of the WWF would last until he departed from the company in the summer of 1993. Other stars such as [[Randy Savage|\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]], [[Roddy Piper|\"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper]], [[The Ultimate Warrior]], [[The Honky Tonk Man]], [[Ted DiBiase|\"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]], and others also helped make WWF a financial success in this time period.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Jim Duggan]] won the first ever [[Royal Rumble (1988)|Royal Rumble]] match in 1988.

Rising stars included [[D-Generation X]] group (consisting of [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Triple H]], [[Rick Rude]], [[X-Pac]], [[Road Dogg]], [[Billy Gunn]] and [[Chyna]]) and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], whose rise to popularity began with his [[King of the Ring (1996)|1996 King of the Ring]] win and famous \"Austin 3:16\" speech. Despite starting out as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]], Austin's popularity would start to gradually exceed those of the top [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorites]] in the promotion.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} At [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]] on November 9, 1997, WWF debuted the \"scratch\" logo which would be the company's signature throughout the Attitude Era and on December 15, 1997, Vince McMahon aired a promo on ''Raw Is War'' addressing the audience on the company embarking on a \"more innovative and contemporary campaign\", which would advise parent discretion for a younger audience. This same episode also marked the beginning of the scratch logo being officially used for WWF television broadcasts and went into full effect, replacing the New Generation logo.\n\nIn 1997, McMahon also informed Bret Hart that he could not longer afford to pay him what his contract stated, and suggested that he go back to the more lucrative deal that WCW had offered him.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Hart signed with WCW but a behind-the-scenes controversy developed over Hart's final matches, resulting in the [[Montreal Screwjob]]. Hart was defending the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Shawn Michaels at 1997 Survivor Series, when McMahon ordered the referee to award the match and the championship to Michaels as if Hart had submitted.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} While Hart went on to WCW, McMahon received enormous backlash from the media, wrestlers and fans alike, inspiring him to create the Mr. McMahon character, a villainous extension of his status as promoter.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nFollowing Hart's departure the company implemented a heavy push of popular anti hero character, Stone Cold Steve Austin whose popularity was rising and was similar to [[Hulk Hogan]]'s popularity in the 1980s. During an angle involving [[Mike Tyson]] at [[WrestleMania XIV]] in March 1998, Austin became WWF Champion by beating Shawn Michaels, giving rise to the Austin era and the despotic Mr. McMahon character which began a long-lasting feud with Austin this feud would be very important in the WWF turning the tides in the ratings war with rival company WCW. Later in the year, new talent began to emerge for WWF: [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], Triple H, [[Mick Foley]], and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] strengthened WWF's singles division while stables such as D-Generation X and the [[Nation of Domination]], helped the fight against rival company WCW.\n\n[[File:Austin with WWF title.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] is often called one of the most popular stars in WWE history]]\nWWF rebounded in its ratings and popularity, with ''Raw Is War'' finally beating ''Nitro'' for the first time in 84 weeks on April 13, 1998.

For the first time since the Monday Night Wars, WWF's purchase of WCW had made a major American inter-promotional feud possible, but the Invasion turned out to be a disappointment to many fans. One main reason would be that many of WCW's big name stars were still under contract to WCW's old parent company, [[Time Warner|AOL Time Warner]], rather than WCW itself, and their contracts were not included in the purchase of the company. These wrestlers chose to sit out the duration of their contracts and be [[employment|financially supported]] by AOL Time Warner rather than work for WWF for a cheaper salary.\n\nOn July 9, 2001, the stars of WCW and [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (acquired by [[Stephanie McMahon]] in a related storyline) joined forces, forming \"[[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]]\" with WCW owner Shane McMahon and the new owner of ECW Stephanie McMahon leading charge, with the support and influence of original ECW owner [[Paul Heyman]].

In the aftermath of the Invasion angle, WWF made several major changes to their product. [[Ric Flair]] returned to the WWF as \"co-owner\" of the company, feuding with Vince McMahon. [[Jerry Lawler]] returned to the company after a nine-month hiatus, after his replacement on commentary [[Paul Heyman]] was fired on-screen by Vince McMahon. Several former Alliance stars were absorbed into the regular WWF roster, such as [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]], [[Lance Storm]], and [[Rob Van Dam]]. At [[Vengeance 2001]], [[Chris Jericho]] went on to unify the [[WCW Championship]] and [[WWF Championship]], beating both The Rock and Steve Austin on the same night.<ref>[https://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Torch_Flashbacks_19/article_45922.shtml#.WlsKGq6WbZ4 \"PWTorch.com \u2013 TORCH FLASHBACK (12-09-01): Chris Jericho becomes WWE Undisputed champion \u2013 Torch cover story with parallels to The Miz as WWE champion, Vengeance 2001 PPV Report\"].

However, the storyline proved unpopular with fans and Hogan soon turned face at [[WrestleMania X8]] after his classic match with The Rock, which The Rock won. On the edition of March 25, 2002 of Raw, the World Wrestling Federation had the first time ever [[2002 WWF draft lottery|WWF draft lottery]], which meant the WWF superstars are separated between two brands, Raw and SmackDown!.

This problem was solved by introducing a \"Brand Extension\", with the roster split in half and the talent assigned to either ''Raw'' or ''SmackDown!'' in a mock draft lottery. Wrestlers, commentators and referees became show-exclusive, and the shows were given separate on-screen General Managers. The brand extension came into effect on April 1, 2002.

Triple H would also be featured prominently during this time, winning several of his fourteen [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world championships]], as would [[The Undertaker]] whose WrestleMania win streak started gaining fame.

At [[WrestleMania 21]], he won his first world championship when he defeated John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield the WWE Champion at that time.

Cena's popularity has led to him becoming the all-time record \"wish maker\" for the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]], granting over 500 wishes as of August 2017.<ref name=\"CenaMAW\">{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/trending-now/john-cena-grants-400th-request-for--make-a-wish--192554702.html|title=John Cena Grants 400th Request for 'Make-a-Wish'|date=February 12, 2014|accessdate=April 19, 2014|publisher=Yahoo}}</ref> Cena secured victories over veterans Triple H and Shawn Michaels in the main events of [[WrestleMania 22]] and [[WrestleMania 23]] respectively. A popular wrestler during the period was [[Bobby Lashley]] from the [[ECW brand]]. Cena would defeat Lashley at [[The Great American Bash (2007)|The Great American Bash]] in 2007 in a well received match, shortly after which Lashley left the WWE.

After returning and eventually winning another world championship, at [[WrestleMania 23]] in 2007, Batista would defend the title to The Undertaker in a classic encounter, though he lost the match. However Batista defeated The Undertaker at [[Cyber Sunday (2007)|Cyber Sunday]].

Dubbed the legend killer he would go on to have feuds with legendary superstars such as The Undertaker and Hulk Hogan facing them at [[WrestleMania 21]] and the 2006 [[SummerSlam (2006)|SummerSlam]] event respectively. Along with fellow Superstar Edge he would form the villainous tag team [[Rated-RKO]], and find success in the tag team division. After returning to singles competition Orton became a multi times [[WWE championship|WWE Champion]]. At the 2007 [[No Mercy (2007)|No Mercy]] event Orton initially lost the WWE Championship to Triple H at the opening match, but won it back later in a highly acclaimed [[Last Man Standing match]] against Triple H which was the main event match of the same event.

Under the WWE banner, ECW was presented in a modernized style to that when it was an independent promotion and was produced following the same format of the other brands, with match rules, such as [[Countout|count outs]] and [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualifications]], being standard. Matches featuring the rule set of the ECW promotion were classified as being contested under \"[[Hardcore wrestling|Extreme Rules]]\" and were only fought when specified otherwise.<ref name=\"SciFi\"/> The brand would continue to operate until February 16, 2010, when the brand was rendered defunct.\n\n=== PG Era (2008\u20132013) ===\n\nIn the Summer of 2008, WWE began distancing itself from the edgier content of years past, going with a more conservative approach. On July 22, 2008 all WWE programming transitioned to a PG television rating, with the 2008 [[SummerSlam (2008)|SummerSlam]] event being the first pay per view held under PG ratings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/industrynews/7706710|title=WWE goes PG|date=July 22, 2008|accessdate=September 12, 2016|publisher=[[WWE]]|archivedate=September 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901161859/http://www.wwe.com/inside/industrynews/7706710}}</ref> While fans would dub this the \"PG Era\" early on, references from wrestlers themselves would come later such as [[Triple H]] in his \"Thy Kingdom Come\" documentary and [[Natalya]] on an episode of \"Table for 3\". Another most notable example was that [[John Cena]]'s famous finishing move, the ''F-U'' was renamed ''Attitude Adjustment''. Intentionally [[Blading (professional wrestling)|blading]], which was common until then, became forbidden in the WWE. John Cena remained the top star of the company during this era. In 2009, WWE debuted a Raw guest host concept, initially with [[Donald Trump]] (in storyline a one-night only [[kayfabe]] owner of Raw), in which various celebrities, athletes or past wrestlers made weekly appearances and were incorporated to the shows and stories until 2010. On January 4, 2010, [[Bret Hart]] returned to a WWE ring after a thirteen-year absence, where he reconciled with [[Shawn Michaels]] on screen.  Also in 2010, Bret Hart served briefly as the Raw general manager before being replaced by the [[Anonymous Raw General Manager]]. John Cena had a long-standing feud with Randy Orton during this period which included an [[\"I quit\" match]] at the 2009 [[WWE Breaking Point|Breaking Point]] event which Cena won.<ref>http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwebreakingpoint/2009</ref> Also in 2009 [[D-Generation X]] reunited and would win the unified WWE tag team titles from [[Jeri-Show|Chris Jericho and The Big Show]] in a [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2009)|Tables, Ladders and Chairs match]]. In early 2011, [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] returned to WWE and teamed with John Cena to defeat the team of [[The Miz]] and [[R-Truth]] at the 2011 [[Survivor Series (2011)|Survivor Series]] event. The Rock had started a cross-generational feud with [[John Cena]], which saw him defeating Cena in a match at [[WrestleMania XXVIII]] in 2012.\n\n[[File:Rock and Cena shake hands.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[John Cena]] (left) and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] (right) in the April 04, 2011 episode of Raw, they had an on and off cross-generational feud between 2011\u20132013.]]\n\n[[File:CM Punk RAW 800.jpg|thumb|left|[[CM Punk]] became one of the most popular and high-profile wrestler in the WWE during this period, and holds a record 434 days long [[WWE Championship]] reign, the longest reign of the title in the company in 25 years.]]\n\nAt [[WrestleMania XXVI]] in 2010, Shawn Michaels retired following a loss to [[The Undertaker]]. Another top performer [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] also retired in the next year.

Their match at [[Money in the Bank (2011)|Money in the Bank]] on July 17, 2011 was named one of the greatest matches in WWE history. Punk, who had become a top star during the summer of 2011 due to his infamous \"Pipe bomb\" promo, would hold the [[WWE Championship]] for 434 days before losing to The Rock in 2013 at the [[Royal Rumble (2013)|2013 Royal Rumble]], a reign recognized by WWE as the sixth-[[List of WWE Champions|longest championship reign]] of all-time and the longest in 25 years.<ref name=\"wwetitle\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship|title=WWE Championship title history|accessdate=February 5, 2012|publisher=WWE}}</ref> The Rock defended the championship until he was defeated by John Cena at [[WrestleMania 29]] in a rematch from their bout the previous year.\n\nJohn Cena would later drop the WWE Championship to [[Daniel Bryan]] at [[SummerSlam (2013)|SummerSlam]], immediately after which it started [[The Authority (professional wrestling)|The Authority]] storyline that saw underdog Bryan feuding with WWE COO [[Triple H]], his prodigy [[Randy Orton]] and other members of The Authority.<ref>[https://www.wwe.com/inside/top-25-matches-of-the-year \"WWE.com's Top 25 matches of 2013\"].

In the case of the \"Championship Ascension Ceremony\", the fan's continuing \"Yes!\" chants would force John Cena to go off-script and acknowledge Bryan (especially since the show was held in Seattle), since that segment was supposed to be about Cena and Randy Orton's impending [[championship unification]] match at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2013)|TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs]].<ref name=\"Michael\">{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/did-michigan-state-university-change-course-wwe-history-154200564--spt.html|title=Did Michigan State University Change the Course of WWE History|first=Patrick|last=Michael|publisher=Yahoo!

WWE canceled the scheduled three-hour-long live Raw show on June 25 (which, coincidentally, was supposed to be a scripted memorial for the Mr. McMahon character), and replaced the broadcast version with a tribute to his life and career, featuring past matches, segments from the [[Chris Benoit|Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story DVD]], and comments from wrestlers and announcers from the Raw, SmackDown! and the now-defunct ECW brands. Shortly after the program aired, many of the aired comments were posted on WWE.com.

Other significant wrestlers who were part of the roster included: [[Big John Studd]], [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]], [[Jimmy Snuka|Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka]], [[Don Muraco|\"The Magnificent\" Don Muraco]], [[Junkyard Dog]], [[Paul Orndorff|\"Mr. Wonderful\" Paul Orndorff]], [[Greg Valentine|Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine]], [[Ricky Steamboat|Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat]], and [[Nikolai Volkoff]]. In 1984, Hogan was [[push (professional wrestling)|pushed]] to main event status. He defeated WWF Heavyweight Champion [[The Iron Sheik]] at Madison Square Garden on January 23, 1984 and thus evolved into one of the most recognizable and popular faces in professional wrestling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/hulk-hogan-beats-iron-sheik-to-win-first-wwf-title|title=Hulk Hogan beats Iron Sheik to win first WWF title|last=Editors|first=History com|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=December 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hulk Hogan And Brutus Beefcake.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Hulk Hogan And Brutus Beefcake|[[Hulk Hogan]] (left), [[Sergeant Slaughter]] (centre) and [[Brutus Beefcake]] (right) were mainstays of 1980's WWF wrestling]]\nWith reasonable revenue being made, McMahon was able to secure television deals, and WWF was being shown across the United States.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} McMahon also began selling [[videotape]]s of WWF events outside the Northeast through his [[WWE Home Video|Coliseum Video]] distribution company, again angering other promoters.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The syndication of WWF programming forced promotions to engage in direct competition with the WWF.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The increased revenue allowed McMahon to sign more talent, such as [[Brutus Beefcake]], [[Tito Santana]], [[Jake Roberts|Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts]], [[Butch Reed]], and [[Jim Duggan|\"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan]].\n\nHowever, for McMahon to truly turn WWF into a national promotion, he needed to have WWF touring the entire United States.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Such a venture was impossible with the revenue WWF currently had, so McMahon envisioned a way to obtain the necessary capital through a risky all-or-nothing gamble on a [[supercard]] concept called [[WrestleMania]] in 1985. WrestleMania would be a [[pay-per-view]] extravaganza, viewable on [[closed-circuit television]] and marketed as the [[Super Bowl]] of professional wrestling. WrestleMania was not the first supercard seen in professional wrestling, as the NWA had previously run [[Starrcade]] in 1983. However, McMahon's vision was to make WWF and the industry itself mainstream, targeting more of the general television audience by exploiting the entertainment side of the industry. With the inaugural WrestleMania, WWF initiated a joint-promotional campaign with [[MTV]], which featured a great deal of WWF coverage and programming, in what was termed the ''[[1980s professional wrestling boom|Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]]''. The mainstream media attention brought on by [[Celebrity|celebrities]] including [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Mr. T]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]] at the event helped propel WrestleMania to become a staple in popular culture, and the use of celebrities has been a staple of the company to the present day.\n\nWith the success of WrestleMania, other promotions which tried hard to keep the regional territory system alive started to merge under [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP).{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Starrcade]] and [[The Great American Bash]] were the JCP versions of [[WrestleMania]], but even when operating inside of its territory, JCP had trouble matching the success of WWF.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} After [[Ted Turner]] purchased majority of JCP's assets, the promotion would become [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), providing WWF with a competitor until 2001, when WCW and its trademarks were purchased by WWF.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} WrestleMania would become an annual pay-per-view phenomenon, being broadcast in nearly 150 countries and in almost 20 different languages.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nPerhaps the peak of the 1980s wrestling boom was [[WrestleMania III]] at the [[Silverdome|Pontiac Silverdome]],{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} which set an attendance record of 93,173. In the main event [[Hulk Hogan]] retained the WWF Championship against [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Powell|first=John|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania3.html|title=Steamboat \u2013 Savage rule WrestleMania 3|accessdate=October 14, 2007|publisher=SLAM!

Other stars such as [[Randy Savage|\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]], [[Roddy Piper|\"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper]], [[The Ultimate Warrior]], [[The Honky Tonk Man]], [[Ted DiBiase|\"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]], and others also helped make WWF a financial success in this time period.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Jim Duggan]] won the first ever [[Royal Rumble (1988)|Royal Rumble]] match in 1988. While these talents were recognizable as individuals, some talent became better known for their teamwork as part of tag teams. Stables or groups such as [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]], [[Strike Force (professional wrestling)|Strike Force]], [[The Hart Foundation]], [[The British Bulldogs]], [[The Rockers]] and [[The Fabulous Rougeaus]] helped create a strong tag team division for WWF.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Towards the end of the \"Golden Age\", [[Bret Hart]] of the Hart Foundation began to break out on his own as a singles competitor, with his most memorable match early on taking place at [[SummerSlam (1992)|SummerSlam]] in 1992 against [[Davey Boy Smith|\"The British Bulldog\" Davey Boy Smith]]. Hart would eventually capture the [[WWF Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] from Ric Flair later that year and would win the [[King of the Ring]] tournament the following year.\n\nIn January 1993, WWF created their prime time cable TV program ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', which aired on the [[USA Network]].\n\n=== New Generation Era (1992\u20131997) ===\n[[File:Wwf logo 1994-1997.jpg|thumb|Logo and tagline used for the New Generation Era from 1995\u20131997]] \n[[File:WWF Champion Bret Hart in jacket.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bret Hart]] was by far the biggest star at this point and defeated [[Yokozuna]] to win back the [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] in the main event of [[WrestleMania 10]].]]\nIn 1991, it was reported that [[Hulk Hogan]], [[Roddy Piper]], [[Rick Martel]], [[Brian Blair]], and [[Dan Spivey]] were to testify that they had purchased steroids from WWF physician Dr. George T.

In 1994, WCW signed Hulk Hogan and other former WWF stars to multi-year contracts, and in 1995 launched ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'' on [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]], to go head to head with ''Raw'', starting the [[Monday Night Wars]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Eric Bischoff Disputes That He Wanted To Put WWE Out Of Business ... |url=https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2018/12/eric-bischoff-disputes-that-he-wanted-to-put-wwe-out-of-648871/ |website=Wrestling Inc. |publisher=Wrestling Inc. |accessdate=December 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy mid-1996, with the introduction of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo), a stable led by former WWF wrestlers Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall (Razor Ramon), and Kevin Nash (Diesel), ''Nitro'' started a near two years of ratings domination.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} More talent would eventually leave WWF for WCW including [[Ted DiBiase]], [[Curt Hennig]], reigning [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's Champion]] [[Alundra Blayze]] and The 1-2-3 Kid while Bret Hart decided to stay with the WWF in spite of a lucrative offer by WCW.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} At [[Badd Blood: In Your House]] in 1997 the first [[Hell in a Cell]] match would be held between [[The Undertaker]] and [[Shawn Michaels]], which Michaels won after interference from Undertaker's storyline half brother [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]].

Rising stars included [[D-Generation X]] group (consisting of [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Triple H]], [[Rick Rude]], [[X-Pac]], [[Road Dogg]], [[Billy Gunn]] and [[Chyna]]) and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], whose rise to popularity began with his [[King of the Ring (1996)|1996 King of the Ring]] win and famous \"Austin 3:16\" speech. Despite starting out as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]], Austin's popularity would start to gradually exceed those of the top [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorites]] in the promotion.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} At [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]] on November 9, 1997, WWF debuted the \"scratch\" logo which would be the company's signature throughout the Attitude Era and on December 15, 1997, Vince McMahon aired a promo on ''Raw Is War'' addressing the audience on the company embarking on a \"more innovative and contemporary campaign\", which would advise parent discretion for a younger audience. This same episode also marked the beginning of the scratch logo being officially used for WWF television broadcasts and went into full effect, replacing the New Generation logo.\n\nIn 1997, McMahon also informed Bret Hart that he could not longer afford to pay him what his contract stated, and suggested that he go back to the more lucrative deal that WCW had offered him.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Hart signed with WCW but a behind-the-scenes controversy developed over Hart's final matches, resulting in the [[Montreal Screwjob]]. Hart was defending the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Shawn Michaels at 1997 Survivor Series, when McMahon ordered the referee to award the match and the championship to Michaels as if Hart had submitted.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} While Hart went on to WCW, McMahon received enormous backlash from the media, wrestlers and fans alike, inspiring him to create the Mr. McMahon character, a villainous extension of his status as promoter.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nFollowing Hart's departure the company implemented a heavy push of popular anti hero character, Stone Cold Steve Austin whose popularity was rising and was similar to [[Hulk Hogan]]'s popularity in the 1980s. During an angle involving [[Mike Tyson]] at [[WrestleMania XIV]] in March 1998, Austin became WWF Champion by beating Shawn Michaels, giving rise to the Austin era and the despotic Mr. McMahon character which began a long-lasting feud with Austin this feud would be very important in the WWF turning the tides in the ratings war with rival company WCW. Later in the year, new talent began to emerge for WWF: [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], Triple H, [[Mick Foley]], and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] strengthened WWF's singles division while stables such as D-Generation X and the [[Nation of Domination]], helped the fight against rival company WCW.\n\n[[File:Austin with WWF title.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] is often called one of the most popular stars in WWE history]]\nWWF rebounded in its ratings and popularity, with ''Raw Is War'' finally beating ''Nitro'' for the first time in 84 weeks on April 13, 1998.

For the first time since the Monday Night Wars, WWF's purchase of WCW had made a major American inter-promotional feud possible, but the Invasion turned out to be a disappointment to many fans. One main reason would be that many of WCW's big name stars were still under contract to WCW's old parent company, [[Time Warner|AOL Time Warner]], rather than WCW itself, and their contracts were not included in the purchase of the company. These wrestlers chose to sit out the duration of their contracts and be [[employment|financially supported]] by AOL Time Warner rather than work for WWF for a cheaper salary.\n\nOn July 9, 2001, the stars of WCW and [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (acquired by [[Stephanie McMahon]] in a related storyline) joined forces, forming \"[[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]]\" with WCW owner Shane McMahon and the new owner of ECW Stephanie McMahon leading charge, with the support and influence of original ECW owner [[Paul Heyman]].

[[Jerry Lawler]] returned to the company after a nine-month hiatus, after his replacement on commentary [[Paul Heyman]] was fired on-screen by Vince McMahon. Several former Alliance stars were absorbed into the regular WWF roster, such as [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]], [[Lance Storm]], and [[Rob Van Dam]].

Triple H would also be featured prominently during this time, winning several of his fourteen [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world championships]], as would [[The Undertaker]] whose WrestleMania win streak started gaining fame. [[Eddie Guerrero]], [[Rey Mysterio]], [[Kurt Angle]], [[Chris Benoit]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], [[Brock Lesnar]], [[Randy Orton]], [[John Cena]], [[Dave Bautista|Batista]], [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]], and [[Rob Van Dam]] were also given main event opportunities and all ended up becoming multiple-time world champions. From mid 2002 to 2003, WWE brought several prominent WCW stars to the company, including [[Eric Bischoff]], [[Scott Steiner]], [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]], [[Kevin Nash]] and [[Ric Flair]]. [[The Great American Bash]], originally a WCW pay-per-view event, made its debut in WWE.\n\nIn August 2002, [[Shawn Michaels]] would also return as a wrestler at [[SummerSlam (2002)|SummerSlam]] after a hiatus of over four years. He would achieve great success, and won a World Championship in the first ever [[Elimination Chamber]] match at [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]]. The match between Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle at [[WrestleMania 21]] has been named one of the greatest matches in WWE history. Though Angle won the match, Michaels received praise for his \"courageous effort\".<ref>https://www.wwe.com/videos/shawn-michaels-vs-kurt-angle-wrestlemania-21-april-3-2005</ref> In 2006, Michaels would reunite with Triple H to once again form the popular 1990s group [[D-Generation X]]. They would have major feuds with [[The Spirit Squad]], the McMahon family, and the newly established [[Rated-RKO]] (Edge and Randy Orton), which ended prematurely when Triple H suffered a torn quadriceps muscle in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|last=Plummer|first=Dale|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2007/01/08/3235732.html|title=Cena retains, Triple H injured at Revolution|date=January 8, 2007|accessdate=April 4, 2008|work=Slam!

He has since won 14 world championships.]]\n\n[[Eddie Guerrero]] from the famous Mexican [[Guerrero wrestling family]] achieved huge stardom during this period. He gained a large fanbase in 2003 on ''SmackDown!'', which lead to a rapid increase in his popularity, promoting him to main event status and he ultimately won his first world championship, the WWE Championship at [[No Way Out (2004)|No Way Out]] in 2004 defeating [[Brock Lesnar]] in a highly acclaimed match. He remained the top wrestler of the company after winning the WWE title, until his untimely [[Eddie Guerrero#Death|death]] on November 13, 2005. He was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]], the following year in 2006. Guerrero's death due to his drug addictions caused WWE to implement [[WWE Wellness Policy]] to prevent wrestlers from taking drugs. The circumstances of his death would provide a medium to his off-screen friend Rey Mysterio to emerge as a major main eventer and win the [[Royal Rumble (2006)|2006 Royal Rumble match]] and the World Heavyweight Championship at [[WrestleMania 22]].\n\nHowever the biggest breakout star of the Ruthless Aggression era would be [[John Cena]]. Upon his debut, Cena quickly proved popular due to his \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" white rapper gimmick on the SmackDown brand, receiving a WWE Championship match against Brock Lesnar in the spring at [[Backlash (2003)|Backlash]] in 2003, and had a major feud with [[The Undertaker]] during the summer. At [[WrestleMania 21]], he won his first world championship when he defeated John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield the WWE Champion at that time. Cena's popularity soared when he was drafted to Raw, where he quickly became the face of WWE, a rise not seen since Austin and [[Hulk Hogan]]. Cena's popularity has led to him becoming the all-time record \"wish maker\" for the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]], granting over 500 wishes as of August 2017.<ref name=\"CenaMAW\">{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/trending-now/john-cena-grants-400th-request-for--make-a-wish--192554702.html|title=John Cena Grants 400th Request for 'Make-a-Wish'|date=February 12, 2014|accessdate=April 19, 2014|publisher=Yahoo}}</ref> Cena secured victories over veterans Triple H and Shawn Michaels in the main events of [[WrestleMania 22]] and [[WrestleMania 23]] respectively. A popular wrestler during the period was [[Bobby Lashley]] from the [[ECW brand]]. Cena would defeat Lashley at [[The Great American Bash (2007)|The Great American Bash]] in 2007 in a well received match, shortly after which Lashley left the WWE. After being sidelined due to a shoulder injury for the latter half of 2007, Cena returned in the 2008 [[Royal Rumble (2008)|Royal Rumble]] match, winning the match.\n\n[[File:Johncenainring.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=John Cena|[[John Cena]] was by far the biggest star to emerge during the Ruthless Aggression Era.]]\n\nBeginning in early 2005 the popularity of [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] would soar much like Cena's, winning the [[Royal Rumble (2005)|2005 Royal Rumble]] and the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 21 from Triple H. Later in 2005 Batista would go on to defeat Triple H in a highly acclaimed Hell in a Cell match at [[Vengeance (2005)|Vengeance]].<ref>[https://www.wwe.com/shows/vengeance/2005 \"Vengeance 2005\"]. ''WWE''.</ref> Although Batista would have major success in the months following his championship win, he would suffer an injury in early 2006 and miss that year's WrestleMania. After returning and eventually winning another world championship, at [[WrestleMania 23]] in 2007, Batista would defend the title to The Undertaker in a classic encounter, though he lost the match. However Batista defeated The Undertaker at [[Cyber Sunday (2007)|Cyber Sunday]]. Cena and Batista would not face each other for the first time until [[SummerSlam (2008)|SummerSlam]] in 2008, with Batista winning.\n\n[[File:Orton WWE Champion.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Randy Orton as [[WWE Championship|WWE Champion]] in 2007.]]\n\n[[Randy Orton]] became a prominent Superstar during this period becoming the youngest world champion in WWE history at the age of 24, defeating Chris Benoit at the 2004 [[SummerSlam (2004)|SummerSlam]] event. Dubbed the legend killer he would go on to have feuds with legendary superstars such as The Undertaker and Hulk Hogan facing them at [[WrestleMania 21]] and the 2006 [[SummerSlam (2006)|SummerSlam]] event respectively. Along with fellow Superstar Edge he would form the villainous tag team [[Rated-RKO]], and find success in the tag team division. After returning to singles competition Orton became a multi times [[WWE championship|WWE Champion]]. At the 2007 [[No Mercy (2007)|No Mercy]] event Orton initially lost the WWE Championship to Triple H at the opening match, but won it back later in a highly acclaimed [[Last Man Standing match]] against Triple H which was the main event match of the same event. Orton would  suffer a shoulder injury following a motorbike accident but eventually recovered and continued to wrestle.<ref>http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2007/10/08/4559065.html</ref>\n\nRising star [[CM Punk]] made his WWE debut in 2006, wrestling his first main roster match at [[Survivor Series (2006)|Survivor Series]] that year, in a 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination match as part of [[D-Generation X|Team DX]] in a clean sweep victory over [[Rated-RKO|Team Rated-RKO]]. In 2008 he won the [[Money in the Bank ladder match|money in the bank]] brief case and on the June 30 episode of Raw he cashed it on the then [[World Heavyweight Champion]] Edge, winning the title.

Under the WWE banner, ECW was presented in a modernized style to that when it was an independent promotion and was produced following the same format of the other brands, with match rules, such as [[Countout|count outs]] and [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualifications]], being standard. Matches featuring the rule set of the ECW promotion were classified as being contested under \"[[Hardcore wrestling|Extreme Rules]]\" and were only fought when specified otherwise.<ref name=\"SciFi\"/> The brand would continue to operate until February 16, 2010, when the brand was rendered defunct.\n\n=== PG Era (2008\u20132013) ===\n\nIn the Summer of 2008, WWE began distancing itself from the edgier content of years past, going with a more conservative approach. On July 22, 2008 all WWE programming transitioned to a PG television rating, with the 2008 [[SummerSlam (2008)|SummerSlam]] event being the first pay per view held under PG ratings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/industrynews/7706710|title=WWE goes PG|date=July 22, 2008|accessdate=September 12, 2016|publisher=[[WWE]]|archivedate=September 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901161859/http://www.wwe.com/inside/industrynews/7706710}}</ref> While fans would dub this the \"PG Era\" early on, references from wrestlers themselves would come later such as [[Triple H]] in his \"Thy Kingdom Come\" documentary and [[Natalya]] on an episode of \"Table for 3\". Another most notable example was that [[John Cena]]'s famous finishing move, the ''F-U'' was renamed ''Attitude Adjustment''. Intentionally [[Blading (professional wrestling)|blading]], which was common until then, became forbidden in the WWE. John Cena remained the top star of the company during this era. In 2009, WWE debuted a Raw guest host concept, initially with [[Donald Trump]] (in storyline a one-night only [[kayfabe]] owner of Raw), in which various celebrities, athletes or past wrestlers made weekly appearances and were incorporated to the shows and stories until 2010. On January 4, 2010, [[Bret Hart]] returned to a WWE ring after a thirteen-year absence, where he reconciled with [[Shawn Michaels]] on screen.  Also in 2010, Bret Hart served briefly as the Raw general manager before being replaced by the [[Anonymous Raw General Manager]]. John Cena had a long-standing feud with Randy Orton during this period which included an [[\"I quit\" match]] at the 2009 [[WWE Breaking Point|Breaking Point]] event which Cena won.<ref>http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwebreakingpoint/2009</ref> Also in 2009 [[D-Generation X]] reunited and would win the unified WWE tag team titles from [[Jeri-Show|Chris Jericho and The Big Show]] in a [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2009)|Tables, Ladders and Chairs match]]. In early 2011, [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] returned to WWE and teamed with John Cena to defeat the team of [[The Miz]] and [[R-Truth]] at the 2011 [[Survivor Series (2011)|Survivor Series]] event. The Rock had started a cross-generational feud with [[John Cena]], which saw him defeating Cena in a match at [[WrestleMania XXVIII]] in 2012.\n\n[[File:Rock and Cena shake hands.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[John Cena]] (left) and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] (right) in the April 04, 2011 episode of Raw, they had an on and off cross-generational feud between 2011\u20132013.]]\n\n[[File:CM Punk RAW 800.jpg|thumb|left|[[CM Punk]] became one of the most popular and high-profile wrestler in the WWE during this period, and holds a record 434 days long [[WWE Championship]] reign, the longest reign of the title in the company in 25 years.]]\n\nAt [[WrestleMania XXVI]] in 2010, Shawn Michaels retired following a loss to [[The Undertaker]]. Another top performer [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] also retired in the next year.

Punk, who had become a top star during the summer of 2011 due to his infamous \"Pipe bomb\" promo, would hold the [[WWE Championship]] for 434 days before losing to The Rock in 2013 at the [[Royal Rumble (2013)|2013 Royal Rumble]], a reign recognized by WWE as the sixth-[[List of WWE Champions|longest championship reign]] of all-time and the longest in 25 years.<ref name=\"wwetitle\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship|title=WWE Championship title history|accessdate=February 5, 2012|publisher=WWE}}</ref> The Rock defended the championship until he was defeated by John Cena at [[WrestleMania 29]] in a rematch from their bout the previous year.\n\nJohn Cena would later drop the WWE Championship to [[Daniel Bryan]] at [[SummerSlam (2013)|SummerSlam]], immediately after which it started [[The Authority (professional wrestling)|The Authority]] storyline that saw underdog Bryan feuding with WWE COO [[Triple H]], his prodigy [[Randy Orton]] and other members of The Authority.<ref>[https://www.wwe.com/inside/top-25-matches-of-the-year \"WWE.com's Top 25 matches of 2013\"].

In the case of the \"Championship Ascension Ceremony\", the fan's continuing \"Yes!\" chants would force John Cena to go off-script and acknowledge Bryan (especially since the show was held in Seattle), since that segment was supposed to be about Cena and Randy Orton's impending [[championship unification]] match at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2013)|TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs]].<ref name=\"Michael\">{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/did-michigan-state-university-change-course-wwe-history-154200564--spt.html|title=Did Michigan State University Change the Course of WWE History|first=Patrick|last=Michael|publisher=Yahoo!

Shortly after the program aired, many of the aired comments were posted on WWE.com.

Hindus traditionally lit bonfires in their yards after the weeks of the ''rabi'' season cropping work, socialized around the fire, sang and danced together as they marked the end of winter and the onset of longer days. After the night of bonfire celebrations, Hindus would mark Makar Sankranti and go to a sacred water body such as a river or lake to bathe.<ref>{{cite book|author1=J.

The idea is for the selected person to act as a deterrent for people who refrain from giving Lohri items. The boys will sing Lohri songs asking for Lohri items. If not enough is given, the householder will be given an ultimatum to either give more or the rope will be loosened. If not enough is given, then the boy who has his face smeared will try to enter the house and smash clay pots or the clay stove.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==Practices==\nDuring the day, children go from door to door singing folk songs.

Lohri is then distributed at night during the festival. Till, peanuts, popcorn and other food items are also thrown into the fire. For some, throwing food into the fire represents the burning of the old year and start the next year on [[Makar Sankranti]]\n\nThe bonfire ceremony differs depending on the location in Punjab. In some parts, a small image of the folk Lohri goddess is made with gobar (cattle dung) decorating it, kindling a fire beneath it and chanting its praises. The folk Lohri goddess is believed to be an ancient aspect of the celebration,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> and is part of a long tradition of [[Winter solstice]] celebrations manifesting as a god or goddess.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paganwiccan.about.com/od/yulethelongestnight/a/Winter_Sol_Gods.htm|title=Who Are the Deities of the Winter Solstice?|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>  In other parts, the Lohri fire consists of cow dung and wood with no reference to the Lohri goddess.\n\nThe bonfire is lit at sunset in the main village square. People toss sesame seeds, gur, sugar-candy and ''rewaries'' on the bonfire, sit around it, sing and dance till the fire dies out. Some people perform a prayer and go around the fire. This is to show respect to the natural element of fire,<ref>[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/47133/bringing-home-sun-god.html] FirozBakht Ahmed Deccan Herald 18/01/2010</ref> a tradition common in [[winter solstice]] celebrations. It is traditional to offer guests til, gachchak, gur, moongphali (peanuts) and phuliya or popcorn. Milk and water is also poured around the bonfire by [[Hindus]] to thank the Sun God and seeking his continued protection.\n\nAmong some sections of the [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] community, the festival is traditionally celebrated as  [[Lal Loi]].

Punjabis usually have private Lohri celebrations, in their houses. Lohri rituals are performed, with the accompaniment of special Lohri songs.\n\nSinging and dancing form an intrinsic part of the celebrations. People wear their brightest clothes and come to dance the [[Bhangra (dance)|bhangra]] and [[gidda]] to the beat of the [[dhol]]. Punjabi songs are sung, and everybody rejoices. Sarson da saag and makki di roti is usually served as the main course at a Lohri dinner. Lohri is a great occasion that holds great importance for farmers. However, people residing in urban areas also celebrate Lohri, as this festival provides the opportunity to interact with family and friends.\n\n==Lohri songs==\nThere are many Lohri songs. For example, the following song which has words to express gratitude to Dulla Bhatti (the 'ho's are in chorus):<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.lohrifestival.org/lohri-boys-songs.html | title = Dhulla Bhatti Song}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nSunder mundriye ho!<br>\nTera kaun vicharaa ho!<br>\nDullah Bhatti walla ho!<br>\nDullhe di dhee vyayae ho!<br>\nSer shakkar payee ho!<br>\nKudi da laal pathaka ho!<br>\nKudi da saalu paata ho!<br>\nSalu kaun samete!<br>\nChacha gali dese!<br>\nChache choori kutti! zamidara lutti!<br>\nZamindaar sudhaye!<br>\nBum Bum bhole aaye!<br>\nEk bhola reh gaya!<br>\nSipahee far ke lai gaya!<br>\nSipahee ne mari itt!<br>\nBhaanvey ro te bhaanvey pitt!<br>\nSanoo de de Lohri, te teri jeeve jodi!<br>\n(Laugh, cry or howl!)<br>\n</blockquote>\n\n'''Translation'''\n\n<blockquote>\nBeautiful girl<br>\nWho will think about you<br>\nDulla of the Bhatti clan will<br>\nDulla's daughter got married<br>\nHe gave one [[Ser (unit)|ser]] of sugar!<br>\nThe girl is wearing a red suit!<br>\nBut her shawl is torn!<br>\nWho will stitch her shawl?!<br>\nThe uncle made choori!<br>\nThe landlords looted it!<br>\nLandlords are beaten up!<br>\nLots of simple-headed boys came!<br>\nOne simpleton got left behind!<br>\nThe soldier arrested him!<br>\nThe soldier hit him with a brick!<br>\n(Cry or howl)!<br>\nGive us Lohri, long live your pair (to a married couple)!<br>\nWhether you cry, or bang your head later! <br>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Other legends of the origin of Lohri festival==\nSome people believe that Lohri has derived its name from Loi, the wife of Saint Kabir. There is a legend amongst some people that Lohri comes from the word 'loh', which means the light and the warmness of fire. Lohri is also called lohi in rural Punjab. According to another legend Holika and Lohri were sisters. While the former perished in the Holi fire, the latter survived with Prahlad. Eating of til (sesame seeds) and rorhi is considered to be essential on Lohri day. Perhaps the words til and rorhi merged to become tilorhi, which eventually got shortened to Lohri.\n\n==Similar festivals in other countries==\n[[Winter solstice]] festivals have been incorporated into other festivals which are celebrated in various regions around the world. The festival of [[Yule]] is observed during [[Christmas]] celebrations whereby a log is burnt to commemorate the [[winter solstice]].\n\nThe festival of [[Hogmanay]] is celebrated on new year\u2019s day. The fire festival of Stonehaven in [[Scotland]] is the direct descendant of lighting winter solstice bonfires.<ref name=\"The History of Hogmanay\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofScotland/The-History-of-Hogmanay/|title=The History of Hogmanay|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref> Another event is observed every 11 January when the flaming Clavie (a barrel full of staves) is carried round in Burghead and is wedged on the Doorie Hill.

Hindus traditionally lit bonfires in their yards after the weeks of the ''rabi'' season cropping work, socialized around the fire, sang and danced together as they marked the end of winter and the onset of longer days. After the night of bonfire celebrations, Hindus would mark Makar Sankranti and go to a sacred water body such as a river or lake to bathe.<ref>{{cite book|author1=J.

For some, throwing food into the fire represents the burning of the old year and start the next year on [[Makar Sankranti]]\n\nThe bonfire ceremony differs depending on the location in Punjab. In some parts, a small image of the folk Lohri goddess is made with gobar (cattle dung) decorating it, kindling a fire beneath it and chanting its praises.

People toss sesame seeds, gur, sugar-candy and ''rewaries'' on the bonfire, sit around it, sing and dance till the fire dies out. Some people perform a prayer and go around the fire. This is to show respect to the natural element of fire,<ref>[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/47133/bringing-home-sun-god.html] FirozBakht Ahmed Deccan Herald 18/01/2010</ref> a tradition common in [[winter solstice]] celebrations.

Lohri rituals are performed, with the accompaniment of special Lohri songs.\n\nSinging and dancing form an intrinsic part of the celebrations. People wear their brightest clothes and come to dance the [[Bhangra (dance)|bhangra]] and [[gidda]] to the beat of the [[dhol]]. Punjabi songs are sung, and everybody rejoices. Sarson da saag and makki di roti is usually served as the main course at a Lohri dinner. Lohri is a great occasion that holds great importance for farmers. However, people residing in urban areas also celebrate Lohri, as this festival provides the opportunity to interact with family and friends.\n\n==Lohri songs==\nThere are many Lohri songs. For example, the following song which has words to express gratitude to Dulla Bhatti (the 'ho's are in chorus):<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.lohrifestival.org/lohri-boys-songs.html | title = Dhulla Bhatti Song}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nSunder mundriye ho!<br>\nTera kaun vicharaa ho!<br>\nDullah Bhatti walla ho!<br>\nDullhe di dhee vyayae ho!<br>\nSer shakkar payee ho!<br>\nKudi da laal pathaka ho!<br>\nKudi da saalu paata ho!<br>\nSalu kaun samete!<br>\nChacha gali dese!<br>\nChache choori kutti! zamidara lutti!<br>\nZamindaar sudhaye!<br>\nBum Bum bhole aaye!<br>\nEk bhola reh gaya!<br>\nSipahee far ke lai gaya!<br>\nSipahee ne mari itt!<br>\nBhaanvey ro te bhaanvey pitt!<br>\nSanoo de de Lohri, te teri jeeve jodi!<br>\n(Laugh, cry or howl!)<br>\n</blockquote>\n\n'''Translation'''\n\n<blockquote>\nBeautiful girl<br>\nWho will think about you<br>\nDulla of the Bhatti clan will<br>\nDulla's daughter got married<br>\nHe gave one [[Ser (unit)|ser]] of sugar!<br>\nThe girl is wearing a red suit!<br>\nBut her shawl is torn!<br>\nWho will stitch her shawl?!<br>\nThe uncle made choori!<br>\nThe landlords looted it!<br>\nLandlords are beaten up!<br>\nLots of simple-headed boys came!<br>\nOne simpleton got left behind!<br>\nThe soldier arrested him!<br>\nThe soldier hit him with a brick!<br>\n(Cry or howl)!<br>\nGive us Lohri, long live your pair (to a married couple)!<br>\nWhether you cry, or bang your head later! <br>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Other legends of the origin of Lohri festival==\nSome people believe that Lohri has derived its name from Loi, the wife of Saint Kabir. There is a legend amongst some people that Lohri comes from the word 'loh', which means the light and the warmness of fire. Lohri is also called lohi in rural Punjab. According to another legend Holika and Lohri were sisters. While the former perished in the Holi fire, the latter survived with Prahlad. Eating of til (sesame seeds) and rorhi is considered to be essential on Lohri day. Perhaps the words til and rorhi merged to become tilorhi, which eventually got shortened to Lohri.\n\n==Similar festivals in other countries==\n[[Winter solstice]] festivals have been incorporated into other festivals which are celebrated in various regions around the world. The festival of [[Yule]] is observed during [[Christmas]] celebrations whereby a log is burnt to commemorate the [[winter solstice]].\n\nThe festival of [[Hogmanay]] is celebrated on new year\u2019s day. The fire festival of Stonehaven in [[Scotland]] is the direct descendant of lighting winter solstice bonfires.<ref name=\"The History of Hogmanay\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofScotland/The-History-of-Hogmanay/|title=The History of Hogmanay|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref> Another event is observed every 11 January when the flaming Clavie (a barrel full of staves) is carried round in Burghead and is wedged on the Doorie Hill.

The younger McMahon bought Capitol from his father in 1982, effectively seizing control of the company.

This angered other promoters and disrupted the well-established boundaries of the different wrestling promotions, eventually ending the territory system, which was in use since the founding of the NWA in the 1940s. In addition, the company used income generated by advertising, television deals, and tape sales to secure talent from rival promoters.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', McMahon noted: {{bquote|In the old days, there were wrestling fiefdoms all over the country, each with its own little lord in charge. Each little lord respected the rights of his neighboring little lord. No takeovers or raids were allowed. There were maybe 30 of these tiny kingdoms in the U.S. and if I hadn't bought out my dad, there would still be 30 of them, fragmented and struggling. I, of course, had no allegiance to those little lords.<ref name=si/>}}\n\nMcMahon gained significant traction when he hired [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) talent [[Hulk Hogan]], who had achieved popularity outside of wrestling, notably for his appearance in the film ''[[Rocky III]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|0084602}}</ref> McMahon signed [[Roddy Piper]] as Hogan's rival, and then shortly afterward [[Jesse Ventura]] as an announcer. Other wrestlers joined the roster, such as [[Jimmy Snuka]], [[Don Muraco]], [[The Iron Sheik]], [[Nikolai Volkoff]], [[Junkyard Dog]], [[Paul Orndorff]], [[Greg Valentine]], and [[Ricky Steamboat]]. Many of the wrestlers who would later join the WWF were former AWA or NWA talent.\n\nThe WWF would tour nationally in a venture that would require a huge capital investment, one that placed the WWF on the verge of financial collapse. The future of McMahon's experiment came down to the success or failure of McMahon's groundbreaking concept, [[WrestleMania]]. WrestleMania was a major success and was (and still is) marketed as the [[Super Bowl]] of professional wrestling. The concept of a wrestling [[Card (sports)|supercard]] was nothing new in North America; the NWA had begun running [[Starrcade]] a few years prior. In McMahon's eyes, however, what separated WrestleMania from other supercards was that it was intended to be accessible to those who did not watch wrestling. He invited celebrities such as [[Mr. T]], [[Muhammad Ali]], and [[Cyndi Lauper]] to participate in the event, as well as securing a deal with [[MTV]] to provide coverage. The event and hype surrounding it led to the term ''[[Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]]'', due to the cross-promotion of [[popular culture]] and professional wrestling.\n\nThe WWF business expanded significantly on the shoulders of McMahon and his [[face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] hero Hulk Hogan for the next several years. The introduction of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' on [[NBC]] in 1985 marked the first time that professional wrestling had been broadcast on network television since the 1950s, when the now-defunct [[DuMont Television Network]] broadcast matches of Vince McMahon Sr.'s Capitol Wrestling Corporation. The 1980s \"Wrestling Boom\" peaked with the [[WrestleMania III]] pay-per-view at the Pontiac Silverdome in 1987, which set an attendance record of 93,173, a record that stood for 29 years until [[WrestleMania 32]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/wrestlemania-32--record-and-reputations-tumble-075620564.html|title=Wrestlemania 32: Record and reputations tumble|publisher=|accessdate=March 15, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061259/https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/wrestlemania-32--record-and-reputations-tumble-075620564.html|archivedate=October 7, 2016}}</ref> A rematch of the WrestleMania III main event between WWF champion Hulk Hogan and [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] took place on ''[[The Main Event I]]'' in 1988 and was seen by 33 million people, the most-watched wrestling match in North American television history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania3.html|title=Steamboat&nbsp;\u2014 Savage rule WrestleMania 3|last=Powell|first=John|publisher=SLAM!

The steroid trial cost the company an estimated $5 million at a time of record low revenues. This helped drive many WWF wrestlers over to rival promotion [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), including 1980s babyface hero Hulk Hogan. During this period, the WWF promoted wrestlers of a younger age comprising \"The New Generation\", featuring [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]], [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]], [[Bret Hart]], and [[The Undertaker]], in an effort to promote new talent into the spotlight.\n\nIn January 1993, the WWF debuted its flagship cable program ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]''. WCW countered in September 1995 with its own Monday night program, ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'', which aired in the same time slot as ''Raw''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|title=WWE: History of WrestleMania|year=2009|page=53}}</ref> The two programs would trade wins in the ensuing [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] competition (known as the \"[[Monday Night Wars]]\") until mid-1996. At that point, ''Nitro'' began a nearly two-year ratings domination that was largely fueled by the introduction of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo), a stable led by former WWF performers Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall (the former Razor Ramon), and Kevin Nash (the former Diesel).<ref>{{cite web|last=Scaia|first=Rick|title=RAW vs. Nitro: Year One|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/features/mnw-y1.shtml|publisher=Online Onslaught Wrestling|accessdate=April 10, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516125131/http://www.oowrestling.com/features/mnw-y1.shtml|archivedate=May 16, 2008}}</ref>\n\n====The Attitude Era (1997\u20132002)====\n{{Main|Attitude Era}}\n{{See also|Montreal Screwjob}}\nAs the Monday Night Wars continued between ''Raw Is War'' and WCW's ''Nitro'', the WWF would transform itself from a family-friendly product into a more adult-oriented product, known as the [[Attitude Era]].

Although [[Eric Bischoff]], whom Time Warner fired as WCW president in October 1999, was nearing a deal to purchase the company, in March 2001 McMahon acquired the rights to WCW's trademarks, tape library, contracts, and other properties from AOL Time Warner for a number reported to be around $7 million.<ref name=wcw>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2001/2001_03_23.jsp|title=WWE Entertainment, Inc.

The younger McMahon bought Capitol from his father in 1982, effectively seizing control of the company. Seeking to make the WWF the premier wrestling promotion in the country, and eventually, the world, he began an expansion process that fundamentally changed the wrestling business.<ref name=si>{{cite news|first=William|last=Johnson|title=Wrestling With Success|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=March 25, 1991|accessdate=April 20, 2014|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119010/2/index.htm|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918090310/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119010/2/index.htm|archivedate=September 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt the annual meeting of the NWA in 1983, the McMahons and former Capitol employee [[Jim Barnett (wrestling)|Jim Barnett]] all withdrew from the organization.<ref name=won2011/> McMahon also worked to get WWF programming on syndicated television all across the United States. This angered other promoters and disrupted the well-established boundaries of the different wrestling promotions, eventually ending the territory system, which was in use since the founding of the NWA in the 1940s. In addition, the company used income generated by advertising, television deals, and tape sales to secure talent from rival promoters.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', McMahon noted: {{bquote|In the old days, there were wrestling fiefdoms all over the country, each with its own little lord in charge. Each little lord respected the rights of his neighboring little lord. No takeovers or raids were allowed. There were maybe 30 of these tiny kingdoms in the U.S. and if I hadn't bought out my dad, there would still be 30 of them, fragmented and struggling. I, of course, had no allegiance to those little lords.<ref name=si/>}}\n\nMcMahon gained significant traction when he hired [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) talent [[Hulk Hogan]], who had achieved popularity outside of wrestling, notably for his appearance in the film ''[[Rocky III]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|0084602}}</ref> McMahon signed [[Roddy Piper]] as Hogan's rival, and then shortly afterward [[Jesse Ventura]] as an announcer. Other wrestlers joined the roster, such as [[Jimmy Snuka]], [[Don Muraco]], [[The Iron Sheik]], [[Nikolai Volkoff]], [[Junkyard Dog]], [[Paul Orndorff]], [[Greg Valentine]], and [[Ricky Steamboat]]. Many of the wrestlers who would later join the WWF were former AWA or NWA talent.\n\nThe WWF would tour nationally in a venture that would require a huge capital investment, one that placed the WWF on the verge of financial collapse. The future of McMahon's experiment came down to the success or failure of McMahon's groundbreaking concept, [[WrestleMania]]. WrestleMania was a major success and was (and still is) marketed as the [[Super Bowl]] of professional wrestling. The concept of a wrestling [[Card (sports)|supercard]] was nothing new in North America; the NWA had begun running [[Starrcade]] a few years prior. In McMahon's eyes, however, what separated WrestleMania from other supercards was that it was intended to be accessible to those who did not watch wrestling. He invited celebrities such as [[Mr. T]], [[Muhammad Ali]], and [[Cyndi Lauper]] to participate in the event, as well as securing a deal with [[MTV]] to provide coverage. The event and hype surrounding it led to the term ''[[Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]]'', due to the cross-promotion of [[popular culture]] and professional wrestling.\n\nThe WWF business expanded significantly on the shoulders of McMahon and his [[face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] hero Hulk Hogan for the next several years. The introduction of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' on [[NBC]] in 1985 marked the first time that professional wrestling had been broadcast on network television since the 1950s, when the now-defunct [[DuMont Television Network]] broadcast matches of Vince McMahon Sr.'s Capitol Wrestling Corporation. The 1980s \"Wrestling Boom\" peaked with the [[WrestleMania III]] pay-per-view at the Pontiac Silverdome in 1987, which set an attendance record of 93,173, a record that stood for 29 years until [[WrestleMania 32]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/wrestlemania-32--record-and-reputations-tumble-075620564.html|title=Wrestlemania 32: Record and reputations tumble|publisher=|accessdate=March 15, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061259/https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/wrestlemania-32--record-and-reputations-tumble-075620564.html|archivedate=October 7, 2016}}</ref> A rematch of the WrestleMania III main event between WWF champion Hulk Hogan and [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] took place on ''[[The Main Event I]]'' in 1988 and was seen by 33 million people, the most-watched wrestling match in North American television history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania3.html|title=Steamboat&nbsp;\u2014 Savage rule WrestleMania 3|last=Powell|first=John|publisher=SLAM!

The steroid trial cost the company an estimated $5 million at a time of record low revenues. This helped drive many WWF wrestlers over to rival promotion [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), including 1980s babyface hero Hulk Hogan. During this period, the WWF promoted wrestlers of a younger age comprising \"The New Generation\", featuring [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]], [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]], [[Bret Hart]], and [[The Undertaker]], in an effort to promote new talent into the spotlight.\n\nIn January 1993, the WWF debuted its flagship cable program ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]''. WCW countered in September 1995 with its own Monday night program, ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'', which aired in the same time slot as ''Raw''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|title=WWE: History of WrestleMania|year=2009|page=53}}</ref> The two programs would trade wins in the ensuing [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] competition (known as the \"[[Monday Night Wars]]\") until mid-1996. At that point, ''Nitro'' began a nearly two-year ratings domination that was largely fueled by the introduction of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo), a stable led by former WWF performers Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall (the former Razor Ramon), and Kevin Nash (the former Diesel).<ref>{{cite web|last=Scaia|first=Rick|title=RAW vs. Nitro: Year One|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/features/mnw-y1.shtml|publisher=Online Onslaught Wrestling|accessdate=April 10, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516125131/http://www.oowrestling.com/features/mnw-y1.shtml|archivedate=May 16, 2008}}</ref>\n\n====The Attitude Era (1997\u20132002)====\n{{Main|Attitude Era}}\n{{See also|Montreal Screwjob}}\nAs the Monday Night Wars continued between ''Raw Is War'' and WCW's ''Nitro'', the WWF would transform itself from a family-friendly product into a more adult-oriented product, known as the [[Attitude Era]].

Although [[Eric Bischoff]], whom Time Warner fired as WCW president in October 1999, was nearing a deal to purchase the company, in March 2001 McMahon acquired the rights to WCW's trademarks, tape library, contracts, and other properties from AOL Time Warner for a number reported to be around $7 million.<ref name=wcw>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2001/2001_03_23.jsp|title=WWE Entertainment, Inc.

Along with [[Louis-Philippe Cr\u00e9pin]], he became one of the first two official [[Peintre de la Marine|Peintres de la Marine]] in 1830.\n\n== Biography ==\nGudin was born in [[Paris]]. Nothing is known of his father and, in his memoirs, he seems to suggest that his mother was a widow who took full responsibility for raising him and his older brother, Jean-Louis  (1799-1823).<ref name=Souvenirs01>B\u00e9raud, ''Souvenirs du Baron Gudin'', pgs. 25-26.</ref>. He was enrolled at a naval school, but quit his studies to go to New York, where he mingled with the [[Bonapartist]]s in exile. In 1819, he joined the [[United States Navy]] and sailed aboard the ''Manchester Packet'', a 250 ton [[brig]].<ref name=\"LFM\">[[Eug\u00e8ne Sue]], In: [https://books.google.fr/books?id=u5FBAAAAcAAJ&hl=fr&pg=PP9#v=onepage&q&f=false ''La France maritime''], edited by Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Gr\u00e9han, Paris, Postel, 1837, Vol. III, pgs.158-160.</ref>.\n\nIn 1822, he returned to Paris and, inspired by his brother (who had become a student of [[Horace Vernet]]) he decided to pursue a career in art and found a position in the studios of [[Anne-Louis Girodet]].<ref name=Souvenirs01/>. He made his debut at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] that same year.<ref>[http://salons.musee-orsay.fr/index/exposant/58661 Base Salons], Paris, ann\u00e9e 1822, mus\u00e9e d'Orsay.</ref>. The following year, he and his brother were involved in a shipwreck on the Seine, from which he escaped. His brother drowned, however, and this affected him deeply for the rest of his life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Le Miroir des spectacles, des lettres, des m\u0153urs et des arts|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6237691k|website=Gallica|language=FR|date=1823-03-07|access-date=2018-12-31|publication-date=}}</ref>\nIn 1824, he had another exhibition at the Salon and won the support of future King [[Louis Philippe I]] with a painting of the ship that had taken him on a visit to America. In 1828, King [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] commissioned him to paint a depiction of Ensign {{ill|Hippolyte Bisson|fr}} who, the year before, had blown up his ship rather than surrender it to pirates. Shortly after, Gudin went with his friend, [[Abel Aubert Dupetit Thouars]], to participate in the [[French conquest of Algeria|Algerian Expedition]], where he made numerous sketches. \n\nUpon his return, he was named a \"Peintre de la Marine\" at the court of Louis Philippe. Over the next few years, he made painting trips to Italy, Switzerland and Russia. He was then created a Baron by the King and commissioned to produce ninety paintings on French naval history for the [[Palace of Versailles]], a monumental task that apparently undermined his health.\n\nHe was named an officer in the [[Legion of Honor]] in 1841<ref name=\"LH\"/>. Following an exhibit in Berlin in 1845, he received the cross ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]''<ref>J. Wagner, ''Der Orden \u201ePour le merite\u201c f\u00fcr Wissenschaft und K\u00fcnste. Die Mitglieder 1842\u20131883'', Gebr. Mann-Verlag, Berlin, 1975.</ref>. In 1844, he married Louise Margaret Hay (1820-1890), daughter of the English General James Hay (1788-1862) and goddaughter of the King. They had three children, including the painter [[Henriette Gudin]]. \n\nDuring the [[French Revolution of 1848]], he divided his time between France and England and remained neutral. However, during the [[French coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851|Coup d'\u00c9tat of 1851]], he came down firmly on the side of the Republicans. In 1857, he was named a Commander in the Legion of Honor.<ref name=\"LH\">{{Base L\u00e9onore|LH/1214/30}}</ref>. \nIn 1865, back in favor with the Bonapartes, he accompanied the Emperor, [[Napol\u00e9on III]], to Algeria and returned by way of [[Tangiers]] on the Imperial [[corvette]] ''[[French ship Cassard (1846)|Reine Hortense]]''.  \n\nHe served as Vice-President of the {{ill|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 centrale de sauvetage des naufrag\u00e9s|fr}}<ref>La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 centrale de sauvetage des naufrag\u00e9s (SCSN), a \u00e9t\u00e9 [http://gatinais.histoire.pagesperso-orange.fr/Rigault_de_Genouilly.htm reconnue d\u2019utilit\u00e9 publique par un d\u00e9cret imp\u00e9rial du 17 novembre 1865]</ref>, which he helped to create in 1864, in memory of his late brother Jean Louis.<ref>[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1133832/f707.item.r=gudin%20jean%20louis.zoom Biography of Jean Louis Gudin] @ Gallica BnF</ref>.

Nothing is known of his father and, in his memoirs, he seems to suggest that his mother was a widow who took full responsibility for raising him and his older brother, Jean-Louis  (1799-1823).<ref name=Souvenirs01>B\u00e9raud, ''Souvenirs du Baron Gudin'', pgs. 25-26.</ref>. He was enrolled at a naval school, but quit his studies to go to New York, where he mingled with the [[Bonapartist]]s in exile. In 1819, he joined the [[United States Navy]] and sailed aboard the ''Manchester Packet'', a 250 ton [[brig]].<ref name=\"LFM\">[[Eug\u00e8ne Sue]], In: [https://books.google.fr/books?id=u5FBAAAAcAAJ&hl=fr&pg=PP9#v=onepage&q&f=false ''La France maritime''], edited by Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Gr\u00e9han, Paris, Postel, 1837, Vol. III, pgs.158-160.</ref>.\n\nIn 1822, he returned to Paris and, inspired by his brother (who had become a student of [[Horace Vernet]]) he decided to pursue a career in art and found a position in the studios of [[Anne-Louis Girodet]].<ref name=Souvenirs01/>. He made his debut at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] that same year.<ref>[http://salons.musee-orsay.fr/index/exposant/58661 Base Salons], Paris, ann\u00e9e 1822, mus\u00e9e d'Orsay.</ref>. The following year, he and his brother were involved in a shipwreck on the Seine, from which he escaped. His brother drowned, however, and this affected him deeply for the rest of his life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Le Miroir des spectacles, des lettres, des m\u0153urs et des arts|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6237691k|website=Gallica|language=FR|date=1823-03-07|access-date=2018-12-31|publication-date=}}</ref>\nIn 1824, he had another exhibition at the Salon and won the support of future King [[Louis Philippe I]] with a painting of the ship that had taken him on a visit to America. In 1828, King [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] commissioned him to paint a depiction of Ensign {{ill|Hippolyte Bisson|fr}} who, the year before, had blown up his ship rather than surrender it to pirates. Shortly after, Gudin went with his friend, [[Abel Aubert Dupetit Thouars]], to participate in the [[French conquest of Algeria|Algerian Expedition]], where he made numerous sketches. \n\nUpon his return, he was named a \"Peintre de la Marine\" at the court of Louis Philippe. Over the next few years, he made painting trips to Italy, Switzerland and Russia. He was then created a Baron by the King and commissioned to produce ninety paintings on French naval history for the [[Palace of Versailles]], a monumental task that apparently undermined his health.\n\nHe was named an officer in the [[Legion of Honor]] in 1841<ref name=\"LH\"/>. Following an exhibit in Berlin in 1845, he received the cross ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]''<ref>J. Wagner, ''Der Orden \u201ePour le merite\u201c f\u00fcr Wissenschaft und K\u00fcnste.

In 1844, he married Louise Margaret Hay (1820-1890), daughter of the English General James Hay (1788-1862) and goddaughter of the King. They had three children, including the painter [[Henriette Gudin]]. \n\nDuring the [[French Revolution of 1848]], he divided his time between France and England and remained neutral. However, during the [[French coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851|Coup d'\u00c9tat of 1851]], he came down firmly on the side of the Republicans.
