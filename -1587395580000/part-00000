The second major revision, the [[iMac G4]], moved the design to a hemispherical base containing all the main components and an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] monitor on a freely moving arm attached to it. The third and fourth major revisions, the [[iMac G5]] and the [[iMac (Intel-based)|Intel iMac]] respectively, placed all the components immediately behind the display, creating a slim unified design that tilts only up and down on a simple metal base. The fifth major revision (mid-2007) shared the same form as the previous model, but was thinner and used [[anodized aluminum]] and a glass panel over the entire front. The sixth major revision (late 2012) uses a different display unit, omits the [[SuperDrive]], and uses different production techniques from the older unibody versions. This allows it to be thinner at the edge than older models, with an edge thickness of 5.9 mm (but the same maximum depth). It also includes a dual microphone setup, and includes [[solid-state drive]] (SSD) or hard disk storage, or an Apple [[Fusion Drive]], a hybrid of solid state and hard disk drives.

''[[The Verge]]''.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe announcement of iMac in 1998 was a source of controversy and anticipation among commentators, Mac fans, and detractors. Opinions were divided over Apple's drastic changes to the Macintosh hardware. At the time, Apple had suffered a series of setbacks as consumers increasingly opted for [[Wintel]] (Windows PCs) machines instead of Apple's [[Performa]] models. Many in the industry thought that \"beleaguered\" Apple would soon be forced to start selling computers with a custom interface built on top of one or more potential operating system bases, such as [[Taligent]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], or [[Windows 98]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macspeedzone.com/archive/art/con/be.shtml|title=Apple Confidential: The Day They Almost Decided To Put Windows On The Mac Instead Of OS X!|quote=Hancock ordered her staff to consider Microsoft's Windows, Sun Microsystems' Solaris, and even the ill-fated Taligent, which Apple had handed off to partner IBM in December 1995.

Apple announced at the [[Worldwide Developers Conference]] that it would be [[Apple's transition to Intel processors|switching the Macintosh to the x86 architecture]] and Intel's line of Core processors.  The first Intel-equipped Macs were unveiled on January 10, 2006: the Intel iMac and the introductory MacBook Pro.  Within nine months, Apple had smoothly transitioned the entire Macintosh line to Intel.  One of the highly touted side benefits of this switch was the ability to run Windows on Mac hardware.[[File:Timeline of the product Apple iMac.svg|thumb|400px|The timeline of iMac from 1998 to 2015, comparing it with the original [[Macintosh 128K]] (1984).

The high end 27\" features a [[Intel Core i5|Quad-Core i5]] processor, which is upgradable to a [[Intel Core i7|Quad-Core i7]]. On this date Apple also announced its new \"[[Apple Magic Trackpad]]\" peripheral, a trackpad similar to that of MacBook Pro for use with iMac or any other Apple computer. Apple also introduced a AA NiMH battery charger intended to simplify the use of batteries in these peripherals. Apple offers an option to use a solid state drive instead of a large mechanical drive.\n\nOn May 3, 2011, Apple updated its iMac line with the introduction of Intel [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] technology and Intel Core [[Intel Core i5|i5]] and [[Intel Core i7|i7]] [[Sandy Bridge]] processors as well as a 1 mega pixel [[high definition video|high definition]] [[iSight|FaceTime]] camera, features which were first introduced in the [[MacBook Pro]] line in February 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/05/03imac.html |title=Apple Announces New iMac With Next Generation Quad-Core Processors, Graphics & Thunderbolt I/O Technology |publisher=Apple |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn October 23, 2012, a new iMac was announced (for a November/December release) with a substantially thinner edge, new Apple [[Fusion Drive]], faster processors (Intel Core [[Intel Core i5|i5]] and [[Intel Core i7|i7]] [[Ivy Bridge (microarchitecture)|Ivy Bridge]]) and graphics along with updates to the ports, but with the same overall depth (stand depth: 8 inches (20.3&nbsp;cm)). To reduce the edge, the [[SuperDrive]] was removed on these iMacs.\n\nOn October 16, 2014, a new version of the 27-inch (69&nbsp;cm) iMac was announced, whose main feature is a \"[[Retina Display|Retina 5K]]\" display at a resolution of 5120 \u00d7 2880 pixels.<ref name=Retina5KPixels>{{cite web|title=Apple - iMac with Retina 5K display - Features|url=https://www.apple.com/imac-with-retina/features/|publisher=Apple Inc |accessdate=24 February 2015}}</ref> The new model also includes a new [[Haswell (microarchitecture)|processor]], [[AMD Radeon Rx 200 Series|graphics chip]], and [[Input/output|I/O]], along with several new [[Computer data storage|storage]] options.

Previously, Macintosh users had to seek out certain hardware, such as keyboards and mice specifically tailored for the \"old world\" Mac's unique [[Apple Desktop Bus|ADB]] interface and printers and modems with [[Mini-DIN connector#8-pin|MiniDIN-8]] serial ports. Only a limited number of models from certain manufacturers were made with these interfaces, and often came at a premium price. USB, being cross-platform, has allowed Macintosh users to select from a large selection of devices marketed for the [[Wintel]] PC platform, such as [[USB hub|hubs]], [[image scanner|scanners]], [[data storage device|storage devices]], [[USB flash drives]], and [[Mouse (computing)|mice]]. After the iMac, Apple continued to remove older peripheral interfaces and floppy drives from the rest of its product line.\n\nBorrowing from the 1997 [[Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh]], the various LCD-based iMac designs continued the all-in-one concept first envisioned in Apple's original Macintosh computer. The successful iMac allowed Apple to continue targeting the [[Power Macintosh]] line at the high-end of the market. This foreshadowed a similar strategy in the notebook market when the iMac-like [[iBook]] was released in 2006. Since then, the company has continued this strategy of differentiating the consumer versus professional product lines. Apple's focus on design has allowed each of its subsequent products to create a distinctive identity. Apple avoided using the beige colors then pervading the PC industry. The company would later drift from the multicolored designs of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The latter part of the decade saw Apple using [[Anodizing|anodized]] aluminum; glass; and white, black, and clear [[polycarbonate]] plastics among their build materials. Today many PCs are more design-conscious than before the iMac's introduction, with multi-shaded design schemes being common, and some desktops and laptops available in colorful, decorative patterns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/135017/2008/08/imacanniversary.html |title=Eight ways the iMac changed computing |accessdate=August 27, 2008 |work=[[Macworld]] |date=August 15, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nApple's use of translucent, candy-colored plastics inspired similar [[industrial design]]s in other consumer products.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2008/09/gallery-imac-anniversary/ |title=10 Years of Cuddly, Friendly iMacs |work=Wired |first=Benj |last=Edwards |date=September 15, 2008}}</ref> Apple's later introduction of the iPod, iBook G3 (Dual USB), and iMac G4 (all featuring snowy-white plastic), inspired similar designs in other companies' consumer electronics products.

In ''The Mythical Midrange Mac Minitower'', Dan Frakes of ''Macworld'' suggests that with iMac occupying the midrange of Apple's product line, Apple has little to offer consumers who want some ability to expand or upgrade their computers, but do not need (or cannot afford) the [[Mac Pro]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Frakes |first=Dan |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/58562/2007/06/midrangemac.html |title=The Mythical Midrange Mac Minitower |work=Macworld |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref> For example, iMac's integration of monitor and computer, while convenient, commits the owner to replacing both at the same time.

Models after iMac G5 (excluding the August 7, 2007 iMac update) made it difficult for the end-user to replace the hard disk or optical drive, and Apple's warranty explicitly forbids upgrading the socketed CPU. While conceding the possibility of a minitower cannibalizing sales from the Mac Pro, Frakes argues there is enough frustration with iMac's limitations to make such a proposition worthwhile. This disparity has become more pronounced after the G4 era since the bottom-end Power Mac G5 (with one brief exception) and Mac Pro models have all been priced in the US$1999\u20132499 range, while base model Power Macs G4s and earlier were US$1299\u20131799. The current generation iMac has Intel 5th generation i5 and i7 processors, ranging from quad core 2.7&nbsp;GHz i5 to a quad core 3.4&nbsp;GHz i7 processor,<ref>{{cite

The second major revision, the [[iMac G4]], moved the design to a hemispherical base containing all the main components and an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] monitor on a freely moving arm attached to it. The third and fourth major revisions, the [[iMac G5]] and the [[iMac (Intel-based)|Intel iMac]] respectively, placed all the components immediately behind the display, creating a slim unified design that tilts only up and down on a simple metal base. The fifth major revision (mid-2007) shared the same form as the previous model, but was thinner and used [[anodized aluminum]] and a glass panel over the entire front. The sixth major revision (late 2012) uses a different display unit, omits the [[SuperDrive]], and uses different production techniques from the older unibody versions. This allows it to be thinner at the edge than older models, with an edge thickness of 5.9 mm (but the same maximum depth). It also includes a dual microphone setup, and includes [[solid-state drive]] (SSD) or hard disk storage, or an Apple [[Fusion Drive]], a hybrid of solid state and hard disk drives. This version of the iMac was announced in October 2012, with the {{convert|21.5|in|cm|adj=on}} version released in November and the {{convert|27|in|cm|adj=on}} version in December; these were refreshed in September 2013, with new [[Haswell (microarchitecture)|Haswell]] processors, faster graphics, faster and larger SSD options and [[IEEE 802.11ac|802.11ac]] Wi-Fi cards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apple Updates iMac|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/09/24Apple-Updates-iMac.html|publisher=Apple|accessdate=September 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2014, the seventh major revision of the {{convert|27|in|cm|adj=on}} iMac was announced, whose main feature is a \"[[Retina Display|Retina]] [[5K_resolution|5K]]\" display at a resolution of 5120 \u00d7 2880 pixels.

''[[The Verge]]''.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe announcement of iMac in 1998 was a source of controversy and anticipation among commentators, Mac fans, and detractors. Opinions were divided over Apple's drastic changes to the Macintosh hardware. At the time, Apple had suffered a series of setbacks as consumers increasingly opted for [[Wintel]] (Windows PCs) machines instead of Apple's [[Performa]] models. Many in the industry thought that \"beleaguered\" Apple would soon be forced to start selling computers with a custom interface built on top of one or more potential operating system bases, such as [[Taligent]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], or [[Windows 98]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macspeedzone.com/archive/art/con/be.shtml|title=Apple Confidential: The Day They Almost Decided To Put Windows On The Mac Instead Of OS X!|quote=Hancock ordered her staff to consider Microsoft's Windows, Sun Microsystems' Solaris, and even the ill-fated Taligent, which Apple had handed off to partner IBM in December 1995.

Apple announced at the [[Worldwide Developers Conference]] that it would be [[Apple's transition to Intel processors|switching the Macintosh to the x86 architecture]] and Intel's line of Core processors.  The first Intel-equipped Macs were unveiled on January 10, 2006: the Intel iMac and the introductory MacBook Pro.  Within nine months, Apple had smoothly transitioned the entire Macintosh line to Intel.  One of the highly touted side benefits of this switch was the ability to run Windows on Mac hardware.[[File:Timeline of the product Apple iMac.svg|thumb|400px|The timeline of iMac from 1998 to 2015, comparing it with the original [[Macintosh 128K]] (1984).

The 21.5\" models now feature the [[Intel Core i3|Core i3]] processor, but these are upgradable to the Core i5. The high end 27\" features a [[Intel Core i5|Quad-Core i5]] processor, which is upgradable to a [[Intel Core i7|Quad-Core i7]]. On this date Apple also announced its new \"[[Apple Magic Trackpad]]\" peripheral, a trackpad similar to that of MacBook Pro for use with iMac or any other Apple computer. Apple also introduced a AA NiMH battery charger intended to simplify the use of batteries in these peripherals. Apple offers an option to use a solid state drive instead of a large mechanical drive.\n\nOn May 3, 2011, Apple updated its iMac line with the introduction of Intel [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] technology and Intel Core [[Intel Core i5|i5]] and [[Intel Core i7|i7]] [[Sandy Bridge]] processors as well as a 1 mega pixel [[high definition video|high definition]] [[iSight|FaceTime]] camera, features which were first introduced in the [[MacBook Pro]] line in February 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/05/03imac.html |title=Apple Announces New iMac With Next Generation Quad-Core Processors, Graphics & Thunderbolt I/O Technology |publisher=Apple |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn October 23, 2012, a new iMac was announced (for a November/December release) with a substantially thinner edge, new Apple [[Fusion Drive]], faster processors (Intel Core [[Intel Core i5|i5]] and [[Intel Core i7|i7]] [[Ivy Bridge (microarchitecture)|Ivy Bridge]]) and graphics along with updates to the ports, but with the same overall depth (stand depth: 8 inches (20.3&nbsp;cm)). To reduce the edge, the [[SuperDrive]] was removed on these iMacs.\n\nOn October 16, 2014, a new version of the 27-inch (69&nbsp;cm) iMac was announced, whose main feature is a \"[[Retina Display|Retina 5K]]\" display at a resolution of 5120 \u00d7 2880 pixels.<ref name=Retina5KPixels>{{cite web|title=Apple - iMac with Retina 5K display - Features|url=https://www.apple.com/imac-with-retina/features/|publisher=Apple Inc |accessdate=24 February 2015}}</ref> The new model also includes a new [[Haswell (microarchitecture)|processor]], [[AMD Radeon Rx 200 Series|graphics chip]], and [[Input/output|I/O]], along with several new [[Computer data storage|storage]] options. This computer was designed with professional photographers and video editors in mind, with the 5K resolution allowing 4K video to be played at its native resolution in Final Cut Pro, with room for toolbars on the side.\n\nOn June 6, 2017, Apple\u2019s 21.5-inch iMac, which has a \"Retina 4K\" display at a resolution of 4096\u2009\u00d7\u20092304 pixels, and the latest Intel 7th generation i5 processor, was announced. The iMac has Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz supported, and 1 TB hard drive. Apple\u2019s iMac with 4K display has Intel Core i5 quad-core processor with 3GHz or 3.4GHz clock speed. The RAM on board is 8GB, and it will support Turbo boost of up to 3.8GHz. This iMac has options of 1TB hard drive or 1TB Fusion Drive. This 21.5-inch iMac also has the option of Radeon Pro 555 with 2GB of video RAM for graphics or a Radeon Pro 560 with 4GB of video RAM. Apple\u2019s 27-inch iMac with the 5K display comes with the quad-core Intel Core i5 processor, which is clocked at 3.4GHz, 3.5GHz or 3.8GHz.

Unlike most other Apple releases, Apple opted not to announce the iMac at an event, rather to update the specs and release a press statement. For the first time, the iMac can support 6-core or 8-core Intel processors. Apple claims the 21.5-inch model is up to 60% faster than the previous model, and the 27-inch is up to 2.4 times faster. The exterior of the machine remained the same as the previous model.\n\n== Influence ==\n\nThe [[iMac G3|original iMac]] was the first [[legacy-free PC]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Compaq Hopes to Follow the iMac|url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/compaq-hopes-to-follow-the-imac/104658|first=John G.|last=Spooner|date=December 16, 1999|work=[[ZDNet]]}}</ref> It was the first Macintosh computer to have a [[USB]] port but no [[floppy disk drive]]. Subsequently, all Macs have included USB. Via the USB port, hardware makers could make products compatible with both x86 PCs and Macs. Previously, Macintosh users had to seek out certain hardware, such as keyboards and mice specifically tailored for the \"old world\" Mac's unique [[Apple Desktop Bus|ADB]] interface and printers and modems with [[Mini-DIN connector#8-pin|MiniDIN-8]] serial ports. Only a limited number of models from certain manufacturers were made with these interfaces, and often came at a premium price. USB, being cross-platform, has allowed Macintosh users to select from a large selection of devices marketed for the [[Wintel]] PC platform, such as [[USB hub|hubs]], [[image scanner|scanners]], [[data storage device|storage devices]], [[USB flash drives]], and [[Mouse (computing)|mice]]. After the iMac, Apple continued to remove older peripheral interfaces and floppy drives from the rest of its product line.\n\nBorrowing from the 1997 [[Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh]], the various LCD-based iMac designs continued the all-in-one concept first envisioned in Apple's original Macintosh computer. The successful iMac allowed Apple to continue targeting the [[Power Macintosh]] line at the high-end of the market. This foreshadowed a similar strategy in the notebook market when the iMac-like [[iBook]] was released in 2006. Since then, the company has continued this strategy of differentiating the consumer versus professional product lines. Apple's focus on design has allowed each of its subsequent products to create a distinctive identity. Apple avoided using the beige colors then pervading the PC industry. The company would later drift from the multicolored designs of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The latter part of the decade saw Apple using [[Anodizing|anodized]] aluminum; glass; and white, black, and clear [[polycarbonate]] plastics among their build materials. Today many PCs are more design-conscious than before the iMac's introduction, with multi-shaded design schemes being common, and some desktops and laptops available in colorful, decorative patterns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/135017/2008/08/imacanniversary.html |title=Eight ways the iMac changed computing |accessdate=August 27, 2008 |work=[[Macworld]] |date=August 15, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nApple's use of translucent, candy-colored plastics inspired similar [[industrial design]]s in other consumer products.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2008/09/gallery-imac-anniversary/ |title=10 Years of Cuddly, Friendly iMacs |work=Wired |first=Benj |last=Edwards |date=September 15, 2008}}</ref> Apple's later introduction of the iPod, iBook G3 (Dual USB), and iMac G4 (all featuring snowy-white plastic), inspired similar designs in other companies' consumer electronics products.

Models after iMac G5 (excluding the August 7, 2007 iMac update) made it difficult for the end-user to replace the hard disk or optical drive, and Apple's warranty explicitly forbids upgrading the socketed CPU. While conceding the possibility of a minitower cannibalizing sales from the Mac Pro, Frakes argues there is enough frustration with iMac's limitations to make such a proposition worthwhile. This disparity has become more pronounced after the G4 era since the bottom-end Power Mac G5 (with one brief exception) and Mac Pro models have all been priced in the US$1999\u20132499 range, while base model Power Macs G4s and earlier were US$1299\u20131799. The current generation iMac has Intel 5th generation i5 and i7 processors, ranging from quad core 2.7&nbsp;GHz i5 to a quad core 3.4&nbsp;GHz i7 processor,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/imac/specs/ |title=iMac Technical Specifications |date=December 10, 2012}}</ref> however it is possible to upgrade the 2010 edition of the iMac quite easily.<ref>{{cite

She was born and grew up in [[Somerset]], and spent half of her childhood in [[Glastonbury]], and the other half in a small farming village on the edge of the [[Somerset Levels|Somerset]] Levels. She had a mixed education, and ended up attending art college for a year before moving to [[London]]. A first career culminated in working as a Production Assistant then Producer in TV commercials for directors including [[Ridley Scott|Ridley]] and [[Tony Scott]]. She gave it up to spend a year in Spain with her boyfriend Dominic, who remains her partner. She returned pregnant. She attended the University of Southampton as a mature student.

In a review by Ciaran Carson, he said that the bog poems made Heaney into \"the laureate of violence\u2014a mythmaker, an anthropologist of ritual killing...the world of megalithic doorways and charming noble barbarity.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Donoghue|first1=Bernard|title=The Cambridge Companion to Seamus Heaney|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=4}}</ref> Poems such as \"Bogland\" and \"Bog Queen\" addressed political struggles directly for the first time.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0LZlAAAAMAAJ |p=5 |title=The body and desire in contemporary Irish poetry |author=Irene Gilsenan Nordin |publisher=Irish Academic Press |year=2006|isbn=9780716533689 }}</ref>\n\n===Politics===\nAllusions to sectarian difference, widespread in Northern Ireland through his lifetime, can be found in his poems.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://trinity.duke.edu/node/1637 |work=[[Duke University]] |author=Ezgi Ustundag |title=Expressing Humanity During 'The Troubles:' The Poetry of Seamus Heaney}}</ref> His books ''Wintering Out'' (1973) and ''North'' (1975) seek to interweave commentary on [[the Troubles]] with a historical context and wider human experience.<ref name=poetry_foundation>{{cite news|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/seamus-heaney|title=Biography|work=Poetry Foundation}}</ref> While some critics accused Heaney of being \"an apologist and a mythologiser\" of the violence, [[Blake Morrison]] suggests the poet <blockquote>has written poems directly about the Troubles as well as elegies for friends and acquaintances who have died in them; he has tried to discover a historical framework in which to interpret the current unrest; and he has taken on the mantle of public spokesman, someone looked to for comment and guidance...

His collections often recall the assassinations of his family members and close friends, lynchings and bombings. [[Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn]] wrote, \"throughout his career there have been poems of simple evocation and description. His refusal to sum up or offer meaning is part of his tact.\"<ref name=toibin_human_chain/>\n\nHeaney published \"Requiem for the [[Croppy|Croppies]]\", a poem that commemorates the Irish rebels of 1798, on the 50th anniversary of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. He read the poem to both Catholic and Protestant audiences in Ireland. He commented, \"To read 'Requiem for the Croppies' wasn't to say \u2018up the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]]\u2019 or anything. It was silence-breaking rather than rabble-rousing.\"<ref name=sameer_rahim_70th_birthday_interview>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/5132022/Interview-with-Seamus-Heaney.html|title=Interview with Seamus Heaney: On the eve of his 70th birthday, Seamus Heaney tells Sameer Rahim about his lifetime in poetry \u2013 and who he thinks would make a good poet laureate|first=Sameer|last=Rahim|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=11 May 2009|accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> He stated, \"You don't have to love it.

Although he was born in Northern Ireland, his response to being included in the British anthology was delivered in his poem \"An Open Letter\":\n<poem>\n:Don't be surprised if I demur, for, be advised\n:My passport's green.\n:No glass of ours was ever raised\n:To toast The Queen.<ref name=sameer_rahim_70th_birthday_interview/>\n</poem>\n\n===Translation===\nHe was concerned, as a poet and a translator, with the English language as it is spoken in Ireland but also as spoken elsewhere and in other times; he explored [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] influences in his work and study. Critic [[W. S. Di Piero]] noted <blockquote>Whatever the occasion, childhood, farm life, politics and culture in Northern Ireland, other poets past and present, Heaney strikes time and again at the taproot of language, examining its genetic structures, trying to discover how it has served, in all its changes, as a culture bearer, a world to contain imaginations, at once a rhetorical weapon and nutriment of spirit. He writes of these matters with rare discrimination and resourcefulness, and a winning impatience with received wisdom.<ref name=poetry_foundation/></blockquote> Heaney's first translation was of the Irish lyric poem ''[[Buile Shuibhne|Buile Suibhne]]'', published as ''Sweeney Astray: A Version from the Irish'' (1984). He took up this character and connection in poems published in ''Station Island'' (1984). Heaney's prize-winning translation of ''[[Beowulf: A New Verse Translation|Beowulf]]'' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2000, Whitbread Book of the Year Award) was considered groundbreaking in its use of modern language melded with the original Anglo-Saxon \"music\".<ref name=poetry_foundation/>\n\n===Plays and prose===\nHis plays include ''The Cure at Troy: A Version of Sophocles' Philoctetes'' (1991). Heaney's 2004 play, ''[[The Burial at Thebes]],'' suggests parallels between [[Creon]] and the foreign policies of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/arts/21weekahead.html|title=The Week Ahead: Jan. 21 \u2013 27|first=Steven|last=McElroy|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=21 January 2007|accessdate=21 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nHeaney's engagement with poetry as a necessary engine for cultural and personal change is reflected in his prose works ''The Redress of Poetry'' (1995) and ''Finders Keepers: Selected Prose, 1971\u20132001'' (2002).<ref name=poetry_foundation/> \n<blockquote>\"When a poem rhymes,\" Heaney wrote, \"when a form generates itself, when a metre provokes consciousness into new postures, it is already on the side of life. When a rhyme surprises and extends the fixed relations between words, that in itself protests against necessity. When language does more than enough, as it does in all achieved poetry, it opts for the condition of overlife, and rebels at limit.\"<ref name=toibin_human_chain/></blockquote>He continues: \"The vision of reality which poetry offers should be transformative, more than just a printout of the given circumstances of its time and place\".<ref name=toibin_human_chain/> Often overlooked and underestimated in the direction of his work is his profound poetic debts to and critical engagement with 20th-century Eastern European poets, and in particular Nobel laureate [[Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz]].<ref>Kay, Magdalena.

Originally entitled ''The Faber Book of Verse for Younger People'' on the Faber contract, Hughes and Heaney decided the main purpose of ''The Rattle Bag'' was to offer enjoyment to the reader: \"Arbitrary riches.\" Heaney commented \"the book in our heads was something closer to ''The Fancy Free Poetry Supplement.''\"<ref name=bags_of_enlightenment/> It included work that they would have liked to encountered sooner in their own lives, as well as nonsense rhymes, ballad-type poems, riddles, folk songs and rhythmical jingles. Much familiar canonical work was not included, since they took it for granted that their audience would know the standard fare. Fifteen years later, ''The School Bag'' aimed at something different. The foreword stated that they wanted \"less of a carnival, more like a checklist.\" It included poems in English, Irish, Welsh, Scots and Scots Gaelic, together with work reflecting the African-American experience.<ref name=bags_of_enlightenment>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/25/poetry.highereducation|title=Bags of enlightenment|date=25 October 2003|accessdate=25 October 2003|first=Seamus|last=Heaney|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group}}</ref> <!--Two of his poems entitled \"Storm on the Island\" and \"Follower\" feature on the new [[GCSE]] English Literature course as part of the anthology poetry cluster.

Although he was born in Northern Ireland, his response to being included in the British anthology was delivered in his poem \"An Open Letter\":\n<poem>\n:Don't be surprised if I demur, for, be advised\n:My passport's green.\n:No glass of ours was ever raised\n:To toast The Queen.<ref name=sameer_rahim_70th_birthday_interview/>\n</poem>\n\n===Translation===\nHe was concerned, as a poet and a translator, with the English language as it is spoken in Ireland but also as spoken elsewhere and in other times; he explored [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] influences in his work and study. Critic [[W. S. Di Piero]] noted <blockquote>Whatever the occasion, childhood, farm life, politics and culture in Northern Ireland, other poets past and present, Heaney strikes time and again at the taproot of language, examining its genetic structures, trying to discover how it has served, in all its changes, as a culture bearer, a world to contain imaginations, at once a rhetorical weapon and nutriment of spirit. He writes of these matters with rare discrimination and resourcefulness, and a winning impatience with received wisdom.<ref name=poetry_foundation/></blockquote> Heaney's first translation was of the Irish lyric poem ''[[Buile Shuibhne|Buile Suibhne]]'', published as ''Sweeney Astray: A Version from the Irish'' (1984). He took up this character and connection in poems published in ''Station Island'' (1984). Heaney's prize-winning translation of ''[[Beowulf: A New Verse Translation|Beowulf]]'' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2000, Whitbread Book of the Year Award) was considered groundbreaking in its use of modern language melded with the original Anglo-Saxon \"music\".<ref name=poetry_foundation/>\n\n===Plays and prose===\nHis plays include ''The Cure at Troy: A Version of Sophocles' Philoctetes'' (1991). Heaney's 2004 play, ''[[The Burial at Thebes]],'' suggests parallels between [[Creon]] and the foreign policies of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/arts/21weekahead.html|title=The Week Ahead: Jan. 21 \u2013 27|first=Steven|last=McElroy|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=21 January 2007|accessdate=21 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nHeaney's engagement with poetry as a necessary engine for cultural and personal change is reflected in his prose works ''The Redress of Poetry'' (1995) and ''Finders Keepers: Selected Prose, 1971\u20132001'' (2002).<ref name=poetry_foundation/> \n<blockquote>\"When a poem rhymes,\" Heaney wrote, \"when a form generates itself, when a metre provokes consciousness into new postures, it is already on the side of life. When a rhyme surprises and extends the fixed relations between words, that in itself protests against necessity. When language does more than enough, as it does in all achieved poetry, it opts for the condition of overlife, and rebels at limit.\"<ref name=toibin_human_chain/></blockquote>He continues: \"The vision of reality which poetry offers should be transformative, more than just a printout of the given circumstances of its time and place\".<ref name=toibin_human_chain/> Often overlooked and underestimated in the direction of his work is his profound poetic debts to and critical engagement with 20th-century Eastern European poets, and in particular Nobel laureate [[Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz]].<ref>Kay, Magdalena.

In addition to the publicly-announced stipulations of non-aggression, the treaty included a secret protocol, which defined the borders of Soviet and German [[spheres of influence]] across [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]] and [[Finland]]. The secret protocol also recognised the interest of Lithuania in the [[Vilno]] region, and Germany declared its complete disinterest in [[Bessarabia]]. The Secret Protocol was just a rumor until it was made public at the [[Nuremberg trials]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Senn |first1=Alfred |title=Perestroika in Lithuanian Historiography: The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact |journal=The Russian Review |date=January 1990 |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=44\u201353 |doi=10.2307/130082|jstor=130082 }}</ref>\n\nSoon after the pact was finalized, [[invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939. Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] ordered the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] on 17 September, one day after a Soviet\u2013Japanese ceasefire at the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]] came into effect.{{Sfn|Goldman|2012|pp=163\u201364}} After the invasion, the new border between the two powers was confirmed by the supplementary protocol of the [[German\u2013Soviet Frontier Treaty]]. In March 1940, parts of the [[Karelia]] and [[Salla]] regions l, in Finland, were annexed by the Soviet Union after the [[Winter War]]. That was followed by Soviet [[annexation|annexations]] of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and parts of [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] ([[Bessarabia]], Northern [[Bukovina]] and the [[Hertza region]]). Concern about ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusians had been used as pretexts for the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]]. Stalin's invasion of Bukovina in 1940 violated the pact since it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence that had been agreed with the Axis.<ref>Brackman, Roman ''The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life'' (2001) p. 341</ref>\n\nThe [[territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union]] after the 1939 Soviet invasion, east of the [[Curzon line]], remained in the [[Soviet Union]] at the end of World War II and now are parts of [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]]. The formerly-Polish Vilno region is now part of Lithuania, and the city of [[Vilnius]] is now the Lithuaian capital. Only the region around [[Bia\u0142ystok]] and a small part of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] east of the [[San River]], around [[Przemy\u015bl]], were [[Border Agreement between Poland and the USSR of 16 August 1945|returned to the Poland]]. Of all the other territories annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939 to 1940, those detached from Finland (Western [[Karelia]], [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]]), Estonia ([[Ingria#Estonian Ingria|Estonian Ingria]] and [[Petseri County]]) and Latvia ([[Abrene district|Abrene]]) remain part of [[Russia]], the [[successor state]] to the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] upon the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. The territories annexed from Romania had also been integrated into the Soviet Union (as the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian SSR]] or oblasts of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]). The core of Bessarabia now forms [[Moldova]]. The northern part of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and Hertza now form the [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] of Ukraine. [[Southern Bessarabia]] is part of the [[Odessa Oblast]], also in Ukraine.\n\nThe pact was terminated on 22 June 1941, when Germany launched [[Operation Barbarossa]] and invaded the Soviet Union thus also executing the ideological goal of ''[[Lebensraum]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/german-soviet-pact |title=German-Soviet Pact |website=[[Holocaust Encyclopedia]] |publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] |accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref> After the war, Ribbentrop was convicted of [[war crimes]] and executed. Molotov died at 96 in 1986, five years before the Soviet Union's dissolution.

Hitler's response to the political checkmate would later be heard at a rally in [[Wilhelmshaven]]: \"No power on earth would be able to break German might, and if the Western Allies thought Germany would stand by while they marshalled their '[[satellite states]]' to act in their interests, then they were sorely mistaken.\" Ultimately, Hitler's discontent with a British-Polish alliance led to a restructuring of strategy towards Moscow.

When the various departments of the Foreign Office in Berlin were evacuated to [[Thuringia]] at the end of the war, Karl von Loesch, a civil servant who had worked for the chief interpreter Paul Otto Schmidt, was entrusted with the microfilm copies. He eventually received orders to destroy the secret documents but decided to bury the metal container with the microfilms as a personal insurance for his future well-being. In May 1945, von Loesch approached the British Lieutenant Colonel Robert C. Thomson with the request to transmit a personal letter to Duncan Sandys, Churchill's son-in-law. In the letter, von Loesch revealed that he had knowledge of the documents' whereabouts but expected preferential treatment in return. Thomson and his American counterpart, Ralph Collins, agreed to transfer von Loesch to [[Marburg]], in the American zone if he would produce the microfilms.

Alfred Seidl, the attorney for defendant [[Hans Frank]], was able to place into evidence an affidavit that described them.

Later, Seidl obtained the German-language text of the secret protocols from an anonymous Allied source and attempted to place them into evidence while he was questioning witness [[Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker]], a former Foreign Office State Secretary. The Allied prosecutors objected, and the texts were not accepted into evidence, but Weizs\u00e4cker was permitted to describe them from memory, thus corroborating the Gaus affidavit. Finally, at the request of a ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' reporter, American deputy prosecutor [[Thomas J.

Sontag and James S. Beddie and published on 21 January 1948. The decision to publish the key documents on German\u2013Soviet relations, including the treaty and protocol, had been taken already in spring 1947. Sontag and Beddie prepared the collection throughout the summer of 1947.

In addition to the publicly-announced stipulations of non-aggression, the treaty included a secret protocol, which defined the borders of Soviet and German [[spheres of influence]] across [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]] and [[Finland]]. The secret protocol also recognised the interest of Lithuania in the [[Vilno]] region, and Germany declared its complete disinterest in [[Bessarabia]]. The Secret Protocol was just a rumor until it was made public at the [[Nuremberg trials]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Senn |first1=Alfred |title=Perestroika in Lithuanian Historiography: The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact |journal=The Russian Review |date=January 1990 |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=44\u201353 |doi=10.2307/130082|jstor=130082 }}</ref>\n\nSoon after the pact was finalized, [[invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939. Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] ordered the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] on 17 September, one day after a Soviet\u2013Japanese ceasefire at the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]] came into effect.{{Sfn|Goldman|2012|pp=163\u201364}} After the invasion, the new border between the two powers was confirmed by the supplementary protocol of the [[German\u2013Soviet Frontier Treaty]]. In March 1940, parts of the [[Karelia]] and [[Salla]] regions l, in Finland, were annexed by the Soviet Union after the [[Winter War]]. That was followed by Soviet [[annexation|annexations]] of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and parts of [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] ([[Bessarabia]], Northern [[Bukovina]] and the [[Hertza region]]). Concern about ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusians had been used as pretexts for the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]]. Stalin's invasion of Bukovina in 1940 violated the pact since it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence that had been agreed with the Axis.<ref>Brackman, Roman ''The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life'' (2001) p. 341</ref>\n\nThe [[territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union]] after the 1939 Soviet invasion, east of the [[Curzon line]], remained in the [[Soviet Union]] at the end of World War II and now are parts of [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]]. The formerly-Polish Vilno region is now part of Lithuania, and the city of [[Vilnius]] is now the Lithuaian capital. Only the region around [[Bia\u0142ystok]] and a small part of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] east of the [[San River]], around [[Przemy\u015bl]], were [[Border Agreement between Poland and the USSR of 16 August 1945|returned to the Poland]]. Of all the other territories annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939 to 1940, those detached from Finland (Western [[Karelia]], [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]]), Estonia ([[Ingria#Estonian Ingria|Estonian Ingria]] and [[Petseri County]]) and Latvia ([[Abrene district|Abrene]]) remain part of [[Russia]], the [[successor state]] to the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] upon the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. The territories annexed from Romania had also been integrated into the Soviet Union (as the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian SSR]] or oblasts of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]).

Nazi Party officials were led up a flight of stairs to a room with lavish furnishings. Stalin and Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov greeted the party members, much to the Nazis surprise. It was well known that Stalin avoided meeting foreign visitors and so his presence at the meeting showed how seriously the Soviets was taking the negotiations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The devils' alliance : Hitler's pact with Stalin, 1939-41|last=Roger|first=Moorhouse|isbn=9780099571896|location=London|oclc=934937192}}</ref>\n\nIn late July and early August 1939, Soviet and German officials agreed on most of the details of a planned economic agreement{{Sfn|Fest|2002|p=588}} and specifically addressed a potential political agreement,{{Sfn|Ulam|1989|pp=509\u201310}}{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|p=503}}{{Sfn|Roberts|1992a|p=64}}{{Efn|On July 28, Molotov sent a political instruction to the Soviet ambassador in Berlin that marked a start of secret Soviet\u2013German political negotiations.{{Sfn|Roberts|1992a|pp=64\u201367}}}} which the Soviets stated could only come after an economic agreement.{{Sfn|Ericson|1999|pp=54\u20135}}\n\nThe Nazi presence in the Soviet capital during negotiations can be regarded as rather tense.

Later, Seidl obtained the German-language text of the secret protocols from an anonymous Allied source and attempted to place them into evidence while he was questioning witness [[Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker]], a former Foreign Office State Secretary. The Allied prosecutors objected, and the texts were not accepted into evidence, but Weizs\u00e4cker was permitted to describe them from memory, thus corroborating the Gaus affidavit.

The decision to publish the key documents on German\u2013Soviet relations, including the treaty and protocol, had been taken already in spring 1947. Sontag and Beddie prepared the collection throughout the summer of 1947. In November 1947, Truman personally approved the publication, but it was held back in view of the Foreign Ministers Conference in London scheduled for December. Since negotiations at that conference did not prove to be constructive from an American point of view, the document edition was sent to press.

Though happily married, their life is difficult. Few years passes by and the couple now has a daughter Laya ([[Baby Anikha]]), who is now in nursery. Despite strong financial troubles, Shanavas does his best to support his family. One rainy night, on his way to purchase mangoes for his daughter, some goons kill Shanavas, having mistaken him for someone else. Having nowhere to go, Vidyalakshmi tries her best to take care of her daughter. But the financial troubles force her to reduce her daily expenses, including the school bus for her daughter. Within a short time, she is asked to vacate the house, as there has been a long delay in payment of rent. Vidyalakshmi, with nowhere to go, decides to sleep on [[Kozhikode]] Railway platform with her daughter. One fine morning, she catches an auto to drop her kid at school. Preman ([[Jayaram]]), the auto driver is a talkative and simple chap, with a sense of humour. But after travelling, she gets out of the auto and escapes without paying the cash. The next day, Preman finds her at the railway station, and when the fare is demanded, she explains her story to him, which makes him feel sympathetic to her. He brings Vidyalakshmi and her daughter to his colony. Vidyalakshmi, within a short time captures the hearts of the people at the colony. When Preman learns she was doing her MBBS when she married and had to give up studies after that, he advises her to sit for the final year exam. With the support of the colony residents, Vidyalakshmi does the MBBS examination and becomes a doctor. Her daughter, one day comes in contact with Shanavas' mother, who now wants her granddaughter returned. But Vidyalakshmi politely refuses.

Though happily married, their life is difficult. Few years passes by and the couple now has a daughter Laya ([[Baby Anikha]]), who is now in nursery. Despite strong financial troubles, Shanavas does his best to support his family. One rainy night, on his way to purchase mangoes for his daughter, some goons kill Shanavas, having mistaken him for someone else. Having nowhere to go, Vidyalakshmi tries her best to take care of her daughter. But the financial troubles force her to reduce her daily expenses, including the school bus for her daughter. Within a short time, she is asked to vacate the house, as there has been a long delay in payment of rent. Vidyalakshmi, with nowhere to go, decides to sleep on [[Kozhikode]] Railway platform with her daughter. One fine morning, she catches an auto to drop her kid at school. Preman ([[Jayaram]]), the auto driver is a talkative and simple chap, with a sense of humour. But after travelling, she gets out of the auto and escapes without paying the cash. The next day, Preman finds her at the railway station, and when the fare is demanded, she explains her story to him, which makes him feel sympathetic to her. He brings Vidyalakshmi and her daughter to his colony. Vidyalakshmi, within a short time captures the hearts of the people at the colony. When Preman learns she was doing her MBBS when she married and had to give up studies after that, he advises her to sit for the final year exam. With the support of the colony residents, Vidyalakshmi does the MBBS examination and becomes a doctor. Her daughter, one day comes in contact with Shanavas' mother, who now wants her granddaughter returned. But Vidyalakshmi politely refuses. The elder brother of Shanavas then threatens her with the support of Moulavi, but Preman intervenes and force them to go back.

In 1966, he attended [[Northwestern University|Northwestern University in Evanston]], Illinois, to pursue a Masters, and later a Doctorate degree in social psychology. He then returned to the Philippines in 1971 to continue teaching psychology. [[Filipino psychology]] was created because he noticed that scholars and intellectuals in the Philippines were dissatisfied with the Western-oriented take on psychology as their models did not fit with Filipino culture and behavior. As such, he focused more on a Filipino-oriented teaching model in his teaching and research including using Filipino to lecture and exam.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Pe\u2010Pua|first=Rogelia|last2=Protacio\u2010Marcelino|first2=Elizabeth A.|date=2000|title=Sikolohiyang Pilipino (Filipino psychology): A legacy of Virgilio G.

He also said that a Filipino can better understand himself and in turn, is able to improve his life more. Different from traditional psychology, Filipino psychology identifies what the key concepts are in order to have an understanding of a Filipino's mind, personality and behaviour, while also looking at human behaviour from non-western culture context.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=PhD|first=Elizabeth Protacio Marcelino|date=1990-05-25|title=Towards Understanding the Psychology of the Filipino|journal=Women & Therapy|volume=9|issue=1\u20132|pages=105\u2013128|doi=10.1300/J015v09n01_07|issn=0270-3149}}</ref>  \n\nFilipino psychology \"began in the early 1970s initially as a protest against Philippine psychology's colonial character and the uncritical acceptance of American psychological models.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> It \u201curges Filipino psychologists to confront social problems and national issues as part of their responsibility as social scientists.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> A way to understand the Filipino character, it is helpful to analyze the social interaction in a Philippine setting.<ref name=\":1\" /> A conceptual distinction in many different levels and modes of interaction is provided by the Filipino language.<ref name=\":1\" /> There are 8 levels of interaction that were found by Santiago and Enriquez; these levels include pakikitungo (transaction/civility with), pakikisalamuha (interaction with), pakikilahok (joining/participating with), pakikibagay (in conformity with/in accord with), pakikisama (getting along with), pakikipag-palagayang-Ioob (having rapport with), pakikisangkot (getting involved with), and pakikiisa (being one with).\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> Enriquez coined the term 'kapwa', and he believes it to be the only term that both categories of \"outsider\" (ibang tao) and \"insider\" (hindi ibang tao).<ref name=\":1\" /> He used this term to \u201cexplain Filipino interpersonal relations.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> The English word \"others\" is what is thought to be the closest English equivalent of \"kapwa.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Although \u201ckapwa\" is similar, it means the unity of the \u2018self\u2019 and the \u2018others\u2019.<ref name=\":1\" /> A prominent student of Enriquez, Katrin de Guia also studied kapwa and asserted that it is the shared identity between the self and others.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reyes|first=Jeremiah|date=2015-04-03|title=Lo\u00f3b and Kapwa: An Introduction to a Filipino Virtue Ethics|journal=Asian Philosophy|volume=25|issue=2|pages=148\u2013171|doi=10.1080/09552367.2015.1043173|issn=0955-2367}}</ref> \n\n=== Indigenous Psychology ===\nVirgilio Enriquez was a prominent advocate of [[indigenous psychology]] in [[Asia]].

Their research model is made up of two scales that exist on a continuum including ''Iskala ng Mananaliksik'' as well as ''Iskala ng Pagtutunguhan ng Mananaliksik at Kalahok''.

Similar to many countries who are also colonized, there is a sense of identity loss and cultural theft as adaptation to Western practices occur.

As such, he focused more on a Filipino-oriented teaching model in his teaching and research including using Filipino to lecture and exam.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Pe\u2010Pua|first=Rogelia|last2=Protacio\u2010Marcelino|first2=Elizabeth A.|date=2000|title=Sikolohiyang Pilipino (Filipino psychology): A legacy of Virgilio G.

He also said that a Filipino can better understand himself and in turn, is able to improve his life more. Different from traditional psychology, Filipino psychology identifies what the key concepts are in order to have an understanding of a Filipino's mind, personality and behaviour, while also looking at human behaviour from non-western culture context.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=PhD|first=Elizabeth Protacio Marcelino|date=1990-05-25|title=Towards Understanding the Psychology of the Filipino|journal=Women & Therapy|volume=9|issue=1\u20132|pages=105\u2013128|doi=10.1300/J015v09n01_07|issn=0270-3149}}</ref>  \n\nFilipino psychology \"began in the early 1970s initially as a protest against Philippine psychology's colonial character and the uncritical acceptance of American psychological models.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> It \u201curges Filipino psychologists to confront social problems and national issues as part of their responsibility as social scientists.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> A way to understand the Filipino character, it is helpful to analyze the social interaction in a Philippine setting.<ref name=\":1\" /> A conceptual distinction in many different levels and modes of interaction is provided by the Filipino language.<ref name=\":1\" /> There are 8 levels of interaction that were found by Santiago and Enriquez; these levels include pakikitungo (transaction/civility with), pakikisalamuha (interaction with), pakikilahok (joining/participating with), pakikibagay (in conformity with/in accord with), pakikisama (getting along with), pakikipag-palagayang-Ioob (having rapport with), pakikisangkot (getting involved with), and pakikiisa (being one with).\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> Enriquez coined the term 'kapwa', and he believes it to be the only term that both categories of \"outsider\" (ibang tao) and \"insider\" (hindi ibang tao).<ref name=\":1\" /> He used this term to \u201cexplain Filipino interpersonal relations.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> The English word \"others\" is what is thought to be the closest English equivalent of \"kapwa.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Although \u201ckapwa\" is similar, it means the unity of the \u2018self\u2019 and the \u2018others\u2019.<ref name=\":1\" /> A prominent student of Enriquez, Katrin de Guia also studied kapwa and asserted that it is the shared identity between the self and others.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reyes|first=Jeremiah|date=2015-04-03|title=Lo\u00f3b and Kapwa: An Introduction to a Filipino Virtue Ethics|journal=Asian Philosophy|volume=25|issue=2|pages=148\u2013171|doi=10.1080/09552367.2015.1043173|issn=0955-2367}}</ref> \n\n=== Indigenous Psychology ===\nVirgilio Enriquez was a prominent advocate of [[indigenous psychology]] in [[Asia]]. This academic movement arose from Western psychology's lack of applicability to non-Western societies and thereby promoted cultural sensitivity and appropriateness within psychology by enabling each culture to develop their own frameworks and methodologies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Kuo-Shu|date=2000|title=Monocultural and cross-cultural indigenous approaches: The royal road to the development of a balanced global psychology|url=|journal=Asian Journal of Social Psychology|volume=3|issue=3|pages=241\u2013263|doi=10.1111/1467-839X.00067}}</ref> Enriquez coined the term ''culture-as-source'' to indicate that every culture is a contributor to psychological knowledge, contrasting from the approach he referred to ''as culture-as-target'' which regards cultures as being dependent on other cultures to gain psychological knowledge.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Church|first=A.

Their research model is made up of two scales that exist on a continuum including ''Iskala ng Mananaliksik'' as well as ''Iskala ng Pagtutunguhan ng Mananaliksik at Kalahok''. The former being the researcher/method scale where the observational methods are unobtrusive such as ''pagmamasid'', where no manipulation occurs, rather the investigator solely observes the natural environment.<ref name=\":2\" /> The latter being the researcher-participant relationship scale that is regarded as more intrusive, involving a stronger relationship between the respondents and the investigators. For instance, multiple encounters in the respondents\u2019 home involving participant interviewing take place, referred to as ''padalaw-dala w.''<ref name=\":2\" /> Techniques that lie in the center of the continuum, including the ''pagtatanung-tanong'' research model entails casual interaction between both parties. It incorporates a combination of surveys and informant interviewing where questions are asked to different respondents in random order.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Allwood|first=Carl Martin|date=2002|title=Indigenized psychologies|journal=Social Epistemology|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=349\u2013366|doi=10.1080/0269172022000064621|issn=0269-1728}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=David Y.

Most notably in 1982, he was given the Outstanding Young Scientist of the Philippines award by the [[National Academy of Science and Technology]], and after his passing was awarded the National Achievement in the Social Sciences in 1997 from the National Research Council of the Philippines.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n=== Contributions ===\nEnriquez made several substantial contributions to the field of psychology, particularly in relation to Filipino values and society. Similar to many countries who are also colonized, there is a sense of identity loss and cultural theft as adaptation to Western practices occur. After getting his Ph.D. in the US, Enriquez returned to the Philippines to create new teaching methods in collaboration with the University of the Philippines with the goal of taking a deeper look at \u201cPhilippine psychology and developing creativity and inventiveness among Filipinos.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> On this path of education and research, Enriquez helped to officiate the First National Conference on Filipino Psychology (Unang Pambansang Kumperensya sa Sikolohiyang Pilipino) as well as created the Philippine Psychology Research House (PPRH), later known as the Philippine Psychology Research and Training House, home to Filipino psychology and the growth of research with Filipino perspective.<ref name=\":0\" />  \n\n=== Publications ===\nEnriquez is also well known for the numerous books he authored throughout his career such as Indigenous Psychology and National Consciousness (Enriquez, 1989) to his final publication Pagbabangong-Dangal: Indigenous Psychology & Cultural Empowerment (Enriquez, 1994). Areas of his research included \u201cindigienous psychology, Filipino personality, psychology of language and politics, philosophy and values, [[Cross-cultural psychology|cross-cultural psychology,]] and [[Filipinology|Pilipinolohiya]] (Philippine Studies).\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Later life ===\nEnriquez went on to become Chairman of the Department of Psychology at the University of the Philippines from 1977-1982. He continued to inspire and encourage students to embrace the Filipino language and culture, furthering the growth of Filipino psychology and continuity of the national language. He died at the age of 51 on August 31, 1994 in San Francisco, California due to cancer.<ref name=\":0\" />  \n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Enriquez, Virgilio}}\n[[Category:Filipino educators]]\n[[Category:Filipino psychologists]]\n[[Category:Psychology writers]]\n[[Category:People from Bulacan]]\n[[Category:University of the Philippines alumni]]\n[[Category:University of the Philippines faculty]]\n[[Category:1942 births]]\n[[Category:1994 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century Filipino medical doctors]]\n[[Category:20th-century Filipino writers]]\n", "name_user": "MB", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix infobox image syntax", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgilio_Enriquez"}
