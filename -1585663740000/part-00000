It is one of the largest paved squares in the United Kingdom.\n\nLocated in the heart of [[Nottingham City Centre]], the square is bounded by [[Beastmarket Hill]] to the West, [[Long Row]] to the North, and [[South Parade, Nottingham|South Parade]] to the South. The Eastern end of the square is dominated by the [[Nottingham Council House|Council House]], which served as Nottingham's [[town hall]] until 2010.<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loxley_House,_Nottingham Loxley House]</ref>\n\nThe nature of the square means it is often used for large local events, fairs, concerts and exhibitions.\n\n==History==\nThe early market square, from the 11th Century until 1928, covered an area of about 5.5 acres (22,260 square metres), with its narrow western edge near Mount Street, broadening out to its eastern edge, adjacent to High Street. The perimeter then, being formed by what is now: [[Long Row|Long Row West]], [[Long Row]], [[Long Row|Long Row East]], High Street, [[Poultry, Nottingham|Poultry]], [[South Parade, Nottingham|South Parade]], [[Beastmarket Hill]], and Angel Row.<ref>[https://nottinghamhiddenhistoryteam.wordpress.com/2014/01/02/nottinghams-old-market-square/ Hidden History]</ref> Because of its size during these several centuries, it was frequently referred to as the, 'Great Market Place'.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/articles/tts/tts1931/itinerary1931p2.htm Thoroton]</ref>\n\nThe square has long been at the centre of Nottingham life. In the early days before the [[City of Nottingham]] was formed, the area was the centre-point between the [[Normans|Norman]] town of Nottingham, situated around the Castle Rock, and the old [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] town which was based around the current [[Lace Market]] at [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham|St. Mary's Church]], also called Snothryngham, Snottingaham or Snottingham.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/swinnerton1910/chapter1.htm Nottinghamshire history > Cambridge County Geographies: Nottinghamshire, (1910)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The central point between the two towns became a major market point, and hence the square has been at the centre of Nottingham's growth around it for hundreds of years since. The two towns were once divided by a wall. The old positioning of this historic wall was reinstated when the square was redesigned in the 2000s, with a stainless steel drainage channel down the centre of the Square. This marks the Wall that divided the livestock from the agricultural feed and foodstuffs.\n\nThe square was the original setting of [[Nottingham Goose Fair]], an annual fair held in October originating over 700 years ago. The Goose Fair was moved in 1928 for redevelopment of the square.\n\nThe square was the location of [[Smith's Bank]] which, established in 1688, was the earliest provincial bank in England. Its successor, the [[National Westminster Bank]], is still located in the same premises.\n\nWhen the [[Nottingham Exchange]] was demolished and the new [[Nottingham Council House]] built, the Square was redesigned in 1927 with several platforms creating a central procession way. However, the decline in the quality, changes in function, and issues surrounding disabled access spurred a City Council-led international redevelopment competition in 2003 known as [http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/features/2004/03/old_market_square_designs_introduction.shtml Square One].\n\nThe Square continues to be affectionately nicknamed, 'Slab Square', which is a colloquialism and an accurate description, owing to the high number of concrete slabs that made up the former Square, and the high number in place after the 2007 redesign.<ref>[https://www.agefotostock.com/age/en/Stock-Images/Rights-Managed/X9Y-1152789 Pre 2007]</ref><ref>[https://www.picturesofengland.com/England/Nottinghamshire/Nottingham/pictures/1168323 Post 2007]</ref> There was a mosaic of the city [[coat of arms]] in front of the Council House on the square.

Work began in 2005. The Square was scheduled to reopen before the end of 2006, but following delays reopened in March 2007.\n\nHistorically the Square forms a meeting place for the people of Nottingham and is also the location for local events, civic protests, royal visits, celebrations, and public mourning. A number of Nottingham's defining moments have taken place in the Square.\n\nOne of the most significant civil protests to start here was the protest by [[Luddites]] (a social movement of British textile artisans) in the early nineteenth century, who protested growth in industrial machinery which was seen to be taking jobs. This protest eventually led to the destruction by fire of the [[4th Duke of Newcastle]]\u2019s mansion house, which was built for the 2nd Duke in 1679 on the remaining foundations of the earlier medieval castle.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/gill1904/dismantled.htm Gill Notts History]</ref> The mansion house, the grounds, and the remaining fortifications including the renovated gatehouse, are [[colloquially]] known as, \u2018[[Nottingham Castle]]\u2019 or simply, \u2018the Castle\u2019.

The Nottingham [[Christmas lights (holiday decoration)|Christmas Lights]] switch-on event also takes place here.\n\nIn February 2008, a [[Ferris wheel]] was installed in Market Square.

There was a period during the 1950s\u20131960s when there were four flowerbeds, but no fountains. \n\nSubsequently, in the 1960s, the two squares flanking the central processional way at the east end, were rebuilt as two pools with a multiple fountain display in each. These remained until the redesign by [[Kathryn Gustafson]] which was completed in 2007, when new fountains and water feature, were added at the west end of the new square.<ref>[http://www.gp-b.com/old-market-square Gustafson Porter + Bowman]</ref>\n\n===Tram stop===\nOn the southern side of the Market Square, along South Parade, is [[Nottingham Express Transit]]\u2019s [[Old Market Square tram stop]]. The two tram lines run in both directions, skirting around the edge of the main square from Market Street in the north west and along South Parade towards [[Hockley Village|Hockley]].

It was the first official Speakers\u2019 Corner outside London. It is located on a new extension to the Market Square, which was added at the junction of King Street and Queen Street; with landscaping, planting, and a new memorial to [[Brian Clough]]. Due in part to the success of the Nottingham 'Corner', there are new plans for similar projects in [[Lichfield]] and [[Prague]].<ref>[http://www.speakerscornertrust.org/projects/nottingham Speakers\u2019 Corner Trust: Nottingham]</ref>\n\n==Redesign==\n[[Image:Old Market Square Dig Up.JPG|thumb|200px|Old Market Square during redesign]]\nRedesigned by Gustafson Porter in 2004 and completed in March 2007, the Old Market Square renovations cost taxpayers around 17 million pounds. Not a single building was erected or demolished; the majority of the money was spent on granite paving stones and is built with three shades of granite. The central open space is a light coloured granite, with white, beige and dark grey granite used for the fountains, terraces and flowerbeds.\nThe final slab prior to the reopening was laid by the Lord Mayor.\n\nThe new square is a single tier area, including the re-creation of an ancient border which once divided Nottingham. A new water feature dominates the west side of the Square, with jet fountains and waterfalls.\n\nThe square was designed to host public events and since the opening in 2007 a variety of successful events have been held including concerts and parades, [[May Day]] and [[St George's Day]] celebrations, cycling events, and a regular local [[farmers' market]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2007/12/17/highlights_2007_feature.shtml|title = Highlights of 2007 |  publisher = BBC | date = 17 December 2007 | accessdate = 22 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Old Market Square, Nottingham}}\n*[http://www.nottingham21.co.uk/street_old_market_square_thumbnail.htm The NEW Old Market Square in Pictures \u2013 from Nottingham21]\n*[http://oldmarketsquare.org.uk/ Old Market Square] Official website, including images of the new square\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/6761629.stm Repair to leaking fountain] (BBC Online)\n*[http://www.risepark.plus.com/market_square.html Market square information and slides show \u2013 from Rise Park Nottingham]\n\n{{Nottingham Places of Interest |state=autocollapse}}\n\n{{coord|52|57|12|N|1|09|01|W|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Squares in England]]\n[[Category:Streets in Nottingham]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Market Square (disambiguation)}}{{More citations needed|date=June 2019}}[[File:Great Days out in Nottingham.jpg|thumb]]\n{{Use British English|date=January 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n[[Image:Nottingham Council House from the square.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Nottingham Council House from the square]]\n[[File:Old Market Square.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Looking north along [[Long Row]]]]\nThe '''Old Market Square''' (Slab Square) is an open, pedestrianised [[city square]] in [[Nottingham]], England, forming the heart of the city, and covering an area of approximately {{Convert|12000|m2|sqft}}, or about 3 acres.

These remained until the redesign by [[Kathryn Gustafson]] which was completed in 2007, when new fountains and water feature, were added at the west end of the new square.<ref>[http://www.gp-b.com/old-market-square Gustafson Porter + Bowman]</ref>\n\n===Tram stop===\nOn the southern side of the Market Square, along South Parade, is [[Nottingham Express Transit]]\u2019s [[Old Market Square tram stop]]. The two tram lines run in both directions, skirting around the edge of the main square from Market Street in the north west and along South Parade towards [[Hockley Village|Hockley]]. The Market Square was once at the heart of the city's road network; today it is closed to all traffic except buses along Beast Market Hill and the tram.\n\n===Speaker's Corner===\n{{Main|Speakers' Corner#Nottingham|l1=Nottingham Speakers\u2019 Corner}}\n\nOn 22 February 2009 Nottingham\u2019s [[Speaker's Corner]] was officially opened by [[Jack Straw]] (at the time, UK Justice Secretary). It was the first official Speakers\u2019 Corner outside London. It is located on a new extension to the Market Square, which was added at the junction of King Street and Queen Street; with landscaping, planting, and a new memorial to [[Brian Clough]]. Due in part to the success of the Nottingham 'Corner', there are new plans for similar projects in [[Lichfield]] and [[Prague]].<ref>[http://www.speakerscornertrust.org/projects/nottingham Speakers\u2019 Corner Trust: Nottingham]</ref>\n\n==Redesign==\n[[Image:Old Market Square Dig Up.JPG|thumb|200px|Old Market Square during redesign]]\nRedesigned by Gustafson Porter in 2004 and completed in March 2007, the Old Market Square renovations cost taxpayers around 17 million pounds. Not a single building was erected or demolished; the majority of the money was spent on granite paving stones and is built with three shades of granite. The central open space is a light coloured granite, with white, beige and dark grey granite used for the fountains, terraces and flowerbeds.\nThe final slab prior to the reopening was laid by the Lord Mayor.\n\nThe new square is a single tier area, including the re-creation of an ancient border which once divided Nottingham. A new water feature dominates the west side of the Square, with jet fountains and waterfalls.\n\nThe square was designed to host public events and since the opening in 2007 a variety of successful events have been held including concerts and parades, [[May Day]] and [[St George's Day]] celebrations, cycling events, and a regular local [[farmers' market]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2007/12/17/highlights_2007_feature.shtml|title = Highlights of 2007 |  publisher = BBC | date = 17 December 2007 | accessdate = 22 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Old Market Square, Nottingham}}\n*[http://www.nottingham21.co.uk/street_old_market_square_thumbnail.htm The NEW Old Market Square in Pictures \u2013 from Nottingham21]\n*[http://oldmarketsquare.org.uk/ Old Market Square] Official website, including images of the new square\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/6761629.stm Repair to leaking fountain] (BBC Online)\n*[http://www.risepark.plus.com/market_square.html Market square information and slides show \u2013 from Rise Park Nottingham]\n\n{{Nottingham Places of Interest |state=autocollapse}}\n\n{{coord|52|57|12|N|1|09|01|W|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Squares in England]]\n[[Category:Streets in Nottingham]]\n", "name_user": "Fropilog", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:dimension", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Market_Square"}

However, journals with very high impact factors are often based on a small number of very highly cited papers. For instance, most papers in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] (impact factor 38.1, 2016) were \"only\" cited 10 or 20 times during the reference year (see figure). Journals with a \"low\" impact (e.g. [[PLOS One]], impact factor 3.1) publish many papers that are cited 0 to 5 times but few highly cited articles.<ref name = \"Callaway2016\"/>\n\nJIFs are often mis-interpreted as a measure for journal quality or even article quality. The JIF is a journal-level metric, not an article-level metric, hence its use to determine the impact of a single article is statistically invalid. Citation distribution is skewed for journals because a very small number of articles is driving the vast majority of citations (see figure). Therefore, some journals have stopped publicizing their impact factor, e.g. the journals of the [[American Society for Microbiology]].<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n |last=Casadevall |first=A.\n |last2=Bertuzzi |first2=S.\n |last3=Buchmeier |first3=M.

However, journals with very high impact factors are often based on a small number of very highly cited papers. For instance, most papers in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] (impact factor 38.1, 2016) were \"only\" cited 10 or 20 times during the reference year (see figure). Journals with a \"low\" impact (e.g. [[PLOS One]], impact factor 3.1) publish many papers that are cited 0 to 5 times but few highly cited articles.<ref name = \"Callaway2016\"/>\n\nJIFs are often mis-interpreted as a measure for journal quality or even article quality. The JIF is a journal-level metric, not an article-level metric, hence its use to determine the impact of a single article is statistically invalid. Citation distribution is skewed for journals because a very small number of articles is driving the vast majority of citations (see figure). Therefore, some journals have stopped publicizing their impact factor, e.g. the journals of the [[American Society for Microbiology]].<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n |last=Casadevall |first=A.\n |last2=Bertuzzi |first2=S.\n |last3=Buchmeier |first3=M.

For example, it has been shown that the number of citations received by a publication, once properly rescaled by its average across articles published in the same discipline and in the same year, follows a universal [[log-normal distribution]] that is the same in every discipline.<ref name=Radicchi2008>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Radicchi |first=F.\n |last2=Fortunato |first2=S.\n |last3=Castellano |first3=C.\n |date=2008\n |title=Universality of citation distributions: Toward an objective measure of scientific impact\n |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]]\n |volume=105 |issue=45 |pages=17268\u201317272\n |arxiv=0806.0974\n |bibcode=2008PNAS..10517268R\n |doi=10.1073/pnas.0806977105\n |pmc=2582263\n |pmid=18978030\n}}</ref> This finding has suggested a ''universal citation impact measure'' that extends the h-index by properly rescaling citation counts and resorting publications, however the computation of such a universal measure requires the collection of extensive citation data and statistics for every discipline and year.

It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in [[Eastern Europe]]. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s. The event was praised for the quality of football but criticised for being a distraction from [[Doping in Russia|doping allegations]] and public relations within Russia. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n==Host selection==\n{{Main|Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid}}\n[[File:Russia 2018 World Cup.jpeg|thumb|Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.jpg|thumb|President [[Vladimir Putin]] holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] at a pre-tournament ceremony in Moscow on 9&nbsp;September 2017]]\n[[File:Russia 100 Rubles 2018 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|The 100-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

/>\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.<ref name=\":0\" /> Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.<ref name=\"nh0b0\" /> On 15&nbsp;June 2018, [[Diego Costa]]'s goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision;<ref name=\"isPIb\" /> the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16&nbsp;June and resulted in a goal by [[Antoine Griezmann]].<ref name=\"iQyFC\" /> A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.<ref name=\"zeD2b\" /> Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.<ref name=\"neijv\" /> FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.<ref name=\"swBxZ\" />\n\n==Venues==\nRussia proposed the following host cities: [[Kaliningrad]], [[Kazan]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Moscow]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Samara]], [[Saransk]], [[Sochi]], [[Volgograd]], [[Yaroslavl]], and [[Yekaterinburg]].<ref name=\"b9r6N\" /> Each city was located in [[European Russia]], except [[Yekaterinburg]],<ref name=\"S3sSt\" /> which is located very close to the Europe-Asia border, to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country. The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA's minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\"<ref name=\"Z1hqZ\" />\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of the proposed [[Podolsk]] stadium in the Moscow region was cancelled by the regional government. Also, in the capital, [[Otkritie Arena]] was competing with [[VTB Arena|Dynamo Stadium]] over which would be constructed first.<ref name=\"8DESn\" />{{dead link|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29&nbsp;September 2012. The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8&nbsp;billion was spent on hosting the tournament.<ref name=\"VKrDx\" />\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.<ref name=\"Sy4OR\" /> He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums [[2010 FIFA World Cup|in South Africa]], where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".<ref name=\"saakov\" />\n[[File:EstadioCentral2017-01-26.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Yekaterinburg Central Stadium in January 2017]] \nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA's inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues. They were satisfied with the progress.<ref name=\"u01d8\" /> On 8&nbsp;October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.<ref name=\"AL037\" /> Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium\u2014the two largest stadiums in Russia\u2014were used most; both hosted seven matches. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Spartak Stadium in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each. Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\n===Stadiums===\n[[File:Bel-Tun (26).jpg|thumb|{{Center|Exterior of Otkrytie Arena}}{{Center| in Moscow}}]]\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.

The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian [[Spartakiad]], but the plan was revised. The opening was rescheduled to 2017. The arena hosted its first match on 21&nbsp;April 2018.\n* Sochi: Fisht Stadium (renovated). This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.\n* Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new). The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished [[Central Stadium (Volgograd)|Central Stadium]] site, at the foot of the [[Mamayev Kurgan]] memorial complex. It was commissioned on 3&nbsp;April 2018.<ref name=\"j2Lhd\" />\n* Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (renovated). The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.

Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]]. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.<ref name=\"APfire\" /> Garcia criticised the summary as being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", and appealed to FIFA's Appeal Committee.<ref name=\"K7Ghy\" /><ref name=\"WhatNow\" /> The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned in protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lack of confidence in the independence of Eckert.<ref name=\"0U57X\" />\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the [[FBI]] confirmed that the federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cups]].<ref name=\"r8Bz2\" /><ref name=\"lgRB1\" /> In an interview published on 7 June 2015, [[Domenico Scala (manager)|Domenico Scala]], the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".<ref name=\"BBC News\" /><ref name=\"Owen Gibson\" /> [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] and former British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president [[Chung Mong-joon]] in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]] was discussed.<ref name=\"SNVa0\" /><ref name=\"oJlN3\" />\n\n===Response to Skripal poisoning===\nIn response to the March 2018 [[poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal]], British Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.<ref name=\"AypwF\" /> Iceland diplomatically boycotted the World Cup.<ref name=\"1CS7B\" /> Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that \"the west are trying to deny Russia the World Cup\".<ref name=\"aXQLQ\" /> The [[Russian Foreign Ministry]] denounced [[Boris Johnson]]'s statements that compared the event to the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] held in [[Nazi Germany]] as \"poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness\" and \"unacceptable and unworthy\" parallel towards Russia, a \"nation that [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism]]\".<ref name=\"0aw0J\" />\n\nThe British [[Foreign Office]] and MPs had repeatedly warned English football fans and \"people of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent\" travelling to Russia of \"racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility\".<ref name=\"qKSXy\" /><ref name=\"WNLwc\" /> English football fans who have travelled have said they have received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.<ref name=\"sOFhm\" /><ref name=\"XWjIW\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[File:2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony (2018-06-14) 11.jpg|thumb|Russia received widespread praise as World Cup hosts.

After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut on each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being upconverted from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to indirectly negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of coverage for the tournament.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014, additionally citing match scheduling that was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas than 2014 (with many matches airing in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history).<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to [[Japan\u2013North Korea relations|strained relations and campaigns against the country]].<ref name=\"iscoP\"

football|football]] tournament contested by [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] and took place between 14&nbsp;June and 15&nbsp;July 2018 in Russia. It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in [[Eastern Europe]]. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s. The event was praised for the quality of football but criticised for being a distraction from [[Doping in Russia|doping allegations]] and public relations within Russia. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n==Host selection==\n{{Main|Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid}}\n[[File:Russia 2018 World Cup.jpeg|thumb|Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.jpg|thumb|President [[Vladimir Putin]] holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] at a pre-tournament ceremony in Moscow on 9&nbsp;September 2017]]\n[[File:Russia 100 Rubles 2018 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|The 100-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.<ref name=\"xBccj\" />\n\nThe 22-member [[FIFA Council|FIFA Executive Committee]] convened in [[Z\u00fcrich]] on 2&nbsp;December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.<ref name=\"WFQKr\" /> Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting. The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third. England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.<ref name=\"kKxiB\" />\n\nThe voting results were:<ref name=\"xBccj\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2018 FIFA bidding (majority 12 votes)\n!rowspan=2|Bidders\n!colspan=2|Votes\n|-\n!Round 1\n!Round 2\n|-\n|'''Russia'''\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|9\n|{{yes|13}}\n|-\n|Portugal / Spain\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|7\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|7\n|-\n|Belgium / Netherlands\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|4\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2\n|-\n|England\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2\n|{{no result|Eliminated}}\n|}\n\n===Criticism===\nThe English [[Football Association]] (FA) and others raised concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members. They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and [[Sepp Blatter]] had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.<ref name=\"sRBCC\" /> The 2014 [[Garcia Report]], an internal investigation led by [[Michael J. Garcia]], was withheld from public release by [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]], FIFA's head of adjudication on ethical matters. Eckert released a shorter revised summary instead, and his (and therefore FIFA's) reluctance to publish the full report caused Garcia to resign in protest.<ref name=\"3BhYq\" /> Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving Russia from blame. [[Greg Dyke]] called for a re-examination of the affair and [[David Bernstein (executive)|David Bernstein]] called for a boycott of the World Cup.<ref name=\"zt9ZM\" /><ref name=\"2xMiJ\" />\n\n==Teams==\n\n===Qualification===\n{{Main|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification}}\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations\u2014the 209 [[List of FIFA Member Associations|FIFA member associations]] except automatically qualified hosts Russia\u2014applied to enter the qualifying process.<ref name=\"riaYh\" /> [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] and [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] were later disqualified before playing their first matches,<ref name=\"zimbabwe\" /><ref name=\"indonesia\" /> while [[Gibraltar national football team|Gibraltar]] and [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]], who joined FIFA on 13&nbsp;May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.<ref name=\"k8fRX\" /> Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.<ref name=\"fifa20150320\" /><ref name=\"hstri\" /> The first qualification game, between [[Timor-Leste national football team|Timor-Leste]] and [[Mongolia national football team|Mongolia]], began in [[Dili]] on 12&nbsp;March 2015 as part of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|AFC's qualification]],<ref name=\"45Ip9\" /> and the main qualifying draw took place at the [[Konstantinovsky Palace]] in [[Strelna]], [[Saint Petersburg]], on 25&nbsp;July 2015.<ref name=\"L1urj\" /><ref name=\"crlmz\" /><ref name=\"lzli9\" /><ref name=\"press release\" />\n\nOf the 32&nbsp;nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20&nbsp;countries competed at the previous tournament in [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]].

It was the first time three [[Nordic countries]] (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four [[Arab world|Arab nations]] (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.<ref name=\"vviY2\" />\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]] (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden, and three-time runners-up and third placed in 2014 the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] (for the first time since 2002).

the [[International Football Association Board]]'s decision to incorporate [[video assistant referee]]s (VARs) into the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the game]] (LOTG) on

/>\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.<ref name=\":0\" /> Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.<ref name=\"nh0b0\" /> On 15&nbsp;June 2018, [[Diego Costa]]'s goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision;<ref name=\"isPIb\" /> the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16&nbsp;June and resulted in a goal by [[Antoine Griezmann]].<ref name=\"iQyFC\" /> A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.<ref name=\"zeD2b\" /> Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.<ref name=\"neijv\" /> FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.<ref name=\"swBxZ\" />\n\n==Venues==\nRussia proposed the following host cities: [[Kaliningrad]], [[Kazan]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Moscow]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Samara]], [[Saransk]], [[Sochi]], [[Volgograd]], [[Yaroslavl]], and [[Yekaterinburg]].<ref name=\"b9r6N\" /> Each city was located in [[European Russia]], except [[Yekaterinburg]],<ref name=\"S3sSt\" /> which is located very close to the Europe-Asia border, to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country. The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA's minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\"<ref name=\"Z1hqZ\" />\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of the proposed [[Podolsk]] stadium in the Moscow region was cancelled by the regional government. Also, in the capital, [[Otkritie Arena]] was competing with [[VTB Arena|Dynamo Stadium]] over which would be constructed first.<ref name=\"8DESn\" />{{dead link|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29&nbsp;September 2012. The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8&nbsp;billion was spent on hosting the tournament.<ref name=\"VKrDx\" />\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.<ref name=\"Sy4OR\" /> He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums [[2010 FIFA World Cup|in South Africa]], where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".<ref name=\"saakov\" />\n[[File:EstadioCentral2017-01-26.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Yekaterinburg Central Stadium in January 2017]] \nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA's inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues. They were satisfied with the progress.<ref name=\"u01d8\" /> On 8&nbsp;October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.<ref name=\"AL037\" /> Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium\u2014the two largest stadiums in Russia\u2014were used most; both hosted seven matches. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Spartak Stadium in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each. Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\n===Stadiums===\n[[File:Bel-Tun (26).jpg|thumb|Exterior of Otkrytie Arena in Moscow]]\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.

The stadium was commissioned in November 2017.\n* Moscow: Spartak Stadium (new). The stadium is a home arena to its namesake [[FC Spartak Moscow]]. In accordance with the FIFA requirements, during the 2018 World Cup it is called Spartak Stadium instead of its usual name Otkritie Arena. The stadium hosted its first match on 5 September 2014.\n* Nizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new). The construction of the Nizhny Novgorod Stadium commenced in 2015. The project was completed in December 2017.<ref name=\"L1mHo\" />\n* Rostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new). The stadium is located on the left bank of the Don River. The stadium construction was completed on 22 December 2017.\n* Saint Petersburg: Saint Petersburg Stadium (new).

The construction officially started on 21 July 2014. The project was completed on 21 April 2018.\n* Saransk: Mordovia Arena (new). The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised. The opening was rescheduled to 2017. The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.\n* Sochi: Fisht Stadium (renovated). The stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 World Cup.\n* Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new). The main arena of Volgograd was built on the demolished [[Central Stadium (Volgograd)|Central Stadium]] site, at the foot of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex. The stadium was commissioned on 3 April 2018.<ref name=\"j2Lhd\" />\n* Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (renovated). The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg has been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.

Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]]. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.<ref name=\"APfire\" /> Garcia criticised the summary as being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", and appealed to FIFA's Appeal Committee.<ref name=\"K7Ghy\" /><ref name=\"WhatNow\" /> The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned in protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lack of confidence in the independence of Eckert.<ref name=\"0U57X\" />\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the [[FBI]] confirmed that the federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cups]].<ref name=\"r8Bz2\" /><ref name=\"lgRB1\" /> In an interview published on 7 June 2015, [[Domenico Scala (manager)|Domenico Scala]], the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".<ref name=\"BBC News\" /><ref name=\"Owen Gibson\" /> [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] and former British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president [[Chung Mong-joon]] in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]] was discussed.<ref name=\"SNVa0\" /><ref name=\"oJlN3\" />\n\n===Response to Skripal poisoning===\nIn response to the March 2018 [[poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal]], British Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.<ref name=\"AypwF\" /> Iceland diplomatically boycotted the World Cup.<ref name=\"1CS7B\" /> Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that \"the west are trying to deny Russia the World Cup\".<ref name=\"aXQLQ\" /> The [[Russian Foreign Ministry]] denounced [[Boris Johnson]]'s statements that compared the event to the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] held in [[Nazi Germany]] as \"poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness\" and \"unacceptable and unworthy\" parallel towards Russia, a \"nation that [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism]]\".<ref name=\"0aw0J\" />\n\nThe British [[Foreign Office]] and MPs had repeatedly warned English football fans and \"people of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent\" travelling to Russia of \"racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility\".<ref name=\"qKSXy\" /><ref name=\"WNLwc\" /> English football fans who have travelled have said they have received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.<ref name=\"sOFhm\" /><ref name=\"XWjIW\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[File:2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony (2018-06-14) 11.jpg|thumb|Russia received widespread praise as World Cup hosts.

After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut on each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being upconverted from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to indirectly negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of coverage for the tournament.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014, additionally citing match scheduling that was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas than 2014 (with many matches airing in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history).<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to [[Japan\u2013North Korea relations|strained relations and campaigns against the country]].<ref name=\"iscoP\"

After the war, though he was interested in a career in sculpture and painting, in 1948 he switched to drama and studied under [[Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens]] at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]'s State Conservatory, where he also got his first job at the local ''Schauspielhaus''.\n\n==Film and TV==\nMeisner often played [[stock character]] [[Nazi]] officers and other sinister characters. He portrayed Hitler in the 1982 Franco-German action comedy, ''[[L'as des as]]'' (Ace of Aces), and in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television [[miniseries]], ''[[The Winds of War (miniseries)]]''. He also appeared in the [[CBS]] miniseries, ''[[Blood and Honor: Youth Under Hitler|Blood and Honor]]'' and [[Southern Television]]'s, ''[[Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years]]''.\n\nOther films Meisner took part in were ''[[Is Paris Burning? (film)|Is Paris Burning?]]'', ''[[The Quiller Memorandum]]'', ''[[Funeral in Berlin]]'', and ''[[The Boys from Brazil (film)|The Boys from Brazil]]''.

He is remembered for his several cinematic portrayals of [[Adolf Hitler]] and for his role as [[List of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory characters#Arthur Slugworth|Arthur Slugworth]] in ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''. He was fluent in four languages and appeared in many English-language, [[German language|German-language]] and [[French language|French-language]] films.\n\n==Career==\nBorn in [[Bremen]], Meisner briefly worked at a steel foundry before training as a radio operator with the [[Luftwaffe]]'s ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' ([[paratrooper]]s). After the war, though he was interested in a career in sculpture and painting, in 1948 he switched to drama and studied under [[Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens]] at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]'s State Conservatory, where he also got his first job at the local ''Schauspielhaus''.\n\n==Film and TV==\nMeisner often played [[stock character]] [[Nazi]] officers and other sinister characters. He portrayed Hitler in the 1982 Franco-German action comedy, ''[[L'as des as]]'' (Ace of Aces), and in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television [[miniseries]], ''[[The Winds of War (miniseries)]]''. He also appeared in the [[CBS]] miniseries, ''[[Blood and Honor: Youth Under Hitler|Blood and Honor]]'' and [[Southern Television]]'s, ''[[Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years]]''.\n\nOther films Meisner took part in were ''[[Is Paris Burning?

He was Mr. Slugworth/Mr. Wilkinson in the 1971 film version of ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''. He also appeared in several television commercials.\n\n==Theatre==\nAs a theatre actor and director, Meisner founded the ''Gallery Diogenes'' in Berlin in 1959 for visual art and mainly absurd theater. In 1961, he also founded the ''International Association for Arts and Sciences''.\n\n==Africa==\nFrom 1967 to 1969 Meisner participated in relief efforts in [[Biafra]], Nigeria. He also produced two films criticising racial discrimination: ''Don't Look for Me in Places Where I Can't Be Found'' and ''Bega Dwa Bega'' (One for All), a [[Swahili language|Swahili-language]] film for the Tanzanian Film Unit.\n\n==Death==\nMeisner died on 5 December 1994 at the age of 68 of [[heart failure]], during the filming of an episode of the television series ''[[Tatort]]''.

His mother, Margareta Karoline (n\u00e9e Reischb\u00f6ck) grew up in [[Franconia]] and [[Lower Bavaria]]. Both of them were [[Roman Catholic]]s, but the mother converted from [[Protestantism]] at some point.\n\nKarlheinz, the eldest of three children, attended elementary school in [[Trossenfurt]] (close to [[W\u00fcrzburg]]) from 1929 to 1933. Afterwards he attended the Franciscan Seminary in [[Dettelbach]]. There he first lived with the family of his godfather and sponsor, the clerical councilor Leopold Baumann, afterward in the Franciscan monastery. From 1934 to 1942 he attended the ''Alte, Neue and Deutsche Gymnasium'' as a boarding school student with the [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] and English Sisters. In 1942 he passed his final exams. Like the rest of his entire class he reported immediately as a military volunteer and was wounded several times. He served as a soldier until Germany's capitulation, in the final stages as a [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)| paratrooper]].\n\nInitially matriculating as a major in Forestry in the [[University of Munich]], Deschner attended lectures on Law, Theology, Philosophy and Psychology during 1946/47 at the Philosophical-Theological College in Bamberg. From 1947 to 1951 at the [[University of W\u00fcrzburg]] he studied Contemporary German Literature, Philosophy and History and graduated in 1951 with a doctoral dissertation entitled ''[[Lenau]]'s Lyrics As an Expression of Metaphysical Despair''. In the same year he married Elfi Tuch. They had three children: Katja (1951), B\u00e4rbel (1958) and Thomas (1959 to 1984).\n\nFrom 1924 to 1964 Deschner resided in a former hunting lodge of the prince-bishops of Tretzendorf (Steigerwald), then for two years in the country house of a friend in Fischbrunn (near [[Hersbruck]], [[Franconian Jura]]). After that, he resided in [[Ha\u00dffurt|Hassfurt am Main]] until his death.\n\nKarlheinz Deschner published novels, literary criticism, essays, aphorisms, and history critical of religion and the Church. Over the years he gave more than 2,000 public lectures.\n\nIn 1971 he was called before court in [[Nuremberg]], charged with \"Insults against the Church\", but was acquitted. Outside of Germany, his works remained largely unpublished until the eighties, when translated versions (where necessary) were published in Spain, Switzerland, Italy and Poland. (The fourth part of ''The Cock Crowed Once Again'' was translated into Norwegian and published in 1972).\n\nDeschner worked on his ambitious ''Criminal History of Christianity'' from 1970 to 2013.<ref>Karlheinz Deschner ''Kriminalgeschichte des Christentums'' Rowohlt Magazin [http://www.rowohlt.de/magazin_artikel/Karlheinz_Deschner_Kriminalgeschichte_des_Christentums_Bd_9.2849583.html rowohlt.de] (in German)</ref> He had no official research grants, honoraria, stipends, emoluments or official positions, but had been financially supported by a few friends and readers. His friend and patron Alfred Schwarz was able to celebrate the appearance of Volume 1 in September 1986 but did not live to see Volume 2 reach publication. The German entrepreneur [[Herbert Steffen]], founder of the humanistic [[Giordano Bruno Foundation]] has continued to support Deschner's work. In 1989 German weekly news magazine [[Der Spiegel]] published a recension of the first two volumes. The article was written by [[Horst Herrmann]], a former professor of Church law at [[M\u00fcnster University]] who left the Catholic Church in 1981.<ref>Horst Herrmann ''Einer singt falsch beim Halleluja'', published on 02 Jan 1989 in Der Spiegel: [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13493017.html spiegel.de] (in German)</ref>\n\nDuring the summer semester of 1987 Deschner taught a course entitled ''Criminal History of Christianity'' at the University of M\u00fcnster.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite book\n|title=Kriminalgeschichte des Christentums\n|first1=Karlheinz\n|last1=Deschner\n|publisher=Rowohlt\n|year=1986\n|page=526\n|url=http://rzblx10.uni-regensburg.de/dbinfo/detail.php?bib_id=alle&colors=&ocolors=&lett=a&titel_id=5672}}, \u00dcber den Autor, Bd. 8, p. 526\n</ref>\n\nKarlheinz Deschner was a member of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in Department of Historical Sciences.<ref>[http://www.sanu.ac.rs/English/Clanstvo/Clanstvo.aspx?arg=odeljenja,07 sanu.ac.rs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325093303/http://www.sanu.ac.rs/English/Clanstvo/Clanstvo.aspx?arg=odeljenja,07 |date=2018-03-25 }} Foreign members in the Department of Historical Sciences.</ref>\n\n==Prizes==\nIn a foreword of his ''The Criminal History of Christianity'' an overview of awards and prizes is presented:<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nDeschner was awarded the [[Arno Schmidt]] Prize in 1988, succeeding [[Wolfgang Koeppen]], [[Hans Wollschl\u00e4ger]] and [[Peter R\u00fchmkorf]].

His mother, Margareta Karoline (n\u00e9e Reischb\u00f6ck) grew up in [[Franconia]] and [[Lower Bavaria]]. Both of them were [[Roman Catholic]]s, but the mother converted from [[Protestantism]] at some point.\n\nKarlheinz, the eldest of three children, attended elementary school in [[Trossenfurt]] (close to [[W\u00fcrzburg]]) from 1929 to 1933. Afterwards he attended the Franciscan Seminary in [[Dettelbach]]. There he first lived with the family of his godfather and sponsor, the clerical councilor Leopold Baumann, afterward in the Franciscan monastery. From 1934 to 1942 he attended the ''Alte, Neue and Deutsche Gymnasium'' as a boarding school student with the [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] and English Sisters. In 1942 he passed his final exams. Like the rest of his entire class he reported immediately as a military volunteer and was wounded several times. He served as a soldier until Germany's capitulation, in the final stages as a [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger| paratrooper]].\n\nInitially matriculating as a major in Forestry in the [[University of Munich]], Deschner attended lectures on Law, Theology, Philosophy and Psychology during 1946/47 at the Philosophical-Theological College in Bamberg. From 1947 to 1951 at the [[University of W\u00fcrzburg]] he studied Contemporary German Literature, Philosophy and History and graduated in 1951 with a doctoral dissertation entitled ''[[Lenau]]'s Lyrics As an Expression of Metaphysical Despair''. In the same year he married Elfi Tuch. They had three children: Katja (1951), B\u00e4rbel (1958) and Thomas (1959 to 1984).\n\nFrom 1924 to 1964 Deschner resided in a former hunting lodge of the prince-bishops of Tretzendorf (Steigerwald), then for two years in the country house of a friend in Fischbrunn (near [[Hersbruck]], [[Franconian Jura]]). After that, he resided in [[Ha\u00dffurt|Hassfurt am Main]] until his death.\n\nKarlheinz Deschner published novels, literary criticism, essays, aphorisms, and history critical of religion and the Church. Over the years he gave more than 2,000 public lectures.\n\nIn 1971 he was called before court in [[Nuremberg]], charged with \"Insults against the Church\", but was acquitted. Outside of Germany, his works remained largely unpublished until the eighties, when translated versions (where necessary) were published in Spain, Switzerland, Italy and Poland. (The fourth part of ''The Cock Crowed Once Again'' was translated into Norwegian and published in 1972).\n\nDeschner worked on his ambitious ''Criminal History of Christianity'' from 1970 to 2013.<ref>Karlheinz Deschner ''Kriminalgeschichte des Christentums'' Rowohlt Magazin [http://www.rowohlt.de/magazin_artikel/Karlheinz_Deschner_Kriminalgeschichte_des_Christentums_Bd_9.2849583.html rowohlt.de] (in German)</ref> He had no official research grants, honoraria, stipends, emoluments or official positions, but had been financially supported by a few friends and readers. His friend and patron Alfred Schwarz was able to celebrate the appearance of Volume 1 in September 1986 but did not live to see Volume 2 reach publication. The German entrepreneur [[Herbert Steffen]], founder of the humanistic [[Giordano Bruno Foundation]] has continued to support Deschner's work. In 1989 German weekly news magazine [[Der Spiegel]] published a recension of the first two volumes. The article was written by [[Horst Herrmann]], a former professor of Church law at [[M\u00fcnster University]] who left the Catholic Church in 1981.<ref>Horst Herrmann ''Einer singt falsch beim Halleluja'', published on 02 Jan 1989 in Der Spiegel: [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13493017.html spiegel.de] (in German)</ref>\n\nDuring the summer semester of 1987 Deschner taught a course entitled ''Criminal History of Christianity'' at the University of M\u00fcnster.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite book\n|title=Kriminalgeschichte des Christentums\n|first1=Karlheinz\n|last1=Deschner\n|publisher=Rowohlt\n|year=1986\n|page=526\n|url=http://rzblx10.uni-regensburg.de/dbinfo/detail.php?bib_id=alle&colors=&ocolors=&lett=a&titel_id=5672}}, \u00dcber den Autor, Bd. 8, p. 526\n</ref>\n\nKarlheinz Deschner was a member of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in Department of Historical Sciences.<ref>[http://www.sanu.ac.rs/English/Clanstvo/Clanstvo.aspx?arg=odeljenja,07 sanu.ac.rs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325093303/http://www.sanu.ac.rs/English/Clanstvo/Clanstvo.aspx?arg=odeljenja,07 |date=2018-03-25 }} Foreign members in the Department of Historical Sciences.</ref>\n\n==Prizes==\nIn a foreword of his ''The Criminal History of Christianity'' an overview of awards and prizes is presented:<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nDeschner was awarded the [[Arno Schmidt]] Prize in 1988, succeeding [[Wolfgang Koeppen]], [[Hans Wollschl\u00e4ger]] and [[Peter R\u00fchmkorf]].
