At the time, it was called \u201cThe Jewel of Oakmont\u201d and featured indoor air conditioning which was a real treat for the time. In 2015 it was converted from a single-screen Art Deco-style theater to a modern, multi-purpose entertainment venue. The renovation maintained the original architectural style and grandeur of the theater, while adding modern amenities such as cabaret seating, a full-service bar, and updated lighting and sound capabilities.

Edgewater Steel Company clean closed an EAF dust waste pile in 1991 and closed in place a construction/demolition waste landfill in 1995. The facility shut down operations in 2001. In October, 2001 an environmental inspection was done. An Environmental Indicator (EI) report was prepared in March 2002. Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) determined that with the removal of waste from the manufacturing buildings, the EI's would be under control (Sept. 2003). The buildings were demolished in 2005, but some waste (dust) was apparently disposed on site during demolition activities. Subsequent sampling in 2006 did not locate any dust or materials that exhibited a hazardous waste characteristic. Additionally as part of a Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) Act 2 site characterization, limited TCE impacts to groundwater were found.\n\nThe site was divided into two parcels for remediation and redevelopment as residential, commercial and light industrial properties; the 32-acre Oakmont area and the 28 acre River Edge area. The Oakmont area remediation and redevelopment plan received PADEP Act 2 approval, and redevelopment is underway. The River Edge area is currently under remediation.\n<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n=== Contaminants at this Facility ===\nPADEP allowed the Edgewater Steel Corporation to cease groundwater monitoring activities for the former EAF dust landfill because: 1) it could not be properly monitored due to hydraulic influences from nearby Plum Creek and 2) Edgewater removed the EAF dust and contaminated soil, thus clean closing the unit. Earth Sciences Consultants, on behalf of Edgewater, closed monitoring wells MW-903 through MW-906. Therefore, this area posed no further groundwater contamination potential. Fay Construction currently owns the property where this unit was located.\n\nThe plant has a \u201clarge asbestos situation\u201d in the old stream boilers, and possibly asbestos contaminated furnaces, ceiling tiles, and floor tiles, none of which are Solid Waste Management Units (SWMUs). Operations have ceased at the site due to bankruptcy; hence there are currently no workers at the site. The plant is undergoing selective demolition, so any asbestos concerns will be addressed as part of any demolition work.\n<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n=== New Construction At Former Edgewater Steel Site ===\nAt the site where Edgewater Steel once stood, a new greener residential neighborhood is rising. The new residential area of Oakmont will acquire condominiums, town homes, manor flats, cottage homes, village homes, green spaces, a waterfront park, and more. Edgewater will obtain 242 homes ranging from $200,000 to $700,000. These new homes will reduce energy uses by 30%.

Edgewater Steel Company clean closed an EAF dust waste pile in 1991 and closed in place a construction/demolition waste landfill in 1995. The facility shut down operations in 2001. In October, 2001 an environmental inspection was done. An Environmental Indicator (EI) report was prepared in March 2002. Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) determined that with the removal of waste from the manufacturing buildings, the EI's would be under control (Sept. 2003). The buildings were demolished in 2005, but some waste (dust) was apparently disposed on site during demolition activities. Subsequent sampling in 2006 did not locate any dust or materials that exhibited a hazardous waste characteristic. Additionally as part of a Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) Act 2 site characterization, limited TCE impacts to groundwater were found.\n\nThe site was divided into two parcels for remediation and redevelopment as residential, commercial and light industrial properties; the 32-acre Oakmont area and the 28 acre River Edge area. The Oakmont area remediation and redevelopment plan received PADEP Act 2 approval, and redevelopment is underway. The River Edge area is currently under remediation.\n<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n=== Contaminants at this Facility ===\nPADEP allowed the Edgewater Steel Corporation to cease groundwater monitoring activities for the former EAF dust landfill because: 1) it could not be properly monitored due to hydraulic influences from nearby Plum Creek and 2) Edgewater removed the EAF dust and contaminated soil, thus clean closing the unit. Earth Sciences Consultants, on behalf of Edgewater, closed monitoring wells MW-903 through MW-906. Therefore, this area posed no further groundwater contamination potential. Fay Construction currently owns the property where this unit was located.\n\nThe plant has a \u201clarge asbestos situation\u201d in the old stream boilers, and possibly asbestos contaminated furnaces, ceiling tiles, and floor tiles, none of which are Solid Waste Management Units (SWMUs). Operations have ceased at the site due to bankruptcy; hence there are currently no workers at the site. The plant is undergoing selective demolition, so any asbestos concerns will be addressed as part of any demolition work.\n<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n=== New Construction At Former Edgewater Steel Site ===\nAt the site where Edgewater Steel once stood, a new greener residential neighborhood is rising.

Accessed November 22, 2011.</ref>\n\nThe Colony began to grow rapidly and the land was cleared for farming. Eventually two highways were laid out. One, from the Delaware River to Egg Harbor, followed an old Native American trail, which is today the Black Horse Pike. The other was known as the Long-a-coming trail, which extended from [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] to Berlin and then from Berlin to [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]]. This trail is now known as the White Horse Pike.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]], a group of [[Virginia]] sportsmen built a racetrack on the east side of the White Horse Pike. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] visited this track as a young man before it closed in 1846. Samuel Bettle bought the land which was formerly the racetrack and eventually, the land was deeded to [[Haddon Township, New Jersey|Haddon Township]].<ref name=CP2011/>\n\nAs the years passed, the farms along Newton Creek were divided into lots and the development called \"Oakland the Beautiful\", for the many trees in the area. The name was changed to Oaklyn in 1894 to avoid confusion with another [[Oakland, New Jersey|Oakland]] in [[North Jersey]].<ref name=CP2011/><ref>Margulis, Marilyn.

Fire District 3 covers the Bettlewood, Heather Glen, and Heather Woods sections of Haddon Township. This was a long-standing agreement that existed since 1905. From 1902 when the Oaklyn fire service was established until 1905, Oaklyn and the Bettlewood section were both in Haddon Twp. Subsequently, the Oaklyn Fire Company No. 1 of the Oaklyn section of Haddon Township provided fire protection to the whole area, as it was and still is a continuous land mass. When Oaklyn seceded from the Township in 1905 there was an agreement made between Oaklyn Borough and Haddon Township that Oaklyn would still protect the District 3 section since they were much closer and the fire apparatus was horse drawn at the time. This relationship continued for another 102 years until January 2008. Currently, Fire District 3 is protected by Westmont Fire Co. # 1 pursuant to three consecutive one-year agreements.\n\nThe Oaklyn Fire Company No. 1 (Station 18-1) was established in 1902 (predating the borough's establishment) and was located on Newton Avenue near the Suburban Lumber Company, which ironically has been the site of several famous Camden County fires occurring in the 1950s, 1980s, and 1990s. The Oaklyn Fire Co. building still stands today as a private residence. The company was formed by Oaklyn residents who had been volunteering their services at the nearby Defender Fire Company (Station 1-2), which was located in the community of Orston (then another section of Haddon Township, now part of [[Audubon, New Jersey|Audubon borough]]). Until the formation of the Oaklyn Fire Company, the Defender Fire Company handled firefighting duties in the Borough of Oaklyn (The Defender Fire Company was subsequently taken over by the Audubon Fire Department (Station 1-1) as of 1996).\n\nThe Welcome Fire Company (Station 18-2) was established in 1906 and was located at the corner of the White Horse Pike and West Clinton Avenue. Today, the building houses the Oaklyn Police Department and Borough Hall and stands next to the current fire station. The Welcome Fire Company was established when residents who wished to volunteer with the Oaklyn Fire Company found they had filled their roster and were not \"welcoming\" any new members, hence their name.\n\nThe current incarnation of the Oaklyn Fire Department was established in 1976 when Oaklyn Fire Company No. 1 and the Welcome Fire Company consolidated their services. David Aron was the first Chief following the merger, previously serving as Chief of the Welcome Fire Company. The current Fire Chief is Scott Cairns.\n\n===Federal, state and county representation===\nOaklyn is located in the 1st Congressional District<ref name=PCR2012>[https://www.nj.gov/state/elections/assets/pdf/2012-congressional-districts/njcd-2011-plan-components-county-mcd.pdf Plan Components Report], [[New Jersey Redistricting Commission]], December 23, 2011.

One, from the Delaware River to Egg Harbor, followed an old Native American trail, which is today the Black Horse Pike. The other was known as the Long-a-coming trail, which extended from [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] to Berlin and then from Berlin to [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]]. This trail is now known as the White Horse Pike.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]], a group of [[Virginia]] sportsmen built a racetrack on the east side of the White Horse Pike. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] visited this track as a young man before it closed in 1846. Samuel Bettle bought the land which was formerly the racetrack and eventually, the land was deeded to [[Haddon Township, New Jersey|Haddon Township]].<ref name=CP2011/>\n\nAs the years passed, the farms along Newton Creek were divided into lots and the development called \"Oakland the Beautiful\", for the many trees in the area.

Fire District 3 covers the Bettlewood, Heather Glen, and Heather Woods sections of Haddon Township. This was a long-standing agreement that existed since 1905. From 1902 when the Oaklyn fire service was established until 1905, Oaklyn and the Bettlewood section were both in Haddon Twp. Subsequently, the Oaklyn Fire Company No. 1 of the Oaklyn section of Haddon Township provided fire protection to the whole area, as it was and still is a continuous land mass. When Oaklyn seceded from the Township in 1905 there was an agreement made between Oaklyn Borough and Haddon Township that Oaklyn would still protect the District 3 section since they were much closer and the fire apparatus was horse drawn at the time. This relationship continued for another 102 years until January 2008. Currently, Fire District 3 is protected by Westmont Fire Co. # 1 pursuant to three consecutive one-year agreements.\n\nThe Oaklyn Fire Company No. 1 (Station 18-1) was established in 1902 (predating the borough's establishment) and was located on Newton Avenue near the Suburban Lumber Company, which ironically has been the site of several famous Camden County fires occurring in the 1950s, 1980s, and 1990s. The Oaklyn Fire Co. building still stands today as a private residence. The company was formed by Oaklyn residents who had been volunteering their services at the nearby Defender Fire Company (Station 1-2), which was located in the community of Orston (then another section of Haddon Township, now part of [[Audubon, New Jersey|Audubon borough]]). Until the formation of the Oaklyn Fire Company, the Defender Fire Company handled firefighting duties in the Borough of Oaklyn (The Defender Fire Company was subsequently taken over by the Audubon Fire Department (Station 1-1) as of 1996).\n\nThe Welcome Fire Company (Station 18-2) was established in 1906 and was located at the corner of the White Horse Pike and West Clinton Avenue. Today, the building houses the Oaklyn Police Department and Borough Hall and stands next to the current fire station. The Welcome Fire Company was established when residents who wished to volunteer with the Oaklyn Fire Company found they had filled their roster and were not \"welcoming\" any new members, hence their name.\n\nThe current incarnation of the Oaklyn Fire Department was established in 1976 when Oaklyn Fire Company No. 1 and the Welcome Fire Company consolidated their services. David Aron was the first Chief following the merger, previously serving as Chief of the Welcome Fire Company. The current Fire Chief is Scott Cairns.\n\n===Federal, state and county representation===\nOaklyn is located in the 1st Congressional District<ref name=PCR2012>[https://www.nj.gov/state/elections/assets/pdf/2012-congressional-districts/njcd-2011-plan-components-county-mcd.pdf Plan Components Report], [[New Jersey Redistricting Commission]], December 23, 2011.

It is also commonly referred to as the '''Australian Government''', the '''Commonwealth Government''', or the '''Federal Government'''.\n\nThe legislature, also known as the Parliament of Australia, or simply Parliament, is made up of democratically-elected representatives from around Australia.\n\nThese representatives meet at Parliament House in Canberra to discuss legislation and make laws for the benefit of the nation. The issues that they can make laws on are defined by sections 51 and 122 of the Constitution.\n\nThe Parliament of the Commonwealth comprises two separate chambers:\nthe House of Representatives (or 'the lower house') and the Senate (or 'the upper house'). The lower House is green and the senate is red. This 2 house system is called the bicameral system meaning 2 houses.\n\nThe House of Representatives has 151 members, each representing a different area of the country ('electorate'). Each electorate has roughly the same number of registered voters within its boundary, meaning that states with larger populations have more electorates and therefore more representatives in the House.\n\nThe Senate is composed of 76 members. Unlike the House of Representatives, membership of the Senate is divided evenly between the states. Each state has 12 senators, and the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory have 2 senators each. The Senate was established this way to ensure that the larger states could not use their majority in the House of Representatives to pass laws that disadvantaged the smaller states.\n\nThe Constitution is silent on the role of political parties in Parliament. It does not make any reference to a government party, an opposition party or minor parties, or to roles like Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition. These are conventions that have been adopted to assist the smooth operation of the legislature.\n\nThe executive is the administrative arm of government. The Australian Government is formed by the party or coalition of parties with the support of a majority of members in the House of Representatives.\n\nA government minister is a member of the legislature who has been chosen to also work as part of the executive, usually with responsibility for matters on a specific topic (his/her portfolio). The main roles of the Government are to make important national decisions, develop policy, introduce bills (proposed laws), implement laws and manage government departments.\n\nThe public service, working in departments and agencies, puts those laws into operation and upholds those laws once they have begun to operate. Canberra, located in the Australian Capital Territory, is Australia's national capital. The Parliament of Australia is located in Canberra, as is most of the Australian Government public service.\n\nThe judiciary is the legal arm of the government. Independent of the legislature and the executive, it is the role of the judiciary to enforce Australia's laws. It must also ensure that the other arms of government do not act beyond the powers granted to them by the Constitution or by Parliament.\n\nThe High Court of Australia is, as its name suggests, Australia's highest court. Underneath the High Court are a number of other federal courts. The [[Commonwealth]] of Australia was formed in 1901 as a result of an agreement among six self-governing [[British Empire|British colonies]], which became the six states. The terms of this contract are embodied in the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]], which was drawn up at a [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|Constitutional Convention]] and ratified by the people of the colonies at [[referendum]]s. The Australian [[head of state]] is the [[Queen of Australia]] who is represented by the [[Governor-General of Australia]],<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/info/infosheets/is20.pdf| last=House of Representatives| title=The Australian System of Government| page=3| publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service| accessdate=10 March 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312124621/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/info/infosheets/is20.pdf| archivedate=12 March 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.peo.gov.au/quick-answers/history-and-culture.html |website =Parliamentary Education Office |title=History and Culture: Quick Answers |publisher =Australian Government Publishing Service |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313181036/https://www.peo.gov.au/quick-answers/history-and-culture.html |archivedate=13 March 2018 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/protocol/protocol_guidelines/15.html| last=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade| authorlink=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)| title=Protocol > Protocol guidelines > The Australian Government| publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service| accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.apsc.gov.au/about/exppsreform3.htm| last=Australian Public Service Commission| authorlink=Australian Public Service Commission| title=About the Commission > The Australian experience of public sector reform > The Constitutional and Government framework| publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service| accessdate=14 March 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313221139/http://www.apsc.gov.au/about/exppsreform3.htm| archivedate=13 March 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizenship.gov.au/learn/cit_test/_pdf/australian-citizenship-aug2012.pdf|title=Australian Citizenship \u2013 Our Common Bond|publisher=Department of Immigration and Citizenship|date=August 2012}}</ref> with executive powers delegated by [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|constitutional convention]] to the Australian [[head of government]], the [[Prime Minister of Australia]].\n\nThe Government of the Commonwealth of Australia is divided into three branches: the executive branch, composed of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]], presided by the Governor-General, which delegates powers to the [[Cabinet of Australia]], led by the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]]; the [[Legislature|legislative]] branch, composed of the [[Parliament of Australia]]'s [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]] and [[Senate (Australia)|Senate]]; and the [[Judiciary|judicial]] branch, composed of the [[High Court of Australia]] and the [[Australian court hierarchy|federal courts]]. [[Separation of powers]] is implied by the structure of the Constitution, the three branches of government being set out in separate chapters (chapters I to III).The Australian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the [[Westminster system|United Kingdom]] ([[Fusion of powers|fused executive]], [[constitutional monarchy]]) and the [[United States Government|United States]] ([[federalism]], [[written constitution]], elected upper house), along with distinctive indigenous features, and has therefore been characterised as a \"Washminster mutation\".<ref>{{cite article|last=Thompson|first=Elaine|title=The \"Washminster\" Mutation|journal=Australian Journal of Political Science|year=1980|volume=15|page=32}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n{{Images of branches of Australian Government}}\n\nSection 1 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] creates a democratic legislature, the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Parliament of Australia]] which consists of the [[Monarchy of Australia|Queen of Australia]], and two houses of parliament, the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]]. [[Section 51 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 51]] of the Constitution provides for the Commonwealth Government's legislative powers and allocates certain powers and responsibilities (known as \"heads of power\") to the Commonwealth government. All remaining responsibilities are retained by the six [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|States]] (previously separate colonies). Further, each State has its own constitution, so that Australia has seven sovereign Parliaments, none of which can encroach on the functions of any other. The [[High Court of Australia]] arbitrates on any disputes which arise between the Commonwealth and the States, or among the States, concerning their respective functions.\n\nThe Commonwealth Parliament can propose changes to the Constitution. To become effective, the proposals must be put to a [[referendum]] of all Australians of voting age, and must receive a \"double majority\": a majority of all votes, and a majority of votes in a majority of States.\n\nThe Commonwealth Constitution also provides that the States can agree to refer any of their powers to the Commonwealth. This may be achieved by way of an amendment to the Constitution via referendum (a vote on whether the proposed transfer of power from the States to the Commonwealth, or vice versa, should be implemented). More commonly powers may be transferred by passing other acts of legislation which authorise the transfer and such acts require the legislative agreement of all the state governments involved. This \"transfer\" legislation may have a \"sunset clause\", a legislative provision that nullifies the transfer of power after a specified period, at which point the original division of power is restored.\n\nIn addition, Australia has several \"territories\", two of which are self-governing:  the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) and the [[Northern Territory]] (NT).  These territories' legislatures, their Assemblies, exercise powers devolved to them by the Commonwealth;  the Commonwealth Parliament remains able to override their legislation and to alter their powers.  Australian citizens in these territories are represented by members of both houses of the Commonwealth Parliament.  The territory of [[Norfolk Island]] was self-governing from 1979 until 2016, although it was never  represented as such in the Commonwealth Parliament.  The other territories that are regularly inhabited{{mdash}}[[Jervis Bay Territory|Jervis Bay]], [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]{{mdash}}have never been self-governing.\n\nThe federal nature of the Commonwealth and the structure of the [[Parliament of Australia]] were the subject of protracted negotiations among the colonies during the drafting of the Constitution. The [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] is elected on a basis that reflects the differing populations of the States. Thus [[New South Wales]] has 48 members while [[Tasmania]] has only five.  But the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] is elected on a basis of equality among the States: all States elect 12 Senators, regardless of population. This was intended to allow the Senators of the smaller States to form a majority and thus be able to amend or reject bills originating in the House of Representatives. The ACT and the NT each elect two Senators.\n\nThe third level of government after Commonwealth and State/Territory is [[Local government in Australia|Local government]], in the form of [[shire]]s, towns and cities. The Councils of these areas are composed of elected representatives (known as either [[councillor]] or [[alderman]], depending on the State), usually serving part-time.  Their powers are devolved to them by the State or Territory in which they are located.\n\nGovernment at the Commonwealth level and the State/Territory level is undertaken by three inter-connected arms of government:\n\n* Legislature: The [[Parliament of Australia|Commonwealth Parliament]]\n* Executive: The Sovereign of Australia, whose executive power is exercisable by the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, Ministers and their Departments\n* Judiciary: The [[High Court of Australia]] and subsidiary Federal courts.\n\n''[[Separation of powers]]'' is the principle whereby the three arms of government undertake their activities largely separately from each other:\n\n* the Legislature proposes laws in the form of Bills, and provides a legislative framework for the operations of the other two arms;  the sovereign is formally a part of the Parliament, but takes no active role in these matters, except that (representing the sovereign) Governors-General, State Governors and Territory Administrators sign enactments into law through providing Royal Assent\n* the Executive administers the laws and carries out the tasks assigned to it by legislation\n* the Judiciary hears cases arising from the administration of the law, applying both [[statute law]] and the [[common law]];  the Australian courts cannot give an [[advisory opinions|advisory opinion]] on the constitutionality of a law, but the [[High Court of Australia]] can determine whether an existing law is constitutional\n* the Judiciary is appointed by the sovereign's representatives, on the advice of the Commonwealth  or State/Territory government;  but the Legislature and the Executive should  not try to influence its decisions.\n\n==Legislature==\n{{main|Parliament of Australia}}\n[[File:Australian Senate - Parliament of Australia.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Australian Senate]] chamber]]\nThe Legislature makes the laws, and supervises the activities of the other two arms with a view to changing the laws when appropriate. The [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] is [[bicameral]], consisting of the [[Queen of Australia]], a 76-member [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and a 151-member [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].\n\nTwelve Senators from each state are elected for six-year terms, using [[proportional representation]] and the [[single transferable vote]] (known in Australia as \"quota-preferential voting\": see [[Australian electoral system]]), with half elected every three years. In addition to the state Senators, two senators are elected by voters from the [[Northern Territory]] (which for this purpose includes the Indian Ocean Territories, [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]), while another two senators are elected by the voters of the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (which for this purpose includes the [[Jervis Bay Territory]]). Senators from the territories are also elected using preferential voting, but their term of office is not fixed;  it starts on the day of a general election for the House of Representatives and ends on the day before the next such election.\n\nThe members of the House of Representatives are elected by majority-preferential<ref>{{cite web |url=https://researchers.anu.edu.au/publications/4497 |title=Australia: Replacing Plurality Rule with Majority-Preferential Voting |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.}}</ref> voting using the non-proportional [[Instant-runoff voting]] system<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/closer-look/short-history/the-first-parliament.html |title=The first Parliament: Developments in the Parliament of Australia |publisher=Parliamentary Education Office of the Government of Australia}}</ref> from single-member constituencies allocated among the states and territories.  In ordinary legislation, the two chambers have co-ordinate powers, but all proposals for appropriating revenue or imposing taxes must be introduced in the House of Representatives. Under the prevailing [[Westminster system]], the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the support of a majority of the members in the House of Representatives is invited to form a government and is named [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]].\n[[File:Australian House of Representatives - Parliament of Australia.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Australian House of Representatives]] chamber]]\nThe Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to the Parliament, of which they must, in most circumstances, be members. General elections are held at least once every three years. The Prime Minister has a discretion to advise the Governor-General to call an election for the House of Representatives at any time, but Senate elections can only be held within certain periods prescribed in the Constitution. The most recent general election was on [[2019 Australian federal election|18 May 2019]].\n\nThe Commonwealth Parliament and all the state and territory legislatures operate within the conventions of the [[Westminster system]], with a recognised [[List of Australian Opposition Leaders|Leader of the Opposition]], usually the leader of the largest party outside the government, and a [[Shadow Cabinet]] of Opposition members who \"shadow\" each member of the Ministry, asking questions on matters within the Minister's portfolio. Although the Government, by virtue of commanding a majority of members in the lower house of the legislature, can usually pass its legislation and control the workings of the house, the Opposition can considerably delay the passage of legislation and obstruct government business if it chooses.\n\nThe day-to-day business of the [[House of Representatives of Australia|House of Representatives]] is usually negotiated between the [[Leader of the House (Australia)|Leader of the House]], appointed by the Prime Minister, and the [[Manager of Opposition Business in the House (Australia)|Manager of Opposition Business in the House]], appointed by the [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the Commonwealth parliament, currently [[Anthony Albanese]].\n\n==Executive==\n\n===Head of state===\n{{main|Monarchy of Australia | Governor-General of Australia}}\n\nThe [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] dates from 1901, when the [[British Dominions|Dominions]] of the [[British Empire]] were not sovereign states, and does not use the term \"head of state\". As Australia is a [[constitutional monarchy]], government and academic sources describe the Queen as head of state.<ref>The Constitution (2012) Overview by the Attorney-General's Department and Australian Government Solicitor [https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005Q00193]</ref> In practice, the role of head of state of Australia is divided between two people, the [[Queen of Australia]] and the [[Governor-General of Australia]], who is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Australia]]. Though in many respects the Governor-General is the Queen's representative, and exercises various constitutional powers in her name, they independently exercise many important powers in their own right. The governor-general represents Australia internationally, making and receiving state visits.<ref>{{cite web | title = Governor-General's Role | publisher = Office of the Governor-General | date = 20 July 2015 | url = http://www.gg.gov.au/governor-generals-role | accessdate = 1 March 2015 }}</ref>\n[[File:Government House Canberra.JPG|thumb|left|[[Government House, Canberra]]]]\nThe [[Monarch|Sovereign]] of Australia, currently [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], is also the Sovereign of fifteen other [[Commonwealth realm]]s including the United Kingdom. Like the other [[British Dominions|Dominions]], Australia gained legislative independence from the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] by virtue of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], which was adopted in Australia in 1942 with retrospective effect from 3 September 1939. By the [[Royal Style and Titles Act 1953]], the Australian Parliament gave the Queen the title [[Queen of Australia]], and in 1973 titles with any reference to her status as [[Queen of the United Kingdom]] and [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]] as well were removed, making her Queen of Australia.\n\nSection 61 of the Constitution provides that 'The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor\u2011General as the Queen's representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth'. Section 2 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] provides that a [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] shall represent the Queen in Australia. In practice, the Governor-General carries out all the functions usually performed by a head of state, without reference to the Queen.\n\nUnder the conventions of the [[Westminster system]] the Governor-General's powers are almost always exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister or other ministers. The Governor-General retains [[reserve powers]] similar to those possessed by the Queen in the United Kingdom. These are rarely exercised, but during the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|Australian constitutional crisis of 1975]] Governor-General Sir [[John Kerr (Governor-General)|John Kerr]] used them independently of the Queen and the Prime Minister.\n\nAustralia has periodically experienced movements seeking to end the monarchy. In a [[1999 Australian republic referendum|1999 referendum]], the Australian people voted on a proposal to change the Constitution. The proposal would have removed references to the [[Queen of Australia|Queen]] from the Constitution and replaced the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] with a President nominated by the Prime Minister, but subject to the approval of a two-thirds majority of both Houses of the Parliament. The proposal was defeated. The [[Australian Republican Movement]] continues to campaign for an end to the monarchy in Australia, opposed by [[Australians for Constitutional Monarchy]] and [[Australian Monarchist League]].\n\n{{further|Constitutional history of Australia|Australian republicanism|Australian head of state dispute}}\n\n===Executive Council===\n{{main|Federal Executive Council (Australia)}}\nThe Federal Executive Council is a formal body which exists and meets to give legal effect to decisions made by the Cabinet, and to carry out various other functions. All Ministers are members of the Executive Council and are entitled to be styled \"[[The Honourable]]\", a title which they retain for life. The [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] usually presides at Council meetings, but in his or her absence another Minister nominated as the [[Vice-President of the Executive Council]] presides at the meeting of the Council. Since 20 December 2017, the Vice-President of the Federal Executive Council has been Senator [[Mathias Cormann]].\n\nThere are times when the government acts in a [[Caretaker government of Australia|\"caretaker\" capacity]], principally in the period prior to and immediately following a general election.\n\n===Cabinet===\n{{main|Cabinet of Australia|List of Australian Ministers}}\n\nThe Cabinet of Australia is the council of senior Ministers of the Crown, responsible to the Federal Parliament. The ministers are appointed by the Governor-General, on the advice of the Prime Minister, who serve at the former's pleasure. Cabinet meetings are strictly private and occur once a week where vital issues are discussed and policy formulated. Outside the cabinet there is an outer ministry and also a number of junior ministers, called Parliamentary secretaries, responsible for a specific policy area and reporting directly to a senior Cabinet minister.\n\nThe Constitution of Australia does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; it exists solely by convention. Its decisions do not in and of themselves have legal force. However, it serves as the practical expression of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]], which is Australia's highest formal governmental body. In practice, the Federal Executive Council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet. All members of the Cabinet are members of the Executive Council. While the Governor-General is nominal presiding officer, he almost never attends Executive Council meetings. A senior member of the Cabinet holds the office of Vice-President of the Executive Council and acts as presiding officer of the Executive Council in the absence of the Governor-General.\n\nUntil 1956 all members of the ministry were members of the Cabinet. The growth of the ministry in the 1940s and 1950s made this increasingly impractical, and in 1956 [[Robert Menzies]] created a two-tier ministry, with only senior ministers holding Cabinet rank, also known within parliament as the [[front bench]]. This practice has been continued by all governments except the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Government.\n\nWhen the non-Labor parties are in power, the Prime Minister makes all Cabinet and ministerial appointments at their own discretion, although in practice they consult with senior colleagues in making appointments. When the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] and its predecessors (the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]] and the [[United Australia Party]]) have been in coalition with the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] or its predecessor the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]], the leader of the junior Coalition party has had the right to nominate their party's members of the Coalition ministry, and to be consulted by the Prime Minister on the allocation of their portfolios.\n\nWhen the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] first held office under [[Chris Watson]], Watson assumed the right to choose members of his Cabinet. In 1907, however, the party decided that future Labor Cabinets would be elected by the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party, the [[Caucus]], and the Prime Minister would retain the right to allocate portfolios. This practice was followed until 2007. Between 1907 and 2007, Labor Prime Ministers exercised a predominant influence over who was elected to Labor ministries, although the leaders of the party factions also exercised considerable influence. Prior to the [[2007 Australian general election|2007 general election]], the then Leader of the Opposition, [[Kevin Rudd]], said that he and he alone would choose the ministry should he become Prime Minister. His party won the election and he chose the ministry, as he said he would.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/29/2046939.htm |title=Rudd seizes power from factions |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 September 2007 |first=Ben |last=Worsley}}</ref>\n\nThe cabinet meets not only in Canberra but also in state capitals, most frequently Sydney and Melbourne.

It is also commonly referred to as the '''Australian Government''', the '''Commonwealth Government''', or the '''Federal Government'''.\n\nThe legislature, also known as the Parliament of Australia, or simply Parliament, is made up of democratically-elected representatives from around Australia.\n\nThese representatives meet at Parliament House in Canberra to discuss legislation and make laws for the benefit of the nation. The issues that they can make laws on are defined by sections 51 and 122 of the Constitution.\n\nThe Parliament of the Commonwealth comprises two separate chambers:\nthe House of Representatives (or 'the lower house') and the Senate (or 'the upper house'). The lower House is green and the senate is red. This 2 house system is called the bicameral system meaning 2 houses.\n\nThe House of Representatives has 151 members, each representing a different area of the country ('electorate'). Each electorate has roughly the same number of registered voters within its boundary, meaning that states with larger populations have more electorates and therefore more representatives in the House.\n\nThe Senate is composed of 76 members. Unlike the House of Representatives, membership of the Senate is divided evenly between the states. Each state has 12 senators, and the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory have 2 senators each. The Senate was established this way to ensure that the larger states could not use their majority in the House of Representatives to pass laws that disadvantaged the smaller states.\n\nThe Constitution is silent on the role of political parties in Parliament. It does not make any reference to a government party, an opposition party or minor parties, or to roles like Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition. These are conventions that have been adopted to assist the smooth operation of the legislature.\n\nThe executive is the administrative arm of government. The Australian Government is formed by the party or coalition of parties with the support of a majority of members in the House of Representatives.\n\nA government minister is a member of the legislature who has been chosen to also work as part of the executive, usually with responsibility for matters on a specific topic (his/her portfolio). The main roles of the Government are to make important national decisions, develop policy, introduce bills (proposed laws), implement laws and manage government departments.\n\nThe public service, working in departments and agencies, puts those laws into operation and upholds those laws once they have begun to operate. Canberra, located in the Australian Capital Territory, is Australia's national capital. The Parliament of Australia is located in Canberra, as is most of the Australian Government public service.\n\nThe judiciary is the legal arm of the government. Independent of the legislature and the executive, it is the role of the judiciary to enforce Australia's laws. It must also ensure that the other arms of government do not act beyond the powers granted to them by the Constitution or by Parliament.\n\nThe High Court of Australia is, as its name suggests, Australia's highest court. Underneath the High Court are a number of other federal courts. The [[Commonwealth]] of Australia was formed in 1901 as a result of an agreement among six self-governing [[British Empire|British colonies]], which became the six states. The terms of this contract are embodied in the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]], which was drawn up at a [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|Constitutional Convention]] and ratified by the people of the colonies at [[referendum]]s. The Australian [[head of state]] is the [[Queen of Australia]] who is represented by the [[Governor-General of Australia]],<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/info/infosheets/is20.pdf| last=House of Representatives| title=The Australian System of Government| page=3| publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service| accessdate=10 March 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312124621/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/info/infosheets/is20.pdf| archivedate=12 March 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.peo.gov.au/quick-answers/history-and-culture.html |website =Parliamentary Education Office |title=History and Culture: Quick Answers |publisher =Australian Government Publishing Service |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313181036/https://www.peo.gov.au/quick-answers/history-and-culture.html |archivedate=13 March 2018 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/protocol/protocol_guidelines/15.html| last=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade| authorlink=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)| title=Protocol > Protocol guidelines > The Australian Government| publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service| accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.apsc.gov.au/about/exppsreform3.htm| last=Australian Public Service Commission| authorlink=Australian Public Service Commission| title=About the Commission > The Australian experience of public sector reform > The Constitutional and Government framework| publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service| accessdate=14 March 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313221139/http://www.apsc.gov.au/about/exppsreform3.htm| archivedate=13 March 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizenship.gov.au/learn/cit_test/_pdf/australian-citizenship-aug2012.pdf|title=Australian Citizenship \u2013 Our Common Bond|publisher=Department of Immigration and Citizenship|date=August 2012}}</ref> with executive powers delegated by [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|constitutional convention]] to the Australian [[head of government]], the [[Prime Minister of Australia]].\n\nThe Government of the Commonwealth of Australia is divided into three branches: the executive branch, composed of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]], presided by the Governor-General, which delegates powers to the [[Cabinet of Australia]], led by the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]]; the [[Legislature|legislative]] branch, composed of the [[Parliament of Australia]]'s [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]] and [[Senate (Australia)|Senate]]; and the [[Judiciary|judicial]] branch, composed of the [[High Court of Australia]] and the [[Australian court hierarchy|federal courts]]. [[Separation of powers]] is implied by the structure of the Constitution, the three branches of government being set out in separate chapters (chapters I to III).The Australian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the [[Westminster system|United Kingdom]] ([[Fusion of powers|fused executive]], [[constitutional monarchy]]) and the [[United States Government|United States]] ([[federalism]], [[written constitution]], elected upper house), along with distinctive indigenous features, and has therefore been characterised as a \"Washminster mutation\".<ref>{{cite article|last=Thompson|first=Elaine|title=The \"Washminster\" Mutation|journal=Australian Journal of Political Science|year=1980|volume=15|page=32}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n{{Images of branches of Australian Government}}\n\nSection 1 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] creates a democratic legislature, the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Parliament of Australia]] which consists of the [[Monarchy of Australia|Queen of Australia]], and two houses of parliament, the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]]. [[Section 51 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 51]] of the Constitution provides for the Commonwealth Government's legislative powers and allocates certain powers and responsibilities (known as \"heads of power\") to the Commonwealth government. All remaining responsibilities are retained by the six [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|States]] (previously separate colonies). Further, each State has its own constitution, so that Australia has seven sovereign Parliaments, none of which can encroach on the functions of any other. The [[High Court of Australia]] arbitrates on any disputes which arise between the Commonwealth and the States, or among the States, concerning their respective functions.\n\nThe Commonwealth Parliament can propose changes to the Constitution. To become effective, the proposals must be put to a [[referendum]] of all Australians of voting age, and must receive a \"double majority\": a majority of all votes, and a majority of votes in a majority of States.\n\nThe Commonwealth Constitution also provides that the States can agree to refer any of their powers to the Commonwealth. This may be achieved by way of an amendment to the Constitution via referendum (a vote on whether the proposed transfer of power from the States to the Commonwealth, or vice versa, should be implemented). More commonly powers may be transferred by passing other acts of legislation which authorise the transfer and such acts require the legislative agreement of all the state governments involved. This \"transfer\" legislation may have a \"sunset clause\", a legislative provision that nullifies the transfer of power after a specified period, at which point the original division of power is restored.\n\nIn addition, Australia has several \"territories\", two of which are self-governing:  the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) and the [[Northern Territory]] (NT).  These territories' legislatures, their Assemblies, exercise powers devolved to them by the Commonwealth;  the Commonwealth Parliament remains able to override their legislation and to alter their powers.  Australian citizens in these territories are represented by members of both houses of the Commonwealth Parliament.  The territory of [[Norfolk Island]] was self-governing from 1979 until 2016, although it was never  represented as such in the Commonwealth Parliament.  The other territories that are regularly inhabited{{mdash}}[[Jervis Bay Territory|Jervis Bay]], [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]{{mdash}}have never been self-governing.\n\nThe federal nature of the Commonwealth and the structure of the [[Parliament of Australia]] were the subject of protracted negotiations among the colonies during the drafting of the Constitution. The [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] is elected on a basis that reflects the differing populations of the States. Thus [[New South Wales]] has 48 members while [[Tasmania]] has only five.  But the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] is elected on a basis of equality among the States: all States elect 12 Senators, regardless of population. This was intended to allow the Senators of the smaller States to form a majority and thus be able to amend or reject bills originating in the House of Representatives. The ACT and the NT each elect two Senators.\n\nThe third level of government after Commonwealth and State/Territory is [[Local government in Australia|Local government]], in the form of [[shire]]s, towns and cities. The Councils of these areas are composed of elected representatives (known as either [[councillor]] or [[alderman]], depending on the State), usually serving part-time.  Their powers are devolved to them by the State or Territory in which they are located.\n\nGovernment at the Commonwealth level and the State/Territory level is undertaken by three inter-connected arms of government:\n\n* Legislature: The [[Parliament of Australia|Commonwealth Parliament]]\n* Executive: The Sovereign of Australia, whose executive power is exercisable by the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, Ministers and their Departments\n* Judiciary: The [[High Court of Australia]] and subsidiary Federal courts.\n\n''[[Separation of powers]]'' is the principle whereby the three arms of government undertake their activities largely separately from each other:\n\n* the Legislature proposes laws in the form of Bills, and provides a legislative framework for the operations of the other two arms;  the sovereign is formally a part of the Parliament, but takes no active role in these matters, except that (representing the sovereign) Governors-General, State Governors and Territory Administrators sign enactments into law through providing Royal Assent\n* the Executive administers the laws and carries out the tasks assigned to it by legislation\n* the Judiciary hears cases arising from the administration of the law, applying both [[statute law]] and the [[common law]];  the Australian courts cannot give an [[advisory opinions|advisory opinion]] on the constitutionality of a law, but the [[High Court of Australia]] can determine whether an existing law is constitutional\n* the Judiciary is appointed by the sovereign's representatives, on the advice of the Commonwealth  or State/Territory government;  but the Legislature and the Executive should  not try to influence its decisions.\n\n==Legislature==\n{{main|Parliament of Australia}}\n[[File:Australian Senate - Parliament of Australia.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Australian Senate]] chamber]]\nThe Legislature makes the laws, and supervises the activities of the other two arms with a view to changing the laws when appropriate. The [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] is [[bicameral]], consisting of the [[Queen of Australia]], a 76-member [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and a 151-member [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].\n\nTwelve Senators from each state are elected for six-year terms, using [[proportional representation]] and the [[single transferable vote]] (known in Australia as \"quota-preferential voting\": see [[Australian electoral system]]), with half elected every three years. In addition to the state Senators, two senators are elected by voters from the [[Northern Territory]] (which for this purpose includes the Indian Ocean Territories, [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]), while another two senators are elected by the voters of the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (which for this purpose includes the [[Jervis Bay Territory]]). Senators from the territories are also elected using preferential voting, but their term of office is not fixed;  it starts on the day of a general election for the House of Representatives and ends on the day before the next such election.\n\nThe members of the House of Representatives are elected by majority-preferential<ref>{{cite web |url=https://researchers.anu.edu.au/publications/4497 |title=Australia: Replacing Plurality Rule with Majority-Preferential Voting |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.}}</ref> voting using the non-proportional [[Instant-runoff voting]] system<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/closer-look/short-history/the-first-parliament.html |title=The first Parliament: Developments in the Parliament of Australia |publisher=Parliamentary Education Office of the Government of Australia}}</ref> from single-member constituencies allocated among the states and territories.  In ordinary legislation, the two chambers have co-ordinate powers, but all proposals for appropriating revenue or imposing taxes must be introduced in the House of Representatives. Under the prevailing [[Westminster system]], the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the support of a majority of the members in the House of Representatives is invited to form a government and is named [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]].\n[[File:Australian House of Representatives - Parliament of Australia.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Australian House of Representatives]] chamber]]\nThe Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to the Parliament, of which they must, in most circumstances, be members. General elections are held at least once every three years. The Prime Minister has a discretion to advise the Governor-General to call an election for the House of Representatives at any time, but Senate elections can only be held within certain periods prescribed in the Constitution. The most recent general election was on [[2019 Australian federal election|18 May 2019]].\n\nThe Commonwealth Parliament and all the state and territory legislatures operate within the conventions of the [[Westminster system]], with a recognised [[List of Australian Opposition Leaders|Leader of the Opposition]], usually the leader of the largest party outside the government, and a [[Shadow Cabinet]] of Opposition members who \"shadow\" each member of the Ministry, asking questions on matters within the Minister's portfolio. Although the Government, by virtue of commanding a majority of members in the lower house of the legislature, can usually pass its legislation and control the workings of the house, the Opposition can considerably delay the passage of legislation and obstruct government business if it chooses.\n\nThe day-to-day business of the [[House of Representatives of Australia|House of Representatives]] is usually negotiated between the [[Leader of the House (Australia)|Leader of the House]], appointed by the Prime Minister, and the [[Manager of Opposition Business in the House (Australia)|Manager of Opposition Business in the House]], appointed by the [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the Commonwealth parliament, currently [[Anthony Albanese]].\n\n==Executive==\n\n===Head of state===\n{{main|Monarchy of Australia | Governor-General of Australia}}\n\nThe [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] dates from 1901, when the [[British Dominions|Dominions]] of the [[British Empire]] were not sovereign states, and does not use the term \"head of state\". As Australia is a [[constitutional monarchy]], government and academic sources describe the Queen as head of state.<ref>The Constitution (2012) Overview by the Attorney-General's Department and Australian Government Solicitor [https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005Q00193]</ref> In practice, the role of head of state of Australia is divided between two people, the [[Queen of Australia]] and the [[Governor-General of Australia]], who is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Australia]]. Though in many respects the Governor-General is the Queen's representative, and exercises various constitutional powers in her name, they independently exercise many important powers in their own right. The governor-general represents Australia internationally, making and receiving state visits.<ref>{{cite web | title = Governor-General's Role | publisher = Office of the Governor-General | date = 20 July 2015 | url = http://www.gg.gov.au/governor-generals-role | accessdate = 1 March 2015 }}</ref>\n[[File:Government House Canberra.JPG|thumb|left|[[Government House, Canberra]]]]\nThe [[Monarch|Sovereign]] of Australia, currently [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], is also the Sovereign of fifteen other [[Commonwealth realm]]s including the United Kingdom. Like the other [[British Dominions|Dominions]], Australia gained legislative independence from the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] by virtue of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], which was adopted in Australia in 1942 with retrospective effect from 3 September 1939. By the [[Royal Style and Titles Act 1953]], the Australian Parliament gave the Queen the title [[Queen of Australia]], and in 1973 titles with any reference to her status as [[Queen of the United Kingdom]] and [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]] as well were removed, making her Queen of Australia.\n\nSection 61 of the Constitution provides that 'The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor\u2011General as the Queen's representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth'. Section 2 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] provides that a [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] shall represent the Queen in Australia. In practice, the Governor-General carries out all the functions usually performed by a head of state, without reference to the Queen.\n\nUnder the conventions of the [[Westminster system]] the Governor-General's powers are almost always exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister or other ministers. The Governor-General retains [[reserve powers]] similar to those possessed by the Queen in the United Kingdom. These are rarely exercised, but during the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|Australian constitutional crisis of 1975]] Governor-General Sir [[John Kerr (Governor-General)|John Kerr]] used them independently of the Queen and the Prime Minister.\n\nAustralia has periodically experienced movements seeking to end the monarchy. In a [[1999 Australian republic referendum|1999 referendum]], the Australian people voted on a proposal to change the Constitution. The proposal would have removed references to the [[Queen of Australia|Queen]] from the Constitution and replaced the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] with a President nominated by the Prime Minister, but subject to the approval of a two-thirds majority of both Houses of the Parliament. The proposal was defeated. The [[Australian Republican Movement]] continues to campaign for an end to the monarchy in Australia, opposed by [[Australians for Constitutional Monarchy]] and [[Australian Monarchist League]].\n\n{{further|Constitutional history of Australia|Australian republicanism|Australian head of state dispute}}\n\n===Executive Council===\n{{main|Federal Executive Council (Australia)}}\nThe Federal Executive Council is a formal body which exists and meets to give legal effect to decisions made by the Cabinet, and to carry out various other functions. All Ministers are members of the Executive Council and are entitled to be styled \"[[The Honourable]]\", a title which they retain for life. The [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] usually presides at Council meetings, but in his or her absence another Minister nominated as the [[Vice-President of the Executive Council]] presides at the meeting of the Council. Since 20 December 2017, the Vice-President of the Federal Executive Council has been Senator [[Mathias Cormann]].\n\nThere are times when the government acts in a [[Caretaker government of Australia|\"caretaker\" capacity]], principally in the period prior to and immediately following a general election.\n\n===Cabinet===\n{{main|Cabinet of Australia|List of Australian Ministers}}\n\nThe Cabinet of Australia is the council of senior Ministers of the Crown, responsible to the Federal Parliament. The ministers are appointed by the Governor-General, on the advice of the Prime Minister, who serve at the former's pleasure. Cabinet meetings are strictly private and occur once a week where vital issues are discussed and policy formulated. Outside the cabinet there is an outer ministry and also a number of junior ministers, called Parliamentary secretaries, responsible for a specific policy area and reporting directly to a senior Cabinet minister.\n\nThe Constitution of Australia does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; it exists solely by convention. Its decisions do not in and of themselves have legal force. However, it serves as the practical expression of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]], which is Australia's highest formal governmental body. In practice, the Federal Executive Council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet. All members of the Cabinet are members of the Executive Council. While the Governor-General is nominal presiding officer, he almost never attends Executive Council meetings. A senior member of the Cabinet holds the office of Vice-President of the Executive Council and acts as presiding officer of the Executive Council in the absence of the Governor-General.\n\nUntil 1956 all members of the ministry were members of the Cabinet. The growth of the ministry in the 1940s and 1950s made this increasingly impractical, and in 1956 [[Robert Menzies]] created a two-tier ministry, with only senior ministers holding Cabinet rank, also known within parliament as the [[front bench]]. This practice has been continued by all governments except the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Government.\n\nWhen the non-Labor parties are in power, the Prime Minister makes all Cabinet and ministerial appointments at their own discretion, although in practice they consult with senior colleagues in making appointments. When the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] and its predecessors (the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]] and the [[United Australia Party]]) have been in coalition with the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] or its predecessor the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]], the leader of the junior Coalition party has had the right to nominate their party's members of the Coalition ministry, and to be consulted by the Prime Minister on the allocation of their portfolios.\n\nWhen the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] first held office under [[Chris Watson]], Watson assumed the right to choose members of his Cabinet. In 1907, however, the party decided that future Labor Cabinets would be elected by the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party, the [[Caucus]], and the Prime Minister would retain the right to allocate portfolios. This practice was followed until 2007. Between 1907 and 2007, Labor Prime Ministers exercised a predominant influence over who was elected to Labor ministries, although the leaders of the party factions also exercised considerable influence. Prior to the [[2007 Australian general election|2007 general election]], the then Leader of the Opposition, [[Kevin Rudd]], said that he and he alone would choose the ministry should he become Prime Minister. His party won the election and he chose the ministry, as he said he would.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/29/2046939.htm |title=Rudd seizes power from factions |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 September 2007 |first=Ben |last=Worsley}}</ref>\n\nThe cabinet meets not only in Canberra but also in state capitals, most frequently Sydney and Melbourne.
