{"title_page": "Proteolysis targeting chimera", "text_new": "A '''proteolysis targeting chimera''' ('''PROTAC''') is a heterobifunctional small molecule composed of two active domains and a linker capable of removing specific unwanted proteins. Rather than acting as a conventional enzyme inhibitor, a PROTAC works by inducing selective [[intracellular]] [[proteolysis]]. PROTACs consist of two covalently linked protein-binding molecules: one capable of engaging an [[Ubiquitin ligase|E3 ubiquitin ligase]], and another that binds to a target protein meant for degradation. Recruitment of the E3 ligase to the target protein results in [[ubiquitin]]ation and subsequent degradation of the target protein by the [[proteasome]]. Because PROTACs need only to bind their targets with high selectivity (rather than inhibit the target protein's enzymatic activity), there are currently many efforts to retool previously ineffective inhibitor molecules as PROTACs for next-generation drugs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cermakova K, Hodges HC | title = Next-Generation Drugs and Probes for Chromatin Biology: From Targeted Protein Degradation to Phase Separation | journal = Molecules | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages = 1958 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30082609 | pmc = 6102721 | doi = 10.3390/molecules23081958 }}</ref>\n\nInitially described by Kathleen Sakamoto, [[Craig M.

The decks of cards, along with the user's statistics, are stored in the open [[SQLite]] format.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Notes===\nCards are generated from information stored as \"notes\". Notes are analogous to database entries and can have an arbitrary number of fields. For example, with respect to learning a language, a note may have the following fields and example entries:\n* Field 1: Expression in target language \u2013 {{lang|fr|\"g\u00e2teau\"}}\n* Field 2: Pronunciation \u2013 [sound file with the word {{lang|fr|\"g\u00e2teau\"}} pronounced]\n* Field 3: Meaning of expression in familiar language \u2013 \"cake\"\nThis example illustrates what some programs call a [[three-sided flashcard]], but Anki's model is more general and allows any number of fields to be combined in various cards.\n\nThe user can design cards that test the information contained in each note. One card may have a question (expression) and an answer (pronunciation, meaning).\n\nBy keeping the separate cards linked to the same fact, spelling mistakes can be adjusted against all cards at the same time and Anki can ensure that related cards are not shown in too short a spacing.\n\nA special note type allows for generation of [[cloze deletion]] cards (in Anki 1.2.x, those were ordinary cards with cloze markup added using a tool in the fact editor).\n\n===Syncing===\nAnki supports synchronization with a free (but proprietary) online server called AnkiWeb.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ankiweb.net|title=Anki - friendly, intelligent flashcards|work=ankiweb.net}}</ref> This allows users to keep decks synchronized across multiple computers, and to study online or on a cell phone.\n\nThere is a third-party open source ([[Affero General Public License|AGPLv3]]) AnkiServer software which users can run on their own local computers or servers, though it is not compatible with recent Anki versions. It also provides a RESTful API for manipulating Anki collections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/dsnopek/anki-sync-server|title=dsnopek/anki-sync-server|work=GitHub|date=2019-07-24}}</ref>\n\n===Japanese and Chinese reading generation===\nAnki can automatically fill in the reading of Japanese and Chinese text. Since version 0.9.9.8.2, these features are in separate plug-ins.\n\n===Add-ons===\nMore than 500 [[plug-in (computing)|add-ons]] for Anki are available,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/|title=Add-ons for Anki 2.0|work=ankiweb.net}}</ref> often written by third-party [[software developer|developers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/addons.html|title=Writing Anki 2.0.x Add-ons|work=ankiweb.net}}</ref> They provide support for [[speech synthesis]], enhanced user statistics, image occlusion, [[incremental reading]], allow for more efficient editing and creation of cards through batch editing, modify the GUI (such as through intermittent display of puppies), simplify import of flashcards from other digital sources, add an element of gamification,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1818932105|title=AnkiEmperor - Gamification for Anki - AnkiWeb|website=ankiweb.net|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> etc.\n\n=== Shared Decks ===\nWhile Anki's user manual encourages the creation of one's own decks for most material, there is still a large and active database of Shared Decks that users can download and use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#downloading-shared-decks|title=Anki Manual|website=apps.ankiweb.net|language=en|access-date=2018-08-26}}</ref> Available decks range from foreign language decks (often constructed with frequency tables) to geography, physics, biology, chemistry and more.

Since version 0.9.9.8.2, these features are in separate plug-ins.\n\n===Add-ons===\nMore than 500 [[plug-in (computing)|add-ons]] for Anki are available,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/|title=Add-ons for Anki 2.0|work=ankiweb.net}}</ref> often written by third-party [[software developer|developers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/addons.html|title=Writing Anki 2.0.x Add-ons|work=ankiweb.net}}</ref> They provide support for [[speech synthesis]], enhanced user statistics, image occlusion, [[incremental reading]], allow for more efficient editing and creation of cards through batch editing, modify the GUI (such as through intermittent display of puppies), simplify import of flashcards from other digital sources, add an element of gamification,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1818932105|title=AnkiEmperor - Gamification for Anki - AnkiWeb|website=ankiweb.net|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> etc.\n\n=== Shared Decks ===\nWhile Anki's user manual encourages the creation of one's own decks for most material, there is still a large and active database of Shared Decks that users can download and use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#downloading-shared-decks|title=Anki Manual|website=apps.ankiweb.net|language=en|access-date=2018-08-26}}</ref> Available decks range from foreign language decks (often constructed with frequency tables) to geography, physics, biology, chemistry and more. Various medical science decks, often made by multiple users in collaboration, are also available. \n\n==Comparisons==\nAnki's scheduling algorithm is based on an older version of the SuperMemo algorithm (SM2). The Anki author states that versions 3\u20135 of the SuperMemo algorithm are more susceptible to incorrect scheduling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#what-algorithm|title=Anki Manual|work=ankisrs.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ankisrs/7X7iELcP7f4/8KRIfbLJSDgJ|title=Google Groups|work=google.com}}</ref> The latest SuperMemo algorithm in 2019 is SM18.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Three_Decades:_From_SuperMemo_1.0_to_SuperMemo_18.0|title=Three Decades: From SuperMemo 1.0 to SuperMemo 18.0|date=22 Sep 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Mobile versions==\nThe following smartphone/tablet and Web clients are available as companions to the desktop version:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apps.ankiweb.net/#ios|title=Anki - powerful, intelligent flashcards|work=ankisrs.net|quote=AnkiMobile is a paid companion to the free computer program,|date=29 Oct 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/FAQ#do-i-need-anki-desktop-too|title=Anki-Android Wiki: FAQ: Do I need Anki Desktop too?|quote=AnkiDroid is designed primarily as a tool for reviewing cards created with Anki Desktop, rather than as a complete replacement for it.|date=29 Oct 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ankiweb.net/about|title=About - AnkiWeb|quote=AnkiWeb is intended to be used in conjunction with the computer version of Anki.

With AnkiDroid it is possible to have the flashcards read in several languages using [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] (TTS). If a language does not exist in the Android TTS engine (e.g. Russian in the Android version Ice Cream Sandwich), a different TTS engine  such as SVOX TTS Classic can be used.\n\n==History==\nThe oldest mention of Anki that the developer, Damien Elmes, could find in 2011 was dated October 5, 2006<!-- (which may be <span title=\"* initial import from forcer's last version\">the first entry in the ChangeLog file for an [[Emacs]]-based spaced repetition program, [http://ichi2.net/flashcard/index.html Flashcard])-->, which was thus declared Anki's birthdate.<ref>[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/anki-users/M8mDFN7-H-I/discussion Happy birthday, Anki!], a thread started by Damien Elmes in the ankisrs Google Group on 2011-10-05.</ref>\n\nIn 2010, [[Roger Craig (Jeopardy! contestant)|Roger Craig]] obtained the then-all-time record for single-day winnings on the [[Game Show|quiz show]] ''[[Jeopardy!]]''<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|title=Record Set On 'Jeopardy!'|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 15, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/arts/television/16arts-RECORDSETONJ_BRF.html?_r=1|accessdate=September 20, 2010}}</ref> after using Anki to memorize a vast number of facts.<ref name=\"Baker 2011\">{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Stephen|author-link=Stephen L.

Estimates report that as of 2018, over 45% of US allopathic medical students use Anki as a primary learning source. Some third-party resources, such as Boards and Beyond, have Anki decks based on them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/8rdcqz/lightyear_a_boards_and_beyond_based_step_1_anki/|title=r/medicalschoolanki - LIGHTYEAR: A Boards and Beyond based STEP 1 Anki deck (~22.5k cards)|website=reddit|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boardsbeyond.com/how-to-use-boards-and-beyond|title=Boards and Beyond|last=Ryan|first=Jason|date=|website=Boards and Beyond|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=03/25/2020}}</ref>\n\n==Copera Inc.'s Anki for Palm OS==\nAn unrelated flashcard program called Anki for Palm OS<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eichert.com/copera.com/anki.com/index.html|title=About Anki for Palm OS|work=Mirror of old anki.com website}}</ref> was created by Copera, Inc.
