The group's first round of matches began on 14 June and its last matches were played on 21 June. All six group matches were played either at the [[Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Chateau Carreras|Estadio Chateau Carreras]] in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]], or the [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|Estadio Monumental]] in the capital [[Buenos Aires]]. The group consisted of [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] (the Defending Champions) as well as the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] (the former runners up), [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. The Netherlands advanced to the final match, and Italy advanced to the third place match.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Cup Guide - 1978 Argentina |url=http://www.worldcupbrazil.net/world-cup-history/world-cup-70s-90s/1978-argentina/|work=worldcupbrazil.net|accessdate=5 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Qualified teams==\nThe winners of Group 1 and 3 and the runners-up of Group 2 and 4 qualified for Group A of the second round.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They started well when an unmarked [[Ernie Brandts]] headed in [[Arie Haan]]'s free kick. The Dutch then won a penalty kick after [[Gerhard Breitenberger (footballer, born 1954)|Gerhard Breitenberger]] fouled [[Wim Jansen]] and [[Rob Rensenbrink]] neatly scored. Rensenbrink then took advantage of some poor defending to provide assist for [[Johnny Rep]] to score on either side of half time. Austria which created several chances and were unlucky to score in the first half got one back in the eightieth minute when defender [[Erich Obermayer]] scored a brilliant lob over the Dutch goalkeeper for a goal. The Dutch weren't to be deterred as Rensenbrink provided yet another assist this time [[Willy van de Kerkhof]] to score just two minutes later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Austria - Netherlands Match Report

anticipated match was a repeat of the [[1974 FIFA World Cup Final]], with the Netherlands fielding six players who had played that day and West Germany four. The match official [[Ram\u00f3n Barreto]] of Uruguay coincidentally had also been one of the linesmen at the 1974 final.\n\nThe 1974 final has started with the Dutch scoring within a two minutes, and in this game there was another early goal although it went the German's way. The Dutch goaltender [[Piet Schrijvers]] could only parry [[Rainer Bonhof]]'s free kick right into the path of [[R\u00fcdiger Abramczik]] who headed home. The Netherlands equalized around the thirty-minute mark when [[Arie Haan]] let fly from 35 yards and into the top corner.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~goldkeep/Holland78/WGermany.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716205213/http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~goldkeep/Holland78/WGermany.htm |archive-date=16 July 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nKnowing a draw would be enough Netherlands refrained from taking chances in the second half. Against the run of play West Germany were awarded a soft free-kick, the Dutch were complaining with the referee and did not keep their concentration [[Erich Beer]] crossed for [[Dieter M\u00fcller]] to power in a header. The goal gave the Netherlands the momentum to score though and eight minutes from time [[Ren\u00e9 van de Kerkhof]] took a pass from his twin brother [[Willy van de Kerkhof|Willy]], cut inside a defender and smashed home. There would be a few more chances as [[Johnny Rep]] hit the woodwork and Schrijvers was forced to save from Beer.\n\nThe end of the game ended in bizarre fashion, with substitute [[Dick Nanninga]] shown a yellow card for an off the ball incident and then seconds later referee Barreto showed the same player a red card for apparently laughing at the decision to give him a card. It took five minutes to restore order on the field as the bewildered Nanninga was led off.\n\n{{football box\n|date = 18 June 1978\n|time = 16:45 [[Time in Argentina|ART]]\n|team1 = {{fb-rt|NED}}\n|score = 2\u20132\n|report = https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/argentina1978/matches/match/2348\n|team2 = {{fb|FRG}}\n|goals1 = [[Arie Haan|Haan]] {{goal|27}}<br />[[Ren\u00e9 van de Kerkhof|R. van de Kerkhof]] {{goal|82}}\n|goals2 = [[R\u00fcdiger Abramczik|Abramczik]] {{goal|3}}<br />[[Dieter M\u00fcller|D.

place in the final, although the Netherlands could advance with a draw and a Germany draw or loss. Italy started the positive and scored when [[Ernie Brandts]] in an attempt to stop [[Roberto Bettega]] only succeeded in putting the ball into his own net. The goal would have consequences for the Netherlands as [[Piet Schrijvers]] was injured on the play and had to be stretchered off for [[Jan Jongbloed]]. Italy dominated the remainder of the first half. In a physical match [[Johnny Rep]] was cautioned for fouling [[Romeo Benetti]], who was later to pick up a yellow card himself for fouling Rensenbrink, meaning the Italian defender would miss the match should Italy reach it. Early in the second half [[Arie Haan]] was cautioned for a challenge on [[Marco Tardelli]] who later also picked up a yellow card meaning he too would miss Italy's next match.

They started well when an unmarked [[Ernie Brandts]] headed in [[Arie Haan]]'s free kick. The Dutch then won a penalty kick after [[Gerhard Breitenberger (footballer, born 1954)|Gerhard Breitenberger]] fouled [[Wim Jansen]] and [[Rob Rensenbrink]] neatly scored. Rensenbrink then took advantage of some poor defending to provide assist for [[Johnny Rep]] to score on either side of half time. Austria which created several chances and were unlucky to score in the first half got one back in the eightieth minute when defender [[Erich Obermayer]] scored a brilliant lob over the Dutch goalkeeper for a goal. The Dutch weren't to be deterred as Rensenbrink provided yet another assist this time [[Willy van de Kerkhof]] to score just two minutes later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Austria - Netherlands Match Report

anticipated match was a repeat of the [[1974 FIFA World Cup Final]], with the Netherlands fielding six players who had played that day and West Germany four. The match official [[Ram\u00f3n Barreto]] of Uruguay coincidentally had also been one of the linesmen at the 1974 final.\n\nThe 1974 final has started with the Dutch scoring within a two minutes, and in this game there was another early goal although it went the German's way. The Dutch goaltender [[Piet Schrijvers]] could only parry [[Rainer Bonhof]]'s free kick right into the path of [[R\u00fcdiger Abramczik]] who headed home. The Netherlands equalized around the thirty-minute mark when [[Arie Haan]] let fly from 35 yards and into the top corner.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~goldkeep/Holland78/WGermany.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716205213/http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~goldkeep/Holland78/WGermany.htm |archive-date=16 July 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nKnowing a draw would be enough Netherlands refrained from taking chances in the second half. Against the run of play West Germany were awarded a soft free-kick, the Dutch were complaining with the referee and did not keep their concentration [[Erich Beer]] crossed for [[Dieter M\u00fcller]] to power in a header. The goal gave the Netherlands the momentum to score though and eight minutes from time [[Ren\u00e9 van de Kerkhof]] took a pass from his twin brother [[Willy van de Kerkhof|Willy]], cut inside a defender and smashed home. There would be a few more chances as [[Johnny Rep]] hit the woodwork and Schrijvers was forced to save from Beer.\n\nThe end of the game ended in bizarre fashion, with substitute [[Dick Nanninga]] shown a yellow card for an off the ball incident and then seconds later referee Barreto showed the same player a red card for apparently laughing at the decision to give him a card. It took five minutes to restore order on the field as the bewildered Nanninga was led off.\n\n{{football box\n|date = 18 June 1978\n|time = 16:45 [[Time in Argentina|ART]]\n|team1 = {{fb-rt|NED}}\n|score = 2\u20132\n|report = https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/argentina1978/matches/match/2348\n|team2 = {{fb|FRG}}\n|goals1 = [[Arie Haan|Haan]] {{goal|27}}<br />[[Ren\u00e9 van de Kerkhof|R. van de Kerkhof]] {{goal|82}}\n|goals2 = [[R\u00fcdiger Abramczik|Abramczik]] {{goal|3}}<br />[[Dieter M\u00fcller|D.

place in the final, although the Netherlands could advance with a draw and a Germany draw or loss. Italy started the positive and scored when [[Ernie Brandts]] in an attempt to stop [[Roberto Bettega]] only succeeded in putting the ball into his own net. The goal would have consequences for the Netherlands as [[Piet Schrijvers]] was injured on the play and had to be stretchered off for [[Jan Jongbloed]]. Italy dominated the remainder of the first half. In a physical match [[Johnny Rep]] was cautioned for fouling [[Romeo Benetti]], who was latter to pick up a yellow card himself for fouling Rensenbrink, meaning the Italian defender would miss the match should Italy reach it. Early in the second half [[Arie Haan]] was cautioned for a challenge on [[Marco Tardelli]] who later also picked up a yellow card meaning he too would miss Italy's next match. Some felt that [[Antonio Cabrini]]'s challenge on Haan many felt warranted a red card, not just a yellow. Shortly after half time Brandts, who earlier scored an own goal blasted home a shot to equalizes. Than fourteen minutes from time Haan hit an audacious shot 30 yards out that went off Zoff's left post an into the net.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~goldkeep/Holland78/Italy.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622075829/http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~goldkeep/Holland78/Italy.htm |archive-date=22 June 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{{football box\n|date = 21 June 1978\n|time = 13:45 [[Time in Argentina|ART]]\n|team1 = {{fb-rt|ITA}}\n|score = 1\u20132\n|report = https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/argentina1978/matches/match/2391\n|team2 = {{fb|NED}}\n|goals1 = [[Ernie Brandts|Brandts]] {{goal|19|o.g.}}\n|goals2 = [[Ernie Brandts|Brandts]] {{goal|49}}<br />[[Arie Haan|Haan]] {{goal|76}}\n|stadium = [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|Estadio Monumental]], Buenos Aires\n|attendance = 67,433\n|referee = [[Angel Franco Mart\u00ednez]] ([[Royal Spanish Football Federation|Spain]]) }}\n\n{| width=\"100%\"\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n!width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"|\n|-\n|GK || '''1''' || [[Dino Zoff]] ([[Captain (association football)|c]])\n|-\n|DF || '''3''' || [[Antonio Cabrini]] || {{yel|65}}\n|-\n|DF || '''4''' || [[Antonello Cuccureddu]]\n|-\n|DF || '''5''' || [[Claudio Gentile]]\n|-\n|DF || '''8''' || [[Gaetano Scirea]]\n|-\n|MF || '''10''' || [[Romeo Benetti]] || {{yel|40}} || {{suboff|77}}\n|-\n|MF || '''14''' || [[Marco Tardelli]] || {{yel|70}}\n|-\n|MF || '''15''' || [[Renato Zaccarelli]]\n|-\n|MF || '''16''' || [[Franco Causio]] || || {{suboff|46}}\n|-\n|CF || '''18''' || [[Roberto Bettega]]\n|-\n|CF || '''21''' || [[Paolo Rossi]]\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Substitutions:'''\n|-\n|MF || '''17''' || [[Claudio Sala]] || || {{subon|46}}\n|-\n|FW || '''19''' || [[Francesco Graziani]] || || {{subon|72}}\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Manager:'''\n|-\n|colspan=3|[[Enzo Bearzot]]\n|}\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n!width=25| !!width=25|\n|-\n|GK || '''1''' || [[Piet Schrijvers]] || || {{suboff|21}}\n|-\n|DF || '''2''' || [[Jan Poortvliet]]\n|-\n|DF || '''5''' || [[Ruud Krol]] ([[Captain (association football)|c]])\n|-\n|DF || '''6''' || [[Wim Jansen]]\n|-\n|DF || '''22''' || [[Ernie Brandts]]\n|-\n|MF || '''13''' || [[Johan Neeskens]]\n|-\n|MF || '''9''' || [[Arie Haan]] || {{yel|50}}\n|-\n|MF|| '''10''' || [[Ren\u00e9 van de Kerkhof]]\n|-\n|MF || '''11''' || [[Willy van de Kerkhof]]\n|-\n|FW || '''16''' || [[Johnny Rep]] || {{yel|35}} || {{suboff|65}}\n|-\n|FW || '''12''' || [[Rob Rensenbrink]]\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Substitutions:'''\n|-\n|GK|| '''8''' || [[Jan Jongbloed]] || || {{subon|21}}\n|-\n|DF|| '''4''' || [[Adrie van Kraay]] || || {{subon|65}}\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Manager:'''\n|- \n|colspan=4|{{Flagicon|AUT}} [[Ernst Happel]]\n|}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{1978 FIFA World Cup}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:World}}\n[[Category:1978 FIFA World Cup|Groups]]\n[[Category:West Germany at the 1978 FIFA World Cup|G]]\n[[Category:Italy at the 1978 FIFA World Cup|Group]]\n[[Category:Austria at the 1978 FIFA World Cup|Group]]\n[[Category:Netherlands at the 1978 FIFA World Cup|Group]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eItaly vs Netherlands:Typo fixing, replaced: latter \u2192 later", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_FIFA_World_Cup_Group_A"}

It was founded in 1917 by [[Maria Dickin]] to provide care for sick and injured animals of the poor. It is the UK's leading veterinary charity, carrying out more than one million free veterinary consultations a year, and  was up to 2009 the largest private employer of fully qualified [[veterinary surgeon]]s and [[Paraveterinary workers|veterinary nurse]]s in the UK, only those living within the PDSA's catchment areas can use their services.\n\n== Foundation and development ==\n\nDuring [[World War I]], animal welfare pioneer Maria Dickin worked to improve the dreadful state of animal health in the [[Whitechapel]] area of [[London]]. She wanted to open a clinic where [[East End]]ers living in poverty could receive free treatment for their sick and injured animals.   Despite widespread scepticism, she opened her free \"dispensary\" in a Whitechapel basement on Saturday 17 November 1917. It was an immediate success and she was soon forced to find larger premises.\n\nWithin six years, Maria Dickin had designed and equipped her first horse-drawn clinic, and soon a fleet of mobile dispensaries was established. PDSA vehicles soon became a common sight throughout the country. Eventually, PDSA's role was defined by two [[Acts of Parliament]], in 1949 and 1956, that continue to govern its activities today.\n\n== PDSA Dickin Medal ==\n\n[[Maria Dickin]] instituted the [[Dickin Medal]] in 1943 to acknowledge outstanding acts of bravery by animals serving with the Armed Forces or Civil Defence units.  It has become recognised as the animals' [[Victoria Cross]], and is administered by PDSA.  The PDSA created a second animal bravery award, the [[PDSA Gold Medal]], in 2002, which is now recognised as the animal equivalent of the [[George Cross]].\n\n== Eligibility requirements ==\n\nToday, treatment is only available to the pets of those in receipt of [[Housing Benefit]] or [[Council Tax#Council Tax Benefit|Council Tax Benefit]] and who live in one of the charity's 'catchment areas'.  For those eligible, treatment for sick and injured animals is free of charge. Recently, the PDSA started providing eligible pet owners with preventive services such as [[neutering]], [[vaccinations]] and [[Microchip implant (animal)|microchipping]].  These services are the only treatments that are '''not''' free; however, they are offered at cost price.\n\nAlthough there is no cost for all treatments except for those of a preventive nature, PDSA asks clients to make a donation of whatever they can afford towards the treatment of their animal.\n\nCurrently, PDSA is able to offer its services to 75% of eligible people, and has plans to increase this to 80% over the coming year.<ref name=Stat1>{{cite web | url=http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/ScannedAccounts%5CEnds17%5C0000208217_ac_20051231_e_c.pdf |format=PDF| title = Annual Report, 2005 | publisher= PDSA | accessdate=2007-04-04}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2009 the PDSA began requesting a donation on checking the animal in for treatment.\n\n== Areas of operation ==\n\n[[File:Mothers, Erdington, Birmingham, England - 2019-04-27 - Andy Mabbett - 17 (cropped).jpg|thumb| A PDSA [[charity shop]] in Birmingham, England, seen in April 2019]]\n\nPDSA operates throughout [[Great Britain]] through animal hospitals and practices; a vast network of [[charity shop]]s support the organisation.

At that time, BJP's main rival [[Indian National Congress]] was highly influential in rural Gujarat. Modi and Shah worked together to decimate Congress in the rural areas. Their strategy was to find the second most influential leader in every village, and get him or her to join BJP. They created a network of 8,000 influential rural leaders who had lost elections to the ''pradhan'' (village chief) post in various villages.<ref name=\"Open_2014_Mind\"/>\n\nModi and Shah used the same strategy to reduce Congress' influence over the state's powerful [[co-operative]]s, which play an important role in the state's economy. In 1999, Shah was elected as the president of Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank (ADCB), the biggest cooperative bank in India. In Gujarat, such elections had traditionally been won on the [[Indian caste system|caste]] considerations, and the co-operative banks had traditionally been controlled by [[Patel]]s, [[Gaderia]]s and [[Kshatriya]]s.

He convinced Patel to appoint Shah as the chairman of the [[Gujarat State Financial Corporation]], a public sector financial institution which finances small and medium-scale enterprises. After [[Shankersinh Vaghela]] and some other leaders complained about Modi's growing clout in the Gujarat government, the party leadership moved Modi out of Gujarat, to the BJP headquarters in Delhi.

He was chosen not by Modi, but by Rajnath Singh, who had been impressed by the skills that Shah displayed in wresting control of various Congress-controlled organizations in Gujarat.<ref name=\"Open_2014_Mind\"/> The decision did not go down well with many in the party, who saw him as a liability owing to the criminal charges against him. Political analysts such as [[Shekhar Gupta]] termed the decision as a blunder.<ref name=\"Shekhar2014\">{{cite book |author=Shekhar Gupta |title=Anticipating India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TipIAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT369 |date=8 April 2014 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers India |isbn=978-93-5136-256-2 |page=369 }}</ref>\n\n=== Uttar Pradesh general elections ===\nShah's political career, which had declined after his arrest in 2010, revived after BJP's victory in the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 general election]]. In UP, where Shah was the in-charge, BJP and its allies won 73 out of 80 seats. Shah had been made in charge of BJP's UP campaigning on 12 June 2013, less than a year before the elections.<ref name=\"Caravan_Organiser_2014\"/> Since February 2012, Shah had spent considerable time in UP, trying to understand the reasons for the [[Samajwadi Party]]'s winning performance in the [[2012 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election|2012 UP Assembly elections]]. Shah realised that the voters were dissatisfied with the Samajwadi Party, which he believed had failed to keep its election promises after the win. He also took advantage of the [[Other Backward Classes|OBC]] voters' displeasure with the UP government's decision to create 4.5% [[reservation in India|reservation]] for the minorities within the 27% OBC quota in government jobs and education.<ref name=\"Caravan_Organiser_2014\"/>\n\nShah personally oversaw the candidate selection, emphasizing on the candidate's local clout and winning potential as the only criteria for selection, as opposed to the candidate's party loyalty or ideology. His team estimated that only 35% of the BJP's traditional supporters had actually voted in the UP elections. Therefore, he focused on door-to-door campaigning at the [[voting booth|booth]]-level. He set up a 7-to-10 member management committee for each of the 140,000 voting booths in the state. For each booth, his team collated lists of voters and reached out to them.<ref name=\"Caravan_Organiser_2014\"/> Shah's team used 450 GPS-enabled mobile vans (\"video [[Ratha|raths]]\") to reach out to the masses in remote areas, where media reach was negligible.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/140518/commentary-op-ed/article/sunday-interview-amit-shah |title=Sunday Interview: We had 450 video raths with GPS and I'd get feedback on my mobile, says Amit Shah |newspaper=Deccan Chronicle | date=18 May 2014 |author=Yojna Gosai }}</ref> Shah personally covered 76 out of 80 Lok Sabha constituencies.

For example, the RSS volunteers would cross-check a BJP worker's claims of having targeted a given number of households.<ref name=\"Caravan_Organiser_2014\"/> Shah also helped organize \"mega rallies\" for Modi. Like other major political parties, BJP provisioned one van per village to transport people to the rally venue. However, unlike others, Shah decided that BJP would not provide money for hiring these vehicles. Instead, he declared that the party workers organizing the transportation would be made the leaders of the BJP units in their respective villages. This strategy ensured that a number of local village leaders developed a stake in Modi's victory.<ref name=\"Open_2014_Mind\"/>\n\nCritics accused Shah of trying to polarize the UP voters along the religious lines. While visiting [[Ayodhya]] for a meeting with the party's local committee, he raised the [[Ram Janmabhoomi]] temple issue (see [[Ayodhya dispute]]). BJP fielded three candidates accused of inciting violence during the [[2013 Muzaffarnagar riots]]. These were seen as attempts to target the party's [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] base.<ref name=\"Caravan_Organiser_2014\"/> An [[First Information Report|FIR]] was registered against Shah for a speech in Muzaffarnagar, where he urged the voters to seek \"revenge\" through their votes.<ref name=\"MM_2014_importance\"/> He also took advantage of Shia Muslim antipathy towards Sunni Muslims in [[Lucknow]].<ref>[https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21627719-narendra-modi-relies-most-two-men-who-could-hardly-be-less-alike-enablers The enablers: Narendra Modi relies most on two men who could hardly be less alike], economist.com.</ref>\n\nShah also played an important role in BJP's election campaigning strategy outside Uttar Pradesh. He focused on building Modi's image as a strong leader. At times, he opposed even Modi on several strategic campaigning issues. For example, when Modi praised his opponent and prospective post-poll ally [[Mamata Banerjee]], Shah insisted that BJP must not divert from the \"Modi-versus-all\" tactic.<ref name=\"Outlook_2014_Feast\"/> Shah was also responsible for forging BJP's alliances with regional parties like [[Pattali Makkal Katchi]].<ref name=\"MM_2014_importance\"/>\n\n== BJP President  ==\n[[File:Modi congratulates Amit Shah as he becomes BJP President.jpg|thumb|Modi congratulates Amit Shah as he becomes BJP President]]\nIn July 2014, BJP's Central Parliamentary Board unanimously approved Shah's appointment as president of the party.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-07-09/news/51247833_1_bjp-president-rajnath-singh-nitin-gadkari |title=BJP strategist & Narendra Modi's confidant Amit Shah appointed party president |date=9 July 2014 |newspaper=Economic Times}}</ref> He was reelected BJP President unanimously on 24 January 2016.<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amit-shah-reelected-bjp-president/article8147827.ece Amit Shah re-elected BJP president].

At that time, BJP's main rival [[Indian National Congress]] was highly influential in rural Gujarat. Modi and Shah worked together to decimate Congress in the rural areas. Their strategy was to find the second most influential leader in every village, and get him or her to join BJP. They created a network of 8,000 influential rural leaders who had lost elections to the ''pradhan'' (village chief) post in various villages.<ref name=\"Open_2014_Mind\"/>\n\nModi and Shah used the same strategy to reduce Congress' influence over the state's powerful [[co-operative]]s, which play an important role in the state's economy. In 1999, Shah was elected as the president of Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank (ADCB), the biggest cooperative bank in India. In Gujarat, such elections had traditionally been won on the [[Indian caste system|caste]] considerations, and the co-operative banks had traditionally been controlled by [[Patel]]s, [[Gaderia]]s and [[Kshatriya]]s.

He convinced Patel to appoint Shah as the chairman of the [[Gujarat State Financial Corporation]], a public sector financial institution which finances small and medium-scale enterprises. After [[Shankersinh Vaghela]] and some other leaders complained about Modi's growing clout in the Gujarat government, the party leadership moved Modi out of Gujarat, to the BJP headquarters in Delhi.

He was chosen not by Modi, but by Rajnath Singh, who had been impressed by the skills that Shah displayed in wresting control of various Congress-controlled organizations in Gujarat.<ref name=\"Open_2014_Mind\"/> The decision did not go down well with many in the party, who saw him as a liability owing to the criminal charges against him. Political analysts such as [[Shekhar Gupta]] termed the decision as a blunder.<ref name=\"Shekhar2014\">{{cite book |author=Shekhar Gupta |title=Anticipating India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TipIAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT369 |date=8 April 2014 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers India |isbn=978-93-5136-256-2 |page=369 }}</ref>\n\n=== Uttar Pradesh general elections ===\nShah's political career, which had declined after his arrest in 2010, revived after BJP's victory in the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 general election]]. In UP, where Shah was the in-charge, BJP and its allies won 73 out of 80 seats. Shah had been made in charge of BJP's UP campaigning on 12 June 2013, less than a year before the elections.<ref name=\"Caravan_Organiser_2014\"/> Since February 2012, Shah had spent considerable time in UP, trying to understand the reasons for the [[Samajwadi Party]]'s winning performance in the [[2012 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election|2012 UP Assembly elections]]. Shah realised that the voters were dissatisfied with the Samajwadi Party, which he believed had failed to keep its election promises after the win. He also took advantage of the [[Other Backward Classes|OBC]] voters' displeasure with the UP government's decision to create 4.5% [[reservation in India|reservation]] for the minorities within the 27% OBC quota in government jobs and education.<ref name=\"Caravan_Organiser_2014\"/>\n\nShah personally oversaw the candidate selection, emphasizing on the candidate's local clout and winning potential as the only criteria for selection, as opposed to the candidate's party loyalty or ideology. His team estimated that only 35% of the BJP's traditional supporters had actually voted in the UP elections. Therefore, he focused on door-to-door campaigning at the [[voting booth|booth]]-level. He set up a 7-to-10 member management committee for each of the 140,000 voting booths in the state. For each booth, his team collated lists of voters and reached out to them.<ref name=\"Caravan_Organiser_2014\"/> Shah's team used 450 GPS-enabled mobile vans (\"video [[Ratha|raths]]\") to reach out to the masses in remote areas, where media reach was negligible.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/140518/commentary-op-ed/article/sunday-interview-amit-shah |title=Sunday Interview: We had 450 video raths with GPS and I'd get feedback on my mobile, says Amit Shah |newspaper=Deccan Chronicle | date=18 May 2014 |author=Yojna Gosai }}</ref> Shah personally covered 76 out of 80 Lok Sabha constituencies.

For example, the RSS volunteers would cross-check a BJP worker's claims of having targeted a given number of households.<ref name=\"Caravan_Organiser_2014\"/> Shah also helped organize \"mega rallies\" for Modi. Like other major political parties, BJP provisioned one van per village to transport people to the rally venue. However, unlike others, Shah decided that BJP would not provide money for hiring these vehicles. Instead, he declared that the party workers organizing the transportation would be made the leaders of the BJP units in their respective villages. This strategy ensured that a number of local village leaders developed a stake in Modi's victory.<ref name=\"Open_2014_Mind\"/>\n\nCritics accused Shah of trying to polarize the UP voters along the religious lines. While visiting [[Ayodhya]] for a meeting with the party's local committee, he raised the [[Ram Janmabhoomi]] temple issue (see [[Ayodhya dispute]]). BJP fielded three candidates accused of inciting violence during the [[2013 Muzaffarnagar riots]]. These were seen as attempts to target the party's [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] base.<ref name=\"Caravan_Organiser_2014\"/> An [[First Information Report|FIR]] was registered against Shah for a speech in Muzaffarnagar, where he urged the voters to seek \"revenge\" through their votes.<ref name=\"MM_2014_importance\"/> He also took advantage of Shia Muslim antipathy towards Sunni Muslims in [[Lucknow]].<ref>[https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21627719-narendra-modi-relies-most-two-men-who-could-hardly-be-less-alike-enablers The enablers: Narendra Modi relies most on two men who could hardly be less alike], economist.com.</ref>\n\nShah also played an important role in BJP's election campaigning strategy outside Uttar Pradesh. He focused on building Modi's image as a strong leader. At times, he opposed even Modi on several strategic campaigning issues. For example, when Modi praised his opponent and prospective post-poll ally [[Mamata Banerjee]], Shah insisted that BJP must not divert from the \"Modi-versus-all\" tactic.<ref name=\"Outlook_2014_Feast\"/> Shah was also responsible for forging BJP's alliances with regional parties like [[Pattali Makkal Katchi]].<ref name=\"MM_2014_importance\"/>\n\n== BJP President  ==\n[[File:Modi congratulates Amit Shah as he becomes BJP President.jpg|thumb|Modi congratulates Amit Shah as he becomes BJP President]]\nIn July 2014, BJP's Central Parliamentary Board unanimously approved Shah's appointment as president of the party.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-07-09/news/51247833_1_bjp-president-rajnath-singh-nitin-gadkari |title=BJP strategist & Narendra Modi's confidant Amit Shah appointed party president |date=9 July 2014 |newspaper=Economic Times}}</ref> He was reelected BJP President unanimously on 24 January 2016.<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amit-shah-reelected-bjp-president/article8147827.ece Amit Shah re-elected BJP president].

[[String theory]] and [[M-theory]] have been proposed as theories of everything. Over the past few centuries, two theoretical frameworks have been developed that, together, most closely resemble a TOE. These two theories upon which all modern physics rests are [[general relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]]. General relativity is a theoretical framework that only focuses on [[gravity]] for understanding the universe in regions of both large scale and high mass: stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc. On the other hand, quantum mechanics is a theoretical framework that only focuses on three non-gravitational forces for understanding the universe in regions of both small scale and low mass: sub-atomic particles, atoms, molecules, etc. Quantum mechanics successfully implemented the [[Standard Model]] that describes the three non-gravitational forces -- [[strong force|strong nuclear]], [[weak force|weak nuclear]], and [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] force -- as well as all observed elementary particles.<ref name=\"Hawking2006\">{{cite book |author=Stephen W.

To resolve the incompatibility, a theoretical framework revealing a deeper underlying reality, unifying gravity with the other three interactions, must be discovered to harmoniously integrate the realms of general relativity and quantum mechanics into a seamless whole: the TOE is a single theory that, in principle, is capable of describing all phenomena in the universe. \n\nIn pursuit of this goal, [[quantum gravity]] has become one area of active research. One example is [[string theory]], which evolved into a candidate for the TOE, but not without drawbacks (most notably, its lack of currently testable predictions) and controversy. String theory posits that at the [[Planck epoch|beginning of the universe]] (up to 10<sup>\u221243</sup> seconds after the Big Bang), the four fundamental forces were once a single fundamental force. According to string theory, every particle in the universe, at its most microscopic level ([[Planck length]]), consists of varying combinations of vibrating strings (or strands) with preferred patterns of vibration. String theory further claims that it is through these specific oscillatory patterns of strings that a particle of unique mass and force charge is created (that is to say, the [[electron]] is a type of string that vibrates one way, while the [[up quark]] is a type of string vibrating another way, and so forth).\n\n==Name==\nInitially, the term ''theory of everything'' was used with an ironic reference to various overgeneralized theories.

Newton's work in his ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy]]'' dealt with this in a further example of unification, in this case unifying [[Galileo]]'s work on terrestrial gravity, [[Kepler]]'s laws of planetary motion and the phenomenon of [[tide]]s by explaining these apparent actions at a distance under one single law: the law of [[universal gravitation]].<ref>{{cite book |page=255 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&pg=PA255 |title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy |volume=II |last1=Newton |first1=Sir Isaac |date=1729}}</ref>\n\nIn 1814, building on these results, [[Laplace]] famously suggested that a [[Laplace's demon|sufficiently powerful intellect]] could, if it knew the position and velocity of every particle at a given time, along with the laws of nature, calculate the position of any particle at any other time:<ref name=\"Carroll2010\">{{cite book <!-- Citation bot deny-->|author=Sean Carroll |title=[[From Eternity to Here: The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time]] |year=2010 |publisher=Penguin Group US |isbn=978-1-101-15215-7}}</ref>{{rp |ch 7}}\n\n{{quote|An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.|''Essai philosophique sur les probabilit\u00e9s'', Introduction. 1814}}\n\nLaplace thus envisaged a combination of gravitation and mechanics as a theory of everything. Modern [[quantum mechanics]] implies that [[Heisenberg uncertainty|uncertainty is inescapable]], and thus that Laplace's vision has to be amended: a theory of everything must include gravitation and quantum mechanics. Even ignoring quantum mechanics, [[chaos theory]] is sufficient to guarantee that the future of any sufficiently complex mechanical or astronomical system is unpredictable.\n\nIn 1820, [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] discovered a connection between electricity and magnetism, triggering decades of work that culminated in 1865, in [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s theory of [[electromagnetism]].

This launched his thirty-year voyage in search of the so-called \"unified field theory\" that he hoped would show that these two forces are really manifestations of one grand underlying principle. During these last few decades of his life, this quixotic quest isolated Einstein from the mainstream of physics. Understandably, the mainstream was instead far more excited about the newly emerging framework of quantum mechanics.

More than a half a century later, Einstein's dream of discovering a unified theory has become the Holy Grail of modern physics.Oh my god!\n\n===Late 20th century and the nuclear interactions===\nIn the twentieth century, the search for a unifying theory was interrupted by the discovery of the [[strong force|strong]] and [[weak force|weak]] nuclear forces (or interactions), which differ both from gravity and from electromagnetism. A further hurdle was the acceptance that in a TOE, quantum mechanics had to be incorporated from the start, rather than emerging as a consequence of a deterministic unified theory, as Einstein had hoped.\n\nGravity and electromagnetism could always peacefully coexist as entries in a list of classical forces, but for many years it seemed that gravity could not even be incorporated into the quantum framework, let alone unified with the other fundamental forces. For this reason, work on unification, for much of the twentieth century, focused on understanding the three \"quantum\" forces: electromagnetism and the weak and strong forces. The first two were [[electroweak interaction|combined]] in 1967\u201368 by [[Sheldon Glashow]], [[Steven Weinberg]], and [[Abdus Salam]] into the \"electroweak\" force.<ref>Weinberg (1993), Ch. 5</ref>\nElectroweak unification is a [[broken symmetry]]: the electromagnetic and weak forces appear distinct at low energies because the particles carrying the weak force, the [[W and Z bosons]], have non-zero masses of {{val|80.4|u=GeV/c2}} and {{val|91.2|u=GeV/c2}}, whereas the [[photon]], which carries the electromagnetic force, is massless. At higher energies Ws and Zs can be [[matter creation|created]] easily and the unified nature of the force becomes apparent.\n\nWhile the strong and electroweak forces peacefully coexist in the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, they remain distinct. So far, the quest for a theory of everything is thus unsuccessful on two points: neither a unification of the strong and electroweak forces&nbsp;\u2013 which Laplace would have called 'contact forces'&nbsp;\u2013 nor a unification of these forces with gravitation has been achieved.\n\n==Modern physics==\n\n===Conventional sequence of theories===\nA Theory of Everything would unify all the [[fundamental interaction]]s of nature: [[gravitation]], [[strong interaction]], [[weak interaction]], and [[electromagnetism]]. Because the weak interaction can transform [[elementary particles]] from one kind into another, the TOE should also yield a deep understanding of the various different kinds of possible particles. The usual assumed path of theories is given in the following graph, where each unification step leads one level up:\n\n{{tree chart/start}}\n{{tree chart| | | | |TOE| | TOE=Theory of everything }}\n{{tree chart| | | | | |!| | }}\n{{tree chart| | | | |QG| | QG=[[Quantum gravity]] }}\n{{tree chart| | | | | |!| | }}\n{{tree chart| |REL|-|^|-|GUT| | REL=[[General Relativity|Space Curvature]] | GUT=Electronuclear force ([[Grand Unified Theory|GUT]]) }}\n{{tree chart| | |!| | | | | |!| | }}\n{{tree chart| |SMC| | | |SMP| SMC=[[Lambda-CDM model|Standard model of cosmology]] | SMP=[[Standard model of particle physics]]}}\n{{tree chart| | | | | | | | |!| | }}\n{{tree chart| | | | |QCD|-|^|-|-|EWT| | QCD=[[Strong interaction]]<br />[[Special unitary group|SU(3)]] | EWT=[[Electroweak interaction]]<br />[[Special unitary group|SU(2)]] x [[Unitary group|U(1)]]<sub>[[hypercharge|Y]]</sub> }}\n{{tree chart| | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | }}\n{{tree chart| | | | | | | | |WNF|-|^|-|EMF||WNF=[[Weak interaction]]<br />[[Special unitary group|SU(2)]]|EMF=[[Electromagnetism]]<br />[[Unitary group|U(1)]]<sub>EM</sub>}}\n{{tree chart| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | }}\n{{tree chart| | | | | | | | | | | |EF|-|^|-|MF| |EF=[[Electricity]]|MF=[[Magnetism]] }}\n{{tree chart/end}}\n\nIn this graph, electroweak unification occurs at around 100 GeV, grand unification is predicted to occur at 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, and unification of the GUT force with gravity is expected at the [[Planck energy]], roughly 10<sup>19</sup> GeV.\n\nSeveral [[Grand Unified Theory|Grand Unified Theories]] (GUTs) have been proposed to unify electromagnetism and the weak and strong forces. Grand unification would imply the existence of an electronuclear force; it is expected to set in at energies of the order of 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, far greater than could be reached by any possible Earth-based [[particle accelerator]]. Although the simplest GUTs have been experimentally ruled out, the general idea, especially when linked with [[supersymmetry]], remains a favorite candidate in the theoretical physics community. Supersymmetric GUTs seem plausible not only for their theoretical \"beauty\", but because they naturally produce large quantities of dark matter, and because the inflationary force may be related to GUT physics (although it does not seem to form an inevitable part of the theory). Yet GUTs are clearly not the final answer; both the current standard model and all proposed GUTs are [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] which require the problematic technique of [[renormalization]] to yield sensible answers. This is usually regarded as a sign that these are only [[effective field theory|effective field theories]], omitting crucial phenomena relevant only at very high energies.<ref name=\"Carlip\" />\n\nThe final step in the graph requires resolving the separation between quantum mechanics and gravitation, often equated with [[general relativity]]. Numerous researchers concentrate their efforts on this specific step; nevertheless, no accepted theory of [[quantum gravity]]&nbsp;\u2013 and thus no accepted theory of everything&nbsp;\u2013 has emerged yet. It is usually assumed that the TOE will also solve the remaining problems of GUTs.\n\nIn addition to explaining the forces listed in the graph, a TOE may also explain the status of at least two candidate forces suggested by modern [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]: an [[inflation (cosmology)|inflationary force]] and [[dark energy]]. Furthermore, cosmological experiments also suggest the existence of [[dark matter]], supposedly composed of fundamental particles outside the scheme of the standard model. However, the existence of these forces and particles has not been proven.\n\n===String theory and M-theory===\n\n{{unsolved|physics|Is [[string theory]], [[superstring theory]], or [[M-theory]], or some other variant on this theme, a step on the road to a \"theory of everything\", or just a blind alley?}}\n\nSince the 1990s, some physicists such as [[Edward Witten]] believe that 11-dimensional [[M-theory]], which is described in some limits by one of the five [[perturbation theory|perturbative]] [[superstring theory|superstring theories]], and in another by the maximally-[[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] 11-dimensional [[supergravity]], is the theory of everything. However, there is no widespread consensus on this issue.\n\nA surprising property of [[string theory|string]]/[[M-theory]] is that extra dimensions are required for the theory's consistency. In this regard, string theory can be seen as building on the insights of the [[Kaluza\u2013Klein theory]], in which it was realized that applying general relativity to a five-dimensional universe (with one of them small and curled up){{clarify|date=March 2018}} looks from the four-dimensional perspective like the usual general relativity together with [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's electrodynamics]]. This lent credence to the idea of unifying [[gauge theory|gauge]] and [[gravity]] interactions, and to extra dimensions, but did not address the detailed experimental requirements. Another important property of string theory is its [[supersymmetry]], which together with extra dimensions are the two main proposals for resolving the [[hierarchy problem]] of the [[standard model]], which is (roughly) the question of why gravity is so much weaker than any other force. The extra-dimensional solution involves allowing gravity to propagate into the other dimensions while keeping other forces confined to a four-dimensional spacetime, an idea that has been realized with explicit stringy mechanisms.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16196251 |date=2005 |title=The Beauty of Branes |journal=Scientific American |pages=38\u201340 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1005-38 |url=http://randall.physics.harvard.edu/RandallCV/ScientificAm10-05.pdf |accessdate=August 13, 2012 |last1=Holloway |first1=M |volume=293 |issue=4 |bibcode=2005SciAm.293d..38H }}</ref>\n\nResearch into string theory has been encouraged by a variety of theoretical and experimental factors.

On the other hand, the scholars invoking G\u00f6del's Theorem appear, at least in some cases, to be referring not to the underlying rules, but to the understandability of the behavior of all physical systems, as when Hawking mentions arranging blocks into rectangles, turning the computation of [[prime number]]s into a physical question.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Hawking |first=Stephen\n |date=20 July 2002\n |title=G\u00f6del and the end of physics\n |url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/strings02/dirac/hawking/\n |accessdate=2009-12-01\n}}</ref> This definitional discrepancy may explain some of the disagreement among researchers.\n\n===Fundamental limits in accuracy===\n\nNo physical theory to date is believed to be precisely accurate. Instead, physics has proceeded by a series of \"successive approximations\" allowing more and more accurate predictions over a wider and wider range of phenomena. Some physicists believe that it\nis therefore a mistake to confuse theoretical models with the true nature of reality, and\nhold that the series of approximations will never terminate in the \"truth\". Einstein himself\nexpressed this view on occasions.<ref>Einstein, letter to Felix Klein, 1917. (On determinism and approximations.) Quoted in Pais (1982), Ch. 17.</ref> Following this view, we may reasonably hope for ''a'' theory of everything which self-consistently incorporates all currently known forces, but we should not expect it to be the final answer.\n\nOn the other hand, it is often claimed that, despite the apparently ever-increasing complexity of the mathematics of each new theory, in a deep sense associated with their underlying [[gauge symmetry]] and the number of [[dimensionless physical constant]]s, the theories are becoming simpler. If this is the case, the process of simplification cannot continue indefinitely.\n\n===Lack of fundamental laws===\nThere is a philosophical debate within the physics community as to whether a theory of everything deserves to be called ''the'' fundamental law of the universe.<ref>Weinberg (1993), Ch 2.</ref> One view is the hard [[reductionist]] position that the TOE is the fundamental law and that all other theories that apply within the universe are a consequence of the TOE. Another view is that [[emergence|emergent]] laws, which govern the behavior of [[complex system]]s, should be seen as equally fundamental. Examples of emergent laws are the [[second law of thermodynamics]] and the theory of [[natural selection]]. The advocates of emergence argue that emergent laws, especially those describing complex or living systems are independent of the low-level, microscopic laws. In this view, emergent laws are as fundamental as a TOE.\n\nThe debates do not make the point at issue clear. Possibly the only issue at stake is the right to apply the high-status term \"fundamental\" to the respective subjects of research. A well-known debate over this took place between Steven Weinberg and [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Superstrings, P-branes and M-theory|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=7}}</ref>\n\n===Impossibility of being \"of everything\"===\nAlthough the name \"theory of everything\" suggests the determinism of Laplace's quotation, this gives a very misleading impression. Determinism is frustrated by the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanical predictions, by the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions that leads to [[Chaos theory|mathematical chaos]], by the limitations due to event horizons, and by the extreme mathematical difficulty of applying the theory. Thus, although the current standard model of particle physics \"in principle\" predicts almost all known non-gravitational phenomena, in practice only a few quantitative results have been derived from the full theory (e.g., the masses of some of the simplest [[hadron]]s), and these results (especially the particle masses which are most relevant for low-energy physics) are less accurate than existing experimental measurements. The TOE would almost certainly be even harder to apply for the prediction of experimental results, and thus might be of limited use.\n\nA motive for seeking a TOE,{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} apart from the pure intellectual satisfaction of completing a centuries-long quest, is that prior examples of unification have predicted new phenomena, some of which (e.g., [[electrical generator]]s) have proved of great practical importance. And like in these prior examples of unification, the TOE would probably allow us to confidently define the domain of validity and residual error of low-energy approximations to the full theory.\n\nThe theories generally do not account for the apparent phenomena of [[consciousness]] or [[free will]], which are instead often the subject of [[philosophy]] and [[religion]].\n\n===Infinite number of onion layers===\n\n[[Frank Close]] regularly argues that the layers of nature may be like the layers of an onion, and that the number of layers might be infinite.<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Cosmic Onion: Quarks and the Nature of the Universe|first=search|last=results|date=17 December 2006|publisher=CRC Press|isbn = 978-1584887980}}</ref> This would imply an infinite sequence of physical theories.\n\n===Impossibility of calculation===\nWeinberg<ref>Weinberg (1993) p. 5</ref> points out that calculating the precise motion of an actual projectile in the Earth's atmosphere is impossible. So how can we know we have an adequate theory for describing the motion of projectiles? Weinberg suggests that we know ''principles'' (Newton's laws of motion and gravitation) that work \"well enough\" for simple examples, like the motion of planets in empty space. These principles have worked so well on simple examples that we can be reasonably confident they will work for more complex examples. For example, although [[general relativity]] includes equations that do not have exact solutions, it is widely accepted as a valid theory because all of its equations with exact solutions have been experimentally verified.

[[String theory]] and [[M-theory]] have been proposed as theories of everything. Over the past few centuries, two theoretical frameworks have been developed that, together, most closely resemble a TOE. These two theories upon which all modern physics rests are [[general relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]]. General relativity is a theoretical framework that only focuses on [[gravity]] for understanding the universe in regions of both large scale and high mass: stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc. On the other hand, quantum mechanics is a theoretical framework that only focuses on three non-gravitational forces for understanding the universe in regions of both small scale and low mass: sub-atomic particles, atoms, molecules, etc. Quantum mechanics successfully implemented the [[Standard Model]] that describes the three non-gravitational forces -- [[strong force|strong nuclear]], [[weak force|weak nuclear]], and [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] force -- as well as all observed elementary particles.<ref name=\"Hawking2006\">{{cite book |author=Stephen W.

To resolve the incompatibility, a theoretical framework revealing a deeper underlying reality, unifying gravity with the other three interactions, must be discovered to harmoniously integrate the realms of general relativity and quantum mechanics into a seamless whole: the TOE is a single theory that, in principle, is capable of describing all phenomena in the universe. \n\nIn pursuit of this goal, [[quantum gravity]] has become one area of active research. One example is [[string theory]], which evolved into a candidate for the TOE, but not without drawbacks (most notably, its lack of currently testable predictions) and controversy. String theory posits that at the [[Planck epoch|beginning of the universe]] (up to 10<sup>\u221243</sup> seconds after the Big Bang), the four fundamental forces were once a single fundamental force. According to string theory, every particle in the universe, at its most microscopic level ([[Planck length]]), consists of varying combinations of vibrating strings (or strands) with preferred patterns of vibration. String theory further claims that it is through these specific oscillatory patterns of strings that a particle of unique mass and force charge is created (that is to say, the [[electron]] is a type of string that vibrates one way, while the [[up quark]] is a type of string vibrating another way, and so forth).\n\n==Name==\nInitially, the term ''theory of everything'' was used with an ironic reference to various overgeneralized theories.

Newton's work in his ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy]]'' dealt with this in a further example of unification, in this case unifying [[Galileo]]'s work on terrestrial gravity, [[Kepler]]'s laws of planetary motion and the phenomenon of [[tide]]s by explaining these apparent actions at a distance under one single law: the law of [[universal gravitation]].<ref>{{cite book |page=255 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&pg=PA255 |title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy |volume=II |last1=Newton |first1=Sir Isaac |date=1729}}</ref>\n\nIn 1814, building on these results, [[Laplace]] famously suggested that a [[Laplace's demon|sufficiently powerful intellect]] could, if it knew the position and velocity of every particle at a given time, along with the laws of nature, calculate the position of any particle at any other time:<ref name=\"Carroll2010\">{{cite book <!-- Citation bot deny-->|author=Sean Carroll |title=[[From Eternity to Here: The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time]] |year=2010 |publisher=Penguin Group US |isbn=978-1-101-15215-7}}</ref>{{rp |ch 7}}\n\n{{quote|An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.|''Essai philosophique sur les probabilit\u00e9s'', Introduction. 1814}}\n\nLaplace thus envisaged a combination of gravitation and mechanics as a theory of everything. Modern [[quantum mechanics]] implies that [[Heisenberg uncertainty|uncertainty is inescapable]], and thus that Laplace's vision has to be amended: a theory of everything must include gravitation and quantum mechanics. Even ignoring quantum mechanics, [[chaos theory]] is sufficient to guarantee that the future of any sufficiently complex mechanical or astronomical system is unpredictable.\n\nIn 1820, [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] discovered a connection between electricity and magnetism, triggering decades of work that culminated in 1865, in [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s theory of [[electromagnetism]].

This launched his thirty-year voyage in search of the so-called \"unified field theory\" that he hoped would show that these two forces are really manifestations of one grand underlying principle. During these last few decades of his life, this quixotic quest isolated Einstein from the mainstream of physics. Understandably, the mainstream was instead far more excited about the newly emerging framework of quantum mechanics.

More than a half a century later, Einstein's dream of discovering a unified theory has become the Holy Grail of modern physics.\n\n===Late 20th century and the nuclear interactions===\nIn the twentieth century, the search for a unifying theory was interrupted by the discovery of the [[strong force|strong]] and [[weak force|weak]] nuclear forces (or interactions), which differ both from gravity and from electromagnetism. A further hurdle was the acceptance that in a TOE, quantum mechanics had to be incorporated from the start, rather than emerging as a consequence of a deterministic unified theory, as Einstein had hoped.\n\nGravity and electromagnetism could always peacefully coexist as entries in a list of classical forces, but for many years it seemed that gravity could not even be incorporated into the quantum framework, let alone unified with the other fundamental forces. For this reason, work on unification, for much of the twentieth century, focused on understanding the three \"quantum\" forces: electromagnetism and the weak and strong forces. The first two were [[electroweak interaction|combined]] in 1967\u201368 by [[Sheldon Glashow]], [[Steven Weinberg]], and [[Abdus Salam]] into the \"electroweak\" force.<ref>Weinberg (1993), Ch. 5</ref>\nElectroweak unification is a [[broken symmetry]]: the electromagnetic and weak forces appear distinct at low energies because the particles carrying the weak force, the [[W and Z bosons]], have non-zero masses of {{val|80.4|u=GeV/c2}} and {{val|91.2|u=GeV/c2}}, whereas the [[photon]], which carries the electromagnetic force, is massless. At higher energies Ws and Zs can be [[matter creation|created]] easily and the unified nature of the force becomes apparent.\n\nWhile the strong and electroweak forces peacefully coexist in the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, they remain distinct. So far, the quest for a theory of everything is thus unsuccessful on two points: neither a unification of the strong and electroweak forces&nbsp;\u2013 which Laplace would have called 'contact forces'&nbsp;\u2013 nor a unification of these forces with gravitation has been achieved.\n\n==Modern physics==\n\n===Conventional sequence of theories===\nA Theory of Everything would unify all the [[fundamental interaction]]s of nature: [[gravitation]], [[strong interaction]], [[weak interaction]], and [[electromagnetism]]. Because the weak interaction can transform [[elementary particles]] from one kind into another, the TOE should also yield a deep understanding of the various different kinds of possible particles. The usual assumed path of theories is given in the following graph, where each unification step leads one level up:\n\n{{tree chart/start}}\n{{tree chart| | | | |TOE| | TOE=Theory of everything }}\n{{tree chart| | | | | |!| | }}\n{{tree chart| | | | |QG| | QG=[[Quantum gravity]] }}\n{{tree chart| | | | | |!| | }}\n{{tree chart| |REL|-|^|-|GUT| | REL=[[General Relativity|Space Curvature]] | GUT=Electronuclear force ([[Grand Unified Theory|GUT]]) }}\n{{tree chart| | |!| | | | | |!| | }}\n{{tree chart| |SMC| | | |SMP| SMC=[[Lambda-CDM model|Standard model of cosmology]] | SMP=[[Standard model of particle physics]]}}\n{{tree chart| | | | | | | | |!| | }}\n{{tree chart| | | | |QCD|-|^|-|-|EWT| | QCD=[[Strong interaction]]<br />[[Special unitary group|SU(3)]] | EWT=[[Electroweak interaction]]<br />[[Special unitary group|SU(2)]] x [[Unitary group|U(1)]]<sub>[[hypercharge|Y]]</sub> }}\n{{tree chart| | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | }}\n{{tree chart| | | | | | | | |WNF|-|^|-|EMF||WNF=[[Weak interaction]]<br />[[Special unitary group|SU(2)]]|EMF=[[Electromagnetism]]<br />[[Unitary group|U(1)]]<sub>EM</sub>}}\n{{tree chart| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | }}\n{{tree chart| | | | | | | | | | | |EF|-|^|-|MF| |EF=[[Electricity]]|MF=[[Magnetism]] }}\n{{tree chart/end}}\n\nIn this graph, electroweak unification occurs at around 100 GeV, grand unification is predicted to occur at 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, and unification of the GUT force with gravity is expected at the [[Planck energy]], roughly 10<sup>19</sup> GeV.\n\nSeveral [[Grand Unified Theory|Grand Unified Theories]] (GUTs) have been proposed to unify electromagnetism and the weak and strong forces. Grand unification would imply the existence of an electronuclear force; it is expected to set in at energies of the order of 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, far greater than could be reached by any possible Earth-based [[particle accelerator]]. Although the simplest GUTs have been experimentally ruled out, the general idea, especially when linked with [[supersymmetry]], remains a favorite candidate in the theoretical physics community. Supersymmetric GUTs seem plausible not only for their theoretical \"beauty\", but because they naturally produce large quantities of dark matter, and because the inflationary force may be related to GUT physics (although it does not seem to form an inevitable part of the theory). Yet GUTs are clearly not the final answer; both the current standard model and all proposed GUTs are [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] which require the problematic technique of [[renormalization]] to yield sensible answers. This is usually regarded as a sign that these are only [[effective field theory|effective field theories]], omitting crucial phenomena relevant only at very high energies.<ref name=\"Carlip\" />\n\nThe final step in the graph requires resolving the separation between quantum mechanics and gravitation, often equated with [[general relativity]]. Numerous researchers concentrate their efforts on this specific step; nevertheless, no accepted theory of [[quantum gravity]]&nbsp;\u2013 and thus no accepted theory of everything&nbsp;\u2013 has emerged yet. It is usually assumed that the TOE will also solve the remaining problems of GUTs.\n\nIn addition to explaining the forces listed in the graph, a TOE may also explain the status of at least two candidate forces suggested by modern [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]: an [[inflation (cosmology)|inflationary force]] and [[dark energy]]. Furthermore, cosmological experiments also suggest the existence of [[dark matter]], supposedly composed of fundamental particles outside the scheme of the standard model. However, the existence of these forces and particles has not been proven.\n\n===String theory and M-theory===\n\n{{unsolved|physics|Is [[string theory]], [[superstring theory]], or [[M-theory]], or some other variant on this theme, a step on the road to a \"theory of everything\", or just a blind alley?}}\n\nSince the 1990s, some physicists such as [[Edward Witten]] believe that 11-dimensional [[M-theory]], which is described in some limits by one of the five [[perturbation theory|perturbative]] [[superstring theory|superstring theories]], and in another by the maximally-[[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] 11-dimensional [[supergravity]], is the theory of everything. However, there is no widespread consensus on this issue.\n\nA surprising property of [[string theory|string]]/[[M-theory]] is that extra dimensions are required for the theory's consistency. In this regard, string theory can be seen as building on the insights of the [[Kaluza\u2013Klein theory]], in which it was realized that applying general relativity to a five-dimensional universe (with one of them small and curled up){{clarify|date=March 2018}} looks from the four-dimensional perspective like the usual general relativity together with [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's electrodynamics]]. This lent credence to the idea of unifying [[gauge theory|gauge]] and [[gravity]] interactions, and to extra dimensions, but did not address the detailed experimental requirements. Another important property of string theory is its [[supersymmetry]], which together with extra dimensions are the two main proposals for resolving the [[hierarchy problem]] of the [[standard model]], which is (roughly) the question of why gravity is so much weaker than any other force.

On the other hand, the scholars invoking G\u00f6del's Theorem appear, at least in some cases, to be referring not to the underlying rules, but to the understandability of the behavior of all physical systems, as when Hawking mentions arranging blocks into rectangles, turning the computation of [[prime number]]s into a physical question.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Hawking |first=Stephen\n |date=20 July 2002\n |title=G\u00f6del and the end of physics\n |url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/strings02/dirac/hawking/\n |accessdate=2009-12-01\n}}</ref> This definitional discrepancy may explain some of the disagreement among researchers.\n\n===Fundamental limits in accuracy===\n\nNo physical theory to date is believed to be precisely accurate. Instead, physics has proceeded by a series of \"successive approximations\" allowing more and more accurate predictions over a wider and wider range of phenomena. Some physicists believe that it\nis therefore a mistake to confuse theoretical models with the true nature of reality, and\nhold that the series of approximations will never terminate in the \"truth\". Einstein himself\nexpressed this view on occasions.<ref>Einstein, letter to Felix Klein, 1917. (On determinism and approximations.) Quoted in Pais (1982), Ch. 17.</ref> Following this view, we may reasonably hope for ''a'' theory of everything which self-consistently incorporates all currently known forces, but we should not expect it to be the final answer.\n\nOn the other hand, it is often claimed that, despite the apparently ever-increasing complexity of the mathematics of each new theory, in a deep sense associated with their underlying [[gauge symmetry]] and the number of [[dimensionless physical constant]]s, the theories are becoming simpler. If this is the case, the process of simplification cannot continue indefinitely.\n\n===Lack of fundamental laws===\nThere is a philosophical debate within the physics community as to whether a theory of everything deserves to be called ''the'' fundamental law of the universe.<ref>Weinberg (1993), Ch 2.</ref> One view is the hard [[reductionist]] position that the TOE is the fundamental law and that all other theories that apply within the universe are a consequence of the TOE. Another view is that [[emergence|emergent]] laws, which govern the behavior of [[complex system]]s, should be seen as equally fundamental. Examples of emergent laws are the [[second law of thermodynamics]] and the theory of [[natural selection]]. The advocates of emergence argue that emergent laws, especially those describing complex or living systems are independent of the low-level, microscopic laws. In this view, emergent laws are as fundamental as a TOE.\n\nThe debates do not make the point at issue clear. Possibly the only issue at stake is the right to apply the high-status term \"fundamental\" to the respective subjects of research. A well-known debate over this took place between Steven Weinberg and [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Superstrings, P-branes and M-theory|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=7}}</ref>\n\n===Impossibility of being \"of everything\"===\nAlthough the name \"theory of everything\" suggests the determinism of Laplace's quotation, this gives a very misleading impression. Determinism is frustrated by the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanical predictions, by the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions that leads to [[Chaos theory|mathematical chaos]], by the limitations due to event horizons, and by the extreme mathematical difficulty of applying the theory. Thus, although the current standard model of particle physics \"in principle\" predicts almost all known non-gravitational phenomena, in practice only a few quantitative results have been derived from the full theory (e.g., the masses of some of the simplest [[hadron]]s), and these results (especially the particle masses which are most relevant for low-energy physics) are less accurate than existing experimental measurements. The TOE would almost certainly be even harder to apply for the prediction of experimental results, and thus might be of limited use.\n\nA motive for seeking a TOE,{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} apart from the pure intellectual satisfaction of completing a centuries-long quest, is that prior examples of unification have predicted new phenomena, some of which (e.g., [[electrical generator]]s) have proved of great practical importance. And like in these prior examples of unification, the TOE would probably allow us to confidently define the domain of validity and residual error of low-energy approximations to the full theory.\n\nThe theories generally do not account for the apparent phenomena of [[consciousness]] or [[free will]], which are instead often the subject of [[philosophy]] and [[religion]].\n\n===Infinite number of onion layers===\n\n[[Frank Close]] regularly argues that the layers of nature may be like the layers of an onion, and that the number of layers might be infinite.<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Cosmic Onion: Quarks and the Nature of the Universe|first=search|last=results|date=17 December 2006|publisher=CRC Press|isbn = 978-1584887980}}</ref> This would imply an infinite sequence of physical theories.\n\n===Impossibility of calculation===\nWeinberg<ref>Weinberg (1993) p. 5</ref> points out that calculating the precise motion of an actual projectile in the Earth's atmosphere is impossible. So how can we know we have an adequate theory for describing the motion of projectiles? Weinberg suggests that we know ''principles'' (Newton's laws of motion and gravitation) that work \"well enough\" for simple examples, like the motion of planets in empty space. These principles have worked so well on simple examples that we can be reasonably confident they will work for more complex examples. For example, although [[general relativity]] includes equations that do not have exact solutions, it is widely accepted as a valid theory because all of its equations with exact solutions have been experimentally verified. Likewise, a TOE must work for a wide range of simple examples in such a way that we can be reasonably confident it will work for every situation in physics.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Physics}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Absolute (philosophy)]]\n* ''[[A New Kind of Science]]''\n* [[Argument from beauty]]\n* [[Attractor]]\n* [[Black hole thermodynamics#Beyond black holes|Beyond black holes]]\n* [[Beyond the standard model]]\n* [[Big Bang]]\n* [[Bit-string physics]]\n* [[cGh physics]]\n* [[Chronology of the universe]]\n* [[Electroweak interaction]]\n* [[ER=EPR]]\n* [[Holographic principle]]\n* [[Mathematical beauty]]\n* [[Mathematical universe hypothesis]]\n* [[Multiverse]]\n* [[Penrose interpretation]]\n* [[Scale relativity]]\n* [[Standard Model (mathematical formulation)]]\n* [[Superfluid vacuum theory]] (SVT)\n* ''[[The Theory of Everything (2014 film)]]''\n* [[Timeline of the Big Bang]]\n* [[Unified field theory|Unified Field Theory]]\n* [[Zero-energy universe]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* [[Abraham Pais|Pais, Abraham]] (1982) ''Subtle is the Lord...: The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, .

innovate responses including diagnostics, drugs and vaccines; use the evidence to inform the development of the most effective models of care\n*Mitigate: provide the best care possible for people who become ill, support hospitals to maintain essential services and ensure ongoing support for people ill in the community, to minimise the overall impact of the disease on society, public services and on the economy.<ref name=\"Plan2020\">Department of Health and Social Care, Emergency and Health Protection Directorate, [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/869827/Coronavirus_action_plan_-_a_guide_to_what_you_can_expect_across_the_UK.pdf Coronavirus: action plan: A guide to what you can expect across the UK] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304131952/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/869827/Coronavirus_action_plan_-_a_guide_to_what_you_can_expect_across_the_UK.pdf|date=4 March 2020}}, published 3 March, accessed 7 March 2020</ref>\n\nThe four UK CMOs raised the UK risk level from low to moderate on 30 January 2020, upon the WHO's announcement of the disease as a [[Public Health Emergency of International Concern]].<ref name=\"gov.uk2Update\" /><ref name=\"Russell13Feb2020\" /> As soon as cases appeared in the UK on 31 January 2020, a public health information campaign, similar to the previous \"[[Catch it, Bin it, Kill it]]\" campaign, was launched in the UK, to advise people how to lessen the risk of spreading the virus.<ref name=\"Russell13Feb2020\" /> Travellers from Hubei province in China, including the capital Wuhan were advised to self-isolate, \"stay at home, not go to work, school or public places, not use public transport or taxis, ask friends, family members or delivery services to do errands\",<ref name=\"NHS.ukCOVID\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/|title=Coronavirus (COVID-19)|last=|first=|date=24 January 2020|website=nhs.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302222456/https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/|archive-date=2 March 2020|access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref> and call [[NHS 111]] if they had arrived in the UK in previous 14 days, regardless of whether they were unwell or not.<ref name=\"Russell13Feb2020\" /> Further cases in early February prompted the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, to announce the [[Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020]].<ref name=\"gov.uk2Update\" /> Daily updates have been published by the DHSC.<ref name=\"gov.uk2Update\" /> [[NHS Digital]] in the meanwhile, have been collecting data.<ref name=\"RapsonHSJ\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/patient-safety/nhs-collecting-coronavirus-data-from-111-calls/7026999.article|title=NHS collecting coronavirus data from 111 calls|last=Rapson|first=Jasmine|date=|website=Health Service Journal|url-access=subscription|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref>\n[[File:Catch it, Bin it, Kill it poster.jpg|thumb|upright|Poster for the \"Catch it, Bin it, Kill it\" slogan which has been revived in the fight against coronavirus]]\nOn 25 February 2020, the UK's CMOs advice for all travellers (unwell or not) who had returned to the UK from Hubei province in the previous 14 days, Iran, specific areas designated by the Italian government as quarantine areas in northern Italy and special care zones in South Korea since 19 February, to self-isolate and call NHS 111.<ref name=\"gov.uk15Feb2020\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-staff-in-the-transport-sector/covid-19-guidance-for-staff-in-the-transport-sector|title=COVID-19: guidance for staff in the transport sector|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220133756/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-staff-in-the-transport-sector/covid-19-guidance-for-staff-in-the-transport-sector|archive-date=20 February 2020|access-date=15 February 2020}}</ref> This advice was also advocated for any person who has flu-like symptoms with a history of travelling from Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and areas in Italy north of Pisa, Florence and Rimini, returning to the UK since 19 February.

Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that

Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that

The shallow stations comprise 79 [[Shallow column station|spanned column]] stations (a large portion of them following the \"centipede\" design), 33 [[Shallow single-vault station|single-vaulted stations]] (Kharkov technology), and three single-spanned stations. In addition, there are 12 ground-level stations, four elevated stations, and one station ([[Vorobyovy Gory (Moscow Metro)|Vorobyovy Gory]]) on a bridge. Two stations have three tracks, and one has double halls. Seven of the stations have side platforms (only one of which is subterranean). In addition, there were two temporary stations within rail yards. One station is reserved for future service ([[Delovoy Tsentr (Kalininsko\u2013Solntsevskaya line)|Delovoy Tsentr]] for the [[Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya line]]).\n\nThe stations being constructed under [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] [[Stalinism|regime]], in the style of [[socialist classicism]], were meant as underground \"palaces of the people\".

In 1923, the Moscow City Council formed the Underground Railway Design Office at the Moscow Board of Urban Railways. It carried out preliminary studies, and by 1928 had developed a project for the first route from Sokolniki to the city centre. At the same time, an offer was made to the German company Siemens Bauunion to submit its own project for the same route. In June 1931, the decision to begin construction of the Moscow Metro was made by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].

In March 1938, the Arbatskaya branch was split and extended to the [[Kurskaya-Radialnaya|Kurskaya]] station (now the dark-blue [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]]). In September 1938, the [[Zamoskvoretskaya Line|Gorkovskaya Line]] opened between [[Sokol (Metro)|Sokol]] and [[Teatralnaya (Moscow Metro)|Teatralnaya]]. Here the architecture was based on that of the most popular stations in existence (Krasniye Vorota, Okhotnyi Ryad and Kropotkinskaya); while following the popular art-deco style, it was merged with socialist themes. The first [[Deep column station|deep-level column station]] [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya]] was built at the same time.\n\nBuilding work on the third stage was delayed (but not interrupted) during [[World War II]], and two Metro sections were put into service; [[Teatralnaya (Moscow Metro)|Teatralnaya]]\u2013[[Avtozavodskaya (Zamoskvoretskaya Line)|Avtozavodskaya]] (three stations, crossing the Moskva River through a deep tunnel) and [[Kurskaya-Radialnaya|Kurskaya]]\u2013[[Partizanskaya (Metro)|Partizanskaya]] (four stations) were inaugurated in 1943 and 1944 respectively. War motifs replaced socialist visions in the architectural design of these stations. During the [[Battle of Moscow|Siege of Moscow]] in the fall and winter of 1941, Metro stations were used as air-raid shelters; the [[Council of Ministers of the USSR|Council of Ministers]] moved its offices to the [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya]] platforms, where Stalin made public speeches on several occasions. The [[Chistye Prudy (Metro)|Chistiye Prudy]] station was also walled off, and the headquarters of the Air Defence established there.\n\nAfter the war ended in 1945, construction began on the fourth stage of the Metro, which included the [[Koltsevaya Line]], a deep part of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line from [[Ploshchad Revolyutsii]] to [[Kievskaya (Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya)|Kievskaya]] and a surface extension to [[Pervomaiskaya (closed)|Pervomaiskaya]] during the early 1950s. The decoration and design characteristic of the Moscow Metro is considered to have reached its zenith in these stations. The [[Koltsevaya Line]] was first planned as a line running under the [[Garden Ring]], a wide avenue encircling the borders of Moscow's city centre. The first part of the line \u2013 from [[Park Kultury (Koltsevaya Line)|Park Kultury]] to [[Kurskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Kurskaya]] (1950) \u2013 follows this avenue. Plans were later changed and the northern part of the ring line runs {{convert|1|-|1.5|km}} outside the Sadovoye Koltso, thus providing service for seven (out of nine) rail terminals. The next part of the Koltsevaya Line opened in 1952 (Kurskaya\u2013[[Belorusskaya-Koltsevaya|Belorusskaya]]), and in 1954 the ring line was completed.\n\n===Cold War era===\n[[File:Novoslobodskaya 04.jpg|thumb|left|Novoslobodskaya station]]\n[[File:MosMetro KomsomolskayaKL img2 asv2018-01.jpg|thumb| [[Komsomolskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Komsomolskaya station]]]]\n[[File:Metro MSK Line2 Sokol.jpg|thumb|[[Sokol (Metro)|Sokol station]]]]\nThe beginning of the [[Cold War]] led to the construction of a deep section of the [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]]. The stations on this line were planned as shelters in the event of nuclear war. After finishing the line in 1953 the upper tracks between [[Ploshchad Revolyutsii]] and [[Kiyevskaya (Filyovskaya)|Kiyevskaya]] were closed, and later reopened in 1958 as a part of the [[Filyovskaya Line]]. In the further development of the Metro the term \"stages\" was not used any more, although sometimes the stations opened in 1957\u20131959 are referred to as the \"fifth stage\".\n\nOther stations, too, were supplied with tight gates and life-sustenance systems to function as nuclear shelters.\n\nDuring the late 1950s the architectural extravagance of new Metro stations was toned down, and decorations at some stations (such as [[VDNKh (Metro)|VDNKh]] and [[Alexeyevskaya (Metro)|Alexeyevskaya]]) were simplified by comparison with the original plans. This was done on the orders of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who favoured more spartan decoration. A typical layout (which quickly became known as ''Sorokonozhka''\u2013\"centipede\", from early designs with 40 concrete columns in two rows) was developed for all new stations and the stations were built to look almost identical, differing from each other only in colours of the marble and ceramic tiles. Most stations were built with simpler, less-costly technology; this was not always appropriate, and resulted in utilitarian design. For example, walls with cheap ceramic tiles were susceptible to train vibration and some tiles eventually fell off. It was not always possible to replace the missing tiles with the ones of the same color, which eventually led to [[:wikt:variegated|variegated]] parts of the walls. Not until the mid-1970s was the architectural extravagance restored and original designs again popular. However, the newer design of \"centipede\" stations (with 26 columns, more widely spaced) continued to dominate.\n\n===Stalinist ideals===\n{{see also|Stalinist architecture}}\n\n====Publicizing the metro====\nThe Moscow Metro was one of the USSR's most ambitious architectural projects. The metro's artists and architects worked to design a structure that embodied ''svet'' (radiance or brilliance) and ''svetloe budushchee'' (a radiant future).<ref name=\"Cooke 1997 137\u2013160\">{{cite journal |last=Cooke |first=Catherine |title=Beauty as a Route to 'the Radiant Future': Responses of Soviet Architecture |journal=Journal of Design History |year=1997 |volume=10 |series=Design, Stalin and the Thaw |issue=2 |pages=137\u2013160 |jstor=1316129 |doi=10.1093/jdh/10.2.137}}</ref> With their reflective marble walls, high ceilings and grand chandeliers, many Moscow Metro stations have been likened to an \"artificial underground sun\".<ref name=\"Bowlt 2002 34\u201363\">{{cite journal |last=Bowlt |first=John E. |title=Stalin as Isis and Ra: Socialist Realism and the Art of Design |journal=The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts |year=2002 |volume=24 |series=Design, Culture, Identity: The Wolfsonian Collection |pages=34\u201363 |jstor=1504182 |doi=10.2307/1504182}}</ref> This palatial underground environment<ref name=\"Bowlt 2002 34\u201363\"/> reminded riders that their tax rubles had been well spent on ''svetloe budushchee''.\n\nThe chief lighting engineer was Abram Damsky, a graduate of the Higher State Art-Technical Institute in Moscow. By 1930 he was a chief designer in Moscow's Elektrosvet Factory, and during World War II was sent to the ''Metrostroi'' (Metro Construction) Factory as head of the lighting shop.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\">{{cite journal |last=Damsky |first=Abram |title=Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950 |journal=The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts |date=Summer 1987 |volume=5 |issue=Russian/Soviet Theme |pages=90\u2013111 |jstor=1503938 |doi=10.2307/1503938}}</ref> Damsky recognized the importance of efficiency, as well as the potential for light as an expressive form.

Poliakov's decision to base his design on a reinterpretation of Russian classical architecture clearly influenced the concept of the lamps, some of which I planned in collaboration with the architect himself. The shape of the lamps was a torch \u2013 the torch of victory, as Poliakov put it... The artistic quality and stylistic unity of all the lamps throughout the station's interior made them perhaps the most successful element of the architectural composition. All were made of cast aluminum decorated in a black and gold anodized coating, a technique which the Metrostroi factory had only just mastered.\n<br /> \nThe Taganskaia Metro Station on the Ring Line was designed in...quite another style by the architects K.S. Ryzhkov and A. Medvedev... Their subject matter dealt with images of war and victory...The overall effect was one of ceremony ... In the platform halls the blue ceramic bodies of the chandeliers played a more modest role, but still emphasised the overall expressiveness of the lamp.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\"/>|Abram Damsky|Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950}}\n\nThe work of Abram Damsky further publicized these ideas hoping people would associate the party with ''svetloe budushchee''.\n\n====Industrialization====\nStalin's [[first five-year plan]] (1928\u20131932) facilitated rapid industrialization to build a socialist motherland. The plan was ambitious, seeking to reorient an agrarian society towards industrialism. It was Stalin's fanatical energy, large-scale planning, and smart resource distribution that kept up the incredible pace of industrialization. The first five-year plan was instrumental in the completion of the Moscow Metro; without industrialization, the Soviet Union would not have had the raw materials necessary for the project. For example, steel was a main component of many subway stations. Before industrialization, it would have been impossible for the Soviet Union to produce enough [[steel]] to incorporate it into the metro's design; in addition, a steel shortage would have limited the size of the subway system and its technological advancement.\n\nThe Moscow Metro furthered the construction of a socialist Soviet Union because the project accorded with Stalin's [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union#Second Plan, 1933\u20131937|second five-year plan]]. The Second Plan focused on urbanization and the development of social services. The Moscow Metro was necessary to cope with the influx of peasants who migrated to the city during the 1930s; Moscow's population had grown from 2.16 million in 1928 to 3.6 million in 1933.  The Metro also bolstered Moscow's shaky infrastructure and its communal services, which hitherto were nearly nonexistent.<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\">{{cite journal |last=Jenks |first=Andrew |title=A Metro on the Mount: The Underground as a Church of Soviet Civilization |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 2000 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=697\u2013724 |jstor=2517594 |doi=10.1353/tech.2000.0160}}</ref>\n\n====Mobilization====\nThe [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] had the power to mobilize; because the party was a single source of control, it could focus its resources and inspire its people. The most notable example of mobilization in the Soviet Union occurred during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]]. The country also mobilized in order to complete the Moscow Metro with unprecedented speed. One of the main motivation factors of the mobilization was to overtake the West and prove that a socialist metro could surpass capitalist designs. It was especially important to the Soviet Union that socialism succeed industrially, technologically, and artistically in the 1930s, since capitalism was at a low ebb during the Great Depression.\n\nThe person in charge of Metro mobilization was [[Lazar Kaganovich]]. A prominent Party member, he assumed control of the project as chief overseer. Kaganovich was nicknamed the \"Iron Commissar\"; he shared Stalin's fanatical energy, dramatic oratory flare, and ability to keep workers building quickly with threats and punishment.<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\"/> He was determined to realise the Moscow Metro, regardless of cost. Without Kaganovich's managerial ability, the Moscow Metro might have met the same fate as the [[Palace of the soviets|Palace of the Soviets]]: failure.\n\nThis was a comprehensive mobilization; the project drew resources and workers from the entire Soviet Union. In his article, archeologist Mike O'Mahoney describes the scope of the Metro mobilization:\n\n{{quote|A specialist workforce had been drawn from many different regions, including miners from the Ukrainian and Siberian coalfields and construction workers from the iron and steel mills of Magnitogorsk, the Dniepr hydroelectric power station, and the Turkestan-Siberian railway... materials used in the construction of the metro included iron from Siberian Kuznetsk, timber from northern Russia, cement from the Volga region and the norther Caucasus, bitumen from Baku, and marble and granite from quarries in Karelia, the Crimea, the Caucasus, the Urals, and the Soviet Far East<ref>{{cite journal |last=O'Mahoney |first=Mike |title=Archaeological Fantasies: Constructing History on the Moscow Metro |journal=The Modern Language Review |date=January 2003 |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=138\u2013150 |jstor=3738180 |doi=10.2307/3738180}}</ref>|Mike O'Mahoney|Archeological Fantasies: Constructing History on the Moscow Metro}}\n\nSkilled engineers were scarce, and unskilled workers were instrumental to the realization of the metro. The ''Metrostroi'' (the organization responsible for the Metro's construction) conducted massive recruitment campaigns. It printed 15,000 copies of ''Udarnik metrostroia'' (''Metrostroi Shock Worker'', its daily newspaper) and 700 other newsletters (some in different languages) to attract unskilled laborers. Kaganovich was closely involved in the recruitment campaign, targeting the [[Komsomol]] generation because of its strength and youth.\n\n====Patriotic influences====\nWhen the Metro opened in 1935 it immediately became the centrepiece of the transportation system. More than that, it was a Stalinist device to awe and control the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. Kaganovich was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilization as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and physical prowess on the powerful new \"[[Homo Sovieticus]]\" (Soviet man).<ref>Isabel W\u00fcnsche, \"Homo Sovieticus: The Athletic Motif in the Design of the Dynamo Metro Station,\" ''Studies in the Decorative Arts'' (2000) 7#2 pp 65-90</ref> The metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order\u2014a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.<ref>Andrew Jenks, \"A Metro on the Mount,\" ''Technology & Culture'' (2000) 41#4 pp 697-723p</ref>\n\nThe Metro was iconic also because it showcased [[Socialist realism|Socialist Realism]] in public art. Socialist Realism was in fact a method, not a style.<ref name=\"Cooke 1997 137\u2013160\"/> This method was influenced by [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] favorite 19th-century [[Nihilist movement|nihilist]], who stated that \"art is no use unless it serves politics\".<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\"/> This maxim explains why the stations combined aesthetics, technology and ideology. Any plan which did not incorporate all three areas cohesively was rejected. Without this cohesion, the Metro would not reflect Socialist Realism. If the Metro did not utilize Socialist Realism, it would fail to illustrate Stalinist values and transform Soviet citizens into socialists. Anything less than Socialist Realism's grand artistic complexity would fail to inspire a long-lasting, nationalistic attachment to Stalin's new society.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Voyce |first=Arthur |title=Soviet Art and Architecture: Recent Developments |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |date=January 1956 |volume=303 |series=Russia Since Stalin: Old Trends and New Problems |pages=104\u2013115 |jstor=1032295 |doi=10.1177/000271625630300110}}</ref>\n\n===Moscow Central Circle urban railway (Line 14)===\n{{main|Moscow Central Circle}}\n[[File:MCC 12LUZH 7041 PLAT.jpg|thumb|alt=Large, light outdoor station|[[Luzhniki (Moscow Central Circle)|Luzhniki]] MCC station]]\nA proposal to convert the [[Little Ring of the Moscow Railway]] into a [[Urban rail transit|metropolitan railway]] with frequent passenger service was announced in 2012.

The fare has been steadily rising since 1991, hastened by [[inflation]] (taking into account the [[Monetary reform in Russia, 1998|1998 revaluation]] of the [[Russian ruble|ruble]] by a factor of 1,000). Effective February 2017, one ride costs 55 rubles (approx. 1 US dollar). Discounts (up to 33 percent) are available when buying a multiple-trip ticket (starting with twenty-trip cards), and children under age seven can travel free with their parents.\n\nTickets are available for a fixed number of trips, regardless of distance traveled or number of transfers. Monthly and yearly passes are also available. Fare enforcement takes place at the points of entry. Once a passenger has entered the Metro system, there are no further ticket checks \u2013 one can ride to any number of stations and make transfers within the system freely. Transfers to other public-transport systems (such as bus, tram, trolleybus) are not covered by the ticket. Transfer to monorail is free within 90 minutes.\n\nBefore 1991, turnstiles accepted coins; however, with the start of [[hyperinflation]] plastic tokens of various design were used. Disposable [[magnetic stripe card]]s were introduced in 1993 on a trial basis, and used as unlimited monthly tickets between 1996 and 1998. The sale of tokens ended on 1 January 1999, and they stopped being accepted in February 1999; from that time, magnetic cards were used as tickets with a fixed number of trips.\n\nOn 1 September 1998, the Moscow Metro became the first metro system in Europe to fully implement contactless [[smart cards]], known as Transport Cards. The card has an unlimited number of trips and may be programmed for 30, 90 or 365 days. The first purchase includes a one-time cost of 50 rubles, and its active lifetime is projected as 3\u00bd years; defective cards are exchanged at no cost. Unlimited cards are also available for students at reduced price (as of 2017, 365 rubles\u2014or about $US6\u2014for a calendar month of unlimited usage) for a one-time cost of 70 rubles. Transport Cards impose a delay for each consecutive use; i.e. the card can not be used for seven minutes after the user has passed through the turnstile.\n\nIn January 2007, Moscow Metro began replacing magnetic cards with [[Smart card#Contactless smart cards|contactless]] disposable tickets based on [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP's]] [[MIFARE|MIFARE Ultralight]] technology. Ultralight tickets are available for a fixed number of trips in 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 60-trip denominations (valid for 5 or 90 days from the day of purchase) and as a monthly ticket, only valid for a selected calendar month and limited to 70 trips. The sale of magnetic cards stopped 16 January 2008 and magnetic cards stopped being accepted in late 2008, making the Moscow metro the world's first major public-transport system to run exclusively on a contactless automatic fare-collection system.<ref name=mifareinmoscow>{{cite web |url=http://www.nxp.com/news/content/file_1518.html |title=Moscow Metro: the World's First Major Transport System to operate fully contactless with NXP's MIFARE Technology |publisher=[[NXP Semiconductors]] |accessdate=26 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2004, the [[Government of Moscow|city government]] launched the Muscovite's Social Card program. Social Cards are free smart cards issued for the elderly and other groups of citizens officially registered as residents of Moscow or the [[Moscow region]]; they offer discounts in shops and pharmacies, and double as credit cards issued by the [[Bank of Moscow]]. Social Cards can be used for unlimited free access to the city's public-transport system, including the Moscow Metro; while they do not feature the time delay, they include a photograph and are non-transferable.\n\nSince 2006, [[Banking in Russia|several banks]] have issued [[credit card]]s which double as Ultralight cards and are accepted at turnstiles. The fare is passed to the bank and the payment is withdrawn from the owner's bank account at the end of the calendar month, using a discount rate based on the number of trips that month (for up to 70 trips, the cost of each trip is prorated from current Ultralight rates; each additional trip costs 24.14 rubles).<ref name=rates_2010/> Partner banks include the [[Bank of Moscow]], [[CitiBank]], [[Rosbank]], [[Alfa-Bank]] and [[Avangard Bank]].<ref name=creditcards>{{cite web |url=http://old.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=779 |title=\u0411\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430 |publisher=Moscow metro |accessdate=20 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727014525/http://old.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=779 |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 2 April 2013 Moscow Transport Department introduced a smart card based transport electronic wallet called ''Troika''.

In 1923, the Moscow City Council formed the Underground Railway Design Office at the Moscow Board of Urban Railways. It carried out preliminary studies, and by 1928 had developed a project for the first route from Sokolniki to the city centre. At the same time, an offer was made to the German company Siemens Bauunion to submit its own project for the same route. In June 1931, the decision to begin construction of the Moscow Metro was made by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. In January 1932 the plan for the first lines was approved, and on 21 March 1933 the Soviet government approved a plan for 10 lines with a total route length of {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe first lines were built using the Moscow general plan designed by [[Lazar Kaganovich]], along with his project managers (notably Ivan M.

In March 1938, the Arbatskaya branch was split and extended to the [[Kurskaya-Radialnaya|Kurskaya]] station (now the dark-blue [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]]). In September 1938, the [[Zamoskvoretskaya Line|Gorkovskaya Line]] opened between [[Sokol (Metro)|Sokol]] and [[Teatralnaya (Moscow Metro)|Teatralnaya]]. Here the architecture was based on that of the most popular stations in existence (Krasniye Vorota, Okhotnyi Ryad and Kropotkinskaya); while following the popular art-deco style, it was merged with socialist themes. The first [[Deep column station|deep-level column station]] [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya]] was built at the same time.\n\nBuilding work on the third stage was delayed (but not interrupted) during [[World War II]], and two Metro sections were put into service; [[Teatralnaya (Moscow Metro)|Teatralnaya]]\u2013[[Avtozavodskaya (Zamoskvoretskaya Line)|Avtozavodskaya]] (three stations, crossing the Moskva River through a deep tunnel) and [[Kurskaya-Radialnaya|Kurskaya]]\u2013[[Partizanskaya (Metro)|Partizanskaya]] (four stations) were inaugurated in 1943 and 1944 respectively. War motifs replaced socialist visions in the architectural design of these stations. During the [[Battle of Moscow|Siege of Moscow]] in the fall and winter of 1941, Metro stations were used as air-raid shelters; the [[Council of Ministers of the USSR|Council of Ministers]] moved its offices to the [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya]] platforms, where Stalin made public speeches on several occasions. The [[Chistye Prudy (Metro)|Chistiye Prudy]] station was also walled off, and the headquarters of the Air Defence established there.\n\nAfter the war ended in 1945, construction began on the fourth stage of the Metro, which included the [[Koltsevaya Line]], a deep part of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line from [[Ploshchad Revolyutsii]] to [[Kievskaya (Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya)|Kievskaya]] and a surface extension to [[Pervomaiskaya (closed)|Pervomaiskaya]] during the early 1950s. The decoration and design characteristic of the Moscow Metro is considered to have reached its zenith in these stations. The [[Koltsevaya Line]] was first planned as a line running under the [[Garden Ring]], a wide avenue encircling the borders of Moscow's city centre. The first part of the line \u2013 from [[Park Kultury (Koltsevaya Line)|Park Kultury]] to [[Kurskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Kurskaya]] (1950) \u2013 follows this avenue. Plans were later changed and the northern part of the ring line runs {{convert|1|-|1.5|km}} outside the Sadovoye Koltso, thus providing service for seven (out of nine) rail terminals. The next part of the Koltsevaya Line opened in 1952 (Kurskaya\u2013[[Belorusskaya-Koltsevaya|Belorusskaya]]), and in 1954 the ring line was completed.\n\n===Cold War era===\n[[File:Novoslobodskaya 04.jpg|thumb|left|Novoslobodskaya station]]\n[[File:MosMetro KomsomolskayaKL img2 asv2018-01.jpg|thumb| [[Komsomolskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Komsomolskaya station]]]]\n[[File:Metro MSK Line2 Sokol.jpg|thumb|[[Sokol (Metro)|Sokol station]]]]\nThe beginning of the [[Cold War]] led to the construction of a deep section of the [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]]. The stations on this line were planned as shelters in the event of nuclear war. After finishing the line in 1953 the upper tracks between [[Ploshchad Revolyutsii]] and [[Kiyevskaya (Filyovskaya)|Kiyevskaya]] were closed, and later reopened in 1958 as a part of the [[Filyovskaya Line]]. In the further development of the Metro the term \"stages\" was not used any more, although sometimes the stations opened in 1957\u20131959 are referred to as the \"fifth stage\".\n\nOther stations, too, were supplied with tight gates and life-sustenance systems to function as nuclear shelters.\n\nDuring the late 1950s the architectural extravagance of new Metro stations was toned down, and decorations at some stations (such as [[VDNKh (Metro)|VDNKh]] and [[Alexeyevskaya (Metro)|Alexeyevskaya]]) were simplified by comparison with the original plans. This was done on the orders of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who favoured more spartan decoration. A typical layout (which quickly became known as ''Sorokonozhka''\u2013\"centipede\", from early designs with 40 concrete columns in two rows) was developed for all new stations and the stations were built to look almost identical, differing from each other only in colours of the marble and ceramic tiles. Most stations were built with simpler, less-costly technology; this was not always appropriate, and resulted in utilitarian design. For example, walls with cheap ceramic tiles were susceptible to train vibration and some tiles eventually fell off. It was not always possible to replace the missing tiles with the ones of the same color, which eventually led to [[:wikt:variegated|variegated]] parts of the walls. Not until the mid-1970s was the architectural extravagance restored and original designs again popular. However, the newer design of \"centipede\" stations (with 26 columns, more widely spaced) continued to dominate.\n\n===Stalinist ideals===\n{{see also|Stalinist architecture}}\n\n====Publicizing the metro====\nThe Moscow Metro was one of the USSR's most ambitious architectural projects. The metro's artists and architects worked to design a structure that embodied ''svet'' (radiance or brilliance) and ''svetloe budushchee'' (a radiant future).<ref name=\"Cooke 1997 137\u2013160\">{{cite journal |last=Cooke |first=Catherine |title=Beauty as a Route to 'the Radiant Future': Responses of Soviet Architecture |journal=Journal of Design History |year=1997 |volume=10 |series=Design, Stalin and the Thaw |issue=2 |pages=137\u2013160 |jstor=1316129 |doi=10.1093/jdh/10.2.137}}</ref> With their reflective marble walls, high ceilings and grand chandeliers, many Moscow Metro stations have been likened to an \"artificial underground sun\".<ref name=\"Bowlt 2002 34\u201363\">{{cite journal |last=Bowlt |first=John E. |title=Stalin as Isis and Ra: Socialist Realism and the Art of Design |journal=The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts |year=2002 |volume=24 |series=Design, Culture, Identity: The Wolfsonian Collection |pages=34\u201363 |jstor=1504182 |doi=10.2307/1504182}}</ref> This palatial underground environment<ref name=\"Bowlt 2002 34\u201363\"/> reminded riders that their tax rubles had been well spent on ''svetloe budushchee''.\n\nThe chief lighting engineer was Abram Damsky, a graduate of the Higher State Art-Technical Institute in Moscow. By 1930 he was a chief designer in Moscow's Elektrosvet Factory, and during World War II was sent to the ''Metrostroi'' (Metro Construction) Factory as head of the lighting shop.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\">{{cite journal |last=Damsky |first=Abram |title=Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950 |journal=The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts |date=Summer 1987 |volume=5 |issue=Russian/Soviet Theme |pages=90\u2013111 |jstor=1503938 |doi=10.2307/1503938}}</ref> Damsky recognized the importance of efficiency, as well as the potential for light as an expressive form.

Poliakov's decision to base his design on a reinterpretation of Russian classical architecture clearly influenced the concept of the lamps, some of which I planned in collaboration with the architect himself. The shape of the lamps was a torch \u2013 the torch of victory, as Poliakov put it... The artistic quality and stylistic unity of all the lamps throughout the station's interior made them perhaps the most successful element of the architectural composition. All were made of cast aluminum decorated in a black and gold anodized coating, a technique which the Metrostroi factory had only just mastered.\n<br /> \nThe Taganskaia Metro Station on the Ring Line was designed in...quite another style by the architects K.S. Ryzhkov and A. Medvedev... Their subject matter dealt with images of war and victory...The overall effect was one of ceremony ... In the platform halls the blue ceramic bodies of the chandeliers played a more modest role, but still emphasised the overall expressiveness of the lamp.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\"/>|Abram Damsky|Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950}}\n\nThe work of Abram Damsky further publicized these ideas hoping people would associate the party with ''svetloe budushchee''.\n\n====Industrialization====\nStalin's [[first five-year plan]] (1928\u20131932) facilitated rapid industrialization to build a socialist motherland. The plan was ambitious, seeking to reorient an agrarian society towards industrialism. It was Stalin's fanatical energy, large-scale planning, and smart resource distribution that kept up the incredible pace of industrialization. The first five-year plan was instrumental in the completion of the Moscow Metro; without industrialization, the Soviet Union would not have had the raw materials necessary for the project. For example, steel was a main component of many subway stations. Before industrialization, it would have been impossible for the Soviet Union to produce enough [[steel]] to incorporate it into the metro's design; in addition, a steel shortage would have limited the size of the subway system and its technological advancement.\n\nThe Moscow Metro furthered the construction of a socialist Soviet Union because the project accorded with Stalin's [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union#Second Plan, 1933\u20131937|second five-year plan]]. The Second Plan focused on urbanization and the development of social services. The Moscow Metro was necessary to cope with the influx of peasants who migrated to the city during the 1930s; Moscow's population had grown from 2.16 million in 1928 to 3.6 million in 1933.  The Metro also bolstered Moscow's shaky infrastructure and its communal services, which hitherto were nearly nonexistent.<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\">{{cite journal |last=Jenks |first=Andrew |title=A Metro on the Mount: The Underground as a Church of Soviet Civilization |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 2000 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=697\u2013724 |jstor=2517594 |doi=10.1353/tech.2000.0160}}</ref>\n\n====Mobilization====\nThe [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] had the power to mobilize; because the party was a single source of control, it could focus its resources and inspire its people. The most notable example of mobilization in the Soviet Union occurred during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]]. The country also mobilized in order to complete the Moscow Metro with unprecedented speed. One of the main motivation factors of the mobilization was to overtake the West and prove that a socialist metro could surpass capitalist designs. It was especially important to the Soviet Union that socialism succeed industrially, technologically, and artistically in the 1930s, since capitalism was at a low ebb during the Great Depression.\n\nThe person in charge of Metro mobilization was [[Lazar Kaganovich]]. A prominent Party member, he assumed control of the project as chief overseer. Kaganovich was nicknamed the \"Iron Commissar\"; he shared Stalin's fanatical energy, dramatic oratory flare, and ability to keep workers building quickly with threats and punishment.<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\"/> He was determined to realise the Moscow Metro, regardless of cost. Without Kaganovich's managerial ability, the Moscow Metro might have met the same fate as the [[Palace of the soviets|Palace of the Soviets]]: failure.\n\nThis was a comprehensive mobilization; the project drew resources and workers from the entire Soviet Union. In his article, archeologist Mike O'Mahoney describes the scope of the Metro mobilization:\n\n{{quote|A specialist workforce had been drawn from many different regions, including miners from the Ukrainian and Siberian coalfields and construction workers from the iron and steel mills of Magnitogorsk, the Dniepr hydroelectric power station, and the Turkestan-Siberian railway... materials used in the construction of the metro included iron from Siberian Kuznetsk, timber from northern Russia, cement from the Volga region and the norther Caucasus, bitumen from Baku, and marble and granite from quarries in Karelia, the Crimea, the Caucasus, the Urals, and the Soviet Far East<ref>{{cite journal |last=O'Mahoney |first=Mike |title=Archaeological Fantasies: Constructing History on the Moscow Metro |journal=The Modern Language Review |date=January 2003 |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=138\u2013150 |jstor=3738180 |doi=10.2307/3738180}}</ref>|Mike O'Mahoney|Archeological Fantasies: Constructing History on the Moscow Metro}}\n\nSkilled engineers were scarce, and unskilled workers were instrumental to the realization of the metro. The ''Metrostroi'' (the organization responsible for the Metro's construction) conducted massive recruitment campaigns. It printed 15,000 copies of ''Udarnik metrostroia'' (''Metrostroi Shock Worker'', its daily newspaper) and 700 other newsletters (some in different languages) to attract unskilled laborers. Kaganovich was closely involved in the recruitment campaign, targeting the [[Komsomol]] generation because of its strength and youth.\n\n====Patriotic influences====\nWhen the Metro opened in 1935 it immediately became the centrepiece of the transportation system. More than that, it was a Stalinist device to awe and control the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. Kaganovich was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilization as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and physical prowess on the powerful new \"[[Homo Sovieticus]]\" (Soviet man).<ref>Isabel W\u00fcnsche, \"Homo Sovieticus: The Athletic Motif in the Design of the Dynamo Metro Station,\" ''Studies in the Decorative Arts'' (2000) 7#2 pp 65-90</ref> The metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order\u2014a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.<ref>Andrew Jenks, \"A Metro on the Mount,\" ''Technology & Culture'' (2000) 41#4 pp 697-723p</ref>\n\nThe Metro was iconic also because it showcased [[Socialist realism|Socialist Realism]] in public art. Socialist Realism was in fact a method, not a style.<ref name=\"Cooke 1997 137\u2013160\"/> This method was influenced by [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] favorite 19th-century [[Nihilist movement|nihilist]], who stated that \"art is no use unless it serves politics\".<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\"/> This maxim explains why the stations combined aesthetics, technology and ideology. Any plan which did not incorporate all three areas cohesively was rejected. Without this cohesion, the Metro would not reflect Socialist Realism. If the Metro did not utilize Socialist Realism, it would fail to illustrate Stalinist values and transform Soviet citizens into socialists. Anything less than Socialist Realism's grand artistic complexity would fail to inspire a long-lasting, nationalistic attachment to Stalin's new society.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Voyce |first=Arthur |title=Soviet Art and Architecture: Recent Developments |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |date=January 1956 |volume=303 |series=Russia Since Stalin: Old Trends and New Problems |pages=104\u2013115 |jstor=1032295 |doi=10.1177/000271625630300110}}</ref>\n\n===Moscow Central Circle urban railway (Line 14)===\n{{main|Moscow Central Circle}}\n[[File:MCC 12LUZH 7041 PLAT.jpg|thumb|alt=Large, light outdoor station|[[Luzhniki (Moscow Central Circle)|Luzhniki]] MCC station]]\nA proposal to convert the [[Little Ring of the Moscow Railway]] into a [[Urban rail transit|metropolitan railway]] with frequent passenger service was announced in 2012.

The fare has been steadily rising since 1991, hastened by [[inflation]] (taking into account the [[Monetary reform in Russia, 1998|1998 revaluation]] of the [[Russian ruble|ruble]] by a factor of 1,000). Effective February 2017, one ride costs 55 rubles (approx. 1 US dollar). Discounts (up to 33 percent) are available when buying a multiple-trip ticket (starting with twenty-trip cards), and children under age seven can travel free with their parents.\n\nTickets are available for a fixed number of trips, regardless of distance traveled or number of transfers. Monthly and yearly passes are also available. Fare enforcement takes place at the points of entry. Once a passenger has entered the Metro system, there are no further ticket checks \u2013 one can ride to any number of stations and make transfers within the system freely. Transfers to other public-transport systems (such as bus, tram, trolleybus) are not covered by the ticket. Transfer to monorail is free within 90 minutes.\n\nBefore 1991, turnstiles accepted coins; however, with the start of [[hyperinflation]] plastic tokens of various design were used. Disposable [[magnetic stripe card]]s were introduced in 1993 on a trial basis, and used as unlimited monthly tickets between 1996 and 1998. The sale of tokens ended on 1 January 1999, and they stopped being accepted in February 1999; from that time, magnetic cards were used as tickets with a fixed number of trips.\n\nOn 1 September 1998, the Moscow Metro became the first metro system in Europe to fully implement contactless [[smart cards]], known as Transport Cards. The card has an unlimited number of trips and may be programmed for 30, 90 or 365 days. The first purchase includes a one-time cost of 50 rubles, and its active lifetime is projected as 3\u00bd years; defective cards are exchanged at no cost. Unlimited cards are also available for students at reduced price (as of 2017, 365 rubles\u2014or about $US6\u2014for a calendar month of unlimited usage) for a one-time cost of 70 rubles. Transport Cards impose a delay for each consecutive use; i.e. the card can not be used for seven minutes after the user has passed through the turnstile.\n\nIn January 2007, Moscow Metro began replacing magnetic cards with [[Smart card#Contactless smart cards|contactless]] disposable tickets based on [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP's]] [[MIFARE|MIFARE Ultralight]] technology. Ultralight tickets are available for a fixed number of trips in 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 60-trip denominations (valid for 5 or 90 days from the day of purchase) and as a monthly ticket, only valid for a selected calendar month and limited to 70 trips. The sale of magnetic cards stopped 16 January 2008 and magnetic cards stopped being accepted in late 2008, making the Moscow metro the world's first major public-transport system to run exclusively on a contactless automatic fare-collection system.<ref name=mifareinmoscow>{{cite web |url=http://www.nxp.com/news/content/file_1518.html |title=Moscow Metro: the World's First Major Transport System to operate fully contactless with NXP's MIFARE Technology |publisher=[[NXP Semiconductors]] |accessdate=26 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2004, the [[Government of Moscow|city government]] launched the Muscovite's Social Card program. Social Cards are free smart cards issued for the elderly and other groups of citizens officially registered as residents of Moscow or the [[Moscow region]]; they offer discounts in shops and pharmacies, and double as credit cards issued by the [[Bank of Moscow]]. Social Cards can be used for unlimited free access to the city's public-transport system, including the Moscow Metro; while they do not feature the time delay, they include a photograph and are non-transferable.\n\nSince 2006, [[Banking in Russia|several banks]] have issued [[credit card]]s which double as Ultralight cards and are accepted at turnstiles. The fare is passed to the bank and the payment is withdrawn from the owner's bank account at the end of the calendar month, using a discount rate based on the number of trips that month (for up to 70 trips, the cost of each trip is prorated from current Ultralight rates; each additional trip costs 24.14 rubles).<ref name=rates_2010/> Partner banks include the [[Bank of Moscow]], [[CitiBank]], [[Rosbank]], [[Alfa-Bank]] and [[Avangard Bank]].<ref name=creditcards>{{cite web |url=http://old.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=779 |title=\u0411\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430 |publisher=Moscow metro |accessdate=20 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727014525/http://old.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=779 |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 2 April 2013 Moscow Transport Department introduced a smart card based transport electronic wallet called ''Troika''.
