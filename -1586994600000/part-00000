It is in the County of [[Somerset]], and is approximately {{convert|20|mi|km|1}} north east of [[Taunton]], the [[county town]] of [[Somerset]]. It is no longer a market town, the market site is now a housing estate. Highbridge is in the District of [[Sedgemoor]], being situated approximately {{convert|7|mi|km|1}} north of [[Bridgwater]], the district's administrative centre. Highbridge closely neighbours [[Burnham-on-Sea]], forming part of the combined parish of [[Burnham-on-Sea and Highbridge]] and shares a [[Parish councils in England|town council]] with the resort town.  In the 2001 census the population was 5,986.  In the 2011 census the population of the town was included in the ward of Highbridge and Burnham Marine, which totalled 7,555.<ref>[https://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=13696068&c=Highbridge&d=14&e=62&g=6461723&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1424284203969&enc=1 2011 Census, Neighbourhood statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218213234/https://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=13696068&c=Highbridge&d=14&e=62&g=6461723&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1424284203969&enc=1 |date=18 February 2015 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThere is archaeological evidence of occupation around the Highbridge area at least as far back as the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] period.  A bridged crossing over the River Brue at this location has existed since the 14th century and it has always been an important crossing on the route from [[Bristol]] to the [[South West England|South West]]. The town that sprung up around this crossing takes its name from the bridge. An older name for the local [[Manorialism|manor]] was \"Huish\" a contraction of the phrase \"Huish jaxta altum pontem\" (next to a high bridge). There are historical references to a wharf at this site and to usage of the river as part of the drainage plan for the [[Somerset Levels]] by the Monks of [[Glastonbury]].\n\nHighbridge grew in importance as a regional market and industrial town during the latter half of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century. Important employers included the livestock and cheese market, Highbridge Wharf, [[Buncombe's Steamrollers]], and the [[Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway]] rail works, which closed in 1930 with the loss of 400 jobs. Heavy industry and transport declined in Highbridge after the [[Second World War]] as the Wharf proved too small for the newer generation of ships, with the last cargo of timber arriving in 1948 and the wharf was closed to shipping the following year,<ref name=\"somharbours\">{{cite book |title=Somerset Harbours |last=Farr |first=Grahame |authorlink= |year=1954 |publisher=Christopher Johnson |location=London |isbn= |page=96 }}</ref>\nand commercial freight moved away from the railways. Since the 1970s close proximity to the [[M5 motorway]] has driven a growth in light industry and in the town's [[commuter]] population.\n\nHighbridge was historically a hamlet and [[chapelry]] in the large ancient parish of Burnham.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/259 |title=Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales |year=1970 |accessdate=2015-01-26 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224017/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/259 |archivedate= 3 March 2016 }}</ref>  It briefly became a separate civil parish in 1894, but in 1896 the civil parish was abolished and divided between the new civil parishes of North Highbridge and [[Burnham Without]].  The town had by then expanded south of the River Brue into the parish of [[Huntspill]], and in 1896 the new parish of South Highbridge was carved out of Huntspill parish. North Highbridge and South Highbridge together formed the Highbrige [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]].<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10434543 Vision of Britain website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224224102/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10434543 |date=24 December 2014 }}</ref>  The 1931 census listed a population of 2,585.  In 1933 the Urban District was abolished and merged into Burnham-on-Sea Urban District.   In the 1974 local government reforms, this became a civil parish within the new District of Sedgemoor.  The civil parish is now known as Burnham-on-Sea and Highbridge, with a single town council.\n\nThe joining of the two towns remains a contentious issue. A 2001 independence referendum was unsuccessful, but there remains strong feeling among some sections of the community, as evidenced by a number of incidents of vandalism involving signs on the approach to the town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.burnham-on-sea.com/news/2006/sign-vandals-04-05-06.shtml |title=Anger after vandals remove 'Burnham-On-Sea' from roadside signs |publisher=Burnham-on-Sea.com |date=2006-05-04 |accessdate=2008-12-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810044245/http://www.burnham-on-sea.com/news/2006/sign-vandals-04-05-06.shtml |archivedate=10 August 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004 a community group, the Highbridge History Project, commemorated the 150th anniversary of opening of the town's station by publishing the results of their own five-year-long study into the town's history ([https://web.archive.org/web/20040406054706/http://www.thewestonmercury.co.uk/archived_material/2004/week_13/features/asp/04-03-26Glimpse.asp  Weston Mercury] \"A Glimpse into the past\").\n\n==Governance==\n\nHighbridge is within the [[Sedgemoor]] [[Non-metropolitan district]] which has traditionally been [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] run since its creation in 1974.<ref>{{cite web | title=Election 2007 - Sedgemoor | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2007/councils/html/40uc.stm| publisher= BBC News | accessdate=2008-12-30}}</ref>\n\nThere is one [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral ward]] named 'Highbridge and Burnham Marine'. The population taken at the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]] is identical to that shown above.\n\n[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] fared well in Burnham and Highbridge areas until 1999, when the Conservatives re-took Sedgemoor, with the Liberal Democrats losing the seat of Highbridge to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]. It has since returned Liberal Democrats with a substantial majority.\n\nNationally, Highbridge falls within the [[Wells (UK Parliament constituency)|Wells]] [[county constituency]] which elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], by the [[first past the post]] voting system. Between 2010 and 2015, [[Tessa Munt]] of the Liberal Democrats was the elected MP for the constituency. She lost her seat in the 2015 General Election to the Conservative candidate [[James Heappey]], who was elected with a 7585-vote majority\n\nIt is also within the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England]] European Parliament constituency.\n\n== Transport ==\n\nHighbridge was originally the seaward terminus of the [[Glastonbury Canal]] and the [[Somerset Central Railway]]. The Canal was established first and was designed to improve drainage along the River Brue. It was also designed to create a trade link between [[Glastonbury]] and the sea. A new straight channel, with a [[Sluice#Regional names for sluice gates|clyce]] (the local name for a sluice),<ref>{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Robin |author2=Romey Williams |title=The Somerset Levels |year=1992 |publisher=Ex Libris Press |location=Bradford on Avon |isbn=0948578386 |page=72 }}</ref> which runs from the present day tidal gates to the location of the current station, was cut in 1801 and the original course of the river was as the site for of Highbridge Wharf. The Canal opened in 1833 and while initially successful it later suffered from financial and engineering problems.<ref name=body>G. Body and R. Gallop, (2001), ''The Glastonbury Canal'', Fiducia Press, {{ISBN|0-946217-08-4}}</ref> Only the 1801 clyce remains of the Glastonbury Canal at Highbridge.\n\nIn 1844, the [[Bristol and Exeter Railway]] (a future component of the [[Great Western Railway]]) opened a station at Highbridge on what is now the [[Great Western Main Line]]. Ten years later the railway companies realised the potential of the route of the failing Glastonbury Canal and it was bought out by the Somerset Central Railway (a component of the [[Somerset and Dorset Railway]]).<ref name =atthill-nock>Robin Atthill & [[O. S. Nock]], 1967. ''The Somerset & Dorset Railway''. Newton Abbot: [[David & Charles]]. {{ISBN|0 7153 4312 2}}.</ref>\nThis allowed them to run a railway line along the route of the old canal. Shortly afterwards local branch lines to Burnham-on-Sea and to the Wharf were added. These lines crossed the Great Western lines at grade, and crossed Church Street (the [[A38 road|A38]], and at that time the main road route to [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]]) at a notorious [[level crossing]] which led to long tailbacks in the summer months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sdjr.net/locations/highbridge.html |title=The Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway - Highbridge |publisher=www.sdjr.net |date=2007-08-10 |accessdate=2008-12-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823204222/http://www.sdjr.net/locations/highbridge.html |archivedate=23 August 2007 }}</ref>\nNo traces of the crossing or associated signal box remain. At its height Highbridge Station had five platforms and a carriage works. The decline of the British railway network hit the Highbridge Station hard and today there remain only two unstaffed platforms, following the closure of two branch lines in the 1960s. The official name of the station is now [[Highbridge and Burnham railway station|Highbridge and Burnham]].\nThe old Highbridge Station, which was a Brunel original, was demolished in the 1980s. The Victorian former Station Master's house was also demolished. A housing estate now stands on much of the old railway lands.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHighbridge town centre clusters around the crossroads formed by Church Street and Market Street. At their meeting point is a roundabout which marks the location of the town's original three-faced town clock. A modern concrete replacement clock, also with three faces and topped with the town's coat of arms stood in nearby Jubilee Gardens until its replacement with a more traditional four-faced clock in 2012.<ref name=\"clock\">{{cite web|title=Time for a change! |work=Burnham-on-sea.com |url=http://www.burnham-on-sea.com/news/2012/clock-to-come-down-04-04-12.php |accessdate=12 December 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608162032/http://burnham-on-sea.com/news/2012/clock-to-come-down-04-04-12.php |archivedate= 8 June 2012 }}</ref> The town centre has faced a steady decline in recent years, with numerous small independent shops and major banks closing.

In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around {{convert|700|mm|abbr=on}}.

Following the closure of many small family shops and businesses and the development of some [[industrial estates]] (which take advantage of the proximity of the [[M5 motorway]]) much local employment is now in transport and light industry on the outskirts of the town - including food storage and distribution for [[Yeo Valley Organic]] and road hauliers [[R T Keedwell]].

However, since cuts by [[Sedgemoor|Sedgemoor District Council]] in 2007/08, these offices have not been open to the public.\n\nLike most British towns Highbridge has had its ample share of alehouses and inns. Many of these depended on trade from the wharf and livestock market and numerous public houses existed close to these facilities along Newtown Road. Now only The Globe remains in this area. The Cooper's Arms, once recognised by the [[Campaign for Real Ale]] (CAMRA) as one of the best pubs in the region has declined in popularity in recent times. Since the freehold was sold it has had various tenants, none of which have been successful. The town is also served by The Bristol Bridge Inn and a thriving [[social club]]. This decline in the number of public houses has also affected local [[skittles (sport)|skittles]] leagues who are facing a reduction in the number of venues in which this locally very popular pub game can be played.\n\n== Education ==\nThe town is served by Churchfield Church School - a primary [[Academy (English School)|academy]] managed by the [[Diocese of Bath and Wells]], and amalgamated from the former Beechfield Infant School and St. John's Church of England Junior Schools which shared the same site. The local coeducational [[comprehensive school]] is [[The King Alfred School, Highbridge|The King Alfred School]], which sits in Highbridge near the border with Burnham-on-Sea, which it also serves.

It is in the County of [[Somerset]], and is approximately {{convert|20|mi|km|1}} north east of [[Taunton]], the [[county town]] of [[Somerset]]. It is no longer a market town, the market site is now a housing estate. Highbridge is in the District of [[Sedgemoor]], being situated approximately {{convert|7|mi|km|1}} north of [[Bridgwater]], the district's administrative centre. Highbridge closely neighbours [[Burnham-on-Sea]], forming part of the combined parish of [[Burnham-on-Sea and Highbridge]] and shares a [[Parish councils in England|town council]] with the resort town.  In the 2001 census the population was 5,986.  In the 2011 census the population of the town was included in the ward of Highbridge and Burnham Marine, which totalled 7,555.<ref>[https://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=13696068&c=Highbridge&d=14&e=62&g=6461723&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1424284203969&enc=1 2011 Census, Neighbourhood statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218213234/https://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=13696068&c=Highbridge&d=14&e=62&g=6461723&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1424284203969&enc=1 |date=18 February 2015 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThere is archaeological evidence of occupation around the Highbridge area at least as far back as the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] period.  A bridged crossing over the River Brue at this location has existed since the 14th century and it has always been an important crossing on the route from [[Bristol]] to the [[South West England|South West]]. The town that sprung up around this crossing takes its name from the bridge. An older name for the local [[Manorialism|manor]] was \"Huish\" a contraction of the phrase \"Huish jaxta altum pontem\" (next to a high bridge). There are historical references to a wharf at this site and to usage of the river as part of the drainage plan for the [[Somerset Levels]] by the Monks of [[Glastonbury]].\n\nHighbridge grew in importance as a regional market and industrial town during the latter half of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century. Important employers included the livestock and cheese market, Highbridge Wharf, [[Buncombe's Steamrollers]], and the [[Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway]] rail works, which closed in 1930 with the loss of 400 jobs. Heavy industry and transport declined in Highbridge after the [[Second World War]] as the Wharf proved too small for the newer generation of ships, with the last cargo of timber arriving in 1948 and the wharf was closed to shipping the following year,<ref name=\"somharbours\">{{cite book |title=Somerset Harbours |last=Farr |first=Grahame |authorlink= |year=1954 |publisher=Christopher Johnson |location=London |isbn= |page=96 }}</ref>\nand commercial freight moved away from the railways. Since the 1970s close proximity to the [[M5 motorway]] has driven a growth in light industry and in the town's [[commuter]] population.\n\nHighbridge was historically a hamlet and [[chapelry]] in the large ancient parish of Burnham.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/259 |title=Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales |year=1970 |accessdate=2015-01-26 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224017/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/259 |archivedate= 3 March 2016 }}</ref>  It briefly became a separate civil parish in 1894, but in 1896 the civil parish was abolished and divided between the new civil parishes of North Highbridge and [[Burnham Without]].  The town had by then expanded south of the River Brue into the parish of [[Huntspill]], and in 1896 the new parish of South Highbridge was carved out of Huntspill parish. North Highbridge and South Highbridge together formed the Highbrige [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]].<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10434543 Vision of Britain website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224224102/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10434543 |date=24 December 2014 }}</ref>  The 1931 census listed a population of 2,585.  In 1933 the Urban District was abolished and merged into Burnham-on-Sea Urban District.   In the 1974 local government reforms, this became a civil parish within the new District of Sedgemoor.  The civil parish is now known as Burnham-on-Sea and Highbridge, with a single town council.\n\nThe joining of the two towns remains a contentious issue. A 2001 independence referendum was unsuccessful, but there remains strong feeling among some sections of the community, as evidenced by a number of incidents of vandalism involving signs on the approach to the town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.burnham-on-sea.com/news/2006/sign-vandals-04-05-06.shtml |title=Anger after vandals remove 'Burnham-On-Sea' from roadside signs |publisher=Burnham-on-Sea.com |date=2006-05-04 |accessdate=2008-12-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810044245/http://www.burnham-on-sea.com/news/2006/sign-vandals-04-05-06.shtml |archivedate=10 August 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004 a community group, the Highbridge History Project, commemorated the 150th anniversary of opening of the town's station by publishing the results of their own five-year-long study into the town's history ([https://web.archive.org/web/20040406054706/http://www.thewestonmercury.co.uk/archived_material/2004/week_13/features/asp/04-03-26Glimpse.asp  Weston Mercury] \"A Glimpse into the past\").\n\n==Governance==\n\nHighbridge is within the [[Sedgemoor]] [[Non-metropolitan district]] which has traditionally been [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] run since its creation in 1974.<ref>{{cite web | title=Election 2007 - Sedgemoor | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2007/councils/html/40uc.stm| publisher= BBC News | accessdate=2008-12-30}}</ref>\n\nThere is one [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral ward]] named 'Highbridge and Burnham Marine'.

It has since returned Liberal Democrats with a substantial majority.\n\nNationally, Highbridge falls within the [[Wells (UK Parliament constituency)|Wells]] [[county constituency]] which elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], by the [[first past the post]] voting system. Between 2010 and 2015, [[Tessa Munt]] of the Liberal Democrats was the elected MP for the constituency. She lost her seat in the 2015 General Election to the Conservative candidate [[James Heappey]], who was elected with a 7585-vote majority\n\nIt is also within the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England]] European Parliament constituency.\n\n== Transport ==\n\nHighbridge was originally the seaward terminus of the [[Glastonbury Canal]] and the [[Somerset Central Railway]]. The Canal was established first and was designed to improve drainage along the River Brue. It was also designed to create a trade link between [[Glastonbury]] and the sea. A new straight channel, with a [[Sluice#Regional names for sluice gates|clyce]] (the local name for a sluice),<ref>{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Robin |author2=Romey Williams |title=The Somerset Levels |year=1992 |publisher=Ex Libris Press |location=Bradford on Avon |isbn=0948578386 |page=72 }}</ref> which runs from the present day tidal gates to the location of the current station, was cut in 1801 and the original course of the river was as the site for of Highbridge Wharf. The Canal opened in 1833 and while initially successful it later suffered from financial and engineering problems.<ref name=body>G. Body and R. Gallop, (2001), ''The Glastonbury Canal'', Fiducia Press, {{ISBN|0-946217-08-4}}</ref> Only the 1801 clyce remains of the Glastonbury Canal at Highbridge.\n\nIn 1844, the [[Bristol and Exeter Railway]] (a future component of the [[Great Western Railway]]) opened a station at Highbridge on what is now the [[Great Western Main Line]]. Ten years later the railway companies realised the potential of the route of the failing Glastonbury Canal and it was bought out by the Somerset Central Railway (a component of the [[Somerset and Dorset Railway]]).<ref name =atthill-nock>Robin Atthill & [[O. S. Nock]], 1967. ''The Somerset & Dorset Railway''. Newton Abbot: [[David & Charles]]. {{ISBN|0 7153 4312 2}}.</ref>\nThis allowed them to run a railway line along the route of the old canal. Shortly afterwards local branch lines to Burnham-on-Sea and to the Wharf were added. These lines crossed the Great Western lines at grade, and crossed Church Street (the [[A38 road|A38]], and at that time the main road route to [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]]) at a notorious [[level crossing]] which led to long tailbacks in the summer months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sdjr.net/locations/highbridge.html |title=The Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway - Highbridge |publisher=www.sdjr.net |date=2007-08-10 |accessdate=2008-12-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823204222/http://www.sdjr.net/locations/highbridge.html |archivedate=23 August 2007 }}</ref>\nNo traces of the crossing or associated signal box remain. At its height Highbridge Station had five platforms and a carriage works. The decline of the British railway network hit the Highbridge Station hard and today there remain only two unstaffed platforms, following the closure of two branch lines in the 1960s. The official name of the station is now [[Highbridge and Burnham railway station|Highbridge and Burnham]].\nThe old Highbridge Station, which was a Brunel original, was demolished in the 1980s. The Victorian former Station Master's house was also demolished. A housing estate now stands on much of the old railway lands.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHighbridge town centre clusters around the crossroads formed by Church Street and Market Street. At their meeting point is a roundabout which marks the location of the town's original three-faced town clock. A modern concrete replacement clock, also with three faces and topped with the town's coat of arms stood in nearby Jubilee Gardens until its replacement with a more traditional four-faced clock in 2012.<ref name=\"clock\">{{cite web|title=Time for a change! |work=Burnham-on-sea.com |url=http://www.burnham-on-sea.com/news/2012/clock-to-come-down-04-04-12.php |accessdate=12 December 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608162032/http://burnham-on-sea.com/news/2012/clock-to-come-down-04-04-12.php |archivedate= 8 June 2012 }}</ref> The town centre has faced a steady decline in recent years, with numerous small independent shops and major banks closing.

In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around {{convert|700|mm|abbr=on}}.

Following the closure of many small family shops and businesses and the development of some [[industrial estates]] (which take advantage of the proximity of the [[M5 motorway]]) much local employment is now in transport and light industry on the outskirts of the town - including food storage and distribution for [[Yeo Valley Organic]] and road hauliers [[R T Keedwell]].

However, since cuts by [[Sedgemoor|Sedgemoor District Council]] in 2007/08, these offices have not been open to the public.\n\nLike most British towns Highbridge has had its ample share of alehouses and inns. Many of these depended on trade from the wharf and livestock market and numerous public houses existed close to these facilities along Newtown Road. Now only The Globe remains in this area. The Cooper's Arms, once recognised by the [[Campaign for Real Ale]] (CAMRA) as one of the best pubs in the region has declined in popularity in recent times. Since the freehold was sold it has had various tenants, none of which have been successful. The town is also served by The Bristol Bridge Inn and a thriving [[social club]]. This decline in the number of public houses has also affected local [[skittles (sport)|skittles]] leagues who are facing a reduction in the number of venues in which this locally very popular pub game can be played.\n\n== Education ==\nThe town is served by Churchfield Church School - a primary [[Academy (English School)|academy]] managed by the [[Diocese of Bath and Wells]], and amalgamated from the former Beechfield Infant School and St. John's Church of England Junior Schools which shared the same site. The local coeducational [[comprehensive school]] is [[The King Alfred School, Highbridge|The King Alfred School]], which sits in Highbridge near the border with Burnham-on-Sea, which it also serves.

When they arrive, Alex gives Marie a tour of her house before they settle down for dinner. After dinner, Marie and Alex get ready to go to bed. As Alex sleeps, Marie lies on her bed listening to music and masturbating. Marie hears a doorbell ring and Alex's father Daniel wakes to answer it. The man at the door is a [[serial killer]], who slashes Daniel's face with a straight razor. His head is pressed between two spindles of the staircase, and the killer shoves a bookcase towards his head, decapitating him. The noise awakens Alex's mother, who finds Daniel dead and is approached by the killer.\n\nMarie, hearing the mother's screams, quickly arranges the guest room to make it appear that no one is staying there, and hides under her bed. The killer inspects Marie's room but does not find her. Marie creeps downstairs and finds Alex chained in her bedroom. Promising to find help, she sneaks into the parents' room to find a phone. After hearing loud thuds, she hides in the closet and through the slats of the door witnesses the killing of Alex's mother as her throat is brutally slashed with a razor.\n\nAlex's younger brother Tom runs from the house to the cornfield, pursued by the killer. Marie returns to Alex, where she witnesses Tom's murder from a window. Marie promises to free Alex, but the killer is heard returning. Marie sneaks into the kitchen and takes a [[butcher knife]]. Alex is dragged into the killer's truck. Marie sneaks into the truck with the butcher knife and hides there with Alex. He locks them in and drives off.\n\nWhen the killer stops at a gas station, Marie gives Alex the knife and sneaks into the gas station shop for help. When the killer comes into the shop, Marie hides and she witnesses the store clerk Jimmy being murdered with an axe. The killer returns to the truck and Marie calls the police, but hangs up in frustration when she's unable to tell them where she is. She takes the clerk's keys and uses his car to follow the killer down a deserted road. The killer notices Marie following him, and rams Marie's vehicle, pushing the car off the road where it wrecks. Exiting on foot, badly injured, Marie runs into the forest as the killer seeks her. Eventually, Marie bludgeons the killer with a fence post covered in barbed wire. As Marie inspects the body, he grabs at her throat, so Marie suffocates him with a plastic sheet and makes her way back to the truck. Alex seems terrified of Marie as she returns to the vehicle. As police investigate the gas station murders via the in-store videotape, the tape shows Marie murdering the store clerk. In retrospect, the audience is shown how the family murders really happened. Finally, the audience discovers that Marie is murderous, delusional, and in love with Alex.\n\nAt the truck, Marie unties Alex. As soon as Alex is free, she threatens Marie with the knife and accuses her of butchering her family. Alex slashes Marie's face and stabs her in the stomach before running into the forest. Marie chases Alex with a concrete saw. Alex finds a road and flags down a car. As Alex is climbing into the car, Marie appears brandishing the [[concrete saw]] and disembowels the driver. A stray piece of glass slices Alex's Achilles tendon. Alex takes a crowbar from the car's toolbox and crawls along the road. Marie forces Alex to tell her that she loves her, and she kisses her. While engaged in the kiss, Alex plunges the crowbar into Marie's upper-chest as Marie proclaims she'll never let anyone come between them.\n\nThe final scene shows Marie in a [[psychiatric hospital]] room, and Alex watching her through a [[one-way mirror]]. Marie grins and reaches for Alex, aware that she is behind it.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[C\u00e9cile de France]] as Marie\n* [[Ma\u00efwenn]] as Alex\n* [[Philippe Nahon]] as The Killer\n* Andrei Finti as Daniel, Alex's father\n* [[Oana Pellea]] as Alex's mother\n* [[Franck Khalfoun]] as Jimmy\n* Marco Claudiu Pascu as Tom, Alex's brother\n\n==Release==\n''High Tension'' was released in France on 18 June 2003 where it was distributed by [[EuropaCorp]].<ref name=\"bifi\">{{cite web|url=http://cinema.encyclopedie.films.bifi.fr/index.php?pk=85567&_ga=1.195491308.1914682728.1478821728|publisher=Bifi.fr|title=Haute tension (2002) Alexandre Aja|accessdate=5 January 2017|language=French}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shown at the [[2003 Toronto International Film Festival]] during the Midnight Madness section.{{sfn|West|2016|p=179}} After screening at the festival, the film was purchased by [[Lionsgate Films]] for North American distribution.{{sfn|West|2016|p=179}} In her book ''Films of the New French Extremity'', Alexandra West described The screening of ''High Tension'' at Midnight Madness made that section of the film festival an \"unintentional bastion for [[New French Extremity]]\", which still did not have a popular following.

When they arrive, Alex gives Marie a tour of her house before they settle down for dinner. After dinner, Marie and Alex get ready to go to bed. As Alex sleeps, Marie lies on her bed listening to music and masturbating. Marie hears a doorbell ring and Alex's father Daniel wakes to answer it. The man at the door is a [[serial killer]], who slashes Daniel's face with a straight razor. His head is pressed between two spindles of the staircase, and the killer shoves a bookcase towards his head, decapitating him. The noise awakens Alex's mother, who finds Daniel dead and is approached by the killer.\n\nMarie, hearing the mother's screams, quickly arranges the guest room to make it appear that no one is staying there, and hides under her bed. The killer inspects Marie's room but does not find her. Marie creeps downstairs and finds Alex chained in her bedroom. Promising to find help, she sneaks into the parents' room to find a phone. After hearing loud thuds, she hides in the closet and through the slats of the door witnesses the killing of Alex's mother as her throat is brutally slashed with a razor.\n\nAlex's younger brother Tom runs from the house to the cornfield, pursued by the killer. Marie returns to Alex, where she witnesses Tom's murder from a window. Marie promises to free Alex, but the killer is heard returning. Marie sneaks into the kitchen and takes a [[butcher knife]]. Alex is dragged into the killer's truck. Marie sneaks into the truck with the butcher knife and hides there with Alex. He locks them in and drives off.\n\nWhen the killer stops at a gas station, Marie gives Alex the knife and sneaks into the gas station shop for help. When the killer comes into the shop, Marie hides and she witnesses the store clerk Jimmy being murdered with an axe. The killer returns to the truck and Marie calls the police, but hangs up in frustration when she's unable to tell them where she is. She takes the clerk's keys and uses his car to follow the killer down a deserted road. The killer notices Marie following him, and rams Marie's vehicle, pushing the car off the road where it wrecks. Exiting on foot, badly injured, Marie runs into the forest as the killer seeks her. Eventually, Marie bludgeons the killer with a fence post covered in barbed wire. As Marie inspects the body, he grabs at her throat, so Marie suffocates him with a plastic sheet and makes her way back to the truck. Alex seems terrified of Marie as she returns to the vehicle. As police investigate the gas station murders via the in-store videotape, the tape shows Marie murdering the store clerk. In retrospect, the audience is shown how the family murders really happened. Finally, the audience discovers that Marie is murderous, delusional, and in love with Alex.\n\nAt the truck, Marie unties Alex. As soon as Alex is free, she threatens Marie with the knife and accuses her of butchering her family. Alex slashes Marie's face and stabs her in the stomach before running into the forest. Marie chases Alex with a concrete saw. Alex finds a road and flags down a car. As Alex is climbing into the car, Marie appears brandishing the [[concrete saw]] and disembowels the driver. A stray piece of glass slices Alex's Achilles tendon. Alex takes a crowbar from the car's toolbox and crawls along the road. Marie forces Alex to tell her that she loves her, and she kisses her. While engaged in the kiss, Alex plunges the crowbar into Marie's upper-chest as Marie proclaims she'll never let anyone come between them.\n\nThe final scene shows Marie in a [[psychiatric hospital]] room, and Alex watching her through a [[one-way mirror]]. Marie grins and reaches for Alex, aware that she is behind it.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[C\u00e9cile de France]] as Marie\n* [[Ma\u00efwenn]] as Alex\n* [[Philippe Nahon]] as The Killer\n* Andrei Finti as Daniel, Alex's father\n* [[Oana Pellea]] as Alex's mother\n* [[Franck Khalfoun]] as Jimmy\n* Marco Claudiu Pascu as Tom, Alex's brother\n\n==Release==\n''High Tension'' was released in France on 18 June 2003 where it was distributed by [[EuropaCorp]].<ref name=\"bifi\">{{cite web|url=http://cinema.encyclopedie.films.bifi.fr/index.php?pk=85567&_ga=1.195491308.1914682728.1478821728|publisher=Bifi.fr|title=Haute tension (2002) Alexandre Aja|accessdate=5 January 2017|language=French}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shown at the [[2003 Toronto International Film Festival]] during the Midnight Madness section.{{sfn|West|2016|p=179}} After screening at the festival, the film was purchased by [[Lionsgate Films]] for North American distribution.{{sfn|West|2016|p=179}} In her book ''Films of the New French Extremity'', Alexandra West described The screening of ''High Tension'' at Midnight Madness made that section of the film festival an \"unintentional bastion for [[New French Extremity]]\", which still did not have a popular following.

The map is subdivided into a [[hexagonal tiling]], small [[regular polygon|regular]] [[hexagon]]s of identical size.\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages==\n\nThe primary advantage of a hex map over a traditional [[square grid]] map is that the distance between the center of each and every pair of adjacent hex cells (or ''hex'') is the same. By comparison, in a square grid map, the distance from the center of each square cell to the center of the four diagonal adjacent cells it shares a corner with is greater than the distance to the center of the four adjacent cells it shares an edge with. This equidistant property of all adjacent hexes is desirable for games in which the measurement of movement is a factor. The other advantage is the fact that neighbouring cells always share edges; there are no two cells with contact at only a point.\n[[File:HexMapDistance.svg|thumb|300x300px|Advantage of hex maps in games in terms of distance from center to center compared to squares.]]\nOne disadvantage of a hex map is that hexes have adjacent cells in only six directions instead of eight, as in a square grid map. Commonly, cells will form continuous straight lines \"up\" and \"down\", or \"north\" and \"south\", in which case the other four adjacent cells lie \"north-west\", \"north-east\", \"south-west\" and \"south-east\". As a result, no hex cell has an adjacent hex cell lying directly east or west of it, making movement in a straight line east or west impossible. Instead, paths in these directions, and any other path that does not bisect one of the six cell edges, will \"zig-zag\"; since no two directions are [[orthogonal]], it is impossible to move forward in one direction without moving backwards slightly in the other.\n\n{{multiple image\n| width     = 150\n| image1    = Glinski chess bishop.png\n| caption1  = A [[hexagonal chess]] board, showing the three-colour system and the diagonal moves of a [[bishop (chess)|bishop]].\n| image2    = Fallout camera angles.png\n| caption2  = [[POV-Ray]] render mimicking ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'''s [[trimetric projection]] and hexagonal grid.\n}}\n\nGames that traditionally use the four [[cardinal direction]]s, or otherwise suit a square grid, may adapt to a hex grid in different ways.

The four directions of diagonal movement are likewise replaced with the six directions that lie through [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the cell; these \"diagonal\" movements travel along the edge between a pair of adjacent cells before arriving at another cell. A three-colour grid aids in visualising this movement, since it preserves the traditional chessboard's property that pieces moving diagonally land only on cells of the same colour.\n\n==Uses==\n\nThe hex map has been a favourite for game designers since 1961, when [[Charles S.

These semiconducting materials have unequal [[band gap]]s as opposed to a [[homojunction]]. It is often advantageous to engineer the electronic energy bands in many solid-state device applications, including semiconductor lasers, solar cells and transistors. The combination of multiple heterojunctions together in a device is called a '''heterostructure''', although the two terms are commonly used interchangeably. The requirement that each material be a semiconductor with unequal band gaps is somewhat loose, especially on small length scales, where electronic properties depend on spatial properties. A more modern definition of heterojunction is the interface between any two solid-state materials, including crystalline and amorphous structures of metallic, insulating, [[fast ion conductor]] and semiconducting materials.\n\nIn 2000, the [[Nobel Prize]] in physics was awarded jointly to [[Herbert Kroemer]] of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara|University of California]], [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]], [[United States|USA]] and [[Zhores I.

By incorporating a smaller [[direct band gap]] material like [[GaAs]] between two larger band gap layers like [[AlAs]], [[charge carriers in semiconductors|carriers]] can be confined so that [[lasing]] can occur at [[room temperature]] with low threshold currents. It took many years for the [[material science]] of heterostructure fabrication to catch up with Kroemer's ideas but now it is the industry standard. It was later discovered that the band gap could be controlled by taking advantage of the [[quantum size effects]] in [[quantum well]] heterostructures. Furthermore, heterostructures can be used as [[waveguide]]s to the [[step-index profile|index step]] which occurs at the interface, another major advantage to their use in semiconductor lasers. Semiconductor [[diode laser]]s used in [[CD]] and [[DVD]] players and [[fiber optic]] [[transceiver]]s are manufactured using alternating layers of various [[Semiconductor materials|III-V]] and [[Semiconductor materials|II-VI]] [[compound semiconductor]]s to form lasing heterostructures.\n* ''Bipolar transistors'': When a heterojunction is used as the base-emitter junction of a [[bipolar junction transistor]], extremely high forward [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] and low reverse gain result. This translates into very good high frequency operation (values in tens to hundreds of GHz) and low [[leakage current]]s. This device is called a [[heterojunction bipolar transistor]] (HBT).\n* ''Field effect transistors'': Heterojunctions are used in [[HEMT|high electron mobility transistors]] (HEMT) which can operate at significantly higher frequencies (over 500&nbsp;GHz). The proper [[doping (semiconductors)|doping]] profile and band alignment gives rise to extremely high [[electron mobility|electron mobilities]] by creating a [[2DEG|two dimensional electron gas]] within a [[intrinsic semiconductor|dopant free region]] where very little [[scattering]] can occur.\n\n== Energy band alignment ==\n\n[[Image:Heterojunction types.png|430px|thumb|right|The three types of semiconductor heterojunctions organized by band alignment.]]\n[[File:Straddling gap heterojunction band diagram.svg|thumb|[[Band diagram]] for straddling gap, ''n''-''n'' semiconductor heterojunction at equilibrium.]]\n\nThe behaviour of a semiconductor junction depends crucially on the alignment of the [[energy band]]s at the interface.\nSemiconductor interfaces can be organized into three types of heterojunctions: straddling gap (type I), staggered gap (type II) or broken gap (type III) as seen in the figure.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Semiconductor Nanostructures Quantum States and Electronic Transport|last=Ihn|first=Thomas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780199534432|location=United States of America|pages=66|chapter=ch. 5.1 Band engineering}}</ref> Away from the junction, the [[band bending]] can be computed based on the usual procedure of solving [[Poisson's equation]].\n\nVarious models exist to predict the band alignment.\n* The simplest (and least accurate) model is [[Anderson's rule]], which predicts the band alignment based on the properties of vacuum-semiconductor interfaces (in particular the vacuum [[electron affinity]]). The main limitation is its neglect of chemical bonding.\n* A ''common anion rule'' was proposed which guesses that since the valence band is related to anionic states, materials with the same anions should have very small valence band offsets.

It is often advantageous to engineer the electronic energy bands in many solid-state device applications, including semiconductor lasers, solar cells and transistors. The combination of multiple heterojunctions together in a device is called a '''heterostructure''', although the two terms are commonly used interchangeably. The requirement that each material be a semiconductor with unequal band gaps is somewhat loose, especially on small length scales, where electronic properties depend on spatial properties. A more modern definition of heterojunction is the interface between any two solid-state materials, including crystalline and amorphous structures of metallic, insulating, [[fast ion conductor]] and semiconducting materials.\n\nIn 2000, the [[Nobel Prize]] in physics was awarded jointly to [[Herbert Kroemer]] of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara|University of California]], [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]], [[United States|USA]] and [[Zhores I.

By incorporating a smaller [[direct band gap]] material like [[GaAs]] between two larger band gap layers like [[AlAs]], [[charge carriers in semiconductors|carriers]] can be confined so that [[lasing]] can occur at [[room temperature]] with low threshold currents. It took many years for the [[material science]] of heterostructure fabrication to catch up with Kroemer's ideas but now it is the industry standard. It was later discovered that the band gap could be controlled by taking advantage of the [[quantum size effects]] in [[quantum well]] heterostructures. Furthermore, heterostructures can be used as [[waveguide]]s to the [[step-index profile|index step]] which occurs at the interface, another major advantage to their use in semiconductor lasers. Semiconductor [[diode laser]]s used in [[CD]] and [[DVD]] players and [[fiber optic]] [[transceiver]]s are manufactured using alternating layers of various [[Semiconductor materials|III-V]] and [[Semiconductor materials|II-VI]] [[compound semiconductor]]s to form lasing heterostructures.\n* ''Bipolar transistors'': When a heterojunction is used as the base-emitter junction of a [[bipolar junction transistor]], extremely high forward [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] and low reverse gain result. This translates into very good high frequency operation (values in tens to hundreds of GHz) and low [[leakage current]]s. This device is called a [[heterojunction bipolar transistor]] (HBT).\n* ''Field effect transistors'': Heterojunctions are used in [[HEMT|high electron mobility transistors]] (HEMT) which can operate at significantly higher frequencies (over 500&nbsp;GHz). The proper [[doping (semiconductors)|doping]] profile and band alignment gives rise to extremely high [[electron mobility|electron mobilities]] by creating a [[2DEG|two dimensional electron gas]] within a [[intrinsic semiconductor|dopant free region]] where very little [[scattering]] can occur.\n\n== Energy band alignment ==\n\n[[Image:Heterojunction types.png|430px|thumb|right|The three types of semiconductor heterojunctions organized by band alignment.]]\n[[File:Straddling gap heterojunction band diagram.svg|thumb|[[Band diagram]] for straddling gap, ''n''-''n'' semiconductor heterojunction at equilibrium.]]\n\nThe behaviour of a semiconductor junction depends crucially on the alignment of the [[energy band]]s at the interface.\nSemiconductor interfaces can be organized into three types of heterojunctions: straddling gap (type I), staggered gap (type II) or broken gap (type III) as seen in the figure<ref>{{Cite book|title=Semiconductor Nanostructures Quantum States and Electronic Transport|last=Ihn|first=Thomas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780199534432|location=United States of America|pages=66|chapter=ch. 5.1 Band engineering}}</ref>.

For our purposes, it is sufficient to note the following:\n\n#To price a derivative whose payoff is a function of one or more underlying assets, we evaluate the expected value of its discounted payoff under a risk-neutral measure.\n#A risk-neutral measure, also known as an equivalent martingale measure, is one which is equivalent to the real-world measure, and which is arbitrage-free: under such a measure, the discounted price of each of the underlying assets is a martingale. See [[Girsanov's theorem]].\n#In the Black-Scholes and Heston frameworks (where filtrations are generated from a linearly independent set of Wiener processes alone), any equivalent measure can be described in a very loose sense by adding a drift to each of the Wiener processes.\n#By selecting certain values for the drifts described above, we may obtain an equivalent measure which fulfills the arbitrage-free condition.\n\nConsider a general situation where we have <math>n</math> underlying assets and a linearly independent set of <math>m</math> Wiener processes. The set of equivalent measures is isomorphic to '''R'''<sup>m</sup>, the space of possible drifts. Consider the set of equivalent martingale measures to be isomorphic to a manifold <math>M</math> embedded in '''R'''<sup>m</sup>; initially, consider the situation where we have no assets and <math>M</math> is isomorphic to '''R'''<sup>m</sup>.\n\nNow consider each of the underlying assets as providing a constraint on the set of equivalent measures, as its expected discount process must be equal to a constant (namely, its initial value). By adding one asset at a time, we may consider each additional constraint as reducing the dimension of <math>M</math> by one dimension. Hence we can see that in the general situation described above, the dimension of the set of equivalent martingale measures is <math>m-n</math>.\n\nIn the Black-Scholes model, we have one asset and one Wiener process. The dimension of the set of equivalent martingale measures is zero; hence it can be shown that there is a single value for the drift, and thus a single risk-neutral measure, under which the discounted asset <math>e^{-\\rho t}S_t</math> will be a martingale.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nIn the Heston model, we still have one asset (volatility is not considered to be directly observable or tradeable in the market) but we now have two Wiener processes - the first in the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) for the asset and the second in the SDE for the stochastic volatility. Here, the dimension of the set of equivalent martingale measures is one; there is no unique risk-free measure.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThis is of course problematic; while any of the risk-free measures may theoretically be used to price a derivative, it is likely that each of them will give a different price. In theory, however, only one of these risk-free measures would be compatible with the market prices of volatility-dependent options (for example, European calls, or more explicitly, [[variance swap]]s). Hence we could add a volatility-dependent asset;{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} by doing so, we add an additional constraint, and thus choose a single risk-free measure which is compatible with the market.

Sometimes the model is also calibrated to the variance swap term-structure as in Guillaume and Schoutens<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Guillaume |first1=Florence |title=Heston Model: The Variance Swap Calibration |journal=SSRN |date=April 23, 2013 |ssrn=2255550 }}</ref>. Yet another approach is to include forward start options, or barrier options as well, in order to capture the forward smile.\n\nUnder the Heston model, the price of vanilla options is given analytically, but requires a numerical method to compute the integral. Le Floc'h<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Le Floc'h |first1=Fabien |title=An adaptive Filon quadrature for stochastic volatility models |journal=Journal of Computational Finance |date=2018 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=65\u201388 |doi=10.21314/JCF.2018.356 }}</ref> summarizes the various quadratures applied and proposes an efficient adaptive Filon quadrature.\n\nThe calibration problem involves the [[Del#Gradient|gradient of the objective function]] with respect to the Heston parameters.  A finite difference approximation of the gradient has a tendency to create artificial numerical issues in the calibration. It is a much better idea to rely on [[automatic differentiation]] techniques. For example, the tangent mode of algorithmic differentiation may be applied using [[Automatic_differentiation#Automatic_differentiation_using_dual_numbers|dual numbers]] in a straightforward manner. Alternatively, Cui et al.<ref>{{cite arXiv|eprint=1511.08718|title=Full and fast calibration of the Heston stochastic volatility model|author1=Yiran Cui |author2=Sebastian del Ba\u00f1o Rollin |author3=Guido Germano |date=26 May 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=|class=q-fin.CP}}</ref> give explicit formulas for the analytical gradient.
