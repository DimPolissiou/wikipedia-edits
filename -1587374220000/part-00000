Bredenhof, Failure and Prospect: Lazarus and the Rich Man (Luke 16:19\u201331) in the Context of Luke-Acts (LNTS 603; London: Bloomsbury T&T Clark, 2019), pp 5-10 </ref>. \n\nThe story is unique to Luke and is not thought to come from the hypothetical [[Q document]].<ref name=\"Hultgren\"/>\n\n===As a literal historical event===\n{{refimprove|section|date=February 2020}}\nSome Christians view the story not as a parable, but as an actual event which was related by Jesus to his followers.<ref name=\"Webpage\">e.g. [http://www.bible.ca/su-hades-luke16.htm#mainline Webpage]{{full citation needed|{{subst:DATE}}|date=February 2020}} which argues that Lazarus and the rich man is literally true (whilst the language used by them could have been figurative).</ref> This was generally the view of the medieval Church.\n\nSupporters of this view point to a key detail in the story: the use of a personal name (Lazarus) not found in any other parable. By contrast, in all of the other parables Jesus refers to a central character by a description, such as \"a certain man\", \"a sower\", and so forth.<ref> For a review of ancient and contemporary interpretations of the name 'Lazarus', see  R.M. Bredenhof, \"Looking for Lazarus: Assigning Meaning to the Poor Man in Luke 16.19\u201331\", New Testament Studies 66 (2020), pp 51-67. </ref>. \n\nCritics of this view point out that \"The soul that sins, it shall die\" (Ezekiel 18); \"For dust you are and to dust you shall return\" (Genesis 3:19). [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] (1 Thessalonians 4:13\u201318) describes death as sleep until the Day of the Lord, when the dead will receive glorified bodies upon the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15). No scripture, other than Philippians 1:23\u201325 (in which the apostle expresses the confidence that on departure from this life he would be with Christ), 2 Corinthians 12:2\u20134 (in which he affirms the possibility of being taken to paradise out of the body), 2 Corinthians 5:8, etc., accounts for a disembodied soul and its comfort or torture. Because this seems to raise the question of what kind of body is tortured in Hades as depicted in Luke, there are those who maintain that whilst the conversations took place as described, the language used in them, referring to body parts, etc., was figurative.<ref name=\"Webpage\" />\n\n===As a parable created by Jesus===\nOther Christians consider that this is a parable created by Jesus and told to his followers.<ref>e.g. ''The IVP Bible Background Commentary''</ref> [[N. T. Wright|Tom Wright]]<ref>Wright T. ''Luke for Everyone'' \"doesn't add anything new to the general folk belief about fortunes being reversed in a future life.

Proponents of this view argue that the story of Lazarus and the rich man has much in common with other stories which are agreed-upon parables, both in language and content (e.g. the reversal of fortunes, the use of antithesis, and concern for the poor).\n\n====Jesus using parable against the High Priest====\nAccording to [[Josephus]], [[Caiaphas]] was appointed [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] in AD 18 by the Roman [[Judea (Roman province)|prefect]] who preceded [[Pontius Pilate]], [[Valerius Gratus]].<ref name=\"oxford\">Metzger & Coogan  ''Oxford Companion to the Bible'', 1993. p 97</ref>\n\nOne identification is that the man in torment in the parable is Caiaphas the High Priest. Caiaphas met the criteria Jesus gives in the parable to the identity of the Rich Man. He was rich, and as the high priest was dressed in purple and fine linen, he had five brothers, and was well versed in Moses and the Prophets, but according to Jesus, were ignoring what they wrote.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_lazarus.htm |title = The Rich Man,Lazarus, and Abraham}}</ref>\n\n====Luther: a parable of the conscience====\n[[Martin Luther]] taught that the story was a parable about rich and poor in this life and the details of the afterlife not to be taken literally:\n\n{{quote|Therefore we conclude that the bosom of Abraham signifies nothing else than the Word of God,&nbsp;... the hell here mentioned cannot be the true hell that will begin on the day of judgment. For the corpse of the rich man is without doubt not in hell, but buried in the earth; it must however be a place where the soul can be and has no peace, and it cannot be corporeal. Therefore it seems to me, this hell is the conscience, which is without faith and without the Word of God, in which the soul is buried and held until the day of judgment, when they are cast down body and soul into the true and real hell.

This last interpretation had wide circulation in France during the 1860s\u20131890s as a result of having been included in the notes of the pictorial Bible of [[Claude-Joseph Drioux|Abb\u00e9 Drioux]].<ref>\"et c'est cet endurcissement que J\u00e9sus pr\u00e9dit quand il dit que du moment qu'ils n'\u00e9coutent ni Mo\u00efse ni les proph\u00e8tes ils n'\u00e9couteront pas d'avantage quelqu'un qui viendrait de l'autre monde\".

In Genesis 15\u2014a foundational covenant text familiar to any first century Jew\u2014God says to Abraham \"this man will not be your heir\" (Gen 15:4). Perry argues that this is why Lazarus is outside the gates of Abraham's perceived descendant. By inviting Lazarus to Abraham's bosom, Jesus is redefining the nature of the covenant. It also explains why the rich man assumes Lazarus is Abraham's servant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Perry|first=Simon|title=Resurrecting Interpretation: Technology, Hermeneutics and the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus|year=2012|publisher=Wipf and Stock|location=Eugene, OR|url=http://simonperry.org.uk/publications|accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref>\n\n==Afterlife doctrine==\n{{main|Afterlife}}\nMost Christians believe in the [[immortality of the soul]] and [[particular judgment]] and see the story as consistent with it, or even refer to it to establish these doctrines like [[Irenaeus of Lyons|St. Irenaeus]] did.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ante-Nicene_Fathers/Volume_I/IRENAEUS/Against_Heresies:_Book_II/Chapter_XXXIV.|title=Irenaeus.

By contrast, in all of the other parables Jesus refers to a central character by a description, such as \"a certain man\", \"a sower\", and so forth.<ref> For a review of ancient and contemporary interpretations of the name 'Lazarus', see  R.M. Bredenhof, \"Looking for Lazarus: Assigning Meaning to the Poor Man in Luke 16.19\u201331\", New Testament Studies 66 (2020), pp 51-67. </ref>. \n\nCritics of this view point out that \"The soul that sins, it shall die\" (Ezekiel 18); \"For dust you are and to dust you shall return\" (Genesis 3:19). [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] (1 Thessalonians 4:13\u201318) describes death as sleep until the Day of the Lord, when the dead will receive glorified bodies upon the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15). No scripture, other than Philippians 1:23\u201325 (in which the apostle expresses the confidence that on departure from this life he would be with Christ), 2 Corinthians 12:2\u20134 (in which he affirms the possibility of being taken to paradise out of the body), 2 Corinthians 5:8, etc., accounts for a disembodied soul and its comfort or torture. Because this seems to raise the question of what kind of body is tortured in Hades as depicted in Luke, there are those who maintain that whilst the conversations took place as described, the language used in them, referring to body parts, etc., was figurative.<ref name=\"Webpage\" />\n\n===As a parable created by Jesus===\nOther Christians consider that this is a parable created by Jesus and told to his followers.<ref>e.g. ''The IVP Bible Background Commentary''</ref> [[N. T. Wright|Tom Wright]]<ref>Wright T. ''Luke for Everyone'' \"doesn't add anything new to the general folk belief about fortunes being reversed in a future life.

Proponents of this view argue that the story of Lazarus and the rich man has much in common with other stories which are agreed-upon parables, both in language and content (e.g. the reversal of fortunes, the use of antithesis, and concern for the poor).\n\n====Jesus using parable against the High Priest====\nAccording to [[Josephus]], [[Caiaphas]] was appointed [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] in AD 18 by the Roman [[Judea (Roman province)|prefect]] who preceded [[Pontius Pilate]], [[Valerius Gratus]].<ref name=\"oxford\">Metzger & Coogan  ''Oxford Companion to the Bible'', 1993. p 97</ref>\n\nOne identification is that the man in torment in the parable is Caiaphas the High Priest. Caiaphas met the criteria Jesus gives in the parable to the identity of the Rich Man. He was rich, and as the high priest was dressed in purple and fine linen, he had five brothers, and was well versed in Moses and the Prophets, but according to Jesus, were ignoring what they wrote.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_lazarus.htm |title = The Rich Man,Lazarus, and Abraham}}</ref>\n\n====Luther: a parable of the conscience====\n[[Martin Luther]] taught that the story was a parable about rich and poor in this life and the details of the afterlife not to be taken literally:\n\n{{quote|Therefore we conclude that the bosom of Abraham signifies nothing else than the Word of God,&nbsp;... the hell here mentioned cannot be the true hell that will begin on the day of judgment. For the corpse of the rich man is without doubt not in hell, but buried in the earth; it must however be a place where the soul can be and has no peace, and it cannot be corporeal. Therefore it seems to me, this hell is the conscience, which is without faith and without the Word of God, in which the soul is buried and held until the day of judgment, when they are cast down body and soul into the true and real hell.

He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to [[2016 London mayoral election|2016]]. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, he identifies as a progressive [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008, he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty, Johnson oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip; he stepped down as mayor the following year, during which he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister.

It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

June 1964) is a British politician, writer, and former journalist, who has served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] since 2019. He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to [[2016 London mayoral election|2016]]. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, he identifies as a progressive [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008, he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty, Johnson oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip; he stepped down as mayor the following year, during which he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Avoid WP:RECENTISM-->\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nJohnson has been a controversial figure in British journalism and politics. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

{"title_page": "Web developer", "text_new": "{{for|the Mozilla extension|Web Developer (software)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=May 2013}}\n\nA '''web developer''' is a [[programmer]] who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of [[World Wide Web]] applications using a [[client\u2013server model]]. The applications typically use [[HTML]], [[CSS]] and [[JavaScript]] in the client, [[PHP]], [[ASP.NET]] ([[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]) or [[Java (programming language)|Java]] in the server, and [[http]] for communications between client and server. A [[web content management system]] is often used to develop and maintain web applications.\n\n== Nature of employment ==\n\nWeb developers are found working in various types of organizations, including large [[corporations]] and [[governments]], small and medium-sized [[companies]], or alone as [[freelancers]]. Some web developers work for one organization as a permanent [[Full-time job|full-time]] employee, while others may work as independent [[consultants]], or as contractors for an agency or at home personal use. Web developers typically handle both [[server-side]] and [[Front end development|front-end]] logic. This usually involves implementing all the visual elements that users see and use in the web applications or use, as well as all the web services that are necessary to power the usage of their developing work. Salaries vary depending on the type of development work, location, and level of seniority.\n\n== Type of work performed ==\n\nModern [[web application]]s often contain three or more [[multitier architecture|tier]]s, and depending on the size of the team a developer works on, he or she may specialize in one or more of these tiers - or may take a more [[interdisciplinary]] role. A web developer is usually classified as a [[Front-end web development]] or a Back-End Web Developer. For example, in a two-person team, one developer may focus on the technologies sent to the [[Client-side|client]] such as [[HTML]], [[JavaScript]], [[CSS]],  [[React (JavaScript library)|ReactJs]] or [[AngularJS]] and on the [[server-side]] frameworks (such as [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[PHP]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Active Server Pages|ASP]], [[ASP.NET]], [[Node.js]]) used to deliver content and scripts to the client. Meanwhile, the other developer might focus on the interaction between server-side frameworks, the [[webserver]], and a [[database]] system. Further, depending on the size of their organization, the aforementioned developers might work closely with a content creator/copywriter, marketing adviser, [[user experience design]]er, [[web designer]], [[web producer]], [[project manager]], [[software architect]], or [[database administrator]] - or they may be responsible for such tasks as [[web design]] and [[project management]] themselves.\n\n== Educational and licensure requirements ==\n\nThere are no formal educational or licensure requirements to become a web developer. However, many colleges and trade schools offer coursework in web development. There are also many tutorials and articles, which teach web development, freely available on the web - for example [[wikiversity: Basic JavaScript|Basic JavaScript]]\n\nEven though there are no formal educational requirements, dealing with web developing projects requires those who wish to be referred to as web developers to have advanced knowledge/skills in:\n* HTML/XHTML, [[Cascading_Style_Sheets|CSS]], JavaScript and jQuery.\n* [[server-side|Server]]/[[client-side|client]] side architecture like all or some of the above mentioned.  \n* Programming/Coding/Scripting in one of the many server-side languages or frameworks (e.g., [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[PHP]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[ColdFusion Markup Language|CFML - ColdFusion]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Active Server Pages|ASP]], [[ASP.NET]], [[Node.js]])\n* Ability to utilize a [[database]]\n* Creating [[single page application]] with use of front-end tools such as EmberJS,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://emberjs.com | title=EmberJS website | work=EmberJS }}</ref> ReactJS<ref>{{cite web | url=https://facebook.github.io/react/ | title=ReactJS website | work=ReactJS }}</ref> or AngularJS<ref>{{cite web | url=https://angularjs.org/ | title=AngularJS website | work=AngularJS }}</ref>Big Orange Planet<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bigorangeplanet.com/| title=Denver Web Design | work=Big Orange Planet}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Outline of web design and web development]]\n* [[Website design]]\n* [[Web development]]\n* [[Web engineering]]\n* [[Software developer]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiversity|Web design}}\n* The US Department of Labor's description of [http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm/ Web Developers]\n* [https://www.w3.org/ / World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)]\n\n[[Category:Web development]]\n[[Category:Computer occupations]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the Mozilla extension|Web Developer (software)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=May 2013}}\n\nA '''web developer''' is a [[programmer]] who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of [[World Wide Web]] applications using a [[client\u2013server model]].

(2011). Gamification by Design: Implementing game mechanics in web and mobile apps. Sebastopol: O'Reilly Media.</ref> They are typically rewarded for the successful accomplishment of specified activities within the gamified environment<ref name=\":5\">Werbach, K., & Hunter, D.

For the Win: How game thinking can revolutionize your business. Philadelphia: Wharton Digital Press.</ref> Various kinds of points can be differentiated between, e.g. experience points, redeemable points, or reputation points, as can the different purposes that points serve.<ref name=\":2\" /> One of the most important purposes of points is to provide feedback. Points allow the players' in-game behavior to be measured, and they serve as continuous and immediate feedback and as a reward.<ref>Sailer, M., Hense, J., Mandl, H., & Klevers, M. (2013). Psychological perspectives on motivation through gamification. Interaction Design and Architecture(s) Journal, 19, 28e37.</ref>\n\n=== Badges ===\nBadges are defined as visual representations of [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievement]]s<ref name=\":5\" /> and can be earned and collected within the gamification environment. They confirm the players' achievements, symbolize their merits,<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Ashton|last2=Huttenlocher|first2=Daniel|last3=Kleinberg|first3=Jon|last4=Leskovec|first4=Jure|date=2013|title=Steering user behavior with badges|url=https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/www13-badges.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web - WWW '13|language=en|location=Rio de Janeiro, Brazil|publisher=ACM Press|volume=|pages=95\u2013106|doi=10.1145/2488388.2488398|citeseerx=10.1.1.402.2444|isbn=9781450320351|via=}}</ref> and visibly show their accomplishment of levels or goals.<ref>Antin, J., & Churchill, E.

(2011). Game reward systems: gaming experiences and social meanings.

P., Wehbe, R. R., Robb, J., & Nacke, L. E. (2013). Time\u2019s Up: Studying Leadboards For Engaging Punctual Behaviour.

(2009). Designing social interfaces: Principles, patterns, and practices for improving the user experience. Sebastopol: O'Reilly Media, Inc.</ref> and are thus competitive indicators of progress that relate the player's own performance to the performance of others. However, the motivational potential of leaderboards is mixed. Werbach and Hunter<ref name=\":5\" /> regard them as effective motivators if there are only a few points left to the next level or position, but as demotivators, if players find themselves at the bottom end of the leaderboard. Competition caused by leaderboards can create social pressure to increase the player's level of engagement and can consequently have a constructive effect on participation and learning.<ref>Burguillo, J. C. (2010). Using game theory and Competition-based Learning to stimulate student motivation and performance. Computers & Education, 55(2), 566e575. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2010.02.018</nowiki>.</ref> However, these positive effects of competition are more likely if the respective competitors are approximately at the same performance level.<ref>Landers, R.

Unlike the social reference standard of leaderboards, performance graphs are based on an individual reference standard. By graphically displaying the player's performance over a fixed period, they focus on improvements. Motivation theory postulates that this fosters mastery orientation, which is particularly beneficial to learning.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Meaningful stories ===\nMeaningful stories are game design elements that do not relate to the player's performance. The narrative context in which a gamified application can be embedded contextualizes activities and characters in the game and gives them meaning beyond the mere quest for points and achievements.<ref name=\":7\">Kapp, K. M. (2012). The gamification of learning and instruction: Game-based methods and strategies for training and education. San Francisco: Pfeiffer.</ref> A story can be communicated by a game's title (e.g., [[Space Invaders]]) or by complex storylines typical of contemporary role-playing video games (e.g., [[The Elder Scrolls Series]]).<ref name=\":7\" /> Narrative contexts can be oriented towards real, non-game contexts or act as analogies of real-world settings. The latter can enrich boring, barely stimulating contexts, and, consequently, inspire and motivate players particularly if the story is in line with their personal interests.<ref>Nicholson, S. (2015). A RECIPE for meaningful gamification. In T. Reiners, & L. C. Wood (Eds.), Gamification in education and business (pp. 1e20). New York: Springer. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-10208-5_1</nowiki>.</ref> As such, stories are also an important part in gamification applications, as they can alter the meaning of real-world activities by adding a narrative \u2018overlay\u2019, e.g. being hunted by zombies while going for a run.\n\n=== Avatars ===\nAvatars are visual representations of players within the game or gamification environment.<ref name=\":5\" /> Usually, they are chosen or even created by the player.<ref name=\":7\" /> Avatars can be designed quite simply as a mere pictogram, or they can be complexly animated, three- dimensional representations. Their main formal requirement is that they unmistakably identify the players and set them apart from other human or computer-controlled avatars.<ref name=\":5\" /> Avatars allow the players to adopt or create another identity and, in cooperative games, to become part of a community.<ref>Annetta, L. A. (2010). The \"I's\" have it: A framework for serious educational game design. Review of General Psychology, 14(2), 105e112. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/</nowiki> a0018985.</ref>\n\n=== Teammates ===\nTeammates, whether they are other real players or virtual non-player characters, can induce conflict, competition or cooperation.<ref name=\":7\" /> The latter can be fostered particularly by introducing teams, i.e. by creating defined groups of players that work together towards a shared objective.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Applications ==\nGamification has been applied to almost every aspect of life. Examples of gamification in business context include the U.S. Army, which uses [[military simulator]] ''[[America's Army]]'' as a recruitment tool, and [[M&M's]] \"Eye Spy\" [[pretzel]] game, launched in 2013 to amplify the company's pretzel marketing campaign by creating a fun way to \"boost user engagement.\" Another example can be seen in the American education system. Students are ranked in their class based on their earned [[Grading in education|grade-point average]] (GPA), which is comparable to earning a high score in video games.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gamification in education and business|others=Reiners, Torsten,, Wood, Lincoln C.|isbn=9783319102085|location=Cham, Switzerland|oclc=899000643|last1 = Reiners|first1 = Torsten|last2 = Wood|first2 = Lincoln C.|date = 2014-11-22}}</ref> Students may also receive incentives, such as an honorable mention on the dean's list, the honor roll, and scholarships, which are equivalent to leveling-up a video game character or earning virtual currency or tools that augment game success. \nJob application processes sometimes use gamification as a way to hire employees by assessing their suitability through questionnaires and mini games that simulate the actual work environment of that company.\n\n=== Marketing ===\nGamification has been widely applied in marketing. Over 70% of [[Forbes Global 2000]] companies surveyed in 2013 said they planned to use gamification for the purposes of marketing and customer retention.<ref>{{cite web|last = Van Grove|first = Jennifer|title = Gamification: How Competition Is Reinventing Business, Marketing & Everyday Life|publisher = [[Mashable]]|date = 28 July 2011|url = http://mashable.com/2011/07/28/gamification/|accessdate = 12 February 2013}}</ref> For example, in November, 2011, Australian broadcast and online media partnership [[Yahoo!7]] launched its [[Yahoo!7#Fango mobile app|Fango mobile app]]/SAP, which TV viewers use to interact with shows via techniques like check-ins and badges. Gamification has also been used in customer loyalty programs. In 2010, [[Starbucks]] gave custom [[Foursquare City Guide|Foursquare]] badges to people who checked in at multiple locations, and offered discounts to people who checked in most frequently at an individual store.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/07/18/gamification-marketing/|title=HOW TO: Gamify Your Marketing|last=Kleinberg|first=Adam|date=18 July 2011|publisher=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref> As a general rule Gamification Marketing or Game Marketing usually falls under four primary categories;\n\n'''1. Brandification ([[in-game advertising]]):''' Messages, images or videos promoting a Brand, Product or Service within a game's visuals components. According to NBCNews game creators [[Electronic Arts]] used \"Madden 09\" and \"Burnout Paradise\" to promote 'in-game' billboards encouraging players to vote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27184857/ns/technology_and_science-games/t/ads-obama-campaign-its-game/#.W6HQHpMzafQ|title=Ads for Obama campaign: 'It's in the game'|date=2008-10-14}}</ref>\n\n'''2. Transmedia:''' The result of taking a media property and extending it into a different medium for both promotional and monetisation purposes. [[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|Nintendo's \"007: GoldenEye\"]] is a classic example. A video game created to advertise the originally titled movie. In the end, the promotional game brought in more money than the originally titled film.\n\n'''3. Through-the-line (TTL) & Below-the-line (BTL):''' Text above, side or below main game screen (also known as an iFrame) advertising images or text. Example of this would be [[I Love Bees|\"I love Bees\".]]\n\n'''4. Advergames:''' Usually games based-off popular mobile game templates, such as '[[Candy Crush Saga|Candy Crush]]' or '[[Temple Run|Temple Run']]. These games are then recreated via platforms like [[Wix.com|WIX]] with software from the likes of [[Gamify (company)|Gamify]], in order to promote Brands, Products and Services. Usually to encourage engagement, loyalty and product education. These usually involve social leaderboards and rewards that are advertised via social media platforms like Facebook's Top 10 games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2009/10/16/top-facebook-games/#dN8t18tfbiqW}}</ref>\n\nGamification also has been used as a tool for [[customer engagement]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/disciplines/market-research/opinion/businesses-need-to-get-in-the-game/3018554.article|publisher=Marketing Week|title=Businesses need to get in the game|first=Matt|last=Daniels|date=September 23, 2010 }}</ref> and for encouraging desirable website usage behaviour.<ref name=\"sjmn\">{{cite news|work=San Jose Mercury News|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_16401223|title=Get ready for the decade of gamification|first=Chris|last=O'Brien|date=October 24, 2010 }}</ref> Additionally, gamification is applicable to increasing engagement on sites built on [[social network service]]s. For example, in August, 2010, the website builder DevHub announced an increase in the number of users who completed their online tasks from 10% to 80% after adding gamification elements.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=VentureBeat|title=Website builder DevHub gets users hooked by \"gamifying\" its service|date=August 25, 2010|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/08/25/devhub-scores-engagement-increase-by-gamifying-its-web-site-creation-tools/ }}</ref> On the programming [[question-and-answer site]] [[Stack Overflow]] users receive points and/or badges for performing a variety of actions, including spreading links to questions and answers via [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. A large number of different badges are available, and when a user's [[reputation points]] exceed various thresholds, the user gains additional privileges, eventually including moderator privileges.\n\n=== Inspiration ===\nGamification can be used for ideation (structured [[brainstorming]] to produce new ideas). A study at [[MIT Sloan]] found that ideation games helped participants generate more and better ideas, and compared it to gauging the influence of academic papers by the numbers of citations received in subsequent research.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/vc/Ideationpaper022805.pdf|publisher=Marketing Science|title=Idea Generation, Creativity, and Incentives|first=Olivier|last=Toubia|date=October 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520204612/http://mitsloan.mit.edu/vc/Ideationpaper022805.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Health ===\n{{See also|Exergaming}}\nApplications like [[Fitocracy]] and [[QUENTIQ]] (Dacadoo) use gamification to encourage their users to exercise more effectively and improve their overall health. Users are awarded varying numbers of points for activities they perform in their workouts, and gain levels based on points collected.

For the Win: How game thinking can revolutionize your business. Philadelphia: Wharton Digital Press.</ref> Various kinds of points can be differentiated between, e.g. experience points, redeemable points, or reputation points, as can the different purposes that points serve.<ref name=\":2\" /> One of the most important purposes of points is to provide feedback. Points allow the players' in-game behavior to be measured, and they serve as continuous and immediate feedback and as a reward.<ref>Sailer, M., Hense, J., Mandl, H., & Klevers, M. (2013).

S., & Ryan, R. M. (2011). Glued to games: How video games draw us in and hold us spellbound.

P., Wehbe, R. R., Robb, J., & Nacke, L. E. (2013). Time\u2019s Up: Studying Leadboards For Engaging Punctual Behaviour.

(2009). Designing social interfaces: Principles, patterns, and practices for improving the user experience. Sebastopol: O'Reilly Media, Inc.</ref> and are thus competitive indicators of progress that relate the player's own performance to the performance of others. However, the motivational potential of leaderboards is mixed. Werbach and Hunter<ref name=\":5\" /> regard them as effective motivators if there are only a few points left to the next level or position, but as demotivators, if players find themselves at the bottom end of the leaderboard. Competition caused by leaderboards can create social pressure to increase the player's level of engagement and can consequently have a constructive effect on participation and learning.<ref>Burguillo, J. C. (2010). Using game theory and Competition-based Learning to stimulate student motivation and performance. Computers & Education, 55(2), 566e575. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2010.02.018</nowiki>.</ref> However, these positive effects of competition are more likely if the respective competitors are approximately at the same performance level.<ref>Landers, R.

Unlike the social reference standard of leaderboards, performance graphs are based on an individual reference standard. By graphically displaying the player's performance over a fixed period, they focus on improvements. Motivation theory postulates that this fosters mastery orientation, which is particularly beneficial to learning.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Meaningful stories ===\nMeaningful stories are game design elements that do not relate to the player's performance. The narrative context in which a gamified application can be embedded contextualizes activities and characters in the game and gives them meaning beyond the mere quest for points and achievements.<ref name=\":7\">Kapp, K. M. (2012). The gamification of learning and instruction: Game-based methods and strategies for training and education. San Francisco: Pfeiffer.</ref> A story can be communicated by a game's title (e.g., [[Space Invaders]]) or by complex storylines typical of contemporary role-playing video games (e.g., [[The Elder Scrolls Series]]).<ref name=\":7\" /> Narrative contexts can be oriented towards real, non-game contexts or act as analogies of real-world settings. The latter can enrich boring, barely stimulating contexts, and, consequently, inspire and motivate players particularly if the story is in line with their personal interests.<ref>Nicholson, S. (2015). A RECIPE for meaningful gamification. In T. Reiners, & L. C. Wood (Eds.), Gamification in education and business (pp. 1e20). New York: Springer. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-10208-5_1</nowiki>.</ref> As such, stories are also an important part in gamification applications, as they can alter the meaning of real-world activities by adding a narrative \u2018overlay\u2019, e.g. being hunted by zombies while going for a run.\n\n=== Avatars ===\nAvatars are visual representations of players within the game or gamification environment.<ref name=\":5\" /> Usually, they are chosen or even created by the player.<ref name=\":7\" /> Avatars can be designed quite simply as a mere pictogram, or they can be complexly animated, three- dimensional representations. Their main formal requirement is that they unmistakably identify the players and set them apart from other human or computer-controlled avatars.<ref name=\":5\" /> Avatars allow the players to adopt or create another identity and, in cooperative games, to become part of a community.<ref>Annetta, L. A. (2010). The \"I's\" have it: A framework for serious educational game design. Review of General Psychology, 14(2), 105e112. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/</nowiki> a0018985.</ref>\n\n=== Teammates ===\nTeammates, whether they are other real players or virtual non-player characters, can induce conflict, competition or cooperation.<ref name=\":7\" /> The latter can be fostered particularly by introducing teams, i.e. by creating defined groups of players that work together towards a shared objective.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Applications ==\nGamification has been applied to almost every aspect of life. Examples of gamification in business context include the U.S. Army, which uses [[military simulator]] ''[[America's Army]]'' as a recruitment tool, and [[M&M's]] \"Eye Spy\" [[pretzel]] game, launched in 2013 to amplify the company's pretzel marketing campaign by creating a fun way to \"boost user engagement.\" Another example can be seen in the American education system. Students are ranked in their class based on their earned [[Grading in education|grade-point average]] (GPA), which is comparable to earning a high score in video games.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gamification in education and business|others=Reiners, Torsten,, Wood, Lincoln C.|isbn=9783319102085|location=Cham, Switzerland|oclc=899000643|last1 = Reiners|first1 = Torsten|last2 = Wood|first2 = Lincoln C.|date = 2014-11-22}}</ref> Students may also receive incentives, such as an honorable mention on the dean's list, the honor roll, and scholarships, which are equivalent to leveling-up a video game character or earning virtual currency or tools that augment game success. \nJob application processes sometimes use gamification as a way to hire employees by assessing their suitability through questionnaires and mini games that simulate the actual work environment of that company.\n\n=== Marketing ===\nGamification has been widely applied in marketing. Over 70% of [[Forbes Global 2000]] companies surveyed in 2013 said they planned to use gamification for the purposes of marketing and customer retention.<ref>{{cite web|last = Van Grove|first = Jennifer|title = Gamification: How Competition Is Reinventing Business, Marketing & Everyday Life|publisher = [[Mashable]]|date = 28 July 2011|url = http://mashable.com/2011/07/28/gamification/|accessdate = 12 February 2013}}</ref> For example, in November, 2011, Australian broadcast and online media partnership [[Yahoo!7]] launched its [[Yahoo!7#Fango mobile app|Fango mobile app]]/SAP, which TV viewers use to interact with shows via techniques like check-ins and badges. Gamification has also been used in customer loyalty programs. In 2010, [[Starbucks]] gave custom [[Foursquare City Guide|Foursquare]] badges to people who checked in at multiple locations, and offered discounts to people who checked in most frequently at an individual store.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/07/18/gamification-marketing/|title=HOW TO: Gamify Your Marketing|last=Kleinberg|first=Adam|date=18 July 2011|publisher=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref> As a general rule Gamification Marketing or Game Marketing usually falls under four primary categories;\n\n'''1. Brandification ([[in-game advertising]]):''' Messages, images or videos promoting a Brand, Product or Service within a game's visuals components. According to NBCNews game creators [[Electronic Arts]] used \"Madden 09\" and \"Burnout Paradise\" to promote 'in-game' billboards encouraging players to vote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27184857/ns/technology_and_science-games/t/ads-obama-campaign-its-game/#.W6HQHpMzafQ|title=Ads for Obama campaign: 'It's in the game'|date=2008-10-14}}</ref>\n\n'''2. Transmedia:''' The result of taking a media property and extending it into a different medium for both promotional and monetisation purposes. [[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|Nintendo's \"007: GoldenEye\"]] is a classic example. A video game created to advertise the originally titled movie.

It showed a population figure of 170.6 million people, manipulated so as to match the numbers stated by Joseph Stalin in his report to the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party that March.

A 2008 letter from Russian president [[Dmitry Medvedev]] to Ukrainian president [[Viktor Yushchenko]] asserted that the famine \"was not targeted at extermination of any single nation\", and accused Ukraine of exploiting it for political ends.<ref>{{cite news|title=Medvedev slams Ukraine's Great Famine stunt|url=https://www.rt.com/news/medvedev-slams-ukraines-great-famine-stunt/|accessdate=1 October 2016|work=RT|date=14 November 2008}}</ref> In November 2010 a leaked confidential U.S. diplomatic cable revealed that Russia had allegedly pressured its neighbors not to support the designation of the Holodomor as a genocide at the United Nations.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08BISHKEK1095_a.html|title=Candid discussion with Prince Andrew on the Kyrgyz economy and the 'Great Game'|date=November 2010|publisher=[[WikiLeaks]]|quote=He [Prince Andrew, Duke of York] stated the following story related to him recently by Azerbaijan's President Aliyev.

The pamphlet claimed that Ukrainian Nationalists and the US government were responsible for creating the \"myth.\" Russian publicist [[Yury Mukhin (author)|Yuri Mukhin]] has a published a book titled \"''Hysterical Women of the Holodomor''\", dismissing Holodomor as \"Russophobia\" and \"a trump card of  the Ukrainian Nazis.\" Sigizmund Mironin's \"''Holodomor in the Rus''\" argued that the cause of the famine was not Stalin's policies, but rather the chaos engendered by the [[New Economic Policy]].{{r|Dobczansky_2009}}\n\nRussian state media ran several articles denying the severity and causes of the Ukrainian famine.{{r|Young}}\n\n===Ukrainian law===\nOn November 28, 2006, Ukraine's parliament, the [[Verkhovna Rada]], passed a law recognizing the 1932&ndash;1933 Holodomor as an act of genocide against  the Ukrainian people. The voting figures were as follows: supporting the bill were [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc|BYuT]]\u2014118 deputies, [[Our Ukraine (political party)|NSNU]]\u201479 deputies, [[Socialist Party of Ukraine|Socialists]]\u201430 deputies, 4 independent deputies, and the [[Party of Regions]]\u20142 deputies (200 deputies did not cast a vote). The [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] voted against the bill.  In all, 233 deputies supported the bill\u2014more than the minimum of 226 votes required to pass it into law.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110404031008/http://www.day.kiev.ua/179841 \"Holodomor and Holocaust denial to be a criminal offense\"], 3 April 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.lucorg.com/news.php/news/2241 \"What the Verkhovna Rada actually passed\"], 28 February 2007</ref>\n\nA draft law \"On Amendments to the Criminal and the Procedural Criminal Codes of Ukraine\" was submitted by [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]] for consideration by the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian Parliament]].

From their homelands near the [[Aral Sea]], the Seljuks advanced first into [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and then into mainland [[Persia]], before eventually capturing [[Baghdad]] and conquering eastern Anatolia. Here the Seljuks won the [[battle of Manzikert]] in 1071 and conquered most of Anatolia from the [[Byzantine Empire]], which became one of the reasons for the [[first crusade]] (1095-1099). From c. 1150-1250, the Seljuk empire declined, and was invaded by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] around 1260. The Mongols divided Anatolia into [[emirate]]s. Eventually one of these, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], would conquer the rest.\n\n[[Seljuk (warlord)|Seljuk]] gave his name to both the empire and the [[Seljuk dynasty]]. The Seljuks united the fractured political landscape of the eastern [[Islamic world]] and played a key role in the first and [[Second Crusade|second]] crusades.

The process of Persianization accelerated in the thirteenth century with the presence in Konya of two of the most distinguished refugees fleeing before the Mongols, Bah\u0101' al-D\u012bn Walad and his son Mawl\u0101n\u0101 Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn R\u016bm\u012b, whose ''Mathnaw\u012b'', composed in Konya, constitutes one of the crowning glories of classical Persian literature.\"\n* Mehmed Fuad K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc, \"Early Mystics in Turkish Literature\", Translated by Gary Leiser and Robert Dankoff, Routledge, 2006, p. 149: \"If we wish to sketch, in broad outline, the civilization created by the Seljuks of Anatolia, we must recognize that the local\u2014i.e., non-Muslim, element was fairly insignificant compared to the Turkish and Arab-Persian elements, and that the Persian element was paramount. The Seljuk rulers, to be sure, who were in contact with not only Muslim Persian civilization, but also with the Arab civilizations in al-jazlra and Syria\u2014indeed, with all Muslim peoples as far as India\u2014also had connections with {various} Byzantine courts. Some of these rulers, like the great 'Ala' al-Dln Kai-Qubad I himself, who married Byzantine princesses and thus strengthened relations with their neighbors to the west, lived for many years in Byzantium and became very familiar with the customs and ceremonial at the Byzantine court. Still, this close contact with the ancient Greco-Roman and Christian traditions only resulted in their adoption of a policy of tolerance toward art, aesthetic life, painting, music, independent thought\u2014in short, toward those things that were frowned upon by the narrow and piously ascetic views {of their subjects}. The contact of the common people with the Greeks and Armenians had basically the same result. [Before coming to Anatolia,] the Turkmens had been in contact with many nations and had long shown their ability to synthesize the artistic elements that thev had adopted from these nations. When they settled in Anatolia, they encountered peoples with whom they had not yet been in contact and immediately established relations with them as well. Ala al-Din Kai-Qubad I established ties with the Genoese and, especially, the Venetians at the ports of Sinop and Antalya, which belonged to him, and granted them commercial and legal concessions. Meanwhile, the Mongol invasion, which caused a great number of scholars and artisans to flee from Turkmenistan, Iran, and Khwarazm and settle within the Empire of the Seljuks of Anatolia, resulted in a reinforcing of Persian influence on the Anatolian Turks. Indeed, despite all claims to the contrary, there is no question that Persian influence was paramount among the Seljuks of Anatolia. This is clearly revealed by the fact that the sultans who ascended the throne after Ghiyath al-Din Kai-Khusraw I assumed titles taken from ancient Persian mythology, like Kai-Khusraw, Kai-Ka us, and Kai-Qubad; and that. Ala' al-Din Kai-Qubad I had some passages from the Shahname inscribed on the walls of Konya and Sivas. When we take into consideration domestic life in the Konya courts and the sincerity of the favor and attachment of the rulers to Persian poets and Persian literature, then this fact [i.e., the importance of Persian influence] is undeniable. With regard to the private lives of the rulers, their amusements, and palace ceremonial, the most definite influence was also that of Iran, mixed with the early Turkish traditions, and not that of Byzantium.\"\n* Stephen P.

Golden. Otto Harrasowitz, 1992). pg 386: \"Turkic penetration probably began in the Hunnic era and its aftermath. Steady pressure from Turkic nomads was typical of the Khazar era, although there are no unambiguous references to permanent settlements. These most certainly occurred with the arrival of the Oguz in the 11th century. The Turkicization of much of Azarbayjan, according to Soviet scholars, was completed largely during the Ilxanid period if not by late Seljuk times. Sumer, placing a slightly different emphasis on the data (more correct in my view), posts three periods which Turkicization took place: Seljuk, Mongol and Post-Mongol (Qara Qoyunlu, Aq Qoyunlu and Safavid). In the first two, Oguz Turkic tribes advanced or were driven to the western frontiers (Anatolia) and Northern Azarbaijan (Arran, the Mugan steppe). In the last period, the Turkic elements in Iran (derived from Oguz, with lesser admixture of Uygur, Qipchaq, Qaluq and other Turks brought to Iran during the Chinggisid era, as well as Turkicized Mongols) were joined now by Anatolian Turks migrating back to Iran. This marked the final stage of Turkicization. Although there is some evidence for the presence of Qipchaqs among the Turkic tribes coming to this region, there is little doubt that the critical mass which brought about this linguistic shift was provided by the same Oguz-Turkmen tribes that had come to Anatolia. The Azeris of today are an overwhelmingly sedentary, detribalized people. Anthropologically, they are little distinguished from the Iranian neighbors.\"\n* John Perry: \"We should distinguish two complementary ways in which the advent of the Turks affected the language map of Iran. First, since the Turkish-speaking rulers of most Iranian polities from the Ghaznavids and Seljuks onward were already Iranized and patronized Persian literature in their domains, the expansion of Turk-ruled empires served to expand the territorial domain of written Persian into the conquered areas, notably Anatolia and Central and South Asia. Secondly, the influx of massive Turkish-speaking populations (culminating with the rank and file of the Mongol armies) and their settlement in large areas of Iran (particularly in Azerbaijan and the northwest), progressively turkicized local speakers of Persian, Kurdish and other Iranian languages\"\n(John Perry. \"The Historical Role of Turkish in Relation to Persian of Iran\". ''Iran & the Caucasus'', Vol. 5, (2001), pp. 193\u2013200.)\n* According to C.E. Bosworth:\n\"The eastern Caucasus came under Saljuq control in the middle years of the 5th/11th century, and in c. 468/1075-56 Sultan Alp Arsl\u0101n sent his slave commander \u02bfEm\u0101d-al-d\u012bn Savtigin as governor of Azerbaijan and Arr\u0101n, displacing the last Shaddadids. From this period begins the increasing Turkicization of Arr\u0101n, under the Saljuqs and then under the line of Eldig\u00fczid or Ilde\u00f1izid Atabegs, who had to defend eastern Transcaucasia against the attacks of the resurgent Georgian kings. The influx of Oghuz and other T\u00fcrkmens was accentuated by the Mongol invasions. Barda\u02bfa had never revived fully after the R\u016bs sacking, and is little mentioned in the sources.\"\n(C.E. Bsowrth, Arran in ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica'')\n* According to Fridrik Thordarson:\n\"Iranian influence on Caucasian languages. There is general agreement that Iranian languages predominated in Azerbaijan from the 1st millennium b.c. until the advent of the Turks in a.d. the 11th century (see Menges, pp. 41\u201342; Camb. Hist. Iran IV, pp. 226\u2013228, and VI, pp. 950\u2013952).

His nephew, the son of Muhammad I, did not recognize his claim to the throne, and [[Mahmud II of Seljuq|Mahmud II]] proclaimed himself Sultan and established a capital in Baghdad, until 1131 when he was finally officially deposed by Ahmad Sanjar.\n\nElsewhere in nominal Seljuq territory were the [[Artuqids]] in northeastern Syria and northern [[Mesopotamia]]; they controlled [[Jerusalem]] until 1098. The [[Danishmend|D\u0101ni\u0161mand]] dynasty founded a state in eastern Anatolia and northern Syria and contested land with the [[Sultanate of Rum]], and [[Kerbogha]] exercised independence as the [[atabeg]] of [[Mosul]].\n\n== First Crusade (1095-1099) ==\n{{Main|First Crusade|Georgian\u2013Seljuk wars}}\n\nDuring the [[First Crusade]], the fractured states of the Seljuqs were generally more concerned with consolidating their own territories and gaining control of their neighbours than with cooperating against the [[crusade]]rs. The Seljuqs easily defeated the [[People's Crusade]] arriving in 1096, but they could not stop the progress of the army of the subsequent [[Princes' Crusade]], which took important cities such as [[Nicaea]] ([[\u0130znik]]), [[Iconium]] ([[Konya]]), [[Caesarea Mazaca]] ([[Kayseri]]), and [[Antioch]] ([[Antakya]]) on its march to [[Jerusalem]] ([[Al-Quds]]). In 1099 the crusaders finally captured the [[Holy Land]] and set up the first [[Crusader states]]. The Seljuqs had already lost [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to the [[Fatimid]]s, who had recaptured it just before its capture by the crusaders.\n\n\n\nAfter pillaging the [[County of Edessa]], Seljuqid commander [[Ilghazi]] made peace with the Crusaders. In 1121 he went north towards Georgia and with supposedly up to 250 000 - 350 000 troops, including men led by his son-in-law Sadaqah and Sultan Malik of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], he invaded the [[Kingdom of Georgia]].<ref name=\"armchairgeneral.com\">{{cite web |url = http://www.armchairgeneral.com/miraculous-victory-battle-of-didgori-1121.htm/2 |title='Miraculous Victory:' Battle of Didgori, 1121 |last=Mikaberidze|first=Alexander|date=|publisher=Armchair General|access-date=2012-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=AOyJtA0dYVUC |page=47 }}|title=Nomads in the Sedentary World|author=Anatol Khazanov|date=|access-date=2012-10-20 }}</ref> [[David IV of Georgia]] gathered 40,000 Georgian warriors, including 5,000 [[monaspa]] guards, 15,000 [[Kipchaks]], 300 Alans and 100 French Crusaders to fight against [[Ilghazi]]'s vast army. The [[Battle of Didgori]] was fought between the armies of the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] and the Seljuk Empire, on August 12, 1121. As a result, the Seljuks were routed and fled from the battlefield, being run down by pursuing Georgian cavalry for several days. The Didgori battle helped the Crusader states, which had been under the pressure of Ilghazi's armies. The weakening of the main enemy of the Latin principalities was beneficial for the Kingdom of Jerusalem under King [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]].\n\n== Second Crusade (1147-1149) ==\n{{See also|Second Crusade|Zengid dynasty|Nur ad-Din Zangi}}\nDuring this time conflict with the [[Crusader states]] was also intermittent, and after the First Crusade increasingly independent atabegs would frequently ally with the Crusader states against other atabegs as they vied with each other for territory. At Mosul, [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]] succeeded [[Kerbogha]] as atabeg and successfully began the process of consolidating the atabegs of Syria. In 1144 Zengi captured [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|Edessa]], as the [[County of Edessa]] had allied itself with the [[Artuqids]] against him. This event triggered the launch of the Second Crusade. [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], one of Zengi's sons who succeeded him as atabeg of [[Aleppo]], created an alliance in the region to oppose the Second Crusade, which landed in 1147.\n\n== Decline ==\n[[Ahmad Sanjar]] fought to contain the revolts by the [[Kara-Khanid]]s in [[Transoxiana]], [[Ghurid]]s in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Qarluk]]s in modern [[Kyrghyzstan]], as well as the nomadic invasion of the [[Kara-Khitai]]s in the east. The advancing Kara-Khitais first defeated the Eastern Kara-Khanids, then followed up by crushing the Western Kara-Khanids, who were vassals of the Seljuqs at [[Khujand]]. The Kara-Khanids turned to their overlord the Seljuqs for assistance, to which Sanjar responded by personally leading an army against the Kara-Khitai. However, Sanjar's army was decisively defeated by the host of [[Yelu Dashi]] at the [[Battle of Qatwan]] on September 9, 1141. While Sanjar managed to escape with his life, many of his close kin including his wife were taken captive in the battle's aftermath. As a result of Sanjar's failure to deal with the encroaching threat from the east, the Seljuq Empire lost all its eastern provinces up to the river [[Syr Darya]], and vassalage of the Western Kara-Khanids was usurped by the Kara-Khitai, otherwise known as the Western Liao in Chinese historiography.<ref>Biran, Michel, ''The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History'', (Cambridge University Press, 2005), 44.</ref>\n\n== Conquest by Khwarezm and the Ayyubids ==\n{{See also|Saladin|Ayyubids|Khwarezmid Empire}}\nIn 1153, the [[Ghuzz]] (Oghuz Turks) rebelled and captured Sanjar. He managed to escape after three years but died a year later. The atabegs, such as [[Zengids]] and [[Artuqids]], were only nominally under the Seljuk Sultan, and generally controlled Syria independently. When [[Ahmad Sanjar]] died in 1157, this fractured the empire even further and rendered the atabegs effectively independent.\n\n# Khorasani Seljuqs in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and Transoxiana.

In time, Saladin rebelled against [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], and, upon his death, Saladin married his widow and captured most of Syria and created the [[Ayyubid]] dynasty.\n\nOn other fronts, the [[Georgia (country)#Antiquity|Kingdom of Georgia]] began to become a regional power and extended its borders at the expense of Great Seljuk. The same was true during the revival of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] under [[Leo II of Armenia]] in Anatolia. The [[Abbasid]] caliph [[An-Nasir]] also began to reassert the authority of the caliph and allied himself with the Khwarezmshah [[Takash]].\n\nFor a brief period, [[Toghrul III of Seljuq|Togrul III]] was the Sultan of all Seljuq except for Anatolia. In 1194, however, Togrul was defeated by [[Takash]], the Shah of [[Khwarezmid Empire]], and the Seljuq Empire finally collapsed. Of the former Seljuq Empire, only the [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] in [[Anatolia]] remained.\n\nAs the dynasty declined in the middle of the thirteenth century, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] invaded [[Mongol invasions of Anatolia|Anatolia]] in the 1260s and divided it into small [[emirate]]s called the [[Anatolian beyliks]]. Eventually one of these, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], would rise to power and conquer the rest.\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Seljuqs were educated in the service of Muslim courts as slaves or mercenaries. The dynasty brought revival, energy, and reunion to the Islamic civilization hitherto dominated by Arabs and Persians.\n\nThe Seljuqs founded universities and were also patrons of art and literature. Their reign is characterized by [[Persian people|Persian]] astronomers such as [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]], and the [[Persian people|Persian]] philosopher [[al-Ghazali]]. Under the Seljuqs, [[New Persian]] became the language for historical recording, while the center of Arabic language culture shifted from Baghdad to [[Cairo]].<ref>Andre Wink, ''Al-Hind: The Making of

From their homelands near the [[Aral Sea]], the Seljuks advanced first into [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and then into mainland [[Persia]], before eventually capturing [[Baghdad]] and conquering eastern Anatolia. Here the Seljuks won the [[battle of Manzikert]] in 1071 and conquered most of Anatolia from the [[Byzantine Empire]], which became one of the reasons for the [[first crusade]] (1095-1099). From c. 1150-1250, the Seljuk empire declined, and was invaded by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] around 1260. The Mongols divided Anatolia into [[emirate]]s. Eventually one of these, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], would conquer the rest.\n\n[[Seljuk (warlord)|Seljuk]] gave his name to both the empire and the [[Seljuk dynasty]]. The Seljuks united the fractured political landscape of the eastern [[Islamic world]] and played a key role in the first and [[Second Crusade|second]] crusades.

The Seljuk rulers, to be sure, who were in contact with not only Muslim Persian civilization, but also with the Arab civilizations in al-jazlra and Syria\u2014indeed, with all Muslim peoples as far as India\u2014also had connections with {various} Byzantine courts. Some of these rulers, like the great 'Ala' al-Dln Kai-Qubad I himself, who married Byzantine princesses and thus strengthened relations with their neighbors to the west, lived for many years in Byzantium and became very familiar with the customs and ceremonial at the Byzantine court. Still, this close contact with the ancient Greco-Roman and Christian traditions only resulted in their adoption of a policy of tolerance toward art, aesthetic life, painting, music, independent thought\u2014in short, toward those things that were frowned upon by the narrow and piously ascetic views {of their subjects}. The contact of the common people with the Greeks and Armenians had basically the same result. [Before coming to Anatolia,] the Turkmens had been in contact with many nations and had long shown their ability to synthesize the artistic elements that thev had adopted from these nations. When they settled in Anatolia, they encountered peoples with whom they had not yet been in contact and immediately established relations with them as well. Ala al-Din Kai-Qubad I established ties with the Genoese and, especially, the Venetians at the ports of Sinop and Antalya, which belonged to him, and granted them commercial and legal concessions. Meanwhile, the Mongol invasion, which caused a great number of scholars and artisans to flee from Turkmenistan, Iran, and Khwarazm and settle within the Empire of the Seljuks of Anatolia, resulted in a reinforcing of Persian influence on the Anatolian Turks. Indeed, despite all claims to the contrary, there is no question that Persian influence was paramount among the Seljuks of Anatolia. This is clearly revealed by the fact that the sultans who ascended the throne after Ghiyath al-Din Kai-Khusraw I assumed titles taken from ancient Persian mythology, like Kai-Khusraw, Kai-Ka us, and Kai-Qubad; and that. Ala' al-Din Kai-Qubad I had some passages from the Shahname inscribed on the walls of Konya and Sivas. When we take into consideration domestic life in the Konya courts and the sincerity of the favor and attachment of the rulers to Persian poets and Persian literature, then this fact [i.e., the importance of Persian influence] is undeniable. With regard to the private lives of the rulers, their amusements, and palace ceremonial, the most definite influence was also that of Iran, mixed with the early Turkish traditions, and not that of Byzantium.\"\n* Stephen P.

Steady pressure from Turkic nomads was typical of the Khazar era, although there are no unambiguous references to permanent settlements. These most certainly occurred with the arrival of the Oguz in the 11th century. The Turkicization of much of Azarbayjan, according to Soviet scholars, was completed largely during the Ilxanid period if not by late Seljuk times. Sumer, placing a slightly different emphasis on the data (more correct in my view), posts three periods which Turkicization took place: Seljuk, Mongol and Post-Mongol (Qara Qoyunlu, Aq Qoyunlu and Safavid). In the first two, Oguz Turkic tribes advanced or were driven to the western frontiers (Anatolia) and Northern Azarbaijan (Arran, the Mugan steppe). In the last period, the Turkic elements in Iran (derived from Oguz, with lesser admixture of Uygur, Qipchaq, Qaluq and other Turks brought to Iran during the Chinggisid era, as well as Turkicized Mongols) were joined now by Anatolian Turks migrating back to Iran. This marked the final stage of Turkicization. Although there is some evidence for the presence of Qipchaqs among the Turkic tribes coming to this region, there is little doubt that the critical mass which brought about this linguistic shift was provided by the same Oguz-Turkmen tribes that had come to Anatolia. The Azeris of today are an overwhelmingly sedentary, detribalized people. Anthropologically, they are little distinguished from the Iranian neighbors.\"\n* John Perry: \"We should distinguish two complementary ways in which the advent of the Turks affected the language map of Iran. First, since the Turkish-speaking rulers of most Iranian polities from the Ghaznavids and Seljuks onward were already Iranized and patronized Persian literature in their domains, the expansion of Turk-ruled empires served to expand the territorial domain of written Persian into the conquered areas, notably Anatolia and Central and South Asia. Secondly, the influx of massive Turkish-speaking populations (culminating with the rank and file of the Mongol armies) and their settlement in large areas of Iran (particularly in Azerbaijan and the northwest), progressively turkicized local speakers of Persian, Kurdish and other Iranian languages\"\n(John Perry. \"The Historical Role of Turkish in Relation to Persian of Iran\". ''Iran & the Caucasus'', Vol. 5, (2001), pp. 193\u2013200.)\n* According to C.E. Bosworth:\n\"The eastern Caucasus came under Saljuq control in the middle years of the 5th/11th century, and in c. 468/1075-56 Sultan Alp Arsl\u0101n sent his slave commander \u02bfEm\u0101d-al-d\u012bn Savtigin as governor of Azerbaijan and Arr\u0101n, displacing the last Shaddadids. From this period begins the increasing Turkicization of Arr\u0101n, under the Saljuqs and then under the line of Eldig\u00fczid or Ilde\u00f1izid Atabegs, who had to defend eastern Transcaucasia against the attacks of the resurgent Georgian kings. The influx of Oghuz and other T\u00fcrkmens was accentuated by the Mongol invasions. Barda\u02bfa had never revived fully after the R\u016bs sacking, and is little mentioned in the sources.\"\n(C.E. Bsowrth, Arran in ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica'')\n* According to Fridrik Thordarson:\n\"Iranian influence on Caucasian languages. There is general agreement that Iranian languages predominated in Azerbaijan from the 1st millennium b.c. until the advent of the Turks in a.d. the 11th century (see Menges, pp. 41\u201342; Camb. Hist. Iran IV, pp. 226\u2013228, and VI, pp. 950\u2013952).

In [[Persia]] he was succeeded by his son [[Nasir ad-Din Mahmud I|Mahmud I]], whose reign was contested by his other three brothers [[Barkiyaruq]] in [[Iraq]], Muhammad I in [[Baghdad]], and [[Ahmed Sanjar|Ahmad Sanjar]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. When Tutush I died, his sons [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan|Radwan]] and [[Duqaq (Seljuk ruler of Damascus)|Duqaq]] inherited [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] respectively and contested with each other as well, further dividing Syria amongst emirs antagonistic towards each other.\n\nIn 1118, the third son [[Ahmed Sanjar|Ahmad Sanjar]] took over the empire. His nephew, the son of Muhammad I, did not recognize his claim to the throne, and [[Mahmud II of Seljuq|Mahmud II]] proclaimed himself Sultan and established a capital in Baghdad, until 1131 when he was finally officially deposed by Ahmad Sanjar.\n\nElsewhere in nominal Seljuq territory were the [[Artuqids]] in northeastern Syria and northern [[Mesopotamia]]; they controlled [[Jerusalem]] until 1098. The [[Danishmend|D\u0101ni\u0161mand]] dynasty founded a state in eastern Anatolia and northern Syria and contested land with the [[Sultanate of Rum]], and [[Kerbogha]] exercised independence as the [[atabeg]] of [[Mosul]].\n\n== First Crusade (1095-1099) ==\n{{Main|First Crusade|Georgian\u2013Seljuk wars}}\n\nDuring the [[First Crusade]], the fractured states of the Seljuqs were generally more concerned with consolidating their own territories and gaining control of their neighbours than with cooperating against the [[crusade]]rs. The Seljuqs easily defeated the [[People's Crusade]] arriving in 1096, but they could not stop the progress of the army of the subsequent [[Princes' Crusade]], which took important cities such as [[Nicaea]] ([[\u0130znik]]), [[Iconium]] ([[Konya]]), [[Caesarea Mazaca]] ([[Kayseri]]), and [[Antioch]] ([[Antakya]]) on its march to [[Jerusalem]] ([[Al-Quds]]). In 1099 the crusaders finally captured the [[Holy Land]] and set up the first [[Crusader states]]. The Seljuqs had already lost [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to the [[Fatimid]]s, who had recaptured it just before its capture by the crusaders.\n\n\n\nAfter pillaging the [[County of Edessa]], Seljuqid commander [[Ilghazi]] made peace with the Crusaders. In 1121 he went north towards Georgia and with supposedly up to 250 000 - 350 000 troops, including men led by his son-in-law Sadaqah and Sultan Malik of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], he invaded the [[Kingdom of Georgia]].<ref name=\"armchairgeneral.com\">{{cite web |url = http://www.armchairgeneral.com/miraculous-victory-battle-of-didgori-1121.htm/2 |title='Miraculous Victory:' Battle of Didgori, 1121 |last=Mikaberidze|first=Alexander|date=|publisher=Armchair General|access-date=2012-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=AOyJtA0dYVUC |page=47 }}|title=Nomads in the Sedentary World|author=Anatol Khazanov|date=|access-date=2012-10-20 }}</ref> [[David IV of Georgia]] gathered 40,000 Georgian warriors, including 5,000 [[monaspa]] guards, 15,000 [[Kipchaks]], 300 Alans and 100 French Crusaders to fight against [[Ilghazi]]'s vast army. The [[Battle of Didgori]] was fought between the armies of the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] and the Seljuk Empire, on August 12, 1121. As a result, the Seljuks were routed and fled from the battlefield, being run down by pursuing Georgian cavalry for several days. The Didgori battle helped the Crusader states, which had been under the pressure of Ilghazi's armies. The weakening of the main enemy of the Latin principalities was beneficial for the Kingdom of Jerusalem under King [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]].\n\n== Second Crusade (1147-1149) ==\n{{See also|Second Crusade|Zengid dynasty|Nur ad-Din Zangi}}\nDuring this time conflict with the [[Crusader states]] was also intermittent, and after the First Crusade increasingly independent atabegs would frequently ally with the Crusader states against other atabegs as they vied with each other for territory. At Mosul, [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]] succeeded [[Kerbogha]] as atabeg and successfully began the process of consolidating the atabegs of Syria. In 1144 Zengi captured [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|Edessa]], as the [[County of Edessa]] had allied itself with the [[Artuqids]] against him. This event triggered the launch of the Second Crusade. [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], one of Zengi's sons who succeeded him as atabeg of [[Aleppo]], created an alliance in the region to oppose the Second Crusade, which landed in 1147.\n\n== Decline ==\n[[Ahmad Sanjar]] fought to contain the revolts by the [[Kara-Khanid]]s in [[Transoxiana]], [[Ghurid]]s in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Qarluk]]s in modern [[Kyrghyzstan]], as well as the nomadic invasion of the [[Kara-Khitai]]s in the east. The advancing Kara-Khitais first defeated the Eastern Kara-Khanids, then followed up by crushing the Western Kara-Khanids, who were vassals of the Seljuqs at [[Khujand]]. The Kara-Khanids turned to their overlord the Seljuqs for assistance, to which Sanjar responded by personally leading an army against the Kara-Khitai. However, Sanjar's army was decisively defeated by the host of [[Yelu Dashi]] at the [[Battle of Qatwan]] on September 9, 1141. While Sanjar managed to escape with his life, many of his close kin including his wife were taken captive in the battle's aftermath. As a result of Sanjar's failure to deal with the encroaching threat from the east, the Seljuq Empire lost all its eastern provinces up to the river [[Syr Darya]], and vassalage of the Western Kara-Khanids was usurped by the Kara-Khitai, otherwise known as the Western Liao in Chinese historiography.<ref>Biran, Michel, ''The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History'', (Cambridge University Press, 2005), 44.</ref>\n\n== Conquest by Khwarezm and the Ayyubids ==\n{{See also|Saladin|Ayyubids|Khwarezmid Empire}}\nIn 1153, the [[Ghuzz]] (Oghuz Turks) rebelled and captured Sanjar.

The atabegs, such as [[Zengids]] and [[Artuqids]], were only nominally under the Seljuk Sultan, and generally controlled Syria independently. When [[Ahmad Sanjar]] died in 1157, this fractured the empire even further and rendered the atabegs effectively independent.\n\n# Khorasani Seljuqs in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and Transoxiana.

In time, Saladin rebelled against [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], and, upon his death, Saladin married his widow and captured most of Syria and created the [[Ayyubid]] dynasty.\n\nOn other fronts, the [[Georgia (country)#Antiquity|Kingdom of Georgia]] began to become a regional power and extended its borders at the expense of Great Seljuk. The same was true during the revival of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] under [[Leo II of Armenia]] in Anatolia. The [[Abbasid]] caliph [[An-Nasir]] also began to reassert the authority of the caliph and allied himself with the Khwarezmshah [[Takash]].\n\nFor a brief period, [[Toghrul III of Seljuq|Togrul III]] was the Sultan of all Seljuq except for Anatolia. In 1194, however, Togrul was defeated by [[Takash]], the Shah of [[Khwarezmid Empire]], and the Seljuq Empire finally collapsed. Of the former Seljuq Empire, only the [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] in [[Anatolia]] remained.\n\nAs the dynasty declined in the middle of the thirteenth century, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] invaded [[Mongol invasions of Anatolia|Anatolia]] in the 1260s and divided it into small [[emirate]]s called the [[Anatolian beyliks]]. Eventually one of these, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], would rise to power and conquer the rest.\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Seljuqs were educated in the service of Muslim courts as slaves or mercenaries. The dynasty brought revival, energy, and reunion to the Islamic civilization hitherto dominated by Arabs and Persians.\n\nThe Seljuqs founded universities and were also patrons of art and literature. Their reign is characterized by [[Persian people|Persian]] astronomers such as [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]], and the [[Persian people|Persian]] philosopher [[al-Ghazali]]. Under the Seljuqs, [[New Persian]] became the language for historical recording, while the center of Arabic language culture shifted from Baghdad to [[Cairo]].<ref>Andre Wink, ''Al-Hind: The Making of
