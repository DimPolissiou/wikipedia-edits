The scarce available data on media ownership and finances are badly reliable.<ref name=\"SeeMO\" /> Current legislation does not address the issue of media ownership transparency and concentration. These issues were not dealt with by the first provisional media regulations adopted by [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]] in 2000, so that ''de facto'' the issue was left to the authority of the Temporary Media Commissioner.<ref name=\"SeeMO\" /> The [[Independent Media Commission]] database usually contains the names of media owners.

A 2014 study that examined ownership transparency of eight news portals found out that none of them made publicly available information on ownership, only two published the names of the editors-in-chief, two provided information on the staff working in the media, and six offered information on the address of the outlet.<ref name=\"CRD\">{{cite web |title=Freedom of Expression, Media and Information in Kosovo: An Assessment Based on Council of Europe indicators for Media in a Democracy |url=https://www.civilrightsdefenders.org/files/Freedom_of_Expression_Media_and_Information_in_Kosovo_529396.pdf |date=July 2016 |website=Civilrightsdefenders.org |publisher= |access-date=11 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113162417/https://www.civilrightsdefenders.org/files/Freedom_of_Expression_Media_and_Information_in_Kosovo_529396.pdf |archive-date=13 January 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to some experts, this has contributed to an environment enabling fictive online portals to be established as political propaganda tools and to exert pressure on professional media outlets.<ref name=\"IREX2016\">{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2016 |title=Kosovo |url=https://www.irex.org/sites/default/files/pdf/media-sustainability-index-europe-eurasia-2016-kosovo.pdf.pdf |journal=IREX  |issue= Europe & Eurasia Media Sustainability Index 2016 |access-date= 11 January 2017}}</ref> The television and broadcast sector also remains heavily problematic in terms of media ownership transparency.<ref name=\"CRD\" /> Media analysts have thus raised concern on who exactly owns and controls the media in Kosovo, behind the nominal owners.<ref name=\"SeeMO\" /> This situation makes possible to identify a specific ownership pattern in Kosovo media system, which takes the shape of hidden ownership and nominal owners as a cover for actual owners.

First phase was the conventional military warfare \nbetween two organized armies: The US Forces and the First Philippine Republican Army. This was period was from February to November \n1899. The second phase started from November 1899 when the Revolutionary army was dissipated into \"guerrilla\" -style warfare. This was based on smaller organized units of soldiers and local civilian supporters. Leadership became arbitrary with succession of \"generals\" and \"commanders\" based on who was second in command from the hierarchy of the old republic or who has more supporters or people under one's command. The remnants of the First Philippine Republic continued the struggle for independence into local regional and provincial levels as late as 1915.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/war |title=The Philippine-American War, 1899\u20131902 |website=United States Department of State |publisher=Office of the Historian, Foreign Service Institute |access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n===Works cited in footnotes===\n* Almario, Virgilio (1998) *Rebolusyong Filipino, Intimas Memorias, memoirs of Colonel Sityar, in Spanish, page 197, translated to Tagalog by Almario\n* {{cite book|last= Alvarez|first=Santiago V.|title=The katipunan and the revolution: memoirs of a general : with the original Tagalog text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3q-krDckHwC|year=1992|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-971-550-077-7|ref=harv}}<!--note: also mentions \n\na General Mariano Alvarez (Apoy) on p.43, \na Lieutenant General Artemio Ricarte (Vibora) on p. 80, \na General Emilio Aguinaldo (Magdalo) on p.132, \na General Ramon Bernardo (Salogo) on p.145 & 163, \na General Luis Malinis on p.147,157 \na General Lucino de la Cruz (Ipo-Ipo) on p.150,\na General Francisco de Asis (Labe, Heneral Kiko) on p.152-153, 155\u2013156, & 164\u2013169\na General Vincente Leyba (Kalentong) on p.159 \na General Felipe Estrella on p. 182-189\na General Eusebio Roque  (Maestrong Sebio,Dimabunggo) on p. 182-189\na General Julian Santos on p. 195\na General Salvador Estrella on p. 197\na General Modesto Ritual on p.201-202 \na Information about \"Kolorum\" (Colorum) and religious-insurrection movements on p. 207\n-->\n\n* {{cite book|last= Halili|first=M.c.|title=Philippine history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC|year=2004|publisher=Rex Bookstore, Inc.|isbn=978-971-23-3934-9|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last= Linn|first=Brian McAllister|authorlink=Brian McAllister Linn|title=The U.S. Army and Counterinsurgency in the Philippine War, 1899-1902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5WOrmt_VxcC|year=2000|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=978-0-8078-4948-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Nakpil|first=Carmen Guerrero |title=Whatever: a new collection of later essays, 1987-2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fV0Ro1qPjXAC|year=2002|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-971-550-417-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/98377/king-of-the-philippines |title=King of the Philippines |last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=October 21, 2016 |access-date=December 27, 2017}}\n* {{cite book |last= Ochosa |first= Orlino |date= January 1, 1995|title=Bandoleros, Outlawed Guerrillas of the Philippine-American War, 1903\u20131907 |url=https://www.bookdepository.com/Bandoleros-Outlawed-Guerrillas-Philippine-American-War-1903-1907-Orlino-Ochosa/9789711005559 |location=United States of America |publisher=New Day Publishers |isbn=9711005557|ref=harv}}<!--\nnote: also mentions \n\na General Macario Sakay on  p.25\n-->\n* {{cite book|last1=Zaide|first1=Sonia M.|last2=Zaide|first2=Gregorio F.|title=The Philippines: a unique nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6ZtAQAACAAJ|year=1999|publisher=All-Nations Publishing Co.|isbn=978-971-642-064-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=United States Congressional Serial Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HwtHAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA664|year=1902|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}<!--\nnote: also mentions \n\na General Berixio Consola on  p.292\n-->\n* {{Google books| kO_WgIWHPH8C|Report of the Lieutenant-General Commanding the Army, Part 9 \u2013 U.S. Government Printing Office, 1902}}<!--note: also mentions\n\na Colonel Norberto Mayo on p. 175\n--> \n* {{Google books| ML9MAAAAYAAJ|1904 Annual Report of the Secretary of War: Volume 7 United States War Dept|page=38}}\n* {{Google books| ZEhUAAAAIAAJ|1907 Congressional Serial Set \u2013 U.S. Government Printing Office|page=240}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/ulatfilipino/311705/sino-si-heneral-kalentong-na-kilalang-kalye-sa-mandaluyong/story/ |title=Sino Si Heneral Kalentong Na Kilalang Kalye Sa Mandaluyong?

The second phase started from November 1899 when the Revolutionary army was dissipated into \"guerrilla\" -style warfare. This was based on smaller organized units of soldiers and local civilian supporters. Leadership became arbitrary with succession of \"generals\" and \"commanders\" based on who was second in command from the hierarchy of the old republic or who has more supporters or people under one's command. The remnants of the First Philippine Republic continued the struggle for independence into local regional and provincial levels as late as 1915.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/war |title=The Philippine-American War, 1899\u20131902 |website=United States Department of State |publisher=Office of the Historian, Foreign Service Institute |access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n===Works cited in footnotes===\n* Almario, Virgilio (1998) *Rebolusyong Filipino, Intimas Memorias, memoirs of Colonel Sityar, in Spanish, page 197, translated to Tagalog by Almario\n* {{cite book|last= Alvarez|first=Santiago V.|title=The katipunan and the revolution: memoirs of a general : with the original Tagalog text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3q-krDckHwC|year=1992|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-971-550-077-7|ref=harv}}<!--note: also mentions \n\na General Mariano Alvarez (Apoy) on p.43, \na Lieutenant General Artemio Ricarte (Vibora) on p. 80, \na General Emilio Aguinaldo (Magdalo) on p.132, \na General Ramon Bernardo (Salogo) on p.145 & 163, \na General Luis Malinis on p.147,157 \na General Lucino de la Cruz (Ipo-Ipo) on p.150,\na General Francisco de Asis (Labe, Heneral Kiko) on p.152-153, 155\u2013156, & 164\u2013169\na General Vincente Leyba (Kalentong) on p.159 \na General Felipe Estrella on p. 182-189\na General Eusebio Roque  (Maestrong Sebio,Dimabunggo) on p. 182-189\na General Julian Santos on p. 195\na General Salvador Estrella on p. 197\na General Modesto Ritual on p.201-202 \na Information about \"Kolorum\" (Colorum) and religious-insurrection movements on p. 207\n-->\n\n* {{cite book|last= Halili|first=M.c.|title=Philippine history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC|year=2004|publisher=Rex Bookstore, Inc.|isbn=978-971-23-3934-9|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last= Linn|first=Brian McAllister|authorlink=Brian McAllister Linn|title=The U.S. Army and Counterinsurgency in the Philippine War, 1899-1902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5WOrmt_VxcC|year=2000|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=978-0-8078-4948-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Nakpil|first=Carmen Guerrero |title=Whatever: a new collection of later essays, 1987-2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fV0Ro1qPjXAC|year=2002|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-971-550-417-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/98377/king-of-the-philippines |title=King of the Philippines |last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=October 21, 2016 |access-date=December 27, 2017}}\n* {{cite book |last= Ochosa |first= Orlino |date= January 1, 1995|title=Bandoleros, Outlawed Guerrillas of the Philippine-American War, 1903\u20131907 |url=https://www.bookdepository.com/Bandoleros-Outlawed-Guerrillas-Philippine-American-War-1903-1907-Orlino-Ochosa/9789711005559 |location=United States of America |publisher=New Day Publishers |isbn=9711005557|ref=harv}}<!--\nnote: also mentions \n\na General Macario Sakay on  p.25\n-->\n* {{cite book|last1=Zaide|first1=Sonia M.|last2=Zaide|first2=Gregorio F.|title=The Philippines: a unique nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6ZtAQAACAAJ|year=1999|publisher=All-Nations Publishing Co.|isbn=978-971-642-064-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=United States Congressional Serial Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HwtHAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA664|year=1902|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}<!--\nnote: also mentions \n\na General Berixio Consola on  p.292\n-->\n* {{Google books| kO_WgIWHPH8C|Report of the Lieutenant-General Commanding the Army, Part 9 \u2013 U.S. Government Printing Office, 1902}}<!--note: also mentions\n\na Colonel Norberto Mayo on p. 175\n--> \n* {{Google books| ML9MAAAAYAAJ|1904 Annual Report of the Secretary of War: Volume 7 United States War Dept|page=38}}\n* {{Google books| ZEhUAAAAIAAJ|1907 Congressional Serial Set \u2013 U.S. Government Printing Office|page=240}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/ulatfilipino/311705/sino-si-heneral-kalentong-na-kilalang-kalye-sa-mandaluyong/story/ |title=Sino Si Heneral Kalentong Na Kilalang Kalye Sa Mandaluyong?

All three Sinbad films were conceptualized by [[Ray Harryhausen]] using [[Dynamation]], the full color [[widescreen]] [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]] technique that he created.\n\nWhile similarly named, the film does not follow the storyline of the tale \"[[Sinbad the Sailor#Seventh and Last Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor|The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor]]\" but instead has more in common with the [[Sinbad the Sailor#Third Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor|Third]] and [[Sinbad the Sailor#Fifth Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor|Fifth]] voyages of Sinbad.\n\n''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad'' was selected in 2008 for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Cinematic Classics, Legendary Stars, Comedic Legends and Novice Filmmakers Showcase the 2008 Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-08-237/2008-entries-to-national-film-registry-announced/2008-12-30/|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Sinbad the Sailor]] and his ship's crew make landfall on the island of Colossa, where they encounter Sokurah the [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] fleeing a giant [[cyclops]]. Though he escapes, Sokurah loses a [[Aladdin|magic lamp]] to the creature. Sinbad refuses his desperate pleas to return to Colossa because Parisa, Princess of [[Chandra]], is aboard. Their coming marriage is meant to secure peace between her father's realm and Sinbad's homeland, [[Baghdad]].\n[[File:7th voyage of Sinbad - Roc.png|left|thumb|Sinbad and his men confront the [[Roc (mythology)|Roc]].]]\nAfter reaching Baghdad, Sokurah performs magic at the pre-wedding festivities, temporarily turning Parisa's handmaiden into a [[N\u0101ga|snake-like being]]. Despite his prowess and a dark prophecy about war between Baghdad and Chandra, the Caliph of Baghdad refuses to help the magician return to Colossa. Later that night, Sokurah secretly shrinks the princess, enraging her father, the Sultan of Chandra, who declares war on Baghdad. Sinbad and the Caliph give in to Sokurah, who explains that the eggshell of a [[Roc (mythology)|Roc]] is needed for the potion that will restore Parisa, and it can be found only on Colossa. Sokurah provides Sinbad with the plans for a giant crossbow for protection against the island's giant creatures.\n\nSinbad recruits additional crewmen from among the convicts in the Caliph's prisons. Before they reach Colossa, the cutthroats mutiny and capture Sokurah, Sinbad, and his men. During a violent storm, the sounds of keening [[demon]]s from a nearby island drives the crew nearly mad, endangering the ship. One of the men releases Sinbad so he can save them, after the mutineers' leader falls to his death from the crow's nest.\n\nOn Colossa, Sinbad, Sokurah, and six of his crew enter the valley of the cyclops, followed by Sinbad's loyal aide Harufa. Sinbad and Sokurah split their forces. Sinbad and his men find the cyclops' treasure cave, but are captured by one of the creatures and locked in a wooden cage. Sokurah, in the meantime, retrieves the magic lamp, but is chased by the cyclops, who kills three of the men. With Parisa's aid, Sinbad manages to escape, then blinds the one-eyed creature and lures it off the edge of a cliff to its death. Sinbad decides to hold on to the lamp until Parisa is returned to normal size.\n\nSokurah leads Sinbad and his starving men to the nesting place of the giant Rocs. Out of hunger, Sinbad's men try to break open a Roc egg, causing it to hatch, but the newborn chick is killed by the men and fire-roasted for food. While the men are eating, Parisa enters the magic lamp and befriends Barani, the childlike [[Jinn|Genie]] inside, who tells her how to summon him in exchange for her promise of his freedom. The parent Roc returns and slays the men. Sinbad tries to summon the genie, but he is grabbed by the Roc, who takes flight, and drops him, unconscious, into its nearby nest. Sokurah kills Harufa and abducts the princess, taking her to his underground fortress.\n\nSinbad awakens and rubs the magic lamp, summoning Barani, who takes Sinbad to Sokurah's fortress and helps him evade the chained [[dragon]] that stands guard. Sinbad reaches Sokurah, who restores the princess to normal. When Sinbad refuses to hand over the lamp, the magician animates a [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton warrior]], which Sinbad sword-fights and destroys. With the help of the genie, Sinbad and Parisa make their way out of the cave, stopping to destroy the lamp by throwing it into a pool of lava, thus freeing Barani.\n\nLeaving the cave, they encounter another cyclops. Sinbad releases the dragon, which fights and kills the creature. Sinbad and Parisa make their escape, but Sokurah orders the dragon to hunt them down. Sinbad heads to the beach, where his men have readied the giant crossbow, and they use it to kill the dragon. The dying dragon collapses on Sokurah, crushing him to death. Sinbad, Parisa, and the remaining crew depart for Baghdad. They are joined by Barani, now human, who has appointed himself as Sinbad's cabin boy. In a final act of magic as he was being freed, Barani filled the captain's cabin with the treasure from the cyclops' cave, a wedding gift to Sinbad and Parisa.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kerwin Mathews]] as Sinbad\n* [[Kathryn Crosby|Kathryn Grant]] as Princess Parisa\n* [[Richard Eyer]] as Barani, the [[Jinn|Genie]]\n* [[Torin Thatcher]] as Sokurah\n* [[Alec Mango]] as the [[Caliphate|Caliph]] of [[Baghdad]]\n* [[Harold Kasket]] as the [[Sultan]], Parisa's father\n* Alfred Brown as Harufa, Sinbad's loyal right-hand man\n* Nana DeHerrera as Sadi (as Nana de Herrera)\n* Nino Falanga as Gaunt Sailor\n* Luis Guedes as Crewman\n* [[Virgilio Teixeira (actor)|Virgilio Teixeira]] as Ali\n* [[Danny Green (actor)|Danny Green]] as Karim\n* [[Juan Olaguivel]] as Golar\n\n==Production==\n[[File:7th voyage of Sinbad - Cyclops vs Dragon.png|thumb|The [[cyclops]] and [[dragon]] battle sequence from the film.]]\nSchneer announced the production in June 1957.

Filming started the following month in Spain.<ref>'Matchmaker' Actress in Kaye Lead; 'Sinbad' Will Glamorize Grant\nSchallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times 27 June 1957: C9. </ref>\n\nIt took Ray Harryhausen 11 months to complete the full color, widescreen stop-motion animation sequences for ''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad''. Harryhausen's \"Dynamation\" label was used for the first time on this film.<ref>{{cite web|title=The name Dynamation|url=http://www.harryhausenarchive.com/dynamation.php|website=The Official Ray Harryhausen Website|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nHarryhausen gave the cyclops a horn, goat legs, and cloven hooves, an idea based upon the concept of the [[Greek god]] [[Pan (god)|Pan]]. He lifted much of the creature's design (for example the torso, chest, arms, poise and style of movement) from his concept of the [[Ymir]] (the [[Venus]]ian creature from his earlier ''[[20 Million Miles to Earth]]''). He used the same armature for both figures; to do this, he had to cannibalize the Ymir, removing the latter's latex body.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=John|title=Cheap Tricks and Class Acts: Special Effects, Makeup and Stunts from the Fantastic Fifties|date=1996|publisher=McFarland and Company, Inc.|isbn=0-7864-0093-5|page=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NHzeZZOUD6QC&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=ray+harryhausen+cannibalized+ymir+for+cyclops&source=bl&ots=2IzzO3t9I3&sig=4nVGJaqKsIISAfcf41Mgz7keoMY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDuIH6l9nRAhXJ8YMKHfMgCVYQ6AEILzAD#v=onepage&q=ray%20harryhausen%20cannibalized%20ymir%20for%20cyclops&f=false|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nHarryhausen researched the cobra-woman sequence (when Sakourah entertains the [[Caliphate|Caliph]] and the [[Sultan]]) by watching a belly dancer in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. During the performance, Harryhausen says, \"smoke was coming up my jacket. I thought I was on fire! It turned out the gentleman behind me was smoking a hookah!\" The cyclops is the film's most popular character, but Harryhausen's personal favorite was the cobra-woman, a combination of Princess Parisa's maid, Sadi, and a cobra.<ref>Dalton 2003, p. 112.</ref>\n\nThe film's original script had a climax that involved two cyclops fighting. In the final version, however, the climactic battle featured a single cyclops versus a dragon. The model of the dragon was more than three feet long and was very difficult to animate; the fight sequence took nearly three weeks for Harryhausen to complete. Originally, it was planned to have the dragon breathing fire from its mouth during the entire sequence, but the cost was deemed too high. So the scenes where it does breathe fire, Harryhausen used a [[flamethrower]], shooting out flames 30 to 40 feet against a night sky, then superimposing the filmed fire very near the dragon's mouth.<ref>Dalton 2005, pp. 160\u2013166.</ref>\n\nThe sword fight scene between Sinbad and the [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton]] proved so popular with audiences that Harryhausen recreated and expanded the scene five years later, this time having a group of seven armed skeletons fight the Greek hero Jason and his men in 1963's ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]''.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/mn/nn/JasonArgonauts.html \"'Jason and the Argonauts'.\"] ''Monstervision'', 2000. Retrieved: January 29, 2015.</ref>\n\nThe stop-motion cobra-woman figure used for the film was cannibalized 20 years later in order to make the [[Medusa]] figure in Harryhausen's final film, ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]].''{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==Film score==\nThe music score for ''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad'' was composed by [[Bernard Herrmann]], better known at the time for his collaboration with the director [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. Herrmann went on to write the scores for three other Harryhausen films: ''[[Mysterious Island (1961 film)|Mysterious Island]]'', ''[[The 3 Worlds of Gulliver]]'', and ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]''. Of the four, Harryhausen regarded the score for ''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad'' as being the finest, due to the empathy Herrmann's main title composition evoked for the subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe soundtrack producer Robert Townson, who re-recorded the score in 1998 with the [[Royal Scottish National Orchestra]], described the music as rich and vibrant, commenting \"I would cite ''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad'' as one of the scores which most validates film music as an art form and a forum where a great composer can write a great piece of music. As pure composition, I would place Sinbad beside anything else written this century and not worry about it being able to stand on its own\".<ref>Luchs, Kurt.

All three Sinbad films were conceptualized by [[Ray Harryhausen]] using [[Dynamation]], the full color [[widescreen]] [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]] technique that he created.\n\nWhile similarly named, the film does not follow the storyline of the tale \"[[Sinbad the Sailor#Seventh and Last Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor|The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor]]\" but instead has more in common with the [[Sinbad the Sailor#Third Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor|Third]] and [[Sinbad the Sailor#Fifth Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor|Fifth]] voyages of Sinbad.\n\n''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad'' was selected in 2008 for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Cinematic Classics, Legendary Stars, Comedic Legends and Novice Filmmakers Showcase the 2008 Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-08-237/2008-entries-to-national-film-registry-announced/2008-12-30/|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Sinbad the Sailor]] and his ship's crew make landfall on the island of Colossa, where they encounter Sokurah the [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] fleeing a giant [[cyclops]]. Though he escapes, Sokurah loses a [[Aladdin|magic lamp]] to the creature. Sinbad refuses his desperate pleas to return to Colossa because Parisa, Princess of [[Chandra]], is aboard. Their coming marriage is meant to secure peace between her father's realm and Sinbad's homeland, [[Baghdad]].\n[[File:7th voyage of Sinbad - Roc.png|left|thumb|Sinbad and his men confront the [[Roc (mythology)|Roc]].]]\nAfter reaching Baghdad, Sokurah performs magic at the pre-wedding festivities, temporarily turning Parisa's handmaiden into a [[N\u0101ga|snake-like being]]. Despite his prowess and a dark prophecy about war between Baghdad and Chandra, the Caliph of Baghdad refuses to help the magician return to Colossa. Later that night, Sokurah secretly shrinks the princess, enraging her father, the Sultan of Chandra, who declares war on Baghdad. Sinbad and the Caliph give in to Sokurah, who explains that the eggshell of a [[Roc (mythology)|Roc]] is needed for the potion that will restore Parisa, and it can be found only on Colossa. Sokurah provides Sinbad with the plans for a giant crossbow for protection against the island's giant creatures.\n\nSinbad recruits additional crewmen from among the convicts in the Caliph's prisons. Before they reach Colossa, the cutthroats mutiny and capture Sokurah, Sinbad, and his men. During a violent storm, the sounds of keening [[demon]]s from a nearby island drives the crew nearly mad, endangering the ship. One of the men releases Sinbad so he can save them, after the mutineers' leader falls to his death from the crow's nest.\n\nOn Colossa, Sinbad, Sokurah, and six of his crew enter the valley of the cyclops, followed by Sinbad's loyal aide Harufa. Sinbad and Sokurah split their forces. Sinbad and his men find the cyclops' treasure cave, but are captured by one of the creatures and locked in a wooden cage. Sokurah, in the meantime, retrieves the magic lamp, but is chased by the cyclops, who kills three of the men. With Parisa's aid, Sinbad manages to escape, then blinds the one-eyed creature and lures it off the edge of a cliff to its death. Sinbad decides to hold on to the lamp until Parisa is returned to normal size.\n\nSokurah leads Sinbad and his starving men to the nesting place of the giant Rocs. Out of hunger, Sinbad's men try to break open a Roc egg, causing it to hatch, but the newborn chick is killed by the men and fire-roasted for food. While the men are eating, Parisa enters the magic lamp and befriends Barani, the childlike [[Jinn|Genie]] inside, who tells her how to summon him in exchange for her promise of his freedom. The parent Roc returns and slays the men. Sinbad tries to summon the genie, but he is grabbed by the Roc, who takes flight, and drops him, unconscious, into its nearby nest. Sokurah kills Harufa and abducts the princess, taking her to his underground fortress.\n\nSinbad awakens and rubs the magic lamp, summoning Barani, who takes Sinbad to Sokurah's fortress and helps him evade the chained [[dragon]] that stands guard. Sinbad reaches Sokurah, who restores the princess to normal. When Sinbad refuses to hand over the lamp, the magician animates a [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton warrior]], which Sinbad sword-fights and destroys. With the help of the genie, Sinbad and Parisa make their way out of the cave, stopping to destroy the lamp by throwing it into a pool of lava, thus freeing Barani.\n\nLeaving the cave, they encounter another cyclops. Sinbad releases the dragon, which fights and kills the creature. Sinbad and Parisa make their escape, but Sokurah orders the dragon to hunt them down. Sinbad heads to the beach, where his men have readied the giant crossbow, and they use it to kill the dragon. The dying dragon collapses on Sokurah, crushing him to death. Sinbad, Parisa, and the remaining crew depart for Baghdad. They are joined by Barani, now human, who has appointed himself as Sinbad's cabin boy. In a final act of magic as he was being freed, Barani filled the captain's cabin with the treasure from the cyclops' cave, a wedding gift to Sinbad and Parisa.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kerwin Mathews]] as Sinbad\n* [[Kathryn Crosby|Kathryn Grant]] as Princess Parisa\n* [[Richard Eyer]] as Barani, the [[Jinn|Genie]]\n* [[Torin Thatcher]] as Sokurah\n* [[Alec Mango]] as the [[Caliphate|Caliph]] of [[Baghdad]]\n* [[Harold Kasket]] as the [[Sultan]], Parisa's father\n* Alfred Brown as Harufa, Sinbad's loyal right-hand man\n* Nana DeHerrera as Sadi (as Nana de Herrera)\n* Nino Falanga as Gaunt Sailor\n* Luis Guedes as Crewman\n* [[Virgilio Teixeira (actor)|Virgilio Teixeira]] as Ali\n* [[Danny Green (actor)|Danny Green]] as Karim\n\n==Production==\n[[File:7th voyage of Sinbad - Cyclops vs Dragon.png|thumb|The [[cyclops]] and [[dragon]] battle sequence from the film.]]\nSchneer announced the production in June 1957.

Filming started the following month in Spain.<ref>'Matchmaker' Actress in Kaye Lead; 'Sinbad' Will Glamorize Grant\nSchallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times 27 June 1957: C9. </ref>\n\nIt took Ray Harryhausen 11 months to complete the full color, widescreen stop-motion animation sequences for ''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad''. Harryhausen's \"Dynamation\" label was used for the first time on this film.<ref>{{cite web|title=The name Dynamation|url=http://www.harryhausenarchive.com/dynamation.php|website=The Official Ray Harryhausen Website|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nHarryhausen gave the cyclops a horn, goat legs, and cloven hooves, an idea based upon the concept of the [[Greek god]] [[Pan (god)|Pan]]. He lifted much of the creature's design (for example the torso, chest, arms, poise and style of movement) from his concept of the [[Ymir]] (the [[Venus]]ian creature from his earlier ''[[20 Million Miles to Earth]]''). He used the same armature for both figures; to do this, he had to cannibalize the Ymir, removing the latter's latex body.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=John|title=Cheap Tricks and Class Acts: Special Effects, Makeup and Stunts from the Fantastic Fifties|date=1996|publisher=McFarland and Company, Inc.|isbn=0-7864-0093-5|page=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NHzeZZOUD6QC&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=ray+harryhausen+cannibalized+ymir+for+cyclops&source=bl&ots=2IzzO3t9I3&sig=4nVGJaqKsIISAfcf41Mgz7keoMY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDuIH6l9nRAhXJ8YMKHfMgCVYQ6AEILzAD#v=onepage&q=ray%20harryhausen%20cannibalized%20ymir%20for%20cyclops&f=false|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nHarryhausen researched the cobra-woman sequence (when Sakourah entertains the [[Caliphate|Caliph]] and the [[Sultan]]) by watching a belly dancer in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. During the performance, Harryhausen says, \"smoke was coming up my jacket. I thought I was on fire! It turned out the gentleman behind me was smoking a hookah!\" The cyclops is the film's most popular character, but Harryhausen's personal favorite was the cobra-woman, a combination of Princess Parisa's maid, Sadi, and a cobra.<ref>Dalton 2003, p. 112.</ref>\n\nThe film's original script had a climax that involved two cyclops fighting. In the final version, however, the climactic battle featured a single cyclops versus a dragon. The model of the dragon was more than three feet long and was very difficult to animate; the fight sequence took nearly three weeks for Harryhausen to complete. Originally, it was planned to have the dragon breathing fire from its mouth during the entire sequence, but the cost was deemed too high. So the scenes where it does breathe fire, Harryhausen used a [[flamethrower]], shooting out flames 30 to 40 feet against a night sky, then superimposing the filmed fire very near the dragon's mouth.<ref>Dalton 2005, pp. 160\u2013166.</ref>\n\nThe sword fight scene between Sinbad and the [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton]] proved so popular with audiences that Harryhausen recreated and expanded the scene five years later, this time having a group of seven armed skeletons fight the Greek hero Jason and his men in 1963's ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]''.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/mn/nn/JasonArgonauts.html \"'Jason and the Argonauts'.\"] ''Monstervision'', 2000. Retrieved: January 29, 2015.</ref>\n\nThe stop-motion cobra-woman figure used for the film was cannibalized 20 years later in order to make the [[Medusa]] figure in Harryhausen's final film, ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]].''{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==Film score==\nThe music score for ''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad'' was composed by [[Bernard Herrmann]], better known at the time for his collaboration with the director [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. Herrmann went on to write the scores for three other Harryhausen films: ''[[Mysterious Island (1961 film)|Mysterious Island]]'', ''[[The 3 Worlds of Gulliver]]'', and ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]''. Of the four, Harryhausen regarded the score for ''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad'' as being the finest, due to the empathy Herrmann's main title composition evoked for the subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe soundtrack producer Robert Townson, who re-recorded the score in 1998 with the [[Royal Scottish National Orchestra]], described the music as rich and vibrant, commenting \"I would cite ''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad'' as one of the scores which most validates film music as an art form and a forum where a great composer can write a great piece of music. As pure composition, I would place Sinbad beside anything else written this century and not worry about it being able to stand on its own\".<ref>Luchs, Kurt.

The episode starts with the show logo in a room and it is filling with water. Then the Little Fish [[break the fourth wall]] by saying the title of the show to the audience. Then it's starts with an introduction by Molly, saying 'Hi, it's me, Molly, and it's time for\u2014' only to be stopped by Gil performing an act related to the episode's subject. One or both of the two then state 'It's time for ''Bubble Guppies''!', and the theme song plays. After the theme song, the Little Fish say the episode's name.\n\nAn event may occur when one or more characters is on the way to school. For example, Avi breaks his tail in \"Call a Clambulance!\" when Oona is on the way to school. A guppy tells Mr. Grouper about the earlier experience. He suggests, \"Let's think about it,\" and the characters discuss the theme. A song follows, focusing on the episode's main theme. Usually, Molly or Gil sing this song, but there are episodes where Deema or Mr. Grouper sing it instead.\n\nOne of the guppies may go to a shop that mostly focuses on the theme (example: a doctor's office in \"Call a Clambulance!\"). The owner of the shop (usually played by Deema) will ask questions about what he or she needs. Jokes and silly responses will eventually lead to the correct necessity. Mr. Grouper often ends this segment by asking, \"Excuse me, what time is it?\" in a [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] pattern, with the guppies responding, \"It's time for lunch!\" three times.\n\nAt lunch, three of the characters make a food pun about the subject of the episode; usually done by Nonny. After lunch, another Gil and Molly sketch is shown.\n\nAfter the sketch, some classroom activity is shown further reinforcing that episode's topic, or Mr. Grouper talks more about the theme. This is usually ended when Mr. Grouper says, \"Line up everybody, it's time to go outside!\" followed by the \"outside song\". Outside the classroom, the guppies act out a story about the theme, interfused with [[Adobe Flash]]-animated graphics. Once back inside, a second song is typically performed. Afterward, Gil and Molly do another sketch.\n\nThe guppies may then go on a field trip that focuses on the theme.\nThey yell out, \"FIELD TRIP!\" This may focus on a problem shown earlier and involves the key characters. The episode concludes with a final sketch by Gil and Molly, followed by a shorter version of the theme song. The credits then roll which include a song played earlier in that episode.\n\nSeason 5 introduced a new series format which has the story segment take up the majority of the episode, and incorporates the shop and lunch segments into the narrative. Gil and Molly simply introduce themselves before the theme song with no opening gag, the show cuts right to school after the theme, and the dance songs and field trips were removed. Gil and Molly's sketches were removed as well, instead having Mr. Grouper wave goodbye to the viewer as the guppies go back inside.\n\nA significant contribution to the show's popularity is its two-level humor track. Minor characters include a police officer named Miranda and a winged serpent named Pretzel-coatl. Heavy metal singer [[Ozzy Osbourne]] guest starred as Sid Fishy in the 2015 episode ''Super Guppies''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/ozzy-osbourne-will-play-sid-fishy-in-kids-show-bubble-guppies-20140617|title=Ozzy Osbourne Will Play 'Sid Fishy' in New Show 'Bubble Guppies' \u2013 Rolling Stone|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=30 April 2015}}</ref>, while actor [[George Takei]] guest starred in a tour de force sci-fi mashup which pitted him as a [[Darth Vader]]-like armored villain against starship captain Gil and his first officer, Mr. Smart (Nonny).

The episode starts with the show logo in a room and it is filling with water. Then the Little Fish [[break the fourth wall]] by saying the title of the show to the audience. Then it's starts with an introduction by Molly, saying 'Hi, it's me, Molly, and it's time for\u2014' only to be stopped by Gil performing an act related to the episode's subject. One or both of the two then state 'It's time for ''Bubble Guppies''!', and the theme song plays. After the theme song, the Little Fish say the episode's name.\n\nAn event may occur when one or more characters is on the way to school. For example, Avi breaks his tail in \"Call a Clambulance!\" when Oona is on the way to school. A guppy tells Mr. Grouper about the earlier experience. He suggests, \"Let's think about it,\" and the characters discuss the theme. A song follows, focusing on the episode's main theme. Usually, Molly or Gil sing this song, but there are episodes where Deema or Mr. Grouper sing it instead.\n\nOne of the guppies may go to a shop that mostly focuses on the theme (example: a doctor's office in \"Call a Clambulance!\"). The owner of the shop (usually played by Deema) will ask questions about what he or she needs. Jokes and silly responses will eventually lead to the correct necessity. Mr. Grouper often ends this segment by asking, \"Excuse me, what time is it?\" in a [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] pattern, with the guppies responding, \"It's time for lunch!\" three times.\n\nAt lunch, three of the characters make a food pun about the subject of the episode; usually done by Nonny. After lunch, another Gil and Molly sketch is shown.\n\nAfter the sketch, some classroom activity is shown further reinforcing that episode's topic, or Mr. Grouper talks more about the theme. This is usually ended when Mr. Grouper says, \"Line up everybody, it's time to go outside!\" followed by the \"outside song\". Outside the classroom, the guppies act out a story about the theme, interfused with [[Adobe Flash]]-animated graphics. Once back inside, a second song is typically performed. Afterward, Gil and Molly do another sketch.\n\nThe guppies may then go on a field trip that focuses on the theme.\nThey yell out, \"FIELD TRIP!\" This may focus on a problem shown earlier and involves the key characters. The episode concludes with a final sketch by Gil and Molly, followed by a shorter version of the theme song. The credits then roll which include a song played earlier in that episode.\n\nSeason 5 introduced a new series format which has the story segment take up the majority of the episode, and incorporates the shop and lunch segments into the narrative. Gil and Molly simply introduce themselves before the theme song with no opening gag, the show cuts right to school after the theme, and the dance songs and field trips were removed. Gil and Molly's sketches were removed as well, instead having Mr. Grouper wave goodbye to the viewer as the guppies go back inside.\n\nA significant contribution to the show's popularity is its two-level humor track. Minor characters include a police officer named Miranda and a winged serpent named Pretzel-coatl. Heavy metal singer [[Ozzy Osbourne]] guest starred as Sid Fishy in the 2015 episode ''Super Guppies''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/ozzy-osbourne-will-play-sid-fishy-in-kids-show-bubble-guppies-20140617|title=Ozzy Osbourne Will Play 'Sid Fishy' in New Show 'Bubble Guppies' \u2013 Rolling Stone|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=30 April 2015}}</ref>, while actor [[George Takei]] guest starred in a tour de force sci-fi mashup which pitted him as a [[Darth Vader]]-like armored villain against starship captain Gil and his first officer, Mr. Smart (Nonny). Any grownup who has ever seen [[Monty Python's Meaning of Life]] will instantly recognize recurring character Mr. Grumpfish, while the episode ''The Puppy & The Ring'' makes in-jokes ranging from [[JRR Tolkien/The Lord of the Rings|JRR Tolkien]] to [[L Frank Baum]].\n\n==Main characters==\n*Gil (voiced by [[Zachary Gordon]] (Seasons 1), [[Jacob Bertrand]] (Season 2), [[Jay Gragnani]] (Season 3-4) and [[Quinn Breslin]] (Season 5) (speaking voice), Teddy Walsh (singing voice) (Seasons 1-4) in US, Hayden Hunter in series 1\u20133, [[John Campbell (voice actor)|John Campbell]] in series 3, and Sam Brown in series 3-4 in UK) is a human guppy boy with a silly personality.

The band played two songs from the album on their national TV debut in January 2011, and then went on The Game Changers Tour to help promote the album; shortly afterwards [[What Separates Me from You Tour|touring worldwide]] in support of the release. Two later singles off the album charted: \"[[All Signs Point to Lauderdale]]\", released in May, reached number 32 on the [[Hot Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, and [[radio single]] \"[[It's Complicated (song)|It's Complicated]]\", released in October, peaked at number 34 on the same chart.

Election campaigns spend significant sums in the media, and oppressive regimes nearly always seek to control the media. It is a very powerful means of persuasion. Prior to Chomsky's propaganda model, [[George Orwell]] noted: \"All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news.\"<ref name=\"orwell\" /> This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information provided by government, business and 'experts' approved and paid for by these primary sources.. \n\nThere is recent evidence to suggest that newer media portals (as opposed to those outlets of \"traditional\" [[mainstream media]]) are turning more readily to using the PMC framework in critical analysis and interpretation of media behavior. One notable example of this is with regard to the [[Leveson Inquiry]].<ref name=\"lse0\">{{cite web | title=Leveson: Bloggers vs the Press | website=Media Policy Project | date=7 December 2012 | url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2012/12/07/leveson-bloggers-vs-the-press/ | access-date=2 August 2018}}</ref> \n\n[[File:The_Leveson_Love_Triangle_Leveson-2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Leveson Love Triangle: Favours and reciprocities of the politico-media complex depicted by the [http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/programme Media Policy Project] of the [[London School of Economics]]]]\n\n==Early media institutions==\nBefore [[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented [[movable type]] in 1450, most information was delivered by [[town criers]], ministers from the pulpit or bartenders.

Corantos eventually would become regular periodicals that were subject to the less political control and mark one of the earlier forms of industrialized media.<ref>Patterson, Catherine. \"Inventing the News.\" Engines of our Ingenuity.

Where the less influential ones are not necessarily less self-congratulatory, they are certainly more inward-looking and always carry the label of national specificity.\"<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\">Hedetoft, Ulf. \"Contemporary Cinema: Between Cultural Globalisation and National Interpretation.\" ''Cinema and Nation''. Eds. Mette Hjort and Scott Mackenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 280</ref> He goes on, however, to say that these more transnationally powerful films actually become de-nationalized as a result of its \"national-cultural currency\" more widely and easily dispersed, mixing with other cultures, becoming either a \"positive admixture\" to other countries' cultures and identities or a \"model for emulation.\"<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\"/> He compares national cinema that undergoes such processes to English becoming a global lingua Franca: the cultural sharing that results is [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] and the globalizing process is non-symmetrical.<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\"/>\n\n===Propaganda===\n{{Main|Propaganda}}\nPropaganda is a way that politics can be represented and manipulated in film. Leif Furhammar and Folke Isaksson credit Russian producers [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] with the birth of propaganda aesthetics, for which the underlying assumption was that by manipulating cinematic images representing reality, they could manipulate spectators' concepts of reality.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\">Furhammar, p. 152.</ref> Documentaries can be an even more effective form of propaganda than other [[genre]] films because the form of representation claims to mirror reality, making the manipulation of an audience that much more obscured.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/>\n\nSuch British newsreels as ''[[The Battle of the Somme]]'' of [[World War I]] were propaganda because they only showed the war from their own perspective, though it can be argued as being more honest and objective than more recent war documentaries (for they were edited without adjustments for [[drama]]tic or epic effect).{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Their photographers remained on their front lines, therefore presenting at least some truth.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> According to Furhammar and Isaksson, it was Russian filmmakers who were the \"masters of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]]\" who discovered film's power to create convincing illusion with cutting, rhythmic editing, and a didactic approach.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/>\n\n[[File:WWII Divide and Conquer 2.jpg|thumb|A scene from \"[[Divide and Conquer (newsreel)|Divide and Conquer]]\", the third installment of [[Why We Fight]], 1943.]]\nWhen sound became possible, documentaries have been said to become more politically powerful with the use of speakers' voices and music.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> In Nazi Germany, newsreels were just as important as feature films, while in Fascist Italy propaganda was mostly limited to documentaries.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> A comparison of the first three installments of the American series ''[[Why We Fight]]'' and the Nazi documentary ''[[Sieg im Westen]]'' (''Victory in the West'') demonstrates how convincing even two opposing interpretations of the same events can be.{{Original research inline|date=June 2013}} The first covers years in a couple of hours but its density disguises any omission of truth while the latter manages to depict war with real images but without blood or death. The same is found in documentaries about the Spanish Civil War.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 153\">Furhammar, p. 153.</ref>\n\nFalsification of political matter in documentaries can be created by lifting shots of events other than the one being dealt with and including them in the film so that they appear to be a part of the \"reality\" it claims to represent. The [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], for example, did this with ''Operation Abolition''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeiW63M3bcI \"Operation Abolition,\" 1960 - YouTube]</ref><ref>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894425-1,00.html Operation Abolition]\", ''Time'' magazine, 1961.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsCfYYi2FE Operation Abolition (1960) - YouTube]</ref><ref>\"[https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/operation-abolition/ Operation Abolition]\", video.google.com and ''Time'' magazine, Friday, Mar. 17, 1961.</ref> in 1960 and Nazi newsreels depicted scenes of the Allies' defeat at Dieppe as real scenes from the Normandy invasion just a few days afterward to convince audience of the Reich's success.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Audience's political affiliations can also be manipulated by actually staging the ostensibly real events as the 1944 Nazi picture ''The F\u00fchrer Gives the Jews a Town'' did.<ref>Furhammar, p. 154.</ref>\n\n[[World War II]] propaganda persisted 30 years after [[Dachau]] and [[Auschwitz]] such as in the thinly disguised fascist Italian film ''[[The Night Porter]]'' (1974). The film sought to legitimize the Nazis' genocide, while glorifying sadism, brutality, and machismo.<ref>Giroux, p. 29</ref> What amazes [[Henry Giroux]], as he explains in \"Breaking into the Movies,\" is that such blatant ideological messages were ignored by critics and the general public. That society may be incapable of testing the present against the past has implications for post-industrial oppression in the West and the strategies for resisting it. Despite the writings of [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Paulo Freire]], the majority of Americans (at least) do not recognize how important class [[hegemony]], or cultural domination, is in nations where populations are kept obedient to governments through ideological means.<ref name=\"Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31\">Giroux, p. 31</ref> He argues, \"We are not only victims in the political and material sense, but are also tied emotionally and intellectually to the prevailing ruling-class norms and values.\"<ref name=\"Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31\"/>\n\nThough feature forms of propaganda lack documentaries' ostensible authenticity they can retain political power because directors' resources are less limited and they can create the reality of the film.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} They further compensate for lack of credibility with intensity.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 153\"/>\n\n===Anti-politics in film===\nDespite the strong patriotism and nationalism of Americans, overtly political films have never been popular in the U.S. while films that have represented politics inconspicuously (such as in the form of propaganda) have remained popular.<ref>Lindholm, p. 32</ref> Besides [[Frank Capra]], no other major American filmmaker has seriously presented central themes of citizenship, participation, and responsibility in civic life amidst the complexities and corruption of the political world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} While Capra sought to \"develop a positive American cinematic vocabulary for political action\" of the individual, as Charles Lindholm and John A. Hall describe, he ultimately failed.<ref>Lindholm, p. 33</ref>\n\n[[File:James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington trailer 2.JPG|thumb|A scene from Capra's ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', 1939]]Capra's films are characterized by the same basic formula according to which the fundamental American values of fairness and honesty are challenged by the corruption and cruelty of politics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Ronald Reagan later extensively quoted the speech made by Mr. Deeds in ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936) in which he expresses his disgust with the complexities of politics and calls for individual goodness.<ref>Lindholm, p. 34</ref> In his next film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', (1939) Capra reinforces the integrity and decency of the everyman who can transcend politics despite the power and crookedness of special interest groups.<ref>Lindholm, p. 34-35</ref> After the hero of ''[[Meet John Doe]]'' realizes his need for others, he discovers and attempts to expose a fascist bidder for presidency planning to take advantage of his club support. He fails, however, in the midst of a violent mob with the depressing conclusion that the American public is a credulous crowd, susceptible to manipulation until the John Doe club members come begging his forgiveness and convince him to return to lead them.<ref>Lindholm, p. 36</ref>\n\nThe ending of ''John Doe'' was unsuccessful amongst audiences and critics, discouraging any more political films for Capra and no films of merit after ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. Capra's ultimate fall from filmmaking and his advice that all American filmmakers should forget politics if they do not want to cut themselves in half signify the challenge filmmakers face when they attempt to criticize politics.<ref>Lindholm, p. 40</ref> Lindholm and Hall observe that \"the problems that defeated Capra have also undercut later attempts by American filmmakers to portray the complex relationship between individualism and citizenship in the United States\" and claim that Hollywood has instead adopted the paranoia of politics that Capra had tried to overcome.<ref>Lindholm, p. 42</ref> Consequently, political films in the U.S. have followed a trend of focusing on the flawed character of leaders, such a films like ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1940) and ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' (1995).<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\">Lindholm, p. 43</ref> Otherwise, they show the corruption of power, such as in ''[[The Candidate (1972 film)|The Candidate]]'' (1972) and ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' (1998).<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\"/> Other films, like ''A Face in a Crowd'' (1957) and ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1949), follow the warning of ''John Doe''. ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), on the other hand, are based on the premise that democracy is an illusion and Americans are the ignorant pawns of various conspiracies involving, for example, the collusion between the government and the media.<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\"/>\n\n===The depoliticizing effect of cinema===\nWhile films can be overtly political they can also depoliticize and oversimplify what is inherently complex, such as class struggle. Film, as it contributes to [[mass culture]], has been criticized{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} for reducing the concept of class to stereotypes and predictable formulas that promote superficial understandings of ideology. Such misrepresentation and the ignorance that it promotes and perpetuates has been said to make audiences and citizens vulnerable to manipulative tactics of politicians in a reality that is complex.<ref>Giroux, p. 19</ref> One of the exceptions to oversimplification and ideological flattening in cinema has been said to be ''[[Norma Rae]]'' (1979), a film that presents a truer representation than is conventional of the complexities and politics of the working-class struggle and culture at the level of everyday life.<ref>Giroux, p. 20-21</ref>\n\n===Actor-politicians===\n{{Main|List of actor-politicians}}\n\n==Television==\n\n===Role of television in United States presidential elections===\nThe [[mass media]] have always influenced the political process, but never more so than with the innovation of the television.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Du |first1=Yueying |title=From Television to Twitter: How Media Influence the Presidential Election in the United States {{!}} Center for Mobile Communication Studies |url=https://sites.bu.edu/cmcs/2017/11/16/from-television-to-twitter-how-media-influence-the-presidential-election-in-the-united-states/ |website=sites.bu.edu}}</ref> As it is the most popular means by which voters obtain information on candidates and the news in general, television is a powerful means by which political groups can influence the public.<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\">Heard, Alexander and Nelson, Michael, eds.

This expanded time slot allowed more focus to be given to presidential candidates, and network news soon became the center of national politics coverage. Because newscasts were national, the aired [[political campaign]]s were able to impact viewers across the country, enlarging the realm of influence.<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\"/>\n\nRick Shenkman also analyzes the media's impact on politics in his book, ''Just How Stupid Are We?: Facing the Truth About the American Voter'', and observes that although American voters have gained significant political power over the last 50 years, their knowledge of politics and world affairs have decreased, which makes them more vulnerable to manipulation, and claims that \"politicians have repeatedly misled voters\" by \"[[dumbing down]] of American politics via marketing, spin machines, and misinformation.\"<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\"/>\n[[File:Kennedy Nixon Debat (1960).jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard Nixon]] in the first televised presidential candidates' debate. 1960.]]\n\nThrough setting news priorities, the news media play a significant role in determining the nation's political reality; they provide the political information that will be regarded as fact and indicate to viewers how much importance to attach to each topic according to how much air time they dedicate to a given issue and the emphasis they place on it.<ref name=\"agenda\">McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media.\" ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2, 110.</ref> For example, television news is able to offer cues on topic salience by deciding what the opening story on the newscast will be or by altering the length of time devoted a story.<ref name=\"agenda\" /> When these cues are repeated broadcast after broadcast, day after day, they may be able to effectively communicate the amount of importance broadcasters want each topic to have.<ref>McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media.\" ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2.</ref>\n\n===Political influence on religion via television===\nIn his book, ''Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India,'' Arvind Rajagopal examines Hindu nationalism during the late 1980s and 1990s in India. Rajagopal analyzed the role of the media in the public's construction of national, cultural, class, and regional identity. More specifically, he studied the hegemonic role of the [[Ram Janmabhumi]] movement and how the Ram project was played out on Indian national television. In his study, Rajagopal found that the Ram project played a role in \"shaping discourses about national and cultural identities through the 1990s to the present\" in India.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\">Rajagopal, Arvind. \"Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India.\" Cambridge, United Kingdom: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 2001.</ref>\n\nRajagopal investigated the cultural and political economy of [[Television in India|television in contemporary India]]. His discussion of television revolves around the industrial and cultural politics of the serialized epic [[Ramayan]]. The serial epic, which generated unprecedented viewership, was based on the epic story of the Hindu god [[Rama|Ram]] and aired on [[Doordarshan]], India's state-run television. Rajagopal made the argument that the national telecast of the Hindu religious epic Ramayan during the late 1980s provided much of the ideological groundwork for the launch of the Ram Janmabhumi movement. To defend his argument, Rajagopal stated that \"television profoundly changes the context of politics\".<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/><sup>(p.&nbsp;24)</sup>\n\nThe epic was broadcast on national television, sponsored by the ruling [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] government. Rajagopal argues that the Congress assumed that the mere sponsorship of the epic would aid its electoral future by bringing in the majority Hindu vote. Quite the opposite happened, however. Rather, it was the electorally weak Hindu nationalist political body, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), that benefited from the serial's popularity. The BJP did so by avoiding the [[Framing (social sciences)|media effects framework]] attempted by Congress and instead articulating a complex relationship between the televised Hindu epic and its own [[Hindu nationalist]] beliefs. The BJP mobilized the public around the symbol of Ram, the lead figure of the serial, but strategically reworked the symbol via the Ram Janmabhumi movement to articulate cultural authenticity, national belonging, and a renewed sense of national purpose and direction. Articulating the temple restoration project within its electoral promise, the BJP, not surprisingly, went on to form the national government in the next general election.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;43</sup> This illustrates that, as Rajagopal argues, television is capable of profoundly impacting politics.\n\nCentral to the BJP's success was the party's strategic use of using both the media and the market, by creating merchandise such as stickers, buttons, and audio tapes centering on the key figure of the Ram. Rajagopal argues that the televised epic also dealt with the tension between the past and the present at many levels. This can be seen in the reworking of the epic story of the Ram to fit the conventions of modern commercial television. In addition to this, the epic was laced with twenty minutes of advertising both before and after the program, which helped the serial to reconstruct the past through technologies of the present.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/> This key fact highlights the power of advertisements in the media.\n\n===Television and politics around the world===\nIn the \u201cDramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt,\u201d Lila Abu-Lughod suggests that a nation's television should be studied to answer larger questions about the culture, power, and modern self-fashioning of that nation. Abu-Lughod focuses on the Egyptian nation and investigates the elements of developmentalist ideology and the dreams of national progress that dominated Egyptian television in the past. She analyzes the nation's television broadcasts and highlights the attempt to depict authentic national culture and the intentional strategies for fighting religious extremism.<ref name=\"Abu-Lughod\">Abu-Lughod, Lila (2005). ''Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt''. Chicago: The [[University of Chicago Press]].</ref>\n\nThe main cultural form that binds together the Egyptian nation is, surprisingly, television serials. These serials are melodramatic programs, similar to American soap operas but more closely tied to political and social issues than their Western counterparts. Their contents reflect the changing dynamics of Islam, gender relations, and everyday life in the Middle Eastern nation of Egypt, while at the same time trying to influence and direct these changes.<ref name=\"Abu-Lughod\"/>\n\nAnother group who studied the impact of television on politics included [[Holli Semetko]] and [[Patti Valkenburg]]. In their studies, they analyzed the framing of press and television news in European politics. For reader clarification, they provided the best working definitions of news frames as defined from a wide range of sources. News frames are \"conceptual tools which media and individuals rely on to convey, interpret and evaluate information.\"<ref>Neuman et al., 1992, p.&nbsp;60</ref> They set the parameters \"in which citizens discuss public events.\"<ref>Tuchman, 1978, p.&nbsp;IV</ref> They are \"persistent selection, emphasis, and exclusion.\"<ref>Gitlin, 1980, p.&nbsp;7</ref> Framing is selecting \"some aspects of a perceived reality\" to enhance their salience \"in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation.\"<ref>Entman, 1993, p.&nbsp;53</ref> Frames are to help audiences \"locate, perceive, identify, and label\" the flow of information around them (Goffman, 1974, p.&nbsp;21) and to \"narrow the available political alternatives.\"<ref>Tuchman, 1978, p.&nbsp;156</ref><ref name=\"Semetko\">Semetko, Holli A. and Valkenburg, Patti M. \u201cFraming European Politics: A content Analysis of Press and Television News.\u201d Journal of Communication, Vol. 50, 2000.</ref>\n\nNews frames have what is known as the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing effect]]. Framing effects are when relevant attributes of a message&nbsp;\u2013 such as its organization, content, or structure&nbsp;\u2013 make particular thoughts applicable, resulting in their activation and use in evaluations.<ref>Price et al., 1997, p.&nbsp;486</ref> Framing has shown to have large effects on people's perceptions, and has also been shown to shape public perceptions of political issues or institutions.<ref name=\"Semetko\"/>\n\nLike agenda-setting research, framing analysis focuses on the relationship between public policy issues in the news and the public perceptions of these issues. However, framing analysis \"expands beyond agenda-setting research into what people talk or think about by examining how they think and talk about issues in the news.\"<ref name=\"Semetko\"/><ref>Pan & Kosicki, 1993, p.&nbsp;70; emphasis in the original</ref> The results of Semetko and Valkenburg's research indicate that the attribution of responsibility frame was most commonly employed by the news. This particular type of framing focuses on making viewers feel a sense of responsibility, in which they feel bound to perform whatever duties are attached to the given role, and feel a sense of moral accountability for not taking on the role.<ref name=\"Semetko\"/> After understanding the attribution of responsibility frame, it is easy to see why it is such a powerful tool to news programs, as it evokes strong emotions within the viewer.\n\n==Internet==\n\n===Impact on political media===\nThe Internet - particularly in the form of the [[World Wide Web]] (the Web) - has given the world a tool for education, communication, and negotiation in political information and political roles and its use by individuals and organizations has increased and continues to increase, greatly. This rapid increase can be compared to the boom of the television and its impact on politics as a form of media.

Another advancement is its capacity to have extensive information in one place, like voting records, periodicals, press releases, opinion polls, policy statements, speeches, etc. Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of an election, for example, is more convenient than it has been in the past. Political Information available on the internet covers every major activity of American politics.

Different governments got a hold of this technology, and in 1993 the [[United States Congress]] and the [[White House]] were using this as communication as a means of communicating with the general public. During the Clinton administration a director for e-mail and electronic publishing was appointed and by the summer of 1993, the White House was receiving 800 e-mails per day.

Reaching that point, project heads began to leave to set up manufacturers. Similarly, established notables like [[International Business Machines]] (IBM) were using public funds to advance their technology from punch card sorting to advanced general purpose computers of their own around the beginning of the 1960s. None of this was about 'consumer choice' since the work was being done for government organs such as the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). It was about two and a half decades, the early 1980s, before these 'private tyrannies' were in a position to take all the results of public funding and sell them back, at considerable profit,  to the very people who had already paid for them.\n\nObserving the prophets of the '[[free market]]', such as [[Alan Greenspan]], enthusing about the 'marvels of entrepreneurial initiative and consumer choice,' Chomsky asserts, in contrast, that the contribution here during the 'costly and risky period of development' was precisely nil, almost the entire burden, without any (democratic) consultation, being placed on the taxpayer (socialized).\n\nChomsky points to the same script being followed, now, in areas such as [[biotechnology]] and [[neuroscience]] and why, from the past, we now have such 'goods' as the Internet, [[telecommunications]], [[lasers]] etc. While it may be 'nice' to have computers (or be able to command an aircraft by 'thought') the essential point is, assuming there is some real commitment to freedom (of choice) and democracy in the elites and structures of power, given a public, such as those in the 1950s, to ask what they want out of their taxes. Computers in twenty-five years or health care, good schools and jobs today ? This assumes their being informed, in good faith, of matters.\n\nChomsky summarizes that anybody or anything deeply embedded in the interests of the industrial system, with power (such as the corporations), is 'deathly afraid' of admitting such a state of affairs and that attitudes must be manipulated towards the 'appropriate' outcomes. Such manipulation is often best done in an atmosphere of [[fear mongering|fear]] and under pretence of external threat.\n\n[[Edward S. Herman]] (with Chomsky) advanced a '[[propaganda model]]' hypothesis in ''[[Manufacturing Consent]]'', in which they try to demonstrate the ways in which power and money manage to filter the news and aid governments and private interests. Earlier, political writer [[George Orwell]] had noted, \"All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news.\"<ref name=\"orwell\">{{cite book|first1=George|last1=Orwell|authorlink1=George Orwell|title=Why I Write|chapter=The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism And The English Genius|chapterurl=http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Lion_and_the_Unicorn:_Socialism_And_The_English_Genius/0.html|accessdate=21 September 2011}}</ref> ('Indirect censorship' obviates the need for obvious coercion.) This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information provided by government, business and 'experts' approved and paid for by these primary sources.\n\nHerman and Chomsky see the ideas as being cast as testable [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] such that they can be held in the light of corroboration through empirical evidence and not merely as assertions out of the blue. Examination of contemporary developments in the context of the hypotheses is encouraged.\n\nThus the general and fundamental understanding of the working of the industrial system in the modern economy, 'socialization of costs and privatization of profits', is met with corroboration from the heart of the [[market system]] (often called the free market) \u2013 a contemporary and 'polite' euphemism for [[capitalism]] according to Galbraith - for example, in the near collapse of the global banking system, beginning in 2008, spreading in 2011 to the areas of [[Government debt|sovereign debt]], requiring almost constant appeal to the '[[lender of last resort|banker of last resort]]' - the taxpayer.

Where the less influential ones are not necessarily less self-congratulatory, they are certainly more inward-looking and always carry the label of national specificity.\"<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\">Hedetoft, Ulf. \"Contemporary Cinema: Between Cultural Globalisation and National Interpretation.\" ''Cinema and Nation''. Eds. Mette Hjort and Scott Mackenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 280</ref> He goes on, however, to say that these more transnationally powerful films actually become de-nationalized as a result of its \"national-cultural currency\" more widely and easily dispersed, mixing with other cultures, becoming either a \"positive admixture\" to other countries' cultures and identities or a \"model for emulation.\"<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\"/> He compares national cinema that undergoes such processes to English becoming a global lingua Franca: the cultural sharing that results is [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] and the globalizing process is non-symmetrical.<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\"/>\n\n===Propaganda===\n{{Main|Propaganda}}\nPropaganda is a way that politics can be represented and manipulated in film. Leif Furhammar and Folke Isaksson credit Russian producers [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] with the birth of propaganda aesthetics, for which the underlying assumption was that by manipulating cinematic images representing reality, they could manipulate spectators' concepts of reality.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\">Furhammar, p. 152.</ref> Documentaries can be an even more effective form of propaganda than other [[genre]] films because the form of representation claims to mirror reality, making the manipulation of an audience that much more obscured.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/>\n\nSuch British newsreels as ''[[The Battle of the Somme]]'' of [[World War I]] were propaganda because they only showed the war from their own perspective, though it can be argued as being more honest and objective than more recent war documentaries (for they were edited without adjustments for [[drama]]tic or epic effect).{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Their photographers remained on their front lines, therefore presenting at least some truth.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> According to Furhammar and Isaksson, it was Russian filmmakers who were the \"masters of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]]\" who discovered film's power to create convincing illusion with cutting, rhythmic editing, and a didactic approach.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/>\n\n[[File:WWII Divide and Conquer 2.jpg|thumb|A scene from \"[[Divide and Conquer (newsreel)|Divide and Conquer]]\", the third installment of [[Why We Fight]], 1943.]]\nWhen sound became possible, documentaries have been said to become more politically powerful with the use of speakers' voices and music.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> In Nazi Germany, newsreels were just as important as feature films, while in Fascist Italy propaganda was mostly limited to documentaries.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> A comparison of the first three installments of the American series ''[[Why We Fight]]'' and the Nazi documentary ''[[Sieg im Westen]]'' (''Victory in the West'') demonstrates how convincing even two opposing interpretations of the same events can be.{{Original research inline|date=June 2013}} The first covers years in a couple of hours but its density disguises any omission of truth while the latter manages to depict war with real images but without blood or death. The same is found in documentaries about the Spanish Civil War.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 153\">Furhammar, p. 153.</ref>\n\nFalsification of political matter in documentaries can be created by lifting shots of events other than the one being dealt with and including them in the film so that they appear to be a part of the \"reality\" it claims to represent. The [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], for example, did this with ''Operation Abolition''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeiW63M3bcI \"Operation Abolition,\" 1960 - YouTube]</ref><ref>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894425-1,00.html Operation Abolition]\", ''Time'' magazine, 1961.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsCfYYi2FE Operation Abolition (1960) - YouTube]</ref><ref>\"[https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/operation-abolition/ Operation Abolition]\", video.google.com and ''Time'' magazine, Friday, Mar. 17, 1961.</ref> in 1960 and Nazi newsreels depicted scenes of the Allies' defeat at Dieppe as real scenes from the Normandy invasion just a few days afterward to convince audience of the Reich's success.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Audience's political affiliations can also be manipulated by actually staging the ostensibly real events as the 1944 Nazi picture ''The F\u00fchrer Gives the Jews a Town'' did.<ref>Furhammar, p. 154.</ref>\n\n[[World War II]] propaganda persisted 30 years after [[Dachau]] and [[Auschwitz]] such as in the thinly disguised fascist Italian film ''[[The Night Porter]]'' (1974). The film sought to legitimize the Nazis' genocide, while glorifying sadism, brutality, and machismo.<ref>Giroux, p. 29</ref> What amazes [[Henry Giroux]], as he explains in \"Breaking into the Movies,\" is that such blatant ideological messages were ignored by critics and the general public. That society may be incapable of testing the present against the past has implications for post-industrial oppression in the West and the strategies for resisting it. Despite the writings of [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Paulo Freire]], the majority of Americans (at least) do not recognize how important class [[hegemony]], or cultural domination, is in nations where populations are kept obedient to governments through ideological means.<ref name=\"Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31\">Giroux, p. 31</ref> He argues, \"We are not only victims in the political and material sense, but are also tied emotionally and intellectually to the prevailing ruling-class norms and values.\"<ref name=\"Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31\"/>\n\nThough feature forms of propaganda lack documentaries' ostensible authenticity they can retain political power because directors' resources are less limited and they can create the reality of the film.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} They further compensate for lack of credibility with intensity.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 153\"/>\n\n===Anti-politics in film===\nDespite the strong patriotism and nationalism of Americans, overtly political films have never been popular in the U.S. while films that have represented politics inconspicuously (such as in the form of propaganda) have remained popular.<ref>Lindholm, p. 32</ref> Besides [[Frank Capra]], no other major American filmmaker has seriously presented central themes of citizenship, participation, and responsibility in civic life amidst the complexities and corruption of the political world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} While Capra sought to \"develop a positive American cinematic vocabulary for political action\" of the individual, as Charles Lindholm and John A. Hall describe, he ultimately failed.<ref>Lindholm, p. 33</ref>\n\n[[File:James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington trailer 2.JPG|thumb|A scene from Capra's ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', 1939]]Capra's films are characterized by the same basic formula according to which the fundamental American values of fairness and honesty are challenged by the corruption and cruelty of politics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Ronald Reagan later extensively quoted the speech made by Mr. Deeds in ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936) in which he expresses his disgust with the complexities of politics and calls for individual goodness.<ref>Lindholm, p. 34</ref> In his next film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', (1939) Capra reinforces the integrity and decency of the everyman who can transcend politics despite the power and crookedness of special interest groups.<ref>Lindholm, p. 34-35</ref> After the hero of ''[[Meet John Doe]]'' realizes his need for others, he discovers and attempts to expose a fascist bidder for presidency planning to take advantage of his club support. He fails, however, in the midst of a violent mob with the depressing conclusion that the American public is a credulous crowd, susceptible to manipulation until the John Doe club members come begging his forgiveness and convince him to return to lead them.<ref>Lindholm, p. 36</ref>\n\nThe ending of ''John Doe'' was unsuccessful amongst audiences and critics, discouraging any more political films for Capra and no films of merit after ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. Capra's ultimate fall from filmmaking and his advice that all American filmmakers should forget politics if they do not want to cut themselves in half signify the challenge filmmakers face when they attempt to criticize politics.<ref>Lindholm, p. 40</ref> Lindholm and Hall observe that \"the problems that defeated Capra have also undercut later attempts by American filmmakers to portray the complex relationship between individualism and citizenship in the United States\" and claim that Hollywood has instead adopted the paranoia of politics that Capra had tried to overcome.<ref>Lindholm, p. 42</ref> Consequently, political films in the U.S. have followed a trend of focusing on the flawed character of leaders, such a films like ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1940) and ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' (1995).<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\">Lindholm, p. 43</ref> Otherwise, they show the corruption of power, such as in ''[[The Candidate (1972 film)|The Candidate]]'' (1972) and ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' (1998).<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\"/> Other films, like ''A Face in a Crowd'' (1957) and ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1949), follow the warning of ''John Doe''. ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), on the other hand, are based on the premise that democracy is an illusion and Americans are the ignorant pawns of various conspiracies involving, for example, the collusion between the government and the media.<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\"/>\n\n===The depoliticizing effect of cinema===\nWhile films can be overtly political they can also depoliticize and oversimplify what is inherently complex, such as class struggle. Film, as it contributes to [[mass culture]], has been criticized{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} for reducing the concept of class to stereotypes and predictable formulas that promote superficial understandings of ideology. Such misrepresentation and the ignorance that it promotes and perpetuates has been said to make audiences and citizens vulnerable to manipulative tactics of politicians in a reality that is complex.<ref>Giroux, p. 19</ref> One of the exceptions to oversimplification and ideological flattening in cinema has been said to be ''[[Norma Rae]]'' (1979), a film that presents a truer representation than is conventional of the complexities and politics of the working-class struggle and culture at the level of everyday life.<ref>Giroux, p. 20-21</ref>\n\n===Actor-politicians===\n{{Main|List of actor-politicians}}\n\n==Television==\n\n===Role of television in United States presidential elections===\nThe [[mass media]] have always influenced the political process, but never more so than with the innovation of the television.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Du |first1=Yueying |title=From Television to Twitter: How Media Influence the Presidential Election in the United States {{!}} Center for Mobile Communication Studies |url=https://sites.bu.edu/cmcs/2017/11/16/from-television-to-twitter-how-media-influence-the-presidential-election-in-the-united-states/ |website=sites.bu.edu}}</ref> As it is the most popular means by which voters obtain information on candidates and the news in general, television is a powerful means by which political groups can influence the public.<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\">Heard, Alexander and Nelson, Michael, eds. ''Presidential Selection.'' United States of America: [[Duke University Press]], 1987. {{ISBN|0-8223-0750-2}}</ref>\n\nThis transformation first kicked off in the early 1960s, when newscast programs were increased to a thirty-minute programs, which allowed for greater news coverage and capacity. This expanded time slot allowed more focus to be given to presidential candidates, and network news soon became the center of national politics coverage. Because newscasts were national, the aired [[political campaign]]s were able to impact viewers across the country, enlarging the realm of influence.<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\"/>\n\nRick Shenkman also analyzes the media's impact on politics in his book, ''Just How Stupid Are We?: Facing the Truth About the American Voter'', and observes that although American voters have gained significant political power over the last 50 years, their knowledge of politics and world affairs have decreased, which makes them more vulnerable to manipulation, and claims that \"politicians have repeatedly misled voters\" by \"[[dumbing down]] of American politics via marketing, spin machines, and misinformation.\"<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\"/>\n[[File:Kennedy Nixon Debat (1960).jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard Nixon]] in the first televised presidential candidates' debate. 1960.]]\n\nThrough setting news priorities, the news media play a significant role in determining the nation's political reality; they provide the political information that will be regarded as fact and indicate to viewers how much importance to attach to each topic according to how much air time they dedicate to a given issue and the emphasis they place on it.<ref name=\"agenda\">McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media.\" ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2, 110.</ref> For example, television news is able to offer cues on topic salience by deciding what the opening story on the newscast will be or by altering the length of time devoted a story.<ref name=\"agenda\" /> When these cues are repeated broadcast after broadcast, day after day, they may be able to effectively communicate the amount of importance broadcasters want each topic to have.<ref>McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media.\" ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2.</ref>\n\n===Political influence on religion via television===\nIn his book, ''Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India,'' Arvind Rajagopal examines Hindu nationalism during the late 1980s and 1990s in India. Rajagopal analyzed the role of the media in the public's construction of national, cultural, class, and regional identity. More specifically, he studied the hegemonic role of the [[Ram Janmabhumi]] movement and how the Ram project was played out on Indian national television. In his study, Rajagopal found that the Ram project played a role in \"shaping discourses about national and cultural identities through the 1990s to the present\" in India.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\">Rajagopal, Arvind. \"Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India.\" Cambridge, United Kingdom: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 2001.</ref>\n\nRajagopal investigated the cultural and political economy of [[Television in India|television in contemporary India]]. His discussion of television revolves around the industrial and cultural politics of the serialized epic [[Ramayan]]. The serial epic, which generated unprecedented viewership, was based on the epic story of the Hindu god [[Rama|Ram]] and aired on [[Doordarshan]], India's state-run television. Rajagopal made the argument that the national telecast of the Hindu religious epic Ramayan during the late 1980s provided much of the ideological groundwork for the launch of the Ram Janmabhumi movement. To defend his argument, Rajagopal stated that \"television profoundly changes the context of politics\".<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/><sup>(p.&nbsp;24)</sup>\n\nThe epic was broadcast on national television, sponsored by the ruling [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] government. Rajagopal argues that the Congress assumed that the mere sponsorship of the epic would aid its electoral future by bringing in the majority Hindu vote. Quite the opposite happened, however. Rather, it was the electorally weak Hindu nationalist political body, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), that benefited from the serial's popularity. The BJP did so by avoiding the [[Framing (social sciences)|media effects framework]] attempted by Congress and instead articulating a complex relationship between the televised Hindu epic and its own [[Hindu nationalist]] beliefs. The BJP mobilized the public around the symbol of Ram, the lead figure of the serial, but strategically reworked the symbol via the Ram Janmabhumi movement to articulate cultural authenticity, national belonging, and a renewed sense of national purpose and direction. Articulating the temple restoration project within its electoral promise, the BJP, not surprisingly, went on to form the national government in the next general election.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;43</sup> This illustrates that, as Rajagopal argues, television is capable of profoundly impacting politics.\n\nCentral to the BJP's success was the party's strategic use of using both the media and the market, by creating merchandise such as stickers, buttons, and audio tapes centering on the key figure of the Ram. Rajagopal argues that the televised epic also dealt with the tension between the past and the present at many levels. This can be seen in the reworking of the epic story of the Ram to fit the conventions of modern commercial television. In addition to this, the epic was laced with twenty minutes of advertising both before and after the program, which helped the serial to reconstruct the past through technologies of the present.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/> This key fact highlights the power of advertisements in the media.\n\n===Television and politics around the world===\nIn the \u201cDramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt,\u201d Lila Abu-Lughod suggests that a nation's television should be studied to answer larger questions about the culture, power, and modern self-fashioning of that nation. Abu-Lughod focuses on the Egyptian nation and investigates the elements of developmentalist ideology and the dreams of national progress that dominated Egyptian television in the past. She analyzes the nation's television broadcasts and highlights the attempt to depict authentic national culture and the intentional strategies for fighting religious extremism.<ref name=\"Abu-Lughod\">Abu-Lughod, Lila (2005). ''Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt''. Chicago: The [[University of Chicago Press]].</ref>\n\nThe main cultural form that binds together the Egyptian nation is, surprisingly, television serials. These serials are melodramatic programs, similar to American soap operas but more closely tied to political and social issues than their Western counterparts. Their contents reflect the changing dynamics of Islam, gender relations, and everyday life in the Middle Eastern nation of Egypt, while at the same time trying to influence and direct these changes.<ref name=\"Abu-Lughod\"/>\n\nAnother group who studied the impact of television on politics included [[Holli Semetko]] and [[Patti Valkenburg]]. In their studies, they analyzed the framing of press and television news in European politics. For reader clarification, they provided the best working definitions of news frames as defined from a wide range of sources. News frames are \"conceptual tools which media and individuals rely on to convey, interpret and evaluate information.\"<ref>Neuman et al., 1992, p.&nbsp;60</ref> They set the parameters \"in which citizens discuss public events.\"<ref>Tuchman, 1978, p.&nbsp;IV</ref> They are \"persistent selection, emphasis, and exclusion.\"<ref>Gitlin, 1980, p.&nbsp;7</ref> Framing is selecting \"some aspects of a perceived reality\" to enhance their salience \"in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation.\"<ref>Entman, 1993, p.&nbsp;53</ref> Frames are to help audiences \"locate, perceive, identify, and label\" the flow of information around them (Goffman, 1974, p.&nbsp;21) and to \"narrow the available political alternatives.\"<ref>Tuchman, 1978, p.&nbsp;156</ref><ref name=\"Semetko\">Semetko, Holli A. and Valkenburg, Patti M. \u201cFraming European Politics: A content Analysis of Press and Television News.\u201d Journal of Communication, Vol. 50, 2000.</ref>\n\nNews frames have what is known as the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing effect]]. Framing effects are when relevant attributes of a message&nbsp;\u2013 such as its organization, content, or structure&nbsp;\u2013 make particular thoughts applicable, resulting in their activation and use in evaluations.<ref>Price et al., 1997, p.&nbsp;486</ref> Framing has shown to have large effects on people's perceptions, and has also been shown to shape public perceptions of political issues or institutions.<ref name=\"Semetko\"/>\n\nLike agenda-setting research, framing analysis focuses on the relationship between public policy issues in the news and the public perceptions of these issues. However, framing analysis \"expands beyond agenda-setting research into what people talk or think about by examining how they think and talk about issues in the news.\"<ref name=\"Semetko\"/><ref>Pan & Kosicki, 1993, p.&nbsp;70; emphasis in the original</ref> The results of Semetko and Valkenburg's research indicate that the attribution of responsibility frame was most commonly employed by the news.

Another advancement is its capacity to have extensive information in one place, like voting records, periodicals, press releases, opinion polls, policy statements, speeches, etc. Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of an election, for example, is more convenient than it has been in the past.

The boom of e-mail hit the Internet and the public in the mid-1990s as a way to keep in touch with family and friends. Different governments got a hold of this technology, and in 1993 the [[United States Congress]] and the [[White House]] were using this as communication as a means of communicating with the general public. During the Clinton administration a director for e-mail and electronic publishing was appointed and by the summer of 1993, the White House was receiving 800 e-mails per day. In order to deal with the influx of e-mail a more sophisticated system was put in.

It\u2019s not specifically military.}}</ref> and argues that its embedded behavior is not just about the \"military\" but is about ensuring that the modern economy, of which that behavior (emptied of particularly military connotations) is at the heart, is nothing much to do with [[Political freedom|freedom]] (of choice) or [[democracy]] either.\n\nUsing the technology of [[computing]] as a prime example, Chomsky notes that about the time [[Dwight Eisenhower]] was making his speech about the putative MIC, institutions like [[Harvard University]] and his own, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), were working, using government funds (taxpayer dollars), to reduce roomfuls of machinery into a package that could be sold as a [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] (computer). Reaching that point, project heads began to leave to set up manufacturers. Similarly, established notables like [[International Business Machines]] (IBM) were using public funds to advance their technology from punch card sorting to advanced general purpose computers of their own around the beginning of the 1960s. None of this was about 'consumer choice' since the work was being done for government organs such as the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). It was about two and a half decades, the early 1980s, before these 'private tyrannies' were in a position to take all the results of public funding and sell them back, at considerable profit,  to the very people who had already paid for them.\n\nObserving the prophets of the '[[free market]]', such as [[Alan Greenspan]], enthusing about the 'marvels of entrepreneurial initiative and consumer choice,' Chomsky asserts, in contrast, that the contribution here during the 'costly and risky period of development' was precisely nil, almost the entire burden, without any (democratic) consultation, being placed on the taxpayer (socialized).\n\nChomsky points to the same script being followed, now, in areas such as [[biotechnology]] and [[neuroscience]] and why, from the past, we now have such 'goods' as the Internet, [[telecommunications]], [[lasers]] etc. While it may be 'nice' to have computers (or be able to command an aircraft by 'thought') the essential point is, assuming there is some real commitment to freedom (of choice) and democracy in the elites and structures of power, given a public, such as those in the 1950s, to ask what they want out of their taxes. Computers in twenty-five years or health care, good schools and jobs today ? This assumes their being informed, in good faith, of matters.\n\nChomsky summarizes that anybody or anything deeply embedded in the interests of the industrial system, with power (such as the corporations), is 'deathly afraid' of admitting such a state of affairs and that attitudes must be manipulated towards the 'appropriate' outcomes. Such manipulation is often best done in an atmosphere of [[fear mongering|fear]] and under pretence of external threat.\n\n[[Edward S. Herman]] (with Chomsky) advanced a '[[propaganda model]]' hypothesis in ''[[Manufacturing Consent]]'', in which they try to demonstrate the ways in which power and money manage to filter the news and aid governments and private interests. Earlier, political writer [[George Orwell]] had noted, \"All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news.\"<ref name=\"orwell\">{{cite book|first1=George|last1=Orwell|authorlink1=George Orwell|title=Why I Write|chapter=The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism And The English Genius|chapterurl=http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Lion_and_the_Unicorn:_Socialism_And_The_English_Genius/0.html|accessdate=21 September 2011}}</ref> ('Indirect censorship' obviates the need for obvious coercion.) This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information provided by government, business and 'experts' approved and paid for by these primary sources.\n\nHerman and Chomsky see the ideas as being cast as testable [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] such that they can be held in the light of corroboration through empirical evidence and not merely as assertions out of the blue. Examination of contemporary developments in the context of the hypotheses is encouraged.\n\nThus the general and fundamental understanding of the working of the industrial system in the modern economy, 'socialization of costs and privatization of profits', is met with corroboration from the heart of the [[market system]] (often called the free market) \u2013 a contemporary and 'polite' euphemism for [[capitalism]] according to Galbraith - for example, in the near collapse of the global banking system, beginning in 2008, spreading in 2011 to the areas of [[Government debt|sovereign debt]], requiring almost constant appeal to the '[[lender of last resort|banker of last resort]]' - the taxpayer. Under debt restructuring, 'good debt' is returned to private hands as soon as possible and the taxpayer is left saddled with the 'bad debt' which is probably unrecoverable.<ref name=\"chomsky2\">{{cite news|first=Sameer|last=Dossani|title=Chomsky:Understanding the Crisis -- Markets, the State and Hypocrisy|url=http://chomsky.info/interviews/20090210.htm|work=Foreign Policy in Focus|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=It's true across the board from electronics to pharmaceuticals to the new biology-based industries.
