When the hooks were fully engaged, an outside lever on the cargo door could be depressed to drive a set of locking pins through the hooks to hold them in place. The NTSB investigation found that it was possible to close the outside lever without the hooks being fully engaged, and there would be no outward signs that the locking mechanism was not engaged; the cargo-door indicator in the cockpit would still register the door as being secured without hooks and locking pins being in the closed position. This combination of factors caused Flight 96 to take off without its aft cargo door being fully locked. Following the Windsor accident investigation, the NTSB made several recommendations, including repairing the faulty cargo door design to make it impossible for baggage handlers to close the cargo door lever without the locking pins being fully engaged. It was also recommended that vents be installed in the cabin floor, so that in case of an explosive decompression, the pressure difference between the cabin and cargo bay could quickly be equalized without collapsing the cabin floor and damaging critical control systems.<ref name=aci /> Although many carriers voluntarily modified the cargo doors, no [[airworthiness directive]] was issued to require reworking of the locking system, due to a [[gentlemen's agreement]] between the head of the FAA, [[John H. Shaffer]], and the head of McDonnell Douglas's aircraft division, Jackson McGowen. McDonnell Douglas did make modifications to the cargo door, but the basic design remained unchanged and problems persisted.<ref name=aci />\n\n====Turkish Airlines Flight 981====\n{{main|Turkish Airlines Flight 981}}\nOn March 3, 1974, an almost identical cargo-door blowout caused [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] to crash into a forest near the town of [[Ermenonville]], France, shortly after leaving Paris.<ref name=aci />  All 346 people on board died;<ref name=TA_Flt_981/> it was one of the deadliest air crashes of all time.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19740304&id=p-tRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RnMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4842,3446994 \"Plane crash in France kills 346\"].

The loss of hydraulic pressure to the [[leading edge slat]] actuators caused the slats to retract due to [[aerodynamic force]]s, increasing the left wing's stall speed above the engine failure [[climb out]] speed being used by the pilots.

American Airlines mechanics had removed the engine and its pylon as a unit, rather than removing the engine from the pylon, then removing the pylon from the wing, as recommended by McDonnell Douglas. The faulty procedure was done using a [[forklift]], which resulted in inadvertent structural damage. It was subsequently discovered that this short-cut procedure, believed to save many man-hours on maintenance, was being used by three major airlines, although McDonnell Douglas had advised against it.<ref name=AAR79-17>[http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/aircraft-accident-reports/AAR79-17.pdf \"Aircraft Accident report, DC-10-10, N110A, NTSB, 1979\"].

The panel's report, published in June 1980, found \"critical deficiencies in the way the Government certifies the safety of American-built airliners\".

The flight crew, led by Captain [[Alfred C. Haynes|Al Haynes]] and assisted by DC-10 flight instructor [[Deadheading (aviation)|flying as a passenger]] ([[Dennis E. Fitch|Dennis E. \"Denny\" Fitch]]), performed an emergency landing by constantly adjusting the thrust of the remaining two engines.

All three hydraulic systems were in close proximity, directly beneath the tail engine. The #2 engine explosion hurled fragments that ruptured all three lines, resulting in total loss of control to the elevators, ailerons, spoilers, horizontal stabilizer, rudder, flaps and slats.<ref name=ntsb_AAR-90-06>\"NTSB/AAR-90/06, Aircraft Accident Report United Airlines Flight 232, McDonnell Douglas DC-10-40, Sioux Gateway Airport, Sioux City, Iowa, July 19, 1989\" [http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/summary/AAR9006.html summary], [http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR90-06.pdf report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104033524/http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR90-06.pdf |date=January 4, 2011}}.

Approaching V1 in the takeoff roll, the recapping tread of the No. 2 tire on the left main landing gear separated from the tire and the resulting overload caused that tire to blow out. That in turn, imposed an overload on the No. 1 tire on the same axle, resulting in a second blowout almost immediately after the first blowout. Shrapnel from the rims of the failed tires then damaged the No. 5 tire on the left main gear, causing it to also blow out. The blowouts ruptured a fuel tank, which combined with the excessive heat from the aborted take off maneuver, resulted in a massive fire. Two passengers were killed in the ensuing evacuation and two died later from injuries sustained in the accident.\n* October 31, 1979: [[Western Airlines Flight 2605]], a DC-10-10, collided with construction equipment after landing on a closed runway at Mexico City International Airport, killing 72 of the 88 people on board and one person on the ground.

The flight crew failed to monitor their flight instruments, so they did not immediately recognize that the plane was in a stalled condition. Instead, they blamed the heavy buffeting on the #3 engine, which they shut down, while continuing to hold the nose up. The plane continued to descend for one minute in a fully stalled condition, until the pilots lowered the nose and began a proper stall recovery procedure, which was completed at 18,900&nbsp;ft. The #3 engine was then restarted, the declaration of emergency was canceled and the flight continued to [[Miami, Florida]]. Ground inspection revealed four feet missing from each of the outboard elevator tips, including the balance weights.  The NTSB concluded that the sustained stall buffeting produced a dynamic structural overload on the elevator, which resulted in the failure of the elevator tips and balance weights. Further, the NTSB concluded that the autopilot had improperly been placed in vertical speed mode. That forced the AP to keep increasing the angle of attack to maintain the preselected vertical speed number, because maximum available engine thrust declined (normally) with increasing altitude. That caused the airspeed to fall below the stall speed of the aircraft.<ref>[http://www.fss.aero/accident-reports/dvdfiles/US/1979-11-11-US.pdf  \"In-flight upset, Aeromexico, DC-10-30, XA-DUH, over Luxembourg, Europe, November 11, 1979\"].

The door relied on a set of heavy steel hooks to secure it against the door frame. When the hooks were fully engaged, an outside lever on the cargo door could be depressed to drive a set of locking pins through the hooks to hold them in place. The NTSB investigation found that it was possible to close the outside lever without the hooks being fully engaged, and there would be no outward signs that the locking mechanism was not engaged; the cargo-door indicator in the cockpit would still register the door as being secured without hooks and locking pins being in the closed position. This combination of factors caused Flight 96 to take off without its aft cargo door being fully locked. Following the Windsor accident investigation, the NTSB made several recommendations, including repairing the faulty cargo door design to make it impossible for baggage handlers to close the cargo door lever without the locking pins being fully engaged. It was also recommended that vents be installed in the cabin floor, so that in case of an explosive decompression, the pressure difference between the cabin and cargo bay could quickly be equalized without collapsing the cabin floor and damaging critical control systems.<ref name=aci /> Although many carriers voluntarily modified the cargo doors, no [[airworthiness directive]] was issued to require reworking of the locking system, due to a [[gentlemen's agreement]] between the head of the FAA, [[John H. Shaffer]], and the head of McDonnell Douglas's aircraft division, Jackson McGowen. McDonnell Douglas did make modifications to the cargo door, but the basic design remained unchanged and problems persisted.<ref name=aci />\n\n====Turkish Airlines Flight 981====\n{{main|Turkish Airlines Flight 981}}\nOn March 3, 1974, an almost identical cargo-door blowout caused [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] to crash into a forest near the town of [[Ermenonville]], France, shortly after leaving Paris.<ref name=aci />  All 346 people on board died;<ref name=TA_Flt_981/> it was one of the deadliest air crashes of all time.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19740304&id=p-tRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RnMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4842,3446994 \"Plane crash in France kills 346\"].

The loss of hydraulic pressure to the [[leading edge slat]] actuators caused the slats to retract due to [[aerodynamic force]]s, increasing the left wing's stall speed above the engine failure [[climb out]] speed being used by the pilots.  With the left wing stalled and further destabilized by [[asymmetric thrust]], the DC-10 rapidly rolled to the left, sharply descended, and crashed, killing all 271 people on board and two individuals on the ground.<ref name=Endres_p62>Endres 1998, p. 62.</ref> The loss of Flight 191 remains the deadliest aviation accident in U.S. history.

American Airlines mechanics had removed the engine and its pylon as a unit, rather than removing the engine from the pylon, then removing the pylon from the wing, as recommended by McDonnell Douglas. The faulty procedure was done using a [[forklift]], which resulted in inadvertent structural damage. It was subsequently discovered that this short-cut procedure, believed to save many man-hours on maintenance, was being used by three major airlines, although McDonnell Douglas had advised against it.<ref name=AAR79-17>[http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/aircraft-accident-reports/AAR79-17.pdf \"Aircraft Accident report, DC-10-10, N110A, NTSB, 1979\"].

The panel's report, published in June 1980, found \"critical deficiencies in the way the Government certifies the safety of American-built airliners\".

The number two (tail) engine suffered an uncontained fan disk failure in flight, which damaged all three hydraulic systems and rendered the hydraulic flight controls inoperable. The flight crew, led by Captain [[Alfred C. Haynes|Al Haynes]] and assisted by DC-10 flight instructor [[Deadheading (aviation)|flying as a passenger]] ([[Dennis E. Fitch|Dennis E. \"Denny\" Fitch]]), performed an emergency landing by constantly adjusting the thrust of the remaining two engines. The crew managed to fly the aircraft onto the runway in a partially controlled manner, and 185 of the 296 people on board survived (111 died) despite the destruction of the aircraft during the crash landing.<ref name=ntsb_AAR-90-06/>\n\nThe DC-10 included no cable backup for the hydraulic-powered flight controls because it was considered nearly impossible for three hydraulic systems to fail during one flight, and that the control surfaces were too large to be moved without hydraulic assistance. All three hydraulic systems were in close proximity, directly beneath the tail engine. The #2 engine explosion hurled fragments that ruptured all three lines, resulting in total loss of control to the elevators, ailerons, spoilers, horizontal stabilizer, rudder, flaps and slats.<ref name=ntsb_AAR-90-06>\"NTSB/AAR-90/06, Aircraft Accident Report United Airlines Flight 232, McDonnell Douglas DC-10-40, Sioux Gateway Airport, Sioux City, Iowa, July 19, 1989\" [http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/summary/AAR9006.html summary], [http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR90-06.pdf report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104033524/http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR90-06.pdf |date=January 4, 2011}}.

Approaching V1 in the takeoff roll, the recapping tread of the No. 2 tire on the left main landing gear separated from the tire and the resulting overload caused that tire to blow out. That in turn, imposed an overload on the No. 1 tire on the same axle, resulting in a second blowout almost immediately after the first blowout. Shrapnel from the rims of the failed tires then damaged the No. 5 tire on the left main gear, causing it to also blow out. The blowouts ruptured a fuel tank, which combined with the excessive heat from the aborted take off maneuver, resulted in a massive fire. Two passengers were killed in the ensuing evacuation and two died later from injuries sustained in the accident.\n* October 31, 1979: [[Western Airlines Flight 2605]], a DC-10-10, collided with construction equipment after landing on a closed runway at Mexico City International Airport, killing 72 of the 88 people on board and one person on the ground.

The flight crew failed to monitor their flight instruments, so they did not immediately recognize that the plane was in a stalled condition. Instead, they blamed the heavy buffeting on the #3 engine, which they shut down, while continuing to hold the nose up. The plane continued to descend for one minute in a fully stalled condition, until the pilots lowered the nose and began a proper stall recovery procedure, which was completed at 18,900&nbsp;ft. The #3 engine was then restarted, the declaration of emergency was canceled and the flight continued to [[Miami, Florida]]. Ground inspection revealed four feet missing from each of the outboard elevator tips, including the balance weights.  The NTSB concluded that the sustained stall buffeting produced a dynamic structural overload on the elevator, which resulted in the failure of the elevator tips and balance weights. Further, the NTSB concluded that the autopilot had improperly been placed in vertical speed mode. That forced the AP to keep increasing the angle of attack to maintain the preselected vertical speed number, because maximum available engine thrust declined (normally) with increasing altitude. That caused the airspeed to fall below the stall speed of the aircraft.<ref>[http://www.fss.aero/accident-reports/dvdfiles/US/1979-11-11-US.pdf  \"In-flight upset, Aeromexico, DC-10-30, XA-DUH, over Luxembourg, Europe, November 11, 1979\"].

Under the [[law of war]], it is referred to civilians who perished or suffered wounds as a result of [[war]]time acts. In both cases, they can be associated with the outcome of any form of action regardless of whether civilians were targeted directly or not.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Casualties of a mass panic - Chungking, China.jpg|thumb|left|Casualties of a mass panic during a June 1941 Japanese [[bombing of Chongqing]].<ref>[[Herbert Bix]], ''[[Hirohito and the making of modern Japan]]'', 2001, p. 364</ref> More than 5,000 civilians died during the first two days of air raids in 1939.]]\nIn times of armed conflict, despite numerous advancements in technology, the [[European Union]]\u2019s [[European Security Strategy]], adopted by the [[European Council]] in Brussels in December 2003, stated that since 1990, almost 4 million people have died in wars, 90% of them civilians.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} However, [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF) reports that civilian fatalities have climbed from 5 per cent at the turn of the century to more than 90 per cent in the wars of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patterns in conflict: Civilians are now the target|url=http://www.unicef.org/graca/patterns.htm|website=www.unicef.org}}</ref>\n\nGenerating reliable assessments of casualties of war is a notoriously complex process. Civilian casualties present particular difficulties. One problem is that the attribution of the label \u2018civilian\u2019 is contested in some cases. On the surface, the definition of a civilian, at least in the context of international armed conflicts, is relatively simple: a civilian is any person who is not a member of the armed forces and is not a combatant in situation of armed conflict. To make effective use of such statistics as there are about civilian casualties of war, it is necessary to be explicit about the criteria for inclusion. All too often, there is a lack of clarity about which of the following categories of civilian casualties are included in any given set of figures.<ref name=\"JU\">[https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/user/1044/Survival_Jun-Jul_2010_-_AR_on_lives___statistics_-_non-printable.pdf Lives and Statistics: Are 90% of War Victims Civilians?]</ref>\n:1. Those killed as a direct effect of war;\n:2. Those injured as a direct effect of war;\n:3. Those dying, whether during or after a war, from indirect effects of war such as disease, malnutrition and lawlessness, and who would not have been expected to die at such rates from such causes in the absence of the war;\n:4. Victims of one-sided violence, such as when states slaughter their own citizens in connection with a war; \n:5. Victims of [[Wartime sexual violence|rape and other forms of sexual violence in connection with a war]];\n:6. Those uprooted in a war \u2013 that is, [[refugees]] and [[Internally Displaced Persons]] (IDPs);\n:7 Those who, even after a war is over, die prematurely from injuries sustained in war.\n\nThe inclusion of people in each of these categories may be defensible, but needs to be explicit. Each category presents its own methodological problems. In the case of people dying from indirect effects (category 3), much careful work is needed to distinguish between \u2018expected\u2019 and \u2018excess\u2019 levels. of mortality. In the case of victims of sexual crimes (category 5) there could be an argument for including not only direct crimes by combatants, but also 'indirect\u2019 crimes due to general social collapse. In the case of those uprooted in war (category 6), the implication that refugees and IDPs always count as war victims is too simple. Some may be fleeing one-sided violence from a repressive state apparatus, natural calamity, or general social breakdown. Moreover, in certain episodes, such as the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], the [[Kosovo War]] of 1999, and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan War of 2001]], military campaigns have enabled large numbers of refugees to return home. Indeed, in the 1971 and 1999 wars, refugee return was a stated reason for launching hostilities. Yet this key observation finds remarkably little reflection in the literature about the casualties of contemporary war. A focus on the numbers of those uprooted in war is especially problematic as those who are trapped in conflict zones may in fact be worse off than those uprooted, but seldom feature in statistics. Figures for war deaths and for war-related migration should be presented separately, not amalgamated.<ref name=\"JU\" />\n\n==International law==\n\nFollowing the Second World War, a series of treaties governing the laws of war were adopted starting in 1949. These [[Geneva Conventions]] would come into force, in no small part, because of a general reaction against the practices of the Second World War. Although the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] attempted to erect some legal defenses for civilians in time of [[war]], the bulk of the Fourth Convention devoted to explicating civilian rights in [[occupied territories]], and no explicit attention is paid to the problems of [[bombardment]] and the hazardous effects in the [[combat|combat-zone]].<ref>{{cite book |page=[https://archive.org/details/moralprinciplesn0000lack/page/213 213] |title=Moral Principles and Nuclear Weapons |author=Douglas P.

An [[Casus belli|act of war]] is deemed proportional in Just War theory if the overall destruction expected from the use of force is outweighed by the projected good to be achieved.<ref>http://www.usccb.org/sdwp/international/justwar.htm</ref> This view is a war-adapted version of [[utilitarianism]], the moral system which advocates that the morally correct action is the one that does the most good.\n\nHowever, [[moral philosophers]] often contest this approach to war. Such theorists advocate [[Moral absolutism|absolutism]], which holds there are various ethical rules that are, as the name implies, absolute. One such rule is that [[non-combatants]] cannot be attacked because they are, by definition, not partaking in combat; to attack non-combatants anyway, regardless of the expected outcome, is to deny them [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]].

Under the [[law of war]], it is referred to civilians who perished or suffered wounds as a result of [[war]]time acts. In both cases, they can be associated with the outcome of any form of action regardless of whether civilians were targeted directly or not.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Casualties of a mass panic - Chungking, China.jpg|thumb|left|Casualties of a mass panic during a June 1941 Japanese [[bombing of Chongqing]].<ref>[[Herbert Bix]], ''[[Hirohito and the making of modern Japan]]'', 2001, p. 364</ref> More than 5,000 civilians died during the first two days of air raids in 1939.]]\nIn times of armed conflict, despite numerous advancements in technology, the [[European Union]]\u2019s [[European Security Strategy]], adopted by the [[European Council]] in Brussels in December 2003, stated that since 1990, almost 4 million people have died in wars, 90% of them civilians.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} However, [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF) reports that civilian fatalities have climbed from 5 per cent at the turn of the century to more than 90 per cent in the wars of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patterns in conflict: Civilians are now the target|url=http://www.unicef.org/graca/patterns.htm|website=www.unicef.org}}</ref>\n\nGenerating reliable assessments of casualties of war is a notoriously complex process. Civilian casualties present particular difficulties. One problem is that the attribution of the label \u2018civilian\u2019 is contested in some cases. On the surface, the definition of a civilian, at least in the context of international armed conflicts, is relatively simple: a civilian is any person who is not a member of the armed forces and is not a combatant in situation of armed conflict. To make effective use of such statistics as there are about civilian casualties of war, it is necessary to be explicit about the criteria for inclusion. All too often, there is a lack of clarity about which of the following categories of civilian casualties are included in any given set of figures.<ref name=\"JU\">[https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/user/1044/Survival_Jun-Jul_2010_-_AR_on_lives___statistics_-_non-printable.pdf Lives and Statistics: Are 90% of War Victims Civilians?]</ref>\n:1. Those killed as a direct effect of war;\n:2. Those injured as a direct effect of war;\n:3. Those dying, whether during or after a war, from indirect effects of war such as disease, malnutrition and lawlessness, and who would not have been expected to die at such rates from such causes in the absence of the war;\n:4. Victims of one-sided violence, such as when states slaughter their own citizens in connection with a war; \n:5. Victims of [[Wartime sexual violence|rape and other forms of sexual violence in connection with a war]];\n:6. Those uprooted in a war \u2013 that is, [[refugees]] and [[Internally Displaced Persons]] (IDPs);\n:7 Those who, even after a war is over, die prematurely from injuries sustained in war.\n\nThe inclusion of people in each of these categories may be defensible, but needs to be explicit. Each category presents its own methodological problems. In the case of people dying from indirect effects (category 3), much careful work is needed to distinguish between \u2018expected\u2019 and \u2018excess\u2019 levels. of mortality. In the case of victims of sexual crimes (category 5) there could be an argument for including not only direct crimes by combatants, but also 'indirect\u2019 crimes due to general social collapse. In the case of those uprooted in war (category 6), the implication that refugees and IDPs always count as war victims is too simple. Some may be fleeing one-sided violence from a repressive state apparatus, natural calamity, or general social breakdown. Moreover, in certain episodes, such as the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], the [[Kosovo War]] of 1999, and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan War of 2001]], military campaigns have enabled large numbers of refugees to return home. Indeed, in the 1971 and 1999 wars, refugee return was a stated reason for launching hostilities. Yet this key observation finds remarkably little reflection in the literature about the casualties of contemporary war. A focus on the numbers of those uprooted in war is especially problematic as those who are trapped in conflict zones may in fact be worse off than those uprooted, but seldom feature in statistics. Figures for war deaths and for war-related migration should be presented separately, not amalgamated.<ref name=\"JU\" />\n\n==International law==\n\nFollowing the Second World War, a series of treaties governing the laws of war were adopted starting in 1949. These [[Geneva Conventions]] would come into force, in no small part, because of a general reaction against the practices of the Second World War. Although the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] attempted to erect some legal defenses for civilians in time of [[war]], the bulk of the Fourth Convention devoted to explicating civilian rights in [[occupied territories]], and no explicit attention is paid to the problems of [[bombardment]] and the hazardous effects in the [[combat|combat-zone]].<ref>{{cite book |page=[https://archive.org/details/moralprinciplesn0000lack/page/213 213] |title=Moral Principles and Nuclear Weapons |author=Douglas P.

An [[Casus belli|act of war]] is deemed proportional in Just War theory if the overall destruction expected from the use of force is outweighed by the projected good to be achieved.<ref>http://www.usccb.org/sdwp/international/justwar.htm</ref> This view is a war-adapted version of [[utilitarianism]], the moral system which advocates that the morally correct action is the one that does the most good.\n\nHowever, [[moral philosophers]] often contest this approach to war. Such theorists advocate [[Moral absolutism|absolutism]], which holds there are various ethical rules that are, as the name implies, absolute. One such rule is that [[non-combatants]] cannot be attacked because they are, by definition, not partaking in combat; to attack non-combatants anyway, regardless of the expected outcome, is to deny them [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]]. Thus, by the absolutist view, only enemy [[combatants]] can be attacked.

with EURO SIGN\" is 858, not [[Code page 850|850]]. IBM will switch to use 858 instead of their 850 variant with future issues of their products. [\u2026] I can only guess why they didn't add 858 to their [[EGA.CPI|EGAx.CPI]], [[COUNTRY.SYS]], and [[KEYBOARD.SYS]] files in [[PC&nbsp;DOS&nbsp;2000]]. Many third-party applications are designed to work with 850 and didn't know about 858 at the time PC&nbsp;DOS&nbsp;2000 was released, so it's easier for everyone, but unfortunately it's not compatible.&nbsp;[\u2026] As explained above, COUNTRY.SYS and KEYBOARD.SYS contain only two codepage entries for a given country in Western issues of DOS. (In Arabic and Hebrew issues there can be up to 8 codepages for one country, in theory there is no limit below the range of allowed codepages 1..65534).&nbsp;[\u2026] The problem is that removing support for 850 might have caused compatibility problems with applications which are hard-wired to use 850. Adding 858 as a third choice to all the files would have increased the file and table sizes significantly. The COUNTRY.SYS file parser in MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS [[IO.SYS]]/[[IBMBIO.COM]] sets aside a 6&nbsp;Kb (for DOS&nbsp;6) scratchpad to load all the info. This allows a maximum of 438 entries in a COUNTRY.SYS file to be accepted, otherwise you will get the message \"COUNTRY.SYS too large.\".

with EURO SIGN\" is 858, not [[Code page 850|850]]. IBM will switch to use 858 instead of their 850 variant with future issues of their products. [\u2026] I can only guess why they didn't add 858 to their [[EGA.CPI|EGAx.CPI]], [[COUNTRY.SYS]], and [[KEYBOARD.SYS]] files in [[PC&nbsp;DOS&nbsp;2000]]. Many third-party applications are designed to work with 850 and didn't know about 858 at the time PC&nbsp;DOS&nbsp;2000 was released, so it's easier for everyone, but unfortunately it's not compatible.&nbsp;[\u2026] As explained above, COUNTRY.SYS and KEYBOARD.SYS contain only two codepage entries for a given country in Western issues of DOS. (In Arabic and Hebrew issues there can be up to 8 codepages for one country, in theory there is no limit below the range of allowed codepages 1..65534).&nbsp;[\u2026] The problem is that removing support for 850 might have caused compatibility problems with applications which are hard-wired to use 850. Adding 858 as a third choice to all the files would have increased the file and table sizes significantly. The COUNTRY.SYS file parser in MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS [[IO.SYS]]/[[IBMBIO.COM]] sets aside a 6&nbsp;Kb (for DOS&nbsp;6) scratchpad to load all the info.

Experimental results should be [[reproducibility|reproducible]] and [[intersubjective verifiability|verified]] by other researchers.<ref>e.g. {{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=3\u20135 ff}}</ref> These principles are intended to ensure experiments can be reproduced measurably given the same conditions, allowing further investigation to determine whether a [[hypothesis]] or [[theory]] related to given [[phenomena]] is [[validity (statistics)|valid]] and reliable. Standards require the scientific method to be applied throughout, and [[bias]] to be controlled for or eliminated through [[Randomized experiment|randomization]], fair sampling procedures, [[double blind|blinding]] of studies, and other methods. All gathered data, including the experimental or environmental conditions, are expected to be documented for scrutiny and made available for [[peer review]], allowing further experiments or studies to be conducted to confirm or falsify results.

That is, if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which negates them. Popper used astrology and [[psychoanalysis]] as examples of pseudoscience and Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] as an example of science. He subdivided nonscience into philosophical, mathematical, mythological, religious and metaphysical formulations on one hand, and pseudoscientific formulations on the other.<ref>{{harvp|Popper|1963|pp=43\u201386}}</ref>\n\nAnother example which shows the distinct need for a claim to be falsifiable was stated in [[Carl Sagan|Carl Sagan's]] publication ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' when he discusses an invisible dragon that he has in his garage. The point is made that there is no physical test to refute the claim of the presence of this dragon. Whatever test one thinks can be devised, there is a reason why it does not apply to the invisible dragon, so one can never prove that the initial claim is wrong. Sagan concludes; \"Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?\". He states that \"your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true\",<ref>{{harvp|Sagan|1994|p=171}}</ref> once again explaining that even if such a claim were true, it would be outside the realm of [[science|scientific inquiry]].\n\n===Mertonian norms===\n{{Main|Mertonian norms}}\nDuring 1942, [[Robert K. Merton]] identified a set of five \"norms\" which he characterized as what makes a real science. If any of the norms were violated, Merton considered the enterprise to be nonscience. These are not broadly accepted by the scientific community. His norms were:\n* Originality: The tests and research done must present something new to the scientific community.\n* Detachment: The scientists' reasons for practicing this science must be simply for the expansion of their knowledge. The scientists should not have personal reasons to expect certain results.\n* Universality: No person should be able to more easily obtain the information of a test than another person. Social class, religion, ethnicity, or any other personal factors should not be factors in someone's ability to receive or perform a type of science.\n* Skepticism: Scientific facts must not be based on faith. One should always question every case and argument and constantly check for errors or invalid claims.\n* Public accessibility: Any scientific knowledge one obtains should be made available to everyone. The results of any research should be published and shared with the scientific community.<ref name=\"Paradigms Lost\">{{cite book |last=Casti |first=John L. |authorlink=John Casti |name-list-format=vanc |title=Paradigms lost: tackling the unanswered mysteries of modern science |year=1990 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-380-71165-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/paradigmslost00jlca/page/51 51\u201352] |edition=1st |url=https://archive.org/details/paradigmslost00jlca/page/51 }}</ref>\n\n===Refusal to acknowledge problems===\nDuring 1978, [[Paul Thagard]] proposed that pseudoscience is primarily distinguishable from science when it is less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and its proponents fail to acknowledge or address problems with the theory.<ref>{{harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=223 ff}}</ref> During 1983, [[Mario Bunge]] has suggested the categories of \"belief fields\" and \"research fields\" to help distinguish between pseudoscience and science, where the former is primarily personal and subjective and the latter involves a certain systematic method.<ref>{{harvp|Bunge|1983}}</ref> The 2018 book ''[[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe (book)|The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]]'' lists hostility to criticism as one of the major features of pseudoscience.<ref>Novella, Steven, et al.

The latter case was exemplified by astrology, which appeals to observation and experimentation. While it had astonishing [[empirical research|empirical evidence]] based on observation, on [[horoscopes]] and [[biographies]], it crucially failed to use acceptable scientific standards.<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> Popper proposed falsifiability as an important criterion in distinguishing science from pseudoscience.\n\nTo demonstrate this point, Popper<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> gave two cases of human behavior and typical explanations from [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Alfred Adler]]'s theories: \"that of a man who pushes a child into the water with the intention of drowning it; and that of a man who sacrifices his life in an attempt to save the child.\"<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> From Freud's perspective, the first man would have suffered from [[psychological repression]], probably originating from an [[Oedipus complex]], whereas the second man had attained [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]. From Adler's perspective, the first and second man suffered from feelings of [[inferiority]] and had to prove himself, which drove him to commit the crime or, in the second case, drove him to rescue the child. Popper was not able to find any counterexamples of human behavior in which the behavior could not be explained in the terms of Adler's or Freud's theory. Popper argued<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> it was that the observation always fitted or confirmed the theory which, rather than being its strength, was actually its weakness. In contrast, Popper<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> gave the example of Einstein's [[gravitational theory]], which predicted \"light must be attracted by heavy bodies (such as the Sun), precisely as material bodies were attracted.\"<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> Following from this, stars closer to the Sun would appear to have moved a small distance away from the Sun, and away from each other. This prediction was particularly striking to Popper because it involved considerable risk. The brightness of the Sun prevented this effect from being observed under normal circumstances, so photographs had to be taken during an eclipse and compared to photographs taken at night. Popper states, \"If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted.\"<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> Popper summed up his criterion for the scientific status of a theory as depending on its falsifiability, refutability, or [[testability]].\n\n[[Paul R. Thagard]] used astrology as a case study to distinguish science from pseudoscience and proposed principles and criteria to delineate them.<ref name=\"Thagard 1978 astrology\"/> First, astrology has not progressed in that it has not been updated nor added any explanatory power since [[Ptolemy]]. Second, it has ignored outstanding problems such as the [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession of equinoxes]] in astronomy. Third, alternative theories of [[Personality psychology|personality]] and behavior have grown progressively to encompass explanations of phenomena which astrology statically attributes to heavenly forces. Fourth, astrologers have remained uninterested in furthering the theory to deal with outstanding problems or in critically evaluating the theory in relation to other theories. Thagard intended this criterion to be extended to areas other than astrology.

But the history of thought shows us that many people were totally committed to absurd beliefs. If the strengths of beliefs were a hallmark of knowledge, we should have to rank some tales about demons, angels, devils, and of heaven and hell as knowledge. Scientists, on the other hand, are very sceptical even of their best theories. Newton's is the most powerful theory science has yet produced, but Newton himself never believed that bodies attract each other at a distance. So no degree of commitment to beliefs makes them knowledge. Indeed, the hallmark of scientific behaviour is a certain scepticism even towards one's most cherished theories. Blind commitment to a theory is not an intellectual virtue: it is an intellectual crime.<br /><br />\nThus a statement may be pseudoscientific even if it is eminently 'plausible' and everybody believes in it, and it may be scientifically valuable even if it is unbelievable and nobody believes in it. A theory may even be of supreme scientific value even if no one understands it, let alone believes in it.<ref name=Imre-Lakatos/>|Imre Lakatos|Science and Pseudoscience}}\n\nThe boundary between science and pseudoscience is disputed and difficult to determine analytically, even after more than a century of study by philosophers of science and [[scientist]]s, and despite some basic agreements on the fundamentals of the scientific method.<ref name=\"Cover_Curd_1998\"/><ref>{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=3\u20137}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Gordin | first = Michael D. | name-list-format = vanc | article = That a clear line of demarcation has separated science from pseudoscience | editor-last1 = Numbers | editor-first1 = Ronald L. | editor-last2 = Kampourakis | editor-first2 = Kostas | title = Newton's Apple and Other Myths about Science | pages = 219\u2013225 | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2015 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=pWouCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=newton's+apple+and+other+myths+about+science#v=onepage&q=newton's%20apple%20and%20other%20myths%20about%20science&f=false | isbn = 9780674915473 }}\n</ref> The concept of pseudoscience rests on an understanding that the scientific method has been misrepresented or misapplied with respect to a given theory, but many philosophers of science maintain that different kinds of methods are held as appropriate across different fields and different eras of human history.

To Popper, falsifiability is what determines the scientific status of a theory. Taking a historical approach, Kuhn observed that scientists did not follow Popper's rule, and might ignore falsifying data, unless overwhelming. To Kuhn, puzzle-solving within a paradigm is science. Lakatos attempted to resolve this debate, by suggesting history shows that science occurs in research programmes, competing according to how progressive they are. The leading idea of a programme could evolve, driven by its heuristic to make predictions that can be supported by evidence. Feyerabend claimed that Lakatos was selective in his examples, and the whole history of science shows there is no universal rule of scientific method, and imposing one on the scientific community impedes progress.<ref name=Newbold>{{cite journal | vauthors = Newbold D, Roberts J | title = An analysis of the demarcation problem in science and its application to therapeutic touch theory | journal = International Journal of Nursing Practice | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 324\u201330 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18021160 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-172X.2007.00646.x }}</ref>|David Newbold and Julia Roberts|\"An analysis of the demarcation problem in science and its application to therapeutic touch theory\" in ''International Journal of Nursing Practice'', Vol. 13}} Laudan maintained that the demarcation between science and non-science was a pseudo-problem, preferring to focus on the more general distinction between reliable and unreliable knowledge.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Laudan L |authorlink=Larry Laudan | veditors = Cohen RS, Laudan L |title=Physics, Philosophy and Psychoanalysis: Essays in Honor of Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum|series=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science|volume=76|year=1983| publisher=D.

Experimental results should be [[reproducibility|reproducible]] and [[intersubjective verifiability|verified]] by other researchers.<ref>e.g. {{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=3\u20135 ff}}</ref> These principles are intended to ensure experiments can be reproduced measurably given the same conditions, allowing further investigation to determine whether a [[hypothesis]] or [[theory]] related to given [[phenomena]] is [[validity (statistics)|valid]] and reliable. Standards require the scientific method to be applied throughout, and [[bias]] to be controlled for or eliminated through [[Randomized experiment|randomization]], fair sampling procedures, [[double blind|blinding]] of studies, and other methods. All gathered data, including the experimental or environmental conditions, are expected to be documented for scrutiny and made available for [[peer review]], allowing further experiments or studies to be conducted to confirm or falsify results.

That is, if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which negates them. Popper used astrology and [[psychoanalysis]] as examples of pseudoscience and Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] as an example of science. He subdivided nonscience into philosophical, mathematical, mythological, religious and metaphysical formulations on one hand, and pseudoscientific formulations on the other.<ref>{{harvp|Popper|1963|pp=43\u201386}}</ref>\n\nAnother example which shows the distinct need for a claim to be falsifiable was stated in [[Carl Sagan|Carl Sagan's]] publication ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' when he discusses an invisible dragon that he has in his garage. The point is made that there is no physical test to refute the claim of the presence of this dragon. Whatever test one thinks can be devised, there is a reason why it does not apply to the invisible dragon, so one can never prove that the initial claim is wrong. Sagan concludes; \"Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?\". He states that \"your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true\",<ref>{{harvp|Sagan|1994|p=171}}</ref> once again explaining that even if such a claim were true, it would be outside the realm of [[science|scientific inquiry]].\n\n===Mertonian norms===\n{{Main|Mertonian norms}}\nDuring 1942, [[Robert K. Merton]] identified a set of five \"norms\" which he characterized as what makes a real science. If any of the norms were violated, Merton considered the enterprise to be nonscience. These are not broadly accepted by the scientific community. His norms were:\n* Originality: The tests and research done must present something new to the scientific community.\n* Detachment: The scientists' reasons for practicing this science must be simply for the expansion of their knowledge. The scientists should not have personal reasons to expect certain results.\n* Universality: No person should be able to more easily obtain the information of a test than another person. Social class, religion, ethnicity, or any other personal factors should not be factors in someone's ability to receive or perform a type of science.\n* Skepticism: Scientific facts must not be based on faith. One should always question every case and argument and constantly check for errors or invalid claims.\n* Public accessibility: Any scientific knowledge one obtains should be made available to everyone. The results of any research should be published and shared with the scientific community.<ref name=\"Paradigms Lost\">{{cite book |last=Casti |first=John L. |authorlink=John Casti |name-list-format=vanc |title=Paradigms lost: tackling the unanswered mysteries of modern science |year=1990 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-380-71165-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/paradigmslost00jlca/page/51 51\u201352] |edition=1st |url=https://archive.org/details/paradigmslost00jlca/page/51 }}</ref>\n\n===Refusal to acknowledge problems===\nDuring 1978, [[Paul Thagard]] proposed that pseudoscience is primarily distinguishable from science when it is less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and its proponents fail to acknowledge or address problems with the theory.<ref>{{harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=223 ff}}</ref> During 1983, [[Mario Bunge]] has suggested the categories of \"belief fields\" and \"research fields\" to help distinguish between pseudoscience and science, where the former is primarily personal and subjective and the latter involves a certain systematic method.<ref>{{harvp|Bunge|1983}}</ref> The 2018 book ''[[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe (book)|The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]]'' lists hostility to criticism as one of the major features of pseudoscience.<ref>Novella, Steven, et al.

It may also describe the transition from a body of practical knowledge into a scientific field.<ref name=\"Popper\"/>\n\n===Philosophy===\n{{Main|Demarcation problem}}\n\nKarl Popper stated it is insufficient to distinguish science from pseudoscience, or from [[metaphysics]] (such as the philosophical question of what [[existence]] means), by the criterion of rigorous adherence to the [[Empiricism|empirical method]], which is essentially inductive, based on observation or experimentation.<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\">{{cite book |last= Popper |first= Karl |name-list-format= vanc |author-link= Karl Popper |date= 1963 |title= Conjectures and Refutations |url= http://www.paul-rosenfels.org/Popper.pdf |ref= harv |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171013124349/http://www.paul-rosenfels.org/Popper.pdf |archivedate= 13 October 2017 }}</ref> He proposed a method to distinguish between genuine empirical, nonempirical or even pseudoempirical methods. The latter case was exemplified by astrology, which appeals to observation and experimentation. While it had astonishing [[empirical research|empirical evidence]] based on observation, on [[horoscopes]] and [[biographies]], it crucially failed to use acceptable scientific standards.<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> Popper proposed falsifiability as an important criterion in distinguishing science from pseudoscience.\n\nTo demonstrate this point, Popper<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> gave two cases of human behavior and typical explanations from [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Alfred Adler]]'s theories: \"that of a man who pushes a child into the water with the intention of drowning it; and that of a man who sacrifices his life in an attempt to save the child.\"<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> From Freud's perspective, the first man would have suffered from [[psychological repression]], probably originating from an [[Oedipus complex]], whereas the second man had attained [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]. From Adler's perspective, the first and second man suffered from feelings of [[inferiority]] and had to prove himself, which drove him to commit the crime or, in the second case, drove him to rescue the child. Popper was not able to find any counterexamples of human behavior in which the behavior could not be explained in the terms of Adler's or Freud's theory. Popper argued<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> it was that the observation always fitted or confirmed the theory which, rather than being its strength, was actually its weakness. In contrast, Popper<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> gave the example of Einstein's [[gravitational theory]], which predicted \"light must be attracted by heavy bodies (such as the Sun), precisely as material bodies were attracted.\"<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> Following from this, stars closer to the Sun would appear to have moved a small distance away from the Sun, and away from each other. This prediction was particularly striking to Popper because it involved considerable risk. The brightness of the Sun prevented this effect from being observed under normal circumstances, so photographs had to be taken during an eclipse and compared to photographs taken at night. Popper states, \"If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted.\"<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> Popper summed up his criterion for the scientific status of a theory as depending on its falsifiability, refutability, or [[testability]].\n\n[[Paul R. Thagard]] used astrology as a case study to distinguish science from pseudoscience and proposed principles and criteria to delineate them.<ref name=\"Thagard 1978 astrology\"/> First, astrology has not progressed in that it has not been updated nor added any explanatory power since [[Ptolemy]]. Second, it has ignored outstanding problems such as the [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession of equinoxes]] in astronomy. Third, alternative theories of [[Personality psychology|personality]] and behavior have grown progressively to encompass explanations of phenomena which astrology statically attributes to heavenly forces. Fourth, astrologers have remained uninterested in furthering the theory to deal with outstanding problems or in critically evaluating the theory in relation to other theories. Thagard intended this criterion to be extended to areas other than astrology. He believed it would delineate as pseudoscientific such practices as [[witchcraft]] and [[pyramidology]], while leaving [[physics]], chemistry and [[biology]] in the realm of science. [[Biorhythms]], which like astrology relied uncritically on birth dates, did not meet the criterion of pseudoscience at the time because there were no alternative explanations for the same observations. The use of this criterion has the consequence that a theory can be scientific at one time and pseudoscientific at a later time.<ref name=\"Thagard 1978 astrology\">{{harvp|Thagard|1978}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[philosophy of science|philosophy]] and history of science, [[Imre Lakatos]] stresses the social and political importance of the demarcation problem, the normative methodological problem of distinguishing between science and pseudoscience.

But the history of thought shows us that many people were totally committed to absurd beliefs. If the strengths of beliefs were a hallmark of knowledge, we should have to rank some tales about demons, angels, devils, and of heaven and hell as knowledge. Scientists, on the other hand, are very sceptical even of their best theories. Newton's is the most powerful theory science has yet produced, but Newton himself never believed that bodies attract each other at a distance. So no degree of commitment to beliefs makes them knowledge. Indeed, the hallmark of scientific behaviour is a certain scepticism even towards one's most cherished theories. Blind commitment to a theory is not an intellectual virtue: it is an intellectual crime.<br /><br />\nThus a statement may be pseudoscientific even if it is eminently 'plausible' and everybody believes in it, and it may be scientifically valuable even if it is unbelievable and nobody believes in it.

In elementary school, he hit all things that sounded like a musical instrument. Hollow gears, such as broken pots, crushed pots, planks, sticks, iron pipes, or bamboo, dig through holes. He mainly played snare drums and recorders, and in middle school he started playing the clarinet in the band. The clarinet he met while blowing the iron pipe was so fascinating that he swelled his mouth to swell.<ref name=\":0\">[https://zetawiki.com/wiki/%EC%9B%90%EC%9D%BC <!-- \"\uc800\ub294

In elementary school, he hit all things that sounded like a musical instrument. Hollow gears, such as broken pots, crushed pots, planks, sticks, iron pipes, or bamboo, dig through holes. He mainly played snare drums and recorders, and in middle school he started playing the clarinet in the band. The clarinet he met while blowing the iron pipe was so fascinating that he swelled his mouth to swell.<ref name=\":0\"><!-- \"\uc800\ub294 \uc74c\uc545\uc801 \uc7ac\ub2a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294

Latitude exerts little influence on the Venezuelan climate, but the altitude changes it dramatically, particularly the temperature, reaching values very different according to The weather.\n\n==General climate==\nWhile the coastal cities of Maracaibo, Barcelona, Porlamar and Maiquetia can get extremely hot, cities located at valleys such as M\u00e9rida, Caracas, Los Teques and San Cristobal have cooler climates, and the highest towns of Mucuchies and Apartaderos have cold (tundra) climates.\n\nThe hottest part of Venezuela is the northwest ([[Paraguana Peninsula]] and [[Guajira Peninsula]]), where temperatures of more than {{convert|38|\u00b0C}} are frequently recorded. The coldest part in the country are located in the highest areas of the [[Cordillera de M\u00e9rida]], where temperatures lower than {{convert|-2|\u00b0C}} are recorded.
