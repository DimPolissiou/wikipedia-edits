There have been numerous theories of gravitation since ancient times.\n[[Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] (f.&nbsp;4th century&nbsp;BC) believed that objects tend toward a point due to their inner ''gravitas'' (heaviness). [[Vitruvius]] (f.&nbsp;1st century&nbsp;BC) understood that objects fall based on their [[specific gravity]]. in the 7th century, [[Brahmagupta]] spoke of gravity as an attractive force.\n\nThe [[Aristotelian physics#Natural place|Aristotelian concept of gravity]] began to be rejected, initially by [[Physics in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic physicists]], starting in the 11th century with [[Ibn Sina]]'s [[theory of impetus]]. The following century, [[Abu'l-Barak\u0101t al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b]] explained [[gravitational acceleration]], describing it as the [[acceleration]] of falling bodies by the accumulation of successive increments of [[Power (physics)|power]] with successive increments of velocity. The works of Ibn Sina and al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b were [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by the 14th century, influencing [[Jean Buridan]] and [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]]. The same century, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s [[Merton College]] developed the [[mean speed theorem]].\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Galileo Galilei]] found that all objects tend to accelerate equally in [[free fall]]. In 1632, he put forth [[Galilean invariance|the basic principle of relativity]]. The existence of the [[gravitational constant]] was explored by various researchers from the mid-17th century, helping [[Isaac Newton]] formulate his [[law of universal gravitation]].\nNewton's [[classical mechanics]] were superseded in the early 20th century, when [[Albert Einstein]] developed the [[Special relativity|special]] and [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]]. The [[Graviton|force carrier of gravity]] remains an outlier in the search for a [[theory of everything]], which various models of [[quantum gravity]] are candidates for.\n\n==Antiquity==\nVarious ancient texts such as the [[Bible]] describe some of the everyday effects of gravity;<ref>{{cite web |last=Deem |first=Rich |title=The Word 'Gravity' Never Appears in the Bible |url=https://www.godandscience.org/doctrine/gravity.html |website=God and Science |accessdate=8 August 2019 |date=25 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Indian Scriptures Mention Gravity 1500 Years Before Isaac Newton: Former ISRO Chief G Madhavan Nair |url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-scriptures-mention-gravity-1500-years-before-isaac-newton-former-isro-chief-g-madhavan-nair-741360 |website=NDTV |accessdate=8 August 2019 |date=21 February 2015}}</ref> some religious scholars interpret particular scriptures as describing the cosmic force of gravity while not explicitly naming it as such.<ref>{{cite web |last=DeYoung |first=Don |title=Gravity |url=https://answersingenesis.org/physics/gravity/ |website=Answers in Genesis |accessdate=8 August 2019 |date=1 June 2000}}</ref>\n\n===Greco-Roman world===\n{{See also|Aristotelian physics}}\nIn the 4th century BC, the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] taught that there is no [[Causality|effect]] or [[Motion (physics)|motion]] without a [[causality|cause]]. The cause of the downward motion of heavy bodies, such as the element [[earth (classical element)|earth]], was related to their [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]], which caused them to move downward toward the centre of the universe, which was their natural place. Conversely, light bodies such as the element [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], move by their nature upward toward the inner surface of the [[Celestial spheres|sphere]] of the Moon.  Thus in Aristotle's system heavy bodies are not attracted to the [[Earth]] by an external force, but tend toward the centre of the universe because of an inner ''gravitas'' or heaviness.<ref>Edward Grant, ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

In his own words:<blockquote>I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centres about which they revolve; and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth; and found them to answer pretty nearly.</blockquote>\n\nNewton's original formula was:\n:<math>{\\rm Force\\,of\\,gravity} \\propto \\frac{\\rm mass\\,of\\,object\\,1\\,\\times\\,mass\\,of\\,object\\,2}{\\rm distance\\,from\\,centers^2}</math>\n\nwhere the symbol <math>\\propto</math> means \"is proportional to\".\nTo make this into an equal-sided formula or equation, there needed to be a multiplying factor or constant that would give the correct force of gravity no matter the value of the masses or distance between them.  This gravitational constant was first accurately measured in 1797 by Henry Cavendish.{{efn|name=constant}}\n\nNewton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of [[Neptune]] based on motions of [[Uranus]] that could not be accounted by the actions of the other planets.  Calculations by [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]] both predicted the general position of the planet. Le Verrier's sent his position to [[Johann Gottfried Galle]], asking him to verify; in the same night, Galle spotted Neptune near the position Le Verrier had predicted.\n\nYears later, it was another discrepancy in a planet's orbit that showed Newton's theory to be inaccurate. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] could not be accounted for entirely under Newtonian gravity, and all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury) were fruitless. This issue was resolved in 1915 by Einstein's general theory of relativity, which accounted for the discrepancy in Mercury's orbit, thereby superseding Newton's theory. However, most modern non-relativistic gravitational calculations still use Newton's equations because they are easier to work with and sufficiently accurate for many everyday applications.\n\n==Modern era==\nIn the late 19th century, [[Lord Kelvin]] pondered the possibility of a [[theory of everything]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Silvanus P. |title=Lord Kelvin |url=https://www.iec.ch/about/history/figures/lord_kelvin.htm |website=International Electrotechnical Commission |accessdate=October 16, 2019 |date=2019}}</ref> He proposed that every body pulsates, which might be an explanation of gravitation and [[electric charge]]s. However, his ideas were largely mechanistic and required the existence of the aether, which the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]] failed to detect in 1887. This, combined with [[Mach's principle]], led to gravitational models which feature [[action at a distance]].\n\n[[File:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|thumb|upright|One of [[Arthur Eddington]]'s photographs of the total [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]], presented in his 1920 paper announcing its success, which confirmed [[Einstein]]'s theory that light 'bends']]\n\nIn 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published a series of papers in which he established the [[special theory of relativity]] and the fact that [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|mass and energy are equivalent]]. In 1907, in what he described as \"the happiest thought of my life\", Einstein realized that someone who is in free fall experiences no [[gravitational field]]. In other words, gravitation is exactly equivalent to acceleration. Between 1911 and 1915, Einstein developed this idea, initially stated as the [[equivalence principle]], into his [[general theory of relativity]], which fuses the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions of space]] and the one dimension of [[time]] into the [[four-dimensional]] fabric of [[spacetime]]. However, it does not unify gravity with [[quantum|quanta]]\u2014individual particles of energy, which Einstein himself had postulated the existence of in 1905.\n\nIn 1914, [[Gunnar Nordstr\u00f6m]] attempted to unify gravity and [[electromagnetism]] in [[Nordstr\u00f6m's theory of gravitation|his theory]] of [[Five-dimensional space|five-dimensional]] gravitation.{{efn|In [[string theory]], dimensions exceeding four allow for the existence of [[Multiverse|parallel realities]]\u2014which along with the [[anthropic principle]], help to explain the statistical near-impossibility of our [[fine-tuned universe]].}} This was superseded by general relativity in 1919, when [[gravitational lens]]ing around a solar eclipse was observed by [[Arthur Eddington]]. Thereafter, German mathematician [[Theodor Kaluza]] promoted the idea of general relativity with a fifth dimension, which in 1921 Swedish physicist [[Oskar Klein]] gave [[Kaluza\u2013Klein theory|a physical interpretation]] of in a prototypical [[string theory]], a possible model of [[quantum gravity]] and potential theory of everything.\n\n[[Einstein's field equations]] include a [[cosmological constant]] to account for the alleged [[static universe|staticity of the universe]]. However, [[Edwin Hubble]] observed in 1929 that the universe appears to be expanding.

The starting point for general relativity is the equivalence principle, which equates free fall with inertial motion.  The issue that this creates is that free-falling objects can accelerate with respect to each other.\nTo deal with this difficulty, Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along [[Geodesics in general relativity|locally straight paths in curved spacetime]]. More specifically, Einstein and [[David Hilbert]] discovered the [[field equation]]s of general relativity, which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime. [[Einstein field equations|These field equations]] are a set of 10 [[simultaneous equation|simultaneous]], [[Nonlinearity|non-linear]], [[differential equation]]s.  The solutions of the field equations are the components of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] of spacetime, which describes its geometry. The geodesic paths of spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor.\n\nNotable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:\n* The [[Schwarzschild solution]], which describes spacetime surrounding a [[spherical symmetry|spherically symmetrical]] non-rotating uncharged massive object. For objects with radii smaller than the [[Schwarzschild radius]], this solution generates a [[black hole]] with a central singularity.\n* The [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m black hole|Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m solution]], in which the central object has an electrical charge. For charges with a [[geometrized]] length less than the geometrized length of the mass of the object, this solution produces black holes with an [[event horizon]] surrounding a [[Cauchy horizon]].\n* The [[Kerr solution]] for rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple horizons.\n* The [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Robertson\u2013Walker coordinates|Robertson\u2013Walker solution]], which predicts the expansion of the universe.\n\nGeneral relativity has enjoyed much success because its predictions (not called for by older theories of gravity) have been regularly confirmed.  For example:\n* General relativity accounts for the anomalous [[perihelion precession of Mercury]].\n* Gravitational lensing was first confirmed in 1919, and has more recently been strongly confirmed through the use of a [[quasar]] which passes behind the Sun as seen from the Earth.\n* The expansion of the universe (predicted by the [[Robertson\u2013Walker metric]]) was confirmed by Edwin Hubble in 1929.\n* The prediction that time runs slower at lower potentials has been confirmed by the [[Pound\u2013Rebka experiment]], the [[Hafele\u2013Keating experiment]], and the [[GPS]].\n* The [[time delay of light]] passing close to a massive object was first identified by [[Irwin Shapiro]] in 1964 in interplanetary spacecraft signals.\n* [[Gravitational radiation]] has been indirectly confirmed through studies of binary [[pulsar]]s such as [[PSR 1913+16]].\n** In 2015, the [[LIGO]] experiments directly [[First observation of gravitational waves|detected gravitational radiation]] from [[Binary black hole|two colliding black holes]], making this the first direct observation of both gravitational waves and black holes.<ref name=\"PRL-20160211\">{{cite journal |collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration |last1=Abbott |first1=Benjamin P. |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |journal=[[Phys.

There have been numerous theories of gravitation since ancient times.\n[[Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] (f.&nbsp;4th century&nbsp;BC) believed that objects tend toward a point due to their inner ''gravitas'' (heaviness). [[Vitruvius]] (f.&nbsp;1st century&nbsp;BC) understood that objects fall based on their [[specific gravity]]. in the 7th century, [[Brahmagupta]] spoke of gravity as an attractive force.\n\nThe [[Aristotelian physics#Natural place|Aristotelian concept of gravity]] began to be rejected, initially by [[Physics in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic physicists]], starting in the 11th century with [[Ibn Sina]]'s [[theory of impetus]]. The following century, [[Abu'l-Barak\u0101t al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b]] explained [[gravitational acceleration]], describing it as the [[acceleration]] of falling bodies by the accumulation of successive increments of [[Power (physics)|power]] with successive increments of velocity.

The same century, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s [[Merton College]] developed the [[mean speed theorem]].\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Galileo Galilei]] found that all objects tend to accelerate equally in [[free fall]]. In 1632, he put forth [[Galilean invariance|the basic principle of relativity]]. The existence of the [[gravitational constant]] was explored by various researchers from the mid-17th century, helping [[Isaac Newton]] formulate his [[law of universal gravitation]].\nNewton's [[classical mechanics]] were superseded in the early 20th century, when [[Albert Einstein]] developed the [[Special relativity|special]] and [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]].

In his own words:<blockquote>I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centres about which they revolve; and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth; and found them to answer pretty nearly.</blockquote>\n\nNewton's original formula was:\n:<math>{\\rm Force\\,of\\,gravity} \\propto \\frac{\\rm mass\\,of\\,object\\,1\\,\\times\\,mass\\,of\\,object\\,2}{\\rm distance\\,from\\,centers^2}</math>\n\nwhere the symbol <math>\\propto</math> means \"is proportional to\".\nTo make this into an equal-sided formula or equation, there needed to be a multiplying factor or constant that would give the correct force of gravity no matter the value of the masses or distance between them.  This gravitational constant was first accurately measured in 1797 by Henry Cavendish.{{efn|name=constant}}\n\nNewton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of [[Neptune]] based on motions of [[Uranus]] that could not be accounted by the actions of the other planets.  Calculations by [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]] both predicted the general position of the planet. Le Verrier's sent his position to [[Johann Gottfried Galle]], asking him to verify; in the same night, Galle spotted Neptune near the position Le Verrier had predicted.\n\nYears later, it was another discrepancy in a planet's orbit that showed Newton's theory to be inaccurate. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] could not be accounted for entirely under Newtonian gravity, and all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury) were fruitless. This issue was resolved in 1915 by Einstein's general theory of relativity, which accounted for the discrepancy in Mercury's orbit, thereby superseding Newton's theory. However, most modern non-relativistic gravitational calculations still use Newton's equations because they are easier to work with and sufficiently accurate for many everyday applications.\n\n==Modern era==\nIn the late 19th century, [[Lord Kelvin]] pondered the possibility of a [[theory of everything]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Silvanus P. |title=Lord Kelvin |url=https://www.iec.ch/about/history/figures/lord_kelvin.htm |website=International Electrotechnical Commission |accessdate=October 16, 2019 |date=2019}}</ref> He proposed that every body pulsates, which might be an explanation of gravitation and [[electric charge]]s. However, his ideas were largely mechanistic and required the existence of the aether, which the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]] failed to detect in 1887. This, combined with [[Mach's principle]], led to gravitational models which feature [[action at a distance]].\n\n[[File:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|thumb|upright|One of [[Arthur Eddington]]'s photographs of the total [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]], presented in his 1920 paper announcing its success, which confirmed [[Einstein]]'s theory that light 'bends']]\n\nIn 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published a series of papers in which he established the [[special theory of relativity]] and the fact that [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|mass and energy are equivalent]]. In 1907, in what he described as \"the happiest thought of my life\", Einstein realized that someone who is in free fall experiences no [[gravitational field]]. In other words, gravitation is exactly equivalent to acceleration. Between 1911 and 1915, Einstein developed this idea, initially stated as the [[equivalence principle]], into his [[general theory of relativity]], which fuses the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions of space]] and the one dimension of [[time]] into the [[four-dimensional]] fabric of [[spacetime]]. However, it does not unify gravity with [[quantum|quanta]]\u2014individual particles of energy, which Einstein himself had postulated the existence of in 1905.\n\nIn 1914, [[Gunnar Nordstr\u00f6m]] attempted to unify gravity and [[electromagnetism]] in [[Nordstr\u00f6m's theory of gravitation|his theory]] of [[Five-dimensional space|five-dimensional]] gravitation.{{efn|In [[string theory]], dimensions exceeding four allow for the existence of [[Multiverse|parallel realities]]\u2014which along with the [[anthropic principle]], help to explain the statistical near-impossibility of our [[fine-tuned universe]].}} This was superseded by general relativity in 1919, when [[gravitational lens]]ing around a solar eclipse was observed by [[Arthur Eddington]]. Thereafter, German mathematician [[Theodor Kaluza]] promoted the idea of general relativity with a fifth dimension, which in 1921 Swedish physicist [[Oskar Klein]] gave [[Kaluza\u2013Klein theory|a physical interpretation]] of in a prototypical [[string theory]], a possible model of [[quantum gravity]] and potential theory of everything.\n\n[[Einstein's field equations]] include a [[cosmological constant]] to account for the alleged [[static universe|staticity of the universe]]. However, [[Edwin Hubble]] observed in 1929 that the universe appears to be expanding.

The starting point for general relativity is the equivalence principle, which equates free fall with inertial motion.  The issue that this creates is that free-falling objects can accelerate with respect to each other.\nTo deal with this difficulty, Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along [[Geodesics in general relativity|locally straight paths in curved spacetime]]. More specifically, Einstein and [[David Hilbert]] discovered the [[field equation]]s of general relativity, which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime. [[Einstein field equations|These field equations]] are a set of 10 [[simultaneous equation|simultaneous]], [[Nonlinearity|non-linear]], [[differential equation]]s.  The solutions of the field equations are the components of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] of spacetime, which describes its geometry. The geodesic paths of spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor.\n\nNotable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:\n* The [[Schwarzschild solution]], which describes spacetime surrounding a [[spherical symmetry|spherically symmetrical]] non-rotating uncharged massive object. For objects with radii smaller than the [[Schwarzschild radius]], this solution generates a [[black hole]] with a central singularity.\n* The [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m black hole|Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m solution]], in which the central object has an electrical charge. For charges with a [[geometrized]] length less than the geometrized length of the mass of the object, this solution produces black holes with an [[event horizon]] surrounding a [[Cauchy horizon]].\n* The [[Kerr solution]] for rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple horizons.\n* The [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Robertson\u2013Walker coordinates|Robertson\u2013Walker solution]], which predicts the expansion of the universe.\n\nGeneral relativity has enjoyed much success because its predictions (not called for by older theories of gravity) have been regularly confirmed.  For example:\n* General relativity accounts for the anomalous [[perihelion precession of Mercury]].\n* Gravitational lensing was first confirmed in 1919, and has more recently been strongly confirmed through the use of a [[quasar]] which passes behind the Sun as seen from the Earth.\n* The expansion of the universe (predicted by the [[Robertson\u2013Walker metric]]) was confirmed by Edwin Hubble in 1929.\n* The prediction that time runs slower at lower potentials has been confirmed by the [[Pound\u2013Rebka experiment]], the [[Hafele\u2013Keating experiment]], and the [[GPS]].\n* The [[time delay of light]] passing close to a massive object was first identified by [[Irwin Shapiro]] in 1964 in interplanetary spacecraft signals.\n* [[Gravitational radiation]] has been indirectly confirmed through studies of binary [[pulsar]]s such as [[PSR 1913+16]].\n** In 2015, the [[LIGO]] experiments directly [[First observation of gravitational waves|detected gravitational radiation]] from [[Binary black hole|two colliding black holes]], making this the first direct observation of both gravitational waves and black holes.<ref name=\"PRL-20160211\">{{cite journal |collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration |last1=Abbott |first1=Benjamin P. |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |journal=[[Phys.

{"title_page": "National Football League television blackout policies", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=January 2014}}\n{{update|date=May 2016}}\n{{context|date=April 2017}}\n}}\n\nThe '''[[National Football League]] television blackout policies''' are the strictest [[Blackout (broadcasting)|television blackout]] policies among the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|four major professional sports leagues]] in North America.\n\nFrom [[1973 NFL season|1973]] through [[2014 NFL season|2014]], the NFL maintained a blackout policy that stated that a home game cannot be televised in the team's local [[media market|market]] if 85%  of the tickets are not sold out 72&nbsp;hours prior to its start time. This makes the NFL the only major professional sports league in the US that requires teams to sell out tickets in order to broadcast a game on television locally. Although nationally televised games in the other leagues are often blacked out on the national networks on which the game is airing in the local markets of the participating teams, they can still be seen on the local broadcast TV station or [[regional sports network]] that normally holds their local/regional broadcast rights. The league blackout policy has been suspended on a year-to-year basis since [[2015 NFL season|2015]].\n\nFurthermore, the NFL is the only league that imposes an [[anti-siphoning law|anti-siphoning rule]] in all teams' local markets: the NFL sells [[broadcast syndication|syndication rights]] of each team's Thursday and Monday night games to a local over-the-air station in each local market. The respective cable station must be blacked out when that team is playing the said game.\n\n==Getting around restrictions==\nPrior to 1973, all games were blacked out in the home city of origin and on any TV stations located within 75 miles of the team's home city, regardless of whether they were sold out. This policy, dating back to the NFL's emerging television years, resulted in home-city blackouts even during sold-out regular-season games and championship games. For instance, the 1958 [[1958 NFL Championship Game|\"Greatest Game Ever Played\"]] between the [[1958 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] and [[1958 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] was unavailable to viewers in the New York City market despite the sellout at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] (many fans rented hotel rooms or visited friends in areas of [[Connecticut]] or [[Pennsylvania]] where signals of TV stations carrying the game were available to watch the game on television, a practice that continued for Giants games through 1972). Similarly, all [[Super Bowl]] games prior to [[Super Bowl VII]] in January 1973 were not televised in the host city's market.\n\nThe policy was in effect when, in 1972, the [[1972 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] made the playoffs for only the second time in 27 seasons. Because all home games were blacked-out, politicians \u2013 including President [[Richard Nixon]], a devout football fan \u2013 were not able to watch their favorite team's home games, as the primary carrier for such games, [[CBS]] affiliate [[WUSA (TV)|WTOP-TV]] (now WUSA) was forced to black out the games and carry alternate programming. [[National Football League#Corporate structure|NFL commissioner]] [[Pete Rozelle]] refused to lift the blackout for the NFC Championship Game, despite a plea from [[United States Attorney General]] [[Richard Kleindienst]] (Nixon watched both 1972 Redskins playoff games from his Western White House in [[San Clemente, California]]). Kleindienst went on to suggest that the [[United States Congress]] re-evaluate the NFL's [[antitrust]] exemption.\n\nRozelle agreed to lift the blackout for [[Super Bowl VII]] on an \"experimental basis\", if the game sold-out ten or more days in advance.  With the game a sellout, viewers in the Los Angeles area were able to see the [[NBC]] telecast of the game.  Nonetheless, Congress intervened before the 1973 season anyway, passing Public Law 93-107, which eliminated the blackout of games in the home market so long as the game was sold out by 72&nbsp;hours before game time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rubin, Rozelle, the Redskins, and Super Bowl Blackouts|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index0f6b.html?p=5967|date=February 5, 2010|accessdate=February 20, 2017}}</ref> The league will sometimes change this deadline to 48&nbsp;hours if there are only a few thousand tickets left to be sold; much more rarely, the NFL will occasionally reduce the deadline to 24&nbsp;hours in special cases.<ref name=\"probowlblackout\">{{cite web|title=Local TV blackout still possible for Pro Bowl|url=http://www.nfl.com/probowl/story/09000d5d80e9da1e/article/local-tv-blackout-still-possible-for-pro-bowl|agency=[[Associated Press]]|website=NFL.com|date=February 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\nTickets in premium [[Club seating|club sections]] and [[luxury suite]]s have been excluded from the blackout rule (indeed modern NFL stadiums have reduced general seating in favor of club seating and luxury suites, as this makes it easier to sell out the stadium and avoid blackouts, and this revenue does not have to be shared with other franchises), as have unused tickets allocated to the visiting team. Alternatively, some NFL teams have arrangements with local [[television station]]s or businesses (often sponsors of the team and/or its local broadcasts) to purchase unsold tickets. Teams themselves are allowed to purchase remaining non-premium tickets at 34\u00a2 on the dollar (the portion subject to [[revenue sharing]]) to prevent a blackout.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blackout lifted for Broncos-Chargers|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/11/24/blackout-lifted-for-broncos-chargers/|website=ProFootballTalk|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|date=November 24, 2011|accessdate=April 18, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=If game faces TV blackout, Bills won't bail it out|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/incoming/article652246.ece|author=Gene Warner|newspaper=[[The Buffalo News]]|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=April 18, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924192306/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-30192789.html|archivedate=September 24, 2015}}</ref> Teams can also lift the blackout on their own; this has occasionally been done in cases of stormy weather on game days.\n\nThe NFL requires that closing off sections be done uniformly for every home game, including playoff games, in a given season. This prevents teams from trying to sell out the entire stadium only when they expect to be able to do so. For instance, the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] closed off a number of sections at their home stadium, [[EverBank Field]], to reduce the number of tickets they would need to sell. EverBank Field is one of the largest venues in the NFL, as it was built to also accommodate the annual [[Florida vs. Georgia Football Classic|Florida-Georgia game]] and [[Gator Bowl]] in [[college football]], and was expanded for [[Super Bowl XXXIX]], even though it draws from one of the smallest markets in the league.\n\nThe NFL authorized a new rule loosening the league's blackout restrictions during the 2012 offseason. Under the new rule, for the first time in NFL history, the ticket sales provision no longer requires a stadium to be sold out in order for a game to be televised; instead, teams are allowed to set a benchmark of anywhere from 85% to 100% of the stadium's non-premium seats. Any seats sold beyond that benchmark will be subject to heavier revenue sharing.<ref>{{cite news|title=Report: NFL team owners get more flexibility on blackouts|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/article929095.ece|newspaper=The Buffalo News|publisher=BH Media Group, LLC|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref> While most teams participate in the new blackout rules, four teams \u2013 the [[Buffalo Bills]], [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Indianapolis Colts]] and [[Los Angeles Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] \u2013 continue to follow the previous blackout rule, as under the 2012 rule modification, the teams would be required to pay a higher percentage of gate fees to the NFL's revenue fund.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bills aren't alone on blackout policy|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20120830/cityandregion/120839593|author=Gene Warner|publisher=BH Media Group, LLC|date=August 30, 2012|accessdate=August 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===End of FCC enforcement, temporary suspension===\nUntil September 2014, the NFL blackout rules were sanctioned by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), which enforced rules requiring [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television|satellite]] providers to not distribute any sports telecast that had been blacked out by a broadcast television station within their market of service. On September 9, 2014, ''[[USA Today]]'' published an [[editorial]] from FCC chairman [[Tom Wheeler]], which stated that he was submitting a proposal to \"get rid of the FCC's blackout rules once and for all\", to be voted on by the agency's members on September 30 of that year, declaring such policies to be \"obsolete\".<ref>{{cite news|title=FCC chairman: Sack the NFL's blackout rule|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/09/09/wheeler-fcc-nfl-blackout-rule-obsolete-column/15300147/|author=[[Tom Wheeler]]|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=September 9, 2014}}</ref> On September 30, 2014, the Commission voted unanimously to repeal the FCC's blackout rules. However, the removal of these rules are, to an extent, purely symbolic; the NFL can still enforce its blackout policies on a contractual basis with [[television network]]s, stations, and service providers \u2013 a process made feasible by the large amount of leverage the league places on its media partners.<ref name=forbes-elimination>{{cite web|title=The FCC's Elimination Of The Sports Blackout Rule Is Not A Touchdown For NFL Fans|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciajessop/2014/09/30/the-fccs-elimination-of-the-sports-blackout-rule-is-not-a-touchdown-for-nfl-fans/|author=Alicia Jessop|periodical=[[Forbes]]|publisher=Forbes Inc.|date=September 30, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref><ref name=fcc-blackoutrule>{{cite news|title=FCC Votes Unanimously to Scrap Sports Blackout Rule|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/fcc-votes-unanimously-to-end-sports-blackout-rules-1412091621|author=Gautham Nagesh|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]]|date=September 30, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, no games would be blacked out at all during the [[2014 NFL season|2014 season]].<ref name=espn-nflblackoutoneyear>{{cite web|title=NFL to suspend TV blackout policy|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12545081/nfl-suspend-tv-blackout-policy-2015-owners-vote|agency=Associated Press|website=ESPN.com|date=March 23, 2015}}</ref> On March 23, 2015, the NFL's owners voted to suspend the blackout rules for the [[2015 NFL season]], meaning that all games would be televised in their home markets, regardless of ticket sales.<ref name=\"espn-nflblackoutoneyear\"/> The suspension continued into the [[2016 NFL season|2016 season]]; commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the league needed to further investigate the impact of removing the blackout rules before such a change is made permanent.<ref name=\"si-noblackouts16\">{{cite web|title=NFL continues suspension of local TV blackout policy for 2016|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2016/03/28/nfl-continues-suspension-tv-blackout-rule|website=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref> While the league never explicitly stated such, the blackout suspension has continued into 2019.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://buffalonews.com/2017/08/09/tasker-constant-bills-preseason-coverage/|first=Alan|last=Pergament|title=Tasker is only constant in Bills preseason coverage|newspaper=The Buffalo News|date=August 9, 2017|accessdate=9 August 2017|quote=All games are televised live, which can't help ticket sales for what amounts to practice games.}}</ref>\n\n==Blackout radius==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\nThe NFL defines a team's market area as \"local\" if it is within a {{convert|75|mi|km|sing=on}} radius of the team's home stadium. Therefore, a blackout affects any market where the [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]] broadcast signal of an [[Network affiliate|affiliate station]], under normal conditions, penetrates into the 75-mile radius. These affiliates are determined before the season, and do not change as the season progresses. Some remote primary media markets, such as [[Denver]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], may cover that entire radius, so that the blackout would not affect any other affiliates. However, in some instances, a very tiny portion of a distant city's market area can be within the 75-mile radius of a different city, therefore leading to blackouts well beyond the targeted area.\n\nThe most notable example is the blackout of [[Buffalo Bills]] games within the [[Syracuse, New York]] market because a small section of the town of [[Italy, New York|Italy]] in [[Yates County, New York|Yates County]], containing a handful of people, lies within the 75-mile radius of [[New Era Field]] (a stadium that has failed to sell out numerous times, mainly due to the [[Lake-effect snow|harsh winter weather the area receives]] on the shores of [[Lake Erie]]) while the entirety of the remainder of the Syracuse market lies outside of it. Yates County was previously part of the Syracuse DMA (Designated Market Area), but it was later transferred into the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] DMA because of [[exurb]] expansion with an increasing number of employees working in the immediate Rochester area living in Yates County and traveling to Rochester for events. Despite this, the league still enforced Bills blackouts for Syracuse and, because the [[Mohawk Valley]] did not have a [[CBS]] affiliate of its own and relied on Syracuse CBS affiliate [[WTVH]] to cover that area, the Mohawk Valley DMA as well (despite the fact that no part of that area comes remotely close to the 75-mile threshold); because of this, the Bills' blackout radius extended hundreds of miles beyond the actual stadium, well into [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer County]]. (In 2015, the [[WKTV#WKTV-DT2 (CBS)|DT2]] subchannel of [[Utica, New York|Utica]]'s [[NBC]] affiliate [[WKTV]] affiliated with CBS, ending the Mohawk Valley's blackouts; should the blackout rule be reimposed, that market will no longer face blackouts.)\n\nThe NFL does allow in some cases for secondary markets to extend beyond the 75&nbsp;mile radius in part to help draw fans to attend the game. Some of these exceptions are in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], where many of its secondary markets lie outside the 75&nbsp;mile radius ([[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] and [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]]). Others include [[San Diego]], primarily due to Los Angeles ({{convert|116|mi|km}} from San Diego) not having had an NFL team from 1994 (when the [[St. Louis Rams|Rams]] relocated from Los Angeles to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]) until 2016 (when team returned to Los Angeles for the [[2016 NFL season|2016 season]]), as southern parts of the Los Angeles market are within San Diego's 75-mile radius.\n\nAn exception to the 75-mile rule is the [[Green Bay Packers]]' market area, which stretches out to both the [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] and [[Milwaukee]] television markets (the team's radio [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] station [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ]] is in Milwaukee, and select Packer home games were played in that city until 1994). Unofficially, and to a smaller extent, it also reaches the [[Escanaba, Michigan|Escanaba]]\u2013[[Marquette, Michigan]] market due to the presence of [[broadcast translator|translator]] and [[Broadcast relay station#Satellite stations|satellite station]]s as well as extended cable coverage of stations from the Green Bay market north into the [[Upper Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]]. However, blackouts at the Packers have never occurred; the Packers' home stadium, [[Lambeau Field]], boasts a five-decade-long streak of sellouts. The [[Denver Broncos]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[Washington Redskins]] also have sellout streaks that predate the current blackout rules, and therefore have not had any of their home games blacked out since 1972 (each of these teams also have long waiting lists for season tickets).\n\nSimilarly, no [[Super Bowl]] has ever been unavailable in the market of origin since [[Super Bowl VII]] in 1973. Every Super Bowl except the first has been a sellout, and, with the game's high-profile status, a television blackout is highly unlikely.\n\n==No opposing games==\nAnother policy to encourage sellouts is, except in Week 17, no other NFL game can air opposite the local franchise's broadcast on the primary market's affiliate due to NFL rules or due to a blackout.\n* If a local franchise is playing at home, and the broadcast is part of a [[doubleheader (television)|doubleheader]], the other network (which shows the single game) may only show a game in the opposite time slot;\n* If a local franchise is playing at home, and the broadcast is shown by the network carrying only one game, the other network (which shows the doubleheader) may only show a game in the opposite time slot;\n* If a local franchise is playing an away game, and the broadcast is shown by the network on which it is the only NFL game it is airing that week, the other network (which shows the doubleheader) may air both of their games;\n* If a local franchise is playing on the road on the network carrying a doubleheader, the other network can air its single game in the same timeslot opposite the local franchise's game. However, affiliates in the local franchise's primary market almost always opt against it because such an action usually ensures low ratings. The \"no opposing game\" policy is a key reason why single game fixtures on the East Coast are occasionally scheduled for the late time slot.\n\nSpecial exemptions are in effect when other events (such as the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open Tennis Championships Final]] through 2014, the [[Major League Baseball playoffs]], golf's [[Ryder Cup]] in 1991 and 1995, or the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] final) air on one of the two networks broadcasting Sunday games, which typically have a 4:30&nbsp;p.m. start time (tennis or baseball), or will run through 1:00&nbsp;p.m. (soccer and golf). The network airing the event is given the single game at 1:00 or 4:00&nbsp;p.m. that week, and can broadcast games opposite the team that has a home game on their network at the same time during the affected weeks. This was most notably used by CBS for tennis, NBC for golf, and all three networks that have aired Sunday games (CBS, [[NBC]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]) have used the exemption for baseball.  Fox is expected to use the exemption in 2022 because of an eight-hour time difference between the Eastern time zone and Qatar, and the World Cup Final would start no later than 1 PM EST.\n\nAs of the 2014 season, these rules do not apply in Week 17, where playoff or draft implications are affected by many games. Because of the nature of Week 17 games with playoff implications, all restrictions except the blackout for failure to sell out games rule are waived, giving Fox and CBS doubleheaders for Week 17 in all markets, regardless of whether the local team is at home.<ref>{{cite web|title=NFL Communications: WEEK 17 FLEX SCHEDULING|url=https://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/2014week-17-flex-final-3.pdf|website=NFL.com|date=December 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\nEach television market, including one hosting a game that is not sold out, is assured of at least one televised game in the early and late time slots, one game on each network, but no network doubleheader in the home market of a game that is not sold out.\n* If a blackout is in the early game of a doubleheader, the network may not air a game in the late game slot;\n* If a blackout is in the late game of a doubleheader, the network may not air a game in the early game slot;\n* If a blackout is in the early game slot and shown by the network scheduled to carry a single game, the network must show another game in the early or late game slot;\n* If a blackout is in the late game slot, shown by the network scheduled to carry a single game and is the only game in the late game slot, the network must show a game during the early game slot.\n\nThe New York and [[San Francisco Bay Area]] markets typically get fewer doubleheaders than other markets as those markets each have two teams, and one of them is playing at home virtually every week. The main exception is when one of the teams is idle, has its home game televised on the doubleheader network, or is chosen for a [[prime time]] game, as well as when the teams play each other on the network carrying a doubleheader or if a team is playing in the International Series. This policy affects only the franchise's primary market, not others with signals that penetrate inside the 75-mile radius. It also does not affect viewers of [[NFL Sunday Ticket]] in the primary market; all other games remain available.\n\nSome markets, like those in Southwest Georgia, can see up to five (or even six) NFL games a week, with different network affiliates offering games involving the Falcons and Jaguars, and doubleheaders for the other conference's affiliate in the same market.  Central New Jersey offers similar access to the New York and Philadelphia markets.\n\n==Blackout procedure==\nIf a home game is unavailable locally because it is not sold out before the 72-hour deadline, one of the following situations will occur:\n* If the blacked out home game is a nationally televised game on a broadcast network (such as on NBC for its ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' telecast), where no other NFL games are played at the same time, all local stations inside the 75-mile radius must broadcast alternative programming (the stations have to program the time themselves, since other affiliates are showing the game). This scenario is unlikely to happen since the 2006 NFL rule changes regarding reassigning game start times for Sunday games, known as \"flexible scheduling.\" As a result of the rule change, Sunday night games are scheduled to have highly anticipated contests featuring teams in good form. As a result, the chances of a home game not selling out during the first quarter of the season, when there is still hope for a team to rebound after a poor start, are remote, and the only possible situations where this is likely to happen are on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] or [[Christmas]] ([[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day games]] for all three rightsholder networks are assigned in advance, and in years when Christmas Eve falls during the weekend (if on a Saturday, most NFL Sunday games, except the one Christmas Day game on Sunday night, are assigned to Saturday, and if on a Sunday, NBC's game is assigned to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on Christmas Day \u2013 if observed on a Monday, so that game is assigned in advance).\n\nThe 2006 NFL rule change allows NBC and the NFL to reassign game start times for Sunday games only, beginning in Week 11, although the NFL changed this clause to Week 5 in 2014 (with the rule that only two of the six possible Sunday night games could have reassigned start times). Therefore, if a late-season match features a game with no playoff implications (both teams have been eliminated, or the game has no seeding implications), often with the home team already eliminated, and thus would be unlikely to sell out, it will be moved to Sunday afternoon in favor of a better game (a prime example being in 2010 when a game between the Chargers and the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] was moved to the afternoon in favor of one involving the [[Minnesota Vikings]] and [[Philadelphia Eagles]], which ended up being played on Tuesday due to [[December 2010 North American blizzard|severe winter weather in the Philadelphia area]]; the Bengals game ended up being blacked out, and thus [[WKRC-TV]] and two other nearby CBS affiliates \u2013 [[WHIO-TV]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]] and [[WKYT-TV]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] \u2013 could not carry it).\n* If the blacked-out nationally televised game is being shown on a cable network (such as [[ESPN]] or the [[NFL Network]]), all cable and satellite television providers in markets that are within the 75-mile radius, in addition already to the primary market of the home team (which is already blacked out), must black out the cable broadcaster's feed to customers in affected markets during the game (this is a condition of the channels' agreements with both the league and the providers). In addition, the game is not simulcast on a local broadcast station in the blacked-out markets. Local stations would still be able to show highlights during their newscasts after the game has concluded. In areas where the game is blacked out, ESPN and the NFL Network would generally offer alternate programming (ESPN traditionally switches to a simulcast of [[ESPNews]]). As ESPN and NFL Network games featuring the local teams are syndicated in the local markets under the NFL's anti-siphoning policies, the station that holds local rights to the cable broadcasts but cannot show the games originally scheduled to be carried would either run their own alternate programming or, if affiliated with a major network, show the regularly scheduled network programming for that night. During the pre-season, blacked out games can be aired in their entirety, but only on [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] (generally after late-evening newscasts).\n* If the blacked-out home game is played on a Sunday afternoon, all local stations inside the 75-mile radius must show a different NFL game during that time slot \u2013 the network typically chooses the game (typically a #1 game for that slot). In addition, NFL Sunday Ticket cannot telecast the game within that area. As already stated, the network scheduled to run a doubleheader can broadcast only one game into that team's primary market (usually the #1&nbsp;game), which is designed to prevent viewers from opting to watch the other televised NFL games instead of attending that involving their local team. Again, the secondary markets would still carry a doubleheader. In some cases, the network-affiliated stations will switch time slots so that the network running the doubleheader can still show its featured 4:25&nbsp;p.m. (Eastern Time) game.\n* The NFL Mobile app for mobile devices periodically checks the user's location in order to enforce blackouts, and will not show a blacked-out game if the device is being used in the game's home market. Transmissions are also blacked out if the mobile device utilizes cell towers or wifi signals within or near the home stadium.\n\nIn 2005, for the first time in its history, the NFL lifted the blackout policies for a team: the [[New Orleans Saints]]. [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Saints|Due to damage]] caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]], the Saints split their home games between [[Giants Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]], [[Tiger Stadium (Baton Rouge)|Tiger Stadium]] at [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], and the [[Alamodome]] in [[San Antonio]], with most home games being played in Baton Rouge. Baton Rouge is a secondary market for the Saints and is subject to blackouts when games held at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Superdome]] carried by over-the-air networks do not sell out, since CBS affiliate [[WAFB]] and Fox affiliate [[WGMB]] reach within 75&nbsp;miles of the Superdome, even though the city limits of Baton Rouge are more than 75&nbsp;miles from the stadium (the Baton Rouge DMA is not subjected to a blackout when Saints games televised by ESPN or the NFL Network do not sell out).\n\nSan Antonio is an unofficial secondary market for the [[Dallas Cowboys]] (in that the Cowboys games are routinely televised in that area, but the area is not within the 75&nbsp;mile blackout radius), and two of three Saints games in 2005 played at the Alamodome were not broadcast anywhere in [[Texas]], as the start times for the Cowboys and Saints games conflicted on those dates. The only game of the San Antonio dates not to sell out, in Week 4 against Buffalo, was televised locally by CBS (on [[KENS-TV]]) as the Cowboys had a late game that day against the [[Oakland Raiders]] at [[McAfee Coliseum]] (Fox affiliate [[KABB]], therefore, never broadcast a Saints home game in the San Antonio market, as the Cowboys and Saints are in the [[National Football Conference]], and the Cowboys have a larger following in Texas).<ref>{{cite press release|title=No blackout for Saints games in Baton Rouge|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/story/NO/9005538|website=NFL.com|date=October 26, 2005|accessdate=July 11, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714095700/http://www.nfl.com/teams/story/NO/9005538|archivedate=July 14, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe blackout policies extend even to the [[Pro Bowl]]; if that game is not sold out, it is not televised in the home media market. From 1980 to 2009, and again from 2011 to 2014, the game was played in [[Halawa]], making the applicable market the entire state of [[Hawaii]].<ref name=\"probowlblackout\"/> The 2010&nbsp;game was played in the [[Miami]] area (at [[Sun Life Stadium]]).\n\nDue to decreasing ticket sales, the league significantly softened its blackout policy in 2009. Though the traditional rules still apply, the league is using some of its new media features to provide access to untelecasted games. For instance, the league will not subject its \"[[NFL Network#NFL Red Zone Channel|RedZone]]\" channel to any blackouts. In addition, complete live games will be made available for free online on the Monday (except ''Monday Night Football''), Tuesday and Wednesday following the game, if the game is blacked out, using the league's ''Game Rewind'' package.<ref>{{cite press release|title=NFL.com to show blacked-out games free in local markets on delayed basis|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8127eb87/article/nflcom-to-show-blackedout-games-free-in-local-markets-on-delayed-basis|website=NFL.com|date=September 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nCritics claim that these blackout policies are largely ineffective in creating sold out, filled stadiums. They contend that there are other factors that prevent sellouts, such as high ticket prices and low enthusiasm for a losing team. Furthermore, it has been argued that blackouts hurt the league; without the television exposure, it becomes more difficult for those teams with low attendance and few sellouts to increase their popularity and following as the exposure decreases.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ralph Nader's op-ed opposing the NFL's blackout rule|url=http://www.leagueoffans.org/blackoutoped.html|author=Ralph Nader|website=LeagueOfFans.org (republished)|publisher=[[Democrat and Chronicle]]|page=5A|date=August 17, 1998|accessdate=July 11, 2007}}</ref>\n\nConversely, the NFL has sold out well over 90% of games in recent seasons. Additionally, many teams sell out their entire regular season schedule before it begins (usually through season-ticket sales; at least half of all NFL teams have a season-ticket waiting list), and so there is no threat of a blackout in those markets.\n\n==Market and year of last blackout/non-sellout==\n* [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] (1968; before 1973 rules)\n* Denver (1969; in AFL, before 1973 rules)\n* [[Pittsburgh]] (1972; before 1973 rules)\n* [[New York Metropolitan Area|New York City\u2013North Jersey]] (1977)<sup>1</sup>\n* [[San Francisco]] (1981)\n* Green Bay (1983)\n* [[Chicago]] (1984)\n* [[Dallas]] (1990)\n* [[New England]] (1993)\n* [[Greater Los Angeles area|Los Angeles\u2013Anaheim]] (1994)\n* [[Cleveland]] (1995)<sup>3</sup>\n* [[Houston]] (1996)<sup>2</sup>\n* [[Baltimore]] (1997)<ref>{{cite news|title=Domination on ground lifts Ravens RAVENS 23, BENGALS 10|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-09-08/sports/1997251111_1_ravens-baltimore-fans-bengals|author=Vito Stellino|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=September 8, 1997|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}</ref> \n* [[Minnesota]] (1997)\n* [[Miami]] (1998)\n* [[Nashville]] (1998)\n* [[Philadelphia]] (1999)\n* [[Carolinas|Carolina]] (2002)\n* [[Seattle]] (2003)\n* [[Indianapolis]] (2003)\n* [[New Orleans]] (2004)\n* [[Arizona]] (2005)\n* [[Atlanta]] (2007)\n* [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] (2009)\n* [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] (2009)\n* [[Detroit]] (2010)\n* Cincinnati (2012)\n* [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa Bay]] (2012)\n* [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] (2012)\n* [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] (2013)\n\nNotes:\n* <sup>1</sup> The last blackout for the [[New York Giants]] was in 1975, and the Jets in 1977; in both seasons, the teams played in New York City's [[Shea Stadium]]. In the Giants' case, Shea was a temporary home, since [[Giants Stadium]] was still under construction. Both have sold out all of their games since relocating to North New Jersey in 1976 and 1984, respectively.\n* <sup>2</sup> The last blackout in Houston was when the Oilers resided there in their last season in the city in 1996. The Texans have always sold out in the city since their inception.\n* <sup>3</sup> The last two games of the 1995 season failed to sell out after the team's ownership [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|announced the team's move to Baltimore]].\n\n==Secondary markets==\nThe league also designates \"secondary markets\", usually adjoining primary markets (generally areas within 75&nbsp;miles of a stadium, but not having their own team) that are also required to show the local NFL franchise. Generally, these secondary markets must show the away games but are not obligated to telecast the designated team's sold out home games.\n\nTheir decision on whether to show home games typically depends on whether the NFL-designated local team is perceived to be the most popular in the market. For example, [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] is a secondary market to the [[Baltimore Ravens]]; therefore the Harrisburg market's CBS affiliate, [[WHP-TV]], must show all Ravens away games. However, since there are many [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] fans in the region, when the Ravens are home at the same time the Steelers are playing, that station shows the latter game. Harrisburg is thus considered a battleground territory for the [[Steelers\u2013Ravens rivalry]].\n\nThe same applies for the [[Orlando, Florida]] metropolitan area, as its local CBS affiliate [[WKMG-TV]] broadcasts both [[Miami Dolphins]] and Jacksonville Jaguars games. In some cases, the NFL has the two teams play at different times to accommodate the entire state of [[Florida]] (but only when CBS has the doubleheader, or if one of the teams is on Fox). WKMG lobbied to carry a Dolphins game against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in 2005, but the NFL refused this request \u2013 as Orlando is officially a Jaguars secondary market (despite downtown Orlando being 141 miles from the Jaguars' home stadium, [[TIAA Bank Field]], compared to 88 miles from the Buccaneers' home, [[Raymond James Stadium]]) the station had to carry the Jaguars game at Pittsburgh. This issue again came up in 2013, during Week 2, when CBS' late game window featured two games: the Denver Broncos at the [[New York Giants]] (which was a much-hyped matchup between brothers [[Peyton Manning|Peyton]] and [[Eli Manning]]) and the Jaguars at the [[Oakland Raiders]] (a matchup of two teams that were not expected to contend for the playoffs). Again, since Orlando is a secondary market of the Jaguars, WKMG was required to carry the latter game; the station notoriously apologized for having to show the Jaguars game.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/15/jaguars-apology-orlando-tv-station_n_3932351.html TV Station Forced To Broadcast Jaguars: WKMG-TV Apologies For \u2018Inconvenience\u2019 Of Bad Team {{!}} Huffington Post]</ref><ref>[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-09-17/sports/os-mike-bianchi-jaguars-orlando-tv-0918-20130917_1_jacksonville-jaguars-eli-manning-manning-bowl If Jags want Orlando to watch them on TV, play games here instead of London {{!}} Orlando Sentinel]</ref><ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/orlando-tv-station-apologizes-for-airing-jaguars-2013-9 Orlando TV Station Airs Public Apology For Having To Broadcast Jacksonville Jaguars Games {{!}} Business Insider]</ref> There have been exceptions, however; in the last week of the [[2016 NFL season|2016 season]], the Jaguars played their regular season finale on the road at the [[Indianapolis Colts]], while the Dolphins played their regular season finale against the [[New England Patriots]] at home. Since the Jaguars were on the road, this should have meant WKMG would be required to carry the Jaguars-Colts game. However, the Jaguars granted a one-time waiver of the secondary markets rule requirement for the Orlando market, thus allowing WKMG to air the Patriots-Dolphins game; this is most likely because the Dolphins had clinched a playoff spot the previous week and the Patriots were going for home-field advantage in the AFC, while both the Jaguars and Colts had both been eliminated from playoff contention.\n\n===Two-team secondary markets===\nThere are rare instances where a market will have two teams claiming their territory. For instance, [[Youngstown, Ohio]] lies roughly halfway between Cleveland and Pittsburgh, is within the 75-mile radius for both cities and is considered a battleground territory in the [[Browns\u2013Steelers rivalry]]. Therefore, local CBS affiliate [[WKBN-TV]] must show whichever team is playing an away game. If one game is on CBS while the other is on Fox, both games will air (WKBN's parent company also owns [[Low-power broadcasting|low-powered]] Fox affiliate [[WYFX-LD]], which is simulcast on WKBN's second [[digital subchannel]]).\n\nIf both the Cleveland Browns and the Pittsburgh Steelers are scheduled to play at the same time on CBS or Fox and the location of the game does not matter, WKBN/WYFX will usually air the Browns game. However, on December 2, 2012, when the Browns played at the Raiders and the Steelers played at the Ravens in the late window of a CBS doubleheader, WKBN aired the Steelers game as the former was between two teams that were out of playoff contention, while the latter was between two teams that were in playoff contention (as well as the [[AFC North]] title), and was also the main game of the late CBS window. The fan base is evenly split between those two teams, with the [[San Francisco 49ers]] also having a small following due to team owners [[John York|John]] and [[Denise DeBartolo York]] being based out of the Youngstown suburb of [[Canfield, Ohio]].\n\nSimilar issues concerning the same market teams occurred with CBS affiliate [[WTRF]] in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], which formerly carried Fox programming on its 7.2 subchannel ([[WTRF-DT2|Fox Ohio Valley]]) until 2014, when [[WTOV-TV]] took over the affiliation on one of its subchannels. At times, WTRF would run a game broadcast by Fox on the subchannel opposite a Browns or Steelers home game that aired on the main CBS feed regardless, and vice versa.\n\n===\"Unofficial\" and \"temporary\" secondary markets===\nMany markets serve as \"unofficial\" secondary markets for the league's various teams due to rooting interest in those markets. As they are not designated by the NFL as official secondary markets, they technically are not required to air any games, but will do so to please the fanbases.\n\nFor example, in Texas, virtually all CBS and Fox stations respectively carry the [[Houston Texans]] and Dallas Cowboys when games involving those teams are on different networks. However until 2010, CBS [[owned-and-operated station]] [[KTVT]] in Dallas rarely aired Texans games unless it had no other option; but for the [[2011 NFL season|2011 season]], it carried most Texans games, except for a handful of conflicts. Fox owned-and-operated station [[KRIV (TV)|KRIV]] in Houston always airs Cowboys games if it is not prohibited from doing so by NFL rules. In another example, [[Seattle Seahawks]] games are usually aired on Fox (and occasionally CBS) stations across the entire [[Pacific Northwest]] as the team is the only NFL franchise in the area.\n\nThe [[New England Patriots]], especially since [[Tom Brady]] became quarterback, also have almost all of New England as unofficial secondary markets ([[Providence, Rhode Island]] is an official secondary market). Not only do all or almost all CBS or Fox (depending on the game carrier) affiliates in New England carry Patriots games, but the team's syndicated preseason broadcasts cover the entire region. [[Hartford, Connecticut]] is within proximity to New York, and stations in that market have sometimes aired a [[New York Jets]] game instead; however, this rarely occurs.\n\nThe New York Giants have most of the markets in [[upstate New York]] (with the exception of [[Western New York]], which belongs to the Buffalo Bills) as unofficial secondary markets. [[Albany, New York|Albany]] is considered an official secondary market of the Giants. In addition, [[Burlington, Vermont]] (whose Fox affiliate, [[WFFF-TV]], has a coverage area that includes [[Plattsburgh, New York|Plattsburgh]] in the eastern corner of New York) has become an unofficial market for the Giants, preventing the Patriots from having full control over all New England markets (the Patriots, as an [[American Football Conference]] team, still receive copious coverage on the local CBS affiliate, [[WCAX-TV]]). An example of this occurred on September 27, 2009, when the [[2009 New York Giants season|Giants]] hosted the [[2009 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and the [[2009 New England Patriots season|Patriots]] hosted the [[2009 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], both at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time. WFFF-TV, which covers most of the state of [[Vermont]] and also extreme northern New York, broadcast the Giants game, as it is used to airing the team's games as a Fox affiliate. More recently, however, WFFF-TV has aired Patriots games over those involving the Giants when the former is featured on the network. Boston affiliate [[WFXT]] generally (but not always) carries Fox's Sunday-afternoon Giants games other than those that cannot be carried on the station because the New England Patriots are playing a home game at the same time. Providence affiliate [[WNAC-TV]] carries Fox's Giants' games unless the network is broadcasting a Patriots' home game at the same time the Giants are playing. \n\nSpecifically due to the issues with requirements for [[Hartford, Connecticut]] CBS affiliate [[WFSB]] to carry mainly [[New York Jets]] games as a secondary market most weeks (and to a much lesser extent, the [[Buffalo Bills]]), [[Meredith Corporation]] established a new CBS affiliate in the [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] market in 2003, [[WSHM-LD]], in order to allow that market to become a Patriots secondary market; previously, Meredith's WFSB served as the default CBS affiliate for the Springfield market, which otherwise contains only two other full-power commercial stations. This became a liability as the [[Tom Brady and Bill Belichick era|Patriots dynasty]] began, as viewers north of the Connecticut/Massachusetts line could not watch their home state's team most weeks. Four years later, ABC affiliate [[WGGB-TV]] established their own Fox DT2 subchannel, taking over from Hartford's [[WTIC-TV]] as Springfield's default Fox affiliate and allowing that market access to the remainder of Patriots Sunday home games with an NFC opponent (WGGB-DT2 otherwise carries mainly Giants home games like the remainder of New England's other stations). Over time however with the sustained success of the Patriots, WFSB has mainly moved towards carrying their games, with the Jets losing games on that station as time has gone on.\n\nSince 1995, the [[San Francisco 49ers]] have had most of [[California]] from the Oregon-California border south to Los Angeles as an unofficial secondary market, although the Los Angeles area was a secondary market for the [[San Diego Chargers]] until the Rams' return to Los Angeles in 2016 ([[Sacramento]] is an official secondary market to both the 49ers and the Raiders).\n\nAn oddity of \"temporary\" secondary markets have occurred in [[Wisconsin]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[South Carolina]] as a result of a rooting interest in one particular player. After the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]], quarterback [[Brett Favre]] departed the Green Bay Packers for the New York Jets. As a result, CBS affiliates [[WFRV]] in Green Bay (which was formerly owned by CBS) and [[WDJT-TV]] in Milwaukee were able to ask for as many Jets games as CBS and the NFL could offer to their viewers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Favre lands Jets on CBS |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=781043 |newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]] |publisher=[[Journal Media Group|Journal Communications]] |date=August 8, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816164539/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=781043 |archivedate=August 16, 2008 }}</ref> In 2009, when Favre moved to an NFC North division rival, the Minnesota Vikings, Fox affiliates [[WLUK-TV]] in Green Bay and [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] in Milwaukee requested as many Vikings games on their stations as possible. This also occurred in 2011 in Seattle, where the market was able to broadcast Tennessee Titans games because former Seahawks quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] was a Titans starter, and local native and former [[University of Washington]] quarterback [[Jake Locker]] was drafted in the first round of the [[2011 NFL Draft]] by the Titans. Given these two fan favorites, local CBS affiliate [[KIRO-TV]] requested to air as many of these games as possible.<ref>{{cite news|title=Local stations to carry 8 Vikings games|url=http://archive.greenbaypressgazette.com/article/20090821/GPG0101/908210553/Local-stations-carry-8-Vikings-games|author=Warren Gerds|newspaper=[[Green Bay Press-Gazette]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=August 21, 2009|accessdate=April 23, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20150423195847/http://archive.greenbaypressgazette.com/article/20090821/GPG0101/908210553/Local-stations-carry-8-Vikings-games|archivedate=April 23, 2015}}</ref> In 2014, CBS affiliate [[WLTX]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]] requested to change game assignments for Week 17 from the [[2014 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]]&ndash;[[2014 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] game to the [[2014 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]]&ndash;[[2014 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] game; WLTX requested the change when the Browns had undrafted rookie quarterback [[Connor Shaw]], a fan favorite from the [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|University of South Carolina]], start the game.<ref>{{cite news|title=WLTX NFL Sunday: Browns, Ravens and Panthers, Falcons|url=http://www.wltx.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/12/23/wltx-nfl-sunday-browns-ravens-and-panthers-falcons/20827779/|author=Derry London|website=[[WLTX]]|publisher=Gannett Company|date=December 23, 2014|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] is not an official secondary market for any team, but all Chiefs games are televised in the market. Stations [[KWCH]] and [[KSAS-TV|KSAS]] almost always show the Cowboys and/or Broncos when they do not conflict with the Chiefs. \n\nIn 2018, stations in [[Oklahoma City]] and [[Tulsa]] started requesting as many [[Cleveland Browns]] games as possible when 2017 [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Baker Mayfield]], who starred for the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|University of Oklahoma]], became the team's starting quarterback. The networks complied, except in cases when the Browns and [[Dallas Cowboys]] were playing at the same time on the same network; the Cowboys have enjoyed a large base of support in neighboring Oklahoma since their founding in 1960. Previously, the [[Minnesota Vikings]] were requested as much as possible by Oklahoma stations due to the presence of former OU star running back [[Adrian Peterson]]. \n\nSince 2015, when 2014 Heisman winner [[Marcus Mariota]] from the [[Oregon Ducks football|University of Oregon]] was drafted by the Titans, stations in Oregon have carried most Tennessee games when they do not conflict with broadcasts of the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. Other instances of markets carrying contests featuring alumnus of the local college include [[Philadelphia Eagles]] games in [[Fargo, North Dakota]] (former [[North Dakota State Bison football|North Dakota State]] player [[Carson Wentz]] is currently the Eagles' starting quarterback), the Chiefs in [[Lubbock, Texas]], where [[Patrick Mahomes]] attended [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]]. and the Ravens in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where [[Lamar Jackson]] attended [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]].\n\n===Other information===\nIn all other markets, the networks are the sole arbiters of the telecast matches. However, they usually make their decisions after consulting with all of their local affiliates. On rarer occasions, some affiliates are offered a choice of a few games for a given time slot, if there is no game that stands out as appropriate. In those cases, some stations have allowed the viewers to vote online for their preferred game. In the early 1990s, [[New Orleans]] NBC affiliate [[WDSU]] conducted a poll via telephone during several weeks to select which game would be broadcast{{Citation needed|reason=source needed to confirm WDSU poll|date=April 2019}}\n\nFor example, during Week 3 of the [[2010 NFL season|2010 season]], Fox affiliate [[KMSS-TV]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] conducted an online viewer poll in which fans could choose between the [[2010 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]]&ndash;[[2010 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]] game and the [[2010 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]]&ndash;[[2010 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] game. The station is situated in the [[Ark-La-Tex]] region, where both the Saints and Cowboys have significant fan bases, due to the Shreveport market being situated on the northern border between [[Louisiana]] and Texas, including [[Texarkana, Texas|Texarkana]], and the southwest corner of Arkansas. The poll concluded with viewers choosing the Falcons-Saints game, even though Shreveport is closer to Dallas than New Orleans.<ref>{{cite web|title=KTAL NBC 6 \u2013 ArkLaTex homepage.com|url=http://www.kmsstv.com/saints-cowboys-poll|website=[[KTAL-TV]]/[[KMSS-TV]]/[[KSHV-TV]]|publisher=[[Nexstar Media Group]]|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}</ref>.

Although KCBS had the single game and was contractually obligated to carry the San Diego Chargers game at the Cleveland Browns in the early 10 a.m. PT slot since Los Angeles is an official secondary market of the Chargers, the Colts\u2013Raiders game had playoff implications as well as Los Angeles having a large Raiders fan base due to the fact that [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|the team played in Los Angeles from 1982 to 1994]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidesocal.com/tomhoffarth/2016/12/21/nfl-week-16-in-the-l-a-tv-market-cleveland-doesnt-want-browns-on-tv-well-get-em/|title=NFL Week 16 in the L.A.

This makes the NFL the only major professional sports league in the US that requires teams to sell out tickets in order to broadcast a game on television locally. Although nationally televised games in the other leagues are often blacked out on the national networks on which the game is airing in the local markets of the participating teams, they can still be seen on the local broadcast TV station or [[regional sports network]] that normally holds their local/regional broadcast rights. The league blackout policy has been suspended on a year-to-year basis since [[2015 NFL season|2015]].\n\nFurthermore, the NFL is the only league that imposes an [[anti-siphoning law|anti-siphoning rule]] in all teams' local markets: the NFL sells [[broadcast syndication|syndication rights]] of each team's Thursday and Monday night games to a local over-the-air station in each local market. The respective cable station must be blacked out when that team is playing the said game.\n\n==Getting around restrictions==\nPrior to 1973, all games were blacked out in the home city of origin and on any TV stations located within 75 miles of the team's home city, regardless of whether they were sold out. This policy, dating back to the NFL's emerging television years, resulted in home-city blackouts even during sold-out regular-season games and championship games. For instance, the 1958 [[1958 NFL Championship Game|\"Greatest Game Ever Played\"]] between the [[1958 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] and [[1958 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] was unavailable to viewers in the New York City market despite the sellout at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] (many fans rented hotel rooms or visited friends in areas of [[Connecticut]] or [[Pennsylvania]] where signals of TV stations carrying the game were available to watch the game on television, a practice that continued for Giants games through 1972). Similarly, all [[Super Bowl]] games prior to [[Super Bowl VII]] in January 1973 were not televised in the host city's market.\n\nThe policy was in effect when, in 1972, the [[1972 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] made the playoffs for only the second time in 27 seasons. Because all home games were blacked-out, politicians \u2013 including President [[Richard Nixon]], a devout football fan \u2013 were not able to watch their favorite team's home games, as the primary carrier for such games, [[CBS]] affiliate [[WUSA (TV)|WTOP-TV]] (now WUSA) was forced to black out the games and carry alternate programming. [[National Football League#Corporate structure|NFL commissioner]] [[Pete Rozelle]] refused to lift the blackout for the NFC Championship Game, despite a plea from [[United States Attorney General]] [[Richard Kleindienst]] (Nixon watched both 1972 Redskins playoff games from his Western White House in [[San Clemente, California]]). Kleindienst went on to suggest that the [[United States Congress]] re-evaluate the NFL's [[antitrust]] exemption.\n\nRozelle agreed to lift the blackout for [[Super Bowl VII]] on an \"experimental basis\", if the game sold-out ten or more days in advance.  With the game a sellout, viewers in the Los Angeles area were able to see the [[NBC]] telecast of the game.  Nonetheless, Congress intervened before the 1973 season anyway, passing Public Law 93-107, which eliminated the blackout of games in the home market so long as the game was sold out by 72&nbsp;hours before game time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rubin, Rozelle, the Redskins, and Super Bowl Blackouts|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index0f6b.html?p=5967|date=February 5, 2010|accessdate=February 20, 2017}}</ref> The league will sometimes change this deadline to 48&nbsp;hours if there are only a few thousand tickets left to be sold; much more rarely, the NFL will occasionally reduce the deadline to 24&nbsp;hours in special cases.<ref name=\"probowlblackout\">{{cite web|title=Local TV blackout still possible for Pro Bowl|url=http://www.nfl.com/probowl/story/09000d5d80e9da1e/article/local-tv-blackout-still-possible-for-pro-bowl|agency=[[Associated Press]]|website=NFL.com|date=February 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\nTickets in premium [[Club seating|club sections]] and [[luxury suite]]s have been excluded from the blackout rule (indeed modern NFL stadiums have reduced general seating in favor of club seating and luxury suites, as this makes it easier to sell out the stadium and avoid blackouts, and this revenue does not have to be shared with other franchises), as have unused tickets allocated to the visiting team. Alternatively, some NFL teams have arrangements with local [[television station]]s or businesses (often sponsors of the team and/or its local broadcasts) to purchase unsold tickets. Teams themselves are allowed to purchase remaining non-premium tickets at 34\u00a2 on the dollar (the portion subject to [[revenue sharing]]) to prevent a blackout.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blackout lifted for Broncos-Chargers|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/11/24/blackout-lifted-for-broncos-chargers/|website=ProFootballTalk|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|date=November 24, 2011|accessdate=April 18, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=If game faces TV blackout, Bills won't bail it out|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/incoming/article652246.ece|author=Gene Warner|newspaper=[[The Buffalo News]]|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=April 18, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924192306/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-30192789.html|archivedate=September 24, 2015}}</ref> Teams can also lift the blackout on their own; this has occasionally been done in cases of stormy weather on game days.\n\nThe NFL requires that closing off sections be done uniformly for every home game, including playoff games, in a given season. This prevents teams from trying to sell out the entire stadium only when they expect to be able to do so. For instance, the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] closed off a number of sections at their home stadium, [[EverBank Field]], to reduce the number of tickets they would need to sell. EverBank Field is one of the largest venues in the NFL, as it was built to also accommodate the annual [[Florida vs. Georgia Football Classic|Florida-Georgia game]] and [[Gator Bowl]] in [[college football]], and was expanded for [[Super Bowl XXXIX]], even though it draws from one of the smallest markets in the league.\n\nThe NFL authorized a new rule loosening the league's blackout restrictions during the 2012 offseason. Under the new rule, for the first time in NFL history, the ticket sales provision no longer requires a stadium to be sold out in order for a game to be televised; instead, teams are allowed to set a benchmark of anywhere from 85% to 100% of the stadium's non-premium seats. Any seats sold beyond that benchmark will be subject to heavier revenue sharing.<ref>{{cite news|title=Report: NFL team owners get more flexibility on blackouts|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/article929095.ece|newspaper=The Buffalo News|publisher=BH Media Group, LLC|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref> While most teams participate in the new blackout rules, four teams \u2013 the [[Buffalo Bills]], [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Indianapolis Colts]] and [[Los Angeles Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] \u2013 continue to follow the previous blackout rule, as under the 2012 rule modification, the teams would be required to pay a higher percentage of gate fees to the NFL's revenue fund.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bills aren't alone on blackout policy|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20120830/cityandregion/120839593|author=Gene Warner|publisher=BH Media Group, LLC|date=August 30, 2012|accessdate=August 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===End of FCC enforcement, temporary suspension===\nUntil September 2014, the NFL blackout rules were sanctioned by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), which enforced rules requiring [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television|satellite]] providers to not distribute any sports telecast that had been blacked out by a broadcast television station within their market of service. On September 9, 2014, ''[[USA Today]]'' published an [[editorial]] from FCC chairman [[Tom Wheeler]], which stated that he was submitting a proposal to \"get rid of the FCC's blackout rules once and for all\", to be voted on by the agency's members on September 30 of that year, declaring such policies to be \"obsolete\".<ref>{{cite news|title=FCC chairman: Sack the NFL's blackout rule|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/09/09/wheeler-fcc-nfl-blackout-rule-obsolete-column/15300147/|author=[[Tom Wheeler]]|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=September 9, 2014}}</ref> On September 30, 2014, the Commission voted unanimously to repeal the FCC's blackout rules. However, the removal of these rules are, to an extent, purely symbolic; the NFL can still enforce its blackout policies on a contractual basis with [[television network]]s, stations, and service providers \u2013 a process made feasible by the large amount of leverage the league places on its media partners.<ref name=forbes-elimination>{{cite web|title=The FCC's Elimination Of The Sports Blackout Rule Is Not A Touchdown For NFL Fans|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciajessop/2014/09/30/the-fccs-elimination-of-the-sports-blackout-rule-is-not-a-touchdown-for-nfl-fans/|author=Alicia Jessop|periodical=[[Forbes]]|publisher=Forbes Inc.|date=September 30, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref><ref name=fcc-blackoutrule>{{cite news|title=FCC Votes Unanimously to Scrap Sports Blackout Rule|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/fcc-votes-unanimously-to-end-sports-blackout-rules-1412091621|author=Gautham Nagesh|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]]|date=September 30, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, no games would be blacked out at all during the [[2014 NFL season|2014 season]].<ref name=espn-nflblackoutoneyear>{{cite web|title=NFL to suspend TV blackout policy|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12545081/nfl-suspend-tv-blackout-policy-2015-owners-vote|agency=Associated Press|website=ESPN.com|date=March 23, 2015}}</ref> On March 23, 2015, the NFL's owners voted to suspend the blackout rules for the [[2015 NFL season]], meaning that all games would be televised in their home markets, regardless of ticket sales.<ref name=\"espn-nflblackoutoneyear\"/> The suspension continued into the [[2016 NFL season|2016 season]]; commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the league needed to further investigate the impact of removing the blackout rules before such a change is made permanent.<ref name=\"si-noblackouts16\">{{cite web|title=NFL continues suspension of local TV blackout policy for 2016|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2016/03/28/nfl-continues-suspension-tv-blackout-rule|website=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref> While the league never explicitly stated such, the blackout suspension has continued into 2019.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://buffalonews.com/2017/08/09/tasker-constant-bills-preseason-coverage/|first=Alan|last=Pergament|title=Tasker is only constant in Bills preseason coverage|newspaper=The Buffalo News|date=August 9, 2017|accessdate=9 August 2017|quote=All games are televised live, which can't help ticket sales for what amounts to practice games.}}</ref>\n\n==Blackout radius==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\nThe NFL defines a team's market area as \"local\" if it is within a {{convert|75|mi|km|sing=on}} radius of the team's home stadium. Therefore, a blackout affects any market where the [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]] broadcast signal of an [[Network affiliate|affiliate station]], under normal conditions, penetrates into the 75-mile radius. These affiliates are determined before the season, and do not change as the season progresses. Some remote primary media markets, such as [[Denver]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], may cover that entire radius, so that the blackout would not affect any other affiliates. However, in some instances, a very tiny portion of a distant city's market area can be within the 75-mile radius of a different city, therefore leading to blackouts well beyond the targeted area.\n\nThe most notable example is the blackout of [[Buffalo Bills]] games within the [[Syracuse, New York]] market because a small section of the town of [[Italy, New York|Italy]] in [[Yates County, New York|Yates County]], containing a handful of people, lies within the 75-mile radius of [[New Era Field]] (a stadium that has failed to sell out numerous times, mainly due to the [[Lake-effect snow|harsh winter weather the area receives]] on the shores of [[Lake Erie]]) while the entirety of the remainder of the Syracuse market lies outside of it. Yates County was previously part of the Syracuse DMA (Designated Market Area), but it was later transferred into the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] DMA because of [[exurb]] expansion with an increasing number of employees working in the immediate Rochester area living in Yates County and traveling to Rochester for events. Despite this, the league still enforced Bills blackouts for Syracuse and, because the [[Mohawk Valley]] did not have a [[CBS]] affiliate of its own and relied on Syracuse CBS affiliate [[WTVH]] to cover that area, the Mohawk Valley DMA as well (despite the fact that no part of that area comes remotely close to the 75-mile threshold); because of this, the Bills' blackout radius extended hundreds of miles beyond the actual stadium, well into [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer County]]. (In 2015, the [[WKTV#WKTV-DT2 (CBS)|DT2]] subchannel of [[Utica, New York|Utica]]'s [[NBC]] affiliate [[WKTV]] affiliated with CBS, ending the Mohawk Valley's blackouts; should the blackout rule be reimposed, that market will no longer face blackouts.)\n\nThe NFL does allow in some cases for secondary markets to extend beyond the 75&nbsp;mile radius in part to help draw fans to attend the game. Some of these exceptions are in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], where many of its secondary markets lie outside the 75&nbsp;mile radius ([[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] and [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]]). Others include [[San Diego]], primarily due to Los Angeles ({{convert|116|mi|km}} from San Diego) not having had an NFL team from 1994 (when the [[St. Louis Rams|Rams]] relocated from Los Angeles to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]) until 2016 (when team returned to Los Angeles for the [[2016 NFL season|2016 season]]), as southern parts of the Los Angeles market are within San Diego's 75-mile radius.\n\nAn exception to the 75-mile rule is the [[Green Bay Packers]]' market area, which stretches out to both the [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] and [[Milwaukee]] television markets (the team's radio [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] station [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ]] is in Milwaukee, and select Packer home games were played in that city until 1994). Unofficially, and to a smaller extent, it also reaches the [[Escanaba, Michigan|Escanaba]]\u2013[[Marquette, Michigan]] market due to the presence of [[broadcast translator|translator]] and [[Broadcast relay station#Satellite stations|satellite station]]s as well as extended cable coverage of stations from the Green Bay market north into the [[Upper Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]]. However, blackouts at the Packers have never occurred; the Packers' home stadium, [[Lambeau Field]], boasts a five-decade-long streak of sellouts. The [[Denver Broncos]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[Washington Redskins]] also have sellout streaks that predate the current blackout rules, and therefore have not had any of their home games blacked out since 1972 (each of these teams also have long waiting lists for season tickets).\n\nSimilarly, no [[Super Bowl]] has ever been unavailable in the market of origin since [[Super Bowl VII]] in 1973. Every Super Bowl except the first has been a sellout, and, with the game's high-profile status, a television blackout is highly unlikely.\n\n==No opposing games==\nAnother policy to encourage sellouts is, except in Week 17, no other NFL game can air opposite the local franchise's broadcast on the primary market's affiliate due to NFL rules or due to a blackout.\n* If a local franchise is playing at home, and the broadcast is part of a [[doubleheader (television)|doubleheader]], the other network (which shows the single game) may only show a game in the opposite time slot;\n* If a local franchise is playing at home, and the broadcast is shown by the network carrying only one game, the other network (which shows the doubleheader) may only show a game in the opposite time slot;\n* If a local franchise is playing an away game, and the broadcast is shown by the network on which it is the only NFL game it is airing that week, the other network (which shows the doubleheader) may air both of their games;\n* If a local franchise is playing on the road on the network carrying a doubleheader, the other network can air its single game in the same timeslot opposite the local franchise's game. However, affiliates in the local franchise's primary market almost always opt against it because such an action usually ensures low ratings. The \"no opposing game\" policy is a key reason why single game fixtures on the East Coast are occasionally scheduled for the late time slot.\n\nSpecial exemptions are in effect when other events (such as the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open Tennis Championships Final]] through 2014, the [[Major League Baseball playoffs]], golf's [[Ryder Cup]] in 1991 and 1995, or the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] final) air on one of the two networks broadcasting Sunday games, which typically have a 4:30&nbsp;p.m. start time (tennis or baseball), or will run through 1:00&nbsp;p.m. (soccer and golf). The network airing the event is given the single game at 1:00 or 4:00&nbsp;p.m. that week, and can broadcast games opposite the team that has a home game on their network at the same time during the affected weeks. This was most notably used by CBS for tennis, NBC for golf, and all three networks that have aired Sunday games (CBS, [[NBC]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]) have used the exemption for baseball.  Fox is expected to use the exemption in 2022 because of an eight-hour time difference between the Eastern time zone and Qatar, and the World Cup Final would start no later than 1 PM EST.\n\nAs of the 2014 season, these rules do not apply in Week 17, where playoff or draft implications are affected by many games. Because of the nature of Week 17 games with playoff implications, all restrictions except the blackout for failure to sell out games rule are waived, giving Fox and CBS doubleheaders for Week 17 in all markets, regardless of whether the local team is at home.<ref>{{cite web|title=NFL Communications: WEEK 17 FLEX SCHEDULING|url=https://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/2014week-17-flex-final-3.pdf|website=NFL.com|date=December 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\nEach television market, including one hosting a game that is not sold out, is assured of at least one televised game in the early and late time slots, one game on each network, but no network doubleheader in the home market of a game that is not sold out.\n* If a blackout is in the early game of a doubleheader, the network may not air a game in the late game slot;\n* If a blackout is in the late game of a doubleheader, the network may not air a game in the early game slot;\n* If a blackout is in the early game slot and shown by the network scheduled to carry a single game, the network must show another game in the early or late game slot;\n* If a blackout is in the late game slot, shown by the network scheduled to carry a single game and is the only game in the late game slot, the network must show a game during the early game slot.\n\nThe New York and [[San Francisco Bay Area]] markets typically get fewer doubleheaders than other markets as those markets each have two teams, and one of them is playing at home virtually every week. The main exception is when one of the teams is idle, has its home game televised on the doubleheader network, or is chosen for a [[prime time]] game, as well as when the teams play each other on the network carrying a doubleheader or if a team is playing in the International Series. This policy affects only the franchise's primary market, not others with signals that penetrate inside the 75-mile radius. It also does not affect viewers of [[NFL Sunday Ticket]] in the primary market; all other games remain available.\n\nSome markets, like those in Southwest Georgia, can see up to five (or even six) NFL games a week, with different network affiliates offering games involving the Falcons and Jaguars, and doubleheaders for the other conference's affiliate in the same market.  Central New Jersey offers similar access to the New York and Philadelphia markets.\n\n==Blackout procedure==\nIf a home game is unavailable locally because it is not sold out before the 72-hour deadline, one of the following situations will occur:\n* If the blacked out home game is a nationally televised game on a broadcast network (such as on NBC for its ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' telecast), where no other NFL games are played at the same time, all local stations inside the 75-mile radius must broadcast alternative programming (the stations have to program the time themselves, since other affiliates are showing the game). This scenario is unlikely to happen since the 2006 NFL rule changes regarding reassigning game start times for Sunday games, known as \"flexible scheduling.\" As a result of the rule change, Sunday night games are scheduled to have highly anticipated contests featuring teams in good form. As a result, the chances of a home game not selling out during the first quarter of the season, when there is still hope for a team to rebound after a poor start, are remote, and the only possible situations where this is likely to happen are on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] or [[Christmas]] ([[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day games]] for all three rightsholder networks are assigned in advance, and in years when Christmas Eve falls during the weekend (if on a Saturday, most NFL Sunday games, except the one Christmas Day game on Sunday night, are assigned to Saturday, and if on a Sunday, NBC's game is assigned to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on Christmas Day \u2013 if observed on a Monday, so that game is assigned in advance).\n\nThe 2006 NFL rule change allows NBC and the NFL to reassign game start times for Sunday games only, beginning in Week 11, although the NFL changed this clause to Week 5 in 2014 (with the rule that only two of the six possible Sunday night games could have reassigned start times). Therefore, if a late-season match features a game with no playoff implications (both teams have been eliminated, or the game has no seeding implications), often with the home team already eliminated, and thus would be unlikely to sell out, it will be moved to Sunday afternoon in favor of a better game (a prime example being in 2010 when a game between the Chargers and the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] was moved to the afternoon in favor of one involving the [[Minnesota Vikings]] and [[Philadelphia Eagles]], which ended up being played on Tuesday due to [[December 2010 North American blizzard|severe winter weather in the Philadelphia area]]; the Bengals game ended up being blacked out, and thus [[WKRC-TV]] and two other nearby CBS affiliates \u2013 [[WHIO-TV]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]] and [[WKYT-TV]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] \u2013 could not carry it).\n* If the blacked-out nationally televised game is being shown on a cable network (such as [[ESPN]] or the [[NFL Network]]), all cable and satellite television providers in markets that are within the 75-mile radius, in addition already to the primary market of the home team (which is already blacked out), must black out the cable broadcaster's feed to customers in affected markets during the game (this is a condition of the channels' agreements with both the league and the providers). In addition, the game is not simulcast on a local broadcast station in the blacked-out markets. Local stations would still be able to show highlights during their newscasts after the game has concluded. In areas where the game is blacked out, ESPN and the NFL Network would generally offer alternate programming (ESPN traditionally switches to a simulcast of [[ESPNews]]). As ESPN and NFL Network games featuring the local teams are syndicated in the local markets under the NFL's anti-siphoning policies, the station that holds local rights to the cable broadcasts but cannot show the games originally scheduled to be carried would either run their own alternate programming or, if affiliated with a major network, show the regularly scheduled network programming for that night. During the pre-season, blacked out games can be aired in their entirety, but only on [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] (generally after late-evening newscasts).\n* If the blacked-out home game is played on a Sunday afternoon, all local stations inside the 75-mile radius must show a different NFL game during that time slot \u2013 the network typically chooses the game (typically a #1 game for that slot). In addition, NFL Sunday Ticket cannot telecast the game within that area. As already stated, the network scheduled to run a doubleheader can broadcast only one game into that team's primary market (usually the #1&nbsp;game), which is designed to prevent viewers from opting to watch the other televised NFL games instead of attending that involving their local team. Again, the secondary markets would still carry a doubleheader. In some cases, the network-affiliated stations will switch time slots so that the network running the doubleheader can still show its featured 4:25&nbsp;p.m. (Eastern Time) game.\n* The NFL Mobile app for mobile devices periodically checks the user's location in order to enforce blackouts, and will not show a blacked-out game if the device is being used in the game's home market. Transmissions are also blacked out if the mobile device utilizes cell towers or wifi signals within or near the home stadium.\n\nIn 2005, for the first time in its history, the NFL lifted the blackout policies for a team: the [[New Orleans Saints]]. [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Saints|Due to damage]] caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]], the Saints split their home games between [[Giants Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]], [[Tiger Stadium (Baton Rouge)|Tiger Stadium]] at [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], and the [[Alamodome]] in [[San Antonio]], with most home games being played in Baton Rouge. Baton Rouge is a secondary market for the Saints and is subject to blackouts when games held at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Superdome]] carried by over-the-air networks do not sell out, since CBS affiliate [[WAFB]] and Fox affiliate [[WGMB]] reach within 75&nbsp;miles of the Superdome, even though the city limits of Baton Rouge are more than 75&nbsp;miles from the stadium (the Baton Rouge DMA is not subjected to a blackout when Saints games televised by ESPN or the NFL Network do not sell out).\n\nSan Antonio is an unofficial secondary market for the [[Dallas Cowboys]] (in that the Cowboys games are routinely televised in that area, but the area is not within the 75&nbsp;mile blackout radius), and two of three Saints games in 2005 played at the Alamodome were not broadcast anywhere in [[Texas]], as the start times for the Cowboys and Saints games conflicted on those dates. The only game of the San Antonio dates not to sell out, in Week 4 against Buffalo, was televised locally by CBS (on [[KENS-TV]]) as the Cowboys had a late game that day against the [[Oakland Raiders]] at [[McAfee Coliseum]] (Fox affiliate [[KABB]], therefore, never broadcast a Saints home game in the San Antonio market, as the Cowboys and Saints are in the [[National Football Conference]], and the Cowboys have a larger following in Texas).<ref>{{cite press release|title=No blackout for Saints games in Baton Rouge|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/story/NO/9005538|website=NFL.com|date=October 26, 2005|accessdate=July 11, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714095700/http://www.nfl.com/teams/story/NO/9005538|archivedate=July 14, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe blackout policies extend even to the [[Pro Bowl]]; if that game is not sold out, it is not televised in the home media market. From 1980 to 2009, and again from 2011 to 2014, the game was played in [[Halawa]], making the applicable market the entire state of [[Hawaii]].<ref name=\"probowlblackout\"/> The 2010&nbsp;game was played in the [[Miami]] area (at [[Sun Life Stadium]]).\n\nDue to decreasing ticket sales, the league significantly softened its blackout policy in 2009. Though the traditional rules still apply, the league is using some of its new media features to provide access to untelecasted games. For instance, the league will not subject its \"[[NFL Network#NFL Red Zone Channel|RedZone]]\" channel to any blackouts. In addition, complete live games will be made available for free online on the Monday (except ''Monday Night Football''), Tuesday and Wednesday following the game, if the game is blacked out, using the league's ''Game Rewind'' package.<ref>{{cite press release|title=NFL.com to show blacked-out games free in local markets on delayed basis|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8127eb87/article/nflcom-to-show-blackedout-games-free-in-local-markets-on-delayed-basis|website=NFL.com|date=September 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nCritics claim that these blackout policies are largely ineffective in creating sold out, filled stadiums. They contend that there are other factors that prevent sellouts, such as high ticket prices and low enthusiasm for a losing team. Furthermore, it has been argued that blackouts hurt the league; without the television exposure, it becomes more difficult for those teams with low attendance and few sellouts to increase their popularity and following as the exposure decreases.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ralph Nader's op-ed opposing the NFL's blackout rule|url=http://www.leagueoffans.org/blackoutoped.html|author=Ralph Nader|website=LeagueOfFans.org (republished)|publisher=[[Democrat and Chronicle]]|page=5A|date=August 17, 1998|accessdate=July 11, 2007}}</ref>\n\nConversely, the NFL has sold out well over 90% of games in recent seasons. Additionally, many teams sell out their entire regular season schedule before it begins (usually through season-ticket sales; at least half of all NFL teams have a [[NFL season ticket waiting lists|season-ticket waiting list]]), and so there is no threat of a blackout in those markets.\n\n==Market and year of last blackout/non-sellout==\n* [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] (1968; before 1973 rules)\n* Denver (1969; in AFL, before 1973 rules)\n* [[Pittsburgh]] (1972; before 1973 rules)\n* [[New York Metropolitan Area|New York City\u2013North Jersey]] (1977)<sup>1</sup>\n* [[San Francisco]] (1981)\n* Green Bay (1983)\n* [[Chicago]] (1984)\n* [[Dallas]] (1990)\n* [[New England]] (1993)\n* [[Greater Los Angeles area|Los Angeles\u2013Anaheim]] (1994)\n* [[Cleveland]] (1995)<sup>3</sup>\n* [[Houston]] (1996)<sup>2</sup>\n* [[Baltimore]] (1997)<ref>{{cite news|title=Domination on ground lifts Ravens RAVENS 23, BENGALS 10|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-09-08/sports/1997251111_1_ravens-baltimore-fans-bengals|author=Vito Stellino|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=September 8, 1997|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}</ref> \n* [[Minnesota]] (1997)\n* [[Miami]] (1998)\n* [[Nashville]] (1998)\n* [[Philadelphia]] (1999)\n* [[Carolinas|Carolina]] (2002)\n* [[Seattle]] (2003)\n* [[Indianapolis]] (2003)\n* [[New Orleans]] (2004)\n* [[Arizona]] (2005)\n* [[Atlanta]] (2007)\n* [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] (2009)\n* [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] (2009)\n* [[Detroit]] (2010)\n* Cincinnati (2012)\n* [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa Bay]] (2012)\n* [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] (2012)\n* [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] (2013)\n\nNotes:\n* <sup>1</sup> The last blackout for the [[New York Giants]] was in 1975, and the Jets in 1977; in both seasons, the teams played in New York City's [[Shea Stadium]]. In the Giants' case, Shea was a temporary home, since [[Giants Stadium]] was still under construction. Both have sold out all of their games since relocating to North New Jersey in 1976 and 1984, respectively.\n* <sup>2</sup> The last blackout in Houston was when the Oilers resided there in their last season in the city in 1996. The Texans have always sold out in the city since their inception.\n* <sup>3</sup> The last two games of the 1995 season failed to sell out after the team's ownership [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|announced the team's move to Baltimore]].\n\n==Secondary markets==\nThe league also designates \"secondary markets\", usually adjoining primary markets (generally areas within 75&nbsp;miles of a stadium, but not having their own team) that are also required to show the local NFL franchise. Generally, these secondary markets must show the away games but are not obligated to telecast the designated team's sold out home games.\n\nTheir decision on whether to show home games typically depends on whether the NFL-designated local team is perceived to be the most popular in the market. For example, [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] is a secondary market to the [[Baltimore Ravens]]; therefore the Harrisburg market's CBS affiliate, [[WHP-TV]], must show all Ravens away games. However, since there are many [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] fans in the region, when the Ravens are home at the same time the Steelers are playing, that station shows the latter game. Harrisburg is thus considered a battleground territory for the [[Steelers\u2013Ravens rivalry]].\n\nThe same applies for the [[Orlando, Florida]] metropolitan area, as its local CBS affiliate [[WKMG-TV]] broadcasts both [[Miami Dolphins]] and Jacksonville Jaguars games. In some cases, the NFL has the two teams play at different times to accommodate the entire state of [[Florida]] (but only when CBS has the doubleheader, or if one of the teams is on Fox). WKMG lobbied to carry a Dolphins game against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in 2005, but the NFL refused this request \u2013 as Orlando is officially a Jaguars secondary market (despite downtown Orlando being 141 miles from the Jaguars' home stadium, [[TIAA Bank Field]], compared to 88 miles from the Buccaneers' home, [[Raymond James Stadium]]) the station had to carry the Jaguars game at Pittsburgh. This issue again came up in 2013, during Week 2, when CBS' late game window featured two games: the Denver Broncos at the [[New York Giants]] (which was a much-hyped matchup between brothers [[Peyton Manning|Peyton]] and [[Eli Manning]]) and the Jaguars at the [[Oakland Raiders]] (a matchup of two teams that were not expected to contend for the playoffs). Again, since Orlando is a secondary market of the Jaguars, WKMG was required to carry the latter game; the station notoriously apologized for having to show the Jaguars game.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/15/jaguars-apology-orlando-tv-station_n_3932351.html TV Station Forced To Broadcast Jaguars: WKMG-TV Apologies For \u2018Inconvenience\u2019 Of Bad Team {{!}} Huffington Post]</ref><ref>[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-09-17/sports/os-mike-bianchi-jaguars-orlando-tv-0918-20130917_1_jacksonville-jaguars-eli-manning-manning-bowl If Jags want Orlando to watch them on TV, play games here instead of London {{!}} Orlando Sentinel]</ref><ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/orlando-tv-station-apologizes-for-airing-jaguars-2013-9 Orlando TV Station Airs Public Apology For Having To Broadcast Jacksonville Jaguars Games {{!}} Business Insider]</ref> There have been exceptions, however; in the last week of the [[2016 NFL season|2016 season]], the Jaguars played their regular season finale on the road at the [[Indianapolis Colts]], while the Dolphins played their regular season finale against the [[New England Patriots]] at home. Since the Jaguars were on the road, this should have meant WKMG would be required to carry the Jaguars-Colts game. However, the Jaguars granted a one-time waiver of the secondary markets rule requirement for the Orlando market, thus allowing WKMG to air the Patriots-Dolphins game; this is most likely because the Dolphins had clinched a playoff spot the previous week and the Patriots were going for home-field advantage in the AFC, while both the Jaguars and Colts had both been eliminated from playoff contention.\n\n===Two-team secondary markets===\nThere are rare instances where a market will have two teams claiming their territory. For instance, [[Youngstown, Ohio]] lies roughly halfway between Cleveland and Pittsburgh, is within the 75-mile radius for both cities and is considered a battleground territory in the [[Browns\u2013Steelers rivalry]]. Therefore, local CBS affiliate [[WKBN-TV]] must show whichever team is playing an away game. If one game is on CBS while the other is on Fox, both games will air (WKBN's parent company also owns [[Low-power broadcasting|low-powered]] Fox affiliate [[WYFX-LD]], which is simulcast on WKBN's second [[digital subchannel]]).\n\nIf both the Cleveland Browns and the Pittsburgh Steelers are scheduled to play at the same time on CBS or Fox and the location of the game does not matter, WKBN/WYFX will usually air the Browns game. However, on December 2, 2012, when the Browns played at the Raiders and the Steelers played at the Ravens in the late window of a CBS doubleheader, WKBN aired the Steelers game as the former was between two teams that were out of playoff contention, while the latter was between two teams that were in playoff contention (as well as the [[AFC North]] title), and was also the main game of the late CBS window. The fan base is evenly split between those two teams, with the [[San Francisco 49ers]] also having a small following due to team owners [[John York|John]] and [[Denise DeBartolo York]] being based out of the Youngstown suburb of [[Canfield, Ohio]].\n\nSimilar issues concerning the same market teams occurred with CBS affiliate [[WTRF]] in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], which formerly carried Fox programming on its 7.2 subchannel ([[WTRF-DT2|Fox Ohio Valley]]) until 2014, when [[WTOV-TV]] took over the affiliation on one of its subchannels. At times, WTRF would run a game broadcast by Fox on the subchannel opposite a Browns or Steelers home game that aired on the main CBS feed regardless, and vice versa.\n\n===\"Unofficial\" and \"temporary\" secondary markets===\nMany markets serve as \"unofficial\" secondary markets for the league's various teams due to rooting interest in those markets. As they are not designated by the NFL as official secondary markets, they technically are not required to air any games, but will do so to please the fanbases.\n\nFor example, in Texas, virtually all CBS and Fox stations respectively carry the [[Houston Texans]] and Dallas Cowboys when games involving those teams are on different networks. However until 2010, CBS [[owned-and-operated station]] [[KTVT]] in Dallas rarely aired Texans games unless it had no other option; but for the [[2011 NFL season|2011 season]], it carried most Texans games, except for a handful of conflicts. Fox owned-and-operated station [[KRIV (TV)|KRIV]] in Houston always airs Cowboys games if it is not prohibited from doing so by NFL rules. In another example, [[Seattle Seahawks]] games are usually aired on Fox (and occasionally CBS) stations across the entire [[Pacific Northwest]] as the team is the only NFL franchise in the area.\n\nThe [[New England Patriots]], especially since [[Tom Brady]] became quarterback, also have almost all of New England as unofficial secondary markets ([[Providence, Rhode Island]] is an official secondary market). Not only do all or almost all CBS or Fox (depending on the game carrier) affiliates in New England carry Patriots games, but the team's syndicated preseason broadcasts cover the entire region. [[Hartford, Connecticut]] is within proximity to New York, and stations in that market have sometimes aired a [[New York Jets]] game instead; however, this rarely occurs.\n\nThe New York Giants have most of the markets in [[upstate New York]] (with the exception of [[Western New York]], which belongs to the Buffalo Bills) as unofficial secondary markets. [[Albany, New York|Albany]] is considered an official secondary market of the Giants. In addition, [[Burlington, Vermont]] (whose Fox affiliate, [[WFFF-TV]], has a coverage area that includes [[Plattsburgh, New York|Plattsburgh]] in the eastern corner of New York) has become an unofficial market for the Giants, preventing the Patriots from having full control over all New England markets (the Patriots, as an [[American Football Conference]] team, still receive copious coverage on the local CBS affiliate, [[WCAX-TV]]). An example of this occurred on September 27, 2009, when the [[2009 New York Giants season|Giants]] hosted the [[2009 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and the [[2009 New England Patriots season|Patriots]] hosted the [[2009 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], both at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time. WFFF-TV, which covers most of the state of [[Vermont]] and also extreme northern New York, broadcast the Giants game, as it is used to airing the team's games as a Fox affiliate. More recently, however, WFFF-TV has aired Patriots games over those involving the Giants when the former is featured on the network. Boston affiliate [[WFXT]] generally (but not always) carries Fox's Sunday-afternoon Giants games other than those that cannot be carried on the station because the New England Patriots are playing a home game at the same time. Providence affiliate [[WNAC-TV]] carries Fox's Giants' games unless the network is broadcasting a Patriots' home game at the same time the Giants are playing. \n\nSpecifically due to the issues with requirements for [[Hartford, Connecticut]] CBS affiliate [[WFSB]] to carry mainly [[New York Jets]] games as a secondary market most weeks (and to a much lesser extent, the [[Buffalo Bills]]), [[Meredith Corporation]] established a new CBS affiliate in the [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] market in 2003, [[WSHM-LD]], in order to allow that market to become a Patriots secondary market; previously, Meredith's WFSB served as the default CBS affiliate for the Springfield market, which otherwise contains only two other full-power commercial stations. This became a liability as the [[Tom Brady and Bill Belichick era|Patriots dynasty]] began, as viewers north of the Connecticut/Massachusetts line could not watch their home state's team most weeks. Four years later, ABC affiliate [[WGGB-TV]] established their own Fox DT2 subchannel, taking over from Hartford's [[WTIC-TV]] as Springfield's default Fox affiliate and allowing that market access to the remainder of Patriots Sunday home games with an NFC opponent (WGGB-DT2 otherwise carries mainly Giants home games like the remainder of New England's other stations). Over time however with the sustained success of the Patriots, WFSB has mainly moved towards carrying their games, with the Jets losing games on that station as time has gone on.\n\nSince 1995, the [[San Francisco 49ers]] have had most of [[California]] from the Oregon-California border south to Los Angeles as an unofficial secondary market, although the Los Angeles area was a secondary market for the [[San Diego Chargers]] until the Rams' return to Los Angeles in 2016 ([[Sacramento]] is an official secondary market to both the 49ers and the Raiders).\n\nAn oddity of \"temporary\" secondary markets have occurred in [[Wisconsin]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[South Carolina]] as a result of a rooting interest in one particular player. After the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]], quarterback [[Brett Favre]] departed the Green Bay Packers for the New York Jets. As a result, CBS affiliates [[WFRV]] in Green Bay (which was formerly owned by CBS) and [[WDJT-TV]] in Milwaukee were able to ask for as many Jets games as CBS and the NFL could offer to their viewers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Favre lands Jets on CBS |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=781043 |newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]] |publisher=[[Journal Media Group|Journal Communications]] |date=August 8, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816164539/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=781043 |archivedate=August 16, 2008 }}</ref> In 2009, when Favre moved to an NFC North division rival, the Minnesota Vikings, Fox affiliates [[WLUK-TV]] in Green Bay and [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] in Milwaukee requested as many Vikings games on their stations as possible. This also occurred in 2011 in Seattle, where the market was able to broadcast Tennessee Titans games because former Seahawks quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] was a Titans starter, and local native and former [[University of Washington]] quarterback [[Jake Locker]] was drafted in the first round of the [[2011 NFL Draft]] by the Titans. Given these two fan favorites, local CBS affiliate [[KIRO-TV]] requested to air as many of these games as possible.<ref>{{cite news|title=Local stations to carry 8 Vikings games|url=http://archive.greenbaypressgazette.com/article/20090821/GPG0101/908210553/Local-stations-carry-8-Vikings-games|author=Warren Gerds|newspaper=[[Green Bay Press-Gazette]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=August 21, 2009|accessdate=April 23, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20150423195847/http://archive.greenbaypressgazette.com/article/20090821/GPG0101/908210553/Local-stations-carry-8-Vikings-games|archivedate=April 23, 2015}}</ref> In 2014, CBS affiliate [[WLTX]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]] requested to change game assignments for Week 17 from the [[2014 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]]&ndash;[[2014 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] game to the [[2014 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]]&ndash;[[2014 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] game; WLTX requested the change when the Browns had undrafted rookie quarterback [[Connor Shaw]], a fan favorite from the [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|University of South Carolina]], start the game.<ref>{{cite news|title=WLTX NFL Sunday: Browns, Ravens and Panthers, Falcons|url=http://www.wltx.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/12/23/wltx-nfl-sunday-browns-ravens-and-panthers-falcons/20827779/|author=Derry London|website=[[WLTX]]|publisher=Gannett Company|date=December 23, 2014|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] is not an official secondary market for any team, but all Chiefs games are televised in the market. Stations [[KWCH]] and [[KSAS-TV|KSAS]] almost always show the Cowboys and/or Broncos when they do not conflict with the Chiefs. \n\nIn 2018, stations in [[Oklahoma City]] and [[Tulsa]] started requesting as many [[Cleveland Browns]] games as possible when 2017 [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Baker Mayfield]], who starred for the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|University of Oklahoma]], became the team's starting quarterback. The networks complied, except in cases when the Browns and [[Dallas Cowboys]] were playing at the same time on the same network; the Cowboys have enjoyed a large base of support in neighboring Oklahoma since their founding in 1960. Previously, the [[Minnesota Vikings]] were requested as much as possible by Oklahoma stations due to the presence of former OU star running back [[Adrian Peterson]]. \n\nSince 2015, when 2014 Heisman winner [[Marcus Mariota]] from the [[Oregon Ducks football|University of Oregon]] was drafted by the Titans, stations in Oregon have carried most Tennessee games when they do not conflict with broadcasts of the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. Other instances of markets carrying contests featuring alumnus of the local college include [[Philadelphia Eagles]] games in [[Fargo, North Dakota]] (former [[North Dakota State Bison football|North Dakota State]] player [[Carson Wentz]] is currently the Eagles' starting quarterback), the Chiefs in [[Lubbock, Texas]], where [[Patrick Mahomes]] attended [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]]. and the Ravens in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where [[Lamar Jackson]] attended [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]].\n\n===Other information===\nIn all other markets, the networks are the sole arbiters of the telecast matches. However, they usually make their decisions after consulting with all of their local affiliates. On rarer occasions, some affiliates are offered a choice of a few games for a given time slot, if there is no game that stands out as appropriate. In those cases, some stations have allowed the viewers to vote online for their preferred game. In the early 1990s, [[New Orleans]] NBC affiliate [[WDSU]] conducted a poll via telephone during several weeks to select which game would be broadcast{{Citation needed|reason=source needed to confirm WDSU poll|date=April 2019}}\n\nFor example, during Week 3 of the [[2010 NFL season|2010 season]], Fox affiliate [[KMSS-TV]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] conducted an online viewer poll in which fans could choose between the [[2010 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]]&ndash;[[2010 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]] game and the [[2010 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]]&ndash;[[2010 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] game. The station is situated in the [[Ark-La-Tex]] region, where both the Saints and Cowboys have significant fan bases, due to the Shreveport market being situated on the northern border between [[Louisiana]] and Texas, including [[Texarkana, Texas|Texarkana]], and the southwest corner of Arkansas. The poll concluded with viewers choosing the Falcons-Saints game, even though Shreveport is closer to Dallas than New Orleans.<ref>{{cite web|title=KTAL NBC 6 \u2013 ArkLaTex homepage.com|url=http://www.kmsstv.com/saints-cowboys-poll|website=[[KTAL-TV]]/[[KMSS-TV]]/[[KSHV-TV]]|publisher=[[Nexstar Media Group]]|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}</ref>.

Although KCBS had the single game and was contractually obligated to carry the San Diego Chargers game at the Cleveland Browns in the early 10 a.m. PT slot since Los Angeles is an official secondary market of the Chargers, the Colts\u2013Raiders game had playoff implications as well as Los Angeles having a large Raiders fan base due to the fact that [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|the team played in Los Angeles from 1982 to 1994]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidesocal.com/tomhoffarth/2016/12/21/nfl-week-16-in-the-l-a-tv-market-cleveland-doesnt-want-browns-on-tv-well-get-em/|title=NFL Week 16 in the L.A.

The Packers defeated the Steelers by the score of 31\u201325. The game was played on February 6, 2011 at [[AT&T Stadium|Cowboys Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas]], the first time the [[Super Bowl]] was played in the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas\u2013Fort Worth]] area.\n\nUnlike most other Super Bowls, this game featured two title-abundant franchises: coming into the game, the Packers held the most NFL championships with 12 (9 league championships prior to the Super Bowl era and 3 Super Bowl championships), while the Steelers held the most Super Bowl championships with 6. The Packers entered their fifth Super Bowl in team history, and became the first 6-seed team in the NFC to compete in the Super Bowl, after posting a 10\u20136 regular season record. The Steelers finished the regular season with a 12\u20134 record, and advanced to a league-tying 8th Super Bowl appearance.\n\nGreen Bay dominated most of the first half of Super Bowl XLV, jumping to a 21\u20133 lead before Pittsburgh cut it down to 21\u201310 just before halftime. Then after the teams exchanged touchdowns, the Steelers made the score 28\u201325 midway through the fourth quarter with wide receiver [[Mike Wallace (American football)|Mike Wallace]]'s 25-yard touchdown reception from quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] and a [[two-point conversion]]. But the Packers answered with [[Mason Crosby]]'s 23-yard field goal with 2:07 remaining, and then prevented the Steelers from scoring on their final drive of the game. Packers quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] was named [[Super Bowl MVP]], completing 24 of 39 passes for 304 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nThe broadcast of Super Bowl XLV on [[Fox NFL|Fox]] averaged about 111 million viewers, breaking the record for the [[List of most watched television broadcasts in the United States|most-watched program]] in American television history.<ref name=\"seidman1987\"/> The game's attendance was 103,219, just short of the Super Bowl record 103,985 set in [[Super Bowl XIV]] at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California]].

They earned the [[AFC North]] division title, and the second seed in the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] and advanced to their 8th Super Bowl, tying the [[Dallas Cowboys]]' record of most Super Bowl appearances.\n\nAfter missing the first four games of the year on suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy (during which the Steelers went 3\u20131), quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] returned for his seventh season as the Steelers starting quarterback,  finishing the season with 3,200&nbsp;yards and 17 touchdowns, with just five interceptions, for a 97 passer rating.  He also rushed for 176 yards and two touchdowns.  The team's top receiver was [[Mike Wallace (American football)|Mike Wallace]] who caught 60 passes for 1,257&nbsp;yards and 10 touchdowns, giving him a 21&nbsp;yards per catch average.  Other reliable options included 13-year veteran [[Hines Ward]] (59 receptions for 755&nbsp;yards and 5 touchdowns), the Steelers all-time leading receiver, and tight end [[Heath Miller]] who caught 42 passes for 512&nbsp;yards.  Halfback [[Rashard Mendenhall]] was the team's leading rusher, gaining 1,273&nbsp;yards and 13 touchdowns while also catching 23 passes.  The line was led by rookie center [[Maurkice Pouncey]], the Steelers only pro bowl selection on offense.  However, Pouncey was injured in the AFC championship game and would be inactive for Super Bowl XLV.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.steelers.com/news/article-1/Pouncey-on-IR/a13e299e-dc4d-4977-9be4-a038c5e3238e |title=Pouncey on IR |website=Pittsburgh Steelers |access-date=December 15, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216034903/http://www.steelers.com/news/article-1/Pouncey-on-IR/a13e299e-dc4d-4977-9be4-a038c5e3238e |archive-date=December 16, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Steelers had one of the league's top defenses, leading the NFL in sacks (48), and fewest points (14.5) and rushing yards (62.8) allowed per game, while ranking second in fewest total yards (276.8).  The line was anchored by pro bowl end [[Brett Keisel]].  The Steelers also had four excellent linebackers:  [[LaMarr Woodley]], [[James Harrison (American football)|James Harrison]], [[James Farrior]], and [[Lawrence Timmons]].  For the third consecutive year, Woodley and Harrison each recorded at least 10 sacks.  Woodley also forced three fumbles and Harrison forced six.  Farrior had 109 total tackles and six sacks.  Timmons led the team with 135 total tackles, while also recording three sacks and two interceptions.  The secondary was led by pro bowl safety [[Troy Polamalu]], who won the [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award]], tying his career-best seven interceptions and returning them for 101&nbsp;yards and a touchdown.\n\nCoach [[Mike Tomlin]], already the youngest coach to ever win a Super Bowl, became the youngest coach ever to make it to the Super Bowl twice at age 38. The Pittsburgh Steelers had also accomplished going to the Super Bowl in five different decades; and, in every decade since the post AFL-NFL merger. 1970s: 1975, 1976, and 1979. 1980s: 1980. 1990s: 1996. 2000s: 2006 and 2009. 2010s: 2011.\n\n====Green Bay Packers====\n{{main|2010 Green Bay Packers season}}\nThe Green Bay Packers finished the season with a 10\u20136 record and became the first number 6-seeded team in the NFC to compete in the Super Bowl. They are only the second number 6 seeded team to reach the Super Bowl, with the only other number 6 seed to accomplish this feat being the [[2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], who won [[Super Bowl XL]] following the 2005 season. Green Bay also joined the 2005 Steelers as the only teams ever to defeat the top three seeded teams on the road in the playoffs. In order to secure their fifth Super Bowl bid they defeated their longtime rivals, the [[Chicago Bears]], in the [[NFC Championship Game]] at [[Soldier Field]].\n\nThe offense was led by quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]], who was in his third year as a starter after taking over for the team's all-time leading passer [[Brett Favre]].  Rodgers finished the season completing 65.7% of his passes for 3,922&nbsp;yards and 28 touchdowns, with only eleven interceptions, giving him his second consecutive season with a triple digit passer rating (101.2).  He was also a good rusher, adding 356&nbsp;yards and 4 touchdowns on the ground.  His top target was pro bowl receiver [[Greg Jennings]], who caught 76 passes for 1,265&nbsp;yards and 12 touchdowns, giving him a 16.6&nbsp;yards per catch average while also ranking him fourth in the NFL in yards and second in touchdown catches. Other reliable targets included receivers [[James Jones (wide receiver)|James Jones]] (50 receptions, 676&nbsp;yards, 5 touchdowns), [[Donald Driver]] (51 receptions, 565 yards, 4 touchdowns), and [[Jordy Nelson]] (45 receptions, 582&nbsp;yards, 496 kick return yards). The Packers lost star tight end [[Jermichael Finley]]  (21 receptions 301&nbsp;yards, 1 touchdown) to injury in week five who was their leading receiver at the time. The Packers ground game was crippled by injuries, especially the Week 1 loss of [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]], who had rushed for over 1,200 yards in each of the last two seasons. In his absence, the team relied prominently on [[Brandon Jackson (American football)|Brandon Jackson]], who rushed for 703&nbsp;yards and caught 43 passes for 342, and fullback [[John Kuhn]], who added 281&nbsp;yards on the ground. The team's offensive line was anchored by pro bowl tackle [[Chad Clifton]], an 11-year veteran.\n\nThe Packers defense ranked second in the league in fewest points allowed per game (15).  The line was led by [[Cullen Jenkins]], who recorded seven sacks in just eleven games, and 338-pound defensive tackle [[B. J. Raji]], who had 6.5.  The linebackers were led by pro bowler [[Clay Matthews III|Clay Matthews]] and [[A. J. Hawk]].  Matthews ranked fourth in the NFL with 13.5 sacks, while Hawk led the team in combined tackles (111) and intercepted three passes.  Three of the Packers starters in the secondary had made the pro bowl. [[Tramon Williams]] led the team with a career-high 6 interceptions, while adding 326 punt return yards.  Other pro bowl selections included safety [[Nick Collins]] (4 interceptions and 70 combined tackles) and hard hitting 13-year veteran cornerback [[Charles Woodson]], who recorded 92 total tackles and forced five fumbles, while also intercepting two passes.\n\nThe Packers entered the Super Bowl never having trailed by more than 7&nbsp;points at any point during the season\u2014a feat that had never been accomplished during a complete season in the Super Bowl era. The last team to complete a season with this distinction was the [[Detroit Lions]] in [[1962 Detroit Lions season|1962]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/?p=8534 |title=Super Bowl notes: Stat of the Year and Updated SRS Standings |first=Chase |last=Stuart |work=Pro Football Reference Blog |publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com |date=January 26, 2011 |accessdate=February 6, 2011}}</ref>  In the Super Bowl game itself, the Packers never trailed.\n\nOf note, this was Green Bay's first Super Bowl against an AFC team that was not one of the \"Original 8\" [[American Football League]] franchises. The Packers had played Kansas City, Oakland, New England, and Denver in their four previous Super Bowl match-ups, winning against all but Denver. The Steelers, like the Packers, predated the AFL's launch, having begun play in 1933 (12 years after the Packers joined the NFL after two years as an independent team), and moved to the AFC in [[1970 NFL season|1970]] as a result of the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]] to even out the two conferences.\n\n===Playoffs===\n{{main|2010\u201311 NFL playoffs}}\n\nPittsburgh advanced to the Super Bowl with two close wins in the playoffs.  After a first-round bye, the Steelers defeated their division rival, the number 5 seeded [[2010 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] 31\u201324, with [[Ben Roethlisberger]]'s 58-yard completion to [[Antonio Brown]] on third down and 19 setting up [[Rashard Mendenhall]]'s game winning 2-yard touchdown run with 1:33 left in the game.  Roethlisberger finished with 226 passing yards and two touchdowns, while the defense forced three turnovers and sacked Baltimore QB [[Joe Flacco]] five times, three by [[James Harrison (American football)|James Harrison]].\n\nThen the Steelers defeated the number 6 seeded [[2010 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] 24\u201319 in the [[AFC Championship Game]]. Pittsburgh seemed to be in complete control at first, taking a 24\u20130 lead in the first half. Jets quarterback [[Mark Sanchez]] rallied his team back, cutting the score to 24\u201310 going into the fourth quarter.  The Jets then drove to the Steelers 2-yard line on a 17-play drive, but the Pittsburgh defense made a key stand, keeping them out of the end zone on four consecutive plays near the goal-line to force a turnover.  New York subsequently forced a safety and scored a touchdown with just over three minutes left, but Roethlisberger's 14-yard completions to Brown and [[Heath Miller]] allowed Pittsburgh to hang onto the ball until time expired.  Mendenhall finished with 121 rushing yards and a touchdown, along with 2 catches for 32&nbsp;yards.\n\nGreen Bay started off their postseason with a 21\u201316 win over the number 3 seeded [[2010 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] after [[Tramon Williams]] intercepted a pass from [[Michael Vick]] in the end zone with less than a minute left to play.  [[Aaron Rodgers]] threw for 180&nbsp;yards and three touchdowns while [[James Starks]], who only rushed for 101&nbsp;yards during the season, rushed for 123&nbsp;yards in the game.\n\nThe Packers then went to Georgia, where the top-seeded 13\u20133 [[2010 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] were waiting.  Although the Falcons took advantage of an early turnover and a kick return touchdown to build a 14\u20137 lead, Green Bay quickly buried the Falcons with 35 straight points.  By the end of the first half, the Packers held a 28\u201314 lead, and went on to win comfortably, 48\u201321.  Rodgers was nearly perfect, completing 31 of 36 passes for 366 yards and three touchdowns, while adding another score on the ground.  [[Jordy Nelson]] and [[James Jones (wide receiver)|James Jones]] both had touchdown catches, while [[John Kuhn]] added scores by air and ground and Tramon Williams returned one of his two interceptions 70&nbsp;yards for a touchdown.  Green Bay's special teams unit never had to punt the ball, while [[Mason Crosby]] contributed two field goals.\n\nGreen Bay next faced the number 2 [[2010 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] in the [[NFC Championship Game]], defeating them 21\u201314.  This time Rodgers had a rougher day than his previous two games, throwing no touchdown passes and being intercepted twice.  But he still threw for 244 yards and scored a 1-yard touchdown run, while Starks added 74 rushing yards, including a touchdown run in the second quarter.  Meanwhile, Green Bay's defense knocked Chicago quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] out of the game and intercepted three passes, one of which was returned 18&nbsp;yards for a touchdown by [[B. J. Raji]].  The other two were made by rookie [[Sam Shields]], who recorded his second interception near his own end zone with 37 seconds left to put the game away.\n\n===Super Bowl pregame notes===\n[[File:American Sign Language Interpreter.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An [[American Sign Language]] interpreter in the [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]] jersey appearing at a rally for the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] prior to Super Bowl XLV.]]\nBoth teams are known to have sizable fanbases that often travel to away games, largely due to the home games themselves having decades-long waiting lists.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=dw-packersvssteelers012311|title=Blue-blooded Pack, Steelers in dream matchup}}</ref> In August 2008, [[ESPN.com]] ranked the two teams tied as having the best fans in the NFL.<ref>{{cite news |first= Matt|last= Mosley|title= NFL's best fans?

Then on the first play after the ensuing kickoff, quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] was hit by [[Howard Green]] as he threw a pass, causing the ball to go well short of his intended target near the left sideline where it was intercepted by [[Nick Collins]] and returned 37&nbsp;yards for a touchdown, giving Green Bay a 14\u20130 lead. This score continued the unbeaten streak of Super Bowl victories recorded by teams scoring on an interception run-back, improving to 11\u20130 in such games. It was also the third consecutive Super Bowl with an interception return for a touchdown, as well as the eighth such score in the last ten Super Bowls.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-02-06-nfl-super-bowl-xlv-green-bay-packers-pittsburgh-steelers_N.htm|title=Rodgers, Packers top Steelers 31\u201325 to win Super Bowl XLV|date=February 6, 2011|work=USA Today|accessdate=February 7, 2011|first=Jarrett|last=Bell}}</ref>  The Packers also tied the [[1973 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins']] record which still stands for the largest Super Bowl lead (14 points) at the end of the first quarter, set in [[Super Bowl VIII]] against the [[1973 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] and later tied by the [[1980 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] against the [[1980 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] in [[Super Bowl XV]].\n\nThis time Pittsburgh managed to respond, driving 49&nbsp;yards in 13 plays including Roethlisberger's 18-yard run on 3rd down and 9. [[Shaun Suisham]] finished the drive with a 33-yard field goal to cut the score to 14\u20133. Then after forcing a punt, the Steelers drove to midfield, but turned the ball over again when Roethlisberger's pass was intercepted by defensive back [[Jarrett Bush]] at the 47. After the interception, Rodgers led the Packers to another score, completing two passes for 20&nbsp;yards before [[James Starks]]'s 12-yard run moved the ball to the 21-yard line. On the next play, Green Bay increased their lead to 21\u20133 with Rodgers' 21-yard touchdown pass to [[Greg Jennings]]. Taking the ball back with 2:24 left in the second quarter, Roethlisberger made a 37-yard completion to [[Antwaan Randle El]] on their first play. After that, receiver [[Hines Ward]] caught three passes for 39&nbsp;yards on the drive, the last one an 8-yard touchdown catch with 37 seconds left in the half, making the score 21\u201310 at halftime.  This was the fourth time in their four 2011 postseason games that the Packers finished the first half with a lead of at least 11 points. The first half had taken a heavy toll on both teams. The Steelers lost wide receiver [[Emmanuel Sanders]] to injury, while the Packers lost receiver [[Donald Driver]] along with defensive backs [[Charles Woodson]] and [[Sam Shields]]. Shields would be the only player among them who would return.  The Black Eyed Peas played at halftime.\n\n===Second half===\n[[File:Field goal attempt (6841820199).jpg|thumb|Steelers Field Goal Kick]]\nPittsburgh's defense forced Green Bay to punt on the first drive of the second half, and got the ball at midfield after a face-mask call on [[Tom Crabtree]] while tackling [[Antonio Brown]] on the punt return. The offense then scored in five plays (all runs). First, [[Rashard Mendenhall]] broke free along with right sideline for a 17-yard run, then [[Isaac Redman]] rushed for 3&nbsp;yards, and Roethlisberger ran for 6, bringing up third down and 1. On the next play, Redman tried to run up the middle, but was held up at the line, so he backed away and ran to the outside for a 16-yard gain to the 8-yard line. Then Mendenhall scored an 8-yard touchdown run on the next play, making the score 21\u201317.  After forcing a punt, Pittsburgh mounted a drive to the Packers 29-yard line, but Green Bay's defense made a stand. First Roethlisberger's pass was batted down behind the line by linebacker [[Clay Matthews III|Clay Matthews]], then Roethlisberger tried a [[screen pass]] to tight end [[Heath Miller]], but [[Desmond Bishop]] tackled him for a 3-yard loss. Then on third down [[Frank Zombo]] sacked Roethlisberger on the 34, and Suisham's ensuing 52-yard field goal attempt sailed wide left.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/07/super-bowl-green-bay-packers-pittsburgh-steelers?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Super Bowl 2011: Green Bay Packers beat Pittsburgh Steelers|date=February 7, 2011|work=Guardian|accessdate=February 8, 2011|location=London|first=Paolo|last=Bandini}}</ref>\n\nOn the first play of the fourth quarter, the Steelers lost their third turnover of the game when Mendenhall fumbled the ball while being tackled behind the line by Matthews and [[Ryan Pickett]]. Bishop recovered the ball and returned it 7 yards to the Packers 45. Five plays later on third down and 10, Rodgers completed a 38-yard pass to Nelson at the Steelers 2-yard line. Pittsburgh linebacker [[LaMarr Woodley]] sacked Rodgers for a 6-yard loss on the next play, but Rodgers threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Jennings after that, increasing the Packers lead to 28\u201317. Roethlisberger led the Steelers right back with 6 of 7 completions.  After a 9-yard pass to tight end [[Matt Spaeth]], he threw three completions to receiver [[Mike Wallace (American football)|Mike Wallace]] for 27 yards to the Green Bay 40-yard line. Then after a 15-yard completion to Ward, he finished the drive with a 25-yard touchdown pass to Wallace. On the two-point conversion play, Roethlisberger faked a hand-off to Mendenhall and ran up to the line before pitching the ball to Randle El, who scored on an outside sweep, cutting the Steelers deficit to 3 points at 28\u201325.\n\nGreen Bay took the ball back with just over 7 minutes left, and found themselves facing third down and 10 after two plays, but Rodgers kept the drive going with a 31-yard completion to Jennings over the middle. Starks then ran 14 yards to the Steelers 30. Two plays later, [[James Jones (wide receiver)|James Jones]] caught a 21-yard pass at the 8. The Steelers defense kept Green Bay out of the end zone, forcing the Packers to settle for a 23-yard field goal by [[Mason Crosby]] that gave Green Bay a 31\u201325 lead with 2:07 left in regulation.<ref name=\"pbp\">{{cite web|title=Play-By-Play|publisher=ESPN|date=February 6, 2011|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=310206009&period=0|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nPittsburgh got the ball back on their own 13-yard line following a penalty on the kickoff.

The Packers defeated the Steelers by the score of 31\u201325. The game was played on February 6, 2011 at [[AT&T Stadium|Cowboys Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas]], the first time the [[Super Bowl]] was played in the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas\u2013Fort Worth]] area.\n\nUnlike most other Super Bowls, this game featured two title-abundant franchises: coming into the game, the Packers held the most NFL championships with 12 (9 league championships prior to the Super Bowl era and 3 Super Bowl championships), while the Steelers held the most Super Bowl championships with 6. The Packers entered their fifth Super Bowl in team history, and became the first 6-seed team in the NFC to compete in the Super Bowl, after posting a 10\u20136 regular season record. The Steelers finished the regular season with a 12\u20134 record, and advanced to a league-tying 8th Super Bowl appearance.\n\nGreen Bay dominated most of the first half of Super Bowl XLV, jumping to a 21\u20133 lead before Pittsburgh cut it down to 21\u201310 just before halftime. Then after the teams exchanged touchdowns, the Steelers made the score 28\u201325 midway through the fourth quarter with wide receiver [[Mike Wallace (American football)|Mike Wallace]]'s 25-yard touchdown reception from quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] and a [[two-point conversion]]. But the Packers answered with [[Mason Crosby]]'s 23-yard field goal with 2:07 remaining, and then prevented the Steelers from scoring on their final drive of the game. Packers quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] was named [[Super Bowl MVP]], completing 24 of 39 passes for 304 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nThe broadcast of Super Bowl XLV on [[Fox NFL|Fox]] averaged about 111 million viewers, breaking the record for the [[List of most watched television broadcasts in the United States|most-watched program]] in American television history.<ref name=\"seidman1987\"/> The game's attendance was 103,219, just short of the Super Bowl record 103,985 set in [[Super Bowl XIV]] at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California]]. The halftime show featured the American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[The Black Eyed Peas]], with additional performances by [[Usher (singer)|Usher]] and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]].\n\n==Background==\n===Host selection process===\n[[File:Cowboys stadium.JPG|thumb|left|[[AT&T Stadium|Cowboys Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas]] was ultimately chosen as the site for Super Bowl XLV.]]\n\nThree NFL cities presented bids for the game:\n*In January 2007, [[Super Bowl VI]] [[Super Bowl MVP|MVP]] [[Roger Staubach]] was named chairman of the North Texas Super Bowl Bid Committee,<ref name=\"dalbiz\">{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Moore |title=Staubach to lead Dallas Super Bowl bid |work=[[Dallas Business Journal]] |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2007/01/22/daily38.html |date=January 25, 2007 |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}</ref> heading the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex|Metroplex]]'s bid effort.

They earned the [[AFC North]] division title, and the second seed in the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] and advanced to their 8th Super Bowl, tying the [[Dallas Cowboys]]' record of most Super Bowl appearances.\n\nAfter missing the first four games of the year on suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy (during which the Steelers went 3\u20131), quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] returned for his seventh season as the Steelers starting quarterback,  finishing the season with 3,200&nbsp;yards and 17 touchdowns, with just five interceptions, for a 97 passer rating.  He also rushed for 176 yards and two touchdowns.  The team's top receiver was [[Mike Wallace (American football)|Mike Wallace]] who caught 60 passes for 1,257&nbsp;yards and 10 touchdowns, giving him a 21&nbsp;yards per catch average.  Other reliable options included 13-year veteran [[Hines Ward]] (59 receptions for 755&nbsp;yards and 5 touchdowns), the Steelers all-time leading receiver, and tight end [[Heath Miller]] who caught 42 passes for 512&nbsp;yards.  Halfback [[Rashard Mendenhall]] was the team's leading rusher, gaining 1,273&nbsp;yards and 13 touchdowns while also catching 23 passes.  The line was led by rookie center [[Maurkice Pouncey]], the Steelers only pro bowl selection on offense.  However, Pouncey was injured in the AFC championship game and would be inactive for Super Bowl XLV.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.steelers.com/news/article-1/Pouncey-on-IR/a13e299e-dc4d-4977-9be4-a038c5e3238e |title=Pouncey on IR |website=Pittsburgh Steelers |access-date=December 15, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216034903/http://www.steelers.com/news/article-1/Pouncey-on-IR/a13e299e-dc4d-4977-9be4-a038c5e3238e |archive-date=December 16, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Steelers had one of the league's top defenses, leading the NFL in sacks (48), and fewest points (14.5) and rushing yards (62.8) allowed per game, while ranking second in fewest total yards (276.8).  The line was anchored by pro bowl end [[Brett Keisel]].  The Steelers also had four excellent linebackers:  [[LaMarr Woodley]], [[James Harrison (American football)|James Harrison]], [[James Farrior]], and [[Lawrence Timmons]].  For the third consecutive year, Woodley and Harrison each recorded at least 10 sacks.  Woodley also forced three fumbles and Harrison forced six.  Farrior had 109 total tackles and six sacks.  Timmons led the team with 135 total tackles, while also recording three sacks and two interceptions.  The secondary was led by pro bowl safety [[Troy Polamalu]], who won the [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award]], tying his career-best seven interceptions and returning them for 101&nbsp;yards and a touchdown.\n\nCoach [[Mike Tomlin]], already the youngest coach to ever win a Super Bowl, became the youngest coach ever to make it to the Super Bowl twice at age 38. The Pittsburgh Steelers had also accomplished going to the Super Bowl in five different decades; and, in every decade since the post AFL-NFL merger. 1970s: 1975, 1976, and 1979. 1980s: 1980. 1990s: 1996. 2000s: 2006 and 2009. 2010s: 2011.\n\n====Green Bay Packers====\n{{main|2010 Green Bay Packers season}}\nThe Green Bay Packers finished the season with a 10\u20136 record and became the first number 6-seeded team in the NFC to compete in the Super Bowl. They are only the second number 6 seeded team to reach the Super Bowl, with the only other number 6 seed to accomplish this feat being the [[2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], who won [[Super Bowl XL]] following the 2005 season. Green Bay also joined the 2005 Steelers as the only teams ever to defeat the top three seeded teams on the road in the playoffs. In order to secure their fifth Super Bowl bid they defeated their longtime rivals, the [[Chicago Bears]], in the [[NFC Championship Game]] at [[Soldier Field]].\n\nThe offense was led by quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]], who was in his third year as a starter after taking over for the team's all-time leading passer [[Brett Favre]].  Rodgers finished the season completing 65.7% of his passes for 3,922&nbsp;yards and 28 touchdowns, with only eleven interceptions, giving him his second consecutive season with a triple digit passer rating (101.2).  He was also a good rusher, adding 356&nbsp;yards and 4 touchdowns on the ground.  His top target was pro bowl receiver [[Greg Jennings]], who caught 76 passes for 1,265&nbsp;yards and 12 touchdowns, giving him a 16.6&nbsp;yards per catch average while also ranking him fourth in the NFL in yards and second in touchdown catches. Other reliable targets included receivers [[James Jones (wide receiver)|James Jones]] (50 receptions, 676&nbsp;yards, 5 touchdowns), [[Donald Driver]] (51 receptions, 565 yards, 4 touchdowns), and [[Jordy Nelson]] (45 receptions, 582&nbsp;yards, 496 kick return yards). The Packers lost star tight end [[Jermichael Finley]]  (21 receptions 301&nbsp;yards, 1 touchdown) to injury in week five who was their leading receiver at the time. The Packers ground game was crippled by injuries, especially the Week 1 loss of [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]], who had rushed for over 1,200 yards in each of the last two seasons. In his absence, the team relied prominently on [[Brandon Jackson (American football)|Brandon Jackson]], who rushed for 703&nbsp;yards and caught 43 passes for 342, and fullback [[John Kuhn]], who added 281&nbsp;yards on the ground. The team's offensive line was anchored by pro bowl tackle [[Chad Clifton]], an 11-year veteran.\n\nThe Packers defense ranked second in the league in fewest points allowed per game (15).  The line was led by [[Cullen Jenkins]], who recorded seven sacks in just eleven games, and 338-pound defensive tackle [[B. J. Raji]], who had 6.5.  The linebackers were led by pro bowler [[Clay Matthews III|Clay Matthews]] and [[A. J. Hawk]].  Matthews ranked fourth in the NFL with 13.5 sacks, while Hawk led the team in combined tackles (111) and intercepted three passes.  Three of the Packers starters in the secondary had made the pro bowl. [[Tramon Williams]] led the team with a career-high 6 interceptions, while adding 326 punt return yards.  Other pro bowl selections included safety [[Nick Collins]] (4 interceptions and 70 combined tackles) and hard hitting 13-year veteran cornerback [[Charles Woodson]], who recorded 92 total tackles and forced five fumbles, while also intercepting two passes.\n\nThe Packers entered the Super Bowl never having trailed by more than 7&nbsp;points at any point during the season\u2014a feat that had never been accomplished during a complete season in the Super Bowl era. The last team to complete a season with this distinction was the [[Detroit Lions]] in [[1962 Detroit Lions season|1962]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/?p=8534 |title=Super Bowl notes: Stat of the Year and Updated SRS Standings |first=Chase |last=Stuart |work=Pro Football Reference Blog |publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com |date=January 26, 2011 |accessdate=February 6, 2011}}</ref>  In the Super Bowl game itself, the Packers never trailed.\n\nOf note, this was Green Bay's first Super Bowl against an AFC team that was not one of the \"Original 8\" [[American Football League]] franchises. The Packers had played Kansas City, Oakland, New England, and Denver in their four previous Super Bowl match-ups, winning against all but Denver. The Steelers, like the Packers, predated the AFL's launch, having begun play in 1933 (12 years after the Packers joined the NFL after two years as an independent team), and moved to the AFC in [[1970 NFL season|1970]] as a result of the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]] to even out the two conferences.\n\n===Playoffs===\n{{main|2010\u201311 NFL playoffs}}\n\nPittsburgh advanced to the Super Bowl with two close wins in the playoffs.  After a first-round bye, the Steelers defeated their division rival, the number 5 seeded [[2010 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] 31\u201324, with [[Ben Roethlisberger]]'s 58-yard completion to [[Antonio Brown]] on third down and 19 setting up [[Rashard Mendenhall]]'s game winning 2-yard touchdown run with 1:33 left in the game.  Roethlisberger finished with 226 passing yards and two touchdowns, while the defense forced three turnovers and sacked Baltimore QB [[Joe Flacco]] five times, three by [[James Harrison (American football)|James Harrison]].\n\nThen the Steelers defeated the number 6 seeded [[2010 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] 24\u201319 in the [[AFC Championship Game]]. Pittsburgh seemed to be in complete control at first, taking a 24\u20130 lead in the first half. Jets quarterback [[Mark Sanchez]] rallied his team back, cutting the score to 24\u201310 going into the fourth quarter.  The Jets then drove to the Steelers 2-yard line on a 17-play drive, but the Pittsburgh defense made a key stand, keeping them out of the end zone on four consecutive plays near the goal-line to force a turnover.  New York subsequently forced a safety and scored a touchdown with just over three minutes left, but Roethlisberger's 14-yard completions to Brown and [[Heath Miller]] allowed Pittsburgh to hang onto the ball until time expired.  Mendenhall finished with 121 rushing yards and a touchdown, along with 2 catches for 32&nbsp;yards.\n\nGreen Bay started off their postseason with a 21\u201316 win over the number 3 seeded [[2010 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] after [[Tramon Williams]] intercepted a pass from [[Michael Vick]] in the end zone with less than a minute left to play.  [[Aaron Rodgers]] threw for 180&nbsp;yards and three touchdowns while [[James Starks]], who only rushed for 101&nbsp;yards during the season, rushed for 123&nbsp;yards in the game.\n\nThe Packers then went to Georgia, where the top-seeded 13\u20133 [[2010 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] were waiting.  Although the Falcons took advantage of an early turnover and a kick return touchdown to build a 14\u20137 lead, Green Bay quickly buried the Falcons with 35 straight points.  By the end of the first half, the Packers held a 28\u201314 lead, and went on to win comfortably, 48\u201321.  Rodgers was nearly perfect, completing 31 of 36 passes for 366 yards and three touchdowns, while adding another score on the ground.  [[Jordy Nelson]] and [[James Jones (wide receiver)|James Jones]] both had touchdown catches, while [[John Kuhn]] added scores by air and ground and Tramon Williams returned one of his two interceptions 70&nbsp;yards for a touchdown.  Green Bay's special teams unit never had to punt the ball, while [[Mason Crosby]] contributed two field goals.\n\nGreen Bay next faced the number 2 [[2010 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] in the [[NFC Championship Game]], defeating them 21\u201314.  This time Rodgers had a rougher day than his previous two games, throwing no touchdown passes and being intercepted twice.  But he still threw for 244 yards and scored a 1-yard touchdown run, while Starks added 74 rushing yards, including a touchdown run in the second quarter.  Meanwhile, Green Bay's defense knocked Chicago quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] out of the game and intercepted three passes, one of which was returned 18&nbsp;yards for a touchdown by [[B. J. Raji]].  The other two were made by rookie [[Sam Shields]], who recorded his second interception near his own end zone with 37 seconds left to put the game away.\n\n===Super Bowl pregame notes===\n[[File:American Sign Language Interpreter.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An [[American Sign Language]] interpreter in the [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]] jersey appearing at a rally for the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] prior to Super Bowl XLV.]]\nBoth teams are known to have sizable fanbases that often travel to away games, largely due to the home games themselves having [[NFL season ticket waiting lists|decades-long waiting lists]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=dw-packersvssteelers012311|title=Blue-blooded Pack, Steelers in dream matchup}}</ref> In August 2008, [[ESPN.com]] ranked the two teams tied as having the best fans in the NFL.<ref>{{cite news |first= Matt|last= Mosley|title= NFL's best fans?

Then on the first play after the ensuing kickoff, quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] was hit by [[Howard Green]] as he threw a pass, causing the ball to go well short of his intended target near the left sideline where it was intercepted by [[Nick Collins]] and returned 37&nbsp;yards for a touchdown, giving Green Bay a 14\u20130 lead. This score continued the unbeaten streak of Super Bowl victories recorded by teams scoring on an interception run-back, improving to 11\u20130 in such games. It was also the third consecutive Super Bowl with an interception return for a touchdown, as well as the eighth such score in the last ten Super Bowls.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-02-06-nfl-super-bowl-xlv-green-bay-packers-pittsburgh-steelers_N.htm|title=Rodgers, Packers top Steelers 31\u201325 to win Super Bowl XLV|date=February 6, 2011|work=USA Today|accessdate=February 7, 2011|first=Jarrett|last=Bell}}</ref>  The Packers also tied the [[1973 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins']] record which still stands for the largest Super Bowl lead (14 points) at the end of the first quarter, set in [[Super Bowl VIII]] against the [[1973 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] and later tied by the [[1980 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] against the [[1980 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] in [[Super Bowl XV]].\n\nThis time Pittsburgh managed to respond, driving 49&nbsp;yards in 13 plays including Roethlisberger's 18-yard run on 3rd down and 9. [[Shaun Suisham]] finished the drive with a 33-yard field goal to cut the score to 14\u20133. Then after forcing a punt, the Steelers drove to midfield, but turned the ball over again when Roethlisberger's pass was intercepted by defensive back [[Jarrett Bush]] at the 47. After the interception, Rodgers led the Packers to another score, completing two passes for 20&nbsp;yards before [[James Starks]]'s 12-yard run moved the ball to the 21-yard line. On the next play, Green Bay increased their lead to 21\u20133 with Rodgers' 21-yard touchdown pass to [[Greg Jennings]]. Taking the ball back with 2:24 left in the second quarter, Roethlisberger made a 37-yard completion to [[Antwaan Randle El]] on their first play. After that, receiver [[Hines Ward]] caught three passes for 39&nbsp;yards on the drive, the last one an 8-yard touchdown catch with 37 seconds left in the half, making the score 21\u201310 at halftime.  This was the fourth time in their four 2011 postseason games that the Packers finished the first half with a lead of at least 11 points. The first half had taken a heavy toll on both teams. The Steelers lost wide receiver [[Emmanuel Sanders]] to injury, while the Packers lost receiver [[Donald Driver]] along with defensive backs [[Charles Woodson]] and [[Sam Shields]]. Shields would be the only player among them who would return.  The Black Eyed Peas played at halftime.\n\n===Second half===\n[[File:Field goal attempt (6841820199).jpg|thumb|Steelers Field Goal Kick]]\nPittsburgh's defense forced Green Bay to punt on the first drive of the second half, and got the ball at midfield after a face-mask call on [[Tom Crabtree]] while tackling [[Antonio Brown]] on the punt return. The offense then scored in five plays (all runs). First, [[Rashard Mendenhall]] broke free along with right sideline for a 17-yard run, then [[Isaac Redman]] rushed for 3&nbsp;yards, and Roethlisberger ran for 6, bringing up third down and 1. On the next play, Redman tried to run up the middle, but was held up at the line, so he backed away and ran to the outside for a 16-yard gain to the 8-yard line. Then Mendenhall scored an 8-yard touchdown run on the next play, making the score 21\u201317.  After forcing a punt, Pittsburgh mounted a drive to the Packers 29-yard line, but Green Bay's defense made a stand. First Roethlisberger's pass was batted down behind the line by linebacker [[Clay Matthews III|Clay Matthews]], then Roethlisberger tried a [[screen pass]] to tight end [[Heath Miller]], but [[Desmond Bishop]] tackled him for a 3-yard loss. Then on third down [[Frank Zombo]] sacked Roethlisberger on the 34, and Suisham's ensuing 52-yard field goal attempt sailed wide left.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/07/super-bowl-green-bay-packers-pittsburgh-steelers?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Super Bowl 2011: Green Bay Packers beat Pittsburgh Steelers|date=February 7, 2011|work=Guardian|accessdate=February 8, 2011|location=London|first=Paolo|last=Bandini}}</ref>\n\nOn the first play of the fourth quarter, the Steelers lost their third turnover of the game when Mendenhall fumbled the ball while being tackled behind the line by Matthews and [[Ryan Pickett]]. Bishop recovered the ball and returned it 7 yards to the Packers 45. Five plays later on third down and 10, Rodgers completed a 38-yard pass to Nelson at the Steelers 2-yard line. Pittsburgh linebacker [[LaMarr Woodley]] sacked Rodgers for a 6-yard loss on the next play, but Rodgers threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Jennings after that, increasing the Packers lead to 28\u201317. Roethlisberger led the Steelers right back with 6 of 7 completions.  After a 9-yard pass to tight end [[Matt Spaeth]], he threw three completions to receiver [[Mike Wallace (American football)|Mike Wallace]] for 27 yards to the Green Bay 40-yard line. Then after a 15-yard completion to Ward, he finished the drive with a 25-yard touchdown pass to Wallace. On the two-point conversion play, Roethlisberger faked a hand-off to Mendenhall and ran up to the line before pitching the ball to Randle El, who scored on an outside sweep, cutting the Steelers deficit to 3 points at 28\u201325.\n\nGreen Bay took the ball back with just over 7 minutes left, and found themselves facing third down and 10 after two plays, but Rodgers kept the drive going with a 31-yard completion to Jennings over the middle. Starks then ran 14 yards to the Steelers 30. Two plays later, [[James Jones (wide receiver)|James Jones]] caught a 21-yard pass at the 8.

{"title_page": "Blackout (broadcasting)", "text_new": "{{short description|Non-airing of programming (typically sports-related) in a certain media market}}\n{{For|blackouts of syndicated programming|syndication exclusivity}}\n\nIn [[broadcasting]], the term '''blackout''' refers to the non-airing of [[television program|television]] or [[radio programming|radio]] programming in a certain [[media market]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Unplugging a Nation|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/forwa35&div=19&id=&page=|website=HEIN Online|publisher=Fletcher|accessdate=October 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIt is particularly prevalent in the [[broadcasting of sports events]], although other television or radio programs may be blacked out as well. Most blackout policies serve to protect local broadcasters (primarily [[regional sports network]]s) from competition by \"out-of-market\" networks that carry different teams, by only allowing viewers to watch non-national telecasts of teams within their designated markets (with television providers blacking out regional telecasts of teams that are outside their market; in turn, encouraging viewers to purchase subscription-based [[out-of-market sports package]]s), and by allowing teams to black out national telecasts of games that are also being shown by a local broadcaster.\n\nBy contrast, the blackout policies of the [[National Football League]] serve to encourage attendance to games instead\u2014by only allowing them to be broadcast on television in a team's designated market if a certain percentage of their tickets are sold prior to the game. Similarly, there is a blanket blackout on all telecasts of [[association football]] (soccer) in the United Kingdom between 2:45 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. on Saturday matchdays.\n\nThe term is also used in relation to situations where programming is removed or replaced on international feeds of a television service, because the broadcaster does not hold the territorial rights to air the programs outside of their home country.\n\n==Canada==\n\n===Federal elections===\nPerhaps the most notable non-sports-related blackout in television was the blackout of [[Canadian federal election]] coverage. Because there are six [[time zone]]s across Canada, polls close in different parts of the country at different times. [[Section 329 of the Canada Elections Act]] outlawed disseminating election results from other ridings in constituencies where polls were still open, ostensibly to prevent the results from [[Eastern Canada|the East]] from influencing voters in [[Western Canada|western ridings]]<ref name=cbc-blackoutgone15/>\n\nHowever, in the [[2000 Canadian federal election|federal election in 2000]], Paul Charles Bryan published results from [[Atlantic Canada]] online despite being told not to by the authorities. Bryan was charged before the [[Provincial Court of British Columbia]], but fought the charges as unconstitutional under [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 2]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which protects freedom of expression and [[freedom of association]]. Bryan's victory before the [[British Columbia Supreme Court]] meant that voters in [[British Columbia]] and the rest of Canada legally learned of election results in other ridings during the [[2004 Canadian federal election|federal election in 2004]]. However, Elections Canada appealed, and Bryan lost his case before the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]]. Bryan further appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], but in a ruling made on March 15, 2007 (''[[R. v. Bryan]]''), in a 5-4 ruling, the Court ruled that Section 329 of the Canada Elections Act is [[constitutional]] and justified under [[section 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. [[Stephen Harper]], who later became Prime Minister, labelled [[Elections Canada]] \"jackasses\" and tried to raise money for Bryan. The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] also supported Bryan, hoping to \"make election night a bigger event that it already is\".<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Supreme Court upholds blackout on early election night results | publisher = CBC.ca | pages = | language = | work=[[CBC News]] | accessdate = 2014-11-04 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/supreme-court-upholds-blackout-on-early-election-night-results-1.667761 | date = 2007-06-26}}</ref>\n\nBefore the 2000 election, Elections Canada moved to reduce the effects of the blackout and the influence of unauthorized knowledge of election results in Western ridings by altering the times that polls close, so that polls no longer close at the same local time throughout the country.

The practice originated in the 1960s; [[Burnley F.C.]] chairman [[Bob Lord (football chairman)|Bob Lord]] was opposed to television broadcasts of football matches\u2014going as far as banning the [[BBC Sport|BBC]] from televising ''[[Match of the Day]]'' from [[Turf Moor]] for a time. He pushed the [[English Football League|Football League]] to adopt this stance as an organization-wide policy; it has since been adopted by [[The FA]] and the current [[Premier League]] (which broke away from the Football League in the 1990s to become the highest level of club football in the UK).\n\nAffected matches can still be broadcast internationally, hence more Premier League matches can be shown outside the United Kingdom by other rightsholders than within. This intricacy created a \"[[grey market]]\" for obtaining the broadcasts from alternative sources, such as foreign satellite providers or unofficial online streaming services.

Typically, no other games involving U.S. teams are scheduled to occur at the same time. NHL Network and NBCSN typically broadcast non-exclusive national games outside these windows which are blacked out in the participating teams' markets to protect local broadcasts. All games in the first round of the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]], outside those designated for exclusive broadcast by NBC, are non-exclusive national games. Since [[2017 Stanley Cup playoffs|2017]], they may now co-exist with national broadcasts on [[NBCUniversal]] cable channels and NHL Network, except in some areas that have an NBCUniversal-owned regional sports network.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://nbcsportsgrouppressbox.com/2017/04/10/nbc-sports-groups-coverage-of-2017-stanley-cup-playoffs-begins-wednesday-night-with-five-games/|title=NBC Sports Group's Coverage of the 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs Begins Wednesday With Five Games|publisher=NBC Sports|date=April 10, 2017|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOut-of-market games can be viewed using the subscription-based [[MLB Extra Innings]], [[MLB.tv]], [[NHL Center Ice]], and [[NHL.tv]] services, although in-market games are blacked out from all four services to protect local broadcasters, and they do not offer nationally televised games.\n\n====Radio blackouts====\nIn Major League Baseball, there are no radio blackouts. However, for many years, the radio networks of the two participating ballclubs in the [[World Series]] were not allowed to air games, forcing [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship stations]], if they wanted to broadcast the Series, to simulcast the network broadcast.\n\nAs an example, while [[Boston Red Sox]] radio flagship [[WEEI (AM)|WHDH]] and [[St. Louis Cardinals]] flagship station [[KMOX]] both broadcast the [[1967 World Series]], both stations had to simulcast the [[NBC Radio Network]] broadcast along with Boston's [[WWDJ|WCOP]] and St. Louis's [[KTRS (AM)|KSD]], the nominal NBC Radio affiliates in those cities.\n\nThis changed after [[1980 World Series|1980]], as fans of the [[1980 Philadelphia Phillies|Philadelphia Phillies]] were angry that they could not hear their popular broadcasting team of [[Harry Kalas]] and [[Richie Ashburn]] call the team's run to the title. Since then, only the flagship stations of the two participating ballclubs can originate coverage, though their broadcasts, as well as the national English and Spanish broadcasts, are also available on [[Sirius XM]]. Flagship stations are required to make mention of the presenting sponsor of the national ESPN Radio broadcasts as also sponsoring the team's own broadcasts during the World Series (as of 2016 this is [[AutoZone]]). All other network affiliates of the two clubs must carry the feed from MLB's national partner (currently ESPN Radio). If another ESPN Radio affiliate exists in the same market, that station can claim exclusivity, forcing a blackout of the team network affiliate from carrying the game, though this is rarely done as listener pushback against the ESPN Radio affiliate blocking the local play-by-play would likely be untenable (for instance in [[2016 World Series|2016]], ESPN Radio O&O [[WMVP]] in [[Chicago]] broadcast the national ESPN feed as expected, but made no move to block the official [[2016 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]] broadcaster [[WSCR]] from carrying local play-by-play, to the point of only mentioning the national coverage existed on their station through promos in national ESPN Radio programming).\n\nAdditionally, radio stations (including flagships) may not include MLB games in the live [[Internet]] [[streaming media|streams]] of their station programming. MLB itself offers radio feeds as a pay service via the league and team websites, along with being a part of the monthly premium fee service from streaming provider [[TuneIn]]. Some stations will simply stream the station's regularly scheduled programming that is being pre-empted by the game.\n\nThe NHL has no radio blackouts for local broadcasts, although [[NBC Sports Radio]] broadcasts are, similarly to some cable broadcasts, not carried within the local markets of participating teams.\n\n===NBA blackout policy===\nPrior to the [[1998-99 NBA lockout]], the NBA and the WNBA used to black out nationally televised games on [[cable television]] within {{convert|35|mi|km}} of the home team's market; however, these are now restricted to games on [[NBA TV]], WatchESPN and other streaming providers.\n\n===NFL blackout policy===\n{{See also|National Football League television blackout policies}}\nThe NFL has engaged in various blackout policies to protect both local ticket sales, and local rightsholders of specific games.\n\n==== Blackouts based on attendance ====\nIn the NFL, any broadcaster that has a signal that hits any area within a {{convert|75|mi|km}} radius of an NFL [[stadium]] may only broadcast a game if that game is a road game (also known as an away game), or if the game sells out 72 hours or more before the start time for the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/ticket/faq|title=NFL Sunday Ticket FAQ;  Why does the NFL have blackouts?|publisher=NFL|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402115148/http://www.nfl.com/ticket/faq/#QUESTION4|archivedate=April 2, 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What are the NFL blackout rules for my home team?|url=https://support.directv.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/484|publisher=DirecTV|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}</ref>  If sold out in less than 72 hours, or is close to being sold out by the deadline, the team can sometimes request a time extension. Furthermore, broadcasters with NFL contracts are required to show their markets' road games, even if the [[secondary market]]s have substantial fanbases for other teams (like in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], officially a [[Baltimore Ravens]] secondary market, but home to many [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] fans{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}). Sometimes{{when|date=February 2016}} if a game is within a few hundred tickets of selling out, a broadcaster{{examples|date=February 2016}} with rights to show the nearly sold out game will buy the remaining tickets (and give them to local charities) so it can broadcast the game. Other teams elect to close off sections of their stadium, but cannot sell these tickets for any game that season if they choose to do so.<ref>{{cite news | last = Lomeli | first = Andrew | title = NFL blackout blunder | work = [[The Stanford Daily]] | date = 2006-10-10 | url = http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2006/10/10/nflBlackoutBlunder | accessdate = 2007-07-03 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20061023191517/http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2006/10/10/nflBlackoutBlunder|archivedate=October 23, 2006}}</ref> As a result, if the home team's game is a Sunday day game, both networks can air only one game each in that market (until 2000, this rule applied whether or not the game was blacked out; however, this was changed because some markets virtually never aired doubleheaders as a result). Usually, but not always, when each network can show only one game each in a market, the two stations work out between themselves which will show an early game and which will show a late game. This only affects the primary market, and not markets in a {{convert|75|mi|km|adj=on}} radius, which always get a doubleheader each Sunday. For the [[NFL International Series]], the network broadcasting an International Series game will not have the game blacked out for the team's markets as the game is played outside of the United States; however, some blackout regulations do apply.\n\nThere have been two exceptions to the rule, of which one has never been implemented and the other no longer applies. The first is for the [[Green Bay Packers]], which have two overlapping 75-mile blackout zones \u2013 one surrounding [[Lambeau Field|the team's stadium]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] and another surrounding [[Milwaukee]]. The team's [[WTMJ (AM)|radio flagship station]] is in Milwaukee, and the Packers played part of their home schedule in Milwaukee from 1953 through 1994. However, this policy has never been implemented in the Packers' case, as they have sold out every home game in Green Bay since 1960 and have a decades-long season-ticket waiting list (games in Milwaukee also sold out during this period). The second exception was for the [[Bills Toronto Series]]; by a technicality, [[Rogers Communications]] (the team's lessee) owned all tickets to those games and resold them to potential fans. Even when Rogers failed to sell all of the tickets, they were still technically defined to be sellouts by the league since Rogers was said to have \"bought\" the tickets. The technicality came into play for both Toronto Series preseason games, and again for the last two regular season games of the series.<ref>{{cite web | title = Edwards leads Bills in win vs. Steelers | publisher = [[Associated Press]] | date = 2008-08-14 | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=280814002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=TV Interest in Bills Increases|publisher=Still Talkin' TV|date=2010-08-20|url=http://stilltalkintv.com/2010/08/tv-interest-in-bills-increases/|last=Pergament|first=Alan|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209175437/http://stilltalkintv.com/2010/08/tv-interest-in-bills-increases/|archivedate=2011-02-09}}</ref> The Bills Toronto Series was cancelled after the 2013 season, largely due to the aforementioned lackluster attendance.\n\nIn June 2012, NFL blackout regulations were revised in which, for the first time in NFL history, home games would no longer require a total sellout to be televised locally; instead, teams would  be allowed to set a benchmark anywhere from 85 to 100 percent of the stadium's non-premium seats.

The local market for these rights is defined as any station within the {{convert|75|mi|km|adj=on}} radius of a team's respective stadium.\n\nThis policy attracted controversy in December 2007, when [[Hartford, Connecticut]] [[CBS]] affiliate [[WFSB]] was refused permission to air the local simulcast of a [[2007 New England Patriots \u2013 New York Giants game|New England Patriots-New York Giants]] game on December 29, 2007. The game, which was part of the ''Thursday Night Football'' package on NFL Network, would see the Patriots attempt to become the first NFL team since 1972 and the expansion of the regular season to 16 games, to finish the regular season undefeated.

There are no radio blackouts, but only each team's flagship station can carry local broadcasts during the conference championships or [[Super Bowl]]. All other markets must carry the ''[[NFL on Westwood One]]'' feed for those games. For all other weeks, within 75 miles of a team's stadium, only stations the team or its flagship station contracts with can carry those games, regardless if the team is home or away. Thus, any competing station that carries Westwood One broadcasts cannot air those games. Like MLB, the NFL makes local broadcasts (except for those of the [[Tennessee Titans]]) available on NFL's Game Pass service and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]; as a result, radio stations that carry NFL games, from any source, and stream on the Internet are prohibited from streaming games online, although it seems this provision is loosely enforced in some cases; [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]] in Chicago regularly airs live broadcasts of Chicago Bears games over their Internet stream, as does [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ]] in Milwaukee with the Packers, though both stations went to a desktop-only streaming policy in 2015 due to the introduction of GamePass and the absorption of the [[NFL Audio Pass]] streaming system into Game Pass.\n\n===MLS===\nMajor League Soccer applies local blackout rights for the broadcasts of the following teams as a part of [[MLS Direct Kick]]:\n* [[Colorado Rapids]]\n* [[D.C. United]]\n* [[LA Galaxy]]\n* [[Los Angeles FC]]\n* [[New England Revolution]]\n* [[New York Red Bulls]]\n* [[New York City FC]]\n\n====Game availability====\nMLS Direct Kick contains [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] games originating from either a regional sports network (RSN) or a local over-the-air station and delivers these games to customers who purchase this subscription. These games are not otherwise available to DirecTV subscribers because they are broadcast outside a subscriber's local area. Further, MLS games shown nationally on [[ESPN]], [[ESPN2]], [[UniM\u00e1s]] and [[FOX Broadcasting Company|FOX]] are not included as part of this sports subscription.\n\n===Indianapolis 500===\nTo encourage local attendance, the live television broadcast of the [[Indianapolis 500]] is blacked out on the [[Indianapolis]] affiliate of its broadcaster (currently [[IndyCar Series on NBC|NBC]] station [[WTHR]], and previously [[IndyCar Series on ABC|ABC]] station [[WRTV]]) if the race is not a sell-out.

Most blackout policies serve to protect local broadcasters (primarily [[regional sports network]]s) from competition by \"out-of-market\" networks that carry different teams, by only allowing viewers to watch non-national telecasts of teams within their designated markets (with television providers blacking out regional telecasts of teams that are outside their market; in turn, encouraging viewers to purchase subscription-based [[out-of-market sports package]]s), and by allowing teams to black out national telecasts of games that are also being shown by a local broadcaster.\n\nBy contrast, the blackout policies of the [[National Football League]] serve to encourage attendance to games instead\u2014by only allowing them to be broadcast on television in a team's designated market if a certain percentage of their tickets are sold prior to the game. Similarly, there is a blanket blackout on all telecasts of [[association football]] (soccer) in the United Kingdom between 2:45 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. on Saturday matchdays.\n\nThe term is also used in relation to situations where programming is removed or replaced on international feeds of a television service, because the broadcaster does not hold the territorial rights to air the programs outside of their home country.\n\n==Canada==\n\n===Federal elections===\nPerhaps the most notable non-sports-related blackout in television was the blackout of [[Canadian federal election]] coverage. Because there are six [[time zone]]s across Canada, polls close in different parts of the country at different times. [[Section 329 of the Canada Elections Act]] outlawed disseminating election results from other ridings in constituencies where polls were still open, ostensibly to prevent the results from [[Eastern Canada|the East]] from influencing voters in [[Western Canada|western ridings]]<ref name=cbc-blackoutgone15/>\n\nHowever, in the [[2000 Canadian federal election|federal election in 2000]], Paul Charles Bryan published results from [[Atlantic Canada]] online despite being told not to by the authorities. Bryan was charged before the [[Provincial Court of British Columbia]], but fought the charges as unconstitutional under [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 2]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which protects freedom of expression and [[freedom of association]]. Bryan's victory before the [[British Columbia Supreme Court]] meant that voters in [[British Columbia]] and the rest of Canada legally learned of election results in other ridings during the [[2004 Canadian federal election|federal election in 2004]]. However, Elections Canada appealed, and Bryan lost his case before the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]]. Bryan further appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], but in a ruling made on March 15, 2007 (''[[R. v. Bryan]]''), in a 5-4 ruling, the Court ruled that Section 329 of the Canada Elections Act is [[constitutional]] and justified under [[section 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. [[Stephen Harper]], who later became Prime Minister, labelled [[Elections Canada]] \"jackasses\" and tried to raise money for Bryan. The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] also supported Bryan, hoping to \"make election night a bigger event that it already is\".<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Supreme Court upholds blackout on early election night results | publisher = CBC.ca | pages = | language = | work=[[CBC News]] | accessdate = 2014-11-04 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/supreme-court-upholds-blackout-on-early-election-night-results-1.667761 | date = 2007-06-26}}</ref>\n\nBefore the 2000 election, Elections Canada moved to reduce the effects of the blackout and the influence of unauthorized knowledge of election results in Western ridings by altering the times that polls close, so that polls no longer close at the same local time throughout the country. Polls in [[Atlantic Canada]] close at 9 p.m. [[Atlantic Standard Time|Atlantic]] (9:30 [[Newfoundland Standard Time|in Newfoundland]]), polls from [[Alberta]] to [[Quebec]] close an hour later (9 p.m. [[North American Eastern Standard Time Zone|Eastern]], 8 p.m. [[Central Time Zone (North America)|Central]] and 7 p.m. [[Mountain Standard Time|Mountain]]) and finally, polls in British Columbia close an hour after that (7 p.m. [[Pacific Standard Time|Pacific]]). Historically, the results of the election are often not decisively known until more than an hour after polls close in the Eastern Time Zone, but are usually known within two hours of these polls closing.\n\nProvincial elections are not subject to blackout restrictions \u2013 in provinces that have two time zones, the vast majority of the population lives in one time zone or the other. Election laws in these provinces stipulate that all polls are to close at the same time \u2013 this time invariably being 8:00&nbsp;p.m. (or 9:00&nbsp;p.m. in Ontario beginning with the [[2007 Ontario general election|2007 provincial election]]) in the time zone of the majority.\n\nOn August 17, 2011, Elections Canada Chief Electoral Officer [[Marc Mayrand]] suggested improvements of the voting system to Parliament; among them were a proposal to remove the blackout rule, citing the expanded use of [[social media]] to disseminate results outside radio and television.<ref name=Globe081711>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-notebook/lift-election-night-blackout-and-test-e-voting-electoral-officer-says/article2132700/?from=sec431|title=Lift election-night blackout and test e-voting, electoral officer says|first=JANE|last=TABER|date=17 August 2011|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2017|via=The Globe and Mail}}</ref> Mayrand stated that \"the growing use of social media puts in question not only the practical enforceability of the rule, but also its very intelligibility and usefulness in a world where the distinction between private communication and public transmission is quickly eroding.

The practice originated in the 1960s; [[Burnley F.C.]] chairman [[Bob Lord (football chairman)|Bob Lord]] was opposed to television broadcasts of football matches\u2014going as far as banning the [[BBC Sport|BBC]] from televising ''[[Match of the Day]]'' from [[Turf Moor]] for a time. He pushed the [[English Football League|Football League]] to adopt this stance as an organization-wide policy; it has since been adopted by [[The FA]] and the current [[Premier League]] (which broke away from the Football League in the 1990s to become the highest level of club football in the UK).\n\nAffected matches can still be broadcast internationally, hence more Premier League matches can be shown outside the United Kingdom by other rightsholders than within. This intricacy created a \"[[grey market]]\" for obtaining the broadcasts from alternative sources, such as foreign satellite providers or unofficial online streaming services. The Premier League and other stakeholders have historically considered this practice to be a violation of the [[copyright]] of the broadcasts. In 2014, for taking inadequate steps to prevent unauthorized retransmissions from its streaming broadcasts online, the Premier League briefly restricted [[MENA]] region rightsholder [[beIN Sports]] to one 3 p.m. match per week on television only.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportcal.com/News/FeaturedNews/9816|title=BeIN Sports to resume full English Premier League broadcasts after league lifts restrictions |website=Sportcal|access-date=2018-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=EPL fans let down by beIN Sports coverage as piracy woes continue|url=http://sport360.com/article/football/24945/epl-fans-let-down-bein-sports-coverage-piracy-woes-continue/|accessdate=2017-01-13}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian-fightback\"/>\n\nCritics, including [[Juliane Kokott]], have argued that 3 p.m. blackouts are outdated, as its purpose is hindered\u2014especially within the Premier League\u2014by the high demand for the few tickets available to the public, and that there was little evidence that television broadcasts actually affected attendance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-15162241|title=Premier League games can be shown on foreign decoders|last=Wilson|first=Bill|date=2011-10-04|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40483486|title=Premier League: Third of fans say they watch illegal streams of matches - survey|date=2017-07-03|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian-fightback\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/29/premier-league-illegal-streaming-tv-audiences|title=Premier League launches major fightback against illegal streaming|last=MacInnes|first=Paul|date=2017-03-29|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> To preserve the value of its domestic broadcast rights and allow more games to be televised, the Premier League has added more matches in windows outside of Saturday afternoons, such as weekdays and Sundays\u2014including the [[Survival Sunday|final matchday of the season]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/867361/why-premier-league-soccer-games-cant-be-shown-at-3pm-in-the-uk/|title=The most popular sport in the UK is barely on television, even during the holidays|last=Murphy|first=Mike|work=Quartz|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/barcelona-vs-real-madrid-el-clasico-why-uk-fans-will-not-be-able-to-watch-a7357431.html|title=Why UK fans will not be able to watch Barcelona vs Real Madrid|date=2016-10-12|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, after complying by blacking out the first 15 minutes of a [[Serie A]] match that saw [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]'s on-field debut for [[Juventus F.C.]], streaming service [[Eleven Sports UK & Ireland]] began to defy the ban and show selected Serie A and [[La Liga]] matches during this period.

Unless a national broadcaster such as [[Fox Major League Baseball|Fox]] or [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]] has exclusive rights to a certain regular season game (as they do on [[Sunday Night Baseball|Sunday nights]]), the local broadcaster of a game (such as a [[Fox Sports Networks|Fox Sports regional network]] for example) has priority over a national broadcaster\u2014so if [[Fox Sports 1]], [[MLB Network]], or [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] is airing a game that is also being aired by the local broadcaster, the national feed would be blacked out in markets where a local broadcaster is also showing coverage.<ref>{{cite web | last = Pasaan | first = Jeff | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Selig's Promise | work = Yahoo!

Typically, no other games involving U.S. teams are scheduled to occur at the same time. NHL Network and NBCSN typically broadcast non-exclusive national games outside these windows which are blacked out in the participating teams' markets to protect local broadcasts. All games in the first round of the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]], outside those designated for exclusive broadcast by NBC, are non-exclusive national games. Since [[2017 Stanley Cup playoffs|2017]], they may now co-exist with national broadcasts on [[NBCUniversal]] cable channels and NHL Network, except in some areas that have an NBCUniversal-owned regional sports network.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://nbcsportsgrouppressbox.com/2017/04/10/nbc-sports-groups-coverage-of-2017-stanley-cup-playoffs-begins-wednesday-night-with-five-games/|title=NBC Sports Group's Coverage of the 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs Begins Wednesday With Five Games|publisher=NBC Sports|date=April 10, 2017|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOut-of-market games can be viewed using the subscription-based [[MLB Extra Innings]], [[MLB.tv]], [[NHL Center Ice]], and [[NHL.tv]] services, although in-market games are blacked out from all four services to protect local broadcasters, and they do not offer nationally televised games.\n\n====Radio blackouts====\nIn Major League Baseball, there are no radio blackouts. However, for many years, the radio networks of the two participating ballclubs in the [[World Series]] were not allowed to air games, forcing [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship stations]], if they wanted to broadcast the Series, to simulcast the network broadcast.\n\nAs an example, while [[Boston Red Sox]] radio flagship [[WEEI (AM)|WHDH]] and [[St. Louis Cardinals]] flagship station [[KMOX]] both broadcast the [[1967 World Series]], both stations had to simulcast the [[NBC Radio Network]] broadcast along with Boston's [[WWDJ|WCOP]] and St. Louis's [[KTRS (AM)|KSD]], the nominal NBC Radio affiliates in those cities.\n\nThis changed after [[1980 World Series|1980]], as fans of the [[1980 Philadelphia Phillies|Philadelphia Phillies]] were angry that they could not hear their popular broadcasting team of [[Harry Kalas]] and [[Richie Ashburn]] call the team's run to the title. Since then, only the flagship stations of the two participating ballclubs can originate coverage, though their broadcasts, as well as the national English and Spanish broadcasts, are also available on [[Sirius XM]]. Flagship stations are required to make mention of the presenting sponsor of the national ESPN Radio broadcasts as also sponsoring the team's own broadcasts during the World Series (as of 2016 this is [[AutoZone]]). All other network affiliates of the two clubs must carry the feed from MLB's national partner (currently ESPN Radio). If another ESPN Radio affiliate exists in the same market, that station can claim exclusivity, forcing a blackout of the team network affiliate from carrying the game, though this is rarely done as listener pushback against the ESPN Radio affiliate blocking the local play-by-play would likely be untenable (for instance in [[2016 World Series|2016]], ESPN Radio O&O [[WMVP]] in [[Chicago]] broadcast the national ESPN feed as expected, but made no move to block the official [[2016 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]] broadcaster [[WSCR]] from carrying local play-by-play, to the point of only mentioning the national coverage existed on their station through promos in national ESPN Radio programming).\n\nAdditionally, radio stations (including flagships) may not include MLB games in the live [[Internet]] [[streaming media|streams]] of their station programming. MLB itself offers radio feeds as a pay service via the league and team websites, along with being a part of the monthly premium fee service from streaming provider [[TuneIn]]. Some stations will simply stream the station's regularly scheduled programming that is being pre-empted by the game.\n\nThe NHL has no radio blackouts for local broadcasts, although [[NBC Sports Radio]] broadcasts are, similarly to some cable broadcasts, not carried within the local markets of participating teams.\n\n===NBA blackout policy===\nPrior to the [[1998-99 NBA lockout]], the NBA and the WNBA used to black out nationally televised games on [[cable television]] within {{convert|35|mi|km}} of the home team's market; however, these are now restricted to games on [[NBA TV]], WatchESPN and other streaming providers.\n\n===NFL blackout policy===\n{{See also|National Football League television blackout policies}}\nThe NFL has engaged in various blackout policies to protect both local ticket sales, and local rightsholders of specific games.\n\n==== Blackouts based on attendance ====\nIn the NFL, any broadcaster that has a signal that hits any area within a {{convert|75|mi|km}} radius of an NFL [[stadium]] may only broadcast a game if that game is a road game (also known as an away game), or if the game sells out 72 hours or more before the start time for the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/ticket/faq|title=NFL Sunday Ticket FAQ;  Why does the NFL have blackouts?|publisher=NFL|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402115148/http://www.nfl.com/ticket/faq/#QUESTION4|archivedate=April 2, 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What are the NFL blackout rules for my home team?|url=https://support.directv.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/484|publisher=DirecTV|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}</ref>  If sold out in less than 72 hours, or is close to being sold out by the deadline, the team can sometimes request a time extension. Furthermore, broadcasters with NFL contracts are required to show their markets' road games, even if the [[secondary market]]s have substantial fanbases for other teams (like in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], officially a [[Baltimore Ravens]] secondary market, but home to many [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] fans{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}). Sometimes{{when|date=February 2016}} if a game is within a few hundred tickets of selling out, a broadcaster{{examples|date=February 2016}} with rights to show the nearly sold out game will buy the remaining tickets (and give them to local charities) so it can broadcast the game. Other teams elect to close off sections of their stadium, but cannot sell these tickets for any game that season if they choose to do so.<ref>{{cite news | last = Lomeli | first = Andrew | title = NFL blackout blunder | work = [[The Stanford Daily]] | date = 2006-10-10 | url = http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2006/10/10/nflBlackoutBlunder | accessdate = 2007-07-03 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20061023191517/http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2006/10/10/nflBlackoutBlunder|archivedate=October 23, 2006}}</ref> As a result, if the home team's game is a Sunday day game, both networks can air only one game each in that market (until 2000, this rule applied whether or not the game was blacked out; however, this was changed because some markets virtually never aired doubleheaders as a result). Usually, but not always, when each network can show only one game each in a market, the two stations work out between themselves which will show an early game and which will show a late game. This only affects the primary market, and not markets in a {{convert|75|mi|km|adj=on}} radius, which always get a doubleheader each Sunday. For the [[NFL International Series]], the network broadcasting an International Series game will not have the game blacked out for the team's markets as the game is played outside of the United States; however, some blackout regulations do apply.\n\nThere have been two exceptions to the rule, of which one has never been implemented and the other no longer applies. The first is for the [[Green Bay Packers]], which have two overlapping 75-mile blackout zones \u2013 one surrounding [[Lambeau Field|the team's stadium]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] and another surrounding [[Milwaukee]]. The team's [[WTMJ (AM)|radio flagship station]] is in Milwaukee, and the Packers played part of their home schedule in Milwaukee from 1953 through 1994. However, this policy has never been implemented in the Packers' case, as they have sold out every home game in Green Bay since 1960 and have a decades-long [[NFL season ticket waiting lists|season-ticket waiting list]] (games in Milwaukee also sold out during this period). The second exception was for the [[Bills Toronto Series]]; by a technicality, [[Rogers Communications]] (the team's lessee) owned all tickets to those games and resold them to potential fans. Even when Rogers failed to sell all of the tickets, they were still technically defined to be sellouts by the league since Rogers was said to have \"bought\" the tickets. The technicality came into play for both Toronto Series preseason games, and again for the last two regular season games of the series.<ref>{{cite web | title = Edwards leads Bills in win vs. Steelers | publisher = [[Associated Press]] | date = 2008-08-14 | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=280814002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=TV Interest in Bills Increases|publisher=Still Talkin' TV|date=2010-08-20|url=http://stilltalkintv.com/2010/08/tv-interest-in-bills-increases/|last=Pergament|first=Alan|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209175437/http://stilltalkintv.com/2010/08/tv-interest-in-bills-increases/|archivedate=2011-02-09}}</ref> The Bills Toronto Series was cancelled after the 2013 season, largely due to the aforementioned lackluster attendance.\n\nIn June 2012, NFL blackout regulations were revised in which, for the first time in NFL history, home games would no longer require a total sellout to be televised locally; instead, teams would  be allowed to set a benchmark anywhere from 85 to 100 percent of the stadium's non-premium seats.

The local market for these rights is defined as any station within the {{convert|75|mi|km|adj=on}} radius of a team's respective stadium.\n\nThis policy attracted controversy in December 2007, when [[Hartford, Connecticut]] [[CBS]] affiliate [[WFSB]] was refused permission to air the local simulcast of a [[2007 New England Patriots \u2013 New York Giants game|New England Patriots-New York Giants]] game on December 29, 2007. The game, which was part of the ''Thursday Night Football'' package on NFL Network, would see the Patriots attempt to become the first NFL team since 1972 and the expansion of the regular season to 16 games, to finish the regular season undefeated.

There are no radio blackouts, but only each team's flagship station can carry local broadcasts during the conference championships or [[Super Bowl]]. All other markets must carry the ''[[NFL on Westwood One]]'' feed for those games. For all other weeks, within 75 miles of a team's stadium, only stations the team or its flagship station contracts with can carry those games, regardless if the team is home or away. Thus, any competing station that carries Westwood One broadcasts cannot air those games. Like MLB, the NFL makes local broadcasts (except for those of the [[Tennessee Titans]]) available on NFL's Game Pass service and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]; as a result, radio stations that carry NFL games, from any source, and stream on the Internet are prohibited from streaming games online, although it seems this provision is loosely enforced in some cases; [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]] in Chicago regularly airs live broadcasts of Chicago Bears games over their Internet stream, as does [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ]] in Milwaukee with the Packers, though both stations went to a desktop-only streaming policy in 2015 due to the introduction of GamePass and the absorption of the [[NFL Audio Pass]] streaming system into Game Pass.\n\n===MLS===\nMajor League Soccer applies local blackout rights for the broadcasts of the following teams as a part of [[MLS Direct Kick]]:\n* [[Colorado Rapids]]\n* [[D.C. United]]\n* [[LA Galaxy]]\n* [[Los Angeles FC]]\n* [[New England Revolution]]\n* [[New York Red Bulls]]\n* [[New York City FC]]\n\n====Game availability====\nMLS Direct Kick contains [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] games originating from either a regional sports network (RSN) or a local over-the-air station and delivers these games to customers who purchase this subscription. These games are not otherwise available to DirecTV subscribers because they are broadcast outside a subscriber's local area. Further, MLS games shown nationally on [[ESPN]], [[ESPN2]], [[UniM\u00e1s]] and [[FOX Broadcasting Company|FOX]] are not included as part of this sports subscription.\n\n===Indianapolis 500===\nTo encourage local attendance, the live television broadcast of the [[Indianapolis 500]] is blacked out on the [[Indianapolis]] affiliate of its broadcaster (currently [[IndyCar Series on NBC|NBC]] station [[WTHR]], and previously [[IndyCar Series on ABC|ABC]] station [[WRTV]]) if the race is not a sell-out.
