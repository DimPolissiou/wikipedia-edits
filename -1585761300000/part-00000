{"title_page": "The Swingin\u2019 Pig Records", "text_new": "{{Notability|Music|date=March 2020}}\n'''The Swingin\u2019 Pig Records''' was a [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] [[record label|label]] that mostly released [[LP record|LP]]s and [[Single (music)|singles]], best known for unauthorized recordings of [[The Beatles]], [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[The Rolling Stones]]. The first publications were made in the early 1980s, when they released three singles and about twenty LPs.<ref>Owen Sound: Hot Wacks Book XV, page 785</ref> The label became one of the first to release bootleg [[Compact disc|CD]]s,<ref>Owen Sound: Hot Wacks Book XV, page 5</ref> the first to offer bootleg CDs in high-quality [[box set]]s.<ref>Owen Sound: Hot Wacks (Supplement 1), page 9</ref> A sublabel, Magic Dwarf Records, offered records from the Beatles and Rolling Stones in 1988.\n\nBy 1985, the label had its headquarters in [[Luxembourg]] and distributed its recordings from Germany via the small record label Perfect Beat Tontr\u00e4ger, in [[Brakel]]. By the 1990s, [[GEMA (German organization)|GEMA]] fees were paid, artists were unable to collect because in some European countries the rights for the artists had expired after 20 or 25 years.<ref>Owen Sound: Hot Wacks (Supplement 5), page 23</ref> The label disappeared from the market in the mid-1990s, around the time [[WIPO]] became law. Remaining stocks were processed through Soundhouse Music.\n\nThe LP / CD Box Atlantic City '89 was the label's most popular release, a digital recording of a live concert by the Rolling Stones over satellite broadcast. The band tried to ban the publication several times; in 1991 there were several court hearings before the regional court in [[Hamburg]], with distribution was banned for a short time. On March 22, 1991, the regional court lifted the ban. At over 70,000 copies, it may be the best-selling bootleg in the world.<ref>Owen Sound: Hot Wacks (Supplement 5), page 24</ref>\n\nA total of around 250 CDs and 150 LPs were released, as well as three singles and two shape vinyls from the Rolling Stones. A few legitimate authorized [[promo recording]]s were released. Most of the LPs were also made on limited-edition colored vinyl.\n\nThe following list is an overview of known releases, including the first bootlegs and special pressings. The Swingin 'Pig Records discontinued production with TSP 223\u20132; any records beyond this are [[Counterfeit|fake]]s, mostly from Thailand, banking on the name recognition.\n\nDue to the legal situation at the time, artists from countries that did not sign the Rome Agreement were only granted the rights that German artists had in the respective country (principle of reciprocity). In the early 1990s several court cases ruled the unauthorized releases legal. Today, reselling may not be.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/verkauf-alter-cds-iron-maiden-laesst-fans-abmahnen-a-645571.html ''Verkauf alter CDs: Iron Maiden l\u00e4sst Fans

The first publications were made in the early 1980s, when they released three singles and about twenty LPs.<ref>Owen Sound: Hot Wacks Book XV, page 785</ref> The label became one of the first to release bootleg [[Compact disc|CD]]s,<ref>Owen Sound: Hot Wacks Book XV, page 5</ref> the first to offer bootleg CDs in high-quality [[box set]]s.<ref>Owen Sound: Hot Wacks (Supplement 1), page 9</ref> A sublabel, Magic Dwarf Records, offered records from the Beatles and Rolling Stones in 1988.\n\nBy 1985, the label had its headquarters in [[Luxembourg]] and distributed its recordings from Germany via the small record label Perfect Beat Tontr\u00e4ger, in [[Brakel]]. By the 1990s, [[GEMA]] fees were paid, artists were unable to collect because in some European countries the rights for the artists had expired after 20 or 25 years.<ref>Owen Sound: Hot Wacks (Supplement 5), page 23</ref> The label disappeared from the market in the mid-1990s, around the time [[WIPO]] became law. Remaining stocks were processed through Soundhouse Music.\n\nThe LP / CD Box Atlantic City '89 was the label's most popular release, a digital recording of a live concert by the Rolling Stones over satellite broadcast. The band tried to ban the publication several times; in 1991 there were several court hearings before the regional court in [[Hamburg]], with distribution was banned for a short time. On March 22, 1991, the regional court lifted the ban. At over 70,000 copies, it may be the best-selling bootleg in the world.<ref>Owen Sound: Hot Wacks (Supplement 5), page 24</ref>\n\nA total of around 250 CDs and 150 LPs were released, as well as three singles and two shape vinyls from the Rolling Stones. A few legitimate authorized [[promo recording]]s were released. Most of the LPs were also made on limited-edition colored vinyl.\n\nThe following list is an overview of known releases, including the first bootlegs and special pressings. The Swingin 'Pig Records discontinued production with TSP 223\u20132; any records beyond this are [[Counterfeit|fake]]s, mostly from Thailand, banking on the name recognition.\n\nDue to the legal situation at the time, artists from countries that did not sign the Rome Agreement were only granted the rights that German artists had in the respective country (principle of reciprocity). In the early 1990s several court cases ruled the unauthorized releases legal.

The myth of Izanagi's journey into Yomi features many themes of food, he creates grapes to distract the shikome who stop to eat them, granting him time to escape.

Lawson]], a geology graduate student from the [[Jackson School of Geosciences]] at the University of Texas at Austin. The specimen consisted of a partial wing (in pterosaurs composed of the forearms and elongated fourth finger), from an individual later estimated at over {{cvt|10|m}} in [[wingspan]].<ref name=\"witton&naish2008\"/>\n\nLawson discovered a second site of the same age, about {{cvt|40|km}} from the first, where between 1972 and 1974 he and Professor [[Wann Langston Jr.]] of the [[Texas Memorial Museum]] unearthed three fragmentary skeletons of much smaller individuals. Lawson in 1975 announced the find in an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.<ref name=\"lawson1975\"/> That same year, in a subsequent letter to the same journal, he made the original large specimen, TMM 41450-3, the [[holotype]] of a new genus and species, '''''Quetzalcoatlus northropi'''''. The genus name refers to the [[Aztecs|Aztec]] feathered serpent god, [[Quetzalcoatl]]. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] honors [[Jack Northrop|John Knudsen Northrop]], the founder of [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]], who drove the development of large tailless [[flying wing]] aircraft designs resembling ''Quetzalcoatlus''.<ref name=\"lawson1975b\"/>\n\n[[Image:Quetzalcoatlus sp.jpg|upright|thumb|Skeletal reconstruction of ''Q.'' sp.]]\nAt first it was assumed that the smaller specimens were juvenile or subadult forms of the larger type. Later, when more remains were found, it was realized they could have been a separate species. This possible second species from Texas was provisionally referred to as a ''Quetzalcoatlus'' sp. by [[Alexander Kellner]] and Langston in 1996, indicating that its status was too uncertain to give it a full new species name.<ref name=\"kellner&langston1996\"/> The smaller specimens are more complete than the ''Q. northropi'' holotype, and include four partial skulls, though they are much less massive, with an estimated wingspan of {{cvt|5.5|m}}.<ref name=\"buffetautetal2002\"/>\n\nThe holotype specimen of ''Q. northropi'' has yet to be properly described and diagnosed, and the current status of the genus ''Quetzalcoatlus'' has been identified as problematic. [[Mark Witton]] and colleagues (2010) noted that the type species of the genus\u2014the fragmentary wing bones comprising ''Q. northropi''\u2014represent elements which are typically considered undiagnostic to generic or specific level, and that this complicates interpretations of azhdarchid taxonomy. For instance, Witton et al. (2010) suggested that the ''Q. northropi'' type material is of generalised enough morphology to be near identical to that of other giant azhdarchids, such as the overlapping elements of the contemporary [[Romania]]n giant azhdarchid'' [[Hatzegopteryx]]''. This being the case, and assuming ''Q. northropi'' can be distinguished from other pterosaurs (i.e., if it is not a ''[[nomen dubium]]''), perhaps ''Hatzegopteryx'' should be regarded as a European occurrence of ''Quetzalcoatlus''. However, Witton ''et al.'' also noted that the skull material of ''Hatzegopteryx'' and ''Q.'' sp. differ enough that they cannot be regarded as the same animal, but that the significance of this cannot be ascertained given uncertainty over the relationships of ''Quetzalcoatlus'' specimens.<ref name=witton2010/> These issues can only be resolved by ''Q. northropi'' being demonstrated as a valid taxon and its relationships with ''Q''. sp. being investigated. An additional complication to these discussions are the likelihood that huge pterosaurs such as ''Q. northropi'' could have made long, transcontinental flights, suggesting that locations as disparate as North America and Europe could have shared giant azhdarchid species.<ref name=witton2010>Witton, M.P., Martill, D.M. and Loveridge, R.F.

The specimen (BMR P2002.2) was recovered accidentally when it was included in a field jacket prepared to transport part of a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' specimen. Despite this association with the remains of a large carnivorous [[dinosaur]], the vertebra shows no evidence that it was chewed on by the dinosaur.

Because the area of the fossil site was four hundred kilometers removed from the coastline and there were no indications of large rivers or deep lakes nearby at the end of the Cretaceous, Lawson in 1975 rejected a [[piscivore|fish-eating]] lifestyle, instead suggesting that ''Quetzalcoatlus'' scavenged like the [[marabou stork]] (which will scavenge, but is more of a terrestrial predator of small animals), but then on the carcasses of [[titanosaur]] [[Sauropoda|sauropods]] such as ''[[Alamosaurus]]''. Lawson had found the remains of the giant pterosaur while searching for the bones of this dinosaur, which formed an important part of its ecosystem.\n\nIn 1996, Lehman and Langston rejected the scavenging hypothesis, pointing out that the lower jaw bent so strongly downwards that even when it closed completely a gap of over five centimeters remained between it and the upper jaw, very different from the hooked beaks of specialized scavenging birds. They suggested that with its long neck [[vertebra]]e and long toothless jaws ''Quetzalcoatlus'' fed like modern-day [[Skimmer (bird)|skimmer]]s, catching fish during flight while cleaving the waves with its beak.<ref name=\"lehman&langston1996\"/> While this skim-feeding view became widely accepted, it was not subjected to scientific research until 2007 when a study showed that for such large pterosaurs it was not a viable method because the energy costs would be too high due to excessive [[Drag (physics)|drag]].<ref name=\"humphriesetal2007\"/> In 2008 pterosaur workers Mark Witton and [[Darren Naish]] published an examination of possible feeding habits and ecology of azhdarchids. Witton and Naish noted that most azhdarchid remains are found in inland deposits far from seas or other large bodies of water required for skimming. Additionally, the beak, jaw, and neck anatomy are unlike those of any known skimming animal. Rather, they concluded that azhdarchids were more likely terrestrial stalkers, similar to modern [[stork]]s, and probably hunted small vertebrates on land or in small streams. Though ''Quetzalcoatlus'', like other pterosaurs, was a quadruped when on the ground, ''Quetzalcoatlus'' and other azhdarchids have fore and hind limb proportions more similar to modern running [[ungulate]] mammals than to their smaller cousins, implying that they were uniquely suited to a terrestrial lifestyle.<ref name=\"witton&naish2008\"/>\n\n===Flight===\n[[Image:Quetzalcoatlus07.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's impression of an individual in flight.]]\nThe nature of flight in ''Quetzalcoatlus'' and other giant azhdarchids was poorly understood until serious biomechanical studies were conducted in the 21st century. One early (1984) experiment by [[Paul MacCready]] used practical aerodynamics to test the flight of ''Quetzalcoatlus''. MacCready constructed a model flying machine or [[ornithopter]] with a simple computer functioning as an [[autopilot]]. The model successfully flew with a combination of soaring and wing flapping;<ref name=maccready1985>{{cite journal| last= MacCready| first= P.| year= 1985| url= http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/596/02/MacCready.pdf| title= The Great Pterodactyl Project| journal= Engineering & Science, California Institute of Technology| volume= 49| number= 2| pages= 18\u201324}}</ref> the model was based on a then-current weight estimate of around {{cvt|80|kg}}, far lower than more modern estimates of over {{cvt|200|kg}}.<ref name=\"henderson2010\"/> The method of flight in these pterosaurs depends largely on weight, which has been controversial, and widely differing masses have been favored by different scientists. Some researchers have suggested that these animals employed slow, [[Lift (soaring)|soaring]] flight, while others have concluded that their flight was fast and dynamic.<ref name=\"witton&naish2008\"/> In 2010, Donald Henderson argued that the mass of ''Q. northropi'' had been underestimated, even the highest estimates, and that it was too massive to have achieved powered flight. He estimated it in his 2010 paper as {{cvt|540|kg}}. Henderson argued that it may have been [[Flightless bird|flightless]].<ref name=\"henderson2010\"/>\n[[Image:QuetzalcoatlusROM.JPG|thumb|Reconstructed skeleton at the [[Royal Ontario Museum]].]]\nOther flight capability estimates have disagreed with Henderson's research, suggesting instead an animal superbly adapted to long-range, extended flight. In 2010, Mike Habib, a professor of biomechanics at Chatham University, and Mark Witton, a British paleontologist, undertook further investigation into the claims of flightlessness in large pterosaurs. After factoring wingspan, body weight, and aerodynamics, computer modelling led the two researchers to conclude that ''Q. northropi'' was capable of flight up to {{cvt|80|mph|order=flip}} for 7 to 10 days at altitudes of {{cvt|15000|ft|order=flip}}. Habib further suggested a maximum flight range of {{cvt|8,000|\u2013|12,000|mi|order=flip}} for ''Q. northropi''.<ref name=npr2010>{{cite web| last= Frazier| first= Reid| title= Peerless Pterosaur Could Fly Long-Distance For Days |url=https://www.npr.org/2010/11/16/131362653/peerless-pterosaur-could-fly-long-distance-for-days|work= [[Morning Edition]]| publisher=NPR | date= November 22, 2010| access-date= November 1, 2017}}</ref> Henderson's work was also further criticized by Witton and Habib in another study, which pointed out that although Henderson used excellent mass estimations, they were based on outdated pterosaur models, which caused Henderson's mass estimations to be more than double what Habib used in his estimations, and that anatomical study of ''Q. northropi'' and other big pterosaur forelimbs showed a higher degree of robustness than would be expected if they were purely quadrupedal.<ref name=\"wittonweight2010\"/> This study proposed that large pterosaurs most likely utilized a short burst of powered flight to then transition to [[Gliding|thermal soaring]].\n\n==Cultural significance==\n[[Image:Pterosaurs on South Bank.jpg|thumb|Models on London's [[South Bank]] for the [[Royal Society]]'s 350th anniversary exhibition.]]\nIn June 2010, several life-sized models of ''Q. northropi'' were put on display on London's [[South Bank]] as the centerpiece exhibit for the [[Royal Society]]'s 350th-anniversary exhibition. The models, which included both flying and standing individuals with wingspans of {{cvt|9|m|0}}, were intended to help build public interest in science.

Lawson]], a geology graduate student from the [[Jackson School of Geosciences]] at the University of Texas at Austin. The specimen consisted of a partial wing (in pterosaurs composed of the forearms and elongated fourth finger), from an individual later estimated at over {{cvt|10|m}} in [[wingspan]].<ref name=\"witton&naish2008\"/>\n\nLawson discovered a second site of the same age, about {{cvt|40|km}} from the first, where between 1972 and 1974 he and Professor [[Wann Langston Jr.]] of the [[Texas Memorial Museum]] unearthed three fragmentary skeletons of much smaller individuals. Lawson in 1975 announced the find in an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.<ref name=\"lawson1975\"/> That same year, in a subsequent letter to the same journal, he made the original large specimen, TMM 41450-3, the [[holotype]] of a new genus and species, '''''Quetzalcoatlus northropi'''''. The genus name refers to the [[Aztecs|Aztec]] feathered serpent god, [[Quetzalcoatl]]. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] honors [[Jack Northrop|John Knudsen Northrop]], the founder of [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]], who drove the development of large tailless [[flying wing]] aircraft designs resembling ''Quetzalcoatlus''.<ref name=\"lawson1975b\"/>\n\n[[Image:Quetzalcoatlus sp.jpg|upright|thumb|Skeletal reconstruction of ''Q.'' sp.]]\nAt first it was assumed that the smaller specimens were juvenile or subadult forms of the larger type. Later, when more remains were found, it was realized they could have been a separate species. This possible second species from Texas was provisionally referred to as a ''Quetzalcoatlus'' sp. by [[Alexander Kellner]] and Langston in 1996, indicating that its status was too uncertain to give it a full new species name.<ref name=\"kellner&langston1996\"/> The smaller specimens are more complete than the ''Q. northropi'' holotype, and include four partial skulls, though they are much less massive, with an estimated wingspan of {{cvt|5.5|m}}.<ref name=\"buffetautetal2002\"/>\n\nThe holotype specimen of ''Q. northropi'' has yet to be properly described and diagnosed, and the current status of the genus ''Quetzalcoatlus'' has been identified as problematic. [[Mark Witton]] and colleagues (2010) noted that the type species of the genus\u2014the fragmentary wing bones comprising ''Q. northropi''\u2014represent elements which are typically considered undiagnostic to generic or specific level, and that this complicates interpretations of azhdarchid taxonomy. For instance, Witton et al. (2010) suggested that the ''Q. northropi'' type material is of generalised enough morphology to be near identical to that of other giant azhdarchids, such as the overlapping elements of the contemporary [[Romania]]n giant azhdarchid'' [[Hatzegopteryx]]''. This being the case, and assuming ''Q. northropi'' can be distinguished from other pterosaurs (i.e., if it is not a ''[[nomen dubium]]''), perhaps ''Hatzegopteryx'' should be regarded as a European occurrence of ''Quetzalcoatlus''. However, Witton ''et al.'' also noted that the skull material of ''Hatzegopteryx'' and ''Q.'' sp. differ enough that they cannot be regarded as the same animal, but that the significance of this cannot be ascertained given uncertainty over the relationships of ''Quetzalcoatlus'' specimens.<ref name=witton2010/> These issues can only be resolved by ''Q. northropi'' being demonstrated as a valid taxon and its relationships with ''Q''. sp. being investigated. An additional complication to these discussions are the likelihood that huge pterosaurs such as ''Q. northropi'' could have made long, transcontinental flights, suggesting that locations as disparate as North America and Europe could have shared giant azhdarchid species.<ref name=witton2010>Witton, M.P., Martill, D.M. and Loveridge, R.F.

The specimen (BMR P2002.2) was recovered accidentally when it was included in a field jacket prepared to transport part of a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' specimen. Despite this association with the remains of a large carnivorous [[dinosaur]], the vertebra shows no evidence that it was chewed on by the dinosaur.

Because the area of the fossil site was four hundred kilometers removed from the coastline and there were no indications of large rivers or deep lakes nearby at the end of the Cretaceous, Lawson in 1975 rejected a [[piscivore|fish-eating]] lifestyle, instead suggesting that ''Quetzalcoatlus'' scavenged like the [[marabou stork]] (which will scavenge, but is more of a terrestrial predator of small animals), but then on the carcasses of [[titanosaur]] [[Sauropoda|sauropods]] such as ''[[Alamosaurus]]''. Lawson had found the remains of the giant pterosaur while searching for the bones of this dinosaur, which formed an important part of its ecosystem.\n\nIn 1996, Lehman and Langston rejected the scavenging hypothesis, pointing out that the lower jaw bent so strongly downwards that even when it closed completely a gap of over five centimeters remained between it and the upper jaw, very different from the hooked beaks of specialized scavenging birds. They suggested that with its long neck [[vertebra]]e and long toothless jaws ''Quetzalcoatlus'' fed like modern-day [[Skimmer (bird)|skimmer]]s, catching fish during flight while cleaving the waves with its beak.<ref name=\"lehman&langston1996\"/> While this skim-feeding view became widely accepted, it was not subjected to scientific research until 2007 when a study showed that for such large pterosaurs it was not a viable method because the energy costs would be too high due to excessive [[Drag (physics)|drag]].<ref name=\"humphriesetal2007\"/> In 2008 pterosaur workers Mark Witton and [[Darren Naish]] published an examination of possible feeding habits and ecology of azhdarchids. Witton and Naish noted that most azhdarchid remains are found in inland deposits far from seas or other large bodies of water required for skimming. Additionally, the beak, jaw, and neck anatomy are unlike those of any known skimming animal. Rather, they concluded that azhdarchids were more likely terrestrial stalkers, similar to modern [[stork]]s, and probably hunted small vertebrates on land or in small streams. Though ''Quetzalcoatlus'', like other pterosaurs, was a quadruped when on the ground, ''Quetzalcoatlus'' and other azhdarchids have fore and hind limb proportions more similar to modern running [[ungulate]] mammals than to their smaller cousins, implying that they were uniquely suited to a terrestrial lifestyle.<ref name=\"witton&naish2008\"/>\n\n===Flight===\n[[Image:Quetzalcoatlus07.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's impression of an individual in flight.]]\nThe nature of flight in ''Quetzalcoatlus'' and other giant azhdarchids was poorly understood until serious biomechanical studies were conducted in the 21st century. One early (1984) experiment by [[Paul MacCready]] used practical aerodynamics to test the flight of ''Quetzalcoatlus''. MacCready constructed a model flying machine or [[ornithopter]] with a simple computer functioning as an [[autopilot]]. The model successfully flew with a combination of soaring and wing flapping;<ref name=maccready1985>{{cite journal| last= MacCready| first= P.| year= 1985| url= http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/596/02/MacCready.pdf| title= The Great Pterodactyl Project| journal= Engineering & Science, California Institute of Technology| volume= 49| number= 2| pages= 18\u201324}}</ref> the model was based on a then-current weight estimate of around {{cvt|80|kg}}, far lower than more modern estimates of over {{cvt|200|kg}}.<ref name=\"henderson2010\"/> The method of flight in these pterosaurs depends largely on weight, which has been controversial, and widely differing masses have been favored by different scientists. Some researchers have suggested that these animals employed slow, [[Lift (soaring)|soaring]] flight, while others have concluded that their flight was fast and dynamic.<ref name=\"witton&naish2008\"/> In 2010, Donald Henderson argued that the mass of ''Q. northropi'' had been underestimated, even the highest estimates, and that it was too massive to have achieved powered flight. He estimated it in his 2010 paper as {{cvt|540|kg}}. Henderson argued that it may have been [[Flightless bird|flightless]].<ref name=\"henderson2010\"/>\n[[Image:QuetzalcoatlusROM.JPG|thumb|Reconstructed skeleton at the [[Royal Ontario Museum]].]]\nOther flight capability estimates have disagreed with Henderson's research, suggesting instead an animal superbly adapted to long-range, extended flight. In 2010, Mike Habib, a professor of biomechanics at Chatham University, and Mark Witton, a British paleontologist, undertook further investigation into the claims of flightlessness in large pterosaurs. After factoring wingspan, body weight, and aerodynamics, computer modelling led the two researchers to conclude that ''Q. northropi'' was capable of flight up to {{cvt|80|mph|order=flip}} for 7 to 10 days at altitudes of {{cvt|15000|ft|order=flip}}. Habib further suggested a maximum flight range of {{cvt|8,000|\u2013|12,000|mi|order=flip}} for ''Q. northropi''.<ref name=npr2010>{{cite web| last= Frazier| first= Reid| title= Peerless Pterosaur Could Fly Long-Distance For Days |url=https://www.npr.org/2010/11/16/131362653/peerless-pterosaur-could-fly-long-distance-for-days|work= [[Morning Edition]]| publisher=NPR | date= November 22, 2010| access-date= November 1, 2017}}</ref> Henderson's work was also further criticized by Witton and Habib in another study, which pointed out that although Henderson used excellent mass estimations, they were based on outdated pterosaur models, which caused Henderson's mass estimations to be more than double what Habib used in his estimations, and that anatomical study of ''Q. northropi'' and other big pterosaur forelimbs showed a higher degree of robustness than would be expected if they were purely quadrupedal.<ref name=\"wittonweight2010\"/> This study proposed that large pterosaurs most likely utilized a short burst of powered flight to then transition to [[Gliding|thermal soaring]].\n\n==Cultural significance==\n[[Image:Pterosaurs on South Bank.jpg|thumb|Models on London's [[South Bank]] for the [[Royal Society]]'s 350th anniversary exhibition.]]\nIn June 2010, several life-sized models of ''Q. northropi'' were put on display on London's [[South Bank]] as the centerpiece exhibit for the [[Royal Society]]'s 350th-anniversary exhibition. The models, which included both flying and standing individuals with wingspans of {{cvt|9|m|0}}, were intended to help build public interest in science.
