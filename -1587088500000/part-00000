Athea has a church, and the town is the centre for the Catholic parish of Athea, encompassing several townlands.\nNotable residents include Singer Rihanna O\u2019Flaherty, second cousin of Tommy, known for works such as diamonds and S&M.\n\n==History==\nThe community was dependent on agriculture and a [[creamery]] was built near the river which acted as the centrepoint for local trade. A primary school was built near the creamary to cope with the rising younger population. Over time, cottages and workshops lined the main road to create the village of Athea. New local roads were built to neighbouring [[Moyvane]] and off the main [[Listowel]]-[[Limerick]] and Glin-Abbeyfeale roads. The river was the primary water source as well as its use for drainage.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe Catholic population were forbidden to practise their faith under [[Penal Laws]], and the first church wasn't built in Athea until the early 19th century. Prior to this locals congregated each Sunday at a [[Mass rock]] to the east of the village.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Galey River, Athea, Co.

The name is derived from the [[Irish language]] ''\"Abhainn na G\u00e1ile\"'', River of the Gaille, a tribe who lived along its banks. In times of heavy rain, especially in winter, the river swells up over its banks causing floods which can last for days.{{fact|date=July 2019}} There are two bridges across the river; the R523/R524 intersection bridge just east of the village and ''Barry's Bridge'', 2&nbsp;km northwest of the village.\n\n===Climate===\nAthea has a mild climate, the average daily maximum temperature in July is 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F) and the average daily minimum in January is 4&nbsp;\u00b0C (39&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Athea, Co.

Athea has a church, and the town is the centre for the Catholic parish of Athea, encompassing several townlands.\n\n==History==\nThe community was dependent on agriculture and a [[creamery]] was built near the river which acted as the centrepoint for local trade. A primary school was built near the creamary to cope with the rising younger population. Over time, cottages and workshops lined the main road to create the village of Athea. New local roads were built to neighbouring [[Moyvane]] and off the main [[Listowel]]-[[Limerick]] and Glin-Abbeyfeale roads. The river was the primary water source as well as its use for drainage.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe Catholic population were forbidden to practise their faith under [[Penal Laws]], and the first church wasn't built in Athea until the early 19th century. Prior to this locals congregated each Sunday at a [[Mass rock]] to the east of the village.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Galey River, Athea, Co. Limerick (geograph 3469400).jpg|thumb|River Galey as seen from the John Paul II footbridge in Athea's village centre]]\n===Topography===\nAthea is situated on the river Galey and the crossroads of the R523 (Reens - Listowel) and R524 (Glin - [[Abbeyfeale]]) [[Regional road (Ireland)|regional road]]s. It is a 3&nbsp;km east of the Limerick/Kerry border in the hills of west Limerick and is one of the highest settlements in the county.{{fact|date=July 2019}} Its highest point is in the Parkanna townland where, at 220&nbsp;m above sea level, surrounding towns and counties can be seen.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe river Galey is a tributary to the larger [[River Feale]]. The name is derived from the [[Irish language]] ''\"Abhainn na G\u00e1ile\"'', River of the Gaille, a tribe who lived along its banks. In times of heavy rain, especially in winter, the river swells up over its banks causing floods which can last for days.{{fact|date=July 2019}} There are two bridges across the river; the R523/R524 intersection bridge just east of the village and ''Barry's Bridge'', 2&nbsp;km northwest of the village.\n\n===Climate===\nAthea has a mild climate, the average daily maximum temperature in July is 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F) and the average daily minimum in January is 4&nbsp;\u00b0C (39&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Athea, Co.

The bridge is 2m wide and 11m long. It was commissioned by Athea Community Council Ltd. who have raised \u20ac260,000. The debt was reduced to \u20ac27,000 by the \"Lucky Numbers\" drawings, held Saturday nights.<ref>http://www.lcc.ie/NR/rdonlyres/30B70CF0-AC68-474A-831A-D13B242B18AE/0/MicrosoftWordDraftVDS_Pages113_231106.pdf</ref>\n\n===St. Bartholomew's Church===\nSt. Bartholomew's Roman Catholic Church is located on the main street and was built in 1832.

It is located in the [[Cono Sur]] area of the city of [[Lima]].\n\nOfficially established as a district on January 12, 1965, the current [[mayor]] (''[[alcalde]]'') of San Juan de Miraflores is Cristina Nina Garnica. The district's [[postal code]] is '''29'''.\n\nSan Juan de Miraflores is one of the pueblos nuevos, or new towns, that have been formed by the massive numbers of people moving from other towns of Metropolitan Lima (such as Miraflores, Surquillo, La Victoria, among others) and from the countryside. During the early 1960s, SJM was mostly a desert area.\n\nSJM is divided into zones (\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", and \"K\"). In the early 80's, people from [[Cusco Region|Cuzco]], [[Ayacucho Region|Ayacucho]], [[Pasco Region|Pasco]], and many of the other departments that were under the attack of terrorists chose SJM and [[Villa El Salvador]] as their new home. As new residents were coming into SJM, two new zones were created: Pamplona Alta and Pamplona Baja. This name was taken in honor of some of the Spanish missionaries (who were from Pamplona, Spain) who offered their help to the residents. One of Pamplona Alta's mains streets, \"Pista Nueva\" or \"New Street\", is an example of how new the area is. When it was first settled, many people lived without electricity, water or plumbing, often building their houses from [[reed mat (plastering)|reed mats]] into the steep hills, with treacherous paths leading to the houses at the top. As residents could afford building materials, they would begin to reinforce these reed mats with plywood, bricks, or whatever else they could find.\n\nToday the houses are a hodgepodge of building materials, most in a state of continual construction as residents can afford each additional brick. Most have access to electricity, but many still lack running water or plumbing. In just the last couple of years the mayor of Lima has launched an extremely successful program to build concrete staircases, or \"escapers\", into the hillsides, replacing the treacherous paths and dramatically improving the living conditions of residents. These staircases are distinctively painted yellow, with bright blue signs, and neighborhood residents are hired by the city to build them.\n\nIn addition to these new zones, 2 more were created. By the year 1981, America and Umamarca were created. Usually, these new zones are well known because of its highly interest of being better every day, since most of the owners are the people who worked most of their lives (and still do) in Ciudad de Dios' Market. These areas were urbanized quickly.\n\nBy 1983 and 1984, two new more zones had been created - Maria Auxiliadora and Amauta (\"teacher\" in English), located between zones \"A\" and \"B\". One of the main streets of Maria Auxiliadora is Pedro Miotta, which was well known as the former Panamericana Sur freeway.\n\nWithin Lima, particularly in [[Public transport in Lima|public transportation]] terms, \"San Juan\" generally refers to San Juan de Miraflores; [[San Juan de Lurigancho]], which is north of the [[R\u00edmac River]] and is of larger size, is denoted by its individual sections, such as Z\u00e1rate, Campoy, Mangomarca, Canto Grande, etc.\n\n==Geography==\nThe district has a total land [[area]] of 23.98&nbsp;km\u00b2.

It was preceded by the [[Sui dynasty]] and followed by the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] in Chinese history. Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization, and a [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of cosmopolitan culture.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p= 1}} Tang territory, acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers, rivaled that of the [[Han dynasty]]. The Tang capital at [[Chang'an]] (present-day [[Xi'an]]) was the most populous city in the world in its day.\n\nThe [[House of Li|L\u01d0 family]] ({{Lang-zh|c=\u674e|s=|t=|labels=no}}) founded the dynasty, seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire. The dynasty was interrupted for 15 years when Empress [[Wu Zetian]] seized the throne, proclaiming the [[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Wu Zhou dynasty]] and becoming the only legitimate Chinese [[empress regnant]]. In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries, the Tang records estimated the population by number of registered households at about 50 million people.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p= 91}}{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|pp= 111, 141}}  Yet, even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century, it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people.{{sfn|Du|1998|p= 37}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p= 106}}{{efn|During the rule of the Tang the world population grew from about 190 million to approximately 240&nbsp;million, a difference of 50&nbsp;million. See also [[medieval demography]].}}  With its large population base, the dynasty was able to raise professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers in dominating [[Inner Asia]] and the lucrative trade-routes along the [[Silk Road]].  [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|Various kingdoms and states paid tribute]] to the Tang court, while the Tang also conquered or subdued several regions which it indirectly controlled through a [[protectorate]] system.  Besides political [[hegemony]], the Tang also exerted a powerful cultural influence over neighboring [[East Asia]]n states such as those in [[History of Japan#Classical Japan|Japan]] and [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Korea]].\n\nThe Tang dynasty was largely a period of progress and stability in the first half of the dynasty's rule, until the devastating [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (755\u2013763) and the decline of central authority in the later half of the dynasty. Like the previous [[Sui dynasty]], the Tang dynasty maintained a civil-service system by recruiting [[scholar-official]]s through [[Imperial examination|standardized examinations]] and recommendations to office.  The rise of regional military governors known as ''[[jiedushi]]'' during the 9th century undermined this civil order.  [[Chinese culture]] flourished and further matured during the Tang era; it is traditionally considered the greatest age for [[Chinese poetry]].{{sfn|Yu|1998|pp= 73\u201387}}  Two of China's most famous poets, [[Li Bai]] and [[Du Fu]], belonged to this age, as did many famous painters such as [[Han Gan]], [[Zhang Xuan]], and [[Zhou Fang (Tang dynasty)|Zhou Fang]].  Scholars of this period compiled a rich variety of [[Chinese historiography|historical literature]], as well as encyclopedias and geographical works. The adoption of the title [[Khan of Heaven]] by the Tang emperor [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Taizong]] in addition to his title as [[Emperor of China|emperor]] was eastern Asia's first \"simultaneous kingship\".{{sfn|Skaff|2012|p= 127}}\n\nMany notable innovations occurred under the Tang, including the development of [[woodblock printing]]. [[Buddhism]] became a major influence in Chinese culture, with [[Chinese Buddhism|native Chinese sects]] gaining prominence. However, in the 840s the [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang]] [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|enacted policies to persecute Buddhism]], which subsequently declined in influence. The dynasty and central government had gone into decline by the latter half of the 9th century; agrarian rebellions resulted in damaging atrocities such as the [[Guangzhou massacre]] of 878\u2013879.

[[An Lushan]] was a half-[[Sogdiana|Sogdian]], half-[[Turkic peoples|Turk]] Tang commander since 744, had experience fighting the [[Khitan people|Khitans]] of [[Manchuria]] with a victory in 744,{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}}{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=184}} yet most of his campaigns against the Khitans were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Xu|1993|pp=455\u2013467}} He was given great responsibility in [[Hebei]], which allowed him to rebel with an army of more than 100,000 troops.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}} After capturing Luoyang, he named himself emperor of a new, but short-lived, [[Yan (Anshi)|Yan state]].{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=184}} Despite early victories scored by Tang General [[Guo Ziyi]] (697\u2013781), the newly recruited troops of the army at the capital were no match for An Lushan's frontier veterans, so the court fled Chang'an.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}} While the heir apparent raised troops in [[Shanxi]] and Xuanzong fled to [[Sichuan]] province, they called upon the help of the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] in 756.{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=185}} The [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] khan [[Bayanchur Khan|Moyanchur]] was greatly excited at this prospect, and married his own daughter to the Chinese diplomatic envoy once he arrived, receiving in turn a Chinese princess as his bride.{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=185}} [[History of the Uyghur people|The Uyghurs]] helped recapture the Tang capital from the rebels, but they refused to leave until the Tang paid them an enormous sum of tribute in silk.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}}{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=185}} Even [[Abbasid caliphate|Abbasid Arabs]] assisted the Tang in putting down An Lushan's rebellion.{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=185}}{{sfn|Schafer|1985|p=9}} The [[Tibet]]ans took hold of the opportunity and raided many areas under Chinese control, and even after the [[Tibetan Empire]] had fallen apart in 842 (and [[Kingdom of Qocho|the Uyghurs soon after]]) the Tang were in no position to [[Protectorate General to Pacify the West|reconquer Central Asia]] after 763.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}}{{sfn|Sen|2003|p=34}} So significant was this loss that half a century later ''jinshi'' examination candidates were required to write an essay on the causes of the Tang's decline.{{sfn|Gascoigne|Gascoigne|2003|p=97}} Although An Lushan was killed by one of his eunuchs in 757,{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=185}} this time of troubles and widespread insurrection continued until rebel [[Shi Siming]] was killed by his own son in 763.{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=185}}\n\n[[File:Leshan Buddha Statue View.JPG|thumb|The [[Leshan Giant Buddha]], {{convert|71|m|ft|abbr=on}} high; begun in 713, completed in 803]]\n\n[[File:Nanchan Temple 1.JPG|thumb|[[Nanchan Temple (Wutai)]], built during the late 8th century]]\n\nOne of the legacies that the Tang government left since 710 was the gradual rise of regional military governors, the [[jiedushi]], who slowly came to challenge the power of the central government.{{sfn|Wang|2003|p=91}} After the An Lushan Rebellion, the autonomous power and authority accumulated by the jiedushi in Hebei went beyond the central government's control. After a series of rebellions between 781 and 784 in today's Hebei, [[Shandong]], Hubei and [[Henan]] provinces, the government had to officially acknowledge the jiedushi's hereditary ruling without accreditation. The Tang government relied on these governors and their armies for protection and to suppress locals that would take up arms against the government. In return, the central government would acknowledge the rights of these governors to maintain their army, collect taxes and even to pass on their title to heirs.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}}{{sfn|Graff|2008|pp=43\u201344}} As time passed, these military governors slowly phased out the prominence of civil officials drafted by exams, and became more autonomous from central authority.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}} The rule of these powerful military governors lasted until 960, when a new civil order under the [[Song dynasty]] was established. Also, the abandonment of the equal-field system meant that people could buy and sell land freely. Many poor fell into debt because of this, forced to sell their land to the wealthy, which led to the exponential growth of large estates.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}} With the breakdown of the land allocation system after 755, the central Chinese state barely interfered in agricultural management and acted merely as tax collector for roughly a millennium, save a few instances such as the Song's failed land nationalization during the 13th-century war with the [[Mongols]].{{sfn|Adshead|2004|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nWith the central government collapsing in authority over the various regions of the empire, it was recorded in 845 that bandits and river pirates in parties of 100 or more began plundering settlements along the Yangtze River with little resistance.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|p=105}} In 858, enormous floods along the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] inundated vast tracts of land and terrain of the [[North China Plain]], which drowned tens of thousands of people in the process.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|p=105}}\nThe Chinese belief in the [[Mandate of Heaven]] granted to the ailing Tang was also challenged when natural calamities occurred, forcing many to believe the Heavens were displeased and that the Tang had lost their right to rule. Then in 873 a disastrous harvest shook the foundations of the empire; in some areas only half of all agricultural produce was gathered, and tens of thousands faced famine and starvation.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|p=105}} In the earlier period of the Tang, the central government was able to meet crises in the harvest, as it was recorded from 714\u2013719 that the Tang government responded effectively to natural disasters by extending the price-regulation [[granary]] system throughout the country.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|p=105}} The central government was able then to build a large surplus stock of foods to ward off the rising danger of famine and increased agricultural productivity through [[land reclamation]].{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Bowman|2000|p=105}} In the 9th century, however, the Tang government was nearly helpless in dealing with any calamity.\n\n===Rebuilding and recovery===\n[[File:Xumipagodazhengding.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Xumi Pagoda]], built in 636]]\nAlthough these natural calamities and rebellions stained the reputation and hampered the effectiveness of the central government, the early 9th century is nonetheless viewed as a period of recovery for the Tang dynasty.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=15\u201317}} The government's withdrawal from its role in managing the economy had the unintended effect of stimulating trade, as more markets with less bureaucratic restrictions were opened up.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=101}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=85}} By 780, the old grain tax and labor service of the 7th century was replaced by a semiannual tax paid in cash, signifying the shift to a money economy boosted by the merchant class.{{sfn|Schafer|1985|p=9}} Cities in the [[Jiangnan]] region to the south, such as [[Yangzhou]], [[Suzhou]], and [[Hangzhou]] prospered the most economically during the late Tang period.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=101}} The government monopoly on the production of salt, weakened after the An Shi Rebellion, was placed under the [[salt commission|Salt Commission]], which became one of the most powerful state agencies, run by capable ministers chosen as specialists. The commission began the practice of [[Salt in Chinese History#Official supervision, merchant transportation in the Tang and Song dynasties|selling merchants the rights to buy monopoly salt]], which they would then transport and sell in local markets. In 799 salt accounted for over half of the government's revenues.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}} S.A.M. Adshead writes that this salt tax represents \"the first time that an indirect tax, rather than tribute, levies on land or people, or profit from state enterprises such as mines, had been the primary resource of a major state.\"{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=50}} Even after the power of the central government was in decline after the mid 8th century, it was still able to function and give out imperial orders on a massive scale. The ''Tangshu'' ([[Old Book of Tang]]) compiled in the year 945 recorded that in 828 the Tang government issued a decree that standardized [[irrigation]]al square-pallet [[chain pump]]s in the country:\n\n<blockquote>In the second year of the Taihe reign period [828], in the second month...a standard model of the chain pump was issued from the palace, and the people of [[Jingzhao Fu]] (d footnote: the capital) were ordered by the emperor to make a considerable number of machines, for distribution to the people along the [[Zhengguo Canal|Zheng Bai Canal]], for irrigation purposes.|{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=347}}</blockquote>\n\nThe last great ambitious ruler of the Tang dynasty was [[Emperor Xianzong of Tang|Emperor Xianzong]] (r. 805\u2013820), whose reign was aided by the fiscal reforms of the 780s, including a government monopoly on the salt industry.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=14\u201315}} He also had an effective well trained imperial army stationed at the capital led by his court eunuchs; this was the Army of Divine Strategy, numbering 240,000 in strength as recorded in 798.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=15}} Between the years 806 and 819, Emperor Xianzong conducted seven major military campaigns to quell the rebellious provinces that had claimed autonomy from central authority, managing to subdue all but two of them.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=51}}{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=16}} Under his reign there was a brief end to the hereditary jiedushi, as Xianzong appointed his own military officers and staffed the regional bureaucracies once again with civil officials.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=51}}{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=16}} However, Xianzong's successors proved less capable and more interested in the leisure of hunting, feasting, and playing outdoor sports, allowing eunuchs to amass more power as drafted scholar-officials caused strife in the bureaucracy with factional parties.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=16}} The eunuchs' power became unchallenged after [[Emperor Wenzong of Tang|Emperor Wenzong]]'s (r. 826\u2013840) failed [[Ganlu Incident|plot to have them overthrown]]; instead the allies of Emperor Wenzong were publicly executed in the [[Chang'an#West Central Chang'an|West Market of Chang'an]], by the eunuchs' command.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=101}}\n\n[[File:Dunhuang Zhang Yichao army.jpg|thumb|400px|A late Tang mural commemorating the victory of General [[Zhang Yichao]] over the [[Tibetan Empire|Tibetans]] in 848 AD, from [[Mogao Caves|Mogao cave]] 156]]\nHowever, the Tang did manage to restore at least indirect control over former Tang territories as far west as the [[Hexi Corridor]] and [[Dunhuang]] in [[Gansu]].

In 903 he controlled the imperial court and forced [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang]] to move the capital to Luoyang, preparing to take the throne himself.

In 905 Zhu executed 9 brothers of Emperor Ai as well as many officials and [[Empress He (Tang dynasty)|Empress Dowager He]]. In 907 the Tang dynasty was ended when Zhu deposed Ai and took the throne for himself (known posthumously as Emperor Taizu of Later Liang).

A year later Zhu had the deposed Emperor Ai poisoned to death.\n\n==Administration and politics==\n{{see also|Administrative divisions of the Tang dynasty}}\n\n===Initial reforms===\n\nTaizong set out to solve internal problems within the government which had constantly plagued past dynasties.

There were also six ministries ({{zh|t=\u90e8|hp=b\u00f9|links=no}}) under the administrations that implemented policy, each of which was assigned different tasks. These [[Three Departments and Six Ministries]] included the personnel administration, finance, rites, military, justice, and public works\u2014an administrative model which would last until the fall of the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644\u20131912).{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=78}}\n\nAlthough the founders of the Tang related to the glory of the earlier [[Han dynasty]] (3rd century&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}\u20133rd century&nbsp;{{sc|ad}}), the basis for much of their administrative organization was very similar to the previous [[Northern and Southern dynasties]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} The [[Northern Zhou]] (6th century) [[fubing system]] of divisional militia was continued by the Tang, along with farmer-soldiers serving in rotation from the capital or frontier in order to receive appropriated farmland. The [[equal-field system]] of the [[Northern Wei]] (4th\u20136th centuries) was also kept, although there were a few modifications.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}}\n\nAlthough the central and local governments kept an enormous number of records about land property in order to assess taxes, it became common practice in the Tang for literate and affluent people to create their own private documents and signed contracts. These had their own signature and that of a witness and scribe in order to prove in court (if necessary) that their claim to property was legitimate. The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while contractual language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=59}}\n\nThe center of the political power of the Tang was the capital city of [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]), where the emperor maintained his large palace quarters and entertained political emissaries with music, sports, [[Acrobatics|acrobatic]] stunts, poetry, paintings, and [[Pear Garden|dramatic theater performances]]. The capital was also filled with incredible amounts of riches and resources to spare. When the Chinese [[prefecture|prefectural]] government officials traveled to the capital in the year 643 to give the annual report of the affairs in their districts, Emperor Taizong discovered that many had no proper quarters to rest in and were renting rooms with merchants. Therefore, Emperor Taizong ordered the government agencies in charge of [[Township|municipal]] construction to build every visiting official his own private [[mansion]] in the capital.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=59}}\n\n===Imperial examinations===\n{{Main|Imperial examination}}\n{{Further|Imperial examination in Chinese mythology}}\n\n[[File:Civilserviceexam1.jpg|thumb|left|Civil service exam candidates gather around the wall where results had been posted.

There were two types of exams that were given, ''mingjing'' ({{lang|zh|\u660e\u7d93}}; \"illuminating the classics\") and ''jinshi'' ({{lang|zh|\u9032\u58eb}}; \"presented scholar\").{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp = 91\u201392}} The ''mingjing'' was based upon the [[Chinese classic texts|Confucian classics]] and tested the student's knowledge of a broad variety of texts.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp=91\u201392}} The ''jinshi'' tested a student's literary abilities in writing essay-style responses to questions on matters of governance and politics, as well as their skills in composing [[Chinese poetry|poetry]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=92}} Candidates were also judged on their skills of deportment, appearance, speech, and level of skill in [[calligraphy]], all of which were subjective criteria that allowed the already wealthy members of society to be chosen over ones of more modest means who were unable to be educated in [[rhetoric]] or fanciful writing skills.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=97}} There was a disproportionate number of civil officials coming from aristocratic as opposed to non-aristocratic families.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=97}} The exams were open to all male subjects whose fathers were not of the [[Four occupations|artisan or merchant classes]],{{sfn|Gascoigne|Gascoigne|2003|p= 95}} although having wealth or noble status was not a prerequisite in receiving a recommendation.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=97}} In order to promote widespread Confucian education, the Tang government established state-run schools and issued standard versions of the [[Five Classics]] with selected commentaries.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p= 112}}\n\nThis competitive procedure was designed to draw the best talent into government. But perhaps an even greater consideration for the Tang rulers, aware that imperial dependence on powerful aristocratic families and [[warlord]]s would have destabilizing consequences, was to create a body of career officials having no autonomous territorial or functional [[Base (politics)|power base]]. The Tang law code ensured equal division of inherited property amongst legitimate heirs, allowing a bit of [[social mobility]] and preventing the families of powerful court officials from becoming [[landed nobility]] through [[primogeniture]].{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=83}} As it turned out, these scholar-officials acquired status in their local communities and in family ties, while they also shared values that connected them to the imperial court. From Tang times until the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912, [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-officials]] functioned often as intermediaries between the [[grassroots]] level and the government. Yet the potential of a widespread examination system was not fully realized until the Song dynasty, when the merit-driven scholar official largely shed his aristocratic habits and defined his social status through the examination system.{{sfn |Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=159}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=95}}{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=54}} As historian Patricia Ebrey states of the Song period scholar-officials:\n{{quote|The examination system, used only on a small scale in Sui and Tang times, played a central role in the fashioning of this new elite.

In his bid for power, Li Yuan had attracted a following by claiming descent from the [[Taoism|Daoist]] sage [[Laozi]] ({{floruit}}&nbsp;6th century&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}).{{sfn|Graff|2000|p=79}} People bidding for office would have monks from Buddhist temples pray for them in public in return for cash donations or gifts if the person was selected. Before the persecution of Buddhism in the 9th century, Buddhism and Daoism were accepted side by side, and [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] (r. 712\u2013756) invited monks and clerics of both religions to his court. At the same time Xuanzong exalted the ancient Laozi by granting him grand titles, wrote commentary on the Daoist ''Laozi'', set up a school to prepare candidates for examinations on Daoist scriptures, and called upon the Indian monk [[Vajrabodhi]] (671\u2013741) to perform [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] rites to avert a drought in the year 726. In 742 Emperor Xuanzong personally held the incense burner during a ceremony led by [[Amoghavajra]] (705\u2013774, patriarch of the [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon school]]) reciting \"mystical incantations to secure the victory of Tang forces.\"{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=99}}\n\nWhile religion played a role in politics, politics also played a role in religion. In the year 714, Emperor Xuanzong forbade shops and vendors in the city of Chang'an to sell copied Buddhist sutras, instead giving the Buddhist clergy of the monasteries the sole right to distribute sutras to the [[laity]].{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=57}} In the previous year of 713, Emperor Xuanzong had liquidated the highly lucrative [[Chang'an#Northwestern Chang'an|Inexhaustible Treasury]], which was run by a prominent Buddhist monastery in Chang'an. This monastery collected vast amounts of money, silk, and treasures through multitudes of anonymous people's repentances, leaving the donations on the monastery's premise. Although the monastery was generous in donations, Emperor Xuanzong issued a decree abolishing their treasury on grounds that their [[History of banking in China|banking]] practices were fraudulent, collected their riches, and distributed the wealth to various other Buddhist monasteries and Daoist abbeys, and to repair statues, halls, and bridges in the city.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=61}}\n\n===Taxes and the census===\n\nThe Tang dynasty government attempted to create an accurate census of the size of their empire's population, mostly for effective taxation and matters of military conscription for each region. The early Tang government established both the grain tax and cloth tax at a relatively low rate for each household under the empire. This was meant to encourage households to enroll for taxation and not avoid the authorities, thus providing the government with the most accurate estimate possible.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} In the census of 609, the population was tallied by efforts of the government at a size of 9 million households, or about 50&nbsp;million people.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} The Tang census of 742 again approximated the size of China's population at about 50&nbsp;million people.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=141}} Patricia Ebrey writes that even if a rather significant number of people had avoided the registration process of the tax census, the population size during the Tang had not grown significantly since the earlier Han dynasty (the [[History of the Han dynasty|census of the year 2]] recording a population of roughly 58 million people in China).{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}}{{sfn|Nishijima|1986|pp=595\u2013596}} S.A.M.

After Xuanzong's reign, military governors (jiedushi) were given enormous power, including the ability to maintain their own armies, collect taxes, and pass their titles on hereditarily.

[[Silla\u2013Tang alliance|Allying with the Korean Silla Kingdom]], the Chinese fought against [[Baekje]] and their [[Kofun period|Yamato Japanese]] allies in the [[Battle of Baekgang]] in August 663, a decisive Tang\u2013Silla victory.

In another joint invasion with Silla, the Tang army severely weakened the Goguryeo Kingdom in the north by taking out its outer forts in the year 645. With joint attacks by Silla and Tang armies under commander [[Li Shiji]] (594\u2013669), the Kingdom of Goguryeo was destroyed by 668.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=4}}\n\n[[File:Mogao Cave 61, painting of Mount Wutai monasteries.jpg|thumb|A 10th-century mural painting in the [[Mogao Caves]] at [[Dunhuang]] showing monastic architecture from [[Mount Wutai]], Tang dynasty; [[Japanese architecture]] of this period was influenced by Tang Chinese architecture]]\n\nAlthough they were formerly enemies, the Tang accepted officials and generals of Goguryeo into their administration and military, such as the brothers [[Yeon Namsaeng]] (634\u2013679) and [[Yeon Namsan]] (639\u2013701).

''Jintishi'' poetry, or regulated verse, is in the form of eight-line [[stanza]]s or seven [[Chinese characters|characters]] per line with a fixed pattern of tones that required the second and third couplets to be antithetical (although the [[antithesis]] is often lost in translation to other languages).{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=102}} Tang poems remained popular and great emulation of Tang era poetry began in the Song dynasty; in that period, Yan Yu (\u56b4\u7fbd; active 1194\u20131245) was the first to confer the poetry of the High Tang (c. 713\u2013766) era with \"canonical status within the classical poetic tradition.\" Yan Yu reserved the position of highest esteem among all Tang poets for [[Du Fu]] (712\u2013770), who was not viewed as such in his own era, and was branded by his peers as an anti-traditional rebel.{{sfn|Yu|1998|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nThe [[Classical Prose Movement]] was spurred in large part by the writings of Tang authors [[Liu Zongyuan]] (773\u2013819) and [[Han Yu]] (768\u2013824). This new prose style broke away from the poetry tradition of the ''piantiwen'' ({{lang|zh|\u9a19\u9ad4\u6587}}, \"parallel prose\") style begun in the Han dynasty. Although writers of the Classical Prose Movement imitated ''piantiwen'', they criticized it for its often vague content and lack of colloquial language, focusing more on clarity and precision to make their writing more direct.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=106}} This ''guwen'' (archaic prose) style can be traced back to Han Yu, and would become largely associated with [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[Neo-Confucianism]].{{sfn|Huters|1987|p=52}}\n\nShort story fiction and tales were also popular during the Tang, one of the more famous ones being ''Yingying's Biography'' by [[Yuan Zhen]] (779\u2013831), which was widely circulated in his own time and by the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1279\u20131368) became the basis for plays in [[Chinese opera]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp=104\u2013105}}{{sfn|Wong|1979|p=97}} Timothy C.

The 8th-century author [[Lu Yu]] (known as the Sage of Tea) even wrote a treatise on the art of drinking tea, called ''[[The Classic of Tea]]''.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=95}} Although [[gift wrapping|wrapping paper]] had been used in China since the 2nd century BC,{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=122}} during the Tang dynasty the Chinese were using wrapping paper as folded and sewn square bags to hold and preserve the flavor of tea leaves.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=122}} Indeed, paper found many other uses besides writing and wrapping during the Tang era.\n\nEarlier, the first recorded use of [[toilet paper]] was made in 589 by the scholar-official [[Yan Zhitui]] (531\u2013591),{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=123}} and in 851 an [[Arabs|Arab]] Muslim traveler commented on how he believed the Tang era Chinese were not careful about cleanliness because they did not wash with water (as was his people's habit) when going to the bathroom; instead, he said, the Chinese simply used paper to wipe themselves.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=123}}\n\nIn ancient times, the Chinese had outlined the five most basic foodstuffs known as the five grains: [[sesamum]], [[legume]]s, wheat, [[panicle]]d [[millet]], and [[glutinous]] millet.{{sfn|Song|1966|pp=3\u20134}} The [[Ming dynasty]] [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedist]] [[Song Yingxing]] (1587\u20131666) noted that rice was not counted amongst the five grains from the time of the legendary and deified Chinese sage [[Shennong]] (the existence of whom Yingxing wrote was \"an uncertain matter\") into the 2nd millenniums BC, because the properly wet and humid climate in southern China for growing rice was not yet fully settled or cultivated by the Chinese.{{sfn|Song|1966|pp=3\u20134}} But Song Yingxing also noted that in the Ming dynasty, seven tenths of civilians' food was rice. In fact, in the Tang dynasty rice was not only the most important staple in southern China, but had also became popular in the north, which was for a long time the center of China.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tang Cuisine|last=Wang|first=Saishi|publisher=Qilu Publishing House|year=2003|isbn=978-7-5333-1174-2|location=Dongying, Shandong|pages=18}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dame Chine Guimet 291003.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|[[Tang dynasty tomb figures|Tomb figure]] of a lady attendant, 7th- to 8th-century; during the Tang era, female hosts prepared feasts, tea parties, and played drinking games with their guests.]]\n\nDuring the Tang dynasty, wheat replaced the position of millet and became the main staple crop.

Like the Rougamo in modern Chinese cuisine, steamed cake was usually stuffed by meat and vegetable. There were plenty of shops and packmen selling steamed cake in Chang\u2019an, and its price was also far from expensive.

The definition here was very broad, including current day wonton, noodles, and many other kinds of food that soak wheat in water. Consuming boiled cake was treated as an effective and popular way of diet therapy. While aristocrats favored wonton, civilians usually consumed noodles and noodle slice soup, because the process to make wonton was heavy and complicated.<ref name=\"Wang 2003 6\">{{Cite book|title=Tang Cuisine|last=Wang|first=Saishi|publisher=Qilu Publisher House|year=2003|isbn=978-7-5333-1174-2|location=Dongying|pages=6}}</ref>\n\nPancake was hard to find in China before the Tang.

The common people used simple methods of preservation, such as digging deep ditches and trenches, [[brining]], and salting their foods.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=126\u2013127}} The emperor had large ice pits located in the parks in and around Chang'an for preserving food, while the wealthy and elite had their own smaller ice pits.

Previous advancements in clockworks and timekeeping included the mechanical gear systems of [[Zhang Heng]] (78\u2013139) and [[Ma Jun]] (fl. 3rd century), which gave the Tang mathematician, mechanical engineer, astronomer, and monk [[Yi Xing]] (683\u2013727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork [[escapement]] mechanism in 725.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=319}} This was used alongside a [[Water clock|clepsydra]] clock and [[waterwheel]] to power a rotating [[armillary sphere]] in representation of [[astronomical]] observation.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=473\u2013475}} Yi Xing's device also had a mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a [[striking clock]].{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=473\u2013474}} Yi Xing's [[astronomical clock]] and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=475}} However, the most common type of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui-dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a [[steelyard balance]] that allowed seasonal adjustment in the [[pressure head]] of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=480}}\n\nThere were many other mechanical inventions during the Tang era. These included a 3&nbsp;ft (0.91&nbsp;m) tall mechanical wine server of the early 8th century that was in the shape of an artificial mountain, carved out of iron and rested on a [[lacquer]]ed-wooden tortoise frame. This intricate device used a hydraulic pump that siphoned wine out of metal [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]-headed faucets, as well as tilting bowls that were timed to dip wine down, by force of [[gravity]] when filled, into an artificial lake that had intricate iron leaves popping up as trays for placing party treats.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=144}} Furthermore, as the historian Charles Benn describes it:\n\n{{Quote|Midway up the southern side of the mountain was a dragon\u2026the beast opened its mouth and spit brew into a goblet seated on a large [iron] lotus leaf beneath. When the cup was 80% full, the dragon ceased spewing ale, and a guest immediately seized the goblet. If he was slow in draining the cup and returning it to the leaf, the door of a pavilion at the top of the mountain opened and a mechanical wine server, dressed in a cap and gown, emerged with a wooden bat in his hand. As soon as the guest returned the goblet, the dragon refilled it, the wine server withdrew, and the doors of the pavilion closed\u2026A pump siphoned the ale that flowed into the ale pool through a hidden hole and returned the brew to the reservoir [holding more than 16 quarts/15 liters of wine] inside the mountain.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=144}}}}\n\nYet the use of a teasing mechanical puppet in this wine-serving device wasn't exactly a novel invention of the Tang, since the use of mechanical puppets in China date back to the [[Qin dynasty]] (221\u2013207 BC). In the 3rd century [[Ma Jun]] had an entire mechanical puppet theater operated by the rotation of a waterwheel.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=158}} There was also an automatic wine-server known in the ancient [[Greco-Roman]] world, a design of the Greek inventor [[Heron of Alexandria]] that employed an urn with an inner valve and a lever device similar to the one described above. There are many stories of [[automaton]]s used in the Tang, including general Yang Wulian's wooden statue of a monk who stretched his hands out to collect contributions; when the amount of coins reached a certain weight, the mechanical figure moved his arms to deposit them in a satchel.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163}} This weight-and-lever mechanism was exactly like Heron's penny [[slot machine]].{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163 footnote c}} Other devices included one by Wang Ju, whose \"wooden otter\" could allegedly catch fish; Needham suspects a [[Spring (device)|spring trap]] of some kind was employed here.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163}}\n\nIn the realm of structural engineering and technical [[Chinese architecture]], there were also government standard building codes, outlined in the early Tang book of the ''Yingshan Ling'' (National Building Law).{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=1}} Fragments of this book have survived in the ''Tang L\u00fc'' (The Tang Code),{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=3}} while the Song dynasty architectural manual of the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'' (State Building Standards) by [[Architecture of the Song dynasty#Literature|Li Jie]] (1065\u20131101) in 1103 is the oldest existing technical treatise on Chinese architecture that has survived in full.{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=1}} During the reign of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (712\u2013756) there were 34,850 registered [[Artisan|craftsmen]] serving the state, managed by the Agency of Palace Buildings (Jingzuo Jian).{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=3}}\n\n===Woodblock printing===\n{{Main|Woodblock printing|Playing cards|Chinese playing cards}}\n[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The [[Diamond Sutra]], printed in 868, is the world's first widely printed book to include a specific date of printing.]]\n\n[[Woodblock printing]] made the written word available to vastly greater audiences.

When the Tang chancellor [[Pei Ju]] (547\u2013627) was working for the Sui dynasty as a Commercial Commissioner in 605, he created a well-known gridded map with a [[Scale (map)|graduated scale]] in the tradition of [[Pei Xiu]] (224\u2013271).{{sfn|Needham|1986a|pp=538\u2013540, 543}} The Tang chancellor [[Xu Jingzong]] (592\u2013672) was also known for his map of China drawn in the year 658.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} In the year 785 the [[Emperor Dezong of Tang|Emperor Dezong]] had the geographer and cartographer [[Jia Dan]] (730\u2013805) complete a map of China and her former colonies in Central Asia.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} Upon its completion in 801, the map was 9.1&nbsp;m (30&nbsp;ft) in length and 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft) in height, mapped out on a grid scale of one inch equaling one hundred ''[[li (unit)|li]]'' (Chinese unit of measuring distance).{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} A Chinese map of 1137 is similar in complexity to the one made by Jia Dan, carved on a stone stele with a grid scale of 100 li.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=Plate LXXXI}} However, the only type of map that has survived from the Tang period are [[star chart]]s.

One of the surviving sources of the ''Old Book of Tang'', primarily covering up to 756, is the ''[[Tongdian]]'', which [[Du You]] presented to the emperor in 801. The Tang period was again placed into the enormous [[universal history]] text of the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', edited, compiled, and completed in 1084 by a team of scholars under the Song dynasty Chancellor [[Sima Guang]] (1019\u20131086). This historical text, written with three million [[Chinese characters]] in 294 volumes, covered the history of China from the beginning of the [[Warring States]] (403 BC) until the beginning of the Song dynasty (960).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China|History}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Chinese emperors family tree (middle)#Tang and Second Zhou Dynasties|The family tree of the Tang dynasty emperors]]\n* [[Di Renjie]]\n* [[Dongyi Protectorate]]\n* [[Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup]]\n* ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' (government newspaper for officials)\n* [[List of emperors of the Tang dynasty]]\n* [[List of tributaries of Imperial China]]\n* [[Nine Pinnacle Pagoda]]\n* [[Qianling Mausoleum]]\n* [[Tang dynasty in Inner Asia]]\n* [[Tang poetry]]\n* [[Taxation in premodern China]]\n* [[Wei Zheng]]\n* [[Yan Zhenqing]]\n* [[Yijing (monk)]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{citation |last=Adshead |first=S.A.M. |title = China in World History |edition=2nd |year=1995 |orig-year=1988 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] and St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-333-62132-5}}\n* {{citation |last=Adshead |first=S.A.M. |title = T'ang China: The Rise of the East in World History|year=2004|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4039-3456-7}}\n* {{citation |last=Andrew |first=Anita N. |last2=Rapp |first2=John A. |title=Autocracy and Cina's Rebel Founding Emperors: Comparing Chairman Mao and Ming Taizu |year=2000 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |location=Lanham |isbn=978-0-8476-9580-5}}\n* {{citation |last=Bai |first=Shouyi|authorlink=Bai Shouyi |title = A History of Chinese Muslim (Vol. 2)|year=2003|publisher=Zhonghua Book Company |location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-101-02890-4}}\n* {{citation |last=Ball |first=Warwick |authorlink=Warwick Ball |title = Rome in the East: Transformation of an Empire |edition=2nd |year=2016 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-72078-6}}\n* {{citation |last=Beckwith|first=Christopher I.|title=The Tibetan Empire in Central Asia|year=1987|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-691-02469-1}}\n* {{citation |last=Benn|first=Charles|title=China's Golden Age: Everyday Life in the Tang dynasty|year=2002|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-517665-0}}\n* {{Citation |last=Bernhardt|first=Kathryn|date=July 1995|title=The Inheritance Right of Daughters: the Song Anomaly?|journal=Modern China|pages=269\u2013309}}\n* {{citation |last=Bowman|first=John S.|title=Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture|year=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}\n* {{citation |last=Brook|first=Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Brook (historian)|title=The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China|year=1998|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-22154-3|title-link=The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China }}\n* {{citation |last=Chen|first=Yan|title=Maritime Silk Route and Chinese-Foreign Cultural Exchanges|year=2002|publisher=Peking University Press|location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-301-03029-5}}\n* {{citation |last=Cui|first=Mingde|title=The History of Chinese Heqin|year=2005|publisher=Renmin Chubanshe|location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-01-004828-4}}\n* {{cite book |title=Tang China and the Collapse of the Uighur Empire: A Documentary History |author-first=Michael R. |author-last=Drompp |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB6DEdAxLOsC |series=Brill's Inner Asian Library |year=2004 |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-14129-2 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Drompp |first=Michael R. |authormask=3 |chapter=Late-Tang Foreign Relations: The Uyghur Crisis |title=Hawai'i Reader in Traditional Chinese Culture |editor1-last=Mair |editor1-first=Victor H. |editor2=Nancy S.

It was preceded by the [[Sui dynasty]] and followed by the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] in Chinese history. Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization, and a [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of cosmopolitan culture.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p= 1}} Tang territory, acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers, rivaled that of the [[Han dynasty]]. The Tang capital at [[Chang'an]] (present-day [[Xi'an]]) was the most populous city in the world in its day.\n\nThe [[House of Li|L\u01d0 family]] ({{Lang-zh|c=\u674e|s=|t=|labels=no}}) founded the dynasty, seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire. The dynasty was interrupted for 15 years when Empress [[Wu Zetian]] seized the throne, proclaiming the [[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Wu Zhou dynasty]] and becoming the only legitimate Chinese [[empress regnant]]. In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries, the Tang records estimated the population by number of registered households at about 50 million people.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p= 91}}{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|pp= 111, 141}}  Yet, even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century, it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people.{{sfn|Du|1998|p= 37}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p= 106}}{{efn|During the rule of the Tang the world population grew from about 190 million to approximately 240&nbsp;million, a difference of 50&nbsp;million. See also [[medieval demography]].}}  With its large population base, the dynasty was able to raise professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers in dominating [[Inner Asia]] and the lucrative trade-routes along the [[Silk Road]].  [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|Various kingdoms and states paid tribute]] to the Tang court, while the Tang also conquered or subdued several regions which it indirectly controlled through a [[protectorate]] system.  Besides political [[hegemony]], the Tang also exerted a powerful cultural influence over neighboring [[East Asia]]n states such as those in [[History of Japan#Classical Japan|Japan]] and [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Korea]].\n\nThe Tang dynasty was largely a period of progress and stability in the first half of the dynasty's rule, until the devastating [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (755\u2013763) and the decline of central authority in the later half of the dynasty. Like the previous [[Sui dynasty]], the Tang dynasty maintained a civil-service system by recruiting [[scholar-official]]s through [[Imperial examination|standardized examinations]] and recommendations to office.  The rise of regional military governors known as ''[[jiedushi]]'' during the 9th century undermined this civil order.  [[Chinese culture]] flourished and further matured during the Tang era; it is traditionally considered the greatest age for [[Chinese poetry]].{{sfn|Yu|1998|pp= 73\u201387}}  Two of China's most famous poets, [[Li Bai]] and [[Du Fu]], belonged to this age, as did many famous painters such as [[Han Gan]], [[Zhang Xuan]], and [[Zhou Fang (Tang dynasty)|Zhou Fang]].  Scholars of this period compiled a rich variety of [[Chinese historiography|historical literature]], as well as encyclopedias and geographical works. The adoption of the title [[Khan of Heaven]] by the Tang emperor [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Taizong]] in addition to his title as [[Emperor of China|emperor]] was eastern Asia's first \"simultaneous kingship\".{{sfn|Skaff|2012|p= 127}}\n\nMany notable innovations occurred under the Tang, including the development of [[woodblock printing]].

There were also six ministries ({{zh|t=\u90e8|hp=b\u00f9|links=no}}) under the administrations that implemented policy, each of which was assigned different tasks. These [[Three Departments and Six Ministries]] included the personnel administration, finance, rites, military, justice, and public works\u2014an administrative model which would last until the fall of the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644\u20131912).{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=78}}\n\nAlthough the founders of the Tang related to the glory of the earlier [[Han dynasty]] (3rd century&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}\u20133rd century&nbsp;{{sc|ad}}), the basis for much of their administrative organization was very similar to the previous [[Northern and Southern dynasties]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} The [[Northern Zhou]] (6th century) [[fubing system]] of divisional militia was continued by the Tang, along with farmer-soldiers serving in rotation from the capital or frontier in order to receive appropriated farmland. The [[equal-field system]] of the [[Northern Wei]] (4th\u20136th centuries) was also kept, although there were a few modifications.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}}\n\nAlthough the central and local governments kept an enormous number of records about land property in order to assess taxes, it became common practice in the Tang for literate and affluent people to create their own private documents and signed contracts. These had their own signature and that of a witness and scribe in order to prove in court (if necessary) that their claim to property was legitimate. The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while contractual language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=59}}\n\nThe center of the political power of the Tang was the capital city of [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]), where the emperor maintained his large palace quarters and entertained political emissaries with music, sports, [[Acrobatics|acrobatic]] stunts, poetry, paintings, and [[Pear Garden|dramatic theater performances]]. The capital was also filled with incredible amounts of riches and resources to spare. When the Chinese [[prefecture|prefectural]] government officials traveled to the capital in the year 643 to give the annual report of the affairs in their districts, Emperor Taizong discovered that many had no proper quarters to rest in and were renting rooms with merchants. Therefore, Emperor Taizong ordered the government agencies in charge of [[Township|municipal]] construction to build every visiting official his own private [[mansion]] in the capital.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=59}}\n\n===Imperial examinations===\n{{Main|Imperial examination}}\n{{Further|Imperial examination in Chinese mythology}}\n\n[[File:Civilserviceexam1.jpg|thumb|left|Civil service exam candidates gather around the wall where results had been posted. Artwork by [[Qiu Ying]].]]\n\nStudents of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] studies were potential candidates for the [[imperial examination]]s, the graduates of which could be appointed as state bureaucrats in the local, provincial, and central government. There were two types of exams that were given, ''mingjing'' ({{lang|zh|\u660e\u7d93}}; \"illuminating the classics\") and ''jinshi'' ({{lang|zh|\u9032\u58eb}}; \"presented scholar\").{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp = 91\u201392}} The ''mingjing'' was based upon the [[Chinese classic texts|Confucian classics]] and tested the student's knowledge of a broad variety of texts.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp=91\u201392}} The ''jinshi'' tested a student's literary abilities in writing essay-style responses to questions on matters of governance and politics, as well as their skills in composing [[Chinese poetry|poetry]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=92}} Candidates were also judged on their skills of deportment, appearance, speech, and level of skill in [[calligraphy]], all of which were subjective criteria that allowed the already wealthy members of society to be chosen over ones of more modest means who were unable to be educated in [[rhetoric]] or fanciful writing skills.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=97}} There was a disproportionate number of civil officials coming from aristocratic as opposed to non-aristocratic families.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=97}} The exams were open to all male subjects whose fathers were not of the [[Four occupations|artisan or merchant classes]],{{sfn|Gascoigne|Gascoigne|2003|p= 95}} although having wealth or noble status was not a prerequisite in receiving a recommendation.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=97}} In order to promote widespread Confucian education, the Tang government established state-run schools and issued standard versions of the [[Five Classics]] with selected commentaries.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p= 112}}\n\nThis competitive procedure was designed to draw the best talent into government. But perhaps an even greater consideration for the Tang rulers, aware that imperial dependence on powerful aristocratic families and [[warlord]]s would have destabilizing consequences, was to create a body of career officials having no autonomous territorial or functional [[Base (politics)|power base]]. The Tang law code ensured equal division of inherited property amongst legitimate heirs, allowing a bit of [[social mobility]] and preventing the families of powerful court officials from becoming [[landed nobility]] through [[primogeniture]].{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=83}} As it turned out, these scholar-officials acquired status in their local communities and in family ties, while they also shared values that connected them to the imperial court. From Tang times until the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912, [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-officials]] functioned often as intermediaries between the [[grassroots]] level and the government. Yet the potential of a widespread examination system was not fully realized until the Song dynasty, when the merit-driven scholar official largely shed his aristocratic habits and defined his social status through the examination system.{{sfn |Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=159}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=95}}{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=54}} As historian Patricia Ebrey states of the Song period scholar-officials:\n{{quote|The examination system, used only on a small scale in Sui and Tang times, played a central role in the fashioning of this new elite.

In his bid for power, Li Yuan had attracted a following by claiming descent from the [[Taoism|Daoist]] sage [[Laozi]] ({{floruit}}&nbsp;6th century&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}).{{sfn|Graff|2000|p=79}} People bidding for office would have monks from Buddhist temples pray for them in public in return for cash donations or gifts if the person was selected. Before the persecution of Buddhism in the 9th century, Buddhism and Daoism were accepted side by side, and [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] (r. 712\u2013756) invited monks and clerics of both religions to his court. At the same time Xuanzong exalted the ancient Laozi by granting him grand titles, wrote commentary on the Daoist ''Laozi'', set up a school to prepare candidates for examinations on Daoist scriptures, and called upon the Indian monk [[Vajrabodhi]] (671\u2013741) to perform [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] rites to avert a drought in the year 726. In 742 Emperor Xuanzong personally held the incense burner during a ceremony led by [[Amoghavajra]] (705\u2013774, patriarch of the [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon school]]) reciting \"mystical incantations to secure the victory of Tang forces.\"{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=99}}\n\nWhile religion played a role in politics, politics also played a role in religion. In the year 714, Emperor Xuanzong forbade shops and vendors in the city of Chang'an to sell copied Buddhist sutras, instead giving the Buddhist clergy of the monasteries the sole right to distribute sutras to the [[laity]].{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=57}} In the previous year of 713, Emperor Xuanzong had liquidated the highly lucrative [[Chang'an#Northwestern Chang'an|Inexhaustible Treasury]], which was run by a prominent Buddhist monastery in Chang'an. This monastery collected vast amounts of money, silk, and treasures through multitudes of anonymous people's repentances, leaving the donations on the monastery's premise. Although the monastery was generous in donations, Emperor Xuanzong issued a decree abolishing their treasury on grounds that their [[History of banking in China|banking]] practices were fraudulent, collected their riches, and distributed the wealth to various other Buddhist monasteries and Daoist abbeys, and to repair statues, halls, and bridges in the city.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=61}}\n\n===Taxes and the census===\n\nThe Tang dynasty government attempted to create an accurate census of the size of their empire's population, mostly for effective taxation and matters of military conscription for each region. The early Tang government established both the grain tax and cloth tax at a relatively low rate for each household under the empire. This was meant to encourage households to enroll for taxation and not avoid the authorities, thus providing the government with the most accurate estimate possible.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} In the census of 609, the population was tallied by efforts of the government at a size of 9 million households, or about 50&nbsp;million people.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} The Tang census of 742 again approximated the size of China's population at about 50&nbsp;million people.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=141}} Patricia Ebrey writes that even if a rather significant number of people had avoided the registration process of the tax census, the population size during the Tang had not grown significantly since the earlier Han dynasty (the [[History of the Han dynasty|census of the year 2]] recording a population of roughly 58 million people in China).{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}}{{sfn|Nishijima|1986|pp=595\u2013596}} S.A.M. Adshead disagrees, estimating that there were about 75 million people by 750.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=72}}\n\nIn the Tang census of the year 754, there were 1,859 cities, 321 [[Prefecture (China)|prefectures]], and 1,538 [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|counties]] throughout the empire.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=45}} Although there were many large and prominent cities during the Tang, the rural and agrarian areas comprised the majority of China's population at some 80 to 90%.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=32}} There was also a dramatic migratory shift of the population from [[Northern and southern China|northern to southern China]], as the North held 75% of the overall population at the dynasty's inception, but by its end was reduced to 50%.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=75}}\n\nChinese population size would not dramatically increase until the Song dynasty period, when the population doubled to 100 million people because of extensive rice cultivation in central and southern China, coupled with rural farmers holding more abundant yields of food that they could easily provide to the growing market.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=156}}\n\n==Military and foreign policy==\n{{main|Military history of the Sui\u2013Tang dynasties|Naval history of China|Jimi system}}\n{{Further|Imperial Guards (Tang dynasty)}}\n\n[[File:Emperor Taizong gives an audience to the ambassador of Tibet.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]] (r. 626\u2013649) receives [[Gar Tongtsen Y\u00fclsung]], ambassador of the [[Tibetan Empire]], at his court; [[Emperor Taizong Receiving the Tibetan Envoy|later copy]] of an original painted in 641 by [[Yan Liben]] (600\u2013673)]]\n\n===Protectorates and tributaries===\n\nThe 7th and first half of the 8th century are generally considered to be the era in which the Tang reached the zenith of its power.

After Xuanzong's reign, military governors (jiedushi) were given enormous power, including the ability to maintain their own armies, collect taxes, and pass their titles on hereditarily. This is commonly recognized as the beginning of the fall of Tang's central government.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}}{{sfn|Wang|2003|p=91}}\n\n[[File:Tang Pottery Warrior.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Tang dynasty tomb figures|Pottery tomb figure]] of a warrior from Duan's Tomb, [[Shaanxi]].]]\n\n===Soldiers and conscription===\n\nBy the year 737, Emperor Xuanzong discarded the policy of conscripting soldiers that were replaced every three years, replacing them with long-service soldiers who were more battle-hardened and efficient. It was more economically feasible as well, since training new recruits and sending them out to the frontier every three years drained the treasury.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=9}} By the late 7th century, the ''[[Fubing system|fubing]]'' troops began abandoning military service and the homes provided to them in the equal-field system.

In another joint invasion with Silla, the Tang army severely weakened the Goguryeo Kingdom in the north by taking out its outer forts in the year 645.

From 668 to 676, the Tang Empire would control northern Korea. However, in 671 Silla broke the alliance and began the [[Silla\u2013Tang War]] to expel the Tang forces.

The poet [[Lu Tong]] (790\u2013835) devoted most of his poetry to his love of tea. The 8th-century author [[Lu Yu]] (known as the Sage of Tea) even wrote a treatise on the art of drinking tea, called ''[[The Classic of Tea]]''.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=95}} Although [[gift wrapping|wrapping paper]] had been used in China since the 2nd century BC,{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=122}} during the Tang dynasty the Chinese were using wrapping paper as folded and sewn square bags to hold and preserve the flavor of tea leaves.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=122}} Indeed, paper found many other uses besides writing and wrapping during the Tang era.\n\nEarlier, the first recorded use of [[toilet paper]] was made in 589 by the scholar-official [[Yan Zhitui]] (531\u2013591),{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=123}} and in 851 an [[Arabs|Arab]] Muslim traveler commented on how he believed the Tang era Chinese were not careful about cleanliness because they did not wash with water (as was his people's habit) when going to the bathroom; instead, he said, the Chinese simply used paper to wipe themselves.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=123}}\n\nIn ancient times, the Chinese had outlined the five most basic foodstuffs known as the five grains: [[sesamum]], [[legume]]s, wheat, [[panicle]]d [[millet]], and [[glutinous]] millet.{{sfn|Song|1966|pp=3\u20134}} The [[Ming dynasty]] [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedist]] [[Song Yingxing]] (1587\u20131666) noted that rice was not counted amongst the five grains from the time of the legendary and deified Chinese sage [[Shennong]] (the existence of whom Yingxing wrote was \"an uncertain matter\") into the 2nd millenniums BC, because the properly wet and humid climate in southern China for growing rice was not yet fully settled or cultivated by the Chinese.{{sfn|Song|1966|pp=3\u20134}} But Song Yingxing also noted that in the Ming dynasty, seven tenths of civilians' food was rice.

Like the Rougamo in modern Chinese cuisine, steamed cake was usually stuffed by meat and vegetable. There were plenty of shops and packmen selling steamed cake in Chang\u2019an, and its price was also far from expensive.

The definition here was very broad, including current day wonton, noodles, and many other kinds of food that soak wheat in water. Consuming boiled cake was treated as an effective and popular way of diet therapy.

Previous advancements in clockworks and timekeeping included the mechanical gear systems of [[Zhang Heng]] (78\u2013139) and [[Ma Jun]] (fl. 3rd century), which gave the Tang mathematician, mechanical engineer, astronomer, and monk [[Yi Xing]] (683\u2013727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork [[escapement]] mechanism in 725.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=319}} This was used alongside a [[Water clock|clepsydra]] clock and [[waterwheel]] to power a rotating [[armillary sphere]] in representation of [[astronomical]] observation.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=473\u2013475}} Yi Xing's device also had a mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a [[striking clock]].{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=473\u2013474}} Yi Xing's [[astronomical clock]] and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=475}} However, the most common type of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui-dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a [[steelyard balance]] that allowed seasonal adjustment in the [[pressure head]] of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=480}}\n\nThere were many other mechanical inventions during the Tang era. These included a 3&nbsp;ft (0.91&nbsp;m) tall mechanical wine server of the early 8th century that was in the shape of an artificial mountain, carved out of iron and rested on a [[lacquer]]ed-wooden tortoise frame. This intricate device used a hydraulic pump that siphoned wine out of metal [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]-headed faucets, as well as tilting bowls that were timed to dip wine down, by force of [[gravity]] when filled, into an artificial lake that had intricate iron leaves popping up as trays for placing party treats.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=144}} Furthermore, as the historian Charles Benn describes it:\n\n{{Quote|Midway up the southern side of the mountain was a dragon\u2026the beast opened its mouth and spit brew into a goblet seated on a large [iron] lotus leaf beneath. When the cup was 80% full, the dragon ceased spewing ale, and a guest immediately seized the goblet. If he was slow in draining the cup and returning it to the leaf, the door of a pavilion at the top of the mountain opened and a mechanical wine server, dressed in a cap and gown, emerged with a wooden bat in his hand. As soon as the guest returned the goblet, the dragon refilled it, the wine server withdrew, and the doors of the pavilion closed\u2026A pump siphoned the ale that flowed into the ale pool through a hidden hole and returned the brew to the reservoir [holding more than 16 quarts/15 liters of wine] inside the mountain.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=144}}}}\n\nYet the use of a teasing mechanical puppet in this wine-serving device wasn't exactly a novel invention of the Tang, since the use of mechanical puppets in China date back to the [[Qin dynasty]] (221\u2013207 BC). In the 3rd century [[Ma Jun]] had an entire mechanical puppet theater operated by the rotation of a waterwheel.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=158}} There was also an automatic wine-server known in the ancient [[Greco-Roman]] world, a design of the Greek inventor [[Heron of Alexandria]] that employed an urn with an inner valve and a lever device similar to the one described above. There are many stories of [[automaton]]s used in the Tang, including general Yang Wulian's wooden statue of a monk who stretched his hands out to collect contributions; when the amount of coins reached a certain weight, the mechanical figure moved his arms to deposit them in a satchel.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163}} This weight-and-lever mechanism was exactly like Heron's penny [[slot machine]].{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163 footnote c}} Other devices included one by Wang Ju, whose \"wooden otter\" could allegedly catch fish; Needham suspects a [[Spring (device)|spring trap]] of some kind was employed here.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163}}\n\nIn the realm of structural engineering and technical [[Chinese architecture]], there were also government standard building codes, outlined in the early Tang book of the ''Yingshan Ling'' (National Building Law).{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=1}} Fragments of this book have survived in the ''Tang L\u00fc'' (The Tang Code),{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=3}} while the Song dynasty architectural manual of the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'' (State Building Standards) by [[Architecture of the Song dynasty#Literature|Li Jie]] (1065\u20131101) in 1103 is the oldest existing technical treatise on Chinese architecture that has survived in full.{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=1}} During the reign of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (712\u2013756) there were 34,850 registered [[Artisan|craftsmen]] serving the state, managed by the Agency of Palace Buildings (Jingzuo Jian).{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=3}}\n\n===Woodblock printing===\n{{Main|Woodblock printing|Playing cards|Chinese playing cards}}\n[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The [[Diamond Sutra]], printed in 868, is the world's first widely printed book to include a specific date of printing.]]\n\n[[Woodblock printing]] made the written word available to vastly greater audiences.

When the Tang chancellor [[Pei Ju]] (547\u2013627) was working for the Sui dynasty as a Commercial Commissioner in 605, he created a well-known gridded map with a [[Scale (map)|graduated scale]] in the tradition of [[Pei Xiu]] (224\u2013271).{{sfn|Needham|1986a|pp=538\u2013540, 543}} The Tang chancellor [[Xu Jingzong]] (592\u2013672) was also known for his map of China drawn in the year 658.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} In the year 785 the [[Emperor Dezong of Tang|Emperor Dezong]] had the geographer and cartographer [[Jia Dan]] (730\u2013805) complete a map of China and her former colonies in Central Asia.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} Upon its completion in 801, the map was 9.1&nbsp;m (30&nbsp;ft) in length and 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft) in height, mapped out on a grid scale of one inch equaling one hundred ''[[li (unit)|li]]'' (Chinese unit of measuring distance).{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} A Chinese map of 1137 is similar in complexity to the one made by Jia Dan, carved on a stone stele with a grid scale of 100 li.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=Plate LXXXI}} However, the only type of map that has survived from the Tang period are [[star chart]]s. Despite this, [[Chinese cartography|the earliest extant terrain maps of China]] come from the ancient [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]]; maps from the 4th century BC that were excavated in 1986.{{sfn|Hsu|1993|p=90}}\n\n===Medicine===\nThe Chinese of the Tang era were also very interested in the benefits of officially classifying all of the [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicines]] used in [[pharmacology]]. In 657, [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]] (r. 649\u2013683) commissioned the literary project of publishing an official ''[[materia medica]]'', complete with text and illustrated drawings for 833 different medicinal substances taken from different stones, minerals, metals, plants, herbs, animals, vegetables, fruits, and cereal crops.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=235}} In addition to compiling pharmacopeias, the Tang fostered learning in medicine by upholding imperial medical colleges, state examinations for doctors, and publishing forensic manuals for physicians.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=83}} Authors of medicine in the Tang include Zhen Chuan (d. 643) and [[Sun Simiao]] (581\u2013682), the former who first identified in writing that patients with [[diabetes]] had an excess of sugar in their [[urine]], and the latter who was the first to recognize that diabetic patients should avoid consuming alcohol and [[starch]]y foods.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=132\u2013133}} As written by Zhen Chuan and others in the Tang, the [[thyroid]] glands of sheep and pigs were successfully used to treat [[goiter]]s; thyroid extracts were not used to treat patients with goiter in the West until 1890.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=134\u2013135}} The use of the [[Amalgam (dentistry)|dental amalgam]], manufactured from tin and silver, was first introduced in the medical text ''Xinxiu Bencao'' written by Su Gong in 659.<ref name=czarnetzki>{{cite journal|last=Czarnetzki|first=A.|author2=Ehrhardt S. |title=Re-dating the Chinese amalgam-filling of teeth in Europe|journal=International Journal of Anthropology|year=1990|volume=5|issue=4|pages=325\u2013332}}</ref>\n\n===Alchemy, gas cylinders, and air conditioning===\nChinese scientists of the Tang period employed complex chemical formulas for an array of different purposes, often found through experiments of [[alchemy]]. These included a [[waterproof]] and dust-repelling cream or [[varnish]] for clothes and weapons, [[fireproof]] cement for glass and porcelain wares, a waterproof cream applied to silk clothes of [[underwater diving|underwater divers]], a cream designated for polishing bronze mirrors, and many other useful formulas.{{sfn|Needham|1986e|p=452}} The vitrified, translucent ceramic known as [[porcelain]] was invented in China during the Tang, although many types of glazed ceramics preceded it.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=80}}{{sfn|Wood|1999|p=49}}\n\nEver since the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC \u2013 220 AD), the Chinese had drilled deep [[borehole]]s to transport natural gas from [[Pipeline transport|bamboo pipelines]] to stoves where [[cast iron]] evaporation pans boiled [[brine]] to extract salt.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=78\u201379}} During the Tang dynasty, a [[gazetteer]] of Sichuan province stated that at one of these 182&nbsp;m (600&nbsp;ft) 'fire wells', men collected natural gas into portable bamboo tubes which could be carried around for dozens of km (mi) and still produce a flame.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=79\u201380}} These were essentially the first [[gas cylinder]]s; Robert Temple assumes [[Tap (valve)|some sort of tap]] was used for this device.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=79\u201380}}\n\nThe inventor [[Ding Huan]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 180 AD) of the Han dynasty invented a [[Fan (mechanical)|rotary fan]] for [[air conditioning]], with seven wheels 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) in diameter and manually powered.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=99, 151, 233}} In 747, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] had a \"Cool Hall\" built in the imperial palace, which the ''[[Tang Yulin]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5510\u8a9e\u6797}}) describes as having water-powered fan wheels for air conditioning as well as rising jet streams of water from fountains.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=134, 151}} During the subsequent Song dynasty, written sources mentioned the air conditioning rotary fan as even more widely used.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=151}}\n\n==Historiography==\n{{See also|Chinese historiography}}\n\nThe first classic work about the Tang is the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' by Liu Xu (887\u2013946) et al. of the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]], who redacted it during the last years of his life. This was edited into another history (labelled the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'') in order to distinguish it, which was a work by the Song historians [[Ouyang Xiu]] (1007\u20131072), Song Qi (998\u20131061), et al. of the Song dynasty (between the years 1044 and 1060). Both of them were based upon earlier annals, yet those are now lost.<ref>{{cite book|author=Denis Crispin Twitchett |title=The Writing of Official History Under the T'ang |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-521-41348-0}}</ref> Both of them also rank among the ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'' of China. One of the surviving sources of the ''Old Book of Tang'', primarily covering up to 756, is the ''[[Tongdian]]'', which [[Du You]] presented to the emperor in 801. The Tang period was again placed into the enormous [[universal history]] text of the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', edited, compiled, and completed in 1084 by a team of scholars under the Song dynasty Chancellor [[Sima Guang]] (1019\u20131086). This historical text, written with three million [[Chinese characters]] in 294 volumes, covered the history of China from the beginning of the [[Warring States]] (403 BC) until the beginning of the Song dynasty (960).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China|History}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Chinese emperors family tree (middle)#Tang and Second Zhou Dynasties|The family tree of the Tang dynasty emperors]]\n* [[Di Renjie]]\n* [[Dongyi Protectorate]]\n* [[Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup]]\n* ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' (government newspaper for officials)\n* [[List of emperors of the Tang dynasty]]\n* [[List of tributaries of Imperial China]]\n* [[Nine Pinnacle Pagoda]]\n* [[Qianling Mausoleum]]\n* [[Tang dynasty in Inner Asia]]\n* [[Tang poetry]]\n* [[Taxation in premodern China]]\n* [[Wei Zheng]]\n* [[Yan Zhenqing]]\n* [[Yijing (monk)]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{citation |last=Adshead |first=S.A.M. |title = China in World History |edition=2nd |year=1995 |orig-year=1988 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] and St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-333-62132-5}}\n* {{citation |last=Adshead |first=S.A.M. |title = T'ang China: The Rise of the East in World History|year=2004|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4039-3456-7}}\n* {{citation |last=Andrew |first=Anita N. |last2=Rapp |first2=John A. |title=Autocracy and Cina's Rebel Founding Emperors: Comparing Chairman Mao and Ming Taizu |year=2000 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |location=Lanham |isbn=978-0-8476-9580-5}}\n* {{citation |last=Bai |first=Shouyi|authorlink=Bai Shouyi |title = A History of Chinese Muslim (Vol. 2)|year=2003|publisher=Zhonghua Book Company |location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-101-02890-4}}\n* {{citation |last=Ball |first=Warwick |authorlink=Warwick Ball |title = Rome in the East: Transformation of an Empire |edition=2nd |year=2016 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-72078-6}}\n* {{citation |last=Beckwith|first=Christopher I.|title=The Tibetan Empire in Central Asia|year=1987|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-691-02469-1}}\n* {{citation |last=Benn|first=Charles|title=China's Golden Age: Everyday Life in the Tang dynasty|year=2002|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-517665-0}}\n* {{Citation |last=Bernhardt|first=Kathryn|date=July 1995|title=The Inheritance Right of Daughters: the Song Anomaly?|journal=Modern China|pages=269\u2013309}}\n* {{citation |last=Bowman|first=John S.|title=Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture|year=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}\n* {{citation |last=Brook|first=Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Brook (historian)|title=The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China|year=1998|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-22154-3|title-link=The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China }}\n* {{citation |last=Chen|first=Yan|title=Maritime Silk Route and Chinese-Foreign Cultural Exchanges|year=2002|publisher=Peking University Press|location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-301-03029-5}}\n* {{citation |last=Cui|first=Mingde|title=The History of Chinese Heqin|year=2005|publisher=Renmin Chubanshe|location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-01-004828-4}}\n* {{cite book |title=Tang China and the Collapse of the Uighur Empire: A Documentary History |author-first=Michael R. |author-last=Drompp |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB6DEdAxLOsC |series=Brill's Inner Asian Library |year=2004 |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-14129-2 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Drompp |first=Michael R. |authormask=3 |chapter=Late-Tang Foreign Relations: The Uyghur Crisis |title=Hawai'i Reader in Traditional Chinese Culture |editor1-last=Mair |editor1-first=Victor H. |editor2=Nancy S.

{"title_page": "List of state and territorial universities in the United States", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2013}}\n<span class=\"plainlinks\"></span>\nIn the [[United States]], a '''state college''' or '''state university''' is one of the [[Public university|public]] [[List of colleges and universities|colleges or universities]] funded by or associated with the [[State governments of the United States|state government]]. In some cases, these institutions of [[higher education|higher learning]] are part of a [[state university]] system, while in other cases they are not. Several [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] also administer public colleges and universities.\n\nAlthough most of these institutions are associated with state governments, a small number of public institutions are directly funded and governed by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], including the [[United States Service academies|service academies]], the [[Community College of the Air Force]], the [[Naval Postgraduate School]], the [[Air Force Institute of Technology]], the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]], military [[War College (disambiguation)|war college]]s and [[staff college]]s, and [[Haskell Indian Nations University]]. A few universities - [[Georgetown University]], [[Gallaudet University]], [[Howard University]], and [[American University]] - are private universities in the District of Columbia that are federally chartered by the United States Government. \n\nThese state, as well as private, universities are accredited by different regional, not national, accreditation agencies, including the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]], the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]], the [[Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities]], the [[Higher Learning Commission]], the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]], and the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]], depending on which region of the United States the university is located in. These accreditation agencies' approvals are critical to a university's operations and public reputation. If a university loses accreditation or is not accredited in the first place, students will be reluctant to either continue or enroll at the school because the degree will be seen as being worthless. In a worst-case scenario, a university can shut down completely. The aforementioned agencies are all recognized by the [[United States Department of Education]].\n\nMost state universities receive at least part of their funding from the state, although many have substantial income from [[tuition]] and fees, [[Financial endowment|endowment]] proceeds, donations (such as from alumni or philanthropists), and revenue from [[royalties]]. State universities usually offer lower tuition costs to in-state residents. According to the [[College Board]], public four-year colleges charge on average $7,605 per year in tuition and fees for full-time in-state students and $11,990 for out-of-state students.<ref>[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/pay/add-it-up/4494.html]</ref> Substantial financial support is also provided by the federal government, particularly through federal [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]].\n\nIn some states, e.g. [[Maryland]], [[Tennessee]], [[Indiana]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], there is a campus designated as the \"flagship\" campus in the state's university system, which generally is the most prestigious campus and the largest campus in student population, e.g. the [[University of Maryland College Park]] campus in the [[University System of Maryland]], the [[Indiana University Bloomington]] campus in the [[Indiana University (system)|Indiana University System]], the [[University of Tennessee Knoxville]] campus in the [[University of Tennessee System]], and the [[University of Washington]]'s Seattle campus in the University of Washington System.\n\nHowever, in some other states, the state universities are treated as equal partners; therefore there is no officially recognized flagship campus in the state's university system.<ref>[http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2012/02/29/krichert/a_single_outdated_word_board_president_addresses_u_i_flagship_fl Idaho] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130411025340/http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2012/02/29/krichert/a_single_outdated_word_board_president_addresses_u_i_flagship_fl |date=2013-04-11 }}</ref>\n\nThere are a number of states that have more than one university system, e.g. [[California]] with 2; [[Colorado]] with 2; [[Indiana]] with 2; [[New York (state)|New York]] with 2; [[Tennessee]] with 2; and [[Texas]] with 6 (the most).\n{{Education in the U.S.}}\n'''Notes:'''\n*As a general rule, schools are not alphabetized by their complete names, but rather by the names by which they are normally called. For example, in a list alphabetized by normal rules, \"Auburn University\" would precede \"University of Alabama,\" but the schools are virtually always referred to in popular conversation as \"Auburn\" and \"Alabama\" (followed by a campus identifier if required by the context). Therefore, in this article, \"Alabama\" precedes \"Auburn\".\n*The list includes some of the more common academic nicknames or acronyms used for certain colleges or universities, e.g. \"Ole Miss\" for the University of Mississippi, \"Idaho State\" for Idaho State University, or \"UNF\" for the University of North Florida, not the \"Rebels\", \"Bengals\", or \"Ospreys\", respectively. \n**To minimize any confusion regarding acronyms, either the first school listed or the school that is more nationally known having an acronym the same as another has the acronym provided, e.g. San Diego State University has the acronym \"SDSU\" included because it is listed before South Dakota State University, and Arizona State University has the acronym \"ASU\" given because it is better known nationally than Alabama State. In addition, only acronyms that are unique are given, e.g. \"UW Tacoma\" for the University of Washington's Tacoma campus or \"UNH\" for the University of New Hampshire. \n*The list also includes schools that grant first-professional doctorates only (e.g., [[medical school]]s, [[law school]]s, or [[Schools of veterinary medicine|veterinary schools]]) that are independent of any other school in a state system.\n*Satellite campuses that do not have accreditation separate from the mother institution are not included in the list, e.g. [[University of Washington Tacoma]] remains an integral part of the [[University of Washington]], which is based in Seattle. On the other hand, institutions like [[University of Houston\u2013Downtown]] and [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] are provided separate entries as they are considered independent, autonomous institutions. \n*To see a list of community colleges and technical centers in the United States that offer only [[associate's degrees]], visit the [[List of community colleges|community colleges list]].\n*To see a list of tribal colleges and universities in the United States, visit the [[List of tribal colleges and universities|tribal colleges and universities list]].\n*Non-[[bachelor's degree]]-granting institutions, such as [[graduate school]]s, are listed in ''italics''.\n\n<!---This list is for public 4 year regionally accredited state universities only, not for private or for-profit schools nor for community colleges. Technical institutions are to be listed here only if they either have 4 year degree programs or ''are'' 4 year colleges. Also, satellite campuses that do not have separate regional accreditation from the mother institution should NOT be included in the list. Tribal colleges and universities are on their own page due to the fact that tribal institutions are controlled and operated by various American Indian tribes (who have dual sovereignty in the United States), not states.!--->\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Alabama==\n*[[Alabama A&M University]] (Alabama A&M)\n*[[Alabama State University]] (Alabama State)\n*[[Athens State University]]\n*Auburn University system\n**[[Auburn University]] (Auburn) ([[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[Auburn University at Montgomery]]\n*[[Jacksonville State University]]\n*[[Troy University]]\n*[[University of Alabama System]]\n**[[University of Alabama]] (Alabama) ([[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] (UAB)\n**[[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH)\n*[[University of Montevallo]]\n*[[University of North Alabama]] (UNA)\n*[[University of South Alabama]] (USA)\n*[[University of West Alabama]] (UWA)\n\n==Alaska==\n*[[University of Alaska System]]\n**[[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] (UAF) ([[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[University of Alaska Anchorage]] (UAA)\n**[[University of Alaska Southeast]] (UAS)\n\n==Arizona==\n\n* [[Arizona Board of Regents]]\n**[[Arizona State University]] (ASU)\n**[[Northern Arizona University]] (NAU)\n**[[University of Arizona]]\n\n==Arkansas==\n*[[University of Arkansas System]]\n**[[University of Arkansas]] (Arkansas) ([[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[University of Arkansas\u2013Fort Smith]]\n**[[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]]\n**''[[University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences]]''\n**[[University of Arkansas at Monticello]]\n**[[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]]\n*[[Arkansas State University System]]\n**[[Arkansas State University]]\n*[[Arkansas Tech University]]\n*[[University of Central Arkansas]] (UCA, Central Arkansas)\n*[[Henderson State University]]\n*[[Southern Arkansas University]] (SAU)\n\n==California==\n*[[University of California]] system\n**[[University of California, Berkeley]] (UC Berkeley) \n**[[University of California, Davis]] (UC Davis)\n**[[University of California, Irvine]] (UC Irvine)\n**[[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA)\n**[[University of California, Merced]] (UC Merced)\n**[[University of California, Riverside]] (UC Riverside)\n**[[University of California, San Diego]] (UC San Diego)\n**''[[University of California, San Francisco]]''  (UCSF)\n**[[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (UCSB)\n**[[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (UC Santa Cruz)\n**''[[University of California, Hastings College of the Law]]'' (law school;

In some cases, these institutions of [[higher education|higher learning]] are part of a [[state university]] system, while in other cases they are not. Several [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] also administer public colleges and universities.\n\nAlthough most of these institutions are associated with state governments, a small number of public institutions are directly funded and governed by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], including the [[United States Service academies|service academies]], the [[Community College of the Air Force]], the [[Naval Postgraduate School]], the [[Air Force Institute of Technology]], the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]], military [[War College (disambiguation)|war college]]s and [[staff college]]s, and [[Haskell Indian Nations University]]. A few universities - [[Georgetown University]], [[Gallaudet University]], [[Howard University]], and [[American University]] - are private universities in the District of Columbia that are federally chartered by the United States Government. \n\nThese state, as well as private, universities are accredited by different regional, not national, accreditation agencies, including the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]], the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]], the [[Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities]], the [[Higher Learning Commission]], the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]], and the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]], depending on which region of the United States the university is located in. These accreditation agencies' approvals are critical to a university's operations and public reputation. If a university loses accreditation or is not accredited in the first place, students will be reluctant to either continue or enroll at the school because the degree will be seen as being worthless. In a worst-case scenario, a university can shut down completely. The aforementioned agencies are all recognized by the [[United States Department of Education]].\n\nMost state universities receive at least part of their funding from the state, although many have substantial income from [[tuition]] and fees, [[Financial endowment|endowment]] proceeds, donations (such as from alumni or philanthropists), and revenue from [[royalties]]. State universities usually offer lower tuition costs to in-state residents. According to the [[College Board]], public four-year colleges charge on average $7,605 per year in tuition and fees for full-time in-state students and $11,990 for out-of-state students.<ref>[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/pay/add-it-up/4494.html]</ref> Substantial financial support is also provided by the federal government, particularly through federal [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]].\n\nIn some states, e.g. [[Maryland]], [[Tennessee]], [[Indiana]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], there is a campus designated as the \"flagship\" campus in the state's university system, which generally is the most prestigious campus and the largest campus in student population, e.g. the [[University of Maryland College Park]] campus in the [[University System of Maryland]], the [[Indiana University Bloomington]] campus in the [[Indiana University (system)|Indiana University System]], the [[University of Tennessee Knoxville]] campus in the [[University of Tennessee System]], and the [[University of Washington]]'s Seattle campus in the University of Washington System.\n\nHowever, in some other states, the state universities are treated as equal partners; therefore there is no officially recognized flagship campus in the state's university system.<ref>[http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2012/02/29/krichert/a_single_outdated_word_board_president_addresses_u_i_flagship_fl Idaho] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130411025340/http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2012/02/29/krichert/a_single_outdated_word_board_president_addresses_u_i_flagship_fl |date=2013-04-11 }}</ref>\n\nThere are a number of states that have more than one university system, e.g. [[California]] with 2; [[Colorado]] with 2; [[Indiana]] with 2; [[New York (state)|New York]] with 2; [[Tennessee]] with 2; and [[Texas]] with 6 (the most).\n{{Education in the U.S.}}\n'''Notes:'''\n*As a general rule, schools are not alphabetized by their complete names, but rather by the names by which they are normally called. For example, in a list alphabetized by normal rules, \"Auburn University\" would precede \"University of Alabama,\" but the schools are virtually always referred to in popular conversation as \"Auburn\" and \"Alabama\" (followed by a campus identifier if required by the context). Therefore, in this article, \"Alabama\" precedes \"Auburn\".\n*The list includes some of the more common academic nicknames or acronyms used for certain colleges or universities, e.g. \"Ole Miss\" for the University of Mississippi, \"Idaho State\" for Idaho State University, or \"UNF\" for the University of North Florida, not the \"Rebels\", \"Bengals\", or \"Ospreys\", respectively. \n**To minimize any confusion regarding acronyms, either the first school listed or the school that is more nationally known having an acronym the same as another has the acronym provided, e.g. San Diego State University has the acronym \"SDSU\" included because it is listed before South Dakota State University, and Arizona State University has the acronym \"ASU\" given because it is better known nationally than Alabama State. In addition, only acronyms that are unique are given, e.g. \"UW Tacoma\" for the University of Washington's Tacoma campus or \"UNH\" for the University of New Hampshire. \n*The list also includes schools that grant first-professional doctorates only (e.g., [[medical school]]s, [[law school]]s, or [[Schools of veterinary medicine|veterinary schools]]) that are independent of any other school in a state system.\n*Satellite campuses that do not have accreditation separate from the mother institution are not included in the list, e.g. [[University of Washington Tacoma]] remains an integral part of the [[University of Washington]], which is based in Seattle. On the other hand, institutions like [[University of Houston\u2013Downtown]] and [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] are provided separate entries as they are considered independent, autonomous institutions. \n*To see a list of community colleges and technical centers in the United States that offer only [[associate's degrees]], visit the [[List of community colleges|community colleges list]].\n*To see a list of tribal colleges and universities in the United States, visit the [[List of tribal colleges and universities|tribal colleges and universities list]].\n*Non-[[bachelor's degree]]-granting institutions, such as [[graduate school]]s, are listed in ''italics''.\n\n<!---This list is for public 4 year regionally accredited state universities only, not for private or for-profit schools nor for community colleges. Technical institutions are to be listed here only if they either have 4 year degree programs or ''are'' 4 year colleges. Also, satellite campuses that do not have separate regional accreditation from the mother institution should NOT be included in the list. Tribal colleges and universities are on their own page due to the fact that tribal institutions are controlled and operated by various American Indian tribes (who have dual sovereignty in the United States), not states.!--->\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Alabama==\n*[[Alabama A&M University]] (Alabama A&M)\n*[[Alabama State University]] (Alabama State)\n*[[Athens State University]]\n*Auburn University system\n**[[Auburn University]] (Auburn) ([[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[Auburn University at Montgomery]]\n*[[Jacksonville State University]]\n*[[Troy University]]\n*[[University of Alabama System]]\n**[[University of Alabama]] (Alabama) ([[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] (UAB)\n**[[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH)\n*[[University of Montevallo]]\n*[[University of North Alabama]] (UNA)\n*[[University of South Alabama]] (USA)\n*[[University of West Alabama]] (UWA)\n\n==Alaska==\n*[[University of Alaska System]]\n**[[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] (UAF) ([[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[University of Alaska Anchorage]] (UAA)\n**[[University of Alaska Southeast]] (UAS)\n\n==Arizona==\n\n* [[Arizona Board of Regents]]\n**[[Arizona State University]] (ASU)\n**[[Northern Arizona University]] (NAU)\n**[[University of Arizona]]\n\n==Arkansas==\n*[[University of Arkansas System]]\n**[[University of Arkansas]] (Arkansas) ([[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[University of Arkansas\u2013Fort Smith]]\n**[[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]]\n**''[[University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences]]''\n**[[University of Arkansas at Monticello]]\n**[[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]]\n*[[Arkansas State University System]]\n**[[Arkansas State University]]\n*[[Arkansas Tech University]]\n*[[University of Central Arkansas]] (UCA, Central Arkansas)\n*[[Henderson State University]]\n*[[Southern Arkansas University]] (SAU)\n\n==California==\n*[[University of California]] system\n**[[University of California, Berkeley]] (UC Berkeley) \n**[[University of California, Davis]] (UC Davis)\n**[[University of California, Irvine]] (UC Irvine)\n**[[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA)\n**[[University of California, Merced]] (UC Merced)\n**[[University of California, Riverside]] (UC Riverside)\n**[[University of California, San Diego]] (UC San Diego)\n**''[[University of California, San Francisco]]''  (UCSF)\n**[[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (UCSB)\n**[[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (UC Santa Cruz)\n**''[[University of California, Hastings College of the Law]]'' (law school;

About growing up living across from Berra, Garagiola often quipped, \"Not only was I not the best catcher in the Major Leagues, I wasn't even the best catcher on my street!\"<ref name=\"Post\"/>\n\n==Baseball career==\n[[File:Joe Garagiola 1953.jpg|thumb|Garagiola with the Pirates]]\nGaragiola was signed at age 16 by the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] organization. At age 17, he remains the youngest player to play in [[Columbus Red Birds]] history. Garagiola advanced to Columbus of the Class AA American Association in 1943, and was with them when he was called into military service on April 24, 1944. After taking basic training at [[Jefferson Barracks, Missouri]], Garagiola was sent to [[Fort Riley, Kansas]], where he quickly established himself as the catcher for the Fort Riley Centaurs, with teammates Rex Barney and Pete Reiser.\n\nGaragiola was sent to the Philippines in 1945, where he played ball for Kirby Higbe's Manila Dodgers. He was discharged from service in early 1946, and he was just 20 years old when he joined the Cardinals. Garagiola made his major league debut in {{mlby||1946}}.\n\nAs a rookie in 1946, in his only [[1946 World Series|World Series]] appearance, Garagiola batted a 6-for-19 in five games, including a Game 4 where he went 4-for-5 with three RBIs. By contrast, [[Ted Williams]] went only 5-for-25 in the same series, which was Williams' only World Series appearance. On September 11, 1947, Joe Garagiola and [[Jackie Robinson]] were involved in an incident at home plate. Garagiola allegedly stepped on Robinson's foot and the two argued. Umpire [[Beans Reardon]] held back Garagiola while Robinson clapped.<ref>{{cite book |title=Opening Day: The Story of Jackie Robinson's First Season |url=https://archive.org/details/openingdaystoryo00eigj_0 |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/openingdaystoryo00eigj_0/page/228 228] |first=Jonathan |last=Eig |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2007 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7432-9461-4}}</ref> The incident was later part of a children's book titled ''In the Year of the Boar and Jackie Robinson''.\n\nGaragiola never quite lived up to the promise of his youth, appearing in only 676 games over nine seasons for four [[National League]] teams. He was a mediocre (though certainly good for a catcher) hitter in the majors, which featured in his self-deprecating humor. He once told this story himself: \"He knew that it was time to retire when he was catching, and his ex-teammate [[Stan Musial]] stepped into the batter's box, turned to Joe, and said, ''\"When are you gonna quit?\"''\"\n\nLooking back at his career in 1970, Garagiola observed, \"It's not a record, but being traded four times when there are only eight teams in the league tells you something.

He began doing national baseball broadcasts for the network in {{mlby||1961}} (teaming with [[Bob Wolff]]). Additionally, Garagiola called several World Series on NBC Radio in the 1960s, teaming with a number of announcers including [[By Saam]] and [[George Kell]]. After a stint doing [[New York Yankees]] games from 1965 to 1967, which saw him call [[Mickey Mantle]]'s 500th home run, Garagiola returned to broadcasting NBC baseball, initially as the host of the pre-game show ''The Baseball World of Joe Garagiola'', and then as a play-by-play announcer beginning in 1974.\n\nGaragiola alternated play-by-play duties with [[Curt Gowdy]] on NBC until 1976, when he assumed the role full-time. He teamed with [[color commentator]] [[Tony Kubek]] from 1976 to 1982; in 1983, he shifted to color commentary as [[Vin Scully]] joined the network as lead play-by-play announcer. (Kubek joined [[Bob Costas]] to form NBC's #2 baseball announcing duo in this era.) Besides working on the ''Saturday Game of the Week'' for NBC, the team of Scully and Garagiola called three All-Star Games ([[1983 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1983]], [[1985 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1985]], and [[1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1987]]), three [[National League Championship Series]] ([[1983 National League Championship Series|1983]], [[1985 National League Championship Series|1985]], and [[1987 National League Championship Series|1987]]), and three World Series ([[1984 World Series|1984]], [[1986 World Series|1986]], and [[1988 World Series|1988]]).\n\nAfter calling a final World Series with Scully in 1988, Garagiola resigned from the network {{nowrap|in November.<ref name=\"lmtresnb\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_nlfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uy8MAAAAIBAJ&pg=3508%2C2316240 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho) |agency=Associated Press |title=Sportscaster Garagiola quits NBC |date=November 9, 1988 |page=1B}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Larry |date=November 9, 1988 |title=Garagiola Leaves Job With NBC : Baseball Commentator Upset Network Didn't Begin Negotiations |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-09/sports/sp-221_1_baseball-commentator-joe-garagiola |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |location= |access-date=}}</ref>}} His slot on NBC's baseball broadcast would be subsequently filled by [[Tom Seaver]].\n\nAfter leaving NBC Sports, Garagiola spent one season ([[1990 California Angels season|1990]]) as a cable-television commentator for the [[California Angels]].

Garagiola officially announced his retirement from broadcasting {{nowrap|on February 22, 2013.}}\n\n=== Other broadcasting ventures ===\nBesides calling baseball games for NBC, Garagiola served as a co-host on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' from 1967 to 1973 and again from 1990 to 1992. He also occasionally guest-hosted ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', including the only live appearances of any members of [[The Beatles]] on the program while still a group (John Lennon and Paul McCartney were the guests in May 1968).\n\nIn the late 1960s and 1970s, Garagiola also hosted the game shows ''[[He Said, She Said (game show)|He Said, She Said]]''; ''[[Joe Garagiola's Memory Game]]''; ''[[Sale of the Century (U.S. game show)|Sale of the Century]]''; and  ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', as well as the short-lived  ''[[Strike It Rich (1986 game show)|Strike It Rich]]''. Garagiola was a guest celebrity panelist on ''[[Match Game]]'' in the late 1970s. He hosted the St. Louis area professional wrestling show, titled ''[[Wrestling at the Chase]]'' for 3 years from 1959\u20131962 (his brother, Mickey, was the wrestling show's [[ring announcer]]), and was a regular host of the Orange Bowl Parade in Miami on New Year's Eve. Garagiola later gained a new form of fame as co-host of the [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]] for USA Network from 1994 to 2002.\n\n{{quote box|align=right|width=50%|quote=I say to some people 'I played in the World Series, and I broadcast the World Series.

During the 1960s, he also contributed commentaries to ''Monitor'' for several years and had a daily five-minute morning drivetime sports commentary program on the network.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1983, his name was attached to the [[PGA Tour]]'s [[Tucson Open]] tournament, broadcast by NBC.<ref name=\"msttwn\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AEosAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uc0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=3333%2C2287636 |work=Spartanburg Herald |location=(South Carolina) |agency=Associated Press |title=Miller snaps tie to win Tucson Open |date=January 12, 1981 |page=B1 }}</ref>\n\nOne of Garagiola's first appearances on TV was in 1960 when he appeared onstage at a campaign event for [[John F.

During the fall campaign, the [[Republican National Committee]] hired Garagiola to do a series of television ads with Ford; the ads consisted of Garagiola talking to Ford in a relaxed, informal setting. Derided by Ford's critics as \"The Joe and Jerry Show\", the ads in their opinion were considered to have negatively affected the Ford campaign.\n\nThe two men became close friends and on election night in November 1976, Ford invited Garagiola to be one of his guests at the [[White House]] to watch the results on television. Ford lost to Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]], the former governor of Georgia.\n\n=== Advocacy against chewing tobacco ===\nGaragiola was an advocate against the use of [[chewing tobacco]]. He had picked up the habit during his playing days with the Cardinals, but quit [[cold turkey]] in the late-1950s. He annually visited major league teams during [[spring training]] with players from his generation who have suffered from [[oral cancer]] related to the addiction.<ref name=\"gvecseynyt\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/sports/baseball/30vecsey.html?hp Vecsey, George. \"Garagiola, Who Quit, Warns About Chewing Tobacco,\" ''The New York Times'', Sunday, May 30, 2010.]</ref>\n\n=== Society for American Baseball Research ===\nGaragiola was the keynote luncheon speaker at the 2007 convention of the [[Society for American Baseball Research]] held in St. Louis.\n\n== Honors ==\nGaragiola was inducted into the [[Missouri Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1970.

About growing up living across from Berra, Garagiola often quipped, \"Not only was I not the best catcher in the Major Leagues, I wasn't even the best catcher on my street!\"<ref name=\"Post\"/>\n\n==Baseball career==\n[[File:Joe Garagiola 1953.jpg|thumb|Garagiola with the Pirates]]\nGaragiola was signed at age 16 by the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] organization. At age 17, he remains the youngest player to play in [[Columbus Red Birds]] history. Garagiola advanced to Columbus of the Class AA American Association in 1943, and was with them when he was called into military service on April 24, 1944. After taking basic training at [[Jefferson Barracks, Missouri]], Garagiola was sent to [[Fort Riley, Kansas]], where he quickly established himself as the catcher for the Fort Riley Centaurs, with teammates Rex Barney and Pete Reiser.\n\nGaragiola was sent to the Philippines in 1945, where he played ball for Kirby Higbe's Manila Dodgers. He was discharged from service in early 1946, and he was just 20 years old when he joined the Cardinals. Garagiola made his major league debut in {{Baseball year|1946}}.\n\nAs a rookie in 1946, in his only [[1946 World Series|World Series]] appearance, Garagiola batted a 6-for-19 in five games, including a Game 4 where he went 4-for-5 with three RBIs. By contrast, [[Ted Williams]] went only 5-for-25 in the same series, which was Williams' only World Series appearance. On September 11, 1947, Joe Garagiola and [[Jackie Robinson]] were involved in an incident at home plate. Garagiola allegedly stepped on Robinson's foot and the two argued. Umpire [[Beans Reardon]] held back Garagiola while Robinson clapped.<ref>{{cite book |title=Opening Day: The Story of Jackie Robinson's First Season |url=https://archive.org/details/openingdaystoryo00eigj_0 |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/openingdaystoryo00eigj_0/page/228 228] |first=Jonathan |last=Eig |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2007 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7432-9461-4}}</ref> The incident was later part of a children's book titled ''In the Year of the Boar and Jackie Robinson''.\n\nGaragiola never quite lived up to the promise of his youth, appearing in only 676 games over nine seasons for four [[National League]] teams. He was a mediocre (though certainly good for a catcher) hitter in the majors, which featured in his self-deprecating humor. He once told this story himself: \"He knew that it was time to retire when he was catching, and his ex-teammate [[Stan Musial]] stepped into the batter's box, turned to Joe, and said, ''\"When are you gonna quit?\"''\"\n\nLooking back at his career in 1970, Garagiola observed, \"It's not a record, but being traded four times when there are only eight teams in the league tells you something.

He began doing national baseball broadcasts for the network in {{Baseball year|1961}} (teaming with [[Bob Wolff]]). Additionally, Garagiola called several World Series on NBC Radio in the 1960s, teaming with a number of announcers including [[By Saam]] and [[George Kell]]. After a stint doing [[New York Yankees]] games from 1965 to 1967, which saw him call [[Mickey Mantle]]'s 500th home run, Garagiola returned to broadcasting NBC baseball, initially as the host of the pre-game show ''The Baseball World of Joe Garagiola'', and then as a play-by-play announcer beginning in 1974.\n\nGaragiola alternated play-by-play duties with [[Curt Gowdy]] on NBC until 1976, when he assumed the role full-time. He teamed with [[color commentator]] [[Tony Kubek]] from 1976 to 1982; in 1983, he shifted to color commentary as [[Vin Scully]] joined the network as lead play-by-play announcer. (Kubek joined [[Bob Costas]] to form NBC's #2 baseball announcing duo in this era.) Besides working on the ''Saturday Game of the Week'' for NBC, the team of Scully and Garagiola called three All-Star Games ([[1983 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1983]], [[1985 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1985]], and [[1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1987]]), three [[National League Championship Series]] ([[1983 National League Championship Series|1983]], [[1985 National League Championship Series|1985]], and [[1987 National League Championship Series|1987]]), and three World Series ([[1984 World Series|1984]], [[1986 World Series|1986]], and [[1988 World Series|1988]]).\n\nAfter calling a final World Series with Scully in 1988, Garagiola resigned from the network {{nowrap|in November.<ref name=\"lmtresnb\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_nlfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uy8MAAAAIBAJ&pg=3508%2C2316240 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho) |agency=Associated Press |title=Sportscaster Garagiola quits NBC |date=November 9, 1988 |page=1B}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Larry |date=November 9, 1988 |title=Garagiola Leaves Job With NBC : Baseball Commentator Upset Network Didn't Begin Negotiations |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-09/sports/sp-221_1_baseball-commentator-joe-garagiola |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |location= |access-date=}}</ref>}} His slot on NBC's baseball broadcast would be subsequently filled by [[Tom Seaver]].\n\nAfter leaving NBC Sports, Garagiola spent one season ([[1990 California Angels season|1990]]) as a cable-television commentator for the [[California Angels]]. From [[1998 Arizona Diamondbacks season|1998]] to [[2010 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2012]], he performed part-time color commentary duties for the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], where his son [[Joe Garagiola Jr.|Joe Jr.]] was general manager. Garagiola officially announced his retirement from broadcasting {{nowrap|on February 22, 2013.}}\n\n=== Other broadcasting ventures ===\nBesides calling baseball games for NBC, Garagiola served as a co-host on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' from 1967 to 1973 and again from 1990 to 1992. He also occasionally guest-hosted ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', including the only live appearances of any members of [[The Beatles]] on the program while still a group (John Lennon and Paul McCartney were the guests in May 1968).\n\nIn the late 1960s and 1970s, Garagiola also hosted the game shows ''[[He Said, She Said (game show)|He Said, She Said]]''; ''[[Joe Garagiola's Memory Game]]''; ''[[Sale of the Century (U.S. game show)|Sale of the Century]]''; and  ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', as well as the short-lived  ''[[Strike It Rich (1986 game show)|Strike It Rich]]''. Garagiola was a guest celebrity panelist on ''[[Match Game]]'' in the late 1970s. He hosted the St. Louis area professional wrestling show, titled ''[[Wrestling at the Chase]]'' for 3 years from 1959\u20131962 (his brother, Mickey, was the wrestling show's [[ring announcer]]), and was a regular host of the Orange Bowl Parade in Miami on New Year's Eve. Garagiola later gained a new form of fame as co-host of the [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]] for USA Network from 1994 to 2002.\n\n{{quote box|align=right|width=50%|quote=I say to some people 'I played in the World Series, and I broadcast the World Series.

(A link to a sample of his hosting is found below.) During the 1960s, he also contributed commentaries to ''Monitor'' for several years and had a daily five-minute morning drivetime sports commentary program on the network.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1983, his name was attached to the [[PGA Tour]]'s [[Tucson Open]] tournament, broadcast by NBC.<ref name=\"msttwn\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AEosAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uc0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=3333%2C2287636 |work=Spartanburg Herald |location=(South Carolina) |agency=Associated Press |title=Miller snaps tie to win Tucson Open |date=January 12, 1981 |page=B1 }}</ref>\n\nOne of Garagiola's first appearances on TV was in 1960 when he appeared onstage at a campaign event for [[John F. Kennedy]]. Surrounded by important politicians, including former President [[Harry S.

Testifying before Judge [[Irving Ben Cooper]] in New York, Garagiola defended the clause, a stance he later deemed a \"terrible mistake.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Snyder |first=Brad |title=A Well-Paid Slave: Curt Flood's Fight for Free Agency in Professional Sports |location=New York |publisher=Viking Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-670-03794-X |pages=180\u2013181, 342}}</ref>\n\n=== Politics ===\n[[File:Joe Garagiola-Gerald Ford.jpg|right|thumb|Garagiola and [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford|Ford]] watching the returns for 1976 presidential election, for which they'd done a series of television ads together]]\nIn the 1976 presidential election, Garagiola enthusiastically supported the candidacy of President [[Gerald Ford]]. During the fall campaign, the [[Republican National Committee]] hired Garagiola to do a series of television ads with Ford; the ads consisted of Garagiola talking to Ford in a relaxed, informal setting. Derided by Ford's critics as \"The Joe and Jerry Show\", the ads in their opinion were considered to have negatively affected the Ford campaign.\n\nThe two men became close friends and on election night in November 1976, Ford invited Garagiola to be one of his guests at the [[White House]] to watch the results on television. Ford lost to Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]], the former governor of Georgia.\n\n=== Advocacy against chewing tobacco ===\nGaragiola was an advocate against the use of [[chewing tobacco]]. He had picked up the habit during his playing days with the Cardinals, but quit [[cold turkey]] in the late-1950s. He annually visited major league teams during [[spring training]] with players from his generation who have suffered from [[oral cancer]] related to the addiction.<ref name=\"gvecseynyt\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/sports/baseball/30vecsey.html?hp Vecsey, George. \"Garagiola, Who Quit, Warns About Chewing Tobacco,\" ''The New York Times'', Sunday, May 30, 2010.]</ref>\n\n=== Society for American Baseball Research ===\nGaragiola was the keynote luncheon speaker at the 2007 convention of the [[Society for American Baseball Research]] held in St. Louis.\n\n== Honors ==\nGaragiola was inducted into the [[Missouri Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1970.
