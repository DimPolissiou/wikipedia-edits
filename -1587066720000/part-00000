[https://books.google.com/books?id=zd_WTZZjvqkC&pg=PA9 ''Reading the Rabbit: Explorations in Warner Bros. Animation''], p. 9. Rutgers University Press. {{ISBN|0813525381}}</ref> She is [[Bugs Bunny]]'s girlfriend, and was created as the \"female merchandising counterpart\" of the character. \n\n==''Space Jam''==\nLola first appeared in the 1996 film ''[[Space Jam]]''. She is shown with tan fur, blonde bangs, and wears a purple rubber band on both ears like a ponytail. She has aqua colored eyes and a slim hourglass figure. Lola is voiced by [[Kath Soucie]] in the film.\n\nLola was created to serve as a [[romantic interest]] for Bugs. Lola has a \"curvaceous body\", wears tight clothes, and poses seductively when she first appears on screen. In response, Bugs is instantly smitten and several other male characters ogle her.<ref name=\"Sandler\">Sandler (2001), p. 141-143</ref> Lola demonstrates her basketball skills, and the film makes use of a \"[[Tex Avery]]-style\" gag concerning the male [[libido]]: Bugs floats up into the air before crashing back down to the floor. The scene is reminiscent of \"Wolfie\" from ''[[Red Hot Riding Hood]]'' (1943), a Tex Avery-created character defined by his exaggerated [[wolf whistle]].\n\nThroughout the film, there is a sub-plot of whether there will be a romance between Lola and Bugs. The sub-plot concludes with a conventional resolution. Lola is nearly injured by one of the opponents in the basketball game, and Bugs rescues her. Bugs receives her grateful kiss during the game, and kisses her back following its end, with Lola reacting in her own Tex Avery-style gag on female libido.<ref name=\"Sandler\"/>\n\nLola's personality is a combination of the [[Hawksian woman]], [[tomboy]], and [[femme fatale]] archetypes.<ref name=\"Sandler\"/> She is a tough talking, no-nonsense woman who is extremely independent and self-reliant. She is both highly athletic and extremely seductive in her behavior. Her catchphrase is \"Don't ever call me 'Doll'.\"<ref name=\"Sandler\"/> As animation director [[Tony Cervone]] explained, Lola was originally intended to be more of a \"[[tomboy]]\", but the production team feared that she would appear \"too [[Masculinity|masculine]]\". So they chose to emphasize her \"feminine attributes\" as well.<ref name=\"Sandler\"/>\n\nShe will return in ''[[Space Jam 2]]'', voiced again by Soucie.\n\n==''The Looney Tunes Show''==\n[[File:LolaBunny.jpg|thumb|100px|Lola Bunny as seen in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]''.]]\nLola also appears in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'', where she was voiced by [[Kristen Wiig]]. As opposed to her personality in ''Space Jam'', she is portrayed as a scatterbrained, indecisive, gabby young rabbit who tends to obsess over Bugs, whom she refers to as \"Bun-Bun.\"<ref>''Vanguardia'' (Mexico) (15 August 2011).

She's unable to settle on a decision, even for something as simple as what she wants to drink. While she is overly talkative to the point of irritation, Bugs nevertheless appears to enjoy having her around, even surprising himself when declaring himself her boyfriend in \"[[List of The Looney Tunes Show episodes#Season 1: 2011\u20132012|Double Date]]\" where she helped Daffy get the courage to ask [[Tina Russo]] out on a date. Later in the series, Bugs and Lola are seen in multiple episodes spending time with each other.\n\nLola's wealthy parents Walter (voiced by [[John O'Hurley]]) and Patricia (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]] in season 1, [[Wendi McLendon-Covey]] in season 2) appear in the show as well.\n\nThis version of the character appeared in the [[Direct-to-video|straight-to-video]] movie ''[[Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Chitwood |first=Adam |url=http://collider.com/looney-runes-rabbits-run-trailer-teases-new-animated-movie/ |title=Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run Trailer Teases New Animated Movie |website=Collider.com |date=2015-04-30 |accessdate=2016-09-28}}</ref> voiced by [[Rachel Ramras]].\n\n== Voice actors ==\nSince Lola Bunny\u2019s first Looney Tunes appearance in 1996, the cartoon character has been voiced by a variety of voice actors. For the majority of the [[Looney Tunes]] series, Bunny\u2019s character was voiced by [[Kath Soucie]], an American actress and voice actress. Soucie has played Bunny\u2019s voice actress for: Wabbit (2015), Looney Tunes Dance Off (2010), Looney Tunes Webtoons (2001), ''[[Looney Tunes: Space Race]]'' (2000), ''[[Looney Tunes Racing]]'' &nbsp;(2000), [[Tweety's High-Flying Adventure|''Tweety\u2019s High-Flying Adventure'']] &nbsp;(2000), and ''[[Space Jam]]'' (1996).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Looney-Tunes/Lola-Bunny/|title=Lola Bunny Voice - Looney Tunes franchise|website=Behind The Voice Actors|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> Additionally, [[Britt McKillip]] was Bunny\u2019s voice actress in 2003\u2019s [[Baby Looney Tunes' Eggs-traordinary Adventure|''Baby Looney Tunes: Eggs-traordinary Adventure'']] and 2002\u2019s ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0571741/|title=Britt McKillip|website=IMDb|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> In 2011, American actress, comedian, writer, and producer, [[Kristen Wiig]], voiced Bunny\u2019s character in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]''.

Like her older counterpart, she has tomboyish traits and an affinity for basketball.<ref>Erickson, Hal (ed.) (2005). ''Television Cartoon Shows: An Illustrated Encyclopedia, 1949 through 2003'', 2nd edition, p. 105. McFarland & Co. {{ISBN|0786422556}}</ref>\n\nOther appearances include her role as the reporter in the [[direct-to-video]] film ''[[Tweety's High-Flying Adventure]]''. She also appeared as a playable character in the 1998 game ''[[Bugs Bunny & Lola Bunny: Operation Carrot Patch]]'' and the 2000 game ''[[Looney Tunes Racing]]''. She was also a news reporter in the game ''[[Looney Tunes: Space Race]]'' also in 2000.\n\nIn the action comedy ''[[Loonatics Unleashed]]'', her descendant is Lexi Bunny.<ref>''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' (17 September 2005).

Lola Bunny was also featured in a [[webtoon]] on looneytunes.com, entitled \"Dating Dos and Don'ts.\" During this webtoon, in the form of a fifties [[educational film]], Bugs Bunny attempts to take Lola out on a date, but [[Elmer Fudd]] and Lola's disapproving dad (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) hinder him.\n\nShe appears in the ''[[New Looney Tunes]]'' segments \"Hare to the Throne\", \"Lola Rider\" and \"Rhoda Derby\", where she is once again voiced by her original voice actress, [[Kath Soucie]].

[https://books.google.com/books?id=zd_WTZZjvqkC&pg=PA9 ''Reading the Rabbit: Explorations in Warner Bros. Animation''], p. 9. Rutgers University Press. {{ISBN|0813525381}}</ref> She is [[Bugs Bunny]]'s girlfriend, and was created as the \"female merchandising counterpart\" of the character. \n\n==''Space Jam''==\nLola first appeared in the 1996 film ''[[Space Jam]]''. She is shown with tan fur, blonde bangs, and wears a purple rubber band on both ears like a ponytail. She has aqua colored eyes and a slim hourglass figure. Lola is voiced by [[Kath Soucie]] in the film.\n\nLola was created to serve as a [[romantic interest]] for Bugs. Lola has a \"curvaceous body\", wears tight clothes, and poses seductively when she first appears on screen. In response, Bugs is instantly smitten and several other male characters ogle her.<ref name=\"Sandler\">Sandler (2001), p. 141-143</ref> Lola demonstrates her basketball skills, and the film makes use of a \"[[Tex Avery]]-style\" gag concerning the male [[libido]]: Bugs floats up into the air before crashing back down to the floor. The scene is reminiscent of \"Wolfie\" from ''[[Red Hot Riding Hood]]'' (1943), a Tex Avery-created character defined by his exaggerated [[wolf whistle]].\n\nThroughout the film, there is a sub-plot of whether there will be a romance between Lola and Bugs. The sub-plot concludes with a conventional resolution. Lola is nearly injured by one of the opponents in the basketball game, and Bugs rescues her. Bugs receives her grateful kiss during the game, and kisses her back following its end, with Lola reacting in her own Tex Avery-style gag on female libido.<ref name=\"Sandler\"/>\n\nLola's personality is a combination of the [[Hawksian woman]], [[tomboy]], and [[femme fatale]] archetypes.<ref name=\"Sandler\"/> She is a tough talking, no-nonsense woman who is extremely independent and self-reliant. She is both highly athletic and extremely seductive in her behavior. Her catchphrase is \"Don't ever call me doll.\"<ref name=\"Sandler\"/> As animation director [[Tony Cervone]] explained, Lola was originally intended to be more of a \"[[tomboy]]\", but the production team feared that she would appear \"too [[Masculinity|masculine]]\". So they chose to emphasize her \"feminine attributes\" as well.<ref name=\"Sandler\"/>\n\nShe will return in ''[[Space Jam 2]]'', voiced again by Soucie.\n\n==''The Looney Tunes Show''==\n[[File:LolaBunny.jpg|thumb|100px|Lola Bunny as seen in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]''.]]\nLola also appears in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'', where she was voiced by [[Kristen Wiig]]. As opposed to her personality in ''Space Jam'', she is portrayed as a scatterbrained, indecisive, gabby young rabbit who tends to obsess over Bugs, whom she refers to as \"Bun-Bun.\"<ref>''Vanguardia'' (Mexico) (15 August 2011).

She's unable to settle on a decision, even for something as simple as what she wants to drink. While she is overly talkative to the point of irritation, Bugs nevertheless appears to enjoy having her around, even surprising himself when declaring himself her boyfriend in \"[[List of The Looney Tunes Show episodes#Season 1: 2011\u20132012|Double Date]]\" where she helped Daffy get the courage to ask [[Tina Russo]] out on a date. Later in the series, Bugs and Lola are seen in multiple episodes spending time with each other.\n\nLola's wealthy parents Walter (voiced by [[John O'Hurley]]) and Patricia (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]] in season 1, [[Wendi McLendon-Covey]] in season 2) appear in the show as well.\n\nThis version of the character appeared in the [[Direct-to-video|straight-to-video]] movie ''[[Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Chitwood |first=Adam |url=http://collider.com/looney-runes-rabbits-run-trailer-teases-new-animated-movie/ |title=Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run Trailer Teases New Animated Movie |website=Collider.com |date=2015-04-30 |accessdate=2016-09-28}}</ref> voiced by [[Rachel Ramras]].\n\n== Voice actors ==\nSince Lola Bunny\u2019s first Looney Tunes appearance in 1996, the cartoon character has been voiced by a variety of voice actors.

After Emancipation, she moved to Chicago and worked as a maid until she married realtor Rubin Elam.  \n\nSeeing the tremendous need for housing and guidance for the many single African American girls and women migrating into the city, Mrs. Elam purchased a home at 4555 South Champlain in 1923 and opened it as the Melissia Anne Elam Home for Working Women and Girls.  Mrs. Elam and Isadore Anna Drell purchased the home at 4726 South Park Way in 1926, when demand outgrew space in the Champlain residence.   Between the 1930s and the 1950s, Elam Home often housed over 30 women and girls at a time.

Mrs. Elam willed Elam House to Centers for New Horizons, Inc. Centers for New Horizons is a not for profit social service agency that serves the Bronzeville and Riverdale communities on the Southside of Chicago, Illinois.  Ms. Elam stipulated to Centers for New Horizons in her will that her home be kept in service to the community.  She entrusted the home to a group of African American women, who maintained the home as a boarding home.  As times changed, fewer women sought housing in boarding homes like Mrs. Elam\u2019s, and the population of Elam House declined, although several women continued to live there well into the 1970s.  The Friends of Elam House Foundation was created in 1974 by Margaret Burroughs. At risk of being torn down due to numerous building violations, the Friends of Elam House Foundation raised funds to address these violations and try to attain landmark status.
