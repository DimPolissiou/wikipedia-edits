That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150927/http://www.raisport.rai.it/pub/sezione/raiSportSezioneIndex/0%2C5785%2C_205_60_1416%2C00.html|title= Zamparini Interview|language=Italian|publisher=raisport.it}}</ref> who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]].
