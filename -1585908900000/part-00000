Rachel's team is called to the scene of the kidnapping, and Carey calls in her contacts to identify Emery with [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition]].

Emery attempts to track down Roberts himself, and with help from a friend breaks into her flat. He notices somebody else inside and gives chase, getting into a [[black cab]] to follow the man\u2019s vehicle. This activity is noticed by homicide detectives DS Patrick Flynn and DS Nadia Latif, who began following Emery despite lacking evidence for a warrant, and by Carey via [[CCTV]] in the Counter Terrorism command centre. The taxi driver locks Emery in the car and drives him to a house in [[Eaton Square]], where he is escorted inside by armed men.

The Eaton Square house is raided by [[SCO19]], but police are unable to find Emery. Carey searches for the earlier footage of him entering, but it is not found. Emery escapes from the Americans and confronts Marcus Levy, a video engineer who helped with his appeal. Levy tells him that although [[deepfake]] technology does exist, there is no way to alter live footage. However, Levy later meets with Carey and hypothesises that footage of Emery and Roberts could have been delayed slightly then altered, using a passing bus as cover for a [[Film transition|transition shot]]. Emery meets Matt and sees that he has not been tortured. Emery leaves London in Matt\u2019s car, but Matt tips off the police. Pulling into a scrapyard, Emery discovers Roberts's body in the boot.

Before overpowering her and escaping in her car, Emery tells her he was actually taken to Gastor Square. Forced to abandon the police vehicle, Emery is kidnapped by two people calling themselves Alma and Kenny, who show him a [[GPS tracker]] in his shoe, and dispose of it. Carey and Flynn deduce the actual location Emery was taken to in Belgravia and are met by Napier, who asks them to leave. Marcus Levy is attacked and put into a coma by Napier's men. After defying Garland's orders by trying to have Roberts's body relocated by the [[coroner]], Carey is suspended from duty, accused of [[perverting the course of justice]]. She confronts Hart in [[The Shard]], but he warns her to tread carefully and think about why Roberts, a [[human rights]] lawyer, would choose to represent Emery. Flynn uncovers footage showing that Roberts did get on the bus that evening. Using an [[air gap (networking)|airgapped]] phone with a map of CCTV blind spots, Alma takes Emery to an industrial nightclub.

After Roberts goes into hiding, Garland, Hart and Napier begin to suspect the footage is a stunt to expose their practices, and Napier decides to make the false story \u201ctrue\u201d and kill Roberts, . After interrogating Eli, Napier and his men track Roberts to a [[safe house]], where she is killed. Hart informs Carey, and she leaves with Flynn, disgusted. Wanting Emery to be re-arrested, Hall\u2019s group tips off the police, who surround the club, but Emery is able to escape with the assistance of Carey and Flynn.

He confronts Charlie Hall and attacks him, but is intercepted by Garland, who allows him to visit his daughter. Napier is met by Jessica Mallory, a senior official with the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]]. Carey confronts them and demands that she be reinstated and Emery be removed as a suspect, or she will send the footage of Roberts on the bus to the [[Director of Public Prosecutions|DPP]] and the [[IOPC]]. They remotely corrupt Flynn\u2019s USB drive so he cannot upload the footage. After spending time with his child under supervision Emery is met by Napier, who reveals the whole meeting was filmed and will be altered to show him abusing her unless he confesses to killing Roberts. Emery agrees and pleads guilty to [[manslaughter]] on grounds of [[diminished responsibility]]. After sentencing, Garland defends the practice of correction to Carey, saying that they only fake events that actually occurred. She urges Carey to join them. Emery is visited in prison by his ex-partner, who Carey told he was innocent of killing Roberts. He claims justice has now caught up with him, and confesses he did murder the unarmed insurgent. Eli is diplomatically repatriated by Mallory, as the [[Federal government of the United States|executive branch]] wants to leak the idea of correction as a [[conspiracy theory]], thus giving them deniability. Carey hides an [[SD card]] containing a copy of the real bus footage, but then returns to [[Counter Terrorism Command]] and asks Hart and Garland when she can start working for them. \n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nThe series was reviewed positively by critics; it currently holds a 100% approval rating on [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_capture/s01|title=The Capture: Series 1|via=www.rottentomatoes.com}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' awarded the episode four stars, labelling the series as \"riveting\",<ref name=\"TelegraphEp1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2019/09/03/capture-episode-1-review-exactly-sort-drama-need-fake-news-era/|title=The Capture, episode 1 review: exactly the sort of drama we need in this fake news era|first=Chris|last=Harvey|date=3 September 2019|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> and ''[[The Independent]]'' also awarded it four stars, designating it an \"intriguing, but rather flawed, sort of ''[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]'' thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping\".<ref name=\"TelegraphEp1\" /> In his review in ''[[The Times]]'' James Jackson referred to the drama as a \"neatly structured thriller... clearly out to interrogate surveillance culture\", also awarding four stars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-capture-review-the-camera-always-lies-in-this-paranoid-thriller-7tmwtpn7x|title=The Capture review \u2014 the camera always lies in this paranoid thriller|first=James|last=Jackson|date=4 September 2019|via=www.thetimes.co.uk}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' was less enthusiastic, concluding it to be a \"twisty if lacklustre drama\", giving the opening episode only three stars out of five.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/03/the-capture-review-chillingly-real-thriller-or-utter-bobbins-lets-check-the-tape|title=The Capture review \u2013 chillingly real thriller or utter bobbins?

The Eaton Square house is raided by [[SCO19]], but police are unable to find Emery. Carey searches for the earlier footage of him entering, but it is not found. Emery escapes from the Americans and confronts Marcus Levy, a video engineer who helped with his appeal. Levy tells him that although [[deepfake]] technology does exist, there is no way to alter live footage. However, Levy later meets with Carey and hypothesises that footage of Emery and Roberts could have been delayed slightly then altered, using a passing bus as cover for a [[Film transition|transition shot]]. Emery meets Matt and sees that he has not been tortured. Emery leaves London in Matt\u2019s car, but Matt tips off the police. Pulling into a scrapyard, Emery discovers Roberts's body in the boot.

Before overpowering her and escaping in her car, Emery tells her he was actually taken to Gastor Square. Forced to abandon the police vehicle, Emery is kidnapped by two people calling themselves Alma and Kenny, who show him a [[GPS tracker]] in his shoe, and dispose of it. Carey and Flynn deduce the actual location Emery was taken to in Belgravia and are met by Napier, who asks them to leave. Marcus Levy is attacked and put into a coma by Napier's men. After defying Garland's orders by trying to have Roberts's body relocated by the [[coroner]], Carey is suspended from duty, accused of [[perverting the course of justice]]. She confronts Hart in [[The Shard]], but he warns her to tread carefully and think about why Roberts, a [[human rights]] lawyer, would choose to represent Emery. Flynn uncovers footage showing that Roberts did get on the bus that evening. Using an [[air gap (networking)|airgapped]] phone with a map of CCTV blind spots, Alma takes Emery to an industrial nightclub. She tells him about the covert intelligence practice of \"correction\", in which video evidence is manipulated to convict suspects. He is met by the man he saw in Roberts's flat, Kenny, and his former solicitor Charlie Hall.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = A Pilgrim of Justice\n |DirectedBy      = Ben Chanan\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|10|1|df=y}}\n |Viewers         = 6.04\n |ShortSummary    = The group shows Emery the original footage that proves his innocence, but tell him the alteration was not made by the [[British intelligence agencies|intelligence community]]. A series of [[Flashback_(narrative)|flashbacks]] show the lawyers working with the group to fake the footage of Emery attacking Roberts, helped by Eli, a [[whistleblower]] from Napier\u2019s team. They intended to reveal Roberts as alive after Emery\u2019s trial for her murder, and so uncover the practice of \u201ccorrection\u201d and exposing real [[Miscarriage of justice|miscarriages of justice]]. After Roberts goes into hiding, Garland, Hart and Napier begin to suspect the footage is a stunt to expose their practices, and Napier decides to make the false story \u201ctrue\u201d and kill Roberts, . After interrogating Eli, Napier and his men track Roberts to a [[safe house]], where she is killed. Hart informs Carey, and she leaves with Flynn, disgusted. Wanting Emery to be re-arrested, Hall\u2019s group tips off the police, who surround the club, but Emery is able to escape with the assistance of Carey and Flynn.

He confronts Charlie Hall and attacks him, but is intercepted by Garland, who allows him to visit his daughter. Napier is met by Jessica Mallory, a senior official with the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]]. Carey confronts them and demands that she be reinstated and Emery be removed as a suspect, or she will send the footage of Roberts on the bus to the [[Director of Public Prosecutions|DPP]] and the [[IOPC]]. They remotely corrupt Flynn\u2019s USB drive so he cannot upload the footage. After spending time with his child under supervision Emery is met by Napier, who reveals the whole meeting was filmed and will be altered to show him abusing her unless he confesses to killing Roberts. Emery agrees and pleads guilty to [[manslaughter]] on grounds of [[diminished responsibility]]. After sentencing, Garland defends the practice of correction to Carey, saying that they only fake events that actually occurred. She urges Carey to join them. Emery is visited in prison by his ex-partner, who Carey told he was innocent of killing Roberts. He claims justice has now caught up with him, and confesses he did murder the unarmed insurgent. Eli is diplomatically repatriated by Mallory, as the [[Federal government of the United States|executive branch]] wants to leak the idea of correction as a [[conspiracy theory]], thus giving them deniability. Carey hides an [[SD card]] containing a copy of the real bus footage, but then returns to [[Counter Terrorism Command]] and asks Hart and Garland when she can start working for them. \n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nThe series was reviewed positively by critics; it currently holds a 100% approval rating on [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_capture/s01|title=The Capture: Series 1|via=www.rottentomatoes.com}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' awarded the episode four stars, labelling the series as \"riveting\",<ref name=\"TelegraphEp1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2019/09/03/capture-episode-1-review-exactly-sort-drama-need-fake-news-era/|title=The Capture, episode 1 review: exactly the sort of drama we need in this fake news era|first=Chris|last=Harvey|date=3 September 2019|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> and ''[[The Independent]]'' also awarded it four stars, designating it an \"intriguing, but rather flawed, sort of ''[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]'' thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping\".<ref name=\"TelegraphEp1\" /> In his review in ''[[The Times]]'' James Jackson referred to the drama as a \"neatly structured thriller... clearly out to interrogate surveillance culture\", also awarding four stars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-capture-review-the-camera-always-lies-in-this-paranoid-thriller-7tmwtpn7x|title=The Capture review \u2014 the camera always lies in this paranoid thriller|first=James|last=Jackson|date=4 September 2019|via=www.thetimes.co.uk}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' was less enthusiastic, concluding it to be a \"twisty if lacklustre drama\", giving the opening episode only three stars out of five.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/03/the-capture-review-chillingly-real-thriller-or-utter-bobbins-lets-check-the-tape|title=The Capture review \u2013 chillingly real thriller or utter bobbins?

Because of his work in charities that fought against animal cruelty, Cowell became concerned over the welfare of the animals, forcing him to use a commercial break to speak with the owner of the puppies.

Staff had designed the segment to involve the sister show's host [[Stephen Mulhern]] holding a quiz with the judges, asking them questions and awarding them a puppy for each correct answer they gave. Because of his work in charities that fought against animal cruelty, Cowell became concerned over the welfare of the animals, forcing him to use a commercial break to speak with the owner of the puppies.

She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 19 June 2006 as the first character to be introduced to the series by series producer, [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]]. In 2008 Metcalfe feared that the character was to be axed but was later reassured by the series producer that she would not be. Metcalfe later stated her intention to stay with the series. Mercedes is part of the [[McQueen family]] and is the longest serving McQueen on the series. On 26 August 2014, it was revealed that Metcalfe had decided to quit the soap.<ref name=\"newmcqueens\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a592506/hollyoaks-confirms-mcqueen-family-shake-up.html#~oO2xCyjlzmzbKT|title=Hollyoaks confirms McQueen family shake-up|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|date=26 August 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=26 August 2014}}</ref> On 18 November 2014, Mercedes was presumably stabbed to death, with her body discarded. However, Metcalfe returned to screens on 17 February 2015 in a surprise, unannounced twist which saw Mercedes revealed as alive and well, living in [[Nice]], [[France]]. It was announced that Mercedes would make a full-time return to the show in May 2015, after brief appearances on 18 February 9 March, and 6 April.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks: Jennifer Metcalfe to make full-time return as Mercedes |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a629650/hollyoaks-jennifer-metcalfe-making-full-time-return-as-mercedes.html#~p4Ao0MXOeKVCm2|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=17 February 2015|accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref> Metcalfe announced her pregnancy in 2017 and revealed that she would be taking a year's break from the show. Mercedes was last seen on screen leaving with [[Goldie McQueen]] ([[Chelsee Healey]]) on 4 July 2017, although she briefly appeared on 7 September 2017 in a fake flashback scene involving her and [[Amy Barnes]] ([[Ashley Slanina-Davies]]) surmised by [[James Nightingale (Hollyoaks)|James Nightingale]] ([[Gregory Finnegan]]). Mercedes returned on 9 July 2018.\n\nMercedes is described as a \"savvy, ballsy girl that can't say no and is unapologetic about it\". She is played as having moments of happiness which she ruins for herself and as managing to justify \"whatever she does that's bad\". Throughout her time on the series, Mercedes' storylines have centered on her relationships. These include her marriages to [[Russ Owen]] ([[Stuart Manning]]), [[Malachy Fisher]] ([[Glen Wallace]]) and [[Doctor Browning|Dr. Paul Browning]] ([[Joseph Thompson (actor)|Joseph Thompson]]), with her second marriage involving her in an [[HIV]] storyline, an engagement to [[Riley Costello]] ([[Rob Norbury]]) and a committed relationship with [[Joe Roscoe]] ([[Ayden Callaghan]]). She has also been central to several affairs which included [[Calvin Valentine]] ([[Ricky Whittle]]), her sister's husband, and Riley's father [[Carl Costello|Carl]] ([[Paul Opacic]]). Following the revelation of her affair with Carl on her wedding day to Riley, Mercedes was at the centre of a kidnapping storyline when she was held against her will by Riley's serial killer grandfather, [[Silas Blissett]] ([[Jeff Rawle]]), before going into labour, giving birth to a boy as a result of the stress. Following her ordeal Mercedes briefly turned to prostitution. When [[Mitzeee Minniver|Mitzeee]] ([[Rachel Shenton]]) grows close to Riley, Mercedes begins to stalk her. During the culmination of the plot, in \"pure desperation\" Mercedes stabs herself and Mitzeee is blamed. Mercedes' friend, [[Lynsey Nolan]] ([[Karen Hassan]]), discovers Mercedes' stalking of Mitzeee and stabbing of herself. Lynsey is later murdered in a \"[[whodunit]]\" storyline with Mercedes becoming a suspect in her murder. It is later revealed Mercedes' partner Doctor Browning killed Lynsey to protect Mercedes and in October 2013, Mercedes, [[Cindy Cunningham]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]) and [[Lindsey Butterfield]] ([[Sophie Austin]]) attacked, murdered and covered up the murder of Doctor Browning. In the run-up to her 2014 departure, Mercedes was involved in feuds with [[Freddie Roscoe]] (Charlie Clapham) and [[Grace Black]] ([[Tamara Wall]]) and mourning for her sister [[Carmel McQueen|Carmel]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) following a train crash, which Mercedes was also involved in. Since her return in February 2015, her storylines have included reuniting with her family, her relationship with Joe and delivering a [[stillborn]] son named [[#Stillbirth|Gabriel]], exposing Lindsey as the Gloved Hand Killer, Silas returning and targeting her again, and her feud with [[Joanne Cardsley]] ([[Rachel Leskovac]]) over Joe, who later dies during the show's \"Halloween Spooktacular\" episodes. In late 2019, the character finds herself at the centre of another \"[[whodunit]]\" storyline, \"Who Shot Mercedes?\", where she is shot having angered numerous residents.\n\nMetcalfe has received numerous awards and nominations for her portrayal of Mercedes. Metcalfe has been praised by the British press for her performance in the role.

Mercedes informed Tony about the pregnancy, despite their dislike for each other, because she felt he had the right to know.<ref name=mum /> According to Metcalfe, Mercedes considered giving her baby to her sister, since Jacqui was unable to have children but wanted to become a mother, but did not tell Jacqui the baby's paternity.<ref name=mum /> Metcalfe also felt that Mercedes decided against giving Jacqui the baby because Mercedes was unable to \"cope\" with the baby's paternity, and would be more willing to give Jacqui the baby if Tony was not the father.<ref name=mum /> When asked if Mercedes would keep the baby herself, Metcalfe said, \"She would if it was Russ' or maybe even the product of a one-night stand.

Mercedes realised that she will be blamed for stalking Mitzeee so she stabbed herself to convince people Mitzeee was mad. Metcalfe said the situation was born through \"pure desperation\". She said that \"the thought of Mitzeee, Riley and Bobby as a family together was too much for her to take, and she just saw red.

Mitzeee is petrified and picks up a knife in the kitchen.

Mitzeee doesn't have a clue whether she could have stabbed Mercedes, or if someone else came into the flat and did it\".<ref name=stalking />\n\nAccording to Metcalfe, during Mercedes' hospitalisation and recuperation she \"starts putting it on to get sympathy. She's determined to get what she wants\". Metcalfe explained that Mercedes did not \"feel guilt at all \u2013 she just wants Riley back and she'll do whatever it takes to get him\". Metcalfe believed that it was easy for Mercedes to lie; \"hence why she does it so much and so well!\" Mercedes felt that she had to lie, and found it easy to cry if she needed to, \"especially if it will benefit her\".<ref name=stabbing /> Metcalfe was unsure whether the audience would start to hate her character because she believed that Mercedes was not hateful. She stated, \"I hope I've done a good job and people still feel sorry for her\". She said that \"the viewers have still been feeling some sympathy for Mercedes. I was getting lots of [[Tweet (Twitter)#Tweets|tweets]] saying, 'I feel so sorry for Mercedes, she needs to get back with Riley' and 'Mitzeee is being a bitch'\".

It was revealed the show had been working with stillbirth charities, ''Count the Kicks'' and ''Sands'' to produce various ways mothers can monitor their unborn baby's progress. Rival soap opera, ''[[EastEnders]]'', had produced a similar storyline when [[Shabnam Masood]] and [[Kush Kazemi]] ([[Rakhee Thakrar]] and [[Davood Ghadami]]) lost their son [[Shabnam Masood#Stillbirth|Zaair]] before he was born, but fans were reassured the storyline had been planned months prior to the announcement of ''EastEnders''{{'s}} storyline. It was revealed Mercedes would first admit her fears to John Paul and they visited the hospital where a doctor would inform them that their son had died. Kilkelly teased that the storyline would see how Mercedes coped with the situation, how it affects Mercedes and Joe's relationship, as well as seeing the permanent return of Myra.<ref name=Stillbirth>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a675330/hollyoaks-to-air-stillbirth-storyline-as-mercedes-mcqueen-loses-her-baby/|title=Hollyoaks to air stillbirth storyline|date=23 October 2015|work=Digital Spy}}</ref>\n\nMetcalfe spoke of the new storyline, saying how \"honoured\" she was to take part in the storyline as well as praising the writer, Anna Clements: \"I'm honoured to have been given this storyline to raise awareness of such an important cause. Count the Kicks is a fantastic charity, which aims to teach expectant mothers about noticing changes in their pregnancy to reduce the risk of stillbirth. And working with Sands has helped me understand how Mercedes would cope with life after her baby has died. Mercedes has already been through so much tragedy in her life, but the death of her son will show a much more fragile side to her character. The scripts are brilliantly written by Anna Clements and with the help of the two charities, I was able to really understand what Mercedes is going through.\"<ref name=Stillbirth/> Erica Stewart, the bereavement support services manager at ''Sands'', said: \"We're pleased to have been approached by the researchers and writers at Hollyoaks for advice and help to ensure that this heartbreaking storyline is portrayed truthfully and sensitively. Stillbirth is not rare and it's a tragedy that can happen to anyone. Sadly thousands of babies die each year in the UK. In 2013, over 100 babies every week were stillborn or died soon after birth. For a show like Hollyoaks with a youth focus to be covering this devastating experience is a brilliant way of raising awareness of the issues surrounding baby death among a younger audience who may have not otherwise come across them.\"<ref name=Stillbirth/> Metcalfe later further discussed the storyline, revealing that when she read the scripts she had \"a lump in my throat\", which made cry and when she had finished reading the scripts, she was \"sat their sobbing\".<ref name=Stillstobbing>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-26/hollyoaks-star-jennifer-metcalfe-left-sobbing-over-mercedes-mcqueens-stillbirth-storyline|title=Hollyoaks spoilers: Jennifer Metcalfe left \"sobbing\" over Mercedes McQueen's stillbirth storyline|work=RadioTimes}}</ref> She continued to say: \"When it came to playing it on set I did minimal rehearsals because I didn't want to wear out the true meaning of the words.\" before praising the script writing, calling them \"brilliant\" and stating she did not have to work hard to find the \"level of emotion\", \"The words were all there on the page.

She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 19 June 2006 as the first character to be introduced to the series by series producer, [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]]. In 2008 Metcalfe feared that the character was to be axed but was later reassured by the series producer that she would not be. Metcalfe later stated her intention to stay with the series. Mercedes is part of the [[McQueen family]] and is the longest serving McQueen on the series. On 26 August 2014, it was revealed that Metcalfe had decided to quit the soap.<ref name=\"newmcqueens\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a592506/hollyoaks-confirms-mcqueen-family-shake-up.html#~oO2xCyjlzmzbKT|title=Hollyoaks confirms McQueen family shake-up|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|date=26 August 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=26 August 2014}}</ref> On 18 November 2014, Mercedes was presumably stabbed to death, with her body discarded. However, Metcalfe returned to screens on 17 February 2015 in a surprise, unannounced twist which saw Mercedes revealed as alive and well, living in [[Nice]], [[France]]. It was announced that Mercedes would make a full-time return to the show in May 2015, after brief appearances on 18 February 9 March, and 6 April.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks: Jennifer Metcalfe to make full-time return as Mercedes |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a629650/hollyoaks-jennifer-metcalfe-making-full-time-return-as-mercedes.html#~p4Ao0MXOeKVCm2|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=17 February 2015|accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref> Metcalfe announced her pregnancy in 2017 and revealed that she would be taking a year's break from the show. Mercedes was last seen on screen leaving with [[Goldie McQueen]] ([[Chelsee Healey]]) on 4 July 2017, although she briefly appeared on 7 September 2017 in a fake flashback scene involving her and [[Amy Barnes]] ([[Ashley Slanina-Davies]]) surmised by [[James Nightingale (Hollyoaks)|James Nightingale]] ([[Gregory Finnegan]]). Mercedes returned on 9 July 2018.\n\nMercedes is described as a \"savvy, ballsy girl that can't say no and is unapologetic about it\". She is played as having moments of happiness which she ruins for herself and as managing to justify \"whatever she does that's bad\". Throughout her time on the series, Mercedes' storylines have centered on her relationships. These include her marriages to [[Russ Owen]] ([[Stuart Manning]]), [[Malachy Fisher]] ([[Glen Wallace]]) and [[Doctor Browning|Dr. Paul Browning]] ([[Joseph Thompson (actor)|Joseph Thompson]]), with her second marriage involving her in an [[HIV]] storyline, an engagement to [[Riley Costello]] ([[Rob Norbury]]) and a committed relationship with [[Joe Roscoe]] ([[Ayden Callaghan]]). She has also been central to several affairs which included [[Calvin Valentine]] ([[Ricky Whittle]]), her sister's husband, and Riley's father [[Carl Costello|Carl]] ([[Paul Opacic]]). Following the revelation of her affair with Carl on her wedding day to Riley, Mercedes was at the centre of a kidnapping storyline when she was held against her will by Riley's serial killer grandfather, [[Silas Blissett]] ([[Jeff Rawle]]), before going into labour, giving birth to a boy as a result of the stress. Following her ordeal Mercedes briefly turned to prostitution. When [[Mitzeee Minniver|Mitzeee]] ([[Rachel Shenton]]) grows close to Riley, Mercedes begins to stalk her. During the culmination of the plot, in \"pure desperation\" Mercedes stabs herself and Mitzeee is blamed. Mercedes' friend, [[Lynsey Nolan]] ([[Karen Hassan]]), discovers Mercedes' stalking of Mitzeee and stabbing of herself. Lynsey is later murdered in a \"[[whodunit]]\" storyline with Mercedes becoming a suspect in her murder. It is later revealed Mercedes' partner Doctor Browning killed Lynsey to protect Mercedes and in October 2013, Mercedes, [[Cindy Cunningham]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]) and [[Lindsey Butterfield]] ([[Sophie Austin]]) attacked, murdered and covered up the murder of Doctor Browning. In the run-up to her 2014 departure, Mercedes was involved in feuds with [[Freddie Roscoe]] (Charlie Clapham) and [[Grace Black]] ([[Tamara Wall]]) and mourning for her sister [[Carmel McQueen|Carmel]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) following a train crash, which Mercedes was also involved in. Since her return in February 2015, her storylines have included reuniting with her family, her relationship with Joe and delivering a [[stillborn]] son named [[#Stillbirth|Gabriel]], exposing Lindsey as the Gloved Hand Killer, Silas returning and targeting her again, and her feud with [[Joanne Cardsley]] ([[Rachel Leskovac]]) over Joe, who later dies during the show's \"Halloween Spooktacular\" episodes. In late 2019, the character finds herself at the centre of another \"[[whodunit]]\" storyline, \"Who Shot Mercedes?\", where she is shot having angered numerous residents.\n\nMetcalfe has received numerous awards and nominations for her portrayal of Mercedes. Metcalfe has been praised by the British press for her performance in the role. The character has also been praised and criticized by the British press, for her numerous relationships and affairs, her appearance, her status as a \"slapper\" and her penchant for finding herself in \"terrifying situations.\"\n\n==Character creation and casting==\nMercedes was created by producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]], as part of his rejuvenation of ''Hollyoaks'' in 2006, which included the creation of his \"brainchild\"<ref name=\"bkint\">{{cite web|last=Green |first=Kris|title=Bryan Kirkwood, 'Hollyoaks' Producer|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/interviews/a77573/bryan-kirkwood-hollyoaks-producer.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=8 August 2010|date=12 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v05THxaY?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/interviews/a77573/bryan-kirkwood-hollyoaks-producer.html|url-status=live |archivedate=15 December 2010 }}</ref> the [[McQueen family]].

This encouraged Mercedes to \"take a long, hard look at herself\", and she realized that she was doing the same thing in the situation with Warren.<ref name=court /> On her way to the court, however, Mercedes was \"all over the place\".

It's surprising Jacqui doesn't guess something is wrong because Mercedes can't look her in the eye\".<ref name=mum />\n\nMercedes discovered she has fallen pregnant, which left her \"totally devastated\". Metcalfe expressed that Mercedes \"felt bad enough about sleeping with Tony. Finding out she's pregnant is a nightmare\". Mercedes informed Tony about the pregnancy, despite their dislike for each other, because she felt he had the right to know.<ref name=mum /> According to Metcalfe, Mercedes considered giving her baby to her sister, since Jacqui was unable to have children but wanted to become a mother, but did not tell Jacqui the baby's paternity.<ref name=mum /> Metcalfe also felt that Mercedes decided against giving Jacqui the baby because Mercedes was unable to \"cope\" with the baby's paternity, and would be more willing to give Jacqui the baby if Tony was not the father.<ref name=mum /> When asked if Mercedes would keep the baby herself, Metcalfe said, \"She would if it was Russ' or maybe even the product of a one-night stand. But Tony's baby and all the baggage that comes with that?

He proposed marriage to her, but she refused. Mercedes has sex with a stranger; Metcalfe remarked, \"Sex usually makes her forget about everything else that's going on. But afterwards she still can't stop thinking about Malachy, so she decides to go and see him to work out how she feels\".<ref name=later /> Mercedes subsequently accepted Malachy's proposal and they marry.

The test was negative which was a \"huge relief\" for them.<ref name=\"dangerous affair\"/>\n\nMalachy later witnessed Mercedes and Calvin kissing but did not interrupt them.

Rival soap opera, ''[[EastEnders]]'', had produced a similar storyline when [[Shabnam Masood]] and [[Kush Kazemi]] ([[Rakhee Thakrar]] and [[Davood Ghadami]]) lost their son [[Shabnam Masood#Stillbirth|Zaair]] before he was born, but fans were reassured the storyline had been planned months prior to the announcement of ''EastEnders''{{'s}} storyline. It was revealed Mercedes would first admit her fears to John Paul and they visited the hospital where a doctor would inform them that their son had died.

And working with Sands has helped me understand how Mercedes would cope with life after her baby has died. Mercedes has already been through so much tragedy in her life, but the death of her son will show a much more fragile side to her character.

For a show like Hollyoaks with a youth focus to be covering this devastating experience is a brilliant way of raising awareness of the issues surrounding baby death among a younger audience who may have not otherwise come across them.\"<ref name=Stillbirth/> Metcalfe later further discussed the storyline, revealing that when she read the scripts she had \"a lump in my throat\", which made cry and when she had finished reading the scripts, she was \"sat their sobbing\".<ref name=Stillstobbing>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-26/hollyoaks-star-jennifer-metcalfe-left-sobbing-over-mercedes-mcqueens-stillbirth-storyline|title=Hollyoaks spoilers: Jennifer Metcalfe left \"sobbing\" over Mercedes McQueen's stillbirth storyline|work=RadioTimes}}</ref> She continued to say: \"When it came to playing it on set I did minimal rehearsals because I didn't want to wear out the true meaning of the words.\" before praising the script writing, calling them \"brilliant\" and stating she did not have to work hard to find the \"level of emotion\", \"The words were all there on the page.

After giving birth to her son who she decides to name Gabriel, Mercedes is left overwhelmed with grief and the funeral costs. Theresa decides to help raise money for the funeral by doing a naked photo shoot. However, even after the money for the funeral had been gathered, Mercedes is still left heartbroken and distraught. Theresa then decides to make a phone call to Myra, informing her of the situation and begs her to come home. At Gabriel's funeral, Myra finds Mercedes sitting on the outside bench, and comforts her as she apologize to her for faking her death last year. Mercedes is delighted to see her and they make amends. Her family arrange a mini memorial service for Gabriel at their home where she says goodbye to him. When Joe finds out that Gabriel has died, he finds Mercedes and reveals he is still in love with her and they decide to go on holiday together. On New Year's Eve, Mercedes tells Joe the truth that he is Gabriel's father. Joe is devastated and breaks up with her, and sleeps with Lindsey in retaliation. He later reconciles with Mercedes.\n\nLindsey later reveals that she is pregnant with Joe's baby. Joe admits this but tells Mercedes he still wants to be with her. Mercedes believes him, however Lindsey makes Mercedes feel as though she is interrupting on a perfect family with her and Joe. Mercedes then breaks up with Joe, and leaves the village. She returns two months later, and is shocked to learn that Lindsey's younger sister, [[Kim Butterfield]] ([[Daisy Wood-Davis]]), has been imprisoned for killing seven patients at the local hospital. Kim's ex-girlfriend, [[Esther Bloom]] ([[Jazmine Franks]]) and herself a victim of the killer when they tried to murder her, attempts to convince Mercedes of Kim's innocence. Mercedes and Esther realise that Lindsey is the serial killer after discovering Lindsey's earring is matching to the earring which was dropped when Esther was attacked. Mercedes confronts Lindsey but she denies this. Lindsey writes a fake letter pretending to be Kim admitting to be the serial killer and telling Esther to leave her alone. Mercedes sees the letter which has doodles on it, and when she is alone with Cindy and Lindsey, she realises that the doodles are the same as those in Lindsey's notebook. Her and Cindy realise that Lindsey is the serial killer and confront her. Lindsey confesses to the murders and attempted murders, and then strikes both Mercedes and Cindy with a large book, knocking them unconscious. She then escapes the village. Mercedes is desperate for Lindsey to be caught and for Joe's baby son, JJ, not be abducted, and moves back in with Joe and Freddie. When Silas hears about what Lindsey's murders, he returns to the village and begins working with Lindsey. Silas plans to finally kill Mercedes, however Mercedes convinces Silas to kill Lindsey instead, informing him of her sinful ways. Her plan works and Silas murders Lindsey instead and Mercedes manages to escape.\n\nMercedes and Joe then reconcile and get engaged. On Mercedes' hen night, however, she is arrested along with Cindy and [[Tegan Lomax]] (Jessica Ellis) following a catfight. While at the police station, Mercedes' lawyer, [[Joanne Cardsley]] ([[Rachel Leskovac]]), plants drugs in Mercedes' handbag in an attempt to ruin her relationship with Joe because of her own obsession with him. Mercedes spends the night in a cell and is released on her wedding day. At the wedding, Mercedes is devastated when Joe does not arrive. She confronts him and he admits that he cannot be with her after hearing about her arrest as he believes she is not an appropriate mother figure for his children and refuses to believe that Mercedes is innocent. He also admits to having a one-night stand with Joanne. Mercedes is furious and is even more angry when she sees Joe and Joanne together later that day. As a result, she crashes a car in to the restaurant and vows revenge on both of them. Joe and Joanne eventually begin a relationship, however the police later discover that the drugs didn't belong to Mercedes, and she realises that Joanne set her up. Joe realises Joanne's deceit and breaks up with her. At the \"Halloween Spooktacular\", Joe plans to propose to Mercedes on the ferris wheel in order to win her back. Mercedes discovers Joe's plan and decides to embarrass him in front of everyone. While she is on the ferris wheel with Joe, she realises that she is still in love with him and forgives him. Joanne is furious when she sees Mercedes and Joe together, and pulls the brakes on the ferris wheel, leaving Joe and Mercedes stuck in the air. When a fire breaks out at the wooden maze, a rescue team arrive to save Mercedes and Joe. Mercedes is rescued from the wheel, an explosion caused by the fire rips through the funfair. As a result, Joe falls off the ferris wheel and plummets to his death after telling Mercedes he loves her.\n\nAfter hearing that Joanne has stabbed the local shopkeeper, [[Simone Loveday]] ([[Jacqueline Boatswain]]), Mercedes realises that Joanne is a danger to the village. She confronts Joanne over Joe's death, where she confesses and protests that it was an accident, however when asked about stabbing Simone, Joanne claims that she \"deserved it\". It is then revealed that Mercedes was working with the police, who have heard everything that Joanne has confessed to, and she is arrested for her actions and schemes, thrilling Mercedes who finally gets justice for Joe. Unfortunately, Mercedes' happiness is short-lived, when Joe's mother Sandy insists that Joe's children, [[JJ Roscoe|JJ]] and [[Lexi Roscoe|Lexi]], move to South Africa so she can look after them, breaking Mercedes' heart, but, Sandy allowed her to visit them anytime she wants. In December 2016, she sleeps with [[Ryan Knight (Hollyoaks)|Ryan Knight]] ([[Duncan James]]), who was engaged to [[Amy Barnes]] ([[Ashley Slanina-Davies]]).\n\nAmy is later murdered in March 2017.

Mercedes helps Ryan through his grief by sharing her experiences of losing Joe. They begin a relationship, but it is short-lived when Mercedes finds out he cheated on her with [[Kyle Kelly]] ([[Adam Rickitt]]). Mercedes finds herself feeling lonely and desperately wanting to be a mother. She confides in Simone that she believes losing Gabriel was punishment for her abandonment of Bobby, but Simone assures her that is not the case. One day, while drinking alone, a stranger comes up to her and she talks to him about how she wants to be a 'proper mum' to Bobby. When he leaves she asks his name to which he replies Gabriel. Seeing this as a sign, she tells her friends and family that she is leaving to be with Bobby in America. Her cousin, [[Goldie McQueen|Goldie]] ([[Chelsee Healey]]), also decides to come with her to escape a robbery charge and they leave together after emotional goodbyes to their family.\n\nIn July 2018, Cleo receives a text while out for a jog and runs off. A car pulls up beside Cleo and the driver is revealed to be Mercedes. Bobby gets out and Mercedes tells Cleo to hide him. The McQueens realise Mercedes has kidnapped him after Carl makes a national appeal to bring him home. However, it is revealed that Carl is an alcoholic and Mercedes and Mitzeee agreed that Mercedes should take him. Mercedes invites the McQueens to Magaluf for her hen party and reveals she is engaged. They arrive in Magaluf and Mercedes arrives on a yacht. Myra reveals she is a lesbian and is in a relationship with [[Sally St. Claire]] ([[Annie Wallace]]) and Mercedes welcomes Sally to the family. Her fianc\u00e9 is revealed to be Russ, shocking Myra. Myra refuses to forgive Russ for taking Max away from her. Mercedes is shocked to be reunited with her cousin [[Sylver McQueen]] (David Tag) and introduces him to Russ. Mercedes tries to convince Myra to forgive Russ and she agrees but plans on making Russ see what Mercedes is really like. At Mercedes\u2019 hen party, Myra pays Goldie to kiss Russ and she does which is witnessed by Mercedes. Russ tries to explain that Goldie kisses him but Goldie reveals Myra's plan. Goldie discovers that Russ used to be a porn star and Mercedes is furious that he lied to her. She is comforted by Sylver and is revealed that they slept together before he went to prison. They have a heart to heart and they sleep together again. The next day, Russ begs Mercedes to forgive him but she isn't interested. Myra convinces Mercedes to forgive Russ but is to late as Russ has already left. The McQueens arrive at the airport and they are greeted by Russ and Max and Russ and Mercedes reconcile. However, their happiness is short lived when the police arrive and arrest Mercedes for Carl's murder.\n\nMercedes is questioned by [[DS Roxy Cassidy]] (Lizzie Stavrou) over Carl's murder and she desperately denies everything. Simone comes to her rescue and she is released from custody. Mercedes decides to move to Spain but after a talk with Sylver she decides to stay in Hollyoaks. When Roxy reminds Russ how many of Mercedes\u2019 partners have died, Russ suspects her to be a serial killer. When she discovers this, they argue and Mercedes calls off the wedding. However, Russ buys Mercedes The Dog and they reconcile. Russ becomes suspicious of Mercedes and Sylver and angrily confronts them but Mercedes assures him that nothing is going on between them. Sylver later tells his mother, [[Breda McQueen]] ([[Moya Brady]]), that he is in love with Mercedes.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n{{cquote|Is this woman superhuman, or what?

These can be assessed to determine its overall dependability using [[qualitative data|Qualitative]] or [[quantitative property|Quantitative]] measures. Avizienis et al. define the following Dependability Attributes:\n\n* [[Availability]] - readiness for correct service\n* [[Reliability engineering|Reliability]] - continuity of correct service\n* [[Safety]] - absence of catastrophic consequences on the user(s) and the environment\n* [[Integrity]] -  absence of improper system alteration\n* [[Maintainability]] -  ability for easy maintenance (repair)\n\nAs these definitions suggested, only Availability and Reliability  are quantifiable by direct measurements whilst others are more subjective. For instance Safety cannot be measured directly via metrics but is a subjective assessment that requires judgmental information to be applied to give a level of confidence, whilst Reliability can be measured as failures over time.\n\n[[Confidentiality]], i.e. ''the absence of unauthorized disclosure of information'' is also used when addressing security. Security is a composite of [[Confidentiality]], [[Integrity]], and [[Availability]]. Security is sometimes classed as an attribute <ref>I. Sommerville, Software Engineering: Addison-Wesley, 2004.</ref> but the current view is to aggregate it together with dependability and treat Dependability as a composite term called Dependability and Security.<ref name=\"A. Avizienis, J pp. 11-33\" />\n\nPractically, applying security measures to the appliances of a system generally improves the dependability by limiting the number of externally originated errors.\n\n=== Threats ===\n\nThreats are things that can affect a system and cause a drop in Dependability. There are three main terms that must be clearly understood: \n\n* Fault: A fault (which is usually referred to as a bug for historic reasons) is a defect in a system. The presence of a fault in a system may or may not lead to a failure. For instance, although a system may contain a fault, its input and state conditions may never cause this fault to be executed so that an error occurs; and thus that particular fault never exhibits as a failure.\n* Error: An error is a discrepancy between the intended behaviour of a system and its actual behaviour inside the system boundary. Errors occur at runtime when some part of the system enters an unexpected state due to the activation of a fault. Since errors are generated from invalid states they are hard to observe without special mechanisms, such as debuggers or debug output to logs.\n* Failure:  A failure is an instance in time when a system displays behaviour that is contrary to its specification. An error may not necessarily cause a failure, for instance an exception may be thrown by a system but this may be caught and handled using fault tolerance techniques so the overall operation of the system will conform to the specification.\n\nIt is important to note that Failures are recorded at the system boundary. They are basically Errors that have propagated to the system boundary and have become observable.\nFaults, Errors and Failures operate according to a mechanism. This mechanism is sometimes known as a Fault-Error-Failure chain.<ref>A. Avizienis, V. Magnus U, J. C. Laprie, and [[Brian Randell]], \"Fundamental Concepts of Dependability,\" presented at ISW-2000, Cambridge, MA, 2000.</ref> As a general rule a fault, when activated, can lead to an error (which is an invalid state) and the invalid state generated by an error may lead to another error or a failure (which is an observable deviation from the specified behaviour at the system boundary).\n\nOnce a fault is activated an error is created. An error may act in the same way as a fault in that it can create further error conditions, therefore an error may propagate multiple times within a system boundary without causing an observable failure. If an error propagates outside the system boundary a failure is said to occur. A failure is basically the point at which it can be said that a service is failing to meet its specification. Since the output data from one service may be fed into another, a failure in one service may propagate into another service as a fault so a chain can be formed of the form: Fault leading to Error leading to Failure leading to Error, etc.\n\n=== Means ===\n\nSince the mechanism of a Fault-Error-Chain is understood it is possible to construct means to break these chains and thereby increase the dependability of a system.\nFour means have been identified so far:\n# Prevention\n# Removal\n# Forecasting\n# Tolerance\n\nFault Prevention deals with preventing faults being incorporated into a system. This can be accomplished by use of development methodologies and good implementation techniques.\n\nFault Removal can be sub-divided into two sub-categories: Removal During Development and Removal During Use.<br>\nRemoval during development requires verification so that faults can be detected and removed before a system is put into production. Once systems have been put into production a system is needed to record failures and remove them via a maintenance cycle.\n\nFault Forecasting predicts likely faults so that they can be removed or their effects can be circumvented.\n\n[[Fault Tolerance]] deals with putting mechanisms in place that will allow a system to still deliver the required service in the presence of faults, although that service may be at a degraded level.\n\nDependability means are intended to reduce the number of failures presented to the user of a system. Failures are traditionally recorded over time and it is useful to understand how their frequency is measured so that the effectiveness of means can be assessed.11\n\n== Dependability of information systems and survivability ==\n\nRecent works, such <ref>John C.
