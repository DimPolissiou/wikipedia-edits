She generally selects sheltered places such as dark, hollow tree trunks. She first builds a series of cells (up to 50) out of chewed tree bark. The cells are arranged in horizontal layers named combs, each cell being vertical and closed at the top. An egg is then laid in each cell. After 5\u20138 days, the egg hatches, and in the next two weeks, the larva undergoes its five stages. During this time, the queen feeds it a protein-rich diet of insects. Then, the larva spins a silk cap over the cell's opening and, during the next two weeks, transforms into an adult, a process called [[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]. The adult then eats its way through the silk cap. This first generation of workers, invariably females, now gradually undertakes all the tasks formerly carried out by the queen ([[foraging]], nest building, taking care of the [[brood (honeybee)|brood]], etc.) with the exception of [[Oviposition|egg-laying]], which remains exclusive to the queen.\n\n[[File:HornetLifeLyd.png|thumb|right|250px|Life history of ''[[Vespa crabro]]'']]\n\nAs the [[Group size measures|colony size]] grows, new combs are added, and an envelope is built around the cell layers until the nest is entirely covered, with the exception of an entry hole. To be able to build cells in total darkness, they apparently use gravity to aid them. At the peak of its population, which occurs in late summer, the colony can reach a size of 700 workers.\n\nAt this time, the queen starts producing the first reproductive individuals. Fertilized eggs develop into females (called \"[[gynes]]\" by entomologists), and unfertilized ones develop into males (sometimes called \"drones\"). Adult males do not participate in nest maintenance, foraging, or caretaking of the larvae. In early to mid autumn, they leave the nest and mate during \"[[nuptial flight]]s.\"\n\nOther temperate species (e.g., the [[Vespa simillima|yellow hornet]], ''V. simillima'', or the [[Oriental hornet]], ''V. orientalis'') have similar cycles. In the case of tropical species (e.g., ''V. tropica''), life histories may well differ, and in species with both tropical and temperate distributions (such as the [[Asian giant hornet]], ''Vespa mandarinia''), the cycle likely depends on latitude.\n\n==Distribution==\nHornets are found mainly in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. The common [[European hornet]] (''Vespa crabro'') is the best-known species, widely distributed in [[Europe]] (but is never found north of the [[63rd parallel north|63rd parallel]]), [[Ukraine]] and [[European Russia]] (except in extreme northern areas). In the east, the species' distribution area stretches over the [[Ural Mountains]] to [[West Siberian Plain|Western Siberia]] (found in the vicinity of [[Khanty-Mansiysk]]). In [[Asia]], the common European hornet is found in southern Siberia, as well as in [[East China|eastern China]]. The common European hornet was accidentally introduced to eastern North America about the middle of the 19th century and has lived there since at about the same latitudes as in Europe. However, it has never been found in western North America.\n\nThe [[Asian giant hornet]] (''Vespa mandarinia'') lives in the [[Primorsky Krai]], [[Khabarovsky Krai]] (southern part) and [[Jewish AO]] regions of Russia, China, Korea, [[Taiwan]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], Vietnam, [[Indochina]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], Sri Lanka and [[Thailand]], but is most commonly found in the mountains of Japan, where they are commonly known as the giant sparrow bee.\n\nThe [[Oriental hornet]] (''Vespa orientalis'') occurs in semi-dry sub-tropical areas of [[Central Asia]] ([[Armenia]], [[Dagestan]] in Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, [[Oman]], Pakistan, [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrghyzstan]], southern [[Kazakhstan]]), [[southern Europe]] (Italy, [[Malta]], [[Albania]], Romania, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, [[Cyprus]]), [[North Africa]] ([[Algeria]], Libya, Egypt, Sudan, [[Eritrea]], Somalia) and along the shores of the [[Gulf of Aden]] and in the [[Middle East]].

Allergic reactions are commonly treated with [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) injection using a device such as an [[epinephrine autoinjector]], with prompt follow-up treatment in a hospital. In severe cases, allergic individuals may go into [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic shock]] and die unless treated promptly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000033.htm|title=Insect bites and stings: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia}}</ref>\n\n==Attack pheromone==\nHornets, like many social wasps, can mobilize the entire nest to sting in defense, which is highly dangerous to humans and other animals. The attack [[pheromone]] is released in case of threat to the nest. In the case of the [[Asian giant hornet]] (''[[Asian giant hornet|Vespa mandarinia]]'') this is also used to mobilize many workers at once when attacking colonies of their prey, [[honey bee]]s and other ''Vespa'' species.<ref name=chemicals>{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/critter/8137hornets.html|title=Volatile fragrance chemicals may attract unwanted attention from hornets and bees}}</ref> Three biologically active chemicals, 2-[[pentanol]], [[3-methyl-1-butanol]], and 1-methylbutyl 3-methylbutanoate, have been identified for this species. In field tests, 2-pentanol alone triggered mild alarm and defensive behavior, but adding the other two compounds increased aggressiveness in a [[Synergy|synergistic]] effect.<ref name=chemicals/> In the [[European hornet]] (''[[Vespa crabro]]'') the major compound of the alarm pheromone is 2-methyl-3-butene-2-ol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pherobase.com/database/genus/genus-Vespa.php|title=Vespa|work=pherobase.com}}</ref>\n\nIf a hornet is killed near a nest it may release pheromones that can cause the other hornets to attack. Materials that come in contact with these pheromones, such as clothes, skin, and dead prey or hornets, can also trigger an attack, as can certain food flavorings, such as banana and apple flavorings, and fragrances that contain [[Alcohol#Common names|C<sub>5</sub> alcohols]] and C<sub>10</sub> [[esters]].<ref name=chemicals/>\n\n==Diet and feeding==\nAdult hornets and their relatives (e.g., [[yellowjacket]]s) feed themselves with nectar and sugar-rich plant foods. Thus, they can often be found feeding on the sap of [[oak trees]], rotting sweet fruits, honey and any sugar-containing foodstuffs. Hornets frequently fly into orchards to feed on overripe fruit. Hornets tend to gnaw a hole into fruit to become totally immersed into its pulp. A person who accidentally plucks a fruit with a feeding hornet can be attacked by the disturbed insect. Hornets also produce [[jam]], similar to how [[bee]]s produce [[honey]] inside their hives; the flavour of the jam is dependant on the hornets diet.\n\nThe adults also attack various insects, which they kill with stings and jaws. Due to their size and the power of their venom, hornets are able to kill large insects such as [[honey bee]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, [[locust]]s and [[katydid]]s without difficulty. The victim is fully masticated and then fed to the [[larvae]] developing in the nest, rather than consumed by the adult hornets. Given that some of their prey are considered pests, hornets may be considered beneficial under some circumstances.\n\nThe larvae of hornets produce a sweet secretion containing sugars and amino acids that is consumed by the workers and queens.<ref>Wheeler, W.M.

Yellowjackets are generally smaller than hornets and are bright yellow and black, whereas hornets may often be black and white. There is also a related genus of Asian nocturnal vespines, ''[[Provespa]]'', which are referred to as \"night wasps\" or \"night hornets\",<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.vespa-bicolor.net/main/vespid/provespa.htm |title=Untitled Document}}</ref> though they are not true hornets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Madl |first1=M |title=Notes on the genus ''Provespa'' Ashmead, 1903 (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Vespidae: Vespinae) based on the material of the Naturhistorisches Museum Wien (Austria)|journal=Annals Naturhistorisches Museum Wien|date=2012|volume=114|pages=27\u201335|url= http://www.zobodat.at/pdf/ANNA_114B_0027-0035.pdf |accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nSome other large wasps are sometimes referred to as hornets, most notably the [[bald-faced hornet]] (''Dolichovespula maculata'') found in North America. It is set apart by its black and ivory coloration. The name \"hornet\" is used for this and related species primarily because of their habit of making aerial nests (similar to the true hornets) rather than subterranean nests. Another example is the [[Australian hornet]] (''Abispa ephippium''), which is actually a species of [[potter wasp]].\n\n==Species (22 extant + 7 \u2020fossil; not including subspecies)==\n{{div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* ''[[Vespa affinis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa analis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa basalis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa bellicosa]]''\n* ''[[Vespa bicolor]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa bilineata]]''\n* ''[[Vespa binghami]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa ciliata]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa cordifera]]''\n* ''[[Vespa crabro]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa crabroniformis]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa dasypodia]]''\n* ''[[Vespa ducalis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa dybowskii]]''\n* ''[[Vespa fervida]]''\n* ''[[Vespa fumida]]''\n* ''[[Vespa luctuosa]]''\n* ''[[Vespa mandarinia]]''\n* ''[[Vespa mocsaryana]]''\n* ''[[Vespa multimaculata]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa nigra]]''\n* ''[[Vespa orientalis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa philippinensis]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa picea]]''\n* ''[[Vespa simillima]]''\n* ''[[Vespa soror]]''\n* ''[[Vespa tropica]]''\n* ''[[Vespa velutina]]''\n* ''[[Vespa vivax]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Notable species===\n* [[Asian giant hornet]] ''Vespa mandarinia''\n**''[[Vespa mandarinia japonica]]'' (sometimes known as ''Japanese giant hornet'') \u2013 the largest wasp, and the most venomous known insect (per sting).<ref name=\"toxicon\"/>\n* [[Asian predatory wasp]] ''Vespa velutina''\n* [[Black-bellied hornet]] ''Vespa basalis''\n* [[Vespa bicolor|Black shield wasp]] ''Vespa bicolor''\n* [[European hornet]] ''Vespa crabro'', (sometimes known as ''Old World Hornet'', or ''Brown Hornet'').\n* [[Greater banded hornet]] ''Vespa tropica''\n* [[Japanese hornet]] ''Vespa simillima'' (sometimes known as ''Japanese yellow hornet'').\n* [[Lesser banded hornet]] ''Vespa affinis''\n* [[Oriental hornet]] ''Vespa orientalis''\n* ''[[Vespa luctuosa]]'' the most lethal wasp venom (per volume).<ref name=\"toxicon\"/>\n* Black hornet ''Vespa dybowskii''\n\n== As food and medicine ==\nHornet larvae are widely accepted as food in mountainous regions in China. \nHornets and their nest are treated as medicine in Traditional Chinese Medicine.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Vespa basalis .jpg|Black-bellied hornet (''[[Vespa basalis]]''), Xingping\nFile:Asian predatory wasp (Vespa velutina var. nigrithorax).jpg|Asian predatory wasp ([[Vespa velutina|''Vespa velutina'' var.

Allergic reactions are commonly treated with [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) injection using a device such as an [[epinephrine autoinjector]], with prompt follow-up treatment in a hospital. In severe cases, allergic individuals may go into [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic shock]] and die unless treated promptly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000033.htm|title=Insect bites and stings: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia}}</ref>\n\n==Attack pheromone==\nHornets, like many social wasps, can mobilize the entire nest to sting in defense, which is highly dangerous to humans and other animals. The attack [[pheromone]] is released in case of threat to the nest. In the case of the [[Asian giant hornet]] (''[[Asian giant hornet|Vespa mandarinia]]'') this is also used to mobilize many workers at once when attacking colonies of their prey, [[honey bee]]s and other ''Vespa'' species.<ref name=chemicals>{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/critter/8137hornets.html|title=Volatile fragrance chemicals may attract unwanted attention from hornets and bees}}</ref> Three biologically active chemicals, 2-[[pentanol]], [[3-methyl-1-butanol]], and 1-methylbutyl 3-methylbutanoate, have been identified for this species. In field tests, 2-pentanol alone triggered mild alarm and defensive behavior, but adding the other two compounds increased aggressiveness in a [[Synergy|synergistic]] effect.<ref name=chemicals/> In the [[European hornet]] (''[[Vespa crabro]]'') the major compound of the alarm pheromone is 2-methyl-3-butene-2-ol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pherobase.com/database/genus/genus-Vespa.php|title=Vespa|work=pherobase.com}}</ref>\n\nIf a hornet is killed near a nest it may release pheromones that can cause the other hornets to attack. Materials that come in contact with these pheromones, such as clothes, skin, and dead prey or hornets, can also trigger an attack, as can certain food flavorings, such as banana and apple flavorings, and fragrances that contain [[Alcohol#Common names|C<sub>5</sub> alcohols]] and C<sub>10</sub> [[esters]].<ref name=chemicals/>\n\n==Diet and feeding==\nAdult hornets and their relatives (e.g., [[yellowjacket]]s) feed themselves with nectar and sugar-rich plant foods. Thus, they can often be found feeding on the sap of [[oak trees]], rotting sweet fruits, honey and any sugar-containing foodstuffs. Hornets frequently fly into orchards to feed on overripe fruit. Hornets tend to gnaw a hole into fruit to become totally immersed into its pulp. A person who accidentally plucks a fruit with a feeding hornet can be attacked by the disturbed insect.\n\nThe adults also attack various insects, which they kill with stings and jaws. Due to their size and the power of their venom, hornets are able to kill large insects such as [[honey bee]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, [[locust]]s and [[katydid]]s without difficulty. The victim is fully masticated and then fed to the [[larvae]] developing in the nest, rather than consumed by the adult hornets. Given that some of their prey are considered pests, hornets may be considered beneficial under some circumstances.\n\nThe larvae of hornets produce a sweet secretion containing sugars and amino acids that is consumed by the workers and queens.<ref>Wheeler, W.M. (1922) Social Life Among the Insects. II. The Scientific Monthly 15(1): 68\u201388</ref>\n\n==Hornets and other Vespidae==\n[[File:Vespa crabro germana with prey Richard Bartz Crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[European hornet]] with the remnants of a [[Western honey bee|honey bee]].]]\n\n{{main|Characteristics of common wasps and bees}}\n\nWhile taxonomically well defined, there may be some confusion about the differences between hornets and other wasps of the family [[Vespidae]], specifically the [[yellowjacket]]s, which are members of the same subfamily. Yellowjackets are generally smaller than hornets and are bright yellow and black, whereas hornets may often be black and white. There is also a related genus of Asian nocturnal vespines, ''[[Provespa]]'', which are referred to as \"night wasps\" or \"night hornets\",<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.vespa-bicolor.net/main/vespid/provespa.htm |title=Untitled Document}}</ref> though they are not true hornets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Madl |first1=M |title=Notes on the genus ''Provespa'' Ashmead, 1903 (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Vespidae: Vespinae) based on the material of the Naturhistorisches Museum Wien (Austria)|journal=Annals Naturhistorisches Museum Wien|date=2012|volume=114|pages=27\u201335|url= http://www.zobodat.at/pdf/ANNA_114B_0027-0035.pdf |accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nSome other large wasps are sometimes referred to as hornets, most notably the [[bald-faced hornet]] (''Dolichovespula maculata'') found in North America. It is set apart by its black and ivory coloration. The name \"hornet\" is used for this and related species primarily because of their habit of making aerial nests (similar to the true hornets) rather than subterranean nests. Another example is the [[Australian hornet]] (''Abispa ephippium''), which is actually a species of [[potter wasp]].\n\n==Species (22 extant + 7 \u2020fossil; not including subspecies)==\n{{div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* ''[[Vespa affinis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa analis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa basalis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa bellicosa]]''\n* ''[[Vespa bicolor]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa bilineata]]''\n* ''[[Vespa binghami]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa ciliata]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa cordifera]]''\n* ''[[Vespa crabro]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa crabroniformis]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa dasypodia]]''\n* ''[[Vespa ducalis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa dybowskii]]''\n* ''[[Vespa fervida]]''\n* ''[[Vespa fumida]]''\n* ''[[Vespa luctuosa]]''\n* ''[[Vespa mandarinia]]''\n* ''[[Vespa mocsaryana]]''\n* ''[[Vespa multimaculata]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa nigra]]''\n* ''[[Vespa orientalis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa philippinensis]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa picea]]''\n* ''[[Vespa simillima]]''\n* ''[[Vespa soror]]''\n* ''[[Vespa tropica]]''\n* ''[[Vespa velutina]]''\n* ''[[Vespa vivax]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Notable species===\n* [[Asian giant hornet]] ''Vespa mandarinia''\n**''[[Vespa mandarinia japonica]]'' (sometimes known as ''Japanese giant hornet'') \u2013 the largest wasp, and the most venomous known insect (per sting).<ref name=\"toxicon\"/>\n* [[Asian predatory wasp]] ''Vespa velutina''\n* [[Black-bellied hornet]] ''Vespa basalis''\n* [[Vespa bicolor|Black shield wasp]] ''Vespa bicolor''\n* [[European hornet]] ''Vespa crabro'', (sometimes known as ''Old World Hornet'', or ''Brown Hornet'').\n* [[Greater banded hornet]] ''Vespa tropica''\n* [[Japanese hornet]] ''Vespa simillima'' (sometimes known as ''Japanese yellow hornet'').\n* [[Lesser banded hornet]] ''Vespa affinis''\n* [[Oriental hornet]] ''Vespa orientalis''\n* ''[[Vespa luctuosa]]'' the most lethal wasp venom (per volume).<ref name=\"toxicon\"/>\n* Black hornet ''Vespa dybowskii''\n\n== As food and medicine ==\nHornet larvae are widely accepted as food in mountainous regions in China. \nHornets and their nest are treated as medicine in Traditional Chinese Medicine.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Vespa basalis .jpg|Black-bellied hornet (''[[Vespa basalis]]''), Xingping\nFile:Asian predatory wasp (Vespa velutina var. nigrithorax).jpg|Asian predatory wasp ([[Vespa velutina|''Vespa velutina'' var.

It was also aired in [[Sri Lanka]] on [[Shakthi TV]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe entire plot of Metti Oli is about the daily happenings of Chidambaram\u2019s five daughters. The father is very patient and always remains calm in whatever circumstances, be it happy or sad. He often gets troubled by Rajam quoting the activities of Saroja, his elder daughter.\n\nChidambaram is a land broker and he has great respect among everyone. He managed to raise all five daughters all by himself as his wife died when they were children. Chidambaram has taken extra care in raising up their girls as disciplined daughters who are very innocent and caring.\n\nDuring the last episodes of the serial, Chidambaram dies in a road accident when he was walking on the road in a depressed state of mind. However, the serial finally ends up on a good note uniting all family members after the death of Chidambaram thereby bringing smiles on everybody\u2019s face.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main characters===\n*[[Delhi Kumar]] as '''Chidambaram'''\n:The story revolves around the lives and pains of his five daughters and eventually his. He is very patient and does not get easily provoked. A land broker by profession, he is greatly respected by all. His wife died when his children were young so he brought them up to be very disciplined girls. At the end of the serial, Chidambaram died in an accident when he carelessly crosses the road in a depressed state of mind.\n\n*[[Kaveri (Tamil actress)|Kaveri]] as '''Dhanalakshmi \"Dhanam\"''', Chidambaram's eldest daughter \n:She is married to her uncle, Bose: A woman who is full of love for her younger sisters but doesn't know how to show it. She is always in an argumentative mood and doesn't hesitate to make rude comments. She is blessed with an understanding uncle-cum-husband and who tolerates her and they have a daughter.\n\n*Gayathri Shastry as '''Saroja \"Saro\"''', Chidambaram's second daughter\n:She is married to Manikam. The couple has a son, Natarajan. Saroja resembles her father in always having patience. She is an easy target for victimization and bears domestic violence after her wedding to Manikkam. Saroja symbolizes the majority of middle-class woman in Indian society. Chidambaram's main worry in this world is Saro and her life. She has a cruel mother-in-law, a violent husband, who uses violence to end any argument that he loses, and a jealous sister-in-law, Nirmala, who cannot bear to see Saro happy. Saro's brother-in-law, Selvam, is the only one who understands her.\n\n*Vanaja as '''Leelavathy \"Leela\"''', Chidambaram's third daughter \n:She is married to Ravi: They have twin girls. Leela is a brave and smart woman. Even though her husband (who hid his first marriage and married with her; his first wife Gayathri Priya died because of his doubting character) suspects her constantly, she tolerates it. Her life is Chidambaram's second worry. She loved Selvam but did not marry him because of Selvam's mother Rajam, who tortured Saro. Her parents-in-law were a great support to her.\n\n*Uma Maheshwari as '''Vijayalakshmi \"Viji/Vijaya\"''', Chidambaram's fourth daughter \n:who is married to Gopi: She had registered marriage with a photographer, but he cheated her after their nuptial so she started disliking guys. She used to work as a nurse in a clinic. Viji gets married to Gopi, an ideal man. He is very loving, but whenever he tries to come close to her, she avoids him because she is reminded of her boyfriend. But when he realises the truth and still consoles her she changes her attitude towards him and they have a son. Viji's mood always changes and Gopi hates that attitude.\n\n*Revathi Priya as '''Bhavani''', Chidambaram's youngest daughter \n:She is very smart girl. She is the only one who is highly educated in their family. She becomes a professor in Singapore towards the end of the serial.
