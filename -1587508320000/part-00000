For them, the August Revolution revived hopes for a 'rightful share' in Cuba's government. On August 16, 1906, fearing the government ready to smash the plot, former Liberation Army general Pino Guerra raised the banner of revolt. Immediately Palma arrested every Liberal politician in reach; the remainder went underground. In an effort to avert intervention Roosevelt sent two emissaries to Havana to seek a compromise between government and opposition. Regarding such impartiality as a vote of censure on his government, Estrada Palma resigned and made his entire cabinet resign too, leaving the Republic without a government and forcing the United States to take control of the island. Roosevelt immediately proclaimed that the USA had been compelled to intervene in Cuba and that their only purpose was to create the necessary conditions for a peaceful election. <ref>https://libraries.ucsd.edu/research-and-collections/collections/notable-collections/latin-american-elections-statistics/Cuba/elections-and-events-19021911.html</ref>\n\n=== 1908\u20131924 ===\nIn 1908, self-government was restored when [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel G\u00f3mez]] was elected President, but the U.S. continued intervening in Cuban affairs.

Immediately Palma arrested every Liberal politician in reach; the remainder went underground. In an effort to avert intervention Roosevelt sent two emissaries to Havana to seek a compromise between government and opposition. Regarding such impartiality as a vote of censure on his government, Estrada Palma resigned and made his entire cabinet resign too, leaving the Republic without a government and forcing the United States to take control of the island.

Such rules include the way in which the participants should look and the way in which they approach, dance with and leave their partner. [[Etiquette]] can vary in its specification and stringency between different [[style of dance|styles of dance]].\n== Why Dance Etiquette is Important ==\nWhy is dance etiquette important? It makes the difference between having a happy or unhappy dancing experience. It helps you avoid offending or upsetting your partner and other dancers. It helps you build a good reputation for yourself as a dancer.\nWhether the style of dance, dance can be a socially intimate activity and you must know the proper dance manners.\n\n== Asking For A Dance ==\nWhen asking for a dance, it is best to stay with traditional phrases:\n*\t``May I have this dance?''\n*\t``Would you like to dance?''\n*\t``Care to dance?''\n*\t``Shall we dance?''\nIn the past men typically have followed the tradition that a man asked a woman to dance. This practice has changed over the years and today woman should feel equally comfortable asking a partner for a dance, no matter the setting. \n\n== Cutting In ==\nCutting in is a process in dancing where a person interrupts two dance partners and claims the partner of one. \nIf a gentleman or woman would like to dance with a someone who is already dancing with another person, he/she may cut in by approaching the dancing couple, tapping the him/her on the shoulder, and asking, \u201cMay I cut in?\u201d \"May I finish this dance?\" etc.\nIt is inappropriate for either member of the dancing pair to refuse the request to cut in.\u00a0If the first gentlemen or woman would like to dance with the other individual again, he/she must wait until the next dance to ask him/her to cut in.\n\n== Declining A Dance/Being Declined ==\n\nBeing declined is always hard to experience for both individuals. Dance etiquette requires that one should avoid declining a dance under most circumstances. For example, there is no correct way of refusing an invitation on the basis of preferring to dance with someone else. According to tradition, the only graceful way of declining a dance is either voice\n* You do not know the dance, \n* You need to take a rest, or \n* You have promised the dance to someone else. \nDancers are encouraged to use discretion and restraint when exercising this option. In some situations, the simplest best way may be to say \u201cNo, Thank You.\u201d \nResponding to a \u201cNo, Thank You\u201d can be tough, but don\u2019t read into it too much. They were polite and honest and maybe just don\u2019t want to dance. Dealing with rejection can show your true colors as well so, move on and go ask someone else, while smiling. \n\n== Dance Hygiene ==\nDance involves an activity where people may be in close contact. Before dancing make sure to\n* Be sure to bathe, \n* Wear deodorant,\n* Keep in mind of your breath, you may need a mint. \nThese are all things everyone should do daily but especially when dancing with a partner. \nMake sure to keep fingernails trimmed and/or out of harm\u2019s way.\nWear appropriate clothing depending on the dance/function attending.\n\n== Western social dance rules ==\n* The dancers move counter clockwise (from above) around the floor.\n* When things go wrong on the dance floor always apologize. Generally it does not matter who is at fault.\n* If you are moving more slowly than other dancers keep to the center of the floor.\n* If you are engaged in conversation move off the dance floor.\n* To cross the room either dance across the floor or walk around the perimeter.\n* Carry food and beverages around the perimeter. Wipe up your own spills.\n* While dancing, do not give dance tips unless asked. If asked, just give tips about what you were asked about. When engaged in giving a lengthy tip, or if you stop dancing to discuss it, move off the dance floor. And, above all, don't give that person tips again until they ask you again.\n* The traditional rule about declining dances was that you could politely turn down a request to dance only by saying something like \"No, thank you. I'm sitting this one out.\" or \"I'd be happy to dance with you later. I just need to rest now\", and that if you turn down a request to dance, to be polite, it was considered important that you not dance at all during the dance in question. Many dance groups today have abandoned this rule, and explicitly say that it's always ok to decline a dance with a simple \"no, thank you\", and no reason need be given.\n* Don't just dance with your favorite dancers. It's called \"social\" dancing for a reason.\n* It is always up to the [[Lead and follow|follow, not the lead]], to set the distance between the partners. However, if the lead feels like he is being held too closely for comfort or safety, they might say something like \"If you move away a little bit, I'll be able to lead you more safely.\" If either partner is not being allowed to set what they feel is a comfortable and safe distance, they should feel free to say that they need to sit down to rest, or something else equally polite.\n* Be aware of sight lines between ourselves, other dancers and the audience when onstage and offstage.\n\n{{Portal|Society}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Ballroom Etiquette ...

The airliner was designed and originally marketed by [[McDonnell Douglas]] as the '''MD-95''', a derivative of the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC-9]] family. Capable of seating up to 134 passengers, the 717 has a design [[Range (aircraft)|range]] of {{convert|2,060|nmi|km|sigfig=3}}. It is powered by two [[Rolls-Royce BR715]] [[turbofan]] engines mounted at the rear of the fuselage.\n\nThe first order was placed in October 1995 by [[ValuJet Airlines]] (later [[AirTran Airways]]); McDonnell Douglas and Boeing merged in 1997 prior to production. The airliner entered service in 1999 as the ''Boeing 717''. Production ceased in May 2006 after 156 were built. There were 148 Boeing 717 aircraft in service {{as of|2018|July|lc=y}}.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Inside a Boeing 717.jpg|thumb|The five-abreast seating is kept from the [[DC-9]].]]\n\n===Background===\n[[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas Aircraft]] launched the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC-9]], a short-[[Range (aircraft)|range]] companion to their larger four-engine [[Douglas DC-8|DC-8]] in 1963.<ref name=\"G_Endres\">Endres, Gunter.

During the early 1980s, as production of the DC-9 family moved away from the smaller Series 30 towards the larger Super 80 (later redesignated [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80|MD-80]]) variants, McDonnell Douglas proposed a smaller version of the DC-9 to fill the gap left by the DC-9-30. Dubbed the DC-9-90, it was revealed in February 1983 and was to be some {{cvt|25|ft|4|in}} shorter than the DC-9-81, giving it an overall length of {{cvt|122|ft|6|in}}. The aircraft was proposed with a {{cvt|17000|lbf|kN}} thrust version of the [[Pratt & Whitney JT8D|JT8D-200]] series engine, although the [[CFM International CFM56|CFM International CFM56-3]] was also considered. Seating up to 117 passengers, the DC-9-90 was to be equipped with the DC-9's wing with {{cvt|2|ft}} tip extensions, rather than the more heavily modified increased area of the MD-80. The aircraft had a design range of {{cvt|1430|nmi|km|0}}, with an option to increase to {{cvt|2060|nmi|km|0}}, and a gross weight of {{cvt|112000|lb}}.<ref name=aero_19/>\n\nThe DC-9-90 was designed to meet the needs of the newly deregulated American airline industry. However, its development was postponed due to the recession of the early 1980s. When McDonnell Douglas did develop a smaller version of the MD-80, it simply shrunk the aircraft to create the MD-87, rather than offer a lower thrust, lighter aircraft that was more comparable to the DC-9-30. With its relatively high MTOW and powerful engines, the MD-87 essentially became a special mission aircraft and could not compete with the all new 100-seaters then being developed. Although an excellent aircraft for specialized roles, the MD-87 often was not sold on its own. Relying on its commonality factor, sales were generally limited to existing MD-80 operators.<ref name=\"airclaims\"/>\n\nIn 1991, McDonnell Douglas revealed that it was again considering developing a specialized 100-seat version of the MD-80, initially named the ''MD-87-105'' (105 seats). It was to be some {{cvt|8|ft}} shorter than the MD-87, powered with engines in the {{cvt|16000|-|17000|lbf|kN}} thrust class.<ref name=\"airclaims\"/> McDonnell Douglas, Pratt & Whitney, and the China National Aero-Technology Import Export Agency signed a memorandum of understanding to develop a 105-seat version of the MD-80. At the 1991 Paris Airshow, McDonnell Douglas announced the development of a 105-seat aircraft, designated ''MD-95''.<ref name=\"airclaims\"/> The new name was selected to reflect the anticipated year deliveries would begin.<ref name=\"douglas\"/> McDonnell Douglas first offered the MD-95 for sale in 1994.<ref name=\"douglas\">{{cite book|last= Norris |first= Guy |authorlink= |author2=Wagner, Mark |title= Douglas Jetliners |publisher= MBI Publishing |year=1999 |location= |isbn= 0-7603-0676-1}}</ref><ref name=Becher>Becher, Thomas.

Major changes included a fuselage \"shrink\" back to {{cvt|119|ft|4|in}} length (same as the DC-9-30), and the reversion to the original DC-9 wingspan of {{cvt|93|ft|5|in}}. At this time, McDonnell Douglas said that it expected the MD-95 to become a family of aircraft with the capability of increased range and seating capacity.<ref name=\"airclaims\"/> The MD-95 was developed to satisfy the market need to replace early DC-9s, then approaching 30 years old. The MD-95 was a complete overhaul, going back to the original [[DC-9-10|DC-9-30]] design and applying new engines, cockpit and other more modern systems.<ref name=\"douglas\"/>\n\nIn March 1995, longtime McDonnell Douglas customer [[Scandinavian Airlines System]] (SAS) chose the Boeing 737-600 for its 100-seater over the MD-95.<ref name=\"douglas\"/> In October 1995, U.S. new entrant and low-cost carrier [[ValuJet Airlines|ValuJet]] signed an order for 50 MD-95s, plus 50 options.<ref name=\"douglas\"/> McDonnell Douglas president [[Harry Stonecipher]] felt that launching MD-95 production on the basis of this single order held little risk, stating that further orders would \"take a while longer\".<ref>Lopez, Ramon and Guy Norris.

This was confirmed in January 1992, when [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] and McDonnell Douglas signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] concerning the Tay-powered MD-95. McDonnell Douglas said that the MD-95 project would cost only a minimal amount to develop, as it was a direct offshoot of the IAE-powered MD-90.<ref name=\"airclaims\"/>\n\nDuring 1993 McDonnell Douglas seemed to be favoring a life extension program of the DC-9-30, under the program name DC-9X, to continue its presence in the 100-120 seat market, rather than concentrating on the new build MD-95. In its evaluation of the engine upgrades available for the DC-9X, McDonnell Douglas found that the [[Rolls-Royce BR700|BMW Rolls-Royce BR700]] engine to be the ideal candidate, and on February 23, 1994 the BR700 was selected as the sole powerplant for the airliner.<ref name=\"airclaims\"/>\n\n===Production site===\n[[File:Vistas (3563920446).jpg|thumb|The Boeing 717 was assembled at the company's facility at the Long Beach Airport, California; parts came from all over the world.]]\n\nMcDonnell Douglas was planning for MD-95 final assembly to be undertaken in China, as an offshoot of the Trunkliner program, for which McDonnell Douglas had been negotiating to have up to 150 MD-90s built in China. The MD-90 Trunkliner deal was finalized in June 1992, but the contract was for a total of 40 aircraft, including 20 MD-80Ts and 20 -90Ts. The MD-80 has been license built in Shanghai since the 1980s. However, in early 1993, MDC said that it was considering sites outside China, and was later seeking alternative locations for the assembly line. In 1994, McDonnell Douglas sought global partners to share development costs. It also began a search for a low-cost final assembly site. Halla Group in South Korea was selected to make the wings; Alenia of Italy the entire fuselage; Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. of Taiwan, the tail; ShinMaywa of Japan, the horizontal stabilizer; and a manufacturing division of Korean Air Lines, the nose and cockpit.<ref name=\"airclaims\"/>\n\nOn November 8, 1994, McDonnell Douglas announced that final assembly would be taken away from the longtime Douglas plant at [[Long Beach Airport]], California. Instead, it selected a modifications and maintenance operation, Dalfort Aviation in Dallas, Texas, to assemble the MD-95. In early 1995, management and unions in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] reached an agreement to hold down wage costs for the life of the MD-95 program and McDonnell Douglas canceled the preliminary agreement with Dalfort.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20031130&slug=boeingoutsource30 |title=Business & Technology&nbsp;\u2014 Parallels in production: 7E7 and 717 - Seattle Times Newspaper|work=nwsource.com}}</ref>\n\n===Rebranding and marketing===\nAfter McDonnell Douglas was acquired by Boeing in August 1997,<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/16/news/16iht-merge.t_0.html Retrieved 2016-08-08</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Boeing: History -- Higher, Faster, Further&nbsp;\u2014 The Boeing Company ...

Production of the original 717 continued. Boeing continued to believe that the 100-passenger market would be lucrative enough to support both the 717 and the 737-600, the smallest of the Next-Generation 737 series.

During the early 1980s, as production of the DC-9 family moved away from the smaller Series 30 towards the larger Super 80 (later redesignated [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80|MD-80]]) variants, McDonnell Douglas proposed a smaller version of the DC-9 to fill the gap left by the DC-9-30. Dubbed the DC-9-90, it was revealed in February 1983 and was to be some {{cvt|25|ft|4|in}} shorter than the DC-9-81, giving it an overall length of {{cvt|122|ft|6|in}}. The aircraft was proposed with a {{cvt|17000|lbf|kN}} thrust version of the [[Pratt & Whitney JT8D|JT8D-200]] series engine, although the [[CFM International CFM56|CFM International CFM56-3]] was also considered. Seating up to 117 passengers, the DC-9-90 was to be equipped with the DC-9's wing with {{cvt|2|ft}} tip extensions, rather than the more heavily modified increased area of the MD-80. The aircraft had a design range of {{cvt|1430|nmi|km|0}}, with an option to increase to {{cvt|2060|nmi|km|0}}, and a gross weight of {{cvt|112000|lb}}.<ref name=aero_19/>\n\nThe DC-9-90 was designed to meet the needs of the newly deregulated American airline industry. However, its development was postponed due to the recession of the early 1980s. When McDonnell Douglas did develop a smaller version of the MD-80, it simply shrunk the aircraft to create the MD-87, rather than offer a lower thrust, lighter aircraft that was more comparable to the DC-9-30. With its relatively high MTOW and powerful engines, the MD-87 essentially became a special mission aircraft and could not compete with the all new 100-seaters then being developed. Although an excellent aircraft for specialized roles, the MD-87 often was not sold on its own. Relying on its commonality factor, sales were generally limited to existing MD-80 operators.<ref name=\"airclaims\"/>\n\nIn 1991, McDonnell Douglas revealed that it was again considering developing a specialized 100-seat version of the MD-80, initially named the ''MD-87-105'' (105 seats). It was to be some {{cvt|8|ft}} shorter than the MD-87, powered with engines in the {{cvt|16000|-|17000|lbf|kN}} thrust class.<ref name=\"airclaims\"/> McDonnell Douglas, Pratt & Whitney, and the China National Aero-Technology Import Export Agency signed a memorandum of understanding to develop a 105-seat version of the MD-80. At the 1991 Paris Airshow, McDonnell Douglas announced the development of a 105-seat aircraft, designated ''MD-95''.<ref name=\"airclaims\"/> The new name was selected to reflect the anticipated year deliveries would begin.<ref name=\"douglas\"/> McDonnell Douglas first offered the MD-95 for sale in 1994.<ref name=\"douglas\">{{cite book|last= Norris |first= Guy |authorlink= |author2=Wagner, Mark |title= Douglas Jetliners |publisher= MBI Publishing |year=1999 |location= |isbn= 0-7603-0676-1}}</ref><ref name=Becher>Becher, Thomas.

Major changes included a fuselage \"shrink\" back to {{cvt|119|ft|4|in}} length (same as the DC-9-30), and the reversion to the original DC-9 wingspan of {{cvt|93|ft|5|in}}. At this time, McDonnell Douglas said that it expected the MD-95 to become a family of aircraft with the capability of increased range and seating capacity.<ref name=\"airclaims\"/> The MD-95 was developed to satisfy the market need to replace early DC-9s, then approaching 30 years old. The MD-95 was a complete overhaul, going back to the original [[DC-9-10|DC-9-30]] design and applying new engines, cockpit and other more modern systems.<ref name=\"douglas\"/>\n\nIn March 1995, longtime McDonnell Douglas customer [[Scandinavian Airlines System]] (SAS) chose the Boeing 737-600 for its 100-seater over the MD-95.<ref name=\"douglas\"/> In October 1995, U.S. new entrant and low-cost carrier [[ValuJet Airlines|ValuJet]] signed an order for 50 MD-95s, plus 50 options.<ref name=\"douglas\"/> McDonnell Douglas president [[Harry Stonecipher]] felt that launching MD-95 production on the basis of this single order held little risk, stating that further orders would \"take a while longer\".<ref>Lopez, Ramon and Guy Norris.

Flight International, October 25\u201331, 1995.</ref> The ValuJet order was the only order received for some two years.<ref name=Becher/>\n\n===Engines===\nAs first proposed, the MD-95 was to be powered by a {{cvt|16500|lbf|kN}} thrust derivative of the JT8D-200 series with the [[Rolls-Royce RB.183 Tay|Rolls-Royce Tay 670]] also considered as an alternative. This was confirmed in January 1992, when [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] and McDonnell Douglas signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] concerning the Tay-powered MD-95. McDonnell Douglas said that the MD-95 project would cost only a minimal amount to develop, as it was a direct offshoot of the IAE-powered MD-90.<ref name=\"airclaims\"/>\n\nDuring 1993 McDonnell Douglas seemed to be favoring a life extension program of the DC-9-30, under the program name DC-9X, to continue its presence in the 100-120 seat market, rather than concentrating on the new build MD-95. In its evaluation of the engine upgrades available for the DC-9X, McDonnell Douglas found that the [[Rolls-Royce BR700|BMW Rolls-Royce BR700]] engine to be the ideal candidate, and on February 23, 1994 the BR700 was selected as the sole powerplant for the airliner.<ref name=\"airclaims\"/>\n\n===Production site===\n[[File:Vistas (3563920446).jpg|thumb|The Boeing 717 was assembled at the company's facility at the Long Beach Airport, California; parts came from all over the world.]]\n\nMcDonnell Douglas was planning for MD-95 final assembly to be undertaken in China, as an offshoot of the Trunkliner program, for which McDonnell Douglas had been negotiating to have up to 150 MD-90s built in China. The MD-90 Trunkliner deal was finalized in June 1992, but the contract was for a total of 40 aircraft, including 20 MD-80Ts and 20 -90Ts. The MD-80 has been license built in Shanghai since the 1980s. However, in early 1993, MDC said that it was considering sites outside China, and was later seeking alternative locations for the assembly line. In 1994, McDonnell Douglas sought global partners to share development costs. It also began a search for a low-cost final assembly site. Halla Group in South Korea was selected to make the wings; Alenia of Italy the entire fuselage; Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. of Taiwan, the tail; ShinMaywa of Japan, the horizontal stabilizer; and a manufacturing division of Korean Air Lines, the nose and cockpit.<ref name=\"airclaims\"/>\n\nOn November 8, 1994, McDonnell Douglas announced that final assembly would be taken away from the longtime Douglas plant at [[Long Beach Airport]], California. Instead, it selected a modifications and maintenance operation, Dalfort Aviation in Dallas, Texas, to assemble the MD-95. In early 1995, management and unions in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] reached an agreement to hold down wage costs for the life of the MD-95 program and McDonnell Douglas canceled the preliminary agreement with Dalfort.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20031130&slug=boeingoutsource30 |title=Business & Technology&nbsp;\u2014 Parallels in production: 7E7 and 717 - Seattle Times Newspaper|work=nwsource.com}}</ref>\n\n===Rebranding and marketing===\nAfter McDonnell Douglas was acquired by Boeing in August 1997,<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/16/news/16iht-merge.t_0.html Retrieved 2016-08-08</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Boeing: History -- Higher, Faster, Further&nbsp;\u2014 The Boeing Company ...

Production of the original 717 continued. Boeing continued to believe that the 100-passenger market would be lucrative enough to support both the 717 and the 737-600, the smallest of the Next-Generation 737 series. While the aircraft were similar in overall size, the 737-600 was better suited to long-distance routes, while the lighter 717 was more efficient on shorter, regional routes.<ref name=\"Janes\"/><ref name=713r>{{cite press release|title=Boeing Releases Proposed 717-300X Rendering|url=http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2003-09-18-Boeing-Releases-Proposed-717-300X-Rendering |date=September 18, 2003 |access-date=2015-07-07}}</ref>\n\n===Assembly line and end of production===\nIn 2001, Boeing began implementing a moving assembly line for production of the 717 and 737.<ref>[http://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/companyoffices/financial/finreports/annual/01annualreport/BOEING2001AR_all.pdf Boeing 2001 Annual report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923193835/http://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/companyoffices/financial/finreports/annual/01annualreport/BOEING2001AR_all.pdf |date=September 23, 2015 }}</ref> The moving line greatly reduced production time, which led to lower production costs.<ref name=717_innovations>[http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2005/october/i_ca2.html \"Going\u2014but far from gone, 717 innovations live on long after production\"].

Flight deck features include an Electronic Instrument System, a dual Flight Management System, a Central Fault Display System, and Global Positioning System. Category IIIb automatic landing capability for bad-weather operations and Future Air Navigation Systems are available. The 717 shares the same type rating as the DC-9, such that the FAA approved transition courses for DC-9 and analog MD-80 pilots that could be completed in 11 days.<ref name=alpa>{{cite journal |url=http://cf.alpa.org/internet/alp/2000/marb717.htm |title=Flying the B-717-200 |author=Rogers, Ron |journal=Air Line Pilot |date=March 2000 |page=26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215195504/http://cf.alpa.org/internet/alp/2000/marb717.htm |archivedate=December 15, 2007 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn conjunction with Parker Hannifin, MPC Products of Skokie, Illinois designed a fly-by-wire technology mechanical control suite for the 717 flight deck.
