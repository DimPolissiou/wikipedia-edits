Politically, the term refers to three [[provinces and territories of Canada|territories of Canada]]: [[Yukon]], [[Northwest Territories]], and [[Nunavut]]. Similarly, ''the Far North'' (when contrasted to ''the North'') may refer to the Canadian [[Arctic]]: the portion of Canada that lies north of the [[Arctic Circle]], east of [[Alaska]] and west of [[Greenland]]. This area covers about 39% of Canada's total land area, but has less than 1% of [[demographics of Canada|Canada's population]].\n\nThese reckonings somewhat depend on the arbitrary concept of [[nordicity]], a measure of so-called \"northernness\" that other Arctic territories share. Canada is the northernmost country in the Americas (excluding the neighbouring [[Denmark|Danish]] Arctic territory of [[Greenland]] which extends slightly further north) and roughly 80% of its 35 million residents are concentrated along [[Canada\u2013United States border|its southern border]] with the United States.\n\n==Definitions==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The different climates of these two regions result in vastly different vegetation, and therefore very different economies, settlement patterns, and histories.\n\n[[File:Taiga Landscape in Canada.jpg|thumb|left|A [[boreal forest of Canada|boreal forest]] landscape in [[Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec|Northern Quebec]].]]\nThe \"near north\" or [[subarctic]] is mostly synonymous with the [[boreal forest of Canada|Canadian boreal forest]], a large area of [[evergreen]]-dominated forests with a [[subarctic climate]]. This area has traditionally been home to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Subarctic]], that is the [[First Nations]], who were [[hunter-gatherer|hunters]] of [[moose]], freshwater [[fisherman|fishers]] and [[Animal trapping|trappers]]. This region was heavily involved in the [[North American fur trade]] during its peak importance, and is home to many [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis people]] who originated in that trade. The area was mostly part of [[Rupert's Land]] or the [[North-Western Territory]] under the nominal control of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) from 1670\u20131869. The HBC's claim was purchased by the Canadian government in 1869, and shortly thereafter the government made a [[Numbered Treaties|series of treaties with the local First Nations]] regarding land title. This opened the region to non-Native settlement, as well as to forestry, mining, and oil and gas drilling. Today several million people live in the near north, around 15% of the Canadian total. Large parts of the near north are not part of Canada's territories, but rather are the northern parts of the provinces, meaning they have very different political histories as minority regions within larger units.\n\n[[File:Nunavut tundra -c.jpg|thumb|left|A typical [[tundra]] landscape in [[Nunavut]].]]\nThe \"far north\" is synonymous with the areas north of the [[tree line]]: the [[Barren Grounds]] and [[tundra]]. This area is home to the various sub-groups of the [[Inuit]], a people unrelated to other [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]]. These are people who have traditionally relied mostly on hunting [[marine mammal]]s and [[Reindeer|caribou]], mainly [[barren-ground caribou]], as well as fish and migratory birds. This area was somewhat involved in the [[fur trade]], but was more influenced by the [[history of whaling|whaling industry]]. This area was not part of the early 20th century treaty process and [[aboriginal title]] to the land has been acknowledged by the Canadian government with the creation of [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous territories]] instead of the [[Indian reserve]]s of further south. Very few non-Aboriginal people have settled in these areas, and the residents of the far north represent less than 1% of Canada's total population. The far north is also often broken into west and eastern halves. The '''eastern Arctic''' which means the self-governing territory of Nunavut (much of which is in the true Arctic, being north of the Arctic Circle); [[Nunavik]], an autonomous part of the province of Quebec; [[Nunatsiavut]], an autonomous part of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador; and perhaps a few parts of the [[Hudson Bay]] coast of Ontario and Manitoba. The '''western Arctic''' is the northernmost portion of the Northwest Territories (roughly [[Inuvik Region]]) and a small part of Yukon, together called the [[Inuvialuit Settlement Region]].\n\n==Territoriality==\nSince 1925, Canada has claimed the portion of the Arctic between [[60th meridian west|60\u00b0W]] and [[141st meridian west|141\u00b0W]] longitude, extending all the way north to the [[North Pole]]: all islands in the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] and [[Herschel Island|Herschel]], off the Yukon coast, form part of the region, are Canadian territory and the [[territorial waters]] claimed by Canada surround these islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlas.gc.ca/site/english/maps/historical/territorialevolution/1927/1| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509193315/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/historical/territorialevolution/1927/1 |archivedate=May 9, 2012 |title=Territorial Evolution, 1927 |date=March 18, 2009}}</ref> Views of territorial claims in this region are complicated by disagreements on legal principles. Canada and the [[Soviet Union]]/Russia have long claimed that their territory extends according to the sector principle to the North Pole. The United States does not accept the sector principle and does not make a sector claim based on its [[Alaska]]n Arctic coast. Claims that undersea geographic features are extensions of a country's [[continental shelf]] are also used to support claims; for example the Denmark/[[Greenland]] claim on territory to the North Pole, some of which is disputed by Canada. Foreign ships, both civilian and military, are allowed the right of [[innocent passage]] through the territorial waters of a [[Littoral zone|littoral]] state subject to conditions in the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globelaw.com/LawSea/ls82_1.htm|title=GlobeLaw.com|website=www.globelaw.com}}</ref> The right of innocent passage is not allowed, however, in [[internal waters]], which are enclosed bodies of water or waters landward of a chain of islands. Disagreements about the sector principle or extension of territory to the North Pole and about the definition of internal waters in the Arctic lie behind differences in [[territorial claims in the Arctic]]. This claim is recognized by most countries with some exceptions, including the United States; Denmark, Russia, and Norway have made claims similar to those of Canada in the Arctic and are opposed by the European Union and the U.S. This is especially important with the [[Northwest Passage]]. Canada asserts control of this passage as part of the [[Canadian Internal Waters]] because it is within {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} of Canadian islands; the U.S. claims that it is in [[international waters]]. Today ice and freezing temperatures make this a minor issue, but [[climate change]] may make the passage more accessible to shipping, something that concerns the Canadian government and inhabitants of the environmentally sensitive region.<ref>Paikin, Zach. \"[http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/Canada-The-Arctic-Middle-Man-2014-08-21 Canada: The Arctic Middle Man]\" ''Maritime Executive'', 21 August 2014. Accessed: 11 September 2014.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the disputed [[Hans Island]] (with Denmark), in the [[Nares Strait]], which is west of Greenland, may be an indication of challenges to overall Canadian sovereignty in the North.\n\n==Topography (geography)==\n[[File:Spring in the Canadian Arctic.jpg|thumb|The western Canadian Arctic early June 2010.]]\n\nWhile the largest part of the Arctic is composed of [[sea ice|permanent ice]] and tundra north of the tree line, it encompasses geological regions of varying types: the [[Innuitian Mountains]], associated with the [[Arctic Cordillera]] mountain system, are geologically distinct from the Arctic Region (which consists largely of [[Upland and lowland (freshwater ecology)|lowlands]]). The [[Arctic Lowlands|Arctic]] and [[Hudson Bay Lowlands]] comprise a substantial part of the geographic region often considered part of the [[Canadian Shield]] (in contrast to the sole geological area). The ground in the Arctic is mostly composed of [[permafrost]], making construction difficult and often hazardous, and agriculture virtually impossible.\n\nThe Arctic [[drainage basin|watershed (or drainage basin)]] drains northern parts of Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia, most of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut as well as parts of Yukon into the [[Arctic Ocean]], including the [[Beaufort Sea]] and [[Baffin Bay]]. With the exception of the [[Mackenzie River]], Canada's longest river, this watershed has been little used for [[hydroelectricity]]. The [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace]] and [[Athabasca River|Athabasca]] rivers along with [[Great Bear Lake|Great Bear]] and [[Great Slave Lake]] (respectively the largest and second [[List of lakes by area|largest lakes]] wholly enclosed within Canada), are significant elements of the Arctic watershed. Each of these elements eventually merges with the Mackenzie so that it thereby drains the vast majority of the Arctic watershed.\n\n==Climate==\n\n===Overview===\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], much of Northern Canada has a [[subarctic climate]], with a [[tundra climate]] in most of the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] and an [[Ice cap climate]] in [[Arctic Cordillera]].<ref name=Peel>{{cite journal | author=Peel, M.

This area has traditionally been home to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Subarctic]], that is the [[First Nations]], who were [[hunter-gatherer|hunters]] of [[moose]], freshwater [[fisherman|fishers]] and [[Animal trapping|trappers]]. This region was heavily involved in the [[North American fur trade]] during its peak importance, and is home to many [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis people]] who originated in that trade. The area was mostly part of [[Rupert's Land]] or the [[North-Western Territory]] under the nominal control of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) from 1670\u20131869. The HBC's claim was purchased by the Canadian government in 1869, and shortly thereafter the government made a [[Numbered Treaties|series of treaties with the local First Nations]] regarding land title. This opened the region to non-Native settlement, as well as to forestry, mining, and oil and gas drilling. Today several million people live in the near north, around 15% of the Canadian total. Large parts of the near north are not part of Canada's territories, but rather are the northern parts of the provinces, meaning they have very different political histories as minority regions within larger units.\n\n[[File:Nunavut tundra -c.jpg|thumb|left|A typical [[tundra]] landscape in [[Nunavut]].]]\nThe \"far north\" is synonymous with the areas north of the [[tree line]]: the [[Barren Grounds]] and [[tundra]]. This area is home to the various sub-groups of the [[Inuit]], a people unrelated to other [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]]. These are people who have traditionally relied mostly on hunting [[marine mammal]]s and [[Reindeer|caribou]], mainly [[barren-ground caribou]], as well as fish and migratory birds. This area was somewhat involved in the [[fur trade]], but was more influenced by the [[history of whaling|whaling industry]]. This area was not part of the early 20th century treaty process and [[aboriginal title]] to the land has been acknowledged by the Canadian government with the creation of [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous territories]] instead of the [[Indian reserve]]s of further south. Very few non-Aboriginal people have settled in these areas, and the residents of the far north represent less than 1% of Canada's total population. The far north is also often broken into west and eastern halves. The '''eastern Arctic''' which means the self-governing territory of Nunavut (much of which is in the true Arctic, being north of the Arctic Circle); [[Nunavik]], an autonomous part of the province of Quebec; [[Nunatsiavut]], an autonomous part of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador; and perhaps a few parts of the [[Hudson Bay]] coast of Ontario and Manitoba. The '''western Arctic''' is the northernmost portion of the Northwest Territories (roughly [[Inuvik Region]]) and a small part of Yukon, together called the [[Inuvialuit Settlement Region]].\n\n==Territoriality==\nSince 1925, Canada has claimed the portion of the Arctic between [[60th meridian west|60\u00b0W]] and [[141st meridian west|141\u00b0W]] longitude, extending all the way north to the [[North Pole]]: all islands in the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] and [[Herschel Island|Herschel]], off the Yukon coast, form part of the region, are Canadian territory and the [[territorial waters]] claimed by Canada surround these islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlas.gc.ca/site/english/maps/historical/territorialevolution/1927/1| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509193315/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/historical/territorialevolution/1927/1 |archivedate=May 9, 2012 |title=Territorial Evolution, 1927 |date=March 18, 2009}}</ref> Views of territorial claims in this region are complicated by disagreements on legal principles. Canada and the [[Soviet Union]]/Russia have long claimed that their territory extends according to the sector principle to the North Pole. The United States does not accept the sector principle and does not make a sector claim based on its [[Alaska]]n Arctic coast. Claims that undersea geographic features are extensions of a country's [[continental shelf]] are also used to support claims; for example the Denmark/[[Greenland]] claim on territory to the North Pole, some of which is disputed by Canada. Foreign ships, both civilian and military, are allowed the right of [[innocent passage]] through the territorial waters of a [[Littoral zone|littoral]] state subject to conditions in the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globelaw.com/LawSea/ls82_1.htm|title=GlobeLaw.com|website=www.globelaw.com}}</ref> The right of innocent passage is not allowed, however, in [[internal waters]], which are enclosed bodies of water or waters landward of a chain of islands. Disagreements about the sector principle or extension of territory to the North Pole and about the definition of internal waters in the Arctic lie behind differences in [[territorial claims in the Arctic]]. This claim is recognized by most countries with some exceptions, including the United States; Denmark, Russia, and Norway have made claims similar to those of Canada in the Arctic and are opposed by the European Union and the U.S. This is especially important with the [[Northwest Passage]]. Canada asserts control of this passage as part of the [[Canadian Internal Waters]] because it is within {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} of Canadian islands; the U.S. claims that it is in [[international waters]]. Today ice and freezing temperatures make this a minor issue, but [[climate change]] may make the passage more accessible to shipping, something that concerns the Canadian government and inhabitants of the environmentally sensitive region.<ref>Paikin, Zach. \"[http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/Canada-The-Arctic-Middle-Man-2014-08-21 Canada: The Arctic Middle Man]\" ''Maritime Executive'', 21 August 2014.

The [[Arctic Lowlands|Arctic]] and [[Hudson Bay Lowlands]] comprise a substantial part of the geographic region often considered part of the [[Canadian Shield]] (in contrast to the sole geological area). The ground in the Arctic is mostly composed of [[permafrost]], making construction difficult and often hazardous, and agriculture virtually impossible.\n\nThe Arctic [[drainage basin|watershed (or drainage basin)]] drains northern parts of Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia, most of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut as well as parts of Yukon into the [[Arctic Ocean]], including the [[Beaufort Sea]] and [[Baffin Bay]]. With the exception of the [[Mackenzie River]], Canada's longest river, this watershed has been little used for [[hydroelectricity]]. The [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace]] and [[Athabasca River|Athabasca]] rivers along with [[Great Bear Lake|Great Bear]] and [[Great Slave Lake]] (respectively the largest and second [[List of lakes by area|largest lakes]] wholly enclosed within Canada), are significant elements of the Arctic watershed. Each of these elements eventually merges with the Mackenzie so that it thereby drains the vast majority of the Arctic watershed.\n\n==Climate==\n\n===Overview===\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], much of Northern Canada has a [[subarctic climate]], with a [[tundra climate]] in most of the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] and an [[Ice cap climate]] in [[Arctic Cordillera]].<ref name=Peel>{{cite journal | author=Peel, M.

In 2014 he won this Grammy Award again (that meanwhile changed the name to \"Best Music Film\"), this time for \"Live Kisses\" [[Paul McCartney]] concert film.

He also directed Candlemass' first video \"Bewitched\". He first found fame as the main video director for [[Roxette]]. In 1997, he directed the acclaimed video for [[The Prodigy]]'s \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\", which sparked controversy due to its depiction of drug use, violence, and nudity. In 1998, he worked with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for the song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\", and has since worked with acts such as [[Metallica]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[U2]], [[Blink-182]], [[P!nk]], [[Rammstein]], [[Britney Spears]], and [[Lady Gaga]]. He directed the music video for the [[Smashing Pumpkins]]' \"Try, Try, Try\", from which a short film entitled ''Try'' was spawned. He was also the designer and photographer for the [[Roxette]] album ''[[Room Service (Roxette album)|Room Service]]'' in 2001. In 2002, his first full-length film, ''[[Spun]]'', debuted.\n\n\u00c5kerlund directed commercials for Swedish clothing retailer MQ and the re-imagining of the Devo song \"Watch Us Work It\" used in [[Dell Computers]] commercials. He is a long-time collaborator of Madonna, having worked on such music videos as \"Music\", \"American Life\" (which was pulled due to its graphic content and the [[Iraq War]]), and \"Jump\". He also directed her documentary film ''[[I'm Going to Tell You a Secret]]'' and her concert special ''[[The Confessions Tour (album)|The Confessions Tour: Live from London]]''. Among his more recent works were the controversial pornographic music video for [[Rammstein]]'s \"[[Pussy (Rammstein song)|Pussy]]\", the video for the song \"[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]\" by

His video for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\" won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Best Music Video, Short Form]], and a record seven awards at [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]], including the [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]].\n\nIn 2008 he won another Grammy Award, this time around for \"Best Long Form Music Video\" for another work with Madonna \u2013 directing \"The Confessions Tour\" DVD. In 2014 he won this Grammy Award again (that meanwhile changed the name to \"Best Music Film\"), this time for \"Live Kisses\" [[Paul McCartney]] concert film. Jonas \u00c5kerlund, [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]] and Bob Smeaton are the only directors to have won this award twice sharing the record for most wins in this category (check here all winners and nominees of [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film]]).\n\n==Career==\n\u00c5kerlund was a member of the Swedish [[black metal]] band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] from 1983 to 1984. He also directed Candlemass' first video \"Bewitched\". He first found fame as the main video director for [[Roxette]]. In 1997, he directed the acclaimed video for [[The Prodigy]]'s \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\", which sparked controversy due to its depiction of drug use, violence, and nudity. In 1998, he worked with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for the song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\", and has since worked with acts such as [[Metallica]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[U2]], [[Blink-182]], [[P!nk]], [[Rammstein]], [[Britney Spears]], and [[Lady Gaga]]. He directed the music video for the [[Smashing Pumpkins]]' \"Try, Try, Try\", from which a short film entitled ''Try'' was spawned. He was also the designer and photographer for the [[Roxette]] album ''[[Room Service (Roxette album)|Room Service]]'' in 2001. In 2002, his first full-length film, ''[[Spun]]'', debuted.\n\n\u00c5kerlund directed commercials for Swedish clothing retailer MQ and the re-imagining of the Devo song \"Watch Us Work It\" used in [[Dell Computers]] commercials. He is a long-time collaborator of Madonna, having worked on such music videos as \"Music\", \"American Life\" (which was pulled due to its graphic content and the [[Iraq War]]), and \"Jump\". He also directed her documentary film ''[[I'm Going to Tell You a Secret]]'' and her concert special ''[[The Confessions Tour (album)|The Confessions Tour: Live from London]]''. Among his more recent works were the controversial pornographic music video for [[Rammstein]]'s \"[[Pussy (Rammstein song)|Pussy]]\", the video for the song \"[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]\" by [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Beyonc\u00e9]], \"[[Moves like Jagger]]\" by [[Maroon 5]] and [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Duran Duran]]'s single \"Girl Panic!\".<ref name=\"MTV gaga\">{{cite

Roe believed that [[Harry Truman]] would be defeated in the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 election]] and decided that the Queens delegation would not support anyone at the [[1948 Democratic National Convention]]. The delegation voted for Roe on the first ballot. Despite his move and calls for him to resign, Roe was re-elected as party leader.<ref name=NYTimesObit/>\n\nRoe supported the successful candidacy of [[Vincent R. Impellitteri]] for mayor in 1950 but found himself at odds with [[Tammany Hall]] when Impellitteri ran for re-election in 1953. The Tammany-backed candidate, [[Robert F. Wagner Jr.]], refused Roe\u2019s endorsement and worked to oust him from the party. His refusal to support [[W. Averell Harriman]] for [[Governor of New York]] in 1954 led to his ouster.<ref name=NYTimesObit/> He continued to work behind the scenes as an insurgent and supported some successful candidates; but did not return to the party leadership.\n\nHe was a delegate to the National Democratic conventions in [[1940 Democratic National Convention|1940]], [[1948 Democratic National Convention|1948]] and [[1960 Democratic National Convention|1960]].\n\n==Personal life==\nDuring the war he met Margaret Farrell, whom he married in 1920. They had four children. His son, James A. Roe Jr., served as a justice of the [[New York Supreme Court]].

One who has experienced such contact is often called a [[prophet]]. Christianity considers the [[Bible]] as divinely or [[Supernatural revelation|supernaturally revealed]] or inspired. Such revelation does not always require the presence of God or an angel. For instance, in the concept called of [[interior locution]] by [[Catholic]]s, supernatural revelation can include just an inner voice heard by the recipient.\n\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] first described two types of revelation in Christianity as [[general revelation]] and [[special revelation]]. General revelation occurs through observation of the created order. Such observations can logically lead to important conclusions, such as the existence of God and some of God's attributes. General revelation is also an element of [[Christian apologetics]]. Certain specifics, such as the [[Trinity]] and the [[Incarnation]], are revealed in the teachings in the Scriptures and can not otherwise be deduced except by special revelation.\n\n===Biblical inspiration===\n{{Main|Biblical inspiration}}\n[[File:The Evangelist Matthew Inspired by an Angel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rembrandt]]'s ''The Evangelist Matthew Inspired by an Angel''.]]\nThe [[Bible]] contains many passages in which the authors claim divine inspiration for their message or report the effects of such inspiration on others. Besides the direct accounts of written [[revelation]], such as [[Moses]] receiving the [[Ten Commandments]], the [[Prophet]]s of the [[Old Testament]] frequently claimed that their message was of divine origin by prefacing the revelation using the following phrase: \"Thus says the LORD\" (for example, [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=IKings+12:22-24;IChronicles+17:3-4;Jeremiah+35:13;Ezekiel+2:4;Zechariah+7:9 1 Kgs 12:22\u201324;1 Chr 17:3\u20134; Jer 35:13; Ezek 2:4; Zech 7:9]; etc.). The [[Second Epistle of Peter]] claims that \"no prophecy of Scripture ... was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit\" ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Peter+1:20-21 2 Pet 1:20\u201321]). The Second Epistle of Peter also implies that Paul's writings are inspired ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Peter+3:16 2 Pet 3:16]).\n\nMany Christians cite a verse in Paul's letter to Timothy, 2 Timothy 3:16\u201317, as evidence that \"all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable ...\" Here St. Paul is referring to the Old Testament, since the scriptures have been known by Timothy from \"infancy\" (verse 15). Others offer an alternative reading for the passage; for example, theologian [[C. H. Dodd]] suggests that it \"is probably to be rendered\" as: \"Every inspired scripture is also useful...\"<ref name=\"dodd p25\">{{cite book | last = Dodd | first = Charles Harold | authorlink = C. H.

For if the Bible were divinely inspired, then the source of inspiration being divine, would not be subject to fallibility or error in that which is produced. For them, the doctrines of the divine inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy, are inseparably tied together. The idea of biblical integrity is a further concept of infallibility, by suggesting that current biblical text is complete and without error, and that the integrity of biblical text has never been corrupted or degraded.<ref name=\"inerrancy\"/> Historians note, or claim, that the doctrine of the Bible's infallibility was adopted hundreds of years after those books were written.\n\n===Biblical canon===\n{{Main|Biblical canon|Christian biblical canons|Development of the Christian biblical canon\n|Development of the New Testament canon}}\n{{See|Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|Development of the Old Testament canon}}\n\nThe content of the [[Protestant Bible|Protestant Old Testament]] is the same as the [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|Hebrew Bible canon]], with changes in the division and order of books, but the [[Catholic Bible|Catholic Old Testament]] contains additional texts, known as the [[deuterocanonical books]]. Protestants recognize 39 books in their Old Testament canon, while Roman Catholic and Eastern Christians recognize 46 books as canonical. Both Catholics and Protestants have the same 27-book New Testament canon.\n\nEarly Christians  used the [[Septuagint]], a [[Koine]] Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures. Christianity subsequently added various writings that would become the New Testament. In the 4th century a series of [[synod]]s, most notably the [[Synod of Hippo]] in AD 393, produced a list of texts equal to the 46 book canon of the Old Testament that Catholics use today (and the 27-book canon of the New Testament that all use). A definitive list did not come from any [[First seven ecumenical councils|early ecumenical council]].<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03274a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Canon of the New Testament]: \"The idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from the beginning, that is from Apostolic times, has no foundation in history.\"</ref> Around 400, [[Jerome]] produced the [[Vulgate]], a definitive Latin edition of the Bible, the contents of which, at the insistence of the Pope, was in accord with the earlier Synods. It can be said that this process effectively set the New Testament canon, although there are examples of other canonical lists in use after this time.\n\nDuring the [[Protestant Reformation]], certain reformers proposed different canonical lists of the Old Testament. The texts that are present in the Septuagint, but not included in the Jewish canon, fell out of favor and, in time, they would come to be removed from Protestant canons. These texts are referred to as deuterocanonical books in Catholic Bibles, whereas in a Protestant context they are referred to as the [[biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]].\n\n==Theology proper: God==\n{{Main|God in Christianity}}\nIn [[Christianity]], God is the [[Creator God|creator and preserver of the universe]]. God is the [[Monotheism|sole]] [[The Ultimate (philosophy)|ultimate]] power in the universe but is distinct from it. The [[Bible]] never speaks of God as impersonal. Instead, it refers to him in [[Personal God|personal terms]]\u2013 who speaks, sees, hears, acts, and loves. God is understood to have a [[will (philosophy)|will]] and personality and is an [[Omnipotent|all powerful]], [[Divinity|divine]] and [[Omnibenevolence|benevolent]] being. He is represented in [[Scripture]] as being primarily concerned with people and their salvation.<ref name=\"Stagg\"/>\n\n===Attributes of God===\n{{Main|Attributes of God in Christianity}}\n\n====Classification====\nMany [[Calvinism|Reformed]] theologians distinguish between the ''communicable'' attributes (those that human beings can also have) and the ''incommunicable'' attributes (those which belong to God alone).<ref>[[Herman Bavinck]], ''The Doctrine of God''. Edinburgh: The Banner of Truth Trust, 1979.</ref>\n\n====Enumeration====\nSome attributes ascribed to God in Christian theology<ref>The [[Westminster Shorter Catechism]]'s definition of God is merely an enumeration of his attributes: \"God is a Spirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable in his being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth.\"[[Westminster Shorter Catechism]], Question and Answer 4. The [[Westminster Larger Catechism]] adds certain attributes to this description, such as \"all-sufficient,\" \"incomprehensible,\" \"every where present\" and \"knowing all things\".

A related concept is the ''[[spirituality]]'' of God, which is derived from [[Jesus]]' statement in [[Gospel of John|John]] 4:24, \"God is spirit.\"\n*[[Love]]\u2014That God is care and compassion. [[1 John]] 4:16 says \"God is love.\"\n*[[Mission (Christianity)|Mission]]\u2014That God is the supreme liberator.

See also [[Monotheism]] and [[Divine simplicity]].\n*[[Divine providence|Providence]]\u2014That God watches over His creation with interest and dedication. While the [[Divine providence|Providence]] of God usually refers to his activity in the world, it also implies his care for the universe, and is thus an attribute. A distinction is usually made between \"general providence\" which refers to God's continuous upholding the existence and natural order of the universe, and \"special providence\" which refers to God's extraordinary intervention in the life of people.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Providence.aspx#1O101-Providence Providence] in ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions''.</ref> See also [[Sovereignty]].\n*[[Righteousness]]\u2014That God is the greatest or only measure of human conduct.

Because the persons of the [[Trinity]] represent a personal relation even on the level of God to Himself, He is personal both in His relation toward us and in His relation toward Himself.\n*[[Veracity (ethics)|Veracity]]\u2014That God is the Truth all human beings strive for; He is also impeccably honest. [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] 1:2 refers to \"God, who does not lie.\"\n*[[Wisdom]]\u2014That God fully comprehends [[human nature]] and the world, and will see His will accomplished in heaven and on earth. [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 16:27 speaks about the \"only wise God\".\n\n====Monotheism====\n[[File:Christ in Gethsemane.jpg|thumb|upright|''Christ in Gethsemane'', [[Heinrich Hofmann (painter)|Heinrich Hofmann]], 1890]]\nSome Christians believe that the God worshiped by the Hebrew people of the pre-Christian era had always revealed himself as he did through [[Jesus]]; but that this was never obvious until Jesus was born (see [[John 1]]). Also, though the [[Angel of the Lord]] spoke to the Patriarchs, revealing God to them, some believe it has always been only through the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit of God]] granting them understanding, that men have been able to perceive later that God himself had visited them.\n\nThis belief gradually developed into the modern formulation of the [[Trinity]], which is the doctrine that God is a single entity ([[Yahweh]]), but that there is a trinity in God's single being, the meaning of which has always been debated. This mysterious \"Trinity\" has been described as [[Hypostasis (religion)|hypostases]] in the [[Greek language]] ([[Consubstantial|subsistences]] in [[Latin]]), and \"persons\" in English. Nonetheless, Christians stress that they only believe in one God.\n\nMost Christian churches teach the Trinity, as opposed to Unitarian monotheistic beliefs. Historically, most Christian churches have taught that the nature of God is a [[Sacred mysteries|mystery]], something that must be revealed by [[special revelation]] rather than deduced through [[general revelation]].\n\nChristian orthodox traditions (Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant) follow this idea, which was codified in 381 and reached its full development through the work of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]]. They consider God to be a [[Wiktionary:triune|triune]] entity, called the Trinity, comprising the three \"Persons\"; [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]], and [[God the Holy Spirit]], described as being \"of the same substance\" ({{lang|grc|[[ousia|\u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2]]}}). The true nature of an infinite God, however, is commonly described as beyond definition, and the word 'person' is an imperfect expression of the idea.\n\nSome critics contend that because of the adoption of a tripartite conception of deity, Christianity is a form of [[tritheism]] or [[polytheism]]. This concept dates from [[Arianism|Arian]] teachings which claimed that Jesus, having appeared later in the Bible than his Father, had to be a secondary, lesser, and therefore distinct god. For [[Jews]] and [[Muslims]], the idea of God as a trinity is [[heresy|heretical]]\u2013 it is considered akin to [[polytheism]]. Christians overwhelmingly assert that monotheism is central to the Christian faith, as the very [[Nicene Creed]] (among others) which gives the orthodox Christian definition of the Trinity does begin with: \"I believe in one God\".\n\nIn the 3rd century, [[Tertullian]] claimed that God exists as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit\u2014the three personae of one and the same substance.<ref name=UCP>''Critical Terms for Religious Studies.'' Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1998. ''Credo Reference.'' 27 July 2009</ref> To trinitarian Christians God the Father is not at all a separate god from God the Son (of whom [[Jesus]] is the incarnation) and the Holy Spirit, the other ''[[Hypostasis (religion)|hypostases]]'' (Persons) of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Christian Godhead]].<ref name=UCP/> According to the Nicene Creed, the Son (Jesus Christ) is \"eternally begotten of the Father\", indicating that their divine Father-Son relationship is not tied to an event within time or human history.\n\nIn [[Christianity]], the [[doctrine]] of the Trinity states that God is one being who exists, simultaneously and [[eternity|eternally]], as a [[perichoresis|mutual indwelling]] of three Persons: the Father, the Son (incarnate as Jesus), and the Holy Spirit (or Holy Ghost). Since earliest Christianity, one's salvation has been very closely related to the concept of a triune God, although the Trinitarian doctrine was not formalized until the 4th century. At that time, the [[Constantine I and Christianity|Emperor Constantine]] convoked the [[First Council of Nicaea]], to which all bishops of the empire were invited to attend. [[Pope Sylvester I]] did not attend but sent his [[Papal legate|legate]]. The council, among other things, decreed the original Nicene Creed.\n\n====Trinity====\n{{Main|Trinity}}\n[[File:Rublevtrinit\u00e4t ubt.gif|upright|thumb|\"Holy Trinity\" from the Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow, by [[Andrei Rublev]], c. 1400, but more properly known as the \"Hospitality of Abraham.\" The three angels [[Christian symbolism|symbolize]] the Trinity.]]\nFor most Christians, beliefs about God are enshrined in the doctrine of [[Trinitarianism]], which holds that the three persons of God together form a single God. The Trinitarian view emphasizes that God has a will and that [[God the Son]] has two wills, divine and human, though these are never in conflict (see [[Hypostatic union]]). However, this point is disputed by Oriental Orthodox Christians, who hold that ''God the Son'' has only one will of unified divinity and humanity (see [[Miaphysitism]]).\n\nThe Christian doctrine of the Trinity teaches the unity of [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]], and [[Holy Spirit]] as three persons in [[monotheism|one Godhead]].<ref name=\"EB-purgatory\">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9061946/purgatory Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: Purgatory in world religions:] \"The idea of purification or temporary punishment after death has ancient roots and is well-attested in early Christian literature.

Eck (2003) Encountering God: A Spiritual Journey from Bozeman to Banaras. p. 98</ref> In Christianity, God is called \"Father\" in a more literal sense, besides being the creator and nurturer of creation, and the provider for his children.{{Bibleref2c|Heb|1:2\u20135}} {{Bibleref2c|Gal|4:1\u20137}} The Father is said to be in unique relationship with his only begotten (''monogenes'') son, [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], which implies an exclusive and intimate familiarity: \"No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\"{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|11:27}}\n\nIn Christianity, God the Father's relationship with humanity is as a father to children\u2014in a previously unheard-of sense\u2014and not just as the creator and nurturer of creation, and the provider for his children, his people. Thus, humans, in general, are sometimes called ''children of God''. To Christians, God the Father's relationship with humanity is that of Creator and created beings, and in that respect he is the father of all. The New Testament says, in this sense, that the very idea of family, wherever it appears, derives its name from God the Father,{{Bibleref2c|Eph|3:15}} and thus God himself is the model of the family.\n\nHowever, there is a deeper \"legal\" sense in which Christians believe that they are made participants in the special relationship of Father and Son, through Jesus Christ as his spiritual [[bride of Christ|bride]]. Christians call themselves ''adopted'' children of God.<ref>\"God sent forth His Son... that we might receive the adoption as sons. And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts crying out, \"Abba, Father!\" Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.''.{{bibleref2c|Galatians|4:4\u20137}}</ref>\n\nIn the New Testament, God the Father has a special role in his relationship with the person of the Son, where Jesus is believed to be his Son and his heir.{{bibleref2c|Heb.|1:2\u20135}}. According to the [[Nicene Creed]], the Son (Jesus Christ) is \"eternally begotten of the Father\", indicating that their divine Father-Son relationship is not tied to an event within time or human history. ''See'' [[Christology]]. The Bible refers to Christ, called \"[[Logos (Christianity)|The Word]]\" as present at the beginning of God's creation.{{bibleref2c|John|1:1}}, not a creation himself, but equal in the personhood of the Trinity.\n\nIn [[Eastern Orthodox]] theology, God the Father is the \"principium\" (''beginning''), the \"source\" or \"origin\" of both the Son and the Holy Spirit, which gives intuitive emphasis to the threeness of persons; by comparison, Western theology explains the \"origin\" of all three ''hypostases'' or persons as being in the divine nature, which gives intuitive emphasis to the [[divine simplicity|oneness]] of God's being.{{Citation needed|reason=I think we need a reliable source for the contrasted \"intuitive emphasises\" in Eastern and Western theology|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Christology and Christ===\n{{Main|Christology|Jesus in Christianity|}}\nChristology is the field of study within Christian theology which is primarily concerned with the nature, person, and works of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]], held by Christians to be the [[Son of God]]. Christology is concerned with the meeting of the human ([[Son of Man]]) and divine ([[God the Son]] or [[Logos (Christianity)|Word of God]]) in the person of [[Jesus]].\n\nPrimary considerations include the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], the relationship of Jesus' nature and person with the nature and person of God, and the [[soteriology|salvific]] work of Jesus. As such, Christology is generally less concerned with the details of Jesus' life (what he did) or teaching than with who or what he is. There have been and are various perspectives by those who claim to be his followers since the church began after his ascension. The controversies ultimately focused on whether and how a [[Theological anthropology|human]] nature and a [[divinity|divine]] nature can co-exist in one person. The study of the inter-relationship of these two natures is one of the preoccupations of the majority tradition.\n\nTeachings about Jesus and testimonies about what he accomplished during his three-year public ministry are found throughout the [[New Testament]]. Core biblical teachings about the person of Jesus Christ may be summarized that Jesus Christ was and forever is fully God (divine) and fully human in one sinless person at the same time,<ref name=\"Grudem\">{{cite book |last=Grudem |first=Wayne A. |title=Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine |publisher=Zondervan |year=1994 |isbn=0-310-28670-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/systematictheolo00grud_0 }}</ref> and that through the death and [[resurrection of Jesus]], [[Christian views on sin|sinful]] humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of [[Heaven#In Christianity|eternal life]] via his [[New Covenant]]. While there have been theological disputes over the nature of Jesus, Christians believe that Jesus is [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]] and \"[[Hypostatic union|true God and true man]]\" (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, having become fully human in all respects, suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, yet he did not sin. As fully God, he defeated death and rose to life again. Scripture asserts that Jesus was conceived, by the Holy Spirit, and [[Nativity of Jesus|born]] of his [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|virgin mother Mary]] without a human father.<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|1:18\u201325}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|1:35}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|3:23}}</ref> The biblical accounts of Jesus' ministry include [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]], [[Ministry of Jesus|preaching, teaching, healing]], [[Death of Christ|Death]], and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. The apostle Peter, in what has become a famous proclamation of faith among Christians since the 1st century, said, \"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\"{{bibleref2c|Matt|16:16}} Most Christians now wait for the [[Second Coming]] of Christ when they believe he will fulfill the remaining [[Messianic prophecy|Messianic prophecies]].\n\n====Christ====\nChrist is the English term for the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}} (''Khrist\u00f3s'') meaning \"[[anointing|the anointed one]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Christ |title=Etymology Online: ''Christ'' |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref> It is a translation of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|\u05de\u05b8\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05d7\u05b7}} (''M\u0101\u0161\u00eea\u1e25''), usually [[transliteration|transliterated]] into English as ''[[Messiah]]''. The word is often misunderstood to be the [[surname]] of [[Jesus]] due to the numerous mentions of ''Jesus Christ'' in the Christian [[Bible]]. The word is in fact used as a [[title]], hence its common reciprocal use ''Christ Jesus'', meaning Jesus the Anointed One or Jesus the Messiah. Followers of Jesus became known as [[Christians]] because they believed that Jesus was the Christ, or Messiah, [[prophecy|prophesied]] about in the [[Old Testament]], or [[Tanakh]].\n\n====Trinitarian Ecumenical Councils====\n{{See also|Ecumenical council}}\nThe Christological controversies came to a head over the persons of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]] and their relationship with one another.\nChristology was a fundamental concern from the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) until the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] (680). In this time period, the Christological views of various groups within the broader Christian community led to accusations of [[Christian heresy|heresy]], and, infrequently, subsequent [[religious persecution]]. In some cases, a sect's unique Christology is its chief distinctive feature, in these cases it is common for the sect to be known by the name given to its Christology.\n\nThe decisions made at [[First Council of Nicaea]] and re-ratified at the [[First Council of Constantinople]], after several decades of ongoing controversy during which the work of Athanasius and the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] were influential. The language used was that the one God exists in three persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit); in particular it was affirmed that the Son was ''[[homoousios]]'' (of one substance) with the Father. The [[Nicene Creed|Creed of the Nicene Council]] made statements about the full divinity and full humanity of Jesus, thus preparing the way for discussion about how exactly the divine and human come together in the person of Christ (Christology).\n\nNicaea insisted that Jesus was fully divine and also human. What it did not do was make clear how one person could be both divine and human, and how the divine and human were related within that one person. This led to the Christological controversies of the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th]] and [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th centuries]] of the Christian era.\n\nThe [[Chalcedonian Creed]] did not put an end to all Christological debate, but it did clarify the terms used and became a point of reference for all other Christologies. Most of the major branches of Christianity\u2014[[Roman Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Lutheranism]], and [[Calvinism|Reformed]]\u2014subscribe to the Chalcedonian Christological formulation, while many branches of Eastern Christianity\u2014[[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian Orthodoxy]], [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian Church]], [[Coptic Orthodoxy]], [[Ethiopian Orthodox]]y, and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolicism]]\u2014reject it.\n\n====Attributes of Christ====\n\n=====God as Son=====\n{{Main|God the Son}}\nAccording to the Bible, the second Person of the Trinity, because of his eternal relation to the first Person (God as Father), is the [[Son of God]]. He is considered (by Trinitarians) to be coequal with the Father and Holy Spirit. He is [[Hypostatic union|all God and all human]]: the Son of God as to his divine nature, while as to his human nature he is from the lineage of David.{{Bibleref2c|Rom|1:3\u20134}}<ref>Compare.{{Bibleref2|Galatians|4:4}};{{Bibleref2|Jn|1:1\u201314}};{{Bibleref2-nb|Jn|5:18\u201325}};{{Bibleref2-nb||Jn|10:30\u201338}}</ref> The core of Jesus' self-interpretation was his \"filial consciousness\", his relationship to God as child to parent in some unique sense<ref name=\"Stagg\">Stagg, Frank. ''New Testament Theology,'' Nashville: Broadman, 1962.</ref> (see [[Filioque]] controversy). His [[Ministry of Jesus|mission on earth]] proved to be that of enabling people to know God as their Father, which Christians believe is the essence of [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].{{Bibleref2c|Jn|17:3}}\n\nGod the Son is the second person of the [[Trinity]] in Christian theology. The [[doctrine]] of the Trinity identifies [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]] as [[God]] the Son, ''united in essence but distinct in person'' with regard to [[God the Father]] and God the [[Holy Spirit]] (the first and third persons of the Trinity). God the Son is co-eternal with God the Father (and the Holy Spirit), both before Creation and after the End (see [[Eschatology]]). So Jesus was always \"God the Son\", though not [[Revelation|revealed]] as such until he also became ''the'' \"Son of God\" through [[incarnation]]. \"Son of God\" draws attention to his humanity, whereas \"God the Son\" refers more generally to his divinity, including his pre-incarnate existence. So, in Christian theology, Jesus was always God the Son,<ref>\"A brief account of the early Church councils and the Church fathers shows that they adopted the doctrine of the eternal subordination of the Son, and that this doctrine continues in the Church as orthodoxy to this day.\" Stephen D. Kovach and Peter R. Schemm Jr., \"A Defense of the Doctrine of the Eternal Subordination of the Son\", ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]'' '''42''' (1999): 461\u2013476.</ref> though not [[Revelation|revealed]] as such until he also became the [[Son of God]] through [[incarnation]].\n\nThe exact phrase \"God the Son\" is not in the New Testament. Later theological use of this expression reflects what came to be standard interpretation of New Testament references, understood to imply Jesus' divinity, but the distinction of his person from that of the one God he called his Father. As such, the title is associated more with the development of the doctrine of the Trinity than with the [[Christology|Christological]] debates. There are over 40 places in the New Testament where Jesus is given the title \"the Son of God\", but scholars don't consider this to be an equivalent expression. \"God the Son\" is rejected by [[anti-trinitarians]], who view this reversal of the most common term for Christ as a doctrinal perversion and as tending towards [[tritheism]].\n\nMatthew cites Jesus as saying, \"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God (5:9).\" The [[gospel]]s go on to document a great deal of controversy over Jesus being ''the'' Son of God, in a unique way. The book of the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and the letters of the New Testament, however, record the early teaching of the first Christians\u2013 those who believed Jesus to be ''both'' the Son of God, the Messiah, a man appointed by God, as well as God himself. This is evident in many places, however, the early part of the book of Hebrews addresses the issue in a deliberate, sustained argument, citing the scriptures of the Hebrew Bible as authorities. For example, the author quotes Psalm 45:6 as addressed by the God of Israel to Jesus.\n*[[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 1:8. About the Son he says, \"Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever.\"\nThe author of Hebrews' description of Jesus as the exact representation of the divine Father has parallels in a passage in [[Epistle to the Colossians|Colossians]].\n*Colossians 2:9\u201310. \"in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form\"\nJohn's gospel quotes Jesus at length regarding his relationship with his heavenly Father. It also contains two famous attributions of divinity to Jesus.\n*[[Gospel of John|John]] 1:1. \"the Word was God\" [in context, the ''Word'' is Jesus, see [[Christ the Logos]]]\n*[[Gospel of John|John]] 20:28. \"Thomas said to him, 'My Lord and my God!'\"\nThe most direct references to Jesus as God are found in various letters.\n*[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 9:5. \"Christ, who is God over all\"\n*[[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] 2:13. \"our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ\"\n*[[Second Epistle of Peter|2 Peter]] 1:1. \"our God and Savior Jesus Christ\"\nThe biblical basis for later trinitarian statements in creeds is the early baptism formula found in Matthew 28.\n*[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 28:19. Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name ''[''note the singular'']'' of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. See also [[Great Commission]].\n\n=====Person of Christ=====\n{{Main|Person of Christ}}\n[[File:Christology Flowchart.PNG|thumb|500px|The various Christological positions, and their names]]\n;Only divine?\n[[Docetism]] (from the Greek verb ''to seem'') taught that Jesus was fully divine, and his human body was only illusory. At a very early stage, various Docetic groups arose; in particular, the [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] sects which flourished in the 2nd century AD tended to have Docetic theologies. Docetic teachings were attacked by [[St. Ignatius of Antioch]] (early 2nd century), and appear to be targeted in the canonical [[Epistles of John]] (dates are disputed, but range from the late 1st century among traditionalist scholars to the late 2nd century among critical scholars).\n\nThe Council of Nicaea rejected theologies that entirely ruled out any humanity in Christ, affirming in the [[Nicene Creed]] the doctrine of the [[Incarnation]] as a part of the doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. That is, that the second person of the Trinity became incarnate in the person [[Jesus]] and was fully human.\n\n;Only human?\n{{See also|Jewish Christianity}}\nThe early centuries of Christian history also had groups at the other end of the spectrum, arguing that Jesus was an ordinary mortal. The [[Adoptionists]] taught that Jesus was born fully human, and was adopted as [[Son of God|God's Son]] when [[John the Baptist]] baptised him<ref>{{Bibleverse||Mark|1:10}}</ref> because of the [[Ministry of Jesus|life he lived]]. Another group, known as the [[Ebionites]], taught that Jesus was not God, but the human [[Moshiach]] (messiah, anointed) prophet promised in the [[Hebrew Bible]].\n\nSome of these views could be described as [[Unitarianism]] (although that is a modern term) in their insistence on the oneness of God. These views, which directly affected how one understood the Godhead, were declared [[heresies]] by the Council of Nicaea. Throughout much of the rest of the ancient history of Christianity, Christologies that denied Christ's divinity ceased to have a major impact on the life of the church.\n\n;How can he be both?\n:;What sort of divinity?\n{{Main|Arianism}}\n\n[[Arianism]] affirmed that Jesus was divine, but taught that he was nevertheless a created being (''there was [a time] when he was not [in existence]''), and was therefore less divine than God the Father. The matter boiled down to one iota; Arianism taught ''[[Homoiousia|Homo'''i'''ousia]]''\u2014the belief that Jesus's divinity is ''similar'' to that of God the Father\u2014as opposed to ''[[Homoousia]]''\u2014the belief that Jesus's divinity is the ''same'' as that of God the Father. [[Arius]]' opponents additionally included in the term ''Arianism'' the belief that Jesus' divinity is ''different'' from that of God the Father (''Heteroousia'').\n\nArianism was condemned by the Council of Nicea, but remained popular in the northern and western provinces of the empire, and continued to be the majority view of western Europe well into the 6th century. Indeed, even the Christian legend of Constantine's death-bed baptism involves a bishop who, in recorded history, was an Arian.\n\nIn the modern era, a number of denominations have rejected the Nicene doctrine of the Trinity, including the [[Christadelphians]] and the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Bruce Milne|title=Know the Truth|publisher=Inter-Varsity Press|pages=181\u2013182|isbn=0-8308-1793-X|date=17 February 1999}}</ref>\n\n;What sort of amalgamation?\nThe Christological debates following the Council of Nicaea sought to make sense of the interplay of the human and divine in the person of Christ while upholding the doctrine of the Trinity. [[Apollinaris of Laodicea]] (310\u2013390) taught that in Jesus, the divine component took the place of the human ''[[nous]]'' (''thinking''\u2013 not to be confused with ''[[thelis]]'', meaning ''intent''). This however was seen as a denial of Jesus' true humanity, and the view was condemned at the [[First Council of Constantinople]].\n\nSubsequently, [[Nestorius]] of Constantinople (386\u2013451) initiated a view that effectively separated Jesus into two persons\u2014one divine and one human; the mechanism of this combination is known as ''hypostas'''e'''s'', and contrasts with ''hypostas'''i'''s''\u2014the view that there is no separation. Nestorius' theology was deemed heretical at the [[First Council of Ephesus]] (431). Though, as seen by the writings of [[Babai the Great]], the Christology of the [[Church of the East]] is highly similar to that of Chalcedon, many orthodox Christians (particularly in the West) consider this group to be the perpetuation of [[Nestorianism]]; the modern Assyrian Church of the East has at times shunned this term, as it implies acceptance of the entire theology of Nestorius.\n\nVarious forms of [[Monophysitism]] taught that Christ only had one nature: that the divine had either dissolved ([[Eutychianism]]), or that the divine joined with the human as one nature in the person of Christ ([[Miaphysitism]]). A notable monophysite theologian was [[Eutyches]] (c. 380\u2013456). [[Monophysitism]] was rejected as [[Christian heresy|heresy]] at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, which affirmed that Jesus Christ had two natures (divine and human) joined in one person, in [[hypostatic union]] (see [[Chalcedonian creed]]). While Eutychianism was suppressed into oblivion by the Chalcedonians and Miaphysites, the Miaphysite groups who dissented from the Chalcedonian formula have persisted as the [[Oriental Orthodox Church]].\n\nAs theologians continued to search for a compromise between the Chalcedonian definition and the [[Monophysites]], other Christologies developed that partially rejected the full humanity of Christ. [[Monothelitism]] taught that in the one person of Jesus there were two natures, but only a divine will. Closely related to this is [[Monoenergism]], which held to the same doctrine as the Monothelites, but with different terminology. These positions were declared [[Christian heresy|heresy]] by the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] (the Sixth [[Ecumenical Council]], 680\u2013681).\n\n=====Incarnation=====\n{{Main|Incarnation (Christianity)}}\nThe Incarnation is the belief in [[Christianity]] that the second person in the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Christian Godhead]], also known as [[God the Son]] or the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] (Word), \"became flesh\" when he was miraculously conceived in the womb of the [[Virgin Mary]]. The word Incarnate derives from [[Latin]] (in=in or into, caro, carnis=flesh) meaning \"to make into flesh\" or \"to become flesh\". The incarnation is a fundamental [[theology|theological]] teaching of [[Nicene Creed|orthodox (Nicene) Christianity]], based on its understanding of the [[New Testament]]. The incarnation represents the belief that Jesus, who is the non-created second [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] of the [[trinity|triune God]], took on a human body and nature and became [[Hypostatic union|both man and God]]. In the [[Bible]] its clearest teaching is in {{Bibleref2|John|1:14}}: \"And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us.\"<ref>McKim, Donald K. 1996. ''Westminster dictionary of theological terms''.

Alternative views on the subject (See [[Ebionites]] and the [[Gospel of the Hebrews|Gospel according to the Hebrews]]) have been proposed throughout the centuries (see below), but all were rejected by [[Mainstream Christianity|mainstream Christian bodies]].\n\nIn recent decades, an alternative doctrine known as \"[[Oneness Pentecostalism (doctrine)|Oneness]]\" has been espoused among various [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] groups (see below), but has been rejected by the remainder of [[Christendom]].\n\n;Description and development of the traditional doctrine\nIn the [[Early Christianity|early Christian era]], there was considerable disagreement amongst Christians regarding the nature of Christ's Incarnation. While all Christians believed that Jesus was indeed the [[Son of God]], the exact nature of his Sonship was contested, together with the precise relationship of the \"[[God the Father|Father]],\" \"Son\" and \"[[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]]\" referred to in the New Testament. Though Jesus was clearly the \"Son,\" what exactly did this mean? Debate on this subject raged most especially during the first four centuries of Christianity, involving [[Jewish Christians]], [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]], followers of the Presbyter [[Arius]] of Alexandra, and adherents of [[Athanasius of Alexandria|St. Athanasius the Great]], among others.\n\nEventually, the Christian Church accepted the teaching of St. Athanasius and his allies, that Christ was the incarnation of the eternal second person of the [[Trinity]], who was fully God and fully a man simultaneously. All divergent beliefs were defined as [[heresy|heresies]]. This included [[Docetism]], which said that Jesus was a divine being that took on human appearance but not flesh; [[Arianism]], which held that Christ was a created being; and [[Nestorianism]], which maintained that the Son of God and the man, Jesus, shared the same body but retained [[Two Natures of Christ|two separate natures]]. The [[Oneness Pentecostalism|Oneness]] belief held by certain modern [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] churches is also seen as heretical by most mainstream Christian bodies.\n\nThe most widely accepted the early Christian Church made definitions of the Incarnation and the nature of Jesus at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431, and the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451. These councils declared that Jesus was both fully God: begotten from, but not created by the Father; and fully man: taking his flesh and human nature from the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]. These two natures, human and divine, were [[hypostatic union|hypostatically]] united into the one personhood of Jesus Christ.<ref>* [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.toc.html The Seven Ecumenical Councils], from the ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', vols. 2\u201314 (CCEL.org) Contains detailed statements from each of these councils. The First Council of Nicaea, Council of Ephesus and Council of Chalcedon are the \"First,\" \"Third\" and \"Fourth\" Ecumenical Councils, respectively.</ref>\n\n;Fortuitous and Necessary Incarnation\nThe link between the Incarnation and the [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]] within systematic theological thought is complex. Within traditional models of the Atonement, such as [[Penal substitution|Substitution]], [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|Satisfaction]] or [[Christus Victor]], Christ must be Divine in order for the Sacrifice of the Cross to be efficacious, for human sins to be \"removed\" or \"conquered\". In his work ''The Trinity and the Kingdom of God'', [[J\u00fcrgen Moltmann|Jurgen Moltmann]] differentiated between what he called a \"fortuitous\" and a \"necessary\" Incarnation. The latter gives a soteriological emphasis to the Incarnation: the Son of God became a man so that he could save us from our sins. The former, on the other hand, speaks of the Incarnation as a fulfilment of the [[Love of God]], of his desire to be present and living amidst humanity, to \"walk in the garden\" with us.\n\nMoltmann favours \"fortuitous\" incarnation primarily because he feels that to speak of an incarnation of \"necessity\" is to do an injustice to the [[Ministry of Jesus|life of Christ]]. Moltmann's work, alongside other systematic theologians, opens up avenues of liberation [[Christology]].\n\n=====Hypostatic union=====\n{{Main|Hypostatic union|Chalcedonian}}\n[[File:Vladimirskaya.jpg|thumb|upright|A depiction of Jesus and Mary, the [[Theotokos]] [[Theotokos of Vladimir|of Vladimir]] (12th century)]]\nIn short, this doctrine states that two natures, one human and one divine, are united in the one person of Christ. The Council further taught that each of these natures, the human and the divine, was distinct and complete. This view is sometimes called [[Dyophysite]] (meaning two natures) by those who rejected it.\n\nHypostatic union (from the Greek for substance) is a technical term in Christian theology employed in mainstream [[Christology]] to describe the union of two natures, humanity and divinity, in Jesus Christ. A brief definition of the doctrine of two natures can be given as: \"Jesus Christ, who is identical with the Son, is one person and one hypostasis in two natures: a human and a divine.\"<ref>Martin Lembke, lecture in the course \"Meetings with the World's Religions\", Centre for Theology and Religious Studies, Lund University, Spring Term 2010.</ref>\n\nThe [[First Council of Ephesus]] recognised this doctrine and affirmed its importance, stating that the humanity and divinity of Christ are made one according to nature and hypostasis in the [[Logos]].\n\nThe [[First Council of Nicaea]] declared that the Father and the Son are of the same substance and are co-eternal. This belief was expressed in the Nicene Creed.\n\n[[Apollinaris of Laodicea]] was the first to use the term hypostasis in trying to understand the [[Incarnation]].<ref>Gregory of Nyssa, ''Antirrheticus adversus Apollinarem.''</ref> Apollinaris described the union of the divine and human in Christ as being of a single nature and having a single essence\u2013 a single hypostasis.\n\nThe [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] went in the other direction, arguing that in Christ there were two natures ([[dyophysite]]) (human and divine) and two hypostases (in the sense of \"essence\" or \"person\") that co-existed.<ref>\"Theodore\" in ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian History'', ed. J. Brauer. Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1971.</ref>\n\nThe [[Chalcedonian Creed]] agreed with Theodore that there were two natures in the [[Incarnation]]. However, the [[Council of Chalcedon]] also insisted that hypostasis be used as it was in the Trinitarian definition: to indicate the person and not the nature as with Apollinarius.\n\nThus, the Council declared that in Christ there are two natures; each retaining its own properties, and together united in one subsistence and in one single person.<ref>[[Denzinger]], ed. Bannwart, 148</ref>\n\nAs the precise nature of this union is held to defy finite human comprehension, the hypostatic union is also referred to by the alternative term \"mystical union.\"\n\nThe [[Oriental Orthodox Church]]es, having rejected the Chalcedonian Creed, were known as [[Monophysites]] because they would only accept a definition that characterized the incarnate Son as having one nature. The [[Chalcedonian]] \"in two natures\" formula was seen as derived from and akin to a [[Nestorian doctrine|Nestorian]] Christology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishorthodox.org/113e.php |title=The Oriental Orthodox Rejection of Chalcedon |accessdate=5 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619122112/http://www.britishorthodox.org/113e.php |archivedate=19 June 2008 }}</ref> Contrariwise, the Chalcedonians saw the Oriental Orthodox as tending towards [[Eutychianism|Eutychian]] Monophysitism. However, the Oriental Orthodox have in modern ecumenical dialogue specified that they have never believed in the doctrines of Eutyches, that they have always affirmed that Christ's humanity is consubstantial with our own, and they thus prefer the term \"Miaphysite\" to refer to themselves (a reference to Cyrillian Christology, which used the phrase \"mia physis tou theou logou sesarkomene\").\n\nIn recent times, leaders from the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches have signed joint statements in an attempt to work towards reunification.\n\n=====Other Christological concerns=====\n;The sinlessness of Christ\n{{main|Impeccability}}\nAlthough Christian orthodoxy holds that Jesus was fully human, the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], for example, states that Christ was 'holy and without evil' (7:26). The question concerning the sinlessness of Jesus Christ focuses on this seeming paradox. Does being fully human require that one participate in [[Fall of man|the \"fall\" of Adam]], or could Jesus exist in an \"unfallen\" status as [[Adam and Eve]] did before the \"fall,\" according to Genesis 2\u20133?\n\n;Kinds of sinlessness\nEvangelical writer [[Donald Macleod (theologian)|Donald Macleod]] suggests that the sinless nature of Jesus Christ involves two elements. \"First, Christ was free of actual sin.\"<ref name=\"macleod220\">[[Donald Macleod (theologian)|Donald Macleod]], ''The Person of Christ'' ([[InterVarsity Press]], 1998), 220.</ref> Studying the gospels there is no reference to Jesus praying for the forgiveness of sin, nor confessing sin. The assertion is that Jesus did not commit sin, nor could he be proven guilty of sin; he had no vices. In fact, he is quoted as asking, \"Can any of you prove me guilty of sin?\" in John 8:46. \"Secondly, he was free from inherent sin (\"[[original sin]]\" or \"[[ancestral sin]]\").\"<ref name=\"macleod220\" />\n\n;Temptation of Christ\n'''The temptation of Christ''' shown in the gospels affirms that he was tempted. Indeed, the temptations were genuine and of a greater intensity than normally experienced by human beings.<ref>NRSV; Matthew 4.1\u201311.</ref> He experienced all the frail weaknesses of humanity. Jesus was tempted through hunger and thirst, pain and the love of his friends. Thus, the human weaknesses could engender temptation.<ref name=\"macleod226\">Macleod 1998, p. 226</ref> Nevertheless, MacLeod notes that \"one crucial respect in which Christ was not like us is that he was not tempted by anything within himself.\"<ref name=\"macleod226\" />\n\nThe temptations Christ faced focused upon his person and identity as the incarnate Son of God. MacLeod writes, \"Christ could be tempted through his sonship.\" The temptation in the wilderness and again in Gethsemane exemplifies this '''arena of temptation'''. Regarding the temptation of performing a sign that would affirm his sonship by throwing himself from the pinnacle of the temple, MacLeod observes, \"The sign was for himself: a temptation to seek reassurance, as if to say, \u2018the real question is my own sonship. I must forget all else and all others and all further service until that is clear.\u2019\"<ref name=\"macleod227\">Macleod 1998, p. 227</ref> MacLeod places this struggle in the context of the incarnation, \"...he has become a man and must accept not only the appearance but the reality.\"<ref name=\"macleod227\" />\n\n;Communication of attributes\nThe communion of attributes (''[[Communicatio idiomatum]]'') of Christ's divine and human natures is understood according to Chalcedonian theology to mean that they exist together with neither overriding the other. That is, both are preserved and coexist in one person. Christ had '''all''' the properties of God and humanity. God did not stop being God and become man. Christ was not half-God and half-human. The two natures did not mix into a new third kind of nature. Although independent, they acted in complete accord; when one nature acted, so did the other. The natures did not commingle, merge, infuse each other, or replace each other. One was not converted into the other. They remained distinct (yet acted with one accord).\n\n;Virgin Birth\n{{Main|Virgin Birth of Jesus}}\n\n[[File:Holy Doors.jpg|thumb|upright|Holy Doors from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], Mount Sinai, depicting the [[Annunciation]], c. 12th century]]\nThe Gospel according to Matthew and Gospel according to Luke suggest a virgin birth of Jesus Christ. Some now disregard or even argue against this \"doctrine\" to which most [[Christian denomination|denominations]] of Christianity ascribe. This section looks at the Christological issues surrounding belief or disbelief in the virgin birth.\n\nA non-virgin birth would seem to require some form of [[adoptionism]]. This is because a human conception and birth would seem to yield a fully human Jesus, with some other mechanism required to make Jesus divine as well.\n\nA non-virgin birth would seem to support the full humanity of Jesus. William Barclay: states, \"The supreme problem of the virgin birth is that it does quite undeniably differentiate Jesus from all men; it does leave us with an incomplete incarnation.\"<ref>Barclay 1967, p. 81</ref>\n\nBarth speaks of the virgin birth as the divine sign \"which accompanies and indicates the mystery of the incarnation of the Son.\"<ref>Barth 1956, p. 207</ref>\n\nDonald MacLeod<ref>MacLeod 1998, pp. 37\u201341</ref> gives several Christological implications of a virgin birth:\n* Highlights salvation as a [[supernatural]] act of God rather than an act of human initiative.\n* Avoids [[adoptionism]] (which is virtually required if a normal birth).\n* Reinforces the sinlessness of Christ, especially as it relates to Christ being outside the sin of Adam ([[original sin]]).\n\n;Relationship of Persons\nThe discussion of whether the three distinct persons in the Godhead of the Trinity were of greater, equal, or lesser by comparison was also, like many other areas of early Christology, a subject of debate. In [[Athenagoras of Athens]] (c. 133\u2013190) writings we find a very developed trinitarian doctrine.<ref name=Kesich2007>{{Cite book| last = Kesich | first = Veselin| year = 2007| title = Formation and struggles : the church, A.D. 33\u2013450| page = 159| url = https://books.google.com/?id=vc0wBCU70NwC&pg=RA1-PA154&dq=Justin+Martyr+christology| isbn = 978-0-88141-319-9| publisher = St. Vladimir's Seminary Press| location = Crestwood, N.Y.| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/athenagoras-plea.html |title=Athenagoras of Athens: A Plea for the Christians |publisher=Earlychristianwritings.com |date=2 February 2006 |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref> On the one end of the spectrum was [[modalism]], a doctrine stating that the three persons of the Trinity were equal to the point of erasing their differences and distinctions. On the other end of the spectrum were [[tritheism]] as well as some radically [[subordinationist]] views, the latter of which emphasized the primacy of the Father of Creation to the deity of Christ and Jesus's authority over the Holy Spirit. During the Council of Nicea, the modalist bishops of Rome and Alexandria aligned politically with Athanasius; whereas the bishops of Constantinople (Nicomedia), Antioch, and Jerusalem sided with the subordinationists as middle ground between Arius and Athanasius.\n\n====Approaches to Christology====\nTheologians like [[Jurgen Moltmann]] and Walter Kasper have characterized Christologies as anthropological or cosmological. These are also termed 'Christology from below' and 'Christology from above' respectively. An anthropological Christology starts with the human person of Jesus and works from his life and ministry toward what it means for him to be divine; whereas, a cosmological Christology works in the opposite direction. Starting from the eternal Logos, a cosmological Christology works toward his humanity. Theologians typically begin on one side or the other and their choice inevitably colors their resultant Christology. As a starting point these options represent \"diverse yet complementary\" approaches; each poses its own difficulties. Both Christologies 'from above' and 'from below' must come to terms with the two natures of Christ: human and divine. Just as light can be perceived as a wave or as a particle, so Jesus must be thought in terms of both his divinity and humanity. You cannot talk about \"either or\" but must talk about \"both and\".<ref name=\"Greene\">{{Cite book |first = Colin J. D. |last = Greene |authorlink = |title = Christology in Cultural Perspective: Marking Out the Horizons |publisher = Paternoster Press |year = 2003 |location = London |pages =30 |url = |doi = |id = |isbn = 978-1842270158 }}</ref>\n\n;Cosmological approaches\nChristologies from above start with the Logos, the second Person of the Trinity, establish his eternality, his agency in creation, and his economic Sonship. Jesus' unity with God is established by the Incarnation as the divine Logos assumes a human nature. This approach was common in the early church\u2014e.g., St. Paul and St. John in the Gospels. The attribution of full humanity to Jesus is resolved by stating that the two natures mutually share their properties (a concept termed ''[[communicatio idiomatum]]'').<ref>[[#Greene|Greene]], pp. 31\u201343, 324</ref>\n\n;Anthropological approaches\nChristologies from below start with the human being Jesus as the representative of the new humanity, not with the pre-existent Logos. Jesus lives an exemplary life, one to which we aspire in religious experience. This form of Christology lends itself to mysticism, and some of its roots go back to emergence of Christ mysticism in the 6th century East, but in the West it flourished between the 11th and 14th centuries. A recent theologian Wolfhart Pannenberg contends that the resurrected Jesus is the \"eschatological fulfillment of human destiny to live in nearness to God.\"<ref>[[#Greene|Greene]], pp. 43\u201351</ref>\n\n;Political approaches\nThe Christian faith is inherently political because allegiance to Jesus as risen Lord relativises all earthly rule and authority. Jesus is called \"Lord\" over 230 times in Paul's epistles alone, and is thus the principal confession of faith in the Pauline epistles. Further, N.T. Wright argues that this Pauline confession is the core of the gospel of salvation. The Achilles' heel of this approach is the loss of eschatological tension between this present age and the future divine rule that is yet to come. This can happen when the state co-opts Christ's authority as was often the case in imperial Christology. Modern political Christologies seek to overcome imperialist ideologies.<ref>[[#Greene|Greene]], pp. 51\u201371, 325</ref>\n\n====Works of Christ====\n;Resurrection of Jesus\n{{Main|Crucifixion of Jesus|Resurrection of Jesus}}\n[[File:TheResurrectionOfChrist.jpg|thumb|upright|The Resurrection of Christ by [[Carl Heinrich Bloch]], 1875.]]\nThe resurrection is perhaps the most controversial aspect of the life of Jesus Christ. Christianity hinges on this point of Christology, both as a response to a particular history and as a confessional response.<ref>[[Reginald H. Fuller#The Foundations of New Testament Christology|Fuller 1965, p. 15]]</ref> Some Christians claim that because he was resurrected, the future of the world was forever altered. Most Christians believe that Jesus\u2019 resurrection brings reconciliation with God (II Corinthians 5:18), the destruction of death (I Corinthians 15:26), and forgiveness of sins for followers of Jesus Christ.\n\nAfter Jesus had died, and was buried, the [[New Testament]] states that he appeared to others in bodily form. Some skeptics say his appearances were only perceived by his followers in mind or spirit. The gospels state that the disciples believed they witnessed Jesus\u2019 resurrected body and that led to the beginning of the faith. They had previously hid in fear of persecution after Jesus\u2019 death. After seeing Jesus they boldly proclaimed the message of Jesus Christ despite tremendous risk. They obeyed Jesus\u2019 mandate to be reconciled to God through repentance (Luke 24:47), baptism, and obedience (Matthew 28:19\u201320).\n\n;Offices as Prophet, Priest, and King\nJesus Christ, the Mediator of humankind, fulfills the [[Threefold Office|three offices of Prophet, Priest, and King]]. [[Eusebius]] of the early church worked out this threefold classification, which during the Reformation played a substantial role in [[scholastic Lutheran Christology]] and in [[John Calvin]]'s<ref>John Calvin, Calvins Calvinism BOOK II Chapter 15 Centers for Reformed Theology and Apologetics [resource online] (1996\u20132002, accessed 3 June 2006);available from http://www.reformed.org/books/institutes/books/book2/bk2ch15.html#one.htm</ref> and [[John Wesley]]'s Christology.<ref>H.

''Pneuma'' ([[wikt:\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1|\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1]]) is [[Greek language|Greek]] for \"[[breath]]\", which metaphorically describes a non-material being or influence. In Christian theology pneumatology refers to the study of the [[Holy Spirit]]. In [[Christianity]], the Holy Spirit (or Holy Ghost) is the [[Spirit]] of [[God in Christianity|God]]. Within mainstream (Trinitarian) Christian beliefs he is the third person of the [[Trinity]]. As part of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]], the Holy Spirit is equal with [[God the Father]] and with [[God the Son]]. The Christian theology of the Holy Spirit was the last piece of Trinitarian theology to be fully developed.\n\nWithin mainstream (Trinitarian) Christianity the Holy Spirit is one of the three ''persons'' of the [[Trinity]] who make up the single [[Ousia|substance]] of God. As such the Holy Spirit is personal, and as part of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]], he is fully God, co-equal and co-eternal with [[God the Father]] and [[Son of God]].<ref name=Erickson103>{{Cite book| author = Millard J.

Pneumatology would normally include study of the person of the Holy Spirit, and the works of the Holy Spirit. This latter category would normally include Christian teachings on [[Regeneration (theology)|new birth]], [[spiritual gift]]s (charismata), [[Baptism with the Holy Spirit|Spirit-baptism]], [[sanctification]], the [[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]] of [[prophet]]s, and the indwelling of the Holy Trinity (which in itself covers many different aspects). Different [[Christian denomination]]s have different theological approaches.\n\nChristians believe that the Holy Spirit leads people to faith in Jesus and gives them the ability to live a [[Christianity#Worship and practices|Christian lifestyle]]. The Holy Spirit dwells inside every Christian, each one's body being his temple.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|3:16||1 Cor 3:16}} Jesus described the Holy Spirit{{bibleref2c|Jn|14:26}} as ''[[Paraclete|paracletus]]'' in [[Latin]], derived from [[Greek language|Greek]].

The Holy Spirit's action in one's life is believed to produce positive results, known as the [[Fruit of the Holy Spirit]]. The Holy Spirit enables Christians, who still experience the effects of sin, to do things they never could do on their own. These spiritual gifts are not innate abilities \"unlocked\" by the Holy Spirit, but entirely new abilities, such as the ability to cast out [[demon]]s or simply bold speech. Through the influence of the Holy Spirit a person sees more clearly the world around him or her and can use his or her mind and body in ways that exceed his or her previous capacity. A list of gifts that may be bestowed include the [[charism]]atic gifts of [[prophecy]], [[glossolalia|tongues]], healing, and knowledge. Christians holding a view known as [[cessationism]] believe these gifts were given only in New Testament times. Christians almost universally agree that certain \"[[spiritual gift]]s\" are still in effect today, including the gifts of ministry, teaching, giving, leadership, and mercy.{{Bibleref2c|Rom|12:6\u20138|}} The experience of the Holy Spirit is sometimes referred to as being [[anointing|anointed]].\n\nAfter his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], Christ told his disciples that they would be \"[[baptism|baptized]] with the Holy Spirit\" and would receive power from this event,{{bibleref2c|Ac|1:4\u20138}} a promise that was fulfilled in the events recounted in the second chapter of Acts. On the first [[Pentecost]], Jesus' disciples were gathered in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] when a mighty wind was heard and tongues of fire appeared over their heads. A multilingual crowd heard the disciples speaking, and each of them heard them speaking in his or her native [[language]].\n\nThe Holy Spirit is believed to perform specific divine functions in the life of the Christian or the church. These include:\n*'''Conviction of [[sin]]'''. The Holy Spirit acts to convince the unredeemed person both of the sinfulness of their actions, and of their moral standing as sinners before God.<ref>''The Holy Spirit and His Gifts''. [[J.

These gifts consist of specific abilities granted to the individual Christian.<ref name=Erickson265/> They are frequently known by the Greek word for gift, ''Charisma'', from which the term [[charismatic]] derives. The New Testament provides three different lists of such gifts which range from the supernatural (healing, prophecy, [[glossolalia|tongues]]) through those associated with specific callings (teaching) to those expected of all Christians in some degree (faith). Most consider these lists not to be exhaustive, and other have compiled their own lists. Saint [[Ambrose]] wrote of the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit poured out on a believer at baptism: 1. Spirit of Wisdom; 2. Spirit of Understanding; 3. Spirit of Counsel; 4. Spirit of Strength; 5. Spirit of Knowledge; 6. Spirit of Godliness; 7. Spirit of [[Fear of God (religion)|Holy Fear]].<ref>De Sacramentis 3.8.</ref>\n\nIt is over the nature and occurrence of these gifts, particularly the supernatural gifts (sometimes called charismatic gifts), that the greatest disagreement between Christians with regard to the Holy Spirit exists.\n\nOne view is that the supernatural gifts were a special dispensation for the apostolic ages, bestowed because of the unique conditions of the church at that time, and are extremely rarely bestowed in the present time.<ref name=EricksonWorks>{{Cite book| author = Millard J.

The alternate view, espoused mainly by Pentecostal denominations and the charismatic movement, is that the absence of the supernatural gifts was due to the neglect of the Holy Spirit and his work by the church. Although some small groups, such as the ''[[Montanists]]'', practiced the supernatural gifts they were rare until the growth of the [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] movement in the late 19th century.<ref name=EricksonWorks/>\n\nBelievers in the relevance of the supernatural gifts sometimes speak of a ''Baptism of the Holy Spirit'' or ''Filling of the Holy Spirit'' which the Christian needs to experience in order to receive those gifts. Many churches hold that the ''Baptism of the Holy Spirit'' is identical with conversion, and that all Christians are by definition baptized in the Holy Spirit.<ref name=EricksonWorks/>\n\n==Cosmology: Things created==\n{{Main|Christian cosmology}}\n{{rquote|right| And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.

The [[cosmos]] was created by God by divine command, in the best-known and most complete account in the Bible, that of Genesis 1.\n\n===World===\n{{See also|Creator deity|Creationism}}\nWithin this broad understanding, however, there are a number of views regarding exactly how this doctrine ought to be interpreted.\n* Some Christians, particularly [[Young Earth creationism|Young]] and [[Old Earth creationism|Old Earth creationists]], interpret Genesis as an accurate and literal account of creation.\n* Others may understand these to be, instead, spiritual insights more vaguely defined.\n\nIt is a tenet of Christian faith (Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant) that God is the creator of all things [[ex nihilo|from nothing]], and has made human beings in the [[Image of God]], who by direct inference is also the source of the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]. In [[Chalcedonian]] [[Christology]], [[Jesus the Logos|Jesus is the Word of God]], which was in the beginning and, thus, is uncreated, and hence [[God the Son|is God]], and consequently identical with the Creator of the world ''[[ex nihilo]]''.\n\n[[Roman Catholicism]] uses the phrase special creation to refer to the doctrine of immediate or special creation of each human soul. In 2004, the International Theological Commission, then under the presidency of Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]], published a paper in which it accepts the current scientific accounts of the history of the universe commencing in the Big Bang about 15 billion years ago and of the evolution of all life on earth including humans from the micro organisms commencing about 4 billion years ago.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20040723_communion-stewardship_en.html Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621050711/https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20040723_communion-stewardship_en.html |date=21 June 2014 }},(23 July 2004), International Theological Commission, La Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica 2004, IV, 254\u2013286</ref> The [[Roman Catholic Church]] allows for both a [[literal interpretation|literal]] and [[Allegorical interpretation of the Bible|allegorical interpretation]] of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], so as to allow for the possibility of Creation by means of an [[Evolution|evolutionary process]] over great spans of time, otherwise known as [[theistic evolution]].{{Dubious|date=September 2010}} It believes that the creation of the world is a work of God through the ''[[Logos]]'', the Word (idea, intelligence, reason and logic):\n:\"In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God...all things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made.\"\n\nThe New Testament claims that God created everything by the eternal Word, Jesus Christ his beloved Son.

This [[theological anthropology]] refers to the study of the human (\"anthropology\") as it relates to [[God]]. It differs from the [[social science]] of [[anthropology]], which primarily deals with the comparative study of the physical and social characteristics of humanity across times and places.\n\nOne aspect studies the innate nature or constitution of the human, known as the ''nature of mankind''. It is concerned with the relationship between notions such as [[Human body|body]], [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and [[spirit]] which together form a person, based on their descriptions in the [[Bible]]. There are three traditional views of the human constitution\u2013 [[trichotomism]], [[dichotomism]] and [[monism]] (in the sense of anthropology).<ref>[[Millard Erickson]], ''Christian Theology'' 2nd edn, 537</ref>\n\n====Components====\n;Soul\n{{See also|soul|nephesh|psyche (psychology)|Spirit|Human body|Flesh}}\nThe semantic domain of [[Bible|Biblical]] soul is based on the [[Hebrew]] word ''[[nephesh|nepes]]'', which presumably means \"breath\" or \"breathing being\".<ref>''Hebrew\u2013English Lexicon,'' Brown, Driver & Briggs, Hendrickson Publishers.</ref> This word never means an immortal soul<ref>''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology.''</ref> or an incorporeal part of the human being<ref>''Dictionary of Biblical Theology,'' Father Xavier Leon Dufour, 1985.</ref> that can survive death of the body as the spirit of dead.<ref>''New International Dictionary''.</ref> This word usually designates the person as a whole<ref>New Dictionary of Biblical Theology</ref> or its physical life. In the [[Septuagint]] ''nepes'' is mostly translated as ''psyche'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae|\u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae]]}}) and, exceptionally, in the [[Book of Joshua]] as ''empneon'' (\u1f14\u03bc\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd), that is \"breathing being\".<ref>\"A careful examination of the biblical material, particularly the words nefesh, neshama, and rua\u1e25, which are often too broadly translated as \"soul\" and \"spirit,\" indicates that these must not be understood as referring to the psychical side of a psychophysical pair. A man did not possess a nefesh but rather was a nefesh, as Gen. 2:7 says: \"wayehi ha-adam le-nefesh \u1e25ayya\" (\". . . and the man became a living being\"). Man was, for most of the biblical writers, what has been called \"a unit of vital power,\" not a dual creature separable into two distinct parts of unequal importance and value. While this understanding of the nature of man dominated biblical thought, in apocalyptic literature (2nd century BC\u20132nd century AD) the term nefesh began to be viewed as a separable psychical entity with existence apart from body.... The biblical view of man as an inseparable psychosomatic unit meant that death was understood to be his dissolution.\"\u2014Britannica, 2004.</ref>\n\nThe [[New Testament]] follows the terminology of the [[Septuagint]], and thus uses the word ''psyche'' with the Hebrew semantic domain and not the Greek,<ref>''Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament''</ref> that is an invisible power (or ever more, for [[Plato]]nists, immortal and immaterial) that gives life and motion to the body and is responsible for its attributes.\n\nIn [[Patristic]] thought, towards the end of the 2nd century ''psyche'' was understood in more a Greek than a Hebrew way, and it was contrasted with the body. In the 3rd century, with the influence of [[Origen]], there was the establishing of the doctrine of the inherent immortality of the soul and its divine nature.<ref>The early Hebrews apparently had a concept of the soul but did not separate it from the body, although later Jewish writers developed the idea of the soul further. Old Testament references to the soul are related to the concept of breath and establish no distinction between the ethereal soul and the corporeal body. Christian concepts of a body-soul dichotomy originated with the ancient Greeks andwere introduced into Christian theology at an early date by St. Gregory of Nyssa and by St. Augustine.\u2014''Britannica,'' 2004</ref> Origen also taught the [[Reincarnation|transmigration]] of the souls and their preexistence, but these views were officially rejected in 553 in the [[Fifth Ecumenical Council]]. Inherent immortality of the soul was accepted among western and eastern theologians throughout the [[middle ages]], and after the Reformation, as evidenced by the [[Westminster Confession]].\n\n;Spirit\nThe spirit (Hebrew ''ruach'', Greek {{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1|\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1]]}}, ''pneuma'', which can also mean \"breath\") is likewise an immaterial component. It is often used interchangeably with \"soul\", ''psyche'', although trichotomists believe that the spirit is distinct from the soul.\n\n:\"When Paul speaks of the ''pneuma'' of man he does not mean some higher principle within him or some special intellectual or spiritual faculty of his, but simply his self, and the only questions is whether the self is regarded in some particular aspect when it is called ''pneuma''. In the first place, it apparently is regarded in the same way as when it is called ''psyche''\u2013 viz. as the self that lives in man's attitude, in the orientation of his will.\"<ref>Bultmann, I:206</ref>\n\n;Body, Flesh\nThe body (Greek {{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c3\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1|\u03c3\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1]]}} ''soma'') is the corporeal or physical aspect of a human being. Christians have traditionally believed that the body will be [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrected]] at the end of the age.\n\nFlesh (Greek {{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03be|\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03be]]}}, ''sarx'') is usually considered synonymous with \"body\", referring to the corporeal aspect of a human being. The [[apostle Paul]] contrasts flesh and spirit in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 7\u20138.\n\n====Origin of humanity====\n{{See also|Creationism|Theistic evolution|Image of God}}\nThe [[Bible]] teaches in the book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] the humans were created by God. Some Christians believe that this must have involved a miraculous creative act, while others are comfortable with the idea that God worked through the [[evolution]]ary process.\n\nThe book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] also teaches that human beings, male and female, were created in the image of God. The exact meaning of this has been debated throughout church history.\n\n====Death and afterlife====\n{{See also|Afterlife }}\nChristian anthropology has implications for beliefs about [[death]] and the [[afterlife]]. The Christian church has traditionally taught that the soul of each individual separates from the body at death, to be reunited at the [[resurrection of the dead|resurrection]]. This is closely related to the doctrine of the [[immortality of the soul]]. For example, the [[Westminster Confession]] (chapter XXXII) states:\n:\"The bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see corruption: but their souls, which neither die nor sleep, having an immortal subsistence, immediately return to God who gave them\"\n\n;Intermediate state\n{{Main|Intermediate state}}\nThe question then arises: where exactly does the disembodied soul \"go\" at death? Theologians refer to this subject as the [[intermediate state]]. The [[Old Testament]] speaks of a place called ''[[sheol]]'' where the spirits of the dead reside. In the [[New Testament]], ''[[hades]]'', the classical Greek realm of the dead, takes the place of ''sheol''. In particular, Jesus teaches in Luke 16:19\u201331 ([[Lazarus and Dives]]) that ''hades'' consists of two separate \"sections\", one for the righteous and one for the unrighteous. His teaching is consistent with [[Intertestamental period|intertestamental]] Jewish thought on the subject.<ref>D. K. Innes, \"Sheol\" in ''New Bible Dictionary'', IVP 1996.</ref>\n\nFully developed Christian theology goes a step further; on the basis of such texts as Luke 23:43 and Philippians 1:23, it has traditionally been taught that the souls of the dead are received immediately either into heaven or hell, where they will experience a foretaste of their eternal destiny prior to the resurrection. ([[Roman Catholicism]] teaches a third possible location, [[Purgatory]], though this is denied by [[Protestants]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]].)\n:\"the souls of the righteous, being then made perfect in holiness, are received into the highest heavens, where they behold the face of God, in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption of their bodies. And the souls of the wicked are cast into hell, where they remain in torments and utter darkness, reserved to the judgment of the great day.\" (''Westminster Confession'')\n\nSome Christian groups which stress a monistic anthropology deny that the soul can exist consciously apart from the body. For example, the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] teaches that the intermediate state is an [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] sleep; this teaching is informally known as \"[[soul sleep]]\".\n\n;Final state\nIn Christian belief, both the righteous and the unrighteous will be resurrected at the [[last judgment]]. The righteous will receive incorruptible, immortal bodies (1 Corinthians 15), while the unrighteous will be sent to [[hell]]. Traditionally, Christians have believed that hell will be a place of eternal physical and psychological punishment. In the last two centuries, [[annihilationism]] has become popular.\n\n===Mariology===\n{{Main|Mariology}}\nThe study of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], doctrines about her, and how she relates to the Church, Christ, and the individual Christian is called Mariology. Examples of Mariology include the study of and doctrines regarding her [[perpetual virginity of Mary|Perpetual Virginity]], her [[Theotokos|Motherhood of God]] (and by extension her [[Mother of the Church|Motherhood/Intercession for all Christians]]), her [[Immaculate Conception]], and her [[assumption of Mary|Assumption into heaven]]. [[Catholic Mariology]] is the Marian study specifically in the context of the [[Catholic Church]].\n\n===Angelology===\n{{Main|Heavenly host|Christian angelic hierarchy}}\nMost descriptions of angels in the Bible describe them in military terms. For example, in terms such as encampment ([http://www.bible.org/netbible/gen32.htm Gen.32:1\u20132]), command structure ([http://bible.org/netbible/psa91.htm Ps.91:11\u201312]; [http://bible.org/netbible/mat13.htm Matt.13:41]; [http://bible.org/netbible/index.htm?rev7.htm Rev.7:2]), and combat ([http://bible.org/netbible/index.htm?jdg5.htm Jdg.5:20]; [http://bible.org/netbible/index.htm?job19.htm Job 19:12]; [http://bible.org/netbible/index.htm?rev12.htm Rev.12:7]).\n\nIts specific hierarchy differs slightly from the [[Christian angelic hierarchy|Hierarchy of Angels]] as it surrounds more military services, whereas the Hierarchy of angels is a division of angels into non-military services to God.\n\n====Members of the heavenly host====\n{{Main|Cherub}}\nCherubim are depicted as accompanying God's chariot-throne ([http://bible.org/netbible/psa80.htm Ps.80:1]). {{bibleverse||Exodus|25:18\u201322}} refers to two Cherub statues placed on top of the Ark of the Covenant, the two cherubim are usually interpreted as guarding the throne of God. Other guard-like duties include being posted in locations such as the gates of Eden ([http://bible.org/netbible/gen3.htm Gen.3:24]). Cherubim were mythological winged bulls or other beasts that were part of ancient Near Eastern traditions.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P9sYIRXZZ2MC |encyclopedia=Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible |first1=David Noel |last1=Freedman |first2=Allen C. |last2=Myers |first3=Astrid B. |last3=Beck |publisher=Wm.

Often such banishment is a punishment for disobeying or rebelling against [[God]] (see [[War in Heaven]]). The best-known fallen angel is [[Lucifer]]. Lucifer is a name frequently given to [[Satan]] in [[Christianity|Christian]] belief. This usage stems from a particular interpretation, as a reference to a fallen angel, of a passage in the [[Bible]] ({{Bibleverse||Isaiah|14:3\u201320|ESV}}) that speaks of someone who is given the name of \"Day Star\" or \"Morning Star\" (in [[Latin]], ''Lucifer'') as fallen from heaven. The [[Greek Language|Greek]] [[etymology|etymological]] synonym of Lucifer, \u03a6\u03c9\u03c3\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''Phosphoros'', \"light-bearer\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scripturetext.com/2_peter/1-19.htm |title=ScriptureText.com |publisher=ScriptureText.com |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=phosphorous |title=Etymonline.com |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref> is used of the morning star in {{Bibleverse|2|Peter|1:19|ESV}} and elsewhere with no reference to Satan. But Satan is called Lucifer in many writings later than the Bible, notably in Milton's ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (7.131\u2013134, among others), because, according to Milton, Satan was \"brighter once amidst the host of Angels, than that star the stars among.\"\n\nAllegedly, fallen angels are those which have committed one of the seven deadly sins. Therefore, are banished from heaven and suffer in hell for all eternity. Demons from hell would punish the fallen angel by ripping out their wings as a sign of insignificance and low rank.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.online-literature.com/view.php/paradiselost/7?term=lucifer |title=Online-Literature.com |publisher=Online-Literature.com |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref>\n\n===Heaven===\n[[File:Paradiso Canto 31.jpg|thumb|[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] gaze upon the highest heavens; from [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]'s illustrations to the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.]]\n{{main|Heaven (Christianity)}}\n[[Christianity]] has taught Heaven as a place of [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]], in that it is a shared plane to be attained by all the elect (rather than an abstract experience related to individual concepts of the ideal). The Christian Church has been divided over how people gain this eternal life. From the 16th to the late 19th century, [[Christendom]] was divided between the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] view, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] view, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] view, the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]] view, the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Abyssinian]] view and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] views. See also [[Christian denominations]].\n\nHeaven is the English name for a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] realm wherein human beings who have transcended human living live in an [[afterlife]]. in the Bible and in English, the term \"heaven\" may refer to the physical heavens, the [[atmosphere|sky]] or the seemingly endless expanse of the [[universe]] beyond, the traditional literal meaning of the term in English.\n\nChristianity maintains that entry into Heaven awaits such time as, \"When the form of this world has passed away.\" (*[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_21071999_en.html JPII]) One view expressed in the Bible is that on the day Christ returns the righteous dead are resurrected first, and then those who are alive and judged righteous will be brought up to join them, to be taken to heaven. (I Thess 4:13\u201318)\n\nTwo related and often confused concepts of heaven in Christianity are better described as the [[Resurrection of the dead|\"resurrection of the body\"]], which is exclusively of biblical origin, as contrasted with the \"[[immortality of the soul]]\", which is also evident in the Greek tradition. In the first concept, the soul does not enter heaven until the [[last judgement]] or the \"end of time\" when it (along with the body) is resurrected and judged. In the second concept, the [[Soul#Christianity|soul]] goes to a heaven on another plane such as the [[intermediate state]] immediately after death. These two concepts are generally combined in the doctrine of the double judgement where the soul is judged once at death and goes to a temporary heaven, while awaiting a second and final physical judgement at the [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]].(*[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_21071999_en.html\" JPII], also see [[eschatology]], [[afterlife]])\n\nOne popular medieval view of Heaven was that it existed as a physical place above the clouds and that God and the Angels were physically above, watching over man. Heaven as a physical place survived in the concept that it was located far out into space, and that the stars were \"lights shining through from heaven\".\n\nMany of today's biblical scholars, such as [[N. T. Wright]], in tracing the concept of Heaven back to its Jewish roots, see Earth and Heaven as overlapping or interlocking. Heaven is known as God's space, his dimension, and is not a place that can be reached by human technology. This belief states that Heaven is where God lives and reigns whilst being active and working alongside people on Earth. One day when God restores all things, Heaven and Earth will be forever combined into the [[New Heavens and New Earth]] of the [[World to Come]].\n\n{{See also|Salvation|Soteriology}}\nReligions that teach about heaven differ on how (and if) one gets into it, typically in the [[afterlife]]. In most, entrance to Heaven is conditional on having lived a \"good life\" (within the terms of the spiritual system). A notable exception to this is the '[[sola fide]]' belief of many mainstream Protestants, which teaches that one does not have to live a perfectly \"good life,\" but that one must accept [[Jesus Christ]] as one's saviour, and then Jesus Christ will assume the guilt of one's [[sin]]s; believers are believed to be forgiven regardless of any good or bad \"works\" one has participated in.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjesuschrist.org/|title=What do you think?|accessdate=2008-10-05|publisher=AllAboutJesusChrist.org}}</ref>\n\nMany religions state that those who do not go to heaven will go to a place \"without the presence of God\", [[Hell]], which is eternal (see [[annihilationism]]). Some religions believe that other afterlives exist in addition to Heaven and Hell, such as [[Purgatory]]. One belief, [[universalism]], believes that everyone will go to Heaven eventually, no matter what they have done or believed on earth. Some forms of Christianity believe Hell to be the termination of the soul.\n\nVarious [[saint]]s have had [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] of heaven ({{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|12:2\u20134|KJV}}). The Orthodox concept of life in heaven is described in one of the [[prayer for the dead|prayers for the dead]]: \"...a place of light, a place of green pasture, a place of repose, whence all sickness, sorrow and sighing are fled away.\"<ref>''Book for Commemoration of the Living and the Dead'', trans. Father Lawrence (Holy Trinity Monastery, Jordanville NY), p. 77.</ref>\n\nThe Church bases its belief in Heaven on some main biblical passages in the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures (Old and New Testaments) and collected church wisdom. Heaven is the Realm of the Blessed [[Trinity]], the [[angels]]<ref>Treated extensively in [[C. S. Lewis]], ''The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature'' (1964).</ref> and the [[saints]].<ref>See discussion at http://forums.catholic.com/showthread.php?p=3322510 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509060655/http://forums.catholic.com/showthread.php?p=3322510 |date=9 May 2011 }}, where a.o. Hebrews 12:22\u201324 is quoted.</ref>\n\nThe essential joy of heaven is called the [[beatific vision]], which is derived from the vision of God's essence. The soul rests perfectly in God, and does not, or cannot desire anything else than God. After the [[Last Judgment]], when the soul is reunited with its body, the body participates in the happiness of the soul. It becomes incorruptible, glorious and perfect. Any physical defects the body may have laboured under are erased. Heaven is also known as [[paradise]] in some cases. [[The Great Gulf]] separates heaven from [[hell]].\n\nUpon dying, each soul goes to what is called \"the [[particular judgement]]\" where its own afterlife is decided (i.e. Heaven after Purgatory, straight to Heaven, or [[Hell]].) This is different from \"the general judgement\" also known as \"the [[Last judgement]]\" which will occur when [[Second Coming|Christ returns]] to judge all the living and the dead.\n\nThe term Heaven (which differs from \"The [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]]\" see note below) is applied by the biblical authors to the realm in which God currently resides. Eternal life, by contrast, occurs in a renewed, unspoilt and perfect creation, which can be termed Heaven since God will choose to dwell there permanently with his people, as seen in {{bibleverse||Revelation|21:3}}. There will no longer be any separation between God and man. The believers themselves will exist in incorruptible, resurrected and new bodies; there will be no sickness, no death and no tears. Some teach that death itself is not a natural part of life, but was allowed to happen after [[Adam and Eve]] disobeyed [[God]] (see [[original sin]]) so that mankind would not live forever in a state of [[sin]] and thus a state of separation from God.\n\nMany evangelicals understand this future life to be divided into two distinct periods: first, the [[Millennialism|Millennial Reign of Christ]] (the one thousand years) on this earth, referred to in {{bibleverse||Revelation|20:1\u201310}}; secondly, the [[New Heavens and New Earth]], referred to in Revelation 21 and 22. This millennialism (or chiliasm) is a revival of a strong tradition in the [[Early Church]] that was dismissed by Augustine of Hippo and the Roman Catholic Church after him.\n\nNot only will the believers spend eternity with God, they will also spend it with each other. John's vision recorded in Revelation describes a [[New Jerusalem]] which comes from Heaven to the New Earth, which is seen to be a symbolic reference to the people of God living in community with one another. 'Heaven' will be the place where life will be lived to the full, in the way that the designer planned, each believer 'loving the Lord their God with all their heart and with all their soul and with all their mind' and 'loving their neighbour as themselves' (adapted from Matthew 22:37\u201338, the [[Great Commandment]])\u2014a place of great joy, without the negative aspects of earthly life. See also [[World to Come]].\n\n;Purgatory\n[[Purgatory]] is the condition or temporary punishment<ref name=\"EB-purgatory\"/> in which, it is believed, the [[souls]] of those who die in a state of grace are made ready for [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]]. This is a theological idea that has ancient roots and is well-attested in [[early Christian]] literature, while the poetic conception of purgatory as a geographically situated place is largely the creation of medieval Christian piety and imagination.<ref name=\"EB-purgatory\"/>\n\nThe notion of purgatory is associated particularly with the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]] (in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern sui juris churches or rites]] it is a doctrine, though often without using the name \"Purgatory\"); [[Anglican]]s of the [[Anglo-Catholic]] tradition generally also hold to the belief.

It is generally agreed that both [[sheol]] and [[hades]] do not typically refer to the place of eternal punishment, but to the [[underworld]] or temporary abode of the dead.<ref>''New Bible Dictionary'' third edition, IVP 1996.

This view is often called [[Christian universalism]]\u2014its conservative branch is more specifically called 'Biblical or [[Trinitarian Universalism]]'\u2014and is not to be confused with [[Unitarian Universalism]]. See [[universal reconciliation]], ''[[apocatastasis]]'' and [[the problem of Hell]].\n\n===Theodicy: Allowance of evil===\n{{further|Theodicy and the Bible}}\n[[Theodicy]] can be said to be defense of God's goodness and omnipotence in view of the existence of evil. Specifically, Theodicy is a specific branch of [[theology]] and [[philosophy]] which attempts to reconcile belief in [[God]] with the perceived existence of [[evil]].<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: Theodicy</ref> As such, theodicy can be said to attempt to justify the behaviour of [[God]] (at least insofar as God allows evil).\n\nResponses to the problem of evil have sometimes been classified as ''defenses'' or ''theodicies''. However, authors disagree on the exact definitions.<ref name=\"Stanford\">The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil The Problem of Evil]\", [[Michael Tooley]]</ref><ref name=\"IepEvidential\">The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \"[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-evi.htm The Evidential Problem of Evil]\", Nick Trakakis</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopaedia |first=Ted |last=Honderich |authorlink=Ted Honderich |year=2005 |title=theodicy |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |quote=[[John Hick]], for example, proposes a theodicy, while [[Alvin Plantinga]] formulates a defense. The idea of human free will often appears in both of these strategies, but in different ways.}}</ref> Generally, a ''defense'' attempts to show that there is no logical incompatibility between the existence of evil and the existence of God. A defense need not argue that this is a probable or plausible explanation, only that the defense is logically possible. A defense attempts to answer the ''logical'' problem of evil.\n\nA theodicy, on the other hand, is a more ambitious attempt to provide a plausible justification for the existence of evil. A theodicy attempts to answer the ''evidential'' problem of evil.<ref name=\"IepEvidential\" /> [[Richard Swinburne]] maintains that it does not make sense to assume there are greater goods, unless we know what they are, i.e., we have a successful theodicy.<ref name=swinburne05>{{cite encyclopaedia |first=Richard |last=Swinburne |authorlink=Richard Swinburne |year=2005 |title=evil, the problem of |editor=[[Ted Honderich]] |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |isbn=0-19-926479-1}}</ref>\n\nAs an example, some authors see arguments including [[demon]]s or the [[fall of man]] as not logically impossible but not very plausible considering our knowledge about the world. Thus they are seen as defenses but not good theodicies.<ref name=\"IepEvidential\"/> [[C. S. Lewis]] writes in his book [[The Problem of Pain]]:\n{{quote|We can, perhaps, conceive of a world in which God corrected the results of this abuse of free will by His creatures at every moment: so that a wooden beam became soft as grass when it was used as a weapon, and the air refused to obey me if I attempted to set up in it the sound waves that carry lies or insults. But such a world would be one in which wrong actions were impossible, and in which, therefore, freedom of the will would be void; nay, if the principle were carried out to its logical conclusion, evil thoughts would be impossible, for the cerebral matter which we use in thinking would refuse its task when we attempted to frame them.<ref>Lewis, C. S., ''The Problem of Pain'' HarperCollins:New York, 1996 pp. 24\u201325</ref>}}\n\nAnother possible answer is that the world is corrupted due to the sin of mankind. Some answer that because of sin, the world has fallen from the grace of God, and is not perfect. Therefore, evils and imperfections persist because the world is fallen.<ref>Rhodes, Ron, [http://ldolphin.org/evil.html Notes on the Problem of Evil]</ref> [[William A. Dembski]] argues that the effects of Adam's sin recorded in the Book of Genesis were 'back-dated' by God, and hence applied to the earlier history of the universe.<ref>William A. Dembski, The End of Christianity: Finding a Good God in an Evil World. (Nashville: Broadman and Holman, 2009</ref>\n\nEvil is sometimes seen as a test or trial for humans. [[Irenaeus|Irenaeus of Lyons]] and more recently [[John Hick]] have argued that evil and suffering are necessary for spiritual growth. This is often combined with the free will argument by arguing that such spiritual growth requires free will decisions. A problem with this is that many evils do not seem to cause any kind of spiritual growth, or even permit it, as when a child is abused from birth and becomes, seemingly inevitably, a brutal adult.\n\nThe problem of evil is often phrased in the form: ''Why do bad things happen to good people?''. [[Christianity]] teach that all people are inherently sinful due to the [[fall of man]] and [[original sin]]; for example, [[Calvinist]] theology follows a doctrine called [[federal headship]], which argues that the first man, [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], was the legal representative of the entire human race. A counterargument to the basic version of this principle is that an omniscient God would have predicted this, when he created the world, and an omnipotent God could have prevented it.\n\nThe [[Book of Isaiah]] clearly claims that God is the source of at least some natural disasters, but Isaiah doesn't attempt to explain the motivation behind the creation of evil.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+45%3A7&version=KJV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Isaiah 45:7 \u2013 King James Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref> In contrast, the [[Book of Job]] is one of the most widely known formulations of the problem of evil in Western thought. In it, Satan challenges God regarding his servant Job, claiming that Job only serves God for the blessings and protection that he receives from him. God allows Satan to plague Job and his family in a number of ways, with the limitation that Satan may not take Job's life (but his children are killed). Job discusses this with three friends and questions God regarding his suffering which he finds to be unjust. God responds in a speech and then more than restores Job's prior health, wealth, and gives him new children.\n\n[[Bart D. Ehrman]] argues that different parts of the Bible give different answers. One example is evil as punishment for sin or as a consequence of sin. Ehrman writes that this seems to be based on some notion of free will although this argument is never explicitly mentioned in the Bible. Another argument is that suffering ultimately achieves a greater good, possibly for persons other than the sufferer, that would not have been possible otherwise. The Book of Job offers two different answers: suffering is a test, and you will be rewarded later for passing it; another that God in his might chooses not to reveal his reasons. [[Ecclesiastes]] sees suffering as beyond human abilities to comprehend. [[Apocalyptic literature|Apocalyptic]] parts, including the [[New Testament]], see suffering as due to cosmic evil forces, that God for mysterious reasons has given power over the world, but which will soon be defeated and things will be set right.<ref>Ehrman, Bart D., ''God's Problem: How the Bible Fails to Answer Our Most Important Question \u2013 Why We Suffer''. HarperOne, 2008</ref>\n\n==Hamartiology: Sin==\n{{Main|Hamartiology|Christian views on sin|Christian anthropology}}\nThe Greek word in the [[New Testament]] that is translated in English as \"sin\" is ''[[hamartia]]'', which literally means ''missing the target''. [[1 John]] 3:4 states: \"Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is [[antinomianism|lawlessness]]\". Jesus [[Expounding of the Law|clarified the law]] by defining its foundation: \"Jesus replied: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and [[Great Commandment|greatest commandment]]. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' All the [[Torah|Law]] and the [[Neviim|Prophets]] hang on these two commandments.\" ({{bibleverse||Matthew|22:36\u201340|NIV}})\n\nHamartiology ({{lang-el|\u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1}}, ''[[hamartia]]'', \"missing the mark,\" \"sin,\" + -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1, ''[[Logos|-logia]]'', \"sayings\" or \"discourse\") is the branch of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]], more specifically, [[systematic theology]], which is the study of [[sin]] with a view to articulating a doctrine of it.\n\nSubstantial branches of hamartiological understanding subscribe to the doctrine of [[original sin]], which was taught by the Apostle Paul in Romans 5:12\u201319 and popularized by [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]. He taught that all the descendants of [[Adam and Eve]] are guilty of Adam's sin without their own personal choice <ref>Bavink, Herman. ''Reformed Dogmatics'' Vol. 3. (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2004) pp. 75\u2013125 detail the historical development of Hamartiology, including Pelagius's position and the mediating positions)</ref>\n\nIn contrast, [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]] argued that humans enter life as essentially ''[[tabula rasa|tabulae rasae]]''. [[Fall of man|The fall]] that occurred when Adam and Eve disobeyed [[God]] was held by his group to have affected humankind only minimally. But few theologians continue to hold this hamartiological viewpoint.\n\nA third branch of thinking takes an intermediate position, arguing that after the fall of Adam and Eve, humans are born impacted by sin such that they have very decided tendencies toward sinning (which by personal choice all accountable humans but [[Jesus]] soon choose to indulge).\n\nThe degree to which a Christian believes humanity is impacted by either a literal or metaphorical \"fall\" determines their understanding of related theological concepts like [[salvation]], [[Justification (theology)|justification]], and [[sanctification]].\n\nChristian views on sin are mostly understood as legal infraction or contract violation, and so salvation tends to be viewed in legal terms, similar to Jewish thinking.\n\n===Sin===\n{{Main|Sin}}\n[[File:Forbidden fruit.jpg|thumb|A [[Sistine Chapel]] [[fresco]] depicts the expulsion of [[Adam and Eve]] from the garden of Eden for their sin of eating from the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.]]\nIn [[religion]], sin is the concept of acts that violate a [[morality|moral]] [[norm (philosophy)|rule]]. The term sin may also refer to the [[state (polity)|state]] of having committed such a violation. Commonly, the moral [[code of conduct]] is decreed by a divine entity, i.e. [[Divine law]].\n\nSin is often used to mean an action that is prohibited or considered wrong; in some religions (notably some sects of [[Christianity]]), sin can refer not only to physical actions taken, but also to thoughts and internalized motivations and feelings. Colloquially, any thought, word, or act considered immoral, [[shame]]ful, harmful, or alienating might be termed \"sinful\".\n\nAn elementary concept of \"sin\" regards such acts and elements of Earthly living that one cannot take with them into [[Heaven|transcendental living]]. Food, for example is not of transcendental living and therefore its excessive savoring is considered a sin. A more developed concept of \"sin\" deals with a distinction between sins of [[death]] ([[mortal sin]]) and the sins of human living ([[venial sin]]). In that context, mortal sins are said to have the dire consequence of [[divine punishment|mortal penalty]], while sins of living ([[food]], casual or informal [[Human sexual activity|sexuality]], [[play (activity)|play]], [[inebriation]]) may be regarded as essential spice for transcendental living, even though these may be destructive in the context of human living (obesity, [[infidelity]]).\n\nCommon ideas surrounding sin in various religions include:\n* [[Punishment]] for sins, from other people, from [[God]] either in life or in [[afterlife]], or from the Universe in general.\n* The question of whether an act must be intentional to be sinful.\n* The idea that one's [[conscience]] should produce [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] for a conscious act of sin.\n* A scheme for determining the seriousness of the sin.\n* [[Repentance]] from (expressing regret for and determining not to commit) sin, and [[Restitution (theology)|atonement]] (repayment) for past deeds.\n* The possibility of [[forgiveness]] of sins, often through communication with a deity or intermediary; in [[Christianity]] often referred to as [[salvation]]. [[Crime]] and [[justice]] are related [[secularism|secular]] concepts.\n\nIn [[Western Christianity]], \"sin is [[Antinomianism|lawlessness]]\" (1 John 3:4) and so salvation tends to be understood in legal terms, similar to Jewish law. Sin alienates the sinner from God. It has damaged, and completely severed, the relationship of humanity to God. That relationship can only be restored through acceptance of [[Christ|Jesus Christ]] and his death on the cross as a sacrifice for mankind's sin (see [[Salvation]] and [[Substitutionary atonement]]).\n\nIn [[Eastern Christianity]], sin is viewed in terms of its effects on relationships, both among people and between people and God. Sin is seen as the refusal to follow God's plan, and the desire to be like God and thus in direct opposition to him (see the account of [[Adam and Eve]] in the [[Book of Genesis]]). To sin is to want control of one's destiny in opposition to the will of God,\nto do some rigid beliefs.\n\nIn [[Russian Orthodox|Russian]] variant of [[Eastern Christianity]], sin sometimes is regarded as any mistake made by people in their life. From this point of view every person is sinful because every person makes mistakes during his life. When person accuses others in sins he always must remember that he is also sinner and so he must have mercy for others remembering that God is also merciful to him and to all humanity.\n\n===Fall of man===\n{{Main|Fall of man}}\nThe fall of man or simply the fall refers in [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrine to the transition of the first humans from a state of innocent obedience to [[God]], to a state of guilty disobedience to God. In the [[Book of Genesis]] chapter 2, [[Adam and Eve]] live at first with God in a [[paradise]], but are then deceived or tempted by the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] to eat [[Forbidden fruit|fruit]] from the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]], which had been forbidden to them by God. After doing so they become ashamed of their nakedness, and God consequently expelled them from [[paradise]]. The fall is not mentioned by name in the [[Bible]], but the story of disobedience and expulsion is recounted in both Testaments in different ways. The Fall can refer to the wider theological inferences for all humankind as a consequence of Eve and Adam's [[original sin]]. Examples include the teachings of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] in {{Bibleref2|Romans|5:12\u201319}} and {{Bibleref2|1Cor|15:21\u201322||1 Cor. 15:21\u201322}}.\n\nSome [[Christian denominations]] believe the fall corrupted the entire natural world, including human nature, causing people to be born into [[original sin]], a state from which they cannot attain [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] without the [[Grace (Christianity)|gracious intervention of God]]. [[Protestants]] hold that [[Jesus]]' death was a [[Atonement (ransom view)|\"ransom\"]] by which humanity was offered freedom from the sin acquired at the fall. In other religions, such as [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], and [[Gnosticism]], the term \"the fall\" is not recognized and varying interpretations of the Eden narrative are presented.\n\n[[Christianity]] interprets the fall in a number of ways. Traditional Christian theology accepts the teaching of [[Paul of Tarsus|St Paul]] in his letter to the [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]]<ref>Paul's Epistle to the Romans, chapter 3 verse 23</ref>{{Better source|reason=Theology is a synthesis on the bible, and so needs theological sources|date=March 2010}} \"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\" and of [[John the Evangelist|St John]]'s [[Gospel]] that \"God so loved the world that he sent his only son (Jesus Christ) that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life\".{{Bibleref2c|John|3:16|}}{{Better source|reason=Theology is a synthesis on the bible, and so needs theological sources|date=March 2010}}\n\nThe doctrine of [[original sin]], as articulated by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine of Hippo's]] interpretation of [[Paul of Tarsus]], provides that the fall caused a fundamental change in human nature, so that all descendants of Adam are born in [[sin]], and can only be redeemed by [[Grace (Christianity)|divine grace]]. Sacrifice was the only means by which humanity could be redeemed after the fall. Jesus, who was without sin, died on the [[crucifixion|cross]] as the ultimate redemption for the sin of humankind.\n\n===Original sin===\n{{Main|Original sin}}\nThus, the moment Adam and Eve ate the fruit from the tree\u2014which God had commanded them not to do\u2014sinful death was born; ''it was an act of disobedience, thinking they could become like gods, that was the sin''. Since Adam was the head of the human race, he is held responsible for the evil that took place, for which reason the [[fall of man]] is referred to as the \"[[sin of Adam]]\". This sin caused Adam and his descendants to lose unrestricted access to God Himself. The years of life were limited. \"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned\" ({{bibleverse||Romans|5:12|KJV}}).

[[Thomas Aquinas]] explained Augustine's doctrine pointing out that the ''libido'' (''concupiscence''), which makes the original sin pass from parents to children, is not a ''libido actualis'', i.e. sexual lust, but ''libido habitualis'', i.e. a wound of the whole of human nature.<ref>''Libido quae transmittit peccatum originale in prolem, non-est libido actualis, quia dato quod virtute divina concederetur alicui quod nullam inordinatam libidinem in actu generationis sentiret, adhuc transmitteret in prolem originale peccatum.

In Augustine's view (termed \"Realism\"), all of humanity was really present in Adam when he sinned, and therefore all have sinned. Original sin, according to Augustine, consists of the guilt of Adam which all humans inherit. As sinners, humans are utterly depraved in nature, lack the freedom to do good, and cannot respond to the will of God without [[Grace (Christianity)|divine grace]].

Calvin believed that humans inherit Adamic guilt and are in a state of sin from the moment of conception. This inherently sinful nature (the basis for the [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] doctrine of \"[[total depravity]]\") results in a complete alienation from God and the total inability of humans to achieve reconciliation with God based on their own abilities. Not only do individuals inherit a sinful nature due to Adam's fall, but since he was the federal head and representative of the human race, all whom he represented inherit the guilt of his sin by imputation.\n\n;New Testament\nThe scriptural basis for the doctrine is found in two New Testament books by [[Paul the Apostle]], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%205:12-21&version=NIV Romans 5:12\u201321] and [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:22&version=NIV 1 Corinthians 15:22], in which he identifies Adam as the one man through whom death came into the world.<ref name=\"ODCC-Doctrine\" />\n<ref>''Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned''\u2014for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law.

The doctrine of total depravity asserts that people are by nature not inclined or even able to love God wholly with heart, mind, and strength, but rather all are inclined by nature to serve their own will and desires and to reject the rule of God. Even religion and [[philanthropy]] are wicked to God to the extent that these originate from a human imagination, passion, and will and are not done to the glory of God. Therefore, in [[Calvinism|Reformed theology]], if God is to save anyone He must [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestine]], call, elect individuals to salvation since fallen man does not want to, indeed is incapable of choosing God.<ref>The ''[[Westminster Confession of Faith]]'', [http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_IX.html 9.3]</ref>\n\nTotal depravity does not mean, however, that people are as evil as possible. Rather, it means that even the good which a person may intend is faulty in its premise, false in its motive, and weak in its implementation; and there is no mere refinement of natural capacities that can correct this condition. Thus, even acts of generosity and altruism are in fact [[psychological egoism|egoist]] acts in disguise. All good, consequently, is derived from God alone, and in no way through man.<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Ra McLaughlin |journal=Reformed Perspectives |title=Total Depravity, part 1 |url=http://thirdmill.org/newfiles/ra_mclaughlin/TH.McLaughlin.Total_Depravity.1.html |accessdate=2008-07-14 |quote=[Any person] can do outwardly good works, but these works come from a heart that hates God, and therefore fail to meet God's righteous standards.}}</ref>\n\n===Comparison among Protestants===\nThis table summarizes three Protestant beliefs on depravity.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In Christian theology the atonement refers to the forgiving or pardoning of one's [[sin]] through the death of [[Jesus Christ]] by [[crucifixion]], which made possible the reconciliation between God and creation. Within Christianity there are three main theories for how such atonement might work: the [[Atonement (ransom view)|ransom theory]], the [[Atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction theory]] and the [[Atonement (moral influence view)|moral influence theory]]. Christian soteriology is unlike and not to be confused with [[collective salvation]].\n\n===Traditional focus===\nChristian soteriology traditionally focuses on how God ends the separation people have from him due to [[sin]] by reconciling them with himself. ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:10-11;&version=9; Rom. 5:10\u201311]). Many Christians believe they receive the forgiveness of sins ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=51&chapter=2&verse=38&version=31&context=verse Acts 2:38]), life ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=52&chapter=8&verse=11&version=31&context=verse Rom. 8:11]), and salvation ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=59&chapter=5&verse=9&version=31&context=verse 1 Thess. 5:9]) bought by [[Jesus]] through his innocent suffering, death, and resurrection from the dead three days later ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&chapter=28&version=47&context=chapter Matt. 28]).\n\nChrist's death, resurrection, ascension, and sending of the [[Holy Spirit]], is called ''The Paschal Mystery''. Christ's human birth is called the ''[[Incarnation]]''. Either or both are considered in different versions of soteriology.\n\nWhile not neglecting the ''Paschal Mystery'', many Christians believe salvation is brought through the ''Incarnation'' itself, in which God took on human nature so that humans could partake in the divine nature (2 Peter 1.4). As [[St. Athanasius]] put it, God became human so that we might become divine (St. Athanasius, De inc. 54, 3: PG 25, 192B.). This [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] in Christ ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=53&chapter=1&verse=4&version=31&context=verse 1 Cor. 1:4]) is received as a gift of God that cannot be merited by works done prior to one's conversion to Christianity ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:8-9;&version=31; Eph. 2:8\u20139]), which is brought about by hearing God's Word ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=52&chapter=10&verse=17&version=50&context=verse Rom. 10:17]) and harkening to it. This involves accepting Jesus Christ as the personal saviour and Lord over one's life.\n\n===Distinct schools===\nProtestant teaching, originating with [[Martin Luther]], teaches that salvation is received by [[Sola gratia|grace alone]] and that one's sole necessary response to this grace is [[Sola fide|faith alone]]. Older Christian teaching, as found in Catholic and Orthodox theology, is that salvation is received by [[Sola gratia|grace alone]], but that one's necessary response to this grace comprises both faith and works (James 2:24, 26; Rom 2:6\u20137; Gal 5:6).\n\n===Catholic soteriology===\nHuman beings exists because God wanted to share His life with them. In this sense, every human being is God's child. In a fuller sense, to come to salvation is to be reconciled to God through Christ and to be united with His divine Essence via [[Divinization (Christian)|Theosis]] in the [[beatific vision]] of the Godhead. The graces of Christ's passion, death, and resurrection are found in the [[Catholic sacraments|seven sacraments]] of the [[Catholic Church]].\n\n===Comparison among Protestants===\n{{Comparison among Protestants}}\n\n==Ecclesiology: Church==\n{{Main|Ecclesiology}}\n[[Ecclesiology]] (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u1fb1}}, ''ekkl\u0113si\u0101'', \"[[wikt:congregation|congregation]], [[church (building)|church]]\";\nand {{lang|grc|-\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is the study of the theological understanding of the [[Christian church]], including the [[institution|institutional structure]], [[sacrament]]s and practices (especially the [[worship]] of God) thereof. Specific areas of concern include the church's role in [[salvation]], its origin, its relationship to the historical [[Jesus|Christ]], its discipline, its [[eschatology|destiny]], and its [[clergy|leadership]]. Ecclesiology is, therefore, the study of the church as a thing in, and of, itself.\n\nDifferent ecclesiologies give shape to very different institutions. Thus, in addition to describing a broad discipline of theology, ecclesiology may be used in the specific sense of a particular church or denomination's character, self-described or otherwise. This is the sense of the word in such phrases as ''Roman Catholic ecclesiology'', ''Lutheran ecclesiology'', and ''ecumenical ecclesiology''.\n\n;Issues addressed by ecclesiology\nEcclesiology asks the questions:\n* '''Who is the Church?''' Is it a visible or earthly [[corporation]] or a unified, visible society\u2014a \"church\" in the sense of a specific denomination or institution, for instance? Or is it the body of all believing [[Christianity|Christians]] (see [[invisible church]]) regardless of their [[religious denomination|denominational]] differences and disunity? What is the relationship between living Christians and [[saint|departed]] Christians (the \"[[cloud of witnesses]]\")\u2013 do they (those on Earth and those in Heaven) constitute together the Church?\n* '''Must one join a church?''' That is, what is the role of corporate [[worship]] in the spiritual lives of believers? Is it in fact necessary? Can salvation be found outside of formal membership in a given faith community, and what constitutes \"membership?\" ([[Baptism]]? Formal acceptance of a [[creed]]?

Is the organizational structure itself, either in a single corporate body, or generally within the range of formal church structures, an ''independent vehicle'' of [[revelation]] or of [[God]]'s [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]]? Or is the Church's authority instead dependent on and derivative of a ''separate and prior divine revelation external to the organization'', with individual institutions being \"the Church\" only to the extent that they teach this message?

It also denotes the [[Minister of religion|ministerial]] structure of the church and the authority relationships between churches. Polity is closely related to [[Ecclesiology]], the study of doctrine and theology relating to church organization.\n\nIssues of church governance appear in the first chapters of the [[Acts of the Apostles]]; the first act recorded after the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascension]] is the election of [[Saint Matthias|Matthias]] to replace [[Judas Iscariot]]. Over the years a system of episcopal polity developed.\n\nDuring the [[Protestant Reformation]], arguments were made that the [[New Testament]] prescribed structures quite different from that of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] of the day, and different Protestant bodies used different types of polity. It was during this period that [[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]] wrote ''[[Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity]]'' to defend the polity of the [[Church of England]] against the [[Puritans]].\n\nEpiscopal polity is used in several closely related senses. Most commonly it refers to the field of church governance in the abstract, but it also can refer to the governance of a particular Christian body. In this sense it is used as a term in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. \"Polity\" is sometimes used as a shorthand for the church governance structure itself.\n\nThough each church or denomination has its own characteristic structure, there are three general types of polity.\n\n;Episcopal polity\n{{Main|Episcopal polity}}\nChurches having episcopal polity are governed by [[bishop]]s. The title bishop comes from the Greek word ''episkopos'', which literally translates into ''overseer''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bishop |title=Bishop\u2013 Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=25 April 2007 |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref> In regard to [[Catholicism]], bishops have authority over the [[diocese]], which is both sacramental and political; as well as performing [[ordination]]s, [[confirmation]]s, and [[consecration]]s, the bishop supervises the [[clergy]] of the diocese and represents the diocese both secularly and in the hierarchy of church governance.\n\nBishops in this system may be subject to higher ranking bishops (variously called [[archbishop]]s, [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitans]] or [[patriarch]]s, depending upon the tradition; ''see also [[Bishop]] for further explanation of the varieties of bishops''.) They also meet in councils or [[synod]]s. These synods, subject to presidency by higher ranking bishops, may govern the dioceses which are represented in the council, though the [[synod]] may also be purely advisory.\n\nNote that the presence of the office of \"bishop\" within a church is not proof of episcopal polity. For example, in [[Mormonism]], the \"bishop\" occupies the office that in an [[Anglican]] church would be occupied by a [[priest]].\n\nAlso, episcopal polity is not usually a simple chain of command.\nInstead, some authority may be held, not only by synods and colleges of bishops, but by [[Laity|lay]] and [[Clergy|clerical]] councils. Further, patterns of authority are subject to a wide variety of historical rights and honors which may cut across simple lines of authority.\n\nEpiscopal polity is the predominant pattern in [[Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Anglican]] churches. It is also common in [[Methodist]] and [[Lutheran]] churches. Among churches with episcopal polity, different theories of autonomy are expressed. So in [[Roman Catholicism]] the church is viewed as a single polity headed by the [[pope]], but in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] the various churches retain formal [[autonomy]] but are held to be unified by shared doctrine and [[conciliarity]]\u2014that is, the authority of councils, such as [[ecumenical council]]s, [[Holy Synod]]s and the former standing council, the [[Endemusa Synod]].\n\n;Presbyterian polity\n{{Main|Presbyterian polity}}\nMany [[Reformed]] churches, notably those in the [[Presbyterian]] and Continental Reformed traditions, are governed by a hierarchy of councils. The lowest level council governs a single local church and is called the ''[[Kirk Session|session]]'' or ''[[Consistory (Protestantism)#Reformed usage|consistory]]''; its members are called ''[[Elder (religious)|elders]]''. The [[minister of religion|minister]] of the church (sometimes referred to as a ''teaching elder'') is a member of and presides over the session; lay representatives (''ruling elders'' or, informally, just elders) are elected by the congregation. The session sends representatives to the next level higher council, called the ''[[presbytery (church polity)|presbytery]]'' or ''classis''. In some Presbyterian churches there are higher level councils ([[synod]]s or [[General Assembly (presbyterian church)|general assemblies]]). Each council has authority over its constituents, and the representatives at each level are expected to use their own judgment. Hence higher level councils act as courts of appeal for church trials and disputes, and it is not uncommon to see rulings and decisions overturned.\n\nPresbyterian polity is, of course, the characteristic governance of [[Presbyterian]] churches, and also of churches in the Continental [[Reformed]] tradition. Elements of presbyterian polity are also found in other churches. For example, in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] governance by bishops is paralleled by a system of deputies, who are lay and clerical representatives elected by parishes and, at the national level, by the dioceses. Legislation in the [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|general convention]] requires the separate consent of the bishops and of the deputies.\n\nNote that, in episcopal polity, a [[presbyter]] refers to a [[priest]].\n\n;Congregational polity\n{{Main|Congregational polity}}\n[[Congregationalist polity]] dispenses with titled positions such as [[bishop]] as a requirement of church structure. The local congregation rules itself, though local leaders and councils may be appointed.\n\nMembers may be sent from the congregation to associations that are sometimes identified with the church bodies formed by [[Lutheran]]s, [[Presbyterian]]s, [[Anglican]]s, and other non-congregational [[Protestants]]. The similarity is deceptive, however, because the congregationalist associations do not exercise control over their members (other than ending their membership in the association). Many congregationalist churches are completely independent in principle. One major exception is [[Ordination]], where even congregationalist churches often invite members of the [[vicinage]] or association to ordain their called pastor.\n\nIt is a principle of congregationalism that ministers do not govern congregations by themselves. They may preside over the congregation, but it is the congregation which exerts its authority in the end.\n\nCongregational polity is sometimes called \"Baptist polity\", as it is the characteristic polity of [[Baptist church]]es.\n\n===Priesthood===\n{{Main|Priesthood}}\n* [[Laity]], [[Priesthood of all believers]]\n* [[Clergy]], [[Bishop]], [[Priest]], [[Pastor]], [[Elder (Christianity)|Elder]]\n\n===Church discipline===\n{{Main|Church discipline}}\n\n===Missiology===\n{{Main|Missiology}}\n\n===Sacrament===\n{{Main|Sacrament}}\nA sacrament, as defined in Hexam's ''Concise Dictionary of Religion'', is what [[Roman Catholic]]s believe to be \"a [[rite]] in which [[God]] is uniquely active.\" [[Augustine of Hippo]] defined a [[Christianity|Christian]] sacrament as \"a visible sign of an invisible reality.\" The [[Anglican]] [[Book of Common Prayer]] speaks of them as \"an outward and visible sign of an inward and invisible [[Grace (Christianity)|Grace]].\" Examples of sacraments would be [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]].\"<ref>Hexam's ''Concise Dictionary of Religion'' \"Sacrament\" obtained at https://www.ucalgary.ca/~nurelweb/concise/WORDS-S.html</ref> Therefore a sacrament is a [[religious symbol]] or often a [[rite]] which conveys [[Grace (Christianity)|divine grace]], [[blessing]], or [[sanctity]] upon the believer who participates in it, or a tangible symbol which represents an intangible reality. As defined above, an example would be [[baptism]] in water, representing (and conveying) the [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] of the gift of the [[Holy Spirit]], the [[Forgiveness of Sins]], and membership into the [[Christian church|Church]]. Anointing with [[holy anointing oil]] is another example which is often synonymous with receiving the [[Holy Spirit]] and salvation. Another way of looking at Sacraments is that they are an external and physical sign of the conferral of [[Sanctifying Grace]].<ref>Catholic Encyclopaedia: \"Sacraments\" http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13295a.htm</ref>\n\nThroughout the Christian faith, views concerning which rites are sacramental, that is conferring [[sanctifying grace]], and what it means for an external act to be sacramental vary widely. Other religious traditions also have what might be called \"sacraments\" in a sense, though not necessarily according to the Christian meaning of the term.\n\n;General definitions and terms\nIn the majority of Western Christianity, the generally accepted definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign that conveys spiritual [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] through Christ. Christian [[Church body|churches]], [[religious denomination|denominations]], and [[sect]]s are divided regarding the number and operation of the sacraments. Sacraments are generally held to have been instituted by [[Jesus Christ]], although in some cases this point is debated. They are usually administered by the [[clergy]] to a recipient or recipients, and are generally understood to involve visible and invisible components. The invisible component (manifested inwardly) is understood to be brought about by the action of the Holy Spirit, [[God]]'s grace working in the sacrament's participants, while the visible (or outward) component entails the use of such things as water, oil, and bread and wine that is blessed or [[Consecration|consecrated]]; the laying-on-of-hands; or a particularly significant covenant that is marked by a public benediction (such as with marriage or absolution of sin in the reconciliation of a penitent).\n\nAs defined by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], recognised by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox churches]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], (though these two do not categorically define the number), and [[Independent Catholic Churches|Independent Catholic]] and [[Old Catholic Church]].\n\nThe Orthodox Churches (Eastern and Oriental) typically do not limit the number of sacraments, viewing all encounters with reality in life as sacramental in some sense, and their acknowledgement of the number of sacraments at seven as an innovation of convenience not found in the [[Church Fathers]]. It came into use, although infrequently, later on from later encounters with the West and its Sacramental Theology.<ref>The Sacraments http://www.oca.org/QA.asp?ID=122&SID=3</ref> Other denominations and traditions, both in eastern and western Christianity may affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments, these include many of the [[Protestant]] denominations and some of the [[Old Believers]] in the Orthodox communion, some of whom reject all sacraments except Baptism.\n\nSince some post-Reformation denominations do not regard clergy as having a classically [[sacerdotalism|sacerdotal]] or priestly function, they avoid the term \"sacrament,\" preferring the terms \"sacerdotal function,\" \"ordinance,\" or \"tradition.\" This belief invests the efficacy of the ''ordinance'' in the obedience and participation of the believer and the witness of the presiding minister and the congregation. This view stems from a highly developed concept of the [[priesthood of all believers]]. In this sense, the believer himself or herself performs the sacerdotal role {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.\n\n====Eucharist====\n{{Main|Eucharist}}\n* [[Transsubstantiation]] (Roman Catholicism)\n* [[Anglican Eucharistic theology]]\n* [[Sacramental Union]] (Lutheran)\n\nEucharist, also called Communion, or the Lord's Supper, and other names, is a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[sacrament]] or [[Ordinance (Christian)|ordinance]], generally considered to be a re-enactment of the [[Last Supper]], the final meal that [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] shared with his disciples before his arrest and eventual [[crucifixion]]. The consecration of bread and a cup within the [[rite]] recalls the moment at the Last Supper when Jesus gave his disciples bread, saying, \"This is my body\", and wine, saying, \"This is my blood\".<ref name=\"EB-purgatory\"/><ref>Ignazio Silone, ''Bread and Wine'' (1937).</ref>\n\nThere are different interpretations of the significance of the Eucharist, but \"there is more of a consensus among Christians about the meaning of the Eucharist than would appear from the confessional debates over the sacramental presence, the effects of the Eucharist, and the proper auspices under which it may be celebrated.\"<ref name=EB-Eucharist>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9033174/Eucharist |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, s.v.

Some Christians reject the concept of the real presence, believing that the Eucharist is only a [[memorialism|memorial]] of the death of Christ.\n\nThe [https://web.archive.org/web/20080709031256/http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-commissions/faith-and-order-commission/i-unity-the-church-and-its-mission/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry-faith-and-order-paper-no-111-the-lima-text/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry.html#c10499 ''Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry'' document] of the [[World Council of Churches]], attempting to present the common understanding of the Eucharist on the part of the generality of Christians, describes it as \"essentially the sacrament of the gift which God makes to us in Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit\", \"Thanksgiving to the Father\", \"Anamnesis or Memorial of Christ\", \"the sacrament of the unique sacrifice of Christ, who ever lives to make intercession for us\", \"the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, the sacrament of his [[real presence]]\", \"Invocation of the Spirit\", \"Communion of the Faithful\", and \"Meal of the Kingdom\".\n\n====Baptism====\n{{Main|Baptism}}\n* [[Infant baptism]]\n* [[Believer's baptism]]\n\n==Eschatology==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\n[[File:Michelangelo&nbsp;- Cristo Juiz.jpg|thumb|Detail from the [[Last Judgement]] by [[Michelangelo]]]]\n{{Main|Christian eschatology }}\n{{See also|Christian eschatological views}}\n[[Eschatology]] (derived from the Greek roots \u1f14\u03c3\u03c7\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \"last\" and \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \"discourse,\" \"study\") is the study of the end of things, whether the end of an individual life, the end of the age, or the end of the world. Broadly speaking, it is the study of the destiny of man as revealed in the [[Bible]].\n\nEschatology is concerned with the [[afterlife]], beginning with [[death]] and the personal [[judgment]] which follows the death of the individual, and which is followed by the destination of [[heaven]] or [[hell]]. (In Catholic theology, heaven is sometimes preceded by [[purgatory]].) Eschatology also concerns itself with events which are said to happen at the end of this age: the [[Second Coming|return of Jesus]], the [[resurrection of the dead]], the [[Rapture]], the [[Tribulation]], and following these things, the Millennium, or thousand years of peace, which has been interpreted both literally and symbolically. Finally, eschatology concerns itself with the [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]] and its associated events: the [[Last Judgment]]; the banishment of Death, Hades, and Satan and his followers to the Lake of Fire; and the creation of a new heaven and earth. [[Millennarianism|Millenarianists]], [[Millerism|Seventh Day Adventists]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and other recently founded sects have been influential in the modern development of these doctrines, though their roots are biblical.\n\nEschatology is an ancient branch of study in Christian theology, with study of the \"last things\" and the [[Second Coming of Christ]] first touched on by [[Ignatius of Antioch]] (c. 35\u2013107 AD), then given more consideration by the Christian apologist in Rome, [[St Justin Martyr|Justin Martyr]] (c. 100\u2013165). Treatment of eschatology continued in the West in the teachings of the influential theologian of Roman North Africa, [[Tertullian]] (c. 160\u2013225), and was given fuller reflection and speculation soon after in the East by the master theologian, [[Origen]] (c. 185\u2013254).<ref>Alexander Roberts & James Donaldson, eds. ''Ante-Nicene Fathers.'' (16 vol.) Peabody, Massachusetts: Hendrickson, 1994. The writings of Ignatius and Justin Martyr can be found in Vol. 1; Tertullian, in Volumes 3\u20134; and Origen, in Volume 4.</ref>\n\n[[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]], and other 16th-century reformers wrote long tracts about the End Times, but interest in eschatology dwindled after the Reformation until the late 19th century, when it became popular in the Reformed, Pentecostal, and Evangelical sects. It was increasingly recognized as a formal division of theological study during the 20th century.\n\nThe second coming of Christ is the central event in Christian eschatology. Most Christians believe that death and suffering will continue to exist until Christ's return. Others believe that suffering will gradually be eliminated prior to his coming, and that the elimination of injustice is our part in preparing for that event. Needless to say, there are a variety of viewpoints concerning the order and significance of eschatological events.\n\n===Approaches to interpretation===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\n* The ''[[Preterism|Preterist]]'' approach (from the Latin ''praeteritus'' \"gone by\") seeks parallels between ''Revelation'' and the events of the 1st century, such as [[Herod the Great|Herod]]'s attempt to [[Massacre of the Innocents|kill the infant Christ]], the struggle of Christianity to survive the persecutions of Judaism and the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|fall of Jerusalem]] in 70 AD, the [[Abomination of Desolation|desecration of the temple]] in the same year, and the growth of Christianity from a sect within Judaism to an independent religion.\n* The ''[[Historicism (Christian eschatology)|Historicist]]'' method takes a broader historical approach and seeks parallels between ''Revelation'' and the major people and events of history, especially those which have had a direct effect on [[Israel]] and the Church.\n* The ''[[Futurism (Christian eschatology)|Futurist]]'' method approaches ''Revelation'' as chiefly referring to events that have not yet come to pass but will take place at the end of this age and at the end of the world. The main focus is the return of Christ. \n* The ''[[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|Idealist]]'' model, also known as ''Spiritualist'' or ''Symbolic'' model, approaches the images of ''Revelation'' as symbols representing larger themes and concepts, rather than actual people and events. It sees in Revelation an allegorical representation of the ongoing struggle of the forces of light and darkness, and the ultimate [[triumph of good over evil]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n* [[Biblical law in Christianity]]\n* [[Eastern Orthodox \u2013 Roman Catholic theological differences]]\n* [[Outline of theology]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Berkhof |first=Louis. |title=The History of Christian Doctrine |publisher=Banner of Truth |year=1996 |isbn=0-85151-005-1}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Demarest|first=Bruce A. |title=The Cross and Salvation: The Doctrine of Salvation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0_1wAEACAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Crossway Books|isbn=978-0-89107-937-8}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=|last=Edwards|first=Mark|year=2009|title=Catholicity and Heresy in the Early Church|publisher=Ashgate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9acTl-jAkAC|isbn=9780754662914}}\n* {{cite book |last=Hill |first=Jonathan |year=2003 |title=The History of Christian Thought |isbn=0-7459-5093-0}}\n** Volume 1: ''The Living God'' (1992). {{ISBN|0-06-066363-4}}\n** Volume 2: ''The Word of Life'' (1992). {{ISBN|0-06-066364-2}}\n** Volume 3: ''Life in the Spirit'' (1994). {{ISBN|0-06-066362-6}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kang|first=Paul ChulHong |title=Justification: The Imputation of Christ's Righteousness from Reformation Theology to the American Great Awakening and the Korean Revivals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNIpgIkTMHIC|year=2006|publisher=[[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang]]|isbn=978-0-8204-8605-5|location=New York}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Lange|first=Lyle W. |title=God So Loved the World: A Study of Christian Doctrine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5W0yOQAACAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Northwestern Publishing House|location=Milwaukee|isbn=978-0-8100-1744-3}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Luther|first=Martin |authorlink=Martin Luther|translator-first=Henry |translator-last=Cole|title=Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will: Written in Answer to the Diatribe of Erasmus on Free-will.

One who has experienced such contact is often called a [[prophet]]. Christianity considers the [[Bible]] as divinely or [[Supernatural revelation|supernaturally revealed]] or inspired. Such revelation does not always require the presence of God or an angel. For instance, in the concept called of [[interior locution]] by [[Catholic]]s, supernatural revelation can include just an inner voice heard by the recipient.\n\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] first described two types of revelation in Christianity as [[general revelation]] and [[special revelation]]. General revelation occurs through observation of the created order. Such observations can logically lead to important conclusions, such as the existence of God and some of God's attributes. General revelation is also an element of [[Christian apologetics]]. Certain specifics, such as the [[Trinity]] and the [[Incarnation]], are revealed in the teachings in the Scriptures and can not otherwise be deduced except by special revelation.\n\n===Biblical inspiration===\n{{Main|Biblical inspiration}}\n[[File:The Evangelist Matthew Inspired by an Angel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rembrandt]]'s ''The Evangelist Matthew Inspired by an Angel''.]]\nThe [[Bible]] contains many passages in which the authors claim divine inspiration for their message or report the effects of such inspiration on others. Besides the direct accounts of written [[revelation]], such as [[Moses]] receiving the [[Ten Commandments]], the [[Prophet]]s of the [[Old Testament]] frequently claimed that their message was of divine origin by prefacing the revelation using the following phrase: \"Thus says the LORD\" (for example, [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=IKings+12:22-24;IChronicles+17:3-4;Jeremiah+35:13;Ezekiel+2:4;Zechariah+7:9 1 Kgs 12:22\u201324;1 Chr 17:3\u20134; Jer 35:13; Ezek 2:4; Zech 7:9]; etc.). The [[Second Epistle of Peter]] claims that \"no prophecy of Scripture ... was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit\" ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Peter+1:20-21 2 Pet 1:20\u201321]). The Second Epistle of Peter also implies that Paul's writings are inspired ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Peter+3:16 2 Pet 3:16]).\n\nMany Christians cite a verse in Paul's letter to Timothy, 2 Timothy 3:16\u201317, as evidence that \"all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable ...\" Here St. Paul is referring to the Old Testament, since the scriptures have been known by Timothy from \"infancy\" (verse 15). Others offer an alternative reading for the passage; for example, theologian [[C. H.

For if the Bible were divinely inspired, then the source of inspiration being divine, would not be subject to fallibility or error in that which is produced. For them, the doctrines of the divine inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy, are inseparably tied together. The idea of biblical integrity is a further concept of infallibility, by suggesting that current biblical text is complete and without error, and that the integrity of biblical text has never been corrupted or degraded.<ref name=\"inerrancy\"/> Historians note, or claim, that the doctrine of the Bible's infallibility was adopted hundreds of years after those books were written.\n\n===Biblical canon===\n{{Main|Biblical canon|Christian biblical canons|Development of the Christian biblical canon\n|Development of the New Testament canon}}\n{{See|Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|Development of the Old Testament canon}}\n\nThe content of the [[Protestant Bible|Protestant Old Testament]] is the same as the [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|Hebrew Bible canon]], with changes in the division and order of books, but the [[Catholic Bible|Catholic Old Testament]] contains additional texts, known as the [[deuterocanonical books]]. Protestants recognize 39 books in their Old Testament canon, while Roman Catholic and Eastern Christians recognize 46 books as canonical. Both Catholics and Protestants have the same 27-book New Testament canon.\n\nEarly Christians  used the [[Septuagint]], a [[Koine]] Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures. Christianity subsequently added various writings that would become the New Testament. In the 4th century a series of [[synod]]s, most notably the [[Synod of Hippo]] in AD 393, produced a list of texts equal to the 46 book canon of the Old Testament that Catholics use today (and the 27-book canon of the New Testament that all use). A definitive list did not come from any [[First seven ecumenical councils|early ecumenical council]].<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03274a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Canon of the New Testament]: \"The idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from the beginning, that is from Apostolic times, has no foundation in history.\"</ref> Around 400, [[Jerome]] produced the [[Vulgate]], a definitive Latin edition of the Bible, the contents of which, at the insistence of the Pope, was in accord with the earlier Synods. It can be said that this process effectively set the New Testament canon, although there are examples of other canonical lists in use after this time.\n\nDuring the [[Protestant Reformation]], certain reformers proposed different canonical lists of the Old Testament. The texts that are present in the Septuagint, but not included in the Jewish canon, fell out of favor and, in time, they would come to be removed from Protestant canons. These texts are referred to as deuterocanonical books in Catholic Bibles, whereas in a Protestant context they are referred to as the [[biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]].\n\n==Theology proper: God==\n{{Main|God in Christianity}}\nIn [[Christianity]], God is the [[Creator God|creator and preserver of the universe]]. God is the [[Monotheism|sole]] [[The Ultimate (philosophy)|ultimate]] power in the universe but is distinct from it. The [[Bible]] never speaks of God as impersonal. Instead, it refers to him in [[Personal God|personal terms]]\u2013 who speaks, sees, hears, acts, and loves. God is understood to have a [[will (philosophy)|will]] and personality and is an [[Omnipotent|all powerful]], [[Divinity|divine]] and [[Omnibenevolence|benevolent]] being.

Also, though the [[Angel of the Lord]] spoke to the Patriarchs, revealing God to them, some believe it has always been only through the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit of God]] granting them understanding, that men have been able to perceive later that God himself had visited them.\n\nThis belief gradually developed into the modern formulation of the [[Trinity]], which is the doctrine that God is a single entity ([[Yahweh]]), but that there is a trinity in God's single being, the meaning of which has always been debated. This mysterious \"Trinity\" has been described as [[Hypostasis (religion)|hypostases]] in the [[Greek language]] ([[Consubstantial|subsistences]] in [[Latin]]), and \"persons\" in English. Nonetheless, Christians stress that they only believe in one God.\n\nMost Christian churches teach the Trinity, as opposed to Unitarian monotheistic beliefs. Historically, most Christian churches have taught that the nature of God is a [[Sacred mysteries|mystery]], something that must be revealed by [[special revelation]] rather than deduced through [[general revelation]].\n\nChristian orthodox traditions (Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant) follow this idea, which was codified in 381 and reached its full development through the work of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]]. They consider God to be a [[Wiktionary:triune|triune]] entity, called the Trinity, comprising the three \"Persons\"; [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]], and [[God the Holy Spirit]], described as being \"of the same substance\" ({{lang|grc|[[ousia|\u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2]]}}). The true nature of an infinite God, however, is commonly described as beyond definition, and the word 'person' is an imperfect expression of the idea.\n\nSome critics contend that because of the adoption of a tripartite conception of deity, Christianity is a form of [[tritheism]] or [[polytheism]]. This concept dates from [[Arianism|Arian]] teachings which claimed that Jesus, having appeared later in the Bible than his Father, had to be a secondary, lesser, and therefore distinct god. For [[Jews]] and [[Muslims]], the idea of God as a trinity is [[heresy|heretical]]\u2013 it is considered akin to [[polytheism]]. Christians overwhelmingly assert that monotheism is central to the Christian faith, as the very [[Nicene Creed]] (among others) which gives the orthodox Christian definition of the Trinity does begin with: \"I believe in one God\".\n\nIn the 3rd century, [[Tertullian]] claimed that God exists as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit\u2014the three personae of one and the same substance.<ref name=UCP>''Critical Terms for Religious Studies.'' Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1998.

Since earliest Christianity, one's salvation has been very closely related to the concept of a triune God, although the Trinitarian doctrine was not formalized until the 4th century. At that time, the [[Constantine I and Christianity|Emperor Constantine]] convoked the [[First Council of Nicaea]], to which all bishops of the empire were invited to attend. [[Pope Sylvester I]] did not attend but sent his [[Papal legate|legate]]. The council, among other things, decreed the original Nicene Creed.\n\n====Trinity====\n{{Main|Trinity}}\n[[File:Rublevtrinit\u00e4t ubt.gif|upright|thumb|\"Holy Trinity\" from the Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow, by [[Andrei Rublev]], c. 1400, but more properly known as the \"Hospitality of Abraham.\" The three angels [[Christian symbolism|symbolize]] the Trinity.]]\nFor most Christians, beliefs about God are enshrined in the doctrine of [[Trinitarianism]], which holds that the three persons of God together form a single God. The Trinitarian view emphasizes that God has a will and that [[God the Son]] has two wills, divine and human, though these are never in conflict (see [[Hypostatic union]]). However, this point is disputed by Oriental Orthodox Christians, who hold that ''God the Son'' has only one will of unified divinity and humanity (see [[Miaphysitism]]).\n\nThe Christian doctrine of the Trinity teaches the unity of [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]], and [[Holy Spirit]] as three persons in [[monotheism|one Godhead]].<ref name=\"EB-purgatory\">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9061946/purgatory Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: Purgatory in world religions:] \"The idea of purification or temporary punishment after death has ancient roots and is well-attested in early Christian literature.

With this background, belief in the [[Christology|divinity of Christ]] and the Holy Spirit is expressed as the doctrine of the [[Trinity]],<ref>J.N.D.

The holy three are separate, yet the Son and the Holy Spirit are still seen as originating from God the Father.\n\nThe [[New Testament]] does not have the term \"Trinity\" and nowhere discusses the Trinity as such.

Eck (2003) Encountering God: A Spiritual Journey from Bozeman to Banaras. p. 98</ref> In Christianity, God is called \"Father\" in a more literal sense, besides being the creator and nurturer of creation, and the provider for his children.{{Bibleref2c|Heb|1:2\u20135}} {{Bibleref2c|Gal|4:1\u20137}} The Father is said to be in unique relationship with his only begotten (''monogenes'') son, [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], which implies an exclusive and intimate familiarity: \"No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\"{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|11:27}}\n\nIn Christianity, God the Father's relationship with humanity is as a father to children\u2014in a previously unheard-of sense\u2014and not just as the creator and nurturer of creation, and the provider for his children, his people. Thus, humans, in general, are sometimes called ''children of God''. To Christians, God the Father's relationship with humanity is that of Creator and created beings, and in that respect he is the father of all. The New Testament says, in this sense, that the very idea of family, wherever it appears, derives its name from God the Father,{{Bibleref2c|Eph|3:15}} and thus God himself is the model of the family.\n\nHowever, there is a deeper \"legal\" sense in which Christians believe that they are made participants in the special relationship of Father and Son, through Jesus Christ as his spiritual [[bride of Christ|bride]]. Christians call themselves ''adopted'' children of God.<ref>\"God sent forth His Son... that we might receive the adoption as sons. And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts crying out, \"Abba, Father!\" Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.''.{{bibleref2c|Galatians|4:4\u20137}}</ref>\n\nIn the New Testament, God the Father has a special role in his relationship with the person of the Son, where Jesus is believed to be his Son and his heir.{{bibleref2c|Heb.|1:2\u20135}}. According to the [[Nicene Creed]], the Son (Jesus Christ) is \"eternally begotten of the Father\", indicating that their divine Father-Son relationship is not tied to an event within time or human history. ''See'' [[Christology]]. The Bible refers to Christ, called \"[[Logos (Christianity)|The Word]]\" as present at the beginning of God's creation.{{bibleref2c|John|1:1}}, not a creation himself, but equal in the personhood of the Trinity.\n\nIn [[Eastern Orthodox]] theology, God the Father is the \"principium\" (''beginning''), the \"source\" or \"origin\" of both the Son and the Holy Spirit, which gives intuitive emphasis to the threeness of persons; by comparison, Western theology explains the \"origin\" of all three ''hypostases'' or persons as being in the divine nature, which gives intuitive emphasis to the [[divine simplicity|oneness]] of God's being.{{Citation needed|reason=I think we need a reliable source for the contrasted \"intuitive emphasises\" in Eastern and Western theology|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Christology and Christ===\n{{Main|Christology|Jesus in Christianity|}}\nChristology is the field of study within Christian theology which is primarily concerned with the nature, person, and works of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]], held by Christians to be the [[Son of God]]. Christology is concerned with the meeting of the human ([[Son of Man]]) and divine ([[God the Son]] or [[Logos (Christianity)|Word of God]]) in the person of [[Jesus]].\n\nPrimary considerations include the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], the relationship of Jesus' nature and person with the nature and person of God, and the [[soteriology|salvific]] work of Jesus. As such, Christology is generally less concerned with the details of Jesus' life (what he did) or teaching than with who or what he is. There have been and are various perspectives by those who claim to be his followers since the church began after his ascension. The controversies ultimately focused on whether and how a [[Theological anthropology|human]] nature and a [[divinity|divine]] nature can co-exist in one person. The study of the inter-relationship of these two natures is one of the preoccupations of the majority tradition.\n\nTeachings about Jesus and testimonies about what he accomplished during his three-year public ministry are found throughout the [[New Testament]]. Core biblical teachings about the person of Jesus Christ may be summarized that Jesus Christ was and forever is fully God (divine) and fully human in one sinless person at the same time,<ref name=\"Grudem\">{{cite book |last=Grudem |first=Wayne A. |title=Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine |publisher=Zondervan |year=1994 |isbn=0-310-28670-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/systematictheolo00grud_0 }}</ref> and that through the death and [[resurrection of Jesus]], [[Christian views on sin|sinful]] humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of [[Heaven#In Christianity|eternal life]] via his [[New Covenant]]. While there have been theological disputes over the nature of Jesus, Christians believe that Jesus is [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]] and \"[[Hypostatic union|true God and true man]]\" (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, having become fully human in all respects, suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, yet he did not sin. As fully God, he defeated death and rose to life again. Scripture asserts that Jesus was conceived, by the Holy Spirit, and [[Nativity of Jesus|born]] of his [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|virgin mother Mary]] without a human father.<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|1:18\u201325}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|1:35}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|3:23}}</ref> The biblical accounts of Jesus' ministry include [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]], [[Ministry of Jesus|preaching, teaching, healing]], [[Death of Christ|Death]], and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. The apostle Peter, in what has become a famous proclamation of faith among Christians since the 1st century, said, \"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\"{{bibleref2c|Matt|16:16}} Most Christians now wait for the [[Second Coming]] of Christ when they believe he will fulfill the remaining [[Messianic prophecy|Messianic prophecies]].\n\n====Christ====\nChrist is the English term for the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}} (''Khrist\u00f3s'') meaning \"[[anointing|the anointed one]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Christ |title=Etymology Online: ''Christ'' |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref> It is a translation of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|\u05de\u05b8\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05d7\u05b7}} (''M\u0101\u0161\u00eea\u1e25''), usually [[transliteration|transliterated]] into English as ''[[Messiah]]''. The word is often misunderstood to be the [[surname]] of [[Jesus]] due to the numerous mentions of ''Jesus Christ'' in the Christian [[Bible]]. The word is in fact used as a [[title]], hence its common reciprocal use ''Christ Jesus'', meaning Jesus the Anointed One or Jesus the Messiah. Followers of Jesus became known as [[Christians]] because they believed that Jesus was the Christ, or Messiah, [[prophecy|prophesied]] about in the [[Old Testament]], or [[Tanakh]].\n\n====Trinitarian Ecumenical Councils====\n{{See also|Ecumenical council}}\nThe Christological controversies came to a head over the persons of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]] and their relationship with one another.\nChristology was a fundamental concern from the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) until the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] (680). In this time period, the Christological views of various groups within the broader Christian community led to accusations of [[Christian heresy|heresy]], and, infrequently, subsequent [[religious persecution]]. In some cases, a sect's unique Christology is its chief distinctive feature, in these cases it is common for the sect to be known by the name given to its Christology.\n\nThe decisions made at [[First Council of Nicaea]] and re-ratified at the [[First Council of Constantinople]], after several decades of ongoing controversy during which the work of Athanasius and the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] were influential. The language used was that the one God exists in three persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit); in particular it was affirmed that the Son was ''[[homoousios]]'' (of one substance) with the Father. The [[Nicene Creed|Creed of the Nicene Council]] made statements about the full divinity and full humanity of Jesus, thus preparing the way for discussion about how exactly the divine and human come together in the person of Christ (Christology).\n\nNicaea insisted that Jesus was fully divine and also human. What it did not do was make clear how one person could be both divine and human, and how the divine and human were related within that one person. This led to the Christological controversies of the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th]] and [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th centuries]] of the Christian era.\n\nThe [[Chalcedonian Creed]] did not put an end to all Christological debate, but it did clarify the terms used and became a point of reference for all other Christologies. Most of the major branches of Christianity\u2014[[Roman Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Lutheranism]], and [[Calvinism|Reformed]]\u2014subscribe to the Chalcedonian Christological formulation, while many branches of Eastern Christianity\u2014[[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian Orthodoxy]], [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian Church]], [[Coptic Orthodoxy]], [[Ethiopian Orthodox]]y, and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolicism]]\u2014reject it.\n\n====Attributes of Christ====\n\n=====God as Son=====\n{{Main|God the Son}}\nAccording to the Bible, the second Person of the Trinity, because of his eternal relation to the first Person (God as Father), is the [[Son of God]]. He is considered (by Trinitarians) to be coequal with the Father and Holy Spirit. He is [[Hypostatic union|all God and all human]]: the Son of God as to his divine nature, while as to his human nature he is from the lineage of David.{{Bibleref2c|Rom|1:3\u20134}}<ref>Compare.{{Bibleref2|Galatians|4:4}};{{Bibleref2|Jn|1:1\u201314}};{{Bibleref2-nb|Jn|5:18\u201325}};{{Bibleref2-nb||Jn|10:30\u201338}}</ref> The core of Jesus' self-interpretation was his \"filial consciousness\", his relationship to God as child to parent in some unique sense<ref name=\"Stagg\">Stagg, Frank.

His [[Ministry of Jesus|mission on earth]] proved to be that of enabling people to know God as their Father, which Christians believe is the essence of [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].{{Bibleref2c|Jn|17:3}}\n\nGod the Son is the second person of the [[Trinity]] in Christian theology. The [[doctrine]] of the Trinity identifies [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]] as [[God]] the Son, ''united in essence but distinct in person'' with regard to [[God the Father]] and God the [[Holy Spirit]] (the first and third persons of the Trinity). God the Son is co-eternal with God the Father (and the Holy Spirit), both before Creation and after the End (see [[Eschatology]]). So Jesus was always \"God the Son\", though not [[Revelation|revealed]] as such until he also became ''the'' \"Son of God\" through [[incarnation]]. \"Son of God\" draws attention to his humanity, whereas \"God the Son\" refers more generally to his divinity, including his pre-incarnate existence. So, in Christian theology, Jesus was always God the Son,<ref>\"A brief account of the early Church councils and the Church fathers shows that they adopted the doctrine of the eternal subordination of the Son, and that this doctrine continues in the Church as orthodoxy to this day.\" Stephen D. Kovach and Peter R. Schemm Jr., \"A Defense of the Doctrine of the Eternal Subordination of the Son\", ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]'' '''42''' (1999): 461\u2013476.</ref> though not [[Revelation|revealed]] as such until he also became the [[Son of God]] through [[incarnation]].\n\nThe exact phrase \"God the Son\" is not in the New Testament. Later theological use of this expression reflects what came to be standard interpretation of New Testament references, understood to imply Jesus' divinity, but the distinction of his person from that of the one God he called his Father. As such, the title is associated more with the development of the doctrine of the Trinity than with the [[Christology|Christological]] debates. There are over 40 places in the New Testament where Jesus is given the title \"the Son of God\", but scholars don't consider this to be an equivalent expression. \"God the Son\" is rejected by [[anti-trinitarians]], who view this reversal of the most common term for Christ as a doctrinal perversion and as tending towards [[tritheism]].\n\nMatthew cites Jesus as saying, \"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God (5:9).\" The [[gospel]]s go on to document a great deal of controversy over Jesus being ''the'' Son of God, in a unique way. The book of the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and the letters of the New Testament, however, record the early teaching of the first Christians\u2013 those who believed Jesus to be ''both'' the Son of God, the Messiah, a man appointed by God, as well as God himself. This is evident in many places, however, the early part of the book of Hebrews addresses the issue in a deliberate, sustained argument, citing the scriptures of the Hebrew Bible as authorities. For example, the author quotes Psalm 45:6 as addressed by the God of Israel to Jesus.\n*[[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 1:8. About the Son he says, \"Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever.\"\nThe author of Hebrews' description of Jesus as the exact representation of the divine Father has parallels in a passage in [[Epistle to the Colossians|Colossians]].\n*Colossians 2:9\u201310. \"in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form\"\nJohn's gospel quotes Jesus at length regarding his relationship with his heavenly Father. It also contains two famous attributions of divinity to Jesus.\n*[[Gospel of John|John]] 1:1. \"the Word was God\" [in context, the ''Word'' is Jesus, see [[Christ the Logos]]]\n*[[Gospel of John|John]] 20:28. \"Thomas said to him, 'My Lord and my God!'\"\nThe most direct references to Jesus as God are found in various letters.\n*[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 9:5. \"Christ, who is God over all\"\n*[[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] 2:13. \"our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ\"\n*[[Second Epistle of Peter|2 Peter]] 1:1. \"our God and Savior Jesus Christ\"\nThe biblical basis for later trinitarian statements in creeds is the early baptism formula found in Matthew 28.\n*[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 28:19.

At a very early stage, various Docetic groups arose; in particular, the [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] sects which flourished in the 2nd century AD tended to have Docetic theologies. Docetic teachings were attacked by [[St. Ignatius of Antioch]] (early 2nd century), and appear to be targeted in the canonical [[Epistles of John]] (dates are disputed, but range from the late 1st century among traditionalist scholars to the late 2nd century among critical scholars).\n\nThe Council of Nicaea rejected theologies that entirely ruled out any humanity in Christ, affirming in the [[Nicene Creed]] the doctrine of the [[Incarnation]] as a part of the doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. That is, that the second person of the Trinity became incarnate in the person [[Jesus]] and was fully human.\n\n;Only human?\n{{See also|Jewish Christianity}}\nThe early centuries of Christian history also had groups at the other end of the spectrum, arguing that Jesus was an ordinary mortal. The [[Adoptionists]] taught that Jesus was born fully human, and was adopted as [[Son of God|God's Son]] when [[John the Baptist]] baptised him<ref>{{Bibleverse||Mark|1:10}}</ref> because of the [[Ministry of Jesus|life he lived]]. Another group, known as the [[Ebionites]], taught that Jesus was not God, but the human [[Moshiach]] (messiah, anointed) prophet promised in the [[Hebrew Bible]].\n\nSome of these views could be described as [[Unitarianism]] (although that is a modern term) in their insistence on the oneness of God. These views, which directly affected how one understood the Godhead, were declared [[heresies]] by the Council of Nicaea. Throughout much of the rest of the ancient history of Christianity, Christologies that denied Christ's divinity ceased to have a major impact on the life of the church.\n\n;How can he be both?\n:;What sort of divinity?\n{{Main|Arianism}}\n\n[[Arianism]] affirmed that Jesus was divine, but taught that he was nevertheless a created being (''there was [a time] when he was not [in existence]''), and was therefore less divine than God the Father. The matter boiled down to one iota; Arianism taught ''[[Homoiousia|Homo'''i'''ousia]]''\u2014the belief that Jesus's divinity is ''similar'' to that of God the Father\u2014as opposed to ''[[Homoousia]]''\u2014the belief that Jesus's divinity is the ''same'' as that of God the Father. [[Arius]]' opponents additionally included in the term ''Arianism'' the belief that Jesus' divinity is ''different'' from that of God the Father (''Heteroousia'').\n\nArianism was condemned by the Council of Nicea, but remained popular in the northern and western provinces of the empire, and continued to be the majority view of western Europe well into the 6th century. Indeed, even the Christian legend of Constantine's death-bed baptism involves a bishop who, in recorded history, was an Arian.\n\nIn the modern era, a number of denominations have rejected the Nicene doctrine of the Trinity, including the [[Christadelphians]] and the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Bruce Milne|title=Know the Truth|publisher=Inter-Varsity Press|pages=181\u2013182|isbn=0-8308-1793-X|date=17 February 1999}}</ref>\n\n;What sort of amalgamation?\nThe Christological debates following the Council of Nicaea sought to make sense of the interplay of the human and divine in the person of Christ while upholding the doctrine of the Trinity. [[Apollinaris of Laodicea]] (310\u2013390) taught that in Jesus, the divine component took the place of the human ''[[nous]]'' (''thinking''\u2013 not to be confused with ''[[thelis]]'', meaning ''intent''). This however was seen as a denial of Jesus' true humanity, and the view was condemned at the [[First Council of Constantinople]].\n\nSubsequently, [[Nestorius]] of Constantinople (386\u2013451) initiated a view that effectively separated Jesus into two persons\u2014one divine and one human; the mechanism of this combination is known as ''hypostas'''e'''s'', and contrasts with ''hypostas'''i'''s''\u2014the view that there is no separation. Nestorius' theology was deemed heretical at the [[First Council of Ephesus]] (431). Though, as seen by the writings of [[Babai the Great]], the Christology of the [[Church of the East]] is highly similar to that of Chalcedon, many orthodox Christians (particularly in the West) consider this group to be the perpetuation of [[Nestorianism]]; the modern Assyrian Church of the East has at times shunned this term, as it implies acceptance of the entire theology of Nestorius.\n\nVarious forms of [[Monophysitism]] taught that Christ only had one nature: that the divine had either dissolved ([[Eutychianism]]), or that the divine joined with the human as one nature in the person of Christ ([[Miaphysitism]]). A notable monophysite theologian was [[Eutyches]] (c. 380\u2013456). [[Monophysitism]] was rejected as [[Christian heresy|heresy]] at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, which affirmed that Jesus Christ had two natures (divine and human) joined in one person, in [[hypostatic union]] (see [[Chalcedonian creed]]). While Eutychianism was suppressed into oblivion by the Chalcedonians and Miaphysites, the Miaphysite groups who dissented from the Chalcedonian formula have persisted as the [[Oriental Orthodox Church]].\n\nAs theologians continued to search for a compromise between the Chalcedonian definition and the [[Monophysites]], other Christologies developed that partially rejected the full humanity of Christ. [[Monothelitism]] taught that in the one person of Jesus there were two natures, but only a divine will. Closely related to this is [[Monoenergism]], which held to the same doctrine as the Monothelites, but with different terminology. These positions were declared [[Christian heresy|heresy]] by the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] (the Sixth [[Ecumenical Council]], 680\u2013681).\n\n=====Incarnation=====\n{{Main|Incarnation (Christianity)}}\nThe Incarnation is the belief in [[Christianity]] that the second person in the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Christian Godhead]], also known as [[God the Son]] or the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] (Word), \"became flesh\" when he was miraculously conceived in the womb of the [[Virgin Mary]]. The word Incarnate derives from [[Latin]] (in=in or into, caro, carnis=flesh) meaning \"to make into flesh\" or \"to become flesh\". The incarnation is a fundamental [[theology|theological]] teaching of [[Nicene Creed|orthodox (Nicene) Christianity]], based on its understanding of the [[New Testament]]. The incarnation represents the belief that Jesus, who is the non-created second [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] of the [[trinity|triune God]], took on a human body and nature and became [[Hypostatic union|both man and God]]. In the [[Bible]] its clearest teaching is in {{Bibleref2|John|1:14}}: \"And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us.\"<ref>McKim, Donald K. 1996. ''Westminster dictionary of theological terms''.

Alternative views on the subject (See [[Ebionites]] and the [[Gospel of the Hebrews|Gospel according to the Hebrews]]) have been proposed throughout the centuries (see below), but all were rejected by [[Mainstream Christianity|mainstream Christian bodies]].\n\nIn recent decades, an alternative doctrine known as \"[[Oneness Pentecostalism (doctrine)|Oneness]]\" has been espoused among various [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] groups (see below), but has been rejected by the remainder of [[Christendom]].\n\n;Description and development of the traditional doctrine\nIn the [[Early Christianity|early Christian era]], there was considerable disagreement amongst Christians regarding the nature of Christ's Incarnation. While all Christians believed that Jesus was indeed the [[Son of God]], the exact nature of his Sonship was contested, together with the precise relationship of the \"[[God the Father|Father]],\" \"Son\" and \"[[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]]\" referred to in the New Testament. Though Jesus was clearly the \"Son,\" what exactly did this mean? Debate on this subject raged most especially during the first four centuries of Christianity, involving [[Jewish Christians]], [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]], followers of the Presbyter [[Arius]] of Alexandra, and adherents of [[Athanasius of Alexandria|St. Athanasius the Great]], among others.\n\nEventually, the Christian Church accepted the teaching of St. Athanasius and his allies, that Christ was the incarnation of the eternal second person of the [[Trinity]], who was fully God and fully a man simultaneously. All divergent beliefs were defined as [[heresy|heresies]]. This included [[Docetism]], which said that Jesus was a divine being that took on human appearance but not flesh; [[Arianism]], which held that Christ was a created being; and [[Nestorianism]], which maintained that the Son of God and the man, Jesus, shared the same body but retained [[Two Natures of Christ|two separate natures]]. The [[Oneness Pentecostalism|Oneness]] belief held by certain modern [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] churches is also seen as heretical by most mainstream Christian bodies.\n\nThe most widely accepted the early Christian Church made definitions of the Incarnation and the nature of Jesus at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431, and the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451. These councils declared that Jesus was both fully God: begotten from, but not created by the Father; and fully man: taking his flesh and human nature from the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]. These two natures, human and divine, were [[hypostatic union|hypostatically]] united into the one personhood of Jesus Christ.<ref>* [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.toc.html The Seven Ecumenical Councils], from the ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', vols. 2\u201314 (CCEL.org) Contains detailed statements from each of these councils. The First Council of Nicaea, Council of Ephesus and Council of Chalcedon are the \"First,\" \"Third\" and \"Fourth\" Ecumenical Councils, respectively.</ref>\n\n;Fortuitous and Necessary Incarnation\nThe link between the Incarnation and the [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]] within systematic theological thought is complex. Within traditional models of the Atonement, such as [[Penal substitution|Substitution]], [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|Satisfaction]] or [[Christus Victor]], Christ must be Divine in order for the Sacrifice of the Cross to be efficacious, for human sins to be \"removed\" or \"conquered\". In his work ''The Trinity and the Kingdom of God'', [[J\u00fcrgen Moltmann|Jurgen Moltmann]] differentiated between what he called a \"fortuitous\" and a \"necessary\" Incarnation. The latter gives a soteriological emphasis to the Incarnation: the Son of God became a man so that he could save us from our sins. The former, on the other hand, speaks of the Incarnation as a fulfilment of the [[Love of God]], of his desire to be present and living amidst humanity, to \"walk in the garden\" with us.\n\nMoltmann favours \"fortuitous\" incarnation primarily because he feels that to speak of an incarnation of \"necessity\" is to do an injustice to the [[Ministry of Jesus|life of Christ]]. Moltmann's work, alongside other systematic theologians, opens up avenues of liberation [[Christology]].\n\n=====Hypostatic union=====\n{{Main|Hypostatic union|Chalcedonian}}\n[[File:Vladimirskaya.jpg|thumb|upright|A depiction of Jesus and Mary, the [[Theotokos]] [[Theotokos of Vladimir|of Vladimir]] (12th century)]]\nIn short, this doctrine states that two natures, one human and one divine, are united in the one person of Christ. The Council further taught that each of these natures, the human and the divine, was distinct and complete. This view is sometimes called [[Dyophysite]] (meaning two natures) by those who rejected it.\n\nHypostatic union (from the Greek for substance) is a technical term in Christian theology employed in mainstream [[Christology]] to describe the union of two natures, humanity and divinity, in Jesus Christ. A brief definition of the doctrine of two natures can be given as: \"Jesus Christ, who is identical with the Son, is one person and one hypostasis in two natures: a human and a divine.\"<ref>Martin Lembke, lecture in the course \"Meetings with the World's Religions\", Centre for Theology and Religious Studies, Lund University, Spring Term 2010.</ref>\n\nThe [[First Council of Ephesus]] recognised this doctrine and affirmed its importance, stating that the humanity and divinity of Christ are made one according to nature and hypostasis in the [[Logos]].\n\nThe [[First Council of Nicaea]] declared that the Father and the Son are of the same substance and are co-eternal. This belief was expressed in the Nicene Creed.\n\n[[Apollinaris of Laodicea]] was the first to use the term hypostasis in trying to understand the [[Incarnation]].<ref>Gregory of Nyssa, ''Antirrheticus adversus Apollinarem.''</ref> Apollinaris described the union of the divine and human in Christ as being of a single nature and having a single essence\u2013 a single hypostasis.\n\nThe [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] went in the other direction, arguing that in Christ there were two natures ([[dyophysite]]) (human and divine) and two hypostases (in the sense of \"essence\" or \"person\") that co-existed.<ref>\"Theodore\" in ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian History'', ed. J. Brauer. Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1971.</ref>\n\nThe [[Chalcedonian Creed]] agreed with Theodore that there were two natures in the [[Incarnation]]. However, the [[Council of Chalcedon]] also insisted that hypostasis be used as it was in the Trinitarian definition: to indicate the person and not the nature as with Apollinarius.\n\nThus, the Council declared that in Christ there are two natures; each retaining its own properties, and together united in one subsistence and in one single person.<ref>[[Denzinger]], ed. Bannwart, 148</ref>\n\nAs the precise nature of this union is held to defy finite human comprehension, the hypostatic union is also referred to by the alternative term \"mystical union.\"\n\nThe [[Oriental Orthodox Church]]es, having rejected the Chalcedonian Creed, were known as [[Monophysites]] because they would only accept a definition that characterized the incarnate Son as having one nature. The [[Chalcedonian]] \"in two natures\" formula was seen as derived from and akin to a [[Nestorian doctrine|Nestorian]] Christology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishorthodox.org/113e.php |title=The Oriental Orthodox Rejection of Chalcedon |accessdate=5 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619122112/http://www.britishorthodox.org/113e.php |archivedate=19 June 2008 }}</ref> Contrariwise, the Chalcedonians saw the Oriental Orthodox as tending towards [[Eutychianism|Eutychian]] Monophysitism. However, the Oriental Orthodox have in modern ecumenical dialogue specified that they have never believed in the doctrines of Eutyches, that they have always affirmed that Christ's humanity is consubstantial with our own, and they thus prefer the term \"Miaphysite\" to refer to themselves (a reference to Cyrillian Christology, which used the phrase \"mia physis tou theou logou sesarkomene\").\n\nIn recent times, leaders from the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches have signed joint statements in an attempt to work towards reunification.\n\n=====Other Christological concerns=====\n;The sinlessness of Christ\n{{main|Impeccability}}\nAlthough Christian orthodoxy holds that Jesus was fully human, the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], for example, states that Christ was 'holy and without evil' (7:26). The question concerning the sinlessness of Jesus Christ focuses on this seeming paradox. Does being fully human require that one participate in [[Fall of man|the \"fall\" of Adam]], or could Jesus exist in an \"unfallen\" status as [[Adam and Eve]] did before the \"fall,\" according to Genesis 2\u20133?\n\n;Kinds of sinlessness\nEvangelical writer [[Donald Macleod (theologian)|Donald Macleod]] suggests that the sinless nature of Jesus Christ involves two elements. \"First, Christ was free of actual sin.\"<ref name=\"macleod220\">[[Donald Macleod (theologian)|Donald Macleod]], ''The Person of Christ'' ([[InterVarsity Press]], 1998), 220.</ref> Studying the gospels there is no reference to Jesus praying for the forgiveness of sin, nor confessing sin. The assertion is that Jesus did not commit sin, nor could he be proven guilty of sin; he had no vices. In fact, he is quoted as asking, \"Can any of you prove me guilty of sin?\" in John 8:46. \"Secondly, he was free from inherent sin (\"[[original sin]]\" or \"[[ancestral sin]]\").\"<ref name=\"macleod220\" />\n\n;Temptation of Christ\n'''The temptation of Christ''' shown in the gospels affirms that he was tempted. Indeed, the temptations were genuine and of a greater intensity than normally experienced by human beings.<ref>NRSV; Matthew 4.1\u201311.</ref> He experienced all the frail weaknesses of humanity. Jesus was tempted through hunger and thirst, pain and the love of his friends. Thus, the human weaknesses could engender temptation.<ref name=\"macleod226\">Macleod 1998, p. 226</ref> Nevertheless, MacLeod notes that \"one crucial respect in which Christ was not like us is that he was not tempted by anything within himself.\"<ref name=\"macleod226\" />\n\nThe temptations Christ faced focused upon his person and identity as the incarnate Son of God. MacLeod writes, \"Christ could be tempted through his sonship.\" The temptation in the wilderness and again in Gethsemane exemplifies this '''arena of temptation'''. Regarding the temptation of performing a sign that would affirm his sonship by throwing himself from the pinnacle of the temple, MacLeod observes, \"The sign was for himself: a temptation to seek reassurance, as if to say, \u2018the real question is my own sonship. I must forget all else and all others and all further service until that is clear.\u2019\"<ref name=\"macleod227\">Macleod 1998, p. 227</ref> MacLeod places this struggle in the context of the incarnation, \"...he has become a man and must accept not only the appearance but the reality.\"<ref name=\"macleod227\" />\n\n;Communication of attributes\nThe communion of attributes (''[[Communicatio idiomatum]]'') of Christ's divine and human natures is understood according to Chalcedonian theology to mean that they exist together with neither overriding the other. That is, both are preserved and coexist in one person. Christ had '''all''' the properties of God and humanity. God did not stop being God and become man. Christ was not half-God and half-human. The two natures did not mix into a new third kind of nature. Although independent, they acted in complete accord; when one nature acted, so did the other. The natures did not commingle, merge, infuse each other, or replace each other. One was not converted into the other. They remained distinct (yet acted with one accord).\n\n;Virgin Birth\n{{Main|Virgin Birth of Jesus}}\n\n[[File:Holy Doors.jpg|thumb|upright|Holy Doors from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], Mount Sinai, depicting the [[Annunciation]], c. 12th century]]\nThe Gospel according to Matthew and Gospel according to Luke suggest a virgin birth of Jesus Christ. Some now disregard or even argue against this \"doctrine\" to which most [[Christian denomination|denominations]] of Christianity ascribe. This section looks at the Christological issues surrounding belief or disbelief in the virgin birth.\n\nA non-virgin birth would seem to require some form of [[adoptionism]]. This is because a human conception and birth would seem to yield a fully human Jesus, with some other mechanism required to make Jesus divine as well.\n\nA non-virgin birth would seem to support the full humanity of Jesus. William Barclay: states, \"The supreme problem of the virgin birth is that it does quite undeniably differentiate Jesus from all men; it does leave us with an incomplete incarnation.\"<ref>Barclay 1967, p. 81</ref>\n\nBarth speaks of the virgin birth as the divine sign \"which accompanies and indicates the mystery of the incarnation of the Son.\"<ref>Barth 1956, p. 207</ref>\n\nDonald MacLeod<ref>MacLeod 1998, pp. 37\u201341</ref> gives several Christological implications of a virgin birth:\n* Highlights salvation as a [[supernatural]] act of God rather than an act of human initiative.\n* Avoids [[adoptionism]] (which is virtually required if a normal birth).\n* Reinforces the sinlessness of Christ, especially as it relates to Christ being outside the sin of Adam ([[original sin]]).\n\n;Relationship of Persons\nThe discussion of whether the three distinct persons in the Godhead of the Trinity were of greater, equal, or lesser by comparison was also, like many other areas of early Christology, a subject of debate. In [[Athenagoras of Athens]] (c. 133\u2013190) writings we find a very developed trinitarian doctrine.<ref name=Kesich2007>{{Cite book| last = Kesich | first = Veselin| year = 2007| title = Formation and struggles : the church, A.D. 33\u2013450| page = 159| url = https://books.google.com/?id=vc0wBCU70NwC&pg=RA1-PA154&dq=Justin+Martyr+christology| isbn = 978-0-88141-319-9| publisher = St. Vladimir's Seminary Press| location = Crestwood, N.Y.| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/athenagoras-plea.html |title=Athenagoras of Athens: A Plea for the Christians |publisher=Earlychristianwritings.com |date=2 February 2006 |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref> On the one end of the spectrum was [[modalism]], a doctrine stating that the three persons of the Trinity were equal to the point of erasing their differences and distinctions. On the other end of the spectrum were [[tritheism]] as well as some radically [[subordinationist]] views, the latter of which emphasized the primacy of the Father of Creation to the deity of Christ and Jesus's authority over the Holy Spirit. During the Council of Nicea, the modalist bishops of Rome and Alexandria aligned politically with Athanasius; whereas the bishops of Constantinople (Nicomedia), Antioch, and Jerusalem sided with the subordinationists as middle ground between Arius and Athanasius.\n\n====Approaches to Christology====\nTheologians like [[Jurgen Moltmann]] and Walter Kasper have characterized Christologies as anthropological or cosmological. These are also termed 'Christology from below' and 'Christology from above' respectively. An anthropological Christology starts with the human person of Jesus and works from his life and ministry toward what it means for him to be divine; whereas, a cosmological Christology works in the opposite direction. Starting from the eternal Logos, a cosmological Christology works toward his humanity. Theologians typically begin on one side or the other and their choice inevitably colors their resultant Christology. As a starting point these options represent \"diverse yet complementary\" approaches; each poses its own difficulties. Both Christologies 'from above' and 'from below' must come to terms with the two natures of Christ: human and divine. Just as light can be perceived as a wave or as a particle, so Jesus must be thought in terms of both his divinity and humanity. You cannot talk about \"either or\" but must talk about \"both and\".<ref name=\"Greene\">{{Cite book |first = Colin J.

Jesus' unity with God is established by the Incarnation as the divine Logos assumes a human nature. This approach was common in the early church\u2014e.g., St. Paul and St. John in the Gospels. The attribution of full humanity to Jesus is resolved by stating that the two natures mutually share their properties (a concept termed ''[[communicatio idiomatum]]'').<ref>[[#Greene|Greene]], pp. 31\u201343, 324</ref>\n\n;Anthropological approaches\nChristologies from below start with the human being Jesus as the representative of the new humanity, not with the pre-existent Logos. Jesus lives an exemplary life, one to which we aspire in religious experience. This form of Christology lends itself to mysticism, and some of its roots go back to emergence of Christ mysticism in the 6th century East, but in the West it flourished between the 11th and 14th centuries. A recent theologian Wolfhart Pannenberg contends that the resurrected Jesus is the \"eschatological fulfillment of human destiny to live in nearness to God.\"<ref>[[#Greene|Greene]], pp. 43\u201351</ref>\n\n;Political approaches\nThe Christian faith is inherently political because allegiance to Jesus as risen Lord relativises all earthly rule and authority. Jesus is called \"Lord\" over 230 times in Paul's epistles alone, and is thus the principal confession of faith in the Pauline epistles. Further, N.T. Wright argues that this Pauline confession is the core of the gospel of salvation. The Achilles' heel of this approach is the loss of eschatological tension between this present age and the future divine rule that is yet to come. This can happen when the state co-opts Christ's authority as was often the case in imperial Christology. Modern political Christologies seek to overcome imperialist ideologies.<ref>[[#Greene|Greene]], pp. 51\u201371, 325</ref>\n\n====Works of Christ====\n;Resurrection of Jesus\n{{Main|Crucifixion of Jesus|Resurrection of Jesus}}\n[[File:TheResurrectionOfChrist.jpg|thumb|upright|The Resurrection of Christ by [[Carl Heinrich Bloch]], 1875.]]\nThe resurrection is perhaps the most controversial aspect of the life of Jesus Christ. Christianity hinges on this point of Christology, both as a response to a particular history and as a confessional response.<ref>[[Reginald H. Fuller#The Foundations of New Testament Christology|Fuller 1965, p. 15]]</ref> Some Christians claim that because he was resurrected, the future of the world was forever altered. Most Christians believe that Jesus\u2019 resurrection brings reconciliation with God (II Corinthians 5:18), the destruction of death (I Corinthians 15:26), and forgiveness of sins for followers of Jesus Christ.\n\nAfter Jesus had died, and was buried, the [[New Testament]] states that he appeared to others in bodily form. Some skeptics say his appearances were only perceived by his followers in mind or spirit. The gospels state that the disciples believed they witnessed Jesus\u2019 resurrected body and that led to the beginning of the faith. They had previously hid in fear of persecution after Jesus\u2019 death. After seeing Jesus they boldly proclaimed the message of Jesus Christ despite tremendous risk. They obeyed Jesus\u2019 mandate to be reconciled to God through repentance (Luke 24:47), baptism, and obedience (Matthew 28:19\u201320).\n\n;Offices as Prophet, Priest, and King\nJesus Christ, the Mediator of humankind, fulfills the [[Threefold Office|three offices of Prophet, Priest, and King]].

The Holy Spirit dwells inside every Christian, each one's body being his temple.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|3:16||1 Cor 3:16}} Jesus described the Holy Spirit{{bibleref2c|Jn|14:26}} as ''[[Paraclete|paracletus]]'' in [[Latin]], derived from [[Greek language|Greek]].

The Holy Spirit's action in one's life is believed to produce positive results, known as the [[Fruit of the Holy Spirit]]. The Holy Spirit enables Christians, who still experience the effects of sin, to do things they never could do on their own. These spiritual gifts are not innate abilities \"unlocked\" by the Holy Spirit, but entirely new abilities, such as the ability to cast out [[demon]]s or simply bold speech. Through the influence of the Holy Spirit a person sees more clearly the world around him or her and can use his or her mind and body in ways that exceed his or her previous capacity. A list of gifts that may be bestowed include the [[charism]]atic gifts of [[prophecy]], [[glossolalia|tongues]], healing, and knowledge. Christians holding a view known as [[cessationism]] believe these gifts were given only in New Testament times. Christians almost universally agree that certain \"[[spiritual gift]]s\" are still in effect today, including the gifts of ministry, teaching, giving, leadership, and mercy.{{Bibleref2c|Rom|12:6\u20138|}} The experience of the Holy Spirit is sometimes referred to as being [[anointing|anointed]].\n\nAfter his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], Christ told his disciples that they would be \"[[baptism|baptized]] with the Holy Spirit\" and would receive power from this event,{{bibleref2c|Ac|1:4\u20138}} a promise that was fulfilled in the events recounted in the second chapter of Acts. On the first [[Pentecost]], Jesus' disciples were gathered in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] when a mighty wind was heard and tongues of fire appeared over their heads. A multilingual crowd heard the disciples speaking, and each of them heard them speaking in his or her native [[language]].\n\nThe Holy Spirit is believed to perform specific divine functions in the life of the Christian or the church. These include:\n*'''Conviction of [[sin]]'''. The Holy Spirit acts to convince the unredeemed person both of the sinfulness of their actions, and of their moral standing as sinners before God.<ref>''The Holy Spirit and His Gifts''. [[J.

These gifts consist of specific abilities granted to the individual Christian.<ref name=Erickson265/> They are frequently known by the Greek word for gift, ''Charisma'', from which the term [[charismatic]] derives. The New Testament provides three different lists of such gifts which range from the supernatural (healing, prophecy, [[glossolalia|tongues]]) through those associated with specific callings (teaching) to those expected of all Christians in some degree (faith). Most consider these lists not to be exhaustive, and other have compiled their own lists. Saint [[Ambrose]] wrote of the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit poured out on a believer at baptism: 1. Spirit of Wisdom; 2. Spirit of Understanding; 3. Spirit of Counsel; 4. Spirit of Strength; 5. Spirit of Knowledge; 6. Spirit of Godliness; 7. Spirit of [[Fear of God (religion)|Holy Fear]].<ref>De Sacramentis 3.8.</ref>\n\nIt is over the nature and occurrence of these gifts, particularly the supernatural gifts (sometimes called charismatic gifts), that the greatest disagreement between Christians with regard to the Holy Spirit exists.\n\nOne view is that the supernatural gifts were a special dispensation for the apostolic ages, bestowed because of the unique conditions of the church at that time, and are extremely rarely bestowed in the present time.<ref name=EricksonWorks>{{Cite book| author = Millard J. Erickson | year = 1992 | title = Introducing Christian Doctrine. | publisher = Baker Book House | pages = 265\u2013275| isbn = 0-8010-3215-6}}</ref> This is the view of the Catholic Church<ref name=cathhs/> and many other mainstream Christian groups. The alternate view, espoused mainly by Pentecostal denominations and the charismatic movement, is that the absence of the supernatural gifts was due to the neglect of the Holy Spirit and his work by the church. Although some small groups, such as the ''[[Montanists]]'', practiced the supernatural gifts they were rare until the growth of the [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] movement in the late 19th century.<ref name=EricksonWorks/>\n\nBelievers in the relevance of the supernatural gifts sometimes speak of a ''Baptism of the Holy Spirit'' or ''Filling of the Holy Spirit'' which the Christian needs to experience in order to receive those gifts. Many churches hold that the ''Baptism of the Holy Spirit'' is identical with conversion, and that all Christians are by definition baptized in the Holy Spirit.<ref name=EricksonWorks/>\n\n==Cosmology: Things created==\n{{Main|Christian cosmology}}\n{{rquote|right| And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\n<small>[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1: 3\u20135</small>}}\n\nThe various [[authors of the Bible|authors]] of the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]] provide glimpses of their insight regarding [[Religious cosmology|cosmology]]. The [[cosmos]] was created by God by divine command, in the best-known and most complete account in the Bible, that of Genesis 1.\n\n===World===\n{{See also|Creator deity|Creationism}}\nWithin this broad understanding, however, there are a number of views regarding exactly how this doctrine ought to be interpreted.\n* Some Christians, particularly [[Young Earth creationism|Young]] and [[Old Earth creationism|Old Earth creationists]], interpret Genesis as an accurate and literal account of creation.\n* Others may understand these to be, instead, spiritual insights more vaguely defined.\n\nIt is a tenet of Christian faith (Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant) that God is the creator of all things [[ex nihilo|from nothing]], and has made human beings in the [[Image of God]], who by direct inference is also the source of the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]. In [[Chalcedonian]] [[Christology]], [[Jesus the Logos|Jesus is the Word of God]], which was in the beginning and, thus, is uncreated, and hence [[God the Son|is God]], and consequently identical with the Creator of the world ''[[ex nihilo]]''.\n\n[[Roman Catholicism]] uses the phrase special creation to refer to the doctrine of immediate or special creation of each human soul. In 2004, the International Theological Commission, then under the presidency of Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]], published a paper in which it accepts the current scientific accounts of the history of the universe commencing in the Big Bang about 15 billion years ago and of the evolution of all life on earth including humans from the micro organisms commencing about 4 billion years ago.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20040723_communion-stewardship_en.html Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621050711/https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20040723_communion-stewardship_en.html |date=21 June 2014 }},(23 July 2004), International Theological Commission, La Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica 2004, IV, 254\u2013286</ref> The [[Roman Catholic Church]] allows for both a [[literal interpretation|literal]] and [[Allegorical interpretation of the Bible|allegorical interpretation]] of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], so as to allow for the possibility of Creation by means of an [[Evolution|evolutionary process]] over great spans of time, otherwise known as [[theistic evolution]].{{Dubious|date=September 2010}} It believes that the creation of the world is a work of God through the ''[[Logos]]'', the Word (idea, intelligence, reason and logic):\n:\"In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God...all things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made.\"\n\nThe New Testament claims that God created everything by the eternal Word, Jesus Christ his beloved Son.

This [[theological anthropology]] refers to the study of the human (\"anthropology\") as it relates to [[God]]. It differs from the [[social science]] of [[anthropology]], which primarily deals with the comparative study of the physical and social characteristics of humanity across times and places.\n\nOne aspect studies the innate nature or constitution of the human, known as the ''nature of mankind''. It is concerned with the relationship between notions such as [[Human body|body]], [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and [[spirit]] which together form a person, based on their descriptions in the [[Bible]]. There are three traditional views of the human constitution\u2013 [[trichotomism]], [[dichotomism]] and [[monism]] (in the sense of anthropology).<ref>[[Millard Erickson]], ''Christian Theology'' 2nd edn, 537</ref>\n\n====Components====\n;Soul\n{{See also|soul|nephesh|psyche (psychology)|Spirit|Human body|Flesh}}\nThe semantic domain of [[Bible|Biblical]] soul is based on the [[Hebrew]] word ''[[nephesh|nepes]]'', which presumably means \"breath\" or \"breathing being\".<ref>''Hebrew\u2013English Lexicon,'' Brown, Driver & Briggs, Hendrickson Publishers.</ref> This word never means an immortal soul<ref>''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology.''</ref> or an incorporeal part of the human being<ref>''Dictionary of Biblical Theology,'' Father Xavier Leon Dufour, 1985.</ref> that can survive death of the body as the spirit of dead.<ref>''New International Dictionary''.</ref> This word usually designates the person as a whole<ref>New Dictionary of Biblical Theology</ref> or its physical life. In the [[Septuagint]] ''nepes'' is mostly translated as ''psyche'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae|\u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae]]}}) and, exceptionally, in the [[Book of Joshua]] as ''empneon'' (\u1f14\u03bc\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd), that is \"breathing being\".<ref>\"A careful examination of the biblical material, particularly the words nefesh, neshama, and rua\u1e25, which are often too broadly translated as \"soul\" and \"spirit,\" indicates that these must not be understood as referring to the psychical side of a psychophysical pair. A man did not possess a nefesh but rather was a nefesh, as Gen. 2:7 says: \"wayehi ha-adam le-nefesh \u1e25ayya\" (\". . . and the man became a living being\"). Man was, for most of the biblical writers, what has been called \"a unit of vital power,\" not a dual creature separable into two distinct parts of unequal importance and value. While this understanding of the nature of man dominated biblical thought, in apocalyptic literature (2nd century BC\u20132nd century AD) the term nefesh began to be viewed as a separable psychical entity with existence apart from body.... The biblical view of man as an inseparable psychosomatic unit meant that death was understood to be his dissolution.\"\u2014Britannica, 2004.</ref>\n\nThe [[New Testament]] follows the terminology of the [[Septuagint]], and thus uses the word ''psyche'' with the Hebrew semantic domain and not the Greek,<ref>''Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament''</ref> that is an invisible power (or ever more, for [[Plato]]nists, immortal and immaterial) that gives life and motion to the body and is responsible for its attributes.\n\nIn [[Patristic]] thought, towards the end of the 2nd century ''psyche'' was understood in more a Greek than a Hebrew way, and it was contrasted with the body. In the 3rd century, with the influence of [[Origen]], there was the establishing of the doctrine of the inherent immortality of the soul and its divine nature.<ref>The early Hebrews apparently had a concept of the soul but did not separate it from the body, although later Jewish writers developed the idea of the soul further. Old Testament references to the soul are related to the concept of breath and establish no distinction between the ethereal soul and the corporeal body. Christian concepts of a body-soul dichotomy originated with the ancient Greeks andwere introduced into Christian theology at an early date by St. Gregory of Nyssa and by St. Augustine.\u2014''Britannica,'' 2004</ref> Origen also taught the [[Reincarnation|transmigration]] of the souls and their preexistence, but these views were officially rejected in 553 in the [[Fifth Ecumenical Council]]. Inherent immortality of the soul was accepted among western and eastern theologians throughout the [[middle ages]], and after the Reformation, as evidenced by the [[Westminster Confession]].\n\n;Spirit\nThe spirit (Hebrew ''ruach'', Greek {{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1|\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1]]}}, ''pneuma'', which can also mean \"breath\") is likewise an immaterial component. It is often used interchangeably with \"soul\", ''psyche'', although trichotomists believe that the spirit is distinct from the soul.\n\n:\"When Paul speaks of the ''pneuma'' of man he does not mean some higher principle within him or some special intellectual or spiritual faculty of his, but simply his self, and the only questions is whether the self is regarded in some particular aspect when it is called ''pneuma''. In the first place, it apparently is regarded in the same way as when it is called ''psyche''\u2013 viz. as the self that lives in man's attitude, in the orientation of his will.\"<ref>Bultmann, I:206</ref>\n\n;Body, Flesh\nThe body (Greek {{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c3\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1|\u03c3\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1]]}} ''soma'') is the corporeal or physical aspect of a human being. Christians have traditionally believed that the body will be [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrected]] at the end of the age.\n\nFlesh (Greek {{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03be|\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03be]]}}, ''sarx'') is usually considered synonymous with \"body\", referring to the corporeal aspect of a human being. The [[apostle Paul]] contrasts flesh and spirit in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 7\u20138.\n\n====Origin of humanity====\n{{See also|Creationism|Theistic evolution|Image of God}}\nThe [[Bible]] teaches in the book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] the humans were created by God. Some Christians believe that this must have involved a miraculous creative act, while others are comfortable with the idea that God worked through the [[evolution]]ary process.\n\nThe book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] also teaches that human beings, male and female, were created in the image of God. The exact meaning of this has been debated throughout church history.\n\n====Death and afterlife====\n{{See also|Afterlife }}\nChristian anthropology has implications for beliefs about [[death]] and the [[afterlife]]. The Christian church has traditionally taught that the soul of each individual separates from the body at death, to be reunited at the [[resurrection of the dead|resurrection]]. This is closely related to the doctrine of the [[immortality of the soul]]. For example, the [[Westminster Confession]] (chapter XXXII) states:\n:\"The bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see corruption: but their souls, which neither die nor sleep, having an immortal subsistence, immediately return to God who gave them\"\n\n;Intermediate state\n{{Main|Intermediate state}}\nThe question then arises: where exactly does the disembodied soul \"go\" at death? Theologians refer to this subject as the [[intermediate state]]. The [[Old Testament]] speaks of a place called ''[[sheol]]'' where the spirits of the dead reside. In the [[New Testament]], ''[[hades]]'', the classical Greek realm of the dead, takes the place of ''sheol''. In particular, Jesus teaches in Luke 16:19\u201331 ([[Lazarus and Dives]]) that ''hades'' consists of two separate \"sections\", one for the righteous and one for the unrighteous. His teaching is consistent with [[Intertestamental period|intertestamental]] Jewish thought on the subject.<ref>D. K. Innes, \"Sheol\" in ''New Bible Dictionary'', IVP 1996.</ref>\n\nFully developed Christian theology goes a step further; on the basis of such texts as Luke 23:43 and Philippians 1:23, it has traditionally been taught that the souls of the dead are received immediately either into heaven or hell, where they will experience a foretaste of their eternal destiny prior to the resurrection. ([[Roman Catholicism]] teaches a third possible location, [[Purgatory]], though this is denied by [[Protestants]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]].)\n:\"the souls of the righteous, being then made perfect in holiness, are received into the highest heavens, where they behold the face of God, in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption of their bodies. And the souls of the wicked are cast into hell, where they remain in torments and utter darkness, reserved to the judgment of the great day.\" (''Westminster Confession'')\n\nSome Christian groups which stress a monistic anthropology deny that the soul can exist consciously apart from the body. For example, the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] teaches that the intermediate state is an [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] sleep; this teaching is informally known as \"[[soul sleep]]\".\n\n;Final state\nIn Christian belief, both the righteous and the unrighteous will be resurrected at the [[last judgment]]. The righteous will receive incorruptible, immortal bodies (1 Corinthians 15), while the unrighteous will be sent to [[hell]]. Traditionally, Christians have believed that hell will be a place of eternal physical and psychological punishment. In the last two centuries, [[annihilationism]] has become popular.\n\n===Mariology===\n{{Main|Mariology}}\nThe study of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], doctrines about her, and how she relates to the Church, Christ, and the individual Christian is called Mariology. Examples of Mariology include the study of and doctrines regarding her [[perpetual virginity of Mary|Perpetual Virginity]], her [[Theotokos|Motherhood of God]] (and by extension her [[Mother of the Church|Motherhood/Intercession for all Christians]]), her [[Immaculate Conception]], and her [[assumption of Mary|Assumption into heaven]]. [[Catholic Mariology]] is the Marian study specifically in the context of the [[Catholic Church]].\n\n===Angelology===\n{{Main|Heavenly host|Christian angelic hierarchy}}\nMost descriptions of angels in the Bible describe them in military terms. For example, in terms such as encampment ([http://www.bible.org/netbible/gen32.htm Gen.32:1\u20132]), command structure ([http://bible.org/netbible/psa91.htm Ps.91:11\u201312]; [http://bible.org/netbible/mat13.htm Matt.13:41]; [http://bible.org/netbible/index.htm?rev7.htm Rev.7:2]), and combat ([http://bible.org/netbible/index.htm?jdg5.htm Jdg.5:20]; [http://bible.org/netbible/index.htm?job19.htm Job 19:12]; [http://bible.org/netbible/index.htm?rev12.htm Rev.12:7]).\n\nIts specific hierarchy differs slightly from the [[Christian angelic hierarchy|Hierarchy of Angels]] as it surrounds more military services, whereas the Hierarchy of angels is a division of angels into non-military services to God.\n\n====Members of the heavenly host====\n{{Main|Cherub}}\nCherubim are depicted as accompanying God's chariot-throne ([http://bible.org/netbible/psa80.htm Ps.80:1]). {{bibleverse||Exodus|25:18\u201322}} refers to two Cherub statues placed on top of the Ark of the Covenant, the two cherubim are usually interpreted as guarding the throne of God. Other guard-like duties include being posted in locations such as the gates of Eden ([http://bible.org/netbible/gen3.htm Gen.3:24]). Cherubim were mythological winged bulls or other beasts that were part of ancient Near Eastern traditions.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P9sYIRXZZ2MC |encyclopedia=Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible |first1=David Noel |last1=Freedman |first2=Allen C. |last2=Myers |first3=Astrid B. |last3=Beck |publisher=Wm.

Often such banishment is a punishment for disobeying or rebelling against [[God]] (see [[War in Heaven]]). The best-known fallen angel is [[Lucifer]]. Lucifer is a name frequently given to [[Satan]] in [[Christianity|Christian]] belief. This usage stems from a particular interpretation, as a reference to a fallen angel, of a passage in the [[Bible]] ({{Bibleverse||Isaiah|14:3\u201320|ESV}}) that speaks of someone who is given the name of \"Day Star\" or \"Morning Star\" (in [[Latin]], ''Lucifer'') as fallen from heaven. The [[Greek Language|Greek]] [[etymology|etymological]] synonym of Lucifer, \u03a6\u03c9\u03c3\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''Phosphoros'', \"light-bearer\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scripturetext.com/2_peter/1-19.htm |title=ScriptureText.com |publisher=ScriptureText.com |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=phosphorous |title=Etymonline.com |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref> is used of the morning star in {{Bibleverse|2|Peter|1:19|ESV}} and elsewhere with no reference to Satan. But Satan is called Lucifer in many writings later than the Bible, notably in Milton's ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (7.131\u2013134, among others), because, according to Milton, Satan was \"brighter once amidst the host of Angels, than that star the stars among.\"\n\nAllegedly, fallen angels are those which have committed one of the seven deadly sins. Therefore, are banished from heaven and suffer in hell for all eternity. Demons from hell would punish the fallen angel by ripping out their wings as a sign of insignificance and low rank.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.online-literature.com/view.php/paradiselost/7?term=lucifer |title=Online-Literature.com |publisher=Online-Literature.com |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref>\n\n===Heaven===\n[[File:Paradiso Canto 31.jpg|thumb|[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] gaze upon the highest heavens; from [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]'s illustrations to the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.]]\n{{main|Heaven (Christianity)}}\n[[Christianity]] has taught Heaven as a place of [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]], in that it is a shared plane to be attained by all the elect (rather than an abstract experience related to individual concepts of the ideal). The Christian Church has been divided over how people gain this eternal life. From the 16th to the late 19th century, [[Christendom]] was divided between the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] view, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] view, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] view, the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]] view, the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Abyssinian]] view and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] views. See also [[Christian denominations]].\n\nHeaven is the English name for a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] realm wherein human beings who have transcended human living live in an [[afterlife]]. in the Bible and in English, the term \"heaven\" may refer to the physical heavens, the [[atmosphere|sky]] or the seemingly endless expanse of the [[universe]] beyond, the traditional literal meaning of the term in English.\n\nChristianity maintains that entry into Heaven awaits such time as, \"When the form of this world has passed away.\" (*[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_21071999_en.html JPII]) One view expressed in the Bible is that on the day Christ returns the righteous dead are resurrected first, and then those who are alive and judged righteous will be brought up to join them, to be taken to heaven. (I Thess 4:13\u201318)\n\nTwo related and often confused concepts of heaven in Christianity are better described as the [[Resurrection of the dead|\"resurrection of the body\"]], which is exclusively of biblical origin, as contrasted with the \"[[immortality of the soul]]\", which is also evident in the Greek tradition. In the first concept, the soul does not enter heaven until the [[last judgement]] or the \"end of time\" when it (along with the body) is resurrected and judged. In the second concept, the [[Soul#Christianity|soul]] goes to a heaven on another plane such as the [[intermediate state]] immediately after death. These two concepts are generally combined in the doctrine of the double judgement where the soul is judged once at death and goes to a temporary heaven, while awaiting a second and final physical judgement at the [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]].(*[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_21071999_en.html\" JPII], also see [[eschatology]], [[afterlife]])\n\nOne popular medieval view of Heaven was that it existed as a physical place above the clouds and that God and the Angels were physically above, watching over man. Heaven as a physical place survived in the concept that it was located far out into space, and that the stars were \"lights shining through from heaven\".\n\nMany of today's biblical scholars, such as [[N. T. Wright]], in tracing the concept of Heaven back to its Jewish roots, see Earth and Heaven as overlapping or interlocking. Heaven is known as God's space, his dimension, and is not a place that can be reached by human technology. This belief states that Heaven is where God lives and reigns whilst being active and working alongside people on Earth. One day when God restores all things, Heaven and Earth will be forever combined into the [[New Heavens and New Earth]] of the [[World to Come]].\n\n{{See also|Salvation|Soteriology}}\nReligions that teach about heaven differ on how (and if) one gets into it, typically in the [[afterlife]]. In most, entrance to Heaven is conditional on having lived a \"good life\" (within the terms of the spiritual system). A notable exception to this is the '[[sola fide]]' belief of many mainstream Protestants, which teaches that one does not have to live a perfectly \"good life,\" but that one must accept [[Jesus Christ]] as one's saviour, and then Jesus Christ will assume the guilt of one's [[sin]]s; believers are believed to be forgiven regardless of any good or bad \"works\" one has participated in.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjesuschrist.org/|title=What do you think?|accessdate=2008-10-05|publisher=AllAboutJesusChrist.org}}</ref>\n\nMany religions state that those who do not go to heaven will go to a place \"without the presence of God\", [[Hell]], which is eternal (see [[annihilationism]]). Some religions believe that other afterlives exist in addition to Heaven and Hell, such as [[Purgatory]]. One belief, [[universalism]], believes that everyone will go to Heaven eventually, no matter what they have done or believed on earth. Some forms of Christianity believe Hell to be the termination of the soul.\n\nVarious [[saint]]s have had [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] of heaven ({{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|12:2\u20134|KJV}}). The Orthodox concept of life in heaven is described in one of the [[prayer for the dead|prayers for the dead]]: \"...a place of light, a place of green pasture, a place of repose, whence all sickness, sorrow and sighing are fled away.\"<ref>''Book for Commemoration of the Living and the Dead'', trans. Father Lawrence (Holy Trinity Monastery, Jordanville NY), p. 77.</ref>\n\nThe Church bases its belief in Heaven on some main biblical passages in the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures (Old and New Testaments) and collected church wisdom. Heaven is the Realm of the Blessed [[Trinity]], the [[angels]]<ref>Treated extensively in [[C. S. Lewis]], ''The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature'' (1964).</ref> and the [[saints]].<ref>See discussion at http://forums.catholic.com/showthread.php?p=3322510 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509060655/http://forums.catholic.com/showthread.php?p=3322510 |date=9 May 2011 }}, where a.o. Hebrews 12:22\u201324 is quoted.</ref>\n\nThe essential joy of heaven is called the [[beatific vision]], which is derived from the vision of God's essence. The soul rests perfectly in God, and does not, or cannot desire anything else than God. After the [[Last Judgment]], when the soul is reunited with its body, the body participates in the happiness of the soul. It becomes incorruptible, glorious and perfect. Any physical defects the body may have laboured under are erased. Heaven is also known as [[paradise]] in some cases. [[The Great Gulf]] separates heaven from [[hell]].\n\nUpon dying, each soul goes to what is called \"the [[particular judgement]]\" where its own afterlife is decided (i.e. Heaven after Purgatory, straight to Heaven, or [[Hell]].) This is different from \"the general judgement\" also known as \"the [[Last judgement]]\" which will occur when [[Second Coming|Christ returns]] to judge all the living and the dead.\n\nThe term Heaven (which differs from \"The [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]]\" see note below) is applied by the biblical authors to the realm in which God currently resides. Eternal life, by contrast, occurs in a renewed, unspoilt and perfect creation, which can be termed Heaven since God will choose to dwell there permanently with his people, as seen in {{bibleverse||Revelation|21:3}}. There will no longer be any separation between God and man. The believers themselves will exist in incorruptible, resurrected and new bodies; there will be no sickness, no death and no tears. Some teach that death itself is not a natural part of life, but was allowed to happen after [[Adam and Eve]] disobeyed [[God]] (see [[original sin]]) so that mankind would not live forever in a state of [[sin]] and thus a state of separation from God.\n\nMany evangelicals understand this future life to be divided into two distinct periods: first, the [[Millennialism|Millennial Reign of Christ]] (the one thousand years) on this earth, referred to in {{bibleverse||Revelation|20:1\u201310}}; secondly, the [[New Heavens and New Earth]], referred to in Revelation 21 and 22. This millennialism (or chiliasm) is a revival of a strong tradition in the [[Early Church]] that was dismissed by Augustine of Hippo and the Roman Catholic Church after him.\n\nNot only will the believers spend eternity with God, they will also spend it with each other. John's vision recorded in Revelation describes a [[New Jerusalem]] which comes from Heaven to the New Earth, which is seen to be a symbolic reference to the people of God living in community with one another. 'Heaven' will be the place where life will be lived to the full, in the way that the designer planned, each believer 'loving the Lord their God with all their heart and with all their soul and with all their mind' and 'loving their neighbour as themselves' (adapted from Matthew 22:37\u201338, the [[Great Commandment]])\u2014a place of great joy, without the negative aspects of earthly life. See also [[World to Come]].\n\n;Purgatory\n[[Purgatory]] is the condition or temporary punishment<ref name=\"EB-purgatory\"/> in which, it is believed, the [[souls]] of those who die in a state of grace are made ready for [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]]. This is a theological idea that has ancient roots and is well-attested in [[early Christian]] literature, while the poetic conception of purgatory as a geographically situated place is largely the creation of medieval Christian piety and imagination.<ref name=\"EB-purgatory\"/>\n\nThe notion of purgatory is associated particularly with the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]] (in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern sui juris churches or rites]] it is a doctrine, though often without using the name \"Purgatory\"); [[Anglican]]s of the [[Anglo-Catholic]] tradition generally also hold to the belief. [[John Wesley]], the founder of [[Methodism]], believed in an [[intermediate state]] between death and the [[Last judgment|final judgment]] and in the possibility of \"continuing to grow in holiness there.\"<ref name=\"Methodism\">{{cite web|title=What happens after a person dies?|url=http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&b=4746355&content_id={94F6F768-0EA6-4C1B-B6B6-0C88EC04E8A2}&notoc=1|quote=Purgatory is believed to be a place where the souls of the faithful dead endure a period of purification and cleansing, aided by the prayers of the living, prior to their entrance into heaven.

Specifically, Theodicy is a specific branch of [[theology]] and [[philosophy]] which attempts to reconcile belief in [[God]] with the perceived existence of [[evil]].<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: Theodicy</ref> As such, theodicy can be said to attempt to justify the behaviour of [[God]] (at least insofar as God allows evil).\n\nResponses to the problem of evil have sometimes been classified as ''defenses'' or ''theodicies''. However, authors disagree on the exact definitions.<ref name=\"Stanford\">The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil The Problem of Evil]\", [[Michael Tooley]]</ref><ref name=\"IepEvidential\">The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \"[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-evi.htm The Evidential Problem of Evil]\", Nick Trakakis</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopaedia |first=Ted |last=Honderich |authorlink=Ted Honderich |year=2005 |title=theodicy |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |quote=[[John Hick]], for example, proposes a theodicy, while [[Alvin Plantinga]] formulates a defense. The idea of human free will often appears in both of these strategies, but in different ways.}}</ref> Generally, a ''defense'' attempts to show that there is no logical incompatibility between the existence of evil and the existence of God. A defense need not argue that this is a probable or plausible explanation, only that the defense is logically possible. A defense attempts to answer the ''logical'' problem of evil.\n\nA theodicy, on the other hand, is a more ambitious attempt to provide a plausible justification for the existence of evil. A theodicy attempts to answer the ''evidential'' problem of evil.<ref name=\"IepEvidential\" /> [[Richard Swinburne]] maintains that it does not make sense to assume there are greater goods, unless we know what they are, i.e., we have a successful theodicy.<ref name=swinburne05>{{cite encyclopaedia |first=Richard |last=Swinburne |authorlink=Richard Swinburne |year=2005 |title=evil, the problem of |editor=[[Ted Honderich]] |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |isbn=0-19-926479-1}}</ref>\n\nAs an example, some authors see arguments including [[demon]]s or the [[fall of man]] as not logically impossible but not very plausible considering our knowledge about the world. Thus they are seen as defenses but not good theodicies.<ref name=\"IepEvidential\"/> [[C. S. Lewis]] writes in his book [[The Problem of Pain]]:\n{{quote|We can, perhaps, conceive of a world in which God corrected the results of this abuse of free will by His creatures at every moment: so that a wooden beam became soft as grass when it was used as a weapon, and the air refused to obey me if I attempted to set up in it the sound waves that carry lies or insults. But such a world would be one in which wrong actions were impossible, and in which, therefore, freedom of the will would be void; nay, if the principle were carried out to its logical conclusion, evil thoughts would be impossible, for the cerebral matter which we use in thinking would refuse its task when we attempted to frame them.<ref>Lewis, C. S., ''The Problem of Pain'' HarperCollins:New York, 1996 pp. 24\u201325</ref>}}\n\nAnother possible answer is that the world is corrupted due to the sin of mankind. Some answer that because of sin, the world has fallen from the grace of God, and is not perfect. Therefore, evils and imperfections persist because the world is fallen.<ref>Rhodes, Ron, [http://ldolphin.org/evil.html Notes on the Problem of Evil]</ref> [[William A. Dembski]] argues that the effects of Adam's sin recorded in the Book of Genesis were 'back-dated' by God, and hence applied to the earlier history of the universe.<ref>William A. Dembski, The End of Christianity: Finding a Good God in an Evil World. (Nashville: Broadman and Holman, 2009</ref>\n\nEvil is sometimes seen as a test or trial for humans. [[Irenaeus|Irenaeus of Lyons]] and more recently [[John Hick]] have argued that evil and suffering are necessary for spiritual growth. This is often combined with the free will argument by arguing that such spiritual growth requires free will decisions. A problem with this is that many evils do not seem to cause any kind of spiritual growth, or even permit it, as when a child is abused from birth and becomes, seemingly inevitably, a brutal adult.\n\nThe problem of evil is often phrased in the form: ''Why do bad things happen to good people?''. [[Christianity]] teach that all people are inherently sinful due to the [[fall of man]] and [[original sin]]; for example, [[Calvinist]] theology follows a doctrine called [[federal headship]], which argues that the first man, [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], was the legal representative of the entire human race. A counterargument to the basic version of this principle is that an omniscient God would have predicted this, when he created the world, and an omnipotent God could have prevented it.\n\nThe [[Book of Isaiah]] clearly claims that God is the source of at least some natural disasters, but Isaiah doesn't attempt to explain the motivation behind the creation of evil.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+45%3A7&version=KJV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Isaiah 45:7 \u2013 King James Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref> In contrast, the [[Book of Job]] is one of the most widely known formulations of the problem of evil in Western thought. In it, Satan challenges God regarding his servant Job, claiming that Job only serves God for the blessings and protection that he receives from him. God allows Satan to plague Job and his family in a number of ways, with the limitation that Satan may not take Job's life (but his children are killed). Job discusses this with three friends and questions God regarding his suffering which he finds to be unjust. God responds in a speech and then more than restores Job's prior health, wealth, and gives him new children.\n\n[[Bart D. Ehrman]] argues that different parts of the Bible give different answers. One example is evil as punishment for sin or as a consequence of sin. Ehrman writes that this seems to be based on some notion of free will although this argument is never explicitly mentioned in the Bible. Another argument is that suffering ultimately achieves a greater good, possibly for persons other than the sufferer, that would not have been possible otherwise. The Book of Job offers two different answers: suffering is a test, and you will be rewarded later for passing it; another that God in his might chooses not to reveal his reasons. [[Ecclesiastes]] sees suffering as beyond human abilities to comprehend. [[Apocalyptic literature|Apocalyptic]] parts, including the [[New Testament]], see suffering as due to cosmic evil forces, that God for mysterious reasons has given power over the world, but which will soon be defeated and things will be set right.<ref>Ehrman, Bart D., ''God's Problem: How the Bible Fails to Answer Our Most Important Question \u2013 Why We Suffer''. HarperOne, 2008</ref>\n\n==Hamartiology: Sin==\n{{Main|Hamartiology|Christian views on sin|Christian anthropology}}\nThe Greek word in the [[New Testament]] that is translated in English as \"sin\" is ''[[hamartia]]'', which literally means ''missing the target''. [[1 John]] 3:4 states: \"Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is [[antinomianism|lawlessness]]\". Jesus [[Expounding of the Law|clarified the law]] by defining its foundation: \"Jesus replied: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and [[Great Commandment|greatest commandment]]. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' All the [[Torah|Law]] and the [[Neviim|Prophets]] hang on these two commandments.\" ({{bibleverse||Matthew|22:36\u201340|NIV}})\n\nHamartiology ({{lang-el|\u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1}}, ''[[hamartia]]'', \"missing the mark,\" \"sin,\" + -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1, ''[[Logos|-logia]]'', \"sayings\" or \"discourse\") is the branch of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]], more specifically, [[systematic theology]], which is the study of [[sin]] with a view to articulating a doctrine of it.\n\nSubstantial branches of hamartiological understanding subscribe to the doctrine of [[original sin]], which was taught by the Apostle Paul in Romans 5:12\u201319 and popularized by [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]. He taught that all the descendants of [[Adam and Eve]] are guilty of Adam's sin without their own personal choice <ref>Bavink, Herman. ''Reformed Dogmatics'' Vol. 3. (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2004) pp. 75\u2013125 detail the historical development of Hamartiology, including Pelagius's position and the mediating positions)</ref>\n\nIn contrast, [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]] argued that humans enter life as essentially ''[[tabula rasa|tabulae rasae]]''. [[Fall of man|The fall]] that occurred when Adam and Eve disobeyed [[God]] was held by his group to have affected humankind only minimally. But few theologians continue to hold this hamartiological viewpoint.\n\nA third branch of thinking takes an intermediate position, arguing that after the fall of Adam and Eve, humans are born impacted by sin such that they have very decided tendencies toward sinning (which by personal choice all accountable humans but [[Jesus]] soon choose to indulge).\n\nThe degree to which a Christian believes humanity is impacted by either a literal or metaphorical \"fall\" determines their understanding of related theological concepts like [[salvation]], [[Justification (theology)|justification]], and [[sanctification]].\n\nChristian views on sin are mostly understood as legal infraction or contract violation, and so salvation tends to be viewed in legal terms, similar to Jewish thinking.\n\n===Sin===\n{{Main|Sin}}\n[[File:Forbidden fruit.jpg|thumb|A [[Sistine Chapel]] [[fresco]] depicts the expulsion of [[Adam and Eve]] from the garden of Eden for their sin of eating from the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.]]\nIn [[religion]], sin is the concept of acts that violate a [[morality|moral]] [[norm (philosophy)|rule]]. The term sin may also refer to the [[state (polity)|state]] of having committed such a violation. Commonly, the moral [[code of conduct]] is decreed by a divine entity, i.e. [[Divine law]].\n\nSin is often used to mean an action that is prohibited or considered wrong; in some religions (notably some sects of [[Christianity]]), sin can refer not only to physical actions taken, but also to thoughts and internalized motivations and feelings. Colloquially, any thought, word, or act considered immoral, [[shame]]ful, harmful, or alienating might be termed \"sinful\".\n\nAn elementary concept of \"sin\" regards such acts and elements of Earthly living that one cannot take with them into [[Heaven|transcendental living]]. Food, for example is not of transcendental living and therefore its excessive savoring is considered a sin. A more developed concept of \"sin\" deals with a distinction between sins of [[death]] ([[mortal sin]]) and the sins of human living ([[venial sin]]). In that context, mortal sins are said to have the dire consequence of [[divine punishment|mortal penalty]], while sins of living ([[food]], casual or informal [[Human sexual activity|sexuality]], [[play (activity)|play]], [[inebriation]]) may be regarded as essential spice for transcendental living, even though these may be destructive in the context of human living (obesity, [[infidelity]]).\n\nCommon ideas surrounding sin in various religions include:\n* [[Punishment]] for sins, from other people, from [[God]] either in life or in [[afterlife]], or from the Universe in general.\n* The question of whether an act must be intentional to be sinful.\n* The idea that one's [[conscience]] should produce [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] for a conscious act of sin.\n* A scheme for determining the seriousness of the sin.\n* [[Repentance]] from (expressing regret for and determining not to commit) sin, and [[Restitution (theology)|atonement]] (repayment) for past deeds.\n* The possibility of [[forgiveness]] of sins, often through communication with a deity or intermediary; in [[Christianity]] often referred to as [[salvation]]. [[Crime]] and [[justice]] are related [[secularism|secular]] concepts.\n\nIn [[Western Christianity]], \"sin is [[Antinomianism|lawlessness]]\" (1 John 3:4) and so salvation tends to be understood in legal terms, similar to Jewish law. Sin alienates the sinner from God. It has damaged, and completely severed, the relationship of humanity to God. That relationship can only be restored through acceptance of [[Christ|Jesus Christ]] and his death on the cross as a sacrifice for mankind's sin (see [[Salvation]] and [[Substitutionary atonement]]).\n\nIn [[Eastern Christianity]], sin is viewed in terms of its effects on relationships, both among people and between people and God. Sin is seen as the refusal to follow God's plan, and the desire to be like God and thus in direct opposition to him (see the account of [[Adam and Eve]] in the [[Book of Genesis]]). To sin is to want control of one's destiny in opposition to the will of God,\nto do some rigid beliefs.\n\nIn [[Russian Orthodox|Russian]] variant of [[Eastern Christianity]], sin sometimes is regarded as any mistake made by people in their life. From this point of view every person is sinful because every person makes mistakes during his life. When person accuses others in sins he always must remember that he is also sinner and so he must have mercy for others remembering that God is also merciful to him and to all humanity.\n\n===Fall of man===\n{{Main|Fall of man}}\nThe fall of man or simply the fall refers in [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrine to the transition of the first humans from a state of innocent obedience to [[God]], to a state of guilty disobedience to God. In the [[Book of Genesis]] chapter 2, [[Adam and Eve]] live at first with God in a [[paradise]], but are then deceived or tempted by the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] to eat [[Forbidden fruit|fruit]] from the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]], which had been forbidden to them by God. After doing so they become ashamed of their nakedness, and God consequently expelled them from [[paradise]]. The fall is not mentioned by name in the [[Bible]], but the story of disobedience and expulsion is recounted in both Testaments in different ways. The Fall can refer to the wider theological inferences for all humankind as a consequence of Eve and Adam's [[original sin]]. Examples include the teachings of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] in {{Bibleref2|Romans|5:12\u201319}} and {{Bibleref2|1Cor|15:21\u201322||1 Cor. 15:21\u201322}}.\n\nSome [[Christian denominations]] believe the fall corrupted the entire natural world, including human nature, causing people to be born into [[original sin]], a state from which they cannot attain [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] without the [[Grace (Christianity)|gracious intervention of God]]. [[Protestants]] hold that [[Jesus]]' death was a [[Atonement (ransom view)|\"ransom\"]] by which humanity was offered freedom from the sin acquired at the fall. In other religions, such as [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], and [[Gnosticism]], the term \"the fall\" is not recognized and varying interpretations of the Eden narrative are presented.\n\n[[Christianity]] interprets the fall in a number of ways. Traditional Christian theology accepts the teaching of [[Paul of Tarsus|St Paul]] in his letter to the [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]]<ref>Paul's Epistle to the Romans, chapter 3 verse 23</ref>{{Better source|reason=Theology is a synthesis on the bible, and so needs theological sources|date=March 2010}} \"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\" and of [[John the Evangelist|St John]]'s [[Gospel]] that \"God so loved the world that he sent his only son (Jesus Christ) that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life\".{{Bibleref2c|John|3:16|}}{{Better source|reason=Theology is a synthesis on the bible, and so needs theological sources|date=March 2010}}\n\nThe doctrine of [[original sin]], as articulated by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine of Hippo's]] interpretation of [[Paul of Tarsus]], provides that the fall caused a fundamental change in human nature, so that all descendants of Adam are born in [[sin]], and can only be redeemed by [[Grace (Christianity)|divine grace]]. Sacrifice was the only means by which humanity could be redeemed after the fall. Jesus, who was without sin, died on the [[crucifixion|cross]] as the ultimate redemption for the sin of humankind.\n\n===Original sin===\n{{Main|Original sin}}\nThus, the moment Adam and Eve ate the fruit from the tree\u2014which God had commanded them not to do\u2014sinful death was born; ''it was an act of disobedience, thinking they could become like gods, that was the sin''. Since Adam was the head of the human race, he is held responsible for the evil that took place, for which reason the [[fall of man]] is referred to as the \"[[sin of Adam]]\". This sin caused Adam and his descendants to lose unrestricted access to God Himself. The years of life were limited. \"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned\" ({{bibleverse||Romans|5:12|KJV}}). In Christian theology, the [[death of Jesus]] on the [[Christian cross|cross]] is the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] to the sin of Adam. \"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.\" ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:22|KJV}}). As a result of that act of Christ, all who put their trust in [[Solus Christus|Christ alone]] now have unrestricted access to God through prayer and in presence.\n\nOriginal sin, which Eastern Christians usually refer to as [[ancestral sin]],<ref>The term \"[[ancestral sin]]\" is also used, as in [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 (e.g. [http://www.parembasis.gr/2003/03_10_16.htm \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c6\u03c4\u03ce\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u2013 \u03b7 \u03bf\u03c1\u03b8\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03be\u03b7 \u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03c8\u03b7,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721082731/http://www.parembasis.gr/2003/03_10_16.htm |date=21 July 2011 }} [http://www.monipetraki.gr/sarakosti.html \u0397 \u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2,] [http://www.oodegr.com/oode/protestant/luther_antimonaxismos1.htm \u03a0\u03ce\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5 \u03bf \u039b\u03bf\u03cd\u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u2013 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a6\u03bb\u03c9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c6\u03c3\u03ba\u03c5]) or \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78 \u1f01\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 (e.g. [http://www.apostoliki-diakonia.gr/GR_MAIN/catehism/theologia_zoi/themata.asp?contents=selides_katixisis/contents_TaIeraMistiria.asp&main=kat010&file=4.4.1.htm \u0391\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03b5\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b4\u03bf\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\u2013 \u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1 \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03ce\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5, \u03b5\u03ba\u03b4. \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, 1997, \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb. 156\u2013161,] [http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b26.e.i_despotikes_eortes.01.htm \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03c4\u03cc\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03b1\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427075227/http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b26.e.i_despotikes_eortes.01.htm |date=27 April 2010 }})</ref> is, according to a doctrine proposed in Christian theology, humanity's state of [[sin]] resulting from the [[fall of man]].<ref name=\"ODCC-OS\">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-19-280290-3 |title=Original Sin}}</ref> This condition has been characterized in many ways, ranging from something as insignificant as a slight deficiency, or a tendency toward sin yet without collective guilt, referred to as a \"sin nature,\" to something as drastic as [[total depravity]] or automatic guilt by all humans through collective guilt.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Brodd | first = Jeffrey | authorlink = | title = World Religions | publisher = Saint Mary's Press | year = 2003 | location = Winona, MN | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-88489-725-5 }}</ref>\n\nThose who uphold the doctrine look to the teaching of [[Paul the Apostle]] in {{bibleverse||Romans|5:12\u201321}} and {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:22}} for its [[Bible|scriptural]] base,<ref name=\"ODCC-Doctrine\" /> and see it as perhaps implied in Old Testament passages such as {{bibleverse||Psalm|51:5}} and {{bibleverse||Psalm|58:3}}.\n\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli 050.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Augustine of Hippo]] wrote that original sin is transmitted by concupiscence and enfeebles freedom of the will without destroying it.<ref name=\"ODCC-Doctrine\" />]]\nThe [[Apostolic Father]]s and the [[Apologist]]s mostly dealt with topics other than original sin.<ref name=\"ODCC-Doctrine\" /> The doctrine of original sin was first developed in 2nd-century Bishop of [[Lyon]] [[Irenaeus]]'s struggle against [[Gnosticism]].<ref name=\"ODCC-Doctrine\" /> The Greek Fathers emphasized the cosmic dimension of the fall, namely that since Adam human beings are born into a fallen world, but held fast to belief that man, though fallen, is free.<ref name=\"ODCC-Doctrine\" /> It was in the West that precise definition of the doctrine arose.<ref name=\"ODCC-Doctrine\" />\n[[Augustine of Hippo]] taught that original sin was both an act of foolishness (''insipientia'') and of pride and disobedience to the God of Adam and Eve.

[[Thomas Aquinas]] explained Augustine's doctrine pointing out that the ''libido'' (''concupiscence''), which makes the original sin pass from parents to children, is not a ''libido actualis'', i.e. sexual lust, but ''libido habitualis'', i.e. a wound of the whole of human nature.<ref>''Libido quae transmittit peccatum originale in prolem, non-est libido actualis, quia dato quod virtute divina concederetur alicui quod nullam inordinatam libidinem in actu generationis sentiret, adhuc transmitteret in prolem originale peccatum.

Original sin, according to Augustine, consists of the guilt of Adam which all humans inherit. As sinners, humans are utterly depraved in nature, lack the freedom to do good, and cannot respond to the will of God without [[Grace (Christianity)|divine grace]].

Calvin believed that humans inherit Adamic guilt and are in a state of sin from the moment of conception. This inherently sinful nature (the basis for the [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] doctrine of \"[[total depravity]]\") results in a complete alienation from God and the total inability of humans to achieve reconciliation with God based on their own abilities.

The doctrine of total depravity asserts that people are by nature not inclined or even able to love God wholly with heart, mind, and strength, but rather all are inclined by nature to serve their own will and desires and to reject the rule of God. Even religion and [[philanthropy]] are wicked to God to the extent that these originate from a human imagination, passion, and will and are not done to the glory of God. Therefore, in [[Calvinism|Reformed theology]], if God is to save anyone He must [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestine]], call, elect individuals to salvation since fallen man does not want to, indeed is incapable of choosing God.<ref>The ''[[Westminster Confession of Faith]]'', [http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_IX.html 9.3]</ref>\n\nTotal depravity does not mean, however, that people are as evil as possible. Rather, it means that even the good which a person may intend is faulty in its premise, false in its motive, and weak in its implementation; and there is no mere refinement of natural capacities that can correct this condition. Thus, even acts of generosity and altruism are in fact [[psychological egoism|egoist]] acts in disguise.

In Christian theology the atonement refers to the forgiving or pardoning of one's [[sin]] through the death of [[Jesus Christ]] by [[crucifixion]], which made possible the reconciliation between God and creation. Within Christianity there are three main theories for how such atonement might work: the [[Atonement (ransom view)|ransom theory]], the [[Atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction theory]] and the [[Atonement (moral influence view)|moral influence theory]]. Christian soteriology is unlike and not to be confused with [[collective salvation]].\n\n===Traditional focus===\nChristian soteriology traditionally focuses on how God ends the separation people have from him due to [[sin]] by reconciling them with himself. ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:10-11;&version=9; Rom. 5:10\u201311]). Many Christians believe they receive the forgiveness of sins ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=51&chapter=2&verse=38&version=31&context=verse Acts 2:38]), life ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=52&chapter=8&verse=11&version=31&context=verse Rom. 8:11]), and salvation ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=59&chapter=5&verse=9&version=31&context=verse 1 Thess. 5:9]) bought by [[Jesus]] through his innocent suffering, death, and resurrection from the dead three days later ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&chapter=28&version=47&context=chapter Matt. 28]).\n\nChrist's death, resurrection, ascension, and sending of the [[Holy Spirit]], is called ''The Paschal Mystery''. Christ's human birth is called the ''[[Incarnation]]''. Either or both are considered in different versions of soteriology.\n\nWhile not neglecting the ''Paschal Mystery'', many Christians believe salvation is brought through the ''Incarnation'' itself, in which God took on human nature so that humans could partake in the divine nature (2 Peter 1.4). As [[St. Athanasius]] put it, God became human so that we might become divine (St. Athanasius, De inc. 54, 3: PG 25, 192B.). This [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] in Christ ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=53&chapter=1&verse=4&version=31&context=verse 1 Cor. 1:4]) is received as a gift of God that cannot be merited by works done prior to one's conversion to Christianity ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:8-9;&version=31; Eph. 2:8\u20139]), which is brought about by hearing God's Word ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=52&chapter=10&verse=17&version=50&context=verse Rom. 10:17]) and harkening to it. This involves accepting Jesus Christ as the personal saviour and Lord over one's life.\n\n===Distinct schools===\nProtestant teaching, originating with [[Martin Luther]], teaches that salvation is received by [[Sola gratia|grace alone]] and that one's sole necessary response to this grace is [[Sola fide|faith alone]]. Older Christian teaching, as found in Catholic and Orthodox theology, is that salvation is received by [[Sola gratia|grace alone]], but that one's necessary response to this grace comprises both faith and works (James 2:24, 26; Rom 2:6\u20137; Gal 5:6).\n\n===Catholic soteriology===\nHuman beings exists because God wanted to share His life with them. In this sense, every human being is God's child. In a fuller sense, to come to salvation is to be reconciled to God through Christ and to be united with His divine Essence via [[Divinization (Christian)|Theosis]] in the [[beatific vision]] of the Godhead. The graces of Christ's passion, death, and resurrection are found in the [[Catholic sacraments|seven sacraments]] of the [[Catholic Church]].\n\n===Comparison among Protestants===\n{{Comparison among Protestants}}\n\n==Ecclesiology: Church==\n{{Main|Ecclesiology}}\n[[Ecclesiology]] (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u1fb1}}, ''ekkl\u0113si\u0101'', \"[[wikt:congregation|congregation]], [[church (building)|church]]\";\nand {{lang|grc|-\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is the study of the theological understanding of the [[Christian church]], including the [[institution|institutional structure]], [[sacrament]]s and practices (especially the [[worship]] of God) thereof. Specific areas of concern include the church's role in [[salvation]], its origin, its relationship to the historical [[Jesus|Christ]], its discipline, its [[eschatology|destiny]], and its [[clergy|leadership]]. Ecclesiology is, therefore, the study of the church as a thing in, and of, itself.\n\nDifferent ecclesiologies give shape to very different institutions. Thus, in addition to describing a broad discipline of theology, ecclesiology may be used in the specific sense of a particular church or denomination's character, self-described or otherwise. This is the sense of the word in such phrases as ''Roman Catholic ecclesiology'', ''Lutheran ecclesiology'', and ''ecumenical ecclesiology''.\n\n;Issues addressed by ecclesiology\nEcclesiology asks the questions:\n* '''Who is the Church?''' Is it a visible or earthly [[corporation]] or a unified, visible society\u2014a \"church\" in the sense of a specific denomination or institution, for instance? Or is it the body of all believing [[Christianity|Christians]] (see [[invisible church]]) regardless of their [[religious denomination|denominational]] differences and disunity? What is the relationship between living Christians and [[saint|departed]] Christians (the \"[[cloud of witnesses]]\")\u2013 do they (those on Earth and those in Heaven) constitute together the Church?\n* '''Must one join a church?''' That is, what is the role of corporate [[worship]] in the spiritual lives of believers? Is it in fact necessary? Can salvation be found outside of formal membership in a given faith community, and what constitutes \"membership?\" ([[Baptism]]? Formal acceptance of a [[creed]]? Regular participation?)\n* '''What is the [[authority]] of ''the'' Church?''' Who gets to interpret the doctrines of the Church? Is the organizational structure itself, either in a single corporate body, or generally within the range of formal church structures, an ''independent vehicle'' of [[revelation]] or of [[God]]'s [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]]? Or is the Church's authority instead dependent on and derivative of a ''separate and prior divine revelation external to the organization'', with individual institutions being \"the Church\" only to the extent that they teach this message? For example, is the [[Bible]] a written part of a wider revelation entrusted to the Church as faith community, and therefore to be interpreted within that context? Or is the Bible the revelation itself, and the Church is to be defined as a group of people who claim adherence to it?\n* '''What does the Church do?''' What are the [[sacrament]]s, divine ordinances, and [[liturgy|liturgies]], in the context of the Church, and are they part of the Church's mission to preach the [[Gospel]]? What is the comparative emphasis and relationship between [[worship]] service, [[spiritual formation]], and [[Mission (Christian)|mission]], and is the Church's role to create [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] of [[Christ]] or some other function? Is the Eucharist the defining element of the rest of the sacramental system and the Church itself, or is it secondary to the act of preaching? Is the Church to be understood as the vehicle for salvation, or the salvific presence in the world, or as a community of those already \"saved?\"\n* '''How should the Church be governed?''' What was the mission and authority of the Apostles, and is this handed down through the sacraments today? What are the proper methods of choosing [[clergy]] such as [[bishop]]s and [[priest]]s, and what is their role within the context of the Church? Is an [[Holy Orders|ordained]] clergy necessary? * Who are the leaders of a church? Must there be a policy-making board of \"leaders\" within a church and what are the qualifications for this position, and by what process do these members become [[Holy Orders|official, ordained]] \"leaders\"? Must leaders and clergy be \"ordained,\" and is this possible [[Apostolic succession|only by those who have been ordained by others]]?\n\n===Ecclesiastical polity===\n{{Main|Ecclesiastical polity}}\nEcclesiastical polity is the operational and governance structure of a [[Church body|church]] or [[Christian denomination]]. It also denotes the [[Minister of religion|ministerial]] structure of the church and the authority relationships between churches. Polity is closely related to [[Ecclesiology]], the study of doctrine and theology relating to church organization.\n\nIssues of church governance appear in the first chapters of the [[Acts of the Apostles]]; the first act recorded after the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascension]] is the election of [[Saint Matthias|Matthias]] to replace [[Judas Iscariot]]. Over the years a system of episcopal polity developed.\n\nDuring the [[Protestant Reformation]], arguments were made that the [[New Testament]] prescribed structures quite different from that of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] of the day, and different Protestant bodies used different types of polity. It was during this period that [[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]] wrote ''[[Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity]]'' to defend the polity of the [[Church of England]] against the [[Puritans]].\n\nEpiscopal polity is used in several closely related senses. Most commonly it refers to the field of church governance in the abstract, but it also can refer to the governance of a particular Christian body. In this sense it is used as a term in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. \"Polity\" is sometimes used as a shorthand for the church governance structure itself.\n\nThough each church or denomination has its own characteristic structure, there are three general types of polity.\n\n;Episcopal polity\n{{Main|Episcopal polity}}\nChurches having episcopal polity are governed by [[bishop]]s. The title bishop comes from the Greek word ''episkopos'', which literally translates into ''overseer''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bishop |title=Bishop\u2013 Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=25 April 2007 |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref> In regard to [[Catholicism]], bishops have authority over the [[diocese]], which is both sacramental and political; as well as performing [[ordination]]s, [[confirmation]]s, and [[consecration]]s, the bishop supervises the [[clergy]] of the diocese and represents the diocese both secularly and in the hierarchy of church governance.\n\nBishops in this system may be subject to higher ranking bishops (variously called [[archbishop]]s, [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitans]] or [[patriarch]]s, depending upon the tradition; ''see also [[Bishop]] for further explanation of the varieties of bishops''.) They also meet in councils or [[synod]]s. These synods, subject to presidency by higher ranking bishops, may govern the dioceses which are represented in the council, though the [[synod]] may also be purely advisory.\n\nNote that the presence of the office of \"bishop\" within a church is not proof of episcopal polity. For example, in [[Mormonism]], the \"bishop\" occupies the office that in an [[Anglican]] church would be occupied by a [[priest]].\n\nAlso, episcopal polity is not usually a simple chain of command.\nInstead, some authority may be held, not only by synods and colleges of bishops, but by [[Laity|lay]] and [[Clergy|clerical]] councils. Further, patterns of authority are subject to a wide variety of historical rights and honors which may cut across simple lines of authority.\n\nEpiscopal polity is the predominant pattern in [[Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Anglican]] churches. It is also common in [[Methodist]] and [[Lutheran]] churches. Among churches with episcopal polity, different theories of autonomy are expressed. So in [[Roman Catholicism]] the church is viewed as a single polity headed by the [[pope]], but in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] the various churches retain formal [[autonomy]] but are held to be unified by shared doctrine and [[conciliarity]]\u2014that is, the authority of councils, such as [[ecumenical council]]s, [[Holy Synod]]s and the former standing council, the [[Endemusa Synod]].\n\n;Presbyterian polity\n{{Main|Presbyterian polity}}\nMany [[Reformed]] churches, notably those in the [[Presbyterian]] and Continental Reformed traditions, are governed by a hierarchy of councils. The lowest level council governs a single local church and is called the ''[[Kirk Session|session]]'' or ''[[Consistory (Protestantism)#Reformed usage|consistory]]''; its members are called ''[[Elder (religious)|elders]]''. The [[minister of religion|minister]] of the church (sometimes referred to as a ''teaching elder'') is a member of and presides over the session; lay representatives (''ruling elders'' or, informally, just elders) are elected by the congregation. The session sends representatives to the next level higher council, called the ''[[presbytery (church polity)|presbytery]]'' or ''classis''. In some Presbyterian churches there are higher level councils ([[synod]]s or [[General Assembly (presbyterian church)|general assemblies]]). Each council has authority over its constituents, and the representatives at each level are expected to use their own judgment. Hence higher level councils act as courts of appeal for church trials and disputes, and it is not uncommon to see rulings and decisions overturned.\n\nPresbyterian polity is, of course, the characteristic governance of [[Presbyterian]] churches, and also of churches in the Continental [[Reformed]] tradition. Elements of presbyterian polity are also found in other churches. For example, in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] governance by bishops is paralleled by a system of deputies, who are lay and clerical representatives elected by parishes and, at the national level, by the dioceses. Legislation in the [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|general convention]] requires the separate consent of the bishops and of the deputies.\n\nNote that, in episcopal polity, a [[presbyter]] refers to a [[priest]].\n\n;Congregational polity\n{{Main|Congregational polity}}\n[[Congregationalist polity]] dispenses with titled positions such as [[bishop]] as a requirement of church structure. The local congregation rules itself, though local leaders and councils may be appointed.\n\nMembers may be sent from the congregation to associations that are sometimes identified with the church bodies formed by [[Lutheran]]s, [[Presbyterian]]s, [[Anglican]]s, and other non-congregational [[Protestants]]. The similarity is deceptive, however, because the congregationalist associations do not exercise control over their members (other than ending their membership in the association). Many congregationalist churches are completely independent in principle. One major exception is [[Ordination]], where even congregationalist churches often invite members of the [[vicinage]] or association to ordain their called pastor.\n\nIt is a principle of congregationalism that ministers do not govern congregations by themselves. They may preside over the congregation, but it is the congregation which exerts its authority in the end.\n\nCongregational polity is sometimes called \"Baptist polity\", as it is the characteristic polity of [[Baptist church]]es.\n\n===Priesthood===\n{{Main|Priesthood}}\n* [[Laity]], [[Priesthood of all believers]]\n* [[Clergy]], [[Bishop]], [[Priest]], [[Pastor]], [[Elder (Christianity)|Elder]]\n\n===Church discipline===\n{{Main|Church discipline}}\n\n===Missiology===\n{{Main|Missiology}}\n\n===Sacrament===\n{{Main|Sacrament}}\nA sacrament, as defined in Hexam's ''Concise Dictionary of Religion'', is what [[Roman Catholic]]s believe to be \"a [[rite]] in which [[God]] is uniquely active.\" [[Augustine of Hippo]] defined a [[Christianity|Christian]] sacrament as \"a visible sign of an invisible reality.\" The [[Anglican]] [[Book of Common Prayer]] speaks of them as \"an outward and visible sign of an inward and invisible [[Grace (Christianity)|Grace]].\" Examples of sacraments would be [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]].\"<ref>Hexam's ''Concise Dictionary of Religion'' \"Sacrament\" obtained at https://www.ucalgary.ca/~nurelweb/concise/WORDS-S.html</ref> Therefore a sacrament is a [[religious symbol]] or often a [[rite]] which conveys [[Grace (Christianity)|divine grace]], [[blessing]], or [[sanctity]] upon the believer who participates in it, or a tangible symbol which represents an intangible reality. As defined above, an example would be [[baptism]] in water, representing (and conveying) the [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] of the gift of the [[Holy Spirit]], the [[Forgiveness of Sins]], and membership into the [[Christian church|Church]]. Anointing with [[holy anointing oil]] is another example which is often synonymous with receiving the [[Holy Spirit]] and salvation. Another way of looking at Sacraments is that they are an external and physical sign of the conferral of [[Sanctifying Grace]].<ref>Catholic Encyclopaedia: \"Sacraments\" http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13295a.htm</ref>\n\nThroughout the Christian faith, views concerning which rites are sacramental, that is conferring [[sanctifying grace]], and what it means for an external act to be sacramental vary widely. Other religious traditions also have what might be called \"sacraments\" in a sense, though not necessarily according to the Christian meaning of the term.\n\n;General definitions and terms\nIn the majority of Western Christianity, the generally accepted definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign that conveys spiritual [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] through Christ. Christian [[Church body|churches]], [[religious denomination|denominations]], and [[sect]]s are divided regarding the number and operation of the sacraments. Sacraments are generally held to have been instituted by [[Jesus Christ]], although in some cases this point is debated. They are usually administered by the [[clergy]] to a recipient or recipients, and are generally understood to involve visible and invisible components. The invisible component (manifested inwardly) is understood to be brought about by the action of the Holy Spirit, [[God]]'s grace working in the sacrament's participants, while the visible (or outward) component entails the use of such things as water, oil, and bread and wine that is blessed or [[Consecration|consecrated]]; the laying-on-of-hands; or a particularly significant covenant that is marked by a public benediction (such as with marriage or absolution of sin in the reconciliation of a penitent).\n\nAs defined by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], recognised by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox churches]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], (though these two do not categorically define the number), and [[Independent Catholic Churches|Independent Catholic]] and [[Old Catholic Church]].\n\nThe Orthodox Churches (Eastern and Oriental) typically do not limit the number of sacraments, viewing all encounters with reality in life as sacramental in some sense, and their acknowledgement of the number of sacraments at seven as an innovation of convenience not found in the [[Church Fathers]]. It came into use, although infrequently, later on from later encounters with the West and its Sacramental Theology.<ref>The Sacraments http://www.oca.org/QA.asp?ID=122&SID=3</ref> Other denominations and traditions, both in eastern and western Christianity may affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments, these include many of the [[Protestant]] denominations and some of the [[Old Believers]] in the Orthodox communion, some of whom reject all sacraments except Baptism.\n\nSince some post-Reformation denominations do not regard clergy as having a classically [[sacerdotalism|sacerdotal]] or priestly function, they avoid the term \"sacrament,\" preferring the terms \"sacerdotal function,\" \"ordinance,\" or \"tradition.\" This belief invests the efficacy of the ''ordinance'' in the obedience and participation of the believer and the witness of the presiding minister and the congregation. This view stems from a highly developed concept of the [[priesthood of all believers]]. In this sense, the believer himself or herself performs the sacerdotal role {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.\n\n====Eucharist====\n{{Main|Eucharist}}\n* [[Transsubstantiation]] (Roman Catholicism)\n* [[Anglican Eucharistic theology]]\n* [[Sacramental Union]] (Lutheran)\n\nEucharist, also called Communion, or the Lord's Supper, and other names, is a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[sacrament]] or [[Ordinance (Christian)|ordinance]], generally considered to be a re-enactment of the [[Last Supper]], the final meal that [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] shared with his disciples before his arrest and eventual [[crucifixion]]. The consecration of bread and a cup within the [[rite]] recalls the moment at the Last Supper when Jesus gave his disciples bread, saying, \"This is my body\", and wine, saying, \"This is my blood\".<ref name=\"EB-purgatory\"/><ref>Ignazio Silone, ''Bread and Wine'' (1937).</ref>\n\nThere are different interpretations of the significance of the Eucharist, but \"there is more of a consensus among Christians about the meaning of the Eucharist than would appear from the confessional debates over the sacramental presence, the effects of the Eucharist, and the proper auspices under which it may be celebrated.\"<ref name=EB-Eucharist>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9033174/Eucharist |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, s.v.

Broadly speaking, it is the study of the destiny of man as revealed in the [[Bible]].\n\nEschatology is concerned with the [[afterlife]], beginning with [[death]] and the personal [[judgment]] which follows the death of the individual, and which is followed by the destination of [[heaven]] or [[hell]]. (In Catholic theology, heaven is sometimes preceded by [[purgatory]].) Eschatology also concerns itself with events which are said to happen at the end of this age: the [[Second Coming|return of Jesus]], the [[resurrection of the dead]], the [[Rapture]], the [[Tribulation]], and following these things, the Millennium, or thousand years of peace, which has been interpreted both literally and symbolically. Finally, eschatology concerns itself with the [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]] and its associated events: the [[Last Judgment]]; the banishment of Death, Hades, and Satan and his followers to the Lake of Fire; and the creation of a new heaven and earth. [[Millennarianism|Millenarianists]], [[Millerism|Seventh Day Adventists]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and other recently founded sects have been influential in the modern development of these doctrines, though their roots are biblical.\n\nEschatology is an ancient branch of study in Christian theology, with study of the \"last things\" and the [[Second Coming of Christ]] first touched on by [[Ignatius of Antioch]] (c. 35\u2013107 AD), then given more consideration by the Christian apologist in Rome, [[St Justin Martyr|Justin Martyr]] (c. 100\u2013165). Treatment of eschatology continued in the West in the teachings of the influential theologian of Roman North Africa, [[Tertullian]] (c. 160\u2013225), and was given fuller reflection and speculation soon after in the East by the master theologian, [[Origen]] (c. 185\u2013254).<ref>Alexander Roberts & James Donaldson, eds. ''Ante-Nicene Fathers.'' (16 vol.) Peabody, Massachusetts: Hendrickson, 1994. The writings of Ignatius and Justin Martyr can be found in Vol. 1; Tertullian, in Volumes 3\u20134; and Origen, in Volume 4.</ref>\n\n[[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]], and other 16th-century reformers wrote long tracts about the End Times, but interest in eschatology dwindled after the Reformation until the late 19th century, when it became popular in the Reformed, Pentecostal, and Evangelical sects. It was increasingly recognized as a formal division of theological study during the 20th century.\n\nThe second coming of Christ is the central event in Christian eschatology. Most Christians believe that death and suffering will continue to exist until Christ's return. Others believe that suffering will gradually be eliminated prior to his coming, and that the elimination of injustice is our part in preparing for that event. Needless to say, there are a variety of viewpoints concerning the order and significance of eschatological events.\n\n===Approaches to interpretation===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\n* The ''[[Preterism|Preterist]]'' approach (from the Latin ''praeteritus'' \"gone by\") seeks parallels between ''Revelation'' and the events of the 1st century, such as [[Herod the Great|Herod]]'s attempt to [[Massacre of the Innocents|kill the infant Christ]], the struggle of Christianity to survive the persecutions of Judaism and the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|fall of Jerusalem]] in 70 AD, the [[Abomination of Desolation|desecration of the temple]] in the same year, and the growth of Christianity from a sect within Judaism to an independent religion.\n* The ''[[Historicism (Christian eschatology)|Historicist]]'' method takes a broader historical approach and seeks parallels between ''Revelation'' and the major people and events of history, especially those which have had a direct effect on [[Israel]] and the Church.\n* The ''[[Futurism (Christian eschatology)|Futurist]]'' method approaches ''Revelation'' as chiefly referring to events that have not yet come to pass but will take place at the end of this age and at the end of the world. The main focus is the return of Christ. \n* The ''[[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|Idealist]]'' model, also known as ''Spiritualist'' or ''Symbolic'' model, approaches the images of ''Revelation'' as symbols representing larger themes and concepts, rather than actual people and events. It sees in Revelation an allegorical representation of the ongoing struggle of the forces of light and darkness, and the ultimate [[triumph of good over evil]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n* [[Biblical law in Christianity]]\n* [[Eastern Orthodox \u2013 Roman Catholic theological differences]]\n* [[Outline of theology]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Berkhof |first=Louis. |title=The History of Christian Doctrine |publisher=Banner of Truth |year=1996 |isbn=0-85151-005-1}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Demarest|first=Bruce A. |title=The Cross and Salvation: The Doctrine of Salvation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0_1wAEACAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Crossway Books|isbn=978-0-89107-937-8}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=|last=Edwards|first=Mark|year=2009|title=Catholicity and Heresy in the Early Church|publisher=Ashgate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9acTl-jAkAC|isbn=9780754662914}}\n* {{cite book |last=Hill |first=Jonathan |year=2003 |title=The History of Christian Thought |isbn=0-7459-5093-0}}\n** Volume 1: ''The Living God'' (1992). {{ISBN|0-06-066363-4}}\n** Volume 2: ''The Word of Life'' (1992). {{ISBN|0-06-066364-2}}\n** Volume 3: ''Life in the Spirit'' (1994). {{ISBN|0-06-066362-6}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kang|first=Paul ChulHong |title=Justification: The Imputation of Christ's Righteousness from Reformation Theology to the American Great Awakening and the Korean Revivals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNIpgIkTMHIC|year=2006|publisher=[[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang]]|isbn=978-0-8204-8605-5|location=New York}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Lange|first=Lyle W. |title=God So Loved the World: A Study of Christian Doctrine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5W0yOQAACAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Northwestern Publishing House|location=Milwaukee|isbn=978-0-8100-1744-3}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Luther|first=Martin |authorlink=Martin Luther|translator-first=Henry |translator-last=Cole|title=Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will: Written in Answer to the Diatribe of Erasmus on Free-will.
