This realization made her strive to make a difference in the lives of these individuals.\n\nIn 1962, she accepted a position at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] School of Medicine. There, Elisabeth was a junior faculty member and gave her first interview of a young terminally ill woman in front of a roomful of medical students. Her intentions were not to be an example of pathology, but K\u00fcbler-Ross wanted to depict a human being who desired to be understood as she was coping with her illness and how it has impacted her life. <ref name=\":1\" /> She states to her students,<blockquote>\"Now you are reacting like human beings instead of scientists.

She sometimes questioned the practices of traditional [[psychiatry]] that she observed. She also undertook 39 months of classical [[psychoanalysis]] training in Chicago. She became an instructor at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Pritzker School of Medicine]] where she began to conduct a regular weekly educational seminar that consisted of live interviews with terminally ill patients. She had her students participate in these despite a large amount of resistance from the medical staff.<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nA Life magazine ran an article on K\u00fcbler-Ross in November 1969, bringing public awareness to her work outside of the medical community. The response was enormous and influenced K\u00fcbler-Ross\u2019s decision to focus on her career on working with the terminally ill and their families. The intense scrutiny her work received also had an impact on her career path. K\u00fcbler-Ross stopped teaching at the university to work privately on what she called the \u201cgreatest mystery in science\u201d\u2014death.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/scientist/elisabeth-kubler-ross}}</ref>\n\n==Healing Center==\nK\u00fcbler-Ross encouraged the [[hospice care]] movement, believing that [[euthanasia]] prevents people from completing their 'unfinished business'{{citation needed|reason=No reference provided|date=November 2014}}.\n\nIn 1977 she persuaded her husband to buy forty acres of land in [[Escondido, California]], near San Diego, where she founded \"[[Shanti Nilaya]]\" (Home of Peace). She intended it as a healing center for the dying and their families. She was also a co-founder of the [[American Holistic Medical Association]].\n\nIn the late 1970s, she became interested in [[out-of-body experiences]], [[mediumship]], [[spiritualism]], and other ways of attempting to contact the dead. This led to a scandal connected to the Shanti Nilaya Healing Center, in which she was duped by [[Jay Barham]], founder of the Church of the Facet of the Divinity. Claiming he could [[channeling (mediumistic)|channel]] the spirits of the departed and summon ethereal \"entities\", he encouraged church members to engage in sexual relations with the \"spirits\". He may have hired several women to play the parts of female spirits for this purpose.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074920,00.html Sex, Visitors from the Grave, Psychic Healing: Kubler-Ross Is a Public Storm Center Again] by Karen G.

Her reputation began to decline when she began researching the controversial subject of near-death experiences. Elisabeth was also an advocate for spiritual guides and afterlife,<ref name=\":1\" /> serving on the Advisory Board of the International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS)<ref name=\":0\" /> Elisabeth reported her interviews for the first time in her book, [[On Death and Dying]]: ''What the dying have to teach doctors, nurses, clergy, and their own families'' (1969)<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_KHpHlsAM4 ''Video: Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross \u00fcber Nahtoderfahrungen (1981) ''], abgerufen am 14.

This was inspired by the aid-project of British doctor [[Cicely Saunders]]. Elisabeth attempted to do this in 1985 in Virginia, but local residents feared the possibility of infection and blocked the necessary re-zoning. In 1994, she lost her house and possessions to an arson fire that is suspected to have been set by opponents of her AIDS work.<ref>[http://www.kinofenster.de/filmeundthemen/neuimkino/archiv_neuimkino/elisabeth_kueblerross_dem_tod_ins_gesicht_sehen_film/ Kinofenster.de] {{in lang|de}}</ref>\n\nShe conducted many workshops on [[AIDS]] in different parts of the world. In 1990, she moved the Healing Center to her own farm in [[Head Waters, Virginia]], to reduce her extensive traveling.\n\n==Death==\nK\u00fcbler-Ross suffered a series of strokes in 1995 which left her partially paralyzed on her left side, in the meantime Shanti Nilaya Healing Center closed. She found herself living in a wheelchair, slowly waiting for death to come, and wished to be able to determine her time of death.<ref>Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, On life After Death, Foreword by Caroline Myss p.vii. Celestial Arts. {{ISBN|9781587613180}}</ref>. Further, in a 2002 interview with ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'', she stated that she was ready for death and even welcomed it, calling God a \"damned procrastinator\"<ref name=\":0\" />. Elisabeth died in 2004 at a nursing home in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], in the presence of her son, daughter, and two family friends.<ref name=\":0\" />  She was buried at the Paradise Memorial Gardens Cemetery.\n\n== Contributions ==\nElisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross was the first individual to transfigure the way that the world looks at the terminally ill, she pioneered hospice-care and near-death research, and was the first to bring terminally ill individuals' lives to the public eye.<ref name=\":1\" /> Elisabeth was the driving force behind the movement for doctors and nurses alike to \u201ctreat the dying with dignity\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />  Her extensive work with the dying led to the internationally best-selling book [[On Death and Dying]] in 1969, she proposed the, now famous, [[Five Stages of Grief]] as a pattern of adjustment: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. In general, individuals experience most of these stages when faced with their imminent death. The five stages have since been adopted by bereavement as applying to the survivors of a loved one's death as well alike.\n\nElisabeth wrote over 20 books on death and dying. <ref name=\":0\" /> At the end of her life she was mentally active, co-authoring a book with [[David Kessler (writer)|David Kessler]] on grief and grieving.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n*''On Death & Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1969\n*''Questions & Answers on Death & Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1972\n*''Death: The Final Stage of Growth'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1974\n* ''Questions and Answers on Death and Dying: A Memoir of Living and Dying'', Macmillan, 1976. {{ISBN|0-02-567120-0}}.\n*''To Live Until We Say Goodbye'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1978\n*''The Dougy Letter -A Letter to a Dying Child'', (Celestial Arts/Ten Speed Press), 1979\n*''Quest, Biography of EKR (Written with Derek Gill)'', (Harper & Row), 1980\n*''Working It Through'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1981\n*''Living with Death & Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1981\n*''Remember the Secret'', (Celestial Arts/Ten Speed Press), 1981\n*''On Children & Death'', (Simon & Schuster), 1985\n*''AIDS: The Ultimate Challenge'', (Simon & Schuster), 1988\n*''On Life After Death'', (Celestial Arts), 1991\n*''Death Is of Vital Importance'', (Out of Print- Now ''The Tunnel and the Light''), 1995\n*''Unfolding the Wings of Love'' (Germany only - Silberschnur), 1996\n*''Making the Most of the Inbetween'', (Various Foreign), 1996\n*''AIDS & Love'', The Conference in Barcelona, (Spain), 1996\n*''Longing to Go Back Home'', (Germany only - Silberschnur), 1997\n* ''Working It Through: An Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross Workshop on Life, Death, and Transition'', Simon & Schuster, 1997. {{ISBN|0-684-83942-3}}.\n*''The Wheel of Life: A Memoir of Living and Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Scribner), 1997\n*''Why Are We Here'', (Germany only - Silberschnur), 1999\n*''The Tunnel and the Light'', (Avalon), 1999\n*''Life Lessons: Two Experts on Death and Dying Teach Us About the Mysteries of Life and Living'', with [[David Kessler (writer)|David Kessler]], Scribner, 2001. {{ISBN|0-684-87074-6}}.\n* ''On Grief and Grieving: Finding the Meaning of Grief Through the Five Stages of Loss'', with [[David Kessler (writer)|David Kessler]].

She sometimes questioned the practices of traditional [[psychiatry]] that she observed. She also undertook 39 months of classical [[psychoanalysis]] training in Chicago. She became an instructor at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Pritzker School of Medicine]] where she began to conduct a regular weekly educational seminar that consisted of live interviews with terminally ill patients. She had her students participate in these despite a large amount of resistance from the medical staff.<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nA Life magazine ran an article on K\u00fcbler-Ross in November 1969, bringing public awareness to her work outside of the medical community. The response was enormous and influenced K\u00fcbler-Ross\u2019s decision to focus on her career on working with the terminally ill and their families. The intense scrutiny her work received also had an impact on her career path. K\u00fcbler-Ross stopped teaching at the university to work privately on what she called the \u201cgreatest mystery in science\u201d\u2014death.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/scientist/elisabeth-kubler-ross}}</ref>\n\n==Healing Center==\nK\u00fcbler-Ross encouraged the [[hospice care]] movement, believing that [[euthanasia]] prevents people from completing their 'unfinished business'{{citation needed|reason=No reference provided|date=November 2014}}.\n\nIn 1977 she persuaded her husband to buy forty acres of land in [[Escondido, California]], near San Diego, where she founded \"[[Shanti Nilaya]]\" (Home of Peace). She intended it as a healing center for the dying and their families. She was also a co-founder of the [[American Holistic Medical Association]].\n\nIn the late 1970s, she became interested in [[out-of-body experiences]], [[mediumship]], [[spiritualism]], and other ways of attempting to contact the dead. This led to a scandal connected to the Shanti Nilaya Healing Center, in which she was duped by [[Jay Barham]], founder of the Church of the Facet of the Divinity. Claiming he could [[channeling (mediumistic)|channel]] the spirits of the departed and summon ethereal \"entities\", he encouraged church members to engage in sexual relations with the \"spirits\". He may have hired several women to play the parts of female spirits for this purpose.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074920,00.html Sex, Visitors from the Grave, Psychic Healing: Kubler-Ross Is a Public Storm Center Again] by Karen G.

Her reputation began to decline when she began researching the controversial subject of near-death experiences. Elisabeth was also an advocate for spiritual guides and afterlife,<ref name=\":1\" /> serving on the Advisory Board of the International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS)<ref name=\":0\" /> Elisabeth reported her interviews for the first time in her book, [[On Death and Dying]]: ''What the dying have to teach doctors, nurses, clergy, and their own families'' (1969)<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_KHpHlsAM4 ''Video: Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross \u00fcber Nahtoderfahrungen (1981) ''], abgerufen am 14.

This was inspired by the aid-project of British doctor [[Cicely Saunders]]. Elisabeth attempted to do this in 1985 in Virginia, but local residents feared the possibility of infection and blocked the necessary re-zoning. In 1994, she lost her house and possessions to an arson fire that is suspected to have been set by opponents of her AIDS work.<ref>[http://www.kinofenster.de/filmeundthemen/neuimkino/archiv_neuimkino/elisabeth_kueblerross_dem_tod_ins_gesicht_sehen_film/ Kinofenster.de] {{in lang|de}}</ref>\n\nShe conducted many workshops on [[AIDS]] in different parts of the world. In 1990, she moved the Healing Center to her own farm in [[Head Waters, Virginia]], to reduce her extensive traveling.\n\n==Death==\nK\u00fcbler-Ross suffered a series of strokes in 1995 which left her partially paralyzed on her left side, in the meantime Shanti Nilaya Healing Center closed. She found herself living in a wheelchair, slowly waiting for death to come, and wished to be able to determine her time of death.<ref>Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, On life After Death, Foreword by Caroline Myss p.vii. Celestial Arts. {{ISBN|9781587613180}}</ref>. Further, in a 2002 interview with ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'', she stated that she was ready for death and even welcomed it, calling God a \"damned procrastinator\"<ref name=\":0\" />. Elisabeth died in 2004 at a nursing home in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], in the presence of her son, daughter, and two family friends.<ref name=\":0\" />  She was buried at the Paradise Memorial Gardens Cemetery.\n\n== Contributions ==\nElisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross was the first individual to transfigure the way that the world looks at the terminally ill, she pioneered hospice-care and near-death research, and was the first to bring terminally ill individuals' lives to the public eye.<ref name=\":1\" /> Elisabeth was the driving force behind the movement for doctors and nurses alike to \u201ctreat the dying with dignity\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />  Her extensive work with the dying led to the internationally best-selling book [[On Death and Dying]] in 1969, she proposed the, now famous, [[Five Stages of Grief]] as a pattern of adjustment: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. In general, individuals experience most of these stages when faced with their imminent death. The five stages have since been adopted by bereavement as applying to the survivors of a loved one's death as well alike.\n\nElisabeth wrote over 20 books on death and dying. <ref name=\":0\" /> At the end of her life she was mentally active, co-authoring a book with [[David Kessler (writer)|David Kessler]] on grief and grieving.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n*''On Death & Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1969\n*''Questions & Answers on Death & Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1972\n*''Death: The Final Stage of Growth'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1974\n* ''Questions and Answers on Death and Dying: A Memoir of Living and Dying'', Macmillan, 1976. {{ISBN|0-02-567120-0}}.\n*''To Live Until We Say Goodbye'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1978\n*''The Dougy Letter -A Letter to a Dying Child'', (Celestial Arts/Ten Speed Press), 1979\n*''Quest, Biography of EKR (Written with Derek Gill)'', (Harper & Row), 1980\n*''Working It Through'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1981\n*''Living with Death & Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1981\n*''Remember the Secret'', (Celestial Arts/Ten Speed Press), 1981\n*''On Children & Death'', (Simon & Schuster), 1985\n*''AIDS: The Ultimate Challenge'', (Simon & Schuster), 1988\n*''On Life After Death'', (Celestial Arts), 1991\n*''Death Is of Vital Importance'', (Out of Print- Now ''The Tunnel and the Light''), 1995\n*''Unfolding the Wings of Love'' (Germany only - Silberschnur), 1996\n*''Making the Most of the Inbetween'', (Various Foreign), 1996\n*''AIDS & Love'', The Conference in Barcelona, (Spain), 1996\n*''Longing to Go Back Home'', (Germany only - Silberschnur), 1997\n* ''Working It Through: An Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross Workshop on Life, Death, and Transition'', Simon & Schuster, 1997. {{ISBN|0-684-83942-3}}.\n*''The Wheel of Life: A Memoir of Living and Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Scribner), 1997\n*''Why Are We Here'', (Germany only - Silberschnur), 1999\n*''The Tunnel and the Light'', (Avalon), 1999\n*''Life Lessons: Two Experts on Death and Dying Teach Us About the Mysteries of Life and Living'', with [[David Kessler (writer)|David Kessler]], Scribner, 2001. {{ISBN|0-684-87074-6}}.\n* ''On Grief and Grieving: Finding the Meaning of Grief Through the Five Stages of Loss'', with [[David Kessler (writer)|David Kessler]].

In 2005 the sculptor [[Arnaldo Pomodoro]] invited Nurcis to take part to ''La scultura italiana del XX secolo'', a group show that inaugurated the Arnaldo Pomodoro Foundation in Milan, focused on the works of the most important Italian sculptors of the century, such as [[Adolfo Wildt]], [[Giacomo Balla]], [[Marino Marini]], [[Mario Merz]], [[Luciano Fabro]], [[Enzo Cucchi]] and others<ref>Pomodoro, Arnaldo; Meneguzzo, Marco (2005).

In 2017 the museum director Gianluca Marziani<ref>[http://www.gianlucamarziani.com Gianluca Marziani Official Web Site]</ref> organized a retrospective of Nurcis' works, from 1981 to present days, at the Palazzo Collicola Arti Visive museum in Spoleto, Umbria, occupying three floors of the museum. \n\nRecurring features of the work of Nurcis are the post-conceptual attitude towards art and the manic nature of his craftsmanship<ref>Altea, Giuliana; Magnani, Marco (1998). \u201cSardegna oggi\u201d. ''Flash Art'' n. 212. Milan: Giancarlo Politi Editore. p. 112.</ref>. Nurcis considers the classical conceptual approach developed by contemporary artists during the 20<sup>th</sup> century to be obsolete<ref>\"Andrea Nurcis. Intervista con Simona Rossi\". Milan: ''That's Art'' n. 23, August-September 2001. p. 89.</ref>, and prefers to talk about his working method as being similar to that of a poet<ref>Perra, ''Artribune''.</ref><ref>Guercini, Maurizio (1992). ''Poesie oscure''. Rome: Scettro del Re. OCLC 31226999. p. 28.</ref>: just as the poet aligns words disconnected from discursive syntax and even from grammatical logic, the artist works by accumulation of formal and plastic elements, often juxtaposed according to the artist\u2019s casual logic or pure unconscious improvisation<ref>Borsato, Sonia (2011). ''Generazioni Glocal''. Villanova Monteleone: Soter. {{ISBN|8888915834}}. p. 25.</ref>. His manic execution often manifests itself in the obsessive execution of pen drawings in various formats<ref>Marziani, Gianluca (2003). ''Melting Pop''. Milan: Silvana Editoriale. {{ISBN|9788882155483}}. pp.16,17.</ref>, or in the tiny details with which he covers his sculptures, even those of monumental dimensions<ref>Marziani, Gianluca (2016). ''Close up''. Imola: Maretti editore. {{ISBN|889885563X}}. pp. 208-211.</ref>.\n\n== Works ==\n=== The ''Black Drawings'' series (1981\u2013present) ===\nThe ''Untitled'' series of drawings, also called the ''Black Drawings'' series<ref>Marziani, Gianluca (April 10, 2004). \u201cL\u2019arte futura riscopre carta e matita\u201d, in ''Lo Specchio'', ''La Stampa'', Turin. p. 91.</ref>, is based on a continual production process of drawings made in ballpoint pen on small sheets of paper (each about 19x14 cm) that the artist has undertaken to draw, starting in 1981, for the rest of his life. The project foresaw that Nurcis create a drawing every night, struggling against sleep and concentrating on work with such tension as to almost destroy the sheet of paper on which the drawing was executed; within the limits of the possible imposed by the course of events, Nurcis has tried to remain faithful to his original purpose. Over time, the usual ballpoint pen ink technique on paper has been enriched with tempera, acrylic, gold or silver leaf inserts. The ''Black Drawings'' series today consists of several thousand works \u2013 all owned by the artist \u2013 which he exhibits in blocks but has never proposed to the public in its entirety. Nurcis has also prepared a contract that would commit a collector to buying the ''Black Drawings'' all together, including those still to be realised<ref>''That's Art'' n. 23. p. 90.</ref>. \n\n=== ''No Light'' (1995\u2013present) ===\n''No Light'' is a work of digital video art created in collaboration with the artist Enrico Corte<ref>Marziani, Gianluca (2008). ''Enrico Corte \u2013 Spectrospective''. Bologna: Damiani. {{ISBN|9788862080064}}. pp. 51-54.</ref>. It is a 30-minute narrative video representing a dialogue in alternating scenes between two characters: a small Demon, interpreted by Corte with the use of digital animation techniques, and a Hermit, played by Nurcis. Nurcis created his Hermit costume by hand and sometimes exhibits it as a sculptural work. ''No Light'' includes scenography and props made by Nurcis and Corte; the artists have exhibited these works separately from the video. A series of stills taken from the video was selected by Corte and Nurcis and exhibited in the form of photographic prints of varying sizes, even composing them as large-format environmental installations. The continual reworking of images, plastic objects, costumes and scenery \u2013 in addition to a series of limited-edition gadgets inspired by the video \u2013 over the years to date has allowed the artists to broaden their initial inspiration and provide new keys to the reading of ''No Light'', inserting the video in a context of a multimedia nature.\n\n=== ''Homevideo'' (1997) ===\n''Homevideo'' is a digital video art work created in collaboration with Enrico Corte<ref>Marziani, Gianluca (2008). ''Enrico Corte \u2013 Spectrospective''. Bologna: Damiani. {{ISBN|9788862080064}}. pp. 54-55.</ref>. For this project Nurcis and Corte invited a series of friends, residing in the Roman area, to visit in turn the artists\u2019 house-studio, located on the outskirts of Rome. Each guest had to choose a room of the house-studio to \u201cstage\u201d an existential narration based on improvisation; Nurcis and Corte, without interacting with the guest, filmed the action with a 35mm camera. The project also stipulated that when all the rooms of the house-studio had been occupied by the various guests over time, and all the filming had been completed, Nurcis and Corte would sell the house and move elsewhere. Although there are several hours of film, the artists have so far screened only a partial editing of 33 minutes of the video, that includes music written for the occasion, arthouse film sequences, and television broadcasts clips that complete their narrative project; in this form, ''Homevideo'' was presented at ''Corto Circuito'' film festival at the Royal Palace of Naples, directed by Franz Cerami in 1998<ref>Cerami, Franz (1998). ''Corto Circuito, quarta edizione''. Naples: CUEN. Biblioteca Nazionale di Napoli, SBN NAP0327712. p. 29.</ref> and in the Italian Pavilion of the 48<sup>th</sup> Venice Biennale, directed by Harald Szeemann in 1999<ref>Szeemann, Harald, et al. (1999). ''Cat. 48. Esposizione Internazionale d\u2019Arte: dAPERTutto''. Venice: Marsilio. {{ISBN|8820804131}}.</ref>.\n\n=== ''Pino Piercing Wears a Sculpture'' (1997) ===\nIn February 1997 Andrea Nurcis, together with the artist Enrico Corte, was invited by the art dealer Anna D\u2019Ascanio to present their double solo exhibition in her gallery in Rome<ref>Marziani, Gianluca (2008). ''Enrico Corte \u2013 Spectrospective''. Bologna: Damiani. {{ISBN|9788862080064}}. p. 48.</ref>. Each of the two artists proposed a series of works on paper to be exhibited on two adjacent walls, while in the center of the gallery they placed a metal sculpture made by the two of them in 1996. The sculpture was designed by Corte and Nurcis to be \u201cworn\u201d by a friend of theirs known under the pseudonym of Pino Piercing, one of the first professional piercers in the Roman area of the \u201890s, who worked mainly in the alternative social centers. In practice, each pointed protuberance from the central body of the sculpture was designed to penetrate the various parts of Pino\u2019s body where he already had piercings. On the evening of the inauguration, the two artists filmed a 20-minute video entitled ''Pino Piercing Wears a Sculpture by Enrico Corte and Andrea Nurcis''<ref>[https://vimeo.com/210063295 ''Pino Piercing Wears a Sculpture'' on vimeo.com]</ref>, which today also appears as a sort of document of the artistic scene of the Capital, as in the audience there are various representatives of the world of art, literature, cinema, music and even high-level prostitution from the early \u201890s. Nurcis and Corte, with that particular event \u2013 which combined design, sculpture and post-human performance art \u2013 intended to renew the traditional, official environment of the art galleries of Rome, of which the D\u2019Ascanio gallery was one of the representatives<ref>Marziani, p. 48.</ref>, bringing to the inauguration the \u201ccountercultural\u201d world of the alternative social centers, from which many of the visitors to the exhibition came to celebrate their friend Pino.\n\n=== ''Koprospheros'' (2005) ===\n''Koprospheros'' is the title of a 3 meter high sculpture made by Nurcis in fiberglass, polyester and synthetic plaster. It exemplifies the artist\u2019s interest in the human figure in its physical imperfections and genetic deformations, as well as his humanistic syncretism through the contamination between various mythological (the classical myth of Atlas), naturalistic (the reference to the [[dung beetle]] and its ball of excrement \u2013 and its capacity to orient itself using the Milky Way's band of light<ref>[https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2013/01/24/dung-beetles-navigate-via-the-milky-way-first-known-in-animal-kingdom/ National Geographic, 2013]</ref>) and philosophical themes (the texts of the contemporary German philosopher [[Peter Sloterdijk]], in particular the so-called ''Sph\u00e4ren trilogy'' made up of ''Blasen'', 1998, ''Globen'', 1999, and ''Sch\u00e4ume'', 2004). The work was selected by the sculptor Arnaldo Pomodoro and by the critic Marco Meneguzzo for the ''Italian Sculpture of the Twentieth Century'' exhibition at the Arnaldo Pomodoro Foundation in Milan in 2005. The show was intended as a historical survey of the most important sculptors of the 20<sup>th</sup> century at a national level and included works by [[Medardo Rosso]], [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Lucio Fontana]], [[Alberto Burri]], [[Pino Pascali]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Gilberto Zorio]], [[Giuseppe Penone]], [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]], [[Mimmo Paladino]], [[Maurizio Cattelan]], and others.\n\n=== ''Ghost Painting'' (2017) ===\n''Ghost Painting'' is a painting of 250x300x10 cm created by Nurcis in tempera and oil on wood with three-dimensional inserts in polyester resin. In this work the relationship between painting and sculpture, which the artist often fuses in the same creation, appears clearly. The classical quadrangular shape of the \u201cpainting\u201d is itself violated by the irregularity of the contours of the work. ''Ghost Painting'' is based on the concept of \u201cstratification\u201d<ref>A conversation between Cristiana Perrella and Andrea Nurcis (2003). Cat. ''Andrea Nurcis''. Rome: 2RC Edizioni d'Arte. p. 6. Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Roma, inv. 003835595/1v.</ref>, that is, of indefinite accumulation of pictorial levels: each successive layer deletes partly the previous one except for some details that continue to emerge according to the artist\u2019s calculation that also includes a certain quotient of randomness. The work was selected by the critic and museum director Gianluca Marziani to be included in the double retrospective of Nurcis and Corte, entitled ''Excerpt\u24b6'', at the Palazzo Collicola Arti Visive museum in Spoleto<ref>Perra, ''Artribune''.</ref> between December 2017 and March 2018.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}  <!--- This makes all the footnotes list here --->\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.andreanurcis.net/ Andrea Nurcis Official Web Site]\n\n[[Category:Living people]] \n \n[[Category:Italian contemporary artists]] \n \n[[Category:21st-century Italian sculptors]] \n \n[[Category:21st-century Italian painters]] \n \n[[Category:video artists]]\n \n[[Category:Postmodern artists]] \n \n[[Category:People from Cagliari]]\n \n[[Category:People from Rome]]\n\n<!--- Add categories as needed: [[Category:Women artists]]  [[Category:2015 deaths]] \n\n[[Category:1962 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Italian contemporary artists]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian sculptors]]\n[[Category:21st-century Italian sculptors]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian painters]]\n[[Category:21st-century Italian painters]]\n[[Category:Video artists]]\n[[Category:Postmodern artists]]\n[[Category:People from Cagliari]]\n[[Category:Women artists]]\n[[Category:1900 births]]\n[[Category:2015 deaths]] --->\n\n<!--- Add stub tags as needed:{{US-artist-stub}}\n\n{{US-painter-stub}}--->\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox artist\n| name             = Andrea Nurcis\n| image            = Andrea Nurcis-2.jpeg\n| image_size       = \n| caption          = Andrea Nurcis in 2015.

''Enrico Corte \u2013 Spectrospective''. Bologna: Damiani. {{ISBN|9788862080064}}. p. 48.</ref>. Each of the two artists proposed a series of works on paper to be exhibited on two adjacent walls, while in the center of the gallery they placed a metal sculpture made by the two of them in 1996. The sculpture was designed by Corte and Nurcis to be \u201cworn\u201d by a friend of theirs known under the pseudonym of Pino Piercing, one of the first professional piercers in the Roman area of the \u201890s, who worked mainly in the alternative social centers. In practice, each pointed protuberance from the central body of the sculpture was designed to penetrate the various parts of Pino\u2019s body where he already had piercings. On the evening of the inauguration, the two artists filmed a 20-minute video entitled ''Pino Piercing Wears a Sculpture by Enrico Corte and Andrea Nurcis''<ref>[https://vimeo.com/210063295 ''Pino Piercing Wears a Sculpture'' on vimeo.com]</ref>, which today also appears as a sort of document of the artistic scene of the Capital, as in the audience there are various representatives of the world of art, literature, cinema, music and even high-level prostitution from the early \u201890s. Nurcis and Corte, with that particular event \u2013 which combined design, sculpture and post-human performance art \u2013 intended to renew the traditional, official environment of the art galleries of Rome, of which the D\u2019Ascanio gallery was one of the representatives<ref>Marziani, p. 48.</ref>, bringing to the inauguration the \u201ccountercultural\u201d world of the alternative social centers, from which many of the visitors to the exhibition came to celebrate their friend Pino.\n\n=== ''Koprospheros'' (2005) ===\n''Koprospheros'' is the title of a 3 meter high sculpture made by Nurcis in fiberglass, polyester and synthetic plaster. It exemplifies the artist\u2019s interest in the human figure in its physical imperfections and genetic deformations, as well as his humanistic syncretism through the contamination between various mythological (the classical myth of Atlas), naturalistic (the reference to the [[dung beetle]] and its ball of excrement \u2013 and its capacity to orient itself using the Milky Way's band of light<ref>[https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2013/01/24/dung-beetles-navigate-via-the-milky-way-first-known-in-animal-kingdom/ National Geographic, 2013]</ref>) and philosophical themes (the texts of the contemporary German philosopher [[Peter Sloterdijk]], in particular the so-called ''Sph\u00e4ren trilogy'' made up of ''Blasen'', 1998, ''Globen'', 1999, and ''Sch\u00e4ume'', 2004). The work was selected by the sculptor Arnaldo Pomodoro and by the critic Marco Meneguzzo for the ''Italian Sculpture of the Twentieth Century'' exhibition at the Arnaldo Pomodoro Foundation in Milan in 2005. The show was intended as a historical survey of the most important sculptors of the 20<sup>th</sup> century at a national level and included works by [[Medardo Rosso]], [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Lucio Fontana]], [[Alberto Burri]], [[Pino Pascali]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Gilberto Zorio]], [[Giuseppe Penone]], [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]], [[Mimmo Paladino]], [[Maurizio Cattelan]], and others.\n\n=== ''Ghost Painting'' (2017) ===\n''Ghost Painting'' is a painting of 250x300x10 cm created by Nurcis in tempera and oil on wood with three-dimensional inserts in polyester resin. In this work the relationship between painting and sculpture, which the artist often fuses in the same creation, appears clearly. The classical quadrangular shape of the \u201cpainting\u201d is itself violated by the irregularity of the contours of the work. ''Ghost Painting'' is based on the concept of \u201cstratification\u201d<ref>A conversation between Cristiana Perrella and Andrea Nurcis (2003). Cat. ''Andrea Nurcis''.

The work was selected by the critic and museum director Gianluca Marziani to be included in the double retrospective of Nurcis and Corte, entitled ''Excerpt\u24b6'', at the Palazzo Collicola Arti Visive museum in Spoleto<ref>Perra, ''Artribune''.</ref> between December 2017 and March 2018.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}  <!--- This makes all the footnotes list here --->\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.andreanurcis.net/ Andrea Nurcis Official Web Site]\n\n[[Category:Living people]] \n \n[[Category:Italian contemporary artists]] \n \n[[Category:21st-century Italian sculptors]] \n \n[[Category:21st-century Italian painters]] \n \n[[Category:video artists]]\n \n[[Category:Postmodern artists]] \n \n[[Category:People from Cagliari]]\n \n[[Category:People from Rome]]\n\n<!--- Add categories as needed: [[Category:Women artists]]  [[Category:2015 deaths]] \n\n[[Category:1962 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Italian contemporary artists]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian sculptors]]\n[[Category:21st-century Italian sculptors]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian painters]]\n[[Category:21st-century Italian painters]]\n[[Category:Video artists]]\n[[Category:Postmodern artists]]\n[[Category:People from Cagliari]]\n[[Category:Women artists]]\n[[Category:1900 births]]\n[[Category:2015 deaths]] --->\n\n<!--- Add stub tags as needed:{{US-artist-stub}}\n\n{{US-painter-stub}}--->\n", "name_user": "Silloge", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed a typo in a book title", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Nurcis"}

The producers derived the title from lines of the song [[Mera Joota hai Japani|Mera joota hai Japani]] from the 1955 Raj Kapoor film [[Shree 420]] (originally written by [[Shailendra (lyricist)|Shailendra]] and composed by [[Shankar Jaikishan|Shankar-Jaikishan]]). [[Aziz Mirza]] directed stars [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]] and [[Juhi Chawla]], focusing on the TV media war. Ajay Bakshi and Ria Banerjee are two television reporters for rival news channels who try to save the life of a man who has been fixed by politicians for the death of his brother, from a death sentence. The film marked the first attempted by Khan, Chawla, and Mirza under their new production company [[Dreamz Unlimited]], now Red Chillies Entertainment. This film won the IIFA Award for Best Special Effects. The film had a few plot points derived from the 1988 movie ''[[Switching Channels]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nAjay Bakshi ([[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]]) is a successful loudmouthed reporter, working for a reputed news channel. The rival news channel ropes in Ria Banerjee ([[Juhi Chawla]]) to bring him down. Ria is the antithesis of Ajay and uses her intelligence, charm and wits to get her work done.\n\nPappu Junior alias Choti ([[Johnny Lever]]) is a don who is to be ousted from his own gang, owing to his inability to make it big in the crime world. Ajay approaches Choti with an offer: arrange a fake attack on minister Ramakant Dua's ([[Shakti Kapoor]]) brother-in-law Madanlal Gupta ([[Mahavir Shah]]), on national TV. Choti will earn respect & Ajay's channel will gain ratings. Little does Ajay know that the plan is going to turn too real.\n\nRamakant Dua's brother-in-law is gunned down by an assailant named Mohan Joshi ([[Paresh Rawal]]). Minister Ramakant takes advantage of his brother-in-law's death to gain votes and sympathy; he also instigates a [[pogrom]] to ensure his position in the government. Ajay and Ria start getting along as they work together to cover the city riots. Mohan is arrested and to avoid public unrest, the Police Commissioner declares that Mohan is a foreign terrorist. Mohan escapes jail and hides in Ajay and Ria's car.\n\nWhen Mohan accosts them, Ajay accuses him of being a terrorist. Mohan yells that he is not and tells the two his story: Mohan had a happy family with a wife ([[Neena Kulkarni]]) and daughter. One day, his daughter went for an interview and Ramakant's brother-in-law raped and beat her. She died from the trauma and as no lawyer was willing to fight the case due to the perpetrator's political power, Mohan was left helpless, running from door to door for justice. Hence hopeless, he took the law into his own hands and killed the rapist.\n\nAjay and Ria decide to help Mohan, who sees them as his own kids and helps them realize their love for each other. Ajay hands over the videotape of Mohan's confession to his boss and uncle Kaka ([[Satish Shah]]). Unfortunately, the minister has joined hands with rival minister Mushran ([[Govind Namdeo]]) as he fears that their secrets might come out if Mohan's truth is revealed. Ajay's boss forms an alliance with Ria's boss Chinoy ([[Dalip Tahil]]). The ministers and channel heads come together and trick Ajay and Ria into giving them the tape.\n\nWhen Mohan is arrested and sentenced to be publicly hanged, Ajay and Ria realize they were tricked. They work together with Choti to get the tape back. Ajay succeeds in broadcasting Mohan's confession just an hour before Mohan's execution and tearfully requests the nation to stop this injustice.\n\nThe ministers and policemen try to prevent the protesters from entering the prison ground but the ACP joins Ajay and Ria, thus neutralizing the police barricades. In a blatant mockery and critique of media's selfish obsession with ratings and views, Mohan is made to wear a shirt sporting logos of sponsors and companies. Seconds before the execution, Ajay saves Mohan and the protesters beat up the politicians and chase them out, ensuring their careers are over.\n\nMohan's execution is called off and the film ends happily as Ria proposes to Ajay, who accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]] as Ajay Bakshi\n* [[Juhi Chawla]] as Ria Banerjee\n* [[Paresh Rawal]] as Mohan Joshi\n* [[Johnny Lever]] as Choti/Pappu Junior\n* [[Atul Parchure]] as Shahid\n* [[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]] as Bomb Defuser\n* [[Sharat Saxena]] as Pappu's boss\n* [[Aanjjan Srivastav]] as Police Commissioner\n* [[Neena Kulkarni]] as Mohan's wife\n* [[Dalip Tahil]] as Chinoy\n* [[Satish Shah]] as Kaka\n* [[Govind Namdeo]] as Chief Minister Mushran\n* [[Shakti Kapoor]] as Minister Ramakant Dua\n* [[Mahavir Shah]] as Ramakant's brother-in-law Madanlal Gupta\n* [[Bharti Achrekar]] as Ria's mother\n* [[Smita Jaykar]] as Ajay's mother\n* [[Vishwajeet Pradhan]] as Head Police inspector\n* [[Dilip Joshi]] as Sapney (Choti's aide)\n* [[Mona Ambegaonkar]] as Shalini (Cameo)\n* [[Haidar Ali (actor)|Hyder Ali]] as Ajay's father\n* [[Pappu Polyester]]\n* Dimple Inamdar\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani\n| type       = Album\n| artist     = [[Jatin Lalit]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 26 November 1999<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/in/album/phir-bhi-dil-hai-hindustani-original-motion-picture/302381521 |title=Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) |publisher=[[iTunes]]}}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n| length     = 33:26\n| label      = [[Sony Music]]\n| producer   = [[Jatin-Lalit]]\n| prev_title = [[Mohabbatein]]\n| prev_year  = 2000\n| next_title = [[Raja Ko Rani Se Pyar Ho Gaya]]\n| next_year  = 2000\n| misc       = {{External media\n| audio1 = {{YouTube|gH-oK9xM3qU|Audio Jukebox}}}}\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = Planet Bollywood\n| rev1score = {{Rating|8.5|10}}<ref name=\"pb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.planetbollywood.com/music/pbdhh.html |title= PBDHH: Music Review by Manish Dhamija  |publisher=Planet Bollywood |date= |accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe music was composed by Jatin Lalit who also composed the background score assisted by brother in law Aadesh Shrivastava.

The producers derived the title from lines of the song [[Mera Joota hai Japani|Mera joota hai Japani]] from the 1955 Raj Kapoor film [[Shree 420]] (originally written by [[Shailendra (lyricist)|Shailendra]] and composed by [[Shankar Jaikishan|Shankar-Jaikishan]]). [[Aziz Mirza]] directed stars [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]] and [[Juhi Chawla]], focusing on the TV media war. Ajay Bakshi and Ria Banerjee are two television reporters for rival news channels who try to save the life of a man who has been fixed by politicians for the death of his brother, from a death sentence. The film marked the first attempted by Khan, Chawla, and Mirza under their new production company [[Dreamz Unlimited]], now Red Chillies Entertainment. This film won the IIFA Award for Best Special Effects. The film had a few plot points derived from the 1988 movie ''[[Switching Channels]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nAjay Bakshi ([[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]]) is a successful loudmouthed reporter, working for a reputed news channel. The rival news channel ropes in Ria Banerjee ([[Juhi Chawla]]) to bring him down. Ria is the antithesis of Ajay and uses her intelligence, charm and wits to get her work done.\n\nPappu Junior alias Choti ([[Johnny Lever]]) is a don who is to be ousted from his own gang, owing to his inability to make it big in the crime world. Ajay approaches Choti with an offer: arrange a fake attack on minister Ramakant Dua's ([[Shakti Kapoor]]) brother-in-law Madanlal Gupta ([[Mahavir Shah]]), on national TV. Choti will earn respect & Ajay's channel will gain ratings. Little does Ajay know that the plan is going to turn too real.\n\nRamakant Dua's brother-in-law is gunned down by an assailant named Mohan Joshi ([[Paresh Rawal]]). Minister Ramakant takes advantage of his brother-in-law's death to gain votes and sympathy; he also instigates a [[pogrom]] to ensure his position in the government. Ajay and Ria start getting along as they work together to cover the city riots. Mohan is arrested and to avoid public unrest, the Police Commissioner declares that Mohan is a foreign terrorist. Mohan escapes jail and hides in Ajay and Ria's car.\n\nWhen Mohan accosts them, Ajay accuses him of being a terrorist. Mohan yells that he is not and tells the two his story: Mohan had a happy family with a wife ([[Neena Kulkarni]]) and daughter. One day, his daughter went for an interview and Ramakant's brother-in-law raped and beat her. She died from the trauma and as no lawyer was willing to fight the case due to the perpetrator's political power, Mohan was left helpless, running from door to door for justice. Hence hopeless, he took the law into his own hands and killed the rapist.\n\nAjay and Ria decide to help Mohan, who sees them as his own kids and helps them realize their love for each other. Ajay hands over the videotape of Mohan's confession to his boss and uncle Kaka ([[Satish Shah]]). Unfortunately, the minister has joined hands with rival minister Mushran ([[Govind Namdeo]]) as he fears that their secrets might come out if Mohan's truth is revealed. Ajay's boss forms an alliance with Ria's boss Chinoy ([[Dalip Tahil]]). The ministers and channel heads come together and trick Ajay and Ria into giving them the tape.\n\nWhen Mohan is arrested and sentenced to be publicly hanged, Ajay and Ria realize they were tricked. They work together with Choti to get the tape back. Ajay succeeds in broadcasting Mohan's confession just an hour before Mohan's execution and tearfully requests the nation to stop this injustice.\n\nThe ministers and policemen try to prevent the protesters from entering the prison ground but the ACP joins Ajay and Ria, thus neutralizing the police barricades. In a blatant mockery and critique of media's selfish obsession with ratings and views, Mohan is made to wear a shirt sporting logos of sponsors and companies. Seconds before the execution, Ajay saves Mohan and the protesters beat up the politicians and chase them out, ensuring their careers are over.\n\nMohan's execution is called off and the film ends happily as Ria proposes to Ajay, who accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]] as Ajay Bakshi\n* [[Juhi Chawla]] as Ria Banerjee\n* [[Paresh Rawal]] as Mohan Joshi\n* [[Johnny Lever]] as Choti/Pappu Junior\n* [[Atul Parchure]] as Shahid\n* [[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]] as Bomb Defuser\n* [[Sharat Saxena]] as Pappu's boss\n* [[Aanjjan Srivastav]] as Police Commissioner\n* [[Neena Kulkarni]] as Mohan's wife\n* [[Dalip Tahil]] as Chinoy\n* [[Satish Shah]] as Kaka\n* [[Govind Namdeo]] as Chief Minister Mushran\n* [[Shakti Kapoor]] as Minister Ramakant Dua\n* [[Mahavir Shah]] as Ramakant's brother-in-law Madanlal Gupta\n* [[Bharti Achrekar]] as Ria's mother\n* [[Smita Jaykar]] as Ajay's mother\n* [[Vishwajeet Pradhan]] as Head Police inspector\n* [[Dilip Joshi]] as Sapney (Choti's aide)\n* [[Mona Ambegaonkar]] as Shalini (Cameo)\n* [[Haidar Ali (actor)|Hyder Ali]] as Ajay's father\n* [[Pappu Polyester]]\n* Dimple Inamdar\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani\n| type       = Album\n| artist     = [[Jatin Lalit]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 26 November 1999<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/in/album/phir-bhi-dil-hai-hindustani-original-motion-picture/302381521 |title=Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) |publisher=[[iTunes]]}}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n| length     = 33:26\n| label      = [[Sony Music]]\n| producer   = [[Jatin-Lalit]]\n| prev_title = [[Mohabbatein]]\n| prev_year  = 2000\n| next_title = [[Raja Ko Rani Se Pyar Ho Gaya]]\n| next_year  = 2000\n| misc       = {{External media\n| audio1 = {{YouTube|gH-oK9xM3qU|Audio Jukebox}}}}\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = Planet Bollywood\n| rev1score = {{Rating|8.5|10}}<ref name=\"pb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.planetbollywood.com/music/pbdhh.html |title= PBDHH: Music Review by Manish Dhamija  |publisher=Planet Bollywood |date= |accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe music was composed by Jatin Lalit who also composed the background score assisted by brother in law Aadesh Shrivastava.
