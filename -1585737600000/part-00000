Promoted as \"the world\u2019s longest art gallery\", the canyon is known for its extensive [[rock art]], most of it created by the [[Fremont culture]] and the [[Ute tribe|Ute]] people. The rock art, shelters, and [[granary|granaries]] left behind by the Fremont make Ninemile Canyon a destination for [[archaeology|archaeologists]] and tourists alike.\n\nThe canyon became a main [[transport corridor]] in the region during the 1880s. Settlers established a number of [[ranch]]es in Ninemile Canyon, and even a short-lived town named [[Harper, Utah|Harper]]. No longer heavily traveled, the rugged canyon road was used mostly for recreation and tourism through the end of the 20th century. The discovery of rich deposits of [[natural gas]] deep beneath the West Tavaputs Plateau has brought an influx of industrial truck traffic since 2002. The large amounts of [[fugitive dust]] produced by the trucks' passage may be damaging the rock art. Public debate is ongoing about how best to balance energy development in the canyon against the preservation of its cultural resources.<ref name=blm/>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Nine Mile Creek at North Franks Canyon, Utah.jpg|thumb|Ninemile Canyon (the dark green area at the bottom) at North Franks Canyon. An array of natural gas wells is visible in the distance, May 2019.]]\n\nNinemile Canyon runs roughly southwest to northeast, with numerous winding turns, just to the north of the [[Book Cliffs]], and south and east of [[Ashley National Forest]]. The full {{convert|78|mi|adj=on}} canyon route, formerly [[Utah State Route 53 (1931-1969)|SR&#8209;53]] through Gate Canyon, connects the towns of [[Wellington, Utah|Wellington]] and [[Myton, Utah|Myton]]. Nine Mile Creek, the [[stream]] that formed the canyon, is by no means a major body of water. Its importance lies in the fact that it is one of the few water sources in the region that are reliable year-round, and it has been so since prehistoric times. Nine Mile Creek is actually a minor [[tributary]] of the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], emptying into [[Desolation Canyon]] on the east. A number of tributary canyons branch off Ninemile Cayon itself, including Argyle Canyon, Cottonwood Canyon, [[Minnie Maud]], and Dry Canyon. Significant rock art sites are frequently located near the junctions where they meet the main canyon.\n\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:HuntSceneNMC.JPG|thumb|left|The famous ''Cottonwood Panel'', also called ''The Great Hunt'', May 2006]]\n\nThere are at least an estimated 1,000 rock art sites in the canyon, with more than 10,000 individual images.<ref name=spangler/>{{rp|141}} The true figures may be ten times as high,<ref name=dirtraker/> but there is no question that rock art is more concentrated here than anywhere else in [[North America]]. Much is in the form of pecked [[petroglyph]]s, and there are many painted [[pictograph]]s as well. Researchers have also identified hundreds of [[pit-house]]s, rock shelters, and [[granary|granaries]], although only a limited amount of [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] has been carried out. Many of these structures are located high above the canyon floor on cliff ledges, pinnacles, and [[mesa]]s. They were built by the Fremont, whose presence in Ninemile Canyon has been dated at AD 950\u20131250. Indeed, Ninemile Canyon was one of the locations most heavily occupied by the Fremont.<ref name=carbon/><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.riversimulator.org/Resources/History/UtahCounties/HistoryOfCarbonCounty1996Watt.pdf|title=A History of Carbon County|last=Watt|first=Ronald G.|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-913738-15-8|location=|pages=14\u201316|format=PDF}}</ref> In contrast to the purely [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures that surrounded them, the Fremont practiced [[agriculture]], growing [[maize|corn]] and [[squash (plant)|squash]] along the canyon bottom. Compared to other Fremont areas, relatively little [[pottery]] is found in Nine Mile, suggesting that [[bean]]s, which must be boiled for hours to become edible, were not an important part of the local diet.<ref name=spangler />{{rp|45}} The Fremont left [[irrigation]] ditches and earthen lodges on the canyon floor that could be seen as late as the 1930s, but are no longer visible after generations of modern cultivation.<ref name=spangler />{{rp|21}}\n\n[[File:Utebison.jpeg|thumb|The prints under this [[bison]]'s hooves indicate Ute origin, November 2007.]]\nBy the 16th century the ancestral Utes were in the canyon. They added to the rock art already on the walls, but in styles of their own. Many scenes, for example, depict Ute hunters on horseback and date to the 1800s. Despite the number of Ute [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] found in Nine Mile, there is no archaeological evidence of any Ute camps or residences.<ref name=spangler />{{rp|55\u201357}}\n\n{{anchor|DuchesneNineMileCanyonARs|CarbonNineMileCanyonARs}}\n\n===Archaeological sites===\n[[File:Redman Village Nine Mile Canyon.jpeg|thumb|left|Stone shelter at Redman Village, April 2007]]\n\nIn 2009, 63 archaeological sites in the canyon were listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]], 36 in Carbon County and 27 in Duchesne County. Most are named in the National Register listing only by their [[Smithsonian trinomial]] codes, but there were three named sites in Carbon County: Cottonwood Village, Drop-Dead Ruin, and First Canyon Site. The named ones in Duchesne County are Centennial House, Fool's Pinnacle, Karen's Cist, Maxies Pad, Nordell's Fort, Redman Village, Sunstone Village, and Taylor's City. The locations and details of these sites are not disclosed by the National Register.<ref name=nrhp1/> The 63 sites include 40 Fremont constructions, 19 rock art sites, and 4 sets of historical-era dwellings.<ref name=nom/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=&itype=ngpsid|title=Utah rock art canyon up for historic designation|last=Stark|first=Mike|date=November 11, 2009|website=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> A further 165 sites were added on September 12, 2012, all of them designated by codes only.

Use of the road surged in 1889 after the discovery of [[Gilsonite]] in the [[Uinta Basin]]. This was the main transportation route in eastern Utah until well into the 20th century. Most of the [[stagecoach]], mail, freight, and [[telegraph]] traffic into the Uinta Basin passed through Ninemile Canyon until after the arrival of the [[Uintah Railway]] around 1905.\n\nThe freight trade led to the settlement of the canyon itself. One of the main stagecoach stops developed into a town of sorts. Called [[Harper, Utah|Harper]], it included a hotel, store, school, and an unofficial post office. It lacked a formal town site, simply taking in a long stretch of scattered ranches and buildings. The community grew gradually from the 1880s until it was officially established as the town of Harper in 1905. The Harper precinct as a whole had a population of 130 at its peak in 1910,<ref name=duchesne/>{{rp|81\u201382}} but in the early 1920s Harper became a [[ghost town]].<ref name=guide/>\n\n==Current issues==\n[[File:Defacedelk.jpeg|thumb|Defaced rock art in Rasmussen Cave, April 2007]]\n\nRock art and other ancient artifacts are now protected by law and, although enforcement is difficult, outright [[looting]] and malicious [[vandalism]] are largely a thing of the past. Ninemile Canyon's rock art, however, is still at risk.

Daddy Canyon area of Ninemile Canyon, November 2007]]\n[[File:NineMileCanyon map.png|thumb|Map of Ninemile Canyon, from [[National Scenic Byway]]s Program]]\n\n'''Ninemile Canyon''' (also '''Nine Mile Canyon''') is a [[canyon]], approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} long, located in [[Carbon County, Utah|Carbon]] and [[Duchesne County, Utah|Duchesne]] counties in eastern [[Utah]], United States. Promoted as \"the world\u2019s longest art gallery\", the canyon is known for its extensive [[rock art]], most of it created by the [[Fremont culture]] and the [[Ute tribe|Ute]] people. The rock art, shelters, and [[granary|granaries]] left behind by the Fremont make Ninemile Canyon a destination for [[archaeology|archaeologists]] and tourists alike.\n\nThe canyon became a main [[transport corridor]] in the region during the 1880s. Settlers established a number of [[ranch]]es in Ninemile Canyon, and even a short-lived town named [[Harper, Utah|Harper]]. No longer heavily traveled, the rugged canyon road was used mostly for recreation and tourism through the end of the 20th century. The discovery of rich deposits of [[natural gas]] deep beneath the West Tavaputs Plateau has brought an influx of industrial truck traffic since 2002. The large amounts of [[fugitive dust]] produced by the trucks' passage may be damaging the rock art. Public debate is ongoing about how best to balance energy development in the canyon against the preservation of its cultural resources.<ref name=blm/>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Nine Mile Creek at North Franks Canyon, Utah.jpg|thumb|Ninemile Canyon (the dark green area at the bottom) at North Franks Canyon. An array of natural gas wells is visible in the distance, May 2019.]]\n\nNinemile Canyon runs roughly southwest to northeast, with numerous winding turns, just to the north of the [[Book Cliffs]], and south and east of [[Ashley National Forest]]. The full {{convert|78|mi|adj=on}} canyon route, formerly [[Utah State Route 53 (1931-1969)|SR&#8209;53]] through Gate Canyon, connects the towns of [[Wellington, Utah|Wellington]] and [[Myton, Utah|Myton]]. Nine Mile Creek, the [[stream]] that formed the canyon, is by no means a major body of water. Its importance lies in the fact that it is one of the few water sources in the region that are reliable year-round, and it has been so since prehistoric times. Nine Mile Creek is actually a minor [[tributary]] of the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], emptying into [[Desolation Canyon]] on the east. A number of tributary canyons branch off Ninemile Cayon itself, including Argyle Canyon, Cottonwood Canyon, [[Minnie Maud]], and Dry Canyon. Significant rock art sites are frequently located near the junctions where they meet the main canyon.\n\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:HuntSceneNMC.JPG|thumb|left|The famous ''Cottonwood Panel'', also called ''The Great Hunt'', May 2006]]\n\nThere are at least an estimated 1,000 rock art sites in the canyon, with more than 10,000 individual images.<ref name=spangler/>{{rp|141}} The true figures may be ten times as high,<ref name=dirtraker/> but there is no question that rock art is more concentrated here than anywhere else in [[North America]]. Much is in the form of pecked [[petroglyph]]s, and there are many painted [[pictograph]]s as well. Researchers have also identified hundreds of [[pit-house]]s, rock shelters, and [[granary|granaries]], although only a limited amount of [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] has been carried out. Many of these structures are located high above the canyon floor on cliff ledges, pinnacles, and [[mesa]]s. They were built by the Fremont, whose presence in Ninemile Canyon has been dated at AD 950\u20131250. Indeed, Ninemile Canyon was one of the locations most heavily occupied by the Fremont.<ref name=carbon/><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.riversimulator.org/Resources/History/UtahCounties/HistoryOfCarbonCounty1996Watt.pdf|title=A History of Carbon County|last=Watt|first=Ronald G.|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-913738-15-8|location=|pages=14\u201316|format=PDF}}</ref> In contrast to the purely [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures that surrounded them, the Fremont practiced [[agriculture]], growing [[maize|corn]] and [[squash (plant)|squash]] along the canyon bottom. Compared to other Fremont areas, relatively little [[pottery]] is found in Nine Mile, suggesting that [[bean]]s, which must be boiled for hours to become edible, were not an important part of the local diet.<ref name=spangler />{{rp|45}} The Fremont left [[irrigation]] ditches and earthen lodges on the canyon floor that could be seen as late as the 1930s, but are no longer visible after generations of modern cultivation.<ref name=spangler />{{rp|21}}\n\n[[File:Utebison.jpeg|thumb|The prints under this [[bison]]'s hooves indicate Ute origin, November 2007.]]\nBy the 16th century the ancestral Utes were in the canyon. They added to the rock art already on the walls, but in styles of their own. Many scenes, for example, depict Ute hunters on horseback and date to the 1800s. Despite the number of Ute [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] found in Nine Mile, there is no archaeological evidence of any Ute camps or residences.<ref name=spangler />{{rp|55\u201357}}\n\n{{anchor|DuchesneNineMileCanyonARs|CarbonNineMileCanyonARs}}\n\n===Archaeological sites===\n[[File:Redman Village Nine Mile Canyon.jpeg|thumb|left|Stone shelter at Redman Village, April 2007]]\n\nIn 2009, 63 archaeological sites in the canyon were listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]], 36 in Carbon County and 27 in Duchesne County. Most are named in the National Register listing only by their [[Smithsonian trinomial]] codes, but there were three named sites in Carbon County: Cottonwood Village, Drop-Dead Ruin, and First Canyon Site. The named ones in Duchesne County are Centennial House, Fool's Pinnacle, Karen's Cist, Maxies Pad, Nordell's Fort, Redman Village, Sunstone Village, and Taylor's City. The locations and details of these sites are not disclosed by the National Register.<ref name=nrhp1/> The 63 sites include 40 Fremont constructions, 19 rock art sites, and 4 sets of historical-era dwellings.<ref name=nom/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=&itype=ngpsid|title=Utah rock art canyon up for historic designation|last=Stark|first=Mike|date=November 11, 2009|website=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> A further 165 sites were added on September 12, 2012, all of them designated by codes only.

Use of the road surged in 1889 after the discovery of [[Gilsonite]] in the [[Uinta Basin]]. This was the main transportation route in eastern Utah until well into the 20th century. Most of the [[stagecoach]], mail, freight, and [[telegraph]] traffic into the Uinta Basin passed through Ninemile Canyon until after the arrival of the [[Uintah Railway]] around 1905.\n\nThe freight trade led to the settlement of the canyon itself. One of the main stagecoach stops developed into a town of sorts. Called [[Harper, Utah|Harper]], it included a hotel, store, school, and an unofficial post office. It lacked a formal town site, simply taking in a long stretch of scattered ranches and buildings. The community grew gradually from the 1880s until it was officially established as the town of Harper in 1905. The Harper precinct as a whole had a population of 130 at its peak in 1910,<ref name=duchesne/>{{rp|81\u201382}} but in the early 1920s Harper became a [[ghost town]].<ref name=guide/>\n\n==Current issues==\n[[File:Defacedelk.jpeg|thumb|Defaced rock art in Rasmussen Cave, April 2007]]\n\nRock art and other ancient artifacts are now protected by law and, although enforcement is difficult, outright [[looting]] and malicious [[vandalism]] are largely a thing of the past.

Jan Matejko).jpg|300px|thumb|''[[Coronation of the First King]]'', [[Jan Matejko]]; depicts the coronation of [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave|Boleslaus I the Brave]]]]\n\nThe basis for the development of a Polish state was laid by the [[Piast dynasty]], which had been preeminent since the 10th century. The conversion of Duke [[Mieszko I]] to [[Christianity]] paved the way for Poland to become a member of the family of Christian kingdoms. In 1000, during the [[Congress of Gniezno]], Poland was recognized as a state by the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[Pope]]. In 1025, Duke [[Boleslaus I of Poland|Boleslaus I the Brave]] was crowned King of Poland, marking the starting date for a Polish Kingdom, though for long years the Poles were ruled not by Kings but by Dukes.\n\nThe King ruled the country in his own responsibility but was expected to respect traditional customs of the people. The succession to the rule was not legally restricted by primogeniture. All sons of the King or Duke had the same rights of inheritance, and the one that in some way proved the strongest succeeded to the throne.\n\n===Period of fragmentation===\nDuke [[Boles\u0142aw III the Wrymouth]], who reigned from 1102 to 1138, tried to end the repeated struggles between various claimants by setting the government of Poland on a more formal footing. In [[Testament of Boles\u0142aw III Krzywousty|his testament]], he divided his lands into five Duchies and distributed them among his sons.\n\nTo ensure unity, he established the ''senioral principle'', which stated that the eldest member of the dynasty should be High Duke and have supreme power over the other Dukes. The High Duke ruled, in addition to the Duchy he inherited, over the indivisible ''senioral part'', a vast strip of land running north-south down the middle of Poland, with Krak\u00f3w as the chief city. The High Duke's prerogatives also included control over [[Pomerania]], a fief of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nWhile the senorial part always fell to that member of the Dynasty that happened to be senior, the other four Duchies were inherited in the usual way among the descendants of Boleslaw's sons. These provisions were soon broken, however, with the various Dukes trying to gain the position of High Duke for themselves, regardless of actual seniority. The provisions, meant to ensure unity fragmented the country even further and resulted in a decline of monarchical power. Poland even came under the influence of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty|P\u0159emyslid]] kings of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], whose dynasty died out before they could gain a stable foothold in Poland.\n\nThe accession of the Piast Duke [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]] ended the power struggle amongst the Polish nobility. He united the various principalities of the Kingdom of Poland, and in 1320 he was crowned King. His son [[Casimir III the Great]] greatly strengthened the Polish state in both foreign and domestic affairs.\n\nCasimir was the last male member of the [[Piast dynasty]] and was succeeded by his nephew, [[Louis I of Hungary]] of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin dynasty]]. The upsurge of the monarchy continued under Louis, during the [[union of Hungary and Poland]].\n\nSince Louis had no son either, his daughter [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] became the heir of the Polish monarchy. Under the terms of the [[Union of Krewo]], she married [[Jogaila]], Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], who converted to Christianity. This marriage created not only a dynastic union between Poland and Lithuania but also bound the two countries together for the next four centuries.\n\nThe period of rule by the [[Piast dynasty]] between the 10th and 14th centuries is the first major stage of the [[history of Poland|history of the Polish nation]]. The dynasty was founded by a series of dukes listed by the chronicler [[Gallus Anonymous]] in the early 12th century: [[Siemowit]], [[Lestek]] and [[Siemomys\u0142]]. It was [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], the son of Siemomys\u0142, who is now considered the proper founder of the Polish state at about 960 AD.<ref name=\"Kronika S\u0142owian II 95\">Witold Chrzanowski, ''Kronika S\u0142owian, tom II Polanie'' (The Chronicle of the Slavs, Volume II: The Polans), p. 95, Wydawnictwo EGIS, Krak\u00f3w 2008, {{ISBN|978-83-7396-749-6}}</ref>  The [[dynasty|ruling house]] then remained in power in the Polish lands until 1370. Mieszko converted to [[Christianity]] of the Western [[Latin Church|Latin Rite]] in an event known as the [[Baptism of Poland]] in 966, which established a major cultural boundary in [[Europe]] based on religion. He also completed a unification of the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] tribal lands that was fundamental to the existence of the new country of Poland.\n\nFollowing the emergence of the Polish state, [[List of Polish monarchs|a series of rulers]] converted the population to [[Christianity]], created a [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|kingdom of Poland]] in 1025 and integrated Poland into the prevailing [[culture of Europe]]. Mieszko's son [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]] established a [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|Roman Catholic Archdiocese in Gniezno]], pursued territorial conquests and was officially crowned in 1025 as the first [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|king of Poland]]. The first Piast monarchy collapsed with the death of [[Mieszko II Lambert]] in 1034, followed by its restoration under [[Casimir I the Restorer|Casimir I]] in 1042. In the process, the royal dignity for Polish rulers was forfeited, and the state reverted to the status of a duchy. Duke Casimir's son [[Boles\u0142aw II the Bold]] revived the military assertiveness of Boles\u0142aw I, but became fatally involved in a conflict with Bishop [[Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w]] and was expelled from the country.\n\n[[Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth|Boles\u0142aw III]], the last duke of the early period, succeeded in defending his country and recovering territories previously lost. Upon his death in 1138, Poland was [[Testament of Boles\u0142aw III Krzywousty|divided among his sons]]. The resulting internal fragmentation eroded the initial Piast monarchical structure in the 12th and 13th centuries and caused fundamental and lasting changes.\n\n[[Konrad I of Masovia]] invited the [[Teutonic Knights]] to help him fight the [[Balts|Baltic]] [[Old Prussians|Prussian]] pagans, which led to centuries of Poland's warfare with the Knights and the [[Duchy of Prussia|German Prussian state]].\n\nIn 1320, the kingdom was restored under [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]], then strengthened and expanded by his son [[Casimir III the Great]]. The western provinces of [[Silesia]] and [[Pomerania]] were lost after the fragmentation, and Poland began expanding to the east. The period ended with the reigns of two members of the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] between 1370 and 1384. The consolidation in the 14th century laid the base for the new powerful [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|kingdom of Poland]] that was to follow.\n\n== 10th\u201312th century ==\n\n=== Mieszko I and the adoption of Christianity in Poland (ca. 960\u2013992) ===\n\n[[File:Ostr\u00f3w Tumski 07.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Important early stages in the history of the Polish state and church took place on the island of [[Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, Pozna\u0144|Ostr\u00f3w Tumski]].

Beginning with a very small area around Gniezno (before the town itself existed), the Piast expansion lasted throughout most of the 10th century and resulted in a territory approximating that of present-day Poland. The [[Polans (western)|Polanie]] tribe conquered and merged with other [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes and first formed a tribal federation, then later a centralized state.  After the addition of [[Lesser Poland]], the country of the [[Vistulans]], and of [[Silesia]] (both taken by Mieszko from the [[Czech lands|Czech]] state during the later part of the 10th century), Mieszko's state reached its mature form, including the main regions regarded as ethnically Polish.<ref name=\"Kurnatowska\">Various authors, ed.

Mieszko fought wars with the [[Polabian Slavs]], the Czechs, [[Margrave]] [[Gero]] of the [[Saxon Eastern March]] in 963\u2013964 and Margrave [[Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark|Odo I]] of the Saxon Eastern March in 972 in the [[Battle of Cedynia]]. The victories over Wichmann and Odo allowed Mieszko to extend his [[Pomerania]]n possessions west to the vicinity of the [[Oder|Oder River]] and its mouth. After the death of Otto I, and then again after the death of [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Otto II]], Mieszko supported [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Quarrelsome]], a pretender to the [[Holy Roman Emperor|imperial crown]]. After the death of Doubravka in 977, Mieszko married [[Oda of Haldensleben|Oda von Haldensleben]], daughter of [[Dietrich of Haldensleben|Dietrich]], Margrave of the [[Northern March]], ca. 980. When fighting the Czechs in 990, Mieszko was helped by the Holy Roman Empire. By about the year 990, when Mieszko I officially submitted his country to the authority of the [[Holy See]] (''[[Dagome iudex]]''), he had transformed Poland into one of the strongest powers in [[Eastern Europe|central-eastern Europe]].<ref name=\"Kurnatowska\"/>\n\n=== The reign of Boles\u0142aw I and establishment of a Kingdom of Poland (992\u20131025) ===\n[[File:Drzwi gnieznienskie wykupienie zwlok Wojciecha.jpg|right|thumb|250 px|An image on the [[Gniezno Doors]] at the entrance to [[Gniezno Cathedral]] depicts [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave|Boles\u0142aw]] buying [[Adalbert of Prague|Adalbert's]] body back from the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]]]]\n\nWhen Mieszko I died in 992, he was succeeded by his son [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave|Boles\u0142aw]] contrary to his wishes. In order to ascend the throne, Boles\u0142aw had to contest it with his widowed stepmother [[Oda of Haldensleben|Oda]], his father's second wife, and her minor sons. Boles\u0142aw was Mieszko's oldest son, born to his first wife [[Doubravka of Bohemia]], who died in 977.  His father intended to divide the duchy of Poland between his sons, but Boles\u0142aw succeeded in displacing his stepmother and stepbrothers to become the sole ruler of Poland. Consistent with the intrigues he pursued at the start of his reign to secure his throne, Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry (\"the Brave\") proved himself to be a man of high ambition and strong personality.\n[[File:Polska 992 - 1025.png|250px|thumb|left|Poland (992\u20131025); area within dark pink color represents the borders at the end of the rule of [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] (992); dark red border comprises the area at the end of the reign of [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave|Boles\u0142aw I]] (1025) ]]\nOne of the most important concerns of Boles\u0142aw's early reign was building up the Polish church. Boles\u0142aw cultivated [[Adalbert of Prague]] of the [[Slavn\u00edk dynasty|Slavn\u00edk family]], a well-connected [[Czechs|Czech]] bishop in exile and missionary who was killed in 997 while on a mission in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]].  Boles\u0142aw skillfully took advantage of his death: his [[Christian martyrs|martyrdom]] led to his elevation as patron saint of Poland and resulted in the creation of an independent Polish province of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] with [[Radim Gaudentius]] as [[Archbishop of Gniezno]]. In the year 1000, the young [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] came as a pilgrim to visit St. Adalbert's grave and lent his support to Boles\u0142aw during the [[Congress of Gniezno]]; the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|Gniezno Archdiocese]] and several subordinate [[diocese]]s were established on this occasion. The Polish [[ecclesiastical province]] effectively served as an essential anchor and an institution to fall back on for the Piast state, helping it to survive in the troubled centuries ahead.<ref name=\"Pleszczy\u0144ski 1\"/>\n\nBoles\u0142aw at first chose to continue his father's policy of cooperation with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] but when Emperor  Otto III died in 1002, Boles\u0142aw's relationship with his successor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] turned out to be much more difficult, and it resulted in a series of wars (1002\u20131005, 1007\u20131013, 1015\u20131018).  From 1003\u20131004, Boles\u0142aw intervened militarily in Czech dynastic conflicts. After his forces were removed from [[Bohemia]] in 1018,<ref>Makk, Ferenc (1993).

In 1013, the marriage between Boles\u0142aw's son [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko]] and [[Richeza of Lotharingia]], the niece of Emperor Otto III and future mother of [[Casimir I the Restorer]], took place. The conflicts with Germany ended in 1018 with the [[Peace of Bautzen]] on favorable terms for Boles\u0142aw. In the context of the 1018 [[Boleslaw I's intervention in the Kievan succession crisis, 1018|Kiev expedition]], Boles\u0142aw took over the western part of [[Red Ruthenia]]. In 1025, shortly before his death, Boles\u0142aw I finally succeeded in obtaining the papal permission to crown himself, and he became the first [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|king of Poland]].<ref name=\"Pleszczy\u0144ski 1\"/>\n\nBoles\u0142aw's expansionist policies were costly to the Polish state and were not always successful. He lost, for example, the economically crucial [[Farther Pomerania]] in 1005 together with its new [[diocese|bishopric]] in [[Ko\u0142obrzeg]]; the region had previously been conquered with great effort by Mieszko.<ref name=\"Pleszczy\u0144ski 1\">Various authors, ed.

His actions reinforced old resentment and hostility on the part of Poland's neighbors, and his two dispossessed brothers took advantage of it by arranging for invasions from Germany and [[Kievan Rus']] in 1031. Mieszko was defeated and forced to leave Poland.  Mieszko's brother [[Bezprym]] was murdered in 1032, whereas his brother Otto died in unclear circumstances in 1033, events that permitted Mieszko to recover his authority partially.  The first Piast monarchy then collapsed with Mieszko's death in 1034. Deprived of a government, Poland was ravaged by an [[pagan reaction in Poland|anti-feudal and pagan rebellion]], and in 1039, there was an invasion by the forces of [[Bretislaus I of Bohemia]].

After returning from exile in 1039, Casimir rebuilt the Polish monarchy and the country's territorial integrity through several military campaigns: in 1047, [[Masovia]] was taken back from [[Miec\u0142aw]], a Polish noble who tried to detach the region from the rule of the Polish monarch, and in 1054 [[Silesia]] was recovered from the Czechs. Casimir was aided by recent adversaries of Poland, the Holy Roman Empire and Kievan Rus', both of whom disliked the chaos in Poland left after the dismemberment of the country beginning in the reign of Mieszko II. Casimir introduced a more mature form of [[feudalism]] and relieved the burden of financing large army units from the duke's treasury by settling his warriors on feudal estates. Faced with the widespread destruction of [[Greater Poland]] after the Czech incursion, Casimir moved his court to [[Krak\u00f3w]] and replaced the old Piast capitals of Pozna\u0144 and Gniezno; Krak\u00f3w would function as the nation's capital for several centuries.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 96\u201398\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), p. 96\u201398</ref><ref name=\"Szczur \u015aredniowiecze 106-107\">Stanis\u0142aw Szczur, ''Historia Polski-\u015bredniowiecze'' (History of Poland: The Middle Ages), [[Wydawnictwo Literackie]], Krak\u00f3w 2002, {{ISBN|978-83-08-04135-2}}, pp. 106-107</ref>\n\n=== Boles\u0142aw II and the conflict with Bishop Stanis\u0142aw (1058\u20131079) ===\n\n[[File:Wawel St Leonard.JPG|220 px|right|thumb|[[St. Leonard's Crypt]] is all that remains of the second [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[Wawel Cathedral]] of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman|W\u0142adys\u0142aw Herman]]]]\n\nCasimir's son [[Boles\u0142aw II the Bold]], also known as the Generous (r. 1058\u20131079), developed Polish military strength and waged several foreign campaigns between 1058 and 1077.

Zbigniew had to leave the country, but received support from Holy Roman Emperor [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]], who attacked Boles\u0142aw's Poland in 1109. Boles\u0142aw was able to defend his country due to his military abilities, determination and alliances, and also because of a national mobilization across the social spectrum (see [[Battle of G\u0142og\u00f3w]]). Zbigniew, who later returned, died in mysterious circumstances, perhaps in the summer of 1113. Boles\u0142aw's other major achievement was the conquest of all of [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I's]] [[Pomerania]] (of which the remaining eastern part had been lost by Poland from after the death of Mieszko II), a task begun by his father [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman]] and completed by Boles\u0142aw around 1123.

He made complex arrangements intended to prevent fratricidal warfare and preserve the Polish state's formal unity, but after Boles\u0142aw's death, the implementation of the plan failed and a long period of fragmentation was ushered in. For nearly two centuries, the Piasts would spar with each other, the clergy, and the nobility for the control over the divided kingdom. The stability of the system was supposedly assured by the institution of the senior or high duke of Poland, based in Krak\u00f3w and assigned to the special [[Seniorate Province]] that was not to be subdivided. Following his concept of seniorate, Boles\u0142aw divided the country into five principalities: [[Duchy of Silesia|Silesia]], [[Duchy of Greater Poland|Greater Poland]], [[Duchy of Masovia|Masovia]], [[Duchy of Sandomierz|Sandomierz]] and [[Seniorate Province|Krak\u00f3w]]. The first four provinces were given to his four sons, who became independent rulers. The fifth province, the Seniorate Province of Krak\u00f3w, was to be added to the senior among the princes who, as the Grand Duke of Krak\u00f3w, was the representative of the whole of Poland. This principle broke down already within the generation of Boles\u0142aw III's sons, when [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile]], [[Boles\u0142aw IV the Curly]], [[Mieszko III the Old]] and [[Casimir II the Just]] fought for power and territory in Poland, and in particular over the throne of Krak\u00f3w.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 104\u2013111\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 104\u2013111</ref>\n\nThe external borders left by Boles\u0142aw III at his death closely resembled the borders left by [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]]; this original early Piast monarchy configuration had not survived the fragmentation period.<ref>''Atlas historyczny Polski'' (Atlas of Polish History), 14th edition, p. 4 and 5</ref>\n\n=== Culture ===\n\n[[File:Legnica.JPG|thumb|right|275 px|[[First Mongol invasion of Poland|Mongol invasion of Poland]] (late 1240\u20131241) culminated in the [[Battle of Legnica]]]]\n\nFrom the time of the conversion of Poland's ruling elite to Christianity in the 10th century, foreign churchmen had been arriving and the [[culture of medieval Poland|culture of early Medieval Poland]] was developing as a part of European [[Christendom]].  However, it would be a few generations from the time of Mieszko's conversion until significant numbers of native clergymen appeared. After the establishment of numerous [[monastery|monasteries]] in the 12th and 13th centuries, Christianization of the populace was accomplished on a larger scale.<ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland''.

Written [[annals]] began to be generated in the late 10th century; leaders such as Mieszko II and Casimir the Restorer were considered literate and educated.  Along with the ''[[Dagome iudex]]'' act, the most important written document and source of the period is the ''[[Gesta principum Polonorum]]'', a chronicle by [[Gallus Anonymus]], a foreign cleric from the court of Boles\u0142aw Wrymouth. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] was one of the pioneering [[Western culture|Western]] clergymen spreading Church literacy; some of his prominent writings had been produced in [[hermit|eremitic]] monasteries in Poland.

Because of constant internal conflicts, the Piast dukes were unable to stabilize Poland's external borders. Western [[Farther Pomerania]] broke its political ties with Poland in the second half of the 12th century and from 1231 became a [[fiefdom|fief]] of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which in 1307 extended its Pomeranian possessions even further east, taking over the [[S\u0142awno]] and [[S\u0142upsk]] areas. [[Pomerelia]] or [[Gda\u0144sk Pomerania]] became independent of the Polish dukes from 1227. In mid-13th century, [[Boles\u0142aw II the Bald]] granted [[Lubusz Land]] to the Margraviate, which made possible the creation of the [[Neumark]] and had far reaching negative consequences for the integrity of the western border. In the south-east, [[Leszek I the White|Leszek the White]] was unable to preserve Poland's supremacy over the [[Halych]] area of [[Rus (name)|Rus']], a territory that had changed hands on a number of occasions.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 116\u2013128\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 116\u2013128</ref>\n\nThe social status was becoming increasingly based on the size of feudal land possessions. Those included the lands controlled by the Piast princes, their rivals the great lay land owners and church entities, and the knightly class. The work force ranged from hired \"free\" people to [[serfdom|serfs]] attached to the land, to slaves (either purchased, forced into slavery after capture in war or forced into slavery as prisoners). The upper layer of the feudal lords, first the Church and then others, was able to acquire economic and [[Sovereign immunity|legal immunity]], which it exempt to a significant degree from court jurisdiction and economic obligations such as taxation that had previously been imposed by the ruling dukes.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 116\u2013128\"/>\n\n[[File:Toru\u01442017.jpg|thumb|left|250 px |[[Toru\u0144|Thorn (Toru\u0144)]], established by the [[Teutonic Knights]] became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]]]]\n\nCivil strife and foreign invasions, such as the [[Mongol invasions]] in [[First Mongol invasion of Poland|1240/1241]], [[Second Mongol invasion of Poland|1259/1260]] and [[Third Mongol invasion of Poland|1287/1288]], weakened and depopulated many of the small Polish principalities, as the country was becoming progressively more subdivided. Depopulation and increasing demand for labor caused a massive immigration of West European peasants into Poland, mostly [[Ostsiedlung|German settlers]]; the early waves from Germany and [[Flanders]] occurred in the 1220s.<ref>[[John Radzilowski]], ''A Traveller's History of Poland''; Northampton, Massachusetts: Interlink Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-56656-655-X}}, p. 260</ref> The German, Polish and other new rural settlements represented a form of feudal tenancy with legal immunity and [[German town law]]s were often utilized as its legal bases. German immigrants were also important in the rise of the cities and the establishment of the Polish [[bourgeoisie|burgher]] (city dwelling merchants) class; they brought with them West European laws ([[Magdeburg rights]]) and customs that the Poles adopted. From that time, the Germans, who created early strong establishments (led by [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patriciates]]) especially in the urban centers of Silesia and other regions of western Poland, were an increasingly influential minority in Poland.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 116\u2013128\"/><ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 14\u201316</ref><ref>Norman Davies, ''Europe: A History'' , p. 366</ref>\n\nIn 1228, the Acts of Cienia were passed and signed into law by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw III Spindleshanks|W\u0142adys\u0142aw III Laskonogi]]. The titular Duke of Poland promised to provide a \"just and noble law according to the council of bishops and barons.\" Such legal guarantees and privileges included the lower level land owners and knights, who were evolving into the lower and middle nobility class known later as ''[[szlachta]]''. The period of fragmentation weakened the rulers and established a permanent trend in Polish history, whereby the rights and role of the nobility were expanded at the monarch's expense.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 116\u2013128\"/>\n\n=== Relations with the Teutonic Knights ===\n[[File:Codex Manesse Heinrich von Breslau.jpg|thumb|right|175 px|[[Henry IV Probus|Henry IV of Wroc\u0142aw]] in the [[Codex Manesse]], about 1300]]\n\nIn 1226, Duke [[Konrad I of Masovia]] invited the [[Teutonic Knights]] to help him fight the pagan, Baltic [[Old Prussians]], who lived in a territory adjacent to his lands; substantial border warfare was taking place and Konrad's province was suffering from Prussian invasions. On the other hand, the [[Old Prussians]] themselves were at that time being subjected to increasingly forced, but largely ineffective Christianization efforts, including [[Northern Crusades]] sponsored by the papacy. The [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]] soon overstepped their authority and moved beyond the area granted them by Konrad ([[Che\u0142mno]] Land or [[Kulmerland]]). In the following decades, they conquered large areas along the [[Baltic Sea]] coast and established their own [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights|monastic state]]. As virtually all of the Western Baltic pagans became converted or exterminated (the Prussian conquests were completed by 1283), the Knights confronted Poland and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], then the last pagan state in Europe. Teutonic wars with Poland and Lithuania continued for most of the 14th and 15th centuries. The Teutonic state in Prussia, populated by German settlers beginning in the 13th century, had been claimed as a [[fiefdom|fief]] and protected by the popes and Holy Roman Emperors.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 128\u2013129\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 128\u2013129</ref><ref>John Radzilowski, ''A Traveller's History of Poland'',  pp. 39\u201341</ref>\n\n=== Reunification attempts and the reigns of Przemys\u0142 II and V\u00e1clav II (1232\u20131305) ===\n[[File:Jakub \u015awinka.PNG|thumb|left|185 px|Archbishop [[Jakub \u015awinka]]]]\n\nAs the disadvantages of national division were becoming increasingly apparent in various segments of the society, some of the Piast dukes began to make serious efforts aimed at the reunification of the Polish state. Important among the earlier attempts were the activities of the [[Silesian Piasts|Silesian dukes]] [[Henry I the Bearded]], his son [[Henry II the Pious]], who was killed in 1241 while fighting the Mongols at the [[Battle of Legnica]], and [[Henry IV Probus]]. In 1295, [[Przemys\u0142 II]] of [[Greater Poland]] became the first Piast duke crowned as King of Poland since Boles\u0142aw II, but he ruled over only a part of the territory of Poland (including [[Pomerelia|Gda\u0144sk Pomerania]] from 1294) and was assassinated soon after his coronation. A more extensive unification of Polish lands was accomplished by a foreign ruler, [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|V\u00e1clav II of Bohemia]] of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]], who married [[Elisabeth Richeza of Poland|Przemys\u0142's daughter Richeza]] and became King of Poland in 1300. V\u00e1clav's heavy-handed policies soon caused him to lose whatever support he had earlier in his reign; he died in 1305.\n\n[[File:Catedral de San Juan, Breslavia, Polonia, 2017-12-20, DD 14.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Wroc\u0142aw Cathedral|Cathedral of St. John the Baptist]] in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]]]\nAn important factor in the unification process was the Polish Church, which remained a single ecclesiastical province throughout the fragmentation period. Archbishop [[Jakub \u015awinka]] of Gniezno was an ardent proponent of Poland's reunification; he performed the crowning ceremonies for both Przemys\u0142 II and [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]]. \u015awinka supported [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high|W\u0142adys\u0142aw I \u0141okietek]] at various stages of the duke's career.\n\n=== Culture ===\n[[culture of medieval Poland|Culturally]], the social impact of the Church was considerably broader in the 13th century, as networks of parishes were established and cathedral-type schools became more common.  The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and the [[Franciscan]]s were the leading monastic orders at this time, and they interacted closely with the general population. A proliferation of narrative [[annals]] characterized the period, as well as other written records, laws and documents. More of the clergy were of local origin; others were expected to know the Polish language. [[Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek]], the author of an [[Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae|influential chronicle]], was the most recognized representative in the intellectual sphere.  ''Perspectiva'', a treatise on [[optics]] by [[Witelo]], a Silesian monk, was one of the finest achievements of [[Science in the Middle Ages|medieval science]]. The construction of churches and castles in the [[Gothic architecture]] style predominated in the 13th century; native elements in art forms were increasingly important, with significant advances taking place in agriculture, manufacturing and crafts.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 141\u2013144\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 141\u2013144</ref>\n\n== 14th century ==\n\n=== The reunited kingdom of the last Piast rulers; Jewish settlement ===\n[[File:W\u0142adys\u0142aw I sarcophagus figure.jpg|thumb|left|190 px|A fragment of a sandstone [[sarcophagus]] depicting [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]] in [[Wawel Cathedral]], Krak\u00f3w]]\n[[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]]  and his son [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir III, \"the Great\"]], were the last two rulers of the Piast dynasty of the unified kingdom of Poland of the 14th century.  Their rule was not a return to the Polish state as it existed before the period of fragmentation, because of the loss of internal cohesion and territorial integrity. The regional Piast princes remained strong, and for economic and cultural reasons, some of them gravitated toward Poland's neighbors. The kingdom lost Pomerania and Silesia, the most highly developed and economically important regions of the original ethnically Polish lands, which left half of the Polish population outside the kingdom's borders. The western losses had to do with the failure of the unification efforts undertaken by the [[Silesian Piasts|Silesian Piast]] dukes and the German expansion processes. These included the Piast principalities developing (or falling into) dependencies in respect to the German political structures, [[Ostsiedlung|settler colonization]] and gradual [[Germanisation|Germanization]] of the Polish ruling circles. The lower [[Vistula]] was controlled by the Teutonic Order. [[Masovia]] was not to be fully incorporated into the Polish state in the near future. Casimir stabilized the western and northern borders, tried to regain some of the lost territories, and partially compensated the losses by new eastern expansion that placed within his kingdom regions that were [[East Slavs|East Slavic]], thus ethnically non-Polish.<ref name=\"Lukowski 15\u201334\">Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 15\u201334</ref><ref name=\"Wyrozumski 145\u2013154\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 145\u2013154</ref>\n\nDespite the territorial truncation, 14th-century Poland experienced a period of accelerated economic development and increasing prosperity. This included further expansion and modernization of agricultural settlements, the development of towns and their greater role in briskly growing trade, mining and metallurgy. A great monetary reform was implemented during the reign of Casimir III.<ref name=\"Lukowski 15\u201334\"/><ref name=\"Wyrozumski 145\u2013154\"/>\n\n[[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish settlement]] was taking place in Poland since very early times. In 1264, Duke [[Boles\u0142aw the Pious]] of Greater Poland granted the privileges of the [[Statute of Kalisz]], which specified a broad range of freedoms of religious practices, movement, and trading for the Jews. It also created a legal precedent for the official protection of Jews from local harassment and exclusion. The act exempted the Jews from enslavement or serfdom and was the foundation of future Jewish prosperity in the Polish kingdom; it was later followed by many other comparable legal pronouncements.<ref>Davies, Norman (2005).

When he died as the king of a partially reunited Poland, he left the kingdom in a precarious situation.  Although the area under King W\u0142adys\u0142aw's control was limited and many unresolved issues remained, he may have saved Poland's existence as a state.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 155\u2013160\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 155\u2013160</ref>\n\nSupported by his ally [[Charles I of Hungary]], W\u0142adys\u0142aw returned from exile and challenged [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|V\u00e1clav II]] and his successor [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia|V\u00e1clav III]] in the period 1304\u20131306. V\u00e1clav III's murder in 1306 terminated the Bohemian P\u0159emyslid dynasty and its involvement in Poland. Afterwards, W\u0142adys\u0142aw  completed the takeover of [[Lesser Poland]], entering Krak\u00f3w, and took the lands north of there, through Kuyavia all the way to [[Pomerelia|Gda\u0144sk Pomerania]]. In 1308, Pomerania was conquered by the Brandenburg state. In a recovery effort, W\u0142adys\u0142aw agreed to ask for help from the Teutonic Knights; the Knights brutally [[Teutonic takeover of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk)|took over Gda\u0144sk Pomerania]] and kept it for themselves.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 155\u2013160\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 155\u2013160</ref>\n\nIn 1311\u20131312, a [[rebellion of w\u00f3jt Albert|rebellion in Krak\u00f3w]] instigated by the city's [[patricianship|patrician]] leadership seeking rule by the [[House of Luxembourg]] was put down. This event may have had a limiting impact on the emerging political power of towns.<ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 23\u201324</ref>\n\nIn 1313\u20131314, W\u0142adys\u0142aw conquered [[Greater Poland]]. In 1320, he became the first king of Poland crowned in Krak\u00f3w's [[Wawel Cathedral]] instead of [[Gniezno]]. The coronation was hesitantly agreed to by [[Pope John XXII]] in spite of the opposition of King [[John of Bohemia]], who had also claimed the Polish crown. John undertook an expedition aimed at Krak\u00f3w in 1327, which he was compelled to abort; in 1328, he waged a crusade against Lithuania, during which he formalized an alliance with the Teutonic Order. The Order was in a state of [[Polish\u2013Teutonic War (1326\u20131332)|war with Poland]] from 1327 to 1332 (see [[Battle of P\u0142owce]]). As a result, the Knights captured [[Dobrzy\u0144 Land]] and [[Kujawy]]. W\u0142adys\u0142aw was helped by his alliances with Hungary (his daughter [[Elisabeth of Poland|Elizabeth]] was married to King [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles I]] in 1320) and Lithuania (in a pact of 1325 against the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic State]] and the marriage of W\u0142adys\u0142aw's son [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir]] to [[Aldona of Lithuania|Aldona]], daughter of the Lithuanian ruler [[Gediminas]]).<ref name=\"Chronology 74\u201375\">Ed. Andrzej Chwalba, ''Kalendarium dziej\u00f3w Polski'' (Chronology of Polish History), pp. 74\u201375, Krzysztof Stopka</ref> After 1329, a peace agreement with Brandenburg also assisted his efforts. A lasting achievement of King [[John of Bohemia]] (and a great loss to Poland) was his success in forcing most of the Piast Silesian principalities, often ambivalent about their loyalties, into [[allegiance]] between 1327 and 1329.<ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 14\u201326</ref>\n\n=== The reign of Casimir III the Great (1333\u20131370) ===\n[[File:Polska 1333 - 1370.png|250px|thumb|left|Poland at the end of the rule of [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III]] (1370) is shown within the dark red border; [[Silesia]] (yellow) was lost, while the kingdom had expanded to the east]]\n\nAfter the death of W\u0142adys\u0142aw I, the old monarch's 23-year-old son became King Casimir III, later known as [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir the Great]] (r. 1333\u20131370). Unlike his father, the new king demonstrated no attraction for the hardships of military life.  Casimir's contemporaries did not give him much of a chance of overcoming the country's mounting difficulties or succeeding as a ruler. But from the beginning, Casimir acted prudently, and in 1335, he purchased the claims of King John of Bohemia to the Polish throne.  In 1343, Casimir settled several high-level arbitration disputes with the Teutonic Order by a territorial compromise that culminated in the [[Treaty of Kalisz (1343)|Treaty of Kalisz]] of 1343. [[Dobrzy\u0144 Land]] and [[Kuyavia]] were recovered by Casimir. At that time, Poland started to expand to the east and through a series of military campaigns between 1340 and 1366, Casimir annexed the [[Halych]]\u2013[[Volodymyr-Volynskyi|Volodymyr]] [[Galicia-Volhynia|area of Rus']]. The town of [[Lviv]] there attracted newcomers of several nationalities, was granted [[Magdeburg rights|municipal rights]] in 1356, and had thus begun its career as [[Lviv|Lw\u00f3w]], the main Polish center in the midst of a [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] population. Supported by Hungary, the Polish king in 1338 promised the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Hungarian ruling house]] the Polish throne in the event he dies without male heirs.<ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 26\u201334</ref>\n\n[[File:Casimir III of Poland.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Foundation of the [[Collegiate church in Wi\u015blica]] by [[Casimir III the Great]]]]\n\nCasimir, who formally gave up his rights to several [[Silesia]]n principalities in 1339, unsuccessfully tried to recover the region by conducting military activities against the [[House of Luxembourg]] (the rulers of Bohemia) between 1343 and 1348, but then blocked the attempted separation of Silesia from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|Gniezno Archdiocese]] by Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]. Later, until his death, he pursued the Polish claim to Silesia legally by petitioning the pope; his successors did not continue his efforts.\n\nAllied with Denmark and Western Pomerania (Gda\u0144sk Pomerania was granted to the Order as an \"eternal charity\"), Casimir was able to impose some corrections on the western border. In 1365, [[Drezdenko]] and [[Santok]] became Poland's [[fiefdom|fiefs]], while the [[Wa\u0142cz]] district was taken outright in 1368. The latter action severed the land connection between Brandenburg and the Teutonic state and connected Poland with [[Farther Pomerania]].\n\nCasimir the Great considerably solidified the country's position in both foreign and domestic affairs. Domestically, he integrated and centralized the reunited Polish state and helped develop what was considered the \"[[Crown of the Polish Kingdom]]\": the state within its actual boundaries, as well as past or potential boundaries. Casimir established or strengthened kingdom-wide institutions (such as the powerful state treasury) independent of the regional, class, or royal court-related interests. Internationally, the Polish king was very active diplomatically; he cultivated close contacts with other European rulers and was a staunch defender of the Polish national interest. In 1364, he sponsored the [[Congress of Krak\u00f3w]], in which a number of monarchs participated, which was concerned with the promotion of peaceful cooperation and political balance in Central Europe.\n\n=== The reign of Louis I and Jadwiga (1370\u20131399) ===\n\n[[File:Jadwiga by Bacciarelli.jpg|left|thumb|180 px|[[Jadwiga of Poland|Queen Jadwiga]] was the great-granddaughter of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]]]]\n[[File:Zabudowa Wzg\u00f3rza Wawelskiego (widok z wie\u017cy ko\u015bcio\u0142a Mariackiego); A-7; PL-MA, Krak\u00f3w, Wawel.jpg|Zabudowa Wzg\u00f3rza Wawelskiego (widok z wie\u017cy ko\u015bcio\u0142a Mariackiego); A-7; PL-MA, Krak\u00f3w, Wawel|right|thumb|350 px|[[Wawel Castle]] in [[Krakow]]]]\nImmediately after Casimir's death in 1370, the heirless king's nephew [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis of Hungary]] of the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] assumed the Polish throne. As Casimir's actual commitment to the Anjou succession seemed problematic from the beginning (in 1368 the Polish king adopted his grandson, [[Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania|Casimir of S\u0142upsk]]), Louis engaged in succession negotiations with Polish knights and nobility starting in 1351. They supported him, exacting in return further guarantees and privileges for themselves; the formal act was negotiated in [[Buda]] in 1355. After his coronation, Louis returned to Hungary; he left his mother and [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir]]'s sister [[Elizabeth of Poland|Elizabeth]] in Poland as [[regent]]s.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 169\u2013173\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 169\u2013173</ref>\n\nWith the death of Casimir the Great, the period of hereditary (Piast) monarchy in Poland came to an end. The land owners and nobles did not want a strong monarchy; a constitutional monarchy was established between 1370 and 1493 that included the beginning of the [[general sejm]], the dominant bicameral parliament of the future.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 169\u2013173\"/>\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - CRACOVIA.png|thumb|right|Woodcut of Krak\u00f3w from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]], 1493]]\n\n\nDuring the reign of Louis I, Poland formed a [[Polish-Hungarian union]]. In the pact of 1374 (the [[Privilege of Koszyce]]), the Polish nobility was granted extensive concessions and agreed to extend the Anjou succession to Louis's daughters, as Louis had no sons. Louis's neglect of Polish affairs resulted in the loss of Casimir's territorial gains, including [[Halych]] [[Rus (name)|Rus']], which was recovered by Queen [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] in 1387. In 1396, Jadwiga and her husband [[Jogaila|Jagie\u0142\u0142o (Jogaila)]] forcefully annexed the central Polish lands separating [[Lesser Poland]] from [[Greater Poland]], previously granted by King Louis to his [[Silesian Piasts|Silesian Piast]] ally Duke [[Vladislaus II of Opole|W\u0142adys\u0142aw of Opole]].<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 169\u2013173\"/><ref name=\"Lukowski 42\u201344\">Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 42\u201344</ref>\n\nThe Hungarian-Polish union lasted for twelve years and ended in war. After Louis's death in 1382 and a power struggle that resulted in the [[Greater Poland Civil War]], the Polish nobility decided that Jadwiga, Louis's youngest daughter, should become the next \"King of Poland\"; Jadwiga arrived in 1384 and was crowned at the age of eleven. The failure of the union of Poland and Hungary paved the way for the [[Polish-Lithuanian union|union of Lithuania and Poland]].<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 169\u2013173\"/>\n\n=== Culture ===\nIn the 14th century, many large scale [[Architecture of medieval Poland|brick building projects]] were undertaken during Casimir's reign, including the construction of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches, castles, urban fortifications and homes of wealthy city residents.  The most notable examples of architecture from the medieval period in Poland are the many churches representing the [[Polish Gothic]] style; medieval sculpture, painting and ornamental smithery are best revealed in the furnishings of churches and liturgical items.  Polish law was first codified in the [[Statutes of Casimir the Great]] (the Piotrk\u00f3w\u2013Wi\u015blica Statutes) from 1346\u20131362.  Accordingly, conflict resolution relied on legal proceedings domestically, while bilateral or multilateral negotiations and treaties were increasingly important in international relations. By this time, the network of cathedral and parish schools had become well developed.

Jan Matejko).jpg|300px|thumb|''[[Coronation of the First King]]'', [[Jan Matejko]]; depicts the coronation of [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave|Boleslaus I the Brave]]]]\n\nThe basis for the development of a Polish state was laid by the [[Piast dynasty]], which had been preeminent since the 10th century. The conversion of Duke [[Mieszko I]] to [[Christianity]] paved the way for Poland to become a member of the family of Christian kingdoms. In 1000, during the [[Congress of Gniezno]], Poland was recognized as a state by the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[Pope]]. In 1025, Duke [[Boleslaus I of Poland|Boleslaus I the Brave]] was crowned King of Poland, marking the starting date for a Polish Kingdom, though for long years the Poles were ruled not by Kings but by Dukes.\n\nThe King ruled the country in his own responsibility but was expected to respect traditional customs of the people. The succession to the rule was not legally restricted by primogeniture. All sons of the King or Duke had the same rights of inheritance, and the one that in some way proved the strongest succeeded to the throne.\n\n===Period of fragmentation===\nDuke [[Boles\u0142aw III the Wrymouth]], who reigned from 1102 to 1138, tried to end the repeated struggles between various claimants by setting the government of Poland on a more formal footing. In [[Testament of Boles\u0142aw III Krzywousty|his testament]], he divided his lands into five Duchies and distributed them among his sons.\n\nTo ensure unity, he established the ''senioral principle'', which stated that the eldest member of the dynasty should be High Duke and have supreme power over the other Dukes. The High Duke ruled, in addition to the Duchy he inherited, over the indivisible ''senioral part'', a vast strip of land running north-south down the middle of Poland, with Krak\u00f3w as the chief city. The High Duke's prerogatives also included control over [[Pomerania]], a fief of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nWhile the senorial part always fell to that member of the Dynasty that happened to be senior, the other four Duchies were inherited in the usual way among the descendants of Boleslaw's sons. These provisions were soon broken, however, with the various Dukes trying to gain the position of High Duke for themselves, regardless of actual seniority. The provisions, meant to ensure unity fragmented the country even further and resulted in a decline of monarchical power. Poland even came under the influence of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty|P\u0159emyslid]] kings of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], whose dynasty died out before they could gain a stable foothold in Poland.\n\nThe accession of the Piast Duke [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]] ended the power struggle amongst the Polish nobility. He united the various principalities of the Kingdom of Poland, and in 1320 he was crowned King. His son [[Casimir III the Great]] greatly strengthened the Polish state in both foreign and domestic affairs.\n\nCasimir was the last male member of the [[Piast dynasty]] and was succeeded by his nephew, [[Louis I of Hungary]] of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin dynasty]]. The upsurge of the monarchy continued under Louis, during the [[union of Hungary and Poland]].\n\nSince Louis had no son either, his daughter [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] became the heir of the Polish monarchy. Under the terms of the [[Union of Krewo]], she married [[Jogaila]], Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], who converted to Christianity. This marriage created not only a dynastic union between Poland and Lithuania but also bound the two countries together for the next four centuries.\n\nThe period of rule by the [[Piast dynasty]] between the 10th and 14th centuries is the first major stage of the [[history of Poland|history of the Polish nation]]. The dynasty was founded by a series of dukes listed by the chronicler [[Gallus Anonymous]] in the early 12th century: [[Siemowit]], [[Lestek]] and [[Siemomys\u0142]]. It was [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], the son of Siemomys\u0142, who is now considered the proper founder of the Polish state at about 960 AD.<ref name=\"Kronika S\u0142owian II 95\">Witold Chrzanowski, ''Kronika S\u0142owian, tom II Polanie'' (The Chronicle of the Slavs, Volume II: The Polans), p. 95, Wydawnictwo EGIS, Krak\u00f3w 2008, {{ISBN|978-83-7396-749-6}}</ref>  The [[dynasty|ruling house]] then remained in power in the Polish lands until 1370. Mieszko converted to [[Christianity]] of the Western [[Latin Church|Latin Rite]] in an event known as the [[Baptism of Poland]] in 966, which established a major cultural boundary in [[Europe]] based on religion. He also completed a unification of the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] tribal lands that was fundamental to the existence of the new country of Poland.\n\nFollowing the emergence of the Polish state, [[List of Polish monarchs|a series of rulers]] converted the population to [[Christianity]], created a [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|kingdom of Poland]] in 1025 and integrated Poland into the prevailing [[culture of Europe]]. Mieszko's son [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]] established a [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|Roman Catholic Archdiocese in Gniezno]], pursued territorial conquests and was officially crowned in 1025 as the first [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|king of Poland]]. The first Piast monarchy collapsed with the death of [[Mieszko II Lambert]] in 1034, followed by its restoration under [[Casimir I the Restorer|Casimir I]] in 1042. In the process, the royal dignity for Polish rulers was forfeited, and the state reverted to the status of a duchy. Duke Casimir's son [[Boles\u0142aw II the Bold]] revived the military assertiveness of Boles\u0142aw I, but became fatally involved in a conflict with Bishop [[Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w]] and was expelled from the country.\n\n[[Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth|Boles\u0142aw III]], the last duke of the early period, succeeded in defending his country and recovering territories previously lost. Upon his death in 1138, Poland was [[Testament of Boles\u0142aw III Krzywousty|divided among his sons]]. The resulting internal fragmentation eroded the initial Piast monarchical structure in the 12th and 13th centuries and caused fundamental and lasting changes.\n\n[[Konrad I of Masovia]] invited the [[Teutonic Knights]] to help him fight the [[Balts|Baltic]] [[Old Prussians|Prussian]] pagans, which led to centuries of Poland's warfare with the Knights and the [[Duchy of Prussia|German Prussian state]].\n\nIn 1320, the kingdom was restored under [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]], then strengthened and expanded by his son [[Casimir III the Great]]. The western provinces of [[Silesia]] and [[Pomerania]] were lost after the fragmentation, and Poland began expanding to the east. The period ended with the reigns of two members of the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] between 1370 and 1384. The consolidation in the 14th century laid the base for the new powerful [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|kingdom of Poland]] that was to follow.\n\n== 10th\u201312th century ==\n\n=== Mieszko I and the adoption of Christianity in Poland (ca. 960\u2013992) ===\n\n[[File:Ostr\u00f3w Tumski 07.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Important early stages in the history of the Polish state and church took place on the island of [[Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, Pozna\u0144|Ostr\u00f3w Tumski]].

Mieszko fought wars with the [[Polabian Slavs]], the Czechs, [[Margrave]] [[Gero]] of the [[Saxon Eastern March]] in 963\u2013964 and Margrave [[Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark|Odo I]] of the Saxon Eastern March in 972 in the [[Battle of Cedynia]]. The victories over Wichmann and Odo allowed Mieszko to extend his [[Pomerania]]n possessions west to the vicinity of the [[Oder|Oder River]] and its mouth. After the death of Otto I, and then again after the death of [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Otto II]], Mieszko supported [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Quarrelsome]], a pretender to the [[Holy Roman Emperor|imperial crown]]. After the death of Doubravka in 977, Mieszko married [[Oda of Haldensleben|Oda von Haldensleben]], daughter of [[Dietrich of Haldensleben|Dietrich]], Margrave of the [[Northern March]], ca. 980. When fighting the Czechs in 990, Mieszko was helped by the Holy Roman Empire.

His father intended to divide the duchy of Poland between his sons, but Boles\u0142aw succeeded in displacing his stepmother and stepbrothers to become the sole ruler of Poland. Consistent with the intrigues he pursued at the start of his reign to secure his throne, Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry (\"the Brave\") proved himself to be a man of high ambition and strong personality.\n[[File:Polska 992 - 1025.png|250px|thumb|left|Poland (992\u20131025); area within dark pink color represents the borders at the end of the rule of [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] (992); dark red border comprises the area at the end of the reign of [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave|Boles\u0142aw I]] (1025) ]]\nOne of the most important concerns of Boles\u0142aw's early reign was building up the Polish church.

Boles\u0142aw skillfully took advantage of his death: his [[Christian martyrs|martyrdom]] led to his elevation as patron saint of Poland and resulted in the creation of an independent Polish province of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] with [[Radim Gaudentius]] as [[Archbishop of Gniezno]]. In the year 1000, the young [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] came as a pilgrim to visit St. Adalbert's grave and lent his support to Boles\u0142aw during the [[Congress of Gniezno]]; the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|Gniezno Archdiocese]] and several subordinate [[diocese]]s were established on this occasion. The Polish [[ecclesiastical province]] effectively served as an essential anchor and an institution to fall back on for the Piast state, helping it to survive in the troubled centuries ahead.<ref name=\"Pleszczy\u0144ski 1\"/>\n\nBoles\u0142aw at first chose to continue his father's policy of cooperation with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] but when Emperor  Otto III died in 1002, Boles\u0142aw's relationship with his successor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] turned out to be much more difficult, and it resulted in a series of wars (1002\u20131005, 1007\u20131013, 1015\u20131018).  From 1003\u20131004, Boles\u0142aw intervened militarily in Czech dynastic conflicts. After his forces were removed from [[Bohemia]] in 1018,<ref>Makk, Ferenc (1993).

Zbigniew had to leave the country, but received support from Holy Roman Emperor [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]], who attacked Boles\u0142aw's Poland in 1109.

He made complex arrangements intended to prevent fratricidal warfare and preserve the Polish state's formal unity, but after Boles\u0142aw's death, the implementation of the plan failed and a long period of fragmentation was ushered in. For nearly two centuries, the Piasts would spar with each other, the clergy, and the nobility for the control over the divided kingdom. The stability of the system was supposedly assured by the institution of the senior or high duke of Poland, based in Krak\u00f3w and assigned to the special [[Seniorate Province]] that was not to be subdivided. Following his concept of seniorate, Boles\u0142aw divided the country into five principalities: [[Duchy of Silesia|Silesia]], [[Duchy of Greater Poland|Greater Poland]], [[Duchy of Masovia|Masovia]], [[Duchy of Sandomierz|Sandomierz]] and [[Seniorate Province|Krak\u00f3w]]. The first four provinces were given to his four sons, who became independent rulers. The fifth province, the Seniorate Province of Krak\u00f3w, was to be added to the senior among the princes who, as the Grand Duke of Krak\u00f3w, was the representative of the whole of Poland. This principle broke down already within the generation of Boles\u0142aw III's sons, when [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile]], [[Boles\u0142aw IV the Curly]], [[Mieszko III the Old]] and [[Casimir II the Just]] fought for power and territory in Poland, and in particular over the throne of Krak\u00f3w.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 104\u2013111\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 104\u2013111</ref>\n\nThe external borders left by Boles\u0142aw III at his death closely resembled the borders left by [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]]; this original early Piast monarchy configuration had not survived the fragmentation period.<ref>''Atlas historyczny Polski'' (Atlas of Polish History), 14th edition, p. 4 and 5</ref>\n\n=== Culture ===\n\n[[File:Legnica.JPG|thumb|right|275 px|[[First Mongol invasion of Poland|Mongol invasion of Poland]] (late 1240\u20131241) culminated in the [[Battle of Legnica]]]]\n\nFrom the time of the conversion of Poland's ruling elite to Christianity in the 10th century, foreign churchmen had been arriving and the [[culture of medieval Poland|culture of early Medieval Poland]] was developing as a part of European [[Christendom]].  However, it would be a few generations from the time of Mieszko's conversion until significant numbers of native clergymen appeared. After the establishment of numerous [[monastery|monasteries]] in the 12th and 13th centuries, Christianization of the populace was accomplished on a larger scale.<ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland''.

Written [[annals]] began to be generated in the late 10th century; leaders such as Mieszko II and Casimir the Restorer were considered literate and educated.  Along with the ''[[Dagome iudex]]'' act, the most important written document and source of the period is the ''[[Gesta principum Polonorum]]'', a chronicle by [[Gallus Anonymus]], a foreign cleric from the court of Boles\u0142aw Wrymouth. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] was one of the pioneering [[Western culture|Western]] clergymen spreading Church literacy; some of his prominent writings had been produced in [[hermit|eremitic]] monasteries in Poland.

Because of constant internal conflicts, the Piast dukes were unable to stabilize Poland's external borders. Western [[Farther Pomerania]] broke its political ties with Poland in the second half of the 12th century and from 1231 became a [[fiefdom|fief]] of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which in 1307 extended its Pomeranian possessions even further east, taking over the [[S\u0142awno]] and [[S\u0142upsk]] areas. [[Pomerelia]] or [[Gda\u0144sk Pomerania]] became independent of the Polish dukes from 1227. In mid-13th century, [[Boles\u0142aw II the Bald]] granted [[Lubusz Land]] to the Margraviate, which made possible the creation of the [[Neumark]] and had far reaching negative consequences for the integrity of the western border. In the south-east, [[Leszek I the White|Leszek the White]] was unable to preserve Poland's supremacy over the [[Halych]] area of [[Rus (name)|Rus']], a territory that had changed hands on a number of occasions.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 116\u2013128\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 116\u2013128</ref>\n\nThe social status was becoming increasingly based on the size of feudal land possessions. Those included the lands controlled by the Piast princes, their rivals the great lay land owners and church entities, and the knightly class. The work force ranged from hired \"free\" people to [[serfdom|serfs]] attached to the land, to slaves (either purchased, forced into slavery after capture in war or forced into slavery as prisoners). The upper layer of the feudal lords, first the Church and then others, was able to acquire economic and [[Sovereign immunity|legal immunity]], which it exempt to a significant degree from court jurisdiction and economic obligations such as taxation that had previously been imposed by the ruling dukes.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 116\u2013128\"/>\n\n[[File:Toru\u01442017.jpg|thumb|left|250 px |[[Toru\u0144|Thorn (Toru\u0144)]], established by the [[Teutonic Knights]] became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]]]]\n\nCivil strife and foreign invasions, such as the [[Mongol invasions]] in [[First Mongol invasion of Poland|1240/1241]], [[Second Mongol invasion of Poland|1259/1260]] and [[Third Mongol invasion of Poland|1287/1288]], weakened and depopulated many of the small Polish principalities, as the country was becoming progressively more subdivided. Depopulation and increasing demand for labor caused a massive immigration of West European peasants into Poland, mostly [[Ostsiedlung|German settlers]]; the early waves from Germany and [[Flanders]] occurred in the 1220s.<ref>[[John Radzilowski]], ''A Traveller's History of Poland''; Northampton, Massachusetts: Interlink Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-56656-655-X}}, p. 260</ref> The German, Polish and other new rural settlements represented a form of feudal tenancy with legal immunity and [[German town law]]s were often utilized as its legal bases. German immigrants were also important in the rise of the cities and the establishment of the Polish [[bourgeoisie|burgher]] (city dwelling merchants) class; they brought with them West European laws ([[Magdeburg rights]]) and customs that the Poles adopted. From that time, the Germans, who created early strong establishments (led by [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patriciates]]) especially in the urban centers of Silesia and other regions of western Poland, were an increasingly influential minority in Poland.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 116\u2013128\"/><ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 14\u201316</ref><ref>Norman Davies, ''Europe: A History'' , p. 366</ref>\n\nIn 1228, the Acts of Cienia were passed and signed into law by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw III Spindleshanks|W\u0142adys\u0142aw III Laskonogi]]. The titular Duke of Poland promised to provide a \"just and noble law according to the council of bishops and barons.\" Such legal guarantees and privileges included the lower level land owners and knights, who were evolving into the lower and middle nobility class known later as ''[[szlachta]]''. The period of fragmentation weakened the rulers and established a permanent trend in Polish history, whereby the rights and role of the nobility were expanded at the monarch's expense.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 116\u2013128\"/>\n\n=== Relations with the Teutonic Knights ===\n[[File:Codex Manesse Heinrich von Breslau.jpg|thumb|right|175 px|[[Henry IV Probus|Henry IV of Wroc\u0142aw]] in the [[Codex Manesse]], about 1300]]\n\nIn 1226, Duke [[Konrad I of Masovia]] invited the [[Teutonic Knights]] to help him fight the pagan, Baltic [[Old Prussians]], who lived in a territory adjacent to his lands; substantial border warfare was taking place and Konrad's province was suffering from Prussian invasions. On the other hand, the [[Old Prussians]] themselves were at that time being subjected to increasingly forced, but largely ineffective Christianization efforts, including [[Northern Crusades]] sponsored by the papacy. The [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]] soon overstepped their authority and moved beyond the area granted them by Konrad ([[Che\u0142mno]] Land or [[Kulmerland]]). In the following decades, they conquered large areas along the [[Baltic Sea]] coast and established their own [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights|monastic state]]. As virtually all of the Western Baltic pagans became converted or exterminated (the Prussian conquests were completed by 1283), the Knights confronted Poland and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], then the last pagan state in Europe. Teutonic wars with Poland and Lithuania continued for most of the 14th and 15th centuries. The Teutonic state in Prussia, populated by German settlers beginning in the 13th century, had been claimed as a [[fiefdom|fief]] and protected by the popes and Holy Roman Emperors.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 128\u2013129\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 128\u2013129</ref><ref>John Radzilowski, ''A Traveller's History of Poland'',  pp. 39\u201341</ref>\n\n=== Reunification attempts and the reigns of Przemys\u0142 II and V\u00e1clav II (1232\u20131305) ===\n[[File:Jakub \u015awinka.PNG|thumb|left|185 px|Archbishop [[Jakub \u015awinka]]]]\n\nAs the disadvantages of national division were becoming increasingly apparent in various segments of the society, some of the Piast dukes began to make serious efforts aimed at the reunification of the Polish state. Important among the earlier attempts were the activities of the [[Silesian Piasts|Silesian dukes]] [[Henry I the Bearded]], his son [[Henry II the Pious]], who was killed in 1241 while fighting the Mongols at the [[Battle of Legnica]], and [[Henry IV Probus]]. In 1295, [[Przemys\u0142 II]] of [[Greater Poland]] became the first Piast duke crowned as King of Poland since Boles\u0142aw II, but he ruled over only a part of the territory of Poland (including [[Pomerelia|Gda\u0144sk Pomerania]] from 1294) and was assassinated soon after his coronation. A more extensive unification of Polish lands was accomplished by a foreign ruler, [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|V\u00e1clav II of Bohemia]] of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]], who married [[Elisabeth Richeza of Poland|Przemys\u0142's daughter Richeza]] and became King of Poland in 1300. V\u00e1clav's heavy-handed policies soon caused him to lose whatever support he had earlier in his reign; he died in 1305.\n\n[[File:Catedral de San Juan, Breslavia, Polonia, 2017-12-20, DD 14.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Wroc\u0142aw Cathedral|Cathedral of St. John the Baptist]] in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]]]\nAn important factor in the unification process was the Polish Church, which remained a single ecclesiastical province throughout the fragmentation period. Archbishop [[Jakub \u015awinka]] of Gniezno was an ardent proponent of Poland's reunification; he performed the crowning ceremonies for both Przemys\u0142 II and [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]]. \u015awinka supported [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high|W\u0142adys\u0142aw I \u0141okietek]] at various stages of the duke's career.\n\n=== Culture ===\n[[culture of medieval Poland|Culturally]], the social impact of the Church was considerably broader in the 13th century, as networks of parishes were established and cathedral-type schools became more common.  The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and the [[Franciscan]]s were the leading monastic orders at this time, and they interacted closely with the general population. A proliferation of narrative [[annals]] characterized the period, as well as other written records, laws and documents. More of the clergy were of local origin; others were expected to know the Polish language. [[Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek]], the author of an [[Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae|influential chronicle]], was the most recognized representative in the intellectual sphere.  ''Perspectiva'', a treatise on [[optics]] by [[Witelo]], a Silesian monk, was one of the finest achievements of [[Science in the Middle Ages|medieval science]]. The construction of churches and castles in the [[Gothic architecture]] style predominated in the 13th century; native elements in art forms were increasingly important, with significant advances taking place in agriculture, manufacturing and crafts.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 141\u2013144\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 141\u2013144</ref>\n\n== 14th century ==\n\n=== The reunited kingdom of the last Piast rulers; Jewish settlement ===\n[[File:W\u0142adys\u0142aw I sarcophagus figure.jpg|thumb|left|190 px|A fragment of a sandstone [[sarcophagus]] depicting [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]] in [[Wawel Cathedral]], Krak\u00f3w]]\n[[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]]  and his son [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir III, \"the Great\"]], were the last two rulers of the Piast dynasty of the unified kingdom of Poland of the 14th century.  Their rule was not a return to the Polish state as it existed before the period of fragmentation, because of the loss of internal cohesion and territorial integrity. The regional Piast princes remained strong, and for economic and cultural reasons, some of them gravitated toward Poland's neighbors. The kingdom lost Pomerania and Silesia, the most highly developed and economically important regions of the original ethnically Polish lands, which left half of the Polish population outside the kingdom's borders. The western losses had to do with the failure of the unification efforts undertaken by the [[Silesian Piasts|Silesian Piast]] dukes and the German expansion processes. These included the Piast principalities developing (or falling into) dependencies in respect to the German political structures, [[Ostsiedlung|settler colonization]] and gradual [[Germanisation|Germanization]] of the Polish ruling circles. The lower [[Vistula]] was controlled by the Teutonic Order. [[Masovia]] was not to be fully incorporated into the Polish state in the near future. Casimir stabilized the western and northern borders, tried to regain some of the lost territories, and partially compensated the losses by new eastern expansion that placed within his kingdom regions that were [[East Slavs|East Slavic]], thus ethnically non-Polish.<ref name=\"Lukowski 15\u201334\">Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 15\u201334</ref><ref name=\"Wyrozumski 145\u2013154\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 145\u2013154</ref>\n\nDespite the territorial truncation, 14th-century Poland experienced a period of accelerated economic development and increasing prosperity. This included further expansion and modernization of agricultural settlements, the development of towns and their greater role in briskly growing trade, mining and metallurgy.

It also created a legal precedent for the official protection of Jews from local harassment and exclusion.

When he died as the king of a partially reunited Poland, he left the kingdom in a precarious situation.  Although the area under King W\u0142adys\u0142aw's control was limited and many unresolved issues remained, he may have saved Poland's existence as a state.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 155\u2013160\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 155\u2013160</ref>\n\nSupported by his ally [[Charles I of Hungary]], W\u0142adys\u0142aw returned from exile and challenged [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|V\u00e1clav II]] and his successor [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia|V\u00e1clav III]] in the period 1304\u20131306. V\u00e1clav III's murder in 1306 terminated the Bohemian P\u0159emyslid dynasty and its involvement in Poland. Afterwards, W\u0142adys\u0142aw  completed the takeover of [[Lesser Poland]], entering Krak\u00f3w, and took the lands north of there, through Kuyavia all the way to [[Pomerelia|Gda\u0144sk Pomerania]]. In 1308, Pomerania was conquered by the Brandenburg state. In a recovery effort, W\u0142adys\u0142aw agreed to ask for help from the Teutonic Knights; the Knights brutally [[Teutonic takeover of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk)|took over Gda\u0144sk Pomerania]] and kept it for themselves.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 155\u2013160\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 155\u2013160</ref>\n\nIn 1311\u20131312, a [[rebellion of w\u00f3jt Albert|rebellion in Krak\u00f3w]] instigated by the city's [[patricianship|patrician]] leadership seeking rule by the [[House of Luxembourg]] was put down. This event may have had a limiting impact on the emerging political power of towns.<ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 23\u201324</ref>\n\nIn 1313\u20131314, W\u0142adys\u0142aw conquered [[Greater Poland]]. In 1320, he became the first king of Poland crowned in Krak\u00f3w's [[Wawel Cathedral]] instead of [[Gniezno]]. The coronation was hesitantly agreed to by [[Pope John XXII]] in spite of the opposition of King [[John of Bohemia]], who had also claimed the Polish crown. John undertook an expedition aimed at Krak\u00f3w in 1327, which he was compelled to abort; in 1328, he waged a crusade against Lithuania, during which he formalized an alliance with the Teutonic Order. The Order was in a state of [[Polish\u2013Teutonic War (1326\u20131332)|war with Poland]] from 1327 to 1332 (see [[Battle of P\u0142owce]]). As a result, the Knights captured [[Dobrzy\u0144 Land]] and [[Kujawy]]. W\u0142adys\u0142aw was helped by his alliances with Hungary (his daughter [[Elisabeth of Poland|Elizabeth]] was married to King [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles I]] in 1320) and Lithuania (in a pact of 1325 against the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic State]] and the marriage of W\u0142adys\u0142aw's son [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir]] to [[Aldona of Lithuania|Aldona]], daughter of the Lithuanian ruler [[Gediminas]]).<ref name=\"Chronology 74\u201375\">Ed.

A lasting achievement of King [[John of Bohemia]] (and a great loss to Poland) was his success in forcing most of the Piast Silesian principalities, often ambivalent about their loyalties, into [[allegiance]] between 1327 and 1329.<ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 14\u201326</ref>\n\n=== The reign of Casimir III the Great (1333\u20131370) ===\n[[File:Polska 1333 - 1370.png|250px|thumb|left|Poland at the end of the rule of [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III]] (1370) is shown within the dark red border; [[Silesia]] (yellow) was lost, while the kingdom had expanded to the east]]\n\nAfter the death of W\u0142adys\u0142aw I, the old monarch's 23-year-old son became King Casimir III, later known as [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir the Great]] (r. 1333\u20131370). Unlike his father, the new king demonstrated no attraction for the hardships of military life.  Casimir's contemporaries did not give him much of a chance of overcoming the country's mounting difficulties or succeeding as a ruler. But from the beginning, Casimir acted prudently, and in 1335, he purchased the claims of King John of Bohemia to the Polish throne.  In 1343, Casimir settled several high-level arbitration disputes with the Teutonic Order by a territorial compromise that culminated in the [[Treaty of Kalisz (1343)|Treaty of Kalisz]] of 1343. [[Dobrzy\u0144 Land]] and [[Kuyavia]] were recovered by Casimir. At that time, Poland started to expand to the east and through a series of military campaigns between 1340 and 1366, Casimir annexed the [[Halych]]\u2013[[Volodymyr-Volynskyi|Volodymyr]] [[Galicia-Volhynia|area of Rus']]. The town of [[Lviv]] there attracted newcomers of several nationalities, was granted [[Magdeburg rights|municipal rights]] in 1356, and had thus begun its career as [[Lviv|Lw\u00f3w]], the main Polish center in the midst of a [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] population. Supported by Hungary, the Polish king in 1338 promised the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Hungarian ruling house]] the Polish throne in the event he dies without male heirs.<ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 26\u201334</ref>\n\n[[File:Casimir III of Poland.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Foundation of the [[Collegiate church in Wi\u015blica]] by [[Casimir III the Great]]]]\n\nCasimir, who formally gave up his rights to several [[Silesia]]n principalities in 1339, unsuccessfully tried to recover the region by conducting military activities against the [[House of Luxembourg]] (the rulers of Bohemia) between 1343 and 1348, but then blocked the attempted separation of Silesia from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|Gniezno Archdiocese]] by Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]. Later, until his death, he pursued the Polish claim to Silesia legally by petitioning the pope; his successors did not continue his efforts.\n\nAllied with Denmark and Western Pomerania (Gda\u0144sk Pomerania was granted to the Order as an \"eternal charity\"), Casimir was able to impose some corrections on the western border. In 1365, [[Drezdenko]] and [[Santok]] became Poland's [[fiefdom|fiefs]], while the [[Wa\u0142cz]] district was taken outright in 1368. The latter action severed the land connection between Brandenburg and the Teutonic state and connected Poland with [[Farther Pomerania]].\n\nCasimir the Great considerably solidified the country's position in both foreign and domestic affairs. Domestically, he integrated and centralized the reunited Polish state and helped develop what was considered the \"[[Crown of the Polish Kingdom]]\": the state within its actual boundaries, as well as past or potential boundaries. Casimir established or strengthened kingdom-wide institutions (such as the powerful state treasury) independent of the regional, class, or royal court-related interests. Internationally, the Polish king was very active diplomatically; he cultivated close contacts with other European rulers and was a staunch defender of the Polish national interest. In 1364, he sponsored the [[Congress of Krak\u00f3w]], in which a number of monarchs participated, which was concerned with the promotion of peaceful cooperation and political balance in Central Europe.\n\n=== The reign of Louis I and Jadwiga (1370\u20131399) ===\n\n[[File:Jadwiga by Bacciarelli.jpg|left|thumb|180 px|[[Jadwiga of Poland|Queen Jadwiga]] was the great-granddaughter of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]]]]\n[[File:Zabudowa Wzg\u00f3rza Wawelskiego (widok z wie\u017cy ko\u015bcio\u0142a Mariackiego); A-7; PL-MA, Krak\u00f3w, Wawel.jpg|Zabudowa Wzg\u00f3rza Wawelskiego (widok z wie\u017cy ko\u015bcio\u0142a Mariackiego); A-7; PL-MA, Krak\u00f3w, Wawel|right|thumb|350 px|[[Wawel Castle]] in [[Krakow]]]]\nImmediately after Casimir's death in 1370, the heirless king's nephew [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis of Hungary]] of the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] assumed the Polish throne. As Casimir's actual commitment to the Anjou succession seemed problematic from the beginning (in 1368 the Polish king adopted his grandson, [[Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania|Casimir of S\u0142upsk]]), Louis engaged in succession negotiations with Polish knights and nobility starting in 1351. They supported him, exacting in return further guarantees and privileges for themselves; the formal act was negotiated in [[Buda]] in 1355. After his coronation, Louis returned to Hungary; he left his mother and [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir]]'s sister [[Elizabeth of Poland|Elizabeth]] in Poland as [[regent]]s.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 169\u2013173\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 169\u2013173</ref>\n\nWith the death of Casimir the Great, the period of hereditary (Piast) monarchy in Poland came to an end. The land owners and nobles did not want a strong monarchy; a constitutional monarchy was established between 1370 and 1493 that included the beginning of the [[general sejm]], the dominant bicameral parliament of the future.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 169\u2013173\"/>\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - CRACOVIA.png|thumb|right|Woodcut of Krak\u00f3w from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]], 1493]]\n\n\nDuring the reign of Louis I, Poland formed a [[Polish-Hungarian union]]. In the pact of 1374 (the [[Privilege of Koszyce]]), the Polish nobility was granted extensive concessions and agreed to extend the Anjou succession to Louis's daughters, as Louis had no sons. Louis's neglect of Polish affairs resulted in the loss of Casimir's territorial gains, including [[Halych]] [[Rus (name)|Rus']], which was recovered by Queen [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] in 1387. In 1396, Jadwiga and her husband [[Jogaila|Jagie\u0142\u0142o (Jogaila)]] forcefully annexed the central Polish lands separating [[Lesser Poland]] from [[Greater Poland]], previously granted by King Louis to his [[Silesian Piasts|Silesian Piast]] ally Duke [[Vladislaus II of Opole|W\u0142adys\u0142aw of Opole]].<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 169\u2013173\"/><ref name=\"Lukowski 42\u201344\">Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 42\u201344</ref>\n\nThe Hungarian-Polish union lasted for twelve years and ended in war. After Louis's death in 1382 and a power struggle that resulted in the [[Greater Poland Civil War]], the Polish nobility decided that Jadwiga, Louis's youngest daughter, should become the next \"King of Poland\"; Jadwiga arrived in 1384 and was crowned at the age of eleven. The failure of the union of Poland and Hungary paved the way for the [[Polish-Lithuanian union|union of Lithuania and Poland]].<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 169\u2013173\"/>\n\n=== Culture ===\nIn the 14th century, many large scale [[Architecture of medieval Poland|brick building projects]] were undertaken during Casimir's reign, including the construction of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches, castles, urban fortifications and homes of wealthy city residents.  The most notable examples of architecture from the medieval period in Poland are the many churches representing the [[Polish Gothic]] style; medieval sculpture, painting and ornamental smithery are best revealed in the furnishings of churches and liturgical items.  Polish law was first codified in the [[Statutes of Casimir the Great]] (the Piotrk\u00f3w\u2013Wi\u015blica Statutes) from 1346\u20131362.  Accordingly, conflict resolution relied on legal proceedings domestically, while bilateral or multilateral negotiations and treaties were increasingly important in international relations. By this time, the network of cathedral and parish schools had become well developed. In 1364, Casimir the Great established the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Krak\u00f3w]], the second oldest university in Central Europe. While many still traveled to southern and western Europe for university studies, the [[Old Polish language|Polish language]], along with the predominant [[Latin]], became increasingly more common in written documents. The [[Holy Cross Sermons]] (ca. early 14th century) constitute possibly the oldest extant Polish prose manuscript.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 173\u2013177\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 173\u2013177</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty]]\n* [[Culture of medieval Poland]]\n* [[Slavery in Poland]]\n* [[List of Polish monarchs]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n===Translations and transliterations===\n{{special characters}}{{reflist|group=\"trans\"|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Middle Ages}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Poland, Kingdom of, (1025-1385)}}\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1025]]\n[[Category:Kingdom of Poland| ]]\n[[Category:History of Poland during the Piast dynasty]]\n[[Category:1025 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:1380s disestablishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:14th-century disestablishments in Poland]]\n", "name_user": "2a00:23c5:5c06:3f00:840b:12e0:2c8:edf", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Poland_(1025%E2%80%931385)"}

There are varieties in Klinefelter Syndrome, where some cases may have the extra X chromosome in some cells but not others, referred to as Mosaic Klinefelter Syndrome, or where individuals have the extra X chromosome in all cells.

Typically two separate [[semen analysis|semen analyses]] will be required. The provider may order blood tests to look for hormone imbalances, medical conditions, or genetic issues.\n\n===Medical history===\nThe history should include prior testicular or penile insults ([[Testicular torsion|torsion]], [[cryptorchidism]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]]), [[infections]] ([[mumps]] [[orchitis]], [[epididymitis]]), environmental factors, excessive heat, [[radiation]], medications, and drug use ([[anabolic steroids]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[smoking]]).\n\nSexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of [[lubricant]]s, and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.\n\nLoss of [[libido]] and [[headaches]] or [[visual disturbances]] may indicate a [[pituitary tumor]].\n\nThe past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), [[diabetic neuropathy]] ([[retrograde ejaculation]]), radical pelvic or [[retroperitoneal]] surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or [[hernia repair]] (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply).\n\nA [[family history]] may reveal genetic problems.\n\n===Physical examination===\nUsually, the patient disrobes completely and puts on a gown. The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination of the [[human penis|penis]], [[scrotum]], [[testicles]], I [[vas deferens]], [[spermatic cord]]s, [[ejaculatory ducts]], [[urethra]], [[urinary bladder]], [[anus]] and [[rectum]]. An [[orchidometer]] can measure testicular volume, which in turn is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters.<ref name=\"LottiMaggi2014\"/> A physical exam of the scrotum can reveal a [[varicocele]], but the impact of detecting and surgically correct a varicocele on sperm parameters or overall male fertility is debated.<ref name=\"LottiMaggi2014\"/>\n\n===Sperm sample===\n\n==== Semen sample obtaining ====\nSemen sample obtaining is the first step in spermiogram. The optimal sexual abstinence for semen sample obtaining is of 2\u20137 days. The first way to obtain the semen sample is through masturbation, and the best place to obtain it is in the same clinic, as this way temperature changes during transport can be avoided, which can be lethal for some spermatozoa.\n\nA single semen sample is not determining for disease diagnosis, so two different samples have to be analyzed with an interval between them of seven days to three months, as sperm production is a cyclic process. It is prudent to ask about possible sample loss, as that could mask true results of spermiogram.\n\nTo obtain the sample, a sterile plastic recipient is put directly inside, always no more than one hour before being studied. Conventional preservatives shouldn't be used, as they have chemical substances as lubricants or spermicides that could damage the sample. If preservatives have to be used, for cases of religious ethics in which masturbation is forbidden, a preservative with holes is used. In case of paraplegia it is possible to use mechanic tools or [[electroejaculation]].\n\nThe sample should never be obtained through coitus interruptus for several reasons:\n\n*Some part of ejaculation could be lost.\n*Bacterial contamination could happen.\n*The acid vaginal pH could be deleterious for sperm motility.\n\nAlso is very important to label the sample correctly the recipient with patient identification, date, hour, abstinence days, among other data required to be known.\n\n{{Main|Semen analysis}}\n{{Further|Semen quality}}\nThe volume of the semen sample, approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured.

Further, in an infertility situation, the fertility of the female needs to be considered.\n\nPre-testicular conditions can often be addressed by medical means or interventions.\n\nTesticular-based male infertility tends to be resistant to medication.

This extra chromosome directly affects sexual development before birth and during puberty (links to learning disabilities and speech development have also been shown to be affected). There are varieties in Klinefelter Syndrome, where some cases may have the extra X chromosome in some cells but not others, referred to as Mosaic Klinefelter Syndrome, or where individuals have the extra X chromosome in all cells.

Typically two separate [[semen analysis|semen analyses]] will be required. The provider may order blood tests to look for hormone imbalances, medical conditions, or genetic issues.\n\n===Medical history===\nThe history should include prior testicular or penile insults ([[Testicular torsion|torsion]], [[cryptorchidism]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]]), [[infections]] ([[mumps]] [[orchitis]], [[epididymitis]]), environmental factors, excessive heat, [[radiation]], medications, and drug use ([[anabolic steroids]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[smoking]]).\n\nSexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of [[lubricant]]s, and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.\n\nLoss of [[libido]] and [[headaches]] or [[visual disturbances]] may indicate a [[pituitary tumor]].\n\nThe past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), [[diabetic neuropathy]] ([[retrograde ejaculation]]), radical pelvic or [[retroperitoneal]] surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or [[hernia repair]] (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply).\n\nA [[family history]] may reveal genetic problems.\n\n===Physical examination===\nUsually, the patient disrobes completely and puts on a gown. The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination of the [[human penis|penis]], [[scrotum]], [[testicles]], I [[vas deferens]], [[spermatic cord]]s, [[ejaculatory ducts]], [[urethra]], [[urinary bladder]], [[anus]] and [[rectum]]. An [[orchidometer]] can measure testicular volume, which in turn is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters.<ref name=\"LottiMaggi2014\"/> A physical exam of the scrotum can reveal a [[varicocele]], but the impact of detecting and surgically correct a varicocele on sperm parameters or overall male fertility is debated.<ref name=\"LottiMaggi2014\"/>\n\n===Sperm sample===\n\n==== Semen sample obtaining ====\nSemen sample obtaining is the first step in spermiogram. The optimal sexual abstinence for semen sample obtaining is of 2\u20137 days. The first way to obtain the semen sample is through masturbation, and the best place to obtain it is in the same clinic, as this way temperature changes during transport can be avoided, which can be lethal for some spermatozoa.\n\nA single semen sample is not determining for disease diagnosis, so two different samples have to be analyzed with an interval between them of seven days to three months, as sperm production is a cyclic process. It is prudent to ask about possible sample loss, as that could mask true results of spermiogram.\n\nTo obtain the sample, a sterile plastic recipient is put directly inside, always no more than one hour before being studied. Conventional preservatives shouldn't be used, as they have chemical substances as lubricants or spermicides that could damage the sample. If preservatives have to be used, for cases of religious ethics in which masturbation is forbidden, a preservative with holes is used. In case of paraplegia it is possible to use mechanic tools or [[electroejaculation]].\n\nThe sample should never be obtained through coitus interruptus for several reasons:\n\n*Some part of ejaculation could be lost.\n*Bacterial contamination could happen.\n*The acid vaginal pH could be deleterious for sperm motility.\n\nAlso is very important to label the sample correctly the recipient with patient identification, date, hour, abstinence days, among other data required to be known.\n\n{{Main|Semen analysis}}\n{{Further|Semen quality}}\nThe volume of the semen sample, approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured.

It was authorised in 1776, although part had already been built, as the proprietors believed that an Act of Parliament obtained in 1730 gave them the necessary powers. Opened in 1779, it was a commercial success, its main cargo being coal. It was {{convert|8|mi|km}} in length and had a rise of {{cvt|102|ft|5|in|m}} through 12 [[Lock (water transport)|locks]].<ref name=JP>{{harvnb |Priestley |1831 |pp=606\u2013608}}</ref> Following the opening of the [[Thames and Severn Canal]] in 1789, it formed part of a through route from [[Bristol]] to [[London]], although much of its trade vanished when the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] provided a more direct route in 1810. Despite competition from the railways, the canal continued to pay dividends to shareholders until 1922, and was not finally abandoned until 1954.\n\nEven before its closure, there was interest in retaining the canal for its amenity value. The Stroudwater Canal Society, which later became the [[Cotswold Canals Trust]], was formed in 1972. Following initial hostility from the Proprietors, who had not been stripped of their powers when the canal had closed, agreement was reached and work began on restoration of the waterway. The project gained popularity, and in 2003, a bid was made to the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] for \u00a382&nbsp;million to restore both the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal. The project had to be split into smaller parts, and only the first phase has so far been funded in this way, when a grant of \u00a311.9&nbsp;million was confirmed in 2006. With match funding, this was to enable the section from 'The Ocean' at Stonehouse to Wallbridge to be reopened, together with the Wallbridge to Brimscombe Port section of the Thames and Severn.\n\nA second bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund for the connection from Stonehouse to the [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]] at Saul was rejected in 2007. This section presents some engineering challenges, as it was severed by the construction of the [[M5 motorway]] and the [[A38 road]]. The roundabout where the A38 joins the [[A419 road]] was built over Bristol Road Lock, and part of the route was destroyed by flood relief work for the [[River Frome, Stroud|River Frome]]. At Stonehouse, the bridge carrying the [[Bristol and Gloucester Railway]] has been replaced by a culvert, but a bid has been made to the newly formed Gloucestershire Local Transport Board for its reinstatement, and to create a long-distance footpath along the route. Outside the main restoration, the Cotswold Canals Trust are gradually restoring many of the other structures, with the ultimate goal of re-opening a link between the [[River Thames]] and the [[River Severn]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction===\nThe first plans for making the small [[River Frome, Stroud|River Frome]], also known as the Stroudwater,{{sfn |Herbert |Pugh |1976 |pp=99\u2013104}} navigable date back to the last three years of the 17th century. The plan was to serve the [[woollen]] industry, by carrying coal from the Severn to Stroud and transporting the finished cloth away to markets, but it was opposed by mill owners, and it came to nothing. The idea was revived in 1728, when [[John Hore]], who had previously succeeded in making the [[River Kennet]] navigable, suggested a canal around {{convert|8.2|mi|km}} long, with 12 locks, suitable for 60-ton barges. An [[Act of Parliament]] was obtained in 1730, with support from those who worked in the cloth industry, but opposition from some of the millers, but it seemed to ignore Hore's recommendations, in that it was again based on making the river navigable. As the millers were given powers which would have effectively shut the navigation for two months each year, and the tolls were set at a level which would have discouraged traffic, no further action was taken.<ref name=hadfield295>{{harvnb |Hadfield |1969 |p=295}}</ref>\n\nJohn Dallaway, who had been appointed as a commissioner under the 1730 Act, commissioned the engineer [[Thomas Yeoman]] to make a new survey in 1754, and his new plan was published the following year. It was for a navigation from Wallbridge to the Severn, estimated to cost \u00a38,145, which would require 16 locks and four stanks (which were probably half-locks or staunches). In order to placate the millers, water for the operation of the locks would be provided by a reservoir below Wallbridge, which would cover {{convert|2|acre|ha|1}} and be filled on Sundays, when the mills were inactive and would not be needing the water. Tolls were set at a more realistic level. While support and finance for the scheme were being gained, John Kemmett, Arthur Wynde, James Pynock and Thomas Bridge devised a scheme which used cranes at each mill weir to transfer cargo, stored in boxes, from a boat on one level to another on the other side of the weir.{{sfn|Hadfield |1969 |pp=295\u2013296}} An Act was obtained in 1759 which authorized Kemmett and the others to construct the canal without any locks to avoid loss of water to the mills.<ref name=JP/> The Act allowed two years for completion of the scheme, and although some progress had been made by April 1761, Kemmett was given an extension of six years at that time. After about {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} of river had been improved, the works were abandoned as being too costly.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |pp=296\u2013297}}\n\nBy 1774, canal building was much better understood, and a new attempt was made. The plan was led by Dallaway's son William, who asked [[Thomas Dadford Jr.]] (the engineer on the [[Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal]]) and John Priddy (who had been the engineer on the [[Droitwich Canal]] during its construction) to carry out a survey. The cost of a canal which avoided the river and hence the mills, was put at \u00a316,750, and soon \u00a320,000 had been raised. Deciding that they did not need a new Act of Parliament, since the powers of the 1730 Act were still valid, Yeoman, who had carried out the 1754 survey, was asked to survey the route again, and a route was selected, which would require 12 locks. Work started, with Samuel Jones as engineer, but he was replaced by Priddy within a month.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |pp=297\u2013298}} A challenge to the legality of building a canal under the 1730 Act was mounted by landowners and millers in 1775. An injunction was obtained, and the Gloucestershire [[Assizes]] ruled that the Act did not cover the work. A new Act was obtained on 25 March 1776, authorising the raising of \u00a320,000 and an extra \u00a310,000 if required. Both sides commissioned the writing of poems to support their causes.{{sfn|Hadfield |1969 |pp=298\u2013300}}\n\nWork resumed under the supervision of Priddy, but he was soon replaced by Edmund Lingard, who had been the engineer for the [[Coventry Canal]]. The canal was opened in stages as it was completed. It reached Chippenham Platt at the end of 1777, Ryeford in January 1779, and it was open throughout to the Wallbridge terminus on 21 July 1779. It had cost \u00a340,930, which had been raised by calling \u00a3150 on each \u00a3100 share, by borrowing money from the shareholders, by running up debts, and by using the tolls from the parts of the canal which were already open. Traffic was around 16,000 tons per year, which enabled the company to repay the debts and to declare a first dividend of five per cent in 1786.<ref name=hadfield301>{{harvnb |Hadfield |1969 |pp=300\u2013301}}</ref>\n\n===Operation===\nThe locks were suitably sized for Severn [[Trow]]s, which were {{convert|72|by|15+1/2|ft|m}}, and could carry 60 tons. The canal was not provided with a [[towpath|towing path]] for horses. Some boats sailed along the canal, but most were bow-hauled by men. [[Framilode]] lock at the entrance to the canal was a tide lock, with multiple gates to cope with all states of the tide. When a vessel arrived at the junction, a rope would be taken from it to the shore, and attached to a [[Capstan (nautical)|capstan]], which would then be used to haul the boat into the lock. Once the canal was open, the Proprietors worked hard to improve the facilities, and a number of warehouses were built. Many of the shareholders were also involved with the [[Thames and Severn Canal]] scheme, which was completed in 1789 and provided a through route between Wallbridge and the [[River Thames]] at [[Lechlade]]. The navigation was seen as a commercial waterway; pleasure boats were discouraged by the imposition of a charge of \u00a31 (in 2016: \u00a3{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|1|1777|2016}}}}) for the use of each lock.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |p=301}}\n\nThe main cargo carried was coal. In 1788, a group of shareholders set up a coal committee, and began trading. At first, the product came from the Staffordshire coalfields, travelling via the [[Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal]], or from the Shropshire coalfields, but this was later supplemented by coal from the south Gloucestershire mines and then the [[Forest of Dean]]. This profitable business continued until 1833.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |p=302}} Boats that worked the canal included Severn Trows, a type of sailing boat which was fitted with [[ketch]], [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] or [[sloop]] rigging. Many were later converted for use as dumb barges by removing the masts, but none are known to have survived to the present day.<ref name=shell>{{harvnb |McKnight |1981 |p=140}}</ref>\n\nIn 1794, a basin was built above Framilode lock, so that vessels could wait there until the tide in the Severn was at a suitable level. This had been requested by the Thames and Severn Canal company, but requests for a horse towing path in 1799 and 1812 were dismissed as too expensive. They eventually provided one after the [[Gloucester and Berkeley Canal]] had been built, and the canal was the only part of the waterway from [[Shrewsbury]] on the Severn to [[Teddington]] on the Thames that did not have one. It was completed in August 1827.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |p=304}} The opening of the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal in 1825 required a slight diversion where they crossed at Saul, and the levels were adjusted by building a new lock on the Stroudwater below the junction, to ensure neither company lost water to the other; the new company paid for its construction.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |pp=303\u2013304}} After the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal opened to [[Sharpness]] in 1827, the link between Saul and the Severn at Framilode was used much less, although coal from the Forest of Dean still used that route.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |p=305}}\n\nTraffic, receipts and dividends steadily increased. Tolls rose from \u00a31,468 in 1779 to \u00a36,807 in 1821. The first dividend of 3.75 per cent was paid in 1786, and had reached 15.78 per cent by 1821. Figures for tonnage are not available for the early years, but were 79,359 tons in 1821. There was a dip in the carriage of merchandise in 1810, when the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] opened and provided a more convenient route from Bristol to London, but it picked up again after 1819, when the North Wilts Canal opened, providing a link from [[Latton, Wiltshire|Latton]] near Cricklade to [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]] via [[Swindon]] and the [[Wilts and Berks Canal]], which was easier than using the Thames.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |p=306}} The highest dividend paid was in 1833, when shareholders received 26.33 per cent, after which receipts and dividends steadily dropped.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |p=312}} In 1859, in order to allow the passage of a coal barge called the ''Queen Esther'', two of the locks were widened.<ref name=hadfield311>{{harvnb |Hadfield |1969 |p=311}}</ref>\n\n===Decline===\n[[File:Stroudwater Canal culvert under Bristol and Gloucester Line - geograph.org.uk - 1052870.jpg|thumb|right|The bridge under the Bristol to Gloucester railway line at Ocean was replaced by a culvert in the 1960s.]]\nThe first threat from a railway came in 1825, when there was a proposal for a line from Framilode Passage to Brimscombe Port. The canal tolls were reduced as a bargaining tool, but the promoters went ahead with their bill. The Stroudwater Company opposed it and it was defeated in Parliament.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |p=309}} The [[Great Western Railway]] opened a line from [[Golden Valley line|Swindon to Gloucester]] in 1845, which passed through Stroud, but the effects on the canal were rather less than the effects on the Thames and Severn.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |p=310}} However, in 1863 the [[Stonehouse and Nailsworth Railway]] Act was passed, allowing the construction of a railway from [[Stonehouse, Gloucestershire|Stonehouse]] to [[Dudbridge]] and [[Nailsworth]] that directly competed with the canal.<ref name=hadfield311/> Dividends fell below 5 per cent after 1880, although they did not cease entirely until 1922.<ref name=hadfield313>{{harvnb |Hadfield |1969 |p=313}}</ref> Around the same time the connection to the Severn at [[Framilode]] became blocked, leaving the connection to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal as the only link between the canal and the River Severn.<ref name=green>{{harvnb |Green |1999 |pp=29\u201331}}</ref>  The last toll was paid in 1941, and most of the canal was formally abandoned by an Act of Parliament granted in 1954.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |p=314}} Although this removed the need to maintain the waterway for navigation, the Company of Proprietors was not disbanded, and retained most of their other powers. It consists of those who now own the original shares, although over half of the shares were transferred to a Trust in the 1950s, which prevents hostile takeovers and ensures that the company will always be run for the benefit of the communities through which the canal passes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stroudwater.co.uk/cpsn/about%20us.html |title=About Us |publisher=Proprietors of the Stroudwater Navigation}}</ref> After the closure of the canal, the canal company continued to generate income for many years through the sale of water and some monies produced by property holdings.<ref name=green/>\n\n==Restoration==\n[[File:Stroudwater.jpg|thumbnail|left|The restored canal to the west of Ebley Mill is flanked by a new housing development.]]\nInterest in maintaining the canal for its amenity value began before the canal closed, with the [[Inland Waterways Association]] mounting a campaign to retain it when plans to close it were first announced in 1952. They were already formulating plans for the revival of the [[Thames and Severn Canal]], which depended on the Stroudwater for its link to the River Severn. The National Parks Commission declared that it should be retained for its amenity value and beauty in 1954, but it was closed nevertheless.{{sfn |Squires |2008 |pp=31,34}}\n\nThe publication in 1972 of ''Lost Canals of England and Wales'', a book by Ronald Russell, resulted in a number of canal restoration societies being formed. The Stroudwater Canal Society was one of them, which was renamed the Stroudwater, Thames and Severn Canal Trust in April 1975 as the scope of the project expanded,{{sfn |Squires |2008 |p=78}} and became the [[Cotswold Canals Trust]] in July 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cotswoldcanals.com/media/download_gallery/1990%20-%201999/Trow_070_Sept_1990.pdf |title=Trow Vol 70 |publisher=Cotswold Canals Trust |date=September 1990 |page=8}}</ref> Although the Proprietors were initially hostile to the Trust, attitudes changed,<ref name=SN-heritage>{{cite web |url=http://www.stroudwater.co.uk/cpsn/heritage.html |title=Heritage |publisher=Proprietors of the Stroudwater Navigation}}</ref> and in 1979 granted them permission to start work on the section from Pike Mill Bridge to Ryeford, so that a trip-boat could be used on it.{{sfn |Squires |2008 |p=102}} As attitudes changed, the Proprietors bought back sections of the waterway which had previously been sold off.<ref name=SN-heritage/>\n\n===Funding===\nIn 2001, the Cotswold Canals Partnership was established, drawing together people representing the Proprietors, the Cotswold Canals Trust, councils at district and county level, and a number of other interested parties.

The estimated cost of the project to restore both the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal was \u00a382&nbsp;million.{{sfn |Squires |2008 |p=154}}\n\nHaving raised \u00a3100,000, the Cotswold Canals Trust lodged the money with the Waterways Trust, in the hope that it could be used as match funding for any grants that might be received. Andy Stumpf became the full-time Regeneration Programme Manager, working on a major bid application to the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] (HLF) to finance the restoration, and the canal was visited by [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], in his capacity as Patron of the Waterways Trust.{{sfn |Squires |2008 |p=156}} A Heritage Survey, which cost \u00a360,000 and was funded by the [[Inland Waterways Association]], was carried out, as was a Community Development Plan and a Visitor Management Strategy, costing another \u00a330,000, all of which were pre-requisites for the main HLF bid.{{sfn |Squires |2008 |p=158}} By the time the bid was ready for submission, the HLF were under pressure for the funds they had, and asked British Waterways, who were heading up the application, to break the bid and the project into smaller phases. At the end of 2003, a provisional grant of \u00a311.3&nbsp;million was awarded by the HLF, to enable the restoration of the Stroudwater Navigation between [[Stonehouse, Gloucestershire|Stonehouse]] and Wallbridge, and the Thames and Severn Canal between Wallbridge and [[Brimscombe]] Port. An additional \u00a32.9&nbsp;million was received from the European Inter-Regional budget for this first phase.{{sfn |Squires |2008 |p=164}} By the time the grant was awarded in January 2006, it had risen to \u00a311.9&nbsp;million, and a further \u00a36&nbsp;million of match funding was received from the South West of England Regional Development Agency.<ref name=ccp/>\n\nAs part of the process, the Proprietors leased the canal to British Waterways in 2005. However, British Waterways had to withdraw from the scheme in 2008, due to financial difficulties, and the role of project leaders was taken over by [[Stroud District Council]]. Following the reorganisation, the Stroud Valleys Canal Company was established<ref name=SN-heritage/> in March 2009.

It was authorised in 1776, although part had already been built, as the proprietors believed that an Act of Parliament obtained in 1730 gave them the necessary powers. Opened in 1779, it was a commercial success, its main cargo being coal. It was {{convert|8|mi|km}} in length and had a rise of {{cvt|102|ft|5|in|m}} through 12 [[Lock (water transport)|locks]].<ref name=JP>{{harvnb |Priestley |1831 |pp=606\u2013608}}</ref> Following the opening of the [[Thames and Severn Canal]] in 1789, it formed part of a through route from [[Bristol]] to [[London]], although much of its trade vanished when the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] provided a more direct route in 1810. Despite competition from the railways, the canal continued to pay dividends to shareholders until 1922, and was not finally abandoned until 1954.\n\nEven before its closure, there was interest in retaining the canal for its amenity value. The Stroudwater Canal Society, which later became the [[Cotswold Canals Trust]], was formed in 1972. Following initial hostility from the Proprietors, who had not been stripped of their powers when the canal had closed, agreement was reached and work began on restoration of the waterway. The project gained popularity, and in 2003, a bid was made to the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] for \u00a382&nbsp;million to restore both the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal. The project had to be split into smaller parts, and only the first phase has so far been funded in this way, when a grant of \u00a311.9&nbsp;million was confirmed in 2006. With match funding, this was to enable the section from 'The Ocean' at Stonehouse to Wallbridge to be reopened, together with the Wallbridge to Brimscombe Port section of the Thames and Severn.\n\nA second bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund for the connection from Stonehouse to the [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]] at Saul was rejected in 2007. This section presents some engineering challenges, as it was severed by the construction of the [[M5 motorway]] and the [[A38 road]]. The roundabout where the A38 joins the [[A419 road]] was built over Bristol Road Lock, and part of the route was destroyed by flood relief work for the [[River Frome, Stroud|River Frome]]. At Stonehouse, the bridge carrying the [[Bristol and Gloucester Railway]] has been replaced by a culvert, but a bid has been made to the newly formed Gloucestershire Local Transport Board for its reinstatement, and to create a long-distance footpath along the route. Outside the main restoration, the Cotswold Canals Trust are gradually restoring many of the other structures, with the ultimate goal of re-opening a link between the [[River Thames]] and the [[River Severn]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction===\nThe first plans for making the small [[River Frome, Stroud|River Frome]], also known as the Stroudwater,{{sfn |Herbert |Pugh |1976 |pp=99\u2013104}} navigable date back to the last three years of the 17th century. The plan was to serve the [[woollen]] industry, by carrying coal from the Severn to Stroud and transporting the finished cloth away to markets, but it was opposed by mill owners, and it came to nothing. The idea was revived in 1728, when [[John Hore]], who had previously succeeded in making the [[River Kennet]] navigable, suggested a canal around {{convert|8.2|mi|km}} long, with 12 locks, suitable for 60-ton barges. An [[Act of Parliament]] was obtained in 1730, with support from those who worked in the cloth industry, but opposition from some of the millers, but it seemed to ignore Hore's recommendations, in that it was again based on making the river navigable. As the millers were given powers which would have effectively shut the navigation for two months each year, and the tolls were set at a level which would have discouraged traffic, no further action was taken.<ref name=hadfield295>{{harvnb |Hadfield |1969 |p=295}}</ref>\n\nJohn Dallaway, who had been appointed as a commissioner under the 1730 Act, commissioned the engineer [[Thomas Yeoman]] to make a new survey in 1754, and his new plan was published the following year. It was for a navigation from Wallbridge to the Severn, estimated to cost \u00a38,145, which would require 16 locks and four stanks (which were probably half-locks or staunches). In order to placate the millers, water for the operation of the locks would be provided by a reservoir below Wallbridge, which would cover {{convert|2|acre|ha|1}} and be filled on Sundays, when the mills were inactive and would not be needing the water. Tolls were set at a more realistic level. While support and finance for the scheme were being gained, John Kemmett, Arthur Wynde, James Pynock and Thomas Bridge devised a scheme which used cranes at each mill weir to transfer cargo, stored in boxes, from a boat on one level to another on the other side of the weir.{{sfn|Hadfield |1969 |pp=295\u2013296}} An Act was obtained in 1759 which authorized Kemmett and the others to construct the canal without any locks to avoid loss of water to the mills.<ref name=JP/> The Act allowed two years for completion of the scheme, and although some progress had been made by April 1761, Kemmett was given an extension of six years at that time. After about {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} of river had been improved, the works were abandoned as being too costly.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |pp=296\u2013297}}\n\nBy 1774, canal building was much better understood, and a new attempt was made. The plan was led by Dallaway's son William, who asked [[Thomas Dadford Jr.]] (the engineer on the [[Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal]]) and John Priddy (who had been the engineer on the [[Droitwich Canal]] during its construction) to carry out a survey. The cost of a canal which avoided the river and hence the mills, was put at \u00a316,750, and soon \u00a320,000 had been raised. Deciding that they did not need a new Act of Parliament, since the powers of the 1730 Act were still valid, Yeoman, who had carried out the 1754 survey, was asked to survey the route again, and a route was selected, which would require 12 locks. Work started, with Samuel Jones as engineer, but he was replaced by Priddy within a month.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |pp=297\u2013298}} A challenge to the legality of building a canal under the 1730 Act was mounted by landowners and millers in 1775. An injunction was obtained, and the Gloucestershire [[Assizes]] ruled that the Act did not cover the work. A new Act was obtained on 25 March 1776, authorising the raising of \u00a320,000 and an extra \u00a310,000 if required. Both sides commissioned the writing of poems to support their causes.{{sfn|Hadfield |1969 |pp=298\u2013300}}\n\nWork resumed under the supervision of Priddy, but he was soon replaced by Edmund Lingard, who had been the engineer for the [[Coventry Canal]]. The canal was opened in stages as it was completed. It reached Chippenham Platt at the end of 1777, Ryeford in January 1779, and it was open throughout to the Wallbridge terminus on 21 July 1779. It had cost \u00a340,930, which had been raised by calling \u00a3150 on each \u00a3100 share, by borrowing money from the shareholders, by running up debts, and by using the tolls from the parts of the canal which were already open. Traffic was around 16,000 tons per year, which enabled the company to repay the debts and to declare a first dividend of five per cent in 1786.<ref name=hadfield301>{{harvnb |Hadfield |1969 |pp=300\u2013301}}</ref>\n\n===Operation===\nThe locks were suitably sized for Severn [[Trow]]s, which were {{convert|72|by|15+1/2|ft|m}}, and could carry 60 tons. The canal was not provided with a [[towpath|towing path]] for horses. Some boats sailed along the canal, but most were bow-hauled by men. [[Framilode]] lock at the entrance to the canal was a tide lock, with multiple gates to cope with all states of the tide. When a vessel arrived at the junction, a rope would be taken from it to the shore, and attached to a [[Capstan (nautical)|capstan]], which would then be used to haul the boat into the lock. Once the canal was open, the Proprietors worked hard to improve the facilities, and a number of warehouses were built. Many of the shareholders were also involved with the [[Thames and Severn Canal]] scheme, which was completed in 1789 and provided a through route between Wallbridge and the [[River Thames]] at [[Lechlade]]. The navigation was seen as a commercial waterway; pleasure boats were discouraged by the imposition of a charge of \u00a31 (in 2016: \u00a3{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|1|1777|2016}}}}) for the use of each lock.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |p=301}}\n\nThe main cargo carried was coal. In 1788, a group of shareholders set up a coal committee, and began trading. At first, the product came from the Staffordshire coalfields, travelling via the [[Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal]], or from the Shropshire coalfields, but this was later supplemented by coal from the south Gloucestershire mines and then the [[Forest of Dean]]. This profitable business continued until 1833.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |p=302}} Boats that worked the canal included Severn Trows, a type of sailing boat which was fitted with [[ketch]], [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] or [[sloop]] rigging. Many were later converted for use as dumb barges by removing the masts, but none are known to have survived to the present day.<ref name=shell>{{harvnb |McKnight |1981 |p=140}}</ref>\n\nIn 1794, a basin was built above Framilode lock, so that vessels could wait there until the tide in the Severn was at a suitable level. This had been requested by the Thames and Severn Canal company, but requests for a horse towing path in 1799 and 1812 were dismissed as too expensive. They eventually provided one after the [[Gloucester and Berkeley Canal]] had been built, and the canal was the only part of the waterway from [[Shrewsbury]] on the Severn to [[Teddington]] on the Thames that did not have one. It was completed in August 1827.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |p=304}} The opening of the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal in 1825 required a slight diversion where they crossed at Saul, and the levels were adjusted by building a new lock on the Stroudwater below the junction, to ensure neither company lost water to the other; the new company paid for its construction.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |pp=303\u2013304}} After the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal opened to [[Sharpness]] in 1827, the link between Saul and the Severn at Framilode was used much less, although coal from the Forest of Dean still used that route.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |p=305}}\n\nTraffic, receipts and dividends steadily increased. Tolls rose from \u00a31,468 in 1779 to \u00a36,807 in 1821. The first dividend of 3.75 per cent was paid in 1786, and had reached 15.78 per cent by 1821. Figures for tonnage are not available for the early years, but were 79,359 tons in 1821. There was a dip in the carriage of merchandise in 1810, when the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] opened and provided a more convenient route from Bristol to London, but it picked up again after 1819, when the North Wilts Canal opened, providing a link from [[Latton, Wiltshire|Latton]] near Cricklade to [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]] via [[Swindon]] and the [[Wilts and Berks Canal]], which was easier than using the Thames.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |p=306}} The highest dividend paid was in 1833, when shareholders received 26.33 per cent, after which receipts and dividends steadily dropped.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |p=312}} In 1859, in order to allow the passage of a coal barge called the ''Queen Esther'', two of the locks were widened.<ref name=hadfield311>{{harvnb |Hadfield |1969 |p=311}}</ref>\n\n===Decline===\n[[File:Stroudwater Canal culvert under Bristol and Gloucester Line - geograph.org.uk - 1052870.jpg|thumb|right|The bridge under the Bristol to Gloucester railway line at Ocean was replaced by a culvert in the 1960s.]]\nThe first threat from a railway came in 1825, when there was a proposal for a line from Framilode Passage to Brimscombe Port. The canal tolls were reduced as a bargaining tool, but the promoters went ahead with their bill. The Stroudwater Company opposed it and it was defeated in Parliament.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |p=309}} The [[Great Western Railway]] opened a line from [[Golden Valley line|Swindon to Gloucester]] in 1845, which passed through Stroud, but the effects on the canal were rather less than the effects on the Thames and Severn.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |p=310}} However, in 1863 the [[Stonehouse and Nailsworth Railway]] Act was passed, allowing the construction of a railway from [[Stonehouse, Gloucestershire|Stonehouse]] to [[Dudbridge]] and [[Nailsworth]] that directly competed with the canal.<ref name=hadfield311/> Dividends fell below 5 per cent after 1880, although they did not cease entirely until 1922.<ref name=hadfield313>{{harvnb |Hadfield |1969 |p=313}}</ref> Around the same time the connection to the Severn at [[Framilode]] became blocked, leaving the connection to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal as the only link between the canal and the River Severn.<ref name=green>{{harvnb |Green |1999 |pp=29\u201331}}</ref>  The last toll was paid in 1941, and most of the canal was formally abandoned by an Act of Parliament granted in 1954.{{sfn |Hadfield |1969 |p=314}} Although this removed the need to maintain the waterway for navigation, the Company of Proprietors was not disbanded, and retained most of their other powers. It consists of those who now own the original shares, although over half of the shares were transferred to a Trust in the 1950s, which prevents hostile takeovers and ensures that the company will always be run for the benefit of the communities through which the canal passes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stroudwater.co.uk/cpsn/about%20us.html |title=About Us |publisher=Proprietors of the Stroudwater Navigation}}</ref> After the closure of the canal, the canal company continued to generate income for many years through the sale of water and some monies produced by property holdings.<ref name=green/>\n\n==Restoration==\n[[File:Stroudwater.jpg|thumbnail|left|The restored canal to the west of Ebley Mill is flanked by a new housing development.]]\nInterest in maintaining the canal for its amenity value began before the canal closed, with the [[Inland Waterways Association]] mounting a campaign to retain it when plans to close it were first announced in 1952. They were already formulating plans for the revival of the [[Thames and Severn Canal]], which depended on the Stroudwater for its link to the River Severn. The National Parks Commission declared that it should be retained for its amenity value and beauty in 1954, but it was closed nevertheless.{{sfn |Squires |2008 |pp=31,34}}\n\nThe publication in 1972 of ''Lost Canals of England and Wales'', a book by Ronald Russell, resulted in a number of canal restoration societies being formed.

The estimated cost of the project to restore both the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal was \u00a382&nbsp;million.{{sfn |Squires |2008 |p=154}}\n\nHaving raised \u00a3100,000, the Cotswold Canals Trust lodged the money with the Waterways Trust, in the hope that it could be used as match funding for any grants that might be received. Andy Stumpf became the full-time Regeneration Programme Manager, working on a major bid application to the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] (HLF) to finance the restoration, and the canal was visited by [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], in his capacity as Patron of the Waterways Trust.{{sfn |Squires |2008 |p=156}} A Heritage Survey, which cost \u00a360,000 and was funded by the [[Inland Waterways Association]], was carried out, as was a Community Development Plan and a Visitor Management Strategy, costing another \u00a330,000, all of which were pre-requisites for the main HLF bid.{{sfn |Squires |2008 |p=158}} By the time the bid was ready for submission, the HLF were under pressure for the funds they had, and asked British Waterways, who were heading up the application, to break the bid and the project into smaller phases. At the end of 2003, a provisional grant of \u00a311.3&nbsp;million was awarded by the HLF, to enable the restoration of the Stroudwater Navigation between [[Stonehouse, Gloucestershire|Stonehouse]] and Wallbridge, and the Thames and Severn Canal between Wallbridge and [[Brimscombe]] Port.

However, British Waterways had to withdraw from the scheme in 2008, due to financial difficulties, and the role of project leaders was taken over by [[Stroud District Council]]. Following the reorganisation, the Stroud Valleys Canal Company was established<ref name=SN-heritage/> in March 2009. It is a limited company, with two independent directors and three directors representing Stroud District Council, the Proprietors, and the Cotswold Canals Trust. Its purpose is to hold the assets for the canals, and its charitable status means that [[Stamp duty in the United Kingdom|stamp duty land tax]] does not have to be paid.

In an unexpected turn of events, [[Highways England]] have agreed to partially fund this part of the work, which will involve two tunnels, a substantial cutting, and two new locks. Their contribution of \u00a34&nbsp;million will enable work such as tunnelling, which cannot be done by volunteers, to be brought forward, speeding up the whole project. The money comes from their Designated Funds Programme, designed to leave a positive legacy for future generations, and will fund some {{convert|90|acre|ha}} of wildlife habitats to increase bio-diversity, improvements to flood protection in the area, and routes for cycling and walking, in addition to the reinstatement of the canal channel.<ref>{{cite news |title=Government to fund Cotswold 'missing mile' |work=Waterways World |date=July 2019 |issn=0309-1422 |p=30}}</ref>\n\n==Links to other canals==\nThe canal had links to both the [[Thames and Severn Canal]] (at Wallbridge) and the [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]] (at [[Saul, Gloucestershire|Saul]]).\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{PoIgb start|type=collapsed}}\n{{PoIgb|Framilode Junction with River Severn|51.7925|-2.3616|SO751104|}}\n{{PoIgb|Jn with Gloucester and Sharpness Canal|51.7821|-2.3545|SO756093|}}\n{{PoIgb|A38 obstruction|51.7652|-2.3310|SO772074|}}\n{{PoIgb|M5 obstruction|51.7586|-2.3246|SO776067|}}\n{{PoIgb|Ocean railway culvert|51.7441|-2.2954|SO797050|}}\n{{PoIgb|A419 bridge, Dudbridge|51.7421|-2.2394|SO835048|}}\n{{PoIgb|Jn with Thames and Severn Canal|51.7440|-2.2273|SO844050|}}\n{{PoIgb end}}\n{{kml}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|Transport}}\n* [[Stroudwater barge]]\n*[[Canals of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[History of the British canal system]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite web\n  |url=https://cotswoldcanals.com/heritage-lottery-fund-award-explained/\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180908152202/https://cotswoldcanals.com/heritage-lottery-fund-award-explained/\n  |archive-date=8 September 2018 |url-status=live\n  |first=Clive |last=Field\n  |title=Heritage Lottery Fund Award explained\n  |publisher=Cotswold Canals Trust\n  |date=18 May 2018\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |first=Stuart |last=Fisher\n  |title=Cotswold Canals returning to life\n  |publisher=Waterways World\n  |date=August 2012\n  |issn=0309-1422\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |title=Severn Traders\n  |first=Colin |last=Green\n  |year=1999\n  |publisher=Black Dwarf Publications\n  |isbn=978-0-9533028-2-6\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |first=Charles |last=Hadfield\n  |title=The Canals of South and South East England\n  |year=1969\n  |publisher=David and Charles\n  |isbn=978-0-7153-4693-8\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book \n  |title='Stroud: Introduction' in A History of the County of Gloucestershire, Volume 11: Bisley and Longtree Hundreds pp99\u2013104\n  |editor1-first=N M |editor1-last=Herbert\n  |editor2-first=R B |editor2-last=Pugh\n  |publisher=University of London, [[Gloucestershire Victoria County History]]\n  |year=1976\n  |isbn=978-0-19-722745-9\n  |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/glos/vol11/pp99-104\n  |archive-url=\n  |archive-date=\n  |url-status=live\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |first=Hugh |last=McKnight\n  |title=The Shell book of Inland Waterways\n  |year=1981\n  |publisher=David and Charles\n  |isbn=978-0-7153-6884-8\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |url=http://www.jim-shead.com/waterways/sdoc.php?wpage=PNRC0621#PNRC606\n  |first=Joseph |last=Priestley\n  |title=Historical Account of the Navigable Rivers, Canals, and Railways, Throughout Great Britain\n  |publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green\n  |year=1831\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |first=Roger |last=Squires\n  |title=Britain's restored canals\n  |publisher=Landmark Publishing\n  |year=2008\n  |isbn=978-1-84306-331-5\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |url=http://www.gsia.org.uk/reprints/2012/gi201241.pdf\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031954/https://www.gsia.org.uk/reprints/2012/gi201241.pdf\n  |archive-date=1 December 2017 |url-status=live\n  |first=Theo |last=Stenning\n  |title=The restoration of the Cotswold Canals: August 2013 update\n  |publisher=Gloucestershire Society for Industrial Archaeology\n  |year=2013\n  |ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book\n  |first=Joan |last=Tucker\n  |title=The Stroudwater Navigation, a Social History\n  |publisher=Tempus\n  |year=2003\n  |isbn=978-0-7524-2806-2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|Stroudwater Navigation}}\n*[http://www.stroudwater.co.uk/cpsn/index.html The Company of Proprietors of the Stroudwater Navigation]\n*[http://www.cotswoldcanals.com/ Cotswold Canals Trust]\n*[http://www.cotswoldcanals.net/index.php Cotswold Canals in Pictures]\n*[http://canal.stroudvoices.co.uk  Stroud Voices (Stroudwater & Thames & Severn selection) - oral history site]\n*[http://canal.mister.red  List of YouTube videos of Stroudwater & Thames & Severn canals restoration]\n\n{{Canals of Britain}}\n\n[[Category:Stroud District]]\n[[Category:Canals in Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:Canals in England]]\n[[Category:Canals linked to the River Severn]]\n[[Category:Canals opened in 1779]]\n", "name_user": "Celuici", "label": "safe", "comment": "update lead image", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroudwater_Navigation"}

It was brought into existence as the navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and initially consisted of a few former [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] vessels surrendered at the conclusion of [[World War I]] and transferred to the new nation state in 1921 under the terms of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. The only modern sea-going warships transferred to the new state were twelve steam-powered [[torpedo boats]], although it did receive four capable [[river monitors]] for use on the [[Danube]] and other large rivers. Significant new acquisitions began in 1926 with a former German [[light cruiser]], followed by the commissioning of two [[motor torpedo boat]]s (MTBs) and a small submarine flotilla over the next few years. When the name of the state was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929, the name of its navy was changed to reflect this. In the late 1920s, several of the original vessels were discarded.\n\nThroughout the [[interwar period]], elements of the fleet conducted visits to ports throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], but few fleet exercises occurred due to budget pressures. In 1930, the Maritime Air Force was divorced from [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] control, and the naval air arm began to develop significantly, including the establishment of bases along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast. The following year, a British-made [[flotilla leader]] was commissioned with the idea that the KJRM might be able to operate in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] alongside the British and French navies. In the same year, five locally-built [[minelayer]]s were added to the fleet. A hiatus of several years followed, and it was not until 1936 that any further major acquisitions were made, with the purchase of eight German-built MTBs. Over the next two years, the fleet was significantly strengthened by the acquisition of three French-designed [[destroyer]]s, marking the high point of Yugoslav naval strength. On the eve of [[World War II]], the navy consisted of 611 officers and 8,562 men, operating 41 combatant ships and 19 auxiliaries.\n\nWhile the KJRM was largely captured by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian forces]] during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, a few of its vessels, aircraft and their crews escaped and served in the Mediterranean under [[Royal Navy]] control during the remainder of World War II. When the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|sued for peace]] in September 1943, most of the remaining vessels were taken over by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' or the [[Navy of the Independent State of Croatia]]. Towards the end of the war, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] transferred a [[corvette]] to Yugoslav control. At the end of the war, the few remaining vessels were transferred to the control of the new [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]]. As the post-war [[Yugoslav Navy]] drew its lineage from the naval forces of the wartime [[Yugoslav Partisans]] rather than the KJRM, few of the customs and traditions of the KJRM survived in the successor force.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nIn mid-to-late 1918, as [[World War I]] drew to a close, the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] began to break apart, and local committees began assuming responsibility for administration from the central government. In October 1918, the self-proclaimed [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs|National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] was established in [[Zagreb]], and later that month there were discussions between the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] and representatives of the National Council regarding the future of the Austro-Hungarian fleet. There was even an exchange of delegates between the National Council and the Austro-Hungarian naval staff in Vienna. By the end of that month, the \"sailor's councils\" that had been formed aboard Austro-Hungarian warships at the main base of [[Pula|Pola]] had decided that they would leave their ships by 1 November, regardless of the political discussions that were ongoing. On 30 October, the Austro-Hungarian naval staff directed its commanders to hand over all naval and riverine vessels to representatives of the National Council. The following day, the Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles]] ordered the handover of all naval vessels, establishments and fortresses to the National Council. By 4:30&nbsp;pm that day, the orders had been carried out. The National Council appointed Rear Admiral [[Dragutin Prica]] as the Navy Commissioner and Captain [[Janko Vukovi\u0107|Janko Vukovi\u0107 de Podkapelski]] as fleet commander.{{sfn|Vego|1982|pp=342\u2013343}}\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Italy|Italians]] were extremely uneasy about the rise of a new naval power in the [[Adriatic Sea]], and on the night of 31 October, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] personnel penetrated the base at Pola and set [[naval mine]]s under the keel of {{SMS|Viribus Unitis}}, the {{convert|20000|LT|ST|adj=on}} [[dreadnought]] [[battleship]] which was also Vukovi\u0107's [[flagship]]. When it exploded, the ship sank, with the loss of 400 crew, including Vukovi\u0107. As Prica was ill, the National Council appointed Captain Metodije Koch as Navy Commissioner and promoted him to rear admiral on 2 November. The [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] between the Allies, the United States and Austria-Hungary was signed on 3 November, and came into force the following day. Its naval provisions included a requirement that Austria-Hungary hand over the bulk of its naval vessels to Allied and United States control and disarm the remainder. Included in the handover were 42 modern warships and [[submarine]]s. Italy immediately began to occupy the former Austro-Hungarian coast and offshore islands, and demanded the handover of the vessels then under the control of the National Council. Koch requested authority to retain control over four [[destroyer]]s, but this was denied by the Allied Naval Council. Later that month, the Italians convinced the Allied Naval Council to force the remaining crews off most of the vessels.{{sfn|Vego|1982|pp=343\u2013344}}\n\nOn 1 December 1918, the new [[South Slavs|South Slav]] state, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS, later Kingdom of Yugoslavia) was created, joining the Kingdom of Serbia with those South Slav lands formerly part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Later that month, the Serbian Ministry of Army was dissolved, and a new [[Ministry of Defense (Yugoslavia)|Ministry of Army and Navy]] was created. By January 1919, there were a total of 35 former Austro-Hungarian vessels in port which had a total of 600 Yugoslav crew members aboard. The National Council dissolved the Navy Commissioner's office in February and Koch was appointed as the head of the Navy Department within the Ministry of Army and Navy. During that month, the Italians finally disembarked all remaining crew from former Austro-Hungarian vessels, leaving the nascent KSCS Navy without any ships. In April, Koch's office was moved to the capital, [[Belgrade]]. The final fate of the former Austro-Hungarian vessels was determined by the Allied powers during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], which also decided territorial disagreements between Italy and the KSCS. While the territorial questions in [[Dalmatia]] were largely decided in favour of the KSCS, Italy was more successful in denying the KSCS most of the former Austro-Hungarian fleet. The unrealistic demands of the KSCS in this regard contributed to their lack of success. For example, in April 1919, the KSCS asked for control over four [[cruiser]]s, 17 destroyers, 27 ocean-going [[torpedo boat]]s, and 20 submarines. Rebuffed, in May 1920 the KSCS reduced its claims to two ageing cruisers, six destroyers, 24 torpedo boats and four submarines. Even this more modest demand was rejected.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=344}}\n[[File:Austro-Hungarian torpedo boat flotilla.jpg|thumb|Eight 250t-class torpedo boats were transferred to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in March 1921|alt=a black and white photograph of several ships at a dock]]\nIn October 1920, the question was finally settled when the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] provided for the transfer of the obsolete [[coastal defence ship]] {{SMS|Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf}}, eight {{sclass2-|250t|torpedo boat|1}}s, four older {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|1}}s, the repair ship ''Cyclop'', the water carriers ''Najade'' and ''Nixe'', the salvage vessel ''Gigant'', three tugs, the yacht ''Dalmat'', four [[Hulk (ship type)|hulks]], four [[river monitor]]s ([[Yugoslav monitor Vardar|''Bosna'']], [[Yugoslav monitor Drava|''Enns'']], [[SMS K\u00f6r\u00f6s|''K\u00f6r\u00f6s'']] and [[Yugoslav monitor Sava|''Bodrog'']]), one motor launch, three river tugs, 16 small tenders, and a significant number of coal and oil [[Lighter (barge)|lighters]]. All of these vessels were formally taken over by the KSCS at the beginning of March 1921.{{sfn|Vego|1982|pp=344\u2013345}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=53\u201355, 58\u201363, 110, 117, 124, 130}} As the only modern sea-going vessels left to the KSCS were the 12 torpedo boats,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=355}} the new nation had to build its naval forces from scratch.{{sfn|Novak|2004|p=234}}\n\n===Establishment===\nMany former Austro-Hungarian naval personnel were incorporated into the new navy, 90 per cent of whom were of [[Croats|Croatian]] or [[Slovenes|Slovene]] ethnicity. The remainder were [[Serbs]], or non-Slavs such as [[Germans]]. Their former ranks were recognised and, initially at least, rank insignia and regulations were adopted from the former Austro-Hungarian Navy. By 1922, the KJRM consisted of 124 officers and about 3,000 men. The number of officers had more than halved since the end of 1919, largely due to disillusionment. To fill the looming shortfall, around 20 graduates from each of the 1921 and 1922 classes of the [[Military Academy (Serbia)|Yugoslav Military Academy]] in Belgrade were sent to the KJRM. In 1923, the new Naval Academy at [[Gru\u017e]] accepted its first class of 40 [[midshipman|midshipmen]], who were to undergo a three-year training course. All entrants to the Naval Academy had to be between 17 and 20 years of age, and graduates of high school or similar nautical school. Two specialist schools for [[petty officer]]s were established, one at [[\u0160ibenik]] for deck crew, and a machinist's school at [[Kumbor]] in the [[Bay of Kotor]]. Mine and [[torpedo]] training was conducted at [[\u0110enovi\u0107i]], as was pilot and air observer training. A gunnery school was established at [[Meljine]] in the Bay of Kotor. \u0160ibenik was also the home of the main coastal radio station, the [[Military communications|signals]] school and the basic and specialist training school for seamen.{{sfn|Vego|1982|pp=347\u2013348}}\n[[File:Yugoslav monitor Vardar.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The river monitor ''Vardar'' underway|alt=a black and white photograph of a boat on a river]]\nIn September 1923, new regulations were promulgated, dividing the navy into a fleet, a river flotilla, and naval aviation. Later that month a Naval Command was established, based in [[Zemun]], near Belgrade.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} The Navy Department, now known as Navy Section, was then only responsible for purely administrative matters, with Naval Command responsible for all operational questions.{{sfn|Vego|1982|pp=345\u2013346}} The service's initially unrealistic expansion goals of 24 destroyers and 24 submarines were soon shelved, and by the end of 1923 the fleet consisted of eight 250t-class torpedo boats, four ''Kaiman''-class torpedo boats, six {{sclass-|Galeb|minelayer|1}}s, four [[Schichau-class torpedo boat|''Schichau''-class minesweepers]], the water carrier ''Perun'' (ex-''Cyclop''), the yachts ''Vila'' (ex-''Dalmat'') and ''Lada'' (ex-''Quarnero''), the training ship ''Vila Velebit'', the salvage vessel ''Mo\u0107ni'' (ex-''Gigant''), and four tugs. ''Kumbor'' (ex-''Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf'') had been sold for scrap in 1922, and three of the minesweepers were disposed of in 1924, as were the four hulks. The four river monitors remained in service, as ''Vardar'', ''Drava'', ''Morava'' and ''Sava'' respectively. They were supported by two motor patrol boats and three river tugs.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=347}}\n\nThe shore establishments were developed from those inherited from the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and included [[Tivat]] in the Bay of Kotor. It was home to the Tivat Arsenal, a naval yard which was expanded to repair and overhaul larger vessels; it included two floating docks, one of {{convert|2000|LT|ST|adj=on|abbr=on}} and one of {{convert|7000|LT|ST|adj=on|abbr=on}} capacity. The apprentice school and diving school were also established there, along with the main supply base. A {{convert|2000|LT|ST|adj=on|abbr=on}} capacity floating dock was acquired for the private [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow Adriatic]] [[Kraljevica Shipyard|shipyard]] at [[Kraljevica]], and a subsidiary of the French [[Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire]] shipyard was established at [[Split, Croatia|Split]], equipped with two more floating docks, one of {{convert|1800|LT|ST|adj=on|abbr=on}}, and one of {{convert|8000|LT|ST|adj=on|abbr=on}} capacity. The riverine vessels were usually repaired at the [[Novi Sad]] subsidiary of the Arsenal, and overhauls were completed at [[\u017delezara Smederevo|Sartid Works]] in [[Smederevo]].{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=348}}\n\n===Interwar activities===\n====1923\u20131929====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-185-0116-27A, Bucht von Kotor (-), jugoslawische Schiffe.jpg|thumb|The first major acquisition of the navy was the light cruiser ''Dalmacija'' (right)|alt=a black and white photograph of a ship at dock]]\nThe early development of the navy was hampered by severe budget limitations and a lack of interest from the general staff which consisted of former [[Royal Serbian Army]] generals with little appreciation for naval matters. A Navy League ({{lang-sh|Jadranska Stra\u017ea}}) was established to promote public interest in the navy.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=349}} In 1925, Prica conducted exercises off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of vessels.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In 1926, the navy was able to make its first significant acquisition, the former [[Imperial German Navy]] [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Niobe}}, which was renamed ''Dalmacija''. She was refitted at the Tivat Arsenal prior to commissioning. The following year, two British-built [[John I. Thornycroft & Company|Thornycroft]] [[Uskok-class torpedo boat|''Uskok''-class]] [[motor torpedo boat]]s (MTBs) were acquired, named ''Uskok'' and ''\u010cetnik'', and a base was built for them at \u0160ibenik. In 1927, the first two submarines were purchased, the British-built [[Hrabri-class submarine|''Hrabri'' class]]\u2014[[Yugoslav submarine Hrabri|''Hrabri'']] and [[Yugoslav submarine Neboj\u0161a|''Neboj\u0161a'']]. Over the next two years, two further submarines were brought into service, the French-built [[Osvetnik-class submarine|''Osvetnik'' class]], which consisted of [[Yugoslav submarine Osvetnik|''Osvetnik'']] and [[Yugoslav submarine Smeli|''Smeli'']]. The submarine flotilla was based at Tivat, supported by the depot ship ''Hvar'' (ex-''Solun''), acquired in 1927. Between 1928 and 1930, a number of former Austro-Hungarian vessels were discarded, including the four ''Kaiman''-class torpedo boats. In 1929, the salvage ship ''Mo\u0107ni'' was scrapped, and the German-built {{convert|740|LT|ST|adj=on|abbr=on}} ''Spasilac'' was acquired to replace her.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=349}}\n\nIn late 1928, the naval aviation school was transferred from \u0110enovi\u0107i to Divulje near Split, where a new seaplane station was established. In the same year, the {{convert|1870|LT|ST|adj=on|abbr=on}} seaplane depot ship [[Yugoslav minelayer Zmaj|''Zmaj'']] was acquired from Germany.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=350}} In May and June 1929, a squadron, under the command of Prica and consisting of ''Dalmacija'', ''Hvar'' and the two ''Hrabri''-class submarines, visited [[Malta]], [[Corfu]] and [[Bizerte]]. Also in 1929, the former Austro-Hungarian water carrier ''Najade'', now named ''Sitnica'', was re-employed as an auxiliary for the submarine flotilla, despite its lack of a workshop for repair work.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In late 1929, Navy Command and Navy Section were combined as part of the Ministry of Army and Navy, with the navy commander holding the rank of admiral, and his deputy with the rank of vice-admiral. By that time, the Yugoslav fleet consisted of the light cruiser ''Dalmacija'', the eight 250t-class seagoing torpedo boats, the two ''Uskok''-class MTBs, four submarines, six ''Galeb''-class minetenders, one minesweeper, the submarine depot ship ''Hvar'', the training ship ''Sitnica'', two yachts ''Vila'' and ''Lada'', and five tugs. The riverine flotilla consisted of the four monitors and the river auxiliary ''Srbija''. In total, the navy comprised 256 officers and 2,000 men, with a naval reserve consisting of 164 officers and 570 men. Less than half of the officers were former members of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and 49 officers had graduated from the Naval Academy.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=350}} In October, Prica retired as navy commander and was replaced by Vice-Admiral V.

In April 1930, the salvage vessel ''Spasilac'' was added to the fleet, and the following month the submarine ''Neboj\u0161a'' was damaged when she collided with a steamer. In July, the two ''Hrabri''-class submarines and ''Sitnica'' made a [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] cruise, visiting [[Alexandria]] and [[Beirut]]. The appointment of a chief of the Maritime Air Force in 1930 signified the separation of naval aviation from army control, with a strength of around 1,000 officers and men, of whom about 80 were pilots. Around 120 naval aircraft were in service.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=247}} In 1931, the fleet expanded significantly with the completion of the British-built [[flotilla leader]] [[Yugoslav destroyer Dubrovnik|''Dubrovnik'']].{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=350}} The [[flotilla leader]] concept involved building large [[destroyer]]s similar to the World War I [[Royal Navy]] [[V and W-class destroyer]]s.{{sfn|Freivogel|2014|p=83}} In the [[interwar period|interwar]] [[French Navy]], these ships were known as ''contre-torpilleurs'', and were intended to operate with smaller destroyers, or as half-flotillas of three ships. The KJRM decided to build three such flotilla leaders, ships that would have the ability to reach high speeds and with a long endurance. The long endurance requirement reflected Yugoslav plans to deploy the ships into the central [[Mediterranean]], where they would be able to operate alongside French and British warships. The onset of the [[Great Depression]] meant that only one ship of the planned half-flotilla was ever built.{{sfn|Freivogel|2014|p=84}} Five locally-built [[Malinska-class mining tender|''Malinska''-class minelayers]] were also added to the fleet in 1931. The following year, a new German-built {{convert|720|LT|ST|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[brigantine]] sail training ship, [[Jadran (ship)|''Jadran'']] was acquired,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=350}} and Wickerhauser retired and was replaced by Vice-Admiral N.N. Stankovi\u0107.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=393}} The 250t-class torpedo boat ''T4'' ran aground and was broken up in 1932.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}}\n\nIn 1932, Stankovi\u0107 assured the British naval attach\u00e9 that Yugoslav naval policy was focused on the defence of her coastline, but he also opined that this task would require significant expansion of the navy, including the acquisition of six cruisers and five more flotilla leaders similar to ''Dubrovnik''. In the same year, ''Dubrovnik'' sailed to the [[Black Sea]] then visited several ports in the Mediterranean with King Alexander and [[Maria of Yugoslavia|Queen Marie]] aboard. During 1932, the Maritime Air Force had bases at Divulje and \u0110enovi\u0107i, with two bomber squadrons and one reconnaissance squadron at each base, each squadron consisting of 12 aircraft.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=453\u2013454}} In 1934, the British naval attach\u00e9 reported that the French had significant influence on Yugoslav naval policy. In the same year, the KJRM comprised 517 officers and 6,461 men, and Stankovi\u0107 retired and was replaced by Rear-Admiral M.&nbsp;L. Poli\u0107.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=541\u2013542}} In October, ''Hrabri'' and ''Smeli'' conducted visits to various Mediterranean ports.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=544}} Despite the fact that a half-flotilla of large destroyers was not going to be built, the idea that ''Dubrovnik'' might operate with a number of smaller destroyers persisted. In 1934, the KJRM decided to acquire three such destroyers to operate in a [[division (naval)|division]] led by ''Dubrovnik''.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=543}} In August 1935, ''Dubrovnik'' visited Corfu and Bizerte, the seaplane carrier ''Zmaj'' along with three ''Galeb''-class mine tenders also visited Corfu, and ''Hrabri'' and ''Osvetnik'' visited Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=641}}\n\nIn 1936, eight German-built [[Orjen-class torpedo boat|''Orjen''-class MTBs]] were added.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=350}} Also in 1936, a new naval coastal command was established under the command of a rear admiral. It was headquartered in Split, and included shore-based commands at [[Selce, Croatia|Selce]], \u0160ibenik and \u0110enovi\u0107i. By the end of that year, the KJRM consisted of 27 surface combatants, four submarines, and around a dozen auxiliary vessels, crewed by a total of 487 officers and about 5,000 men. The yacht ''Lada'' had been disposed of, as had the minesweeper ''D2''.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The naval historian Milan Vego provides conflicting information regarding the fate of minesweeper ''D2''. He states that it was disposed of by 1936,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=350}} but also lists it as part of the fleet in 1941.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=356}} Leo Niehorster lists ''D2'' as still in service in 1941, but notes it was being used as a training ship.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}}}} The training ship ''Sitnica'' had been converted into a second submarine depot ship, and the ''Galeb''-class mine tenders had been reclassified as minelayers. The river flotilla consisted of the four monitors, the royal yacht ''Dragor'', two patrol boats\u2014''Grani\u010dar'' and ''Stra\u017ear'', and three river tugs; ''Cer'', ''Triglav'' and ''Avala''. However, in 1936 the only vessels ready for war service were ''Dubrovnik'' and the four submarines, and the navy was only considered capable of patrol duties and coastal surveillance, minelaying and minor raids against enemy shipping. Despite this, the United States naval attach\u00e9 observed that the morale and discipline of the navy was very good. He further stated that higher-level commanders appeared discouraged at the poor position of the navy due to its inadequate budget. He concluded that the fleet was in very good condition considering its funding.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=350}} During 1936, ''Neboj\u0161a'' and ''Osvetnik'' visited Corfu, and ''Zmaj'' and three ''Galeb''-class mine tenders also visited Corfu.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=738}}\n[[File:Torpedo boat velebit in 1939.jpg|thumb|The ''Orjen''-class MTB ''Velebit'' underway|250px|alt=a black and white photograph of a ship underway]]\nIn 1936\u20131937, the fleet was significantly strengthened by the acquisition of three {{convert|1240|LT|ST|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[Beograd-class destroyer|''Beograd''-class destroyer]]s, the French-built [[Yugoslav destroyer Beograd|''Beograd'']], and the locally-built [[Yugoslav destroyer Zagreb|''Zagreb'']] and [[Yugoslav destroyer Ljubljana|''Ljubljana'']]. Naval communication via [[Teleprinter|teletype]] was established to connect Naval Command in Zemun with bases at Selce, Split, \u0160ibenik and Novi Sad. Split was also connected to Divulje, and \u0110enovi\u0107i was connected with the Tivat Arsenal.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=350}} In 1937, the Naval Command was renamed the Naval Staff, and a Naval Staff College was established at Dubrovnik. Considerable effort was made to bring the fleet to sound seagoing condition, with a refit of ''Dalmacija''. ''Dubrovnik'' was considered to be in good repair, but the two French-built submarines needed constant work. The eight new ''Orjen''-class MTBs were found to be unseaworthy in rough conditions, but satisfactory in fair weather. ''Dubrovnik'' visited [[Istanbul]], [[Moudros|Mudros]] and [[Piraeus]] in August, and ''Zmaj'', ''Hrabri'' and ''Smeli'' visited [[Crete]], Piraeus and Corfu in August and September.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=835\u2013837}}\n\nIn 1938, the navy consisted of 611 officers and 8,562 men. A Balkan Naval Conference was conducted in the same year, during which the Chief of the Naval Staff declared that in case of war, the Yugoslav fleet would concentrate on coastal defence, except for occasional submarine forays. The Maritime Air Force could field a total of 40 aircraft, but only the 12 [[Dornier Do 22]]s and 12 [[Dornier Do J]]s were considered to be of any value in modern warfare. ''Dubrovnik'' visited Alexandria, Beirut and Corfu in August 1938.{{sfn|Jarman|1997c|pp=92\u201394}} In 1939, a new {{convert|2400|LT|ST|abbr=on|adj=on}} destroyer [[Yugoslav destroyer Split|''Split'']] was laid down, and two coastal [[German Type II submarine|German Type IIB submarines]] were ordered, but due to the outbreak of [[World War II]], ''Split'' was not completed and the submarines were never delivered.{{sfn|Vego|1982|pp=350\u2013352}} In 1939, the British observed that the commander-in-chief of the Yugoslav Navy, Poli\u0107, was \"amiable but ignorant\" and had little technical knowledge regarding naval matters.{{sfn|Jarman|1997c|p=121}} In the same year, the 250t-class torpedo boat ''T2'' was broken up for scrap.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} In January 1940, ''Ljubljana'' struck a reef off \u0160ibenik and sank. She was raised and placed in dry dock at the Tivat Arsenal for repairs.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=352}}\n\n===Prior to the April 1941 invasion===\n{{See also|Yugoslav order of battle prior to the invasion of Yugoslavia}}\n[[File:Malinska.jpg|thumb|A ''Malinska''-class minelayer underway|alt=a black and white photograph of a small ship]]\nOn the eve of the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], the KJRM comprised 41 combatant ships and 19 auxiliaries, effectively divided into ships capable of offensive and defensive tasks, and ships intended for peacetime training, logistics and minelaying tasks. The former category included ''Dubrovnik'', the three ''Beograd''-class destroyers (although ''Ljubljana'' was in dry dock being repaired), the four submarines, eight ''Orjen''-class MTBs and two ''Uskok''-class MTBs. Of the submarines, only the two French-built ones were considered fully combat-ready. The latter category consisted of ''Dalmacija'', six ''Galeb''-class minelayers, six 250t-class torpedo boats, five ''Malinska''-class minelayers, and the training and auxiliary ships ''Jadran'', ''Zmaj'', ''Hvar'' and ''Sitnica''. The Maritime Air Force consisted of 150 seaplanes, of which 120 were combat-capable, the remainder being training aircraft. The combat aircraft were mainly Do 22s, Do Js and [[Dornier Komet|Do D]] types. Although torpedo-capable aircraft were in service, no air-launched torpedoes were available.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=354}}\n\nThere were significant weaknesses in the KJRM prior to the invasion. One was the failure to subordinate the Naval Surveillance Command to respective sectors of Naval Coastal Command, and another was giving responsibility for two sectors of Naval Coastal Command to what were essentially training establishments.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=360}}\n\n===Naval operations during the invasion of 1941===\nWhen Germany and Italy attacked Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941, the initial attacks came from the air. From early morning, Italian and German aircraft attacked the naval facilities at Split and the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=205}} In the afternoon, Italian dive bombers attacked the Bay of Kotor. Their attack damaged a Do J flying boat, but one of the Italian aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire, while another two were damaged. Shortly after this more Italian bombers unsuccessfully attacked the Tivat Arsenal, suffering three aircraft damaged in the attack. On the same day, three KJRM Dornier Do 22s and Rogo\u017earski SIM-XIV-Hs provided air cover while the ''Galeb''-class minelayer ''Jastreb'' laid a minefield off [[Budva]] harbour.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=207}} The following day, three Italian bombers became lost in cloud and emerged over the Bay of Kotor where two were damaged and one shot down by anti-aircraft fire.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=213}} On 8 April, there were Italian attacks on the base of the 2nd and 3rd Torpedo Divisions in \u0160ibenik, and three Do J flying boats were destroyed by Italian fighters at [[Jadrtovac]]. A number of Do 22s and SIM-XIV-Hs also flew reconnaissance missions on that day.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=216}} The next day, Italian bombers struck a number of Yugoslav naval and seaplane bases along the coast, destroying and damaging several aircraft. One Do 22 pilot located an Italian convoy crossing the Adriatic and despite heavy anti-aircraft fire attacked it twice without result. Another three KJRM Do 22s raided [[Durr\u00ebs|Durazzo]] in Italian-controlled Albania, but were driven off.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=218}}\n\nTo prevent a bridgehead being established at [[Zadar|Zara]], an Italian enclave on the Dalmatian coast, ''Beograd'', four 250t-class torpedo boats and six MTBs were dispatched to \u0160ibenik, {{convert|80|km}} to the south of Zara, in preparation for an attack. The attack was to be coordinated with the [[12th Infantry Division Jadranska|12th Infantry Division ''Jadranska'']] and two combined regiments ({{lang-sh-Latn|odredi|links=no}}) of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] attacking from the [[Benkovac]] area, supported by the [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]]'s 81st Bomber Group. The Yugoslavs launched their attack on 9 April, but the naval prong of this attack faltered when ''Beograd'' was damaged by near misses from Italian aircraft off \u0160ibenik when her starboard engine was put out of action, after which she limped to the Bay of Kotor, escorted by the remainder of the force, for repairs.{{sfn|Whitely|2001|p=312}} The Italian aerial bombardment of Kotor badly damaged the minelayer ''Kobac'', which had to be beached to prevent its sinking.{{sfn|Cernuschi|2013|p=}}\n\nOn 10 April, the 2nd Hydroplane Command at Divulje began to disintegrate, with some pilots flying their aircraft to the Bay of Kotor to join the 3rd Hydroplane Command. One Do 22 attacked an Italian tanker off [[Bari]], claiming a near miss that the Yugoslav crew believed to have caused some damage.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=220}} The following day, Italian dive bombers attacked MTBs of the 2nd Torpedo Division near \u0160ibenik, with the Yugoslav boats shooting down one Italian aircraft and damaging another.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=222}}\n\nAt the start of the campaign, the river monitors had carried out offensive operations by shelling the airfield at [[Moh\u00e1cs]] in [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] on 6 April and again two days later, but had to begin withdrawing towards Novi Sad by 11 April after coming under repeated attack by German dive bombers. Early in the morning of 12 April, a squadron of German dive bombers attacked the Yugoslav monitors on the Danube. ''Drava'' was hit by several of them but they were unable to penetrate her {{convert|300|mm|adj=on}} thick deck armour, until by chance, one put a bomb straight down the funnel, killing 54 of the 67 crew. During the attack, the monitors' anti-aircraft gunners claimed three dive bombers shot down. The remaining three monitors were scuttled by their crews later on 12 April as German and Hungarian forces had occupied their bases and the river systems upon which they operated.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=222 & 224}} The crews then gathered on a tugboat and attempted to flee to the Black Sea. While the boat was passing under a bridge near Zemun, it was attacked by Axis aircraft. Several bombs struck the bridge, causing it to collapse on the tug, and killing all but three of the crew.{{sfn|Adamich|1963|p=140}}\n\n===Aftermath===\n[[File:Yugoslav corvette Nada.jpg|thumb|left|Renaming ceremony for the corvette ''Nada'' at Liverpool on 11 January 1944|alt=a black and white photograph of the main gun of ship with a group of men around it]]\nThe Italians captured most of the KJRM in port, including ''Ljubljana'', which had spent the duration of the invasion in dry-dock.{{sfn|Whitely|2001|p=312}} However, ''Zagreb'' was blown up and scuttled at the Bay of Kotor by two junior officers, [[Sergej Ma\u0161era]] and [[Milan Spasi\u0107]], to prevent her capture. The submarine ''Neboj\u0161a'' and two ''Orjen''-class MTBs escaped to Alexandria to join the Allied cause.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} A fourth destroyer, ''Split'', was captured while under construction in the Kotor shipyard, but the Italians were not able to complete her before [[Armistice of Cassibile|they sued for peace]] in September 1943. She was completed by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war.{{sfn|Whitely|2001|p=313}} Ten Maritime Air Force aircraft escaped to Greece, with nine eventually making it to Egypt, where they formed a squadron under [[Royal Air Force]] command.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=229}} The three Yugoslav ships that escaped capture were used to create a KJRM-in-exile. The force was led by Captain I. Kern, who was attached to the [[Yugoslav government-in-exile]] in London, and operated with the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]] from bases in Malta and Alexandria.{{sfn|Adamich|1963|pp=140\u2013141}}\n\nA number of the captured Yugoslav warships, notably ''Dubrovnik'', ''Beograd'' and the repaired ''Ljubljana'', were employed by the Italian ''Regia Marina'' until the armistice in 1943, whereupon the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'', and to a lesser extent the [[Navy of the Independent State of Croatia]], appropriated the surviving vessels for their own fleets. ''Ljubljana'' was wrecked on a shoal near the [[Gulf of Tunis]] whilst in Italian service in April 1943, and ''Dalmacija'' entered German service with her previous German name ''Niobe'', but was soon transferred to the Croatian navy as ''Zniam''. Beached on [[Silba]] island, she was destroyed by British MTBs in December 1943. ''Dubrovnik'' and ''Beograd'' were not sunk by Allied forces until April and May 1945 respectively.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|pp=357\u2013358}}\n\nIn early 1944, the Royal Navy [[Flower-class corvette|''Flower''-class corvette]] [[HMS Mallow (K81)|''Mallow'']] was transferred to the KJRM-in-exile as ''Nada''.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|pp=358\u2013359}} In August 1945, following the end of World War II in Europe, the British government ordered the navy to disband. Its assets were transferred to the newly constituted post-war Yugoslav Navy,{{sfn|Adamich|1963|p=141}} where they continued their service. The post-war Yugoslav Navy drew its insignia and traditions from the Partisan naval forces that evolved from armed fishing vessels operated along the Adriatic coast from late 1942, so few of the traditions of the KJRM were carried over to the post-war navy.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=356}} The British government gave the personnel of the KJRM-in-exile the choice of being repatriated or remaining in exile. Of these, 93 men chose to stay abroad. The British government briefly housed them in military camps before allowing them to move to countries of their choosing.{{sfn|Adamich|1963|p=141}}\n\n==Organisation==\n===Peacetime===\nThe peacetime organisation of the KJRM remained essentially unchanged from 1929 until the invasion of Yugoslavia. The Naval Command in Zemun formed part of the Ministry of Army and Navy, and controlled Navy Headquarters. Navy Headquarters consisted of the staff, archives, main naval radio station and the navy newspaper, and controlled six branches; the fleet, River and Lake Forces, Maritime Air Force, Coastal Defence Command, Naval Surveillance Command, and shore establishments. The exact composition of the fleet varied considerably as vessels were added and disposed of, but from 1938 it usually comprised three torpedo divisions, a submarine division and a training squadron, reaching its maximum strength during the summer training period each year. The minelayers were usually part of the Coastal Defence Command, but were detached to the fleet during naval exercises, as were naval aviation squadrons. The Maritime Air Force consisted of three seaplane commands each of two groups, the naval aviation school and the seaplane depot ship ''Zmaj''.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=352}}\n\n===Wartime===\nIn case of war or national emergency, the Naval Staff was to become directly subordinate to the [[Supreme Command (Kingdom of Yugoslavia)|Supreme Command]]. The Naval Staff would command the fleet, river flotilla, Maritime Air Force and Naval Coastal Command. All other naval establishments would remain under the control of the Navy Section of the Ministry of Army and Navy. There were a few exceptions to these general arrangements. For example, the naval detachments on [[Lake Ohrid]] and [[Lake Skadar|Lake Scutari]] were subordinated to the local army districts, and the Naval Coastal Command was subordinated to the Royal Yugoslav Army's Coastal Defence Command.

It was brought into existence as the navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and initially consisted of a few former [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] vessels surrendered at the conclusion of [[World War I]] and transferred to the new nation state in 1921 under the terms of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. The only modern sea-going warships transferred to the new state were twelve steam-powered [[torpedo boats]], although it did receive four capable [[river monitors]] for use on the [[Danube]] and other large rivers. Significant new acquisitions began in 1926 with a former German [[light cruiser]], followed by the commissioning of two [[motor torpedo boat]]s (MTBs) and a small submarine flotilla over the next few years. When the name of the state was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929, the name of its navy was changed to reflect this. In the late 1920s, several of the original vessels were discarded.\n\nThroughout the [[interwar period]], elements of the fleet conducted visits to ports throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], but few fleet exercises occurred due to budget pressures. In 1930, the Maritime Air Force was divorced from [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] control, and the naval air arm began to develop significantly, including the establishment of bases along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast. The following year, a British-made [[flotilla leader]] was commissioned with the idea that the KJRM might be able to operate in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] alongside the British and French navies. In the same year, five locally-built [[minelayer]]s were added to the fleet. A hiatus of several years followed, and it was not until 1936 that any further major acquisitions were made, with the purchase of eight German-built MTBs. Over the next two years, the fleet was significantly strengthened by the acquisition of three French-designed [[destroyer]]s, marking the high point of Yugoslav naval strength. On the eve of [[World War II]], the navy consisted of 611 officers and 8,562 men, operating 41 combatant ships and 19 auxiliaries.\n\nWhile the KJRM was largely captured by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian forces]] during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, a few of its vessels, aircraft and their crews escaped and served in the Mediterranean under [[Royal Navy]] control during the remainder of World War II. When the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|sued for peace]] in September 1943, most of the remaining vessels were taken over by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' or the [[Navy of the Independent State of Croatia]]. Towards the end of the war, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] transferred a [[corvette]] to Yugoslav control. At the end of the war, the few remaining vessels were transferred to the control of the new [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]]. As the post-war [[Yugoslav Navy]] drew its lineage from the naval forces of the wartime [[Yugoslav Partisans]] rather than the KJRM, few of the customs and traditions of the KJRM survived in the successor force.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nIn mid-to-late 1918, as [[World War I]] drew to a close, the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] began to break apart, and local committees began assuming responsibility for administration from the central government. In October 1918, the self-proclaimed [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs|National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] was established in [[Zagreb]], and later that month there were discussions between the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] and representatives of the National Council regarding the future of the Austro-Hungarian fleet. There was even an exchange of delegates between the National Council and the Austro-Hungarian naval staff in Vienna. By the end of that month, the \"sailor's councils\" that had been formed aboard Austro-Hungarian warships at the main base of [[Pula|Pola]] had decided that they would leave their ships by 1 November, regardless of the political discussions that were ongoing. On 30 October, the Austro-Hungarian naval staff directed its commanders to hand over all naval and riverine vessels to representatives of the National Council. The following day, the Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles]] ordered the handover of all naval vessels, establishments and fortresses to the National Council. By 4:30&nbsp;pm that day, the orders had been carried out. The National Council appointed Rear Admiral [[Dragutin Prica]] as the Navy Commissioner and Captain [[Janko Vukovi\u0107|Janko Vukovi\u0107 de Podkapelski]] as fleet commander.{{sfn|Vego|1982|pp=342\u2013343}}\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Italy|Italians]] were extremely uneasy about the rise of a new naval power in the [[Adriatic Sea]], and on the night of 31 October, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] personnel penetrated the base at Pola and set [[naval mine]]s under the keel of {{SMS|Viribus Unitis}}, the {{convert|20000|LT|ST|adj=on}} [[dreadnought]] [[battleship]] which was also Vukovi\u0107's [[flagship]]. When it exploded, the ship sank, with the loss of 400 crew, including Vukovi\u0107. As Prica was ill, the National Council appointed Captain Metodije Koch as Navy Commissioner and promoted him to rear admiral on 2 November. The [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] between the Allies, the United States and Austria-Hungary was signed on 3 November, and came into force the following day. Its naval provisions included a requirement that Austria-Hungary hand over the bulk of its naval vessels to Allied and United States control and disarm the remainder. Included in the handover were 42 modern warships and [[submarine]]s. Italy immediately began to occupy the former Austro-Hungarian coast and offshore islands, and demanded the handover of the vessels then under the control of the National Council. Koch requested authority to retain control over four [[destroyer]]s, but this was denied by the Allied Naval Council. Later that month, the Italians convinced the Allied Naval Council to force the remaining crews off most of the vessels.{{sfn|Vego|1982|pp=343\u2013344}}\n\nOn 1 December 1918, the new [[South Slavs|South Slav]] state, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS, later Kingdom of Yugoslavia) was created, joining the Kingdom of Serbia with those South Slav lands formerly part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Later that month, the Serbian Ministry of Army was dissolved, and a new [[Ministry of Defense (Yugoslavia)|Ministry of Army and Navy]] was created. By January 1919, there were a total of 35 former Austro-Hungarian vessels in port which had a total of 600 Yugoslav crew members aboard. The National Council dissolved the Navy Commissioner's office in February and Koch was appointed as the head of the Navy Department within the Ministry of Army and Navy. During that month, the Italians finally disembarked all remaining crew from former Austro-Hungarian vessels, leaving the nascent KSCS Navy without any ships. In April, Koch's office was moved to the capital, [[Belgrade]]. The final fate of the former Austro-Hungarian vessels was determined by the Allied powers during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], which also decided territorial disagreements between Italy and the KSCS. While the territorial questions in [[Dalmatia]] were largely decided in favour of the KSCS, Italy was more successful in denying the KSCS most of the former Austro-Hungarian fleet. The unrealistic demands of the KSCS in this regard contributed to their lack of success. For example, in April 1919, the KSCS asked for control over four [[cruiser]]s, 17 destroyers, 27 ocean-going [[torpedo boat]]s, and 20 submarines. Rebuffed, in May 1920 the KSCS reduced its claims to two ageing cruisers, six destroyers, 24 torpedo boats and four submarines. Even this more modest demand was rejected.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=344}}\n[[File:Austro-Hungarian torpedo boat flotilla.jpg|thumb|Eight 250t-class torpedo boats were transferred to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in March 1921|alt=a black and white photograph of several ships at a dock]]\nIn October 1920, the question was finally settled when the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] provided for the transfer of the obsolete [[coastal defence ship]] {{SMS|Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf}}, eight {{sclass2-|250t|torpedo boat|1}}s, four older {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|1}}s, the repair ship ''Cyclop'', the water carriers ''Najade'' and ''Nixe'', the salvage vessel ''Gigant'', three tugs, the yacht ''Dalmat'', four [[Hulk (ship type)|hulks]], four [[river monitor]]s ([[Yugoslav monitor Vardar|''Bosna'']], [[Yugoslav monitor Drava|''Enns'']], [[SMS K\u00f6r\u00f6s|''K\u00f6r\u00f6s'']] and [[Yugoslav monitor Sava|''Bodrog'']]), one motor launch, three river tugs, 16 small tenders, and a significant number of coal and oil [[Lighter (barge)|lighters]]. All of these vessels were formally taken over by the KSCS at the beginning of March 1921.{{sfn|Vego|1982|pp=344\u2013345}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=53\u201355, 58\u201363, 110, 117, 124, 130}} As the only modern sea-going vessels left to the KSCS were the 12 torpedo boats,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=355}} the new nation had to build its naval forces from scratch.{{sfn|Novak|2004|p=234}}\n\n===Establishment===\nMany former Austro-Hungarian naval personnel were incorporated into the new navy, 90 per cent of whom were of [[Croats|Croatian]] or [[Slovenes|Slovene]] ethnicity. The remainder were [[Serbs]], or non-Slavs such as [[Germans]]. Their former ranks were recognised and, initially at least, rank insignia and regulations were adopted from the former Austro-Hungarian Navy. By 1922, the KJRM consisted of 124 officers and about 3,000 men. The number of officers had more than halved since the end of 1919, largely due to disillusionment. To fill the looming shortfall, around 20 graduates from each of the 1921 and 1922 classes of the [[Military Academy (Serbia)|Yugoslav Military Academy]] in Belgrade were sent to the KJRM. In 1923, the new Naval Academy at [[Gru\u017e]] accepted its first class of 40 [[midshipman|midshipmen]], who were to undergo a three-year training course. All entrants to the Naval Academy had to be between 17 and 20 years of age, and graduates of high school or similar nautical school. Two specialist schools for [[petty officer]]s were established, one at [[\u0160ibenik]] for deck crew, and a machinist's school at [[Kumbor]] in the [[Bay of Kotor]]. Mine and [[torpedo]] training was conducted at [[\u0110enovi\u0107i]], as was pilot and air observer training. A gunnery school was established at [[Meljine]] in the Bay of Kotor. \u0160ibenik was also the home of the main coastal radio station, the [[Military communications|signals]] school and the basic and specialist training school for seamen.{{sfn|Vego|1982|pp=347\u2013348}}\n[[File:Yugoslav monitor Vardar.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The river monitor ''Vardar'' underway|alt=a black and white photograph of a boat on a river]]\nIn September 1923, new regulations were promulgated, dividing the navy into a fleet, a river flotilla, and naval aviation. Later that month a Naval Command was established, based in [[Zemun]], near Belgrade.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} The Navy Department, now known as Navy Section, was then only responsible for purely administrative matters, with Naval Command responsible for all operational questions.{{sfn|Vego|1982|pp=345\u2013346}} The service's initially unrealistic expansion goals of 24 destroyers and 24 submarines were soon shelved, and by the end of 1923 the fleet consisted of eight 250t-class torpedo boats, four ''Kaiman''-class torpedo boats, six {{sclass-|Galeb|minelayer|1}}s, four [[Schichau-class torpedo boat|''Schichau''-class minesweepers]], the water carrier ''Perun'' (ex-''Cyclop''), the yachts ''Vila'' (ex-''Dalmat'') and ''Lada'' (ex-''Quarnero''), the training ship ''Vila Velebit'', the salvage vessel ''Mo\u0107ni'' (ex-''Gigant''), and four tugs. ''Kumbor'' (ex-''Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf'') had been sold for scrap in 1922, and three of the minesweepers were disposed of in 1924, as were the four hulks. The four river monitors remained in service, as ''Vardar'', ''Drava'', ''Morava'' and ''Sava'' respectively. They were supported by two motor patrol boats and three river tugs.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=347}}\n\nThe shore establishments were developed from those inherited from the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and included [[Tivat]] in the Bay of Kotor. It was home to the Tivat Arsenal, a naval yard which was expanded to repair and overhaul larger vessels; it included two floating docks, one of {{convert|2000|LT|ST|adj=on|abbr=on}} and one of {{convert|7000|LT|ST|adj=on|abbr=on}} capacity. The apprentice school and diving school were also established there, along with the main supply base. A {{convert|2000|LT|ST|adj=on|abbr=on}} capacity floating dock was acquired for the private [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow Adriatic]] [[Kraljevica Shipyard|shipyard]] at [[Kraljevica]], and a subsidiary of the French [[Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire]] shipyard was established at [[Split, Croatia|Split]], equipped with two more floating docks, one of {{convert|1800|LT|ST|adj=on|abbr=on}}, and one of {{convert|8000|LT|ST|adj=on|abbr=on}} capacity. The riverine vessels were usually repaired at the [[Novi Sad]] subsidiary of the Arsenal, and overhauls were completed at [[\u017delezara Smederevo|Sartid Works]] in [[Smederevo]].{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=348}}\n\n===Interwar activities===\n====1923\u20131929====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-185-0116-27A, Bucht von Kotor (-), jugoslawische Schiffe.jpg|thumb|The first major acquisition of the navy was the light cruiser ''Dalmacija'' (right)|alt=a black and white photograph of a ship at dock]]\nThe early development of the navy was hampered by severe budget limitations and a lack of interest from the general staff which consisted of former [[Royal Serbian Army]] generals with little appreciation for naval matters. A Navy League ({{lang-sh|Jadranska Stra\u017ea}}) was established to promote public interest in the navy.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=349}} In 1925, Prica conducted exercises off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of vessels.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In 1926, the navy was able to make its first significant acquisition, the former [[Imperial German Navy]] [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Niobe}}, which was renamed ''Dalmacija''. She was refitted at the Tivat Arsenal prior to commissioning. The following year, two British-built [[John I. Thornycroft & Company|Thornycroft]] [[Uskok-class torpedo boat|''Uskok''-class]] [[motor torpedo boat]]s (MTBs) were acquired, named ''Uskok'' and ''\u010cetnik'', and a base was built for them at \u0160ibenik. In 1927, the first two submarines were purchased, the British-built [[Hrabri-class submarine|''Hrabri'' class]]\u2014[[Yugoslav submarine Hrabri|''Hrabri'']] and [[Yugoslav submarine Neboj\u0161a|''Neboj\u0161a'']]. Over the next two years, two further submarines were brought into service, the French-built [[Osvetnik-class submarine|''Osvetnik'' class]], which consisted of [[Yugoslav submarine Osvetnik|''Osvetnik'']] and [[Yugoslav submarine Smeli|''Smeli'']]. The submarine flotilla was based at Tivat, supported by the depot ship ''Hvar'' (ex-''Solun''), acquired in 1927. Between 1928 and 1930, a number of former Austro-Hungarian vessels were discarded, including the four ''Kaiman''-class torpedo boats. In 1929, the salvage ship ''Mo\u0107ni'' was scrapped, and the German-built {{convert|740|LT|ST|adj=on|abbr=on}} ''Spasilac'' was acquired to replace her.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=349}}\n\nIn late 1928, the naval aviation school was transferred from \u0110enovi\u0107i to Divulje near Split, where a new seaplane station was established. In the same year, the {{convert|1870|LT|ST|adj=on|abbr=on}} seaplane depot ship [[Yugoslav minelayer Zmaj|''Zmaj'']] was acquired from Germany.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=350}} In May and June 1929, a squadron, under the command of Prica and consisting of ''Dalmacija'', ''Hvar'' and the two ''Hrabri''-class submarines, visited [[Malta]], [[Corfu]] and [[Bizerte]]. Also in 1929, the former Austro-Hungarian water carrier ''Najade'', now named ''Sitnica'', was re-employed as an auxiliary for the submarine flotilla, despite its lack of a workshop for repair work.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In late 1929, Navy Command and Navy Section were combined as part of the Ministry of Army and Navy, with the navy commander holding the rank of admiral, and his deputy with the rank of vice-admiral. By that time, the Yugoslav fleet consisted of the light cruiser ''Dalmacija'', the eight 250t-class seagoing torpedo boats, the two ''Uskok''-class MTBs, four submarines, six ''Galeb''-class minetenders, one minesweeper, the submarine depot ship ''Hvar'', the training ship ''Sitnica'', two yachts ''Vila'' and ''Lada'', and five tugs. The riverine flotilla consisted of the four monitors and the river auxiliary ''Srbija''. In total, the navy comprised 256 officers and 2,000 men, with a naval reserve consisting of 164 officers and 570 men. Less than half of the officers were former members of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and 49 officers had graduated from the Naval Academy.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=350}} In October, Prica retired as navy commander and was replaced by Vice-Admiral V. Wickerhauser.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=182}}\n\n====1930\u20131940====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-185-0116-22A, Bucht von Kotor (-), jugoslawische Schiffe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The flotilla leader ''Dubrovnik'' (left) at the Bay of Kotor|alt=a black and white photograph of two ships at dock]]\nIn January 1929, King Alexander changed the name of the country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and the navy became the Royal Yugoslav Navy ({{lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslavenska Ratna Mornarica|links=no}}, \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0430 \u041c\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0446\u0430, KJRM). In April 1930, the salvage vessel ''Spasilac'' was added to the fleet, and the following month the submarine ''Neboj\u0161a'' was damaged when she collided with a steamer. In July, the two ''Hrabri''-class submarines and ''Sitnica'' made a [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] cruise, visiting [[Alexandria]] and [[Beirut]]. The appointment of a chief of the Maritime Air Force in 1930 signified the separation of naval aviation from army control, with a strength of around 1,000 officers and men, of whom about 80 were pilots. Around 120 naval aircraft were in service.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=247}} In 1931, the fleet expanded significantly with the completion of the British-built [[flotilla leader]] [[Yugoslav destroyer Dubrovnik|''Dubrovnik'']].{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=350}} The [[flotilla leader]] concept involved building large [[destroyer]]s similar to the World War I [[Royal Navy]] [[V and W-class destroyer]]s.{{sfn|Freivogel|2014|p=83}} In the [[interwar period|interwar]] [[French Navy]], these ships were known as ''contre-torpilleurs'', and were intended to operate with smaller destroyers, or as half-flotillas of three ships. The KJRM decided to build three such flotilla leaders, ships that would have the ability to reach high speeds and with a long endurance. The long endurance requirement reflected Yugoslav plans to deploy the ships into the central [[Mediterranean]], where they would be able to operate alongside French and British warships. The onset of the [[Great Depression]] meant that only one ship of the planned half-flotilla was ever built.{{sfn|Freivogel|2014|p=84}} Five locally-built [[Malinska-class mining tender|''Malinska''-class minelayers]] were also added to the fleet in 1931. The following year, a new German-built {{convert|720|LT|ST|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[brigantine]] sail training ship, [[Jadran (ship)|''Jadran'']] was acquired,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=350}} and Wickerhauser retired and was replaced by Vice-Admiral N.N.

In the same year, ''Dubrovnik'' sailed to the [[Black Sea]] then visited several ports in the Mediterranean with King Alexander and [[Maria of Yugoslavia|Queen Marie]] aboard. During 1932, the Maritime Air Force had bases at Divulje and \u0110enovi\u0107i, with two bomber squadrons and one reconnaissance squadron at each base, each squadron consisting of 12 aircraft.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=453\u2013454}} In 1934, the British naval attach\u00e9 reported that the French had significant influence on Yugoslav naval policy. In the same year, the KJRM comprised 517 officers and 6,461 men, and Stankovi\u0107 retired and was replaced by Rear-Admiral M.&nbsp;L. Poli\u0107.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=541\u2013542}} In October, ''Hrabri'' and ''Smeli'' conducted visits to various Mediterranean ports.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=544}} Despite the fact that a half-flotilla of large destroyers was not going to be built, the idea that ''Dubrovnik'' might operate with a number of smaller destroyers persisted. In 1934, the KJRM decided to acquire three such destroyers to operate in a [[division (naval)|division]] led by ''Dubrovnik''.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=543}} In August 1935, ''Dubrovnik'' visited Corfu and Bizerte, the seaplane carrier ''Zmaj'' along with three ''Galeb''-class mine tenders also visited Corfu, and ''Hrabri'' and ''Osvetnik'' visited Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=641}}\n\nIn 1936, eight German-built [[Orjen-class torpedo boat|''Orjen''-class MTBs]] were added.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=350}} Also in 1936, a new naval coastal command was established under the command of a rear admiral. It was headquartered in Split, and included shore-based commands at [[Selce, Croatia|Selce]], \u0160ibenik and \u0110enovi\u0107i. By the end of that year, the KJRM consisted of 27 surface combatants, four submarines, and around a dozen auxiliary vessels, crewed by a total of 487 officers and about 5,000 men. The yacht ''Lada'' had been disposed of, as had the minesweeper ''D2''.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The naval historian Milan Vego provides conflicting information regarding the fate of minesweeper ''D2''.

The river flotilla consisted of the four monitors, the royal yacht ''Dragor'', two patrol boats\u2014''Grani\u010dar'' and ''Stra\u017ear'', and three river tugs; ''Cer'', ''Triglav'' and ''Avala''. However, in 1936 the only vessels ready for war service were ''Dubrovnik'' and the four submarines, and the navy was only considered capable of patrol duties and coastal surveillance, minelaying and minor raids against enemy shipping. Despite this, the United States naval attach\u00e9 observed that the morale and discipline of the navy was very good. He further stated that higher-level commanders appeared discouraged at the poor position of the navy due to its inadequate budget. He concluded that the fleet was in very good condition considering its funding.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=350}} During 1936, ''Neboj\u0161a'' and ''Osvetnik'' visited Corfu, and ''Zmaj'' and three ''Galeb''-class mine tenders also visited Corfu.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=738}}\n[[File:Torpedo boat velebit in 1939.jpg|thumb|The ''Orjen''-class MTB ''Velebit'' underway|250px|alt=a black and white photograph of a ship underway]]\nIn 1936\u20131937, the fleet was significantly strengthened by the acquisition of three {{convert|1240|LT|ST|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[Beograd-class destroyer|''Beograd''-class destroyer]]s, the French-built [[Yugoslav destroyer Beograd|''Beograd'']], and the locally-built [[Yugoslav destroyer Zagreb|''Zagreb'']] and [[Yugoslav destroyer Ljubljana|''Ljubljana'']]. Naval communication via [[Teleprinter|teletype]] was established to connect Naval Command in Zemun with bases at Selce, Split, \u0160ibenik and Novi Sad. Split was also connected to Divulje, and \u0110enovi\u0107i was connected with the Tivat Arsenal.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=350}} In 1937, the Naval Command was renamed the Naval Staff, and a Naval Staff College was established at Dubrovnik. Considerable effort was made to bring the fleet to sound seagoing condition, with a refit of ''Dalmacija''. ''Dubrovnik'' was considered to be in good repair, but the two French-built submarines needed constant work. The eight new ''Orjen''-class MTBs were found to be unseaworthy in rough conditions, but satisfactory in fair weather. ''Dubrovnik'' visited [[Istanbul]], [[Moudros|Mudros]] and [[Piraeus]] in August, and ''Zmaj'', ''Hrabri'' and ''Smeli'' visited [[Crete]], Piraeus and Corfu in August and September.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=835\u2013837}}\n\nIn 1938, the navy consisted of 611 officers and 8,562 men. A Balkan Naval Conference was conducted in the same year, during which the Chief of the Naval Staff declared that in case of war, the Yugoslav fleet would concentrate on coastal defence, except for occasional submarine forays. The Maritime Air Force could field a total of 40 aircraft, but only the 12 [[Dornier Do 22]]s and 12 [[Dornier Do J]]s were considered to be of any value in modern warfare. ''Dubrovnik'' visited Alexandria, Beirut and Corfu in August 1938.{{sfn|Jarman|1997c|pp=92\u201394}} In 1939, a new {{convert|2400|LT|ST|abbr=on|adj=on}} destroyer [[Yugoslav destroyer Split|''Split'']] was laid down, and two coastal [[German Type II submarine|German Type IIB submarines]] were ordered, but due to the outbreak of [[World War II]], ''Split'' was not completed and the submarines were never delivered.{{sfn|Vego|1982|pp=350\u2013352}} In 1939, the British observed that the commander-in-chief of the Yugoslav Navy, Poli\u0107, was \"amiable but ignorant\" and had little technical knowledge regarding naval matters.{{sfn|Jarman|1997c|p=121}} In the same year, the 250t-class torpedo boat ''T2'' was broken up for scrap.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} In January 1940, ''Ljubljana'' struck a reef off \u0160ibenik and sank. She was raised and placed in dry dock at the Tivat Arsenal for repairs.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=352}}\n\n===Prior to the April 1941 invasion===\n{{See also|Yugoslav order of battle prior to the invasion of Yugoslavia}}\n[[File:Malinska.jpg|thumb|A ''Malinska''-class minelayer underway|alt=a black and white photograph of a small ship]]\nOn the eve of the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], the KJRM comprised 41 combatant ships and 19 auxiliaries, effectively divided into ships capable of offensive and defensive tasks, and ships intended for peacetime training, logistics and minelaying tasks. The former category included ''Dubrovnik'', the three ''Beograd''-class destroyers (although ''Ljubljana'' was in dry dock being repaired), the four submarines, eight ''Orjen''-class MTBs and two ''Uskok''-class MTBs. Of the submarines, only the two French-built ones were considered fully combat-ready. The latter category consisted of ''Dalmacija'', six ''Galeb''-class minelayers, six 250t-class torpedo boats, five ''Malinska''-class minelayers, and the training and auxiliary ships ''Jadran'', ''Zmaj'', ''Hvar'' and ''Sitnica''. The Maritime Air Force consisted of 150 seaplanes, of which 120 were combat-capable, the remainder being training aircraft. The combat aircraft were mainly Do 22s, Do Js and [[Dornier Komet|Do D]] types. Although torpedo-capable aircraft were in service, no air-launched torpedoes were available.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=354}}\n\nThere were significant weaknesses in the KJRM prior to the invasion. One was the failure to subordinate the Naval Surveillance Command to respective sectors of Naval Coastal Command, and another was giving responsibility for two sectors of Naval Coastal Command to what were essentially training establishments.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=360}}\n\n===Naval operations during the invasion of 1941===\nWhen Germany and Italy attacked Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941, the initial attacks came from the air. From early morning, Italian and German aircraft attacked the naval facilities at Split and the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=205}} In the afternoon, Italian dive bombers attacked the Bay of Kotor. Their attack damaged a Do J flying boat, but one of the Italian aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire, while another two were damaged. Shortly after this more Italian bombers unsuccessfully attacked the Tivat Arsenal, suffering three aircraft damaged in the attack. On the same day, three KJRM Dornier Do 22s and Rogo\u017earski SIM-XIV-Hs provided air cover while the ''Galeb''-class minelayer ''Jastreb'' laid a minefield off [[Budva]] harbour.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=207}} The following day, three Italian bombers became lost in cloud and emerged over the Bay of Kotor where two were damaged and one shot down by anti-aircraft fire.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=213}} On 8 April, there were Italian attacks on the base of the 2nd and 3rd Torpedo Divisions in \u0160ibenik, and three Do J flying boats were destroyed by Italian fighters at [[Jadrtovac]]. A number of Do 22s and SIM-XIV-Hs also flew reconnaissance missions on that day.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=216}} The next day, Italian bombers struck a number of Yugoslav naval and seaplane bases along the coast, destroying and damaging several aircraft. One Do 22 pilot located an Italian convoy crossing the Adriatic and despite heavy anti-aircraft fire attacked it twice without result. Another three KJRM Do 22s raided [[Durr\u00ebs|Durazzo]] in Italian-controlled Albania, but were driven off.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=218}}\n\nTo prevent a bridgehead being established at [[Zadar|Zara]], an Italian enclave on the Dalmatian coast, ''Beograd'', four 250t-class torpedo boats and six MTBs were dispatched to \u0160ibenik, {{convert|80|km}} to the south of Zara, in preparation for an attack. The attack was to be coordinated with the [[12th Infantry Division Jadranska|12th Infantry Division ''Jadranska'']] and two combined regiments ({{lang-sh-Latn|odredi|links=no}}) of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] attacking from the [[Benkovac]] area, supported by the [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]]'s 81st Bomber Group. The Yugoslavs launched their attack on 9 April, but the naval prong of this attack faltered when ''Beograd'' was damaged by near misses from Italian aircraft off \u0160ibenik when her starboard engine was put out of action, after which she limped to the Bay of Kotor, escorted by the remainder of the force, for repairs.{{sfn|Whitely|2001|p=312}} The Italian aerial bombardment of Kotor badly damaged the minelayer ''Kobac'', which had to be beached to prevent its sinking.{{sfn|Cernuschi|2013|p=}}\n\nOn 10 April, the 2nd Hydroplane Command at Divulje began to disintegrate, with some pilots flying their aircraft to the Bay of Kotor to join the 3rd Hydroplane Command. One Do 22 attacked an Italian tanker off [[Bari]], claiming a near miss that the Yugoslav crew believed to have caused some damage.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=220}} The following day, Italian dive bombers attacked MTBs of the 2nd Torpedo Division near \u0160ibenik, with the Yugoslav boats shooting down one Italian aircraft and damaging another.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=222}}\n\nAt the start of the campaign, the river monitors had carried out offensive operations by shelling the airfield at [[Moh\u00e1cs]] in [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] on 6 April and again two days later, but had to begin withdrawing towards Novi Sad by 11 April after coming under repeated attack by German dive bombers. Early in the morning of 12 April, a squadron of German dive bombers attacked the Yugoslav monitors on the Danube. ''Drava'' was hit by several of them but they were unable to penetrate her {{convert|300|mm|adj=on}} thick deck armour, until by chance, one put a bomb straight down the funnel, killing 54 of the 67 crew. During the attack, the monitors' anti-aircraft gunners claimed three dive bombers shot down. The remaining three monitors were scuttled by their crews later on 12 April as German and Hungarian forces had occupied their bases and the river systems upon which they operated.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=222 & 224}} The crews then gathered on a tugboat and attempted to flee to the Black Sea. While the boat was passing under a bridge near Zemun, it was attacked by Axis aircraft.

The submarine ''Neboj\u0161a'' and two ''Orjen''-class MTBs escaped to Alexandria to join the Allied cause.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} A fourth destroyer, ''Split'', was captured while under construction in the Kotor shipyard, but the Italians were not able to complete her before [[Armistice of Cassibile|they sued for peace]] in September 1943. She was completed by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war.{{sfn|Whitely|2001|p=313}} Ten Maritime Air Force aircraft escaped to Greece, with nine eventually making it to Egypt, where they formed a squadron under [[Royal Air Force]] command.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=229}} The three Yugoslav ships that escaped capture were used to create a KJRM-in-exile. The force was led by Captain I. Kern, who was attached to the [[Yugoslav government-in-exile]] in London, and operated with the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]] from bases in Malta and Alexandria.{{sfn|Adamich|1963|pp=140\u2013141}}\n\nA number of the captured Yugoslav warships, notably ''Dubrovnik'', ''Beograd'' and the repaired ''Ljubljana'', were employed by the Italian ''Regia Marina'' until the armistice in 1943, whereupon the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'', and to a lesser extent the [[Navy of the Independent State of Croatia]], appropriated the surviving vessels for their own fleets. ''Ljubljana'' was wrecked on a shoal near the [[Gulf of Tunis]] whilst in Italian service in April 1943, and ''Dalmacija'' entered German service with her previous German name ''Niobe'', but was soon transferred to the Croatian navy as ''Zniam''. Beached on [[Silba]] island, she was destroyed by British MTBs in December 1943. ''Dubrovnik'' and ''Beograd'' were not sunk by Allied forces until April and May 1945 respectively.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|pp=357\u2013358}}\n\nIn early 1944, the Royal Navy [[Flower-class corvette|''Flower''-class corvette]] [[HMS Mallow (K81)|''Mallow'']] was transferred to the KJRM-in-exile as ''Nada''.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|pp=358\u2013359}} In August 1945, following the end of World War II in Europe, the British government ordered the navy to disband. Its assets were transferred to the newly constituted post-war Yugoslav Navy,{{sfn|Adamich|1963|p=141}} where they continued their service. The post-war Yugoslav Navy drew its insignia and traditions from the Partisan naval forces that evolved from armed fishing vessels operated along the Adriatic coast from late 1942, so few of the traditions of the KJRM were carried over to the post-war navy.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=356}} The British government gave the personnel of the KJRM-in-exile the choice of being repatriated or remaining in exile. Of these, 93 men chose to stay abroad. The British government briefly housed them in military camps before allowing them to move to countries of their choosing.{{sfn|Adamich|1963|p=141}}\n\n==Organisation==\n===Peacetime===\nThe peacetime organisation of the KJRM remained essentially unchanged from 1929 until the invasion of Yugoslavia. The Naval Command in Zemun formed part of the Ministry of Army and Navy, and controlled Navy Headquarters. Navy Headquarters consisted of the staff, archives, main naval radio station and the navy newspaper, and controlled six branches; the fleet, River and Lake Forces, Maritime Air Force, Coastal Defence Command, Naval Surveillance Command, and shore establishments. The exact composition of the fleet varied considerably as vessels were added and disposed of, but from 1938 it usually comprised three torpedo divisions, a submarine division and a training squadron, reaching its maximum strength during the summer training period each year. The minelayers were usually part of the Coastal Defence Command, but were detached to the fleet during naval exercises, as were naval aviation squadrons. The Maritime Air Force consisted of three seaplane commands each of two groups, the naval aviation school and the seaplane depot ship ''Zmaj''.{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=352}}\n\n===Wartime===\nIn case of war or national emergency, the Naval Staff was to become directly subordinate to the [[Supreme Command (Kingdom of Yugoslavia)|Supreme Command]]. The Naval Staff would command the fleet, river flotilla, Maritime Air Force and Naval Coastal Command. All other naval establishments would remain under the control of the Navy Section of the Ministry of Army and Navy. There were a few exceptions to these general arrangements. For example, the naval detachments on [[Lake Ohrid]] and [[Lake Skadar|Lake Scutari]] were subordinated to the local army districts, and the Naval Coastal Command was subordinated to the Royal Yugoslav Army's Coastal Defence Command.
