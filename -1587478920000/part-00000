(These lands had been held by the family since before the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086.)

The ''[[American Journal of Physics]]'' commented, \"Luis Alvarez was one of the most brilliant and productive experimental physicists of the twentieth century.\"<ref name=AJP>{{cite journal | last=Wohl | first=C.

Alvarez devised a set of experiments to observe K-[[electron capture]] in [[radioactivity|radioactive nuclei]], predicted by the [[beta decay]] theory but never before observed. He produced [[tritium]] using the [[cyclotron]] and measured its lifetime. In collaboration with [[Felix Bloch]], he measured the [[Neutron magnetic moment|magnetic moment of the neutron]].\n\nIn 1940 Alvarez joined the [[MIT Radiation Laboratory]], where he contributed to a number of [[World War II]] [[radar]] projects, from early improvements to [[Identification friend or foe]] (IFF) radar beacons, now called [[transponder]]s, to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne [[microwave]] radars. Enemy submarines would wait until the radar signal was getting strong and then submerge, escaping attack. But VIXEN transmitted a radar signal whose strength was the cube of the distance to the submarine so that as they approached the sub, the signal\u2014as measured by the sub\u2014got progressively weaker, and the sub assumed the plane was getting farther away and didn't submerge.<ref>Alvarez, L.

Alvarez spent a few months at the [[University of Chicago]] working on [[nuclear reactor]]s for [[Enrico Fermi]] before coming to [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] to work for [[Robert Oppenheimer]] on the [[Manhattan project]]. Alvarez worked on the design of [[explosive lens]]es, and the development of [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s. As a member of [[Project Alberta]], he observed the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] from a [[B-29 Superfortress]], and later the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing of Hiroshima]] from the B-29 ''[[The Great Artiste]]''.\n\nAfter the war Alvarez was involved in the design of a [[liquid hydrogen]] [[bubble chamber]] that allowed his team to take millions of photographs of particle interactions, develop complex computer systems to measure and analyze these interactions, and discover entire families of new particles and [[resonance (particle physics)|resonance states]]. This work resulted in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1968. He was involved in a project to [[x-ray]] the [[Egyptian pyramids]] to search for unknown chambers. With his son, geologist [[Walter Alvarez]], he developed the [[Alvarez hypothesis]] which proposes that the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|extinction event]] that wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs was the result of an asteroid impact.\n\nAlvarez was a member of the [[JASON (advisory group)|JASON Defense Advisory Group]], the [[Bohemian Club]], and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref name=\"harv\">{{cite book | last=Trower | first=W.

A telegram soon arrived from Gladys with a job offer from Lawrence. This started a long association with the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Alvarez and Smithwick were married in one of the chapels at the University of Chicago and then headed for California.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | p=38}} They had two children, [[Walter Alvarez|Walter]] and Jean.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | p=284}} They were divorced in 1957.

At that time the stability of these two reaction products was unknown, but based on existing theories [[Hans Bethe]] thought that tritium would be stable and helium-3 unstable. Alvarez proved the reverse by using his knowledge of the details of the 60-inch [[cyclotron]] operation. He tuned the machine to accelerate doubly ionized helium-3 nuclei and was able to get a [[ion beam|beam of accelerated ions]], thus using the cyclotron as a kind of super [[mass spectrometer]].

The [[National Defense Research Committee]], established only months earlier by President [[Franklin Roosevelt]], created a central national laboratory at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) for the purpose of developing military applications of microwave radar. Lawrence immediately recruited his best \"cyclotroneers\", among them Alvarez, who joined this new laboratory, known as the [[Radiation Laboratory]], on November 11, 1940.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=78\u201385}} Alvarez contributed to a number of [[radar]] projects, from early improvements to [[Identification Friend or Foe]] (IFF) radar beacons, now called [[transponders]], to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=90\u201393}}\n\nOne of the first projects was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar made possible by the [[cavity magnetron]]. In working on the [[Microwave Early Warning]] system (MEW), Alvarez invented a [[phased array|linear dipole array antenna]] that not only suppressed the unwanted [[side lobe]]s of the radiation field, but also could be electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle [[precision bombing]] radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of [[B-29]]s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to make much difference.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=101\u2013103}}\n\n[[File:Luis Alvarez with president Harry Truman.jpg|thumb|Receiving the [[Collier Trophy]] from President [[Harry Truman]], White House, 1946]]\nThe radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has played a major role in aviation, most particularly in the post war [[Berlin airlift]], was [[Ground Controlled Approach]] (GCA). Using Alvarez's dipole antenna to achieve a very high [[angular resolution]], GCA allows ground-based radar operators watching special precision displays to guide a landing airplane to the runway by transmitting verbal commands to the pilot. The system was simple, direct, and worked well, even with previously untrained pilots. It was so successful that the military continued to use it for many years after the war, and it was still in use in some countries in the 1980s.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=96\u2013100}} Alvarez was awarded the [[National Aeronautic Association]]'s [[Collier Trophy]] in 1945 \"for his conspicuous and outstanding initiative in the concept and development of the Ground Control Approach system for safe landing of aircraft under all weather and traffic conditions\".<ref>{{cite web | title=Collier 1940\u20131949 Winners | url=http://naa.aero/html/awards/index.cfm?cmsid=156 | publisher=[[National Aeronautic Association]] | accessdate=March 21, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203122514/http://naa.aero/html/awards/index.cfm?cmsid=156 | archive-date=December 3, 2013 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/38806783/the_courierjournal/|title=Radar Expert will Receive Collier Trophy|date=December 13, 1946|newspaper=The Courier-Journal|location=Louisville, Kentucky|page=16|via=Newspapers.com|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>\n\nAlvarez spent the summer of 1943 in England testing GCA, landing planes returning from battle in bad weather, and also training the British in the use of the system. While there he encountered the young [[Arthur C. Clarke]], who was an RAF radar technician. Clarke subsequently used his experiences at the radar research station as the basis for his novel ''[[Glide Path]]'', which contains a thinly disguised version of Alvarez.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=104\u2013110}} Clarke and Alvarez developed a long-term friendship.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=110}}\n\n=== Manhattan Project ===\nIn the fall of 1943, Alvarez returned to the United States with an offer from [[Robert Oppenheimer]] to work at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] on the [[Manhattan project]]. But Oppenheimer suggested that he first spend a few months at the [[University of Chicago]] working with [[Enrico Fermi]] before coming to Los Alamos. During these months, General [[Leslie Groves]] asked Alvarez to think of a way that the US could find out if the Germans were operating any [[nuclear reactor]]s, and, if so, where they were. Alvarez suggested that an airplane could carry a system to detect the radioactive gases that a reactor produces, particularly [[xenon 133]]. The equipment did fly over Germany, but detected no radioactive xenon because the Germans had not built a reactor capable of a chain reaction. This was the first idea of monitoring [[fission product]]s for [[intelligence gathering]]. It would become extremely important after the war.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=114\u2013121}}\n\n[[File:Luis Alvarez - Flak Jacket.JPG|thumb|left|Wearing a helmet and [[flak jacket]] and standing in front of ''[[The Great Artiste]]'', [[Tinian]] 1945]]\nAs a result of his radar work and the few months spent with Fermi, Alvarez arrived at Los Alamos in the spring of 1944, later than many of his contemporaries. The work on the \"[[Little Boy]]\" (a uranium bomb) was far along so Alvarez became involved in the design of the \"[[Fat Man]]\" (a plutonium bomb). The technique used for uranium, that of forcing the two sub-[[critical mass]]es together using a [[Gun-type fission weapon|type of gun]], would not work with plutonium because the high level of background [[spontaneous fission|spontaneous neutrons]] would cause fissions as soon as the two parts approached each other, so heat and expansion would force the system apart before much energy has been released. It was decided to use a nearly critical sphere of [[plutonium]] and compress it quickly by explosives into a much smaller and denser [[plutonium core|core]], a technical challenge at the time.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=123\u2013128}}\n\nTo create the symmetrical [[nuclear weapon design|implosion]] required to compress the plutonium core to the required density, thirty two explosive charges were to be simultaneously detonated around the spherical core. Using conventional explosive techniques with [[blasting cap]]s, progress towards achieving simultaneity to within a small fraction of a microsecond was discouraging. Alvarez directed his graduate student, [[Lawrence H. Johnston]], to use a large [[capacitor]] to deliver a [[high voltage]] charge directly to each [[explosive lens]], replacing blasting caps with [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s. The exploding wire detonated the thirty two charges to within a few tenths of a microsecond. The invention was critical to the success of the [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]]. He also supervised the [[RaLa Experiment]]s.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=131\u2013136}} Alvarez later wrote that:\n{{quote|With modern weapons-grade uranium, the background neutron rate is so low that terrorists, if they had such material, would have a good chance of setting off a high-yield explosion simply by dropping one half of the material onto the other half. Most people seem unaware that if separated [[uranium-235|U-235]] is at hand, it's a trivial job to set off a nuclear explosion, whereas if only plutonium is available, making it explode is the most difficult technical job I know.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | p=125}} }}\n\n[[File:Agnew on Tinian.jpg|thumb|Alvarez (top right) on Tinian with [[Harold Agnew]] (top left), [[Lawrence H.

After being commissioned as a [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in the [[United States Army]], he observed the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] from a [[B-29 Superfortress]] that also carried fellow [[Project Alberta]] members [[Harold Agnew]] and [[Deak Parsons]] (who were respectively commissioned at the rank of [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]]).{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=137\u2013142}}\n\nFlying in the [[B-29 Superfortress]] ''[[The Great Artiste]]'' in formation with the ''[[Enola Gay]]'', Alvarez and Johnston measured the blast effect of the [[Little Boy]] bomb which was [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped on Hiroshima]].{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=6\u20138}} A few days later, again flying in ''The Great Artiste'', Johnston used the same equipment to measure the strength of the [[Nagasaki bomb|Nagasaki]] explosion.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=144\u2013146}}\n\n== Bubble chamber ==\n[[File:Luis Alvarez - Nobel with Balloon.jpg|thumb|Celebrating winning the Nobel Prize, October 30, 1968. The balloons are inscribed with the names of subatomic particles that his group discovered.]]\nReturning to the University of California, Berkeley as a [[full professor]], Alvarez had many ideas about how to use his wartime radar knowledge to improve [[particle accelerator]]s. Though some of these were to bear fruit, the \"big idea\" of this time would come from [[Edwin McMillan]] with his concept of [[Synchrocyclotron|phase stability]] which led to the [[synchrocyclotron]]. Refining and extending this concept, the Lawrence team would build the world's then-largest proton accelerator, the [[Bevatron]], which began operating in 1954. Though the Bevatron could produce copious amounts of interesting particles, particularly in secondary collisions, these complex interactions were hard to detect and analyze at the time.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=153\u2013159}}\n\nSeizing upon a new development to visualize particle tracks, created by [[Donald A. Glaser|Donald Glaser]] and known as a [[bubble chamber]], Alvarez realized the device was just what was needed, if only it could be made to function with [[liquid hydrogen]]. [[Hydrogen]] nuclei, which are [[proton]]s, made the simplest and most desirable target for interactions with the particles produced by the Bevatron. He began a development program to build a series of small chambers, and championed the device to Ernest Lawrence.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=185\u2013189}}\n\nThe Glaser device was a small glass cylinder ({{nowrap|1 cm \u00d7 2 cm}}) filled with [[diethyl ether|ether]]. By suddenly reducing the pressure in the device, the liquid could be placed into a temporary [[superheated]] state, which would boil along the disturbed track of a particle passing through. Glaser was able to maintain the superheated state for a few seconds before spontaneous boiling took place. The Alvarez team built chambers of 1.5&nbsp;in, 2.5&nbsp;in, 4&nbsp;in, 10&nbsp;in, and 15&nbsp;in using liquid hydrogen, and constructed of metal with glass windows, so that the tracks could be photographed. The chamber could be cycled in synchronization with the accelerator beam, a picture could be taken, and the chamber recompressed in time for the next beam cycle.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=190\u2013194}}\n\nThis program built a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber almost 7 feet (2 meters) long, employed dozens of physicists and graduate students together with hundreds of engineers and technicians, took millions of photographs of particle interactions, developed computer systems to measure and analyze the interactions, and discovered families of new particles and [[resonance (particle physics)|resonance states]].

I've found the two almost equally rewarding.\" An important contributor to this was his enjoyment of flying. He learned to fly in 1933, later earning [[instrument rating|instrument]] and multi-engine ratings. Over the next 50 years he accumulated over 1000 hours of flight time, most of it as pilot in command.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987|pp=30\u201331}} He said, \"I found few activities as satisfying as being pilot in command with responsibility for my passengers' lives.\"{{sfn|Alvarez|1987|pp=268}}\n\nAlvarez made numerous professional contributions to aviation. During World War II he led the development of multiple aviation-related technologies. Several of his projects are described above, including Ground Controlled Approach (GCA) for which he was awarded the Collier Trophy in 1945. He also held the basic patent for the radar [[transponder]], for which he assigned rights to the U.S. government for $1.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987|pp=30\u201331}}\n\nLater in his career Alvarez served on multiple high level advisory committees related to civilian and military aviation.

The ''[[American Journal of Physics]]'' commented, \"Luis Alvarez was one of the most brilliant and productive experimental physicists of the twentieth century.\"<ref name=AJP>{{cite journal | last=Wohl | first=C.

Alvarez devised a set of experiments to observe K-[[electron capture]] in [[radioactivity|radioactive nuclei]], predicted by the [[beta decay]] theory but never before observed. He produced [[tritium]] using the [[cyclotron]] and measured its lifetime. In collaboration with [[Felix Bloch]], he measured the [[Neutron magnetic moment|magnetic moment of the neutron]].\n\nIn 1940 Alvarez joined the [[MIT Radiation Laboratory]], where he contributed to a number of [[World War II]] [[radar]] projects, from early improvements to [[Identification friend or foe]] (IFF) radar beacons, now called [[transponder]]s, to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne [[microwave]] radars. Enemy submarines would wait until the radar signal was getting strong and then submerge, escaping attack. But VIXEN transmitted a radar signal whose strength was the cube of the distance to the submarine so that as they approached the sub, the signal\u2014as measured by the sub\u2014got progressively weaker, and the sub assumed the plane was getting farther away and didn't submerge.<ref>Alvarez, L.

Alvarez spent a few months at the [[University of Chicago]] working on [[nuclear reactor]]s for [[Enrico Fermi]] before coming to [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] to work for [[Robert Oppenheimer]] on the [[Manhattan project]]. Alvarez worked on the design of [[explosive lens]]es, and the development of [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s. As a member of [[Project Alberta]], he observed the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] from a [[B-29 Superfortress]], and later the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing of Hiroshima]] from the B-29 ''[[The Great Artiste]]''.\n\nAfter the war Alvarez was involved in the design of a [[liquid hydrogen]] [[bubble chamber]] that allowed his team to take millions of photographs of particle interactions, develop complex computer systems to measure and analyze these interactions, and discover entire families of new particles and [[resonance (particle physics)|resonance states]]. This work resulted in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1968. He was involved in a project to [[x-ray]] the [[Egyptian pyramids]] to search for unknown chambers. With his son, geologist [[Walter Alvarez]], he developed the [[Alvarez hypothesis]] which proposes that the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|extinction event]] that wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs was the result of an asteroid impact.\n\nAlvarez was a member of the [[JASON (advisory group)|JASON Defense Advisory Group]], the [[Bohemian Club]], and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref name=\"harv\">{{cite book | last=Trower | first=W.

This is one of the most basic [[fusion reaction]]s, and the foundation of the [[thermonuclear weapon]] and the current research on [[controlled thermonuclear fusion|controlled nuclear fusion]]. At that time the stability of these two reaction products was unknown, but based on existing theories [[Hans Bethe]] thought that tritium would be stable and helium-3 unstable. Alvarez proved the reverse by using his knowledge of the details of the 60-inch [[cyclotron]] operation. He tuned the machine to accelerate doubly ionized helium-3 nuclei and was able to get a [[ion beam|beam of accelerated ions]], thus using the cyclotron as a kind of super [[mass spectrometer]]. As the accelerated helium came from deep [[gas well]]s where it had been for millions of years, the helium-3 component had to be stable.

The [[National Defense Research Committee]], established only months earlier by President [[Franklin Roosevelt]], created a central national laboratory at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) for the purpose of developing military applications of microwave radar. Lawrence immediately recruited his best \"cyclotroneers\", among them Alvarez, who joined this new laboratory, known as the [[Radiation Laboratory]], on November 11, 1940.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=78\u201385}} Alvarez contributed to a number of [[radar]] projects, from early improvements to [[Identification Friend or Foe]] (IFF) radar beacons, now called [[transponders]], to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=90\u201393}}\n\nOne of the first projects was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar made possible by the [[cavity magnetron]]. In working on the [[Microwave Early Warning]] system (MEW), Alvarez invented a [[phased array|linear dipole array antenna]] that not only suppressed the unwanted [[side lobe]]s of the radiation field, but also could be electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle [[precision bombing]] radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of [[B-29]]s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to make much difference.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=101\u2013103}}\n\n[[File:Luis Alvarez with president Harry Truman.jpg|thumb|Receiving the [[Collier Trophy]] from President [[Harry Truman]], White House, 1946]]\nThe radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has played a major role in aviation, most particularly in the post war [[Berlin airlift]], was [[Ground Controlled Approach]] (GCA). Using Alvarez's dipole antenna to achieve a very high [[angular resolution]], GCA allows ground-based radar operators watching special precision displays to guide a landing airplane to the runway by transmitting verbal commands to the pilot. The system was simple, direct, and worked well, even with previously untrained pilots. It was so successful that the military continued to use it for many years after the war, and it was still in use in some countries in the 1980s.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=96\u2013100}} Alvarez was awarded the [[National Aeronautic Association]]'s [[Collier Trophy]] in 1945 \"for his conspicuous and outstanding initiative in the concept and development of the Ground Control Approach system for safe landing of aircraft under all weather and traffic conditions\".<ref>{{cite web | title=Collier 1940\u20131949 Winners | url=http://naa.aero/html/awards/index.cfm?cmsid=156 | publisher=[[National Aeronautic Association]] | accessdate=March 21, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203122514/http://naa.aero/html/awards/index.cfm?cmsid=156 | archive-date=December 3, 2013 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/38806783/the_courierjournal/|title=Radar Expert will Receive Collier Trophy|date=December 13, 1946|newspaper=The Courier-Journal|location=Louisville, Kentucky|page=16|via=Newspapers.com|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>\n\nAlvarez spent the summer of 1943 in England testing GCA, landing planes returning from battle in bad weather, and also training the British in the use of the system. While there he encountered the young [[Arthur C. Clarke]], who was an RAF radar technician. Clarke subsequently used his experiences at the radar research station as the basis for his novel ''[[Glide Path]]'', which contains a thinly disguised version of Alvarez.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=104\u2013110}} Clarke and Alvarez developed a long-term friendship.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=110}}\n\n=== Manhattan Project ===\nIn the fall of 1943, Alvarez returned to the United States with an offer from [[Robert Oppenheimer]] to work at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] on the [[Manhattan project]]. But Oppenheimer suggested that he first spend a few months at the [[University of Chicago]] working with [[Enrico Fermi]] before coming to Los Alamos. During these months, General [[Leslie Groves]] asked Alvarez to think of a way that the US could find out if the Germans were operating any [[nuclear reactor]]s, and, if so, where they were. Alvarez suggested that an airplane could carry a system to detect the radioactive gases that a reactor produces, particularly [[xenon 133]]. The equipment did fly over Germany, but detected no radioactive xenon because the Germans had not built a reactor capable of a chain reaction. This was the first idea of monitoring [[fission product]]s for [[intelligence gathering]]. It would become extremely important after the war.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=114\u2013121}}\n\n[[File:Luis Alvarez - Flak Jacket.JPG|thumb|left|Wearing a helmet and [[flak jacket]] and standing in front of ''[[The Great Artiste]]'', [[Tinian]] 1945]]\nAs a result of his radar work and the few months spent with Fermi, Alvarez arrived at Los Alamos in the spring of 1944, later than many of his contemporaries. The work on the \"[[Little Boy]]\" (a uranium bomb) was far along so Alvarez became involved in the design of the \"[[Fat Man]]\" (a plutonium bomb). The technique used for uranium, that of forcing the two sub-[[critical mass]]es together using a [[Gun-type fission weapon|type of gun]], would not work with plutonium because the high level of background [[spontaneous fission|spontaneous neutrons]] would cause fissions as soon as the two parts approached each other, so heat and expansion would force the system apart before much energy has been released. It was decided to use a nearly critical sphere of [[plutonium]] and compress it quickly by explosives into a much smaller and denser [[plutonium core|core]], a technical challenge at the time.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=123\u2013128}}\n\nTo create the symmetrical [[nuclear weapon design|implosion]] required to compress the plutonium core to the required density, thirty two explosive charges were to be simultaneously detonated around the spherical core. Using conventional explosive techniques with [[blasting cap]]s, progress towards achieving simultaneity to within a small fraction of a microsecond was discouraging. Alvarez directed his graduate student, [[Lawrence H. Johnston]], to use a large [[capacitor]] to deliver a [[high voltage]] charge directly to each [[explosive lens]], replacing blasting caps with [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s. The exploding wire detonated the thirty two charges to within a few tenths of a microsecond. The invention was critical to the success of the [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]]. He also supervised the [[RaLa Experiment]]s.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=131\u2013136}} Alvarez later wrote that:\n{{quote|With modern weapons-grade uranium, the background neutron rate is so low that terrorists, if they had such material, would have a good chance of setting off a high-yield explosion simply by dropping one half of the material onto the other half. Most people seem unaware that if separated [[uranium-235|U-235]] is at hand, it's a trivial job to set off a nuclear explosion, whereas if only plutonium is available, making it explode is the most difficult technical job I know.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | p=125}} }}\n\n[[File:Agnew on Tinian.jpg|thumb|Alvarez (top right) on Tinian with [[Harold Agnew]] (top left), [[Lawrence H.

After being commissioned as a [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in the [[United States Army]], he observed the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] from a [[B-29 Superfortress]] that also carried fellow [[Project Alberta]] members [[Harold Agnew]] and [[Deak Parsons]] (who were respectively commissioned at the rank of [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]]).{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=137\u2013142}}\n\nFlying in the [[B-29 Superfortress]] ''[[The Great Artiste]]'' in formation with the ''[[Enola Gay]]'', Alvarez and Johnston measured the blast effect of the [[Little Boy]] bomb which was [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped on Hiroshima]].{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=6\u20138}} A few days later, again flying in ''The Great Artiste'', Johnston used the same equipment to measure the strength of the [[Nagasaki bomb|Nagasaki]] explosion.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=144\u2013146}}\n\n== Bubble chamber ==\n[[File:Luis Alvarez - Nobel with Balloon.jpg|thumb|Celebrating winning the Nobel Prize, October 30, 1968. The balloons are inscribed with the names of subatomic particles that his group discovered.]]\nReturning to the University of California, Berkeley as a [[full professor]], Alvarez had many ideas about how to use his wartime radar knowledge to improve [[particle accelerator]]s. Though some of these were to bear fruit, the \"big idea\" of this time would come from [[Edwin McMillan]] with his concept of [[Synchrocyclotron|phase stability]] which led to the [[synchrocyclotron]]. Refining and extending this concept, the Lawrence team would build the world's then-largest proton accelerator, the [[Bevatron]], which began operating in 1954. Though the Bevatron could produce copious amounts of interesting particles, particularly in secondary collisions, these complex interactions were hard to detect and analyze at the time.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=153\u2013159}}\n\nSeizing upon a new development to visualize particle tracks, created by [[Donald A. Glaser|Donald Glaser]] and known as a [[bubble chamber]], Alvarez realized the device was just what was needed, if only it could be made to function with [[liquid hydrogen]]. [[Hydrogen]] nuclei, which are [[proton]]s, made the simplest and most desirable target for interactions with the particles produced by the Bevatron. He began a development program to build a series of small chambers, and championed the device to Ernest Lawrence.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=185\u2013189}}\n\nThe Glaser device was a small glass cylinder ({{nowrap|1 cm \u00d7 2 cm}}) filled with [[diethyl ether|ether]]. By suddenly reducing the pressure in the device, the liquid could be placed into a temporary [[superheated]] state, which would boil along the disturbed track of a particle passing through. Glaser was able to maintain the superheated state for a few seconds before spontaneous boiling took place. The Alvarez team built chambers of 1.5&nbsp;in, 2.5&nbsp;in, 4&nbsp;in, 10&nbsp;in, and 15&nbsp;in using liquid hydrogen, and constructed of metal with glass windows, so that the tracks could be photographed. The chamber could be cycled in synchronization with the accelerator beam, a picture could be taken, and the chamber recompressed in time for the next beam cycle.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=190\u2013194}}\n\nThis program built a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber almost 7 feet (2 meters) long, employed dozens of physicists and graduate students together with hundreds of engineers and technicians, took millions of photographs of particle interactions, developed computer systems to measure and analyze the interactions, and discovered families of new particles and [[resonance (particle physics)|resonance states]].

He also investigated the timing of the gunshots and the shockwave which disturbed the camera, and the speed of the camera, pointing out a number of things which the FBI photo analysts either overlooked or got wrong.

Others continue to study alternative extinction causes such as increased [[volcanism]], particularly the massive [[Deccan Traps]] eruptions that occurred around the same time, and [[climate change]], checking against the [[fossil]] record. However, on March 4, 2010, a panel of 41 scientists agreed that the Chicxulub asteroid impact triggered the mass extinction.<ref name=\"Schulte10\">{{cite journal | last=Schulte | first=P. | year=2010 | title=The Chicxulub Asteroid Impact and Mass Extinction at the Cretaceous- Paleogene Boundary | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=327 | issue=5970 | pages=1214\u20131218 | bibcode=2010Sci...327.1214S | doi=10.1126/science.1177265 | pmid=20203042|display-authors=etal| url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/210367/files/PAL_E4389.pdf }}</ref>\n\n== Aviation ==\nIn his autobiography, Alvarez said, \"I think of myself as having had two separate careers, one in science and one in aviation. I've found the two almost equally rewarding.\" An important contributor to this was his enjoyment of flying. He learned to fly in 1933, later earning [[instrument rating|instrument]] and multi-engine ratings. Over the next 50 years he accumulated over 1000 hours of flight time, most of it as pilot in command.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987|pp=30\u201331}} He said, \"I found few activities as satisfying as being pilot in command with responsibility for my passengers' lives.\"{{sfn|Alvarez|1987|pp=268}}\n\nAlvarez made numerous professional contributions to aviation. During World War II he led the development of multiple aviation-related technologies. Several of his projects are described above, including Ground Controlled Approach (GCA) for which he was awarded the Collier Trophy in 1945. He also held the basic patent for the radar [[transponder]], for which he assigned rights to the U.S. government for $1.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987|pp=30\u201331}}\n\nLater in his career Alvarez served on multiple high level advisory committees related to civilian and military aviation. These included a [[Federal Aviation Administration]] task group on future [[air navigation]] and [[air traffic control]] systems, the [[President's Science Advisory Committee]] Military Aircraft Panel, and a committee studying how the scientific community could help improve the United States' capabilities for fighting a nonnuclear war.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987|pp=218\u2013223}}\n\nAlvarez's aviation responsibilities led to many adventures. For example, while working on GCA he became the first civilian to fly a low approach with his view outside the cockpit obstructed.

In \"[[Boys and Girls (The Office episode)|Boys and Girls]]\", a [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]] branch was mentioned, until [[Jan Levinson|Jan]] shut it down when their warehouse workers unionized. The episode \"[[Turf War (The Office)|Turf War]]\" focuses on the closing of the [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] branch, and how reps from the [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] branch are competing with Scranton employees for Binghamton's old clients.\n\nBusiness writer Megan Barnett has pointed out parallels between Dunder Mifflin and the real-life [[W.B.

It is similarly regional in focus, serving corporate and institutional customers in [[New England]] and the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] states. Like Dunder Mifflin, its original product line ([[rubber stamp]]s) was something other than paper, and it faces stiff competition from national and international chains. It, too, has a branch office in Stamford, but Mason's has remained open. In 2009, it had an accounting scandal that resulted in a $545,000 payment to corporate customers, much as Dunder Mifflin had to deal with the arrest of [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] for fraud the year before.<ref name=\"W.B.

Consider the episode (\"[[Local Ad]]\") where Michael tries to produce an advertisement for Dunder-Mifflin using all the talents of his branch, only to be coldly ignored, to such an extent that we do not even see his effort get rejected. The ad they produce is actually pretty good \u2014 really stupid, obviously, because the guy never realizes what he's saying \u2014 but the concept is good. If \"Corporate\" had supported their efforts, they could in fact have created something effective and earned the goodwill of employees who had cooperated. But power is the only commodity that matters in the corporate hierarchy, more so even than profit. First these little guys in Scranton start thinking for themselves, then what? So you do not get the wrong idea, though, the writers go a step further \u2014 Michael in turn suppresses the creativity of his employees, imposing his (naturally moronic) ideas on them. Bosses are bosses&nbsp;... It is not coincidental that the man who imposes all this on Scott is former temp Ryan Howard, who gets his MBA and leapfrogs everybody to become his boss's boss, despite having never sold a single sheet of paper.}}</ref> The show's depiction of a dysfunctional corporate culture has led some commentators to liken Dunder Mifflin to the software maker Initech in [[Mike Judge]]'s cult comedy ''[[Office Space]]''<ref name=\"Initech comparison\">{{cite news|last=Humphrey|first=Mark|title=Dunder-Mifflin provides my ideal 'Office' setting|url=http://www.dailybruin.ucla.edu/archives/id/39171/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509125831/http://www.dailybruin.ucla.edu/archives/id/39171/|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 9, 2008|publisher=ASUCLA Student Media|work=[[Daily Bruin]]|date=November 27, 2006|accessdate=May 14, 2008|quote=Sure, I loved ''Office Space'', but that was different.

The episode \"[[Turf War (The Office)|Turf War]]\" focuses on the closing of the [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] branch, and how reps from the [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] branch are competing with Scranton employees for Binghamton's old clients.\n\nBusiness writer Megan Barnett has pointed out parallels between Dunder Mifflin and the real-life [[W.B. Mason]] paper company, based near [[Boston]], in [[Brockton, Massachusetts]]. It is similarly regional in focus, serving corporate and institutional customers in [[New England]] and the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] states. Like Dunder Mifflin, its original product line ([[rubber stamp]]s) was something other than paper, and it faces stiff competition from national and international chains. It, too, has a branch office in Stamford, but Mason's has remained open. In 2009, it had an accounting scandal that resulted in a $545,000 payment to corporate customers, much as Dunder Mifflin had to deal with the arrest of [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] for fraud the year before.<ref name=\"W.B.

Corporate headquarters rejects the [[television commercial]] Michael created, as he in turn insisted on his own ideas for the commercial and ignored his employees'. [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]), who began as a [[temporary work|temp]], becomes Michael's new boss because he has an [[Master of Business Administration|M.B.A.]] despite never having sold any paper or paper products. Michael, in turn, treats his own employees the same way.<ref name=\"Ramsin Canon\">{{cite web|last=Canon|first=Ramsin|title=Marx & Michael Scott|url=http://gapersblock.com/detour/marx_michael_scott/|publisher=Gapers Block|date=April 21, 2008|accessdate=May 10, 2008|quote=The power relationship is much more emotionally involving. Consider the episode (\"[[Local Ad]]\") where Michael tries to produce an advertisement for Dunder-Mifflin using all the talents of his branch, only to be coldly ignored, to such an extent that we do not even see his effort get rejected. The ad they produce is actually pretty good \u2014 really stupid, obviously, because the guy never realizes what he's saying \u2014 but the concept is good. If \"Corporate\" had supported their efforts, they could in fact have created something effective and earned the goodwill of employees who had cooperated. But power is the only commodity that matters in the corporate hierarchy, more so even than profit. First these little guys in Scranton start thinking for themselves, then what? So you do not get the wrong idea, though, the writers go a step further \u2014 Michael in turn suppresses the creativity of his employees, imposing his (naturally moronic) ideas on them. Bosses are bosses&nbsp;... It is not coincidental that the man who imposes all this on Scott is former temp Ryan Howard, who gets his MBA and leapfrogs everybody to become his boss's boss, despite having never sold a single sheet of paper.}}</ref> The show's depiction of a dysfunctional corporate culture has led some commentators to liken Dunder Mifflin to the software maker Initech in [[Mike Judge]]'s cult comedy ''[[Office Space]]''<ref name=\"Initech comparison\">{{cite news|last=Humphrey|first=Mark|title=Dunder-Mifflin provides my ideal 'Office' setting|url=http://www.dailybruin.ucla.edu/archives/id/39171/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509125831/http://www.dailybruin.ucla.edu/archives/id/39171/|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 9, 2008|publisher=ASUCLA Student Media|work=[[Daily Bruin]]|date=November 27, 2006|accessdate=May 14, 2008|quote=Sure, I loved ''Office Space'', but that was different.
