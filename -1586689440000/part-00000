It was the second appearance of the [[Dalek]]s and thus the first time an enemy re-appeared.\n\nThe serial is set on the [[Earth]] in the 22nd century, where the Daleks occupy the planet following a meteorite strike and a deadly plague. In the serial, the [[First Doctor]] ([[William Hartnell]]), his granddaughter [[Susan Foreman]] ([[Carole Ann Ford]]), and teachers [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (English actor)|William Russell]]) and [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]] ([[Jacqueline Hill]]) work with a human resistance group to travel to a Bedfordshire mine to stop the Daleks from mining out the Earth's core as part of their plan to pilot the Earth through space.\n\nThis serial marks the final regular appearance of Carole Ann Ford as [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] Susan.\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=June 2018}}\nAfter the [[TARDIS]] materialises, [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] surmises from the surroundings that they have landed in London, only to find it in ruins. It turns out the year is some time after 2164.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=David J. |authorlink1=David J.

Then, due to the decay of the surrounding buildings and grounds, a bridge collapse causes girders to fall across the TARDIS, rendering it inaccessible. Barbara stays with Susan while the Doctor and Ian explore, and the women are taken by a couple of refugees to a nearby shelter in an abandoned [[London Underground|Underground]] station. There they meet resistance members Dortmun (the leader), Carl Tyler, David Campbell, Jenny, Thomson, Baker, and Larry Madison. Dortmun, a paraplegic scientist, has been working on a special type of bomb to destroy the Daleks' outer casings, and he and the others are preparing for an assault on the local Dalek headquarters.\n\nMeanwhile, the Doctor and Ian stumble across a body wearing a strange metal helmet and soon find an army of them as a [[Dalek]] rises from the [[River Thames]]. The Daleks take the Doctor and Ian, along with captured resistance members, including Jack Craddock, onboard their saucer, where they convert attempted escapees into [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Robomen|Robomen]]. Ian does not understand why the Daleks still exist since the travellers saw them defeated on Skaro (in ''[[The Daleks]]''), but the Doctor reminds him that was far in the future. David and Craddock explain that the Daleks invaded Earth in the aftermath of a meteorite bombardment and a \"new kind of plague\" ten years prior, where humanity became divided and Asia, Africa and South America were wiped out. Sensing that the Doctor is highly intelligent, the Daleks leave a device in the cell with the prisoners which the Doctor solves, enabling them to escape. However, the Daleks are laying in wait and recapture them, drugging the Doctor and sending him to be converted into a Roboman. But the Doctor's transfer operation breaks down while Susan, Barbara and the resistance team attack the Dalek force using the explosives created by Dortmun. But the bombs are ineffective against the Daleks, and several resistance members are injured or killed.  David and Susan rescue the Doctor while Barbara gets separated from them and is able to return to the Underground with Jenny to report back to Dortmun. Ian is unable to escape; he and Larry hide beneath a floor grating as the saucer leaves for the Dalek mining operations in Bedfordshire.\n\nBefore leaving London, the Daleks give orders to the Robomen to set firebombs to destroy the city. Hiding from the Robomen, David, Susan and the Doctor see them set up a bomb and leave. The Doctor, still too weak from being drugged, collapses, and David uses some quick thinking to disarm the bomb. He and Susan try to find an escape route through the sewers while the Doctor rests, and they are found by Tyler. After collecting the Doctor, who is starting to feel better, they escape the city and head for the mining operation. David and Susan start falling in love, but keep it a secret from the others. Meanwhile, Dortmun, Jenny and Barbara make their way to an abandoned museum also used by the resistance as a hideout. Dortmun, after leaving his notebook for Barbara to find, confronts the Daleks, sacrificing himself so that the women have a chance to escape. They get an old truck working and crash their way through the Daleks, heading for the mining operations as Barbara is convinced that that is where the Doctor would go. They make it most of the way there before the truck is destroyed by a Dalek saucer.\n\nAt the mine, Ian and Larry escape the saucer and meet workers named Wells and Ashton; the latter is killed by an aggressive creature called a [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens#Slyther|Slyther]], a pet of the [[Dalek variants#Mark II Daleks|Black Dalek]]. The predator then falls from a suspended mine cart that Ian and Larry use to try to get away from it, and down a mineshaft to its death. The Daleks send the mine cart down the shaft before Ian and Larry can climb out.  The Doctor and his party arrive at the cliffs overlooking the mine, and he sends David and Susan on a mission to the far side of the cliffs to interfere with the radio signals the Daleks use to communicate with each other and the Robomen. The Doctor and Tyler begin climbing down into the mine. Barbara and Jenny find a hovel and, seeking shelter, meet two ragged women who are allowed to live on their own because they make clothing for the human slaves at the mine. These women pretend to befriend Barbara and Jenny before reporting them to the Daleks in return for food. The Daleks collect Barbara and Jenny and send them to work in the mine.\n\nAfter Larry is killed by his brother, who has been turned into a Roboman, Ian hides in the mine, eventually finding Wells again, and also seeing Barbara from a distance. Before he can get to her, however, he ends up hiding and being trapped in a capsule filled with explosives. Barbara uses Dortmun's notebook to bluff the Daleks into believing she has information about an imminent uprising and demands to speak with the Black Dalek. When she and Jenny are brought before it, they discover that the Daleks are drilling through the [[Earth]]'s crust so that they can blow out its core with a penetrative explosive capsule and then use a guidance system to pilot the planet around space. As the Daleks set the capsule in position and start the countdown, Ian scrambles the wiring inside the capsule, disarming it. When the shaft opens beneath the capsule, he escapes, but a Dalek cuts the rope he uses and he tumbles halfway down the shaft, stopping at a small access node. Leaving by the node, he jams a cord of wood across the shaft opening, preventing a re-armed explosive capsule from moving further down the shaft. While Barbara creates a diversion spinning a wild story about an uprising involving \"the Boston Tea Party\", \"General Lee's forces\" and \"Hannibal attacking from the Alps\", Jenny tries to corrupt the machine which controls the Robomen and send them new orders. The Daleks catch them and, after rearming the capsule and launching it, trap the two in the control room to be killed in the explosion. The Doctor and Tyler, hiding outside the control room, enter when the Daleks leave and free Barbara and Jenny. Using the Daleks' scanners, they find David and Susan, who destroy the radio beacon, leaving the Robomen adrift and causing a temporary overload within the Daleks, who short circuit. Barbara and the Doctor give new orders to the Robomen to destroy the Daleks, and with the help of the Robomen, Wells and Tyler lead the human slaves in rebellion, destroying the inert Daleks and escaping the mine. Ian reunites with his friends and, before the capsule explodes, they all escape back up the cliffs to rejoin Susan and David. The bomb destroys the Dalek fleet and causes an entirely new phenomenon \u2013 a [[volcano|volcanic eruption]] in England.\n\nBack in London, Wells and Tyler help shift the girders away from the TARDIS. Susan has worn a hole in her shoe and the Doctor talks of mending it for her, but seems preoccupied and sad. Susan is also awkward, and after the Doctor goes back into the ship, she and David walk a short distance away. Declaring his love for her, David begs Susan to stay and marry him, saying he will give her a place to belong and a rooted identity, which earlier she told him she wanted to have someday. Susan agonises and protests that David is making her choose between him and her grandfather. Tearfully she says she must leave, but admits that she loves him. Suddenly, the TARDIS doors slam shut, and the Doctor, with Ian and Barbara at his side, bids Susan an emotional farewell, telling her that although they have always taken care of each other up until now, she is a grown woman and deserves a normal life with David. He promises to return one day, and sets the TARDIS in motion. The blue box disappears, and Susan, stunned, steps where it had been. David says that the Doctor must have known she would not leave him, and so chose to leave her. Taking David's hand, Susan walks away with him, intentionally leaving her TARDIS key behind.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Caroleanneford86.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' is the final regular appearance of Carole Ann Ford's character, Susan.]]\nThis was the very first serial of Doctor Who that made extensive use of location filming, with London being chosen as the primary backdrop. The decision to use London also helped to keep the show within its production budget given that the BBC's Lime Grove studios where Doctor Who was produced were located at nearby [[Shepherd's Bush]]. Location filming took place in various parts of the city including extensive sequences at [[Whitehall]], [[Trafalgar Square]], [[Westminster Bridge]], [[Albert Embankment]] and The [[Royal Albert Hall]], moving on to [[Kensington]] and the Albert Memorial with scenes involving the Dalek roadblock being filmed at [[Wembley]]. These scenes were shot in the early hours of Sunday mornings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://drwhointerviews.wordpress.com/category/jacqueline-hill/|title=Jacqueline Hill|website=Doctor Who Interview Archive}}</ref>  Other location scenes were filmed at the abandoned [[Wood Lane (Central line) tube station]] in West London and river sequences both shot besides the [[River Thames]] at [[St Katharine Docks]] in Wapping and at [[Kew Railway Bridge]]. The mine scenes were the first ''Doctor Who'' scenes to be filmed in a quarry, using the disused John's Hole Quarry at [[Stone, Kent]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1964/11/doctor-who-the-dalek-invasion-of-earth-1964/|title=Kent Film Office The Dalek Invasion of Earth Article}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Dalek Invasion of Earth|url=http://www.doctorwholocations.net/stories/dalekinvasionofearth|publisher=Chuck Foster / News in Time and Space Ltd|accessdate=22 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|people=[[Gary Russell]]|year       =2003|title=Doctor Who \u2013 The Dalek Invasion of Earth|medium=DVD|publisher=BBC|time=6:38 in \"Now and Then\" feature on Disc 2|asin=B00009PBAN|asin-tld=co.uk|quote=This was the first ever quarry to be used in the making of Doctor Who.}}</ref>\n\nThe music was composed and conducted by [[Francis Chagrin]].<ref name=\"DrWho\">{{cite web|url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_k.htm|title=The Dalek Invasion of Earth|work=Dr Who guide|accessdate=2 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Alternative titles===\nWorking titles for this story included ''The Daleks'', ''The Return of the Daleks'' and ''The Invaders''.

Hartnell was injured while filming the battle at the Dalek saucer in episode three, and most of his lines went to David Campbell. According to commentary on the DVD release, the man carrying Hartnell down the saucer's ramp dropped him and he hit his head on a metal camera pedestal. Warwick went on to appear as the First Doctor's robotic double in the later Dalek serial, ''[[The Chase (Doctor Who)|The Chase]]'' (1965).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/dvd-bluray/8434/doctor-who-the-space-museumthe-chase-dvd-review|title=Doctor Who: The Space Museum/The Chase DVD review|website=Den of Geek}}</ref>\n\n[[Nicholas_Smith_(actor)|Nicholas Smith]] appears in his first speaking role in television.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/12039125/Nicholas-Smith-actor-obituary.html|title=Nicholas Smith, actor - obituary|date=8 December 2015|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> He was originally only to have appeared in episode three, but according to Smith on a documentary accompanying the serial's DVD release, he talked the director into letting him lead the miners' revolution in episodes five and six.

Then, due to the decay of the surrounding buildings and grounds, a bridge collapse causes girders to fall across the TARDIS, rendering it inaccessible. Barbara stays with Susan while the Doctor and Ian explore, and the women are taken by a couple of refugees to a nearby shelter in an abandoned [[London Underground|Underground]] station. There they meet resistance members Dortmun (the leader), Carl Tyler, David Campbell, Jenny, Thomson, Baker, and Larry Madison. Dortmun, a paraplegic scientist, has been working on a special type of bomb to destroy the Daleks' outer casings, and he and the others are preparing for an assault on the local Dalek headquarters.\n\nMeanwhile, the Doctor and Ian stumble across a body wearing a strange metal helmet and soon find an army of them as a [[Dalek]] rises from the [[River Thames]]. The Daleks take the Doctor and Ian, along with captured resistance members, including Jack Craddock, onboard their saucer, where they convert attempted escapees into [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Robomen|Robomen]]. Ian does not understand why the Daleks still exist since the travellers saw them defeated on Skaro (in ''[[The Daleks]]''), but the Doctor reminds him that was far in the future. David and Craddock explain that the Daleks invaded Earth in the aftermath of a meteorite bombardment and a \"new kind of plague\" ten years prior, where humanity became divided and Asia, Africa and South America were wiped out. Sensing that the Doctor is highly intelligent, the Daleks leave a device in the cell with the prisoners which the Doctor solves, enabling them to escape. However, the Daleks are laying in wait and recapture them, drugging the Doctor and sending him to be converted into a Roboman. But the Doctor's transfer operation breaks down while Susan, Barbara and the resistance team attack the Dalek force using the explosives created by Dortmun. But the bombs are ineffective against the Daleks, and several resistance members are injured or killed.  David and Susan rescue the Doctor while Barbara gets separated from them and is able to return to the Underground with Jenny to report back to Dortmun. Ian is unable to escape; he and Larry hide beneath a floor grating as the saucer leaves for the Dalek mining operations in Bedfordshire.\n\nBefore leaving London, the Daleks give orders to the Robomen to set firebombs to destroy the city. Hiding from the Robomen, David, Susan and the Doctor see them set up a bomb and leave. The Doctor, still too weak from being drugged, collapses, and David uses some quick thinking to disarm the bomb. He and Susan try to find an escape route through the sewers while the Doctor rests, and they are found by Tyler. After collecting the Doctor, who is starting to feel better, they escape the city and head for the mining operation. David and Susan start falling in love, but keep it a secret from the others. Meanwhile, Dortmun, Jenny and Barbara make their way to an abandoned museum also used by the resistance as a hideout. Dortmun, after leaving his notebook for Barbara to find, confronts the Daleks, sacrificing himself so that the women have a chance to escape. They get an old truck working and crash their way through the Daleks, heading for the mining operations as Barbara is convinced that that is where the Doctor would go. They make it most of the way there before the truck is destroyed by a Dalek saucer.\n\nAt the mine, Ian and Larry escape the saucer and meet workers named Wells and Ashton; the latter is killed by an aggressive creature called a [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens#Slyther|Slyther]], a pet of the [[Dalek variants#Mark II Daleks|Black Dalek]]. The predator then falls from a suspended mine cart that Ian and Larry use to try to get away from it, and down a mineshaft to its death. The Daleks send the mine cart down the shaft before Ian and Larry can climb out, and they are plummeted down in the cart to the mine operations far underground.  The Doctor and his party arrive at the cliffs overlooking the mine, and he sends David and Susan on a mission to the far side of the cliffs to interfere with the radio signals the Daleks use to communicate with each other and the Robomen. The Doctor and Tyler begin climbing down into the mine. Barbara and Jenny find a hovel and, seeking shelter, meet two ragged women who are allowed to live on their own because they make clothing for the human slaves at the mine. These women pretend to befriend Barbara and Jenny before reporting them to the Daleks in return for food. The Daleks collect Barbara and Jenny and send them to work in the mine.\n\nAfter Larry is killed by his brother, who has been turned into a Roboman, Ian hides in the mine, eventually finding Wells again, and also seeing Barbara from a distance. Before he can get to her, however, he ends up hiding and being trapped in a capsule filled with explosives. Barbara uses Dortmun's notebook to bluff the Daleks into believing she has information about an imminent uprising and demands to speak with the Black Dalek. When she and Jenny are brought before it, they discover that the Daleks are drilling through the [[Earth]]'s crust so that they can blow out its core with a penetrative explosive capsule and then use a guidance system to pilot the planet around space. As the Daleks set the capsule in position and start the countdown, Ian scrambles the wiring inside the capsule, disarming it. When the shaft opens beneath the capsule, he escapes, but a Dalek cuts the rope he uses and he tumbles halfway down the shaft, stopping at a small access node. Leaving by the node, he jams a cord of wood across the shaft opening, preventing a re-armed explosive capsule from moving further down the shaft. While Barbara creates a diversion spinning a wild story about an uprising involving \"the Boston Tea Party\", \"General Lee's forces\" and \"Hannibal attacking from the Alps\", Jenny tries to corrupt the machine which controls the Robomen and send them new orders. The Daleks catch them and, after rearming the capsule and launching it, trap the two in the control room to be killed in the explosion. The Doctor and Tyler, hiding outside the control room, enter when the Daleks leave and free Barbara and Jenny. Using the Daleks' scanners, they find David and Susan, who destroy the radio beacon, leaving the Robomen adrift and causing a temporary overload within the Daleks, who short circuit. Barbara and the Doctor give new orders to the Robomen to destroy the Daleks, and with the help of the Robomen, Wells and Tyler lead the human slaves in rebellion, destroying the inert Daleks and escaping the mine. Ian reunites with his friends and, before the capsule explodes, they all escape back up the cliffs to rejoin Susan and David. The bomb destroys the Dalek fleet and causes an entirely new phenomenon \u2013 a [[volcano|volcanic eruption]] in England.\n\nBack in London, Wells and Tyler help shift the girders away from the TARDIS. Susan has worn a hole in her shoe and the Doctor talks of mending it for her, but seems preoccupied and sad. Susan is also awkward, and after the Doctor goes back into the ship, she and David walk a short distance away. Declaring his love for her, David begs Susan to stay and marry him, saying he will give her a place to belong and a rooted identity, which earlier she told him she wanted to have someday. Susan agonises and protests that David is making her choose between him and her grandfather. Tearfully she says she must leave, but admits that she loves him. Suddenly, the TARDIS doors slam shut, and the Doctor, with Ian and Barbara at his side, bids Susan an emotional farewell, telling her that although they have always taken care of each other up until now, she is a grown woman and deserves a normal life with David. He promises to return one day, and sets the TARDIS in motion. The blue box disappears, and Susan, stunned, steps where it had been. David says that the Doctor must have known she would not leave him, and so chose to leave her. Taking David's hand, Susan walks away with him, intentionally leaving her TARDIS key behind.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Caroleanneford86.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' is the final regular appearance of Carole Ann Ford's character, Susan.]]\nThis was the very first serial of Doctor Who that made extensive use of location filming, with London being chosen as the primary backdrop. The decision to use London also helped to keep the show within its production budget given that the BBC's Lime Grove studios where Doctor Who was produced were located at nearby [[Shepherd's Bush]]. Location filming took place in various parts of the city including extensive sequences at [[Whitehall]], [[Trafalgar Square]], [[Westminster Bridge]], [[Albert Embankment]] and The [[Royal Albert Hall]], moving on to [[Kensington]] and the Albert Memorial with scenes involving the Dalek roadblock being filmed at [[Wembley]]. These scenes were shot in the early hours of Sunday mornings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://drwhointerviews.wordpress.com/category/jacqueline-hill/|title=Jacqueline Hill|website=Doctor Who Interview Archive}}</ref>  Other location scenes were filmed at the abandoned [[Wood Lane (Central line) tube station]] in West London and river sequences both shot besides the [[River Thames]] at [[St Katharine Docks]] in Wapping and at [[Kew Railway Bridge]]. The mine scenes were the first ''Doctor Who'' scenes to be filmed in a quarry, using the disused John's Hole Quarry at [[Stone, Kent]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1964/11/doctor-who-the-dalek-invasion-of-earth-1964/|title=Kent Film Office The Dalek Invasion of Earth Article}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Dalek Invasion of Earth|url=http://www.doctorwholocations.net/stories/dalekinvasionofearth|publisher=Chuck Foster / News in Time and Space Ltd|accessdate=22 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|people=[[Gary Russell]]|year       =2003|title=Doctor Who \u2013 The Dalek Invasion of Earth|medium=DVD|publisher=BBC|time=6:38 in \"Now and Then\" feature on Disc 2|asin=B00009PBAN|asin-tld=co.uk|quote=This was the first ever quarry to be used in the making of Doctor Who.}}</ref>\n\nThe music was composed and conducted by [[Francis Chagrin]].<ref name=\"DrWho\">{{cite web|url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_k.htm|title=The Dalek Invasion of Earth|work=Dr Who guide|accessdate=2 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Alternative titles===\nWorking titles for this story included ''The Daleks'', ''The Return of the Daleks'' and ''The Invaders''.

Hartnell was injured while filming the battle at the Dalek saucer in episode three, and most of his lines went to David Campbell. According to commentary on the DVD release, the man carrying Hartnell down the saucer's ramp dropped him and he hit his head on a metal camera pedestal. Warwick went on to appear as the First Doctor's robotic double in the later Dalek serial, ''[[The Chase (Doctor Who)|The Chase]]'' (1965).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/dvd-bluray/8434/doctor-who-the-space-museumthe-chase-dvd-review|title=Doctor Who: The Space Museum/The Chase DVD review|website=Den of Geek}}</ref>\n\n[[Nicholas_Smith_(actor)|Nicholas Smith]] appears in his first speaking role in television.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/12039125/Nicholas-Smith-actor-obituary.html|title=Nicholas Smith, actor - obituary|date=8 December 2015|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> He was originally only to have appeared in episode three, but according to Smith on a documentary accompanying the serial's DVD release, he talked the director into letting him lead the miners' revolution in episodes five and six.

Under the [[Manager (professional wrestling)|management]] of [[Jim Cornette]], he originally teamed with [[Dennis Condrey]] and, later on, with [[Stan Lane]]. He also worked with a number of other tag team partners, including [[Koko B. Ware]], [[Steve Keirn]], and [[Darren Matthews|\"Lord\" Steven Regal]].\n\nIn his career, Eaton wrestled for extended periods of time for various wrestling promotions: Mid-America Wrestling, [[Continental Wrestling Association]], [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]], [[World Class Championship Wrestling]], [[Jim Crockett Promotions]], [[World Championship Wrestling]], and [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]]. He also made brief guest appearances for [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]], [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], and a considerable number of [[Independent circuit|independent]] wrestling promotions over the years.\n\n==Early life==\nGrowing up in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], Eaton was a fan of professional wrestling, especially the NWA Mid-America [[professional wrestling promotion]]. This promotion was operated by [[Nick Gulas]], who staged wrestling shows in the Alabama and Tennessee region.  Eaton's first involvement in the sport came at the age of 13, while attending Chapman Middle School, when he helped set up [[wrestling ring]]s in his hometown.<ref name=interview/> He later trained under [[Tojo Yamamoto]] to become a professional wrestler.<ref name=PWI500-1992/>\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n===NWA Mid-America (1976\u20131980)===\nIn May 1976, at the age of 17, Eaton made his debut in [[NWA Mid-America]]. He entered his first match, a loss to [[Bearcat Wright]], as a last-minute substitute for Wright's absent opponent.<ref name=interview/> He quickly became a regular in Mid-America and continued to train with the more experienced wrestlers. Before long, fans, as well as promoter Nick Gulas, noticed Eaton's athleticism and showmanship.  Gulas decided to \"promote\" Eaton up the ranks of NWA Mid-America, giving him matches later in the show, closer to the main event.<ref name=tagbook/> The [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]] that helped elevate Eaton's name up the [[List of professional wrestling terms#C|card]] in the promotion took place after the introduction of the tag team [[Hollywood Blonds#Buddy Roberts and Jerry Brown|The Hollywood Blonds]] (Jerry Brown and [[Dale Hey|Buddy Roberts]]). Eaton fought the Blonds with a variety of partners, including his old trainer Yamamoto and [[Pez Whatley|\"Pistol\" Pez Whatley]]. When the Blonds decided to move to a different wrestling promotion, the storyline maintained that Eaton was responsible for driving them out of NWA Mid-America.<ref name=tagbook>{{cite book|last=Oliver|first=Greg|author2=Johnson, Steve|title=The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams|publisher=ECW Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-55022-683-6|pages=58\u201362|chapter=The top 20: 10 the Midnight Express}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Eaton teamed with [[Lanny Poffo|Leapin' Lanny Poffo]] (brother of the more well-known \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage), and together they won the [[NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship]] from Gypsy Joe and [[Junkyard Dog|Leroy Rochester]]. It was Eaton's first title win, and he and Poffo held it for a little over a month. Eaton went on to form a team, known as The Jet Set, with George Gulas, Nick Gulas's son.

Although Eaton is now thought of mainly as a heel, his fans were surprised at the time. Eaton's heel run did not last long before he rescued his former Jet Set partner, George Gulas, from a two-on-one attack by [[The Blond Bombers#Larry Latham and Wayne Farris|The Blond Bombers]] ([[Moondog Spot|Larry Latham]] and [[The Honky Tonk Man|Wayne Ferris]]) to return to the fan-favorite side once more.

Before long Eaton returned closer to home, working for promoter [[Jerry Jarrett]]'s [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA), which was centered in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. During his early days in the promotion, Eaton faced [[Stan Lane]] several times in tag team competition. Eaton's most successful partnership in the CWA, in terms of title wins, was with [[Koko B. Ware|Sweet Brown Sugar]], nicknamed \"the New Wave\". The two wrestlers blended their athleticism and high flying abilities to form a very successful team. The New Wave held the [[AWA Southern Tag Team Championship]] three times (twice with manager [[Jimmy Hart]] in their corner).<ref name=titles/> After achieving success as a tag team, it was decided that Eaton and Sugar should split up and feud with each other. This storyline resulted in Eaton \"forcing\" Sugar out of the promotion after he won a [[Professional wrestling match types#Loser Leaves Town match|\"Losers Leaves Town\" match]] against Sugar.<ref name=memphis-10-2>{{cite web|url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/memphis/memphis-cwa10-2.htm|title=Memphis/CWA #10 Page #2|last=Dills|first=Tim|publisher=Kayfabe Memories|accessdate=February 19, 2007}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=February 2019}}\n\nSugar's disappearance was soon followed by the appearance of a masked man called Stagger Lee, who looked and wrestled like Sugar.

Eaton teamed with former rival Dennis Condrey under the management of [[Jim Cornette]] to form a new version of the tag team. The Express had previously been a group of wrestlers consisting of Condrey, [[Randy Rose]] and [[Norvell Austin]], but with Eaton's arrival, the Midnight Express  worked exclusively as a two-man team.<ref name=tagbook/> To complement the nickname \"Lover Boy\" Dennis, Eaton was nicknamed \"Beautiful\" Bobby, a nickname he still uses when wrestling. At first, The Express was booked in an angle with the [[UWF Tag Team Championship|Mid-South Tag Team Champions]] [[Magnum T.A.]] and [[Mr. Wrestling II]]. The highlight of the angle saw Eaton and Condrey [[tarring and feathering]] Magnum T.A. in the middle of the ring.

During the course of their heated angle, Eaton and Condrey re-lost the title to the Rock 'n' Roll Express six months later.<ref name=titles/>  Eaton and Condrey also had long running feuds with [[The New Breed (professional wrestling tag team)|The New Breed]] ([[Christopher Ashford-Smith|Chris Champion]] and [[Sean Royal]]) as well as [[The Road Warriors]] ([[Road Warrior Animal|Animal]] and [[Road Warrior Hawk|Hawk]]). The feud with the Road Warriors included a high-profile [[Professional wrestling match types#Scaffold match|Scaffold match]] at [[Starrcade (1986)|Starrcade 1986]], which the Midnight Express lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/starrcad.html#86|title=Starrcade 1986|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=February 19, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn early 1987, Condrey left JCP for undisclosed reasons, and \"Sweet\" Stan Lane took his place as part of the Midnight Express.<ref name=tagbook/> In May 1987, after teaming for only a few months, Eaton and Lane became champions when they won the [[WCW United States Tag Team Championship|NWA United States Tag team title]] for the first time, a title they would win three times during their time together.<ref name=titles/> A year later the team was cheered on despite being heels, as the Midnight Express won the NWA World Tag Team Title from [[Arn Anderson]] and [[Tully Blanchard]] on September 10, 1988. This feud was cut short when Anderson & Blanchard signed with the WWF over money issues. The Midnight Express' run with the title lasted a little over a month-and-a-half before the Road Warriors took the gold from them in a brutal match up, which saw the heel Road Warriors brutalize the now-popular Midnight Express.<ref name=titles/>\nNow the fan favorites, the Midnight Express had to contend with a team thought to be disbanded forever: the Original Midnight Express, which consisted of Condrey and Randy Rose, who joined JCP after a brief run in the [[American Wrestling Association|AWA]]. The duo was led by long-time Jim Cornette nemesis [[Paul Heyman|Paul E. Dangerously]], in a storyline that saw them trying to prove the originals were better than the new version. The surprise appearance of the Original Midnight Express gave Dangerously's team the initial momentum in the feud, but soon after, Condrey left the promotion once more. This forced the bookers to bring in [[Jack Victory]] as a replacement as Condrey's disappearance cut the promising feud short.<ref name=tagbook/>\n\nThe Midnight Express then turned their attention to Paul E.'s new team, The [[Headshrinkers|Samoan S.W.A.T. Team]] as well as a new version of [[The Fabulous Freebirds]]. Eaton and Lane were defeated by the Freebirds in the finals of a tournament for the vacated World Tag Team Titles. Following this loss, the Midnight Express teamed with their former enemies The Road Warriors and [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams]] to defeat the SST and the Freebirds in a [[WarGames match]] at [[The Great American Bash (1987)|The Great American Bash]]. Following this feud, Lane and Eaton began having issues with a young new team in the NWA known as \"the Dynamic Dudes\" ([[Shane Douglas]] and [[John Laurinaitis|Johnny Ace]]). The Dudes admitted that the Midnight Express was one of their favorite teams and asked if Cornette would be their manager as well. Cornette agreed to manage the young team, to the displeasure of the Midnight Express. After arguing with the Express, Jim Cornette stopped accompanying Eaton and Lane to the ring, choosing to only actively manage the Dudes. At [[Clash of Champions IX]], the two teams met with Jim Cornette appearing in a neutral corner, forced to choose between the teams. The Express started out very aggressively, especially for a team that was supposed to be fan favorites, and when the night was over, the Midnight Express had once again established themselves as heels with Jim Cornette in their corner; Cornette had never stopped siding with the Express.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash.html#IX|title=Clash of the Champions IX|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=February 19, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623095650/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash.html#IX|archivedate=June 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nAfter returning to their cheating ways, the Midnight Express started a storyline with the up-and-coming team of [[Brian Pillman|Flyin' Brian]] and [[Tom Zenk|\"Z-Man\" Tom Zenk]] over the United States Tag team title.

Dangerously formed the [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|faction]] [[Dangerous Alliance|The Dangerous Alliance]]. Eaton joined the group when he assisted [[Rick Rude]], with the storyline being that Dangerously had brought Rude to WCW, in defeating [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] for the United States Championship. In joining the group, Eaton became allies with Rude, [[Larry Zbyszko]], and his two former rivals for the World Television Championship in Arn Anderson and Steve Austin. Shortly after the group was formed, Anderson and Eaton became its tag team specialists. This seemed to make sense, as both men had been successful tag team wrestlers in their careers; Anderson himself had been a two-time world champion teaming with Tully Blanchard in the [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]] and had also won the belts with Zbyszko earlier in the year.<ref name=tagbook/> Eaton and Anderson quickly won the WCW World Tag Team Championship by defeating [[Ricky Steamboat]] and [[Dustin Rhodes]], the team to whom Anderson and Zbyszko lost the belts, for the championship and held on to the belts for five months before they lost them to the Steiner Brothers.<ref name=titles/>\nThe Dangerous Alliance was a dominant force in WCW. At one point during 1992, they held every title except the WCW World Title, which was held by their main opponent and arch enemy [[Steve Borden|Sting]]. The war between the Dangerous Alliance and Sting and friends escalated until it was decided to settle it in a double-ring War Games match at [[WrestleWar (1992)|WrestleWar 1992]]. Sting's team won when Sting forced Eaton to give up after Larry Zbyszko accidentally struck Eaton in the arm with a metal rod.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/w-war.html#92|title= WrestleWar 1992|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=February 19, 2007}}</ref> This match would be given a [[Dave Meltzer#Rating system|5-star rating]] from [[Dave Meltzer]] of the ''Wrestling Observer Newsletter''.<ref name=1992FiveStar>{{cite web | url=http://www.profightdb.com/top-rated-matches.html?pg=1&year=1992 | title=Top Rated matches of 1992 | work=The Internet Wrestling Database | accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the War Games match, Zbyszko was kicked out of the Alliance for causing the Alliance loss. Soon after the Alliance disintegrated, Paul E. Dangerously left WCW. Eaton and Anderson continued to team after the Alliance fell apart, now managed by Michael Hayes. Eaton and Anderson worked in the tag team division until new WCW booker Bill Watts fired Eaton along with a number of other WCW regulars in a cost-cutting measure.<ref name=interview/>\n\n===Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1993)===\nWhen Eaton found himself without a job, he reached out to former manager Jim Cornette. Cornette had started his own wrestling federation, [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] (SMW) and welcomed Eaton with open arms. Eaton joined up with \"[[The Heavenly Bodies]]\" (Stan Lane and [[Tom Prichard]]), and the three were booked as the top heels of the federation for a while. Eaton also won the federation's version of the TV title, known as the [[SMW Beat the Champ Television Championship]].<ref name=titles/>\n\n===New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1993\u20131995)===\nEaton first toured through Japan with [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] in May 1993 during their ''Explosion Tour'', teaming with [[Tony Halme]] and in various tag team matches, facing teams such as [[Hiroshi Hase]] and [[Keiji Mutoh]], [[Manabu Nakanishi]] and [[Masa Saito]], [[Shinya Hashimoto]] and [[Michiyoshi Ohara]], [[Riki Choshu]] and [[Takashi Iizuka|Takayuki Iizuka]] and even [[Road Warrior Hawk|Hawk Warrior]] and [[Kensuke Sasaki|Power Warrior]], known as the Hellraisers, with the latter putting their [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]]s on the line on June 14, in which Eaton and Halme lost. In January 1994, Eaton went back to Japan during their ''Fighting Spirit'' tour, wrestling only in tag team matches (with the exception of a singles match against [[Black Cat (wrestler)|Black Cat]] and another against Power Warrior) teaming with [[Luc Poirier|Rambo]] and [[Mike Enos]]. In November 1995 during their ''NJPW/WCW World in Japan'' tour, Eaton, now under the \"Earl Robert Eaton\" character, toured with New Japan for the last time, wrestling only two tag team matches in two days, teaming with [[Marc Mero|Johnny B. Badd]] (the announcers mistakingly and constantly referred him as Bobby instead of Robert) in a losing effort against the [[Cho-Ten|Ookami Gundan]] ([[Masahiro Chono]] and [[Hiroyoshi Tenzan]]) and another losing effort alongside [[William Regal|Lord Steven Regal]] against [[Kensuke Sasaki]] and [[Osamu Nishimura]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cagematch.net//?id=2&nr=1101&view=&page=4&gimmick=&year=&promotion=7\u00aeion=&location=&arena=&showtype=&constellationType=&worker= | title=Bobby Eaton >> Matches >> New Japan Pro-Wrestling | work=CageMatch | accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Return to WCW===\n====Tag teams and singles appearances (1993\u20131995)====\nWhen Bill Watts was ousted from his position in WCW in favor of [[Eric Bischoff]] in 1993, Eaton was rehired.

During this time, Eaton also made a couple of appearances in ECW due to a talent trade arrangement between WCW and ECW.

Under the [[Manager (professional wrestling)|management]] of [[Jim Cornette]], he originally teamed with [[Dennis Condrey]] and, later on, with [[Stan Lane]]. He also worked with a number of other tag team partners, including [[Koko B. Ware]], [[Steve Keirn]], and [[Darren Matthews|\"Lord\" Steven Regal]].\n\nIn his career, Eaton wrestled for extended periods of time for various wrestling promotions: Mid-America Wrestling, [[Continental Wrestling Association]], [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]], [[World Class Championship Wrestling]], [[Jim Crockett Promotions]], [[World Championship Wrestling]], and [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]]. He also made brief guest appearances for [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]], [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], and a considerable number of [[Independent circuit|independent]] wrestling promotions over the years.\n\n==Early life==\nGrowing up in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], Eaton was a fan of professional wrestling, especially the NWA Mid-America [[professional wrestling promotion]]. This promotion was operated by [[Nick Gulas]], who staged wrestling shows in the Alabama and Tennessee region.  Eaton's first involvement in the sport came at the age of 13, while attending Chapman Middle School, when he helped set up [[wrestling ring]]s in his hometown.<ref name=interview/> He later trained under [[Tojo Yamamoto]] to become a professional wrestler.<ref name=PWI500-1992/>\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n===NWA Mid-America (1976\u20131980)===\nIn May 1976, at the age of 17, Eaton made his debut in [[NWA Mid-America]]. He entered his first match, a loss to [[Bearcat Wright]], as a last-minute substitute for Wright's absent opponent.<ref name=interview/> He quickly became a regular in Mid-America and continued to train with the more experienced wrestlers. Before long, fans, as well as promoter Nick Gulas, noticed Eaton's athleticism and showmanship.  Gulas decided to \"promote\" Eaton up the ranks of NWA Mid-America, giving him matches later in the show, closer to the main event.<ref name=tagbook/> The [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]] that helped elevate Eaton's name up the [[List of professional wrestling terms#C|card]] in the promotion took place after the introduction of the tag team [[Hollywood Blonds#Buddy Roberts and Jerry Brown|The Hollywood Blonds]] (Jerry Brown and [[Dale Hey|Buddy Roberts]]). Eaton fought the Blonds with a variety of partners, including his old trainer Yamamoto and [[Pez Whatley|\"Pistol\" Pez Whatley]]. When the Blonds decided to move to a different wrestling promotion, the storyline maintained that Eaton was responsible for driving them out of NWA Mid-America.<ref name=tagbook>{{cite book|last=Oliver|first=Greg|author2=Johnson, Steve|title=The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams|publisher=ECW Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-55022-683-6|pages=58\u201362|chapter=The top 20: 10 the Midnight Express}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Eaton teamed with [[Lanny Poffo|Leapin' Lanny Poffo]] (brother of the more well-known \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage), and together they won the [[NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship]] from Gypsy Joe and [[Junkyard Dog|Leroy Rochester]]. It was Eaton's first title win, and he and Poffo held it for a little over a month. Eaton went on to form a team, known as The Jet Set, with George Gulas, Nick Gulas's son.

Although Eaton is now thought of mainly as a heel, his fans were surprised at the time. Eaton's heel run did not last long before he rescued his former Jet Set partner, George Gulas, from a two-on-one attack by [[The Blond Bombers#Larry Latham and Wayne Farris|The Blond Bombers]] ([[Moondog Spot|Larry Latham]] and [[The Honky Tonk Man|Wayne Ferris]]) to return to the fan-favorite side once more.

Before long Eaton returned closer to home, working for promoter [[Jerry Jarrett]]'s [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA), which was centered in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. During his early days in the promotion, Eaton faced [[Stan Lane]] several times in tag team competition. Eaton's most successful partnership in the CWA, in terms of title wins, was with [[Koko B. Ware|Sweet Brown Sugar]], nicknamed \"the New Wave\". The two wrestlers blended their athleticism and high flying abilities to form a very successful team. The New Wave held the [[AWA Southern Tag Team Championship]] three times (twice with manager [[Jimmy Hart]] in their corner).<ref name=titles/> After achieving success as a tag team, it was decided that Eaton and Sugar should split up and feud with each other. This storyline resulted in Eaton \"forcing\" Sugar out of the promotion after he won a [[Professional wrestling match types#Loser Leaves Town match|\"Losers Leaves Town\" match]] against Sugar.<ref name=memphis-10-2>{{cite web|url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/memphis/memphis-cwa10-2.htm|title=Memphis/CWA #10 Page #2|last=Dills|first=Tim|publisher=Kayfabe Memories|accessdate=February 19, 2007}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=February 2019}}\n\nSugar's disappearance was soon followed by the appearance of a masked man called Stagger Lee, who looked and wrestled like Sugar.

Eaton teamed with former rival Dennis Condrey under the management of [[Jim Cornette]] to form a new version of the tag team. The Express had previously been a group of wrestlers consisting of Condrey, [[Randy Rose]] and [[Norvell Austin]], but with Eaton's arrival, the Midnight Express  worked exclusively as a two-man team.<ref name=tagbook/> To complement the nickname \"Lover Boy\" Dennis, Eaton was nicknamed \"Beautiful\" Bobby, a nickname he still uses when wrestling. At first, The Express was booked in an angle with the [[UWF Tag Team Championship|Mid-South Tag Team Champions]] [[Magnum T.A.]] and [[Mr. Wrestling II]]. The highlight of the angle saw Eaton and Condrey [[tarring and feathering]] Magnum T.A. in the middle of the ring. The Express first won the tag team title when Mr. Wrestling II turned on Magnum T.A., attacking him during the title match and allowing Eaton and Condrey to win the title without much opposition.<ref name=titles/>\n\nWith Mr. Wrestling II and Magnum T.A. splitting up, the Midnight Express needed a new team to defend their newly won title against. They began a long series of matches against [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]] ([[Ricky Morton]] and [[Reuben Kane|Robert Gibson]]) which ran well into the 1990s and spanned several wrestling promotions.<ref name=tagbook/> The two teams feuded throughout 1984 in Mid-South Wrestling before the Midnight Express left the promotion.

During the course of their heated angle, Eaton and Condrey re-lost the title to the Rock 'n' Roll Express six months later.<ref name=titles/>  Eaton and Condrey also had long running feuds with [[The New Breed (professional wrestling tag team)|The New Breed]] ([[Christopher Ashford-Smith|Chris Champion]] and [[Sean Royal]]) as well as [[The Road Warriors]] ([[Road Warrior Animal|Animal]] and [[Road Warrior Hawk|Hawk]]). The feud with the Road Warriors included a high-profile [[Professional wrestling match types#Scaffold match|Scaffold match]] at [[Starrcade (1986)|Starrcade 1986]], which the Midnight Express lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/starrcad.html#86|title=Starrcade 1986|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=February 19, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn early 1987, Condrey left JCP for undisclosed reasons, and \"Sweet\" Stan Lane took his place as part of the Midnight Express.<ref name=tagbook/> In May 1987, after teaming for only a few months, Eaton and Lane became champions when they won the [[WCW United States Tag Team Championship|NWA United States Tag team title]] for the first time, a title they would win three times during their time together.<ref name=titles/> A year later the team was cheered on despite being heels, as the Midnight Express won the NWA World Tag Team Title from [[Arn Anderson]] and [[Tully Blanchard]] on September 10, 1988. This feud was cut short when Anderson & Blanchard signed with the WWF over money issues. The Midnight Express' run with the title lasted a little over a month-and-a-half before the Road Warriors took the gold from them in a brutal match up, which saw the heel Road Warriors brutalize the now-popular Midnight Express.<ref name=titles/>\nNow the fan favorites, the Midnight Express had to contend with a team thought to be disbanded forever: the Original Midnight Express, which consisted of Condrey and Randy Rose, who joined JCP after a brief run in the [[American Wrestling Association|AWA]]. The duo was led by long-time Jim Cornette nemesis [[Paul Heyman|Paul E. Dangerously]], in a storyline that saw them trying to prove the originals were better than the new version. The surprise appearance of the Original Midnight Express gave Dangerously's team the initial momentum in the feud, but soon after, Condrey left the promotion once more. This forced the bookers to bring in [[Jack Victory]] as a replacement as Condrey's disappearance cut the promising feud short.<ref name=tagbook/>\n\nThe Midnight Express then turned their attention to Paul E.'s new team, The [[Headshrinkers|Samoan S.W.A.T. Team]] as well as a new version of [[The Fabulous Freebirds]]. Eaton and Lane were defeated by the Freebirds in the finals of a tournament for the vacated World Tag Team Titles. Following this loss, the Midnight Express teamed with their former enemies The Road Warriors and [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams]] to defeat the SST and the Freebirds in a [[WarGames match]] at [[The Great American Bash (1987)|The Great American Bash]]. Following this feud, Lane and Eaton began having issues with a young new team in the NWA known as \"the Dynamic Dudes\" ([[Shane Douglas]] and [[John Laurinaitis|Johnny Ace]]). The Dudes admitted that the Midnight Express was one of their favorite teams and asked if Cornette would be their manager as well. Cornette agreed to manage the young team, to the displeasure of the Midnight Express. After arguing with the Express, Jim Cornette stopped accompanying Eaton and Lane to the ring, choosing to only actively manage the Dudes. At [[Clash of Champions IX]], the two teams met with Jim Cornette appearing in a neutral corner, forced to choose between the teams. The Express started out very aggressively, especially for a team that was supposed to be fan favorites, and when the night was over, the Midnight Express had once again established themselves as heels with Jim Cornette in their corner; Cornette had never stopped siding with the Express.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash.html#IX|title=Clash of the Champions IX|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=February 19, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623095650/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash.html#IX|archivedate=June 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nAfter returning to their cheating ways, the Midnight Express started a storyline with the up-and-coming team of [[Brian Pillman|Flyin' Brian]] and [[Tom Zenk|\"Z-Man\" Tom Zenk]] over the United States Tag team title. The Express won the title from the young team in early 1990, but lost the belts to [[The Steiner Brothers]] ([[Rick Steiner|Rick]] and [[Scott Steiner|Scott]]) three months later.<ref name=titles/> After a loss at the WCW pay-per-view [[Halloween Havoc (1990)|Halloween Havoc 1990]], the Midnight Express split up, as Jim Cornette and Stan Lane left the federation, while Eaton chose to remain in WCW.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/havoc.html#90|title=Halloween Havoc 1990|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=February 19, 2007}}</ref> For the first time in almost a decade, there was no Midnight Express.<ref name=tagbook/>\n\n====World Television Champion (1991)====\nFor the first time since 1979, Eaton was a singles competitor, and he faced an uphill struggle to establish himself. He wrestled his former opponents in tag team competition such as Brad Armstrong (whom he defeated at [[WrestleWar (1991)|WrestleWar '91]]), Ricky Morton and \"Z-Man\" Tom Zenk (whom he defeated at [[Starrcade (1990)|Starrcade '90]], but lost to at [[Clash of the Champions XIV]]), but it was not until he turned face during the early parts of 1991 that he started to move up the rankings. Per a [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]] report, Eaton signed a two-year contract worth $170,000 a year in January 1991.<ref name=211991WON>{{cite web|url=https://members.f4wonline.com/wrestling-observer-newsletter/january-21-1991-wrestling-observer-newsletter-ric-flair-defeats-sting|title=January 21, 1991 Wrestling Observer Newsletter: Ric Flair defeats Sting for his 7th World title win, more|author=Observer Staff|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|website=F4WOnline.com|date=January 21, 1991|accessdate=September 4, 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref> At [[SuperBrawl I]], Eaton defeated Arn Anderson to win the [[WCW World Television Championship|World Television Championship]].<ref name=titles/> Eaton's highest profile match as a singles wrestler came when he faced off against the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Ric Flair|\"Nature Boy\" Ric Flair]] at [[Clash of the Champions XV]] in a [[Two out of three falls match|two-out-of-three falls match]].

Dangerously formed the [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|faction]] [[Dangerous Alliance|The Dangerous Alliance]]. Eaton joined the group when he assisted [[Rick Rude]], with the storyline being that Dangerously had brought Rude to WCW, in defeating [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] for the United States Championship. In joining the group, Eaton became allies with Rude, [[Larry Zbyszko]], and his two former rivals for the World Television Championship in Arn Anderson and Steve Austin. Shortly after the group was formed, Anderson and Eaton became its tag team specialists. This seemed to make sense, as both men had been successful tag team wrestlers in their careers; Anderson himself had been a two-time world champion teaming with Tully Blanchard in the [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]] and had also won the belts with Zbyszko earlier in the year.<ref name=tagbook/> Eaton and Anderson quickly won the WCW World Tag Team Championship by defeating [[Ricky Steamboat]] and [[Dustin Rhodes]], the team to whom Anderson and Zbyszko lost the belts, for the championship and held on to the belts for five months before they lost them to the Steiner Brothers.<ref name=titles/>\nThe Dangerous Alliance was a dominant force in WCW. At one point during 1992, they held every title except the WCW World Title, which was held by their main opponent and arch enemy [[Steve Borden|Sting]]. The war between the Dangerous Alliance and Sting and friends escalated until it was decided to settle it in a double-ring War Games match at [[WrestleWar (1992)|WrestleWar 1992]]. Sting's team won when Sting forced Eaton to give up after Larry Zbyszko accidentally struck Eaton in the arm with a metal rod.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/w-war.html#92|title= WrestleWar 1992|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=February 19, 2007}}</ref> This match would be given a [[Dave Meltzer#Rating system|5-star rating]] from [[Dave Meltzer]] of the ''Wrestling Observer Newsletter''.<ref name=1992FiveStar>{{cite web | url=http://www.profightdb.com/top-rated-matches.html?pg=1&year=1992 | title=Top Rated matches of 1992 | work=The Internet Wrestling Database | accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the War Games match, Zbyszko was kicked out of the Alliance for causing the Alliance loss. Soon after the Alliance disintegrated, Paul E. Dangerously left WCW. Eaton and Anderson continued to team after the Alliance fell apart, now managed by Michael Hayes. Eaton and Anderson worked in the tag team division until new WCW booker Bill Watts fired Eaton along with a number of other WCW regulars in a cost-cutting measure.<ref name=interview/>\n\n===Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1993)===\nWhen Eaton found himself without a job, he reached out to former manager Jim Cornette. Cornette had started his own wrestling federation, [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] (SMW) and welcomed Eaton with open arms. Eaton joined up with \"[[The Heavenly Bodies]]\" (Stan Lane and [[Tom Prichard]]), and the three were booked as the top heels of the federation for a while. Eaton also won the federation's version of the TV title, known as the [[SMW Beat the Champ Television Championship]].<ref name=titles/>\n\n===New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1993\u20131995)===\nEaton first toured through Japan with [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] in May 1993 during their ''Explosion Tour'', teaming with [[Tony Halme]] and in various tag team matches, facing teams such as [[Hiroshi Hase]] and [[Keiji Mutoh]], [[Manabu Nakanishi]] and [[Masa Saito]], [[Shinya Hashimoto]] and [[Michiyoshi Ohara]], [[Riki Choshu]] and [[Takashi Iizuka|Takayuki Iizuka]] and even [[Road Warrior Hawk|Hawk Warrior]] and [[Kensuke Sasaki|Power Warrior]], known as the Hellraisers, with the latter putting their [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]]s on the line on June 14, in which Eaton and Halme lost. In January 1994, Eaton went back to Japan during their ''Fighting Spirit'' tour, wrestling only in tag team matches (with the exception of a singles match against [[Black Cat (wrestler)|Black Cat]] and another against Power Warrior) teaming with [[Luc Poirier|Rambo]] and [[Mike Enos]]. In November 1995 during their ''NJPW/WCW World in Japan'' tour, Eaton, now under the \"Earl Robert Eaton\" character, toured with New Japan for the last time, wrestling only two tag team matches in two days, teaming with [[Marc Mero|Johnny B. Badd]] (the announcers mistakingly and constantly referred him as Bobby instead of Robert) in a losing effort against the [[Cho-Ten|Ookami Gundan]] ([[Masahiro Chono]] and [[Hiroyoshi Tenzan]]) and another losing effort alongside [[William Regal|Lord Steven Regal]] against [[Kensuke Sasaki]] and [[Osamu Nishimura]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cagematch.net//?id=2&nr=1101&view=&page=4&gimmick=&year=&promotion=7\u00aeion=&location=&arena=&showtype=&constellationType=&worker= | title=Bobby Eaton >> Matches >> New Japan Pro-Wrestling | work=CageMatch | accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Return to WCW===\n====Tag teams and singles appearances (1993\u20131995)====\nWhen Bill Watts was ousted from his position in WCW in favor of [[Eric Bischoff]] in 1993, Eaton was rehired. Once back on the roster, Eaton teamed up with a young [[Chris Benoit]] in Benoit's first stint with WCW. Together they were mainly used to help establish rising teams or give established teams opposition.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cagematch.net//?id=2&nr=574&view=&page=4&gimmick=&year=1993&promotion=2region=&location=&arena=&showtype=&constellationType=&worker= | title=Chris Benoit >> Matches >> World Championship Wrestling >> 1993 | work=CageMatch | accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref> After Benoit left to return to Japan, in Eaton's next venture in tag teaming, under the name \"Bad Attitude\", he teamed up with Steve Keirn, formerly of the Fabulous Ones. Bad Attitude's single noteworthy moment together came when they were present as Arn Anderson turned on tag team partner Dustin Rhodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw94.htm|title=WCW 1994|publisher=The History of WWE|accessdate=February 19, 2007}}</ref> Otherwise, the team did not get much exposure. During this time, Eaton also made a couple of appearances in ECW due to a talent trade arrangement between WCW and ECW. His most well-known appearance was at the \"When Worlds Collide\" show on May 14, 1994, where he teamed with [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] to beat Arn Anderson and [[Terry Funk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1994b.html#051494|title=When Worlds Collide|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=February 19, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n====The Blue Bloods (1995\u20131996)====\n{{Main|The Blue Bloods}}\nAfter Bad Attitude quietly ended, Eaton was placed with British snob [[Darren Matthews|\"Lord\" Steven Regal]]. A series of [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignettes]] followed, in which Regal educated Eaton on how to be a man of class and sophistication.<ref name=interview/> The Blue Bloods initially feuded with [[the Nasty Boys]] ([[Brian Knobs]] and [[Jerry Sags]]), their complete opposites in terms of \"sophistication\" and presentation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/gabash.html#95|title=The Great American Bash 1995|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=February 19, 2007}}</ref><ref name=BATB>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/beach.html#95|title=Bash at the Beach 1995|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=February 19, 2007}}</ref> They also feuded with Harlem Heat ([[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] and [[Stevie Ray]]) over the World Tag Team Championship, but never took the belts,<ref name=BATB/> and engaged in a short \"Snobs versus Rednecks\" program with [[Stud Stable|the Stud Stable]] ([[Jimmy Golden|Bunkhouse Buck]] and [[Dick Slater]]). In all of 1996 the team members made only one [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) appearance, as individuals in the \"Lethal Lottery\" during May's [[Slamboree (1996)|Slamboree]]. Later that year, Regal won the World Television Championship. Not long after, Eaton was moved out of the group, [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turning on]] his partners, wrestling Regal for the television championship on two occasions.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cagematch.net//?id=2&nr=1101&view=&page=4&gimmick=&year=1996&promotion=2\u00aeion=&location=&arena=&showtype=&constellationType=&worker= | title=Bobby Eaton >> Matches >> World Championship Wrestling >> | work=CageMatch | accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Final years and departure (1996\u20132000)====\nThe Blue Bloods storyline represented the last serious [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] that Eaton was given by the WCW booking team. After the run with Regal and Taylor ended, Eaton wrestled mainly on WCW's weekend show, ''Saturday Night'', occasionally winning against wrestlers low in the rankings and losing to wrestlers above him.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cagematch.net//?id=2&nr=1101&view=&page=4&gimmick=&year=&promotion=2\u00aeion=&location=&arena=&showtype=&constellationType=&worker=  | title=Bobby Eaton >> Matches >> World Championship Wrestling | work=CageMatch | accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Independent circuit (2000\u20132012)===\nIn 2003, Eaton worked for NWA Mid-Atlantic, forming a new version of the Midnight Express with Ricky Nelson. This Midnight Express version was very short-lived, and Eaton instead began touring with Dennis Condrey (and sometimes Stan Lane) as the Midnight Express. This version of the Midnight Express performed together on select independent wrestling cards in the United States until 2012 when Eaton worked his last match.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cagematch.net//?id=2&nr=1101&page=4 | title=Bobby Eaton >> Matches | accessdate=February 16, 2019 | work=CageMatch}}</ref>\n\nEaton made a one night only appearance for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) on August 13, 2003, as a part of a [[Kid Kash]] storyline where Kash faced off against a series of 1980s wrestling stars such as Larry Zbyszko and Ricky Morton.

In his 1999 book ''[[Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|Have a Nice Day]]'', Mick Foley praised Eaton as being one of the most underrated superstars in the business, and its nicest, commenting that \"it was damn near impossible to pay for anything with Bobby around, though I will confess to not trying that hard\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Foley |first=Mick |authorlink=Mick Foley |title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks |publisher=Regan Books |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-06-039299-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/mankindhaveniced00fole }}</ref> His generosity was not limited to picking up tabs, either: Jim Cornette and [[Sean Waltman]] have noted that Eaton would regularly travel with an extra suitcase filled with toiletries, socks, and other oft-forgotten items that he would give to anyone who needed them.
