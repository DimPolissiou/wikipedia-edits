Twenty Navajo chiefs asked for peace. In 1804 and 1805 the Navajo and Spanish mounted major expeditions against each other's settlements. In May 1805 another peace was established.

On November 21, 1846, following an invitation from a small party of American soldiers under the command of Captain John Reid, who journeyed deep into Navajo country and contacted him, [[Narbona]] and other Navajo negotiated [[Bear Springs Treaty|a treaty of peace]] with Colonel [[Alexander William Doniphan|Alexander Doniphan]] at Bear Springs, Ojo del Oso (later the site of [[Fort Wingate]]). This agreement was not honored by some Navajo, nor by some New Mexicans. The Navajo raided New Mexican livestock, and New Mexicans took women, children, and livestock from the Navajo.<ref>Pages 133 to 140 and 152 to 154, Sides, ''Blood and Thunder''</ref>\n\nIn 1849, the military governor of New Mexico, Colonel [[John M. Washington|John MacRae Washington]]\u2014accompanied by John S. Calhoun, an Indian agent\u2014led a force of 400 soldiers into Navajo country, penetrating [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]]. He signed a treaty with two Navajo leaders: Mariano Martinez as Head Chief and Chapitone as Second Chief. The treaty acknowledged the transfer of jurisdiction from the United Mexican States to the United States. The treaty allowed forts and trading posts to be built on Navajo land. The United States, on its part, promised \"such donations [and] such other liberal and humane measures, as [it] may deem meet and proper.\"<ref>{{USStat|9|974}}</ref> While en route to this treaty signing, Narbona, a prominent Navajo peace leader, was killed, resulting in hostility between the treaty parties.<ref>[[James H.

Military records cite this development as a precautionary measure to protect citizens and the Navajo from each other. However, the Spanish/Mexican-Navajo pattern of raids and expeditions continued. Over 400 New Mexican militia conducted a campaign against the Navajo, against the wishes of the Territorial Governor, in 1860\u201361. They killed Navajo warriors, captured women and children for slaves, and destroyed crops and dwellings. The Navajo call this period ''Naahondzood'', \"the fearing time.\"\n\nIn 1861, Brigadier-General [[James Henry Carleton|James H. Carleton]], Commander of the Federal District of New Mexico, initiated a series of military actions against the Navajo and Apache. Colonel [[Kit Carson]]  was at the new [[Fort Wingate]] with Army troops and volunteer New Mexico militia.  Carleton ordered Carson to kill [[Mescalero]] Apache men and destroy any Mescalero property he could find. Carleton believed these harsh tactics would bring any Indian Tribe under control. The Mescalero surrendered and were sent to the new reservation called [[Bosque Redondo]].\n\nIn the summer of 1863, Carleton ordered Carson to use the same tactics on the Navajo. Carson and his force swept through Navajo land, killing Navajo and destroying crops and dwellings, fouling wells, and capturing livestock. Facing starvation and death, Navajo groups came in to [[Fort Defiance, Arizona|Fort Defiance]] for relief. On July 20, 1863, the first of many groups departed to join the Mescalero at Bosque Redondo.

The internment at Bosque Redondo was disastrous for the Navajo, as the government failed to provide an adequate supply of water, wood, provisions, and livestock for the 4,000\u20135,000 people. Large-scale crop failure and disease were also endemic during this time, as were raids by other tribes and civilians. Some Navajo froze during the winter because they could make only poor shelters from the few materials and resources they were given. This period is known among the Navajo as \"The Fearing Time\".<ref>George Bornstein, \"The Fearing Time: Telling the tales of Indian slavery in American history\", ''Times Literary Supplement'', 20 October 2017 p. 29 (review of Andr\u00e9s Res\u00e9ndez, ''The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, {{ISBN|9780547640983}}).</ref> In addition, a small group of [[Mescalero|Mescalero Apache]], longtime enemies of the Navajos had been relocated to the area. Conflicts resulted.\n\nIn 1868, the [[Treaty of Bosque Redondo]] was negotiated between Navajo leaders and the federal government allowing the surviving Navajo to return to a [[Native American reservation|reservation]] on a portion of their former homeland.\n\n===Reservation era===\n\n[[File:Navajo woman & child.jpg|thumb|200px|Navajo woman and child, ''circa'' 1880\u20131910]]\nThe United States military continued to maintain forts on the Navajo reservation in the years following the Long Walk. Between 1873 and 1895, the military employed Navajo as [[Navajo Scouts|\"Indian Scouts\"]] at Fort Wingate to assist their regular units.<ref>Marei Bouknight and others, ''Guide to Records in the Military Archives Division Pertaining to Indian-White Relations,'' GSA National Archives, 1972</ref> During this period, Chief [[Manuelito]] founded the [[Navajo Tribal Police]]. It operated between 1872 and 1875 as an anti-raid task force working to maintain the peaceful terms of the 1868 Navajo treaty.\n\nBy treaty, the Navajo were allowed to leave the reservation for trade, with permission from the military or local [[Indian agent]]. Eventually, the arrangement led to a gradual end in Navajo raids, as the tribe was able to increase the size of their livestock herds and cultivated crops. In addition, the tribe gained an increase in the size of the Navajo reservation from 3.5 million acres ({{convert|14,000|km\u00b2|mi2|abbr=on}}) to the 16 million acres ({{convert|65,000|km\u00b2|mi2|abbr=on}}) as it stands today. But economic conflicts with non-Navajos continued for many years as civilians and companies exploited resources assigned to the Navajo. The US government made leases for livestock grazing, took land for railroad development, and permitted mining on Navajo land without consultation with the tribe.\n\nIn 1883, [[Lieutenant|Lt.]] Parker, accompanied by 10 enlisted men and two scouts, went up the San Juan River to separate the Navajo and citizens who had encroached on Navajo land.<ref>Ford, \"September 30, 1887 Letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona</ref> In the same year, Lt.

Evidently, citizens of the surnames Houck and/or Owens had murdered a Navajo chief's son, and 100 armed Navajo warriors were looking for them.\n\nIn 1887, citizens Palmer, Lockhart, and King fabricated a charge of horse stealing and randomly attacked a dwelling on the reservation. Two Navajo men and all three whites died as a result, but a woman and a child survived. Capt. Kerr (with two Navajo scouts) examined the ground and then met with several hundred Navajo at Houcks Tank. Rancher Bennett, whose horse was allegedly stolen, told Kerr that his horses were stolen by the three whites to catch a horse thief.<ref>Kerr, \"February 18, 1887 letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona.</ref> In the same year, Lt. Scott went to the San Juan River] with two scouts and 21 enlisted men. The Navajos believed Lt. Scott was there to drive off the whites who had settled on the reservation and had fenced off the river from the Navajo. Scott found evidence of many non-Navajo ranches. Only three were active, and the owners wanted payment for their improvements before leaving. Scott ejected them.<ref>Scott,\" June 22, 1887 letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona</ref>\n\nIn 1890, a local rancher refused to pay the Navajo a fine of livestock. The Navajo tried to collect it, and whites in southern Colorado and Utah claimed that 9,000 of the Navajo were on a warpath. A small military detachment out of Fort Wingate restored white citizens to order.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn 1913, an Indian agent ordered a Navajo and his three wives to come in, and then arrested them for having a plural marriage. A small group of Navajo used force to free the women and retreated to [[Beautiful Mountain]] with 30 or 40 sympathizers. They refused to surrender to the agent, and local law enforcement and military refused the agent's request for an armed engagement. General Scott arrived, and with the help of [[Henry Chee Dodge]], a leader among the Navajo, defused the situation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Boarding schools and education===\n{{main|American Indian boarding schools}}\nDuring the time on the reservation, the Navajo tribe was forced to assimilate to white society. Navajo children were sent to boarding schools within the reservation and off the reservation.

European Americans taught the classes under an English-only curriculum and punished any student caught speaking Navajo.<ref name=\"Lawrence Erlbaum Associates\"/> The children were under militaristic discipline, run by the ''Sil\u00e1o''.{{Clarify|reason=Silao is a Navajo word for Police Officer.

This report discussed Indian boarding schools as being inadequate in terms of diet, medical services, dormitory overcrowding, undereducated teachers, restrictive discipline, and manual labor by the students to keep the school running.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=T.L.|last2=Bia|first2=Fred|title=A Place to be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-3760-4|page=48}}</ref>\n\nThis report was the precursor to education reforms initiated under President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], under which two new schools were built on the Navajo reservation. But Rough Rock Day School was run in the same militaristic style as Fort Defiance and did not implement the educational reforms. The Evangelical Missionary School was opened next to Rough Rock Day School. Navajo accounts of this school portray it as having a family-like atmosphere with home-cooked meals, new or gently used clothing, humane treatment, and a Navajo-based curriculum. Educators found the Evangelical Missionary School curriculum to be much more beneficial for the Navajo children.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=T.L.|last2=Bia|first2=Fred|title=A Place to be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-3760-4|pages=50\u20131}}</ref>\n\n[[File:\"Navajo Woman and Infant, Canyon de Chelle, Arizona.\" (Canyon de Chelly National Monument), 1933 - 1942 - NARA - 519947.jpg|thumb|left|''Untitled''.

Worried about large herds in the arid climate, at a time when the Dust Bowl was endangering the Great Plains, the government decided that the land of the Navajo Nation could support only a fixed number of sheep, goats, cattle, and horses. The Federal government believed that land erosion was worsening in the area and the only solution was to reduce the number of livestock.\n\nIn 1933, [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]] was appointed commissioner of the BIA. In many ways, he worked to reform government relations with the Native American tribes, but the reduction program was devastating for the Navajo, for whom their livestock was so important. The government set land capacity in terms of \"sheep units\".  In 1930 the Navajo grazed 1,100,000 mature sheep units.<ref name=\"Reduction\">{{cite book | author=Compiled | editor=Roessel, Ruth |title=Navajo Livestock Reduction: A National Disgrace | location=Tsaile, Arizona | publisher=Navajo Community College Press | year=1974 | isbn=0-912586-18-4}}</ref> These sheep provided half the cash income for the individual Navajo.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Iverson|title=\"For Our Navajo People\": Din\u00e9 Letters, Speeches & Petitions, 1900-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dU2_8WAkD4EC&pg=PA250|year=2002|publisher=U of New Mexico Press|page=250|isbn=9780826327185}}</ref>\n\nCollier's solution was to first launch a voluntary reduction program, which was made mandatory two years later in 1935. The government paid for part of the value of each animal, but it did nothing to compensate for the loss of future yearly income for so many Navajo. In the [[matrilineal]] and matrilocal world of the Navajo, women were especially hurt, as many lost their only source of income with the reduction of livestock herds.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 25443605|title = Gendered Injustice: Navajo Livestock Reduction in the New Deal Era|journal = Western Historical Quarterly|volume = 38|issue = 4|pages = 437\u2013455|last1 = Weisiger|first1 = Marsha|year = 2007|doi = 10.2307/25443605|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5612987e5b94ff46d5b9ffaaad5f556be04bc308}}</ref>\n\nThe Navajo did not understand why their centuries-old practices of raising livestock should change.<ref name=\"Reduction\" /> They were united in opposition but they were unable to stop it.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard White, ch 13: \"The Navajos become Dependent\"|title=The Roots of Dependency: Subsistence, Environment, and Social Change Among the Choctaws, Pawnees, and Navajos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_be-2k1oScC&pg=PA300|year=1988|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|pages=300ff|isbn=0803297246}}</ref> Historian Brian Dippie notes that the [[Indian Rights Association]] denounced Collier as a 'dictator' and accused him of a \"near reign of terror\" on the Navajo reservation.

Many Navajo men volunteered for military service in keeping with their warrior culture, and they served in integrated units. The War Department in 1940 rejected a proposal by the BIA that segregated units be created for the Indians. The Navajo gained firsthand experience with how they could assimilate into the modern world, and many did not return to the overcrowded reservation, which had few jobs.<ref>Alison R.

From then into the early 21st century, the U.S. allowed mining without sufficient environmental protection for workers, waterways, and land. The Navajo have claimed high rates of death and illness from lung disease and cancer resulting from environmental contamination. Since the 1970s, legislation has helped to regulate the industry and reduce the toll, but the government has not yet offered holistic and comprehensive compensation.<ref>Judy Pasternak, ''Yellow Dirt- An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed,'' Free Press, New York, 2010.</ref>\n\n===U.S. Marine Corps Involvement===\nThe Navajo Code Talkers played a significant role in the history of [[USMC]] history. Using their own language they utilized a military code; for example, the Navajo word \"turtle\" represented a tank. In 1942, Marine staff officers composed several combat simulations and the Navajo translated it and transmitted in their dialect to another Navajo on the other line. This Navajo then translated it back in english faster than any other cryptographic facilities, which demonstrated their tact. As a result, General Vogel recommended their recruitment into the USMC code talker program. \n\nEach Navajo went through basic bootcamp at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot]], San Diego before being assigned to Field Signal Battalion training at [[Camp Pendleton]]. Once the code talkers completed training in the States, they were sent to the Pacific for assignment to the Marine combat divisions. With that said, there was never a crack in the Navajo language, it was never deciphered. It is known that many more Navajos volunteered to become code talkers than could be accepted; however, an undetermined number of other Navajos served as Marines in the war, but not as code talkers. \n\nThese achievements of the Navajo Code Talkers have resulted in an honorable chapter in USMC history. Their patriotism and honor inevitably earned them the respect of all Americans.<ref> Marine Corps.

Their extended kinship groups had seasonal dwelling areas to accommodate livestock, agriculture, and gathering practices. As part of their traditional economy, Navajo groups may have formed trading or raiding parties, traveling relatively long distances.\n\nThere is a system of [[clans]] which defines relationships between individuals and families. The clan system is [[exogamy|exogamous]]: people can only marry (and date) partners outside their own clans, which for this purpose include the clans of their four grandparents. Some Navajo favor their\nchildren to marry into their father\u2019s clan. While clans are associated with a geographical area, the area is not for the exclusive use of any one clan. Members of a clan may live hundreds of miles apart but still have a clan bond.<ref name=\"Longwalk\">{{cite book | author=Compiled | editor=Roessel, Ruth | title=Navajo Stories of the Long Walk Period | location=Tsaile, Arizona | publisher=Navajo Community College Press | year=1973 | isbn=0-912586-16-8 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/navajostoriesofl0000unse }}</ref>{{rp|xix-xxi}}\n\nHistorically, the structure of the Navajo society is largely a [[matrilineal]] system, in which the family of the women owned livestock, dwellings, planting areas and livestock grazing areas. Once married, a Navajo man would follow a [[matrilocal]] residence and live with his bride in her dwelling and near her mother's family. Daughters (or, if necessary, other female relatives) were traditionally the ones who received the generational property inheritance. In cases of marital separation, women would maintain the property and children.  Children are \"born to\" and belong to the mother's clan, and are \"born for\" the father's clan. The mother's eldest brother has a strong role in her children's lives. As adults, men represent their mother's clan in tribal politics.<ref name=\"TheNavajo\" /> <!--Note: matrilocal is not the equivalent as matriarchal-->\n\nNeither sex can live without the other in the Navajo culture. Men and women are seen as contemporary equals as both a male and female are needed to reproduce. Although women may carry a bigger burden, fertility is so highly valued that males are expected to provide economic resources (known as [[bride wealth]]). Corn is a symbol of fertility in Navajo culture as they eat white corn in the wedding ceremonies. It is considered to be immoral and/or stealing if one does not provide for the other in that premarital or marital relationship. <ref> Lauren Del Carlo, ''Between the Sacred Mountains: A Cultural History of the Dineh,'' Essai, Volume 5: Article 15, 2007.</ref>\n===Ethnobotany===\nSee [[Navajo ethnobotany]].\n\n===Traditional dwellings===\n[[File:Navajo hogan.jpg|thumb|left|A Navajo hogan (with a woodshed)]]\nA [[hogan]], the traditional Navajo home, is built as a shelter for either a man or for a woman. Male hogans are square or conical with a distinct rectangular entrance, while a female hogan is an eight-sided house.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Both are made of logs and covered in mud, with the door always facing east to welcome the sun each morning. Navajos also have several types of hogans for lodging and ceremonial use. Ceremonies, such as healing ceremonies or the [[Blessing Way|''kinaald\u00e1'']], take place inside a hogan.<ref>Iverson, Nez, and Deer, 23</ref> According to Kehoe, this style of housing is distinctive to the Navajos. She writes, \"even today, a solidly constructed, log-walled Hogan is preferred by many Navajo families.\" Most Navajo members today live in apartments and houses in urban areas.<ref name=k>Kehoe, 133</ref>\n\nThose who practice the Navajo religion regard the hogan as sacred. The religious song \"[[The Blessingway]]\" (''{{spell-nv|h\u00f3zh\u01eb\u0301\u01eb\u0301j\u00ed}}'') describes the first hogan as being built by Coyote with help from Beavers to be a house for First Man, First Woman, and Talking God. The Beaver People gave Coyote logs and instructions on how to build the first hogan. Navajos made their hogans in the traditional fashion until the 1900s, when they started to make them in hexagonal and octagonal shapes.

The Navajo people believe they passed through three worlds before arriving in this world, the Fourth World or the Glittering World. As Earth People, the Din\u00e9 must do everything within their power to maintain the balance between Mother Earth and man.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.navajovalues.com/natani/navajovalues.htm#navajobeliefs|title=Navajo Cultural History and Legends|website=www.navajovalues.com|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref> The Din\u00e9 also had the expectation of keeping a positive relationship between them and the Diyin Din\u00e9. In the [[Din\u00e9 Bahane\u02bc|Din\u00e9 Bahane']] (Navajo beliefs about creation), the First, or Dark World is where the four Diyin Din\u00e9 lived and where First Woman and First Man came into existence. Because the world was so dark, life could not thrive there and they had to move on. The Second, or Blue World, was inhabited by a few of the mammals Earth People know today as well as the Swallow Chief, or T\u00e1shch\u00f3zhii. The First World beings had offended him and were asked to leave. From there, they headed south and arrived in the Third World, or Yellow World. The four sacred mountains were found here, but due to a great flood, First Woman, First Man, and the Holy People were forced to find another world to live in. This time, when they arrived, they stayed in the Fourth World. In the Glittering World, true death came into existence, as well as the creations of the seasons, the moon, stars, and the sun.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/nav/ncm/ncm4.htm|title=The Story of the Emergence|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref>\n\nThe Holy People, or Diyin Din\u00e9, had instructed the Earth People to view the four sacred mountains as the boundaries of the homeland ({{spell-nv|[[Din\u00e9tah]]}}) they should never leave: [[Blanca Peak]] ({{spell-nv|Sisnaajin\u00ed}} \u2014 Dawn or White Shell Mountain) in Colorado; [[Mount Taylor (New Mexico)|Mount Taylor]] ({{spell-nv|Tsoodzi\u0142}} \u2014 Blue Bead or Turquoise Mountain) in New Mexico; the [[San Francisco Peaks]] ({{spell-nv|Dook\u02bco\u02bcoos\u0142\u00ed\u00edd}} \u2014 Abalone Shell Mountain) in Arizona; and [[Hesperus Mountain]] ({{spell-nv|Dib\u00e9 Nitsaa}} \u2014 Big Mountain Sheep) in Colorado.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.discovernavajo.com/navajo-culture.aspx|title=Navajo Culture|website=www.discovernavajo.com|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref> Times of day, as well as colors, are used to represent the four sacred mountains. Throughout religions, the importance of a specific number is emphasized and in the Navajo religion, the number four appears to be sacred to their practices. For example, there were four original clans of Din\u00e9, four colors and times of day, four Diyin Din\u00e9, and for the most part, four songs sung for a ritual.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nNavajos have many different ceremonies.

The Blessing Way ceremonies are based on establishing \"peace, harmony, and good things exclusively\" within the Dine. The Enemy Way, or Evil Way ceremonies are concerned with counteracting influences that come from outside the Dine.<ref name=\":2\" /> Spiritual healing ceremonies are rooted in Navajo traditional stories. One of them, the Night Chant ceremony, is conducted over several days and involves up to 24 dancers. The ceremony requires  the dancers to wear buckskin masks, as do many of the other Navajo ceremonies, and they all represent specific gods.<ref name=\":2\" /> The purpose of the Night Chant is to purify the patients and heal them through prayers to the spirit-beings. Each day of the ceremony entails the performance of certain rites and the creation of detailed sand paintings.

[[Atsidi Sani]] (c. 1830\u2013c. 1918) is considered to be the first Navajo silversmith. He learned silversmithing from a Mexican man called ''Nakai Tsosi'' (\"Thin Mexican\") around 1878 and began teaching other Navajos how to work with silver.<ref>Adair 4</ref> By 1880, Navajo silversmiths were creating [[handmade jewelry]] including bracelets, tobacco flasks, [[necklace]]s and [[bracer]]s. Later, they added silver [[earrings]], [[buckles]], [[Bolo tie|bolos]], hair ornaments, pins and squash blossom necklaces for tribal use, and to sell to tourists as a way to supplement their income.<ref>Adair 135</ref>\n\nThe Navajos' hallmark jewelry piece called the \"squash blossom\" necklace first appeared in the 1880s. The term \"squash blossom\" was apparently attached to the name of the Navajo necklace at an early date, although its bud-shaped beads are thought to derive from Spanish-Mexican [[pomegranate]] designs.<ref>Adair 44</ref> The Navajo silversmiths also borrowed the \"naja\" (''najahe'' in Navajo)<ref>Adair, 9</ref> symbol to shape the silver pendant that hangs from the \"squash blossom\" necklace.\n\n[[Turquoise]] has been part of jewelry for centuries, but Navajo artists did not use inlay techniques to insert turquoise into silver designs until the late 19th century.\n\n===Weaving===\n{{Main|Navajo weaving}}\n[[File:Navajo sheep & weaver.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Navajo weaver with sheep]]\n[[File:Navajo Germantown Rug 2008.008.001.jpg|180px|thumb|Navajo Germantown Eye Dazzler Rug, [[Science History Institute]] ]]\n[[File:Probably Bayeta-style Blanket with Terrace and Stepped Design, 1870-1880, 50.67.54.jpg|thumbnail|''Probably Bayeta-style Blanket with Terrace and Stepped Design'', 1870\u20131880, 50.67.54, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nNavajos came to the southwest with their own weaving traditions; however, they learned to weave cotton on upright looms from Pueblo peoples. The first Spaniards to visit the region wrote about seeing Navajo blankets. By the 18th century the Navajos had begun to import Bayeta red yarn to supplement local black, grey, and white wool, as well as wool dyed with [[indigo dye|indigo]]. Using an upright loom, the Navajos made extremely fine utilitarian blankets that were collected by [[Ute tribe|Ute]] and [[Plains Indians]]. These Chief's Blankets, so called because only chiefs or very wealthy individuals could afford them, were characterized by horizontal stripes and minimal patterning in red. First Phase Chief's Blankets have only horizontal stripes, Second Phase feature red rectangular designs, and Third Phase feature red diamonds and partial diamond patterns.\n\nThe completion of the railroads dramatically changed Navajo weaving. Cheap blankets were imported, so Navajo weavers shifted their focus to weaving rugs for an increasingly non-Native audience. Rail service also brought in Germantown wool from [[Philadelphia]], commercially dyed wool which greatly expanded the weavers' color palettes.\n\nSome early European-American settlers moved in and set up trading posts, often buying [[Navajo rug]]s by the pound and selling them back east by the bale. The traders encouraged the locals to weave blankets and [[Navajo Rug|rugs]] into distinct styles. These included \"Two Gray Hills\" (predominantly black and white, with traditional patterns); ''Teec Nos Pos'' (colorful, with very extensive patterns); \"Ganado\" (founded by [[Don Lorenzo Hubbell]]<ref>[http://www.wmonline.com/attract/pforest/hubbell.htm \"Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site\"] ''White Mountains Online.'' (retrieved 28 Nov 2010)</ref>), red-dominated patterns with black and white; \"Crystal\" (founded by J. B. Moore); oriental and [[Persian rug|Persian]] styles (almost always with [[natural dye]]s); \"Wide Ruins\", \"Chinlee\", banded geometric patterns; \"Klagetoh\", diamond-type patterns; \"Red Mesa\" and bold diamond patterns.<ref>Denver Art Museum. [http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/6aa/6aa75.htm \"Blanket Statements\"], ''Traditional Fine Arts Organization.'' (retrieved 28 Nov 2010)</ref> Many of these patterns exhibit a fourfold symmetry, which is thought to embody traditional ideas about harmony or ''[[h\u00f3zh\u01eb\u0301]]''.\n\n==In the media==\nIn 2000 the documentary ''[[The Return of Navajo Boy]]'' was shown at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was written in response to an earlier film, ''[[The Navajo Boy]]'' which was somewhat exploitative of those Navajos involved. ''The Return of Navajo Boy'' allowed the Navajos to be more involved in the depictions of themselves.<ref name=navajoboy.com>{{cite web|title=Synopsis |work=navajoboy.com |url=http://www.navajoboy.com/press.htm |accessdate=2009-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208005920/http://www.navajoboy.com/press.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the final episode of the third season of the FX reality TV show ''[[30 Days (TV series)|30 Days]]'', the show's producer [[Morgan Spurlock]] spends thirty days living with a Navajo family on their reservation in New Mexico.

Twenty Navajo chiefs asked for peace. In 1804 and 1805 the Navajo and Spanish mounted major expeditions against each other's settlements. In May 1805 another peace was established.

On November 21, 1846, following an invitation from a small party of American soldiers under the command of Captain John Reid, who journeyed deep into Navajo country and contacted him, [[Narbona]] and other Navajo negotiated [[Bear Springs Treaty|a treaty of peace]] with Colonel [[Alexander William Doniphan|Alexander Doniphan]] at Bear Springs, Ojo del Oso (later the site of [[Fort Wingate]]). This agreement was not honored by some Navajo, nor by some New Mexicans.

The treaty acknowledged the transfer of jurisdiction from the United Mexican States to the United States. The treaty allowed forts and trading posts to be built on Navajo land.

Military records cite this development as a precautionary measure to protect citizens and the Navajo from each other. However, the Spanish/Mexican-Navajo pattern of raids and expeditions continued. Over 400 New Mexican militia conducted a campaign against the Navajo, against the wishes of the Territorial Governor, in 1860\u201361. They killed Navajo warriors, captured women and children for slaves, and destroyed crops and dwellings. The Navajo call this period ''Naahondzood'', \"the fearing time.\"\n\nIn 1861, Brigadier-General [[James Henry Carleton|James H. Carleton]], Commander of the Federal District of New Mexico, initiated a series of military actions against the Navajo and Apache. Colonel [[Kit Carson]]  was at the new [[Fort Wingate]] with Army troops and volunteer New Mexico militia.  Carleton ordered Carson to kill [[Mescalero]] Apache men and destroy any Mescalero property he could find. Carleton believed these harsh tactics would bring any Indian Tribe under control. The Mescalero surrendered and were sent to the new reservation called [[Bosque Redondo]].\n\nIn the summer of 1863, Carleton ordered Carson to use the same tactics on the Navajo. Carson and his force swept through Navajo land, killing Navajo and destroying crops and dwellings, fouling wells, and capturing livestock. Facing starvation and death, Navajo groups came in to [[Fort Defiance, Arizona|Fort Defiance]] for relief. On July 20, 1863, the first of many groups departed to join the Mescalero at Bosque Redondo.

The internment at Bosque Redondo was disastrous for the Navajo, as the government failed to provide an adequate supply of water, wood, provisions, and livestock for the 4,000\u20135,000 people. Large-scale crop failure and disease were also endemic during this time, as were raids by other tribes and civilians. Some Navajo froze during the winter because they could make only poor shelters from the few materials and resources they were given. This period is known among the Navajo as \"The Fearing Time\".<ref>George Bornstein, \"The Fearing Time: Telling the tales of Indian slavery in American history\", ''Times Literary Supplement'', 20 October 2017 p. 29 (review of Andr\u00e9s Res\u00e9ndez, ''The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, {{ISBN|9780547640983}}).</ref> In addition, a small group of [[Mescalero|Mescalero Apache]], longtime enemies of the Navajos had been relocated to the area. Conflicts resulted.\n\nIn 1868, the [[Treaty of Bosque Redondo]] was negotiated between Navajo leaders and the federal government allowing the surviving Navajo to return to a [[Native American reservation|reservation]] on a portion of their former homeland.\n\n===Reservation era===\n\n[[File:Navajo woman & child.jpg|thumb|200px|Navajo woman and child, ''circa'' 1880\u20131910]]\nThe United States military continued to maintain forts on the Navajo reservation in the years following the Long Walk. Between 1873 and 1895, the military employed Navajo as [[Navajo Scouts|\"Indian Scouts\"]] at Fort Wingate to assist their regular units.<ref>Marei Bouknight and others, ''Guide to Records in the Military Archives Division Pertaining to Indian-White Relations,'' GSA National Archives, 1972</ref> During this period, Chief [[Manuelito]] founded the [[Navajo Tribal Police]]. It operated between 1872 and 1875 as an anti-raid task force working to maintain the peaceful terms of the 1868 Navajo treaty.\n\nBy treaty, the Navajo were allowed to leave the reservation for trade, with permission from the military or local [[Indian agent]]. Eventually, the arrangement led to a gradual end in Navajo raids, as the tribe was able to increase the size of their livestock herds and cultivated crops. In addition, the tribe gained an increase in the size of the Navajo reservation from 3.5 million acres ({{convert|14,000|km\u00b2|mi2|abbr=on}}) to the 16 million acres ({{convert|65,000|km\u00b2|mi2|abbr=on}}) as it stands today. But economic conflicts with non-Navajos continued for many years as civilians and companies exploited resources assigned to the Navajo. The US government made leases for livestock grazing, took land for railroad development, and permitted mining on Navajo land without consultation with the tribe.\n\nIn 1883, [[Lieutenant|Lt.]] Parker, accompanied by 10 enlisted men and two scouts, went up the San Juan River to separate the Navajo and citizens who had encroached on Navajo land.<ref>Ford, \"September 30, 1887 Letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona</ref> In the same year, Lt.

Two Navajo men and all three whites died as a result, but a woman and a child survived. Capt. Kerr (with two Navajo scouts) examined the ground and then met with several hundred Navajo at Houcks Tank. Rancher Bennett, whose horse was allegedly stolen, told Kerr that his horses were stolen by the three whites to catch a horse thief.<ref>Kerr, \"February 18, 1887 letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona.</ref> In the same year, Lt.

Scott was there to drive off the whites who had settled on the reservation and had fenced off the river from the Navajo. Scott found evidence of many non-Navajo ranches. Only three were active, and the owners wanted payment for their improvements before leaving. Scott ejected them.<ref>Scott,\" June 22, 1887 letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona</ref>\n\nIn 1890, a local rancher refused to pay the Navajo a fine of livestock. The Navajo tried to collect it, and whites in southern Colorado and Utah claimed that 9,000 of the Navajo were on a warpath. A small military detachment out of Fort Wingate restored white citizens to order.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn 1913, an Indian agent ordered a Navajo and his three wives to come in, and then arrested them for having a plural marriage. A small group of Navajo used force to free the women and retreated to [[Beautiful Mountain]] with 30 or 40 sympathizers. They refused to surrender to the agent, and local law enforcement and military refused the agent's request for an armed engagement.

This report discussed Indian boarding schools as being inadequate in terms of diet, medical services, dormitory overcrowding, undereducated teachers, restrictive discipline, and manual labor by the students to keep the school running.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=T.L.|last2=Bia|first2=Fred|title=A Place to be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-3760-4|page=48}}</ref>\n\nThis report was the precursor to education reforms initiated under President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], under which two new schools were built on the Navajo reservation. But Rough Rock Day School was run in the same militaristic style as Fort Defiance and did not implement the educational reforms. The Evangelical Missionary School was opened next to Rough Rock Day School. Navajo accounts of this school portray it as having a family-like atmosphere with home-cooked meals, new or gently used clothing, humane treatment, and a Navajo-based curriculum. Educators found the Evangelical Missionary School curriculum to be much more beneficial for the Navajo children.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=T.L.|last2=Bia|first2=Fred|title=A Place to be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-3760-4|pages=50\u20131}}</ref>\n\n[[File:\"Navajo Woman and Infant, Canyon de Chelle, Arizona.\" (Canyon de Chelly National Monument), 1933 - 1942 - NARA - 519947.jpg|thumb|left|''Untitled''.

Worried about large herds in the arid climate, at a time when the Dust Bowl was endangering the Great Plains, the government decided that the land of the Navajo Nation could support only a fixed number of sheep, goats, cattle, and horses. The Federal government believed that land erosion was worsening in the area and the only solution was to reduce the number of livestock.\n\nIn 1933, [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]] was appointed commissioner of the BIA. In many ways, he worked to reform government relations with the Native American tribes, but the reduction program was devastating for the Navajo, for whom their livestock was so important. The government set land capacity in terms of \"sheep units\".  In 1930 the Navajo grazed 1,100,000 mature sheep units.<ref name=\"Reduction\">{{cite book | author=Compiled | editor=Roessel, Ruth |title=Navajo Livestock Reduction: A National Disgrace | location=Tsaile, Arizona | publisher=Navajo Community College Press | year=1974 | isbn=0-912586-18-4}}</ref> These sheep provided half the cash income for the individual Navajo.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Iverson|title=\"For Our Navajo People\": Din\u00e9 Letters, Speeches & Petitions, 1900-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dU2_8WAkD4EC&pg=PA250|year=2002|publisher=U of New Mexico Press|page=250|isbn=9780826327185}}</ref>\n\nCollier's solution was to first launch a voluntary reduction program, which was made mandatory two years later in 1935. The government paid for part of the value of each animal, but it did nothing to compensate for the loss of future yearly income for so many Navajo.

Many Navajo men volunteered for military service in keeping with their warrior culture, and they served in integrated units. The War Department in 1940 rejected a proposal by the BIA that segregated units be created for the Indians. The Navajo gained firsthand experience with how they could assimilate into the modern world, and many did not return to the overcrowded reservation, which had few jobs.<ref>Alison R.

Using their own language they utilized a military code; for example, the Navajo word \"turtle\" represented a tank. In 1942, Marine staff officers composed several combat simulations and the Navajo translated it and transmitted in their dialect to another Navajo on the other line. This Navajo then translated it back in english faster than any other cryptographic facilities, which demonstrated their tact. As a result, General Vogel recommended their recruitment into the USMC code talker program. \n\nEach Navajo went through basic bootcamp at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot]], San Diego before being assigned to Field Signal Battalion training at [[Camp Pendleton]]. Once the code talkers completed training in the States, they were sent to the Pacific for assignment to the Marine combat divisions. With that said, there was never a crack in the Navajo language, it was never deciphered. It is known that many more Navajos volunteered to become code talkers than could be accepted; however, an undetermined number of other Navajos served as Marines in the war, but not as code talkers. \n\nThese achievements of the Navajo Code Talkers have resulted in an honorable chapter in USMC history. Their patriotism and honor inevitably earned them the respect of all Americans.<ref> Marine Corps.

Their extended kinship groups had seasonal dwelling areas to accommodate livestock, agriculture, and gathering practices. As part of their traditional economy, Navajo groups may have formed trading or raiding parties, traveling relatively long distances.\n\nThere is a system of [[clans]] which defines relationships between individuals and families. The clan system is [[exogamy|exogamous]]: people can only marry (and date) partners outside their own clans, which for this purpose include the clans of their four grandparents.

Members of a clan may live hundreds of miles apart but still have a clan bond.<ref name=\"Longwalk\">{{cite book | author=Compiled | editor=Roessel, Ruth | title=Navajo Stories of the Long Walk Period | location=Tsaile, Arizona | publisher=Navajo Community College Press | year=1973 | isbn=0-912586-16-8 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/navajostoriesofl0000unse }}</ref>{{rp|xix-xxi}}\n\nHistorically, the structure of the Navajo society is largely a [[matrilineal]] system, in which the family of the women owned livestock, dwellings, planting areas and livestock grazing areas. Once married, a Navajo man would follow a [[matrilocal]] residence and live with his bride in her dwelling and near her mother's family. Daughters (or, if necessary, other female relatives) were traditionally the ones who received the generational property inheritance. In cases of marital separation, women would maintain the property and children.  Children are \"born to\" and belong to the mother's clan, and are \"born for\" the father's clan. The mother's eldest brother has a strong role in her children's lives. As adults, men represent their mother's clan in tribal politics.<ref name=\"TheNavajo\" /> <!--Note: matrilocal is not the equivalent as matriarchal-->\n\nNeither sex can live without the other in the Navajo culture. Men and women are seen as contemporary equals as both a male and female are needed to reproduce. Although women may carry a bigger burden, fertility is so highly valued that males are expected to provide economic resources (known as [[bride wealth]]). Corn is a symbol of fertility in Navajo culture as they eat white corn in the wedding ceremonies. It is considered to be immoral and/or stealing if one does not provide for the other in that premarital or marital relationship. <ref> Lauren Del Carlo, ''Between the Sacred Mountains: A Cultural History of the Dineh,'' Essai, Volume 5: Article 15, 2007.</ref>\n===Ethnobotany===\nSee [[Navajo ethnobotany]].\n\n===Traditional dwellings===\n[[File:Navajo hogan.jpg|thumb|left|A Navajo hogan (with a woodshed)]]\nA [[hogan]], the traditional Navajo home, is built as a shelter for either a man or for a woman. Male hogans are square or conical with a distinct rectangular entrance, while a female hogan is an eight-sided house.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Both are made of logs and covered in mud, with the door always facing east to welcome the sun each morning. Navajos also have several types of hogans for lodging and ceremonial use. Ceremonies, such as healing ceremonies or the [[Blessing Way|''kinaald\u00e1'']], take place inside a hogan.<ref>Iverson, Nez, and Deer, 23</ref> According to Kehoe, this style of housing is distinctive to the Navajos. She writes, \"even today, a solidly constructed, log-walled Hogan is preferred by many Navajo families.\" Most Navajo members today live in apartments and houses in urban areas.<ref name=k>Kehoe, 133</ref>\n\nThose who practice the Navajo religion regard the hogan as sacred. The religious song \"[[The Blessingway]]\" (''{{spell-nv|h\u00f3zh\u01eb\u0301\u01eb\u0301j\u00ed}}'') describes the first hogan as being built by Coyote with help from Beavers to be a house for First Man, First Woman, and Talking God. The Beaver People gave Coyote logs and instructions on how to build the first hogan. Navajos made their hogans in the traditional fashion until the 1900s, when they started to make them in hexagonal and octagonal shapes. Hogans continue to be used as dwellings, especially by older Navajos, although they tend to be made with modern construction materials and techniques. Some are maintained specifically for ceremonial purposes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Spiritual and religious beliefs===\n{{see also|Din\u00e9 Bahane\u02bc|label 1=Din\u00e9 Bahane\u02bc (Navajo creation beliefs)}}\n[[File:Navajo Yebichai (Yei Bi Chei) dancers.

The Din\u00e9 believed in two classes of people: Earth People and Holy People. The Navajo people believe they passed through three worlds before arriving in this world, the Fourth World or the Glittering World. As Earth People, the Din\u00e9 must do everything within their power to maintain the balance between Mother Earth and man.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.navajovalues.com/natani/navajovalues.htm#navajobeliefs|title=Navajo Cultural History and Legends|website=www.navajovalues.com|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref> The Din\u00e9 also had the expectation of keeping a positive relationship between them and the Diyin Din\u00e9. In the [[Din\u00e9 Bahane\u02bc|Din\u00e9 Bahane']] (Navajo beliefs about creation), the First, or Dark World is where the four Diyin Din\u00e9 lived and where First Woman and First Man came into existence. Because the world was so dark, life could not thrive there and they had to move on. The Second, or Blue World, was inhabited by a few of the mammals Earth People know today as well as the Swallow Chief, or T\u00e1shch\u00f3zhii. The First World beings had offended him and were asked to leave. From there, they headed south and arrived in the Third World, or Yellow World. The four sacred mountains were found here, but due to a great flood, First Woman, First Man, and the Holy People were forced to find another world to live in. This time, when they arrived, they stayed in the Fourth World. In the Glittering World, true death came into existence, as well as the creations of the seasons, the moon, stars, and the sun.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/nav/ncm/ncm4.htm|title=The Story of the Emergence|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref>\n\nThe Holy People, or Diyin Din\u00e9, had instructed the Earth People to view the four sacred mountains as the boundaries of the homeland ({{spell-nv|[[Din\u00e9tah]]}}) they should never leave: [[Blanca Peak]] ({{spell-nv|Sisnaajin\u00ed}} \u2014 Dawn or White Shell Mountain) in Colorado; [[Mount Taylor (New Mexico)|Mount Taylor]] ({{spell-nv|Tsoodzi\u0142}} \u2014 Blue Bead or Turquoise Mountain) in New Mexico; the [[San Francisco Peaks]] ({{spell-nv|Dook\u02bco\u02bcoos\u0142\u00ed\u00edd}} \u2014 Abalone Shell Mountain) in Arizona; and [[Hesperus Mountain]] ({{spell-nv|Dib\u00e9 Nitsaa}} \u2014 Big Mountain Sheep) in Colorado.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.discovernavajo.com/navajo-culture.aspx|title=Navajo Culture|website=www.discovernavajo.com|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref> Times of day, as well as colors, are used to represent the four sacred mountains. Throughout religions, the importance of a specific number is emphasized and in the Navajo religion, the number four appears to be sacred to their practices.

The Blessing Way ceremonies are based on establishing \"peace, harmony, and good things exclusively\" within the Dine. The Enemy Way, or Evil Way ceremonies are concerned with counteracting influences that come from outside the Dine.<ref name=\":2\" /> Spiritual healing ceremonies are rooted in Navajo traditional stories. One of them, the Night Chant ceremony, is conducted over several days and involves up to 24 dancers. The ceremony requires  the dancers to wear buckskin masks, as do many of the other Navajo ceremonies, and they all represent specific gods.<ref name=\":2\" /> The purpose of the Night Chant is to purify the patients and heal them through prayers to the spirit-beings. Each day of the ceremony entails the performance of certain rites and the creation of detailed sand paintings.

[[Atsidi Sani]] (c. 1830\u2013c. 1918) is considered to be the first Navajo silversmith. He learned silversmithing from a Mexican man called ''Nakai Tsosi'' (\"Thin Mexican\") around 1878 and began teaching other Navajos how to work with silver.<ref>Adair 4</ref> By 1880, Navajo silversmiths were creating [[handmade jewelry]] including bracelets, tobacco flasks, [[necklace]]s and [[bracer]]s. Later, they added silver [[earrings]], [[buckles]], [[Bolo tie|bolos]], hair ornaments, pins and squash blossom necklaces for tribal use, and to sell to tourists as a way to supplement their income.<ref>Adair 135</ref>\n\nThe Navajos' hallmark jewelry piece called the \"squash blossom\" necklace first appeared in the 1880s. The term \"squash blossom\" was apparently attached to the name of the Navajo necklace at an early date, although its bud-shaped beads are thought to derive from Spanish-Mexican [[pomegranate]] designs.<ref>Adair 44</ref> The Navajo silversmiths also borrowed the \"naja\" (''najahe'' in Navajo)<ref>Adair, 9</ref> symbol to shape the silver pendant that hangs from the \"squash blossom\" necklace.\n\n[[Turquoise]] has been part of jewelry for centuries, but Navajo artists did not use inlay techniques to insert turquoise into silver designs until the late 19th century.\n\n===Weaving===\n{{Main|Navajo weaving}}\n[[File:Navajo sheep & weaver.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Navajo weaver with sheep]]\n[[File:Navajo Germantown Rug 2008.008.001.jpg|180px|thumb|Navajo Germantown Eye Dazzler Rug, [[Science History Institute]] ]]\n[[File:Probably Bayeta-style Blanket with Terrace and Stepped Design, 1870-1880, 50.67.54.jpg|thumbnail|''Probably Bayeta-style Blanket with Terrace and Stepped Design'', 1870\u20131880, 50.67.54, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nNavajos came to the southwest with their own weaving traditions; however, they learned to weave cotton on upright looms from Pueblo peoples. The first Spaniards to visit the region wrote about seeing Navajo blankets. By the 18th century the Navajos had begun to import Bayeta red yarn to supplement local black, grey, and white wool, as well as wool dyed with [[indigo dye|indigo]]. Using an upright loom, the Navajos made extremely fine utilitarian blankets that were collected by [[Ute tribe|Ute]] and [[Plains Indians]]. These Chief's Blankets, so called because only chiefs or very wealthy individuals could afford them, were characterized by horizontal stripes and minimal patterning in red. First Phase Chief's Blankets have only horizontal stripes, Second Phase feature red rectangular designs, and Third Phase feature red diamonds and partial diamond patterns.\n\nThe completion of the railroads dramatically changed Navajo weaving. Cheap blankets were imported, so Navajo weavers shifted their focus to weaving rugs for an increasingly non-Native audience. Rail service also brought in Germantown wool from [[Philadelphia]], commercially dyed wool which greatly expanded the weavers' color palettes.\n\nSome early European-American settlers moved in and set up trading posts, often buying [[Navajo rug]]s by the pound and selling them back east by the bale. The traders encouraged the locals to weave blankets and [[Navajo Rug|rugs]] into distinct styles. These included \"Two Gray Hills\" (predominantly black and white, with traditional patterns); ''Teec Nos Pos'' (colorful, with very extensive patterns); \"Ganado\" (founded by [[Don Lorenzo Hubbell]]<ref>[http://www.wmonline.com/attract/pforest/hubbell.htm \"Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site\"] ''White Mountains Online.'' (retrieved 28 Nov 2010)</ref>), red-dominated patterns with black and white; \"Crystal\" (founded by J. B. Moore); oriental and [[Persian rug|Persian]] styles (almost always with [[natural dye]]s); \"Wide Ruins\", \"Chinlee\", banded geometric patterns; \"Klagetoh\", diamond-type patterns; \"Red Mesa\" and bold diamond patterns.<ref>Denver Art Museum. [http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/6aa/6aa75.htm \"Blanket Statements\"], ''Traditional Fine Arts Organization.'' (retrieved 28 Nov 2010)</ref> Many of these patterns exhibit a fourfold symmetry, which is thought to embody traditional ideas about harmony or ''[[h\u00f3zh\u01eb\u0301]]''.\n\n==In the media==\nIn 2000 the documentary ''[[The Return of Navajo Boy]]'' was shown at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was written in response to an earlier film, ''[[The Navajo Boy]]'' which was somewhat exploitative of those Navajos involved. ''The Return of Navajo Boy'' allowed the Navajos to be more involved in the depictions of themselves.<ref name=navajoboy.com>{{cite web|title=Synopsis |work=navajoboy.com |url=http://www.navajoboy.com/press.htm |accessdate=2009-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208005920/http://www.navajoboy.com/press.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the final episode of the third season of the FX reality TV show ''[[30 Days (TV series)|30 Days]]'', the show's producer [[Morgan Spurlock]] spends thirty days living with a Navajo family on their reservation in New Mexico.

The program maps the Earth by [[superimposition|superimposing]] satellite images, [[aerial photography]], and [[geographic information system|GIS data]] onto a 3D globe, allowing users to see cities and landscapes from various angles. Users can explore the globe by entering addresses and coordinates, or by using a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] or [[computer mouse|mouse]]. The program can also be downloaded on a [[smartphone]] or [[Tablet computer|tablet]], using a [[touch screen]] or [[stylus]] to navigate. Users may use the program to add their own data using [[Keyhole Markup Language]] and upload them through various sources, such as forums or [[blog]]s. Google Earth is able to show various kinds of images overlaid on the surface of the earth and is also a [[Web Map Service]] client. Recently [[Google]] has revealed that Google Earth now covers more than 98 percent of the world, and has captured 10 million miles of Street View imagery, a distance that could circle the globe more than 400 times.\n\nIn addition to Earth navigation, Google Earth provides a series of other tools through the desktop application. Additional globes for the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]] are available, as well as a tool for viewing the [[night sky]]. A [[flight simulator]] game is also included. Other features allow users to view photos from various places uploaded to [[Panoramio]], information provided by [[Wikipedia]] on some locations, and Street View imagery. The web-based version of Google Earth also includes Voyager, a feature that periodically adds in-program tours, often presented by scientists and documentarians.\n\nGoogle Earth has been viewed by some as a threat to [[privacy]] and [[national security]], leading to the program being banned in multiple countries. Some countries have requested that certain areas be obscured in Google's satellite images, usually areas containing military facilities.\n\n==History==\nThe core technology behind Google Earth was originally developed at Intrinsic Graphics in the late 1990s.

The program maps the Earth by [[superimposition|superimposing]] satellite images, [[aerial photography]], and [[geographic information system|GIS data]] onto a 3D globe, allowing users to see cities and landscapes from various angles. Users can explore the globe by entering addresses and coordinates, or by using a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] or [[computer mouse|mouse]]. The program can also be downloaded on a [[smartphone]] or [[Tablet computer|tablet]], using a [[touch screen]] or [[stylus]] to navigate. Users may use the program to add their own data using [[Keyhole Markup Language]] and upload them through various sources, such as forums or [[blog]]s. Google Earth is able to show various kinds of images overlaid on the surface of the earth and is also a [[Web Map Service]] client. Recently [[Google]] has revealed that Google Earth now covers more than 98 percent of the world, and has captured 10 million miles of Street View imagery, a distance that could circle the globe more than 400 times.\n\nIn addition to Earth navigation, Google Earth provides a series of other tools through the desktop application. Additional globes for the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]] are available, as well as a tool for viewing the [[night sky]]. A [[flight simulator]] game is also included. Other features allow users to view photos from various places uploaded to [[Panoramio]], information provided by [[Wikipedia]] on some locations, and Street View imagery. The web-based version of Google Earth also includes Voyager, a feature that periodically adds in-program tours, often presented by scientists and documentarians.\n\nGoogle Earth has been viewed by some as a threat to [[privacy]] and [[national security]], leading to the program being banned in multiple countries. Some countries have requested that certain areas be obscured in Google's satellite images, usually areas containing military facilities.\n\n==History==\nThe core technology behind Google Earth was originally developed at Intrinsic Graphics in the late 1990s.

He demonstrated that the emission is mostly concentrated in the [[microwave]] spectral range. His results became the basis of his [[habilitation]] on \"Coherent Radiation of Electrons in the Synchrotron Accelerator\", defended in 1951. By 1950, Prokhorov was assistant chief of the oscillation laboratory. Around that time, he formed a group of young scientists to work on radiospectroscopy of molecular rotations and vibrations, and later on [[quantum electronics]]. The group focused on a special class of molecules which have three (non-degenerate) moments of inertia. The research was conducted both on experiment and theory. In 1954, Prokhorov became head of the laboratory. Together with [[Nikolay Basov]] he developed theoretical grounds for creation of a molecular oscillator and constructed such an oscillator based on ammonia. They also proposed a method for the production of population inversion using inhomogeneous electric and magnetic fields. Their results were first presented at a national conference in 1952, but not published until 1954\u20131955;<ref name=nobel/><ref name=hero/>\n\nIn 1955, Prokhorov started his research in the field of [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] (EPR). He focused on relaxation times of ions of the [[iron group element]]s in a lattice of [[aluminium oxide]], but also investigated other, \"non-optical\", topics, such as magnetic phase transitions in [[DPPH]].<ref>A. M. Prokhorov and V.B. Fedorov, Soviet Physics JETP 16 (1963) 1489.</ref> In 1957, while studying [[ruby]], a [[chromium]]-doped variation of aluminium oxide, he came upon the idea of using this material as an active medium of a laser. As a new type of laser resonator, he proposed, in 1958, an \"open type\" cavity design, which is widely used today. In 1963, together with A. S. Selivanenko, he suggested a laser using two-quantum transitions.

His research there was devoted to propagation of radio waves in the [[ionosphere]]. At the onset of [[World War II]] in the Soviet Union, in June 1941, he joined the Red Army.

He demonstrated that the emission is mostly concentrated in the [[microwave]] spectral range. His results became the basis of his [[habilitation]] on \"Coherent Radiation of Electrons in the Synchrotron Accelerator\", defended in 1951. By 1950, Prokhorov was assistant chief of the oscillation laboratory. Around that time, he formed a group of young scientists to work on radiospectroscopy of molecular rotations and vibrations, and later on [[quantum electronics]]. The group focused on a special class of molecules which have three (non-degenerate) moments of inertia. The research was conducted both on experiment and theory. In 1954, Prokhorov became head of the laboratory. Together with [[Nikolay Basov]] he developed theoretical grounds for creation of a molecular oscillator and constructed such an oscillator based on ammonia. They also proposed a method for the production of population inversion using inhomogeneous electric and magnetic fields. Their results were first presented at a national conference in 1952, but not published until 1954\u20131955;<ref name=nobel/><ref name=hero/>\n\nIn 1955, Prokhorov started his research in the field of [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] (EPR). He focused on relaxation times of ions of the [[iron group element]]s in a lattice of [[aluminium oxide]], but also investigated other, \"non-optical\", topics, such as magnetic phase transitions in [[DPPH]].<ref>A. M. Prokhorov and V.B. Fedorov, Soviet Physics JETP 16 (1963) 1489.</ref> In 1957, while studying [[ruby]], a [[chromium]]-doped variation of aluminium oxide, he came upon the idea of using this material as an active medium of a laser. As a new type of laser resonator, he proposed, in 1958, an \"open type\" cavity design, which is widely used today. In 1963, together with A. S. Selivanenko, he suggested a laser using two-quantum transitions. For his pioneering work on lasers and masers, in 1964, he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] shared with [[Nikolay Basov]] and [[Charles Hard Townes]].<ref name=nobel/><ref name=hero/>\n\n==Posts and awards==\nIn 1959, Prokhorov became a professor at [[Moscow State University]] \u2013 the most prestigious university in the Soviet Union; the same year, he was awarded the [[Lenin Prize]].

Since there is only one, the remainder has degree zero and this is the one right-most term under the bar. Mark the separation with a vertical bar.\n:<math>\t\\begin{array}{rrr|r} \n    1 &  -9 & -27 & -123 \n\\end{array}</math>\n \nThe terms are written with increasing degree from right to left beginning with degree zero for both the remainder and the result.\n:<math>\t\\begin{array}{rrr|r} \n    1x^2 &  -9x & -27 & -123 \n\\end{array}</math>\n\nThe result of our division is:\n:<math>\\frac{x^3 - 12x^2 - 42}{x - 3} = x^2 - 9x - 27 - \\frac{123}{x - 3}</math>\n\n===Evaluating polynomials by the remainder theorem===\n\nThe above form of synthetic division is useful in the context of the [[polynomial remainder theorem]] for evaluating [[univariate]] polynomials. To summarize, the value of <math>p(x)</math> at <math>a</math> is equal to the [[remainder]] of <math>\\frac{p(x)}{(x-a)}</math>. The advantage of calculating the value this way is that it requires just over half as many multiplication steps as naive evaluation. An alternative evaluation strategy is [[Horner's method]].\n\n== Expanded synthetic division ==\nThis method generalizes to division by any [[monic polynomial]] with only a slight modification with '''changes in bold'''.  Using the same steps as before,  perform the following division:\n:<math>\\frac{x^3 - 12x^2 - 42}{x^2 - x - 3}</math>\n\nWe concern ourselves only with the coefficients.\nWrite the coefficients of the polynomial to be divided at the top.\n:<math>\t\\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n\\     1 & -12 & 0 & -42 \n\\end{array}</math>\n\nNegate the coefficients of the divisor. \n:<math>\t\\begin{array}{rrr} \n     -1x^2 &-1x &+3\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nWrite in every coefficient but the first one on the left '''in an upward right diagonal''' (see next diagram).\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rr} \\\\ &3 \\\\ -1& \\\\ \\end{array}\n    &\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \\ \n        1 & -12 & 0 & -42 \\\\\n          &     &   &     \\\\\n          &     &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nNote the change of sign from  '''1 to &minus;1 and from &minus;3 to 3 '''. \"Drop\" the first coefficient after the bar to the last row.\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rr} \\\\ &3 \\\\ -1& \\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\n    &\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        1 & -12 & 0 & -42 \\\\\n          &     &   &     \\\\\n          &     &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline \n        1 &     &   &     \\\\    \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nMultiply the dropped number by the '''diagonal''' before the bar, and place the resulting entries '''diagonally to the right''' from the dropped entry.\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rr} \\\\ &3 \\\\ -1& \\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\n    &\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        1 & -12 & 0 & -42 \\\\\n          &     & 3 &     \\\\\n          &  -1 &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline \n        1 &     &   &     \\\\    \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nPerform an addition in the next column.\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rr} \\\\ &3 \\\\ -1& \\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\n    &\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        1 & -12 & 0 & -42 \\\\\n          &     & 3 &     \\\\\n          &  -1 &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline \n        1 & -13 &   &     \\\\    \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nRepeat the previous two steps '''until you would go past the entries at the top with the next diagonal'''.\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rr} \\\\ &3 \\\\ -1& \\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\n    &\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        1 & -12 &  0 & -42 \\\\\n          &     &  3 & -39 \\\\\n          &  -1 & 13 &     \\\\\n        \\hline \n        1 & -13 & 16 &     \\\\    \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nThen simply add up any remaining columns.\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rr} \\\\ &3 \\\\ -1& \\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\n    &\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        1 & -12 &  0 & -42 \\\\\n          &     &  3 & -39 \\\\\n          &  -1 & 13 &     \\\\\n        \\hline \n        1 & -13 & 16 & -81 \\\\    \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nCount the terms to the left of the bar.  Since there are two, the remainder has degree one and this is the two right-most terms under the bar.

The usual way of doing this would be to divide the divisor <math>g(x)</math> with its leading coefficient (call it ''a''):\n:<math>h(x) = \\frac{g(x)}{a}</math>\n\nthen using synthetic division with <math>h(x)</math> as the divisor, and then dividing the quotient by ''a'' to get the quotient of the original division (the remainder stays the same). But this often produces unsightly fractions which get removed later, and is thus more prone to error. It is possible to do it without first reducing the coefficients of <math>g(x)</math>.\n\nAs can be observed by first performing long division with such a non-monic divisor, the coefficients of <math>f(x)</math> are divided by the leading coefficient of <math>g(x)</math> after \"dropping\", and before multiplying.\n\nLet's illustrate by performing the following division:\n\n:<math>\\frac{6x^3+5x^2-7}{3x^2-2x-1}</math>\n\nA slightly modified table is used:\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rrr} \\\\ &1& \\\\ 2&& \\\\ \\\\&&/3 \\\\ \\end{array}\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        6 & 5 & 0 & -7 \\\\\n          &     &  &     \\\\\n          &    &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline\n          &     &   &     \\\\ \n          &     &   &     \\\\   \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nNote the extra row at the bottom. This is used to write values found by dividing the \"dropped\" values by the leading coefficient of <math>g(x)</math> (in this case, indicated by the ''/3''; note that, unlike the rest of the coefficients of <math>g(x)</math>, the sign of this number is not changed).\n\nNext, the first coefficient of <math>f(x)</math> is dropped as usual:\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rrr} \\\\ &1& \\\\ 2&& \\\\ \\\\&&/3 \\\\ \\end{array}\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        6 & 5 & 0 & -7 \\\\\n          &     &  &     \\\\\n          &    &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline\n        6 &     &   &     \\\\ \n          &     &   &     \\\\   \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nand then the dropped value is divided by 3 and placed in the row below:\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rrr} \\\\ &1& \\\\ 2&& \\\\ \\\\&&/3 \\\\ \\end{array}\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        6 & 5 & 0 & -7 \\\\\n          &     &  &     \\\\\n          &    &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline\n        6 &     &   &     \\\\ \n        2 &     &   &     \\\\   \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nNext, the '''new''' (divided) value is used to fill the top rows with multiples of 2 and 1, as in the expanded technique:\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rrr} \\\\ &1& \\\\ 2&& \\\\ \\\\&&/3 \\\\ \\end{array}\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        6 & 5 & 0 & -7 \\\\\n          &   & 2 &     \\\\\n          & 4 &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline\n        6 &     &   &     \\\\ \n        2 &     &   &     \\\\   \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nThe 5 is dropped next, with the obligatory adding of the 4 below it, and the answer is divided again:\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rrr} \\\\ &1& \\\\ 2&& \\\\ \\\\&&/3 \\\\ \\end{array}\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        6 & 5 & 0 & -7 \\\\\n          &   & 2 &     \\\\\n          & 4 &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline\n        6 & 9   &   &     \\\\ \n        2 & 3   &   &     \\\\   \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nThen the 3 is used to fill the top rows:\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rrr} \\\\ &1& \\\\ 2&& \\\\ \\\\&&/3 \\\\ \\end{array}\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        6 & 5 & 0 & -7 \\\\\n          &   & 2 &  3  \\\\\n          & 4 & 6 &     \\\\\n        \\hline\n        6 & 9 &   &     \\\\ \n        2 & 3 &   &     \\\\   \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nAt this point, if, after getting the third sum, we were to try and use it to fill the top rows, we would \"fall off\" the right side, thus the third sum is the first coefficient of the remainder, as in regular synthetic division. But the values of the remainder are '''not''' divided by the leading coefficient of the divisor:\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rrr} \\\\ &1& \\\\ 2&& \\\\ \\\\&&/3 \\\\ \\end{array}\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        6 & 5 & 0 & -7 \\\\\n          &   & 2 &  3  \\\\\n          & 4 & 6 &     \\\\\n        \\hline\n        6 & 9 & 8 & -4  \\\\ \n        2 & 3 &   &     \\\\   \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nNow we can read off the coefficients of the answer. As in expanded synthetic division, the last two values (2 is the degree of the divisor) are the coefficients of the remainder, and the remaining values are the coefficients of the quotient:\n\n:<math>\t\\begin{array}{rr|rr} \n    2x &  +3 & 8x & -4 \n\\end{array}</math>\n\nand the result is\n\n:<math>\\frac{6x^3+5x^2-7}{3x^2-2x-1} = 2x + 3 + \\frac{8x - 4}{3x^2-2x-1}</math>\n\n=== Compact Expanded Synthetic Division ===\n\nHowever, the '''diagonal''' format above becomes less space-efficient when the degree of the divisor exceeds half of the degree of the dividend. It is easy to see that we have complete freedom to write each product in any row, as long as it is in the correct column. So the algorithm can be '''compactified''' by a '''greedy strategy''', as illustrated in the division below.\n\n:<math>\\dfrac{ax^7+bx^6+cx^5+dx^4+ex^3+fx^2+gx+h}{ix^4-jx^3-kx^2-lx-m}=nx^3+ox^2+px+q+\\dfrac{rx^3+sx^2+tx+u}{ix^4-jx^3-kx^2-lx-m}</math>\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc} \\begin{array}{rrrr} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ j &k & l & m \\\\ \\end{array} & \\begin{array}{|rrrr|rrrr} & & & & qj & & & \\\\ & & & pj & pk & qk & & \\\\ & & oj & ok & ol & pl & ql & \\\\ & nj & nk & nl & nm & om & pm & qm \\\\ a & b & c & d & e & f & g & h \\\\ \\hline a & o_0 & p_0 & q_0 & r & s & t & u \\\\ n & o & p & q & & & & \\\\ \\end{array} \\end{array}</math>\n\nThe following describes how to perform the algorithm; this algorithm includes steps for dividing non-monic divisors:\n\n{{ordered list\n|1=\nWrite the coefficients of the dividend on a bar\n\n<math>\\begin{array}{cc} \\begin{array}{|rrrrrrrr} \\ a & b & c & d & e & f & g & h \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{array}</math>\n\n|2=\nIgnoring the first (leading) coefficient of the divisor, negate each coefficients and place them on the left-hand side of the bar.\n\n<math>\\begin{array}{cc} \\begin{array}{rrrr} j &k & l & m \\\\ \\end{array} & \\begin{array}{|rrrrrrrr}\\ a & b & c & d & e & f & g & h \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{array}</math>\n\n|3=\nFrom the number of coefficients placed on the left side of the bar, count the number of dividend coefficients above the bar, starting from the rightmost column.

Also, the subtractions in long division are converted to additions by switching the signs at the very beginning, preventing sign errors.\n\nSynthetic division for linear denominators is also called division through [[Ruffini's rule]].\n\n== Regular synthetic division ==\nThe first example is synthetic division with only a [[monic polynomial|monic]] linear denominator <math>x-a</math> .\n\n:<math>\\frac{x^3 - 12x^2 - 42}{x - 3}</math>\n\nWrite the coefficients of the polynomial that is to be divided at the top (the zero is for the unseen 0''x'').\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{r} \\\\  \\\\ \\end{array}\n    &\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \\ \n        1 & -12 & 0 & -42 \\\\\n          &     &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nNegate the coefficients of the divisor.\n:<math>\t\\begin{array}{rr} \n     -1x & + 3\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nWrite in every coefficient of the divisor but the first one on the left.\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{r} \\\\ 3 \\\\ \\end{array}\n    &\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \\ \n        1 & -12 & 0 & -42 \\\\\n          &     &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\n\"Drop\" the first coefficient after the bar to the last row.\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{r} \\\\ 3 \\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\n    &\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr}  \n        1 & -12 & 0 & -42 \\\\\n          &     &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline \n        1 &     &   &     \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nMultiply the dropped number by the number before the bar, and place it in the next column.\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{r} \\\\ 3 \\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\n    &\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr}  \n        1 & -12 & 0 & -42 \\\\\n          &   3 &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline \n        1 &     &   &     \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nPerform an addition in the next column.\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ 3 \\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\n    &\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr}  \n        1 & -12 & 0 & -42 \\\\\n          &   3 &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline \n        1 &  -9 &   &     \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nRepeat the previous two steps and the following is obtained:\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ 3 \\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\n    &\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr}  \n        1 & -12 &   0 & -42 \\\\\n          &   3 & -27 & -81 \\\\\n        \\hline \n        1 & -9 & -27 & -123 \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nCount the terms to the left of the bar.

The usual way of doing this would be to divide the divisor <math>g(x)</math> with its leading coefficient (call it ''a''):\n:<math>h(x) = \\frac{g(x)}{a}</math>\n\nthen using synthetic division with <math>h(x)</math> as the divisor, and then dividing the quotient by ''a'' to get the quotient of the original division (the remainder stays the same). But this often produces unsightly fractions which get removed later, and is thus more prone to error. It is possible to do it without first reducing the coefficients of <math>g(x)</math>.\n\nAs can be observed by first performing long division with such a non-monic divisor, the coefficients of <math>f(x)</math> are divided by the leading coefficient of <math>g(x)</math> after \"dropping\", and before multiplying.\n\nLet's illustrate by performing the following division:\n\n:<math>\\frac{6x^3+5x^2-7}{3x^2-2x-1}</math>\n\nA slightly modified table is used:\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rrr} \\\\ &1& \\\\ 2&& \\\\ \\\\&&/3 \\\\ \\end{array}\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        6 & 5 & 0 & -7 \\\\\n          &     &  &     \\\\\n          &    &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline\n          &     &   &     \\\\ \n          &     &   &     \\\\   \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nNote the extra row at the bottom. This is used to write values found by dividing the \"dropped\" values by the leading coefficient of <math>g(x)</math> (in this case, indicated by the ''/3''; note that, unlike the rest of the coefficients of <math>g(x)</math>, the sign of this number is not changed).\n\nNext, the first coefficient of <math>f(x)</math> is dropped as usual:\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rrr} \\\\ &1& \\\\ 2&& \\\\ \\\\&&/3 \\\\ \\end{array}\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        6 & 5 & 0 & -7 \\\\\n          &     &  &     \\\\\n          &    &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline\n        6 &     &   &     \\\\ \n          &     &   &     \\\\   \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nand then the dropped value is divided by 3 and placed in the row below:\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rrr} \\\\ &1& \\\\ 2&& \\\\ \\\\&&/3 \\\\ \\end{array}\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        6 & 5 & 0 & -7 \\\\\n          &     &  &     \\\\\n          &    &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline\n        6 &     &   &     \\\\ \n        2 &     &   &     \\\\   \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nNext, the '''new''' (divided) value is used to fill the top rows with multiples of 2 and 1, as in the expanded technique:\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rrr} \\\\ &1& \\\\ 2&& \\\\ \\\\&&/3 \\\\ \\end{array}\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        6 & 5 & 0 & -7 \\\\\n          &   & 2 &     \\\\\n          & 4 &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline\n        6 &     &   &     \\\\ \n        2 &     &   &     \\\\   \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nThe 5 is dropped next, with the obligatory adding of the 4 below it, and the answer is divided again:\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rrr} \\\\ &1& \\\\ 2&& \\\\ \\\\&&/3 \\\\ \\end{array}\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        6 & 5 & 0 & -7 \\\\\n          &   & 2 &     \\\\\n          & 4 &   &     \\\\\n        \\hline\n        6 & 9   &   &     \\\\ \n        2 & 3   &   &     \\\\   \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nThen the 3 is used to fill the top rows:\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rrr} \\\\ &1& \\\\ 2&& \\\\ \\\\&&/3 \\\\ \\end{array}\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        6 & 5 & 0 & -7 \\\\\n          &   & 2 &  3  \\\\\n          & 4 & 6 &     \\\\\n        \\hline\n        6 & 9 &   &     \\\\ \n        2 & 3 &   &     \\\\   \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nAt this point, if, after getting the third sum, we were to try and use it to fill the top rows, we would \"fall off\" the right side, thus the third sum is the first coefficient of the remainder, as in regular synthetic division. But the values of the remainder are '''not''' divided by the leading coefficient of the divisor:\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\begin{array}{rrr} \\\\ &1& \\\\ 2&& \\\\ \\\\&&/3 \\\\ \\end{array}\n    \\begin{array}{|rrrr} \n        6 & 5 & 0 & -7 \\\\\n          &   & 2 &  3  \\\\\n          & 4 & 6 &     \\\\\n        \\hline\n        6 & 9 & 8 & -4  \\\\ \n        2 & 3 &   &     \\\\   \n    \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nNow we can read off the coefficients of the answer. As in expanded synthetic division, the last two values (2 is the degree of the divisor) are the coefficients of the remainder, and the remaining values are the coefficients of the quotient:\n\n:<math>\t\\begin{array}{rr|rr} \n    2x &  +3 & 8x & -4 \n\\end{array}</math>\n\nand the result is\n\n:<math>\\frac{6x^3+5x^2-7}{3x^2-2x-1} = 2x + 3 + \\frac{8x - 4}{3x^2-2x-1}</math>\n\n=== Compact Expanded Synthetic Division ===\n\nHowever, the '''diagonal''' format above becomes less space-efficient when the degree of the divisor exceeds half of the degree of the dividend. It is easy to see that we have complete freedom to write each product in any row, as long as it is in the correct column. So the algorithm can be '''compactified''' by a '''greedy strategy''', as illustrated in the division below.\n\n:<math>\\dfrac{ax^7+bx^6+cx^5+dx^4+ex^3+fx^2+gx+h}{ix^4-jx^3-kx^2-lx-m}=nx^3+ox^2+px+q+\\dfrac{rx^3+sx^2+tx+u}{ix^4-jx^3-kx^2-lx-m}</math>\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cc} \\begin{array}{rrrr} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ j &k & l & m \\\\ \\end{array} & \\begin{array}{|rrrr|rrrr} & & & & qj & & & \\\\ & & & pj & pk & qk & & \\\\ & & oj & ok & ol & pl & ql & \\\\ & nj & nk & nl & nm & om & pm & qm \\\\ a & b & c & d & e & f & g & h \\\\ \\hline a & o_0 & p_0 & q_0 & r & s & t & u \\\\ n & o & p & q & & & & \\\\ \\end{array} \\end{array}</math>\n\nThe following describes how to perform the algorithm; this algorithm includes steps for dividing non-monic divisors:\n\n{{ordered list\n|1=\nWrite the coefficients of the dividend on a bar\n\n<math>\\begin{array}{cc} \\begin{array}{|rrrrrrrr} \\ a & b & c & d & e & f & g & h \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{array}</math>\n\n|2=\nIgnoring the first (leading) coefficient of the divisor, negate each coefficients and place them on the left-hand side of the bar.\n\n<math>\\begin{array}{cc} \\begin{array}{rrrr} j &k & l & m \\\\ \\end{array} & \\begin{array}{|rrrrrrrr}\\ a & b & c & d & e & f & g & h \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{array}</math>\n\n|3=\nFrom the number of coefficients placed on the left side of the bar, count the number of dividend coefficients above the bar, starting from the rightmost column.

This contrasts to [[bolt action|bolt-action]], [[Pump action|pump-action]], [[semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]], or [[selective fire|selective-fire]] weapons. Most lever-action firearms are [[rifle]]s, but some lever-action [[shotgun]]s and a few [[pistol]]s have also been made. The [[Winchester Model 1873]] rifle is one of the most famous lever-action firearms, but many manufacturers\u2014notably [[Henry Repeating Arms|Henry]] and [[Marlin Firearms|Marlin]]\u2014also produce lever-action rifles. The [[Winchester Model 1887]], a well-known lever-action shotgun gained notoriety for being one of the signature weapons of [[Terminator (character)|the T-800 (Model 101)]] in the [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'']] movie franchise. Even [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt's Mfg. Co.]] produced the 6403 lever-action [[Colt-Burgess rifle]]s from 1883 until 1885. [[O.F. Mossberg & Sons|Mossberg]] produces the 464 in [[Centerfire ammunition|centerfire]] .30-30 and [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] .22. While the term ''lever action'' generally implies a repeating firearm, it is also sometimes\u2014and incorrectly{{according to whom|date=November 2018}}\u2014applied to a variety of single shot or [[falling block action]]s that use a lever for cycling, such as the [[Martini\u2013Henry]] or the [[Ruger No. 1]].\n[[Image:Spencer Carbine 2.JPG|thumb|Spencer-carbine M1865, .50 inch]]\n[[Image:Colt Burgess open.JPG|thumb|Colt-Burgess rifle]]\n\n==History==\nIn 1826, a lever-action revolver, which could shoot all six shots in less than six seconds, was produced in Italy by a Cesar Rosaglio and patented in 1829.<ref>https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pfsZAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA72&lpg=RA1-PA72&dq=Rosaglio&source=bl&ots=LP8r6rJ5uM&sig=ACfU3U2NWtOfwMGiVgFSjFwIVWW25l068Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi54Pua7YXlAhWMERQKHdTUBCw4ChDoATAJegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=Rosaglio&f=false</ref>\n\n[[File:Colt 2nd Paterson Rifle.jpg|thumb|Colt Paterson Ring Lever rifle]] \nThe first lever-action rifles on the market were likely the [[Colt Ring Lever rifles|Colt's 1st and 2nd Model Ring Lever rifles]], both [[cap and ball]] rifles, produced by the [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Patent Arms Mfg. Co. Paterson, N.J.-Colt's Patent]] between 1837 and 1841. The ring lever was located in front of the trigger. This loading lever, when pulled, would index the cylinder to the next position and cock the internal hidden hammer.\n\nMultiple lever-action designs including the [[Volcanic pistol]] were designed before the American Civil War, but the first significant lever-action designs were the [[Spencer repeating rifle]] and [[Henry rifle]]. The Spencer was a magazine fed, lever operated, breech loading rifle designed by [[Christopher Spencer]] in 1860. It was fed from a removable seven round tube magazine, enabling the rounds to be fired one after another, and which, when emptied, could be exchanged for another. Over 20,000 were made, and it was adopted by the United States and used during the [[American Civil War]], marking the first adoption of a removable, magazine fed infantry and cavalry rifle by any country.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Unlike later designs, the early Spencer's lever only served to unlock the falling block action and load a new cartridge from the magazine; it did not cock the hammer, and thus the hammer had to be cocked after the lever was operated to prepare the rifle to fire.\n\nThe [[Henry rifle]], invented by [[Benjamin Tyler Henry]], a gunsmith employed by [[Oliver Winchester]] in 1860, used a centrally located hammer, rather than the offset hammer typical of [[muzzleloading]] rifles, and this hammer was cocked by the rearward movement of the Henry's bolt. The Henry also placed the magazine under the barrel, rather than in the buttstock, a trend followed by most tubular magazines since.\n\n[[Image:Marlin39receiver.jpg|right|thumb|Inside of [[Marlin 39A]] receiver]]\nJohn Marlin, founder of [[Marlin Firearms]] Company, New Haven, Connecticut, introduced Marlin's first lever-action repeating rifle as the Model 1881. This was chambered in rounds such as the 45/70 and 38/55. Its successor was the 1895 solid top design, which we know as the model 336 today. It also gave rise to the [[Marlin Model 1894]], which is still in production today.\n\nBy the 1890s, lever actions had evolved into a form that would last for over a century. Both Marlin and Winchester released new model lever-action rifles in 1894. The Marlin rifle is still in production, whereas production of the Winchester 94 ceased in 2006. While externally similar, the Marlin and Winchester rifles are quite different internally; the Marlin has a single-stage lever action, while the Winchester has a double-stage lever. The double-stage action is easily seen when the Winchester's lever is operated, as first the entire trigger group drops down, unlocking the bolt, and then the bolt is moved rearward to eject the fired cartridge.\n\n[[File:Savage 99.jpg|thumb|Savage Model 99 rifle]]\nThe fledgling [[Savage Arms Company]] became well known after the development of its popular hammerless Models 1895 and 1899 (which became named the Model 99) lever-action sporting rifles. The Models 1899/99 were produced from introduction in 1899 until the expense of producing the rifle, and declining interest in lever-action rifles from the 1950s on, resulted in dropping the Model 99 from production in 2000. Unlike most Winchester and the Marlin lever-action rifles, which used a tubular magazine requiring round nose or flat nose bullets, Arthur Savage designed his rifle using a rotary magazine. This allowed the 99 to use cartridges with spitzer pointed bullets for increased ballistic performance. The 99 was produced in many different cartridges and several different model variations. The final models eliminated the very expensive to produce rotary magazine, using a detachable box magazine instead. But the 99 was still very expensive to produce when compared to the other lever-action rifles, and the Savage bolt-action rifles and economics determined the fate of the rifle.\n\nMore recently, Sturm Ruger and Company introduced a number of new lever-action designs in the 1990s, unusual because most lever-action designs date from before [[World War II]], in the period before reliable [[semi-automatic rifle]]s became widely available.\n\n==Usage in warfare==\nThe Henry Lever Action was used in the US Civil War. Henry Lever Action firearms were used in the US until the Winchester Model 1866 rifle replaced it. The Spencer repeating rifle was also used in the US Civil War. \nAdditionally, rifles using the lever-action design were used extensively during the 1930s by irregular forces in the Spanish Civil War. Typically, these were Winchesters or Winchester copies of Spanish manufacture. At least 9,000 Model 1895 rifles are known to have been provided by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1936 to the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Spanish Republicans]] for use in the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref name=\"arc5\">{{cite book |last1=Mercaldo |first1=Luke |last2=Firestone |first2=Adam |last3=Vanderlinden |first3=Anthony |title=Allied Rifle Contracts in America |year=2011 |publisher=Wet Dog Publications |isbn=0-9707997-7-2 |page=83}}</ref> Both the Russian Empire and the United States adopted the [[Winchester Model 1895]] as a military weapon.<ref name=\"arc1\">{{cite book |last1=Mercaldo |first1=Luke |last2=Firestone |first2=Adam |last3=Vanderlinden |first3=Anthony |title=Allied Rifle Contracts in America |year=2011 |publisher=Wet Dog Publications |isbn=0-9707997-7-2 |pages=77\u201378}}</ref>\n\n===Lever-action shotguns===\n[[Image:M1887 LH.JPG|thumb|300px|A modern reproduction of the [[Winchester Model 1887]] lever-action shotgun]]\nEarly attempts at repeating shotguns invariably centered around either bolt-action or lever-action designs, drawing obvious inspiration from the repeating rifles of the time. \nThe earliest successful repeating shotgun was the lever-action [[Winchester Model 1887]], designed by [[John Browning]] in 1885 at the behest of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, who wanted to market a repeating shotgun. The lever-action design was chosen for reasons of [[brand recognition]], Winchester being best known for manufacturing lever-action firearms at the time, despite the protestations of Browning, who pointed out that a [[slide action]] design would be much better for a shotgun. Initially chambered for [[black powder]] shotgun shells (as was standard at the time), the Model 1887 gave rise to the Winchester Model 1901, a strengthened version chambered for 10ga [[smokeless powder]] shells. Their popularity waned after the introduction of [[slide action]] shotguns such as the [[Winchester Model 1897]], and production was discontinued in 1920. Modern reproductions are (or have been), however, manufactured by Armi Chiappa in Italy, [[Norinco]] in [[China]] and [[ADI Ltd.]] in [[Australia]], while Winchester continued to manufacture the .410 bore Model 9410, effectively a Winchester Model 94 chambered for .410 bore shotgun shells, until 2006.\n\nFrench Firearm Manufacturer Verny-Carron has released its Stop and Go lever-action shotgun called the Veloce.  It is a unique action which self-unloads a fired cartridge but requires a side-mounted lever to allow the shotgun to reload and reset the trigger.\n\nAustralian firearm laws strictly control pump and semi-automatic actions. Lever operation falls into a more lenient category, hence the recent popularity of the action in that country.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Salna |first1=Karlis |title=Imports of Adler shotgun pouring into Australia |url=https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2016/03/04/imports-adler-shotgun-pouring-aust/ |accessdate=8 March 2020 |work=The New Daily |date=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===On other applications===\n[[Image:M1895 diagram.jpg|thumb|right|300px|M1895 operating mechanism showing the lever in the forward (top) and rear (bottom) positions]]\nA one-off example of lever-action reloading on automatic firearms is the [[M1895 Colt\u2013Browning machine gun]]. This weapon had a swinging lever beneath its barrel that was actuated by a gas bleed in the barrel, unlocking the breech to reload. This unique operation gave the nickname \"potato digger,\" as the lever swung each time the weapon fired and would dig into the ground if the weapon was not situated high enough on its mount.\n\nThe [[Kn\u00f6tgen automatic rifle]] is another example.\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages==\nWhile lever-action rifles have always been popular with hunters and sporting shooters, they have not been widely accepted by the military. One significant reason for this is that it is harder to fire from the [[prone position]] with a lever-action rifle than it is with a straight pull or rotating bolt [[bolt action|bolt-action]] rifle. Another reason is ammunition. While lever-action rifles generally possess a greater rate of fire than bolt-action rifles, lever-action firearms are also generally fed from a tubular magazine, similar to the one used on the first bolt-action rifle, which limits the type of ammunition that can be used in them. Pointed centerfire \"[[Spitzer (bullet)|spitzer]]\" bullets, for example, can cause explosions in a tubular magazine, as the point of each cartridge's projectile rests on the primer of the next cartridge in the magazine. Some modern cartridges, such as the [[elastomer]]-tipped [[Hornady]] LEVERevolution ammunition overcome this problem.<ref>{{citation|title=Seven revolution: it's not your grandpa's .30-30 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_2_53/ai_n27106245/ |author=John Taffin |work=Guns Magazine |date=February 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609104438/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_2_53/ai_n27106245/ |archive-date=2010-06-09 |df= }}</ref> The tubular magazine may also have a negative impact on the harmonics of the barrel, which limits the theoretical accuracy of the rifle. A tubular magazine under the barrel also pushes the center of gravity forward, which alters the balance of the rifle in ways that are undesirable for shooting off hand from a standing position to some shooters. There are, however, some lever-action rifles\u2014such as the [[Winchester Model 1895]], which saw service with the Russian Army in World War I\u2014that use a box magazine.\n\nMany newer lever-action rifles are capable of shooting groups smaller than 1 minute of angle, making them equal to the accuracy of most modern bolt-action rifles.\n[[File:Henry Rifle Receiver open.JPG|thumb|Henry rifle, toggle-lock]]\nAnother explanation for the lack of widespread use of lever-action designs stems from the initial inability to fire high-pressure cartridges. Safe operation could only be carried out by using low-pressure cartridges in the toggle-lock lever-action rifles such as the [[Henry rifle]] and the following [[Winchester Model 1866]], [[Winchester Model 1873|Model 73]] and [[Winchester Model 1876|Model 76]] (which was used by the mounted police of Canada). The new lever-action designs, notably the [[Winchester Model 1886]], [[Winchester Model 1892|Model 92]] [[Winchester Model 1894|Model 94]] and the [[Winchester Model 1895|Model 1895]] (in [[7.62x54R]], a Russian military cartridge), with a strong locking-block action designed by [[John Moses Browning]], were capable of firing higher-pressure cartridges. These rifles became available in the late 19th century, too expensive  to build new factories to manufacture, militaries worldwide had put cheap bolt-action rifles into service and were unwilling to invest into producing a lever-action rifle after having done with an inexpensive bolt-action design.\n\nDue to the higher rate of fire and shorter overall length than most bolt-action rifles, lever actions have remained popular to this day for sporting use, especially short- and medium-range [[hunting]] in forests, scrub, or bushland. Lever-action firearms have also been used in some quantity by prison guards in the United States, as well as by wildlife authorities/game wardens in many parts of the world.\n\nAn additional advantage over typical [[Bolt action|bolt-action]] rifles is the lack of [[handedness]]: lever actions, like pump actions, are frequently recommended as ambidextrous in sporting guidebooks.\n\n==Cartridges==\nThe cartridges for lever-action rifles have a wide variety of calibres, bullet shapes and powder loads, but they fall into two basic categories: Low-pressure cartridges with rounded bullets, and high-pressure cartridges with aerodynamic pointed (\"spitzer\") bullets.\n\nSome lever actions are not as strong as bolt action or semi-automatic rifle actions. The weaker actions utilize low- and medium-pressure cartridges, somewhat similar to high-powered pistol ammunition. To increase the bullet's energy at the relatively low velocities, these often have larger, heavier bullets than other types of rifles. The most common cartridge is the [[.30-30]], introduced by Winchester with the Model 1894. Other common cartridges include: [[.38 Special]]/[[.357 Magnum]], [[.44 Special]]/[[.44 Magnum]], [[.41 Magnum]], [[.444 Marlin]], [[.45-70]], [[.45 Colt]], [[.32-20 Winchester]], [[.35 Remington]], [[.308 Marlin Express]], [[.22 calibre]] [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]], and [[.300 Savage]]. There is dispute about which of these cartridges can safely be used to hunt large game or large predators. Even in the largest calibres, the low velocities give these cartridges much lower energies than [[.450 Nitro Express|Elephant gun cartridges with comparable calibres]]. However, even the smallest cartridges fit lightweight, handy rifles that can be excellent for hunting small herbivores, pest control, and personal defense.\n\nSome stronger, larger pistols (usually [[revolvers]]) also accept some of these cartridges, permitting use of the same ammunition in both a pistol and rifle. The rifle's longer barrel and better accuracy permits higher velocities, longer ranges and a wider selection of game. A pistol provides extra security.\n\nSome of these cartridges (e.g. the .45-70) are developmental descendants of very early black powder metallic cartridges. When metallic cartridges and lever actions were first invented, very small, portable kits were developed for hand reloading and bullet molding (so called \"cowboy reloading kits\"). These kits are still available for most low-pressure lever-action cartridges.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Best Portable Reloading Press|url=http://www.reloaderaddict.com/the-best-portable-reloading-press-for-the-money/|website=Reloader Addict|accessdate=29 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nStronger lever actions, such as the action of the [[Marlin Model 1894]] can utilize high-pressure cartridges. Lever-action designs with strong, rotary locking bolts (such as the [[Browning BLR]] with seven locking lugs) safely use very high-powered cartridges like the .300 Winchester mag, .300 WSM and 7 MM Remington magnum.  Tilting block designs such as the [[Savage Model 99]] are also strong enough to handle high pressures.\n\nMany lever actions have a tubular magazine under the barrel. To operate safely, cartridges for these have bullets with rounded tips, and some use rimfire primers rather than centerfire primers. The safety problem is that long range aerodynamic supersonic bullets are pointed. In a tubular magazine the points can accidentally fire centerfire cartridges.  A related problem is that some pointed bullets have fragile tips, and can be damaged in a tubular magazine. So, some lever actions such as the [[Savage Model 99]] can be fed from either box or rotary magazines. The [[Winchester Model 1895]] also uses a box magazine, and is chambered for [[.30-06]] and other powerful military cartridges. More recently, spitzer bullets with elastomeric tips have been developed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spitzer Bullets for .30-30 Reloaders: Boing, Boing, Boing!|url=http://www.realguns.com/Commentary/comar178.htm|website=Real Guns|accessdate=29 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nLever-action shotguns such as the Winchester Model 1887 were chambered in 10 or 12 gauge [[black powder]] shotgun shells, whereas the Model 1901 was chambered for 10 gauge smokeless shotshells. Modern reproductions are chambered for 12 gauge smokeless shells, while the Winchester Model 9410 shotgun is available in [[.410 bore]].\n\n==Other long gun actions==\n*[[Bolt action]]\n*[[Pump action]]\n*[[Break action]]\n*[[Falling-block action]]\n*[[Rolling block]]\n*[[Semi-automatic rifle]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Antique guns]]\n*[[Colt-Burgess rifle]]\n*[[Henry Rifle]]\n*[[Marlin 336]]\n*[[Martini\u2013Henry]]\n*[[Mossberg model 464]]\n*[[Savage Model 99]]\n*[[Spencer repeating rifle]]\n*[[Volcanic Repeating Arms]]\n*[[Winchester rifle]]\n*[[Winchester M1887]]\n*[[Rapid fire crossbow]], a conceptually similar weapon from Leonardo Da Vinci's work\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080905053313/http://www.rifleshootermag.com/featured_rifles/all_american_levergun/ The All-American Lever Gun - Rifle Shooter ](dead link)\n* Hunting with lever-action rifle (dead link)\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lever-Action}}\n[[Category:Firearm actions]]\n[[Category:Lever-action shotguns| Lever-action]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2017}}\n{{cleanup|reason=poor grammar, incorrect and incomplete data|date=March 2017}}\n}}\n\n'''Lever action''' is a type of [[firearm]] [[Action (firearms)|action]] which uses a lever located around the trigger guard area (often including the trigger guard itself) to load fresh [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]] into the [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]] of the [[Barrel (firearms)|barrel]] when the lever is worked.

The [[Winchester Model 1887]], a well-known lever-action shotgun gained notoriety for being one of the signature weapons of [[Terminator (character)|the T-800 (Model 101)]] in the [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'']] movie franchise. Even [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt's Mfg. Co.]] produced the 6403 lever-action [[Colt-Burgess rifle]]s from 1883 until 1885. [[O.F. Mossberg & Sons|Mossberg]] produces the 464 in [[Centerfire ammunition|centerfire]] .30-30 and [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] .22. While the term ''lever action'' generally implies a repeating firearm, it is also sometimes\u2014and incorrectly{{according to whom|date=November 2018}}\u2014applied to a variety of single shot or [[falling block action]]s that use a lever for cycling, such as the [[Martini\u2013Henry]] or the [[Ruger No. 1]].\n[[Image:Spencer Carbine 2.JPG|thumb|Spencer-carbine M1865, .50 inch]]\n[[Image:Colt Burgess open.JPG|thumb|Colt-Burgess rifle]]\n\n==History==\nIn 1826, a lever-action revolver, which could shoot all six shots in less than six seconds, was produced in Italy by a Cesar Rosaglio and patented in 1829.<ref>https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pfsZAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA72&lpg=RA1-PA72&dq=Rosaglio&source=bl&ots=LP8r6rJ5uM&sig=ACfU3U2NWtOfwMGiVgFSjFwIVWW25l068Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi54Pua7YXlAhWMERQKHdTUBCw4ChDoATAJegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=Rosaglio&f=false</ref>\n\n[[File:Colt 2nd Paterson Rifle.jpg|thumb|Colt Paterson Ring Lever rifle]] \nThe first lever-action rifles on the market were likely the [[Colt Ring Lever rifles|Colt's 1st and 2nd Model Ring Lever rifles]], both [[cap and ball]] rifles, produced by the [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Patent Arms Mfg. Co. Paterson, N.J.-Colt's Patent]] between 1837 and 1841. The ring lever was located in front of the trigger. This loading lever, when pulled, would index the cylinder to the next position and cock the internal hidden hammer.\n\nMultiple lever-action designs including the [[Volcanic pistol]] were designed before the American Civil War, but the first significant lever-action designs were the [[Spencer repeating rifle]] and [[Henry rifle]]. The Spencer was a magazine fed, lever operated, breech loading rifle designed by [[Christopher Spencer]] in 1860. It was fed from a removable seven round tube magazine, enabling the rounds to be fired one after another, and which, when emptied, could be exchanged for another. Over 20,000 were made, and it was adopted by the United States and used during the [[American Civil War]], marking the first adoption of a removable, magazine fed infantry and cavalry rifle by any country.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Unlike later designs, the early Spencer's lever only served to unlock the falling block action and load a new cartridge from the magazine; it did not cock the hammer, and thus the hammer had to be cocked after the lever was operated to prepare the rifle to fire.\n\nThe [[Henry rifle]], invented by [[Benjamin Tyler Henry]], a gunsmith employed by [[Oliver Winchester]] in 1860, used a centrally located hammer, rather than the offset hammer typical of [[muzzleloading]] rifles, and this hammer was cocked by the rearward movement of the Henry's bolt. The Henry also placed the magazine under the barrel, rather than in the buttstock, a trend followed by most tubular magazines since.\n\n[[Image:Marlin39receiver.jpg|right|thumb|Inside of [[Marlin 39A]] receiver]]\nJohn Marlin, founder of [[Marlin Firearms]] Company, New Haven, Connecticut, introduced Marlin's first lever-action repeating rifle as the Model 1881. This was chambered in rounds such as the 45/70 and 38/55. Its successor was the 1895 solid top design, which we know as the model 336 today. It also gave rise to the [[Marlin Model 1894]], which is still in production today.\n\nBy the 1890s, lever actions had evolved into a form that would last for over a century. Both Marlin and Winchester released new model lever-action rifles in 1894. The Marlin rifle is still in production, whereas production of the Winchester 94 ceased in 2006. While externally similar, the Marlin and Winchester rifles are quite different internally; the Marlin has a single-stage lever action, while the Winchester has a double-stage lever. The double-stage action is easily seen when the Winchester's lever is operated, as first the entire trigger group drops down, unlocking the bolt, and then the bolt is moved rearward to eject the fired cartridge.\n\n[[File:Savage 99.jpg|thumb|Savage Model 99 rifle]]\nThe fledgling [[Savage Arms Company]] became well known after the development of its popular hammerless Models 1895 and 1899 (which became named the Model 99) lever-action sporting rifles. The Models 1899/99 were produced from introduction in 1899 until the expense of producing the rifle, and declining interest in lever-action rifles from the 1950s on, resulted in dropping the Model 99 from production in 2000. Unlike most Winchester and the Marlin lever-action rifles, which used a tubular magazine requiring round nose or flat nose bullets, Arthur Savage designed his rifle using a rotary magazine. This allowed the 99 to use cartridges with spitzer pointed bullets for increased ballistic performance. The 99 was produced in many different cartridges and several different model variations. The final models eliminated the very expensive to produce rotary magazine, using a detachable box magazine instead. But the 99 was still very expensive to produce when compared to the other lever-action rifles, and the Savage bolt-action rifles and economics determined the fate of the rifle.\n\nMore recently, Sturm Ruger and Company introduced a number of new lever-action designs in the 1990s, unusual because most lever-action designs date from before [[World War II]], in the period before reliable [[semi-automatic rifle]]s became widely available.\n\n==Usage in warfare==\nThe Henry Lever Action was used in the US Civil War. Henry Lever Action firearms were used in the US until the Winchester Model 1866 rifle replaced it. The Spencer repeating rifle was also used in the US Civil War. \nAdditionally, rifles using the lever-action design were used extensively during the 1930s by irregular forces in the Spanish Civil War. Typically, these were Winchesters or Winchester copies of Spanish manufacture. At least 9,000 Model 1895 rifles are known to have been provided by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1936 to the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Spanish Republicans]] for use in the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref name=\"arc5\">{{cite book |last1=Mercaldo |first1=Luke |last2=Firestone |first2=Adam |last3=Vanderlinden |first3=Anthony |title=Allied Rifle Contracts in America |year=2011 |publisher=Wet Dog Publications |isbn=0-9707997-7-2 |page=83}}</ref> Both the Russian Empire and the United States adopted the [[Winchester Model 1895]] as a military weapon.<ref name=\"arc1\">{{cite book |last1=Mercaldo |first1=Luke |last2=Firestone |first2=Adam |last3=Vanderlinden |first3=Anthony |title=Allied Rifle Contracts in America |year=2011 |publisher=Wet Dog Publications |isbn=0-9707997-7-2 |pages=77\u201378}}</ref>\n\n===Lever-action shotguns===\n[[Image:M1887 LH.JPG|thumb|300px|A modern reproduction of the [[Winchester Model 1887]] lever-action shotgun]]\nEarly attempts at repeating shotguns invariably centered around either bolt-action or lever-action designs, drawing obvious inspiration from the repeating rifles of the time. \nThe earliest successful repeating shotgun was the lever-action [[Winchester Model 1887]], designed by [[John Browning]] in 1885 at the behest of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, who wanted to market a repeating shotgun. The lever-action design was chosen for reasons of [[brand recognition]], Winchester being best known for manufacturing lever-action firearms at the time, despite the protestations of Browning, who pointed out that a [[slide action]] design would be much better for a shotgun. Initially chambered for [[black powder]] shotgun shells (as was standard at the time), the Model 1887 gave rise to the Winchester Model 1901, a strengthened version chambered for 10ga [[smokeless powder]] shells. Their popularity waned after the introduction of [[slide action]] shotguns such as the [[Winchester Model 1897]], and production was discontinued in 1920. Modern reproductions are (or have been), however, manufactured by Armi Chiappa in Italy, [[Norinco]] in [[China]] and [[ADI Ltd.]] in [[Australia]], while Winchester continued to manufacture the .410 bore Model 9410, effectively a Winchester Model 94 chambered for .410 bore shotgun shells, until 2006.\n\nFrench Firearm Manufacturer Verny-Carron has released its Stop and Go lever-action shotgun called the Veloce.  It is a unique action which self-unloads a fired cartridge but requires a side-mounted lever to allow the shotgun to reload and reset the trigger.\n\nAustralian firearm laws strictly control pump and semi-automatic actions. Lever operation falls into a more lenient category, hence the recent popularity of the action in that country.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Salna |first1=Karlis |title=Imports of Adler shotgun pouring into Australia |url=https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2016/03/04/imports-adler-shotgun-pouring-aust/ |accessdate=8 March 2020 |work=The New Daily |date=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===On other applications===\n[[Image:M1895 diagram.jpg|thumb|right|300px|M1895 operating mechanism showing the lever in the forward (top) and rear (bottom) positions]]\nA one-off example of lever-action reloading on automatic firearms is the [[M1895 Colt\u2013Browning machine gun]]. This weapon had a swinging lever beneath its barrel that was actuated by a gas bleed in the barrel, unlocking the breech to reload. This unique operation gave the nickname \"potato digger,\" as the lever swung each time the weapon fired and would dig into the ground if the weapon was not situated high enough on its mount.\n\nThe [[Kn\u00f6tgen automatic rifle]] is another example.\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages==\nWhile lever-action rifles have always been popular with hunters and sporting shooters, they have not been widely accepted by the military. One significant reason for this is that it is harder to fire from the [[prone position]] with a lever-action rifle than it is with a straight pull or rotating bolt [[bolt action|bolt-action]] rifle. Another reason is ammunition. While lever-action rifles generally possess a greater rate of fire than bolt-action rifles, lever-action firearms are also generally fed from a tubular magazine, similar to the one used on the first bolt-action rifle, which limits the type of ammunition that can be used in them. Pointed centerfire \"[[Spitzer (bullet)|spitzer]]\" bullets, for example, can cause explosions in a tubular magazine, as the point of each cartridge's projectile rests on the primer of the next cartridge in the magazine. Some modern cartridges, such as the [[elastomer]]-tipped [[Hornady]] LEVERevolution ammunition overcome this problem.<ref>{{citation|title=Seven revolution: it's not your grandpa's .30-30 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_2_53/ai_n27106245/ |author=John Taffin |work=Guns Magazine |date=February 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609104438/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_2_53/ai_n27106245/ |archive-date=2010-06-09 |df= }}</ref> The tubular magazine may also have a negative impact on the harmonics of the barrel, which limits the theoretical accuracy of the rifle. A tubular magazine under the barrel also pushes the center of gravity forward, which alters the balance of the rifle in ways that are undesirable for shooting off hand from a standing position to some shooters. There are, however, some lever-action rifles\u2014such as the [[Winchester Model 1895]], which saw service with the Russian Army in World War I\u2014that use a box magazine.\n\nMany newer lever-action rifles are capable of shooting groups smaller than 1 minute of angle, making them equal to the accuracy of most modern bolt-action rifles.\n[[File:Henry Rifle Receiver open.JPG|thumb|Henry rifle, toggle-lock]]\nAnother explanation for the lack of widespread use of lever-action designs stems from the initial inability to fire high-pressure cartridges. Safe operation could only be carried out by using low-pressure cartridges in the toggle-lock lever-action rifles such as the [[Henry rifle]] and the following [[Winchester Model 1866]], [[Winchester Model 1873|Model 73]] and [[Winchester Model 1876|Model 76]] (which was used by the mounted police of Canada). The new lever-action designs, notably the [[Winchester Model 1886]], [[Winchester Model 1892|Model 92]] [[Winchester Model 1894|Model 94]] and the [[Winchester Model 1895|Model 1895]] (in [[7.62x54R]], a Russian military cartridge), with a strong locking-block action designed by [[John Moses Browning]], were capable of firing higher-pressure cartridges. These rifles became available in the late 19th century, too expensive  to build new factories to manufacture, militaries worldwide had put cheap bolt-action rifles into service and were unwilling to invest into producing a lever-action rifle after having done with an inexpensive bolt-action design.\n\nDue to the higher rate of fire and shorter overall length than most bolt-action rifles, lever actions have remained popular to this day for sporting use, especially short- and medium-range [[hunting]] in forests, scrub, or bushland. Lever-action firearms have also been used in some quantity by prison guards in the United States, as well as by wildlife authorities/game wardens in many parts of the world.\n\nAn additional advantage over typical [[Bolt action|bolt-action]] rifles is the lack of [[handedness]]: lever actions, like pump actions, are frequently recommended as ambidextrous in sporting guidebooks.\n\n==Cartridges==\nThe cartridges for lever-action rifles have a wide variety of calibres, bullet shapes and powder loads, but they fall into two basic categories: Low-pressure cartridges with rounded bullets, and high-pressure cartridges with aerodynamic pointed (\"spitzer\") bullets.\n\nSome lever actions are not as strong as bolt action or semi-automatic rifle actions. The weaker actions utilize low- and medium-pressure cartridges, somewhat similar to high-powered pistol ammunition. To increase the bullet's energy at the relatively low velocities, these often have larger, heavier bullets than other types of rifles. The most common cartridge is the [[.30-30]], introduced by Winchester with the Model 1894. Other common cartridges include: [[.38 Special]]/[[.357 Magnum]], [[.44 Special]]/[[.44 Magnum]], [[.41 Magnum]], [[.444 Marlin]], [[.45-70]], [[.45 Colt]], [[.32-20 Winchester]], [[.35 Remington]], [[.308 Marlin Express]], [[.22 calibre]] [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]], and [[.300 Savage]]. There is dispute about which of these cartridges can safely be used to hunt large game or large predators. Even in the largest calibres, the low velocities give these cartridges much lower energies than [[.450 Nitro Express|Elephant gun cartridges with comparable calibres]]. However, even the smallest cartridges fit lightweight, handy rifles that can be excellent for hunting small herbivores, pest control, and personal defense.\n\nSome stronger, larger pistols (usually [[revolvers]]) also accept some of these cartridges, permitting use of the same ammunition in both a pistol and rifle. The rifle's longer barrel and better accuracy permits higher velocities, longer ranges and a wider selection of game. A pistol provides extra security.\n\nSome of these cartridges (e.g. the .45-70) are developmental descendants of very early black powder metallic cartridges. When metallic cartridges and lever actions were first invented, very small, portable kits were developed for hand reloading and bullet molding (so called \"cowboy reloading kits\"). These kits are still available for most low-pressure lever-action cartridges.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Best Portable Reloading Press|url=http://www.reloaderaddict.com/the-best-portable-reloading-press-for-the-money/|website=Reloader Addict|accessdate=29 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nStronger lever actions, such as the action of the [[Marlin Model 1894]] can utilize high-pressure cartridges. Lever-action designs with strong, rotary locking bolts (such as the [[Browning BLR]] with seven locking lugs) safely use very high-powered cartridges like the .300 Winchester mag, .300 WSM and 7 MM Remington magnum.  Tilting block designs such as the [[Savage Model 99]] are also strong enough to handle high pressures.\n\nMany lever actions have a tubular magazine under the barrel. To operate safely, cartridges for these have bullets with rounded tips, and some use rimfire primers rather than centerfire primers. The safety problem is that long range aerodynamic supersonic bullets are pointed. In a tubular magazine the points can accidentally fire centerfire cartridges.  A related problem is that some pointed bullets have fragile tips, and can be damaged in a tubular magazine. So, some lever actions such as the [[Savage Model 99]] can be fed from either box or rotary magazines. The [[Winchester Model 1895]] also uses a box magazine, and is chambered for [[.30-06]] and other powerful military cartridges. More recently, spitzer bullets with elastomeric tips have been developed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spitzer Bullets for .30-30 Reloaders: Boing, Boing, Boing!|url=http://www.realguns.com/Commentary/comar178.htm|website=Real Guns|accessdate=29 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nLever-action shotguns such as the Winchester Model 1887 were chambered in 10 or 12 gauge [[black powder]] shotgun shells, whereas the Model 1901 was chambered for 10 gauge smokeless shotshells. Modern reproductions are chambered for 12 gauge smokeless shells, while the Winchester Model 9410 shotgun is available in [[.410 bore]].\n\n==Other long gun actions==\n*[[Bolt action]]\n*[[Pump action]]\n*[[Break action]]\n*[[Falling-block action]]\n*[[Rolling block]]\n*[[Semi-automatic rifle]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Antique guns]]\n*[[Colt-Burgess rifle]]\n*[[Henry Rifle]]\n*[[Marlin 336]]\n*[[Martini\u2013Henry]]\n*[[Mossberg model 464]]\n*[[Savage Model 99]]\n*[[Spencer repeating rifle]]\n*[[Volcanic Repeating Arms]]\n*[[Winchester rifle]]\n*[[Winchester M1887]]\n*[[Rapid fire crossbow]], a conceptually similar weapon from Leonardo Da Vinci's work\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080905053313/http://www.rifleshootermag.com/featured_rifles/all_american_levergun/ The All-American Lever Gun - Rifle Shooter ](dead link)\n* Hunting with lever-action rifle (dead link)\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lever-Action}}\n[[Category:Firearm actions]]\n[[Category:Lever-action shotguns| Lever-action]]\n", "name_user": "Elvinhadi", "label": "safe", "comment": "The link to shotguns are only otguns (sh ini shotguns are not a link).

Originally broadcasting only to Launceston and Northern Tasmania, it has broadcast to the whole of Tasmania since aggregation of the Tasmanian television market in 1994.\n\n==History==\n* 1962 - Founded as Northern TV Ltd and broadcasts in Launceston and Northern Tasmania\n* 1965 - Became part of [[ENT Ltd]] (Examiner-Northern TV Ltd)\n* 1980 - adopts a custom version of the Nine Network's \"9 Dots\" logo\n* 1982 - ENT bought [[TVT-6]] in Hobart \n* 1985 - TNT and TVT officially relaunched as ''TasTV'', callsigns remain for both stations\n* 1989 - ENT sold TNT-9 to Tricom Corporation, which subsequently became [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]]; station became known on-air as ''Southern Cross Network''\n* 1994 - Aggregation of Tasmanian television market occurs - Southern Cross broadcasts statewide, competing with TasTV\n* 1999 - Southern Cross Tasmania, while still a part of Southern Cross Broadcasting, changes logo independently of Southern Cross stations on the mainland.\n* 2003 - Southern Cross and [[WIN Television]] launch [[Tasmanian Digital Television]], a jointly owned digital-only commercial station based in Hobart relaying [[Network Ten]] content. \n* 2005 - Southern Cross Broadcasting adapts new logo for all stations it owns. Southern Cross Tasmania loses its Tasmanian Tiger logo to a unified corporate Southern Cross logo.\n* 2018 - Southern Cross Tasmania became ''Seven Tasmania'' as local branding is replaced by network branding.\n\n==Local programming==\nTNT produces the market's number one news bulletin daily plus local lifestyle and sports programming.\n\nPrevious local programmes produced by TNT-9 include ''Sports Club'' (weekly sports review), ''Quiz Quest'' (children's game show), ''The Saturday Night Show'' (variety), ''Down the Line'' (morning talk/local events), ''The Saturday Morning Fun Show'' (kids), ''Tasmanian New Faces'' (talent) and annual coverage of ''Targa Tasmania'' and ''The Launceston Cup''.\n\n===News===\nThe station produces its flagship news program, ''Nightly News'' (formerly ''Southern Cross News''), broadcast live every night at 6:00pm and presented from the station's Launceston studios. Short news updates are also produced and broadcast throughout the day alongside the national [[Seven News|Seven News Updates]]. <!--Southern Cross News overtook the rival WIN News Tasmania's rating in 2011.-->The bulletin is consistently the highest rating television program in Tasmania. A shortened version of the day's bulletin is upload by the station's [[YouTube]] channel, featuring only local news and sport reports alongside weather forecasts.<!--Southern Cross News bulletins often brand themselves with Seven News brands, from time to time.-->\n\nThe station originally planned to retitle the bulletin ''Seven News Tasmania'' on 1 July 2018 to coincide with the station's rebrand as Seven Tasmania. But the relaunch was delayed without any notice given. When asked by [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'', the CEO of SCA Grant Blackley stated that the Seven Network did not want their name featured on any output they do not control, so SCA was coming up with a new brand.<ref>{{cite news |title=Not Seven news |url=https://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/episodes/not-seven-news---episode-22/9971262 |accessdate=3 December 2018 |work=[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]] |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=9 July 2018}}</ref> On 3 December 2018, the bulletin changed its title to ''Nightly News'', a brand the station formerly used from the 1990s up to the early 2000s.\n\nOutside of this bulletin, Seven Tasmania airs national news and current affairs output from the Seven Network, including:\n*''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]'' \n*''[[Weekend Sunrise]]''\n*''[[The Morning Show (TV program)|The Morning Show]]''\n*''[[Seven News]]'' (Early News, Morning News, Afternoon News at 4)\n*''[[Sunday Night (Australian TV program)|Sunday Night]]''\n*''[[The Daily Edition]]''\n\n====Current presenters====\n;Main anchors\n* Peter Murphy (Weeknights)\n* Rachel Williams (Weekends & Fills)\n\n;Sport presenters\n* Tom Johnson\n\n;Weather presenters\n* Laura Moore\n* Britt Aylen\n* Sam Millwood\n\n===Non-news output===\n====Hook, Line and Sinker====\nThe fishing show ''[[Hook, Line and Sinker (TV program)|Hook, Line and Sinker]]'' is the most popular Tasmanian-made program airing and is broadcast Australia-wide. The program is hosted by former news journalists [[Andrew Hart (journalist)|Andrew Hart]] and Nick Duigan.\n\n====Renovation Relief====\n''Renovation Relief'' is a DIY Program hosted by famous wood-chopper [[David Foster (woodchopper)|David Foster]] in which he and a team of people from sponsors (i.e. [[Gunns]]) renovate a house, most commonly for people who have done something for the community or have enabled children.\n\n====Targa Torque====\nBroadcast every night during [[Targa Tasmania]] fortnight, Andrew Hart and Nick Duigan report and review the events of the day.\n\n====Holiday at Home====\n''Holiday at Home'' is a lifestyle program which promotes places to stay and things to do in Tasmania.\n\n====Burnie Ten - Ten Week Challenge====\nFor the ten weeks leading up to the [[Burnie Ten]], Mark Connelly trains a group of people in a program sponsored by Seven Tasmania. Weekly updates are broadcast during commercial breaks. In the early years of the program, people who took part were well known in Tasmania, however in 2006, a Launceston family were trained to run the event.\n\n==Sports coverage==\nSeven Tasmania airs sports coverage from [[Seven Network]], which includes [[Australian Rules Football]], [[tennis]] and [[auto racing|motorsport]]. In the 1990s, the station aired [[Network Ten]]'s daily sports program [[Sports Tonight (Australian TV program)|Sports Tonight]] as part of its dual-affiliation, however this was eventually replaced by Seven's current affairs program, [[Today Tonight]].\n\nThe station airs three AFL games per round courtesy of its affiliation with Seven. Matches held in Tasmania are broadcast on delay. The station promotes extensive coverage of Tasmanian sports in its news coverage including [[cricket]], [[sport of athletics|athletics]], [[netball]] and [[basketball]]. The station's previous sports reporters were Chris Rowbottom, Alicia Muling, and Trent Dann.\n\n===Local sport===\nLocally, coverage of the international road race [[Targa Tasmania]] is produced and aired each year. The station also produces live coverage of the [[Launceston Cup|Launceston]] and [[Hobart Cup]]. Regular updates on the annual Boxing Day [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]] are broadcast during the duration of the race.\n\n==Affiliation==\nThe station is affiliated with the metropolitan [[Seven Network]] and also broadcasts most of Seven's sub-channels ([[7TWO]], [[7mate]], [[7flix]], Openshop, and [[Racing.com]]). Rival Tasmanian station [[TVT-6]] ([[WIN Television]]) is affiliated with the metropolitan [[Ten Network]].\n\nFollowing aggregation in 1994, the station was a combined Seven and Ten affiliate, however the Ten content was gradually removed from the schedule in the late 2000s following the launch of digital-only station [[Tasmanian Digital Television|TDT]] in 2003. TDT is a joint-venture between Southern Cross Austereo and WIN.\n\n==Main transmitters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse\"\n| '''Region served'''\n| '''City'''\n| '''[[channel (broadcasting)|Channels]]<br>''([[analog television|Analog]]/<br>[[digital terrestrial television|Digital]])'''''\n| '''First air date'''\n| '''[[effective radiated power|ERP]]<br>''(Analog/<br>Digital)'''''\n| '''[[height above average terrain|HAAT]]<br>''(Analog/<br>Digital)'''''<sup>1</sup>\n| '''Transmitter Coordinates'''\n| '''Transmitter Location'''\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Hobart]]\n| [[Hobart]]\n| 31 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]])<br>10 ([[very high frequency|VHF]])\n| 30 April 1994\n| 1300 [[kilowatt|kW]]<br>50&nbsp;kW\n| 1061 m<br>1030 m\n| {{coord|42|53|51|S|147|14|10|E|type:landmark_scale:2000|name=TNT}} (analog)<br>{{coord|42|53|42|S|147|14|10|E|type:landmark_scale:2000|name=TNT}} (digital)\n| [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]]\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| North Eastern Tasmania\n| [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]]\n| 9 ([[very high frequency|VHF]])<br>45 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]])\n| 26 May 1962\n| 300&nbsp;kW<br>600&nbsp;kW\n| 809 m<br>839 m\n| {{coord|41|23|27|S|147|25|29|E|type:landmark_scale:2000|name=TNT}} (analog)<br>{{coord|41|23|27|S|147|25|28|E|type:landmark_scale:2000|name=TNT}} (digital)\n| [[Mount Barrow]]\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n|}\nNotes:\n*1.

Southern Cross Tasmania loses its Tasmanian Tiger logo to a unified corporate Southern Cross logo.\n* 2018 - Southern Cross Tasmania became ''Seven Tasmania'' as local branding is replaced by network branding.\n\n==Local programming==\nTNT produces the market's number one news bulletin daily plus local lifestyle and sports programming.\n\nPrevious local programmes produced by TNT-9 include ''Sports Club'' (weekly sports review), ''Quiz Quest'' (children's game show), ''The Saturday Night Show'' (variety), ''Down the Line'' (morning talk/local events), ''The Saturday Morning Fun Show'' (kids), ''Tasmanian New Faces'' (talent) and annual coverage of ''Targa Tasmania'' and ''The Launceston Cup''.\n\n===News===\nThe station produces its flagship news program, ''Nightly News'' (formerly ''Southern Cross News''), broadcast live every night at 6:00pm and presented from the station's Launceston studios. Short news updates are also produced and broadcast throughout the day alongside the national [[Seven News|Seven News Updates]]. <!--Southern Cross News overtook the rival WIN News Tasmania's rating in 2011.-->The bulletin is consistently the highest rating television program in Tasmania. A shortened version of the day's bulletin is upload by the station's [[YouTube]] channel, featuring only local news and sport reports alongside weather forecasts.<!--Southern Cross News bulletins often brand themselves with Seven News brands, from time to time.-->\n\nThe station originally planned to retitle the bulletin ''Seven News Tasmania'' on 1 July 2018 to coincide with the station's rebrand as Seven Tasmania. But the relaunch was delayed without any notice given. When asked by [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'', the CEO of SCA Grant Blackley stated that the Seven Network did not want their name featured on any output they do not control, so SCA was coming up with a new brand.<ref>{{cite news |title=Not Seven news |url=https://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/episodes/not-seven-news---episode-22/9971262 |accessdate=3 December 2018 |work=[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]] |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=9 July 2018}}</ref> On 3 December 2018, the bulletin changed its title to ''Nightly News'', a brand the station formerly used from the 1990s up to the early 2000s.\n\nOutside of this bulletin, Seven Tasmania airs national news and current affairs output from the Seven Network, including:\n*''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]'' \n*''[[Weekend Sunrise]]''\n*''[[The Morning Show (TV program)|The Morning Show]]''\n*''[[Seven News]]'' (Early News, Morning News, Afternoon News at 4)\n*''[[Sunday Night (Australian TV program)|Sunday Night]]''\n*''[[The Daily Edition]]''\n\n====Current presenters====\n;Main anchors\n* Peter Murphy (Weeknights)\n* Rachel Williams (Weekends & Fills)\n\n;Sport presenters\n* Tom Johnson\n\n;Weather presenters\n* Laura Moore\n* Britt Aylen\n* Sam Millwood\n\n===Non-news output===\n====Hook, Line and Sinker====\nThe fishing show ''[[Hook, Line and Sinker (TV program)|Hook, Line and Sinker]]'' is the most popular Tasmanian-made program airing and is broadcast Australia-wide. The program is hosted by former news journalists [[Andrew Hart (journalist)|Andrew Hart]] and Nick Duigan.\n\n====Renovation Relief====\n''Renovation Relief'' is a DIY Program hosted by famous wood-chopper [[David Foster (woodchopper)|David Foster]] in which he and a team of people from sponsors (i.e. [[Gunns]]) renovate a house, most commonly for people who have done something for the community or have enabled children.\n\n====Targa Torque====\nBroadcast every night during [[Targa Tasmania]] fortnight, Andrew Hart and Nick Duigan report and review the events of the day.\n\n====Holiday at Home====\n''Holiday at Home'' is a lifestyle program which promotes places to stay and things to do in Tasmania.\n\n====Burnie Ten - Ten Week Challenge====\nFor the ten weeks leading up to the [[Burnie Ten]], Mark Connelly trains a group of people in a program sponsored by Seven Tasmania. Weekly updates are broadcast during commercial breaks. In the early years of the program, people who took part were well known in Tasmania, however in 2006, a Launceston family were trained to run the event.\n\n==Sports coverage==\nSeven Tasmania airs sports coverage from [[Seven Network]], which includes [[Australian Rules Football]], [[tennis]] and [[auto racing|motorsport]]. In the 1990s, the station aired [[Network Ten]]'s daily sports program [[Sports Tonight (Australian TV program)|Sports Tonight]] as part of its dual-affiliation, however this was eventually replaced by Seven's current affairs program, [[Today Tonight]].\n\nThe station airs three AFL games per round courtesy of its affiliation with Seven. Matches held in Tasmania are broadcast on delay. The station promotes extensive coverage of Tasmanian sports in its news coverage including [[cricket]], [[sport of athletics|athletics]], [[netball]] and [[basketball]]. The station's previous sports reporters were Chris Rowbottom, Alicia Muling, and Trent Dann.\n\n===Local sport===\nLocally, coverage of the international road race [[Targa Tasmania]] is produced and aired each year. The station also produces live coverage of the [[Launceston Cup|Launceston]] and [[Hobart Cup]]. Regular updates on the annual Boxing Day [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]] are broadcast during the duration of the race.\n\n==Affiliation==\nThe station is affiliated with the metropolitan [[Seven Network]] and also broadcasts most of Seven's sub-channels ([[7TWO]], [[7mate]], [[7flix]], Openshop, and [[Racing.com]]). Rival Tasmanian station [[TVT-6]] ([[WIN Television]]) is affiliated with the metropolitan [[Ten Network]].\n\nFollowing aggregation in 1994, the station was a combined Seven and Ten affiliate, however the Ten content was gradually removed from the schedule in the late 2000s following the launch of digital-only station [[Tasmanian Digital Television|TDT]] in 2003. TDT is a joint-venture between Southern Cross Austereo and WIN.\n\n==Main transmitters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse\"\n| '''Region served'''\n| '''City'''\n| '''[[channel (broadcasting)|Channels]]<br>''([[analog television|Analog]]/<br>[[digital terrestrial television|Digital]])'''''\n| '''First air date'''\n| '''[[effective radiated power|ERP]]<br>''(Analog/<br>Digital)'''''\n| '''[[height above average terrain|HAAT]]<br>''(Analog/<br>Digital)'''''<sup>1</sup>\n| '''Transmitter Coordinates'''\n| '''Transmitter Location'''\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Hobart]]\n| [[Hobart]]\n| 31 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]])<br>10 ([[very high frequency|VHF]])\n| 30 April 1994\n| 1300 [[kilowatt|kW]]<br>50&nbsp;kW\n| 1061 m<br>1030 m\n| {{coord|42|53|51|S|147|14|10|E|type:landmark_scale:2000|name=TNT}} (analog)<br>{{coord|42|53|42|S|147|14|10|E|type:landmark_scale:2000|name=TNT}} (digital)\n| [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]]\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| North Eastern Tasmania\n| [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]]\n| 9 ([[very high frequency|VHF]])<br>45 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]])\n| 26 May 1962\n| 300&nbsp;kW<br>600&nbsp;kW\n| 809 m<br>839 m\n| {{coord|41|23|27|S|147|25|29|E|type:landmark_scale:2000|name=TNT}} (analog)<br>{{coord|41|23|27|S|147|25|28|E|type:landmark_scale:2000|name=TNT}} (digital)\n| [[Mount Barrow]]\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n|}\nNotes:\n*1.
