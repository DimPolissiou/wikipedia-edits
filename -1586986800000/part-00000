It resulted in a surprise victory for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under leader [[Edward Heath]], which defeated the governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] under [[Harold Wilson]]. The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], under its new leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]], lost half its seats. The Conservatives, including the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP), secured a majority of 31 seats. This general election was the first in which people could vote from the age of 18, after passage of the [[Representation of the People Act 1969|Representation of the People Act]] the previous year.\n\nMost opinion polls prior to the election indicated a comfortable Labour victory, and put Labour up to 12.4% ahead of the Conservatives. On election day, however, a late swing gave the Conservatives a 3.4% lead and ended almost six years of Labour government, although Wilson remained leader of the Labour Party in opposition. Writing in the aftermath of the election, the political scientist [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Richard Rose]] described the Conservative victory as \"surprising\" and noted a significant shift in votes between the two main parties.<ref name=\"RoseTimes\">{{cite book |author1=Richard Rose |authorlink1=Richard Rose (political scientist) |title=The Times Guide to the House of Commons 1970 |date=1970 |publisher=Times Newspapers Limited |location=London |page=31 |chapter=Voting Trends Surveyed}}</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' journalist George Clark wrote that the election would be \"remembered as the occasion when the people of the United Kingdom hurled the findings of the opinion polls back into the faces of the pollsters\".<ref name=\"ClarkTimes\">{{cite book |author1=George Clark |title=The Times Guide to the House of Commons 1970 |date=1970 |publisher=Times Newspapers Limited |location=London |page=26 |chapter=The General Election Campaign, 1970}}</ref>\n\nThe result would provide the mandate for Heath as Prime Minister to begin formal negotiations for the United Kingdom to become a member of the [[European Communities]] (EC)\u2014or the \"Common Market\" as it was more widely known at the time, before it later became the [[European Union]]; the [[Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities|UK officially joined the EC]] on 1 January 1973, along with the Republic of Ireland and Denmark.\n\nFrontbench Labour politicians [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] and [[Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge|Jennie Lee]] were voted out at this election.\n\nThis marked the end of a series of elections, recommencing [[1997 United Kingdom general election|27 years later]], where the Labour Party won over 40% of the vote. This was the most recent election at which a House of Commons majority for one party immediately before election day was replaced by a Commons majority for a different party on election day.\n\nCast as a two-party politics outcome, such an outcome would not be mirrored until [[2017 United Kingdom general election|the 2017 election]], namely that no third party reached 10% of the (total) vote.\n\nThe election was the last in which a nationwide UK party gained seats in [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{citation |first=Dan |last=Keohane |year=2000 |title=Security in British Politics 1945\u201399 |p=183}}</ref> The UUP sat with the Conservative Party at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]], traditionally taking the Conservative parliamentary [[Whip (politics)|whip]]. To all intents and purposes the UUP functioned as the Northern Ireland branch of the Conservative Party. In 1972, in protest over the permanent prorogation of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], the Westminster UUP MPs withdrew from the alliance.<ref>{{citation |first=Stuart |last=Bell |first2=Anthony |last2=Seldon |title=The Heath Government 1970\u201374: A Reappraisal}}</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2018}}\n{{UK general election navigation|clear=none|1964|1966|1970|February 1974|October 1974}}\n\n==Election date==\nThe date of 18 June was supposedly chosen because [[Harold Wilson]] wanted as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] to go to the polls before the [[Decimal Day|introduction of decimal coinage]] in early 1971, for which his government had been responsible and which he thought was hugely unpopular,<ref name=\"Joe Haines 2003\">{{citation |first=Joe |last=Haines |title=Glimmers of Twilight |location=London |publisher=Politico's Publishers |year=2003}}</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2018}} and because Wilson sought to gain some momentum by surprising the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], who were expecting an October election.<ref name=\"Joe Haines 2003\"/>{{page needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Overview==\nCommentators believed that an unexpectedly bad set of balance of payments figures (a \u00a331-million trade deficit) published three days before the election and a loss of national prestige after the England football team's defeat by West Germany on 15 June in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] contributed to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] defeat.<ref name=SusVic>{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393297.stm |title=1970: Heath's surprise victory |date=5 April 2005 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther factors that were cited as reasons for the Conservative victory included union indiscipline, rising prices, the risk of devaluation, the imposition of [[Selective Employment Tax]] (SET), and a set of jobless figures released on final week of the campaign showing unemployment at its highest level since 1940. Interviewed by [[Robin Day]], the outgoing Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] highlighted the possibility that \"complacency engendered by the opinion polls\" may have resulted in a poor turnout of Labour supporters.<ref name=\"BBC Election Results Programme 1970\">{{citation |title=BBC Election Results Programme |date=18\u201319 July 1970}}</ref> As [[1966 FIFA World Cup|defending world champions]], England's venture in the World Cup attracted a much keener public interest than the general election did.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1970_over.stm|title=Heath: The victory few predicted |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAmerican pollster Douglas Schoen and [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] academic [[R.

Brown had held the seat since 1945.\n\nUnusually for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], the by-elections between 1966 and 1970 had proved almost fruitless, with many Liberal candidates losing deposits. The one exception was its [[1969 Birmingham Ladywood by-election|by-election gain of Birmingham Ladywood]] in June 1969; this was promptly lost in the 1970 general election. The party found itself struggling to introduce its new leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]] to the public, owing to the extensive coverage and attention paid to [[Enoch Powell]]. The election result was poor for the Liberals, with Thorpe only narrowly winning his own seat in [[North Devon]].<ref name=\"SusVic\"/>\n\nThe BBC's election coverage was led by [[Cliff Michelmore]], along with [[Robin Day]], [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] and [[Robert McKenzie (psephologist)|Robert McKenzie]].<ref name=SusVic/> There were periodic cutaways to the BBC regions.

Therefore, despite 1.1 million more people voting in 1970 compared to 1966, turnout actually fell by 3%. This 72% turnout was the lowest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|the 1935 general election]] and compared with a post-War high of 84% in [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950]]. [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Professor Richard Rose]] described the low turnout, which he noted was \"one of the lowest since the introduction of the democratic franchise\", as surprising to politician and pollsters. Changes to electoral law as part of the [[Representation of the People Act 1969]] had made postal voting easier and polling stations were open an hour later than in past elections, and this would have been expected to improve turnout. On top of this it was reported by Rose that an estimated 25% of 18\u201321-year olds who were now eligible to vote had not put their names on the electoral register, meaning the turnout was even lower than the percentage figure suggested. Rose also argued that the turnout figures in Britain were \"now among the lowest in the Western world.\"<ref name=\"RoseTimes\"/> Labour's number of votes, 12.2 million, was ironically the same amount they had needed to win in 1964. The Conservative vote surge cost Labour in many marginal seats. Rose suggested the absolute fall in the number of Labour votes suggested that many of the party's supporters had decided to abstain. He also noted that the Labour Party's local organisation was poorer than that of the Conservatives, but did not feel this was a significant factor in Labour supporters failing to come out to vote for the Party given that this organisational difference had been the case in past elections without having this effect.<ref name=\"RoseTimes\"/> For the Liberals, a small 1% drop in their vote share saw them lose 6 seats, 3 of which were held by the narrowest of margins.\n\nIn the end the Conservatives achieved a swing of 4.7%, enough to give them a comfortable working majority. As for the smaller parties, they increased their number in the Commons from 2 to 6 seats.\n{{Election Summary Begin with Leaders| title = UK General Election 1970}}\n{{Election Summary Party with

It resulted in a surprise victory for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under leader [[Edward Heath]], which defeated the governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] under [[Harold Wilson]]. The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], under its new leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]], lost half its seats. The Conservatives, including the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP), secured a majority of 31 seats. This general election was the first in which people could vote from the age of 18, after passage of the [[Representation of the People Act 1969|Representation of the People Act]] the previous year.\n\nMost opinion polls prior to the election indicated a comfortable Labour victory, and put Labour up to 12.4% ahead of the Conservatives. On election day, however, a late swing gave the Conservatives a 3.4% lead and ended almost six years of Labour government, although Wilson remained leader of the Labour Party in opposition. Writing in the aftermath of the election, the political scientist [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Richard Rose]] described the Conservative victory as \"surprising\" and noted a significant shift in votes between the two main parties.<ref name=\"RoseTimes\">{{cite book |author1=Richard Rose |authorlink1=Richard Rose (political scientist) |title=The Times Guide to the House of Commons 1970 |date=1970 |publisher=Times Newspapers Limited |location=London |page=31 |chapter=Voting Trends Surveyed}}</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' journalist George Clark wrote that the election would be \"remembered as the occasion when the people of the United Kingdom hurled the findings of the opinion polls back into the faces of the pollsters\".<ref name=\"ClarkTimes\">{{cite book |author1=George Clark |title=The Times Guide to the House of Commons 1970 |date=1970 |publisher=Times Newspapers Limited |location=London |page=26 |chapter=The General Election Campaign, 1970}}</ref>\n\nThe result would provide the mandate for Heath as Prime Minister to begin formal negotiations for the United Kingdom to become a member of the [[European Communities]] (EC)\u2014or the \"Common Market\" as it was more widely known at the time, before it later became the [[European Union]]; the [[Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities|UK officially joined the EC]] on 1 January 1973, along with the Republic of Ireland and Denmark.\n\nFrontbench Labour politicians [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] and [[Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge|Jennie Lee]] were voted out at this election.\n\nThis marked the end of a series of elections, recommencing [[1997 United Kingdom general election|27 years later]], where the Labour Party won over 40% of the vote.

Therefore, despite 1.1 million more people voting in 1970 compared to 1966, turnout actually fell by 3%. This 72% turnout was the lowest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|the 1935 general election]] and compared with a post-War high of 84% in [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950]]. [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Professor Richard Rose]] described the low turnout, which he noted was \"one of the lowest since the introduction of the democratic franchise\", as surprising to politician and pollsters. Changes to electoral law as part of the [[Representation of the People Act 1969]] had made postal voting easier and polling stations were open an hour later than in past elections, and this would have been expected to improve turnout. On top of this it was reported by Rose that an estimated 25% of 18\u201321-year olds who were now eligible to vote had not put their names on the electoral register, meaning the turnout was even lower than the percentage figure suggested. Rose also argued that the turnout figures in Britain were \"now among the lowest in the Western world.\"<ref name=\"RoseTimes\"/> Labour's number of votes, 12.2 million, was ironically the same amount they had needed to win in 1964. The Conservative vote surge cost Labour in many marginal seats. Rose suggested the absolute fall in the number of Labour votes suggested that many of the party's supporters had decided to abstain. He also noted that the Labour Party's local organisation was poorer than that of the Conservatives, but did not feel this was a significant factor in Labour supporters failing to come out to vote for the Party given that this organisational difference had been the case in past elections without having this effect.<ref name=\"RoseTimes\"/> For the Liberals, a small 1% drop in their vote share saw them lose 6 seats, 3 of which were held by the narrowest of margins.\n\nIn the end the Conservatives achieved a swing of 4.7%, enough to give them a comfortable working majority. As for the smaller parties, they increased their number in the Commons from 2 to 6 seats.\n{{Election Summary Begin with Leaders| title = UK General Election 1970}}\n{{Election Summary Party with

Bush]] as [[President of the United States|president]] and the [[2004 United States House of Representatives elections|United States House election]], as well as many state and local elections. Senators who were elected in [[1998 United States Senate elections|1998]], known as [[Classes of United States Senators|Senate Class 3]], were seeking re-election or retiring in 2004. This was the third consecutive election for Senate Class 3 where the Democrats either broke even or lost seats.  This also marked the first time since 1980 in which a presidential candidate from either party won with coattails in the Senate. As of 2018, these are the last elections held during a Presidential election year in which the Republicans made a net gain of seats.\n\n==Gains and losses==\nRepublicans won six seats but lost two themselves, giving them a net gain of four seats. Five of the six gains came from Southern states. Conservative Democrat [[Zell Miller]] of [[List of United States Senators from Georgia|Georgia]], who campaigned for President [[George W. Bush|Bush]], chose not to run for re-election and Republican [[Johnny Isakson]] won his seat; Democrat [[Fritz Hollings]] of [[List of United States Senators from South Carolina|South Carolina]] chose not to run for re-election and was succeeded by Republican [[Jim DeMint]]; Democratic vice presidential nominee [[John Edwards]] did not run for re-election and Republican [[Richard Burr]] won his [[List of United States Senators from North Carolina|North Carolina]] seat; Democrat [[Bob Graham]] of [[List of United States Senators from Florida|Florida]] chose not to run for re-election, and his seat went to Republican [[Mel Martinez]]; [[List of United States Senators from Louisiana|Louisiana]] Democrat [[John Breaux]] chose not to run for re-election and Republican [[David Vitter]] won his seat, and in [[List of United States Senators from South Dakota|South Dakota]], Republican [[John Thune]] defeated the incumbent Senate minority leader [[Tom Daschle]], the first time since [[1952 United States Senate elections|1952]] that a sitting party leader lost re-election. Republican Senator [[Peter Fitzgerald (senator)|Peter Fitzgerald]] of [[List of United States Senators from Illinois|Illinois]] chose not to run for re-election and Democrat [[Barack Obama]] won in a landslide, becoming the Senate's only black member and only the third popularly elected since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Also, Republican Senator [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]] of [[List of United States Senators from Colorado|Colorado]] chose not to run for re-election and Democrat [[Ken Salazar]] won the open seat.\n\n==Results summary==\n\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ \u2193\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:44%;\" | '''44'''\n| style=\"background:{{Independent (US)/meta/color}}; color:black; width:1%;\" | '''1'''\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:55%;\" | '''55'''\n|}\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:44%;\"| <span style=\"color:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Democratic'''</span>\n| '''Independent'''\n| style=\"width:55%;\"| <span style=\"color:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Republican'''</span>\n|}\n\n{{United States Senate elections results, 2004}}\n\n== Change in composition ==\n\n=== Before the elections ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:800px\"\n\n|-\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|1}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|2}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|3}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|4}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|5}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|6}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|7}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|8}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|9}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|10}}\n\n|-\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|20}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|19}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|18}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|17}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|16}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|15}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|14}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|13}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|12}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|11}}\n\n|-\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|21}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|22}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|23}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|24}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|25}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|26}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|27}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|28}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|29}}\n!

Key:\n|\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n| align=center width=35px {{Party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|#}}\n| [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n|-\n| align=center width=35px {{Party shading/Independent (US)}} | I{{Sub|#}}\n| [[Independent (United States)|Independent]]\n|-\n| align=center width=35px {{Party shading/Republican}} | R{{Sub|#}}\n| [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n|}\n|}\n\n==Political parties==\n[[File:109th US Congress Senate3.PNG|thumb|375px|Senate composition following the 2004 elections.]]\nThe Senate, as of the pre-election [[108th United States Congress|108th Congress]], was composed of 51 [[United States Republican Party|Republican]]s, 48 [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]]s, and 1 independent. (The independent, [[Jim Jeffords]] of [[Vermont]], was allied with the Democratic caucus and had voted with Democrats to give them the majority in the past.) The Democrats, therefore, needed to make a net gain of at least two seats from retiring or incumbent Republicans to gain control of the Senate (one seat if Kerry won the presidency). In the election, incumbent senators won reelection in all races but one ([[Senate Minority Leader|Democratic leader]] [[Tom Daschle]], in [[South Dakota]], lost to Republican [[John Thune]]). The seats of retiring senators were taken by the opposing party in [[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Illinois]], [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and [[South Carolina]]. In fact, the only retiring senator whose seat was taken by a member of his party was Republican [[Don Nickles]] of [[Oklahoma]], who was succeeded by [[Tom Coburn]].\n\nRepublicans gained four seats in the 2004 elections, and entered the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]] with a 55\u201344\u20131 lead. While such a majority is formidable, it is still less than the 60 seats needed to override a [[filibuster (legislative tactic)|filibuster]] and completely control the body's agenda and procedures.\n\n===Major parties===\n\nOne Republican seat, that of retiring Senator Peter Fitzgerald in Illinois, was easily taken by Democrat [[Barack Obama]], who would be elected [[President of the United States]] four years later. In Colorado, retiring Senator [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]]'s seat was narrowly taken by Democrat [[Ken Salazar]]. In Alaska, Republican [[Lisa Murkowski]] won reelection in a tight race. In Oklahoma, [[Tom Coburn]] kept [[Don Nickles]]' seat in Republican hands, while in Kentucky, Republican [[Jim Bunning]] won a second term by a very narrow margin.\n\nThe Democrats' prospects were weakened by the fact that five of their six incumbent senators in Southern states were retiring (the sixth, [[Blanche Lincoln]] of [[Arkansas]], easily won reelection). Retiring Georgia Sen. [[Zell Miller]]'s seat, contested by [[Denise Majette]], was lost in a landslide, as was that of South Carolina Sen. [[Ernest Hollings]]. In North Carolina, Democrat [[Erskine Bowles]] lost [[John Edwards]]'s seat to Republican [[Richard Burr]]. Especially close races in Florida, Louisiana, and South Dakota all resulted in turnovers to the Republicans.\n\n===Third and minor parties===\nThe [[United States Libertarian Party|Libertarian]], [[United States Constitution Party|Constitution]], and [[United States Green Party|Green]] parties contested many of the seats. No candidate from any of these parties received sufficient support to achieve election, but some may have affected the outcome of the Alaska and Florida races by drawing votes away from the major party candidates. Of the 34 senate seats up for grabs, the Libertarians ran candidates in 20 of the races, the Constitutionalists ran 10 candidates, and the Greens ran 7 candidates.\n\n[[List of political parties in the United States|Minor parties]] in a number of states contested one or more Senate seats. Examples include the America First Party, the [[Labor Party (United States, 1996)|Labor Party]], the [[Peace and Freedom Party (United States)|Peace and Freedom Party]], and the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]]. None of these parties gained a seat in this election nor received a significant number of votes.\n\n== Race summary ==\n=== Special elections during the 108th Congress ===\nThere were no special elections during the 108th Congress.\n\n=== Elections leading to the next Congress ===\nIn these general elections, the winners were elected for the term beginning January 3, 2005; ordered by state.\n\nAll of the elections involved the Class 3 seats.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n\n|- valign=bottom\n! rowspan=2 | State<br/>{{small|(linked to<br/>summaries below)}}\n! colspan=3 | Incumbent\n! rowspan=2 | Results\n! rowspan=2 | Candidates\n\n|-\n!

Her main challenger was Democratic former Governor [[Tony Knowles (politician)|Tony Knowles]], her father's predecessor as governor. Murkowski won by a slight margin.\n\nAlthough [[Alaska]] is heavily Republican, popular opinion had swung against the Murkowski family because of a tax increase passed by Governor Frank Murkowski, Lisa Murkowski's father.

The overwhelming support for Mart\u00ednez among Latinos effectively counterbalanced Castor's relatively high popularity among swing voters throughout the state.\n\nThere was some speculation that Castor would run for [[Governor of Florida]] in 2006 to replace [[Jeb Bush]], who was ineligible for re-election due to term limits, but she announced in 2005 that she would not be a candidate.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = 2004 United States Senate election in Florida<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#9|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = Melqu\u00edades Rafael Mart\u00ednez Ruiz\n | votes      = 3,672,864\n | percentage = 49.43\n | change     = +11.9%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = Elizabeth Castor\n | votes      = 3,590,201\n | percentage = 48.32\n | change     = \u221214.15%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Veterans Party of America\n | candidate  = Dennis F.

Democratic U.S. Representative [[Denise Majette]] became both the first African American and the first woman to be nominated for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. Republican U.S. Representative [[Johnny Isakson]] won the open seat.\n\nThe results were almost a complete reversal from the previous election in 2000.\n\nMajette's announcement that she would seek to replace Miller also caught Democrats by surprise, as she was not on anyone's call list when Democrats began seeking a candidate to replace Miller. Further skepticism among Democrats about the viability of her candidacy surfaced when she announced that \"God\" had told her to run for the Senate. She received important endorsements from U.S. Senators [[Mary Landrieu]] of Louisiana and [[Debbie Stabenow]] of Michigan, along with many others in Washington who campaigned and raised money for Majette. Her Senate campaign slogan was \"I'll be nobody's Senator, but yours.\"\n\nA number of factors led to Majette's loss. These include her late start, her valuable time and money spent in the runoff, larger conservative turnout from a proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages (which Majette opposed), the popularity of President [[George W. Bush]] in Georgia, and her lack of experience (being a one-term congresswoman).\n\n{{Election box begin no change\n | title      = Republican primary<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sos.georgia.gov/elections/election_results/2004_0720/0000120.htm |title=United States Senator |publisher=Sos.georgia.gov |accessdate=1 February 2019}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link no change\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Johnny Isakson]]\n | votes      = 346,765\n | percentage = 53.2%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link no change\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Herman Cain]]\n | votes      = 170,464\n | percentage = 26.2%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link no change\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Mac Collins]]\n | votes      = 134,053\n | percentage = 20.6%\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Georgia general election<ref>{{cite web | url = http://sos.georgia.gov/elections/election_results/2004_1102/002.htm| title = United States Senator | publisher = Georgia of Secretary of State | date = December 21, 2005 | accessdate = December 3, 2008}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Johnny Isakson]]\n | votes      = 1,864,205\n | percentage = 57.88\n | change     = +19.97%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Denise Majette]]\n | votes      = 1,287,695\n | percentage = 39.98\n | change     = \u221218.22%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Libertarian Party (US)\n | candidate  = Allen Buckley\n | votes      = 69,051\n | percentage = 2.14\n | change     = +2.14%\n}}\n{{Election box majority\n | votes      = 576,510\n | percentage = 17.90\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n | votes      = 3,220,951\n | percentage = \n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Hawaii ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = Hawaii Election\n| country           = Hawaii\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = 1998 United States Senate election in Hawaii\n| previous_year     = 1998\n| next_election     = 2010 United States Senate election in Hawaii\n| next_year         = 2010\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n\n| image1            = Daniel Inouye, official Senate photo portrait, 2008.jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Daniel Inouye]]'''\n| party1            = Democratic Party (US)\n| popular_vote1     = '''313,629'''\n| percentage1       = '''75.5%'''\n\n| image2            = Cam Cavasso.jpg\n| nominee2          = [[Campbell Cavasso|Cam Cavasso]]\n| party2            = Republican Party (US)\n| popular_vote2     = 87,172\n| percentage2       = 21.0%\n\n| map_image         = Hawaii_Election_Results_by_County,_all_Democratic.svg\n| map_size          = 100px\n| map_caption       = County Results\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Daniel Inouye]]\n| before_party      = Democratic Party (US)\n| after_election    = [[Daniel Inouye]]\n| after_party       = Democratic Party (US)\n}}\n{{Main|2004 United States Senate election in Hawaii}}\n{{See also|List of United States Senators from Hawaii}}\nIncumbent Democrat U.S. Senator [[Daniel Inouye]] won re-election to an eighth term over Republican, [[Campbell Cavasso]], a former state representative.\n\nInouye won every single county with at least 70% of the vote.

The Democrats began increasing financial support to Mongiardo when it became apparent that Bunning's bizarre behavior was costing him votes, purchasing more than $800,000 worth of additional television airtime on his behalf.\n\nThe November 2 election was one of the closest in Kentucky history. The race turned out to be very close, with Mongiardo leading with as many as 80% of the returns coming in. However, Bunning eventually won by just over one percentage point.

Vitter responded that the allegation was \"absolutely and completely untrue\" and that it was \"just crass Louisiana politics.\" The allegation later turned out to be true.<ref name=\"WP-07-10-07\">Shailagh Murray, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/09/AR2007070902030.html \"Senator's Number on 'Madam' Phone List\"], ''The Washington Post'', July 10, 2007</ref>\n\nVitter won the Louisiana jungle primary with 51% of the vote, avoiding the need for a runoff. John received 29.2% of the vote and Kennedy (no relation to the Massachusetts Kennedys), took 14.9%.\n\nVitter won at least a plurality in 56 of Louisiana's 64 parishes. John carried nine parishes, all but two of which (Iberville and Orleans) are part of the House district he represented.\n\nKennedy changed parties and ran as Republican in 2008 against Louisiana's senior senator, Democrat [[Mary Landrieu]]. Landrieu was re-elected. Kennedy succeeded Vitter when he won the 2016 election for the seat over Democrat [[Foster Campbell]].\n\nVitter was the first Republican in Louisiana to be popularly elected as a U.S. Senator. The previous Republican Senator, [[William Pitt Kellogg]], was chosen by the state legislature in 1876, in accordance with the process used before the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] went into effect in 1914.<ref>{{cite news | date=November 1, 2004 | last=Rudin | first=Ken | authorlink=Ken Rudin | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4136425 | title=Final Call: Kerry Wins Narrow Electoral Margin; GOP Gains in House, Senate | publisher=[[NPR]] | accessdate=April 30, 2008}}</ref>\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = 2004 Louisiana United States Senate election}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = David Vitter\n | votes      = 943,014\n | percentage = 51.03\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = Chris John\n | votes      = 542,150\n | percentage = 29.34\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = John Neely Kennedy\n | votes      = 275,821\n | percentage = 14.92\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = Arthur A.

The retirement of Democratic Senator [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] gave the Republicans an opportunity to pick up the seat and with no other interesting positions up for election in 2004, a crowded field developed in the Republican primary.  Furthermore, the Republicans were motivated by having President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] at the top of the ticket enabling them to ride his coattails to victory.\n\nFormer [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[David Beasley]], from the [[Pee Dee]], entered the race and quickly emerged as the frontrunner because of his support from the evangelical voters.  However, during his term as governor from 1994 to 1998 he had greatly angered the electorate by proposing to remove the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate Naval Jack]] from the dome of the statehouse and by being against the adoption of a [[South Carolina Education Lottery|state lottery]] to provide for college scholarships. Both positions led to the loss of his [[1998 South Carolina gubernatorial election|re-election in 1998]] and the issues continued to trouble him in the Senate race.\n\nThe battle for second place in the primary was between [[The Upstate|Upstate]] congressman, [[Jim DeMint]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] developer [[Thomas Ravenel]].  DeMint was able to squeak out a second-place finish because [[Charlie Condon]], a former [[South Carolina Attorney General|Attorney General of South Carolina]], split the [[South Carolina Low Country|Lowcountry]] vote with Ravenel thus providing DeMint the margin he needed.  In addition, while many voters were attracted to the Ravenel campaign and felt that he had a future in politics, they believed that he should set his sights on a less high-profile office first before trying to become senator.  Resigned to defeat, Ravenel endorsed DeMint in the runoff election.\n\nIn the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on June 22, 2004, DeMint scored a surprising victory over Beasley.  Ravenel's endorsement of DeMint proved crucial as the Lowcountry counties heavily went for the Representative from the Upstate.  Also, Beasley had burnt too many bridges while governor and was unable to increase his share of the vote in the runoff.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n\n|- style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | Republican Primary Election\n\n|-\n!

He stressed to the voters that he would follow conservative principles and provide an important Republican vote in the closely divided Senate.  Democrats fared poorly in statewide elections in South Carolina, so Tenenbaum tried to make the race about issues rather than party identification.  She attacked DeMint's support of the [[FairTax]] proposal because it would increase the sales tax by 23%.  The election victory by DeMint merely cemented South Carolina's shift to the Republican column as the best candidate the Democrats could offer was soundly defeated by the typical 10 point margin.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = South Carolina U.S. Senate Election, 2004}}\n {{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Jim DeMint]]\n | votes      = 857,167\n | percentage = 53.6\n | change     = +7.9%\n}}\n {{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Inez Tenenbaum]]\n | votes      = 704,384\n | percentage = 44.1\n | change     = \u22128.6%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Constitution Party (US)\n | candidate  = Patrick Tyndall\n | votes      = 13,464\n | percentage = 0.8\n | change     = +0.8%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Libertarian Party (US)\n | candidate  = Rebekah E.

Thune prevailed by a narrow 50.6\u201349.4% margin, of 4,508 votes. Senate Majority Leader [[Bill Frist]] visited South Dakota to campaign for Thune, breaking an unwritten tradition that one party's leader in the Senate would not campaign directly for the other's defeat. Daschle's loss resulted in the first ousting of a majority or minority leader since 1952 when Arizona Senator [[Ernest McFarland]] lost his seat to [[Barry Goldwater]]. Daschle's Senate term expired on January 3, 2005.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Thune, along with Frist, President Bush, and Vice President Cheney, frequently accused Daschle of being the \"chief obstructionist\" of Bush's agenda and charged him with using [[filibuster]]s to block confirmation of several of Bush's nominees to the federal judiciary. Thune also used moral values such as issues surrounding [[same-sex marriage]] and [[abortion]] to convince South Dakota voters that Daschle's positions on such topics were out-of-sync with the state's residents. The Republican candidate also drove home his strong support for the President while blasting Daschle for his vehement opposition to Bush. He attempted to sway voters by remembering that Bush won South Dakota in a landslide in 2000 and had a very high job-approval rating among South Dakotans. His opponent, the Minority Leader, repeatedly argued that he was funneling money into South Dakota for vital federal highway and water pet projects.\n\nDaschle responded to Thune's claim that he was a partisan anti-Bush obstructionist by pointing to his action just nine days after the [[September 11 attacks]] when he hugged President Bush on the Senate floor following Bush's address to Congress and the nation. He also hit back by alleging that Thune wanted to \"rubber stamp what the administration is doing.\" Daschle's use of the video of his embrace of Bush forced the [[Republican National Committee]] to demand that the ad be pulled, claiming that it suggests that Bush endorses Daschle. Shortly following the airing of the ad, in a nationally televised debate on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]'', Thune accused Daschle of \"emboldening the enemy\" in his skepticism of the [[Iraq War]].\n\nDaschle also noticeably relied very heavily on the power of incumbency to win a fourth term. Some also argued that [[Stephanie Herseth Sandlin|Stephanie Herseth]]'s election to the state's only House seat hurt Daschle, as voters may not have been comfortable sending an all-Democratic delegation to Congress for the first time in many decades. Accusations that Daschle was possibly considering no longer being an official resident of South Dakota was believed to have offended voters there. Others have analyzed that Daschle's lengthy consideration and eventual rejection of a potential run for the presidency in 2004 took a toll on South Dakotans, who felt betrayed and used by Daschle as a result.\n\nWhen the race began in early 2004, Daschle led by 7 points in January and February. By May, his lead minimized to just 2 points and into the summer polls showed a varying number of trends: either Daschle held a slim 1- to 2-point lead or Thune held a slim 1- to 2-point lead or the race was tied right down the middle. Throughout September, Daschle led Thune by margins of 2 to 5 percent while during the entire month of October into the November 2 election, most polls showed that Thune and Daschle were dead even, usually tied 49\u201349 among likely voters. Some polls showed either Thune or Daschle leading by extremely slim margins.\n\nThune was an aide to former Senator [[James Abdnor]], the man Daschle defeated in 1986 to gain his seat in the Senate.\n\nDaschle spent a great deal of time and energy campaigning for his fellow Democrat [[Tim Johnson (South Dakota)|Tim Johnson]] in 2002, who barely defeated Thune by 524 votes. He argued that by re-electing Johnson, [[South Dakota]] would be better off because Johnson would help to keep Daschle Majority Leader. However, in the end, while Johnson won, other states voted for enough Republicans that Daschle was no longer majority leader. Furthermore, Thune's whisker-close defeat in 2002 freed him up to run against Daschle in 2004. Had Daschle not put his considerable weight to re-electing Johnson, it seems very likely that Thune would have beaten Johnson, leaving Daschle without a strong challenger for the upcoming election and making his re-election a certainty.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = South Dakota general election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#41|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[John Thune]]\n | votes      = 197,848\n | percentage = 50.58\n | change     = +14.17%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Tom Daschle]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 193,340\n | percentage = 49.42\n | change     = \u221212.72%\n}}\n{{Election box majority\n | votes      = 4,508\n | percentage = 1.15\n | change     = \u221224.58%\n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n | votes      = 391,188\n | percentage = \n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Utah ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = Utah Election\n| country           = Utah\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = 1998 United States Senate election in Utah\n| previous_year     = 1998\n| next_election     = 2010 United States Senate election in Utah\n| next_year         = 2010\n| flag_year         = 1913\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n\n| image1            = Bob Bennett official portrait, 2009.jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]]'''\n| party1            = Republican Party (US)\n| popular_vote1     = '''626,640'''\n| percentage1       = '''68.7%'''\n\n| image2            = \n| nominee2          = Paul Van Dam\n| party2            = Democratic Party (US)\n| popular_vote2     = 258,955\n| percentage2       = 28.4%\n\n| map_image         = Utah allred.png\n| map_size          = 200px\n| map_caption       = County results\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]]\n| before_party      = Republican Party (US)\n| after_election    = [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]]\n| after_party       = Republican Party (US)\n}}\n{{Main|2004 United States Senate election in Utah}}\n{{See also|List of United States Senators from Utah}}\nIncumbent Republican Bob Bennett won re-election to a third term easily beating Democrat Paul Van Dam, former [[Attorney General of Utah]] and former [[Salt Lake County]] District Attorney\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Utah general election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#44|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 626,640\n | percentage = 68.73\n | change     = +4.75%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = Paul Van Dam\n | votes      = 258,955\n | percentage = 28.40\n | change     = \u22124.57%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Constitution Party (US)\n | candidate  = Gary R.

Magnuson]] and [[Scoop Jackson]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.\n\nTerm limits became an issue in the campaign, as Democrats seized on Nethercutt's broken term-limits pledge that he had made when he unseated Speaker [[Tom Foley]] in 1994. Nethercutt was also hampered by his lack of name recognition in the more densely populated western part of the state, home to two-thirds of the state's population. Washington has not elected a senator from east of the [[Cascade Mountains|Cascades]] since [[Miles Poindexter]] in 1916. Other important issues included national security and the [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003\u2013present|war in Iraq]]. Nethercutt supported the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion]] of Iraq, while Murray opposed it. Nethercutt was a heavy underdog from the start, and his campaign never gained much traction. In November, he lost by 12 points, receiving 43 percent of the vote to Murray's 55 percent.\n\n{{Election box begin no change\n | title      = Washington general election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#47|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link no change\n | party      = Democratic Party (Washington)\n | candidate  = [[Patty Murray]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 1,549,708\n | percentage = 54.98\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link no change\n | party      = Republican Party (Washington)\n | candidate  = [[George Nethercutt]]\n | votes      = 1,204,584\n | percentage = 42.74\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link no change\n | party      = Libertarian Party (US)\n | candidate  = J.

This also marked the first time since 1980 in which a presidential candidate from either party won with coattails in the Senate. As of 2018, these are the last elections held during a Presidential election year in which the Republicans made a net gain of seats.\n\n==Gains and losses==\nRepublicans won six seats but lost two themselves, giving them a net gain of four seats. Five of the six gains came from Southern states. Conservative Democrat [[Zell Miller]] of [[List of United States Senators from Georgia|Georgia]], who campaigned for President [[George W. Bush|Bush]], chose not to run for re-election and Republican [[Johnny Isakson]] won his seat; Democrat [[Fritz Hollings]] of [[List of United States Senators from South Carolina|South Carolina]] chose not to run for re-election and was succeeded by Republican [[Jim DeMint]]; Democratic vice presidential nominee [[John Edwards]] did not run for re-election and Republican [[Richard Burr]] won his [[List of United States Senators from North Carolina|North Carolina]] seat; Democrat [[Bob Graham]] of [[List of United States Senators from Florida|Florida]] chose not to run for re-election, and his seat went to Republican [[Mel Martinez]]; [[List of United States Senators from Louisiana|Louisiana]] Democrat [[John Breaux]] chose not to run for re-election and Republican [[David Vitter]] won his seat, and in [[List of United States Senators from South Dakota|South Dakota]], Republican [[John Thune]] defeated the incumbent Senate minority leader [[Tom Daschle]], the first time since [[1952 United States Senate elections|1952]] that a sitting party leader lost re-election. Republican Senator [[Peter Fitzgerald (senator)|Peter Fitzgerald]] of [[List of United States Senators from Illinois|Illinois]] chose not to run for re-election and Democrat [[Barack Obama]] won in a landslide, becoming the Senate's only black member and only the third popularly elected since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Also, Republican Senator [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]] of [[List of United States Senators from Colorado|Colorado]] chose not to run for re-election and Democrat [[Ken Salazar]] won the open seat.\n\n==Results summary==\n\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ \u2193\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:44%;\" | '''44'''\n| style=\"background:{{Independent (US)/meta/color}}; color:black; width:1%;\" | '''1'''\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:55%;\" | '''55'''\n|}\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:44%;\"| <span style=\"color:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Democratic'''</span>\n| '''Independent'''\n| style=\"width:55%;\"| <span style=\"color:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Republican'''</span>\n|}\n\n{{United States Senate elections results, 2004}}\n\n== Change in composition ==\n\n=== Before the elections ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:800px\"\n\n|-\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|1}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|2}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|3}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|4}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|5}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|6}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|7}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|8}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|9}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|10}}\n\n|-\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|20}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|19}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|18}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|17}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|16}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|15}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|14}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|13}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|12}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|11}}\n\n|-\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|21}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|22}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|23}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|24}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|25}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|26}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|27}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|28}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|29}}\n!

(The independent, [[Jim Jeffords]] of [[Vermont]], was allied with the Democratic caucus and had voted with Democrats to give them the majority in the past.) The Democrats, therefore, needed to make a net gain of at least two seats from retiring or incumbent Republicans to gain control of the Senate (one seat if Kerry won the presidency). In the election, incumbent senators won reelection in all races but one ([[Senate Minority Leader|Democratic leader]] [[Tom Daschle]], in [[South Dakota]], lost to Republican [[John Thune]]). The seats of retiring senators were taken by the opposing party in [[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Illinois]], [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and [[South Carolina]]. In fact, the only retiring senator whose seat was taken by a member of his party was Republican [[Don Nickles]] of [[Oklahoma]], who was succeeded by [[Tom Coburn]].\n\nRepublicans gained four seats in the 2004 elections, and entered the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]] with a 55\u201344\u20131 lead. While such a majority is formidable, it is still less than the 60 seats needed to override a [[filibuster (legislative tactic)|filibuster]] and completely control the body's agenda and procedures.\n\n===Major parties===\n\nOne Republican seat, that of retiring Senator Peter Fitzgerald in Illinois, was easily taken by Democrat [[Barack Obama]], who would be elected [[President of the United States]] four years later. In Colorado, retiring Senator [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]]'s seat was narrowly taken by Democrat [[Ken Salazar]]. In Alaska, Republican [[Lisa Murkowski]] won reelection in a tight race. In Oklahoma, [[Tom Coburn]] kept [[Don Nickles]]' seat in Republican hands, while in Kentucky, Republican [[Jim Bunning]] won a second term by a very narrow margin.\n\nThe Democrats' prospects were weakened by the fact that five of their six incumbent senators in Southern states were retiring (the sixth, [[Blanche Lincoln]] of [[Arkansas]], easily won reelection). Retiring Georgia Sen. [[Zell Miller]]'s seat, contested by [[Denise Majette]], was lost in a landslide, as was that of South Carolina Sen. [[Ernest Hollings]]. In North Carolina, Democrat [[Erskine Bowles]] lost [[John Edwards]]'s seat to Republican [[Richard Burr]]. Especially close races in Florida, Louisiana, and South Dakota all resulted in turnovers to the Republicans.\n\n===Third and minor parties===\nThe [[United States Libertarian Party|Libertarian]], [[United States Constitution Party|Constitution]], and [[United States Green Party|Green]] parties contested many of the seats. No candidate from any of these parties received sufficient support to achieve election, but some may have affected the outcome of the Alaska and Florida races by drawing votes away from the major party candidates. Of the 34 senate seats up for grabs, the Libertarians ran candidates in 20 of the races, the Constitutionalists ran 10 candidates, and the Greens ran 7 candidates.\n\n[[List of political parties in the United States|Minor parties]] in a number of states contested one or more Senate seats. Examples include the America First Party, the [[Labor Party (United States, 1996)|Labor Party]], the [[Peace and Freedom Party (United States)|Peace and Freedom Party]], and the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]].

In the spring, the campaign hired fundraising staff from the defunct presidential campaigns of [[Howard Dean]] and [[Bob Graham]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, and subsequently posted much higher fundraising numbers over the summer{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. Online grassroots techniques devised for the Dean campaign (Castor became a [[Dean Dozen]] candidate in August{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}) were one contributing factor{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}: another was the support of [[EMILY's List]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, which named Castor as its highest-rated candidate for the 2004 election cycle{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, even when her support for banning intact dilation and extraction (D&X) abortions was not in line with the EMILY's List support for woman's issues{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. The latter was a source of criticism during the August primary heat - a complaint was filed by a Deutsch supporter with the Federal Election Commission accusing inappropriate coordination with EMILY's List{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. The complaint was dismissed by the Federal Election Commission in 2005{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.\n\nCastor's handling of [[Sami Al-Arian]] became another source of criticism during the campaign{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. In June, [[American Democracy Project (527 group in Florida)|The American Democracy Project]], a [[527 group]] founded by [[Bernie Friedman]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, began attacking Castor's handling of the incident, alleging that she had sufficient evidence to fire Al-Arian in the mid-1990s{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. Castor responded by stating that she never had sufficient evidence to fire Al-Arian, who was a [[tenure|tenured professor]] at the time{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. On June 29, Senator Graham, who had previously remained outside of the Al-Arian controversy, released a statement that \"Betty Castor acted appropriately as President of the University of South Florida to deal with Sami Al-Arian\"{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}: later, Graham and Senator [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]] brokered an agreement between the Democratic candidates to refrain from negative campaigning against each other{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, although this agreement appeared to break down in the final weeks of the race, when Deutsch launched attack ads on television{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.\n\nDespite these controversies, Castor won the Democratic nomination on August 31. She was defeated, however, by Republican candidate [[Mel Mart\u00ednez]] in a close race on November 2, 2004. The overwhelming support for Mart\u00ednez among Latinos effectively counterbalanced Castor's relatively high popularity among swing voters throughout the state.\n\nThere was some speculation that Castor would run for [[Governor of Florida]] in 2006 to replace [[Jeb Bush]], who was ineligible for re-election due to term limits, but she announced in 2005 that she would not be a candidate.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = 2004 United States Senate election in Florida<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#9|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = Melqu\u00edades Rafael Mart\u00ednez Ruiz\n | votes      = 3,672,864\n | percentage = 49.43\n | change     = +11.9%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = Elizabeth Castor\n | votes      = 3,590,201\n | percentage = 48.32\n | change     = \u221214.15%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Veterans Party of America\n | candidate  = Dennis F.

Democratic U.S. Representative [[Denise Majette]] became both the first African American and the first woman to be nominated for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. Republican U.S. Representative [[Johnny Isakson]] won the open seat.\n\nThe results were almost a complete reversal from the previous election in 2000.\n\nMajette's announcement that she would seek to replace Miller also caught Democrats by surprise, as she was not on anyone's call list when Democrats began seeking a candidate to replace Miller. Further skepticism among Democrats about the viability of her candidacy surfaced when she announced that \"God\" had told her to run for the Senate. She received important endorsements from U.S. Senators [[Mary Landrieu]] of Louisiana and [[Debbie Stabenow]] of Michigan, along with many others in Washington who campaigned and raised money for Majette. Her Senate campaign slogan was \"I'll be nobody's Senator, but yours.\"\n\nA number of factors led to Majette's loss. These include her late start, her valuable time and money spent in the runoff, larger conservative turnout from a proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages (which Majette opposed), the popularity of President [[George W. Bush]] in Georgia, and her lack of experience (being a one-term congresswoman).\n\n{{Election box begin no change\n | title      = Republican primary<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sos.georgia.gov/elections/election_results/2004_0720/0000120.htm |title=United States Senator |publisher=Sos.georgia.gov |accessdate=1 February 2019}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link no change\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Johnny Isakson]]\n | votes      = 346,765\n | percentage = 53.2%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link no change\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Herman Cain]]\n | votes      = 170,464\n | percentage = 26.2%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link no change\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Mac Collins]]\n | votes      = 134,053\n | percentage = 20.6%\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Georgia general election<ref>{{cite web | url = http://sos.georgia.gov/elections/election_results/2004_1102/002.htm| title = United States Senator | publisher = Georgia of Secretary of State | date = December 21, 2005 | accessdate = December 3, 2008}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Johnny Isakson]]\n | votes      = 1,864,205\n | percentage = 57.88\n | change     = +19.97%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Denise Majette]]\n | votes      = 1,287,695\n | percentage = 39.98\n | change     = \u221218.22%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Libertarian Party (US)\n | candidate  = Allen Buckley\n | votes      = 69,051\n | percentage = 2.14\n | change     = +2.14%\n}}\n{{Election box majority\n | votes      = 576,510\n | percentage = 17.90\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n | votes      = 3,220,951\n | percentage = \n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Hawaii ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = Hawaii Election\n| country           = Hawaii\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = 1998 United States Senate election in Hawaii\n| previous_year     = 1998\n| next_election     = 2010 United States Senate election in Hawaii\n| next_year         = 2010\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n\n| image1            = Daniel Inouye, official Senate photo portrait, 2008.jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Daniel Inouye]]'''\n| party1            = Democratic Party (US)\n| popular_vote1     = '''313,629'''\n| percentage1       = '''75.5%'''\n\n| image2            = Cam Cavasso.jpg\n| nominee2          = [[Campbell Cavasso|Cam Cavasso]]\n| party2            = Republican Party (US)\n| popular_vote2     = 87,172\n| percentage2       = 21.0%\n\n| map_image         = Hawaii_Election_Results_by_County,_all_Democratic.svg\n| map_size          = 100px\n| map_caption       = County Results\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Daniel Inouye]]\n| before_party      = Democratic Party (US)\n| after_election    = [[Daniel Inouye]]\n| after_party       = Democratic Party (US)\n}}\n{{Main|2004 United States Senate election in Hawaii}}\n{{See also|List of United States Senators from Hawaii}}\nIncumbent Democrat U.S. Senator [[Daniel Inouye]] won re-election to an eighth term over Republican, [[Campbell Cavasso]], a former state representative.\n\nInouye won every single county with at least 70% of the vote.

Despite the state Republican Party's strong history of embracing a moderate philosophy, the influence of conservatism among rank-and-file members had been steadily growing for decades; because of his liberal social views, Specter was often considered to be a \"[[Republican in Name Only]]\" by the right.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1J_9q-lIWRkC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=1998+ridge+itkin&source=bl&ots=AK6b-Ut25d&sig=ln8QefiZodyBTkRiIzEYxTt21Ro&hl=en&ei=cPjETOLTOoOglAenj8EH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCQQ6AEwBQ#v=snippet&q=klink&f=false|title=Pennsylvania Elections: Statewide Contests from 1950-2004|first=John J.|last=Kennedy|date=20 December 2017|publisher=University Press of America|accessdate=20 December 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref> Although Specter had a huge fundraising advantage, Toomey was aided by $2 million of advertising from the [[Club for Growth]], a conservative [[political action committee]] that focuses on fiscal issues and targets moderate Republican incumbents.  Toomey criticized Specter as a spendthrift on economic policy and as out of touch with his own party on social issues. Although Toomey had difficulty with name recognition early in the campaign, he built huge momentum over the final weeks preceding the primary, and Specter appeared to have transitioned from having a comfortable lead to being behind his challenger <ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nSpecter received a huge boost from the vocal support of President [[George W. Bush]]; most of the state's Republican establishment also closed ranks behind Specter. This included Pennsylvania's other U.S. Senator, [[Rick Santorum]], who was noted for his social conservative views.

The retirement of Democratic Senator [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] gave the Republicans an opportunity to pick up the seat and with no other interesting positions up for election in 2004, a crowded field developed in the Republican primary.  Furthermore, the Republicans were motivated by having President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] at the top of the ticket enabling them to ride his coattails to victory.\n\nFormer [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[David Beasley]], from the [[Pee Dee]], entered the race and quickly emerged as the frontrunner because of his support from the evangelical voters.  However, during his term as governor from 1994 to 1998 he had greatly angered the electorate by proposing to remove the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate Naval Jack]] from the dome of the statehouse and by being against the adoption of a [[South Carolina Education Lottery|state lottery]] to provide for college scholarships. Both positions led to the loss of his [[1998 South Carolina gubernatorial election|re-election in 1998]] and the issues continued to trouble him in the Senate race.\n\nThe battle for second place in the primary was between [[The Upstate|Upstate]] congressman, [[Jim DeMint]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] developer [[Thomas Ravenel]].  DeMint was able to squeak out a second-place finish because [[Charlie Condon]], a former [[South Carolina Attorney General|Attorney General of South Carolina]], split the [[South Carolina Low Country|Lowcountry]] vote with Ravenel thus providing DeMint the margin he needed.  In addition, while many voters were attracted to the Ravenel campaign and felt that he had a future in politics, they believed that he should set his sights on a less high-profile office first before trying to become senator.  Resigned to defeat, Ravenel endorsed DeMint in the runoff election.\n\nIn the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on June 22, 2004, DeMint scored a surprising victory over Beasley.  Ravenel's endorsement of DeMint proved crucial as the Lowcountry counties heavily went for the Representative from the Upstate.  Also, Beasley had burnt too many bridges while governor and was unable to increase his share of the vote in the runoff.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n\n|- style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | Republican Primary Election\n\n|-\n!

He stressed to the voters that he would follow conservative principles and provide an important Republican vote in the closely divided Senate.  Democrats fared poorly in statewide elections in South Carolina, so Tenenbaum tried to make the race about issues rather than party identification.  She attacked DeMint's support of the [[FairTax]] proposal because it would increase the sales tax by 23%.  The election victory by DeMint merely cemented South Carolina's shift to the Republican column as the best candidate the Democrats could offer was soundly defeated by the typical 10 point margin.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = South Carolina U.S. Senate Election, 2004}}\n {{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Jim DeMint]]\n | votes      = 857,167\n | percentage = 53.6\n | change     = +7.9%\n}}\n {{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Inez Tenenbaum]]\n | votes      = 704,384\n | percentage = 44.1\n | change     = \u22128.6%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Constitution Party (US)\n | candidate  = Patrick Tyndall\n | votes      = 13,464\n | percentage = 0.8\n | change     = +0.8%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Libertarian Party (US)\n | candidate  = Rebekah E.

Thune prevailed by a narrow 50.6\u201349.4% margin, of 4,508 votes. Senate Majority Leader [[Bill Frist]] visited South Dakota to campaign for Thune, breaking an unwritten tradition that one party's leader in the Senate would not campaign directly for the other's defeat. Daschle's loss resulted in the first ousting of a majority or minority leader since 1952 when Arizona Senator [[Ernest McFarland]] lost his seat to [[Barry Goldwater]]. Daschle's Senate term expired on January 3, 2005.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Thune, along with Frist, President Bush, and Vice President Cheney, frequently accused Daschle of being the \"chief obstructionist\" of Bush's agenda and charged him with using [[filibuster]]s to block confirmation of several of Bush's nominees to the federal judiciary. Thune also used moral values such as issues surrounding [[same-sex marriage]] and [[abortion]] to convince South Dakota voters that Daschle's positions on such topics were out-of-sync with the state's residents. The Republican candidate also drove home his strong support for the President while blasting Daschle for his vehement opposition to Bush. He attempted to sway voters by remembering that Bush won South Dakota in a landslide in 2000 and had a very high job-approval rating among South Dakotans. His opponent, the Minority Leader, repeatedly argued that he was funneling money into South Dakota for vital federal highway and water pet projects.\n\nDaschle responded to Thune's claim that he was a partisan anti-Bush obstructionist by pointing to his action just nine days after the [[September 11 attacks]] when he hugged President Bush on the Senate floor following Bush's address to Congress and the nation. He also hit back by alleging that Thune wanted to \"rubber stamp what the administration is doing.\" Daschle's use of the video of his embrace of Bush forced the [[Republican National Committee]] to demand that the ad be pulled, claiming that it suggests that Bush endorses Daschle. Shortly following the airing of the ad, in a nationally televised debate on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]'', Thune accused Daschle of \"emboldening the enemy\" in his skepticism of the [[Iraq War]].\n\nDaschle also noticeably relied very heavily on the power of incumbency to win a fourth term. Some also argued that [[Stephanie Herseth Sandlin|Stephanie Herseth]]'s election to the state's only House seat hurt Daschle, as voters may not have been comfortable sending an all-Democratic delegation to Congress for the first time in many decades. Accusations that Daschle was possibly considering no longer being an official resident of South Dakota was believed to have offended voters there. Others have analyzed that Daschle's lengthy consideration and eventual rejection of a potential run for the presidency in 2004 took a toll on South Dakotans, who felt betrayed and used by Daschle as a result.\n\nWhen the race began in early 2004, Daschle led by 7 points in January and February. By May, his lead minimized to just 2 points and into the summer polls showed a varying number of trends: either Daschle held a slim 1- to 2-point lead or Thune held a slim 1- to 2-point lead or the race was tied right down the middle. Throughout September, Daschle led Thune by margins of 2 to 5 percent while during the entire month of October into the November 2 election, most polls showed that Thune and Daschle were dead even, usually tied 49\u201349 among likely voters. Some polls showed either Thune or Daschle leading by extremely slim margins.\n\nThune was an aide to former Senator [[James Abdnor]], the man Daschle defeated in 1986 to gain his seat in the Senate.\n\nDaschle spent a great deal of time and energy campaigning for his fellow Democrat [[Tim Johnson (South Dakota)|Tim Johnson]] in 2002, who barely defeated Thune by 524 votes. He argued that by re-electing Johnson, [[South Dakota]] would be better off because Johnson would help to keep Daschle Majority Leader. However, in the end, while Johnson won, other states voted for enough Republicans that Daschle was no longer majority leader. Furthermore, Thune's whisker-close defeat in 2002 freed him up to run against Daschle in 2004. Had Daschle not put his considerable weight to re-electing Johnson, it seems very likely that Thune would have beaten Johnson, leaving Daschle without a strong challenger for the upcoming election and making his re-election a certainty.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = South Dakota general election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#41|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[John Thune]]\n | votes      = 197,848\n | percentage = 50.58\n | change     = +14.17%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Tom Daschle]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 193,340\n | percentage = 49.42\n | change     = \u221212.72%\n}}\n{{Election box majority\n | votes      = 4,508\n | percentage = 1.15\n | change     = \u221224.58%\n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n | votes      = 391,188\n | percentage = \n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Utah ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = Utah Election\n| country           = Utah\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = 1998 United States Senate election in Utah\n| previous_year     = 1998\n| next_election     = 2010 United States Senate election in Utah\n| next_year         = 2010\n| flag_year         = 1913\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n\n| image1            = Bob Bennett official portrait, 2009.jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]]'''\n| party1            = Republican Party (US)\n| popular_vote1     = '''626,640'''\n| percentage1       = '''68.7%'''\n\n| image2            = No image.svg\n| nominee2          = Paul Van Dam\n| party2            = Democratic Party (US)\n| popular_vote2     = 258,955\n| percentage2       = 28.4%\n\n| map_image         = Utah allred.png\n| map_size          = 200px\n| map_caption       = County results\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]]\n| before_party      = Republican Party (US)\n| after_election    = [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]]\n| after_party       = Republican Party (US)\n}}\n{{Main|2004 United States Senate election in Utah}}\n{{See also|List of United States Senators from Utah}}\nIncumbent Republican Bob Bennett won re-election to a third term easily beating Democrat Paul Van Dam, former [[Attorney General of Utah]] and former [[Salt Lake County]] District Attorney\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Utah general election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#44|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 626,640\n | percentage = 68.73\n | change     = +4.75%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = Paul Van Dam\n | votes      = 258,955\n | percentage = 28.40\n | change     = \u22124.57%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Constitution Party (US)\n | candidate  = Gary R.

Nethercutt was also hampered by his lack of name recognition in the more densely populated western part of the state, home to two-thirds of the state's population. Washington has not elected a senator from east of the [[Cascade Mountains|Cascades]] since [[Miles Poindexter]] in 1916. Other important issues included national security and the [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003\u2013present|war in Iraq]]. Nethercutt supported the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion]] of Iraq, while Murray opposed it. Nethercutt was a heavy underdog from the start, and his campaign never gained much traction.

This was the first general election after an [[Representation of the People Act 1884|extension of the franchise]] and [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885|redistribution of seats]]. For the first time a majority of adult males could vote and most constituencies by law returned a single member to Parliament fulfilling one of the ideals of [[Chartism]] to provide direct single-member, single-electorate accountability. It saw the Liberals, led by [[William Ewart Gladstone]], win the most seats, but not an overall majority.  As the [[Irish Nationalist]]s held the balance of power between them and the Conservatives who sat with an increasing number of allied Unionist MPs (referring to the [[Acts of Union 1800|Union of Great Britain and Ireland]]), this exacerbated divisions within the Liberals over [[Irish Home Rule]] and led to a Liberal split and another [[1886 United Kingdom general election|general election the following year]].\n\nThe 1885 election saw the first [[socialist]] party participate, with the [[Social Democratic Federation]] led by [[H. M. Hyndman]] standing three candidates.\n{{UK general election navigation|clear=none|1874|1880|1885|1886|1892}}\n\n==Results==\n\n{| style=\"width:70%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ style=\"width:50.0%;

This was the first general election after an [[Representation of the People Act 1884|extension of the franchise]] and [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885|redistribution of seats]]. For the first time a majority of adult males could vote and most constituencies by law returned a single member to Parliament fulfilling one of the ideals of [[Chartism]] to provide direct single-member, single-electorate accountability. It saw the Liberals, led by [[William Ewart Gladstone]], win the most seats, but not an overall majority.  As the [[Irish Nationalist]]s held the balance of power between them and the Conservatives who sat with an increasing number of allied Unionist MPs (referring to the [[Acts of Union 1800|Union of Great Britain and Ireland]]), this exacerbated divisions within the Liberals over [[Irish Home Rule]] and led to a Liberal split and another [[1886 United Kingdom general election|general election the following year]].\n\nThe 1885 election saw the first [[socialist]] party participate, with the [[Social Democratic Federation]] led by [[H. M. Hyndman]] standing three candidates.\n{{UK general election navigation|clear=none|1874|1880|1885|1886|1892}}\n\n==Results==\n\n{| style=\"width:70%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ style=\"width:50.0%;

[[Gladstone]], appealing to moralistic evangelicals, led the attack on the foreign policy of [[Disraeli]] (now known as Lord Beaconsfield) as immoral.{{sfn|Matthew|1997|pp=293\u2013312}} Historian Paul Smith paraphrases the rhetorical tone which focused on attacking \"Beaconsfieldism\" (in Smith's words) as a:{{quote|Sinister system of policy, which not merely involved the country in immoral, vainglorious and expensive external adventures, inimical to peace and to the rights of small peoples, but aimed at nothing less than the subversion of parliamentary government in favour of some [[simulacrum]] of the oriental despotism its creator was alleged to admire.{{sfn|Smith|1996|pages=198\u201399}}\n}}\n\nSmith notes that there was indeed some substance to the allegations, but: \"Most of this was partisan extravaganza, worthy of its target's own excursions against the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]].\"{{sfn|Smith|1996|p=199}}\n\n[[File:Leeds Town Hall, General Election results.jpg|thumb|Crowds wait outside [[Leeds Town Hall]] to hear the result]]\nDisraeli himself was now the [[Earl of Beaconsfield]] in the [[House of Lords]], and custom did not allow peers to campaign. His party was unable to deal effectively with the rhetorical onslaught. Although he had improved the organisation of the Conservative Party, Disraeli was firmly based in the rural gentry,  and had little contact with or understanding of the urban middle class that was increasingly dominating his party.\n\nBesides their trouble with foreign policy issues, it was even more important that the Conservatives were unable to effectively defend their economic record on the home front. The 1870s coincided with a [[Long Depression|long-term global depression]] caused by the collapse of the worldwide railway boom of the 1870s which previously had been so profitable to Britain. The stress was growing by the late 1870s; prices fell, profits fell, employment fell, and there was downward pressure on wage rates that caused much hardship among the industrial working class. The [[free trade]] system supported by both parties made Britain defenceless against the flood of cheap wheat from [[North America]], which was exacerbated by the worst harvest of the century in Britain in 1879. The party in power got the blame, and Liberals repeatedly emphasised the growing budget deficit as a measure of bad stewardship. In the election itself, Disraeli's party lost heavily up and down the line, especially in Scotland and Ireland, and in the urban boroughs. His Conservative strength fell from 351 to 238, while the Liberals jumped from 250 to 353. Disraeli resigned on 21 April 1880.{{sfnm|Smith|1996|1pp=202\u20133|Blake|1967|2pp=707\u201313, 717}}\n\n==Regional results==\n\n===Great Britain===\n{{Plain image with caption |United Kingdom general election 1885 (by country).svg |Largest party in each constituent country |250px |right |bottom |triangle}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=2 |Party \n!

As a result of the campaign, the Liberal leaders, [[Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Lord Hartington]] and [[Granville George Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Granville]], withdrew in favour of Gladstone, who thus became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] a second time. It was the last election when the Liberals, or any party other than the Conservatives would win a majority of the votes cast in a general election.\n{{UK general election navigation|clear=none|1868|1874|1880|1885|1886}}\n\n==Results summary==\n\n{| style=\"width:70%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ style=\"width:50.0%; text-align:right\" | \u2193{{fsp}}\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"color:black; background:{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}; width:53.99%;\" | '''352'''\n| style=\"background:{{Conservative and Liberal Unionist/meta/color}}; width:36.35%;\" | '''237'''\n| style=\"color: black; background:{{Home Rule League/meta/color}}; width:9.66%;\" | '''63'''\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:black;\">'''Liberal'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:{{Conservative and Liberal Unionist/meta/color}};\">'''Conservative'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:black;\">'''Home Rule'''</span>\n|}\n\n{{Election Summary Begin with Candidates| title = UK General Election 1880}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Candidates|\n  |party      = Liberal Party (UK)\n  |candidates = 499\n  |seats      = 352\n  |gain       = \n  |loss       = \n  |net        = +110\n  |votes      = 1,836,423\n  |votes %    = 54.66\n  |seats %    = 53.99\n  |plus/minus = +2.7\n  |government = yes\n  |vps        = 5,217\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Candidates|\n  |party      = Conservative Party (UK)\n  |candidates = 521\n  |seats      = 237\n  |gain       = \n  |loss       = \n  |net        = &minus;113\n  |votes      = 1,426,351\n  |votes %    = 42.46\n  |seats %    = 36.35\n  |plus/minus = &minus;1.8\n  |vps        = 6,019\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Candidates|\n  |party      = Home Rule League\n  |candidates = 81\n  |seats      = 63\n  |gain       = \n  |loss       = \n  |net        = +3\n  |votes      = 95,535\n  |votes %    = 2.84\n  |seats %    = 9.66\n  |plus/minus = &minus;0.9\n  |vps        = 1,516\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Candidates|\n  |party      = Independent (politician)\n  |candidates = 2\n  |seats      = 0\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = 0\n  |votes      = 1,107\n  |votes %    = 0.03\n  |seats %    =0 \n  |plus/minus = 0\n  |vps        = N/A\n}}\n|}\n\n{{hatnote|Total votes cast: 3,359,416.}}\n\n===Voting summary===\n{{bar box\n|title=Popular vote\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|width=600px\n|barwidth=380px\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|'''Liberal'''|{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}|54.66}}\n{{bar percent|Conservative|{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}|42.46}}\n{{bar percent|Home Rule|{{Home Rule League/meta/color}}|2.84}}\n{{bar percent|Others|#777777|0.03}}\n}}\n\n===Seats summary===\n{{bar box\n|title=Parliamentary seats\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|width=600px\n|barwidth=380px\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|'''Liberal'''|{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}|53.99}}\n{{bar percent|Conservative|{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}|36.35}}\n{{bar percent|Home Rule|{{Home Rule League/meta/color}}|9.66}}\n}}\n\n==Issues==\nThe Conservative government was doomed by the poor condition of the British economy and the vulnerability of its foreign policy to moralistic attacks by the Liberals. [[Gladstone]], appealing to moralistic evangelicals, led the attack on the foreign policy of [[Disraeli]] (now known as Lord Beaconsfield) as immoral.{{sfn|Matthew|1997|pp=293\u2013312}} Historian Paul Smith paraphrases the rhetorical tone which focused on attacking \"Beaconsfieldism\" (in Smith's words) as a:{{quote|Sinister system of policy, which not merely involved the country in immoral, vainglorious and expensive external adventures, inimical to peace and to the rights of small peoples, but aimed at nothing less than the subversion of parliamentary government in favour of some [[simulacrum]] of the oriental despotism its creator was alleged to admire.{{sfn|Smith|1996|pages=198\u201399}}\n}}\n\nSmith notes that there was indeed some substance to the allegations, but: \"Most of this was partisan extravaganza, worthy of its target's own excursions against the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]].\"{{sfn|Smith|1996|p=199}}\n\n[[File:Leeds Town Hall, General Election results.jpg|thumb|Crowds wait outside [[Leeds Town Hall]] to hear the result]]\nDisraeli himself was now the [[Earl of Beaconsfield]] in the [[House of Lords]], and custom did not allow peers to campaign. His party was unable to deal effectively with the rhetorical onslaught. Although he had improved the organisation of the Conservative Party, Disraeli was firmly based in the rural gentry,  and had little contact with or understanding of the urban middle class that was increasingly dominating his party.\n\nBesides their trouble with foreign policy issues, it was even more important that the Conservatives were unable to effectively defend their economic record on the home front. The 1870s coincided with a [[Long Depression|long-term global depression]] caused by the collapse of the worldwide railway boom of the 1870s which previously had been so profitable to Britain. The stress was growing by the late 1870s; prices fell, profits fell, employment fell, and there was downward pressure on wage rates that caused much hardship among the industrial working class. The [[free trade]] system supported by both parties made Britain defenceless against the flood of cheap wheat from [[North America]], which was exacerbated by the worst harvest of the century in Britain in 1879. The party in power got the blame, and Liberals repeatedly emphasised the growing budget deficit as a measure of bad stewardship. In the election itself, Disraeli's party lost heavily up and down the line, especially in Scotland and Ireland, and in the urban boroughs. His Conservative strength fell from 351 to 238, while the Liberals jumped from 250 to 353. Disraeli resigned on 21 April 1880.{{sfnm|Smith|1996|1pp=202\u20133|Blake|1967|2pp=707\u201313, 717}}\n\n==Regional results==\n\n===Great Britain===\n{{Plain image with caption |United Kingdom general election 1885 (by country).svg |Largest party in each constituent country |250px |right |bottom |triangle}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=2 |Party \n!
