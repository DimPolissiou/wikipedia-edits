Though declared a national park March 24, 1927, it had its official opening ceremonies on August 10, 1928 performed by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]].<ref name=\"parkhistory\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/sk/princealbert/natcul/natcul1/b.aspx\n| title = Prince Albert National Park of Canada \u2013 Park Era History\n| publisher = [[Parks Canada]]\n| date = 2009-08-10\n| accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref> The park is open all year but the most visited period is from May to September. Although named for the city, the park's main entrance is actually 80&nbsp;km (50&nbsp;mi) north of [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]] via Highways [[Saskatchewan Highway 2|2]] and [[Saskatchewan Highway 263|263]] which enters the park at its southeast corner. Two additional secondary highways enter the park, [[Saskatchewan Highway 264|No. 264]], which branches off Hwy. 2 just east of the [[Waskesiu Lake, Saskatchewan|Waskesiu townsite]], and [[Saskatchewan Highway 240|No. 240]], which enters the park from the south and links with 263 just outside the entry fee-collection gates.\n\nThe park ranges in elevation from {{convert|488|m|ft|abbr=on}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} on the western side to {{convert|724|m|ft|abbr=on}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} on the eastern side.\n\nThe hamlet Waskesiu Lake is the only settlement within the park, located on the southern shore of [[Waskesiu Lake|the same-named lake]]. Most facilities and services one would expect to find in a multi-use park are available.\n\nThe park also contains the cabin of [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[conservation movement|conservationist]] [[Grey Owl]], on [[Ajawaan Lake]].\n\nThe development of the park as a recreation destination has led to the region immediately southeast of the park boundaries&nbsp;\u2013 locations such as Christopher Lake, Emma Lake, Sunnyside Beach, and Anglin Lake, themselves becoming popular recreation destinations. Additional development has taken place just beyond the park's eastern entry.\n\nUntil the establishment of [[Grasslands National Park]] in the 1980s, this was the province's only national park.\n\n==Biology==\n[[File:2005-10-09 2-03-30 PM 0194.jpg|thumb|right|Mixed forest alongside roadway]]\nPrince Albert National Park represents the southern [[boreal forest]] region of Canada.  It is a rolling, mostly forested landscape that takes in the [[drainage divide]] between the [[North Saskatchewan River|North Saskatchewan]] and [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill Rivers]].\n\nThe very southern part of the park is predominantly [[aspen]] forest with an understory of elderberry, honeysuckle, rose and other shrubs and openings and meadows of [[fescue grassland]].  The fescue grasslands are considered ecologically important because of their rarity; outside the park, most of the native fescue grasslands have been lost to the plough or to urban development.  The aspen forest/meadow mosaic in the southwest corner of the park is particularly unique as it sustains a growing herd of more than 400 [[plains bison]], the only free-ranging herd in its original range in Canada that has a full array of native predators, including [[northwestern wolf|timber wolves]].\n\nMost of the park is dominated by [[coniferous]] forests, with the cover of [[jack pine]] and [[white spruce]] becoming more prevalent the farther north one goes. [[Boreal woodland caribou]] from a regional population that is declining due to loss of habitat to forest logging range sometimes into the park, but their core habitat lies outside the park to the north. [[White-tailed deer]], [[Manitoban elk|elk]] and, locally, [[western moose|moose]] are the common [[ungulates]].  Wolves are fairly common.<ref name=\"teacher\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.pc.gc.ca/apprendre-learn/prof/itm2-crp-trc/htm/fprincealbert_e.asp\n |title       = Teacher Resource Centre&nbsp;\u2013 Prince Albert National Park of Canada\n |publisher   = [[Parks Canada]]\n |accessdate  = 2010-02-11\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605100932/http://www.pc.gc.ca/apprendre-learn/prof/itm2-crp-trc/htm/fprincealbert_e.asp\n |archivedate = 2011-06-05\n}}</ref>\n\nThe park is noted for its numerous lakes including three very large lakes - [[Waskesiu Lake|Waskesiu]], [[Kingsmere Lake|Kingsmere]] and [[Crean Lake|Crean]].  The water quality is high and fish populations robust, except for [[lake trout]] that were commercially fished to near-extinction in Crean Lake in the early 20th century and, in spite of protection, have yet to recover their former numbers. [[Northern pike]], [[walleye]], [[Catostomidae|suckers]] and [[lake whitefish]] are among the most common larger fish.  One of Canada's largest [[American white pelican|white pelican]] colonies nests in an area closed to public use on [[Lavallee Lake, Saskatchewan|Lavallee Lake]] in the northwest corner of the park, and pelicans, [[loons]], [[mergansers]], [[osprey]]s and [[bald eagles]] are common in summer.  [[Otters]] are seen regularly, year round.   Winter is an especially good time to find otters as they spend considerable time around patches of open water on the Waskesiu Lake Narrows and the [[Kingsmere River|Kingsmere]] and [[Waskesiu River]]s.\n\n===Ecosystems===\nThe boreal forest extends northerly into the [[Canadian Shield]] area from the agricultural zones of southern Canada.  Prince Albert National Park lies south of the Shield in landscapes that were shaped by [[Pleistocene]] [[glaciers]] that deposited glacial till, sand and other materials that were later colonized by trees and shrubs.  The ecosystems of Prince Albert National Park are lush and productive.  During the warm, humid summers there is abundant insect life and numerous fungi, sustaining a remarkable diversity of boreal birds and other wildlife.  There are many lakes and rivers creating wonderful water systems for a variety of waterfowl.<ref name=\"teacher\" />\n\n===Wildlife===\nSome of the many animals are [[Manitoban elk|elk]], [[western moose|moose]], [[red fox]]es, [[North American beaver|beaver]]s, [[white-tailed deer]], [[American badger|badger]]s, [[plains bison|bison]], [[North American river otter|river otter]]s, [[American red squirrel|red squirrel]]s, [[American black bear|black bear]]s, [[northeastern coyote|coyote]]s, and [[Northwestern wolf|timber wolves]]. A herd of plains bison roams in the southern areas of the park where grasslands mix with woodlands. [[Tyrant flycatchers|Flycatchers]], [[Tennessee warbler]]s, [[double-crested cormorants]], [[red-necked grebe]]s, [[brown creeper]]s, [[nuthatches]], [[American three-toed woodpecker|three-toed woodpecker]]s, [[bald eagle]]s, osprey, [[great blue herons]], many species of [[ducks]], and the [[common loon]] are just a few of the water fowl and birds which make their home in the park.  There are 21 species of fish recorded in the park, including [[Iowa darter]], [[yellow perch]], [[brook stickleback]], [[spottail shiner]], [[Cisco (fish)|cisco]], northern pike (locally called \"jack fish\"), [[walleye]] (locally called \"pickeral\"), and lake trout.<ref name=\"teacher\" /> Although most people visit the park in summer, the best wildlife watching is often in the winter.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Greyowls cabin ajawaan lake.jpg|thumb|[[Grey Owl]]'s cabin \"Beaverlodge\", [[Ajawaan Lake]].]]\n[[File:Graves go an sd.jpg|thumb|Graves of Grey Owl, [[Anahareo]] and Shirley Dawn at Ajawaan Lake.]]\n[[File:Bever lodgeGrey.JPG|thumb|The [[beaver lodge]] inside Grey Owl's cabin.]]\n\nBP \u2013 before present.\n\nThere are archeological traces of pre-history in the park reserve in the form of tools which have been located.\n*Early Pre contact (11,000 to 7500 BP)\n*Middle Pre contact (7500 to 2000 BP)\n*Late Pre contact (2000 to 200 BP)\n*Post Contact or Historic (200 BP to Present).\n\nAt [[Waskesiu Lake]] was an early [[Hudson's Bay Company]] fur trade post between 1886 and 1893.\n\nIn the early 20th century the industries of fishing and logging were carried out in this boreal forested area.  The large 1919 forest fire eliminated the logging industry.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/sk/princealbert/natcul/natcul1/a.aspx\n| title = Prince Albert National Park of Canada \u2013 Pre-Park Area History\n| publisher = [[Parks Canada]]\n| date = 2009-08-14\n| accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref>\n\nThe park was the subject of a short film in 2011's ''[[National Parks Project]]'', directed by [[St\u00e9phane Lafleur]] and scored by [[Andre Ethier (musician)|Andre Ethier]], [[Mathieu Charbonneau]] and [[Rebecca Foon]].\n\n===Grey Owl===\nThe Dominion Parks Service hired [[Grey Owl]], Archibald Stanfield Belaney (1888-April 13, 1938), as the first naturalist.  He lived on [[Ajawaan Lake]] in Prince Albert National Park and wrote of wilderness protection: ''Pilgrims of the Wild'' (1935), ''Sajo and the Beaver People'' (1935) and ''Empty Cabin'' (1936).<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/sk/princealbert/natcul/natcul1/c.aspx\n| title = Prince Albert National Park of Canada \u2013 Grey Owl\n| publisher = [[Parks Canada]]\n| date = 2009-08-14\n| accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref> He was played by Pierce Brosnan in the feature film, Grey Owl (1999).\n\n==Activities==\nThere are many things to do in this park:\n\n===Scenic driving tours===\nThere are a few main roads through the park.\n* The Narrows Road along Waskesiu Lake's southern shore, with many points of interest and picnic areas, ending at a 200-metre narrows, where there is a campground.\n* Lakeview Drive or Scenic Route #263 which provides access to several other lakes: Namekus, Trappers, Sandy (also called Halkett); as well as many trails.\n* [[Saskatchewan Highway 264|Highway 264]] to Kingsmere River, which accesses a small boat or canoe launch site midway between Kingsmere and Waskesiu lakes, and a trail through a railway portage to Kingsmere Lake.\n\n===Picnicking===\nThere are many picnic sites within the park, set up with picnic tables, scenic views, campfire pits and swimming areas.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/sk/princealbert/activ/activ2.aspx\n| title = Prince Albert National Park of Canada \u2013 Picnicking & Day Use\n| publisher = [[Parks Canada]]\n| date = 2010-02-08\n| accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref>\n*Namekus Lake\n*Sandy Lake\n*South Gate\n*Meridian Day\n*South Bay\n*Trippes Beach\n*King Island\n*Paignton Beach\n*The Narrows\n*Waskesiu River\n*Waskesiu Landing (Main Marina)\n*Point View\n*Birch Bay\n*Heart Lakes\n*Kingsmere\n\n===Hiking===\nThese trails are 3 kilometres in length or less.

There are also good beaches at the south end of Kingsmere Lake (boat or trail access), Namekus Lake, and Sandy Lake.\n\n===Canoeing===\nBagwa Canoe Route and  Bladebone Canoe Route are two canoe routes of varying lengths.  As well the park offers a multitude of lakes which are amenable to the canoe enthusiast.  Amiskowan, Shady, Heart, Kingsmere and Waskesiu lakes  are just a few of them.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/sk/princealbert/activ/activ5.aspx\n| title = Prince Albert National Park of Canada \u2013 Canoeing\n| publisher = [[Parks Canada]]\n| date = 2010-02-08\n| accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref>\n\n===Boating===\nPower boats are only permitted on some Prince Albert National Park lakes. Motor boats are allowed on Waskesiu, Crean, Kingsmere, Sandy and the Hanging Heart Lakes. There is a limit of 40 horse power motors on Kingsmere. The Waskesiu Marina, Heart Lakes Marina and the Narrows have boat launches (permit and fee required) and docks. Boat, canoe and kayak rentals are available at all three, by the hour or by the day. The Waskesiu Marina has a concrete breakwater. A permit is required to use boat launch facilities. Personal watercraft are not allowed on any lakes. Canoes, kayaks and sail boats are allowed on all waters.\n\n===Fishing===\nJust like those who used the waters for commercial fishing in the early 20th century, campers may also find relaxation fishing for  northern pike, walleye, lake trout, whitefish, or yellow perch.  The park requires purchase of its own licences to fish in the park.  Limits and seasons are different than in the province of Saskatchewan. Some areas, e.g., spawning grounds, are closed to fishing.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/sk/princealbert/activ/activ7.aspx\n| title = Prince Albert National Park of Canada \u2013 Fishing\n| publisher = [[Parks Canada]]\n| date = 2010-02-08\n| accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref>\n\n===Camping===\nAt this park one can choose from serviced or unserviced 'front country' camping or go by canoe/boat and backpacking, and choose 'back country' camping. Most back country camping occurs on Kingsmere and Crean lakes.  Permits and fees are required for all camping, whether front or back country.  Front country sites can be reserved by website or telephone.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/sk/princealbert/visit/reserv.aspx\n| title = Prince Albert National Park of Canada \u2013 Campground Reservations\n| publisher = [[Parks Canada]]\n| date = 2010-01-25\n| accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref>\n\nOpen fires are allowed at campsites (Excluding Red Deer Campground), after payment for a \"fire permit\" (fire permits are not required in picnic areas).\n\nThe following are accessible by automobile and can accommodate trailers and motorhomes:\n*Beaver Glen Campground on the east margins of the Waskesiu town site has electricity to half of its 213 sites (no water or septic hook-ups), washrooms with hot and cold water and showers, central septic tank service and drinking water. Sites can be booked in advance through the Parks Canada Campground Reservation Service through a toll free number or via online reservation. Details about how to reserve can be found at the Parks Canada website.\n*Red Deer Campground, formerly \"Trailer Court\" is to the immediate South-West of Beaver Glen in the Waskesiu townsite. This site has power, water and sewage hookups at each of its 161 pull through sites and is designed for large trailers and motorhomes. There are no open fires are allowed at Red Deer. Sites in Red Deer can be booked in advance in the same way as Beaver Glen.\n*The Narrows Campground has flush toilet washrooms with cold water only, and no other services. Sites at The Narrows are First Come First Served.\n*Namekus, Trappers, Sandy Lakes have septic tank toilets, water source (not drinkable without treatment). These sites are also First Come First Served.\n\nThere are a series of boat-accessible campsites&nbsp;\u2013 the level of waves that can come up with overnight weather changes on Waskesiu, Kingsmere and Crean lakes, provide some risk for boats that cannot be completely pulled out of the water at night.\n\n===Interpretive programs===\nThe nature centre in the Waskesiu townsite has information about interpretive programs\n* Freight Trail&nbsp;\u2013 27&nbsp;km one way\n* Elk Trail&nbsp;\u2013 39&nbsp;km one way\n* Fish Lake Trail&nbsp;\u2013 12&nbsp;km one way\n* Hunters Lake Trail&nbsp;\u2013 12&nbsp;km one way\n* Westside Boundary Trail&nbsp;\u2013 37&nbsp;km one way\n* Red Deer Trail&nbsp;\u2013 three loops totalling 17&nbsp;km\n* Kinowa Trail&nbsp;\u2013 5&nbsp;km one way\n* Amyot Lake Trail&nbsp;\u2013 15.5&nbsp;km loop\n\nBicycle rentals are available in Waskesiu townsite.\n\n===Wildlife and bird watching===\nFlycatchers, Tennessee warblers, red-necked grebe, brown creepers, nuthatches, three-toed woodpeckers, bald eagle, osprey, great blue herons, common loon are just a few of the many bird species to be seen in the park.  Elk, black bear, fox, moose, beaver, deer, otter are a sampling of wild life of the park area.<ref name=\"cycling\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/sk/princealbert/activ/activ9.aspx\n| title = Prince Albert National Park of Canada \u2013 Cycling\n| publisher = [[Parks Canada]]\n| date = 2010-02-08\n| accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.virtualsk.com/current_issue/panp.html\n| title = Prince Albert National Park\n| publisher = Virtual Saskatchewan\n| year = 2007\n| accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref>\n\nAlthough most people visit the park in summer, the best wildlife watching is often in the winter.   Wolves often travel on the frozen lakes and along the ploughed roads, and elk and deer are common right in the town of Waskesiu.  Open water at the Narrows on Waskesiu Lake and where the Waskesiu River exits from the lake makes otter sightings very reliable.  Foxes, including the red, cross and silver colour phases, are frequent sightings in winter too.\n\n===Aurora watching===\nDue to the park's northern latitude, [[Auroras]] are very common on clear nights even when solar activity is relatively low.\n\n===Golfing===\n[[Stanley Thompson]] designed an 18-hole golf course in the park. It was built in the early 1930s.

Though declared a national park March 24, 1927, it had its official opening ceremonies on August 10, 1928 performed by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]].<ref name=\"parkhistory\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/sk/princealbert/natcul/natcul1/b.aspx\n| title = Prince Albert National Park of Canada \u2013 Park Era History\n| publisher = [[Parks Canada]]\n| date = 2009-08-10\n| accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref> The park is open all year but the most visited period is from May to September. Although named for the city, the park's main entrance is actually 80&nbsp;km (50&nbsp;mi) north of [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]] via Highways [[Saskatchewan Highway 2|2]] and [[Saskatchewan Highway 263|263]] which enters the park at its southeast corner. Two additional secondary highways enter the park, [[Saskatchewan Highway 264|No. 264]], which branches off Hwy. 2 just east of the [[Waskesiu Lake, Saskatchewan|Waskesiu townsite]], and [[Saskatchewan Highway 240|No. 240]], which enters the park from the south and links with 263 just outside the entry fee-collection gates.\n\nThe park ranges in elevation from {{convert|488|m|ft|abbr=on}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} on the western side to {{convert|724|m|ft|abbr=on}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} on the eastern side.\n\nThe hamlet Waskesiu Lake is the only settlement within the park, located on the southern shore of [[Waskesiu Lake|the same-named lake]]. Most facilities and services one would expect to find in a multi-use park are available.\n\nThe park also contains the cabin of [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[conservation movement|conservationist]] [[Grey Owl]], on [[Ajawaan Lake]].\n\nThe development of the park as a recreation destination has led to the region immediately southeast of the park boundaries&nbsp;\u2013 locations such as Christopher Lake, Emma Lake, Sunnyside Beach, and Anglin Lake, themselves becoming popular recreation destinations. Additional development has taken place just beyond the park's eastern entry.\n\nUntil the establishment of [[Grasslands National Park]] in the 1980s, this was the province's only national park.\n\n==Biology==\n[[File:2005-10-09 2-03-30 PM 0194.jpg|thumb|right|Mixed forest alongside roadway]]\nPrince Albert National Park represents the southern [[boreal forest]] region of Canada.  It is a rolling, mostly forested landscape that takes in the [[drainage divide]] between the [[North Saskatchewan River|North Saskatchewan]] and [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill Rivers]].\n\nThe very southern part of the park is predominantly [[aspen]] forest with an understory of elderberry, honeysuckle, rose and other shrubs and openings and meadows of [[fescue grassland]].  The fescue grasslands are considered ecologically important because of their rarity; outside the park, most of the native fescue grasslands have been lost to the plough or to urban development.  The aspen forest/meadow mosaic in the southwest corner of the park is particularly unique as it sustains a growing herd of more than 400 [[plains bison]], the only free-ranging herd in its original range in Canada that has a full array of native predators, including [[northwestern wolf|timber wolves]].\n\nMost of the park is dominated by [[coniferous]] forests, with the cover of [[jack pine]] and [[white spruce]] becoming more prevalent the farther north one looks. [[Boreal woodland caribou]] from a regional population that is declining due to loss of habitat to forest logging range sometimes into the park, but their core habitat lies outside the park to the north. [[White-tailed deer]], [[Manitoban elk|elk]] and, locally, [[western moose|moose]] are the common [[ungulates]].  Wolves are fairly common.<ref name=\"teacher\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.pc.gc.ca/apprendre-learn/prof/itm2-crp-trc/htm/fprincealbert_e.asp\n |title       = Teacher Resource Centre&nbsp;\u2013 Prince Albert National Park of Canada\n |publisher   = [[Parks Canada]]\n |accessdate  = 2010-02-11\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605100932/http://www.pc.gc.ca/apprendre-learn/prof/itm2-crp-trc/htm/fprincealbert_e.asp\n |archivedate = 2011-06-05\n}}</ref>\n\nThe park is noted for its numerous lakes including three very large lakes - [[Waskesiu Lake|Waskesiu]], [[Kingsmere Lake|Kingsmere]] and [[Crean Lake|Crean]].  The water quality is high and fish populations robust, except for [[lake trout]] that were commercially fished to near-extinction in Crean Lake in the early 20th century and, in spite of protection, have yet to recover their former numbers. [[Northern pike]], [[walleye]], [[Catostomidae|suckers]] and [[lake whitefish]] are among the most common larger fish.  One of Canada's largest [[American white pelican|white pelican]] colonies nests in an area closed to public use on [[Lavallee Lake, Saskatchewan|Lavallee Lake]] in the northwest corner of the park, and pelicans, [[loons]], [[mergansers]], [[osprey]]s and [[bald eagles]] are common in summer.  [[Otters]] are seen regularly, year round.   Winter is an especially good time to find otters as they spend considerable time around patches of open water on the Waskesiu Lake Narrows and the [[Kingsmere River|Kingsmere]] and [[Waskesiu River]]s.\n\n===Ecosystems===\nThe boreal forest extends northerly into the [[Canadian Shield]] area from the agricultural zones of southern Canada.  Prince Albert National Park lies south of the Shield in landscapes that were shaped by [[Pleistocene]] [[glaciers]] that deposited glacial till, sand and other materials that were later colonized by trees and shrubs.  The ecosystems of Prince Albert National Park are lush and productive.  During the warm, humid summers there is abundant insect life and numerous fungi, sustaining a remarkable diversity of boreal birds and other wildlife.  There are many lakes and rivers creating wonderful water systems for a variety of waterfowl.<ref name=\"teacher\" />\n\n===Wildlife===\nSome of the many animals are [[Manitoban elk|elk]], [[western moose|moose]], [[red fox]]es, [[North American beaver|beaver]]s, [[white-tailed deer]], [[American badger|badger]]s, [[plains bison|bison]], [[North American river otter|river otter]]s, [[American red squirrel|red squirrel]]s, [[American black bear|black bear]]s, [[northeastern coyote|coyote]]s, and [[Northwestern wolf|timber wolves]]. A herd of plains bison roams in the southern areas of the park where grasslands mix with woodlands. [[Tyrant flycatchers|Flycatchers]], [[Tennessee warbler]]s, [[double-crested cormorants]], [[red-necked grebe]]s, [[brown creeper]]s, [[nuthatches]], [[American three-toed woodpecker|three-toed woodpecker]]s, [[bald eagle]]s, osprey, [[great blue herons]], many species of [[ducks]], and the [[common loon]] are just a few of the water fowl and birds which make their home in the park.  There are 21 species of fish recorded in the park, including [[Iowa darter]], [[yellow perch]], [[brook stickleback]], [[spottail shiner]], [[Cisco (fish)|cisco]], northern pike (locally called \"jack fish\"), [[walleye]] (locally called \"pickeral\"), and lake trout.<ref name=\"teacher\" /> Although most people visit the park in summer, the best wildlife watching is often in the winter.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Greyowls cabin ajawaan lake.jpg|thumb|[[Grey Owl]]'s cabin \"Beaverlodge\", [[Ajawaan Lake]].]]\n[[File:Graves go an sd.jpg|thumb|Graves of Grey Owl, [[Anahareo]] and Shirley Dawn at Ajawaan Lake.]]\n[[File:Bever lodgeGrey.JPG|thumb|The [[beaver lodge]] inside Grey Owl's cabin.]]\n\nBP \u2013 before present.\n\nThere are archeological traces of pre-history in the park reserve in the form of tools which have been located.\n*Early Pre contact (11,000 to 7500 BP)\n*Middle Pre contact (7500 to 2000 BP)\n*Late Pre contact (2000 to 200 BP)\n*Post Contact or Historic (200 BP to Present).\n\nAt [[Waskesiu Lake]] was an early [[Hudson's Bay Company]] fur trade post between 1886 and 1893.\n\nIn the early 20th century the industries of fishing and logging were carried out in this boreal forested area.  The large 1919 forest fire eliminated the logging industry.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/sk/princealbert/natcul/natcul1/a.aspx\n| title = Prince Albert National Park of Canada \u2013 Pre-Park Area History\n| publisher = [[Parks Canada]]\n| date = 2009-08-14\n| accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref>\n\nThe park was the subject of a short film in 2011's ''[[National Parks Project]]'', directed by [[St\u00e9phane Lafleur]] and scored by [[Andre Ethier (musician)|Andre Ethier]], [[Mathieu Charbonneau]] and [[Rebecca Foon]].\n\n===Grey Owl===\nThe Dominion Parks Service hired [[Grey Owl]], Archibald Stanfield Belaney (1888-April 13, 1938), as the first naturalist.  He lived on [[Ajawaan Lake]] in Prince Albert National Park and wrote of wilderness protection: ''Pilgrims of the Wild'' (1935), ''Sajo and the Beaver People'' (1935) and ''Empty Cabin'' (1936).<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/sk/princealbert/natcul/natcul1/c.aspx\n| title = Prince Albert National Park of Canada \u2013 Grey Owl\n| publisher = [[Parks Canada]]\n| date = 2009-08-14\n| accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref> He was played by Pierce Brosnan in the feature film, Grey Owl (1999).\n\n==Activities==\nThere are many things to do in this park:\n\n===Scenic driving tours===\nThere are a few main roads through the park.\n* The Narrows Road along Waskesiu Lake's southern shore, with many points of interest and picnic areas, ending at a 200-metre narrows, where there is a campground.\n* Lakeview Drive or Scenic Route #263 which provides access to several other lakes: Namekus, Trappers, Sandy (also called Halkett); as well as many trails.\n* [[Saskatchewan Highway 264|Highway 264]] to Kingsmere River, which accesses a small boat or canoe launch site midway between Kingsmere and Waskesiu lakes, and a trail through a railway portage to Kingsmere Lake.\n\n===Picnicking===\nThere are many picnic sites within the park, set up with picnic tables, scenic views, campfire pits and swimming areas.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/sk/princealbert/activ/activ2.aspx\n| title = Prince Albert National Park of Canada \u2013 Picnicking & Day Use\n| publisher = [[Parks Canada]]\n| date = 2010-02-08\n| accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref>\n*Namekus Lake\n*Sandy Lake\n*South Gate\n*Meridian Day\n*South Bay\n*Trippes Beach\n*King Island\n*Paignton Beach\n*The Narrows\n*Waskesiu River\n*Waskesiu Landing (Main Marina)\n*Point View\n*Birch Bay\n*Heart Lakes\n*Kingsmere\n\n===Hiking===\nThese trails are 3 kilometres in length or less.

As well the park offers a multitude of lakes which are amenable to the canoe enthusiast.  Amiskowan, Shady, Heart, Kingsmere and Waskesiu lakes  are just a few of them.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/sk/princealbert/activ/activ5.aspx\n| title = Prince Albert National Park of Canada \u2013 Canoeing\n| publisher = [[Parks Canada]]\n| date = 2010-02-08\n| accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref>\n\n===Boating===\nPower boats are only permitted on some Prince Albert National Park lakes. Motor boats are allowed on Waskesiu, Crean, Kingsmere, Sandy and the Hanging Heart Lakes. There is a limit of 40 horse power motors on Kingsmere. The Waskesiu Marina, Heart Lakes Marina and the Narrows have boat launches (permit and fee required) and docks. Boat, canoe and kayak rentals are available at all three, by the hour or by the day. The Waskesiu Marina has a concrete breakwater. A permit is required to use boat launch facilities. Personal watercraft are not allowed on any lakes. Canoes, kayaks and sail boats are allowed on all waters.\n\n===Fishing===\nJust like those who used the waters for commercial fishing in the early 20th century, campers may also find relaxation fishing for  northern pike, walleye, lake trout, whitefish, or yellow perch.  The park requires purchase of its own licences to fish in the park.  Limits and seasons are different than in the province of Saskatchewan. Some areas, e.g., spawning grounds, are closed to fishing.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/sk/princealbert/activ/activ7.aspx\n| title = Prince Albert National Park of Canada \u2013 Fishing\n| publisher = [[Parks Canada]]\n| date = 2010-02-08\n| accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref>\n\n===Camping===\nAt this park one can choose from serviced or unserviced 'front country' camping or go by canoe/boat and backpacking, and choose 'back country' camping. Most back country camping occurs on Kingsmere and Crean lakes.  Permits and fees are required for all camping, whether front or back country.

Sites can be booked in advance through the Parks Canada Campground Reservation Service through a toll free number or via online reservation. Details about how to reserve can be found at the Parks Canada website.\n*Red Deer Campground, formerly \"Trailer Court\" is to the immediate South-West of Beaver Glen in the Waskesiu townsite. This site has power, water and sewage hookups at each of its 161 pull through sites and is designed for large trailers and motorhomes. There are no open fires are allowed at Red Deer. Sites in Red Deer can be booked in advance in the same way as Beaver Glen.\n*The Narrows Campground has flush toilet washrooms with cold water only, and no other services. Sites at The Narrows are First Come First Served.\n*Namekus, Trappers, Sandy Lakes have septic tank toilets, water source (not drinkable without treatment). These sites are also First Come First Served.\n\nThere are a series of boat-accessible campsites&nbsp;\u2013 the level of waves that can come up with overnight weather changes on Waskesiu, Kingsmere and Crean lakes, provide some risk for boats that cannot be completely pulled out of the water at night.\n\n===Interpretive programs===\nThe nature centre in the Waskesiu townsite has information about interpretive programs\n* Freight Trail&nbsp;\u2013 27&nbsp;km one way\n* Elk Trail&nbsp;\u2013 39&nbsp;km one way\n* Fish Lake Trail&nbsp;\u2013 12&nbsp;km one way\n* Hunters Lake Trail&nbsp;\u2013 12&nbsp;km one way\n* Westside Boundary Trail&nbsp;\u2013 37&nbsp;km one way\n* Red Deer Trail&nbsp;\u2013 three loops totalling 17&nbsp;km\n* Kinowa Trail&nbsp;\u2013 5&nbsp;km one way\n* Amyot Lake Trail&nbsp;\u2013 15.5&nbsp;km loop\n\nBicycle rentals are available in Waskesiu townsite.\n\n===Wildlife and bird watching===\nFlycatchers, Tennessee warblers, red-necked grebe, brown creepers, nuthatches, three-toed woodpeckers, bald eagle, osprey, great blue herons, common loon are just a few of the many bird species to be seen in the park.  Elk, black bear, fox, moose, beaver, deer, otter are a sampling of wild life of the park area.<ref name=\"cycling\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/sk/princealbert/activ/activ9.aspx\n| title = Prince Albert National Park of Canada \u2013 Cycling\n| publisher = [[Parks Canada]]\n| date = 2010-02-08\n| accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.virtualsk.com/current_issue/panp.html\n| title = Prince Albert National Park\n| publisher = Virtual Saskatchewan\n| year = 2007\n| accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref>\n\nAlthough most people visit the park in summer, the best wildlife watching is often in the winter.   Wolves often travel on the frozen lakes and along the ploughed roads, and elk and deer are common right in the town of Waskesiu.  Open water at the Narrows on Waskesiu Lake and where the Waskesiu River exits from the lake makes otter sightings very reliable.  Foxes, including the red, cross and silver colour phases, are frequent sightings in winter too.\n\n===Aurora watching===\nDue to the park's northern latitude, [[Auroras]] are very common on clear nights even when solar activity is relatively low.\n\n===Golfing===\n[[Stanley Thompson]] designed an 18-hole golf course in the park. It was built in the early 1930s. Its official name is the Waskesiu Golf Course, but is often called \"The Lobstick\" after a tournament it hosts each year.<ref name=\"golf\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.waskesiugolf.com/default.aspx?page=11\n |title       = Course History\n |publisher   = Waskesiu Golf Club\n |accessdate  = 2010-02-11\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100412111626/http://www.waskesiugolf.com/default.aspx?page=11\n |archivedate = 2010-04-12\n}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n\nWaskesiu experiences a borderline [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]]/[[Subarctic climate|subarctic]] climate ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb''/''Dfc'').
