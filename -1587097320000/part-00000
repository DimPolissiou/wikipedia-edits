Red is where marital rape is criminalized, and yellow is non criminalized. ]]\n\nMarital rape is treated the same as any other rape in Pakistani law punishable with death by hanging or up to 25 years in prison. However, only one case of marital rape had been reported in Pakistan so far. A woman in Lahore filed a marital rape complaint against her husband in 2007.

He was nicknamed \"'''The Worm'''\" and is famous for his fierce [[Defense (sports)|defensive]] and [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] abilities.\n\nRodman played at the [[small forward]] position in his early years before becoming a [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]]. He earned [[NBA All-Defensive First Team]] honors seven times and won the [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]] twice. He also led the NBA in rebounds per game for a record seven consecutive years and won five NBA championships. His biography at [[NBA.com]] states that he is \"arguably the best rebounding forward in NBA history\".

After aborting a suicide attempt in 1993, he reinvented himself as a \"bad boy\" and became notorious for numerous controversial antics. He repeatedly dyed his hair in artificial colors, had many [[Body piercing|piercing]]s and [[tattoo]]s, and regularly disrupted games by clashing with opposing players and officials. He famously wore a [[wedding dress]] to promote his 1996 autobiography ''[[Bad As I Wanna Be]]''. Rodman pursued a high-profile affair with singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and was briefly married to actress [[Carmen Electra]]. Rodman also attracted international attention for his visits to [[North Korea]] and his subsequent befriending of North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-un]] in 2013.\n\nIn addition to being a retired professional basketball player, Rodman is a retired part-time [[professional wrestler]] and actor. He was a member of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] and fought alongside [[Hulk Hogan]] at two [[Bash at the Beach]] events. In professional wrestling, Rodman was the first ever winner of the [[Hulk Hogan's Celebrity Championship Wrestling|Celebrity Championship Wrestling]] tournament. He had his own TV show, ''[[The Rodman World Tour]]'', and had lead roles in the action films ''[[Double Team (film)|Double Team]]'' (1997) and ''[[Simon Sez]]'' (1999). Both films were critically panned, with the former earning Rodman a triple [[Razzie Award]]. He appeared in several reality TV series and was the winner of the $222,000 main prize of the 2004 edition of ''[[The Mole (U.S. Season 4)|Celebrity Mole]]''.\n\n==Early life and education==\nRodman was born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], the son of Shirley and Philander Rodman, Jr., an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] enlisted member, who later fought in the [[Vietnam War]].

It was thought that Rockets center [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] would have a hard time asserting himself versus Robinson and Rodman, who had both been voted into the NBA All-Defensive Teams. However, neither Robinson nor Rodman, who had disrupted a playoff game against the Lakers by sitting down on the court,<ref name=\"nbacom\" /> could stop Olajuwon, who averaged 35.3 points against the elite defensive Spurs frontcourt, and helped eliminate the Spurs in six games.\n\nRodman admitted his frequent transgressions, but asserted that he lived his own life and thus a more honest life than most other people:\n\n<blockquote>I just took the chance to be my own man ... I just said: \"If you don't like it, kiss my ass.\" ... Most people around the country, or around the world, are basically working people who want to be free, who want to be themselves.

Page Not Found|website=NBA Stats}}</ref> is an American retired professional basketball player who played for the [[Detroit Pistons]], [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[Chicago Bulls]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]], and [[Dallas Mavericks]] in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). He was nicknamed \"'''the Worm'''\" and is famous for his fierce [[Defense (sports)|defensive]] and [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] abilities.\n\nRodman played at the [[small forward]] position in his early years before becoming a [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]]. He earned [[NBA All-Defensive First Team]] honors seven times and won the [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]] twice. He also led the NBA in rebounds per game for a record seven consecutive years and won five NBA championships. His biography at [[NBA.com]] states that he is \"arguably the best rebounding forward in NBA history\". On April 1, 2011, the Pistons retired Rodman's No. 10 jersey,<ref name=\"autogenerated34\">{{cite web |last1=Lidz |first1=Franz |title=Dennis Rodman - As the Worm Turns |url=https://www.si.com/vault/2015/07/09/106342554/dennis-rodman |website=Vault |accessdate=January 7, 2020 |date=July 8, 2013}}</ref> and he was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] later that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/basketball-hall-of-fame-enshrines-chris-mullin-dennis-rodman-arvydas-sabonis-tex-winter-081211|title=Rodman, Mullin enshrined in Hall of Fame|accessdate=August 12, 2011|publisher=Fox Sports|date=August 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\nRodman experienced an unhappy childhood and was shy and [[introverted]] in his early years. After aborting a suicide attempt in 1993, he reinvented himself as a \"bad boy\" and became notorious for numerous controversial antics. He repeatedly dyed his hair in artificial colors, had many [[Body piercing|piercing]]s and [[tattoo]]s, and regularly disrupted games by clashing with opposing players and officials. He famously wore a [[wedding dress]] to promote his 1996 autobiography ''[[Bad As I Wanna Be]]''. Rodman pursued a high-profile affair with singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and was briefly married to actress [[Carmen Electra]]. Rodman also attracted international attention for his visits to [[North Korea]] and his subsequent befriending of North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-un]] in 2013.\n\nIn addition to being a retired professional basketball player, Rodman is a retired part-time [[professional wrestler]] and actor. He was a member of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] and fought alongside [[Hulk Hogan]] at two [[Bash at the Beach]] events. In professional wrestling, Rodman was the first ever winner of the [[Hulk Hogan's Celebrity Championship Wrestling|Celebrity Championship Wrestling]] tournament. He had his own TV show, ''[[The Rodman World Tour]]'', and had lead roles in the action films ''[[Double Team (film)|Double Team]]'' (1997) and ''[[Simon Sez]]'' (1999). Both films were critically panned, with the former earning Rodman a triple [[Razzie Award]]. He appeared in several reality TV series and was the winner of the $222,000 main prize of the 2004 edition of ''[[The Mole (U.S. Season 4)|Celebrity Mole]]''.\n\n==Early life and education==\nRodman was born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], the son of Shirley and Philander Rodman, Jr., an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] enlisted member, who later fought in the [[Vietnam War]].

He was suspended for the first three games, took a leave of absence on November 11, and was suspended again on December 7. He finally returned on December 10 after missing 19 games.<ref name=\"nbacom\" /> After joining the team, he suffered a shoulder separation in a motorcycle accident, limiting his season to 49 games. Normally, he would not have qualified for any season records for missing so many games, but by grabbing 823 rebounds, he just surpassed the 800-rebound limit for listing players and won his fourth straight rebounding title by averaging 16.8 boards per game and made the All-NBA Team.<ref name=\"nbacom\" /> In the [[1995 NBA playoffs|1995 playoffs]], the 62-win Spurs with reigning [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]] winner Robinson entered the Western Conference Finals and were considered favorites against the reigning champions [[Houston Rockets]] who had only won 47 games. It was thought that Rockets center [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] would have a hard time asserting himself versus Robinson and Rodman, who had both been voted into the NBA All-Defensive Teams. However, neither Robinson nor Rodman, who had disrupted a playoff game against the Lakers by sitting down on the court,<ref name=\"nbacom\" /> could stop Olajuwon, who averaged 35.3 points against the elite defensive Spurs frontcourt, and helped eliminate the Spurs in six games.\n\nRodman admitted his frequent transgressions, but asserted that he lived his own life and thus a more honest life than most other people:\n\n<blockquote>I just took the chance to be my own man ... I just said: \"If you don't like it, kiss my ass.\" ... Most people around the country, or around the world, are basically working people who want to be free, who want to be themselves.

Ever controversial, Rodman made negative headlines after a [[Headbutt|head butt]] of referee Ted Bernhardt during a game in [[New Jersey]] on March 16, 1996; he was suspended for six games and fined $20,000, a punishment that was criticized as too lenient by the local press.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goinside.com/97/6/rodman.html |title=Dennis Rodman and the $50,000 Mormon Fine |accessdate=August 9, 2006 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980111112402/http://goinside.com/97/6/rodman.html |archivedate=January 11, 1998}}.

In addition, CAS members often compete with members of the [[Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales]] (GPS) and members of the [[Independent Schools Association (Australia)|Independent Schools Association]] (ISA).\n\n== History ==\nThe CAS was initiated in 1928 by [[Knox Grammar School]]\u2019s first headmaster, Neil MacNeil, when he proposed an association with [[Barker College]], [[Cranbrook School Sydney|Cranbrook School]], [[Trinity Grammar School, New South Wales|Trinity Grammar School]], [[All Saints College (Bathurst, New South Wales)|All Saints' College]] and [[St Aloysius' College (Sydney)|St Aloysius' College]].\n\nThe association was formed in 1929 to provide sporting and co-curricular competition with the foundation members being the above schools with the exception of All Saints', who were not mentioned again. [[Waverley College]] had its application of June 1929 deferred until it finally joined in the 1940s. This was because the headmaster of [[Trinity Grammar School, New South Wales|Trinity Grammar School]] throughout the 1930s came to an impasse with Waverley headmaster at the time, Br Edward Nelson, over school fee issues. This issue questioned the integrity of the school and the application was held up until 1941. At this point in time Waverley had a new headmaster, Br Andrew Denman.\n\nThe CAS primarily provides sporting competitions between the various schools, including [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[sport of athletics|athletics]], the summer sports [[cricket]] and [[basketball]], and the winter sports [[rugby union]], [[association football|football (soccer)]], and [[cross country running|cross country]]. CAS also offers a wide range of cultural activities such as cadet competitions, chess, debating and public speaking. Since 1935, a representative from each CAS and GPS school has competed in the [[Lawrence Campbell Oratory Competition]].\n\nRepresentatives from all six schools meet regularly to determine sporting schedules, school terms, competitions and address any issues arising from the CAS competition.\n\n[[Sydney Grammar School]] often participates in debating competitions and some sport (mainly volleyball) hosted by the CAS board.\n\nTony Higgins, dean of careers at Knox Grammar School, manages the employment relations aspect of the association. John Day and Roger Seaborn, members of the Trinity Grammar School Council, also form part of this committee and are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the CAS. August Courtis is in charge of the Public Relations Department.\n\nThe meeting of the representatives of the CAS in April 2006 saw the introduction of a cadet drill competition, suggested by Helen Clarke of Knox Grammar School and Gordon Barkl of the Barker College School Council. This was intended to further enhance the links between the six CAS schools. In June 2006, the CAS committee initiated the first joint-scholarship programme for academic performance. Awarded annually, the student attaining the scholarship is granted six years of secondary education at any of the six CAS schools.\n\nThe annual meeting of the CAS committee in April 2007 saw the introduction of lawn bowls as an official CAS sport through the initiative of Pete Mullers and Chantal Hunter of the Waverley College sport department. The event also saw the proposal of the introduction of a common teaching/learning program in the academic side of each of the six participating schools. The program has been drafted by Shane Sedgman and Jenny Emery of Knox Grammar School. The head of the CAS committee, Dougal Parr, also announced his decision to step down from his position and was replaced by his deputy, Edward Bradshaw.\n\nOn 4 May 2007, English faculty executives from the six CAS schools attended a conference held at Knox Grammar School to commence the drafting of a common learning program. Headed by the dean of English of Knox Grammar School and Barker College, Steve Parsons and Ann Lawless Bean, assessment tasks, examinations and teaching schedules were devised for the academic year commencing 2008. The mathematics department attended a similar seminar on 7 May 2007 and was headed by Michael Harnwell and Ian Schultz.\n\n== Schools ==\n=== Member schools ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Crest\n!School\n!Location\n!Enrolment\n!Founded\n!Denomination\n!Boys/Girls\n!Day/Boarding\n!Year Entered<br>Competition\n!School Colors\n|-\n|-\n|[[Image:Staloysiussydney.jpg|50px]]\n|[[St Aloysius' College (Sydney)|St Aloysius' College]]\n|[[Milsons Point, New South Wales|Milsons Point]]\n|1200\n|1879\n|[[Catholic]]\n|Boys\n|Day\n|1929\n| Royal blue and gold\n|-\n|[[Image:Barkercollege.jpg|50px]]\n|[[Barker College]]\n|[[Hornsby, New South Wales|Hornsby]]\n|2300\n|1890 \n|[[Anglican]]\n|Boys only to Yr 9<br>Co-ed Year 10 to 12\n|Day & boarding\n|1929\n|Red & blue\n|-\n|[[Image:Cranbrookschool.jpg|50px]]\n|[[Cranbrook School Sydney|Cranbrook School]]\n|[[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales|Bellevue Hill]]\n|1369\n|1918\n|[[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican]]\n|Boys\n|Day & boarding\n|1929\n|Red, white & blue\n|-\n|[[Image:Knoxgrammar.jpg|50px]]\n|[[Knox Grammar School]] \n|[[Wahroonga, New South Wales|Wahroonga]]\n|2500\n|1924\n|[[Uniting Church in Australia|Uniting Church]]\n|Boys\n|Day & boarding\n|1929\n|Black & blue\n|-\n|[[Image:Trinitygrammarcrest.jpg|50px]]\n|[[Trinity Grammar School, New South Wales|Trinity Grammar School]] \n|[[Summer Hill, New South Wales|Summer Hill]]\n|2000\n|1913\n|[[Anglican]]\n|Boys\n|Day\n|1929\n|Green and white\n|-\n|[[Image:Waverleycollege.jpg|50px]]\n|[[Waverley College]]\n|[[Waverley, New South Wales|Waverley]]\n|1430\n|1903\n|[[Catholic]]\n|Boys\n|Day\n|1944\n|Royal blue and gold\n|}\n\n== Competitive events ==\n* [[sport of athletics|Athletics]]\n* [[Basketball]]\n* [[Chess]]\n* [[Cricket]]\n* [[Cross country running|Cross country]]\n* [[Rifle shooting]]\n* [[Rugby union]]\n* [[Association football|Soccer]] \n* [[swimming (sport)|Swimming]]\n* [[Volleyball]]\n* [[Water polo]]\n* [[Squash (sport)|Squash]]\n* [[Tennis]]\n* [[Debating]]\n* [[Lawn bowls]]\n* [[Diving (sport)|Diving]]\n\n== Champions ==\n<!-- Please do not add the crest of Cranbrook School as it is not in the Public Domain (it is a fair use images) -->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFCC33\"\n!

In addition, CAS members often compete with members of the [[Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales]] (GPS) and members of the [[Independent Schools Association (Australia)|Independent Schools Association]] (ISA).\n\n== History ==\nThe CAS was initiated in 1928 by [[Knox Grammar School]]\u2019s first headmaster, Neil MacNeil, when he proposed an association with [[Barker College]], [[Cranbrook School Sydney|Cranbrook School]], [[Trinity Grammar School, New South Wales|Trinity Grammar School]], [[All Saints College (Bathurst, New South Wales)|All Saints' College]] and [[St Aloysius' College (Sydney)|St Aloysius' College]].\n\nThe association was formed in 1929 to provide sporting and co-curricular competition with the foundation members being the above schools with the exception of All Saints', who were not mentioned again. [[Waverley College]] had its application of June 1929 deferred until it finally joined in the 1940s. This was because the headmaster of [[Trinity Grammar School, New South Wales|Trinity Grammar School]] throughout the 1930s came to an impasse with Waverley headmaster at the time, Br Edward Nelson, over school fee issues. This issue questioned the integrity of the school and the application was held up until 1941. At this point in time Waverley had a new headmaster, Br Andrew Denman.\n\nThe CAS primarily provides sporting competitions between the various schools, including [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[sport of athletics|athletics]], the summer sports [[cricket]] and [[basketball]], and the winter sports [[rugby union]], [[association football|football (soccer)]], and [[cross country running|cross country]]. CAS also offers a wide range of cultural activities such as cadet competitions, chess, debating and public speaking. Since 1935, a representative from each CAS and GPS school has competed in the [[Lawrence Campbell Oratory Competition]].\n\nRepresentatives from all six schools meet regularly to determine sporting schedules, school terms, competitions and address any issues arising from the CAS competition.\n\n[[Sydney Grammar School]] often participates in debating competitions and some sport (mainly volleyball) hosted by the CAS board.\n\nTony Higgins, dean of careers at Knox Grammar School, manages the employment relations aspect of the association. John Day and Roger Seaborn, members of the Trinity Grammar School Council, also form part of this committee and are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the CAS. August Courtis is in charge of the Public Relations Department.\n\nThe meeting of the representatives of the CAS in April 2006 saw the introduction of a cadet drill competition, suggested by Helen Clarke of Knox Grammar School and Gordon Barkl of the Barker College School Council. This was intended to further enhance the links between the six CAS schools. In June 2006, the CAS committee initiated the first joint-scholarship programme for academic performance. Awarded annually, the student attaining the scholarship is granted six years of secondary education at any of the six CAS schools.\n\nThe annual meeting of the CAS committee in April 2007 saw the introduction of lawn bowls as an official CAS sport through the initiative of Pete Mullers and Chantal Hunter of the Waverley College sport department. The event also saw the proposal of the introduction of a common teaching/learning program in the academic side of each of the six participating schools. The program has been drafted by Shane Sedgman and Jenny Emery of Knox Grammar School. The head of the CAS committee, Dougal Parr, also announced his decision to step down from his position and was replaced by his deputy, Edward Bradshaw.\n\nOn 4 May 2007, English faculty executives from the six CAS schools attended a conference held at Knox Grammar School to commence the drafting of a common learning program. Headed by the dean of English of Knox Grammar School and Barker College, Steve Parsons and Ann Lawless Bean, assessment tasks, examinations and teaching schedules were devised for the academic year commencing 2008. The mathematics department attended a similar seminar on 7 May 2007 and was headed by Michael Harnwell and Ian Schultz.\n\n== Schools ==\n=== Member schools ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Crest\n!School\n!Location\n!Enrolment\n!Founded\n!Denomination\n!Boys/Girls\n!Day/Boarding\n!Year Entered<br>Competition\n!School Colors\n|-\n|-\n|[[Image:Staloysiussydney.jpg|50px]]\n|[[St Aloysius' College (Sydney)|St Aloysius' College]]\n|[[Milsons Point, New South Wales|Milsons Point]]\n|1200\n|1879\n|[[Catholic]]\n|Boys\n|Day\n|1929\n| Royal blue and gold\n|-\n|[[Image:Barkercollege.jpg|50px]]\n|[[Barker College]]\n|[[Hornsby, New South Wales|Hornsby]]\n|2300\n|1890 \n|[[Anglican]]\n|Boys only to Yr 9<br>Co-ed Year 10 to 12\n|Day & boarding\n|1929\n|Red & blue\n|-\n|[[Image:Cranbrookschool.jpg|50px]]\n|[[Cranbrook School Sydney|Cranbrook School]]\n|[[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales|Bellevue Hill]]\n|1369\n|1918\n|[[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican]]\n|Boys\n|Day & boarding\n|1929\n|Red, white & blue\n|-\n|[[Image:Knoxgrammar.jpg|50px]]\n|[[Knox Grammar School]] \n|[[Wahroonga, New South Wales|Wahroonga]]\n|2500\n|1924\n|[[Uniting Church in Australia|Uniting Church]]\n|Boys\n|Day & boarding\n|1929\n|Black & blue\n|-\n|[[Image:Trinitygrammarcrest.jpg|50px]]\n|[[Trinity Grammar School, New South Wales|Trinity Grammar School]] \n|[[Summer Hill, New South Wales|Summer Hill]]\n|2000\n|1913\n|[[Anglican]]\n|Boys\n|Day\n|1929\n|Green and white\n|-\n|[[Image:Waverleycollege.jpg|50px]]\n|[[Waverley College]]\n|[[Waverley, New South Wales|Waverley]]\n|1430\n|1903\n|[[Catholic]]\n|Boys\n|Day\n|1944\n|Royal blue and gold\n|}\n\n== Competitive events ==\n* [[sport of athletics|Athletics]]\n* [[Basketball]]\n* [[Chess]]\n* [[Cricket]]\n* [[Cross country running|Cross country]]\n* [[Rifle shooting]]\n* [[Rugby union]]\n* [[Association football|Soccer]] \n* [[swimming (sport)|Swimming]]\n* [[Volleyball]]\n* [[Water polo]]\n* [[Squash (sport)|Squash]]\n* [[Tennis]]\n* [[Debating]]\n* [[Lawn bowls]]\n* [[Diving (sport)|Diving]]\n\n== Champions ==\n<!-- Please do not add the crest of Cranbrook School as it is not in the Public Domain (it is a fair use images) -->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFCC33\"\n!
