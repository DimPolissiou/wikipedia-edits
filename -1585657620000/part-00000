Prior to his broadcasting duties, he was a [[NASCAR]] driver who won in four different series\u2014the K&N Pro Series, and the three national series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nascar/news?slug=rc-tonystewart041807&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title= \nWhere there's Smoke |accessdate=2007-04-22 |author=Ricky Craven |date=April 18, 2007 |publisher=Yahoo}}</ref>\n\nHe occasionally served as a pit reporter when NASCAR aired on TBS in the mid-1990s. Craven is perhaps most well known for winning the [[2003 Carolina Dodge Dealers 400]], beating [[Kurt Busch]] in the closest finish in [[List of the closest NASCAR Sprint Cup Series finishes|Cup Series]] history.\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===Beginnings===\nCraven began racing at the age of 15 at Unity Raceway, winning twice as well as the Rookie of the Year award. The next year, he won 12 feature events and the track championship. In 1984 Craven raced at Wiscasset Speedway in the Late Model Division; in this year he won the track championship along with the Rookie of the Year title.<ref>[http://www.nascardriveroftheday.com/2012/02/ricky-craven.html NASCAR Driver of the Day: Ricky Craven]</ref> After that, he began running in the [[American Canadian Tour]], where he had rampant success. In 1986, he made his NASCAR debut at [[Oxford Plains Speedway]] in his own No. 12, finishing 25th after suffering engine failure. Four years later, he began running the Busch North Series, winning the Rookie of the Year award. In 1991, he was named the champion in that series, winning ten times in the No. 25 Chevrolet, with two of those ten wins in \"combination\" races with the [[Busch Grand National Series]], including the prestigious Oxford 250. In addition, he made his Winston Cup debut at Rockingham, starting and finishing 34th for Dick Moroso. He moved to the Busch Series full-time in 1992  in the No. 99 Chevy for Bill Papke, and once again was named [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]]. In 1993 and 1994, he finished runner-up to [[Steve Grissom]] and [[David Green (racing driver)|David Green]], respectively, in the championship standings.  On October 9, 1994, Craven would serve as a pit reporter for TBS's broadcast of that year's Mello Yello 500, serving as a precursor to his broadcasting career.\n\n===1995\u20131998===\n[[Image:RickyCraven1997Pocono.jpg|thumb|left|Craven's 1997 race car]]\nIn 1995, Craven teamed up with [[Larry Hedrick Motorsports]] and [[Kodiak tobacco|Kodiak]] to run for Winston Cup Rookie of the Year. Craven qualified for all 31 races, finished in the Top 10 four times, and was able to defeat [[Robert Pressley]] for the top rookie award. For his efforts, he was rewarded with a partial ownership share in the team. He began 1996 with three consecutive Top 10 finishes and his first career pole. He was fourth in points before the [[Aaron's 499|Winston Select 500]], during which he was involved in a multi-car wreck. On lap 130, his car was launched into the air and impacted with the [[catch fence]] above the wall before being thrown back onto the track and hit by another car. This crash was similar{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} to [[Jimmy Horton]]'s barrel roll in 1993 where he cleared the track. Craven's flip completely sheared the catchfence off the turn and NASCAR threw a lengthy red flag to make repairs. He walked away, but fell to twentieth in points and only had one Top 5 finish and one pole for the rest of the season\n\nAt the end of the year, Craven left Hedrick to drive the No. 25 Chevy for [[Hendrick Motorsports]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1997/nascar/nsprev.html|title=NASCAR's burgeoning popularity will be fueled by new tracks and new stars in '97 |work=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=2013-05-16}}</ref> Craven finished in the Top 5 in the first two races of the season. He finished third in the [[1997 Daytona 500]] behind his teammates [[Terry Labonte]] in second and [[Jeff Gordon]] in first giving Hendrick Motorsports a 1-2-3  sweep of the Daytona 500. While practicing for the inaugural [[Interstate Batteries 500]], Craven crashed hard into the wall. He missed two races due to a concussion suffered from the wreck. Upon his return, he won the [[Winston Open]] and finished a then-career-best 19th in points and a total of $1,139,860 in winnings for 1997. After the 1998 season started, the side effects of the concussion began to appear, and Craven was diagnosed with [[post-concussion syndrome]], and was forced to miss several races until he recovered. He returned at his home track at [[New Hampshire International Speedway]] later that year won the pole. After four races, he was released permanently from Hendrick, and did not return until the final three races of the season, filling in for [[Ernie Irvan]] at [[MB2 Motorsports]].\n\n===1999\u20132006===\nFor 1999, Craven signed to drive the No. 58 [[Ford Taurus]] for [[Scott Barbour]]'s [[SBIII Motorsports]], a brand new team in NASCAR. He did not finish any better than 19th while driving the car and after he failed to qualify for the [[Coca-Cola 600]], he was replaced by [[Loy Allen, Jr.]]. Several weeks later, he signed up with another new team [[Midwest Transit Racing]], replacing rookie [[Dan Pardus]] in the No. 50 and finished the season with them. Craven returned to the team in 2000 but after failing to qualify for four of the first nine races of the season, the team switched to a part-time schedule. Following this decision, Craven had four Top 20 finishes but finished 44th in points.\n\nIn January the next year, it was announced that Craven would replace [[Scott Pruett]] in [[PPI Motorsports]]'s No. 32 Ford. He won the pole in the summer race at [[Michigan International Speedway]] and in the [[Old Dominion 500]] at [[Martinsville Speedway]], he held off [[Dale Jarrett]] in the closing laps for his first career Winston Cup win. In 2002, he won two poles, scored nine Top 10 finishes, and finished a career-best 15th in points. In 2003, his team switched from [[Ford]] to [[Pontiac]], providing the No. 32 car with a factory-backed engine program. In the [[2003 Carolina Dodge Dealers 400|Carolina Dodge Dealers 400]] at [[Darlington Raceway]], he battled [[Kurt Busch]] for the win, defeating him by .002 seconds in what was voted in December 2009 as the \"Finish of the 2000s\" in the Sprint Cup Series.<ref>[http://www.nascar.com/2009/news/headlines/official/12/24/media.races.of.decade/index.html Craven win at Darlington in 2003 top (Sprint) Cup race of the decade]</ref> In that race, he became the last-ever person to win in a Pontiac. Craven failed to win races again that season and dropped 12 spots in the points standings. After he did not post a single Top 10 finish three-quarters of the way through 2004, he was replaced by [[Bobby Hamilton, Jr.]], and only returned to run at [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]], his home track. His last Cup start was the 2004 [[Good Sam Roadside Assistance 500|EA Sports 500]] at Talladega, where he drove in a development car for [[Joe Gibbs Racing]], the No. 11 Chevrolet.\n\nIn 2005, Craven moved to the [[Craftsman Truck Series]] to drive the No. 99 Ford for [[Roush Racing]]. Craven was second in points after 9 races, and there was talk about him being promoted to [[Mark Martin]]'s No. 6 Nextel Cup ride for 2006. However, a brutal stretch of finishes led to a free fall in the point standings, and it was announced that he would be gone from Roush at the end of the year. Craven did win at Martinsville Speedway late in the year, and finished fourteenth in points.\n\nHis final NASCAR start came at the Goody's 250 at Martinsville in the Busch Series for [[FitzBradshaw Racing]] in 2006. He finished 39th after the brakes failed on his No. 14 Dodge.\n\n===Post-retirement===\nCraven spent the next few years looking for a part-time ride, but he was unsuccessful.  He eventually retired and worked for [[ESPN]] and [[Yahoo! Sports]] as a NASCAR analyst. In January 2019, he departed ESPN after 11 years with the network to work for [[Fox NASCAR|Fox]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Crandall|first=Kelly|url=https://racer.com/2019/01/29/craven-joining-fox-sports/|title=Craven joins Fox Sports|magazine=[[Racer (magazine)|Racer]]|date=January 29, 2019|accessdate=January 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

Prior to his broadcasting duties, he was a [[NASCAR]] driver who won in four different series\u2014the K&N Pro Series, and the three national series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nascar/news?slug=rc-tonystewart041807&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title= \nWhere there's Smoke |accessdate=2007-04-22 |author=Ricky Craven |date=April 18, 2007 |publisher=Yahoo}}</ref>\n\nHe occasionally served as a pit reporter when NASCAR aired on TBS in the mid-1990s. Craven is perhaps most well known for winning the [[2003 Carolina Dodge Dealers 400]], beating [[Kurt Busch]] in the closest finish in [[List of the closest NASCAR Sprint Cup Series finishes|Cup Series]] history.\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===Beginnings===\nCraven began racing at the age of 15 at Unity Raceway, winning twice as well as the Rookie of the Year award. The next year, he won 12 feature events and the track championship. In 1984 Craven raced at Wiscasset Speedway in the Late Model Division; in this year he won the track championship along with the Rookie of the Year title.<ref>[http://www.nascardriveroftheday.com/2012/02/ricky-craven.html NASCAR Driver of the Day: Ricky Craven]</ref> After that, he began running in the [[American Canadian Tour]], where he had rampant success. In 1986, he made his NASCAR debut at [[Oxford Plains Speedway]] in his own No. 12, finishing 25th after suffering engine failure. Four years later, he began running the Busch North Series, winning the Rookie of the Year award. In 1991, he was named the champion in that series, winning ten times in the No. 25 Chevrolet, with two of those ten wins in \"combination\" races with the [[Busch Grand National Series]], including the prestigious Oxford 250. In addition, he made his Winston Cup debut at Rockingham, starting and finishing 34th for Dick Moroso. He moved to the Busch Series full-time in 1992  in the No. 99 Chevy for Bill Papke, and once again was named [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]]. In 1993 and 1994, he finished runner-up to [[Steve Grissom]] and [[David Green (racing driver)|David Green]], respectively, in the championship standings.  On October 9, 1994, Craven would serve as a pit reporter for TBS's broadcast of that year's Mello Yello 500, serving as a pre-cursor to his broadcasting career.\n\n===1995\u20131998===\n[[Image:RickyCraven1997Pocono.jpg|thumb|left|Craven's 1997 race car]]\nIn 1995, Craven teamed up with [[Larry Hedrick Motorsports]] and [[Kodiak tobacco|Kodiak]] to run for Winston Cup Rookie of the Year. Craven qualified for all 31 races, finished in the Top 10 four times, and was able to defeat [[Robert Pressley]] for the top rookie award. For his efforts, he was rewarded with a partial ownership share in the team. He began 1996 with three consecutive Top 10 finishes and his first career pole. He was fourth in points before the [[Aaron's 499|Winston Select 500]], during which he was involved in a multi-car wreck. On lap 130, his car was launched into the air and impacted with the [[catch fence]] above the wall before being thrown back onto the track and hit by another car. This crash was similar{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} to [[Jimmy Horton]]'s barrel roll in 1993 where he cleared the track. Craven's flip completely sheared the catchfence off the turn and NASCAR threw a lengthy red flag to make repairs. He walked away, but fell to twentieth in points and only had one Top 5 finish and one pole for the rest of the season\n\nAt the end of the year, Craven left Hedrick to drive the No. 25 Chevy for [[Hendrick Motorsports]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1997/nascar/nsprev.html|title=NASCAR's burgeoning popularity will be fueled by new tracks and new stars in '97 |work=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=2013-05-16}}</ref> Craven finished in the Top 5 in the first two races of the season. He finished third in the [[1997 Daytona 500]] behind his teammates [[Terry Labonte]] in second and [[Jeff Gordon]] in first giving Hendrick Motorsports a 1-2-3  sweep of the Daytona 500. While practicing for the inaugural [[Interstate Batteries 500]], Craven crashed hard into the wall. He missed two races due to a concussion suffered from the wreck. Upon his return, he won the [[Winston Open]] and finished a then-career-best 19th in points and a total of $1,139,860 in winnings for 1997. After the 1998 season started, the side effects of the concussion began to appear, and Craven was diagnosed with [[post-concussion syndrome]], and was forced to miss several races until he recovered. He returned at his home track at [[New Hampshire International Speedway]] later that year won the pole. After four races, he was released permanently from Hendrick, and did not return until the final three races of the season, filling in for [[Ernie Irvan]] at [[MB2 Motorsports]].\n\n===1999\u20132006===\nFor 1999, Craven signed to drive the No. 58 [[Ford Taurus]] for [[Scott Barbour]]'s [[SBIII Motorsports]], a brand new team in NASCAR. He did not finish any better than 19th while driving the car and after he failed to qualify for the [[Coca-Cola 600]], he was replaced by [[Loy Allen, Jr.]]. Several weeks later, he signed up with another new team [[Midwest Transit Racing]], replacing rookie [[Dan Pardus]] in the No. 50 and finished the season with them. Craven returned to the team in 2000 but after failing to qualify for four of the first nine races of the season, the team switched to a part-time schedule. Following this decision, Craven had four Top 20 finishes but finished 44th in points.\n\nIn January the next year, it was announced that Craven would replace [[Scott Pruett]] in [[PPI Motorsports]]'s No. 32 Ford. He won the pole in the summer race at [[Michigan International Speedway]] and in the [[Old Dominion 500]] at [[Martinsville Speedway]], he held off [[Dale Jarrett]] in the closing laps for his first career Winston Cup win. In 2002, he won two poles, scored nine Top 10 finishes, and finished a career-best 15th in points. In 2003, his team switched from [[Ford]] to [[Pontiac]], providing the No. 32 car with a factory-backed engine program. In the [[2003 Carolina Dodge Dealers 400|Carolina Dodge Dealers 400]] at [[Darlington Raceway]], he battled [[Kurt Busch]] for the win, defeating him by .002 seconds in what was voted in December 2009 as the \"Finish of the 2000s\" in the Sprint Cup Series.<ref>[http://www.nascar.com/2009/news/headlines/official/12/24/media.races.of.decade/index.html Craven win at Darlington in 2003 top (Sprint) Cup race of the decade]</ref> In that race, he became the last-ever person to win in a Pontiac. Craven failed to win races again that season and dropped 12 spots in the points standings. After he did not post a single Top 10 finish three-quarters of the way through 2004, he was replaced by [[Bobby Hamilton, Jr.]], and only returned to run at [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]], his home track. His last Cup start was the 2004 [[Good Sam Roadside Assistance 500|EA Sports 500]] at Talladega, where he drove in a development car for [[Joe Gibbs Racing]], the No. 11 Chevrolet.\n\nIn 2005, Craven moved to the [[Craftsman Truck Series]] to drive the No. 99 Ford for [[Roush Racing]]. Craven was second in points after 9 races, and there was talk about him being promoted to [[Mark Martin]]'s No. 6 Nextel Cup ride for 2006. However, a brutal stretch of finishes led to a free fall in the point standings, and it was announced that he would be gone from Roush at the end of the year. Craven did win at Martinsville Speedway late in the year, and finished fourteenth in points. \n\nHis final NASCAR start came at the Goody's 250 at Martinsville in the Busch Series for [[FitzBradshaw Racing]] in 2006. He finished 39th after the brakes failed on his No. 14 Dodge.\n\n===Post-retirement===\nCraven spent the next few years looking for a part-time ride, but he was unsuccessful.  He eventually retired and worked for [[ESPN]] and [[Yahoo! Sports]] as a NASCAR analyst. In January 2019, he departed ESPN after 11 years with the network to work for [[Fox NASCAR|Fox]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Crandall|first=Kelly|url=https://racer.com/2019/01/29/craven-joining-fox-sports/|title=Craven joins Fox Sports|magazine=[[Racer (magazine)|Racer]]|date=January 29, 2019|accessdate=January 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

News|access-date=2020-03-27|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n== Design ==\nThe P40 series is constructed with anodized aluminum for the frame, while the back uses Gorilla Glass on the P40 and P40 Pro or ceramic on the P40 Pro+. The display is flat on the P40 or curved on all sides on the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+; Huawei calls this a Quad-Curve Overflow Display. The top left corner of the display has a pill-shaped cutout for the front-facing camera and ambient/proximity sensors; it also accommodates the infrared face unlock system on the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+. As on the P30 Pro, the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ replace the traditional earpiece speaker with an \"electromagnetic levitation\" speaker that vibrates the top of the phone's screen, and have an IR blaster on the top edge. The 3.5mm audio jack has also been omitted on all models. A rectangular module houses the rear cameras, which protrudes slightly from the back panel. The P40 and P40 Pro will be available in Silver Frost, Blush Gold, Deep Sea Blue, Ice White and Black, while the P40 Pro+ will be available in Ceramic White or Ceramic Black.\n\n== Specifications ==\n=== Hardware ===\nThe P40 series is powered by the [[HiSilicon]] Kirin 990 5G processor, meaning that all models will have [[5G]] connectivity standard. Although 5G networks are supported, all models only supports \"sub-6\" 5G, meaning they are not compatible with ultra-fast [[Extremely high frequency|millimeter-wave (mmWave)]] networks. The Kirin 990 5G is assisted by the [[Mali (GPU)|Mali]]-G76 MP16 GPU. The P40's display is carried over from the P30, a 6.1\" (154.94mm) 19.5:9 [[1080p]]  (1080 \u00d7 2340) [[OLED]] with a 60[[Hertz|Hz]] [[refresh rate]]. The P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ use a larger 6.58\" (167.13mm) 19.8:9 OLED with an unorthodox resolution (1200 \u00d7 2640) and a 90Hz refresh rate, as well as support for HDR10 and DCI-P3. The P40 has 6 or 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM, while the P40 Pro & P40 Pro+ have 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM. All models have [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0: the P40 has 128 or 256 GB, the P40 Pro has 128, 256 or 512 GB and the P40 Pro+ has 256 or 512 GB. Expansion is supported up to 256 GB via Huawei's proprietary Nano Memory card. In addition to the infrared face unlock system, all P40 models have an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor; Huawei claims the sensor is 30% larger and faster than the P30's. The P40 uses a 3800mAh battery, while the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ use a larger 4200mAh battery. Fast charging is supported on all models, however the P40 does not support wireless charging. The P40 can charge wired up to 22.5W while the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ have a max rate of 40W. Both the P40 and P40 Pro are also capable of reverse wireless charging at 27W, but the P40 Pro+ can charge faster wirelessly at 40W whereas the P40 Pro can only charge wirelessly at 27W. Additionally, the P40 has an [[IP Code|IP]]53 rating while the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ have an IP68 rating. \n==== Camera ====\nThe P40 series features [[Leica Camera|Leica]] optics, and the wide lens on all models is a new \"Ultra Vision\" 50 MP sensor. Like the P30, the wide lens uses a \"SuperSpectrum\" [[image sensor]], whose [[color filter array]] uses yellow sub-pixels instead of green. Huawei stated that this would allow more light to be captured, and enhanced absorption of red and green colors. The P40's rear camera array consists of a 50 MP wide lens, a 16 MP ultrawide lens and an 8 MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. The P40 Pro increases the resolution of the ultrawide sensor to 40 MP, replaces the standard telephoto lens with a 12 MP periscope sensor capable of 5x optical zoom, and adds a [[Time-of-flight camera|time-of-flight]] sensor. The P40 Pro+ has two 8 MP telephoto lenses, a standard sensor with 3x optical zoom and a periscope sensor with 10x optical zoom while retaining the time-of-flight sensor. The front-facing camera uses a 32 MP sensor which has autofocus on the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+; an additional depth sensor allows for the face unlock. For both photo and video, pixel binning is used for improved low-light sensitivity, and video can be captured from the wide-angle and telephoto sensors simultaneously with directional audio computed from three omnidirectional microphones. The cameras benefit from an XD Fusion Image Engine which enables advanced computational photography, as well as an \"Octa\" phase-detection autofocus system for faster autofocus and improved white balance sensors on the P40 Pro+. The software is also improved with a new Golden Snap feature that takes a burst of HDR+ photos and automatically picks the best shots. A [[Profoto]] studio light will be available as an accessory as well.\n\n=== Software ===\nThe P40 series ships with [[EMUI|EMUI 10.1]] powered by Huawei Mobile Services (HMS), which is based on [[Android 10]] source code. Due to [[Huawei#U.S. business restrictions|ongoing United States sanctions against Huawei]], international models of the P40 will not ship with or support [[Google Mobile Services]] \u2014 the proprietary software suite (including [[Google Play]]-branded software) shipped on certified Android devices, and Huawei is not allowed to market the device using the Android [[trademark]].<ref name=\":0\" /> As the P40 series are the first Huawei devices to run EMUI 10.1, they also mark the introduction of Huawei's own voice assistant Celia due to the lack of Google Assistant. Celia includes a \"Hey Celia\" feature which triggers an audio search.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5google.com/2020/03/26/huawei-celia-google-assistant-iphone-p40-pro/|title=Huawei\u2019s \u2018Celia\u2019 tries to replace Google Assistant, also wakes nearby iPhones|website=9to5Google|last=Schoon|first=Ben|date=26 March 2020|accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nHuawei is promoting the use of its own in-house platforms as a substitute, including the Huawei AppGallery [[application store|store]] (which is already used on Chinese models of Huawei's devices due to Google not doing business there). Huawei stated that it would make a US$1 billion investment in promoting software development and growth of AppGallery.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |last=Warren |first=Tom |title=Huawei confirms the

The P40's rear camera array consists of a 50 MP wide lens, a 16 MP ultrawide lens and an 8 MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. The P40 Pro increases the resolution of the ultrawide sensor to 40 MP, replaces the standard telephoto lens with a 12 MP periscope sensor capable of 5x optical zoom, and adds a [[Time-of-flight camera|time-of-flight]] sensor. The P40 Pro+ has two 8 MP telephoto lenses, a standard sensor with 3x optical zoom and a periscope sensor with 10x optical zoom while retaining the time-of-flight sensor. The front-facing camera uses a 32 MP sensor which has autofocus on the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+; an additional depth sensor allows for the face unlock. For both photo and video, pixel binning is used for improved low-light sensitivity, and video can be captured from the wide-angle and telephoto sensors simultaneously with directional audio computed from three omnidirectional microphones. The cameras benefit from an XD Fusion Image Engine which enables advanced computational photography, as well as an \"Octa\" phase-detection autofocus system for faster autofocus and improved white balance sensors on the P40 Pro+. The software is also improved with a new Golden Snap feature that takes a burst of HDR+ photos and automatically picks the best shots. A [[Profoto]] studio light will be available as an accessory as well.\n\n=== Software ===\nThe P40 series ships with [[EMUI|EMUI 10.1]] powered by Huawei Mobile Services (HMS), which is based on [[Android 10]] source code. Due to [[Huawei#U.S. business restrictions|ongoing United States sanctions against Huawei]], international models of the P40 will not ship with or support [[Google Mobile Services]] \u2014 the proprietary software suite (including [[Google Play]]-branded software) shipped on certified Android devices, and Huawei is not allowed to market the device using the Android [[trademark]].<ref name=\":0\" /> As the P40 series are the first Huawei devices to run EMUI 10.1, they also mark the introduction of Huawei's own voice assistant Celia due to the lack of Google Assistant. Celia includes a \"Hey Celia\" feature which triggers an audio search.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5google.com/2020/03/26/huawei-celia-google-assistant-iphone-p40-pro/|title=Huawei\u2019s \u2018Celia\u2019 tries to replace Google Assistant, also wakes nearby iPhones|website=9to5Google|last=Schoon|first=Ben|date=26 March 2020|accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nHuawei is promoting the use of its own in-house platforms as a substitute, including the Huawei AppGallery [[application store|store]] (which is already used on Chinese models of Huawei's devices due to Google not doing business there).

Although, these short vocabularies were obtained second hand from other company men, as Graham never travelled into the interior. Altculture at this time.

He featured heavily in the public eye as [[Secretary of State for Defence]] during the Argentine invasion of the [[Falkland Islands]] and the subsequent [[Falklands War]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Bideford]], [[Devon]], the son of Richard Nott and Phyllis (n\u00e9e Francis), Nott was educated at [[Bradfield College]] and was commissioned as a regular officer in the [[2nd Gurkha Rifles]] (1952\u20131956). He served in the Malayan emergency after a period of service with the Royal Scots. He left to study law and economics at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was President of the [[Cambridge Union Society]]. He was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in 1959.

Nott remained [[Secretary of State for Defence]] throughout the four-month conflict. He was eventually replaced by [[Michael Heseltine]] in January 1983 when Nott announced he would not seek re-election in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]].

Nott's other son, William, works for an international oil company in London. Nott's daughter, Sasha, is married to the Member of Parliament for [[East Devon (UK Parliament constituency)|East Devon]], [[Hugo Swire]].\n\n===Books===\nThe title of Nott's autobiography ''Here Today, Gone Tomorrow'' is a reference to an interview conducted by [[Robin Day|Sir Robin Day]] in October 1982.

Tice''' (born 1961) is a former intelligence analyst for the [[United States Air Force]], [[Office of Naval Intelligence]], [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA), and [[National Security Agency]] (NSA).\n\nIn December, 2005, Tice helped spark a national controversy over claims that the NSA and the DIA were engaged in unlawful and unconstitutional [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]]s on American citizens. He later admitted that he was one of the sources for the 2005 ''New York Times'' reporting on the wiretapping activities.<ref name=abc2006 /><ref name=\"washtime\" /> After speaking publicly about the need for legislation to protect whistleblowers, Tice received national attention as the first NSA-[[whistleblower]] in May 2005 before [[Thomas Andrews Drake]], [[Mark Klein]], [[Thomas Tamm]], and [[Edward Snowden]] came forward.\n\n==Career==\n{{NSA surveillance}}\nTice worked as an intelligence analyst for the [[U.S. Air Force]], [[Office of Naval Intelligence]], and [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA). During his nearly 20-year career with various [[United States]] government agencies, he conducted intelligence missions related to the [[Kosovo War]], [[Afghanistan]], the [[USS Cole bombing|USS ''Cole'' bombing]] in [[Yemen]], and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Tice was transferred from the Defense Intelligence Agency to the National Security Agency in 2002.\n\nIn April 2001 Tice reported his suspicions that an Asian-American woman he was working with was a Chinese spy, saying she had voiced sympathies for China, traveled extensively abroad and displayed affluence beyond her means.<ref name=\"Slate\">Patrick Radden Keefe (17 January 2006), [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2006/01/the_professional_paranoid.html The Professional Paranoid] ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''</ref><ref>Chris Strohm (19 January 2006), [http://www.govexec.com/defense/2006/01/ex-nsa-official-seeks-avenue-for-sharing-new-allegations/20988/ Ex-NSA official seeks avenue for sharing new allegations] ''[[Government Executive]]''</ref>  Tice was told his suspicions were unfounded.<ref name=\"Slate\" />\n\nAfter moving to the NSA, Tice continued to report his concerns. In April 2003, he wrote an email to the person at DIA handling his suspicions \"questioning the competence of counterintelligence at [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]\" and stating that he suspected he was being electronically monitored.

In a statement written to the Inspector General, Tice stated that the psychologist \"did this even though he admitted that I did not show any of the normal indications of someone suffering from paranoia\".  Tice said that three other psychiatric evaluations, including two at the NSA, showed he was normal and just two found him mentally unbalanced.<ref name=WTimes /> Tice would later say that \"I knew from that day that my career was over.\" Tice's security clearance was suspended and he was reassigned to maintaining vehicles in the motor pool for 8 months in what Tice considered \"administrative punishment.\"<ref name=Pulse /><ref name=WTimes />\n\nHe had been nominated to receive a medal for work he had done during the Iraq war, but after his clearance was suspended it was withdrawn.<ref name=WTimes />\n\nThe Pentagon Inspector General's office investigated the NSA for possibly retaliating against Tice. A defense official said Tice seemed 'to have been punished unfairly' and that it appeared he had communicated \"substantive concerns\".

Tice stated that the activities involved the Director of the NSA, the Deputies Chief of Staff for Air and Space Operations, and the [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]], and were conducted via very highly sensitive intelligence programs and operations known as [[special access program]]s (SAP), more commonly referred to as \"black world\" programs, or \"[[black ops]]\". Tice was a technical intelligence specialist dealing with SAP programs and operations at both NSA and DIA.<ref name=upi />\n\nOn December 16, the ''New York Times'' revealed that the NSA was engaged in a clandestine eavesdropping program that bypassed the secret [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA) court. Media reports on January 10, 2006, indicated Tice was a source of the ''Times'' leak, which revealed that, under the direction of the [[White House]] and without requisite court orders, the NSA has been intercepting international communications to and from points within the United States.<ref name=abc2006>{{cite web|last=Ross|first=Brian|title=NSA Whistleblower Alleges Illegal Spying|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1491889|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=9 August 2013|date=10 January 2006|quote=The same day the ''New York Times'' broke the story of the NSA eavesdropping without warrants, Tice surfaced as a whistleblower in the agency.

Tice said he initially understood that he was to identify the communication methods of journalists (and entire news organizations) so that they could avoid collection.  He said it was difficult for him to communicate securely after he became a whistleblower since \"I knew all my communications were tapped, my phones, my computer, and I've had the FBI on me like flies\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/22425001 |title=Msnbc.msn.com |publisher=NBC News |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/22425001 |title=Msnbc.msn.com |publisher=NBC News |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref>\n\nOn the heels of the first [[Edward Snowden]] NSA [[Global surveillance disclosures (1970\u20132013)|disclosures]] in 2013, Tice was asked during an interview on ''[[All In with Chris Hayes]]'', \"What was your experience in trying to blow the whistle from inside the NSA? And does it make you understand why Snowden might have done what he did?\" Tice replied,<ref name=AllInTranscript>{{cite web|last=Hayes|first=Chris|title=All In With Chris Hayes, Monday, June 10th, 2013|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/52168305/#.Uurb6_ZiBFQ|work=All In with Chris hayes|accessdate=30 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Oh, absolutely. I learned the hard way, you cannot trust any of the internal supposed mechanisms that are there for oversight. The chain of command, the IG [Inspector General]'s office, even at the DOD IG I found was basically trying to put a knife in my back.\n\nThe Whistleblower Protection Act does not apply to the intelligence community. They're exempt from it. And most people in the intelligence community, they don't realize that. So, you can't even go to the Office of Special Counsel because they're exempt from that, too, and the merit system protection board.\n\nSo even if you use the whistleblower - intelligence community Whistleblower Protection Act, the only thing that gives you is the right to go to Congress. It doesn't - it doesn't have any teeth there to protect you against retribution from the agency that you're reporting abuse on.}}\n\nAsked in June 2013 by ''The Guardian'' to comment on the early revelations about phone data collection by the NSA, Tice said: \"What is going on is much larger and more systemic than anything anyone has ever suspected or imagined ...

It is the headquarters of the [[Fo Guang Shan]] international organization and the largest Buddhist monastery in Taiwan.\n\n==History==\nIn 1967, [[Hsing Yun]] purchased more than 30 hectares in [[Dashu District|Dashu]] Township, [[Kaohsiung County]] as the site for the construction of a monastery. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on 16 May 1967.\nFo Guang Shan has undertaken many construction projects, including university buildings, shrines, and a cemetery. In 1975, Fo Guang Shan's 36-metre tall statue of [[Amit\u0101bha|Amit\u0101bha Buddha]] was consecrated. In 1981, 15 years after its establishment, the Great Hero Hall was built. During these times, many other Fo Guang Shan temples outside the order's mother monastery were also built.\nIn May 1997, Hsing Yun announced that he would close the mountain gate of Fo Guang Shan to the general public. His reason in closing the monastery was to give monastics the cloistered atmosphere they need for their Buddhist practice. In practice, many Chinese monasteries have also closed their mountain gates to give a cloistered atmosphere to the temple residents.\nAt the end of 2000, then President [[Chen Shui-bian]] of the Republic of China and government officials from [[Kaohsiung]] visited Fo Guang Shan, bringing with them the wish from their constituents that Fo Guang Shan reopen its mountain gate. After due consideration, Fo Guang Shan decided to reopen the monastery to some extent, thereby providing the public a place to practice [[Pure Land Buddhism]].\n\n==Campus==\nFo Guang Shan's main shrine has an area of 3570 square meters, is 30 meters in height, and can house up to one thousand people. There are three states of Buddhas, each 7.8 meters high. The Great Buddha is located on the eastern side of Fo Guang Shan next to the Great Wisdom Shrine. The Great Buddha is 36 meters in height, and is the highest standing Buddha in Southeast Asia. The interior four walls are filled with Dunhuang style stone niches enshrining 14800 more statues of [[Gautama Buddha|Sakyamuni Buddha]]. The Great Compassion Shrine ({{zh|t=\u5927\u60b2\u6bbf |p=D\u00e0b\u0113i di\u00e0n}}) has an area of 800 square meters, is 6 meters high, and contains a 6-meter-high statue of [[Guan Yin]].\n\nThe Sutra Repository ({{zh|t=\u85cf\u7d93\u6a13|p=C\u00e1ng j\u012bng l\u00f3u}}) houses over 50 copies of the [[Tripi\u1e6daka]]. \n\nThe campus of the associated [[Fo Guang Shan Buddha Museum]] is just to the north of the monastery.

The abbot of Fo Guang Shan Monastery is the overall head of the order, and all Fo Guang Shan temples, and is the chairperson of the Religious Affairs Committee, serving a term of six years, with one reappointment by popular vote and, under exceptional circumstances, a second reappointment by two-thirds vote. The abbot is elected by all members of Fo Guang Shan through public vote. The abbot-elect then begins to use their \"inner name\", in place of his/her own [[dharma name]], with the first character being ''Hsin'' (\"\u5fc3\", ''xin'', or heart). In fact, all monastics of Fo Guang Shan have such a name, and several Elders also use theirs publicly. At the beginning of the year, the abbot-elect is inaugurated as the new director of Fo Guang Shan through a [[dharma transmission]] ceremony, receiving the robe and bowl.\n\nHsing Yun is the only abbot to have served as such for more than two terms, and was not elected by the RAC. In the case of Venerable Hsin Ping (who was originally Venerable Zhizong), he was also not officially elected, as he was Hsing Yun's designated heir apparent. After Hsin Ping died, the vice director of Fo Guang Shan, Hsin Ting (originally Venerable Zhidu), was immediately elevated to serve the remaining years of Hsin Ping's term. Abbots have been elected according to FGS's constitution since then.\n\nAs with Hsing Yun, former abbots do not leave the order when they retire. They continue to make Dharma talks throughout the world and become head teachers of the order in their later years.\n\n<gallery widths=\"145px\">\nFile:\u661f\u96f2\u5927\u5e2b2009IBPS.jpg|[[Hsing Yun]]<br />(1967\u20131985)\nFile:No image.svg|[[Hsin Ping]]<br />(1985\u20131995)\nFile:Venerable Hsin Ting At Hsi Lai Temple, 2012.png|[[Hsin Ting]]<br />(1997\u20132005)\nFile:\u5fc3\u57f9\u548c\u5c1a.JPG|[[Hsin Pei]]<br />(2005\u20132013)\nFile:2010Jul11\u6167\u6fdf\u6cd5\u5e2b.JPG|[[Hsin Bao]]<br />(2013\u2013present)\n</gallery>\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|https://www.fgs.org.tw/en/}}\n\n{{Fo Guang Shan}}\n\n[[Category:Fo Guang Shan temples]]\n[[Category:Religious buildings and structures in Kaohsiung]]\n[[Category:Buddhist temples in Taiwan]]\n[[Category:1967 establishments in Taiwan]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox monastery\n|name= Fo Guang Shan Monastery\n|native_name    = \u4f5b\u5149\u5c71\u5bfa\n|native_name_lang = zh\n|image=File:\u4f5b\u5149\u5c71\u5bfa\u5168\u666f.jpg\n\n|order          = [[Fo Guang Shan]]\n|established    = 1967\n|location = {{coord|22.75708|N|120.44135|E|source:zhwiki|display=title,inline}}\n|founder=[[Hsing Yun]]\n|abbot=Hsin Pao \n|public_access  = Open to the public free of charge\n|website={{url|https://www.fgs.org.tw/en}}\n}}\n\n{{Buddhism}} \n'''Fo Guang Shan Monastery''' ({{zh|t=\u4f5b\u5149\u5c71\u5bfa|p=F\u00f3 Gu\u0101ng Sh\u0101n S\u00ec; lit.
