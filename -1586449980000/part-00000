Its administrative seat is at [[Zhanggong District]]. Its population was 8,361,447 at the 2010 census whom 1,977,253 in the built-up (or \"metro\") area made of Zhanggong and Nankang, and Ganxian largely being urbanized.\n\n==History==\nIn 201, [[Emperor Gaozu of Han]] established a county in the territory of modern Ganzhou. In those early years, [[Han Chinese]] settlement and authority in the area was minimal and largely restricted to the [[Gan River]] basin. The river, a tributary of the [[Yangtze]] via [[Poyang Lake]], provided a route of communication from the north as well as irrigation for rice farming.\n\nDuring the [[Sui dynasty]], the county administration was promoted to [[prefecture]] status and the area called Qianzhou ({{lang|zh|\u8654\u5dde}}). During the [[Song dynasty|Song]], immigration from the north bolstered the local population and drove local aboriginal tribes further into the hills. After the fall of the capital to the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] in 1126 in the [[Jingkang Incident]], immigration increased dramatically.\n\nThe province's name was officially changed to Ganzhou during the Southern Song (1127\u20131279).\n\nDuring the late 1800s Ganzhou was opened as one of the southern [[treaty ports]] and became a minor base for foreign companies. Between 1929 and 1934, Ganzhou formed a part of the [[Jiangxi\u2013Fujian Soviet]], one of the bases of the [[Communist Party of China]]. Due to its proximity to the Red capital [[Ruijin]], Ganzhou was subject to a number of [[Kuomintang]] encirclement campaigns.\n\n[[File:Chiang Ching-kuo in Gannan 10.jpg|thumb|left|Chiang Ching-kuo in Ganzhou]]\nBetween 1939 and 1945, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] was appointed by the [[Government of the Republic of China]] as commissioner of Ganzhou Prefecture (mountain South), then the name of the surrounding regions of Ganzhou. There he banned smoking, gambling and prostitution, studied governmental management, allowed for economic expansion and a change in social outlook. His efforts were hailed as a miracle in the political war in China, then coined as the \"Gannan New Deal\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u8d1b\u5357\u65b0\u653f}}). During his time in Gannan, from 1940 he implemented a \"public information desk\" where ordinary people could visit him if they had problems, and according to records, Chiang Ching-kuo received a total of 1,023 people during such sessions in 1942. In regards to the ban on prostitution and closing of brothels, Chiang implemented a policy where former prostitutes became employed in factories. Due to the large number of refugees in Ganzhou as a result from the ongoing war, thousands of orphans lived on the street; in June 1942, Chiang Ching-kuo formally established the Chinese Children's Village ({{lang|zh-hant|\u4e2d\u83ef\u5152\u7ae5\u65b0\u6751}}) in the outskirts of Ganzhou, with facilities such as a nursery, kindergarten, primary school, hospital and gymnasium.\n\n==Administration==\nGanzhou has jurisdiction over 3 [[District of China|districts]], 1 [[county-level city]] and 14 [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]]:\n\nDistrict:\n*[[Zhanggong District]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7ae0\u8d21\u533a}})\n*[[Nankang, Jiangxi|Nankang District]] ({{lang|zh|\u5357\u5eb7\u533a}})\n*[[Ganxian District]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u8d63\u53bf\u533a}})\n\nCounty-level cities:\n*[[Ruijin]] ({{lang|zh|\u745e\u91d1\u5e02}})\n\nCounties:\n*[[Yudu County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4e8e\u90fd\u53bf}})\n*[[Xingguo County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5174\u56fd\u53bf}})\n*[[Ningdu County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5b81\u90fd\u53bf}})\n*[[Shicheng County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u77f3\u57ce\u53bf}})\n*[[Huichang County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4f1a\u660c\u53bf}})\n*[[Xunwu County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5bfb\u4e4c\u53bf}})\n*[[Anyuan County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5b89\u8fdc\u53bf}})\n*[[Dingnan County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5b9a\u5357\u53bf}})\n*[[Longnan County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u9f99\u5357\u53bf}})\n*[[Quannan County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5168\u5357\u53bf}})\n*[[Xinfeng County, Jiangxi|Xinfeng County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4fe1\u4e30\u53bf}})\n*[[Dayu County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5927\u4f59\u53bf}})\n*[[Chongyi County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5d07\u4e49\u53bf}})\n*[[Shangyou County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4e0a\u72b9\u53bf}})\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

[[Jiangxi]], China, bordering [[Fujian]] to the east, [[Guangdong]] to the south, and [[Hunan]] to the west. Its administrative seat is at [[Zhanggong District]]. Its population was 8,361,447 at the 2010 census whom 1,977,253 in the built-up (or \"metro\") area made of Zhanggong and Nankang, and Ganxian largely being urbanized.\n\n==History==\nIn 201, [[Emperor Gaozu of Han]] established a county in the territory of modern Ganzhou. In those early years, [[Han Chinese]] settlement and authority in the area was minimal and largely restricted to the [[Gan River]] basin. The river, a tributary of the [[Yangtze]] via [[Poyang Lake]], provided a route of communication from the north as well as irrigation for rice farming.\n\nDuring the [[Sui dynasty]], the county administration was promoted to [[prefecture]] status and the area called Qianzhou ({{lang|zh|\u8654\u5dde}}). During the [[Song dynasty|Song]], immigration from the north bolstered the local population and drove local aboriginal tribes further into the hills. After the fall of the capital to the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] in 1126 in the [[Jingkang Incident]], immigration increased dramatically.\n\nThe province's name was officially changed to Ganzhou during the Southern Song (1127\u20131279).\n\nDuring the late 1800s Ganzhou was opened as one of the southern [[treaty ports]] and became a minor base for foreign companies. Between 1929 and 1934, Ganzhou formed a part of the [[Jiangxi\u2013Fujian Soviet]], one of the bases of the [[Communist Party of China]]. Due to its proximity to the Red capital [[Ruijin]], Ganzhou was subject to a number of [[Kuomintang]] encirclement campaigns.\n\n[[File:Chiang Ching-kuo in Gannan 10.jpg|thumb|left|Chiang Ching-kuo in Ganzhou]]\nBetween 1939 and 1945, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] was appointed by the [[Government of the Republic of China]] as commissioner of Ganzhou Prefecture (mountain South), then the name of the surrounding regions of Ganzhou. There he banned smoking, gambling and prostitution, studied governmental management, allowed for economic expansion and a change in social outlook. His efforts were hailed as a miracle in the political war in China, then coined as the \"Gannan New Deal\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u8d1b\u5357\u65b0\u653f}}). During his time in Gannan, from 1940 he implemented a \"public information desk\" where ordinary people could visit him if they had problems, and according to records, Chiang Ching-kuo received a total of 1,023 people during such sessions in 1942. In regards to the ban on prostitution and closing of brothels, Chiang implemented a policy where former prostitutes became employed in factories. Due to the large number of refugees in Ganzhou as a result from the ongoing war, thousands of orphans lived on the street; in June 1942, Chiang Ching-kuo formally established the Chinese Children's Village ({{lang|zh-hant|\u4e2d\u83ef\u5152\u7ae5\u65b0\u6751}}) in the outskirts of Ganzhou, with facilities such as a nursery, kindergarten, primary school, hospital and gymnasium.\n\n==Administration==\nGanzhou has jurisdiction over 3 [[District of China|districts]], 1 [[county-level city]] and 14 [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]]:\n\nDistrict:\n*[[Zhanggong District]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7ae0\u8d21\u533a}})\n*[[Nankang, Jiangxi|Nankang District]] ({{lang|zh|\u5357\u5eb7\u533a}})\n*[[Ganxian District]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u8d63\u53bf\u533a}})\n\nCounty-level cities:\n*[[Ruijin]] ({{lang|zh|\u745e\u91d1\u5e02}})\n\nCounties:\n*[[Yudu County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4e8e\u90fd\u53bf}})\n*[[Xingguo County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5174\u56fd\u53bf}})\n*[[Ningdu County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5b81\u90fd\u53bf}})\n*[[Shicheng County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u77f3\u57ce\u53bf}})\n*[[Huichang County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4f1a\u660c\u53bf}})\n*[[Xunwu County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5bfb\u4e4c\u53bf}})\n*[[Anyuan County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5b89\u8fdc\u53bf}})\n*[[Dingnan County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5b9a\u5357\u53bf}})\n*[[Longnan County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u9f99\u5357\u53bf}})\n*[[Quannan County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5168\u5357\u53bf}})\n*[[Xinfeng County, Jiangxi|Xinfeng County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4fe1\u4e30\u53bf}})\n*[[Dayu County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5927\u4f59\u53bf}})\n*[[Chongyi County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5d07\u4e49\u53bf}})\n*[[Shangyou County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4e0a\u72b9\u53bf}})\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

A highly intelligent [[mad scientist]], Doctor Octopus is typically portrayed as a stocky, [[Near-sightedness|myopic]] man who utilizes four powerful, mechanical appendages, and is a prominent enemy and ally of the superhero [[Spider-Man]], respectively as '''Doctor Octopus''' and the '''Superior Spider-Man'''.\n\nHis first brief appearance as the Superior Spider-Man was in ''Daredevil'' vol. 3 #21  (December 2012) and his first full appearance of the same character was in ''Avenging Spider-Man'' #15.1 (Dec. 2012). Though historically portrayed as a [[supervillain]], some depictions of him in the 2000s have indicated that he harbors more noble and honorable character traits, including those seen in the film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', in the action-adventure video game ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Marvel's Spider-Man]]'', and in the ''[[Superior Spider-Man]]'' comic book series. In the mainstream comics universe, Octavius has been recently portrayed as struggling to redeem himself, first as the antihero the Superior Octopus, before reclaiming the title of the Superior Spider-Man.\n\nThe character has appeared in numerous Spider-Man animations and video games, and is portrayed by [[Alfred Molina]] in the 2004 film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''.

Torbert did not appreciate having a bullied son, and roared at him to use violence in dealing with the bullies. Mary Octavius would always defend her son from Torbert's [[tirade]]s, saying he was a gifted thinker who would use his brain to solve problems, not his fists. Due to his mother's insistence and her disgust towards men who worked in common manual labor, Octavius was determined not to become like his father and threw all his efforts into his education, regularly scoring top marks. Octavius's devotion to study paid off with him being awarded a [[university]] [[scholarship]]. During Octavius's freshman year of college, he was undecided in his studies until they were briefly interrupted by his father's funeral; a construction accident having ended Torbert's life. When Mary Octavius remarked that \"an early death is a manual laborer's\" and she expected better from her son; this seemed to spur an obsession in Octavius about the hard sciences; and he declared his major to be physical science. His obsession, however, did not manifest immediately, and he was regarded by his school friends as a devoted student who was genuinely interested in the studies. He graduated near the top of his class, and was considered a catch to many scientfic firms. Octavius was soon hired by an engineering firm.\n\nOctavius became a brilliant and respected [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]], atomic research consultant, [[inventor]] and [[lecturer]]. He designed a set of highly advanced [[Waldos|mechanical arms]] controlled via a [[brain\u2013computer interface]] to assist him with his research into [[atomic physics]]. The tentacle-like arms were resistant to radiation and were capable of great strength and highly precise movement, attached to a harness that fit around his body.<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #3\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later in his criminal career, he claimed the inspiration for the device came from the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', the famous pencil sketch by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], one of his idols.<ref>''Spider-Man/Doctor Octopus: Negative Exposure'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThough his relationship with co-workers was typically hostile, he was social enough to give a demonstration of his harness to a small group. He showed how the metal tentacles allowed him to work safely with chemicals that would normally be too dangerous for a human being to touch or be in close vicinity to. One such person impressed by this was a scientist named Mary Alice Anders, and the two soon dated. In due time, Otto proposed marriage to Mary Alice. However, when Otto joyously announced his future marriage to his mother, her feelings were not reciprocated. Believing that no woman was good enough for her son, she made him feel guilty that she was going to be pushed aside for his bride-to-be. Shocked that he hurt his mother, and to please her, Otto broke off the engagement with Mary Alice. Later, when he discovered that his mother had begun dating a librarian, he rebuked her, causing her to have a fatal heart attack in the heat of their argument. With the death of his mother and Mary Alice Anders out of his life, Octavius' disposition towards nearly everyone became mean-spirited, and he had become more distracted from paying attention to detail and safety precautions in his work.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> His co-workers often called him \"Doctor Octopus\" behind his back, a pun on his actual name inspired by the four-armed apparatus; he was aware of this insult, but he barely cared.<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #3\"/>\n\n===Criminal career begins===\nDuring an accidental radiation leak that ended in an explosion, the apparatus became fused to Octavius's body. It was later revealed that the radiation (or possibly his own latent mutation) had mutated his brain so that he could control the movement of the arms using his thoughts alone. The tentacles have since been surgically removed from his body, although Octavius retains the power to control them telepathically from great distances. The accident also seemingly damaged his brain (although it was later suggested that what was interpreted as brain damage was, in fact, his mind rewiring itself to accommodate four extra limbs<ref name=\"untoldtales\">{{Cite book|last = DeCandido|first = Keith R.A.|authorlink = Keith R.A.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Trapped in the future, he attempted to return home by creating a dimensional portal, but found himself travelling to various alternate universes \u2013 including one where Spider-Man joined the [[Fantastic Four]] and a variation of the [[House of M]] \u2013 where all the Spider-Men were dead. Realizing that something was hunting Spider-Men across other dimensions, Octavius began to gather some of the more ruthless Spider-Men into a team that could oppose whatever was killing them, including Spider-Man Noir, a multi-armed Spider-Man, Pavitr Prabhakar, and a Peter Parker working in black ops with Wolverine.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #32. Marvel Comics.</ref> As the crisis unfolds, Octavius takes command of a group of alternate Spider-Men, considering himself particularly qualified to lead them due to his unique nature and willingness to kill,{{issue|date=December 2014}} but when his team is confronted by another group led by the Peter Parker of Earth-616 \u2013 who Octavius presumes is a past Peter as he cannot contemplate the possibility that he will fail- he is forced to concede to Peter's leadership when Peter defeats him in a fight, Peter stating that killing Morlun and the Inheritors is not the answer, as they will just come back, and they need a new plan.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 3) #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although he realizes that Peter comes from his future when Peter recognizes Anna Maria's name, Otto is forced to acknowledge his own failures when he learns that another Earth where [[Uncle Ben#Spider-Verse|Ben Parker]] was the Spider-Totem was reduced to a nuclear wasteland due to the actions of his own local counterpart.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man' 2015\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 3) #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nTo stop the Inheritors from traveling around the multiverse, hunting all animal totems as fast as possible, Octavius identified the [[Karn (comics)|Master Weaver]] as the source of their abilities to traverse the multiverse, and killed him. However, Morlun feared the consequences of this action,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 3) #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> resulting in Karn, the surviving defected Inheritor, taking the Weaver's place (although it was noted that the Weaver was actually Karn's future self, creating a complex temporal paradox). Having learned that he was 'destined' to be replaced by Peter Parker, Octavius attempted to attack the multiversal web to 'save' himself from his destiny, claiming that he was giving the spiders the 'gift' of free will, but the Earth-616 spiders were able to defeat him as their surviving allies returned to their home dimensions. Before he departed, Octavius issued a time-delayed message to the Anna Maria program, intended to activate 100 days after he returned to his home time, but upon his return to his time, his memory of his time with the Spider-Army is erased, allowing history to unfold as it should.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 3) #15.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Following the events of ''Spider-Verse'', Otto Octavius had backed up his consciousness in one of his gauntlets (the Superior Spider-Man's web-shooters) that slept for 100 days using the technology he acquired from 2099.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #18. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' #32-33. Marvel Comics.</ref> The gauntlet housed a copy of Octavius's consciousness up to the point of ''Spider-Verse'' (without the memories of learning about power and responsibility for his act of self-sacrifice in ''Goblin Nation'', as this copy would remain asleep during this time). After transforming the gauntlet into a version of an Octobot, he backed himself up in the Living Brain while waiting for the next opportunity to take over Parker's body again, planning to act at a time when Parker's spider-sense would be taxed so that he would miss the relevant signals.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #18\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #18.

Upon hearing about it from within the Living Brain, Doctor Octopus' consciousness expresses an interest in the procedure.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Peter Parker scanned the Living Brain to find out why it was acting unusually, Doctor Octopus' consciousness asked why it was erased. Realizing the truth, Peter Parker shut down the Living Brain, only for Doctor Octopus' consciousness to reactivate it and cause it to self-destruct while escaping in the Octobot. Arriving at New U Enterprises, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot plans to get his biological body back, convinced that the consciousness in Parker's body was \"infected\" by its time in Spider-Man to believe that Peter was superior rather than himself.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #18\"/> Upon heading to Potter's Field, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot finds that Doctor Octopus' body was grave-robbed, alongside those of Alistair Alphonso Smythe and other villains. It traces the grave robbery to New U Technologies. Finding Doctor Octopus' body, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot allowed it to be cloned and perfected. After eliminating the copy of Peter Parker's consciousness, Doctor Octopus gains control of the clone body and emerges from the vat where he resembles his earlier appearance. The [[Ben Reilly|Jackal]] was present where he presents him with his tentacle pack. Now an ally of the Jackal, Doctor Octopus receives the special New U Pills to prevent his body from suffering clone degeneration.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #20\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #20.

When the Jackal enters the laboratory, Anna Maria reveals she knows how to stop the decaying process on the clones and the Jackal offers her the \"Proto-Clone\" body in exchange for the formula. Octavius takes offense to the Jackal's comments on Maria's dwarfism and attacks his boss. Then he pulls a switch which activates the Carrion Virus in all of the clones and causes them to start rapidly decaying.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDoctor Octopus fights the Jackal to allow Peter and Anna Maria the time to transmit the frequency, Spider-Man correctly anticipating that Octavius would act to protect Anna regardless of their own history. The frequency has a huge effect on Doctor Octopus and the Jackal. Upon checking New U Technologies' Haven following the broadcast, Spider-Man and Anna Maria find that Ben Reilly, Doctor Octopus, and Gwen Stacy have been seemingly reduced to dust.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #5.

He defeats the HYDRA soldiers, but is then recruited into HYDRA by [[Arnim Zola]]. Zola grants him the leadership of some HYDRA soldiers to work for him in arranging the destruction of [[Parker Industries]]. With HYDRA's help, he creates a new uniform for himself, becoming the Superior Octopus, intending to wait for Peter's actions to trigger the collapse of Parker Industries so that he can retake his position and prove himself superior once again.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 4 #25\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #25.

Marvel Comics.</ref> but Peter turns the tables on Octavius by ordering his employees to literally destroy the company in order to hurt HYDRA, thwarting Octavius' attempt to shut down his new high-tech suit with an EMP by reverting to his traditional costume and turning the EMP trick against Octavius so that his own tentacles attack him. Octavius is forced to flee the battle.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #31.

Jonah Jameson]] help defend [[Aunt May]] as the Superior Octopus still retains some of Peter's memories and sense of responsibility. This concludes with Peter forgiving the Superior Octopus and giving him a \"clean slate\". In the [[Go Down Swinging (comics)|aftermath of Osborn's defeat]], the Superior Octopus reveals his new identity as Dr. Elliot Tolliver, a person who has just started working at Horizon University. He was seen applying for a job under Max Modell as [[Anna Maria Marconi|Anna Maria]] starts acting suspicious towards Dr. Elliot Tolliver.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #800. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====\"Spider-Geddon\"====\nDuring the \"[[Spider-Geddon]]\" storyline, the Superior Octopus is seen fighting the [[Night Shift (comics)|Night Shift]]. The Superior Octopus agrees to spare them more pain in exchange for the Night Shift becoming his agents, where he will compensate them from his own funds. They agree to the terms and are ordered to return the stolen items. The Superior Octopus leaves, advising them never to cross him or they will not live long enough to regret it. After a day at Horizon University and saving some people on the Bay Bridge, the Superior Octopus fights Arnim Zola, a bio-duplicate of [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]], and some HYDRA agents who seek to repossess his services to rebuild HYDRA. The Superior Octopus states that he is done with his end of the bargain and attacks them. When the [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon bio-duplicate]] turns the Superior Octopus to stone and shatters him, another Superior Octopus body emerges, where it destroys the [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon bio-duplicate]] and defeats [[Arnim Zola]], while informing him to spread the word to HYDRA to never come for him again. The Superior Octopus' inner monologue states that he had perfected [[Miles Warren (comics)|Miles Warren]]'s cloning technology where each clone had to be made from the deceased in order to maintain their memories as a way to conquer death.<ref>''Superior Octopus'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, after Octavius forces Count Nefaria into retreating from Los Angeles, he is confronted in his cloning workshop by the Spider-Army. They reveal that his cloning process has been 'hacked' by the Inheritors, who fed his computers hours-old data until they were ready to manifest, with these new Inheritors swiftly killing Spider-Man Noir and Spider-UK. Octavius then quotes \"What have I done...\"<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> After initiating his base's self-destruct sequence to slow down the Inheritors, the Superior Octopus states that they still should have killed the Inheritors while they had the chance. Upon heading to his lab at Horizon High to change into his Superior Spider-Man appearance, he goes to recruit Kaine and states that they should leave Ben Reilly out of the fight, since Jennix is targeting the cloning technology from the now-defunct New U Technologies. As the Superior Spider-Man and Kaine enter the portal, they are unaware that Ben Reilly has followed them.<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>The Superior Spider-Man heads to Earth-1048 to recruit [[Spider-Man (Insomniac Games)|that world's Spider-Man]], where he helps to defeat the Tarantula and learned about his counterpart.<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Spider-Norman and Spiders-Man sundered Earth-616's connection to the Web of Life and Destiny, Octavius seemingly betrayed Ben, giving him to the Inheritors in exchange for the other Spiders being left alone.<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Spider-Man of Earth-1048, who had been secretly following both Octavius and Ben from behind, believed Octavius made the same mistake as his counterpart in betraying their own, Octavius revealed to him that he and Ben purposely planned this to trick the Inheritors into consuming the clone that will drove them insane, starting from when he was forced to relive the memories of Ben's 29 deaths and resurrections. With the help from surviving Spider-Men who are trapped in Earth-616, including those who were trapped in another universe (including Kaine and 616's Peter), Octavius manages to resurrect Ben in his 30th resurrection. With the Inheritors turned into babies to be raised by Spider-Ma'am (Aunt May) for their redemption; the same goes for Morlun, who is currently in 616's high-security prison. Octavius resumes being the Superior Spider-Man.<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===''The Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2)===\nAfter the events of \"Spider-Geddon\", Octavius resumes his career as the Superior Spider-Man once again, protecting San Francisco with the hired assistance of the Night Shift. His identity as Dr. Elliot Tolliver is uncovered by Anna Maria, who confronts him with the rebuilt Living Brain, but the appearance of Terrax the Tamer gives Octavius a chance to temporarily evade this. Despite lacking the weaponry, technology and the Night Shift's assistance (who ran away in fear after one of their undead members is cut in half) to take on Terrax, Octavius refuses to back down despite being heavily injured during the fight against him. With help from Anna Maria and the Night Shift, Octavius is able to use a device to siphon a fraction of Terrax's Power Cosmic and transfer it to himself, giving him cosmic powers. Despite this upgrade, Octavius is still unable to defeat Terrax until he is able to change the frequency of the latter's axe and trick him into taking it back, causing a feedback which shocks Terrax unconscious. With the fight over, Octavius returns the Power Cosmic back to the machine and passes out. When he awakens, he is being treated by Anna Maria, who decides that she will help Otto be a real hero but if he ever returns to his Doctor Octopus persona, she will have him arrested or worse. Octavius agrees to this, believing she would make the perfect partner for him.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While helping the authorities rebuild San Francisco and rescue survivors, the Superior Spider-Man learns about humility and begins to connect with the people. Unbeknownst to him, Master Pandemonium emerges from the wreckage, planning to strike.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #2-4. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Master Pandemonium attacks, the Superior Spider-Man is forced to work with Doctor Strange to stop Pandemonium after he possesses Elliot Tolliver's new associate Emma Hernandez, revealing in flashbacks that the two met before they adopted their later identities, with Doctor Strange rejecting a request to help Octavius develop the original harness and Octavius later ignoring the now-destitute Strange after the accident. While fighting Master Pandemonium, the two are forced to 'swap' for a time, with Doctor Strange using the Superior Spider-Man's 'spinnerets' to operate on Pandemonium and shut him down, while the Superior Spider-Man uses the Cloak of Levitation. At the fight's conclusion, the Superior Spider-Man asks if Doctor Strange could cast the same spell that he used to make the world forget about Peter's identity. Doctor Strange rejects that request, as the original spell could only be cast under specific circumstances and in any case he feels that it does the Superior Spider-Man good to have people aware of his past so that he will not be tempted to \"regress.\"<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[War of the Realms]]\" storyline, the Superior Spider-Man worked to save the civilians from a Frost Giant invasion. Then he came up with the idea to work with the [[West Coast Avengers]] in order to make use of [[Miss America (America Chavez)|America Chavez]]'s powers. After rescuing them with his Octavian Lens, the Superior Spider-Man barely convinced them to help fight the Asgardian invasion at the source. They would have to go to New York City, since the Asgardian magic is interfering with America's powers.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the midst of the battle between the [[Fantastic Four]] and [[Malekith the Accursed]]'s forces, the Superior Spider-Man worked with Mister Fantastic to enable America Chavez to duplicate the Bifrost Bridge's energy. After the two of them failed to locate the strike team in Svartalfheim, the Superior Spider-Man and Mister Fantastic located the strike team in Jotunheim. Those in Jotunheim persuaded the Superior Spider-Man to focus on protecting Earth. The Superior Spider-Man returned to New York City to lead the West Coast Avengers in protecting the citizens.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nOnce the War was over, the Superior Spider-Man received an award from the city for his role in its defense, but the Superior Spider-Man found himself troubled by the ceremony, confessing to Spider-Man later that he felt as though he should have been able to save more. Offering his own experience as a hero, Spider-Man consoled the Superior Spider-Man by observing that Octavius's feeling this hurt over random deaths proved that he was moving on from his old villainous history. Unbeknownst to Elliot Tolliver on his date with Emma Hernandez, he is being spied upon by one of the spiders that make up Spiders-Man of Earth-11580 on behalf of Norman Osborn of Earth-44145. After being told the information he received from Spiders-Man of Earth-11580, Norman Osborn of Earth-44145 begins his revenge plans on the Superior Spider-Man.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following a date with Emma Hernandez, they notice a news leak that asks if the Superior Spider-Man is really Doctor Octopus. Spider-Man, Mister Fantastic, and Doctor Strange had noted their collaboration with the Superior Spider-Man and his involvement in fighting the Frost Giants. Even the Brothers Grimm made their comment about working for them. The next day, Max Modell calls Elliot Tolliver to his office, where Tolliver admits that he is the Proto-Clone created by New U Technologies and is hosting Otto Octavius' mind. Modell stated that he already knew of him being the Proto-Clone and the Superior Spider-Man, as well as stating that he believes in second chances. Upon analyzing the security footage of the leak, the Superior Spider-Man finds small spiders and figures out that Spiders-Man of Earth-11580 was responsible. Spiders-Man of Earth-11580 attacks them as the Superior Spider-Man uses a Wave Disruption Field to trap the main spider. Getting a confession from him, Superior Spider-Man reveals to Modell about the Norman Osborn of Earth-44145, who operates as the Spider-Man of his reality. Spiders-Man of Earth-11580 states that Spider-Man of Earth-44145 is safe on his world and that they will never reach him. In Horizon University's sub-basement two, Superior Spider-Man states that they will not be able to power the dimensional transporter without something that can replicate the energies of the Cosmic Cube. Anna Maria and the Living Brain revealed that they harnessed the cosmic energies from the fight with Terrax in the Cosmic Harness invention. When the Living Brain enters the cosmic energies into the system, he starts to overload and it causes an explosion. As the Superior Spider-Man holds up the rubble, Spider-Man of Earth-44145 appears, revealing that he was on Earth-616 all this time thanks to the fragment of the Web of Life and Destiny that he holds that enables him to travel to different dimensions. Upon knocking down the Superior Spider-Man, Spider-Man of Earth-44145 reveals that he is going to kill everyone that he cares about as part of his revenge on the Superior Spider-Man for insulting him.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> While rescue crews get most of those caught in the explosion to safety, Spiders-Man and Spider-Osborn defeat Dansen Macabre, Digger, and Skein before Spider-Osborn captures James Martin, stating that he will release the boy only if Octavius kills three citizens on camera (forbidding him from 'cheating' by targeting criminals or the terminally ill) so that people will see that the 'Superior Spider-Man' is a fraud. With no way to call for help from the Avengers or other heroes without endangering James, and believing that he cannot win against Osborn as he is, Octavius uses a signal move he learned from Doctor Strange to call [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who states that Spider-Man of Earth-44145 is out of his jurisdiction. Octavius asks Mephisto to restore him to the man he once was for a day so that he can fight Spider-Man of Earth-44145, but Mephisto rejects that request, musing that he may already have Octavius's soul anyway, and makes a counter-offer; he will ''permanently'' restore Octavius to his original body, with no trait of disease or any of the 'taints' he picked up from Peter Parker. Anna Maria attempts to convince Octavius that it is too great of a risk, while Mephisto mocks Octavius with his old claims that he was only a criminal due to brain damage from the bond with his original arms as he simultaneously 'assures' Octavius that such a taint will not be a factor now. Later, the Brothers Grimm are attacked by the apparently restored Doctor Octopus as they collect their payment, with Octopus demanding the location of Spider-Man of Earth-44145 from them or else they will die.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Using a clone of Elliot Tolliver, Doctor Octopus gets to Spider-Man of Earth-44145 and uses his old harnesses to defeat him. Using the Web of Life and Destiny, Doctor Octopus throws Spider-Man of Earth-44145 back to his world. After briefly visiting Anna Maria and Emma at the hospital, Doctor Octopus watches the funeral for Elliot from afar. Digger is informed to distribute the severance pay to the remaining members of the Night Shift so they will not bother him again and to warn them not to go visit the Brothers Grimm in the hospital. Doctor Octopus then walks away, leaving his Superior Spider-Man outfit in the garbage.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nOtto Octavius is a genius in the field of [[atomic physics]], and he holds a [[Doctor of Philosophy#United States|Ph. D.]] in nuclear science. A brilliant engineer and inventor, he is also a superb strategist and a charismatic leader. His genius in radiation is so exceptional that he was once called upon by [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] to offer his expertise when the [[Invisible Woman]] suffered from complications during her [[Valeria Richards|second pregnancy]] as a result of the cosmic radiation that had given the team their powers.<ref name=\"Fantastic Four #267\"/>\n\nDue to exposure to atomic radiation, Doctor Octopus has acquired the mental ability of psychokinetic control over the four electrically powered, telescoping, [[Prehensility|prehensile]], [[titanium]]-steel artificial tentacle \"arms\" (a degree of psychokinetic control over them that he can also exercise over vast distances even when they are not connected to him) that are attached to a stainless-steel harness encompassing his lower torso. Each of these four arms is capable of lifting several tons, provided that at least one arm is used to support his body. The reaction time and agility of his mechanical appendages are enhanced far beyond the range attainable for normal human musculature. The arms allow Octavius to move rapidly over any terrain and to scale vertical surfaces and ceilings. He has developed his concentration and control to the point that he can engage a single opponent, like [[Spider-Man]], or multiple opponents with the arms while performing a completely separate, more delicate task, such as stirring coffee or constructing a machine. Due to his weight and age, his opponents are often lured into a false sense of security, only to find he is a formidable combatant. He has managed to force opponents as formidable as Spider-Man, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and [[Captain America]] to take up a defensive position in a fight.<ref>[http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/7/18514151252-orig.jpg Spectacular Spider-Man #221] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221140910/http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/7/18514151252-orig.jpg |date=February 21, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nDoctor Octopus has also employed an armored body suit enabling him to breathe underwater and designed to withstand extreme water pressure.{{issue|date=November 2010}}\n\nDoctor Octopus has begun wearing a full-body armor suit due to a crippling illness caused by the amount of punishment he has sustained over the years, made even worse by the fact that his ability to ''take'' damage is still at a human norm, even if he can deliver a superhuman level of punishment; he relies completely on his arms to prevent opponents with superhuman strength getting in close enough to damage his relatively unfit physical form even before his illness. To compensate, he has covered his entire body with his new suit, his normal arms are bound to his chest, and four additional tentacles have been added to his harness. He has also developed psychokinetic-telepathic control over an army of \"Octobots\" (small [[octopus]]-like drones).<ref name=\"ASM600\"/>\n\n===Harnesses===\nDoctor Octopus has possessed a total of three different harnesses during his career: the original [[titanium]] harness, a more powerful [[adamantium]] harness, and a carbonanium harness with tentacles bearing an octopus-like motif. The original and adamantium harnesses were both destroyed in the four-issue miniseries ''The Lethal Foes of Spider-Man''.\n\nHis current harness is made of a titanium-steel-niobium alloy mixture that is dense but light weight in composition. While wearing the harness, the arms are powerful enough to allow him to walk up sheer concrete walls and move about quickly. They are also used to grab items, both small and large, and as literal weapons in terms of being swung at objects and people like clubs. The pincers at the end of each tentacle can also be used to cut and tear into the flesh of his enemies. His sheer power using these appendages was great enough to beat [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], a seasoned combatant with superhuman senses, almost to death.<ref>''Daredevil'' #165. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe adamantium harness was powerful enough to both restrain and pummel the [[Hulk]] into submission during a series written by Erik Larsen. The adamantium in his tentacles made besting [[Iron Man]] in combat possible, tearing the hero's armor apart with a defeat so harsh that Tony Stark began to doubt his abilities almost enough to allow his persistent problem with alcohol abuse to flare up.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #22. Marvel Comics.</ref> The harness is also capable of holding a small jetpack allowing him to fly to places faster and able to evade Spider-Man more easily. Doctor Octopus is even capable of whirling his tentacles around to deflect small projectiles like bullets.\n\n===Powers as the Superior Spider-Man===\nHaving taken over Spider-Man's body,<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #698\"/>Octavius gains possession of all of Spider-Man's powers, abilities, memories, and equipment,<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #700\"/> although he loses access to Spider-Man's memories after apparently removing his foe from their shared mind.<ref name=\"SSM9\"/> As a way to reaffirm his perceived superior mind, he tinkered with the original Spider-Man costume, adding some [[carbonadium]] plating over his neck and skull,<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #700\"/> talons on his hands and feet, split-toed footwear fashioned as [[Tabi|jika-tabi]] shoes, a slightly different, more imposing spider-motif on his back and enhanced lenses in his costume, with HUD and tracking abilities.<ref name=\"Avenging Spider-Man 15.1\"/>\n\nHe also retains access to some of his former Doctor Octopus hideouts, coupling Horizon Tech-derived inventions with his own peculiar brand of technology.<ref name=\"Avenging Spider-Man 15.1\"/>\n\n===Octobots===\nThe '''[[Octobot (robot)|Octobots]]''' are octopus-themed robots that are created by Doctor Octopus. There are two different kinds of Octobots:\n\n* The first model of the Octobot seen is a little metal ball with eight legs which are controlled mentally by Doctor Octopus via a remote control.

Plans for these remain to be seen.\n\nIn the \"[[Clone Saga#Ultimate Spider-Man Clone Saga|Ultimate Clone Saga]]\", Otto Octavius was revealed to be responsible for all the Spider-Man clones, including an older clone believing itself to be [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]], and a [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Marvel|Gwen Stacy]] clone that can transform into the [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Carnage]] creature. His experimentation and research was done for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations|FBI]]/[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] (both organizations are said to be behind it in different issues) in order to find a way to create super soldiers so the [[U.S. Government]] wouldn't have to be reliant on Fury's monopoly on the Ultimates.{{issue|date=June 2013}} He smugly reveals he is now outside Fury's jurisdiction and takes pleasure in pointing out to Peter that his work perverts the hero's life.

Octavius uses the arm harness to conduct an Oscorp-funded fusion experiment using [[tritium]] that becomes impossible to control, resulting in Rosie's death and the fusion of the harness to Octavius's body. This destroys the inhibitor chip that keeps the arms' artificial intelligence in check. After massacring the surgeons trying to save him, the arms' AI then convinces Octavius to steal the funds needed to attempt the experiment again. He comes into conflict with Spider-Man when he robs a bank, and takes Aunt May hostage. Though Spider-Man saves May, Octavius escapes.

Founding his own organization, Octavius Industries, he works to perfect prosthetic limb technology, motivated by a neurological disorder he is developing. Octavius employs Peter Parker as his lab assistant and is secretly aware of his activities as Spider-Man (although he claims that he only thinks Peter is Spider-Man's armorer). After their grant funding is shut down by Osborn exploiting his position as Mayor, Octavius gets new funding from [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] (A.I.M.). He also becomes enamored by [[Mister Negative|Martin Li]], a former victim of Oscorp's experimentation who has been leading attacks against the city in order to destroy Norman. Working with Peter on a set of mechanical tentacle appendages with four pincers that can be controlled through thought, Octavius loses control of his emotions due to a defect with the implants used to connect them directly to his nervous system, and leads a mass prison break from Ryker's Island and the Raft. Forming the Sinister Six with several of Spider-Man's foes, he organizes a series of attacks on Oscorp and releases the Devil's Breath virus in the hopes of exposing Norman's crimes. Octavius is eventually defeated by Peter as Spider-Man and pleads for help escaping from the police.

His father Torbert Octavius, a factory worker, was abusive and violent towards both Otto and his mother Mary Lavinia Octavius. The young Octavius's shyness and good work in school got him labeled as a \"teacher's pet\" and targeted as a subject for bullying. Torbert did not appreciate having a bullied son, and roared at him to use violence in dealing with the bullies. Mary Octavius would always defend her son from Torbert's [[tirade]]s, saying he was a gifted thinker who would use his brain to solve problems, not his fists. Due to his mother's insistence and her disgust towards men who worked in common manual labor, Octavius was determined not to become like his father and threw all his efforts into his education, regularly scoring top marks. Octavius's devotion to study paid off with him being awarded a [[university]] [[scholarship]]. During Octavius's freshman year of college, he was undecided in his studies until they were briefly interrupted by his father's funeral; a construction accident having ended Torbert's life. When Mary Octavius remarked that \"an early death is a manual laborer's\" and she expected better from her son; this seemed to spur an obsession in Octavius about the hard sciences; and he declared his major to be physical science. His obsession, however, did not manifest immediately, and he was regarded by his school friends as a devoted student who was genuinely interested in the studies. He graduated near the top of his class, and was considered a catch to many scientfic firms. Octavius was soon hired by an engineering firm.\n\nOctavius became a brilliant and respected [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]], atomic research consultant, [[inventor]] and [[lecturer]]. He designed a set of highly advanced [[Waldos|mechanical arms]] controlled via a [[brain\u2013computer interface]] to assist him with his research into [[atomic physics]]. The tentacle-like arms were resistant to radiation and were capable of great strength and highly precise movement, attached to a harness that fit around his body.<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #3\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later in his criminal career, he claimed the inspiration for the device came from the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', the famous pencil sketch by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], one of his idols.<ref>''Spider-Man/Doctor Octopus: Negative Exposure'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThough his relationship with co-workers was typically hostile, he was social enough to give a demonstration of his harness to a small group. He showed how the metal tentacles allowed him to work safely with chemicals that would normally be too dangerous for a human being to touch or be in close vicinity to. One such person impressed by this was a scientist named Mary Alice Anders, and the two soon dated. In due time, Otto proposed marriage to Mary Alice. However, when Otto joyously announced his future marriage to his mother, her feelings were not reciprocated. Believing that no woman was good enough for her son, she made him feel guilty that she was going to be pushed aside for his bride-to-be. Shocked that he hurt his mother, and to please her, Otto broke off the engagement with Mary Alice. Later, when he discovered that his mother had begun dating a librarian, he rebuked her, causing her to have a fatal heart attack in the heat of their argument. With the death of his mother and Mary Alice Anders out of his life, Octavius' disposition towards nearly everyone became mean-spirited, and he had become more distracted from paying attention to detail and safety precautions in his work.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> His co-workers often called him \"Doctor Octopus\" behind his back, a pun on his actual name inspired by the four-armed apparatus; he was aware of this insult, but he barely cared.<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #3\"/>\n\n===Criminal career begins===\nDuring an accidental radiation leak that ended in an explosion, the apparatus became fused to Octavius's body. It was later revealed that the radiation (or possibly his own latent mutation) had mutated his brain so that he could control the movement of the arms using his thoughts alone. The tentacles have since been surgically removed from his body, although Octavius retains the power to control them telepathically from great distances.

Intending to leave a lasting legacy, he attempts to exert control over New York City by using his newly minted Octobots, but while he consciously intends to help, his subconscious drives him to turn the city's resources against Spider-Man, and he also targets May Parker aggressively (deeming her guilty of being due to marry J.

Distraught, Octavius (in a sudden surge of empathy for his sworn nemesis) vows to steer himself away from villainy and accepts Peter's dying wish of having a Spider-Man protect New York.

After beating Peter to a pulp by breaking his spirit with the knowledge Peter was willing let a girl named Amy come close to death when Octavius was performing surgery on her with a scanner that would have detected him, Octavius declares his final victory while calling Peter unworthy to be called Spider-Man and believes that he deleted all of Spider-Man's memories.

His fixation in proving himself Spider-Man's superior reached a particular climax when [[Spider-Man 2099]] came to the past to deal with a temporal anomaly,<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #17.

After transforming the gauntlet into a version of an Octobot, he backed himself up in the Living Brain while waiting for the next opportunity to take over Parker's body again, planning to act at a time when Parker's spider-sense would be taxed so that he would miss the relevant signals.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #18\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #18. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAt the time when the Living Brain was at Parker Industries' London branch, Doctor Octopus' consciousness expresses anger over being forced to act like their lackey. After Sajani Jaffrey is fired by Peter Parker for conspiring against him, Doctor Octopus' consciousness smirks as Anna is made the head of Parker Industries' London branch.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====\"Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy\"====\nDuring the \"[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]\" storyline, Peter decides to have Parker Industries get familiar with New U Enterprises' \"New U\" system, which is a program where replacement organs are cloned for those suffering from serious injuries. Upon hearing about it from within the Living Brain, Doctor Octopus' consciousness expresses an interest in the procedure.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Peter Parker scanned the Living Brain to find out why it was acting unusually, Doctor Octopus' consciousness asked why it was erased. Realizing the truth, Peter Parker shut down the Living Brain, only for Doctor Octopus' consciousness to reactivate it and cause it to self-destruct while escaping in the Octobot. Arriving at New U Enterprises, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot plans to get his biological body back, convinced that the consciousness in Parker's body was \"infected\" by its time in Spider-Man to believe that Peter was superior rather than himself.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #18\"/> Upon heading to Potter's Field, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot finds that Doctor Octopus' body was grave-robbed, alongside those of Alistair Alphonso Smythe and other villains. It traces the grave robbery to New U Technologies. Finding Doctor Octopus' body, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot allowed it to be cloned and perfected. After eliminating the copy of Peter Parker's consciousness, Doctor Octopus gains control of the clone body and emerges from the vat where he resembles his earlier appearance. The [[Ben Reilly|Jackal]] was present where he presents him with his tentacle pack. Now an ally of the Jackal, Doctor Octopus receives the special New U Pills to prevent his body from suffering clone degeneration.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #20\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen Spider-Man later infiltrates New U Technologies after witnessing video footage of one of its subjects suffering from cellular degeneration, he evades the initial security force, including the Rhino and the [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Francine Frye|female Electro]]. When he discovers what appears to be Gwen Stacy, he is distracted long enough to be caught off-guard by the reborn Octavius, once again in his own body with new tentacles.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> With Spider-Man trapped in his tentacles, Doctor Octopus tells him that he is not a clone or a hologram, but the real Otto Octavius.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #20\"/>\n\nAfter Silk escapes from New U Technologies, Doctor Octopus attacks Spectro who was unable to phase through the walls with the test subject. Doctor Octopus and Spectro fight until Electro arrives and knocks out Spectro. Doctor Octopus later experiments with Spectro and plans to put him into a cloned body.<ref>''Silk'' (vol. 2) #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhile studying the clones of [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] and Electro in order to perfect the Proto-Clone, Anna Maria was brought to Otto and she becomes uncomfortable when Doctor Octopus starts appealing towards his love interest. When the Jackal enters the laboratory, Anna Maria reveals she knows how to stop the decaying process on the clones and the Jackal offers her the \"Proto-Clone\" body in exchange for the formula. Octavius takes offense to the Jackal's comments on Maria's dwarfism and attacks his boss. Then he pulls a switch which activates the Carrion Virus in all of the clones and causes them to start rapidly decaying.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDoctor Octopus fights the Jackal to allow Peter and Anna Maria the time to transmit the frequency, Spider-Man correctly anticipating that Octavius would act to protect Anna regardless of their own history. The frequency has a huge effect on Doctor Octopus and the Jackal. Upon checking New U Technologies' Haven following the broadcast, Spider-Man and Anna Maria find that Ben Reilly, Doctor Octopus, and Gwen Stacy have been seemingly reduced to dust.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was later revealed that Doctor Octopus rendered Ben Reilly unconscious and escaped by transmitting his mind into the Proto-Clone (a perfect clone of Peter Parker) before Ben Reilly could.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #24.

He defeats the HYDRA soldiers, but is then recruited into HYDRA by [[Arnim Zola]]. Zola grants him the leadership of some HYDRA soldiers to work for him in arranging the destruction of [[Parker Industries]]. With HYDRA's help, he creates a new uniform for himself, becoming the Superior Octopus, intending to wait for Peter's actions to trigger the collapse of Parker Industries so that he can retake his position and prove himself superior once again.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 4 #25\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #25.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Outside of his work with HYDRA's Avengers, the Superior Octopus approached Spider-Man, where he wants him to transfer ownership of Parker Industries back to him. When Peter Parker declined this offer, the Superior Octopus had the HYDRA agents in Parker Industries' London branch blow up the building.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #29. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Peter flees to the Shanghai branch of Parker Industries, Octavius attempts to implement various security protocols he had added to all Parker Industries tech that allows him to retake control of anything developed by the company,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #30. Marvel Comics.</ref> but Peter turns the tables on Octavius by ordering his employees to literally destroy the company in order to hurt HYDRA, thwarting Octavius' attempt to shut down his new high-tech suit with an EMP by reverting to his traditional costume and turning the EMP trick against Octavius so that his own tentacles attack him. Octavius is forced to flee the battle.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #31. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====''Go Down Swinging'' and redemption====\nDuring the ''[[Go Down Swinging (comic book)|Go Down Swinging]]'' story arc where the Red Goblin (Norman Osborn who has powered himself up with the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage symbiote]]) attacks Spider-Man and all his friends and family, the Superior Octopus and [[J. Jonah Jameson]] help defend [[Aunt May]] as the Superior Octopus still retains some of Peter's memories and sense of responsibility. This concludes with Peter forgiving the Superior Octopus and giving him a \"clean slate\". In the [[Go Down Swinging (comics)|aftermath of Osborn's defeat]], the Superior Octopus reveals his new identity as Dr. Elliot Tolliver, a person who has just started working at Horizon University. He was seen applying for a job under Max Modell as [[Anna Maria Marconi|Anna Maria]] starts acting suspicious towards Dr. Elliot Tolliver.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #800. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====\"Spider-Geddon\"====\nDuring the \"[[Spider-Geddon]]\" storyline, the Superior Octopus is seen fighting the [[Night Shift (comics)|Night Shift]]. The Superior Octopus agrees to spare them more pain in exchange for the Night Shift becoming his agents, where he will compensate them from his own funds. They agree to the terms and are ordered to return the stolen items. The Superior Octopus leaves, advising them never to cross him or they will not live long enough to regret it. After a day at Horizon University and saving some people on the Bay Bridge, the Superior Octopus fights Arnim Zola, a bio-duplicate of [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]], and some HYDRA agents who seek to repossess his services to rebuild HYDRA. The Superior Octopus states that he is done with his end of the bargain and attacks them. When the [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon bio-duplicate]] turns the Superior Octopus to stone and shatters him, another Superior Octopus body emerges, where it destroys the [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon bio-duplicate]] and defeats [[Arnim Zola]], while informing him to spread the word to HYDRA to never come for him again. The Superior Octopus' inner monologue states that he had perfected [[Miles Warren (comics)|Miles Warren]]'s cloning technology where each clone had to be made from the deceased in order to maintain their memories as a way to conquer death.<ref>''Superior Octopus'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, after Octavius forces Count Nefaria into retreating from Los Angeles, he is confronted in his cloning workshop by the Spider-Army. They reveal that his cloning process has been 'hacked' by the Inheritors, who fed his computers hours-old data until they were ready to manifest, with these new Inheritors swiftly killing Spider-Man Noir and Spider-UK. Octavius then quotes \"What have I done...\"<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> After initiating his base's self-destruct sequence to slow down the Inheritors, the Superior Octopus states that they still should have killed the Inheritors while they had the chance. Upon heading to his lab at Horizon High to change into his Superior Spider-Man appearance, he goes to recruit Kaine and states that they should leave Ben Reilly out of the fight, since Jennix is targeting the cloning technology from the now-defunct New U Technologies. As the Superior Spider-Man and Kaine enter the portal, they are unaware that Ben Reilly has followed them.<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>The Superior Spider-Man heads to Earth-1048 to recruit [[Spider-Man (Insomniac Games)|that world's Spider-Man]], where he helps to defeat the Tarantula and learned about his counterpart.<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Spider-Norman and Spiders-Man sundered Earth-616's connection to the Web of Life and Destiny, Octavius seemingly betrayed Ben, giving him to the Inheritors in exchange for the other Spiders being left alone.<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Spider-Man of Earth-1048, who had been secretly following both Octavius and Ben from behind, believed Octavius made the same mistake as his counterpart in betraying their own, Octavius revealed to him that he and Ben purposely planned this to trick the Inheritors into consuming the clone that will drove them insane, starting from when he was forced to relive the memories of Ben's 29 deaths and resurrections. With the help from surviving Spider-Men who are trapped in Earth-616, including those who were trapped in another universe (including Kaine and 616's Peter), Octavius manages to resurrect Ben in his 30th resurrection. With the Inheritors turned into babies to be raised by Spider-Ma'am (Aunt May) for their redemption; the same goes for Morlun, who is currently in 616's high-security prison. Octavius resumes being the Superior Spider-Man.<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===''The Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2)===\nAfter the events of \"Spider-Geddon\", Octavius resumes his career as the Superior Spider-Man once again, protecting San Francisco with the hired assistance of the Night Shift. His identity as Dr. Elliot Tolliver is uncovered by Anna Maria, who confronts him with the rebuilt Living Brain, but the appearance of Terrax the Tamer gives Octavius a chance to temporarily evade this. Despite lacking the weaponry, technology and the Night Shift's assistance (who ran away in fear after one of their undead members is cut in half) to take on Terrax, Octavius refuses to back down despite being heavily injured during the fight against him. With help from Anna Maria and the Night Shift, Octavius is able to use a device to siphon a fraction of Terrax's Power Cosmic and transfer it to himself, giving him cosmic powers. Despite this upgrade, Octavius is still unable to defeat Terrax until he is able to change the frequency of the latter's axe and trick him into taking it back, causing a feedback which shocks Terrax unconscious. With the fight over, Octavius returns the Power Cosmic back to the machine and passes out. When he awakens, he is being treated by Anna Maria, who decides that she will help Otto be a real hero but if he ever returns to his Doctor Octopus persona, she will have him arrested or worse. Octavius agrees to this, believing she would make the perfect partner for him.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While helping the authorities rebuild San Francisco and rescue survivors, the Superior Spider-Man learns about humility and begins to connect with the people. Unbeknownst to him, Master Pandemonium emerges from the wreckage, planning to strike.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #2-4. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Master Pandemonium attacks, the Superior Spider-Man is forced to work with Doctor Strange to stop Pandemonium after he possesses Elliot Tolliver's new associate Emma Hernandez, revealing in flashbacks that the two met before they adopted their later identities, with Doctor Strange rejecting a request to help Octavius develop the original harness and Octavius later ignoring the now-destitute Strange after the accident. While fighting Master Pandemonium, the two are forced to 'swap' for a time, with Doctor Strange using the Superior Spider-Man's 'spinnerets' to operate on Pandemonium and shut him down, while the Superior Spider-Man uses the Cloak of Levitation. At the fight's conclusion, the Superior Spider-Man asks if Doctor Strange could cast the same spell that he used to make the world forget about Peter's identity. Doctor Strange rejects that request, as the original spell could only be cast under specific circumstances and in any case he feels that it does the Superior Spider-Man good to have people aware of his past so that he will not be tempted to \"regress.\"<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[War of the Realms]]\" storyline, the Superior Spider-Man worked to save the civilians from a Frost Giant invasion. Then he came up with the idea to work with the [[West Coast Avengers]] in order to make use of [[Miss America (America Chavez)|America Chavez]]'s powers. After rescuing them with his Octavian Lens, the Superior Spider-Man barely convinced them to help fight the Asgardian invasion at the source. They would have to go to New York City, since the Asgardian magic is interfering with America's powers.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the midst of the battle between the [[Fantastic Four]] and [[Malekith the Accursed]]'s forces, the Superior Spider-Man worked with Mister Fantastic to enable America Chavez to duplicate the Bifrost Bridge's energy. After the two of them failed to locate the strike team in Svartalfheim, the Superior Spider-Man and Mister Fantastic located the strike team in Jotunheim. Those in Jotunheim persuaded the Superior Spider-Man to focus on protecting Earth. The Superior Spider-Man returned to New York City to lead the West Coast Avengers in protecting the citizens.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nOnce the War was over, the Superior Spider-Man received an award from the city for his role in its defense, but the Superior Spider-Man found himself troubled by the ceremony, confessing to Spider-Man later that he felt as though he should have been able to save more. Offering his own experience as a hero, Spider-Man consoled the Superior Spider-Man by observing that Octavius's feeling this hurt over random deaths proved that he was moving on from his old villainous history. Unbeknownst to Elliot Tolliver on his date with Emma Hernandez, he is being spied upon by one of the spiders that make up Spiders-Man of Earth-11580 on behalf of Norman Osborn of Earth-44145. After being told the information he received from Spiders-Man of Earth-11580, Norman Osborn of Earth-44145 begins his revenge plans on the Superior Spider-Man.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following a date with Emma Hernandez, they notice a news leak that asks if the Superior Spider-Man is really Doctor Octopus. Spider-Man, Mister Fantastic, and Doctor Strange had noted their collaboration with the Superior Spider-Man and his involvement in fighting the Frost Giants. Even the Brothers Grimm made their comment about working for them. The next day, Max Modell calls Elliot Tolliver to his office, where Tolliver admits that he is the Proto-Clone created by New U Technologies and is hosting Otto Octavius' mind. Modell stated that he already knew of him being the Proto-Clone and the Superior Spider-Man, as well as stating that he believes in second chances. Upon analyzing the security footage of the leak, the Superior Spider-Man finds small spiders and figures out that Spiders-Man of Earth-11580 was responsible. Spiders-Man of Earth-11580 attacks them as the Superior Spider-Man uses a Wave Disruption Field to trap the main spider. Getting a confession from him, Superior Spider-Man reveals to Modell about the Norman Osborn of Earth-44145, who operates as the Spider-Man of his reality. Spiders-Man of Earth-11580 states that Spider-Man of Earth-44145 is safe on his world and that they will never reach him. In Horizon University's sub-basement two, Superior Spider-Man states that they will not be able to power the dimensional transporter without something that can replicate the energies of the Cosmic Cube. Anna Maria and the Living Brain revealed that they harnessed the cosmic energies from the fight with Terrax in the Cosmic Harness invention. When the Living Brain enters the cosmic energies into the system, he starts to overload and it causes an explosion. As the Superior Spider-Man holds up the rubble, Spider-Man of Earth-44145 appears, revealing that he was on Earth-616 all this time thanks to the fragment of the Web of Life and Destiny that he holds that enables him to travel to different dimensions. Upon knocking down the Superior Spider-Man, Spider-Man of Earth-44145 reveals that he is going to kill everyone that he cares about as part of his revenge on the Superior Spider-Man for insulting him.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> While rescue crews get most of those caught in the explosion to safety, Spiders-Man and Spider-Osborn defeat Dansen Macabre, Digger, and Skein before Spider-Osborn captures James Martin, stating that he will release the boy only if Octavius kills three citizens on camera (forbidding him from 'cheating' by targeting criminals or the terminally ill) so that people will see that the 'Superior Spider-Man' is a fraud. With no way to call for help from the Avengers or other heroes without endangering James, and believing that he cannot win against Osborn as he is, Octavius uses a signal move he learned from Doctor Strange to call [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who states that Spider-Man of Earth-44145 is out of his jurisdiction. Octavius asks Mephisto to restore him to the man he once was for a day so that he can fight Spider-Man of Earth-44145, but Mephisto rejects that request, musing that he may already have Octavius's soul anyway, and makes a counter-offer; he will ''permanently'' restore Octavius to his original body, with no trait of disease or any of the 'taints' he picked up from Peter Parker. Anna Maria attempts to convince Octavius that it is too great of a risk, while Mephisto mocks Octavius with his old claims that he was only a criminal due to brain damage from the bond with his original arms as he simultaneously 'assures' Octavius that such a taint will not be a factor now. Later, the Brothers Grimm are attacked by the apparently restored Doctor Octopus as they collect their payment, with Octopus demanding the location of Spider-Man of Earth-44145 from them or else they will die.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Using a clone of Elliot Tolliver, Doctor Octopus gets to Spider-Man of Earth-44145 and uses his old harnesses to defeat him. Using the Web of Life and Destiny, Doctor Octopus throws Spider-Man of Earth-44145 back to his world. After briefly visiting Anna Maria and Emma at the hospital, Doctor Octopus watches the funeral for Elliot from afar. Digger is informed to distribute the severance pay to the remaining members of the Night Shift so they will not bother him again and to warn them not to go visit the Brothers Grimm in the hospital. Doctor Octopus then walks away, leaving his Superior Spider-Man outfit in the garbage.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nOtto Octavius is a genius in the field of [[atomic physics]], and he holds a [[Doctor of Philosophy#United States|Ph. D.]] in nuclear science. A brilliant engineer and inventor, he is also a superb strategist and a charismatic leader. His genius in radiation is so exceptional that he was once called upon by [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] to offer his expertise when the [[Invisible Woman]] suffered from complications during her [[Valeria Richards|second pregnancy]] as a result of the cosmic radiation that had given the team their powers.<ref name=\"Fantastic Four #267\"/>\n\nDue to exposure to atomic radiation, Doctor Octopus has acquired the mental ability of psychokinetic control over the four electrically powered, telescoping, [[Prehensility|prehensile]], [[titanium]]-steel artificial tentacle \"arms\" (a degree of psychokinetic control over them that he can also exercise over vast distances even when they are not connected to him) that are attached to a stainless-steel harness encompassing his lower torso. Each of these four arms is capable of lifting several tons, provided that at least one arm is used to support his body. The reaction time and agility of his mechanical appendages are enhanced far beyond the range attainable for normal human musculature. The arms allow Octavius to move rapidly over any terrain and to scale vertical surfaces and ceilings. He has developed his concentration and control to the point that he can engage a single opponent, like [[Spider-Man]], or multiple opponents with the arms while performing a completely separate, more delicate task, such as stirring coffee or constructing a machine. Due to his weight and age, his opponents are often lured into a false sense of security, only to find he is a formidable combatant. He has managed to force opponents as formidable as Spider-Man, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and [[Captain America]] to take up a defensive position in a fight.<ref>[http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/7/18514151252-orig.jpg Spectacular Spider-Man #221] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221140910/http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/7/18514151252-orig.jpg |date=February 21, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nDoctor Octopus has also employed an armored body suit enabling him to breathe underwater and designed to withstand extreme water pressure.{{issue|date=November 2010}}\n\nDoctor Octopus has begun wearing a full-body armor suit due to a crippling illness caused by the amount of punishment he has sustained over the years, made even worse by the fact that his ability to ''take'' damage is still at a human norm, even if he can deliver a superhuman level of punishment; he relies completely on his arms to prevent opponents with superhuman strength getting in close enough to damage his relatively unfit physical form even before his illness. To compensate, he has covered his entire body with his new suit, his normal arms are bound to his chest, and four additional tentacles have been added to his harness. He has also developed psychokinetic-telepathic control over an army of \"Octobots\" (small [[octopus]]-like drones).<ref name=\"ASM600\"/>\n\n===Harnesses===\nDoctor Octopus has possessed a total of three different harnesses during his career: the original [[titanium]] harness, a more powerful [[adamantium]] harness, and a carbonanium harness with tentacles bearing an octopus-like motif. The original and adamantium harnesses were both destroyed in the four-issue miniseries ''The Lethal Foes of Spider-Man''.\n\nHis current harness is made of a titanium-steel-niobium alloy mixture that is dense but light weight in composition. While wearing the harness, the arms are powerful enough to allow him to walk up sheer concrete walls and move about quickly. They are also used to grab items, both small and large, and as literal weapons in terms of being swung at objects and people like clubs. The pincers at the end of each tentacle can also be used to cut and tear into the flesh of his enemies. His sheer power using these appendages was great enough to beat [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], a seasoned combatant with superhuman senses, almost to death.<ref>''Daredevil'' #165. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe adamantium harness was powerful enough to both restrain and pummel the [[Hulk]] into submission during a series written by Erik Larsen. The adamantium in his tentacles made besting [[Iron Man]] in combat possible, tearing the hero's armor apart with a defeat so harsh that Tony Stark began to doubt his abilities almost enough to allow his persistent problem with alcohol abuse to flare up.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #22. Marvel Comics.</ref> The harness is also capable of holding a small jetpack allowing him to fly to places faster and able to evade Spider-Man more easily. Doctor Octopus is even capable of whirling his tentacles around to deflect small projectiles like bullets.\n\n===Powers as the Superior Spider-Man===\nHaving taken over Spider-Man's body,<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #698\"/>Octavius gains possession of all of Spider-Man's powers, abilities, memories, and equipment,<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #700\"/> although he loses access to Spider-Man's memories after apparently removing his foe from their shared mind.<ref name=\"SSM9\"/> As a way to reaffirm his perceived superior mind, he tinkered with the original Spider-Man costume, adding some [[carbonadium]] plating over his neck and skull,<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #700\"/> talons on his hands and feet, split-toed footwear fashioned as [[Tabi|jika-tabi]] shoes, a slightly different, more imposing spider-motif on his back and enhanced lenses in his costume, with HUD and tracking abilities.<ref name=\"Avenging Spider-Man 15.1\"/>\n\nHe also retains access to some of his former Doctor Octopus hideouts, coupling Horizon Tech-derived inventions with his own peculiar brand of technology.<ref name=\"Avenging Spider-Man 15.1\"/>\n\n===Octobots===\nThe '''[[Octobot (robot)|Octobots]]''' are octopus-themed robots that are created by Doctor Octopus.

These [[Octobot (robot)|Octobots]] can also be used to attack, to perform different tasks, and attach themselves to anyone so that Doctor Octopus can control them.\n* The second model of the Octobot seen is a giant metallic robot which Doctor Octopus uses to attack huge constructions.\n\nThe Octobots have at least two known variations:\n\n* The '''[[Spider-Slayer]]s''' \u2013 These Spider-Slayers that appeared in ''[[Spider-Island]]'' are actually first generation Octobots that Spider-Man had laden with a special serum which was used to cure the Spider-Virus that slowly turned everyone into Man-Spiders.\n* The '''Spider-Bots''' \u2013 The Spider-Bots are small red and blue spiders.

He is officially conducting experiments on primates to study their brains in connection with evolution and, in the end, it is shown he is secretly taking in kidnapped African-Americans for his own, more secret experiments. He is later revealed to in fact be working with the Nazis and their American proxies, the \"[[Friends of New Germany]]\", with the plot of making all minorities into mindless slaves.

In the 1970s, Octavius gave up his criminal life after a heart attack. He eventually married May Parker and was offered a job at Future Foundations by Reed Richards. However, May later divorced him due to his anger management issues, leading him to a life of crime once more. \nIn 1995, Norman Osborn tells him Spider-Man's secret identity and reveals he has a clone named Ben Reilly in Chicago. The elderly Otto kidnaps Peter and Ben and takes them to Oscorp (after threatening Harry for the equipment) so he could learn how to clone himself a new body. While studying them, he discovers that Peter is supposedly the clone while Ben was the original, leading Ben to lash out at him. He attempts to kill both Peter and Ben, but ends up accidentally killing Harry and runs away in shock. Peter later discovers that Norman rigged the machines Octavius was using to make it appear that he was the clone. In 2019, the dying Octavius switches bodies with the newer, younger Spider-Man, Miles Morales, in order to preserve his life and become a \"superior\" hero. He aids the older Peter Parker in activating the \"Doomsday Pulse\" in space to shut down Doctor Doom's tech across the planet. After they encounter a Venom-possessed Kraven, Peter deduces that Octavius is in Miles' body from his interactions with Kraven and his technical knowledge. Octavius attempts to destroy Peter's mind, but Peter uses a memory of Aunt May to convince him to accept his life's limitations. Peter sends Octavius back to Earth with the space station's only escape pod and sacrifices himself to activate the Doomsday Pulse. After his return, Octavius willingly puts himself and Miles back in their original bodies.<ref> ''Spider-Man: Life Story'' #2-6.

He is caught in a lab accident involving the drug [[OZ (Ultimate Marvel)|OZ]] that also turns Norman into the [[Alternative versions of the Green Goblin#Ultimate Marvel|Green Goblin]] (infecting his son [[Harry Osborn|Harry]] as well). After this accident, his traditional metal arms are grafted onto his body and he is able to communicate with these mechanical arms via telepathy. He modifies his arms to have the power to morph into different shapes, and then seeks revenge against Hammer, but Spider-Man intervenes. Although Octavius is defeated by Spider-Man, Justin perishes due to a heart attack caused by Octavius attacking him. Afterwards, Octavius is brought into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody where he, along with Osborn, form the [[Sinister Six|Ultimate Six]], consisting of some of Spider-Man's [[rogues gallery]]. There are only five villains to begin with, but Osborn planned to bring Spider-Man into the group. The five attack S.H.I.E.L.D. and capture an unmasked Spider-Man. They tie him to a chair, and Osborn humiliates Peter by recounting the accident that created him, and he and Otto's involvements. Osborn then blackmails Peter Parker into joining them, threatening Mary Jane Watson's life. In a battle between the Six and the Ultimates on the White House lawn, Octopus is taken down by the [[Wasp (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Wasp]]. Octavius is separated from his tentacles and held in a different prison far away from them. Octavius later finds out that his ex-wife is giving the rights to use his likeness in the Spider-Man film. Outraged, he summons his tentacles from the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and goes on a rampage. He manages to capture Spider-Man, and he brings him aboard an airplane, ties him to a chair, and unmasks him. From there, he inflicts humiliation and torture on to Peter, mocking him as a teenager, pulling a tooth out, and webbing his mouth. Peter escaped, and defeats Octavius. Back in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] melts Doctor Octopus' mechanical arms in front of him and instructs the guards to watch the melting mechanism for at least an hour afterwards to make sure the arms would not try to escape. However, in the ''Ultimate Hobgoblin'' story arc, it was revealed that a spare set of arms existed within a bunker belonging to Osborn. Plans for these remain to be seen.\n\nIn the \"[[Clone Saga#Ultimate Spider-Man Clone Saga|Ultimate Clone Saga]]\", Otto Octavius was revealed to be responsible for all the Spider-Man clones, including an older clone believing itself to be [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]], and a [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Marvel|Gwen Stacy]] clone that can transform into the [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Carnage]] creature. His experimentation and research was done for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations|FBI]]/[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] (both organizations are said to be behind it in different issues) in order to find a way to create super soldiers so the [[U.S. Government]] wouldn't have to be reliant on Fury's monopoly on the Ultimates.{{issue|date=June 2013}} He smugly reveals he is now outside Fury's jurisdiction and takes pleasure in pointing out to Peter that his work perverts the hero's life. In issue #104, he creates a new set of arms out of metal scraps and battles both Spider-Man and [[Spider-Woman (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Woman]], killing two other clones in the process, before being knocked out.<ref name=\"UltimateSpiderMan\" />\n\nOctavius makes a brief appearance in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #113 confronting Norman Osborn as the latter breaks out of the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]]; he attacks his former boss to prevent his escape, informing him that he betrayed him by giving the OZ formula to the FBI.

After their escape, Osborn informs them that God wishes for them to kill Peter Parker.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #156. Marvel Comics.</ref> Octavius wanted to leave the group, because he wanted to live a normal life as a scientist and also said that he took enough pride in helping create Spider-Man. Osborn was outraged by the fact that Octavius tried to share credit for Spider-Man's existence and attacked him.

This version is depicted as a sympathetic, misguided character and husband to Rosie Octavius (portrayed by [[Donna Murphy]]). He first meets Peter Parker when [[Harry Osborn]] introduces the two so that Peter can interview Octavius for a paper he is writing. Octavius uses the arm harness to conduct an Oscorp-funded fusion experiment using [[tritium]] that becomes impossible to control, resulting in Rosie's death and the fusion of the harness to Octavius's body. This destroys the inhibitor chip that keeps the arms' artificial intelligence in check. After massacring the surgeons trying to save him, the arms' AI then convinces Octavius to steal the funds needed to attempt the experiment again. He comes into conflict with Spider-Man when he robs a bank, and takes Aunt May hostage. Though Spider-Man saves May, Octavius escapes. He eventually makes a deal with Osborn to bring him Spider-Man in exchange for more tritium. To lure Spider-Man out into the open, Octavius kidnaps [[Mary Jane Watson]] and battles Spider-Man atop an elevated train, which he sends careening out of control.

Octavius keeps Watson as a hostage in an abandoned pier warehouse where he begins another attempt at the experiment, unaware, or not caring that it will destroy half of the city. When Spider-Man arrives, they battle again, resulting in the arms being damaged. After Spider-Man willingly reveals his identity as Peter Parker, he reminds Octavius of the latter's own words on how intelligence should be used for the good of mankind, causing Otto's original personality to overpower the A.I. of the arms.

Founding his own organization, Octavius Industries, he works to perfect prosthetic limb technology, motivated by a neurological disorder he is developing. Octavius employs Peter Parker as his lab assistant and is secretly aware of his activities as Spider-Man (although he claims that he only thinks Peter is Spider-Man's armorer). After their grant funding is shut down by Osborn exploiting his position as Mayor, Octavius gets new funding from [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] (A.I.M.). He also becomes enamored by [[Mister Negative|Martin Li]], a former victim of Oscorp's experimentation who has been leading attacks against the city in order to destroy Norman. Working with Peter on a set of mechanical tentacle appendages with four pincers that can be controlled through thought, Octavius loses control of his emotions due to a defect with the implants used to connect them directly to his nervous system, and leads a mass prison break from Ryker's Island and the Raft. Forming the Sinister Six with several of Spider-Man's foes, he organizes a series of attacks on Oscorp and releases the Devil's Breath virus in the hopes of exposing Norman's crimes. Octavius is eventually defeated by Peter as Spider-Man and pleads for help escaping from the police. Peter refuses and reluctantly leaves him behind for the authorities, eventually leading to his imprisonment in the Raft.\n* Doctor Octopus appears as a boss in ''[[Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order]]'' voiced again by William Salyers.

Before 1975, the monarch used to preside over meetings of the Council of State.]]\n\nThe '''King-in-Council''' or the '''Queen-in-Council''', depending on the [[gender]] of the reigning monarch, is a constitutional term in a number of states. In a general sense, it would mean the monarch exercising executive authority, usually in the form of approving orders, in the presence of the country's executive council.\n\n==Norway==\n{{main|Council of State (Norway)}}\n\nIn Norway, the \"King in Council\" ({{lang-no|Kongen i statsr\u00e5d}}) refers to the meetings of the King and the [[Council of State (Norway)|Council of State]] (the Cabinet), where matters of importance and major decisions are made. The council meets at the Royal Palace and is normally held every Friday. It is chaired by the King or, if he is ill or abroad, the Crown Prince. In Norway's Constitution, when formulated as ''King in Council'' (''Kongen i Statsr\u00e5d'') refers to the formal [[Government of Norway]]. When the formulation is merely ''King'', the appointed ministerium that the law refers to may alone act with complete authority of the matter assigned in the particular law.[http://grunnloven.lovdata.no/]\n\nA decision that is taken in the State Council under the King's leadership is a royal decree. If the Crown Prince chairs, they are Crown Prince resolutions. When neither the King nor the Crown Prince chairs, resolutions adopted are called Government resolutions.\n\n==Sweden==\n{{main|King in Council (Sweden)}}\n\nIn Sweden, the King in Council ({{Lang-sv|Konungen i Statsr\u00e5det}}), more commonly known as Royal Majesty, ({{Lang-sv|Kunglig Majest\u00e4t}} or the short forms ({{lang-sv|Kungl.Maj:t}}) or ({{lang-sv|K.M:t}}) was a concept of constitutional importance in Sweden until 1974.\n\nRoyal Majesty was the commonly used term to refer to the supreme executive authority under the [[1809 Instrument of Government]], where the King made all decisions of state in the presence of his cabinet ministers. The [[1974 Instrument of Government]] removed the monarch from all exercise of formal political powers which were passed to the newly created [[Government of Sweden|Government]] ({{Lang-sv|Regeringen}}), chaired and led in all aspects by the [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]].\n\n==The Commonwealth==\n{{main|Queen's Privy Council for Canada|Privy Council of the United Kingdom}}\n{{see also|Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)}}\nThe Queen-in-Council is the technical term of [[constitutional law]] for the exercise of [[Executive (government)|executive authority]] in a [[Commonwealth realm]], denoting the monarch acting by and with the [[advice and consent]] of his or her [[privy council]] (in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]]'s federal jurisdiction) or [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|executive council]] (in most other Commonwealth realms, Australian states, and in Canadian provinces). In those realms and dependencies where the Queen's powers and functions are delegated to a [[Governor-General|governor-general]], [[Lieutenant-Governor|lieutenant governor]], or [[governor]], the term ''Governor-General-in-Council'', ''Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council'', or ''Governor-in-Council'' may be used instead of Queen-in-Council, respectively, although all of these terms describe the same technical process within constitutional law. \"The government of [''[[jurisdiction]]'']\" is commonly used as a synonym for any of the aforementioned terms, though the phrase may mean more than one thing in certain areas.\n\nAn order made by the Queen-in-Council is known as an ''[[Order-in-Council]]'' and such actions are subject to [[judicial review]].<ref>{{cite court| litigants=The Queen on the Application of Louis Olivier Bancoult v.

Before 1975, the monarch used to preside over meetings of the Council of State.]]\n\nThe '''King-in-Council''' or the '''Queen-in-Council''', depending on the [[sex]] of the reigning monarch, is a constitutional term in a number of states. In a general sense, it would mean the monarch exercising executive authority, usually in the form of approving orders, in the presence of the country's executive council.\n\n==Norway==\n{{main|Council of State (Norway)}}\n\nIn Norway, the \"King in Council\" ({{lang-no|Kongen i statsr\u00e5d}}) refers to the meetings of the King and the [[Council of State (Norway)|Council of State]] (the Cabinet), where matters of importance and major decisions are made. The council meets at the Royal Palace and is normally held every Friday. It is chaired by the King or, if he is ill or abroad, the Crown Prince. In Norway's Constitution, when formulated as ''King in Council'' (''Kongen i Statsr\u00e5d'') refers to the formal [[Government of Norway]]. When the formulation is merely ''King'', the appointed ministerium that the law refers to may alone act with complete authority of the matter assigned in the particular law.[http://grunnloven.lovdata.no/]\n\nA decision that is taken in the State Council under the King's leadership is a royal decree. If the Crown Prince chairs, they are Crown Prince resolutions. When neither the King nor the Crown Prince chairs, resolutions adopted are called Government resolutions.\n\n==Sweden==\n{{main|King in Council (Sweden)}}\n\nIn Sweden, the King in Council ({{Lang-sv|Konungen i Statsr\u00e5det}}), more commonly known as Royal Majesty, ({{Lang-sv|Kunglig Majest\u00e4t}} or the short forms ({{lang-sv|Kungl.Maj:t}}) or ({{lang-sv|K.M:t}}) was a concept of constitutional importance in Sweden until 1974.\n\nRoyal Majesty was the commonly used term to refer to the supreme executive authority under the [[1809 Instrument of Government]], where the King made all decisions of state in the presence of his cabinet ministers. The [[1974 Instrument of Government]] removed the monarch from all exercise of formal political powers which were passed to the newly created [[Government of Sweden|Government]] ({{Lang-sv|Regeringen}}), chaired and led in all aspects by the [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]].\n\n==The Commonwealth==\n{{main|Queen's Privy Council for Canada|Privy Council of the United Kingdom}}\n{{see also|Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)}}\nThe Queen-in-Council is the technical term of [[constitutional law]] for the exercise of [[Executive (government)|executive authority]] in a [[Commonwealth realm]], denoting the monarch acting by and with the [[advice and consent]] of his or her [[privy council]] (in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]]'s federal jurisdiction) or [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|executive council]] (in most other Commonwealth realms, Australian states, and in Canadian provinces). In those realms and dependencies where the Queen's powers and functions are delegated to a [[Governor-General|governor-general]], [[Lieutenant-Governor|lieutenant governor]], or [[governor]], the term ''Governor-General-in-Council'', ''Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council'', or ''Governor-in-Council'' may be used instead of Queen-in-Council, respectively, although all of these terms describe the same technical process within constitutional law. \"The government of [''[[jurisdiction]]'']\" is commonly used as a synonym for any of the aforementioned terms, though the phrase may mean more than one thing in certain areas.\n\nAn order made by the Queen-in-Council is known as an ''[[Order-in-Council]]'' and such actions are subject to [[judicial review]].<ref>{{cite court| litigants=The Queen on the Application of Louis Olivier Bancoult v.

Son of a senior gandhian Lakshmi Narayan Jha, who was offered to become the first chief minister of bihar but refused as he called himself a freedom fighter then a politician. Ramesh Chandra Jha's poems, [[ghazal]]s and stories evoke patriotism and human values. Romanticism and struggle of life are also important aspects of his writing. His poetry expresses concerns of people's life struggle, their dreams and hopes.\n\nHis research published as ''Apne Aur Sapne : A Literary Journey Of Champaran'' in the 1960s traced the rich literary heritage of [[Champaran]] in [[Bihar]] and noted the upcoming young poets such as Dinesh Bhramar and Pandey Ashutosh.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/ApneAurSapneALitereryJourneyOfChamparanByRameshChandraJha/ Apne Aur Sapne : Online PDF book at Archive.org]</ref>\n\n==Life history==\nRamesh Chandra Jha was born on 8 May 1928 in Fulwariya village of [[Sugauli]] in [[East Champaran district]], known as [[Motihari]], [[Bihar]]. His father, Laxmi Narayan Jha, was a well-known patriot and freedom fighter who fought against [[British Raj|British rule]] and was arrested many times, including on 15 April 1917 when [[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited Champaran for his [[Satyagrah]] movement. That incident inspired the son to become rebellious and he was convicted of robbery at the age of 14. Even Ramesh Jha created various chaos inside of the jail and become problematic for British officers.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nJha was not just a patriotic poet but went to jail many times during British rule because of his involvement in the [[Quit India Movement]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gCnRzJwcqSQC&redir_esc=y/ Bihar Through the Ages : Ritu Chaturvedi, S.R.Bakshi 2007]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=mf4p-Ll5w6sC/ Champaran to Quit India Movement : Mittal Publication 2002]</ref> He was student of Hazarimal High School, [[Raxaul]] that time and was entrapped into several cases of the robbery at police stations during freedom struggle. In his school days he led student protest and was later thrown out from the school.\n\nS. R. Bakshi and Ritu Chaturvedi in his research based book have said that {{quote|At his phulwariya village in great hardship, Gokul Thakur ordered Ramesh Chandra and Rama Kant Jha to go to Sugaon and to take account of the articles were removed and also the condition of imposed collective fines.
