The band take their name from the [[slogan]] \"54-40 or Fight!\", coined to express the unsuccessful expansionist agenda of [[James K. Polk]]'s presidency, which was intent upon controlling a contested U.S.-Canada border area in the [[Oregon boundary dispute]]. 54-40 has had a successful career, with four of their albums being certified Platinum in Canada. Between 1995 and 2016, 54-40 were among the top 150 selling Canadian artists in Canada and among the top 50 selling Canadian bands in Canada.<ref>{{cite website|url=https://bdsradio.com/pd/docs/Nielsen_Canadian150_2017_vs2.pdf|title=NIELSEN MUSIC & BILLBOARD PRESENT CANADA 150 CHARTS|website=bdsradio.com|p=28|accessdate=January 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nNeil Osborne and Brad Merritt met in 1978, at [[South Delta Secondary School|South Delta High School]] in [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawassen]], [[British Columbia]]. After studying at the [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]], Osborne returned home and formed the band 54-40 with Merritt and drummer Ian Franey. The band played their first gig in 1981 opening for [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]] at the Smilin' Buddha Cabaret in [[Vancouver]]. That same year, they made their first recordings for the [[Mo-Da-Mu]] label, with four tracks appearing on the independent compilation LP ''Things Are Still Coming Ashore'', which also featured music by Vancouver bands Animal Slaves and Junco Run. In June 1982, the band released the EP ''[[Selection (album)|Selection]]''. Shortly after the release of ''Selection'', Franey left the band. Franey was replaced by [[Darryl Neudorf]] and Phil Comparelli was added on guitar, trumpet and vocals. The band recorded the album ''[[Set the Fire]]'' in 1983, releasing it in 1984. In 1985, Neudorf, frustrated with the band's prolonged time in the studio and away from the road, left the band. He was replaced by Matt Johnson. \n\nThe band's [[54-40 (album)|self-titled second album]], released in 1986 through Warner/[[Reprise Records]], began to attract attention from radio and record buyers across Canada, with the singles \"Baby Ran\" and \"[[I Go Blind]]\" gaining significant college radio airplay. Dave Osborne (keyboards, harmonica), toured and recorded with the band from 1987 to 1993. The band's third album, ''[[Show Me (54-40 album)|Show Me]]'', became their commercial breakthrough in Canada, with the hits \"[[One Day in Your Life (54-40 song)|One Day in Your Life]]\" and \"One Gun\".\n\nAlthough the band was popular on [[college radio]] in the United States, they never had a commercial breakthrough, and Warner dropped 54-40 after the 1991 release of the compilation album, ''[[Sweeter Things: A Compilation|Sweeter Things]]''. The band signed a long-term deal with Sony and released ''[[Dear Dear]]'' in 1992. It was the band's first album to be certified Gold in Canada and was certified Platinum in 1993. The band  released ''[[Smilin' Buddha Cabaret]]'' in 1994 and ''[[Trusted by Millions]]'' in 1996, both of which would later be certified Platinum.\n\nThe band's song \"[[I Go Blind]]\" was covered in the mid-1990s by American band [[Hootie & the Blowfish]], and was featured on the first soundtrack to the TV series ''[[Friends]]''. The song also appears on two compilations released by the band: 2000's ''[[Scattered, Smothered and Covered]]'' and 2003's ''[[The Best of Hootie & the Blowfish: 1993\u20132003|The Best of Hootie & the Blowfish (1993 Thru 2003)]]''. Royalties from the Hootie and the Blowfish cover enabled the band to build their own recording studio in Vancouver.\n\n[[Dave Genn]], formerly of [[Matthew Good Band]], joined 54-40 in 2003. In February 2005, it was announced that Comparelli left the band due to personal reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2005/02/1702.cfm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306121832/http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2005/02/1702.cfm|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 6, 2006|title=54-40 Guitarist To Be Replaced By Former Matthew Good Ax-Man|publisher=[[Chart Attack]]|accessdate=February 10, 2019}}</ref> That same year, 54-40 signed with [[True North Records]].\n\nIn 2010, to celebrate the band's 30 years together and almost 25 years since their first commercial album ''[[54-40 (album)|The Green Album]]'', the band went on a promotional [[concert tour]] with a two-set act. The first set was \"[[54-40 (album)|The Green Album]]\" from start to finish. The second set was one song from every album since, with the exception of ''[[Dear Dear]]'' where they played two songs. 54-40 also performed a new song from their upcoming record, \"Lost In The City\", which was released on June 14, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://5440.com/index.php?view=article&catid=1:latest-news&id=71:5440-celebrates-30th-anniversary-by-going-qgreenq-again&tmpl=component&print=1&layout=default&page= |title=The Official Website of 54\u202240 \u2013 54\u202240 Canada's Band|website=5440.com|accessdate=January 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January, 2016, the band released a greatest hits album titled ''La Difference: A History Unplugged''. Tracks included \"[[One Day in Your Life (54-40 song)|One Day In Your Life]]\", \"[[I Go Blind]]\", and \"[[Ocean Pearl]]\". The album was released through [[eOne Music]]. The band then set out on a month-long theatre tour across Canada to support the album. In 2017 they played at Peachfest in Penticton.<ref>[https://www.pentictonwesternnews.com/entertainment/54-40-rocks-the-fest/ \"54-40 rocks the fest\"].

The band take their name from the [[slogan]] \"54-40 or Fight!\", coined to express the unsuccessful expansionist agenda of [[James K. Polk]]'s presidency, intent upon controlling a contested U.S.-Canada border area in the [[Oregon boundary dispute]]. 54-40 have had a successful career in their native Canada, with four of their albums being certified Platinum in the country. Between 1995 and 2016, 54-40 were among the top 150 selling Canadian artists in Canada and among the top 50 selling Canadian bands in Canada.<ref>{{cite website|url=https://bdsradio.com/pd/docs/Nielsen_Canadian150_2017_vs2.pdf|title=NIELSEN MUSIC & BILLBOARD PRESENT CANADA 150 CHARTS|website=bdsradio.com|p=28|accessdate=January 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nNeil Osborne and Brad Merritt met each other at [[South Delta Secondary School|South Delta High School]] in [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawassen]], [[British Columbia]] in 1978. After studying at the [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]], Osborne returned home and formed the band 54-40 with Merritt and drummer Ian Franey. The band played their first gig in 1981 opening for [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]] at the Smilin' Buddha Cabaret in [[Vancouver]]. That same year, they made their first recordings for the [[Mo-Da-Mu]] label, with four tracks appearing on the independent compilation LP ''Things Are Still Coming Ashore'', which also featured music by Vancouver bands Animal Slaves and Junco Run. In June 1982, the band released the EP ''[[Selection (album)|Selection]]''. Shortly after the release of ''Selection'', Franey left the band. Franey was replaced by [[Darryl Neudorf]] and Phil Comparelli was added on guitar, trumpet and vocals. The band recorded the album ''[[Set the Fire]]'' in 1983, releasing it in 1984. In 1985, Neudorf became frustrated from the band's prolonged time in the studio and away from the road and left the band. He was replaced by Matt Johnson that same year.\n\nThe band's [[54-40 (album)|self-titled second album]], released in 1986 through Warner/[[Reprise Records]], began to attract attention from radio and record buyers across Canada, with the singles \"Baby Ran\" and \"[[I Go Blind]]\" gaining significant college radio airplay. Musician Dave Osborne (keyboards, harmonica), toured and recorded with the band from 1987 to 1993. The band's third album, ''[[Show Me (54-40 album)|Show Me]]'', became their commercial breakthrough in Canada, with the hits \"[[One Day in Your Life (54-40 song)|One Day in Your Life]]\" and \"One Gun\".\n\nAlthough the band was popular on [[college radio]] in the United States, they never had a commercial breakthrough, and Warner dropped 54-40 after the release of the compilation album, ''[[Sweeter Things: A Compilation|Sweeter Things]]''. The band signed a long-term deal with Sony and released ''[[Dear Dear]]'' in 1992. It was the band's first album to be certified Gold in Canada and was certified Platinum in 1993. The band  released ''[[Smilin' Buddha Cabaret]]'' in 1994 and ''[[Trusted by Millions]]'' in 1996, both which would also later be certified Platinum.\n\nThe band's song \"[[I Go Blind]]\" was covered in the mid-1990s by American band [[Hootie & the Blowfish]], and was featured on the first soundtrack to the TV series ''[[Friends]]''. The song also appears on two compilations released by the band: 2000's ''[[Scattered, Smothered and Covered]]'' and 2003's ''[[The Best of Hootie & the Blowfish: 1993\u20132003|The Best of Hootie & the Blowfish (1993 Thru 2003)]]''. Royalties from the Hootie and the Blowfish cover enabled the band to build their own recording studio in Vancouver.\n\n[[Dave Genn]], formerly of [[Matthew Good Band]], joined 54-40 in 2003. In February 2005, it was announced that Comparelli left the band due to personal reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2005/02/1702.cfm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306121832/http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2005/02/1702.cfm|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 6, 2006|title=54-40 Guitarist To Be Replaced By Former Matthew Good Ax-Man|publisher=[[Chart Attack]]|accessdate=February 10, 2019}}</ref> That same year, 54-40 signed with [[True North Records]].\n\nIn 2010, to celebrate the band's 30 years together and almost 25 years since their first commercial album ''[[54-40 (album)|The Green Album]]'', the band went on a promotional [[concert tour]] with a two set act. The first set was \"[[54-40 (album)|The Green Album]]\" from start to finish. The second set was one song from every album since, with the exception of ''[[Dear Dear]]'' where they played two songs. 54-40 also performed a new song from their upcoming record, \"Lost In The City\", which was released on June 14, 2011. The Green tour was during the first few months of 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://5440.com/index.php?view=article&catid=1:latest-news&id=71:5440-celebrates-30th-anniversary-by-going-qgreenq-again&tmpl=component&print=1&layout=default&page= |title=The Official Website of 54\u202240 \u2013 54\u202240 Canada's Band|website=5440.com|accessdate=January 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January, 2016, the band released a \"greatest hits\" album titled ''La Difference: A History Unplugged''. Tracks included \"[[One Day in Your Life (54-40 song)|One Day In Your Life]]\", \"[[I Go Blind]]\", and \"[[Ocean Pearl]]\". The album was released through [[eOne Music]]. The band then set out on a month-long theatre tour across Canada to support the album. In 2017 they played at Peachfest in Penticton.<ref>[https://www.pentictonwesternnews.com/entertainment/54-40-rocks-the-fest/ \"54-40 rocks the fest\"].

The [[French First Republic|French Republic]] sought to capture Egypt as the first stage in an effort to threaten [[British India]] and support [[Tipu Sultan]], and thus force [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] to make peace. Departing [[Toulon]] in May 1798 with over 40,000 troops and hundreds of ships, Bonaparte's fleet sailed southeastwards across the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. They were followed by a small British squadron under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Horatio Nelson]], later reinforced to 13 [[ships of the line]], whose pursuit was hampered by a lack of scouting [[frigate]]s and reliable information. Bonaparte's first target was the island of [[Malta]], which was under the government of the [[Knights of St. John]] and theoretically granted its owner control of the Central Mediterranean. Bonaparte's forces landed on the island and rapidly overwhelmed the defenders, securing the port city of [[Valletta]] before continuing to Egypt. When Nelson learned of the French capture of the island, he guessed the French target to be Egypt and sailed for [[Alexandria]], but passed the French during the night of 22 June without discovering them and arrived off Egypt first.\n\nUnable to find Bonaparte, Nelson turned back across the Mediterranean, eventually reaching [[Sicily]] on 19 July. While Nelson was returning westwards, Bonaparte reached Alexandria and stormed the city, capturing the coast and marching his army inland. His fleet, entrusted to Vice-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers]], was anchored in a [[line of battle]] in [[Aboukir Bay]]. On 1 August, Nelson, who had returned to the Egyptian coast after reports gathered at [[Koroni|Coron]] revealed the French invasion, arrived off Aboukir Bay. Although it was late afternoon and the British fleet had no accurate charts of the bay, Nelson ordered an immediate attack on the French [[:wikt:vanguard|van]]. Brueys was unprepared, and his ships were unable to manoeuvre as the British split into two divisions and sailed down either side of the French line, capturing all five ships of the vanguard and engaging his 120-gun flagship [[French ship Orient (1791)|''Orient'']] in the centre. At 21:00, ''Orient'' caught fire and exploded, killing most of the crew and ending the main combat. Sporadic fighting continued for the next two days, until all of the French ships had been captured, destroyed or fled. At the [[Battle of the Nile]], eleven French ships of the line and two frigates were eliminated, trapping Bonaparte in Egypt and changing the balance of power in the Mediterranean.\n\nWith the French Navy in the Mediterranean defeated, other nations were encouraged to join the [[Second Coalition]] and go to war with France. [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] all subsequently deployed forces to the Mediterranean. The Russians and Turks participated in the blockade of Egypt and operations in the [[Adriatic Sea]] while the Portuguese joined the [[Siege of Malta (1798-1800)|Siege of Malta]], which was distantly conducted by Nelson from his lodgings in [[Naples]]. Nelson, who had been wounded at the Battle of the Nile, became involved in Neapolitan politics and encouraged [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand]] to go to war with France, resulting in the loss of his mainland kingdom. In the Western Mediterranean, Vice-Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Earl St Vincent]], who commanded the Mediterranean fleet from off [[Cadiz]], deployed forces against [[Menorca]], rapidly captured the island and turned it into an important naval base.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Bonaparte's plan===\nAt the beginning of 1798, the [[War of the First Coalition]] had come to an end with French control of Northern Italy, much of the [[Low Countries]] and the [[Rhineland]] confirmed by the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]].<ref name=\"DC78\">Chandler, p. 78</ref> Of all the major European powers that had at one time allied against the [[First French Republic|French Republic]], only the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] remained hostile, and the [[French Directory]] determined to end the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] by eliminating Britain. A series of invasions of the [[British Isles]] were planned,<ref name=\"DC185\">Come, p. 185</ref> and the 28-year-old General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who had defeated the Austrians in Italy the previous year, was assigned to lead the ''Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre'' (Army of England) that had been assembled at [[Boulogne]].<ref name=\"WJ113\">James, p. 113</ref> However, the [[English Channel]] was firmly controlled by the [[Royal Navy]] and French invasion supplies, particularly of viable [[landing craft]], were totally inadequate for the purpose.<ref name=\"RG107\">Gardiner, p. 107</ref>\n\nIn the early spring of 1798, Bonaparte left his command at Boulogne and returned to Paris, reporting that continued British naval supremacy in Northern European waters made an invasion impossible in the near future.<ref name=\"NM248\">Mostert, p. 248</ref> With operations to the north impossible, Bonaparte directed his attention southwards to [[Toulon]], the principal French seaport on the [[Mediterranean]]. There a French army and fleet had begun assembling for a secret location, speculated by French commentators to be aimed at a wide variety of places, including among others Britain, [[Sicily]], Malta and the [[Crimea]].<ref name=\"JC3\">Cole, p. 3</ref><ref name=\"SM230\">Maffeo, p. 230</ref> The expedition's intended target was actually [[Egypt]], which formed an important link in the chain of communications between Britain and the economically vital colony of [[British India]].<ref name=\"RLA7\">Adkins, p. 7</ref> Bonaparte considered the capture of Egypt as the most important step in neutralising the massive economic benefits that Britain gained from trade with India and bringing Britain to terms: in August 1797 he wrote \"The time is not far away that we will feel that, in order to truly destroy England, we must take Egypt.\"<ref name=\"JC14\">Cole, p. 13</ref> Possession of Egypt could grant the French control of the Eastern Mediterranean and the [[Red Sea]], forcing severe delays to dispatches sent between Britain and India and obstructing trade worth \u00a32.7 million (the equivalent of \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|2700000|1798|r=-7}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) to the British economy.{{Inflation-fn|UK}}<ref name=\"SM227\">Maffeo, p. 227</ref> In addition, a successful invasion of Egypt could be followed by a direct attack on British territory in India, possibly in conjunction with the anglophobic [[Tippoo Sultan]] of [[Seringapatam]].<ref name=\"OW41\">Warner, p. 41</ref> The French Mediterranean Fleet was unopposed at the start of 1798 \u2013 following the [[Second Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]] in 1796, in which Spain formed an alliance with France and declared war on Britain, the Royal Navy had withdrawn from the Mediterranean bases of [[Corsica]] and [[Elba]].<ref name=\"JHR140\">Rose, p. 140</ref> By early 1798, their Mediterranean Fleet was based at the [[Tagus River]] in Portugal, their one remaining continental ally.<ref name=\"SM224\">Maffeo, p. 224</ref> With no permanent British fleet in the Mediterranean and [[Irish rebellion of 1798|an uprising]] imminent in Ireland, Bonaparte firmly believed that the Royal Navy would be unable to intervene in his plans, even if they should discover them.<ref name=\"JHR141\">Rose, p. 141</ref>\n\nWith passage to Egypt seemingly unopposed Bonaparte gave orders for a fleet of thirteen [[ships of the line]], led by the 120-gun [[French ship Orient|''Orient'']] under Vice-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers]] and numerous smaller warships, including the entire Venetian Navy, captured the previous year, to prepare for sea.<ref name=\"RG20\">Gardiner, p. 20</ref> The fleet was to be accompanied by up to 400 [[transport ship]]s, which were to carry the 35,000 men detailed for the invasion.<ref name=\"WLC353\">Clowes, p. 353</ref>  On 3 May, Bonaparte departed Paris, arriving at Toulon five days later to oversee the final preparations. On 9 May he reviewed the assembled army and gave a speech announcing that the expedition was bound for an unspecified foreign land. The speech was met with an enthusiastic response from his soldiers and a revised version subsequently appeared in ''[[Le Moniteur Universel]]'' and was widely distributed throughout France as a poster.<ref name=\"JC5\">Cole, p. 5</ref>  Despite Bonaparte's pronouncement the French departure was delayed: a strong headwind prevented the fleet from sailing for another nine days, conditions finally lifting on 18 May that permitted the 22 warships and 120 transports that made up the French fleet to sail the following day.<ref name=\"WJ150\">James, p. 150</ref>\n\n===St. Vincent's response===\n[[File:HoratioNelson1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson'', [[Lemuel Francis Abbott]], 1800, [[National Maritime Museum]]|alt=Portrait of a man in an ornate naval uniform festooned with medals and awards.]]\nBritain was not unaware of French preparations at Toulon and along the Mediterranean coast, but despite sustained efforts by British agents in France the destination of the French fleet was unknown.<ref name=\"RLA8\">Adkins, p. 8</ref> Egypt was not seriously considered by the British government: when [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Henry Dundas]] suggested it, he was urged by [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville]] to think \"with a map in your hand, and with a calculation of distances.\"<ref name=\"NR458\">Rodger, p. 458</ref> Letters reached London and St. Vincent at the Tagus describing extensive preparations right along the French and Italian Mediterranean coastlines, but the distances between the base in the Tagus and Toulon prevented any sustained observation of French movements.<ref name=\"SM234\">Maffeo, p. 234</ref> Urgent orders were sent from [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Lord Spencer]] at the [[Admiralty]] to Vice-Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Earl St. Vincent]], commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet at the Tagus, to despatch a squadron to investigate under the command of Rear-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson|Sir Horatio Nelson]]. Nelson had returned to the fleet three days earlier at Lord Spencer's order,<ref name=\"EB169\">Bradford, p. 169</ref> following recovery in Britain from the loss of an arm at the [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] in July 1797.<ref name=\"RG18\">Gardiner, p. 18</ref>\n\nSt. Vincent had already been preparing for an expedition to Toulon with Nelson in mind, and the rear-admiral departed the Tagus in his flagship [[HMS Vanguard (1787)|HMS ''Vanguard'']] on 2 May. St Vincent was overjoyed to be able to place Nelson in command of the mission, writing that \"the arrival of Admiral Nelson has given me new life ... his presence in the Mediterranean is so very essential\".<ref name=\"EB170\">Bradford, p. 170</ref> His preference for Nelson over the more senior admirals [[Sir William Parker, 1st Baronet, of Harburn|Sir William Parker]] and [[Sir John Orde, 1st Baronet|Sir John Orde]] provoked a storm of protest, which eventually culminated in Orde challenging St Vincent to a duel,<ref name=\"NM255\">Mostert, p. 255</ref> and being subsequently ordered to return to Britain.<ref name=\"OW45\">Warner, p. 45</ref> On 9 May Nelson collected the ships of the line [[HMS Alexander (1778)|HMS ''Alexander'']] and [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']] under Captains [[Alexander John Ball|Alexander Ball]] and [[James Saumarez|Sir James Saumarez]] the frigates [[HMS Emerald (1795)|HMS ''Emerald'']] and [[HMS Terpsichore (1785)|HMS ''Terpsichore'']] under Captains [[Thomas Moutray Waller]] and [[William Hall Gage]] and the [[sloop]] [[HMS Bonne Citoyenne|HMS ''Bonne Citoyenne'']] under Captain [[Robert Retalick]] at [[Gibraltar]], and passed into the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"WLC351\">Clowes, p. 351</ref> Despite leaving under cover of darkness,<ref name=\"EB172\">Bradford, p. 172</ref> Nelson's departure was observed by Spanish forces at Cadiz, and the fort at Cape Carnero fired several shot, striking ''Alexander'' but inflicting negligible damage.<ref name=\"JK41\">Keegan, p. 41</ref>\n\nOn 17 May ''Terpsichore'' captured the [[privateer]] ''La Pierre'' off [[Cape Sici\u00e9]], and from the crew Nelson learned that Bonaparte's departure was imminent, although the destination was still unknown.<ref name=\"SM239\">Maffeo, p. 239</ref> On 21 May, as his squadron reached the [[\u00celes d'Hy\u00e8res]] near Toulon, they were struck by strong winds that snapped ''Vanguard''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s topmasts and brought the wreckage down onto the deck, killing two men.<ref name=\"JK41\"/> ''Vanguard'' was left struggling in heavy seas, blown {{convert|75|nmi|km}} southwards in one night.<ref name=\"EB173\">Bradford, p. 173</ref> So severe was the damage that ''Vanguard'' was almost wrecked on the Corsican coast on the following day and Nelson even ordered Captain Ball, who had managed to attach a towline to the flagship, to abandon him.<ref name=\"PP112\">Padfield, p. 112</ref> Ball refused the order and the British ships of the line rode out the storm together.<ref name=\"NM250\">Mostert, p. 250</ref> Although ''Alexander'' was able to tow ''Vanguard'' to [[San Pietro Island]] off [[Sardinia]] for repairs, the gale had forced the squadron's frigates to separate from the larger ships.<ref name=\"PP113\">Padfield, p. 113</ref>\n\nThomas Waller on ''Emerald'' was divided from the other frigates, and his lookouts had observed ''Vanguard'' in its dismasted state at the height of the storm. The other two frigates had reefed their sails and ridden out the storm together, Captain Gage turning towards the Spanish coast when the storm abated and on 29 May encountered [[HMS Alcmene (1794)|HMS ''Alcmene'']] under Captain [[George Johnstone Hope]], which had been sent by St. Vincent to augment Nelson's force. Two days later Hope's squadron encountered ''Emerald'', which had captured two merchant ships, and together they sailed for the prearranged rendezvous point {{convert|60|mi|km}} off Cape St. Sebastian near [[Barcelona]].<ref name=\"JK45\">Keegan, p. 45</ref> Hope ordered ''Terpsichore'' and ''Bonne Citoyenne'' to cruise off Sardinia and on 3 June encountered the brig [[HMS Mutine (1797)|HMS ''Mutine'']] under Captain [[Thomas Masterman Hardy|Thomas Hardy]], the scout of a fleet sent by Earl St. Vincent that was approaching the rendezvous. Knowing of the damaged suffered by ''Vanguard'' and aware that the French had left Toulon, Hope then took the unilateral decision to search for the French himself, dispersing the frigates across the Western Mediterranean.<ref name=\"JK47\">Keegan, p. 47</ref> Hope's ships failed to find either the British or French fleets and none of the frigates returned to Nelson's command until after the Battle of the Nile.<ref name=\"SM241\">Maffeo, p. 241</ref>\n\n==Malta==\n[[File:Nap malta.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's arrival in Malta]]\nDeparting Toulon on 19 May, Bonaparte's fleet passed along the coast of [[Provence]] to [[Genoa]], where 72 additional transport ships were collected.<ref name=\"JK40\">Keegan, p. 40</ref> Sailing south, the fleet reached Corsica on 23 May and collected a fleet of 22 transports from [[Ajaccio]] on 28 May.<ref name=\"RLA11\">Adkins, p. 11</ref> The convoy remained within sight of the eastern coastline until 30 May, crossing the [[Strait of Bonifacio]] and following the coastline of [[Sardinia]] in anticipation of combining with fleets of transports sailing from [[Civitavecchia]].<ref name=\"WLC353\"/> On 3 June, a message reached Bonaparte reporting the presence of Nelson's squadron at San Pietro and the French general sent a French squadron to investigate, although by that time Nelson had sailed and the harbour was empty.<ref name=\"WJ150\"/> Abandoning the wait for the Civitavecchia force, which had still not arrived, Bonaparte gave orders for his fleet to turn southeast, passing [[Mazara]] on Sicily and the island of [[Pantelleria]] on 7 June. There a report from a captured British merchant brig warned Bonaparte that Nelson was only a short distance behind his force with a powerful Royal Navy fleet and, concerned for his transports, Bonaparte gave urgent orders for the French fleet to steer for Malta, arriving off [[Valletta]] at 05:30 on 9 June, shortly after uniting with the 56 ships of the Civitavecchia convoy, which had missed the rendezvous and continued to Malta alone.<ref name=\"WJ150\"/><ref name=\"SM259\">Maffeo, p. 259</ref>\n\nThe report on Nelson's activity submitted to Bonaparte on 7 June was inaccurate: Repairs to ''Vanguard'' in San Pietro took six days, the squadron sailing on 27 May for Toulon, arriving off the harbour on 31 May.<ref name=\"WLC354\">Clowes, p. 354</ref>{{Cref2|Note A}} Nelson had already learned of the departure of the French fleet from a captured [[Marseilles]] merchant ship, but without reinforcements or knowledge of the French direction he could not begin a pursuit.<ref name=\"JK44\">Keegan, p. 44</ref> On 5 June, the brig HMS ''Mutine'' arrived off Toulon and reported that a British fleet was only a few days away, consisting of ten ships of the line and a [[fourth rate]] sent by Earl St Vincent from the Tagus on 24 May under Captain [[Sir Thomas Troubridge, 1st Baronet|Thomas Troubridge]] in [[HMS Culloden (1783)|HMS ''Culloden'']].<ref name=\"WJ152\">James, p. 152</ref> St Vincent, acting under urgent orders from London to send a fleet to the Mediterranean had opted to split his forces, rather than risk taking all of his ships into the Mediterranean and leaving the Spanish at Cadiz unattended. Troubridge was considered by St Vincent to be the best officer in the fleet, and Nelson, who also held a high opinion of Troubridge, immediately sailed his squadron to the scheduled rendezvous point.<ref name=\"EB175\">Bradford, p. 175</ref> On 6 June, his squadron briefly intercepted a Spanish merchant convoy and capturing two ships before the admiral called off the pursuit to ensure he arrived at the agreed time. On 7 June at 12:00 the fleets combined, Nelson now commanding 13 74-gun ships of the line, one 50-gun ship and one brig.<ref name=\"SM243\">Maffeo, p. 243</ref> Noticeable by their absence were frigates, vital for scouting operations in a campaign of this nature; After his encounter with Hope, Hardy reported to Nelson that the frigates were cruising independently, to which the admiral bitterly responded \"I had thought that Hope would have known me better\".<ref name=\"NM251\">Mostert, p. 251</ref>\n\n===Nelson's search===\nDelayed until 10 June by a calm and still unaware of French intentions, Nelson initially sailed along the Corsican coast, before anchoring at Elba on 12 June and sending ''Mutine'' into Civitavecchia for information. Hardy was unable to discover the French destination and, after a detour to Elba with his whole fleet, Nelson continued south.<ref name=\"JK48\">Keegan, p. 48</ref> Two days later, the admiral spoke with a Tunisian ship at [[Giannutri]], which passed on the inaccurate information that the French had been seen off [[Trapani]],<ref name=\"NM253\">Mostert, p. 253</ref> and might be anchored at [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].<ref name=\"WLC355\">Clowes, p. 355</ref> On 17 June Nelson anchored at the [[Pontine Islands]] off [[Naples]] and sent Troubridge ashore to appeal to the British ambassador [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]] for information and for the assistance of the Neapolitan Navy in scouting for the French. Although the Neapolitan Prime Minister [[Sir John Acton, 6th Baronet|Sir John Acton]] had already passed on reports that the French were sailing for Egypt, Hamilton did not give the report to Nelson, possibly suspicious of [[disinformation]].<ref name=\"JK50\">Keegan, p. 50</ref> Hamilton did however relay the information that Bonaparte's fleet had passed Sardinia and were probably sailing in the direction of Malta. Despite private animosity towards France,<ref name=\"OW55\">Warner, p. 55</ref> the Neapolitan government refused to openly join the British in the war and denied Nelson the use of their frigates,<ref name=\"EB176\">Bradford, p. 176</ref> although they did quietly agree to resupply Nelson's fleet.<ref name=\"NM253\"/> With a rough direction established and believing the ultimate French destination to be Sicily,<ref name=\"EB177\">Bradford, p. 177</ref> Nelson sailed in pursuit, but light winds hampered his advances and he did not pass the [[Straits of Messina]] until 20 June. There he received a report from the ambassador at [[Messina]] that the French were at Malta.<ref name=\"NM254\"/> Then on 22 June near [[Cape Passaro]], Hardy stopped a Genoese ship from [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]] that reported seeing the French fleet sailing southwards away from Malta, and that they had left Valletta on 16 June.<ref name=\"RG29\">Gardiner, p. 29</ref> This information was wrong (or mistranslated) in one important respect: although preparations had begun on 16 June the French had actually not departed until 19 June,<ref name=\"EB181\">Bradford, p. 181</ref> and Nelson's fleet was just {{convert|60|nmi|km}} away from Brueys'.<ref name=\"NR459\">Rodger, p. 459</ref> Nelson decided that the French target must be Egypt or [[Constantinople]] and called his senior captains: Saumarez, Ball, Troubridge and [[Henry D'Esterre Darby|Henry Darby]] on board ''Vanguard'' for a conference.<ref name=\"NM254\"/> Together these officers determined Egypt as the most likely option, deducing that it was the best location in the Mediterranean from which Bonaparte could threaten India.<ref name=\"PP114\">Padfield, p. 114</ref> Consequently, Nelson turned southeast towards [[Alexandria]], exercising his men's gunnery daily to ensure they were ready for the battle he planned.<ref name=\"WJ154\"/> His plan should his force encounter the French was clear: dividing into three squadrons, his fleet would strike the French at three points. Two squadrons of five ships each would engage the French fleet directly while the third would separate and attack the transports, sinking or capturing as many as possible.<ref name=\"WJ153\">James, p. 153</ref> Nelson also deliberately forged close links with his captains at regular dinners aboard his flagship to ensure ease of communication and build confidence between them.

Arriving off Malta on 9 June, he demanded that the island's ruler, [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]], the [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] (or Knights of St. John of Jerusalem) to allow his fleet to enter the harbour and purchase provisions.<ref name=\"JC8\">Cole, p. 8</ref>  Hompesch refused, insisting that only two ships at a time could enter the port. Bonaparte responded by opening fire on the harbour defences and on 11 June landed soldiers at seven sites around Malta under General [[Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers]]. Coming under fire from the 2,000 native Maltese soldiers that mustered against the invasion, skirmishing continued in the western part of the island for 24 hours, until General [[Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois]] entered [[Mdina]] and the defenders withdrew to the [[Fortifications of Valletta|fortress of Valletta]].<ref name=\"JC9\">Cole, p. 9</ref> The Maltese troops refused to continue the fight without support from their government,<ref name=\"OW29\">Warner, p. 29</ref> and negotiations followed in which Hompesch and the knights agreed to abandon Malta on condition of financial compensation amounting to 3 million [[Francs]].<ref name=\"JC10\"/> In exchange, Bonaparte gained the entire Maltese archipelago, including fortresses, military stores and cannon, the small Maltese Navy and Army and the entire property of the Roman Catholic Church in Malta.<ref name=\"RG21\">Gardiner, p. 21</ref>\n\nThe Maltese position had already been severely weakened by the large number of Frenchmen who were part of the Order, who refused ''en masse'' to take up arms against Bonaparte. The [[French Revolution]] had already significantly reduced the Knights' income and their ability to put up serious resistance to Bonaparte was seriously compromised by a lack of resources.<ref name=\"JC10\">Cole, p. 10</ref> On 12 June, Bonaparte finally announced to his troops the destination of the expedition and on 19 June he sailed for Alexandria, initially steering east towards [[Crete]]. He left behind Vaubois and 4,000 men to maintain Malta as a base to control the Central Mediterranean.<ref name=\"RLA13\">Adkins, p. 13</ref> To ensure that news of the impending attack on Egypt did not spread ahead of the fleet, Brueys ordered that any merchant ships that sighted the convoy during the passage were to be seized and detained until his force had reached Alexandria.<ref name=\"SM256\">Maffeo, p. 256</ref> On 26 June, the British gained the first firm intelligence of French intentions, when the frigate [[HMS Seahorse (1794)|HMS ''Seahorse'']] under Captain [[Edward Foote]] [[Action of 27 June 1798|encountered and captured]] the French frigate [[French frigate Sensible (1788)|''Sensible'']], which was returning to Toulon from Malta with a cargo of treasure and wounded soldiers, including General d'Hilliers.<ref name=\"WJ208\">James, p. 208</ref> From these prisoners the destination of the French fleet was discovered and ''Seahorse'', joined shortly afterwards by ''Terpsichore'', sailed in pursuit, hoping to encounter Nelson.<ref name=\"WJ160\">James, p. 160</ref>\n\n==Arrivals at Alexandria==\nNelson's passage from Sicily to Alexandria was uneventful, the journey taking six days. Due to his lack of frigates, Nelson was unable to scout to the flanks of his advance and as a result only spoke with three merchant ships, none of which had useful information about the French fleet.<ref name=\"WJ154\">James, p. 154</ref> The lack of frigates had already had a decisive effect on 22 June, when the British fleet sighted four sails to the southeast.<ref name=\"NM254\">Mostert, p. 254</ref> Although Captain [[Sir Thomas Thompson, 1st Baronet|Thomas Thompson]] of [[HMS Leander (1780)|HMS ''Leander'']] requested permission to investigate the strangers, Nelson refused and ordered his fleet to continue on their current heading, believing the French to be five days ahead and wishing to reach Alexandria as rapidly as possible.<ref name=\"JK56\">Keegan, p. 56</ref> Had British frigates been available to approach and investigate the distant squadron, they might have discovered that they were scouts for the main French fleet, which was only a short distance away.<ref name=\"RLA14\">Adkins, p. 14</ref> The French frigate had sighted the British fleet and reported its presence to Bonaparte, who adjusted his convoy's direction slightly to a more northerly trajectory.<ref name=\"EB182\">Bradford, p. 182</ref> As a result, Nelson's fleet passed north of the French to the east of Malta during the night in a heavy mist. Although Nelson was so close that his signal guns could be heard aboard ''Orient'', his lookouts did not observe the French ships and the British fleet continued ahead without deviating.<ref name=\"SM258\">Maffeo, p. 258</ref> When dawn broke the following day, Bonaparte's diversion to the northeast had taken his convoy out of sight of the British fleet, which continued to the southeast undisturbed.<ref name=\"EB185\">Bradford, p. 185</ref> On 28 June, ''Mutine''  arrived at Alexandria ahead of Nelson's fleet, and discovered that the French fleet was not in the harbour.<ref name=\"OW58\">Warner, p. 58</ref> Once the main fleet had arrived, attempts were made to contact the British Consul [[George Baldwin (diplomat)|George Baldwin]], but these failed as he had been dismissed by the British government shortly before and had left the city.<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{cite journal |last= Mew|first=James |month= |title=Baldwin, George |journal=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |id= |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1165|accessdate=26 November 2009 |quote= }}</ref> As a result, official diplomatic channels were closed to Nelson.<ref name=\"EB188\">Bradford, p. 188</ref> A message warning of the French approach was carried to the Ottoman governor Sayyid Muhammad Kurayyim by Hardy in ''Mutine''.

Soldiers were landed in the region of the Mirabou Creek, although the appearance of a sail to the east was mistaken for a scout from the British fleet and caused momentary panic, Bonaparte reportedly exclaiming: ''\"Fortune, m'abandonnerais-tu? Quoi! Seulement cinq jours!\"'' (Fortune, wilt thou abandon me? What! Only five days!). The newcomer was eventually revealed to be the French frigate ''[[French frigate Justice (1794)|Justice]]'' sent from Malta, and the invasion continued unopposed.<ref name=\"WJ156\">James, p. 156</ref> By evening the landing had been completed, although several boats had been wrecked in the surf and Bonaparte himself estimated that at least 20 men had drowned.<ref name=\"RLA17\">Adkins, p. 17</ref>\n\nOn 2 July, Bonaparte led his men to victory in the brief [[Battle of Alexandria (1798)|Battle of Alexandria]] and secured the city. He placed General [[Jean Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber]] in command with Rear-Admiral [[Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley]] in charge of the harbour.<ref name=\"WJ156\"/> Finding that entrances to the anchorage were too shallow to accommodate the main body of the French fleet, Bonaparte ordered Brueys to sail his squadron to the wider [[Aboukir Bay]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} northeast of Alexandria. Brueys was instructed that if he considered the anchorage to be unsafe then he was to sail for Corfu, leaving only a small light force that could anchor comfortably in Alexandria.<ref name=\"NM257\">Mostert, p. 257</ref> There Brueys held a conference with his officers to decide on their response should Nelson discover them in the bay. Although Rear-Admiral [[Armand Blanquet du Chayla|Armand Blanquet]] of [[French ship Franklin (1797)|''Franklin'']] argued that the fleet was safest sailing out to meet the British, he was outvoted and overruled, Brueys ordering that the ships remain anchored in [[line of battle]] to receive the British attack.<ref name=\"WJ159\">James, p. 159</ref> On 21 July, the frigates ''Seahorse'' and ''Terpsichore'' arrived at Alexandria and observed the French dispositions while flying [[French tricolour|French colours]] to confuse observers from the shore. With no sign of Nelson, Foote and Hall turned back westwards in search of the admiral.<ref name=\"WJ160\"/> When Brueys learned that British frigates had been seen off the Egyptian coast, he decided that the retreat of these vessels signified that there was no danger of imminent attack by a British force and therefore failed to take precautions against attack.<ref name=\"OW65\">Warner, p. 65</ref>\n\n===Nelson returns===\nNelson, having sailed northeast on the same day that the first French ships arrived off Alexandria, had reached [[Anatolia]] on 4 July and turned westward against the wind, sailing for Sicily again.<ref name=\"EB192\">Bradford, p. 192</ref>  His ships were briefly scattered by a storm on 5 July, before reconstituting the following day and on 18 July the British fleet reached Cape Passaro again and on 19 July Nelson's force anchored in Syracuse to take on fresh provisions supplied in part by [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]], the wife of the ambassador to Naples.<ref name=\"WLC355\"/> Frustrated, Nelson wrote in a letter to his wife [[Frances Nelson|Fanny]]; \"Every moment I have to regret the frigates having left me, to which must be attributed my ignorance of the movements of the enemy.\"<ref name=\"NM258\">Mostert, p. 258</ref> Reports subsequently reached the British fleet at Syracuse that the French had not been seen in the Eastern Mediterranean, in the [[Adriatic]] or in the [[Aegean Sea]], leaving either Egypt or Syria as the only likely destinations.<ref name=\"EB195\">Bradford, p. 195</ref>  Sailing once more on 25 July, Nelson turned his ships east once again sailing for Morea and sending Troubridge in ''Culloden'' into [[Koroni|Coron]] on 28 July for news.<ref name=\"SM266\">Maffeo, p. 266</ref> The Ottoman governor reported that the French had been seen sailing southwards from Crete at the start of the month and presented Troubridge with a French merchant ship that was anchored in the harbour.<ref name=\"OW62\">Warner, p. 62</ref> With their first definite sighting of the French, the British fleet turned southwards towards Alexandria.<ref name=\"RG30\">Gardiner, p. 30</ref>\n\n==Battle of the Nile==\n{{dablink|For more details on this topic, see [[Battle of the Nile]].}}\nOn 1 August, Nelson's fleet reached the Egyptian coast, the ships [[HMS Swiftsure (1787)|HMS ''Swiftsure'']] and [[HMS Alexander (1778)|HMS ''Alexander'']] detached as scouts to investigate Alexandria harbour.

He consequently placed his strongest ships at these points, planning to stall the British fleet while his [[:wikt:vanguard|van]] used the prevailing northeasterly wind to counterattack.<ref name=\"PP120\">Padfield, p. 120</ref> Brueys was also confident that the British fleet, strung out and with nightfall approaching, would not attack that day. He believed that Nelson would anchor off the bay and attack in the morning, giving Brueys time to prepare and leaving open the option of simply sailing away during the night, following Bonaparte's orders to avoid a direct confrontation with the British fleet.<ref name=\"WJ161\">James, p. 161</ref>\n\n===Nelson's attack===\n[[File:Battle of the Nile, Whitcombe2.jpg|thumb|300px|''Battle of the Nile, Augt 1st 1798'', [[Thomas Whitcombe]], 1816.

Rather than place his lead ship ''Guerrier'' close to the northern shoal, the French admiral had left a gap, widened by the order for the French fleet to only anchor by the bow which meant that they drifted significantly, between ''Guerrier'' and the shoals.<ref name=\"RLA24\"/> Sailing directly through this gap, Foley [[raking fire|raked]] ''Guerrier'' and engaged the second ship of the French line, ''Conqu\u00e9rant''.<ref name=\"NM266\">Mostert, p. 266</ref> ''Zealous'' also passed through the gap and attacked ''Guerrier'', and was followed by [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']], [[HMS Theseus (1786)|HMS ''Theseus'']] and [[HMS Audacious (1785)|HMS ''Audacious'']], all of which opened up a fierce fire on the first four French ships against their unprepared [[port (nautical)|port]] sides.<ref name=\"WJ165\">James, p. 165</ref>\n\nNelson followed in ''Vanguard'', bringing the next two ships into action with the [[starboard]] side of the French van, catching the French ships in a crossfire that rapidly battered and dismasted the ships, despite determined defence.<ref name=\"WLC362\">Clowes, p. 362</ref> As the French van was destroyed, [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']] and [[HMS Majestic (1785)|HMS ''Majestic'']] attacked the French centre.

Nine of eleven ships of the line had been captured or destroyed, as well as two frigates.<ref name=\"NM272\"/> French casualties totalled more than 3,000 and possibly as many as 5,000, compared to British losses of 218 killed and 677 wounded.<ref name=\"WLC370\">Clowes, p. 370</ref> However, many of Nelson's ships were seriously damaged, and urgent repairs were required for both his own ships and the captured prizes before they could begin the long voyage back to Britain. For more than two weeks Nelson remained in Aboukir Bay, effecting repairs, writing despatches and assessing the strategic situation in Egypt.<ref name=\"SM273\">Maffeo, p. 273</ref> The first ship detached from his squadron was ''Leander'', sent on 5 August to the fleet under Earl St. Vincent off [[Cadiz]] with reports of the battle.<ref name=\"WJ182\">James, p. 182</ref> On 8 August Aboukir Island was stormed and captured, and on 12 August ''Emerald'', ''Alcmene'' and ''Bonne Citoyenne'' finally caught up with the fleet, followed on 17 August by ''Seahorse'' and ''Terpsichore''.<ref name=\"WLC373\"/> ''Mutine'' was detached on 13 August with despatches for the Admiralty and on 14 August Nelson sent seven ships with the six seaworthy prizes to the mouth of Aboukir Bay under the command of Saumarez.<ref name=\"WJ183\">James, p. 183</ref> This convoy sailed for Gibraltar on 15 August and the following day Nelson burnt ''Heureux'', followed on 18 August by ''Mercure'' and ''Guerrier'', none of which were fit for continued service. On 19 August Nelson separated his remaining ships, leading three vessels northwards towards Naples and leaving a [[blockade]] squadron off Alexandria of ''Zealous'', ''Goliath'', ''Swiftsure'' and the frigates, under Captain [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Samuel Hood]].<ref name=\"WLC373\">Clowes, p. 373</ref>\n\nBy the time Nelson departed Alexandria, his first set of dispatches were already in French hands. ''Leander'' had been discovered off the western coast of [[Crete]] [[Action of 18 August 1798|on 18 August 1798]] by the French ship of the line [[French ship Le G\u00e9n\u00e9reux|''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'']], one of Villeneuve's escapees.<ref name=RG43>Gardiner, p. 43</ref> After separating from Villeneuve's squadron on 17 August, ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'' was sailing to Corfu when it encountered the British fourth rate. The larger French ship soon overtook the British vessel and a heated exchange followed: French efforts to board ''Leander'' were driven back with heavy casualties, and Captain Thompson at one stage successfully raked his opponent, but gradually the heavier weight of ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'' inflicted severe damage to the British ship and after six and a half hours Thompson was forced to surrender.<ref name=\"WJ232\">James, p. 232</ref> French captain [[Louis-Jean-Nicolas Lejoille|Lejoille]] then authorised widespread looting of the personal effects of the British crew, whom he also forced to conduct repairs on both ships, an act against the established conventions of naval warfare.<ref name=\"WLC516\">Clowes, p. 516</ref> The prize was towed to Corfu for repairs, the two battered vessels briefly encountering ''Mutine'', which escaped to the westwards before ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'' could give chase. In captivity Lejoille continued to refuse to allow the British officers medical attention or return their stolen property.<ref name=\"WJ235\">James, p. 235</ref> Eventually returned to Britain, Thompson and Berry were [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] and heavily praised for their defence of their ship against heavy odds, while Lejoille was also commended for his success, assisted by his incorrect account of the battle published in French newspapers.<ref name=\"WJ237\">James, p. 237</ref>\n\n===Alexandria===\nWith the French naval presence in the Mediterranean reduced to a few scattered vessels, the allies of the [[Second Coalition]] were able to exert their dominance in the region. Off Alexandria, the squadron under Captain Hood successfully prevented communications between France and the French army in Egypt.<ref name=\"WJ191\">James, p. 191</ref> On 22 August, just three days after Nelson sailed north, ''Alcmene'' intercepted the 6-gun dispatch vessel ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' off Alexandria harbour and forced the captain to surrender. As his flag was struck, the captain hurled the dispatches into the sea. This action was witnessed by sailors [[John Taylor (RN hero)|John Taylor]] and John Harding aboard ''Alcmene'' and both men dived into the water, successfully retrieving the messages.<ref name=guelphmercury2018-01-01/><ref name=guelphhistoricalsociety/><ref name=TorontoOldAndNew/><ref name=\"WLC376\">Clowes, p. 376</ref> For their bravery in diving from a rapidly moving ship into unknown waters, both men were granted annual pensions of \u00a320 (the equivalent of \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|20|1798|r=-2}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}} Three days after the capture of ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'', Captain Foley of ''Goliath'' sent a boat into the sheltered anchorage under Aboukir Castle, where his men boarded and captured the armed [[ketch]] [[French gun-vessel Torride (1797)|''Torride'']], typical of the gun-vessels that had fired on the British advance during the Battle of the Nile.<ref name=\"WJ192\">James, p. 192</ref> On 2 September, another dispatch vessel reached the Egyptian coast, the 4-gun [[cutter (ship)|cutter]] ''An\u00e9mone'' carrying General Camin and 60 men from Malta.<ref name=\"WLC376\"/> ''Swiftsure'' and ''Emerald'' managed to cut off the vessel from Alexandria harbour and drive it ashore near the town of Marabou. Although the cutter swiftly broke up in the surf, most of the men aboard managed to scramble ashore. There, while the British ships lay off shore unable to intervene, [[Bedouin]] [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] discovered the survivors and massacred them, dragging the few survivors inland before French cavalry could rescue them.<ref name=\"WJ193\">James, p. 193</ref> The only survivors were rescued by Lieutenant [[Francis William Fane]], who swam to shore with an empty barrel attached to a rope. Despite coming under fire from the French on the beach, he was able to save five men from the Bedouin attack.<ref name=\"WLC376\"/>\n\nIn October the small British squadron at Alexandria was briefly reinforced by a Portuguese squadron of four ships of the line and the 64-gun [[HMS Lion (1777)|HMS ''Lion'']] under Captain [[Manley Dixon]], although the Portuguese sailed for Malta after only a few days.<ref name=\"WJ193\"/> On 19 October the squadron was joined by two Turkish [[corvette]]s, two Russian frigates and 16 small Turkish gunboats, arranged by Hood on a visit to [[Rhodes]] in ''Swiftsure'' the week before.<ref name=\"WJ194\">James, p. 194</ref> The gunboats were subsequently used to bombard Aboukir Castle and a French encampment at Lake Maadie on 25 October, although results were negligible. After the first day the Turkish crews were replaced with British sailors, but except for a complaint from the French that \"unfair\" incendiary weapons were used in the attack, nothing was achieved. The incendiary shells subsequently proved to have been taken from the captured ''Spartiate'' following the battle on 1 August and were found to be made of a substance that burned even under water.<ref name=\"WJ194\"/> After three days the bombardment was abandoned and no further activity took place on the Egyptian coast during the remainder of the year. The Turkish and Russian vessels were eventually withdrawn in December, while ''Lion'' was detached to join the blockade of Malta.<ref name=\"WLC377\">Clowes, p. 377</ref>\n\n===Ionian Sea===\n{{main|French rule in the Ionian Islands (1797\u20131799)}}\nThe main Mediterranean fleets of the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire were deployed in the [[Ionian Sea]]. At the Treaty of Campo Formio, France had been awarded the [[Ionian Islands]] and the four fortresses of [[Butrinto]], [[Parga]], [[Preveza]] and [[Vonitsa|Vonizza]] on the Albanian and Greek coasts.<ref name=\"RG58\">Gardiner, p. 58</ref> In early October 1798, following the declaration of war between France and the Ottomans, a large Turkish army had advanced across the Balkans and rapidly forced the fortresses to surrender. At the same time, the Ionian Islands were attacked by a joint Russian and Turkish expeditionary force, which included ten Russian ships of the line, numerous smaller Russian vessels and approximately 30 assorted Turkish ships. On board were 8,000 Turkish soldiers, which rapidly invaded and seized the islands of [[Paxi]], [[Santa Maura]], [[Theaki]], [[Cephalonia]], [[Zante]] and [[Cerigo]], capturing 1,500 French prisoners by 10 October.<ref name=\"WJ190\">James, p. 190</ref> Only the large fortified island of Corfu held out, and there the defenders were forced back into the [[Corfu (city)|main town]]. Although the town was [[Siege of Corfu (1798\u20131799)|besieged]], operations were slow and the blockade was only loosely enforced, allowing ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'' to successfully break out and reach [[Ancona]]. By the end of the year little had changed, the French garrison remaining besieged in Corfu.<ref name=\"WLC375\">Clowes, p. 375</ref>\n\n===Malta and Naples===\n{{main|Siege of Malta (1798\u20131800)}}\nFurther westwards, the newly captured French island of Malta was under a much more diligent blockade. The returning convoy from Aboukir Bay under Saumarez reached Malta in September. There he encountered a squadron of four [[Portuguese Navy|Portuguese]] ships of the line and the British ship ''Lion'' under the command of Tom\u00e1s Xavier Teles de Castro da Gama, [[Count of Vidigueira|Marquess de Niza]], initially sending them on to Alexandria.<ref name=\"WJ188\">James, p. 188</ref> While anchored off Malta awaiting favourable winds, a delegation of native Maltese citizens was brought on board Saumarez's ship ''Orion'' on 25 September. They announced that the Maltese people, infuriated with French disestablishment of the Roman Catholic Church on Malta, had risen up against the French garrison and were forcing them back towards the fortress of Valletta.<ref name=\"RG67\">Gardiner, p. 67</ref> Saumarez attempted to negotiate the surrender of the island with Vaubois, but was rebuffed. Unable to delay his passage to Gibraltar any longer, Saumarez gave the Maltese 1,200 muskets and promised to send assistance as soon as he was able.<ref name=\"WLC374\">Clowes, p. 374</ref> By 12 October, the French [[Siege of Malta (1798-1800)|were besieged in Valletta]] by 10,000 Maltese irregulars. Vaubois had only 3,000 healthy troops, although the arrival of Villeneuve with the ship of the line [[French ship Guillaume Tell (1795)|''Guillaume Tell'']] and two frigates did bolster his defences.<ref name=\"WJ189\">James, p. 189</ref>\n\nOn the same day that the French retreated to Valletta, Nelson despatched the ships ''Alexander'', ''Culloden'', and [[HMS Colossus (1787)|''Colossus'']] from his squadron at Naples to blockade the port, under the command of Captain Alexander Ball. Although the Neapolitans refused to deploy forces to Malta, which was technically their territory, the squadron was joined within a few days by Niza's Portuguese ships and then by Nelson, now Lord Nelson, in ''Vanguard'' on 24 October.<ref name=\"RG67\"/> Four days later, Nelson authorised Ball to negotiate the surrender of the nearby island of [[Gozo]]. The French abandoned the island's fortifications and the British captured 24 cannon and 3,200 urgently required sacks of grain, which were distributed among the Maltese populace. With the French garrison trapped in Valletta, no further actions took place off Malta during the year, both sides settling in for a long siege.<ref name=\"WJ189\"/>\n\nWhile his captains enforced the blockade of Malta and Alexandria during September and October, Nelson was anchored in the [[Bay of Naples]], enjoying the hospitality of [[Ferdinand IV of Naples|King Ferdinand]] and [[Maria Carolina of Austria|Queen Maria Carolina]] of the Kingdom of Naples. Arriving on 22 September, ''Vanguard'' was greeted with over 500 small vessels organised by the royal family and led by a barge carrying Sir William and Lady Emma Hamilton.<ref name=\"RG47\">Gardiner, p. 47</ref> Over the next weeks, Nelson was taken into the court as an honoured guest, and has subsequently been accused of neglecting his naval responsibilities.<ref name=\"RG47\"/> It was at this time that his mutual attraction to Lady Emma Hamilton developed into a romantic affair. He also began to dabble in Neapolitan politics, successfully combining with [[Maria Carolina of Austria|Maria Carolina]], the francophobe Queen, to encourage Ferdinand to go to war with France. Ferdinand ordered the Neapolitan army under General [[Karl Mack von Leiberich|Mack]] to drive the French out of Rome.<ref name=\"EB223\">Bradford, p. 223</ref>  The resulting campaign was a disaster for the Neapolitans; the French counterattacked and forced Ferdinand and his court to flee to [[Palermo]] in Sicily. The French established the [[Parthenopean Republic]] in Naples to replace the monarchy.<ref name=\"WLC375\"/>\n\n===Spain and Menorca===\n[[File:Lion and Dorotea.jpg|300px|thumb|''Capture of the Dorothea, 15 July 1798'', [[Thomas Whitcombe]], 1816|alt=A two decked ship fires from both sides as it is surrounded by four smaller ships, three on one side and one on the other]]\nWhile Nelson was engaged in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean, the main Mediterranean Fleet under Earl St Vincent had ensured that the Spanish Navy was unable to intervene. On 24 May St Vincent was joined at the Tagus by a reinforcement of eight ships under Rear-Admiral [[Roger Curtis|Sir Roger Curtis]], and the admiral ordered his ships to establish blockades off the southern Spanish ports, especially [[Cadiz]], where the main Spanish fleet lay at anchor.<ref name=\"WJ195\">James, p. 195</ref> There regular correspondence passed between St Vincent and Admiral Don [[Joseph Massaredo]], the Spanish commander.<ref name=\"WJ195\"/> The Spanish fleet made no major deployments during the year, except for a single convoy of the ship of the line [[Spanish ship Monarcha (1794)|''Monarca'']], two frigates and several merchant vessels that sailed in April.<ref name=\"WLC377\"/> Although privateers and minor warships fought several small engagements along the Spanish Mediterranean coast, the only significant Spanish deployment of the remainder of the year was by a frigate squadron based at [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], which was intercepted by the British ship of the line ''Lion''.<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=15061|page=879|date=15 September 1798}}</ref> At the ensuing [[Action of 15 July 1798]], the Spanish ships formed a line to meet the attack of Captain Dixon's ship but the damaged frigate [[Spanish ship Santa Dorotea|''Santa Dorotea'']] fell behind the leading three frigates. As the leading ships returned to Catagena after a desultory long-range exchange of gunfire, ''Santa Dorotea'' was defeated and captured.<ref name=\"RG54\">Gardiner, p. 54</ref>\n\nOnce the French Mediterranean Fleet had been destroyed in Aboukir Bay, St Vincent was determined to restore British hegemony in the Mediterranean. To ensure this, his fleet needed a base with a well protected deep water harbour that could not be assaulted by land.<ref name=\"RG45\"/> The best island harbour in the Western Mediterranean was at [[Mah\u00f3n|Port Mahon]] on [[Menorca]], where a large modern dockyard included a careening wharf, extensive storehouses and a purpose-built naval hospital.

The [[French First Republic|French Republic]] sought to capture Egypt as the first stage in an effort to threaten [[British India]] and support [[Tipu Sultan]], and thus force [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] to make peace. Departing [[Toulon]] in May 1798 with over 40,000 troops and hundreds of ships, Bonaparte's fleet sailed southeastwards across the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. They were followed by a small British squadron under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Horatio Nelson]], later reinforced to 13 [[ships of the line]], whose pursuit was hampered by a lack of scouting [[frigate]]s and reliable information. Bonaparte's first target was the island of [[Malta]], which was under the government of the [[Knights of St. John]] and theoretically granted its owner control of the Central Mediterranean. Bonaparte's forces landed on the island and rapidly overwhelmed the defenders, securing the port city of [[Valletta]] before continuing to Egypt. When Nelson learned of the French capture of the island, he guessed the French target to be Egypt and sailed for [[Alexandria]], but passed the French during the night of 22 June without discovering them and arrived off Egypt first.\n\nUnable to find Bonaparte, Nelson turned back across the Mediterranean, eventually reaching [[Sicily]] on 19 July. While Nelson was returning westwards, Bonaparte reached Alexandria and stormed the city, capturing the coast and marching his army inland. His fleet, entrusted to Vice-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers]], was anchored in a [[line of battle]] in [[Aboukir Bay]]. On 1 August, Nelson, who had returned to the Egyptian coast after reports gathered at [[Koroni|Coron]] revealed the French invasion, arrived off Aboukir Bay. Although it was late afternoon and the British fleet had no accurate charts of the bay, Nelson ordered an immediate attack on the French [[:wikt:vanguard|van]]. Brueys was unprepared, and his ships were unable to manoeuvre as the British split into two divisions and sailed down either side of the French line, capturing all five ships of the vanguard and engaging his 120-gun flagship [[French ship Orient (1791)|''Orient'']] in the centre. At 21:00, ''Orient'' caught fire and exploded, killing most of the crew and ending the main combat. Sporadic fighting continued for the next two days, until all of the French ships had been captured, destroyed or fled. At the [[Battle of the Nile]], eleven French ships of the line and two frigates were eliminated, trapping Bonaparte in Egypt and changing the balance of power in the Mediterranean.\n\nWith the French Navy in the Mediterranean defeated, other nations were encouraged to join the [[Second Coalition]] and go to war with France. [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] all subsequently deployed forces to the Mediterranean. The Russians and Turks participated in the blockade of Egypt and operations in the [[Adriatic Sea]] while the Portuguese joined the [[Siege of Malta (1798-1800)|Siege of Malta]], which was distantly conducted by Nelson from his lodgings in [[Naples]]. Nelson, who had been wounded at the Battle of the Nile, became involved in Neapolitan politics and encouraged [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand]] to go to war with France, resulting in the loss of his mainland kingdom. In the Western Mediterranean, Vice-Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Earl St Vincent]], who commanded the Mediterranean fleet from off [[Cadiz]], deployed forces against [[Menorca]], rapidly captured the island and turned it into an important naval base.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Bonaparte's plan===\nAt the beginning of 1798, the [[War of the First Coalition]] had come to an end with French control of Northern Italy, much of the [[Low Countries]] and the [[Rhineland]] confirmed by the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]].<ref name=\"DC78\">Chandler, p. 78</ref> Of all the major European powers that had at one time allied against the [[First French Republic|French Republic]], only the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] remained hostile, and the [[French Directory]] determined to end the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] by eliminating Britain. A series of invasions of the [[British Isles]] were planned,<ref name=\"DC185\">Come, p. 185</ref> and the 28-year-old General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who had defeated the Austrians in Italy the previous year, was assigned to lead the ''Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre'' (Army of England) that had been assembled at [[Boulogne]].<ref name=\"WJ113\">James, p. 113</ref> However, the [[English Channel]] was firmly controlled by the [[Royal Navy]] and French invasion supplies, particularly of viable [[landing craft]], were totally inadequate for the purpose.<ref name=\"RG107\">Gardiner, p. 107</ref>\n\nIn the early spring of 1798, Bonaparte left his command at Boulogne and returned to Paris, reporting that continued British naval supremacy in Northern European waters made an invasion impossible in the near future.<ref name=\"NM248\">Mostert, p. 248</ref> With operations to the north impossible, Bonaparte directed his attention southwards to [[Toulon]], the principal French seaport on the [[Mediterranean]]. There a French army and fleet had begun assembling for a secret location, speculated by French commentators to be aimed at a wide variety of places, including among others Britain, [[Sicily]], Malta and the [[Crimea]].<ref name=\"JC3\">Cole, p. 3</ref><ref name=\"SM230\">Maffeo, p. 230</ref> The expedition's intended target was actually [[Egypt]], which formed an important link in the chain of communications between Britain and the economically vital colony of [[British India]].<ref name=\"RLA7\">Adkins, p. 7</ref> Bonaparte considered the capture of Egypt as the most important step in neutralising the massive economic benefits that Britain gained from trade with India and bringing Britain to terms: in August 1797 he wrote \"The time is not far away that we will feel that, in order to truly destroy England, we must take Egypt.\"<ref name=\"JC14\">Cole, p. 13</ref> Possession of Egypt could grant the French control of the Eastern Mediterranean and the [[Red Sea]], forcing severe delays to dispatches sent between Britain and India and obstructing trade worth \u00a32.7 million (the equivalent of \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|2700000|1798|r=-7}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) to the British economy.{{Inflation-fn|UK}}<ref name=\"SM227\">Maffeo, p. 227</ref> In addition, a successful invasion of Egypt could be followed by a direct attack on British territory in India, possibly in conjunction with the anglophobic [[Tippoo Sultan]] of [[Seringapatam]].<ref name=\"OW41\">Warner, p. 41</ref> The French Mediterranean Fleet was unopposed at the start of 1798 \u2013 following the [[Second Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]] in 1796, in which Spain formed an alliance with France and declared war on Britain, the Royal Navy had withdrawn from the Mediterranean bases of [[Corsica]] and [[Elba]].<ref name=\"JHR140\">Rose, p. 140</ref> By early 1798, their Mediterranean Fleet was based at the [[Tagus River]] in Portugal, their one remaining continental ally.<ref name=\"SM224\">Maffeo, p. 224</ref> With no permanent British fleet in the Mediterranean and [[Irish rebellion of 1798|an uprising]] imminent in Ireland, Bonaparte firmly believed that the Royal Navy would be unable to intervene in his plans, even if they should discover them.<ref name=\"JHR141\">Rose, p. 141</ref>\n\nWith passage to Egypt seemingly unopposed Bonaparte gave orders for a fleet of thirteen [[ships of the line]], led by the 120-gun [[French ship Orient|''Orient'']] under Vice-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers]] and numerous smaller warships, including the entire Venetian Navy, captured the previous year, to prepare for sea.<ref name=\"RG20\">Gardiner, p. 20</ref> The fleet was to be accompanied by up to 400 [[transport ship]]s, which were to carry the 35,000 men detailed for the invasion.<ref name=\"WLC353\">Clowes, p. 353</ref>  On 3 May, Bonaparte departed Paris, arriving at Toulon five days later to oversee the final preparations. On 9 May he reviewed the assembled army and gave a speech announcing that the expedition was bound for an unspecified foreign land. The speech was met with an enthusiastic response from his soldiers and a revised version subsequently appeared in ''[[Le Moniteur Universel]]'' and was widely distributed throughout France as a poster.<ref name=\"JC5\">Cole, p. 5</ref>  Despite Bonaparte's pronouncement the French departure was delayed: a strong headwind prevented the fleet from sailing for another nine days, conditions finally lifting on 18 May that permitted the 22 warships and 120 transports that made up the French fleet to sail the following day.<ref name=\"WJ150\">James, p. 150</ref>\n\n===St. Vincent's response===\n[[File:HoratioNelson1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson'', [[Lemuel Francis Abbott]], 1800, [[National Maritime Museum]]|alt=Portrait of a man in an ornate naval uniform festooned with medals and awards.]]\nBritain was not unaware of French preparations at Toulon and along the Mediterranean coast, but despite sustained efforts by British agents in France the destination of the French fleet was unknown.<ref name=\"RLA8\">Adkins, p. 8</ref> Egypt was not seriously considered by the British government: when [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Henry Dundas]] suggested it, he was urged by [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville]] to think \"with a map in your hand, and with a calculation of distances.\"<ref name=\"NR458\">Rodger, p. 458</ref> Letters reached London and St. Vincent at the Tagus describing extensive preparations right along the French and Italian Mediterranean coastlines, but the distances between the base in the Tagus and Toulon prevented any sustained observation of French movements.<ref name=\"SM234\">Maffeo, p. 234</ref> Urgent orders were sent from [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Lord Spencer]] at the [[Admiralty]] to Vice-Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Earl St. Vincent]], commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet at the Tagus, to despatch a squadron to investigate under the command of Rear-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson|Sir Horatio Nelson]]. Nelson had returned to the fleet three days earlier at Lord Spencer's order,<ref name=\"EB169\">Bradford, p. 169</ref> following recovery in Britain from the loss of an arm at the [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] in July 1797.<ref name=\"RG18\">Gardiner, p. 18</ref>\n\nSt. Vincent had already been preparing for an expedition to Toulon with Nelson in mind, and the rear-admiral departed the Tagus in his flagship [[HMS Vanguard (1787)|HMS ''Vanguard'']] on 2 May. St Vincent was overjoyed to be able to place Nelson in command of the mission, writing that \"the arrival of Admiral Nelson has given me new life ... his presence in the Mediterranean is so very essential\".<ref name=\"EB170\">Bradford, p. 170</ref> His preference for Nelson over the more senior admirals [[Sir William Parker, 1st Baronet, of Harburn|Sir William Parker]] and [[Sir John Orde, 1st Baronet|Sir John Orde]] provoked a storm of protest, which eventually culminated in Orde challenging St Vincent to a duel,<ref name=\"NM255\">Mostert, p. 255</ref> and being subsequently ordered to return to Britain.<ref name=\"OW45\">Warner, p. 45</ref> On 9 May Nelson collected the ships of the line [[HMS Alexander (1778)|HMS ''Alexander'']] and [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']] under Captains [[Alexander John Ball|Alexander Ball]] and [[James Saumarez|Sir James Saumarez]] the frigates [[HMS Emerald (1795)|HMS ''Emerald'']] and [[HMS Terpsichore (1785)|HMS ''Terpsichore'']] under Captains [[Thomas Moutray Waller]] and [[William Hall Gage]] and the [[sloop]] [[HMS Bonne Citoyenne|HMS ''Bonne Citoyenne'']] under Captain [[Robert Retalick]] at [[Gibraltar]], and passed into the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"WLC351\">Clowes, p. 351</ref> Despite leaving under cover of darkness,<ref name=\"EB172\">Bradford, p. 172</ref> Nelson's departure was observed by Spanish forces at Cadiz, and the fort at Cape Carnero fired several shot, striking ''Alexander'' but inflicting negligible damage.<ref name=\"JK41\">Keegan, p. 41</ref>\n\nOn 17 May ''Terpsichore'' captured the [[privateer]] ''La Pierre'' off [[Cape Sici\u00e9]], and from the crew Nelson learned that Bonaparte's departure was imminent, although the destination was still unknown.<ref name=\"SM239\">Maffeo, p. 239</ref> On 21 May, as his squadron reached the [[\u00celes d'Hy\u00e8res]] near Toulon, they were struck by strong winds that snapped ''Vanguard''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s topmasts and brought the wreckage down onto the deck, killing two men.<ref name=\"JK41\"/> ''Vanguard'' was left struggling in heavy seas, blown {{convert|75|nmi|km}} southwards in one night.<ref name=\"EB173\">Bradford, p. 173</ref> So severe was the damage that ''Vanguard'' was almost wrecked on the Corsican coast on the following day and Nelson even ordered Captain Ball, who had managed to attach a towline to the flagship, to abandon him.<ref name=\"PP112\">Padfield, p. 112</ref> Ball refused the order and the British ships of the line rode out the storm together.<ref name=\"NM250\">Mostert, p. 250</ref> Although ''Alexander'' was able to tow ''Vanguard'' to [[San Pietro Island]] off [[Sardinia]] for repairs, the gale had forced the squadron's frigates to separate from the larger ships.<ref name=\"PP113\">Padfield, p. 113</ref>\n\nThomas Waller on ''Emerald'' was divided from the other frigates, and his lookouts had observed ''Vanguard'' in its dismasted state at the height of the storm. The other two frigates had reefed their sails and ridden out the storm together, Captain Gage turning towards the Spanish coast when the storm abated and on 29 May encountered [[HMS Alcmene (1794)|HMS ''Alcmene'']] under Captain [[George Johnstone Hope]], which had been sent by St. Vincent to augment Nelson's force.

Although the Neapolitan Prime Minister [[Sir John Acton, 6th Baronet|Sir John Acton]] had already passed on reports that the French were sailing for Egypt, Hamilton did not give the report to Nelson, possibly suspicious of [[disinformation]].<ref name=\"JK50\">Keegan, p. 50</ref> Hamilton did however relay the information that Bonaparte's fleet had passed Sardinia and were probably sailing in the direction of Malta. Despite private animosity towards France,<ref name=\"OW55\">Warner, p. 55</ref> the Neapolitan government refused to openly join the British in the war and denied Nelson the use of their frigates,<ref name=\"EB176\">Bradford, p. 176</ref> although they did quietly agree to resupply Nelson's fleet.<ref name=\"NM253\"/> With a rough direction established and believing the ultimate French destination to be Sicily,<ref name=\"EB177\">Bradford, p. 177</ref> Nelson sailed in pursuit, but light winds hampered his advances and he did not pass the [[Straits of Messina]] until 20 June.

Two squadrons of five ships each would engage the French fleet directly while the third would separate and attack the transports, sinking or capturing as many as possible.<ref name=\"WJ153\">James, p. 153</ref> Nelson also deliberately forged close links with his captains at regular dinners aboard his flagship to ensure ease of communication and build confidence between them.

Arriving off Malta on 9 June, he demanded that the island's ruler, [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]], the [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] (or Knights of St. John of Jerusalem) to allow his fleet to enter the harbour and purchase provisions.<ref name=\"JC8\">Cole, p. 8</ref>  Hompesch refused, insisting that only two ships at a time could enter the port. Bonaparte responded by opening fire on the harbour defences and on 11 June landed soldiers at seven sites around Malta under General [[Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers]]. Coming under fire from the 2,000 native Maltese soldiers that mustered against the invasion, skirmishing continued in the western part of the island for 24 hours, until General [[Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois]] entered [[Mdina]] and the defenders withdrew to the [[Fortifications of Valletta|fortress of Valletta]].<ref name=\"JC9\">Cole, p. 9</ref> The Maltese troops refused to continue the fight without support from their government,<ref name=\"OW29\">Warner, p. 29</ref> and negotiations followed in which Hompesch and the knights agreed to abandon Malta on condition of financial compensation amounting to 3 million [[Francs]].<ref name=\"JC10\"/> In exchange, Bonaparte gained the entire Maltese archipelago, including fortresses, military stores and cannon, the small Maltese Navy and Army and the entire property of the Roman Catholic Church in Malta.<ref name=\"RG21\">Gardiner, p. 21</ref>\n\nThe Maltese position had already been severely weakened by the large number of Frenchmen who were part of the Order, who refused ''en masse'' to take up arms against Bonaparte. The [[French Revolution]] had already significantly reduced the Knights' income and their ability to put up serious resistance to Bonaparte was seriously compromised by a lack of resources.<ref name=\"JC10\">Cole, p. 10</ref> On 12 June, Bonaparte finally announced to his troops the destination of the expedition and on 19 June he sailed for Alexandria, initially steering east towards [[Crete]]. He left behind Vaubois and 4,000 men to maintain Malta as a base to control the Central Mediterranean.<ref name=\"RLA13\">Adkins, p. 13</ref> To ensure that news of the impending attack on Egypt did not spread ahead of the fleet, Brueys ordered that any merchant ships that sighted the convoy during the passage were to be seized and detained until his force had reached Alexandria.<ref name=\"SM256\">Maffeo, p. 256</ref> On 26 June, the British gained the first firm intelligence of French intentions, when the frigate [[HMS Seahorse (1794)|HMS ''Seahorse'']] under Captain [[Edward Foote]] [[Action of 27 June 1798|encountered and captured]] the French frigate [[French frigate Sensible (1788)|''Sensible'']], which was returning to Toulon from Malta with a cargo of treasure and wounded soldiers, including General d'Hilliers.<ref name=\"WJ208\">James, p. 208</ref> From these prisoners the destination of the French fleet was discovered and ''Seahorse'', joined shortly afterwards by ''Terpsichore'', sailed in pursuit, hoping to encounter Nelson.<ref name=\"WJ160\">James, p. 160</ref>\n\n==Arrivals at Alexandria==\nNelson's passage from Sicily to Alexandria was uneventful, the journey taking six days. Due to his lack of frigates, Nelson was unable to scout to the flanks of his advance and as a result only spoke with three merchant ships, none of which had useful information about the French fleet.<ref name=\"WJ154\">James, p. 154</ref> The lack of frigates had already had a decisive effect on 22 June, when the British fleet sighted four sails to the southeast.<ref name=\"NM254\">Mostert, p. 254</ref> Although Captain [[Sir Thomas Thompson, 1st Baronet|Thomas Thompson]] of [[HMS Leander (1780)|HMS ''Leander'']] requested permission to investigate the strangers, Nelson refused and ordered his fleet to continue on their current heading, believing the French to be five days ahead and wishing to reach Alexandria as rapidly as possible.<ref name=\"JK56\">Keegan, p. 56</ref> Had British frigates been available to approach and investigate the distant squadron, they might have discovered that they were scouts for the main French fleet, which was only a short distance away.<ref name=\"RLA14\">Adkins, p. 14</ref> The French frigate had sighted the British fleet and reported its presence to Bonaparte, who adjusted his convoy's direction slightly to a more northerly trajectory.<ref name=\"EB182\">Bradford, p. 182</ref> As a result, Nelson's fleet passed north of the French to the east of Malta during the night in a heavy mist. Although Nelson was so close that his signal guns could be heard aboard ''Orient'', his lookouts did not observe the French ships and the British fleet continued ahead without deviating.<ref name=\"SM258\">Maffeo, p. 258</ref> When dawn broke the following day, Bonaparte's diversion to the northeast had taken his convoy out of sight of the British fleet, which continued to the southeast undisturbed.<ref name=\"EB185\">Bradford, p. 185</ref> On 28 June, ''Mutine''  arrived at Alexandria ahead of Nelson's fleet, and discovered that the French fleet was not in the harbour.<ref name=\"OW58\">Warner, p. 58</ref> Once the main fleet had arrived, attempts were made to contact the British Consul [[George Baldwin (diplomat)|George Baldwin]], but these failed as he had been dismissed by the British government shortly before and had left the city.<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{cite journal |last= Mew|first=James |month= |title=Baldwin, George |journal=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |id= |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1165|accessdate=26 November 2009 |quote= }}</ref> As a result, official diplomatic channels were closed to Nelson.<ref name=\"EB188\">Bradford, p. 188</ref> A message warning of the French approach was carried to the Ottoman governor Sayyid Muhammad Kurayyim by Hardy in ''Mutine''.

Soldiers were landed in the region of the Mirabou Creek, although the appearance of a sail to the east was mistaken for a scout from the British fleet and caused momentary panic, Bonaparte reportedly exclaiming: ''\"Fortune, m'abandonnerais-tu? Quoi! Seulement cinq jours!\"'' (Fortune, wilt thou abandon me? What! Only five days!). The newcomer was eventually revealed to be the French frigate ''[[French frigate Justice (1794)|Justice]]'' sent from Malta, and the invasion continued unopposed.<ref name=\"WJ156\">James, p. 156</ref> By evening the landing had been completed, although several boats had been wrecked in the surf and Bonaparte himself estimated that at least 20 men had drowned.<ref name=\"RLA17\">Adkins, p. 17</ref>\n\nOn 2 July, Bonaparte led his men to victory in the brief [[Battle of Alexandria (1798)|Battle of Alexandria]] and secured the city. He placed General [[Jean Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber]] in command with Rear-Admiral [[Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley]] in charge of the harbour.<ref name=\"WJ156\"/> Finding that entrances to the anchorage were too shallow to accommodate the main body of the French fleet, Bonaparte ordered Brueys to sail his squadron to the wider [[Aboukir Bay]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} northeast of Alexandria. Brueys was instructed that if he considered the anchorage to be unsafe then he was to sail for Corfu, leaving only a small light force that could anchor comfortably in Alexandria.<ref name=\"NM257\">Mostert, p. 257</ref> There Brueys held a conference with his officers to decide on their response should Nelson discover them in the bay. Although Rear-Admiral [[Armand Blanquet du Chayla|Armand Blanquet]] of [[French ship Franklin (1797)|''Franklin'']] argued that the fleet was safest sailing out to meet the British, he was outvoted and overruled, Brueys ordering that the ships remain anchored in [[line of battle]] to receive the British attack.<ref name=\"WJ159\">James, p. 159</ref> On 21 July, the frigates ''Seahorse'' and ''Terpsichore'' arrived at Alexandria and observed the French dispositions while flying [[French tricolour|French colours]] to confuse observers from the shore. With no sign of Nelson, Foote and Hall turned back westwards in search of the admiral.<ref name=\"WJ160\"/> When Brueys learned that British frigates had been seen off the Egyptian coast, he decided that the retreat of these vessels signified that there was no danger of imminent attack by a British force and therefore failed to take precautions against attack.<ref name=\"OW65\">Warner, p. 65</ref>\n\n===Nelson returns===\nNelson, having sailed northeast on the same day that the first French ships arrived off Alexandria, had reached [[Anatolia]] on 4 July and turned westward against the wind, sailing for Sicily again.<ref name=\"EB192\">Bradford, p. 192</ref>  His ships were briefly scattered by a storm on 5 July, before reconstituting the following day and on 18 July the British fleet reached Cape Passaro again and on 19 July Nelson's force anchored in Syracuse to take on fresh provisions supplied in part by [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]], the wife of the ambassador to Naples.<ref name=\"WLC355\"/> Frustrated, Nelson wrote in a letter to his wife [[Frances Nelson|Fanny]]; \"Every moment I have to regret the frigates having left me, to which must be attributed my ignorance of the movements of the enemy.\"<ref name=\"NM258\">Mostert, p. 258</ref> Reports subsequently reached the British fleet at Syracuse that the French had not been seen in the Eastern Mediterranean, in the [[Adriatic]] or in the [[Aegean Sea]], leaving either Egypt or Syria as the only likely destinations.<ref name=\"EB195\">Bradford, p. 195</ref>  Sailing once more on 25 July, Nelson turned his ships east once again sailing for Morea and sending Troubridge in ''Culloden'' into [[Koroni|Coron]] on 28 July for news.<ref name=\"SM266\">Maffeo, p. 266</ref> The Ottoman governor reported that the French had been seen sailing southwards from Crete at the start of the month and presented Troubridge with a French merchant ship that was anchored in the harbour.<ref name=\"OW62\">Warner, p. 62</ref> With their first definite sighting of the French, the British fleet turned southwards towards Alexandria.<ref name=\"RG30\">Gardiner, p. 30</ref>\n\n==Battle of the Nile==\n{{dablink|For more details on this topic, see [[Battle of the Nile]].}}\nOn 1 August, Nelson's fleet reached the Egyptian coast, the ships [[HMS Swiftsure (1787)|HMS ''Swiftsure'']] and [[HMS Alexander (1778)|HMS ''Alexander'']] detached as scouts to investigate Alexandria harbour.

Rather than place his lead ship ''Guerrier'' close to the northern shoal, the French admiral had left a gap, widened by the order for the French fleet to only anchor by the bow which meant that they drifted significantly, between ''Guerrier'' and the shoals.<ref name=\"RLA24\"/> Sailing directly through this gap, Foley [[raking fire|raked]] ''Guerrier'' and engaged the second ship of the French line, ''Conqu\u00e9rant''.<ref name=\"NM266\">Mostert, p. 266</ref> ''Zealous'' also passed through the gap and attacked ''Guerrier'', and was followed by [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']], [[HMS Theseus (1786)|HMS ''Theseus'']] and [[HMS Audacious (1785)|HMS ''Audacious'']], all of which opened up a fierce fire on the first four French ships against their unprepared [[port (nautical)|port]] sides.<ref name=\"WJ165\">James, p. 165</ref>\n\nNelson followed in ''Vanguard'', bringing the next two ships into action with the [[starboard]] side of the French van, catching the French ships in a crossfire that rapidly battered and dismasted the ships, despite determined defence.<ref name=\"WLC362\">Clowes, p. 362</ref> As the French van was destroyed, [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']] and [[HMS Majestic (1785)|HMS ''Majestic'']] attacked the French centre.

Nine of eleven ships of the line had been captured or destroyed, as well as two frigates.<ref name=\"NM272\"/> French casualties totalled more than 3,000 and possibly as many as 5,000, compared to British losses of 218 killed and 677 wounded.<ref name=\"WLC370\">Clowes, p. 370</ref> However, many of Nelson's ships were seriously damaged, and urgent repairs were required for both his own ships and the captured prizes before they could begin the long voyage back to Britain. For more than two weeks Nelson remained in Aboukir Bay, effecting repairs, writing despatches and assessing the strategic situation in Egypt.<ref name=\"SM273\">Maffeo, p. 273</ref> The first ship detached from his squadron was ''Leander'', sent on 5 August to the fleet under Earl St. Vincent off [[Cadiz]] with reports of the battle.<ref name=\"WJ182\">James, p. 182</ref> On 8 August Aboukir Island was stormed and captured, and on 12 August ''Emerald'', ''Alcmene'' and ''Bonne Citoyenne'' finally caught up with the fleet, followed on 17 August by ''Seahorse'' and ''Terpsichore''.<ref name=\"WLC373\"/> ''Mutine'' was detached on 13 August with despatches for the Admiralty and on 14 August Nelson sent seven ships with the six seaworthy prizes to the mouth of Aboukir Bay under the command of Saumarez.<ref name=\"WJ183\">James, p. 183</ref> This convoy sailed for Gibraltar on 15 August and the following day Nelson burnt ''Heureux'', followed on 18 August by ''Mercure'' and ''Guerrier'', none of which were fit for continued service. On 19 August Nelson separated his remaining ships, leading three vessels northwards towards Naples and leaving a [[blockade]] squadron off Alexandria of ''Zealous'', ''Goliath'', ''Swiftsure'' and the frigates, under Captain [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Samuel Hood]].<ref name=\"WLC373\">Clowes, p. 373</ref>\n\nBy the time Nelson departed Alexandria, his first set of dispatches were already in French hands. ''Leander'' had been discovered off the western coast of [[Crete]] [[Action of 18 August 1798|on 18 August 1798]] by the French ship of the line [[French ship Le G\u00e9n\u00e9reux|''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'']], one of Villeneuve's escapees.<ref name=RG43>Gardiner, p. 43</ref> After separating from Villeneuve's squadron on 17 August, ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'' was sailing to Corfu when it encountered the British fourth rate. The larger French ship soon overtook the British vessel and a heated exchange followed: French efforts to board ''Leander'' were driven back with heavy casualties, and Captain Thompson at one stage successfully raked his opponent, but gradually the heavier weight of ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'' inflicted severe damage to the British ship and after six and a half hours Thompson was forced to surrender.<ref name=\"WJ232\">James, p. 232</ref> French captain [[Louis-Jean-Nicolas Lejoille|Lejoille]] then authorised widespread looting of the personal effects of the British crew, whom he also forced to conduct repairs on both ships, an act against the established conventions of naval warfare.<ref name=\"WLC516\">Clowes, p. 516</ref> The prize was towed to Corfu for repairs, the two battered vessels briefly encountering ''Mutine'', which escaped to the westwards before ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'' could give chase. In captivity Lejoille continued to refuse to allow the British officers medical attention or return their stolen property.<ref name=\"WJ235\">James, p. 235</ref> Eventually returned to Britain, Thompson and Berry were [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] and heavily praised for their defence of their ship against heavy odds, while Lejoille was also commended for his success, assisted by his incorrect account of the battle published in French newspapers.<ref name=\"WJ237\">James, p. 237</ref>\n\n===Alexandria===\nWith the French naval presence in the Mediterranean reduced to a few scattered vessels, the allies of the [[Second Coalition]] were able to exert their dominance in the region. Off Alexandria, the squadron under Captain Hood successfully prevented communications between France and the French army in Egypt.<ref name=\"WJ191\">James, p. 191</ref> On 22 August, just three days after Nelson sailed north, ''Alcmene'' intercepted the 6-gun dispatch vessel ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' off Alexandria harbour and forced the captain to surrender. As his flag was struck, the captain hurled the dispatches into the sea. This action was witnessed by sailors [[John Taylor (RN hero)|John Taylor]] and John Harding aboard ''Alcmene'' and both men dived into the water, successfully retrieving the messages.<ref name=guelphmercury2018-01-01/><ref name=guelphhistoricalsociety/><ref name=TorontoOldAndNew/><ref name=\"WLC376\">Clowes, p. 376</ref> For their bravery in diving from a rapidly moving ship into unknown waters, both men were granted annual pensions of \u00a320 (the equivalent of \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|20|1798|r=-2}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}} Three days after the capture of ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'', Captain Foley of ''Goliath'' sent a boat into the sheltered anchorage under Aboukir Castle, where his men boarded and captured the armed [[ketch]] [[French gun-vessel Torride (1797)|''Torride'']], typical of the gun-vessels that had fired on the British advance during the Battle of the Nile.<ref name=\"WJ192\">James, p. 192</ref> On 2 September, another dispatch vessel reached the Egyptian coast, the 4-gun [[cutter (ship)|cutter]] ''An\u00e9mone'' carrying General Camin and 60 men from Malta.<ref name=\"WLC376\"/> ''Swiftsure'' and ''Emerald'' managed to cut off the vessel from Alexandria harbour and drive it ashore near the town of Marabou. Although the cutter swiftly broke up in the surf, most of the men aboard managed to scramble ashore. There, while the British ships lay off shore unable to intervene, [[Bedouin]] [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] discovered the survivors and massacred them, dragging the few survivors inland before French cavalry could rescue them.<ref name=\"WJ193\">James, p. 193</ref> The only survivors were rescued by Lieutenant [[Francis William Fane]], who swam to shore with an empty barrel attached to a rope. Despite coming under fire from the French on the beach, he was able to save five men from the Bedouin attack.<ref name=\"WLC376\"/>\n\nIn October the small British squadron at Alexandria was briefly reinforced by a Portuguese squadron of four ships of the line and the 64-gun [[HMS Lion (1777)|HMS ''Lion'']] under Captain [[Manley Dixon]], although the Portuguese sailed for Malta after only a few days.<ref name=\"WJ193\"/> On 19 October the squadron was joined by two Turkish [[corvette]]s, two Russian frigates and 16 small Turkish gunboats, arranged by Hood on a visit to [[Rhodes]] in ''Swiftsure'' the week before.<ref name=\"WJ194\">James, p. 194</ref> The gunboats were subsequently used to bombard Aboukir Castle and a French encampment at Lake Maadie on 25 October, although results were negligible. After the first day the Turkish crews were replaced with British sailors, but except for a complaint from the French that \"unfair\" incendiary weapons were used in the attack, nothing was achieved. The incendiary shells subsequently proved to have been taken from the captured ''Spartiate'' following the battle on 1 August and were found to be made of a substance that burned even under water.<ref name=\"WJ194\"/> After three days the bombardment was abandoned and no further activity took place on the Egyptian coast during the remainder of the year. The Turkish and Russian vessels were eventually withdrawn in December, while ''Lion'' was detached to join the blockade of Malta.<ref name=\"WLC377\">Clowes, p. 377</ref>\n\n===Ionian Sea===\n{{main|French rule in the Ionian Islands (1797\u20131799)}}\nThe main Mediterranean fleets of the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire were deployed in the [[Ionian Sea]]. At the Treaty of Campo Formio, France had been awarded the [[Ionian Islands]] and the four fortresses of [[Butrinto]], [[Parga]], [[Preveza]] and [[Vonitsa|Vonizza]] on the Albanian and Greek coasts.<ref name=\"RG58\">Gardiner, p. 58</ref> In early October 1798, following the declaration of war between France and the Ottomans, a large Turkish army had advanced across the Balkans and rapidly forced the fortresses to surrender. At the same time, the Ionian Islands were attacked by a joint Russian and Turkish expeditionary force, which included ten Russian ships of the line, numerous smaller Russian vessels and approximately 30 assorted Turkish ships. On board were 8,000 Turkish soldiers, which rapidly invaded and seized the islands of [[Paxi]], [[Santa Maura]], [[Theaki]], [[Cephalonia]], [[Zante]] and [[Cerigo]], capturing 1,500 French prisoners by 10 October.<ref name=\"WJ190\">James, p. 190</ref> Only the large fortified island of Corfu held out, and there the defenders were forced back into the [[Corfu (city)|main town]]. Although the town was [[Siege of Corfu (1798\u20131799)|besieged]], operations were slow and the blockade was only loosely enforced, allowing ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'' to successfully break out and reach [[Ancona]]. By the end of the year little had changed, the French garrison remaining besieged in Corfu.<ref name=\"WLC375\">Clowes, p. 375</ref>\n\n===Malta and Naples===\n{{main|Siege of Malta (1798\u20131800)}}\nFurther westwards, the newly captured French island of Malta was under a much more diligent blockade. The returning convoy from Aboukir Bay under Saumarez reached Malta in September. There he encountered a squadron of four [[Portuguese Navy|Portuguese]] ships of the line and the British ship ''Lion'' under the command of Tom\u00e1s Xavier Teles de Castro da Gama, [[Count of Vidigueira|Marquess de Niza]], initially sending them on to Alexandria.<ref name=\"WJ188\">James, p. 188</ref> While anchored off Malta awaiting favourable winds, a delegation of native Maltese citizens was brought on board Saumarez's ship ''Orion'' on 25 September. They announced that the Maltese people, infuriated with French disestablishment of the Roman Catholic Church on Malta, had risen up against the French garrison and were forcing them back towards the fortress of Valletta.<ref name=\"RG67\">Gardiner, p. 67</ref> Saumarez attempted to negotiate the surrender of the island with Vaubois, but was rebuffed. Unable to delay his passage to Gibraltar any longer, Saumarez gave the Maltese 1,200 muskets and promised to send assistance as soon as he was able.<ref name=\"WLC374\">Clowes, p. 374</ref> By 12 October, the French [[Siege of Malta (1798-1800)|were besieged in Valletta]] by 10,000 Maltese irregulars. Vaubois had only 3,000 healthy troops, although the arrival of Villeneuve with the ship of the line [[French ship Guillaume Tell (1795)|''Guillaume Tell'']] and two frigates did bolster his defences.<ref name=\"WJ189\">James, p. 189</ref>\n\nOn the same day that the French retreated to Valletta, Nelson despatched the ships ''Alexander'', ''Culloden'', and [[HMS Colossus (1787)|''Colossus'']] from his squadron at Naples to blockade the port, under the command of Captain Alexander Ball. Although the Neapolitans refused to deploy forces to Malta, which was technically their territory, the squadron was joined within a few days by Niza's Portuguese ships and then by Nelson, now Lord Nelson, in ''Vanguard'' on 24 October.<ref name=\"RG67\"/> Four days later, Nelson authorised Ball to negotiate the surrender of the nearby island of [[Gozo]]. The French abandoned the island's fortifications and the British captured 24 cannon and 3,200 urgently required sacks of grain, which were distributed among the Maltese populace. With the French garrison trapped in Valletta, no further actions took place off Malta during the year, both sides settling in for a long siege.<ref name=\"WJ189\"/>\n\nWhile his captains enforced the blockade of Malta and Alexandria during September and October, Nelson was anchored in the [[Bay of Naples]], enjoying the hospitality of [[Ferdinand IV of Naples|King Ferdinand]] and [[Maria Carolina of Austria|Queen Maria Carolina]] of the Kingdom of Naples. Arriving on 22 September, ''Vanguard'' was greeted with over 500 small vessels organised by the royal family and led by a barge carrying Sir William and Lady Emma Hamilton.<ref name=\"RG47\">Gardiner, p. 47</ref> Over the next weeks, Nelson was taken into the court as an honoured guest, and has subsequently been accused of neglecting his naval responsibilities.<ref name=\"RG47\"/> It was at this time that his mutual attraction to Lady Emma Hamilton developed into a romantic affair. He also began to dabble in Neapolitan politics, successfully combining with [[Maria Carolina of Austria|Maria Carolina]], the francophobe Queen, to encourage Ferdinand to go to war with France. Ferdinand ordered the Neapolitan army under General [[Karl Mack von Leiberich|Mack]] to drive the French out of Rome.<ref name=\"EB223\">Bradford, p. 223</ref>  The resulting campaign was a disaster for the Neapolitans; the French counterattacked and forced Ferdinand and his court to flee to [[Palermo]] in Sicily. The French established the [[Parthenopean Republic]] in Naples to replace the monarchy.<ref name=\"WLC375\"/>\n\n===Spain and Menorca===\n[[File:Lion and Dorotea.jpg|300px|thumb|''Capture of the Dorothea, 15 July 1798'', [[Thomas Whitcombe]], 1816|alt=A two decked ship fires from both sides as it is surrounded by four smaller ships, three on one side and one on the other]]\nWhile Nelson was engaged in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean, the main Mediterranean Fleet under Earl St Vincent had ensured that the Spanish Navy was unable to intervene. On 24 May St Vincent was joined at the Tagus by a reinforcement of eight ships under Rear-Admiral [[Roger Curtis|Sir Roger Curtis]], and the admiral ordered his ships to establish blockades off the southern Spanish ports, especially [[Cadiz]], where the main Spanish fleet lay at anchor.<ref name=\"WJ195\">James, p. 195</ref> There regular correspondence passed between St Vincent and Admiral Don [[Joseph Massaredo]], the Spanish commander.<ref name=\"WJ195\"/> The Spanish fleet made no major deployments during the year, except for a single convoy of the ship of the line [[Spanish ship Monarcha (1794)|''Monarca'']], two frigates and several merchant vessels that sailed in April.<ref name=\"WLC377\"/> Although privateers and minor warships fought several small engagements along the Spanish Mediterranean coast, the only significant Spanish deployment of the remainder of the year was by a frigate squadron based at [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], which was intercepted by the British ship of the line ''Lion''.<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=15061|page=879|date=15 September 1798}}</ref> At the ensuing [[Action of 15 July 1798]], the Spanish ships formed a line to meet the attack of Captain Dixon's ship but the damaged frigate [[Spanish ship Santa Dorotea|''Santa Dorotea'']] fell behind the leading three frigates. As the leading ships returned to Catagena after a desultory long-range exchange of gunfire, ''Santa Dorotea'' was defeated and captured.<ref name=\"RG54\">Gardiner, p. 54</ref>\n\nOnce the French Mediterranean Fleet had been destroyed in Aboukir Bay, St Vincent was determined to restore British hegemony in the Mediterranean. To ensure this, his fleet needed a base with a well protected deep water harbour that could not be assaulted by land.<ref name=\"RG45\"/> The best island harbour in the Western Mediterranean was at [[Mah\u00f3n|Port Mahon]] on [[Menorca]], where a large modern dockyard included a careening wharf, extensive storehouses and a purpose-built naval hospital. These facilities were all British in manufacture, constructed during periods of occupation by British forces between 1708 \u2013 1756 and 1763 \u2013 1781.<ref name=\"RG45\">Gardiner, p. 45</ref> St Vincent therefore detached two ships of the line, three frigates and several smaller vessels and transports to the island under Commodore [[John Thomas Duckworth]], carrying a small army under Colonel [[Charles Stuart (1753\u20131801)|Charles Stuart]].<ref name=\"WJ196\">James, p. 196</ref> The expeditionary force arrived off Menorca on 7 November and the troops were landed at Addaya Creek. There a Spanish attack was driven off and over the next two days the army continued inland, a detachment under Colonel [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Henry Paget]] seizing Port Mahon while the main army received the surrender of town after town, including [[Fournella]], which overlooked the island's principal protected anchorage.<ref name=\"RG45\"/> On 11 November a Spanish squadron of four frigates attempted to disrupt operations, but a swift counterattack by Duckworth's ships drove them off. By 16 November the town of Ciudadella capitulated and control of the island was ceded to British forces.<ref name=\"WLC378\">Clowes, p. 378</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Cnote2 Begin|liststyle=upper-alpha}}\n{{Cnote2|Note A|'''Note A''': [[Richard Woodman]] suggests that Nelson deliberately allowed Bonaparte to sail from Toulon in order to have the opportunity to engage and destroy him at sea.<ref name=\"RW112\">Woodman, p. 112</ref> This is incorrect: as noted by [[Oliver Warner]], Nelson did not have the forces or the ability to intercept Bonaparte until 12 days after the French convoy had sailed.<ref name=\"OW50\">Warner, p. 50</ref> The same tactic has been suggested by historian Peter Padfield regarding [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]]'s intentions in the days before the [[Glorious First of June]] in 1794.<ref name=\"PP17\">Padfield, p. 17</ref>}}\n{{Cnote2 End}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=guelphmercury2018-01-01>\n{{cite news     \n| url         = https://www.guelphmercury.com/opinion-story/8027189-guelph-s-first-poet-played-bit-part-in-britain-s-war-with-napoleon/\n| title       = Guelph's first poet played bit part in Britain's war with Napoleon\n| work        = [[Guelph Mercury]]\n| author      = [[Ed Butts]]\n| date        = 2018-01-01\n| accessdate  = 2018-10-05\n| url-status     = live \n| quote       = On Aug. 22, the Alcmene intercepted the small French warship Legere.

Bharathiraja]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]. The film stars [[Kamal Haasan]], [[Sridevi]], and [[Rajinikanth]], with [[Ganthimathi]], Sathyajith and [[Goundamani]] in supporting roles. It focuses on the strengths and vulnerabilities of Mayil (Sridevi), a 16-year-old schoolgirl, and the challenges she faces and overcomes.\n\nThe film was originally titled ''Mayil'', and set to be funded by the [[National Film Development Corporation of India]]. When they backed out, it was picked up by S. A. Rajkannu who produced it under his banner Shri Amman Creations, and eventually retitled. ''16 Vayathinile'' became the first Tamil film to be shot completely outdoors; Tamil films were primarily filmed in [[Chennai]] studios. Its soundtrack album and background score were composed by [[Ilaiyaraaja]], with cinematography by [[P. S. Nivas]]. [[P. Kalaimani]] wrote the film's dialogue.\n\n''16 Vayathinile'' was released on 15 September 1977, and was distributed by Rajkannu himself since no distributor was willing to buy it. Although written off by the media as an [[experimental film]] that would fail, the film received critical praise for Bharathiraja's script, Ilaiyaraaja's music and the performances of Haasan, Sridevi and Rajinikanth. It was commercially successful, with a 175-day theatrical run. It won numerous awards, including the [[National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer]] for [[S. Janaki]]; the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Tamil)]] for Haasan and [[Filmfare Special Award&nbsp;\u2013 South|Special Commendation Award for Performance]] for Sridevi; and four [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards|State Awards]], including [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Bharathiraja and [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Haasan.\n\n''16 Vayathinile'' attained [[cult film|cult]] status in Tamil cinema and is considered to be the [[bellwether]] of films depicting realistic portrayals of rural life. Making stars of its director and lead actors, it was remade in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''[[Padaharella Vayasu]]'' (1978), in [[Hindi]] as ''[[Solva Sawan]]'' (1979), and in [[Malay language|Malay]] as ''Melati Putih'' (1984).\n\n== Plot ==\nMayil is a 16-year-old schoolgirl who lives in a village with Guruvammal, her mother. Guruvammal also takes care of a limping orphan who is dismissively called \"Chappani\" (Lame) by the villagers and does whatever he can to earn a living. Mayil's ambition is to become a teacher, and she hopes to marry a sophisticated, educated man; although Chappani is in love with her, she does not reciprocate his love.\n\nAn urban veterinarian named Sathyajith arrives in the village to work and falls in love with Mayil. Believing that Sathyajith is the right person for her, Mayil falls in love with him, to the point of refusing an opportunity to attend a teacher-training course in [[Chennai|Madras]] to remain with him. Despite loving Sathyajith, she does not allow him to exploit her sexually, which disappoints him. Never intending a serious relationship with Mayil, he proceeds to his native place to marry another woman. When Mayil begs Sathyajith not to leave her, he says he befriended her for pleasure\u2014not marriage.\n\nA dejected Mayil confesses about her relationship with Sathyajith to Guruvammal, who quickly plans to betroth her to someone else. The village ruffian Parattai\u2014who lusts for Mayil\u2014spreads rumours about her relationship with Sathyajith. Because of this, Mayil's engagement plans are halted and the village becomes hostile to her. Unable to bear the shame, Guruvammal dies and leaves Chappani to take care of Mayil.\n\nChappani takes good care of Mayil, cheering her up when she needs it. She warms to Chappani, making him more confident and assertive and grooming him and his manners, to the surprise of many in the village. Mayil tells him to slap anyone calling him \"Chappani\" and to respond only to those addressing him by his name, Gopalakrishnan. When Sathyajith and Parattai dismissively call him \"Chappani\", Gopalakrishnan slaps them. Mayil and Gopalakrishnan celebrate his newfound courage. An insulted Parattai later beats Gopalakrishnan badly. Mayil saves him and spits on Parattai in revenge.\n\nMayil decides to marry Gopalakrishnan, and sends him to the nearby town for buying wedding supplies. Learning of Gopalakrishnan's absence, Parattai goes to Mayil's house and tries to rape her. Gopalakrishnan returns to Mayil's house and pleads with Parattai to leave her. When Parattai refuses, Gopalakrishnan kills him with a rock and is arrested. He promises Mayil that he will return, and she waits everyday for him.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- AS PER THE OPENING CREDITS OF THE FILM -->\n* [[Kamal Haasan]] as Gopalakrishnan (Chappani)\n* [[Sridevi]] as Mayil\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Parattai\n* [[Ganthimathi]] as Kuruvammal\n* Sathyajith as Sathyajith\n* [[Goundamani]] as Koothu\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[P.

Bharathiraja]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]. The film stars [[Kamal Haasan]], [[Sridevi]], and [[Rajinikanth]], with [[Ganthimathi]], Sathyajith and [[Goundamani]] in supporting roles. It focuses on the strengths and vulnerabilities of Mayil (Sridevi), a 16-year-old schoolgirl, and the challenges she faces and overcomes.\n\nThe film was originally titled ''Mayil'', and set to be funded by the [[National Film Development Corporation of India]]. When they backed out, it was picked up by S. A. Rajkannu who produced it under his banner Shri Amman Creations, and eventually retitled. ''16 Vayathinile'' became the first Tamil film to be shot completely outdoors; Tamil films were primarily filmed in [[Chennai]] studios. Its soundtrack album and background score were composed by [[Ilaiyaraaja]], with cinematography by [[P. S. Nivas]]. [[P. Kalaimani]] wrote the film's dialogue.\n\n''16 Vayathinile'' was released on 15 September 1977, and was distributed by Rajkannu himself since no distributor was willing to buy it. Although written off by the media as an [[experimental film]] that would fail, the film received critical praise for Bharathiraja's script, Ilaiyaraaja's music and the performances of Haasan, Sridevi and Rajinikanth. It was commercially successful, with a 175-day theatrical run. It won numerous awards, including the [[National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer]] for [[S. Janaki]]; the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Tamil)]] for Haasan and [[Filmfare Special Award&nbsp;\u2013 South|Special Commendation Award for Performance]] for Sridevi; and four [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards|State Awards]], including [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Bharathiraja and [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Haasan.\n\n''16 Vayathinile'' attained [[cult film|cult]] status in Tamil cinema and is considered to be the [[bellwether]] of films depicting realistic portrayals of rural life. Making stars of its director and lead actors, it was remade in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''[[Padaharella Vayasu]]'' (1978), in [[Hindi]] as ''[[Solva Sawan]]'' (1979), and in [[Malay language|Malay]] as ''Melati Putih'' (1984).\n\n== Plot ==\nMayil is a 16-year-old schoolgirl who lives in a village with Guruvammal, her mother. Guruvammal also takes care of a limping orphan who is dismissively called \"Chappani\" (Lame) by the villagers and does whatever he can to earn a living. Mayil's ambition is to become a teacher, and she hopes to marry a sophisticated, educated man; although Chappani is in love with her, she does not reciprocate his love.\n\nAn urban veterinarian named Sathyajith arrives in the village to work and falls in love with Mayil. Believing that Sathyajith is the right person for her, Mayil falls in love with him, to the point of refusing an opportunity to attend a teacher-training course in [[Chennai|Madras]] to remain with him. Despite loving Sathyajith, she does not allow him to exploit her sexually, which disappoints him. Never intending a serious relationship with Mayil, he proceeds to his native place to get married to another woman. When Mayil begs Sathyajith not to leave her, he says he befriended her for pleasure\u2014not marriage.\n\nA dejected Mayil confesses about her relationship with Sathyajith to Guruvammal, who quickly plans to betroth her to someone else. The village ruffian Parattai\u2014who lusts for Mayil\u2014spreads rumours about her relationship with Sathyajith. Because of this, Mayil's engagement plans are halted and the village becomes hostile to her. Unable to bear the shame, Guruvammal dies and leaves Chappani to take care of Mayil.\n\nChappani takes good care of Mayil, cheering her up when she needs it. She warms to Chappani, making him more confident and assertive and grooming him and his manners, to the surprise of many in the village. Mayil tells him to slap anyone calling him \"Chappani\" and to respond only to those addressing him by his name, Gopalakrishnan. When Sathyajith and Parattai dismissively call him \"Chappani\", Gopalakrishnan slaps them. Mayil and Gopalakrishnan celebrate his newfound courage. An insulted Parattai later beats Gopalakrishnan badly. Mayil saves him and spits on Parattai in revenge.\n\nMayil decides to marry Gopalakrishnan, and sends him to the nearby town for buying wedding supplies. Learning of Gopalakrishnan's absence, Parattai goes to Mayil's house and tries to rape her. Gopalakrishnan returns to Mayil's house and pleads with Parattai to leave her. When Parattai refuses, Gopalakrishnan kills him with a rock and is arrested. He promises Mayil that he will return, and she waits everyday for him.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- AS PER THE OPENING CREDITS OF THE FILM -->\n* [[Kamal Haasan]] as Gopalakrishnan (Chappani)\n* [[Sridevi]] as Mayil\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Parattai\n* [[Ganthimathi]] as Kuruvammal\n* Sathyajith as Sathyajith\n* [[Goundamani]] as Koothu\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[P.

On that night, approximately 20,000 people packed into a ground that usually only held half that number to watch Luton beat Millwall 1\u20130.<ref name=\"The First 125 Years\"/> Numerous pitch invasions, fighting in the stands and missile-throwing occurred, of which one such object hit Luton's goalkeeper [[Les Sealey]].

Luton were asked by Millwall to make the Wednesday night match all-ticket, but this was ignored.<ref name=\"Japan Times\"/> As a result, rival hooligan firms gained access to the stadium.

Paphitis later introduced a membership scheme whereby only fans who would be prepared to join and carry membership cards would be allowed into The Den. Scotland Yard withdrew its threat to sue, stating: \"In light of the efforts made and a donation to a charity helping injured police officers, the Metropolitan Police Service has decided not to pursue legal action against Millwall F.C. in relation to the disorder\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2459365.stm |title=Met drops threat to sue Millwall |work=BBC Sport  |date=13 November 2002 |accessdate=25 August 2009}}</ref> Some legal experts said it would have been difficult to hold a football club responsible for something that occurred away from its ground and involved people who did not attend the match. The scheme introduced by Paphitis now only applies to perceived high-risk away games.

[[Bobby Robson]], then manager of Ipswich, said of Millwall fans afterward, \"They [the police] should have turned the [[flamethrower]]s on them\".<ref name=\"Millwall vs the Mob\"/> In 1982 Millwall club chairman Alan Thorne threatened to close the club because of violence sparked by losing in the FA Cup to non-league side [[Slough Town F.C.|Slough Town]].<ref name=\"The First 125 Years\"/><ref name=\"Japan Times\"/>\n\n===Kenilworth Road riot===\n{{Main|1985 Kenilworth Road riot}}\nThe [[1985 Kenilworth Road riot]], after an FA Cup sixth-round match between [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and Millwall on 13 March 1985, became one of the worst and widely reported incidents of football hooliganism to date. On that night, approximately 20,000 people packed into a ground that usually only held half that number to watch Luton beat Millwall 1\u20130.<ref name=\"The First 125 Years\"/> Numerous pitch invasions, fighting in the stands and missile-throwing occurred, of which one such object hit Luton's goalkeeper [[Les Sealey]]. It led to a ban on away supporters by Luton from their [[Kenilworth Road]] ground for four years. Luton were asked by Millwall to make the Wednesday night match all-ticket, but this was ignored.<ref name=\"Japan Times\"/> As a result, rival hooligan firms gained access to the stadium. As well as the Millwall hooligans and those belonging to Luton's firm the [[Luton Town MIGs|MIGs]], many of the 31 fans arrested after the violence were identified as being from Chelsea's [[Chelsea Headhunters|Headhunters]] firm and West Ham United's [[Inter City Firm]].<ref name=\"Japan Times\"/> The FA commissioned an inquiry which concluded that it was \"not satisfied that Millwall F.C. took all reasonable precautions in accordance with the requirements of FA Rule 31(A)(II).\" A \u00a37,500 fine was levied against Millwall, though this was later withdrawn on appeal.<ref name=\"appeal\">{{cite journal\n | date = 19 July 1985\n | title = FA lift penalties on Luton and Millwall; Successful appeal against riot decision\n |work=The Times |location=UK\n }}</ref> The penalty that Millwall faced was perhaps that the club's name was now \"synonymous with everything that was bad in football and society\".<ref name=\"fearandloathing\">{{cite book\n  | title=Fear and Loathing in World Football\n  | work=Berg Publishers\n  | first= Gary\n  | last= Armstrong\n  |author2=Giulianotti, Richard\n  |date=June 2001\n  | page=65\n  | isbn=1-85973-463-4}}</ref>\n\n===Birmingham play-off riot===\nIn May 2002, hundreds of hooligans attaching themselves to Millwall were involved in disorder around the ground, after the team lost a play-off game to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. It was described by the BBC as one of the worst cases of civil disorder seen in Britain in recent times. A police spokeswoman said that 47 police officers and 24 police horses were injured, and the Metropolitan Police considered suing the club after the events.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/1967510.stm |title=Four charged over Millwall violence |work=BBC Sport  |date=4 May 2002 |accessdate=25 August 2009}}</ref> The then chairman [[Theo Paphitis]] responded that Millwall could not be blamed for the actions of a mindless minority who attach themselves to the club. \"The problem of mob violence is not solely a Millwall problem, it is not a football problem, it is a problem which plagues the whole of our society\", he said. Paphitis later introduced a membership scheme whereby only fans who would be prepared to join and carry membership cards would be allowed into The Den. Scotland Yard withdrew its threat to sue, stating: \"In light of the efforts made and a donation to a charity helping injured police officers, the Metropolitan Police Service has decided not to pursue legal action against Millwall F.C. in relation to the disorder\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2459365.stm |title=Met drops threat to sue Millwall |work=BBC Sport  |date=13 November 2002 |accessdate=25 August 2009}}</ref> Some legal experts said it would have been difficult to hold a football club responsible for something that occurred away from its ground and involved people who did not attend the match. The scheme introduced by Paphitis now only applies to perceived high-risk away games. Many fans blame the scheme for diminishing Millwall's away support, such as at Leeds United where fans are issued with vouchers which are then exchanged for tickets at a designated point of [[West Yorkshire Police]]'s choosing on the day of the game. Also, early kick-off times arranged by the police often result in only a few hundred fans making the trip.<ref name=\"Police mount anti-hooligan operation\">{{cite web\n| title = Leeds United v Millwall: Police mount anti-hooligan operation\n| url = http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/Leeds-United-v-Millwall-Police.6484588.jp\n| work=Yorkshire Evening Post\n| accessdate =28 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Millwall v Leeds United\">{{cite web\n| title = Millwall v Leeds United: Police issue behaviour warning\n| work=Yorkshire Evening Post\n| url = http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/Millwall-v-Leeds-United-Police.5247915.jp\n| accessdate =28 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Upton Park riot===\n[[File:WestHamChampionsStatueMillWall.JPG|thumb|120px|right|The [[World Cup Sculpture]] near Upton Park was boarded-up for protection before the visit of [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in August 2009.]]{{main|2009 Upton Park riot}}\nThe most infamous recent example of the rivalry between Millwall and West Ham flaring up was when, in the [[2009\u201310 in English football|2009\u201310 season]], The Lions were drawn against The Hammers in the [[Football League Cup]].

It covers the area between [[Saltley]], [[Hodge Hill]] and [[Stechford, Birmingham|Stechford]] and includes Ward End Park, a public park that has been open for over 100 years.\n\n==Ward End territory==\n\n[[Pelham, Ward End|Pelham]] in Ward End joins with [[Alum Rock, Birmingham|Alum Rock]] in Saltley at the Railway Bridge on Alum Rock Road. Because the transition occurs on the same road, the two areas and their \"sub-areas\" are closely linked.\n\n==The Fox & Goose==\n\nThe [[Fox & Goose]], a pub and shopping area is situated in the eastern part of Ward End and marks the boundary with [[Stechford]] and [[Hodge Hill]].\n\n==Ward End Park==\n[[File:Ward End Park.jpg|thumb|right|Ward End Park]]\nThe park, opened in 1904, covers a large part of Ward End. A typical English park, it is heavily populated in the summer months. Ward End Park House is located within the park and dates back to 1759.\n\nThe park also has two large multi-sports practice courts, two professional cricket nets, two large play sections and a car park.\n\n==Secondary schools==\n\nThe secondary school which served this area from 1958 was Ward End Hall [[Secondary Modern]]; later known as Ward End Hall County Secondary School, before finally being renamed Park View Upper School in 1983 when it catered solely for 4th and 5th year senior pupils, and sixth-formers (or Year 10, 11, 12 and 13s as they are known these days). Park View Lower School was the name given to the next closest secondary school, Naseby, after the two schools amalgamated in the mid-1980s. However, whether it was due to lack of demand for places or just financial problems, the former Ward End Hall School was closed down and demolished in the mid-1990s. A housing estate now stands on the site of the former school. Park View School was renamed [[Rockwood Academy, Birmingham|Rockwood Academy]] in 2015. In addition to Rockwood Academy, there is a secondary education establishment quite locally at [[Washwood Heath]] ([[Washwood Heath Academy]]) and two more in [[Hodge Hill]] ([[Hodge Hill College]]; and [[Hodge Hill Girls' School]], a former [[grammar school]]).\n\n==Places of worship==\nThere are a number of places of worship in Ward End, including St Margarets Church, [[Christ Church, Ward End]] and Ward End Gospel church centre along with Emmanuel Christian Fellowship, led by the Rev. Steve Byrne and there are a large number of mosques, located on Ward End, Washwood Heath, Hodge Hill and Alum Rock Road or nearby.\n\n==Unusual events==\nSeveral unusual events have occurred in Ward End over the years.\n\nIn late-1981 and into 1982, the residents of five houses on [[Thornton Road poltergeist|Thornton Road]] informed the police that stones had been thrown against their windows at night. The stones had no fingerprints, so a night-time surveillance using [[infra-red]] cameras and [[Image intensifier|image-intensifiers]] was set up. The stone-throwing continued even though no human activity was seen. Eventually the Birmingham CID gave up and left the case open.\n\nIn late-2004 and early 2005, there were rumours that a man had [[Bite#Human bites|bitten several people]] on Glen Park Road; described as being black and in his mid-20s he was dubbed the \"Birmingham Vampire\". However the police had received no reports of any attack, and the hospitals had received no bite victims. The local press was inundated with calls from worried residents in Ward End and the surrounding area. The case has been dismissed as an [[urban legend]].<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/17/samjones</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Tarmac (a heavy building materials company) drew up a list of Britain's \"spookiest roads\", with Drews Lane in Ward End coming tenth.
