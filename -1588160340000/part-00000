The show is aimed at pre-school-aged children, which the company described as \"a natural next step for Aardman\".<ref name=\"licensing\"/>\n\nThe show is made up of ten-minute episodes, which do not feature much dialogue, much like ''[[Shaun the Sheep]]'' and ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]''. Shaun, his friends, Bitzer and the Farmer did not appear.<ref name=\"licensing\" /> A filming of one episode was featured on the [[Discovery Channel]]'s ''[[How It's Made]]''.\n\n==Elevator ==\n{{main|List of Timmy Time episodes}}\n{{:List of Timmy Time episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n* Timmy is a male lamb who is the titular character and enjoys being in the spotlight. He is three years old in sheep years and later turns four in the episode Timmy's Birthday. In many of the episodes he gets into trouble; however, he learns from his mistakes, and often tries to help the other characters out when he can. Timmy's noise is baaa. He is best friends with Yabba, and is very close to Finlay. He also appears in Shaun the Sheep.\n* Harriet is a female pelican who speaks through caws and clicks. She is one of the two teachers. Harriet's noise is squawk.\n* Osbourne is a male owl who is the other teacher of the class and the father to Otus.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Osbourne's noise is hoot-hoot.\n* Yabba is a female duckling who is very similar to Timmy in personality and is best friends with her. Yabba's noise is quack.\n* Paxton is a male piglet who is characterised by his appetite for apples and his weight. He wears a blue sweater and is never seen without it. Paxton's noise is oink.\n* Mittens is a female kitten who is like other kittens: she hates getting her fur dirty (or wet) and is rather sensitive. Mittens's noise is mee-ew-ew. In some episodes, she seems to have feelings for Timmy. She always loves playing with picnics.\n* Ruffy is a male puppy who is energetic but he can be mentally rather slow. Ruffy's noise is rowf.\n* Apricot is a female hedgehog who is very quiet and skittish. When startled or frightened by someone or something she rolls up into a ball. Apricot's noise is hicoooo, though she rarely speaks.\n* Stripey is a male badger cub who is a bit sleepy and slow as badgers are nocturnal. Stripey's noise is eh-eh.\n* Kid is a male goat who has a large appetite like Paxton, and chews anything in sight. If the thing he is chewing is taken from him he does not mind; he just moves on to something else. Kid's noise is meh.\n* Otus is a male owlet who enjoys helping and looks up to Osbourne. He can be typically found reading and is very sensitive, sometimes copying his father Osbourne. Otus is commonly confused to be female due to his feminine voice tone and pink and purple feathers. Otus's noise is too-hoo.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n* Finlay is a male fox kit who is excitable and full of energy.

He is three years old in sheep years and later turns four in the episode Timmy's Birthday. In many of the episodes he gets into trouble; however, he learns from his mistakes, and often tries to help the other characters out when he can. Timmy's noise is baaa. He is best friends with Yabba, and is very close to Finlay. He also appears in Shaun the Sheep.\n* Harriet is a female pelican who speaks through caws and clicks. She is one of the two teachers. Harriet's noise is squawk.\n* Osbourne is a male owl who is the other teacher of the class and the father to Otus.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Osbourne's noise is hoot-hoot.\n* Yabba is a female duckling who is very similar to Timmy in personality and is best friends with her. Yabba's noise is quack.\n* Paxton is a male piglet who is characterised by his appetite for apples and his weight. He wears a blue sweater and is never seen without it. Paxton's noise is oink.\n* Mittens is a female kitten who is like other kittens: she hates getting her fur dirty (or wet) and is rather sensitive. Mittens's noise is mee-ew-ew. In some episodes, she seems to have feelings for Timmy. She always loves playing with picnics.\n* Ruffy is a male puppy who is energetic but he can be mentally rather slow. Ruffy's noise is rowf.\n* Apricot is a female hedgehog who is very quiet and skittish. When startled or frightened by someone or something she rolls up into a ball. Apricot's noise is hicoooo, though she rarely speaks.\n* Stripey is a male badger cub who is a bit sleepy and slow as badgers are nocturnal. Stripey's noise is eh-eh.\n* Kid is a male goat who has a large appetite like Paxton, and chews anything in sight. If the thing he is chewing is taken from him he does not mind; he just moves on to something else. Kid's noise is meh.\n* Otus is a male owlet who enjoys helping and looks up to Osbourne. He can be typically found reading and is very sensitive, sometimes copying his father Osbourne. Otus is commonly confused to be female due to his feminine voice tone and pink and purple feathers. Otus's noise is too-hoo.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n* Finlay is a male fox kit who is excitable and full of energy. Finlay's noise is yip-yap.\n* Bumpy is a male green caterpillar who is not part of the class but has many background appearances in the show. Bumpy makes a soft purring noise.\n* Timmy's Mum is a female sheep who is also not part of the class, but does appear in the opening sequence, \"Timmy's Christmas Surprise\" and the end credits.

The battle was fought on 6 July 1782.<ref name=\"Castex269\">[[#Castex|Castex (2004)]], pp. 269\u2013272</ref> The battle was indecisive but Suffren was thwarted in his goal by Hughes and withdrew to [[Cuddalore]], while the British remained in control of Negapatam.<ref name=\"Fredriksen176\"/><ref name=\"Sweetman176\"/>\n\n== Background ==\nFrance had entered the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1778, and Britain declared war on the [[Dutch Republic]] in late 1780, after the Dutch refused to stop trading in military supplies with the French and the Americans. The British had rapidly gained control over most French and Dutch outposts in India when news of these events reached India, spawning the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]] in the process. [[Negapatam]] was [[Siege of Negapatam|sieged and taken]] by [[Hector Munro, 8th laird of Novar|Sir Hector Munro]] in November 1781.\n\nThe French admiral the Bailli de Suffren was dispatched on a mission to provide military assistance to French colonies in [[India]]. He arrived in February 1782, and immediately engaged the British fleet of Vice-Admiral Sir Edward Hughes in the inconclusive [[Battle of Sadras]]. After both fleets spent time in port repairing, refitting, and re-provisioning, they met again in the April [[Battle of Providien]], south of the [[Ceylon]]ese port of [[Trincomalee]], that was ended by a storm and then nightfall. Hughes put into Trincomalee, a formerly Dutch port the British [[Capture of Trincomalee|had captured]] in January, for repairs, while Suffren went to the Dutch-controlled port of [[Batticaloa]].\n\nWhile at Batticaloa, Suffren received dispatches from the \u00cele de France (now [[Mauritius]]) that ordered him to return there to escort additional French troops to India. He chose not to do so, citing the parity between the two fleets, and the need to defend French troops already on the ground in India against the movements of the British fleet.\n\nThe French, with about 2,000 effective troops under the command of Comte du Chemin, had captured [[Cuddalore]] on 6 May. [[Hyder Ali]], the ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], originally wanted the French to take the more important port of Negapatam. The French joined with Hyder's army of 60,000 to lay siege to the British at [[Vandavasi]]. When the British sent an army of 12,000 toward Vandavasi to relieve the siege, du Chemin, against the wishes of Hyder, refused to engage in a battle that the Franco-Mysorean force would probably have won (which would have significantly reduced the British military presence in India). As a result, Hyder lifted the siege and retreated to the vicinity of [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]].\n\nHyder Ali learned of Suffren's actions in the first two battles with Hughes, and sent a message to Suffren to arrange a meeting. Suffren had in the meantime sailed from Batticaloa to do the job that du Chemin would not: capture Negapatam. He stopped at Cuddalore on 20 June to take on troops and supplies for the attack, which he hoped to do by surprise. When he was ready to sail he learned that Hughes had sailed past, apparently also en route to Negapatam. As his fleet had grown by captured prizes and arrivals from \u00cele de France (it was now twelve [[ships of the line]] and four frigates), Suffren gave chase and caught up with Hughes, who had anchored off Negapatam, on 5 July.\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:SouthIndia1794.jpeg|thumb|right|Detail of a 1794 map of south India and Ceylon. Batticaloa is north of the southeastern point of Ceylon]]\n\nSuffren was in the process of forming his battle line around 3&nbsp;pm when a [[squall]] took down the main and mizzen top masts of [[French ship Ajax (1779)|''Ajax'']], under [[Ren\u00e9 Joseph Bouvet de Pr\u00e9court|Bouvet-Pr\u00e9court]], forcing her to drop out of his line.{{sfnp|Roche|2005|p=28}}  When the squall calmed, the breeze was to Hughes' advantage so he sailed from his anchorage at the harbour of Negapatam. The two fleets spent the night anchored two cannonshots apart.\n\nThe next morning, Suffren was infuriated to learn that repairs had not been made to ''Ajax'', and that her captain wanted to retreat. Given that battle was imminent, Suffren refused. He then ordered his line to bear down on the British line for close action. As they began to move, ''Ajax'' stood away and did not join the action. At 9:30&nbsp;am on 6 July, the fleets opened fire on each other, first at long range. ''Flamand'' engaged ''Hero'' and ''Exeter'', ''Annibal'' engaged ''Isis'', ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' faced ''Burford'', and ''Brillant'' opposed ''Sultan'' while the two flagships, ''H\u00e9ros'' and ''Superb'', did battle with each other. The remainder of the British line was not able to directly line up against the French, resulting in an angle in their line where ''Sphinx'' and ''Monarca'' battled that minimized the action between the ships at the end of the line. ''Flamand'' took significant damage, but was able to return the favour to its opponents. ''Brillant'' began to suffer under the fire of ''Sultan'', but Suffren managed to detach from ''H\u00e9ros'' to come to her rescue.\n\nThe battle proceeded with vigour until about 1&nbsp;pm, when the wind suddenly changed, throwing both lines into confusion. With the wind head-on to the two parallel lines of ships, some ships turned to starboard and some to port.<ref name=ClowesIIIp556>[[#Clowes|Clowes (Vol.III)]], p.556</ref> The majority turned away from the engagement but six ships, four British and two French, turned in towards one another. The four British ships were the fourth, fifth, eighth and tenth in line, respectively ''Burford'', ''Sultan'', ''Worcester'' and ''Eagle''; the two French were ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' (third in line) and towards the rear of the line ''Brillant'', which was dismasted by this stage. ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' was engaged by ''Sultan'' and \"two other ships\", and escaped through the arrival of Suffren in his flagship and the filling of her sails as she fell off to starboard, while ''Brillant'' was fired on by ''Worcester'' and ''Eagle'', and was also rescued by the approach of Suffren's ship, though not before the loss of over a third of her complement dead or wounded.<ref name=ClowesIIIp556/>\n\nWith occasional meetings between two ships, Hughes attempted to reform his line around 2&nbsp;pm, but neither fleet was in a state to adopt battle positions easily, so Suffren decided to draw away downwind, to the north, toward Cuddalore. One British observer noted that \"our fleet was utterly incapable of preventing or pursuing them\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moir |first1=John |title=Transactions in India |date=1786 |publisher=John Debrett |page=[https://archive.org/details/transactionsini01moirgoog/page/n477 470] |url=https://archive.org/details/transactionsini01moirgoog |accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSuffren had been thwarted in his efforts to take to Negapatam<ref name=\"Thomas153\"/> \u2013 he stripped M. Bouvet, the captain of ''Ajax'', of his command, and arrested three others for a variety of transgressions in this battle and the previous two. One of those arrested, M. de Cillart, commander of ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'', had started to [[striking the colors|strike his colors]] during one of the post-squall engagements, but his subordinates prevented the act.<ref name=\"Thomas153\"/> Suffren then sailed for Cuddalore to effect repairs. Hughes spent the next two weeks at sea, only returning to [[Chennai|Madras]] for repairs on 20 July. Negapatam would remain in British hands until the end of the war. At the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] the Dutch Republic would cede Negapatam to Britain.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|French line of battle {{sfnp|Cunat|1852|p=169}}\n|- valign=\"top\"|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n! width=12%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Ship </small>\n! width=15%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Rate </small>\n! width=5%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Guns </small>\n! width=5%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Navy </small>\n! width=22%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Commander </small>\n! width=15%; align= center colspan=3 | <small>Casualties</small>\n! width=25%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small>Notes</small>\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n! width=5%; align= center  | <small> Killed </small>\n! width=5%; align= center  | <small> Wounded </small>\n! width=5%; align= center  | <small> Total</small>\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| align= left    | ''[[French ship Flamand|Flamand]]''\n| align= center  | 54-gun\n| align= center  | 54\n| align= center  | [[File:Flag of the Kingdom of France (1814-1830).svg|45px|Ensign of the French Royal Navy]]\n| align= left    | Captain [[Louis-Hyacinte de Cavelier de Cuverville|de Cuverville]]\n| align= right   | 13\n| align= right   | 56\n| align= right   | 69 {{sfnp|Cunat|1852|p=171}}\n| align= left    |\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| align= left    | ''[[French ship Annibal (1779)|Annibal]]''\n| align= center  | [[74-gun]]\n| align= center  | 74\n| align= center  | [[File:Flag of the Kingdom of France (1814-1830).svg|45px|Ensign of the French Royal Navy]]\n| align= left    | Captain [[Bernard Boudin de Tromelin]]\n| align= right   | 28\n| align= right   | 80\n| align= right   | 108\n| align= left    | lieutenant de fr\u00e9gate de Rigny wounded {{sfnp|Cunat|1852|p=170}}\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| align= left    | [[French ship S\u00e9v\u00e8re (1778)|''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'']]\n| align= center  | 64-gun\n| align= center  | 64\n| align= center  | [[File:Flag of the Kingdom of France (1814-1830).svg|45px|Ensign of the French Royal Navy]]\n| align= left    | Captain [[Chevalier de Villeneuve-Cillart]]\n| align= right   |\n| align= right   |\n| align= right   |\n| align= left    | First Officer Chevalier de la Salle (capitaine de br\u00fblot) wounded.

The battle was fought on 6 July 1782.<ref name=\"Castex269\">[[#Castex|Castex (2004)]], pp. 269\u2013272</ref> The battle was indecisive but Suffren was thwarted in his goal by Hughes and withdrew to [[Cuddalore]], while the British remained in control of Negapatam.<ref name=\"Fredriksen176\"/><ref name=\"Sweetman176\"/>\n\n== Background ==\nFrance had entered the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1778, and Britain declared war on the [[Dutch Republic]] in late 1780, after the Dutch refused to stop trading in military supplies with the French and the Americans. The British had rapidly gained control over most French and Dutch outposts in India when news of these events reached India, spawning the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]] in the process. [[Negapatam]] was [[Siege of Negapatam|sieged and taken]] by [[Hector Munro, 8th laird of Novar|Sir Hector Munro]] in November 1781.\n\nThe French admiral the Bailli de Suffren was dispatched on a mission to provide military assistance to French colonies in [[India]]. He arrived in February 1782, and immediately engaged the British fleet of Vice-Admiral Sir Edward Hughes in the inconclusive [[Battle of Sadras]]. After both fleets spent time in port repairing, refitting, and re-provisioning, they met again in the April [[Battle of Providien]], south of the [[Ceylon]]ese port of [[Trincomalee]], that was ended by a storm and then nightfall. Hughes put into Trincomalee, a formerly Dutch port the British [[Capture of Trincomalee|had captured]] in January, for repairs, while Suffren went to the Dutch-controlled port of [[Batticaloa]].\n\nWhile at Batticaloa, Suffren received dispatches from the \u00cele de France (now [[Mauritius]]) that ordered him to return there to escort additional French troops to India. He chose not to do so, citing the parity between the two fleets, and the need to defend French troops already on the ground in India against the movements of the British fleet.\n\nThe French, with about 2,000 effective troops under the command of Comte du Chemin, had captured [[Cuddalore]] on 6 May. [[Hyder Ali]], the ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], originally wanted the French to take the more important port of Negapatam. The French joined with Hyder's army of 60,000 to lay siege to the British at [[Vandavasi]]. When the British sent an army of 12,000 toward Vandavasi to relieve the siege, du Chemin, against the wishes of Hyder, refused to engage in a battle that the Franco-Mysorean force would probably have won (which would have significantly reduced the British military presence in India). As a result, Hyder lifted the siege and retreated to the vicinity of [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]].\n\nHyder Ali learned of Suffren's actions in the first two battles with Hughes, and sent a message to Suffren to arrange a meeting. Suffren had in the meantime sailed from Batticaloa to do the job that du Chemin would not: capture Negapatam. He stopped at Cuddalore on 20 June to take on troops and supplies for the attack, which he hoped to do by surprise. When he was ready to sail he learned that Hughes had sailed past, apparently also en route to Negapatam. As his fleet had grown by captured prizes and arrivals from \u00cele de France (it was now twelve [[ships of the line]] and four frigates), Suffren gave chase and caught up with Hughes, who had anchored off Negapatam, on 5 July.\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:SouthIndia1794.jpeg|thumb|right|Detail of a 1794 map of south India and Ceylon. Batticaloa is north of the southeastern point of Ceylon]]\n\nSuffren was in the process of forming his battle line around 3&nbsp;pm when a [[squall]] took down the main and mizzen top masts of [[French ship Ajax (1779)|''Ajax'']], under [[Ren\u00e9 Joseph Bouvet de Pr\u00e9court|Bouvet-Pr\u00e9court]], forcing her to drop out of his line.{{sfnp|Roche|2005|p=28}}  When the squall calmed, the breeze was to Hughes' advantage so he sailed from his anchorage at the harbour of Negapatam. The two fleets spent the night anchored two cannonshots apart.\n\nThe next morning, Suffren was infuriated to learn that repairs had not been made to ''Ajax'', and that her captain wanted to retreat. Given that battle was imminent, Suffren refused. He then ordered his line to bear down on the British line for close action. As they began to move, ''Ajax'' stood away and did not join the action. At 9:30&nbsp;am on 6 July, the fleets opened fire on each other, first at long range. ''Flamand'' engaged ''Hero'' and ''Exeter'', ''Annibal'' engaged ''Isis'', ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' faced ''Burford'', and ''Brillant'' opposed ''Sultan'' while the two flagships, ''H\u00e9ros'' and ''Superb'', did battle with each other. The remainder of the British line was not able to directly line up against the French, resulting in an angle in their line where ''Sphinx'' and ''Monarca'' battled that minimized the action between the ships at the end of the line. ''Flamand'' took significant damage, but was able to return the favour to its opponents. ''Brillant'' began to suffer under the fire of ''Sultan'', but Suffren managed to detach from ''H\u00e9ros'' to come to her rescue.\n\nThe battle proceeded with vigour until about 1&nbsp;pm, when the wind suddenly changed, throwing both lines into confusion. With the wind head-on to the two parallel lines of ships, some ships turned to starboard and some to port.<ref name=ClowesIIIp556>[[#Clowes|Clowes (Vol.III)]], p.556</ref> The majority turned away from the engagement but six ships, four British and two French, turned in towards one another. The four British ships were the fourth, fifth, eighth and tenth in line, respectively ''Burford'', ''Sultan'', ''Worcester'' and ''Eagle''; the two French were ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' (third in line) and towards the rear of the line ''Brillant'', which was dismasted by this stage. ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' was engaged by ''Sultan'' and \"two other ships\", and escaped through the arrival of Suffren in his flagship and the filling of her sails as she fell off to starboard, while ''Brillant'' was fired on by ''Worcester'' and ''Eagle'', and was also rescued by the approach of Suffren's ship, though not before the loss of over a third of her complement dead or wounded.<ref name=ClowesIIIp556/>\n\nWith occasional meetings between two ships, Hughes attempted to reform his line around 2&nbsp;pm, but neither fleet was in a state to adopt battle positions easily, so Suffren decided to draw away downwind, to the north, toward Cuddalore. One British observer noted that \"our fleet was utterly incapable of preventing or pursuing them\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moir |first1=John |title=Transactions in India |date=1786 |publisher=John Debrett |page=[https://archive.org/details/transactionsini01moirgoog/page/n477 470] |url=https://archive.org/details/transactionsini01moirgoog |accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSuffren had been thwarted in his efforts to take to Negapatam<ref name=\"Thomas153\"/> \u2013 he stripped M. Bouvet, the captain of ''Ajax'', of his command, and arrested three others for a variety of transgressions in this battle and the previous two. One of those arrested, M. de Cillart, commander of ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'', had started to [[striking the colors|strike his colors]] during one of the post-squall engagements, but his subordinates prevented the act.<ref name=\"Thomas153\"/> Suffren then sailed for Cuddalore to effect repairs. Hughes spent the next two weeks at sea, only returning to [[Chennai|Madras]] for repairs on 20 July. Negapatam would remain in British hands until the end of the war.

From 1980, eight teams competed. In 1996 the tournament expanded to 16 teams, since it was easier for European nations to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] than their own continental championship; 14 of the 24 teams at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] World Cups had been European, whereas the European Championship finals still involved only eight teams.\n\nFor 2016, the competition has increased to 24 teams. In 2007, there was much discussion about an expansion of the tournament to 24 teams, started by [[Scotland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]], due to the increased number of football associations in Europe after the break-ups of [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and the inclusion of [[Israel national football team|Israel]] and [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]]. The new president of [[UEFA]], [[Michel Platini]], was reported to be in favour of expansion which proved an accurate assumption. Whilst on 17 April 2007, UEFA's Executive Committee formally decided against expansion in 2012, Platini indicated in June 2008 that UEFA will increase participation from 16 to 24 teams in future tournaments, starting from 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7479293.stm |title=Uefa sets deadline over Euro 2012 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=28 June 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref> On 25 September, it was announced by [[Franz Beckenbauer]] that an agreement had been reached, and the expansion to 24 teams would be officially announced the next day.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7636495.stm |title=Uefa to expand Euro Championship |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=26 September 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe competing teams are chosen by a series of qualifying games: in [[1960 European Nations' Cup|1960]] and [[1964 European Nations' Cup|1964]] through home and away [[Playoffs#Association football|play-offs]]; from [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968]] through a combination of both [[Tournament#Group tournaments|qualifying groups]] and play-off games. The host country was selected from the four finalists after they were determined through qualifying.\n\nSince the expansion of the final tournament starting from [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980]], the host country, or countries, have been chosen beforehand and qualify automatically.\n\n===Qualifying===\n{{Main|UEFA European Championship qualifying}}\nTo qualify, a team must finish in one of the qualifying spots or win a play-off. After this, a team proceeds to the finals round in the host country, although hosts qualify for the tournament automatically. The qualifying phase begins in the autumn after the preceding FIFA World Cup, almost two years before the finals.\n\nThe groups for qualification are drawn by a UEFA committee using [[Seed (sports)|seeding]]. Seeded teams include reigning champions, and other teams on the basis of their performance in the preceding FIFA World Cup qualifying and the last European Championship qualifying. To obtain an accurate view of the teams abilities, a ranking is produced. This is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular team and dividing it by the number of games played, i.e. points per game. In the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous competitions and therefore having qualified automatically, only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used. If two teams have equal points per game, the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on:\n\n# Coefficient from the matches played in its most recent qualifying competition.\n# Average goal difference.\n# Average number of goals scored.\n# Average number of away goals scored.\n# Drawing of lots.\n\nThe qualifying phase is played in a group format, the composition of the groups is determined through means of a draw of teams from pre-defined seeded bowls. The draw takes place after the preceding World Cup's qualifying competition. For [[UEFA Euro 2020]], the group qualifying phase consisted of ten groups; five of six teams and the remainder of five teams each.\n\nEach group is played in a league format with teams playing each other home and away. The top two teams then qualified for the final tournament, with remaining places decided by playoffs depending on their ranking in the [[UEFA Nations League]]. As with most leagues, [[Three points for a win|the points are awarded as three for a win]], one for a draw, and none for a loss. In the eventuality of one or more teams having equal points after all matches have been played, the following criteria are used to distinguish the sides:\n\n# Higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Results of all group matches:\n## Superior goal difference\n## Higher number of goals scored\n## Higher number of goals scored away from home\n## Fair play conduct.\n# Drawing of lots.\n\n===Final tournament===\nSixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 tournament]]. They were joint hosts [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], the winners and the highest ranked second placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups. These sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The groups were drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding. The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, subject to qualification, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous [[FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifying]]. Other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw, using [[UEFA coefficient|coefficients]] as a basis.\n\nFor the 2016 tournament, the expansion to 24 teams means that the teams will be drawn into six groups of four, with the six group winners, six group runners-up and the four best third-placed teams advancing to the round of 16 when it becomes a knockout competition.<ref name=\"regulations 2016\"/>\n\nThe groups are again played in a league format, where a team plays its opponents once each. The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progresses to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]] are employed to separate the two teams.

Though there is no longer a [[third place play-off]], UEFA decided in the 2008 edition to award the semi-final losers (Turkey and Russia) bronze medals for the first time,<ref>{{cite web |title=Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2006/08 |url=http://www.uefa.com/newsfiles/19079.pdf |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=11 July 2016 |location=2.08 |page=3 |format=PDF}}</ref> and did the same in the 2012 edition when Germany and Portugal received bronze medals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2010\u201312 |url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/competitions/euro/91/87/57/918757_download.pdf |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=4 July 2012 |location=3.08 |page=4 |format=PDF}}</ref> However, UEFA decided that losing semi-finalists would no longer receive medals from the 2016 edition onwards.<ref name=\"regulations 2016\">{{cite web |title=Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2014\u201316 |url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/uefaorg/Regulations/02/03/92/81/2039281_DOWNLOAD.pdf |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=2 September 2016 |location=4.08 |page=11 |format=PDF}}</ref> Bronze medals were previously awarded for winners of the third place play-off, the last of which was held in 1980.\n\n==Format==\n\n===The competition===\nBefore 1980, only four teams qualified for the final tournament. From 1980, eight teams competed. In 1996 the tournament expanded to 16 teams, since it was easier for European nations to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] than their own continental championship; 14 of the 24 teams at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] World Cups had been European, whereas the European Championship finals still involved only eight teams.\n\nFor 2016, the competition has increased to 24 teams. In 2007, there was much discussion about an expansion of the tournament to 24 teams, started by [[Scotland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]], due to the increased number of football associations in Europe after the break-ups of [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and the inclusion of [[Israel national football team|Israel]] and [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]]. The new president of [[UEFA]], [[Michel Platini]], was reported to be in favour of expansion which proved an accurate assumption. Whilst on 17 April 2007, UEFA's Executive Committee formally decided against expansion in 2012, Platini indicated in June 2008 that UEFA will increase participation from 16 to 24 teams in future tournaments, starting from 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7479293.stm |title=Uefa sets deadline over Euro 2012 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=28 June 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref> On 25 September, it was announced by [[Franz Beckenbauer]] that an agreement had been reached, and the expansion to 24 teams would be officially announced the next day.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7636495.stm |title=Uefa to expand Euro Championship |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=26 September 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe competing teams are chosen by a series of qualifying games: in [[1960 European Nations' Cup|1960]] and [[1964 European Nations' Cup|1964]] through home and away [[Playoffs#Association football|play-offs]]; from [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968]] through a combination of both [[Tournament#Group tournaments|qualifying groups]] and play-off games. The host country was selected from the four finalists after they were determined through qualifying.\n\nSince the expansion of the final tournament starting from [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980]], the host country, or countries, have been chosen beforehand and qualify automatically.\n\n===Qualifying===\n{{Main|UEFA European Championship qualifying}}\nTo qualify, a team must finish in one of the qualifying spots or win a play-off. After this, a team proceeds to the finals round in the host country, although hosts qualify for the tournament automatically. The qualifying phase begins in the autumn after the preceding FIFA World Cup, almost two years before the finals.\n\nThe groups for qualification are drawn by a UEFA committee using [[Seed (sports)|seeding]]. Seeded teams include reigning champions, and other teams on the basis of their performance in the preceding FIFA World Cup qualifying and the last European Championship qualifying. To obtain an accurate view of the teams abilities, a ranking is produced. This is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular team and dividing it by the number of games played, i.e. points per game. In the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous competitions and therefore having qualified automatically, only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used. If two teams have equal points per game, the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on:\n\n# Coefficient from the matches played in its most recent qualifying competition.\n# Average goal difference.\n# Average number of goals scored.\n# Average number of away goals scored.\n# Drawing of lots.\n\nThe qualifying phase is played in a group format, the composition of the groups is determined through means of a draw of teams from pre-defined seeded bowls. The draw takes place after the preceding World Cup's qualifying competition. For [[UEFA Euro 2020]], the group qualifying phase consisted of ten groups; five of six teams and the remainder of five teams each.\n\nEach group is played in a league format with teams playing each other home and away. The top two teams then qualified for the final tournament, with remaining places decided by playoffs depending on their ranking in the [[UEFA Nations League]]. As with most leagues, [[Three points for a win|the points are awarded as three for a win]], one for a draw, and none for a loss. In the eventuality of one or more teams having equal points after all matches have been played, the following criteria are used to distinguish the sides:\n\n# Higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Results of all group matches:\n## Superior goal difference\n## Higher number of goals scored\n## Higher number of goals scored away from home\n## Fair play conduct.\n# Drawing of lots.\n\n===Final tournament===\nSixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 tournament]]. They were joint hosts [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], the winners and the highest ranked second placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups. These sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The groups were drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding. The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, subject to qualification, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous [[FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifying]]. Other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw, using [[UEFA coefficient|coefficients]] as a basis.\n\nFor the 2016 tournament, the expansion to 24 teams means that the teams will be drawn into six groups of four, with the six group winners, six group runners-up and the four best third-placed teams advancing to the round of 16 when it becomes a knockout competition.<ref name=\"regulations 2016\"/>\n\nThe groups are again played in a league format, where a team plays its opponents once each. The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progresses to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]] are employed to separate the two teams. Unlike the [[FIFA World Cup]], this tournament no longer has a [[third place playoff]].\n\n==Results==\n{{See also|List of UEFA European Championship finals}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;

The investigations were done in August and September 2018. Speaking with facility mental health clinicians and program directors, they reported that separated children exhibited \"fear, feelings of abandonment, and post-traumatic stress\" with some children exhibiting acute symptoms of grief such as crying inconsolably.

These [[Latin-script alphabet]]s may discard letters, like the [[Rotokas alphabet]] or add new letters, like the [[Danish orthography|Danish]] and [[Norwegian orthography|Norwegian]] alphabets. [[Letter (alphabet)|Letter]] shapes have evolved over the centuries, including the development in [[Medieval Latin]] of [[lower-case]], forms which did not exist in the Classical period alphabet.\n\n== Evolution ==\nDue to its use in writing Germanic, Romance and other languages first in Europe and then in other parts of the world and due to its use in [[Romanization|Romanizing]] writing of other languages, it has become widespread (see [[Latin script]]). It is also used officially in China (separate from its [[ideographic]] writing) and has been adopted by Baltic and some Slavic states.  \n\nThe Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar [[Etruscan alphabet]], which evolved from the [[Cumae alphabet|Cumaean Greek version]] of the [[Greek alphabet]], which was itself descended from the [[Phoenician alphabet]], which in turn derived from [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]].<ref>Michael C. Howard (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=6QPWXrCCzBIC&pg=PA23 Transnationalism in Ancient and Medieval Societies. p. 23].</ref> The [[Etruscans]] [[History of Rome#Etruscan dominance|ruled early Rome]]; their alphabet evolved in Rome over successive centuries to produce the Latin alphabet.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], the Latin alphabet was used (sometimes with modifications) for writing [[Romance languages]], which are direct descendants of [[Latin]], as well as [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and some [[Slavic languages]]. With the [[First wave of European colonization|age of colonialism]] and [[Christian evangelism]], the [[Latin script]] spread beyond [[Europe]], coming into use for writing indigenous [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|American]], [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] and [[Languages of Africa|African languages]]. More recently, [[linguistics|linguists]] have also tended to prefer the Latin script or the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (itself largely based on the Latin script) when transcribing or creating written standards for non-European languages, such as the [[African reference alphabet]].\n\n===Diacritics===\nAlthough it does not seem that classical Latin used [[diacritic]]s (accents etc), modern English is the only major modern [[Languages of Europe|European language]] that does not have any for native words.{{NoteTag|A [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] may be seen in words such as \"co\u00f6peration\", though this is unusual.

This scheme has continued to be used by most modern European languages that have adopted the Latin alphabet. For the Latin sounds represented by the various letters see [[Latin spelling and pronunciation]]; for the names of the letters in English see [[English alphabet]].\n\n[[diacritic mark|Diacritics]] were not regularly used, but they did occur sometimes, the most common being the [[apex (diacritic)|apex]] used to mark [[long vowel]]s, which had previously sometimes been written doubled. However, in place of taking an apex, the letter i was written [[long i|taller]]: {{angle bracket|{{sm|\u00e1 \u00e9 \ua7fe \u00f3 v\u0301}}}}. For example, what is today transcribed ''L\u016bci\u012b a f\u012bli\u012b'' was written {{angle bracket|{{sm|lv\u0301ci\ua7fe\u00b7a\u00b7f\ua7feli\ua7fe}}}} in the inscription depicted.\n\nThe primary mark of punctuation was the [[interpunct]], which was used as a [[word divider]], though it fell out of use after 200 AD.\n\n[[Old Roman cursive]] script, also called [[majuscule]] cursive and capitalis cursive, was the everyday form of handwriting used for writing letters, by merchants writing business accounts, by schoolchildren learning the Latin alphabet, and even [[Roman Emperor|emperors]] issuing commands. A more formal style of writing was based on [[Roman square capitals]], but cursive was used for quicker, informal writing. It was most commonly used from about the 1st century BC to the 3rd century, but it probably existed earlier than that. It led to [[Uncial script|Uncial]], a [[majuscule]] script commonly used from the 3rd to 8th centuries AD by Latin and Greek scribes.\n\n[[New Roman cursive]] script, also known as [[lower case|minuscule]] cursive, was in use from the 3rd century to the 7th century, and uses letter forms that are more recognizable to modern eyes; {{angle bracket|a}}, {{angle bracket|b}}, {{angle bracket|d}}, and {{angle bracket|e}} had taken a more familiar shape, and the other letters were proportionate to each other. This script evolved into the medieval scripts known as [[Merovingian script|Merovingian]] and [[Carolingian minuscule]].\n\n===Medieval and later developments===\n[[File:Ioanne Arnoldo 1541.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|''De chalcographiae inventione'' (1541, [[Mainz]]) with the 23 letters.

Prior to that, the former had been merely [[Allography|allographs]] of the latter.{{CN|date=July 2018}}\n\nWith the fragmentation of political power, the [[Palaeography|style of writing]] changed and varied greatly throughout the Middle Ages, even after the invention of the [[printing press]]. Early deviations from the classical forms were the [[uncial script]], a development of the [[Old Roman cursive]], and various so-called minuscule scripts that developed from [[New Roman cursive]], of which the [[Carolingian minuscule]] was the most influential, introducing the [[lower case]] forms of the letters, as well as other writing conventions that have since become standard.\n\nThe languages that use the [[Latin script]] generally use [[capital letters]] to begin paragraphs and sentences and [[Noun#Proper nouns and common nouns|proper nouns]]. The rules for [[capitalization]] have changed over time, and different languages have varied in their rules for capitalization. [[Old English language|Old English]], for example, was rarely written with even proper nouns capitalized, whereas [[Modern English]] writers and printers of the 17th and 18th century frequently capitalized most and sometimes all nouns,<ref>{{cite web |url = https://books.google.fi/books?id=Kh_RZhvHk0YC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22as+is+done+systematically+in+modern+German%22&f=false |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language|first=David|last=Crystal|date=4 August 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref> which is still systematically done in Modern [[German language|German]], e.g. in the preamble and all of the United States Constitution: ''We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.''\n\n===Spread===\n{{Main|Spread of the Latin script}}\n\n[[File:Latin alphabet world distribution.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|This map shows the countries in the world that use only language(s) predominantly written in a Latin alphabet as the official (or de facto official) national language(s) in dark green.

The [[Byzantine Empire|eastern half of the Empire]], including [[Greece]], [[Anatolia]], the [[Levant]], and [[Egypt]], continued to use [[Greek language|Greek]] as a [[lingua franca]], but Latin was widely spoken in the [[Western Roman Empire|western half]], and as the western [[Romance languages]] evolved out of Latin, they continued to use and adapt the Latin alphabet.\n\nWith the spread of [[Western Christianity]] during the [[Middle Ages]], the script was gradually adopted by the peoples of [[northern Europe]] who spoke [[Insular Celtic languages|Celtic languages]] (displacing the [[Ogham]] alphabet) or [[Germanic languages]] (displacing earlier [[Runes|Runic alphabets]]), [[Baltic languages]], as well as by the speakers of several [[Uralic languages]], most notably [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. The Latin alphabet came into use for writing the [[West Slavic languages]] and several [[South Slavic languages]], as the people who spoke them adopted [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].\n\nLater, it was adopted by non-Catholic countries. [[Romanian language|Romanian]], most of whose speakers are [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], was the first major language to switch from [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] to Latin script, doing so in the 19th century, although [[Moldova]] only did so after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet collapse]].\n\nIt has also been increasingly adopted by [[Turkic languages|Turkic-speaking]] countries, beginning with [[Turkey]] in the 1920s. After the Soviet collapse, [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] all switched from Cyrillic to Latin. The government of [[Kazakhstan]] announced in 2015 that the Latin alphabet would replace Cyrillic as the writing system for the Kazakh language by 2025.<ref>[http://www.inform.kz/eng/article/2741711 Kazakh language to be converted to Latin alphabet \u2013 MCS RK].

These [[Latin-script alphabet]]s may discard letters, like the [[Rotokas alphabet]] or add new letters, like the [[Danish orthography|Danish]] and [[Norwegian orthography|Norwegian]] alphabets. [[Letter (alphabet)|Letter]] shapes have evolved over the centuries, including the development in [[Medieval Latin]] of [[lower-case]], forms which did not exist in the Classical period alphabet.\n\n== Evolution ==\nDue to its use in writing Germanic, Romance and other languages first in Europe and then in other parts of the world and due to its use in [[Romanization|Romanizing]] writing of other languages, it has become widespread (see [[Latin script]]). It is also used officially in China (separate from its [[ideographic]] writing) and has been adopted by Baltic and some Slavic states.  \n\nThe Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar [[Etruscan alphabet]], which evolved from the [[Cumae alphabet|Cumaean Greek version]] of the [[Greek alphabet]], which was itself descended from the [[Phoenician alphabet]], which in turn derived from [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]].<ref>Michael C. Howard (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=6QPWXrCCzBIC&pg=PA23 Transnationalism in Ancient and Medieval Societies. p. 23].</ref> The [[Etruscans]] [[History of Rome#Etruscan dominance|ruled early Rome]]; their alphabet evolved in Rome over successive centuries to produce the Latin alphabet.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], the Latin alphabet was used (sometimes with modifications) for writing [[Romance languages]], which are direct descendants of [[Latin]], as well as [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and some [[Slavic languages]]. With the [[First wave of European colonization|age of colonialism]] and [[Christian evangelism]], the [[Latin script]] spread beyond [[Europe]], coming into use for writing indigenous [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|American]], [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] and [[Languages of Africa|African languages]]. More recently, [[linguistics|linguists]] have also tended to prefer the Latin script or the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (itself largely based on the Latin script) when transcribing or creating written standards for non-European languages, such as the [[African reference alphabet]].\n\n===Diacritics===\nAlthough it does not seem that classical Latin used [[diacritic]]s (accents etc), modern English is the only major modern [[Languages of Europe|European language]] that does not have any for native words.{{NoteTag|A [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] may be seen in words such as \"co\u00f6peration\", though this is unusual.

The letter {{angle bracket|K}} was used only rarely, in a small number of words such as ''[[Kalends|Kalendae]]'', often interchangeably with {{angle bracket|C}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Old Latin alphabet\n|-\n!Letter || A || B || C || D || E || F || G || H || I || K || L || M || N || O || P || Q || R || S || T || V || X \n|}\n\n====Classical Latin alphabet====\n[[File:Inscription displaying apices (from the shrine of the Augustales at Herculaneum).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Apex (diacritic)|apices]] in this first-century inscription are very light.

An attempt by the emperor [[Claudius]] to introduce three [[Claudian letters|additional letters]] did not last.

This scheme has continued to be used by most modern European languages that have adopted the Latin alphabet. For the Latin sounds represented by the various letters see [[Latin spelling and pronunciation]]; for the names of the letters in English see [[English alphabet]].\n\n[[diacritic mark|Diacritics]] were not regularly used, but they did occur sometimes, the most common being the [[apex (diacritic)|apex]] used to mark [[long vowel]]s, which had previously sometimes been written doubled. However, in place of taking an apex, the letter i was written [[long i|taller]]: {{angle bracket|{{sm|\u00e1 \u00e9 \ua7fe \u00f3 v\u0301}}}}. For example, what is today transcribed ''L\u016bci\u012b a f\u012bli\u012b'' was written {{angle bracket|{{sm|lv\u0301ci\ua7fe\u00b7a\u00b7f\ua7feli\ua7fe}}}} in the inscription depicted.\n\nThe primary mark of punctuation was the [[interpunct]], which was used as a [[word divider]], though it fell out of use after 200 AD.\n\n[[Old Roman cursive]] script, also called [[majuscule]] cursive and capitalis cursive, was the everyday form of handwriting used for writing letters, by merchants writing business accounts, by schoolchildren learning the Latin alphabet, and even [[Roman Emperor|emperors]] issuing commands. A more formal style of writing was based on [[Roman square capitals]], but cursive was used for quicker, informal writing. It was most commonly used from about the 1st century BC to the 3rd century, but it probably existed earlier than that. It led to [[Uncial script|Uncial]], a [[majuscule]] script commonly used from the 3rd to 8th centuries AD by Latin and Greek scribes.\n\n[[New Roman cursive]] script, also known as [[lower case|minuscule]] cursive, was in use from the 3rd century to the 7th century, and uses letter forms that are more recognizable to modern eyes; {{angle bracket|a}}, {{angle bracket|b}}, {{angle bracket|d}}, and {{angle bracket|e}} had taken a more familiar shape, and the other letters were proportionate to each other. This script evolved into the medieval scripts known as [[Merovingian script|Merovingian]] and [[Carolingian minuscule]].\n\n===Medieval and later developments===\n[[File:Ioanne Arnoldo 1541.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|''De chalcographiae inventione'' (1541, [[Mainz]]) with the 23 letters. [[J]], [[U]] and [[W]] are missing.]]\n[[File:Rekenaar 1553.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Jeton]] from [[Nuremberg]], {{circa|1553}}]]\n\nIt was not until the [[Middle Ages]] that the letter {{angle bracket|[[W]]}} (originally a [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] of two {{angle bracket|[[V]]}}s) was added to the Latin alphabet, to represent sounds from the [[Germanic language]]s which did not exist in medieval Latin, and only after the [[Renaissance]] did the convention of treating {{angle bracket|[[I]]}} and {{angle bracket|[[U]]}} as [[vowel]]s, and {{angle bracket|[[J]]}} and {{angle bracket|[[V]]}} as [[consonant]]s, become established. Prior to that, the former had been merely [[Allography|allographs]] of the latter.{{CN|date=July 2018}}\n\nWith the fragmentation of political power, the [[Palaeography|style of writing]] changed and varied greatly throughout the Middle Ages, even after the invention of the [[printing press]]. Early deviations from the classical forms were the [[uncial script]], a development of the [[Old Roman cursive]], and various so-called minuscule scripts that developed from [[New Roman cursive]], of which the [[Carolingian minuscule]] was the most influential, introducing the [[lower case]] forms of the letters, as well as other writing conventions that have since become standard.\n\nThe languages that use the [[Latin script]] generally use [[capital letters]] to begin paragraphs and sentences and [[Noun#Proper nouns and common nouns|proper nouns]]. The rules for [[capitalization]] have changed over time, and different languages have varied in their rules for capitalization. [[Old English language|Old English]], for example, was rarely written with even proper nouns capitalized, whereas [[Modern English]] writers and printers of the 17th and 18th century frequently capitalized most and sometimes all nouns,<ref>{{cite web |url = https://books.google.fi/books?id=Kh_RZhvHk0YC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22as+is+done+systematically+in+modern+German%22&f=false |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language|first=David|last=Crystal|date=4 August 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref> which is still systematically done in Modern [[German language|German]], e.g. in the preamble and all of the United States Constitution: ''We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.''\n\n===Spread===\n{{Main|Spread of the Latin script}}\n\n[[File:Latin alphabet world distribution.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|This map shows the countries in the world that use only language(s) predominantly written in a Latin alphabet as the official (or de facto official) national language(s) in dark green. The lighter green indicates the countries that use a language predominantly written in a Latin alphabet as a co-official language at the national level.]]\n\nThe Latin alphabet spread, along with the [[Latin|Latin language]], from the [[Italian Peninsula]] to the lands surrounding the [[Mediterranean Sea]] with the expansion of the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Byzantine Empire|eastern half of the Empire]], including [[Greece]], [[Anatolia]], the [[Levant]], and [[Egypt]], continued to use [[Greek language|Greek]] as a [[lingua franca]], but Latin was widely spoken in the [[Western Roman Empire|western half]], and as the western [[Romance languages]] evolved out of Latin, they continued to use and adapt the Latin alphabet.\n\nWith the spread of [[Western Christianity]] during the [[Middle Ages]], the script was gradually adopted by the peoples of [[northern Europe]] who spoke [[Insular Celtic languages|Celtic languages]] (displacing the [[Ogham]] alphabet) or [[Germanic languages]] (displacing earlier [[Runes|Runic alphabets]]), [[Baltic languages]], as well as by the speakers of several [[Uralic languages]], most notably [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. The Latin alphabet came into use for writing the [[West Slavic languages]] and several [[South Slavic languages]], as the people who spoke them adopted [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].\n\nLater, it was adopted by non-Catholic countries. [[Romanian language|Romanian]], most of whose speakers are [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], was the first major language to switch from [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] to Latin script, doing so in the 19th century, although [[Moldova]] only did so after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet collapse]].\n\nIt has also been increasingly adopted by [[Turkic languages|Turkic-speaking]] countries, beginning with [[Turkey]] in the 1920s. After the Soviet collapse, [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] all switched from Cyrillic to Latin. The government of [[Kazakhstan]] announced in 2015 that the Latin alphabet would replace Cyrillic as the writing system for the Kazakh language by 2025.<ref>[http://www.inform.kz/eng/article/2741711 Kazakh language to be converted to Latin alphabet \u2013 MCS RK].

In July 1997, he was convicted of [[terrorism]] ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' by a Yugoslav court. After several unsuccessful attempts to capture or kill him, Serbian police launched [[Attack on Prekaz|an attack]] against Jashari's home in Prekaz in March 1998.

Attempting to capture or kill him, Serbian police surrounded Jashari and his older brother, Ham\u00ebz, at their home in Prekaz on 30 December 1991. In the ensuing siege, large numbers of Kosovo Albanians flocked to Prekaz, pressuring the police to withdraw from the village.{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=142}}\n\nWhile in Albania, he was arrested in 1993 by the government of [[Sali Berisha]] and sent to jail in [[Tirana]]{{sfn|Pettifer|Vickers|2007|p=113}} before being released alongside other Kosovo Albanian militants at the demand of the [[Albanian Army]].{{sfn|Pettifer|Vickers|2007|pp=98\u201399}} With the Yugoslav forces now considering Prekaz a \"no-go\" area, Jashari launched several attacks over the next several years.

Human Rights Watch noted that \"special police forces attacked without warning, firing indiscriminately at women, children and other noncombatants.\" KLA members and their families subsequently fled to Jashari's compound. Here, the police invited Jashari to surrender, giving him a deadline of two hours in which to respond.

In one of the houses, where most of Jashari's extended family had gathered, a mortar shell fell in through the roof, causing many deaths.

In July 1997, he was convicted of [[terrorism]] ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' by a Yugoslav court. After several unsuccessful attempts to capture or kill him, Serbian police launched [[Attack on Prekaz|an attack]] against Jashari's home in Prekaz in March 1998.

Prior to the [[Kosovo War]], the government of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] considered it \"the hotbed of Albanian terrorism.\"{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1998|p=18}} Jashari was a farmer.{{sfn|Watson|2009|p=193}}  In 1991, he participated in an armed uprising against the Yugoslav authorities in Kosovo.{{sfn|Elsie|2011|p=32}} During this period, a Kosovo Albanian [[irredentist]] organization that came to be known as the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] first emerged.{{sfn|Watson|2009|p=193}}\n\nFrom 1991 to 1992, Jashari and about 100 other ethnic Albanians wishing to fight for the independence of Kosovo underwent military training in the municipality of [[Labinot-Mal]] in [[Albania]].{{sfn|Judah|2002|p=111}} Afterwards, Jashari and other ethnic Albanians committed several acts of [[sabotage]] aimed at the Serbian administrative apparatus in Kosovo. Attempting to capture or kill him, Serbian police surrounded Jashari and his older brother, Ham\u00ebz, at their home in Prekaz on 30 December 1991. In the ensuing siege, large numbers of Kosovo Albanians flocked to Prekaz, pressuring the police to withdraw from the village.{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=142}}\n\nWhile in Albania, he was arrested in 1993 by the government of [[Sali Berisha]] and sent to jail in [[Tirana]]{{sfn|Pettifer|Vickers|2007|p=113}} before being released alongside other Kosovo Albanian militants at the demand of the [[Albanian Army]].{{sfn|Pettifer|Vickers|2007|pp=98\u201399}} With the Yugoslav forces now considering Prekaz a \"no-go\" area, Jashari launched several attacks over the next several years.

The next month, a small unit of the KLA ambushed Serbian policemen. Four Serbs were killed and two were injured in the ensuing clashes. At dawn on 5 March 1998, the KLA launched an attack against a police patrol in Prekaz.{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=142}}\n\n===Death===\n{{main|Attack on Prekaz}}\nIn response to this attack, the Yugoslavs organized a \"full-scale revenge mission\" involving tanks, [[Armoured personnel carrier|APCs]] and [[helicopter]]s.{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|pp=142\u2013143}} They were backed up by [[artillery]] from a nearby ammunition factory.{{sfn|Pettifer|2005|p=144}} With the intention of \"eliminating the suspects and their families,\"{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1998|p=27}} the police attacked villages that had been identified as KLA strongholds, including [[Liko\u0161ane]] and [[\u0106irez]]. Human Rights Watch noted that \"special police forces attacked without warning, firing indiscriminately at women, children and other noncombatants.\" KLA members and their families subsequently fled to Jashari's compound. Here, the police invited Jashari to surrender, giving him a deadline of two hours in which to respond. During this period, a number of families left the compound.{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=143}} Jashari remained, ordering his family members to stay inside and telling his militants to resist to the last man.{{sfn|Henriksen|2007|p=127}}\n\nOnce the two-hour deadline had expired, the two sides began exchanging gunfire. In one of the houses, where most of Jashari's extended family had gathered, a mortar shell fell in through the roof, causing many deaths. After a two{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=143}} or three-day siege, the police captured the Jashari compound.{{sfn|Judah|2008|p=81}} Once inside, they discovered that Jashari and his brother Ham\u00ebz had been killed.{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=143}} Also killed were Jashari's wife, Adilje, and his thirteen-year-old son, Kushtrim.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1998|p=29}} Overall, approximately fifty-eight Kosovo Albanians were killed in the attack, including eighteen women and ten children under the age of sixteen.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1998|p=28}}{{sfn|Judah|2002|p=140}} [[Goran Radosavljevi\u0107]], a major in the Serbian [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Serbia)|Interior Ministry]], said that \"[Jashari] used women, children and the elderly as hostages.\"{{sfn|Henriksen|2007|p=128}} Speaking of the attack, Yugoslav General [[Neboj\u0161a Pavkovi\u0107]] stated that it was \"a normal policing action against a well-known criminal.

It is headquartered in Melbourne. It has a growing e-commerce retail presence in Australia and is considered a multi-channel department store retailer.\n\nFounded in 1849, Harris Scarfe currently operates 66 retail stores nationally in two formats including \"Harris Scarfe\" [[department stores]] and \"Harris Scarfe Home\" homewares and kitchenware stores.\n\nIn December 2019, Harris Scarfe entered into voluntary administration after 170 years in operation. {{as of|2020|1}}, 21 of its 65 stores are set to close.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nHarris Scarfe traces its history to 10 February 1849, when the founding partners, George Peter Harris and John C. Lanyon, arrived in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] on the ship, \"Candahar\", to establish a hardware and [[ironmonger]]y business. Lanyon left the partnership on 22 February 1855 and returned to London, where he subsequently opened up a buying house for Geo. P Harris and other businesses in South Australia. Additional partners, George Scarfe and Richard Smith, joined the business in 1866 and the business name \"Geo. P. Harris, Scarfe & Co.\" was adopted in December that year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article207681585 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[The Adelaide Express]] |volume=IV |issue=914 |location=South Australia |date=17 December 1866 |accessdate=22 October 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nHarris Scarfe grew to become a major supplier of a broad range of household, agricultural and industrial items.  Besides conducting its retailing businesses, Harris Scarfe manufactured leather goods, including saddlery and luggage, as part of a wholesaling operation. Notably, during [[World War II]], when the [[Australian Government]] enforced price controls, it used the Harris Scarfe catalogue as the price guide.\n\n===1970s - 1980s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nIn 1971, Baradeen Quest Pty Limited, a subsidiary of Investment and Merchant Finance Corporation Limited (\"IMFC\") made a successful takeover bid for Harris Scarfe Limited, which was listed on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] at the time.\n\n[[Charles Davis Limited]], a listed [[Tasmania]]n company controlled by [[Sir Donald Trescowthick]], acquired control of Harris Scarfe in 1976. Trescowthick focussed Harris Scarfe's activities on its retailing business, developing a full line department store model, while the industrial products outlet at [[Mile End, South Australia|Mile End]] evolved to become Harry's, a large hardware retailing business.\n\nThe success of Harry's led Harris Scarfe's parent company, Charles Davis Limited, to acquire other hardware retailers, including Lloyd's in South Australia, [[Campbell's]] in Queensland, and [[Bunnings Warehouse|McEwans]] in Victoria and New South Wales. In 1989, these hardware businesses were sold in a management buyout, and acquired by [[Bunnings]] in 1993.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the 1990s, Harris Scarfe entered an era of unprecedented national growth. It expanded beyond its large department store in Rundle Mall into smaller format suburban and regional shopping stores. Harris Scarfe also acquired full-line department store sites from other retailers who were rationalising their store networks including [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]], [[Myer]], John Martins, Stirling and Centre Fair. By 1995, Harris Scarfe had become Australia's third largest department store retailer, with 38 stores, and trading in all states of Australia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe company ran into trouble during the late 1990s due to rising debts and management issues.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} In April 2001, the business was placed in receivership. Unsecured creditors were owed $93 million, and the company was $50 million in debt.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/former-harris-scarfe-executive-jailed-six-years-20020627-gduc7w.html|title=Former Harris Scarfe executive jailed six years|date=27 June 2002|work=[[The Age]]|access-date=29 December 2019|url-status=live|agency=[[Australian Associated Press]]}}</ref> In June 2002, the company's former chief financial officer, Alan Hodgson, was sentenced to six years in jail, on multiple counts that included giving false information to the [[Australian Securities Exchange|ASX]], and failing to act honestly as a company officer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2001, Harris Scarfe listed on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]] (ASX). In the same year, the company fell $160 million into debt, resulting in the owners, the Trescowthick family, losing $31.5 million. The government initially considered pressing charges against chairman Adam Trescowthick, but later dropped the case.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 2002, the company started a revitalisation program. The store network was remodelled with new products, layouts and new branding. As a result, Harris Scarfe soon began to enjoy record growth. By 2007, Sydney-based Momentum Private Equity acquired an $80&nbsp;million majority stake in the company. During 2012, Momentum Corporate ten sold the business to [[Pepkor]], a South African private equity firm.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nOver a six-month period at the end of 2003, Harris Scarfe made certain representations on a number of items in its catalogues in relation to pricing.

It has a growing e-commerce retail presence in Australia and is considered a multi-channel department store retailer.\n\nFounded in 1849, Harris Scarfe currently operates 66 retail stores nationally in two formats including \"Harris Scarfe\" [[department stores]] and \"Harris Scarfe Home\" homewares and kitchenware stores.\n\nIn December 2019, Harris Scarfe entered into voluntary administration after 170 years in operation. {{as of|2020|1}}, 21 of its 65 stores are set to close.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nHarris Scarfe traces its history to 10 February 1849, when the founding partners, George Peter Harris and John C. Lanyon, arrived in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] on the ship, \"Candahar\", to establish a hardware and [[ironmonger]]y business. Lanyon left the partnership on 22 February 1855 and returned to London, where he subsequently opened up a buying house for Geo. P Harris and other businesses in South Australia. Additional partners, George Scarfe and Richard Smith, joined the business in 1866 and the business name \"Geo. P. Harris, Scarfe & Co.\" was adopted in December that year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article207681585 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[The Adelaide Express]] |volume=IV |issue=914 |location=South Australia |date=17 December 1866 |accessdate=22 October 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nHarris Scarfe grew to become a major supplier of a broad range of household, agricultural and industrial items.  Besides conducting its retailing businesses, Harris Scarfe manufactured leather goods, including saddlery and luggage, as part of a wholesaling operation. Notably, during [[World War II]], when the [[Australian Government]] enforced price controls, it used the Harris Scarfe catalogue as the price guide.\n\n===1970s - 1980s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nIn 1971, Baradeen Quest Pty Limited, a subsidiary of Investment and Merchant Finance Corporation Limited (\"IMFC\") made a successful takeover bid for Harris Scarfe Limited, which was listed on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] at the time.\n\n[[Charles Davis Limited]], a listed [[Tasmania]]n company controlled by [[Sir Donald Trescowthick]], acquired control of Harris Scarfe in 1976. Trescowthick focussed Harris Scarfe's activities on its retailing business, developing a full line department store model, while the industrial products outlet at [[Mile End, South Australia|Mile End]] evolved to become Harry's, a large hardware retailing business.\n\nThe success of Harry's led Harris Scarfe's parent company, Charles Davis Limited, to acquire other hardware retailers, including Lloyd's in South Australia, [[Campbell's]] in Queensland, and [[Bunnings Warehouse|McEwans]] in Victoria and New South Wales. In 1989, these hardware businesses were sold in a management buyout, and acquired by [[Bunnings]] in 1993.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the 1990s, Harris Scarfe entered an era of unprecedented national growth. It expanded beyond its large department store in Rundle Mall into smaller format suburban and regional shopping stores. Harris Scarfe also acquired full-line department store sites from other retailers who were rationalising their store networks including [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]], [[Myer]], John Martins, Stirling and Centre Fair. By 1995, Harris Scarfe had become Australia's third largest department store retailer, with 38 stores, and trading in all states of Australia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe company ran into trouble during the late 1990s due to rising debts and management issues.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} In April 2001, the business was placed in receivership. Unsecured creditors were owed $93 million, and the company was $50 million in debt.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/former-harris-scarfe-executive-jailed-six-years-20020627-gduc7w.html|title=Former Harris Scarfe executive jailed six years|date=27 June 2002|work=[[The Age]]|access-date=29 December 2019|url-status=live|agency=[[Australian Associated Press]]}}</ref> In June 2002, the company's former chief financial officer, Alan Hodgson, was sentenced to six years in jail, on multiple counts that included giving false information to the [[Australian Securities Exchange|ASX]], and failing to act honestly as a company officer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2001, Harris Scarfe listed on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]] (ASX).

The government initially considered pressing charges against chairman Adam Trescowthick, but later dropped the case.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 2002, the company started a revitalisation program. The store network was remodelled with new products, layouts and new branding. As a result, Harris Scarfe soon began to enjoy record growth.

During 2012, Momentum Corporate ten sold the business to [[Pepkor]], a South African private equity firm.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nOver a six-month period at the end of 2003, Harris Scarfe made certain representations on a number of items in its catalogues in relation to pricing.

{"title_page": "Cinema of Wales", "text_new": "{{Culture of Wales}}\nThe '''Cinema of Wales''' comprises the art of film and creative movies made in [[Wales]] or by [[Welsh people|Welsh]] filmmakers either locally or abroad. Welsh cinema began in the late-19th century, led by Welsh-based director William Haggar. Wales continued to produce film of varying quality throughout the 20th century, in both the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[English language]]s, though indigenous production was curtailed through a lack of infrastructure and finance, which prevented the growth of the industry nationally. Despite this, Wales has been represented in all fields of the film making process, producing actors and directors of note.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and early history===\n[[Wales]] has a long film making history, with the first films shot in 1896, just a year after the development of the [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8res']] [[cinematograph]]e. The first known film to be recorded in Wales was by American [[Birt Acres]] featuring a royal visit to [[Cardiff]] by the Prince of Wales, later [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]. The film was later shown at the Great Fine Art, Industrial and Maritime Exhibition in Cardiff's [[Cathays Park]] in June 1896.<ref name=\"BBC 52 Facts\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/film/pages/52-facts.shtml | title=52 Welsh film facts 1-10| work=BBC Wales | date=5 March 2010 | accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref> Indigenous film production began in 1898, when [[Rhyl]] based [[Arthur Cheetham]] began recording silent 'short' films of local events. His first film was shown in January 1898 of children playing on Rhyl sands.<ref name=\"BBC 52 Facts\"/>\n[[File:Children playing on Rhyl Sands.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Still from children playing on Rhyl Sands (1898)]]\nThe first Wales based film-maker of enduring stature was [[William Haggar]], who made over 30 fiction films between 1901 and 1908.<ref>Davies (2008) p. 281</ref> Haggar's work received a worldwide audience mainly through the [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] and [[Charles Urban Trading Company|Urban]] companies.<ref name=\"Davies282\">Davies (2008) p. 282</ref> Haggar's most notable film was ''[[Desperate Poaching Affray]]'' (1903) which is recognised for its violence, iconoclasm and progressive editing. The film, along with Frank Mottorshaw's ''[[A Daring Daylight Burglary]]'' and Edwin Stanton Porter's ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', has in the early Twenty-first century, been credited with influencing the chase subgenre of American films.<ref>Davies (2008) p. 211</ref>\n\nOther extant pre\u2013Great War films to be shot in Wales were made by film-makers from outside the country. These included the British Biograph Company's film ''Conway Castle'' (1898) and Charles Urban Company's ''Wales, England: Land of Castles and Waterfalls'' (1907).<ref name=\"BBC Culture\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/film/pages/culture.shtml | title=Welsh people and culture in film | work=BBC Wales | date=27 October 2009 | accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref> The [[1906 British Home Championship]] encounter between Wales and Ireland at Wrexham was filmed by Blackburn firm Mitchell and Keynon, and is now the oldest surviving film of an international football match.<ref name=\"Davies282\"/> While the oldest footage of any football match is the 1898 film by Arthur Cheetham, ''Blackburn Rovers v West Bromwich Albion''.<ref name=\"BBC 52 Facts\"/>\n\nDuring the first few decades of Welsh cinema Wales was at the height of an industrial revolution, but there is little sense of the industrial landscape or life captured in the early silent movies taken within the country. Visiting companies, such as [[Edison Studios|Edison]] and [[British and Colonial Films|British and Colonial]] tended to favour filming in rural Wales.<ref name=\"Davies282\"/>\n\n===1914 to 1980===\nMuch of the cinema of Wales in the later 1910s and 1920s has been lost. In 1920 nine films were shot in Wales, all now lost.<ref name=\"Davies282\"/> One of the most notable and celebrated of the films from this period is ''A Welsh Singer'' (1915), adapted from a work by Welsh writer [[Allen Raine]], which starred [[Florence Turner]].<ref name=\"Davies282\"/> [[Henry Edwards (actor)|Henry Edwards]] who directed ''A Welsh Singer'', also created the 1930 film ''Aylwin'', from the novel by [[Theodore Watts-Dunton]], drawing into the world of gypsies and a mythical, mystical Wales.<ref name=\"BBC Culture\"/> The 1930s saw the first [[Welsh language]] film, ''[[Y Chwarelwr]]'' directed by [[Ifan ab Owen Edwards]] in 1935. The decade also saw two important [[agitprop]] documentaries, ''[[Today We Live (1937 film)|Today We Live]]'' (1937) set among the unemployed miners of the village of [[Pentre]] in the [[Rhondda|Rhondda Valleys]], and [[Donald Alexander (director)|Donald Alexander]]'s ''[[Eastern Valley]]'' (1937). The outbreak of World War II saw the backdrop of a mining valley in Wales being used as the setting for a war propaganda film, ''[[The Silent Village]]'' (1943). Designed as a tribute to the mining community of [[Lidice]], Czechoslovakia, which had suffered from Nazi atrocities, ''The Silent Village'' transpose the events to a Wales; and was also used to draw analogies with the oppression of the Welsh language.<ref name=\"BBC Culture\"/>\n[[File:Emlyn Williams.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Welsh dramatist and director of ''The Last Days of Dolwyn'', Emlyn Williams]]\nThe coming of the [[Sound film|sound era]] had little impact on Welsh cinema, though 1938's [[The Citadel (1938 film)|The Citadel]] an adaptation of [[A. J. Cronin]]'s [[The Citadel (novel)|1937 novel]] brought Wales to a large audience; though [[King Vidor]]'s interpretation failed to express the novel's political message.<ref name=\"Davies282\"/> The first Hollywood 'talkie' to be set in Wales was James Whale's ''[[The Old Dark House (1932 film)|The Old Dark House]]''.<ref name=\"BBC 52 Facts 3\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/film/pages/52-facts-03.shtml | title=52 Welsh film facts | work=BBC Wales | date=5 March 2010 | accessdate=14 February 2011}}</ref> The best known films connected to Wales during this period failed to harness Welsh talents, ''[[The Proud Valley]]'' (1940) and ''[[How Green Was My Valley (film)|How Green Was My Valley]]'' (1940) were neither directed or adapted for the screen by Welsh people. [[John Ford]]'s How Green Was My Valley is notable for starring just one Welsh actor, [[Rhys Williams (Welsh-American actor)|Rhys Williams]], and for being shot in the United States. Although John Ford's view of Wales was based on a mythical and romantic view of the industrialised valleys, Jill Cragie's [[Blue Scar]] (1949), part financed by the [[National Coal Board]], raised serious and radical questions about the nationalisation of the coal industry and has striking location photography around south Wales.<ref name=\"Davies282\"/><ref name=\"BBC Culture\"/> Another release from 1949 to make an important cultural statement was [[Emlyn Williams]]' ''[[The Last Days of Dolwyn]]'', the plot of which centred on the flooding of a Welsh village to create a reservoir; a subject that became extremely controversial in Wales in the 1960s.<ref name=\"BBC Culture\"/>\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw the output of two of the country's best documentary makers. [[Jack Howells (director)|Jack Howells]] and [[John Ormond]] dealt primarily with Welsh people and subjects. Howells is best known for his impressionistic, lyrical documentaries that included ''Nye!'' (1965) and ''[[Dylan Thomas (film)|Dylan Thomas]]'' (1962). ''Dylan Thomas'' is the only Welsh film to have won an Oscar (for [[35th Academy Awards|best short documentary]]), it features Richard Burton as narrator, visiting the haunts of [[Dylan Thomas]].<ref>Davies (2008) p. 380</ref> Ormond, a poet foremost, is remembered for his sensitive portrayals of writers and authors, and for documentaries concerned with the working class and with refugees, in particular ''Borrowed Pasture'' (1960) which follows two Polish ex-soldiers struggling to get by on a [[Carmarthenshire]] smallholding.<ref>Davies (2008) p. 633</ref>\n\nThe period directly following the end of the Second World War saw political and social commentary disappear from Welsh cinema. The first few decades after the war saw few notable Welsh films; stand out exceptions included ''[[Tiger Bay (1959 film)|Tiger Bay]]'' (1959) and ''[[Only Two Can Play]]'' (1962).<ref name=\"Davies282\"/> The main problems facing Welsh cinema during this period were a lack of a film production infrastructure, Welsh producers and finance. The fact that Wales was unable to produce films from within its own borders resulted in the stereotyping and common preconceptions of Welsh life formed by 'outside' film-makers.<ref name=\"Davies283\">Davies (2008) p. 283</ref> One of the few beacons of light for the industry came in the late 1970s with the output of left wing producer and director [[Karl Francis]]; whose controversial portrayal of contemporary life in the south Wales valleys was typified by his 1976 film ''[[Above us the Earth]]''.<ref name=\"Davies283\"/> Welsh language films were few, notably the films produced in the 1970s by the Bwrdd Ffilmiau Cymraeg (Welsh Film Board).\n\nBefore the advent of a dedicated channel, [[BBC Wales]] and its commercial counterpart [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] produced Welsh language programmes for their viewers in Wales. Although this did not include the creation of feature-length films, in the 1970s HTV undertook a venture to [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] existing movies into Welsh. Their first attempt was George Stevens' 1953 Western, ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]''. The result was seen as a unintentionally humorous and the experiment was quickly abandoned.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/westminster_hall/2001/apr/24/digital-television | title=House of Commons debate: Digital Television | publisher=millbanksystems.com | author=[[Simon Thomas (politician)|Thomas, Simon]] | date=24 April 2001 | accessdate=11 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eaea.org/index.php?k=12068 |title=The role of Adult education in preserving the identity of an ethnic minority: the Welsh case |publisher=eaea.org |work=European Association for the Education of Adults |author=Evans, J.R.P. |year=1991 |accessdate=11 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405224103/http://www.eaea.org/index.php?k=12068 |archivedate=5 April 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Could+George+Bush+follow+Shane+as+the+new+'Cymru+cowboyo'%3F-a0170459678 | title=Could George Bush follow Shane as the new 'Cymru cowboyo'? | publisher=thefreelibrary.com |work=Western Mail | author=Clark, Rhodri | date=31 October 2007 | accessdate=11 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n_vUx1TtH5AC&pg=PA218&lpg=PA218&dq=dubbed+welsh+shane#v=onepage&q=dubbed%20welsh%20shane&f=false | title=Modern Wales: A Concise History | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Jones, Gareth Elwyn | date=1994 |page=218 | accessdate=11 July 2012| isbn=9780521469456 }}</ref>\n\n===1980 to present===\n1982 saw the launch of [[S4C]], a Welsh language television channel, which began producing and funding longer dramas and films in the Welsh and English language. Initial output was poor, but after reassessing its responsibilities in 1986, the company produced films of note, including ''Boy Soldier'' (1986) and ''[[Rhosyn a Rhith]]'' (1986), the latter being the first film in the Welsh language to gain a London West End cinema release.<ref name=\"Davies283\"/> Although the production of Welsh features from S4C was low, it aided the emergence of talented Welsh film-makers, such as [[Endaf Emlyn]], [[Marc Evans]] and [[Stephen Bayly]].<ref name=\"Davies283\"/> S4C's 1995 policy, to produce up to two feature films a year, to be released to cinemas before television transmission allowed Welsh film-makers new opportunities. Yet the reluctance of London-based distributors to handle Welsh language films make it difficult for Welsh films to reach a wider audience.<ref name=\"Davies283\"/>\n\nThe early 1990s began with the release of Welsh language film ''[[Hedd Wyn (film)|Hedd Wyn]]''. It won the [[Royal Television Society]] Best Drama award and became the first Welsh film to gain a nomination in the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. Despite this it failed to gain a British distributor.<ref name=\"Davies283\"/> The 1990s also saw two important films from Endaf Emlyn, ''[[Un Nos Ola Leuad]]'' (1991) is seen as one of the finest Welsh films made,<ref name=\"Davies283\"/> while his ''Gadael Lenin'' (1993) was voted by viewers at the 1993 London Film Festival as the most popular British film.\n\nThe later 1990s saw three English language films that found a home in mainstream British cinema. The first of the three was Marc Evans' ''[[House of America]]'' which drew comparisons to the realism of Karl Francis' work. Then in 1998, [[Kevin Allen (actor)|Kevin Allen]] produced [[Twin Town]], a bawdy comedy satirising the older cultural traditions of Wales. This though was surpassed at the box office by [[Justin Kerrigan]]'s ''[[Human Traffic]]'' (1999), a stylised comedy focusing on the club and drug culture of Cardiff. 2000 saw the release of [[Paul Morrison (director)|Paul Morrison's]] ''[[Solomon & Gaenor]]'' the second film to be nominated for the foreign language Academy Award.\n\nFilms of note in the early twenty-first century set in Wales include comedies ''[[House!]]'' (2000) and ''[[Very Annie Mary]]'' (2000), and horror films ''[[The Dark (film)|The Dark]]'' (2005) and ''[[Evil Aliens]]'' (2006).

Weeks would later film two versions of the [[Arthurian]] myth of ''[[Gawain and the Green Knight]]''.

Hopkins has appeared in film since the 1960s, starring in Hollywood costume dramas such as ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]''. Starring in films as diverse as [[Richard Attenborough]]'s ''[[Magic (1978 film)|Magic]]'' and [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'', Hopkins became a Hollywood star after his Academy Award winning performance as [[Hannibal Lecter]] in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1992). Hopkins continued to impress throughout the 1990s with critically acclaimed performances in ''[[Shadowlands (1993 film)|Shadowlands]]'' and ''[[Remains of the Day]]''.\n\nThe 1990s produced an abrasive group of Welsh actors, including [[Rhys Ifans]] and [[Matthew Rhys]]. The 1990s also saw the success of [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], who became one of Hollywood's highest paid stars, appearing alongside [[Antonio Banderas]] and Anthony Hopkins in ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]'' and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]''. The 2000s are most notable for the emergence of [[Ioan Gruffudd]], who took the lead role in the 2006 historical drama ''[[Amazing Grace (2006 film)|Amazing Grace]]'', and [[Michael Sheen]] who appeared as [[Tony Blair]] in [[Peter Morgan]]'s ''Blair Trilogy'' and played [[David Frost]] in ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]''. One of the biggest movie stars to come out of Wales is [[Academy Award|Oscar]] winning [[actor]] [[Christian Bale]]. He is well known for portraying [[Batman]]/[[Bruce Wayne]] in critically and commercially acclaimed The Dark Knight Trilogy.

Welsh cinema began in the late-19th century, led by Welsh-based director William Haggar. Wales continued to produce film of varying quality throughout the 20th century, in both the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[English language]]s, though indigenous production was curtailed through a lack of infrastructure and finance, which prevented the growth of the industry nationally. Despite this, Wales has been represented in all fields of the film making process, producing actors and directors of note.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and early history===\n[[Wales]] has a long film making history, with the first films shot in 1896, just a year after the development of the [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8res']] [[cinematograph]]e. The first known film to be recorded in Wales was by American [[Birt Acres]] featuring a royal visit to [[Cardiff]] by the Prince of Wales, later [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]. The film was later shown at the Great Fine Art, Industrial and Maritime Exhibition in Cardiff's [[Cathays Park]] in June 1896.<ref name=\"BBC 52 Facts\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/film/pages/52-facts.shtml | title=52 Welsh film facts 1-10| work=BBC Wales | date=5 March 2010 | accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref> Indigenous film production began in 1898, when [[Rhyl]] based [[Arthur Cheetham]] began recording silent 'short' films of local events. His first film was shown in January 1898 of children playing on Rhyl sands.<ref name=\"BBC 52 Facts\"/>\n[[File:Children playing on Rhyl Sands.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Still from children playing on Rhyl Sands (1898)]]\nThe first Wales based film-maker of enduring stature was [[William Haggar]], who made over 30 fiction films between 1901 and 1908.<ref>Davies (2008) p. 281</ref> Haggar's work received a worldwide audience mainly through the [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] and [[Charles Urban Trading Company|Urban]] companies.<ref name=\"Davies282\">Davies (2008) p. 282</ref> Haggar's most notable film was ''[[Desperate Poaching Affray]]'' (1903) which is recognised for its violence, iconoclasm and progressive editing. The film, along with Frank Mottorshaw's ''[[A Daring Daylight Burglary]]'' and Edwin Stanton Porter's ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', has in the early Twenty-first century, been credited with influencing the chase subgenre of American films.<ref>Davies (2008) p. 211</ref>\n\nOther extant pre\u2013Great War films to be shot in Wales were made by film-makers from outside the country. These included the British Biograph Company's film ''Conway Castle'' (1898) and Charles Urban Company's ''Wales, England: Land of Castles and Waterfalls'' (1907).<ref name=\"BBC Culture\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/film/pages/culture.shtml | title=Welsh people and culture in film | work=BBC Wales | date=27 October 2009 | accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref> The [[1906 British Home Championship]] encounter between Wales and Ireland at Wrexham was filmed by Blackburn firm Mitchell and Keynon, and is now the oldest surviving film of an international football match.<ref name=\"Davies282\"/> While the oldest footage of any football match is the 1898 film by Arthur Cheetham, ''Blackburn Rovers v West Bromwich Albion''.<ref name=\"BBC 52 Facts\"/>\n\nDuring the first few decades of Welsh cinema Wales was at the height of an industrial revolution, but there is little sense of the industrial landscape or life captured in the early silent movies taken within the country. Visiting companies, such as [[Edison Studios|Edison]] and [[British and Colonial Films|British and Colonial]] tended to favour filming in rural Wales.<ref name=\"Davies282\"/>\n\n===1914 to 1980===\nMuch of the cinema of Wales in the later 1910s and 1920s has been lost. In 1920 nine films were shot in Wales, all now lost.<ref name=\"Davies282\"/> One of the most notable and celebrated of the films from this period is ''A Welsh Singer'' (1915), adapted from a work by Welsh writer [[Allen Raine]], which starred [[Florence Turner]].<ref name=\"Davies282\"/> [[Henry Edwards (actor)|Henry Edwards]] who directed ''A Welsh Singer'', also created the 1930 film ''Aylwin'', from the novel by [[Theodore Watts-Dunton]], drawing into the world of gypsies and a mythical, mystical Wales.<ref name=\"BBC Culture\"/> The 1930s saw the first [[Welsh language]] film, ''[[Y Chwarelwr]]'' directed by [[Ifan ab Owen Edwards]] in 1935. The decade also saw two important [[agitprop]] documentaries, ''[[Today We Live (1937 film)|Today We Live]]'' (1937) set among the unemployed miners of the village of [[Pentre]] in the [[Rhondda|Rhondda Valleys]], and [[Donald Alexander (director)|Donald Alexander]]'s ''[[Eastern Valley]]'' (1937). The outbreak of World War II saw the backdrop of a mining valley in Wales being used as the setting for a war propaganda film, ''[[The Silent Village]]'' (1943). Designed as a tribute to the mining community of [[Lidice]], Czechoslovakia, which had suffered from Nazi atrocities, ''The Silent Village'' transpose the events to a Wales; and was also used to draw analogies with the oppression of the Welsh language.<ref name=\"BBC Culture\"/>\n[[File:Emlyn Williams.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Welsh dramatist and director of ''The Last Days of Dolwyn'', Emlyn Williams]]\nThe coming of the [[Sound film|sound era]] had little impact on Welsh cinema, though 1938's [[The Citadel (1938 film)|The Citadel]] an adaptation of [[A.

[[John Ford]]'s How Green Was My Valley is notable for starring just one Welsh actor, [[Rhys Williams (Welsh-American actor)|Rhys Williams]], and for being shot in the United States. Although John Ford's view of Wales was based on a mythical and romantic view of the industrialised valleys, Jill Cragie's [[Blue Scar]] (1949), part financed by the [[National Coal Board]], raised serious and radical questions about the nationalisation of the coal industry and has striking location photography around south Wales.<ref name=\"Davies282\"/><ref name=\"BBC Culture\"/> Another release from 1949 to make an important cultural statement was [[Emlyn Williams]]' ''[[The Last Days of Dolwyn]]'', the plot of which centred on the flooding of a Welsh village to create a reservoir; a subject that became extremely controversial in Wales in the 1960s.<ref name=\"BBC Culture\"/>\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw the output of two of the country's best documentary makers. [[Jack Howells (director)|Jack Howells]] and [[John Ormond]] dealt primarily with Welsh people and subjects. Howells is best known for his impressionistic, lyrical documentaries that included ''Nye!'' (1965) and ''[[Dylan Thomas (film)|Dylan Thomas]]'' (1962). ''Dylan Thomas'' is the only Welsh film to have won an Oscar (for [[35th Academy Awards|best short documentary]]), it features Richard Burton as narrator, visiting the haunts of [[Dylan Thomas]].<ref>Davies (2008) p. 380</ref> Ormond, a poet foremost, is remembered for his sensitive portrayals of writers and authors, and for documentaries concerned with the working class and with refugees, in particular ''Borrowed Pasture'' (1960) which follows two Polish ex-soldiers struggling to get by on a [[Carmarthenshire]] smallholding.<ref>Davies (2008) p. 633</ref>\n\nThe period directly following the end of the Second World War saw political and social commentary disappear from Welsh cinema. The first few decades after the war saw few notable Welsh films; stand out exceptions included ''[[Tiger Bay (1959 film)|Tiger Bay]]'' (1959) and ''[[Only Two Can Play]]'' (1962).<ref name=\"Davies282\"/> The main problems facing Welsh cinema during this period were a lack of a film production infrastructure, Welsh producers and finance. The fact that Wales was unable to produce films from within its own borders resulted in the stereotyping and common preconceptions of Welsh life formed by 'outside' film-makers.<ref name=\"Davies283\">Davies (2008) p. 283</ref> One of the few beacons of light for the industry came in the late 1970s with the output of left wing producer and director [[Karl Francis]]; whose controversial portrayal of contemporary life in the south Wales valleys was typified by his 1976 film ''[[Above us the Earth]]''.<ref name=\"Davies283\"/> Welsh language films were few, notably the films produced in the 1970s by the Bwrdd Ffilmiau Cymraeg (Welsh Film Board).\n\nBefore the advent of a dedicated channel, [[BBC Wales]] and its commercial counterpart [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] produced Welsh language programmes for their viewers in Wales. Although this did not include the creation of feature-length films, in the 1970s HTV undertook a venture to [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] existing movies into Welsh. Their first attempt was George Stevens' 1953 Western, ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]''. The result was seen as a unintentionally humorous and the experiment was quickly abandoned.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/westminster_hall/2001/apr/24/digital-television | title=House of Commons debate: Digital Television | publisher=millbanksystems.com | author=[[Simon Thomas (politician)|Thomas, Simon]] | date=24 April 2001 | accessdate=11 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eaea.org/index.php?k=12068 |title=The role of Adult education in preserving the identity of an ethnic minority: the Welsh case |publisher=eaea.org |work=European Association for the Education of Adults |author=Evans, J.R.P. |year=1991 |accessdate=11 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405224103/http://www.eaea.org/index.php?k=12068 |archivedate=5 April 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Could+George+Bush+follow+Shane+as+the+new+'Cymru+cowboyo'%3F-a0170459678 | title=Could George Bush follow Shane as the new 'Cymru cowboyo'? | publisher=thefreelibrary.com |work=Western Mail | author=Clark, Rhodri | date=31 October 2007 | accessdate=11 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n_vUx1TtH5AC&pg=PA218&lpg=PA218&dq=dubbed+welsh+shane#v=onepage&q=dubbed%20welsh%20shane&f=false | title=Modern Wales: A Concise History | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Jones, Gareth Elwyn | date=1994 |page=218 | accessdate=11 July 2012| isbn=9780521469456 }}</ref>\n\n===1980 to present===\n1982 saw the launch of [[S4C]], a Welsh language television channel, which began producing and funding longer dramas and films in the Welsh and English language. Initial output was poor, but after reassessing its responsibilities in 1986, the company produced films of note, including ''Boy Soldier'' (1986) and ''[[Rhosyn a Rhith]]'' (1986), the latter being the first film in the Welsh language to gain a London West End cinema release.<ref name=\"Davies283\"/> Although the production of Welsh features from S4C was low, it aided the emergence of talented Welsh film-makers, such as [[Endaf Emlyn]], [[Marc Evans]] and [[Stephen Bayly]].<ref name=\"Davies283\"/> S4C's 1995 policy, to produce up to two feature films a year, to be released to cinemas before television transmission allowed Welsh film-makers new opportunities. Yet the reluctance of London-based distributors to handle Welsh language films make it difficult for Welsh films to reach a wider audience.<ref name=\"Davies283\"/>\n\nThe early 1990s began with the release of Welsh language film ''[[Hedd Wyn (film)|Hedd Wyn]]''. It won the [[Royal Television Society]] Best Drama award and became the first Welsh film to gain a nomination in the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. Despite this it failed to gain a British distributor.<ref name=\"Davies283\"/> The 1990s also saw two important films from Endaf Emlyn, ''[[Un Nos Ola Leuad]]'' (1991) is seen as one of the finest Welsh films made,<ref name=\"Davies283\"/> while his ''Gadael Lenin'' (1993) was voted by viewers at the 1993 London Film Festival as the most popular British film.\n\nThe later 1990s saw three English language films that found a home in mainstream British cinema. The first of the three was Marc Evans' ''[[House of America]]'' which drew comparisons to the realism of Karl Francis' work. Then in 1998, [[Kevin Allen (actor)|Kevin Allen]] produced [[Twin Town]], a bawdy comedy satirising the older cultural traditions of Wales. This though was surpassed at the box office by [[Justin Kerrigan]]'s ''[[Human Traffic]]'' (1999), a stylised comedy focusing on the club and drug culture of Cardiff. 2000 saw the release of [[Paul Morrison (director)|Paul Morrison's]] ''[[Solomon & Gaenor]]'' the second film to be nominated for the foreign language Academy Award.\n\nFilms of note in the early twenty-first century set in Wales include comedies ''[[House!]]'' (2000) and ''[[Very Annie Mary]]'' (2000), and horror films ''[[The Dark (film)|The Dark]]'' (2005) and ''[[Evil Aliens]]'' (2006).
