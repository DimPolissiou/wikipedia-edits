{"title_page": "Hymn to the Fallen (Jiu Ge)", "text_new": "{{Italics|title}}\n[[File:GeWarringStates.JPG|thumb|right|330 px|A collection of typical ''ge'' and crossbow bolts from the Warring States]]\n'''\"Hymn to the Fallen\" ''(Jiu Ge)''''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u570b\u6ba4|s=\u56fd\u6b87 |p=Gu\u00f3 sh\u0101ng|l=Those who meet Death in the Course of Fighting for their Country}}) is a [[Classical Chinese poetry|Classical Chinese poem]] which has been preserved in the [[Jiu Ge|''Nine Songs (Jiu Ge)'']] section of  the ancient Chinese poetry anthology, the ''[[Chu ci]]'', or ''The Songs of Chu'', which is an ancient set of poems. Together, these poems constitute one of the 17 sections of the poetry anthology which was published under the title of the ''[[Chuci]]'' (also known as the ''Songs of Chu'' or as the ''Songs of the South''). Despite the \"Nine\" in the title (''Jiu ge'' literally means ''Nine Songs''), the number of these poetic pieces actually consists of eleven separate songs, or elegies.<ref>Murck 2000, 11</ref> This set of verses seems to represent some shamanistic dramatic practices of the [[Yangzi River]] valley area (as well as a northern tradition or traditions) involving the invocation of divine beings and seeking their blessings by means of a process of courtship.<ref>Davis 1970, xlvii</ref> The poetry consists of lyrics written for performance as part of a religious drama, however the lack of stage directions or indications of who is supposed to be singing at any one time or whether some of the lines represent lines for a chorus makes an accurate reconstruction of how such a shamanic drama would actually have been performed quite uncertain; although, there are internal textual clues, for example indicating the use of spectacular costumes for the performers, and an extensive orchestra.<ref>Hawkes 1985, 95-96</ref> Although not precisely dated, \"Hymn to the Fallen\" dates from the end of the late the [[Warring States period]], ended 221 BCE, with possible revisions in the [[Han dynasty]], particularly during the reign of [[Han Wudi]], during 141 to 87 BCE .  The poem has been translated into English by [[David Hawkes (Sinologist)|David Hawkes]] as \"Hymn to the Fallen\". The tenth ''Jiu ge'' poem (''Guo shang'') is a hymn to soldiers killed in war (\"Guo shang\"). ''Gu\u00f3'' (\u570b) means the \"state\", \"kingdom\", or \"nation\". ''Sh\u0101ng'' (\u6ba4) means to \"die young\". Put together, the title refers to those who meet death in the course of fighting for their country. David Hawkes describes it as \"surely one of the most beautiful laments for fallen soldiers in any language\".<ref>Hawkes 1985, 116-117</ref>\n\n==Meter==\nThe meter is a regular seven-character verse, with three characters separated by the exclamatory particle \"[[:wikt:\u516e|\u516e]]\" followed by three more characters, each composing a half line, for a total of nine double lines totaling 126 characters.(\u570b\u6ba4<ref>https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E4%B9%9D%E6%AD%8C#\u570b\u6ba4</ref>)\n\n==Background==\nThe historical background of the \"Hymn to the Fallen\" poem involves the ancient type of warfare practiced in ancient China. Included are references to arms and weapons, ancient states or areas, and the mixed use of chariots in warfare. A good historical example of this type of contest is the \"[[Battle of Yanling]]\", which features similar characteristics and problems experienced by participants in this type of fighting, such as greatly elevated mortality rates for both horses and humans. As is generally the in the case of ''Chu ci'' poems, it is concerned with events or matters relating to [[Chu (state)|Chu]], whether considered as a political state or as or pertaining to the area in which that state was located. Thus \"Hymn to the Fallen\" refers to a battle (whether real or imaginary) involving Chu warriors, although the characteristic warfare described would similar to that of the early [[Han dynasty]].\n\n==Chu and the Warring States==\n[[File:EN-WarringStatesAll260BCE.jpg|thumb|Map of Warring States, 260BCE, showing Chu (\u695a), having incorporated Wu (\u5433), bordered by Qin (\u79e6)]]\nThe [[Chu (state)|state of Chu]] was a kingdom dating back to early 8th century BCE. During its existence there was frequent armed violence; indeed, the latter part of its existence is known for that reason as [[Warring States period]] (beginning early Fifth Century BCE). This was a period characterized by struggles between the different kingdoms for supremacy until their final [[Qin's wars of unification|political consolidation]] by [[Qin (state)|Qin]] in 221 BCE. (Chu was annexed in 223 BCE.) During the Warring States era, warfare developed in ways characteristic to what is depicted in \"Hymn to the Fallen\". There was also often factional violence within the states, often related. The [[Confucianism|Confucian]] philosopher [[Xun Kuang|Xun Zi (Shun Kuang)]] comments on this in his early Third Century BCE book known eponymously as the [[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]] or ''Works of Xun Zi'':\n\n<blockquote>\nThe soldiers of Chu were equipped with armour made of sharkskin and rhinoceros hide hard as metal or stone, and pikes of Nanyang steel that could sting a man like a wasp or scorpion. They were so light and mobile that they seemed to move about like the wind. Yet at [[Battle of Chuisha|Chui-sha]] the Chu army was all but destroyed and its commander [[Tang Mie]] [...] was killed. Zhuang Jiao led a rising in the capital and the country split in several parts. This was not because they lacked strong armour and sharp weapons but because they did not know how to use them.<ref>Hawkes 1985, 122 n. to ''l''.1</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Weapons, armor, and equipment==\n{{More|Sunzi Bingfa}}\n\"Hymn to the Fallen\" specifically mentions several types of weapon and other characteristics of early Chinese warfare and culture. Specific understanding of this type of warfare and the cultural background enhances specific understanding of the poem; this includes specific weapons, armor, vehicles, and methodology of war. \n\n===''Ge''===\n[[File:Ge(Warring states period).jpg|thumb|Head of ''ge'' (\u6208) from the Warring states period. Typically the wood pole did not survive. Nor did the tassels affixed to the slot seen here.]]\n{{Main|Dagger-axe}}\nOne weapon specifically-mentioned in \"Hymn to the Fallen\"  is the variously-translated [[dagger-axe|''ge'']] ({{zh|c=\u6208|p=g\u0113|w=ko}}.  (Note that the two Chinese words and characters for ''ge'' -- weapon and song -- are distinct.) Translations include ''dagger-axe'', ''pike'', ''[[halberd]]'', and others (''dagger-axe'' is descriptive, the others tend to be the names of European relatives. This long, [[polearm]] weapon generally consists of a metal blade or blades and sometimes a metal point hafted at the end of a long pole, generally of wood. Eventually these ''ge'' were mass-produced, the spear tip on the end became more common and the ''ji'' became commonly used ({{zh|\u621f}}). The ''ge'' was known in China from earliest history through the time period when \"Hymn to the Fallen\" was written. ''Ge'' made in [[Wu (state)|Wu]] (\u5433\u6208) or produced from steel made there were especially renowned, and specifically mentioned in \"Hymn to the Fallen\".\n\n===Bow and Arrow/Bolt===\n[[File:Qin crossbow.png|thumb|Qin crossbow]]\n\nAnother weapon which specified is the [[Bow and arrow|bow]], which is a [[ranged weapon]] which launches a projectile, usually referred to as an ''[[arrow]]'' in the case of a long bow and as a ''quarrel'' or [[Crossbow bolt|''bolt'']] in the case of a [[cross bow]], in both cases possessed of a deadly metal tip. In either case, the relevance to the poem is the way in which these weapon is used in ancient Chinese warfare: shot by an archer from the ground or from chariots generally in large numbers, battles frequently began with massed archery as soon as the armies were in range of each other. Often shot [[Projectile motion|ballistically]], the arrows/bolts would come down from on high, accelerated by the force of gravity into a deadly rain from above. However, at close quarters the archer was no match for the wielder of the ''ge'', so a typical battle would begin with volleys of arrows/bolts, followed by hand-to-hand fighting. Both the longbow and crossbow were known to the author of \"Hymn to the Fallen\" and the only specification made is to \"[[Qin (state)|Qin]] bows (\u79e6\u5f13)\".

[[Rhinoceroses in ancient China]] were relatively common at the time of the composition of \"Hymn to the Fallen\", and Chu is noted for historical use of rhino skin armor for war. \"[t]he soldiers of Chu were equipped with armour made of sharkskin and rhinoceros hide as hard as metal or stone, and with pikes of Nanyang steel that could sting a man like a wasp or a scorpion\".<ref>Hawkes 1985, 122</ref> The [[lamellar armour]] favoured by Chu was generally constructed of many small pieces intricately sewn together, resulting in a type of armor providing a certain amount of defensive protection, while at the same time being reasonably light and flexible.\n\n===Chariots===\n{{Main|Chariots in ancient China}}\n[[File:THorseChineseChariot400BCE.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Schematic of typical chariot (\u8eca)]]\n[[File:Chariot wheel cap, China, Warring States period, 475-221 BC, bronze inlaid with silver and gold - Middlebury College Museum of Art - Middlebury, VT - DSC08217.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Chariot wheel hub/cap (\u8f42), China, Warring States period, 475-221 BC, bronze inlaid with silver and gold]]\nThe horse and [[chariot]] were key components of the type of warfare described in this verse, and had been for a long time.<ref>Beckwith 2009, 43; according to which archeological evidence shows that in China the small scale use in war of the chariot began around 1200 BCE in the late [[Shang dynasty]]</ref> [[Chariots in ancient China]] were generally light, two-wheeled vehicles pulled by two to four horses (or ponies), yoked together by one or two poles, to which the outside horses were attached by traces. Typically, on the left side of the chariot rode the charioteer who controlled the horses, generally armed only with a short sword. Beside him would be one (or more) archers armed with bows and a short sword. The short swords were in case an enemy jumped on the chariot or the personnel were forced into melee combat; however, yet of such construction as they be not so bulky that they might interfere with main duties onboard. Typically, protecting the right side was a soldier armed with the ''ge'', a lengthy and lethal hand weapon. In battle, the tactical aim for chariots was generally to avoid direct contact with the enemy, and instead inflict damage at a relatively safe distance, charging towards the enemy ranks, discharging a volley of arrows/bolts, and wheeling away to a safe distance. Then, repeat. If the chariots got stuck in mud, hemmed in, or the wheels damaged or otherwise disabled they were likely to be quite at a disadvantage if attacked by foot soldiers armed with ''ge'', swords, axes, or other melee weapons, especially if the foot soldiers maintained disciplined formations.\n\n===Military organization===\n{{Further|The Art of War}}\nMilitary discipline was key component in the warfare depicted in \"Hymn to the Fallen\"; that is, the ordering of the army so as to be most effective in tactics and responsive to command. Coordination of chariot forces and infantry was generally critical to success. The chariots were vulnerable to infantry attack at close quarters and so generally would be provided with infantry support. Infantry was also vulnerable to chariots if they were able to maintain a distance allowing ranged attacks but avoiding melee, so generally chariot accompaniment was required. Communications, including rallying points and identifying forces was often done through the use of banners, sometimes adorned with feathers (''j\u012bng'', [[:wikt:\u65cc|\u65cc]]), as is mentioned in \"Hymn to the Fallen\". Also mentioned is the use of musical instruments to lead on the troops and to coordinate their actions. The use of musical instruments to control movements of the army was an old practice. Attack (charge), regroup, retreat, and similar maneuvers could all be sounded.\n\n==Spiritual and Religious Phenomena==\nVarious spiritual and religious cultural phenomena are encountered in the \"Hymn to the Fallen\" poem.

Together, these poems constitute one of the 17 sections of the poetry anthology which was published under the title of the ''[[Chuci]]'' (also known as the ''Songs of Chu'' or as the ''Songs of the South''). Despite the \"Nine\" in the title (''Jiu ge'' literally means ''Nine Songs''), the number of these poetic pieces actually consists of eleven separate songs, or elegies.<ref>Murck 2000, 11</ref> This set of verses seems to represent some shamanistic dramatic practices of the [[Yangzi River]] valley area (as well as a northern tradition or traditions) involving the invocation of divine beings and seeking their blessings by means of a process of courtship.<ref>Davis 1970, xlvii</ref> The poetry consists of lyrics written for performance as part of a religious drama, however the lack of stage directions or indications of who is supposed to be singing at any one time or whether some of the lines represent lines for a chorus makes an accurate reconstruction of how such a shamanic drama would actually have been performed quite uncertain; although, there are internal textual clues, for example indicating the use of spectacular costumes for the performers, and an extensive orchestra.<ref>Hawkes 1985, 95-96</ref> Although not precisely dated, \"Hymn to the Fallen\" dates from the end of the late the [[Warring States period]], ended 221 BCE, with possible revisions in the [[Han dynasty]], particularly during the reign of [[Han Wudi]], during 141 to 87 BCE .  The poem has been translated into English by [[David Hawkes (Sinologist)|David Hawkes]] as \"Hymn to the Fallen\". The tenth ''Jiu ge'' poem (''Guo shang'') is a hymn to soldiers killed in war (\"Guo shang\"). ''Gu\u00f3'' (\u570b) means the \"state\", \"kingdom\", or \"nation\". ''Sh\u0101ng'' (\u6ba4) means to \"die young\". Put together, the title refers to those who meet death in the course of fighting for their country. David Hawkes describes it as \"surely one of the most beautiful laments for fallen soldiers in any language\".<ref>Hawkes 1985, 116-117</ref>\n\n==Meter==\nThe meter is a regular seven-character verse, with three characters separated by the exclamatory particle \"[[:wikt:\u516e|\u516e]]\" followed by three more characters, each composing a half line, for a total of nine double lines totaling 126 characters.(\u570b\u6ba4<ref>https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E4%B9%9D%E6%AD%8C#\u570b\u6ba4</ref>)\n\n==Background==\nThe historical background of the \"Hymn to the Fallen\" poem involves the ancient type of warfare practiced in ancient China. Included are references to arms and weapons, ancient states or areas, and the mixed use of chariots in warfare. A good historical example of this type of contest is the \"[[Battle of Yanling]]\", which features similar characteristics and problems experienced by participants in this type of fighting, such as greatly elevated mortality rates for both horses and humans. As is generally the in the case of ''Chu ci'' poems, it is concerned with events or matters relating to [[Chu (state)|Chu]], whether considered as a political state or as or pertaining to the area in which that state was located. Thus \"Hymn to the Fallen\" refers to a battle (whether real or imaginary) involving Chu warriors, although the characteristic warfare described would similar to that of the early [[Han dynasty]].\n\n==Chu and the Warring States==\n[[File:EN-WarringStatesAll260BCE.jpg|thumb|Map of Warring States, 260BCE, showing Chu (\u695a), having incorporated Wu (\u5433), bordered by Qin (\u79e6)]]\nThe [[Chu (state)|state of Chu]] was a kingdom dating back to early 8th century BCE. During its existence there was frequent armed violence; indeed, the latter part of its existence is known for that reason as [[Warring States period]] (beginning early Fifth Century BCE). This was a period characterized by struggles between the different kingdoms for supremacy until their final [[Qin's wars of unification|political consolidation]] by [[Qin (state)|Qin]] in 221 BCE. (Chu was annexed in 223 BCE.) During the Warring States era, warfare developed in ways characteristic to what is depicted in \"Hymn to the Fallen\". There was also often factional violence within the states, often related. The [[Confucianism|Confucian]] philosopher [[Xun Kuang|Xun Zi (Shun Kuang)]] comments on this in his early Third Century BCE book known eponymously as the [[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]] or ''Works of Xun Zi'':\n\n<blockquote>\nThe soldiers of Chu were equipped with armour made of sharkskin and rhinoceros hide hard as metal or stone, and pikes of Nanyang steel that could sting a man like a wasp or scorpion. They were so light and mobile that they seemed to move about like the wind. Yet at [[Battle of Chuisha|Chui-sha]] the Chu army was all but destroyed and its commander [[Tang Mie]] [...] was killed. Zhuang Jiao led a rising in the capital and the country split in several parts. This was not because they lacked strong armour and sharp weapons but because they did not know how to use them.<ref>Hawkes 1985, 122 n. to ''l''.1</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Weapons, armor, and equipment==\n{{More|Sunzi Bingfa}}\n\"Hymn to the Fallen\" specifically mentions several types of weapon and other characteristics of early Chinese warfare and culture. Specific understanding of this type of warfare and the cultural background enhances specific understanding of the poem; this includes specific weapons, armor, vehicles, and methodology of war. \n\n===''Ge''===\n[[File:Ge(Warring states period).jpg|thumb|Head of ''ge'' (\u6208) from the Warring states period. Typically the wood pole did not survive. Nor did the tassels affixed to the slot seen here.]]\n{{Main|Dagger-axe}}\nOne weapon specifically-mentioned in \"Hymn to the Fallen\"  is the variously-translated [[dagger-axe|''ge'']] ({{zh|c=\u6208|p=g\u0113|w=ko}}.  (Note that the two Chinese words and characters for ''ge'' -- weapon and song -- are distinct.) Translations include ''dagger-axe'', ''pike'', ''[[halberd]]'', and others (''dagger-axe'' is descriptive, the others tend to be the names of European relatives. This long, [[polearm]] weapon generally consists of a metal blade or blades and sometimes a metal point hafted at the end of a long pole, generally of wood. Eventually these ''ge'' were mass-produced, the spear tip on the end became more common and the ''ji'' became commonly used ({{zh|\u621f}}). The ''ge'' was known in China from earliest history through the time period when \"Hymn to the Fallen\" was written. ''Ge'' made in [[Wu (state)|Wu]] (\u5433\u6208) or produced from steel made there were especially renowned, and specifically mentioned in \"Hymn to the Fallen\".\n\n===Bow and Arrow/Bolt===\n[[File:Qin crossbow.png|thumb|Qin crossbow]]\n\nAnother weapon which specified is the [[Bow and arrow|bow]], which is a [[ranged weapon]] which launches a projectile, usually referred to as an ''[[arrow]]'' in the case of a long bow and as a ''quarrel'' or [[Crossbow bolt|''bolt'']] in the case of a [[cross bow]], in both cases possessed of a deadly metal tip. In either case, the relevance to the poem is the way in which these weapon is used in ancient Chinese warfare: shot by an archer from the ground or from chariots generally in large numbers, battles frequently began with massed archery as soon as the armies were in range of each other. Often shot [[Projectile motion|ballistically]], the arrows/bolts would come down from on high, accelerated by the force of gravity into a deadly rain from above. However, at close quarters the archer was no match for the wielder of the ''ge'', so a typical battle would begin with volleys of arrows/bolts, followed by hand-to-hand fighting. Both the longbow and crossbow were known to the author of \"Hymn to the Fallen\" and the only specification made is to \"[[Qin (state)|Qin]] bows (\u79e6\u5f13)\". The state of Qin was noted for its bows.\n\n===Armor===\n{{Main|Chinese armour|Rhinoceroses in ancient China}}\n\n[[File:Rhinoceros hide armour drawing.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Drawing of rhinoceros hide and buffalo hide armour (\u7280\u7532)]]\nRhinoceros hide armor (\u7280\u7532) is specifically mentioned in \"Hymn to the Fallen\". [[Rhinoceroses in ancient China]] were relatively common at the time of the composition of \"Hymn to the Fallen\", and Chu is noted for historical use of rhino skin armor for war. \"[t]he soldiers of Chu were equipped with armour made of sharkskin and rhinoceros hide as hard as metal or stone, and with pikes of Nanyang steel that could sting a man like a wasp or a scorpion\".<ref>Hawkes 1985, 122</ref> The [[lamellar armour]] favoured by Chu was generally constructed of many small pieces intricately sewn together, resulting in a type of armor providing a certain amount of defensive protection, while at the same time being reasonably light and flexible.\n\n===Chariots===\n{{Main|Chariots in ancient China}}\n[[File:THorseChineseChariot400BCE.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Schematic of typical chariot (\u8eca)]]\n[[File:Chariot wheel cap, China, Warring States period, 475-221 BC, bronze inlaid with silver and gold - Middlebury College Museum of Art - Middlebury, VT - DSC08217.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Chariot wheel hub/cap (\u8f42), China, Warring States period, 475-221 BC, bronze inlaid with silver and gold]]\nThe horse and [[chariot]] were key components of the type of warfare described in this verse, and had been for a long time.<ref>Beckwith 2009, 43; according to which archeological evidence shows that in China the small scale use in war of the chariot began around 1200 BCE in the late [[Shang dynasty]]</ref> [[Chariots in ancient China]] were generally light, two-wheeled vehicles pulled by two to four horses (or ponies), yoked together by one or two poles, to which the outside horses were attached by traces. Typically, on the left side of the chariot rode the charioteer who controlled the horses, generally armed only with a short sword. Beside him would be one (or more) archers armed with bows and a short sword. The short swords were in case an enemy jumped on the chariot or the personnel were forced into melee combat; however, yet of such construction as they be not so bulky that they might interfere with main duties onboard. Typically, protecting the right side was a soldier armed with the ''ge'', a lengthy and lethal hand weapon. In battle, the tactical aim for chariots was generally to avoid direct contact with the enemy, and instead inflict damage at a relatively safe distance, charging towards the enemy ranks, discharging a volley of arrows/bolts, and wheeling away to a safe distance. Then, repeat. If the chariots got stuck in mud, hemmed in, or the wheels damaged or otherwise disabled they were likely to be quite at a disadvantage if attacked by foot soldiers armed with ''ge'', swords, axes, or other melee weapons, especially if the foot soldiers maintained disciplined formations.\n\n===Military organization===\n{{Further|The Art of War}}\nMilitary discipline was key component in the warfare depicted in \"Hymn to the Fallen\"; that is, the ordering of the army so as to be most effective in tactics and responsive to command.

The infalling gas collides with gas already in the cluster and is [[Shocks and Discontinuities (MHD)|shock]] heated to between 10<sup>7</sup> and 10<sup>8</sup> K depending on the size of the cluster. This very hot gas emits X-rays by thermal bremsstrahlung emission, and [[spectral line|line emission]] from metals (in astronomy, 'metals' often means all elements except [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]).

The infalling matter has [[angular momentum]], which means that the material cannot fall in directly, but spins around the black hole. This material often forms an [[accretion disk]]. Similar luminous accretion disks can also form around [[white dwarf]]s and neutron stars, but in these the infalling gas releases additional energy as it slams against the high-[[density]] surface with high speed. In case of a neutron star, the infall speed can be a sizeable fraction of the speed of light.{{clear}}\nIn some neutron star or white dwarf systems, the [[magnetic field]] of the star is strong enough to prevent the formation of an accretion disc. The material in the disc gets very hot because of friction, and emits X-rays. The material in the disc slowly loses its angular momentum and falls into the compact star. In neutron stars and white dwarfs, additional X-rays are generated when the material hits their surfaces. X-ray emission from black holes is variable, varying in [[luminosity]] in very short timescales.

When combined with the rapid rotation that most brown dwarfs exhibit, [[convection]] sets up conditions for the development of a strong, tangled magnetic field near the surface. The flare observed by [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] from LP 944-20 could have its origin in the turbulent magnetized hot material beneath the brown dwarf's surface. A sub-surface flare could conduct heat to the atmosphere, allowing electric currents to flow and produce an X-ray flare, like a stroke of [[lightning]]. The absence of X-rays from LP 944-20 during the non-flaring period is also a significant result.

As shown by the swept-back appearance in the illustration, gusts of particles from the Sun also distort Jupiter's magnetic field, and on occasion produce auroras.\n\nSaturn's X-ray spectrum is similar to that of X-rays from the Sun indicating that Saturn's X-radiation is due to the reflection of solar X-rays by Saturn's atmosphere. The optical image is much brighter, and shows the beautiful ring structures, which were not detected in X-rays.{{clear}}\n\n== X-ray fluorescence ==\nSome of the detected X-rays, originating from solar system bodies other than the Sun, are produced by [[fluorescence]]. Scattered solar X-rays provide an additional component.\n\nIn the R\u00f6ntgensatellit (ROSAT) image of the Moon, pixel brightness corresponds to X-ray intensity. The bright lunar hemisphere shines in X-rays because it re-emits X-rays originating from the sun. The background sky has an X-ray glow in part due to the myriad of distant, powerful active galaxies, unresolved in the ROSAT picture. The dark side of the Moon's disk shadows this X-ray background radiation coming from the deep space. A few X-rays only seem to come from the shadowed lunar hemisphere. Instead, they originate in Earth's geocorona or extended atmosphere which surrounds the orbiting X-ray observatory.

This causes the solar wind to light up with X-rays, and that's what Swift's XRT sees\", said Stefan Immler, of the Goddard Space Flight Center. This interaction, called charge exchange, results in X-rays from most comets when they pass within about three times Earth's distance from the sun. Because Lulin is so active, its atomic cloud is especially dense.

It had been classed as a normal pulsar because of its fast spin (3.1 s<sup>\u22121</sup>) and pulsar-like spectrum. RXTE caught four magnetar-like X-ray bursts on 31 May 2006, and another on 27 July 2006. Although none of these events lasted longer than 0.14-second, they all packed the wallop of at least 75,000 Suns. \"Never before has a regular pulsar been observed to produce magnetar bursts\", says Gavriil.<ref name=Naeye />\n\n\"Young, fast-spinning pulsars were not thought to have enough magnetic energy to generate such powerful bursts\", says Marjorie Gonzalez, formerly of McGill University in Montreal, Canada, now based at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. \"Here's a normal pulsar that's acting like a magnetar.\"<ref name=Naeye />\n[[File:213032main chandra before after 226.jpg|thumb|300px|These [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] images show PSR J1846-0258 in Kes 75 on October 2000 (left) and June 2006 (right).

The fact that PSR J1846's spin rate is decelerating also means that it has a strong magnetic field braking the rotation. The implied magnetic field is trillions of times stronger than Earth's field, but it's 10 to 100 times weaker than a typical magnetar. [[Victoria Kaspi]] of [[McGill University]] notes, \"PSR J1846's actual magnetic field could be much stronger than the measured amount, suggesting that many young neutron stars classified as pulsars might actually be magnetars in disguise, and that the true strength of their magnetic field only reveals itself over thousands of years as they ramp up in activity.\"<ref name=Naeye />{{clear}}\n\n== X-ray dark stars ==\n{{Main|X-ray dark star}}\nDuring the solar cycle, as shown in the sequence of images of the [[X-ray astronomy#Sun|Sun in X-rays]], the Sun is almost X-ray dark, almost an X-ray variable.

The flare observed by [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] from LP 944-20 could have its origin in the turbulent magnetized hot material beneath the brown dwarf's surface. A sub-surface flare could conduct heat to the atmosphere, allowing electric currents to flow and produce an X-ray flare, like a stroke of [[lightning]]. The absence of X-rays from LP 944-20 during the non-flaring period is also a significant result.

As shown by the swept-back appearance in the illustration, gusts of particles from the Sun also distort Jupiter's magnetic field, and on occasion produce auroras.\n\nSaturn's X-ray spectrum is similar to that of X-rays from the Sun indicating that Saturn's X-radiation is due to the reflection of solar X-rays by Saturn's atmosphere. The optical image is much brighter, and shows the beautiful ring structures, which were not detected in X-rays.{{clear}}\n\n== X-ray fluorescence ==\nSome of the detected X-rays, originating from solar system bodies other than the Sun, are produced by [[fluorescence]]. Scattered solar X-rays provide an additional component.\n\nIn the R\u00f6ntgensatellit (ROSAT) image of the Moon, pixel brightness corresponds to X-ray intensity. The bright lunar hemisphere shines in X-rays because it re-emits X-rays originating from the sun. The background sky has an X-ray glow in part due to the myriad of distant, powerful active galaxies, unresolved in the ROSAT picture. The dark side of the Moon's disk shadows this X-ray background radiation coming from the deep space. A few X-rays only seem to come from the shadowed lunar hemisphere. Instead, they originate in Earth's geocorona or extended atmosphere which surrounds the orbiting X-ray observatory.

This causes the solar wind to light up with X-rays, and that's what Swift's XRT sees\", said Stefan Immler, of the Goddard Space Flight Center. This interaction, called charge exchange, results in X-rays from most comets when they pass within about three times Earth's distance from the sun. Because Lulin is so active, its atomic cloud is especially dense.

Astronomers would like to know if magnetars represent a rare class of pulsars, or if some or all pulsars go through a magnetar phase during their life cycles. NASA's [[Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer]] (RXTE) has revealed that the youngest known pulsing neutron star has thrown a temper tantrum. The collapsed star occasionally unleashes powerful bursts of X-rays, which are forcing astronomers to rethink the life cycle of neutron stars.\n\n\"We are watching one type of neutron star literally change into another right before our very eyes. This is a long-sought missing link between different types of pulsars\", says Fotis Gavriil of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore.<ref name=Naeye>{{cite web |author=Naeye R |title=Powerful Explosions Suggest Neutron Star Missing Link |year=2008|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2008/magnetar_hybrid.html}}</ref>\n[[File:213034main kes 75 226.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] image shows the supernova Kes 75 with the young, normal pulsar, neutron star PSR J1846-0258 in the center of the blue area at the top.]]\n\nPSR J1846-0258 is in the constellation Aquila. It had been classed as a normal pulsar because of its fast spin (3.1 s<sup>\u22121</sup>) and pulsar-like spectrum. RXTE caught four magnetar-like X-ray bursts on 31 May 2006, and another on 27 July 2006. Although none of these events lasted longer than 0.14-second, they all packed the wallop of at least 75,000 Suns. \"Never before has a regular pulsar been observed to produce magnetar bursts\", says Gavriil.<ref name=Naeye />\n\n\"Young, fast-spinning pulsars were not thought to have enough magnetic energy to generate such powerful bursts\", says Marjorie Gonzalez, formerly of McGill University in Montreal, Canada, now based at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. \"Here's a normal pulsar that's acting like a magnetar.\"<ref name=Naeye />\n[[File:213032main chandra before after 226.jpg|thumb|300px|These [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] images show PSR J1846-0258 in Kes 75 on October 2000 (left) and June 2006 (right).

The fact that PSR J1846's spin rate is decelerating also means that it has a strong magnetic field braking the rotation. The implied magnetic field is trillions of times stronger than Earth's field, but it's 10 to 100 times weaker than a typical magnetar. [[Victoria Kaspi]] of [[McGill University]] notes, \"PSR J1846's actual magnetic field could be much stronger than the measured amount, suggesting that many young neutron stars classified as pulsars might actually be magnetars in disguise, and that the true strength of their magnetic field only reveals itself over thousands of years as they ramp up in activity.\"<ref name=Naeye />{{clear}}\n\n== X-ray dark stars ==\n{{Main|X-ray dark star}}\nDuring the solar cycle, as shown in the sequence of images of the [[X-ray astronomy#Sun|Sun in X-rays]], the Sun is almost X-ray dark, almost an X-ray variable.
