The bureau was split into naval and army sections which, over time, specialised in foreign espionage and internal counter-espionage activities, respectively. This specialisation was because the Admiralty wanted to know the maritime strength of the [[Imperial German Navy]]. This specialisation was formalised before 1914. During the [[First World War]] in 1916, the two sections underwent administrative changes so that the foreign section became the section MI1(c) of the [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (United Kingdom)|Directorate of Military Intelligence]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sis.gov.uk/output/Page470.html |title=SIS Records&nbsp;\u2014 War Office Military Intelligence (MI) Sections in the First World War |publisher=Sis.gov.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820014944/http://www.sis.gov.uk/output/Page470.html |archivedate=20 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIts first director was [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming|Captain Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming]], who often dropped the ''Smith'' in routine communication.

In August 1919, Cumming created the new passport control department, providing diplomatic cover for agents abroad.

At this time, the organisation was known in [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Whitehall]] by a variety of titles including the ''Foreign Intelligence Service'', the ''Secret Service'', ''MI1(c)'', the ''Special Intelligence Service'' and even ''C's organisation''. Around 1920, it began increasingly to be referred to as the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), a title that it has continued to use to the present day and which was enshrined in statute in the Intelligence Services Act 1994. During the Second World War, the name MI6 was used as a flag of convenience, the name by which it is frequently known in popular culture since.<ref name=\"sisweb\" />\n\nIn the immediate post-war years under [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming|Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming]] and throughout most of the 1920s, SIS was focused on Communism, in particular, Russian Bolshevism.

The intelligence gleaned from this source, codenamed \"[[Ultra]]\" by the British, was a substantial aid to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort.<ref>Much of the German cipher traffic was encrypted on the Enigma machine, and the term \"Ultra\" has often been used almost synonymously with \"[[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma decrypts]]\". Ultra also encompassed decrypts of the German [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz SZ 40 and 42 machines]] that were used by the German High Command, and decrypts of [[C-36 (cipher machine)|Hagelin ciphers]] and other Italian ciphers and codes, as well as of Japanese ciphers and codes such as [[Purple (cipher machine)|Purple]] and [[JN-25]].</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the [[HUMINT|human intelligence]] work of the service was complemented by several other initiatives:\n* The [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalytic]] effort undertaken by the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&CS), the bureau responsible for interception and decryption of foreign communications at [[Bletchley Park]].

By distributing the [[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]] material collected by the [[Government Code & Cypher School]], for the first time, MI6 became an important branch of the government. Extensive breaches of Nazi [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] signals gave Menzies and his team enormous insight into [[Adolf Hitler]]'s strategy, and this was kept a closely held secret.{{sfn|Winterbotham|1974|pp=154, 191}}\n\nThe British intelligence services signed a special agreement with their allied Polish counterparts 1940. In July 2005, the British and Polish governments jointly produced a two-volume study of bilateral intelligence cooperation in the War, which revealed information that had until then been officially secret. The ''Report of the Anglo-Polish Historical Committee'' was written by leading historians and experts who had been granted unprecedented access to British intelligence archives, and concluded that 48 percent of all reports received by British secret services from continental Europe in 1939\u201345 had come from Polish sources.<ref name=\"google1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EJ5vIyDBpLcC&pg=PA234 |title=The Eagle Unbowed: Poland and the Poles in the Second World War |first=Halik |last=Kochanski |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0674068148|pages=234-235}}</ref> This was facilitated by the fact that occupied Poland had a tradition of insurgency organizations passed down through generations, with networks in emigre Polish communities in Germany and France. A major part of Polish resistance activity was clandestine and involved cellular intelligence networks; while Nazi Germany used Poles as forced labourers across the continent, putting them in a unique position to spy on the enemy. Liaison was undertaken by SIS officer [[Wilfred Dunderdale]], and reports included advanced warning of the [[Afrikakorps]]' departure for Libya, awareness of the readiness of Vichy French units to fight against the Allies or switch sides in [[Operation Torch]], and advance warning both of [[Operation Barbarossa]] and [[Operation Edelweiss]], the German Caucasus campaign. [[Armia Krajowa and V-1 and V-2|Polish-sourced reporting on German secret weapons]] began in 1941, and [[Operation Most III|Operation Wildhorn]] enabled a British special operations flight to airlift a [[V-2 Rocket]] that had been captured by the Polish resistance. Polish secret agent [[Jan Karski]] delivered the British the first Allied intelligence on the [[Holocaust]]. Via a female Polish agent, the British also had a channel to the anti-Nazi chief of the [[Abwehr]], Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]].<ref name=\"google1\"/>\n\nThe most significant failure of the service during the war was known as the [[Venlo incident]], named for the Dutch town where much of the operation took place. Agents of the German army secret service, the ''[[Abwehr]]'', and the counter-espionage section of the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD), posed as high-ranking officers involved in a plot to depose [[Hitler]]. In a series of meetings between SIS agents and the 'conspirators', [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] plans to abduct the SIS team were shelved due to the presence of Dutch police. On the night of 8\u20139 November 1939, a meeting took place without police presence.

These included the defection to the SIS [[Tehran]] station in 1982 of [[KGB]] officer [[Vladimir Kuzichkin]], the son of a senior [[Politburo]] member and a member of the KGB's internal Second Chief Directorate who provided SIS and the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] with warning of the mobilisation of the KGB's Alpha Force during the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|1991 August Coup]] which briefly toppled Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955063,00.html|title=The Soviets: Coups and Killings in Kabul|date=22 November 1982|accessdate=1 July 2012|work=Time}}</ref>\n\n===After the Cold War===\nThe end of the [[Cold War]] led to a reshuffle of existing priorities. The Soviet Bloc ceased to swallow the lion's share of operational priorities, although the stability and intentions of a weakened but still nuclear-capable Federal Russia constituted a significant concern. Instead, functional rather than geographical intelligence requirements came to the fore such as [[counter-proliferation]] (via the agency's Production and Targeting, Counter-Proliferation Section) which had been a sphere of activity since the discovery of Pakistani physics students studying nuclear-weapons related subjects in 1974; counter-terrorism (via two joint sections run in collaboration with the Security Service, one for [[Irish republicanism]] and one for international terrorism); counter-narcotics and serious crime (originally set up under the [[Western Hemisphere]] controllerate in 1989); and a 'global issues' section looking at matters such as the environment and other public welfare issues. In the mid-1990s these were consolidated into a new post of Controller, Global and Functional.<ref>Davies (2004), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TTW2h5GHlWkC&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=Controller,+Global+and+Functional+mi6&source=bl&ots=vzKfe_R9rL&sig=T0y1Zqyx8plT752vCpx6t3kRdI8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj6u6Pvz-beAhWrBcAKHWIxBf0Q6AEwCnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Controller%2C%20Global%20and%20Functional%20mi6&f=false p. 354]</ref>\n\nDuring the transition, then-C Sir [[Colin McColl]] embraced a new, albeit limited, policy of openness towards the press and public, with 'public affairs' falling into the brief of Director, Counter-Intelligence and Security (renamed Director, Security and Public Affairs). McColl's policies were part and parcel with a wider 'open government initiative' developed from 1993 by the government of [[John Major]]. As part of this, SIS operations, and those of the national signals intelligence agency, [[GCHQ]], were placed on a statutory footing through the 1994 [[Intelligence Services Act 1994|Intelligence Services Act]]. Although the Act provided procedures for authorisations and warrants, this essentially enshrined mechanisms that had been in place at least since 1953 (for authorisations) and 1985 (under the [[Interception of Communications Act 1985|Interception of Communications Act]], for warrants). Under this Act, since 1994, SIS and GCHQ activities have been subject to scrutiny by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament's]] [[Intelligence and Security Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/13/pdfs/ukpga_19940013_en.pdf|title=Intelligence Services Act 1994|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the mid-1990s the British intelligence community was subjected to a comprehensive costing review by the government. As part of broader defence cut-backs SIS had its resources cut back twenty-five percent across the board and senior management was reduced by forty percent. As a consequence of these cuts, the Requirements division (formerly the Circulating Sections of the 1921 Arrangement) were deprived of any representation on the board of directors. At the same time, the Middle East and Africa controllerates were pared back and amalgamated. According to the findings of Lord Butler of Brockwell's ''Review of Weapons of Mass Destruction'', the reduction of operational capabilities in the Middle East and of the Requirements division's ability to challenge the quality of the information the Middle East Controllerate was providing weakened the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]]'s estimates of [[Iraq]]'s non-conventional weapons programmes. These weaknesses were major contributors to the UK's erroneous assessments of Iraq's 'weapons of mass destruction' prior to the 2003 invasion of that country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Politics/documents/2004/07/14/butler.pdf|title=Review of Intelligence on weapons of mass destruction|publisher=Committee led by Lord Butler|accessdate=1 July 2012|location=London}}</ref>\n\nOn one occasion in 1998, MI6 believed it might be able to obtain 'actionable intelligence' which could help the CIA capture [[Osama Bin Laden]], the leader of [[Al Qaeda]]. But given that this might result in his being transferred or rendered to the United States, MI6 decided it had to ask for ministerial approval before passing the intelligence on (in case he faced the death penalty or mistreatment). This was approved by a minister 'provided the CIA gave assurances regarding humane treatment'. In the end, not enough intelligence came through to make it worthwhile going ahead.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.313</ref>\n\nIn 2001, it became clear that working with [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] and his [[Northern Alliance|forces]] was the best option for going after Bin Laden; the priority for MI6 was developing intelligence coverage. The first real sources were being established, although no one penetrated the upper tier of the Al Qaeda leadership itself. As the year progressed, plans were drawn up and slowly worked their way up to the [[White House]] on 4 September 2001-which involved increasing dramatically support for Massoud. MI6 were involved in these plans.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.313-314</ref>\n\n===War on Terror===\nDuring the [[Global War on Terror]], SIS accepted information from the CIA that was obtained through [[torture]], including the [[extraordinary rendition by the United States|extraordinary rendition]] programme.

At the end of the month, a handful of MI6 officers with a budget of $7 million landed in northeast Afghanistan, where they met with General [[Mohammed Fahim]] of the [[Northern Alliance]] and began working with other contacts in the north and south to build alliances, secure support, and to bribe as many [[Taliban]] commanders as they could to change sides or leave the fight.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.335</ref>\n\nDuring the [[United States invasion of Afghanistan]], the SIS established a presence in [[Kabul]] following its [[Fall of Kabul|fall to the coalition]].<ref>Farrell, Theo, ''Unwinnable: Britain\u2019s War in Afghanistan, 2001\u20132014'', Bodley Head, 2017 {{ISBN|1847923461|978-1847923462}}, P.82</ref> MI6 members and the British [[Special Boat Service]] took part in the [[Battle of Tora Bora]].<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.338</ref> After members of the 22nd [[Special Air Service|Special Air Service (SAS) Regiment]] returned to the UK in mid-December 2001, members of both territorial SAS regiments remained in the country to provide close protection to SIS members.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.75</ref> \n\nIn mid-December, MI6 officers who had been deployed to the region began to interview prisoners held by the Northern Alliance. In January 2002, they began interviewing prisoners held by the Americans. On 10 January 2002, an MI6 officer conducted his first interview of a detainee held by the Americans. He reported back to London that there were aspects of the way the detainee had been handled by the US military before the interview that did not appear consistent with the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Two days after the interview, he was sent instructions, copied to all MI5 and MI6 officers in Afghanistan, about how to deal with concerns over mistreatment, referring to signs of abuse: \"Given that they are not within our custody or control, the law does not require you to intervene to protect this.\" It went on to say that the Americans had to understand that the UK did not condone such mistreatment and that a complaint should be made to a senior US official if there was any coercion by the US in conjunction with an MI6 interview.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.339</ref>\n\nIn the run-up to the [[invasion of Iraq in 2003]], it is alleged, although not confirmed, that some SIS members conducted [[Operation Mass Appeal]] which was a campaign to plant stories about Iraq's WMDs in the media.

In the months after the invasion, they also began gathering political intelligence; predicting what would happen in post-Baathist Iraq. MI6 personnel in the country never exceeded 50; in early 2004, apart from supporting [[Task Force 88 (anti-terrorist unit)#Task Force Black/Knight|Task Force Black]] in hunting down former senior Ba'athist party members, MI6 also made an effort to target \"transnational terrorism\"/jihadist networks that led to the SAS carrying out Operation Aston in February 2004: They conducted a raid on a house in Baghdad that was part of a \"jihadist pipeline\" that ran from Iran to Iraq that US and UK intelligence agencies were tracking suspects on \u2013 the raid captured members of [[Lashkar-e-Taiba|Pakistan based terrorist group]].<ref name=\"urban\">Urban, Mark, ''Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq '', St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 {{ISBN|1250006961}} {{ISBN|978-1250006967}}, pp.10\u201311, p.13, p.15, p.18\u201319, p.50-55, p.56-57, p.67-68, p.95-96, p.101, p.249</ref>\n\nShortly before the [[Second Battle of Fallujah]], MI6 personnel visited [[Joint Special Operations Command|JSOC]]s TSF (Temporary Screening Facility) at [[Balad Air Base]] to question a suspected insurgent. Afterwards they raised concerns about the poor detention conditions there. As a result the British government informed JSOC in Iraq that prisoners captured by British special forces would only be turned over to JSOC if there was an undertaking not to send them to Balad. In Spring 2005, the SAS detachment operating in Basra and southern Iraq, known as Operation Hathor, escorted MI6 case officers into Basra so they could meet their sources and handlers. MI6 provided information that enabled the detachment to carry out surveillance operations. MI6 were also involved in resolving the [[Basra prison incident]]; the SIS played a central role in the British withdrawal from Basra in 2007.<ref name=\"urban\"/>\n\nIn Afghanistan, MI6 worked closely with the military, delivering tactical information and working in small cells alongside Special Forces, surveillance teams, and GCHQ to track individuals from the Taliban and Al Qaeda.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.399-400</ref>\n\nThe first MI6 knew of the US carrying out the [[Death of Osama bin Laden#Operation Neptune Spear|mission that killed Osama Bin Laden]] on 2 May 2011 was after it happened, when its chief called his American counterpart for an explanation.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.351</ref> In July 2011 it was reported that SIS had closed several of its stations, particularly in Iraq, where it had several outposts in the south of the country in the region of Basra.

A third individual was branded a British spy in the Balkans and left the office of the High Representative in Bosnia, whilst a further two British intelligence officers working in [[Zagreb]], remained in place despite their cover being blown in the local press. The exposure of the agents across the three capitals has markedly undermined the British intelligence operations in the area, including SIS efforts to capture The Hague's most wanted men, which riled many local intelligence agencies in the Balkans, some of which are suspected of continuing ties to alleged war criminals. They were riled due to MI6 operating \"not so much a spy network as a network of influence within Balkan security services and the media,\" said the director of the International Crisis Group in Serbia and Bosnia, which caused some of them to be \"upset\". In Serbia, the SIS station chief was forced to leave his post in August 2004 after a campaign against him led by country's DB intelligence agency, where his work investigating the [[Assassination of Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107|2003 assassination]] of the reformist prime minister [[Zoran Djindjic]] won him few friends.<ref name=\"MI6 spies exposed by Balkan rivals\"/>\n\nOn 15 November 2006, SIS allowed an interview with current operations officers for the first time. The interview was on the [[Colin Murray]] Show on [[BBC Radio 1]]. The two officers (one male and one female) had their voices disguised for security reasons. The officers compared their real experience with the fictional portrayal of SIS in the [[James Bond films]]. While denying that there ever existed a \"[[licence to kill (concept)|licence to kill]]\" and reiterating that SIS operated under British law, the officers confirmed that there is a '[[Q (James Bond)|Q]]'-like figure who is head of the technology department, and that their director is referred to as 'C'. The officers described the lifestyle as quite glamorous and very varied, with plenty of overseas travel and adventure, and described their role primarily as intelligence gatherers, developing relationships with potential sources.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1534306/MI6-licensed-to-thrill-listeners-to-Radio-1.html|title=MI6 licensed to thrill listeners to Radio 1|date=16 November 2006|accessdate=1 July 2012|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Philip|last=Johnston}}</ref>\n\nSir [[John Sawers]] became head of the SIS in November 2009, the first outsider to head SIS in more than 40 years.

It was tasked by the [[Director Special Forces]] to support MI6's operations (akin to the CIA's [[Special Activities Center|SAC]] \u2013 a covert paramilitary unit for SIS). It was not a formal squadron within the establishment of any individual UK Special Forces unit, but at the disposal of both the Director Special Forces and the SIS; previously, SIS relied primarily on contractor personnel. The Squadron carried out missions that required 'maximum discretion' in places that were 'off the radar or considered dangerous'; the Squadron's members often operated in plain clothes, with the full range of national support, such as false identities at its disposal. In early March 2011, during the Libyan Civil War, a covert operation in Libya involving E Squadron went wrong: The aim of the mission was to cement SIS's contacts with the rebels by flying in two SIS agents in a [[Chinook helicopter]] to meet a Libyan Intermediary in a town near Benghazi, who had promised to fix them up a meeting with the [[National Transitional Council|NTC]]. A team consisting of six E Squadron members (all from the SAS) and two SIS officers were flown into Libya by an RAF Special Forces Flight Chinook; the Squadron's members were carrying bags containing arms, ammunition, explosives, computers, maps and passports from at least four nationalities. Despite technical backup, the team landed in Libya without any prior agreement with the rebel leadership, and the plan failed as soon as the team landed. The locals became suspicious they were foreign mercenaries or spies and the team was detained by rebel forces and taken to a military base in Benghazi. They were then hauled before a senior rebel leader; the team told him that they were in the country to determine the rebels' needs and to offer assistance, but the discovery of British troops on the ground enraged the rebels who were fearful that Gaddafi would use such evidence to destroy the credibility of the NTC. Negotiations between senior rebel leaders and British officials in London finally led to their release and they were allowed to board [[HMS Cumberland (F85)|HMS Cumberland]].<ref>Stuart, Mark Muller, ''Storm in the Desert: Britain's Intervention in Libya and the Arab Spring'', Birlinn Ltd, 2017, {{ISBN|1780274521}}, {{ISBN|978-1780274522}}</ref><ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.296, p.314</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16624401|title=SAS on ground during Libya crisis|work=BBC News|date=19 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 November 2011 SIS warned the national transitional council in Benghazi after discovering details of planned strikes, said foreign secretary [[William Hague]]. 'The agencies obtained firm intelligence, were able to warn the NTC of the threat, and the attacks were prevented,' he said. In a rare speech on the intelligence agencies, he praised the key role played by SIS and GCHQ in bringing Gaddafi's 42-year dictatorship to an end, describing them as 'vital assets' with a 'fundamental and indispensable role' in keeping the nation safe. 'They worked to identify key political figures, develop contacts with the emerging opposition and provide political and military intelligence. 'Most importantly, they saved lives,' he said. The speech follows criticism that SIS had been too close to the Libyan regime and was involved in the extraordinary rendition of anti-Gaddafi activists. Mr Hague also defended controversial proposals for secrecy in civil courts in cases involving intelligence material.<ref name=\"Radnedge\"/>\n\nThe ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' reported in November 2011 that SIS helped capture [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]]. The top-secret mission, dubbed Operation X to disguise its purpose, used modern electronic intelligence (ELINT) technologies to bug him along with his friends and family. Gaddafi had been hiding out in the desert for a month but the breakthrough came when he made two phone calls, one after the other, to say he was safe. It allowed the joint British and French bugging operation to pinpoint his location.

The bureau was split into naval and army sections which, over time, specialised in foreign espionage and internal counter-espionage activities, respectively. This specialisation was because the Admiralty wanted to know the maritime strength of the [[Imperial German Navy]]. This specialisation was formalised before 1914. During the [[First World War]] in 1916, the two sections underwent administrative changes so that the foreign section became the section MI1(c) of the [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (United Kingdom)|Directorate of Military Intelligence]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sis.gov.uk/output/Page470.html |title=SIS Records&nbsp;\u2014 War Office Military Intelligence (MI) Sections in the First World War |publisher=Sis.gov.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820014944/http://www.sis.gov.uk/output/Page470.html |archivedate=20 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIts first director was [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming|Captain Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming]], who often dropped the ''Smith'' in routine communication.

In August 1919, Cumming created the new passport control department, providing diplomatic cover for agents abroad.

At this time, the organisation was known in [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Whitehall]] by a variety of titles including the ''Foreign Intelligence Service'', the ''Secret Service'', ''MI1(c)'', the ''Special Intelligence Service'' and even ''C's organisation''. Around 1920, it began increasingly to be referred to as the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), a title that it has continued to use to the present day and which was enshrined in statute in the Intelligence Services Act 1994. During the Second World War, the name MI6 was used as a flag of convenience, the name by which it is frequently known in popular culture since.<ref name=\"sisweb\" />\n\nIn the immediate post-war years under [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming|Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming]] and throughout most of the 1920s, SIS was focused on Communism, in particular, Russian Bolshevism.

[[Armia Krajowa and V-1 and V-2|Polish-sourced reporting on German secret weapons]] began in 1941, and [[Operation Most III|Operation Wildhorn]] enabled a British special operations flight to airlift a [[V-2 Rocket]] that had been captured by the Polish resistance.

McColl's policies were part and parcel with a wider 'open government initiative' developed from 1993 by the government of [[John Major]]. As part of this, SIS operations, and those of the national signals intelligence agency, [[GCHQ]], were placed on a statutory footing through the 1994 [[Intelligence Services Act 1994|Intelligence Services Act]]. Although the Act provided procedures for authorisations and warrants, this essentially enshrined mechanisms that had been in place at least since 1953 (for authorisations) and 1985 (under the [[Interception of Communications Act 1985|Interception of Communications Act]], for warrants). Under this Act, since 1994, SIS and GCHQ activities have been subject to scrutiny by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament's]] [[Intelligence and Security Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/13/pdfs/ukpga_19940013_en.pdf|title=Intelligence Services Act 1994|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the mid-1990s the British intelligence community was subjected to a comprehensive costing review by the government. As part of broader defence cut-backs SIS had its resources cut back twenty-five percent across the board and senior management was reduced by forty percent. As a consequence of these cuts, the Requirements division (formerly the Circulating Sections of the 1921 Arrangement) were deprived of any representation on the board of directors. At the same time, the Middle East and Africa controllerates were pared back and amalgamated. According to the findings of Lord Butler of Brockwell's ''Review of Weapons of Mass Destruction'', the reduction of operational capabilities in the Middle East and of the Requirements division's ability to challenge the quality of the information the Middle East Controllerate was providing weakened the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]]'s estimates of [[Iraq]]'s non-conventional weapons programmes. These weaknesses were major contributors to the UK's erroneous assessments of Iraq's 'weapons of mass destruction' prior to the 2003 invasion of that country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Politics/documents/2004/07/14/butler.pdf|title=Review of Intelligence on weapons of mass destruction|publisher=Committee led by Lord Butler|accessdate=1 July 2012|location=London}}</ref>\n\nOn one occasion in 1998, MI6 believed it might be able to obtain 'actionable intelligence' which could help the CIA capture [[Osama Bin Laden]], the leader of [[Al Qaeda]]. But given that this might result in his being transferred or rendered to the United States, MI6 decided it had to ask for ministerial approval before passing the intelligence on (in case he faced the death penalty or mistreatment). This was approved by a minister 'provided the CIA gave assurances regarding humane treatment'. In the end, not enough intelligence came through to make it worthwhile going ahead.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.313</ref>\n\nIn 2001, it became clear that working with [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] and his [[Northern Alliance|forces]] was the best option for going after Bin Laden; the priority for MI6 was developing intelligence coverage.

In January 2002, they began interviewing prisoners held by the Americans. On 10 January 2002, an MI6 officer conducted his first interview of a detainee held by the Americans. He reported back to London that there were aspects of the way the detainee had been handled by the US military before the interview that did not appear consistent with the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Two days after the interview, he was sent instructions, copied to all MI5 and MI6 officers in Afghanistan, about how to deal with concerns over mistreatment, referring to signs of abuse: \"Given that they are not within our custody or control, the law does not require you to intervene to protect this.\" It went on to say that the Americans had to understand that the UK did not condone such mistreatment and that a complaint should be made to a senior US official if there was any coercion by the US in conjunction with an MI6 interview.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.339</ref>\n\nIn the run-up to the [[invasion of Iraq in 2003]], it is alleged, although not confirmed, that some SIS members conducted [[Operation Mass Appeal]] which was a campaign to plant stories about Iraq's WMDs in the media.

In Spring 2005, the SAS detachment operating in Basra and southern Iraq, known as Operation Hathor, escorted MI6 case officers into Basra so they could meet their sources and handlers.

A third individual was branded a British spy in the Balkans and left the office of the High Representative in Bosnia, whilst a further two British intelligence officers working in [[Zagreb]], remained in place despite their cover being blown in the local press. The exposure of the agents across the three capitals has markedly undermined the British intelligence operations in the area, including SIS efforts to capture The Hague's most wanted men, which riled many local intelligence agencies in the Balkans, some of which are suspected of continuing ties to alleged war criminals. They were riled due to MI6 operating \"not so much a spy network as a network of influence within Balkan security services and the media,\" said the director of the International Crisis Group in Serbia and Bosnia, which caused some of them to be \"upset\". In Serbia, the SIS station chief was forced to leave his post in August 2004 after a campaign against him led by country's DB intelligence agency, where his work investigating the [[Assassination of Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107|2003 assassination]] of the reformist prime minister [[Zoran Djindjic]] won him few friends.<ref name=\"MI6 spies exposed by Balkan rivals\"/>\n\nOn 15 November 2006, SIS allowed an interview with current operations officers for the first time. The interview was on the [[Colin Murray]] Show on [[BBC Radio 1]]. The two officers (one male and one female) had their voices disguised for security reasons. The officers compared their real experience with the fictional portrayal of SIS in the [[James Bond films]]. While denying that there ever existed a \"[[licence to kill (concept)|licence to kill]]\" and reiterating that SIS operated under British law, the officers confirmed that there is a '[[Q (James Bond)|Q]]'-like figure who is head of the technology department, and that their director is referred to as 'C'. The officers described the lifestyle as quite glamorous and very varied, with plenty of overseas travel and adventure, and described their role primarily as intelligence gatherers, developing relationships with potential sources.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1534306/MI6-licensed-to-thrill-listeners-to-Radio-1.html|title=MI6 licensed to thrill listeners to Radio 1|date=16 November 2006|accessdate=1 July 2012|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Philip|last=Johnston}}</ref>\n\nSir [[John Sawers]] became head of the SIS in November 2009, the first outsider to head SIS in more than 40 years.

It was tasked by the [[Director Special Forces]] to support MI6's operations (akin to the CIA's [[Special Activities Center|SAC]] \u2013 a covert paramilitary unit for SIS). It was not a formal squadron within the establishment of any individual UK Special Forces unit, but at the disposal of both the Director Special Forces and the SIS; previously, SIS relied primarily on contractor personnel. The Squadron carried out missions that required 'maximum discretion' in places that were 'off the radar or considered dangerous'; the Squadron's members often operated in plain clothes, with the full range of national support, such as false identities at its disposal. In early March 2011, during the Libyan Civil War, a covert operation in Libya involving E Squadron went wrong: The aim of the mission was to cement SIS's contacts with the rebels by flying in two SIS agents in a [[Chinook]] helicopter to meet a Libyan Intermediary in a town near Benghazi, who had promised to fix them up a meeting with the [[National Transitional Council|NTC]]. A team consisting of six E Squadron members (all from the SAS) and two SIS officers were flown into Libya by an RAF Special Forces Flight Chinook; the Squadron's members were carrying bags containing arms, ammunition, explosives, computers, maps and passports from at least four nationalities. Despite technical backup, the team landed in Libya without any prior agreement with the rebel leadership, and the plan failed as soon as the team landed. The locals became suspicious they were foreign mercenaries or spies and the team was detained by rebel forces and taken to a military base in Benghazi. They were then hauled before a senior rebel leader; the team told him that they were in the country to determine the rebels' needs and to offer assistance, but the discovery of British troops on the ground enraged the rebels who were fearful that Gaddafi would use such evidence to destroy the credibility of the NTC. Negotiations between senior rebel leaders and British officials in London finally led to their release and they were allowed to board [[HMS Cumberland (F85)|HMS Cumberland]].<ref>Stuart, Mark Muller, ''Storm in the Desert: Britain's Intervention in Libya and the Arab Spring'', Birlinn Ltd, 2017, {{ISBN|1780274521}}, {{ISBN|978-1780274522}}</ref><ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.296, p.314</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16624401|title=SAS on ground during Libya crisis|work=BBC News|date=19 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 November 2011 SIS warned the national transitional council in Benghazi after discovering details of planned strikes, said foreign secretary [[William Hague]]. 'The agencies obtained firm intelligence, were able to warn the NTC of the threat, and the attacks were prevented,' he said. In a rare speech on the intelligence agencies, he praised the key role played by SIS and GCHQ in bringing Gaddafi's 42-year dictatorship to an end, describing them as 'vital assets' with a 'fundamental and indispensable role' in keeping the nation safe. 'They worked to identify key political figures, develop contacts with the emerging opposition and provide political and military intelligence. 'Most importantly, they saved lives,' he said.

{"title_page": "Fourth out", "text_new": "In [[baseball]], the '''fourth out''' is a legal [[out (baseball)|out]] made by the defense after three outs in a half-inning already have been made.  According to the rules, the third out does not cause the ball to become [[dead ball (baseball)|dead]]; if the fielders make a subsequent out that prevents a run from scoring, this out will supersede the apparent third out, thus becoming the recorded third out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/runner_7.jsp|title=MLB Official Rules 7.10|accessdate=2009-04-12|publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}</ref> For statistical purposes, the apparent third out is \"undone\" and the fourth out's result is recorded instead.  With the advent of video replay appeals, a new rationale for making extra out(s) has emerged - insurance against a prior out being undone on appeal.   These fourth out situations are not the same as [[Strikeout#More than three strikeouts in an inning|four strikeouts in an inning]].\n\n==When runs score==\nThe motivation for making a fourth out is to nullify a scored run, by either putting out the runner who had scored (on appeal, if the player failed to tag up after a catch) or putting out an additional runner who is forced to advance.\n\nNo run may score on an inning-ending play in which the third out is a [[force play|force out]] or on the [[batter-runner|batter]] before he reaches first base.  Put in other words, force outs count before runs are scored.  It is common that a runner reaches [[home plate]] a moment before the third out is made by force out.  Such a case is routine; the runner doesn't score but is counted as left on base.\n\nIt is also common that the third out might come on a non-force [[tag out]] after another runner reaches home plate.  By extension of these two rules, the \"fourth out\" covers the case where the third out is not a force out, but a subsequent out is.  Since the force out counts before the run scores, it must also count before the third out.\n\n==Examples==\nApparently there are no known MLB examples of a fourth out changing places with a prior out and thereby cancelling a run.  The situations where a fourth out may be recognized are exceedingly rare, but some hypothetical examples, and four real examples where the fourth out rule did come into play, are noted below:\n===Hypothetical examples===\n====An appeal force out====\nSuppose [[Bases loaded|three runners are on base]] with two outs, and the [[Batter (baseball)|batter]] hits the ball within the field of play for an apparent [[hit (baseball)|hit]]. Two important facts are required:\n\n# The ball has '''not''' become dead (i.e., a home run, ground-rule double, umpire interference, or fan interference).\n# The ball is not caught before hitting the ground.\n\nAll three runners cross home plate safely, but the runner who was at first misses second base while rounding the bases. After the runner from first has come around to score, the batter is then thrown out trying to stretch a bases-clearing double into a triple. The apparent play is that three runners have scored on an apparent double, with the batter out advancing.\n\n'''RULING''': The fielders have a viable [[appeal play]] at second base. If the defensive team is alert enough and understand the rules regarding fourth outs, the defensive team may make a live ball appeal that the runner who was initially at first base missed second base. If such an appeal is made, the runner from first base is out on a [[force play|force out]], because he failed to touch his [[force base]] (second base). As a result:\n*The force out, according to the rules of baseball, means that the batter is credited with a fielder's choice and not a base hit.\n*Since no run may score on a play on which the final out of a half-inning is a force out, the inning is over and no run counts. All three apparent runs come off the board.\n*The scoring is as follows: Batter grounds into fielder's choice, runner at first out at second (for failing to touch second), three runners left on base.\n\nThis rule merely places the occurrence of the force out before any tag play when it ends the inning.\n\n====Example: A non-appeal out====\nSuppose there are runners on second and third base with two outs, and the batter hits a ground ball to third base.  The runner from third scores, but the runner from second base is tagged out for the third out.  Since the runner from third reached home plate before the third out was recorded, and the third out was not a force out or on the [[batter-runner]] before reaching first base, it would seem that a run scored (and should count) before the third out was recorded.  However, suppose that the batter-runner fell down on his way to first base and was injured, unable to walk (or that, having seen the runner tagged out, turned around and headed for the dugout before reaching first base).  Then suppose that the fielders throw to first base, or tag the batter out.  Since no run can score if the last out is made on the batter before he reaches first base, this fourth out prevents a run from scoring.   Thus the runner from third is marked as [[left on base]] and his apparent run does not count; the runner from second is also left on base and his out is nullified; the batter-runner is out, which now becomes the actual third out.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n====A quick fourth out====\nThere are runners at first and third with two outs.  The runners are [[stolen base|attempting to steal]] on the pitch.  The batter grounds to the shortstop.  The runner from third base reaches home; then, the shortstop tags the runner who has rounded second (third out).  The shortstop then throws to first base, which beats the [[batter-runner]] for the fourth out.  The fourth out is [[Force play|on the batter before he reaches first base]], so it replaces the apparent third out and nullifies the run.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n===Real examples===\n====A missed fourth out allows a run to score (1989)====\nOn July 1, 1989, in the bottom of the eighth inning in a game between the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|old Yankee Stadium]], the Yankees scored a run because the Brewers failed to record a fourth out.\n\nWith one out, [[Mike Pagliarulo]] on third base, and [[Bob Geren]] on first base, Yankees shortstop [[Wayne Tolleson]] attempted a suicide squeeze that was caught by Brewers pitcher [[Jay Aldrich]]. Both Pagliarulo and Geren broke on contact without tagging up from their respective bases, and Aldrich, noticing this, threw to first baseman [[Greg Brock (baseball)|Greg Brock]] to double off Geren from first base, but not until after Pagliarulo crossed home plate. Upon doubling off Geren, the Brewers left the field, thinking the inning was over and the run did not count. \n\nHad Aldrich thrown more quickly to first base to double off Geren - prior to Pagliarulo crossing the plate - no run would have scored. The catching of the line drive before it had touched the ground eliminated the [[force play]], turning the play into a \"time play\", requiring the [[Umpire (baseball)|home plate umpire]] (for this game, [[Larry Barnett]]) to judge the position of Pagliarulo at the time Aldrich had doubled off Geren. Alternatively, had Aldrich let the ball drop (without [[Infield fly rule#Intentional drop rule|catching the ball and letting it fall out of his glove to the ground]]) and then thrown to second baseman [[Jim Gantner]] or shortstop [[Gary Sheffield]] to begin a 1-4-3 or 1-6-3 double play (Aldrich-Gantner or Sheffield-Brock), the run would not have counted since a run cannot score when the final out of a half-inning is a [[Force play|force out]] or a ground out (presuming Geren was forced at second and Tolleson was out at first). After all of the Brewers players had left fair territory (and therefore losing the chance to launch an [[appeal play]] to appeal Pagliarulo's failure to tag from third base), Barnett awarded the run to the Yankees as per Rule 7.10(a) (now Rule 5.09(c)).<ref name=Rule710>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2016/official_baseball_rules.pdf|title=MLB Official Rules (revised 2016)|accessdate=24 October 2016}}</ref> \n\nIf the Brewers had launched an [[appeal play]] at third base before leaving the field to garner a fourth out, Pagliarulo's failure to tag from third base would have become the actual third out of the inning and the run would not have scored, and this out would have taken precedence because it would have erased the run. As Barnett explained after the game: ''\u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018fourth-out\u2019 situation. Milwaukee had to throw the ball to third base for what would be the fourth out. Then they can choose to make that one the final out and prevent the run from scoring. But Milwaukee didn\u2019t do that.\u201d''<ref name=Comeback>{{citeweb|url=http://thecomeback.com/mlb/mets-beat-padres-6-3-fourth-out.html|title=Getting a fourth out in the third inning proved vital for the Mets in a 6-3 win over the Padres|work=The Comeback|author=Bucholtz, Andrew|date=25 July 2018|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n====A missed fourth out allows a run to score (2009)====\nOn April 12, 2009, in the top of the second inning in a game between the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] at [[Chase Field]], the Dodgers scored a run because the Diamondbacks failed to record a fourth out in a play similar to the Yankees-Brewers game in 1989. \n\nWith one out, right fielder [[Juan Pierre]] on second base, and left fielder [[Andre Ethier]] on third base, Dodgers pitcher [[Randy Wolf]] hit a line drive that was caught by Diamondbacks pitcher [[Dan Haren]]. Both Pierre and Ethier broke on contact without tagging up from their respective bases, and Haren, noticing this, threw the ball to Diamondbacks second baseman [[Felipe L\u00f3pez (baseball)|Felipe Lopez]], who tagged out Pierre, but not until after Ethier crossed home plate. Upon tagging out Pierre, the Diamondbacks left the field, thinking that the inning was over and the run did not count. \n\nHad Lopez simply stepped on second base \u2013 prior to Ethier crossing the plate \u2013 no run would have been scored. Because first base was open, instead of a [[force play]], the play became a \"time play\", requiring the [[Umpire (baseball)|home plate umpire]] (for this game, [[Larry Vanover]]) to judge the position of Ethier at the time that Pierre was put out.

With the advent of video replay appeals, a new rationale for making extra out(s) has emerged - insurance against a prior out being undone on appeal.   These fourth out situations are not the same as [[Strikeout#More than three strikeouts in an inning|four strikeouts in an inning]].\n\n==When runs score==\nThe motivation for making a fourth out is to nullify a scored run, by either putting out the runner who had scored (on appeal, if the player failed to tag up after a catch) or putting out an additional runner who is forced to advance.\n\nNo run may score on an inning-ending play in which the third out is a [[force play|force out]] or on the [[batter-runner|batter]] before he reaches first base.  Put in other words, force outs count before runs are scored.  It is common that a runner reaches [[home plate]] a moment before the third out is made by force out.  Such a case is routine; the runner doesn't score but is counted as left on base.\n\nIt is also common that the third out might come on a non-force [[tag out]] after another runner reaches home plate.  By extension of these two rules, the \"fourth out\" covers the case where the third out is not a force out, but a subsequent out is.  Since the force out counts before the run scores, it must also count before the third out.\n\n==Examples==\nApparently there are no known MLB examples of a fourth out changing places with a prior out and thereby cancelling a run.  The situations where a fourth out may be recognized are exceedingly rare, but some hypothetical examples, and four real examples where the fourth out rule did come into play, are noted below:\n===Hypothetical examples===\n====An appeal force out====\nSuppose [[Bases loaded|three runners are on base]] with two outs, and the [[Batter (baseball)|batter]] hits the ball within the field of play for an apparent [[hit (baseball)|hit]]. Two important facts are required:\n\n# The ball has '''not''' become dead (i.e., a home run, ground-rule double, umpire interference, or fan interference).\n# The ball is not caught before hitting the ground.\n\nAll three runners cross home plate safely, but the runner who was at first misses second base while rounding the bases. After the runner from first has come around to score, the batter is then thrown out trying to stretch a bases-clearing double into a triple. The apparent play is that three runners have scored on an apparent double, with the batter out advancing.\n\n'''RULING''': The fielders have a viable [[appeal play]] at second base. If the defensive team is alert enough and understand the rules regarding fourth outs, the defensive team may make a live ball appeal that the runner who was initially at first base missed second base. If such an appeal is made, the runner from first base is out on a [[force play|force out]], because he failed to touch his [[force base]] (second base). As a result:\n*The force out, according to the rules of baseball, means that the batter is credited with a fielder's choice and not a base hit.\n*Since no run may score on a play on which the final out of a half-inning is a force out, the inning is over and no run counts. All three apparent runs come off the board.\n*The scoring is as follows: Batter grounds into fielder's choice, runner at first out at second (for failing to touch second), three runners left on base.\n\nThis rule merely places the occurrence of the force out before any tag play when it ends the inning.\n\n====Example: A non-appeal out====\nSuppose there are runners on second and third base with two outs, and the batter hits a ground ball to third base.  The runner from third scores, but the runner from second base is tagged out for the third out.  Since the runner from third reached home plate before the third out was recorded, and the third out was not a force out or on the [[batter-runner]] before reaching first base, it would seem that a run scored (and should count) before the third out was recorded.  However, suppose that the batter-runner fell down on his way to first base and was injured, unable to walk (or that, having seen the runner tagged out, turned around and headed for the dugout before reaching first base).  Then suppose that the fielders throw to first base, or tag the batter out.  Since no run can score if the last out is made on the batter before he reaches first base, this fourth out prevents a run from scoring.   Thus the runner from third is marked as [[left on base]] and his apparent run does not count; the runner from second is also left on base and his out is nullified; the batter-runner is out, which now becomes the actual third out.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n====A quick fourth out====\nThere are runners at first and third with two outs.  The runners are [[stolen base|attempting to steal]] on the pitch.  The batter grounds to the shortstop.  The runner from third base reaches home; then, the shortstop tags the runner who has rounded second (third out).  The shortstop then throws to first base, which beats the [[batter-runner]] for the fourth out.  The fourth out is [[Force play|on the batter before he reaches first base]], so it replaces the apparent third out and nullifies the run.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n===Real examples===\n====A missed fourth out allows a run to score (1989)====\nOn July 1, 1989, in the bottom of the eighth inning in a game between the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|old Yankee Stadium]], the Yankees scored a run because the Brewers failed to record a fourth out.\n\nWith one out, [[Mike Pagliarulo]] on third base, and [[Bob Geren]] on first base, Yankees shortstop [[Wayne Tolleson]] attempted a suicide squeeze that was caught by Brewers pitcher [[Jay Aldrich]]. Both Pagliarulo and Geren broke on contact without tagging up from their respective bases, and Aldrich, noticing this, threw to first baseman [[Greg Brock (baseball)|Greg Brock]] to double off Geren from first base, but not until after Pagliarulo crossed home plate. Upon doubling off Geren, the Brewers left the field, thinking the inning was over and the run did not count. \n\nHad Aldrich thrown more quickly to first base to double off Geren - prior to Pagliarulo crossing the plate - no run would have scored. The catching of the line drive before it had touched the ground eliminated the [[force play]], turning the play into a \"time play\", requiring the [[Umpire (baseball)|home plate umpire]] (for this game, [[Larry Barnett]]) to judge the position of Pagliarulo at the time Aldrich had doubled off Geren. Alternatively, had Aldrich let the ball drop (without [[Infield fly rule#Intentional drop rule|catching the ball and letting it fall out of his glove to the ground]]) and then thrown to second baseman [[Jim Gantner]] or shortstop [[Gary Sheffield]] to begin a 1-4-3 or 1-6-3 double play (Aldrich-Gantner or Sheffield-Brock), the run would not have counted since a run cannot score when the final out of a half-inning is a [[Force play|force out]] or a ground out (presuming Geren was forced at second and Tolleson was out at first). After all of the Brewers players had left fair territory (and therefore losing the chance to launch an [[appeal play]] to appeal Pagliarulo's failure to tag from third base), Barnett awarded the run to the Yankees as per Rule 7.10(a) (now Rule 5.09(c))<ref name=Rule710>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2016/official_baseball_rules.pdf|title=MLB Official Rules (revised 2016)|accessdate=24 October 2016}}</ref>. \n\nIf the Brewers had launched an [[appeal play]] at third base before leaving the field to garner a fourth out, Pagliarulo's failure to tag from third base would have become the actual third out of the inning and the run would not have scored, and this out would have taken precedence because it would have erased the run. As Barnett explained after the game: ''\u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018fourth-out\u2019 situation. Milwaukee had to throw the ball to third base for what would be the fourth out. Then they can choose to make that one the final out and prevent the run from scoring.

Both Pierre and Ethier broke on contact without tagging up from their respective bases, and Haren, noticing this, threw the ball to Diamondbacks second baseman [[Felipe L\u00f3pez (baseball)|Felipe Lopez]], who tagged out Pierre, but not until after Ethier crossed home plate. Upon tagging out Pierre, the Diamondbacks left the field, thinking that the inning was over and the run did not count. \n\nHad Lopez simply stepped on second base \u2013 prior to Ethier crossing the plate \u2013 no run would have been scored. Because first base was open, instead of a [[force play]], the play became a \"time play\", requiring the [[Umpire (baseball)|home plate umpire]] (for this game, [[Larry Vanover]]) to judge the position of Ethier at the time that Pierre was put out. After all of the Diamondbacks players had left fair territory (and therefore losing the chance to launch an [[appeal play]] to appeal Ethier's failure to tag from third base), Dodgers bench coach [[Bob Schaefer]] informed manager [[Joe Torre]] of what was then Rule 7.10 (now Rule 5.09(c))<ref name=Rule710/> regarding fourth outs, and Torre went to Vanover to alert him of the rule and situation.

His analysis groups the J\u014dmon people into a unique genetic cluster far away from any modern ethnic groups. Hideaki says that some J\u014dmon DNA is found in modern ethnic groups, such as Japanese people, [[Udege people]], [[Nivkh people]], [[Ainu people]] and [[Ryukyuan people]]. From all ethnic groups, the Ainu and Ryukyuans show the closest relation to ancient J\u014dmon people. Compared with populations worldwide, the Jomon are relatively close to modern Ryukyuans, Ainu and Yamato Japanese.<ref>Ancient genomic DNA analysis of Jomon people; Kanzawa-Kiriyama Hideaki.

The study results suggest that the J\u014dmon are their own distinct population and not closely related to other populations. The Funadomari J\u014dmon are not related to Australo-Melanesians (including Andamanese) or Africans. The J\u014dmon are closer to Eurasian populations and form a cluster near the \u201cBasal East Asians\u201d.\n\nModern Japanese share about 9% to 13% of their genome with the J\u014dmon. J\u014dmon specific genome is also found in minor percentage in populations of Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia, suggesting gene-flow from J\u014dmon related groups. Additionally, the J\u014dmon share specific gene alleles with populations in the Arctic regions of Eurasia and northern America.\n\nTests using phylogenetic relationship suggests that the Funadomari J\u014dmon have about 86% East Asian related ancestry and about 14% West Asian/European related ancestry. According to the scientists, more data is needed to explain these results.\n\n=== Yayoi people ===\nThe [[Yayoi people]] were migrants to the [[Japanese archipelago]] from [[Asia]] ([[China]] or [[Korea]]) during the [[Yayoi period]] (1000 BCE&ndash;300 CE) and [[Kofun period]] (250\u2013538 CE). They are seen as direct ancestors of the modern [[Yamato people]], the majority of Japanese and of the [[Ryukyuan people]].

His analysis groups the J\u014dmon people into a unique genetic cluster far away from any modern ethnic groups. Hideaki says that some J\u014dmon DNA is found in modern ethnic groups, such as Japanese people, [[Udege people]], [[Nivkh people]], [[Ainu people]] and [[Ryukyuan people]]. From all ethnic groups, the Ainu and Ryukyuans show the closest relation to ancient J\u014dmon people.

The study results suggest that the J\u014dmon are their own distinct population and not closely related to other populations. The Funadomari J\u014dmon are not related to Australo-Melanesians (including Andamanese) or Africans. The J\u014dmon are closer to Eurasian populations and form a cluster near the \u201cBasal East Asians\u201d.\n\nModern Japanese share about 9% to 13% of their genome with the J\u014dmon. J\u014dmon specific genome is also found in minor percentage in populations of Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia, suggesting gene-flow from J\u014dmon related groups. Additionally, the J\u014dmon share specific gene alleles with populations in the Arctic regions of Eurasia and northern America.\n\nTests using phylogenetic relationship suggests that the Funadomari J\u014dmon have about 86% East Asian related ancestry and about 14% West Asian/European related ancestry. According to the scientists, more data is needed to explain these results.\n\n=== Yayoi people ===\nThe [[Yayoi people]] were migrants to the [[Japanese archipelago]] from [[Asia]] ([[China]] or [[Korea]]) during the [[Yayoi period]] (1000 BCE&ndash;300 CE) and [[Kofun period]] (250\u2013538 CE).

However, the two had been teaching Western travelers since at least 1965, when they met [[Zina Rachevsky]], their student and patron, in [[Darjeeling]]. In 1969, the three of them founded the Nepal Mahayana Gompa Centre (now Kopan Monastery). Rachevsky died shortly afterwards during a Buddhist retreat.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nLama Yeshe resisted Rachevsky's appeals to teach a \"meditation course,\" on the grounds that in the [[Sera Monastery]] tradition in which he was educated, \"meditation\" would be attempted only after intensive, multi-year study of the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon#Five traditional topics of study|Five Topics]]. However, he gave Lama Zopa permission to lead what became the first of Kopan's meditation courses (then semiannual, now annual) in 1971.<ref>Wangmo p. 241</ref> Lama Zopa led these courses at least through 1975 (and occasionally thereafter).{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nDuring the early 1970s, hundreds of Westerners attended teachings at Kopan. Historical descriptions and recollections routinely characterize early Western participants as backpackers on the [[hippie trail]] (extended overland tours of Asia)\u2014to whom Lama Yeshe's style of discourse especially appealed.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nGeoffrey Samuel finds it significant that Lamas Yeshe and Zopa had not yet attracted followings among the Tibetan or Himalayan peoples (Zopa's status as a minor [[tulku]] notwithstanding), and that their activities took place independently of any support or direction from the [[Central Tibetan Administration]] in [[Dharamsala]]. On his reading, their willingness to reach out to Westerners was in large measure the result of a lack of other sources of support. Nevertheless, Samuel sees their cultivation of an international network as having ample precedent in Tibet.<ref>Samuel, p. 301 ff.</ref>\n\nIn December 1973, Lama Yeshe ordained fourteen Western monks and nuns under the name of the International Mahayana Institute. Around this time, Lama Yeshe's students began returning to their own countries. The result was the founding of an ever-increasing number of dharma centers in those countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn his description of the FPMT, Jeffrey Paine emphasizes the charisma, intuition, drive, and organizational ability of Lama Yeshe. Paine asks us to consider how a refugee with neither financial resources nor language skills could manage to create an international network with more than a hundred centers and study groups.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nDavid N. Kay (see bibliography) makes the following observation:\n\n:\"Lama Yeshe's project of defining and implementing an efficient organizational and administrative structure within the FPMT created the potential for friction at a local level. The organization's affiliated centers had initially been largely autonomous and self-regulating, but towards the late-1970s were increasingly subject to central management and control.\"<ref>Kay, pp. 61-62.</ref>\n\nAs a result, says Kay (and Samuel's analysis concurs), at the same time that the FPMT was consolidating its structure and practices, several local groups and teachers defected, founding independent networks. Geshe Loden of Australia's Chenrezig Institute left the FPMT in 1979, in order to focus on his own network of centers. More consequentially, [[Kelsang Gyatso]] and his students caused the [[Manjushri Institute]], the FPMT's flagship center in England, to sever its FPMT ties. At issue was whether the centers and their students ought to identify primarily with Lama Yeshe, local teachers, the Gelugpa tradition, or Tibetan Buddhism as a whole. The FPMT now asks its lamas to sign a \"Geshe Agreement\" which make explicit the organization's expectations.<ref>Kay, p. 65</ref> The latter rift widened in the wake of unrelated, post-1996 controversy over [[Dorje Shugden]]; the FPMT accepts the 14th Dalai Lama's ban on the worship of this deity, which only applies to those who wish to be his own disciples.<ref>[http://www.chandrakirti.co.nz/assets/Shugdenpolicyguideline.pdf The Shugden Issue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524112855/http://www.chandrakirti.co.nz/assets/Shugdenpolicyguideline.pdf |date=2012-05-24 }} - policy statement by the FPMT, accessed 26 July 2012.</ref>\n\nLama Yeshe's death in 1984 led to his succession as spiritual director by Lama Zopa. In 1986, a Spanish boy named [[Tenzin \u00d6sel Hita]] (a.k.a. Tenzin \u00d6sel Rinpoche, or \"Lama \u00d6sel\") was identified as the tulku of Lama Yeshe. As he came of age, Hita gave up his robes for a secular life, attending university in Spain, and became relatively inactive in the FPMT. In 2009, was quoted in several media sources as renouncing his role as a tulku\u2014remarks which he later disavowed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Van Biema |first=David |title=When a 'Chosen' Tibetan Lama Says No Thanks | work=TIME Magazine | date=8 June 2009 | url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1903076,00.html | access-date=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n{{Tibetan Buddhism}}\nThe FPMT is headed by a board of directors, with its spiritual director (presently Lama Zopa) a member.

Roger Kunsang.<ref>FPMT Board of Directors https://fpmt.org/fpmt/international-office/board-of-directors/</ref>\n\nThere are over 160 FPMT [[dharma centre]]s, projects, services and study groups in 40 countries. Each affiliated center, project or service is separately incorporated and locally financed. There is no such thing as FPMT \"membership\" for individuals; rather, membership is held only by organizations (although several of these offer their own, local membership to individuals).

The FPMT has grown to encompass over 160 Dharma centers, projects, and services in 37 countries. Since the death of Lama Yeshe in 1984, the FPMT's spiritual director has been Lama Zopa Rinpoche.\n\n==Location==\nThe FPMT's international headquarters are in [[Portland, Oregon]] (USA).

However, the two had been teaching Western travelers since at least 1965, when they met [[Zina Rachevsky]], their student and patron, in [[Darjeeling]]. In 1969, the three of them founded the Nepal Mahayana Gompa Centre (now Kopan Monastery). Rachevsky died shortly afterwards during a Buddhist retreat.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nLama Yeshe resisted Rachevsky's appeals to teach a \"meditation course,\" on the grounds that in the [[Sera Monastery]] tradition in which he was educated, \"meditation\" would be attempted only after intensive, multi-year study of the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon#Five traditional topics of study|Five Topics]]. However, he gave Lama Zopa permission to lead what became the first of Kopan's meditation courses (then semiannual, now annual) in 1971.<ref>Wangmo p. 241</ref> Lama Zopa led these courses at least through 1975 (and occasionally thereafter).{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nDuring the early 1970s, hundreds of Westerners attended teachings at Kopan. Historical descriptions and recollections routinely characterize early Western participants as backpackers on the [[hippie trail]] (extended overland tours of Asia)\u2014to whom Lama Yeshe's style of discourse especially appealed.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nGeoffrey Samuel finds it significant that Lamas Yeshe and Zopa had not yet attracted followings among the Tibetan or Himalayan peoples (Zopa's status as a minor [[tulku]] notwithstanding), and that their activities took place independently of any support or direction from the [[Central Tibetan Administration]] in [[Dharamsala]]. On his reading, their willingness to reach out to Westerners was in large measure the result of a lack of other sources of support. Nevertheless, Samuel sees their cultivation of an international network as having ample precedent in Tibet.<ref>Samuel, p. 301 ff.</ref>\n\nIn December 1973, Lama Yeshe ordained fourteen Western monks and nuns under the name of the International Mahayana Institute. Around this time, Lama Yeshe's students began returning to their own countries. The result was the founding of an ever-increasing number of dharma centers in those countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn his description of the FPMT, Jeffrey Paine emphasizes the charisma, intuition, drive, and organizational ability of Lama Yeshe. Paine asks us to consider how a refugee with neither financial resources nor language skills could manage to create an international network with more than a hundred centers and study groups.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nDavid N. Kay (see bibliography) makes the following observation:\n\n:\"Lama Yeshe's project of defining and implementing an efficient organizational and administrative structure within the FPMT created the potential for friction at a local level. The organization's affiliated centers had initially been largely autonomous and self-regulating, but towards the late-1970s were increasingly subject to central management and control.\"<ref>Kay, pp. 61-62.</ref>\n\nAs a result, says Kay (and Samuel's analysis concurs), at the same time that the FPMT was consolidating its structure and practices, several local groups and teachers defected, founding independent networks. Geshe Loden of Australia's Chenrezig Institute left the FPMT in 1979, in order to focus on his own network of centers. More consequentially, [[Kelsang Gyatso]] and his students caused the [[Manjushri Institute]], the FPMT's flagship center in England, to sever its FPMT ties. At issue was whether the centers and their students ought to identify primarily with Lama Yeshe, local teachers, the Gelugpa tradition, or Tibetan Buddhism as a whole. The FPMT now asks its lamas to sign a \"Geshe Agreement\" which make explicit the organization's expectations.<ref>Kay, p. 65</ref> The latter rift widened in the wake of unrelated, post-1996 controversy over [[Dorje Shugden]]; the FPMT accepts the 14th Dalai Lama's ban on the worship of this deity, which only applies to those who wish to be his own disciples.<ref>[http://www.chandrakirti.co.nz/assets/Shugdenpolicyguideline.pdf The Shugden Issue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524112855/http://www.chandrakirti.co.nz/assets/Shugdenpolicyguideline.pdf |date=2012-05-24 }} - policy statement by the FPMT, accessed 26 July 2012.</ref>\n\nLama Yeshe's death in 1984 led to his succession as spiritual director by Lama Zopa. In 1986, a Spanish boy named [[Tenzin \u00d6sel Hita]] (a.k.a. Tenzin \u00d6sel Rinpoche, or \"Lama \u00d6sel\") was identified as the tulku of Lama Yeshe. As he came of age, Hita gave up his robes for a secular life, attending university in Spain, and became relatively inactive in the FPMT. In 2009, was quoted in several media sources as renouncing his role as a tulku\u2014remarks which he later disavowed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Van Biema |first=David |title=When a 'Chosen' Tibetan Lama Says No Thanks | work=TIME Magazine | date=8 June 2009 | url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1903076,00.html | access-date=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n{{Tibetan Buddhism}}\nThe FPMT is headed by a board of directors, with its spiritual director (presently Lama Zopa) a member.

Each affiliated center, project or service is separately incorporated and locally financed. There is no such thing as FPMT \"membership\" for individuals; rather, membership is held only by organizations (although several of these offer their own, local membership to individuals).

{"title_page": "Fork (system call)", "text_new": "In [[computing]], particularly in the context of the [[Unix]] operating system and its [[Unix-like|workalikes]], '''fork''' is an operation whereby a [[Computer process|process]] creates a copy of itself. It is an interface which is required for compliance with the [[POSIX]] and [[Single UNIX Specification]] standards. It is usually implemented as a [[C standard library|C Standard Library]] (libC) [[Wrapper library|wrapper]] to the fork, clone, or other [[system call|system calls]] of the [[kernel (computing)|kernel]]. Fork is the primary method of process creation on Unix-like operating systems.\n\n== Overview ==\nIn multitasking operating systems, processes (running programs) need a way to create new processes, e.g. to run other programs. Fork and its variants are typically the only way of doing so in Unix-like systems. For a process to start the execution of a different program, it first forks to create a copy of itself. Then, the copy, called the \"[[child process]]\", calls the [[exec (computing)|exec]] system call to overlay itself with the other program: it ceases execution of its former program in favor of the other.\n\nThe fork operation creates a separate [[address space]] for the child. The child process has an exact copy of all the memory segments of the parent process. In modern UNIX variants that follow the [[virtual memory]] model from SunOS-4.0, [[copy-on-write]] semantics are implemented and the physical memory need not be actually copied. Instead, [[virtual memory pages]] in both processes may refer to the same pages of [[physical memory]] until one of them writes to such a page: then it is copied. This optimization is important in the common case where fork is used in conjunction with exec to execute a new program: typically, the child process performs only a small set of actions before it ceases execution of its program in favour of the program to be started, and it requires very few, if any, of its parent's [[data structure]]s.\n\nWhen a process calls fork, it is deemed the [[parent process]] and the newly created process is its child. After the fork, both processes not only run the same program, but they resume execution as though both had called the system call. They can then inspect the call's [[return value]] to determine their status, child or parent, and act accordingly.\n\n== History ==\nOne of the earliest references to a fork concept appeared in ''A Multiprocessor System Design'' by [[Melvin Conway]], published in 1962.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Notes on the History of Fork and Join|last=Nyman|first=Linus|date=25 August 2016|journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|volume=38|issue=3|pages=84\u201387|doi=10.1109/MAHC.2016.34}}</ref> Conway's paper motivated the implementation by [[L.

(Note this applies to the CMS guest operating system only; other VM guest operating systems, such as Linux, provide standard fork functionality.)\n\n==Application usage==\n\nThe following variant of the [[Hello World]] program demonstrates the mechanics of the {{mono|fork}} system call in the [[C (programming language)|C]] programming language. The program forks into two processes, each deciding what functionality they perform based on the return value of the fork system call. [[Boilerplate code]] such as [[Header file|header inclusions]] has been omitted.\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint main(void)\n{\n    pid_t pid = fork();\n\n    if (pid == -1) {\n        perror(\"fork failed\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n    else if (pid == 0) {\n        printf(\"Hello from the child process!\\n\");\n        _exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);\n    }\n    else {\n        int status;\n        (void)waitpid(pid, &status, 0);\n    }\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n</source>\n\nWhat follows is a dissection of this program.\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\n   pid_t pid = fork();\n</source>\n\nThe first statement in {{mono|main}} calls the {{mono|fork}} system call to split execution into two processes. The return value of {{mono|fork}} is recorded in a variable of type {{mono|pid_t}}, which is the POSIX type for process identifiers (PIDs).\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\n    if (pid == -1) {\n        perror(\"fork failed\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n</source>\n\nMinus one indicates an error in {{mono|fork}}: no new process was created, so an error message is printed.\n\nIf {{mono|fork}} was successful, then there are now two processes, both executing the {{mono|main}} function from the point where {{mono|fork}} has returned. To make the processes perform different tasks, the program must [[Branch (computer science)|branch]] on the return value of {{mono|fork}} to determine whether it is executing as the ''child'' process or the ''parent'' process.\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\n   else if (pid == 0) {\n      printf(\"Hello from the child process!\\n\");\n      _exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);\n   }\n</source>\n\nIn the child process, the return value appears as zero (which is an invalid process identifier). The child process prints the desired greeting message, then exits. (For technical reasons, the POSIX {{mono|_exit}} function must be used here instead of the C standard {{mono|exit}} function.)\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\n   else {\n      int status;\n      (void)waitpid(pid, &status, 0);\n   }\n</source>\n\nThe other process, the parent, receives from {{mono|fork}} the process identifier of the child, which is always a positive number. The parent process passes this identifier to the {{mono|waitpid}} system call to suspend execution until the child has exited. When this has happened, the parent resumes execution and exits by means of the {{mono|return}} statement.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fork bomb]]\n*[[Fork\u2013exec]]\n*[[exit (system call)]]\n*[[wait (system call)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Process (computing)]]\n[[Category:C POSIX library]]\n[[Category:Articles with example C code]]\n[[Category:System calls]]\n", "text_old": "In [[computing]], particularly in the context of the [[Unix]] operating system and its [[Unix-like|workalikes]], '''fork''' is an operation whereby a [[Computer process|process]] creates a copy of itself.

The [[spawn (computing)|spawn]] metaphor was later adopted in Microsoft operating systems (1993).\n\nThe POSIX-compatibility component of [[VM/CMS]] (OpenExtensions) provides a very limited implementation of fork, in which the parent is suspended while the child executes, and the child and the parent share the same address space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSB27U_6.2.0/com.ibm.zvm.v620.dmsp0/hcsp0c0022.htm%23wq47?lang=en|title=z/VM > z/VM 6.2.0 > Application Programming > z/VM V6R2 OpenExtensions POSIX Conformance Document > POSIX.1 Conformance Document > Section 3.

(Note this applies to the CMS guest operating system only; other VM guest operating systems, such as Linux, provide standard fork functionality.)\n\n==Application usage==\n\nThe following variant of the [[Hello World]] program demonstrates the mechanics of the {{mono|fork}} system call in the [[C (programming language)|C]] programming language. The program forks into two processes, each deciding what functionality they perform based on the return value of the fork system call. [[Boilerplate code]] such as [[Header file|header inclusions]] has been omitted.\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint main(void)\n{\n    pid_t pid = fork();\n\n    if (pid == -1) {\n        perror(\"fork failed\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n    else if (pid == 0) {\n        printf(\"Hello from the child process!\\n\");\n        _exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);\n    }\n    else {\n        int status;\n        (void)waitpid(pid, &status, 0);\n    }\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n</source>\n\nWhat follows is a dissection of this program.\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\n   pid_t pid = fork();\n</source>\n\nThe first statement in {{mono|main}} calls the {{mono|fork}} system call to split execution into two processes. The return value of {{mono|fork}} is recorded in a variable of type {{mono|pid_t}}, which is the POSIX type for process identifiers (PIDs).\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\n    if (pid == -1) {\n        perror(\"fork failed\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n</source>\n\nMinus one indicates an error in {{mono|fork}}: no new process was created, so an error message is printed.\n\nIf {{mono|fork}} was successful, then there are now two processes, both executing the {{mono|main}} function from the point where {{mono|fork}} has returned. To make the processes perform different tasks, the program must [[Branch (computer science)|branch]] on the return value of {{mono|fork}} to determine whether it is executing as the ''child'' process or the ''parent'' process.\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\n   else if (pid == 0) {\n      printf(\"Hello from the child process!\\n\");\n      _exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);\n   }\n</source>\n\nIn the child process, the return value appears as zero (which is an invalid process identifier). The child process prints the desired greeting message, then exits. (For technical reasons, the POSIX {{mono|_exit}} function must be used here instead of the C standard {{mono|exit}} function.)\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\n   else {\n      int status;\n      (void)waitpid(pid, &status, 0);\n   }\n</source>\n\nThe other process, the parent, receives from {{mono|fork}} the process identifier of the child, which is always a positive number. The parent process passes this identifier to the {{mono|waitpid}} system call to suspend execution until the child has exited. When this has happened, the parent resumes execution and exits by means of the {{mono|return}} statement.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fork bomb]]\n*[[Fork\u2013exec]]\n*[[exit (system call)]]\n*[[wait (system call)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Process (computing)]]\n[[Category:C POSIX library]]\n[[Category:Articles with example C code]]\n[[Category:System calls]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(system_call)"}

{"title_page": "Foreign relations of the Maldives", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=August 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2011}}\n{{Politics of the Maldives}}\n\nThe [[Maldives]] has remained an independent nation throughout its [[recorded history]], save for a brief spell of Portuguese occupation in the mid-16th century.  From 1887 to 1965, the country was a British [[protectorate]] while retaining full internal sovereignty. At its independence in 1965, the Maldives joined the [[United Nations]] on 20 September.\n\nSince 1978, the Maldives has followed a policy of international engagement, intensifying links with strategic partners and the international system. It joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in 1982. A founder member of [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC), the Maldives is also a member of the [[Bretton Woods system]]. It is also party to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) as well as numerous conventions on the protection of the environment, the suppression of terrorism, disarmament and on the promotion and protection of human rights.\n\nIn the transition towards a [[liberal democracy]], the Maldives has successfully established dialogue and collaboration with the international human rights organizations, such as [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], and acceded to numerous human rights instruments such as the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR). During the same period, the country has also intensified links with the [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Association]] (CPA) and joined the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] (IPU).\n\nThe Maldives maintain resident [[diplomatic mission]]s in [[Colombo]], [[New Delhi]], [[Islamabad]], [[Dhaka]], [[Singapore]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Tokyo]], [[Beijing]], [[Riyadh]], [[London]], [[Geneva]], and the [[European Union]], and non-resident accreditation in a number of countries including [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]].\n\nKey issues of interest include advancing national development, supporting international peace and security, including the protection of the environment and the promotion of human rights, and upholding the purposes and principles enshrined in the [[Charter of the United Nations]].\n\n[[File:Secretary Clinton Speaks With Maldivian Foreign Minister Naseem (5934554131).jpg|thumb|Hillary Clinton receives foreign minister Naseem]]\n\n==Human Rights==\n\nThe Maldives has become a very strong advocate for the promotion and protection of human rights following the democratic transition in 2008. At the United Nations, the Maldives has since then called for all countries to adhere to their obligations under international law, and to respect fundamental freedoms and rights. In 2005, the Maldives became one of the promoters of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention Against Torture after having earlier acceded to the Convention. The Maldives is party to the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC), the [[Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD), [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (CRPD) the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) and its optional protocol. In April 2006, the Maldives issued a standing invitation to all special procedures mandates of the UN human rights machinery to visit to the Maldives.\n\nThe Maldives was elected to the [[Human Rights Council]] in 2010 for the term 2010-2013, in which it has actively supported and contributed to the promotion and protection of human rights for all. It has co-sponsored a number of resolution establishing United Nations Special Mandates, and supported resolutions on improving human rights situation in the Middle East during the [[Arab Spring]], namely on investigating human rights violations in [[Libya]] and [[Syria]].\n\nMaldives has especially close relations with Sri Lanka and India, countries with which it shares much culture.\n\n==International organizations==\n\n===United Nations===\n\nMaldives became a [[Member states of the United Nations|member state of the United Nations]] on 21 September 1965. The nation became a member of [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) on the same date.\n\nThe Maldives became a member of the following UN agencies and conferences on the following dates:\n* [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) and [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) - 21 September 1965.\n* [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO) -  5 May 1988\n* [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) - 18 July 1980\n* [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) - on 15 December 1972\n* [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF) - 6 April 1971\n\nThe United Nations Development Programme has a representative resident in Mal\u00e9, as do UNICEF and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).\n\nAt the UN, the Maldives has highlighted the vulnerability of small states to various threats including terrorism, activities of mercenaries and [[transnational organized crime]]. It is also a strong advocate of counter-terrorism and is party to all the main UN conventions against terrorism. Development co-operation is a major priority of the Maldives and it has been campaigning at the UN for a more structured means of graduation from the list of [[least developed countries]] targeted for preferential assistance. The main donors to the Maldives are [[Japan]], [[India]], and [[Australia]].\n\n===Other intergovernmental organizations===\n\nThe Maldives became a member of [[Non-Aligned Movement]] on 15 August 1976.\n\nThe Maldives were a founder member in 1985 of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) and the nation plays a very active role in the association. It has taken the lead in calling for a South Asian Free Trade Agreement, the formulation of a Social Charter, the initiation of informal political consultations in SAARC forums, the lobbying for greater action on environmental issues, the proposal of numerous human rights measures such as the regional convention on child rights and for setting up a SAARC Human Rights Resource Centre. The Maldives is also an advocate of greater international profile for SAARC such as through formulating common positions at the UN. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120306180219/http://www.foreign.gov.mv/v3/?p=mem_in_int]\n\nThe Maldives is a member of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) and maintains close cultural relations with Islamic countries. However, the Maldives has often distanced itself from positions taken by the OIC on matters such as the [[Kashmir dispute]], which it regards as a bilateral issue to be settled peacefully between India and Pakistan. It has also not supported the OIC position on issues such as that of Cyprus, subscribing instead to the international stance taken by the United Nations. The Maldives became a member of OIC in August 1974.

From 1887 to 1965, the country was a British [[protectorate]] while retaining full internal sovereignty. At its independence in 1965, the Maldives joined the [[United Nations]] on 20 September.\n\nSince 1978, the Maldives has followed a policy of international engagement, intensifying links with strategic partners and the international system.
