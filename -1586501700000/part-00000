He had a brother, William Hugh Croskery. Croskery arrived in New Zealand with his parents in 1880. He attended Queen's College in [[Auckland]], before working on a farm in [[Taranaki]] from 1894\u20131895. He then moved to [[Wellington]], and in 1896 began work as a draper's assistant at James Smith and Sons. He married Emily Clark on 17 December 1902; they were to have ten daughters and three sons. The family lived in [[Newtown, Wellington|Newtown]], where between 1902 and 1911 Croskery ran his own drapery and tailoring business in Riddiford Street, then about 1917 moved to [[Lyall Bay, New Zealand|Lyall Bay]].\n\nCroskery helped to found the Wellington Retail Soft-goods Employees' Union in February, 1912, and served as its secretary. He also served as Secretary of the Wellington Butchers' Union, Secretary of the NZ Shop Assistants' Federation, and the Wellington Plumbers' and Gasfitters' Union, from their foundation until his death in 1952. Croskery worked hard to increase the union's membership, particularly in provincial areas outside Wellington, and supported the incorporation of all shop employees into one union. A capable administrator and advocate, he was a model arbitrationist union secretary. He had a meticulous approach to clerical and financial matters and invested union funds shrewdly.\n\nFrom 1913, Croskery was closely involved with the Wellington Trades and Labour Council and its successor, the Wellington Trades Council, serving as an executive member from 1936 and as vice president from 1939 to 1945. He was also active in the political wing of the labour movement. He stood unsuccessfully for the [[Wellington City Council]] on several occasions, and contested the [[Wellington Suburbs (New Zealand electorate)|Wellington Suburbs electorate]] for the [[New Zealand Labour Party]] in the [[1919 New Zealand general election|1919]] and [[1922 New Zealand general election|1922]] general elections. He was a member of the Labour Party's national executive in 1937\u201338 and 1939\u201340, but he always put the interests of his union's members first.\n\nIn the 1930s, Croskery emerged as a significant figure in the national labour movement. In 1936 he became secretary of the New Zealand Alliance of Labour, and the following year he played an important role in unifying the various factions to form the [[New Zealand Federation of Labour]] (FOL). He served on the Wellington Hospital Board from 1935\u20131941, and as a workers' representative on the Court of Arbitration from 1937\u20131938. He later served on the Industrial Emergency Council and the Workers' Compensation Board. He became a member of the FOL's executive in 1942 and its vice president in 1943.\n\nIn 1946, Croskery was elected President of the Federation of Labour, succeeding Angus McLagan; he held office until his death in 1952. He served as FOL President during a time of difficulty for the labour movement, including the formation of the rival New Zealand Trade Union Congress in 1950, the bitter [[1951 Waterfront dispute|1951 waterfront dispute]], and political opposition from a resurgent [[National Party of New Zealand|National Party]]. However, colleagues recalled his calm, steadying influence; mediation rather than confrontation was his style. He worked well with FOL Vice-President [[Fintan Patrick Walsh]], and was an exemplary representative for the New Zealand labour movement overseas, serving as a delegate to the World Trade Union Conferences in [[London]] in 1945 and in [[Paris]] in 1949, as well as to the [[International Labour Organization]]'s conference in [[Geneva]] in 1949.\n\nA dapper, well-dressed man who was always smoking a pipe, Croskery suffered from chronic [[bronchitis]] and [[emphysema]] in later years. He died in Wellington on 18 August 1952; Emily had died a year earlier. They were survived by nine daughters and two sons.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*''Labour's Path to Political Independence: the Origins and Establishment of the NZLP 1900-19'' by [[Barry Gustafson]] (1980, Oxford University Press, Auckland)\n* {{DNZB|title=Alexander Wellington Croskery|first= Kevin|last= Hince|id=4c44|accessdate=23 April 2017}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Croskery, Alexander Wellington}}\n[[Category:1878 births]]\n[[Category:1952 deaths]]\n[[Category:Local political office-holders in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Wellington Hospital Board members]]\n[[Category:New Zealand trade unionists]]\n[[Category:New Zealand people of Welsh descent]]\n[[Category:New Zealand Labour Party politicians]]\n[[Category:New Zealand drapers]]\n[[Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1919 New Zealand general election]]\n[[Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1922 New Zealand general election]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2014}}\n{{Use New Zealand English|date=October 2014}}\n[[File:Alexander Croskery.jpg|thumb|Alexander Croskery in 1922]]\n'''Alexander Wellington 'Alec' Croskery''' (19 December 1878 &ndash; 18 August 1952) was a New Zealand draper,  political activist and trade unionist\n\n==Biography==\nCroskery was born in 1878<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=RsUzKh5NE5BrWX8%2F85NGTg&scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=9 February 2017|work=Index to Births, Deaths, and Marriages in England and Wales|publisher=General Register Office|volume=11a|page=660}}</ref> in Swansea, Glamorganshire, [[Wales]], to Alexander Brown Croskery, (1838-1897), an Irish accountant and provision merchant from [[Downpatrick]], [[County Down]], [[Ireland]], and Mary Ann Mortimer Thomson, (1850-1925), from [[Ballynahinch, County Down|Ballynahinch]], [[County Down]], [[Ireland]].

An agreement was reached between December 1979 and January 1980 with production scheduled for the Termini Imerese Autobianchi di Desio plants.<ref name=\"tribe1\"/>\n\nJust prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'' published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

It was launched in the right-hand drive UK market in May 1981.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 1 h sst.jpg|thumb|left|Rear of pre-facelift Fiat Panda]]\nMechanically the first Pandas shared engines and transmissions with the [[Fiat 127]] and, in certain territories, the air-cooled 652&nbsp;cc two-cylinder powerplant of the [[Fiat 126]]. Rear suspension used a [[solid axle]] suspended on [[leaf spring]]s. Later versions added mechanical improvements while retaining a robust simplicity throughout its model life.\n\nLaunch models included the '''Panda 30''', powered by a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally-mounted]] [[Air cooling|air cooled]] 652&nbsp;cc [[Straight-twin engine|straight-two-cylinder engine]] derived from the 126,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Quattroruote |title=Anteprima: La \"Mini\" si toglie il cilindro: Tutte le bicilindriche |trans-title=Preview: The Mini loses a cylinder: All of the bicylinders |language=it |date=September 1984 |volume=29 |issue=347 |publisher=Editoriale Domus |location=Milan, Italy |first=Alessandro |last=Ferrari |pages=70\u201371}}</ref> and the '''Panda 45''', with a [[Transverse engine|transversely-mounted]] [[Water cooling|water cooled]] 903&nbsp;cc ([[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100 series]]) [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] from the 127. As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989_FIAT_Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions &mdash; with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989_Fiat_Panda_4x4_SISLEY_(3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors &mdash;in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox &mdash; with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time. \n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line.

Fiat did not say which country it was headed to.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fiat builds 2,000,000 Panda in Polish plant|url=http://europeancarnews.com/2011/07/04/fiat-builds-2000000-panda-in-polish-plant/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019113456/http://europeancarnews.com/2011/07/04/fiat-builds-2000000-panda-in-polish-plant/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-10-19|publisher=European Car News}}</ref>\n\n===Panda Classic===\nThe Panda Classic<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quattroruote.it/notizie/auto-novita/fiat-panda-classic-prezzo-di-lancio-da-7900-euro |title=Fiat panda Classic |language=it |publisher=Quattroruote.it |accessdate=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723012958/http://www.quattroruote.it/notizie/auto-novita/fiat-panda-classic-prezzo-di-lancio-da-7900-euro |archivedate=23 July 2012  }}</ref> was a second series Fiat Panda renamed and with a reduced list price to distinguish it from the new generation introduced in late 2011. The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n*The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n*The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n*The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n*The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n*The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n*The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n\n*The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n*The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n*The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n*The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n\n*'''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

On the other hand this requires a 40&nbsp;mm taller ride height and a reworked, transversal [[Muffler|silencer]] - thus the Natural Power uses the lifted chassis of the Trekking / 4x4 versions.\n\nTotal bi-fuel capacity is 72 liters - or 12 kilograms - of CNG and 35 L of petrol - two liters less than the monofuel's 37.\nAt startup the engine runs on petrol, but switches to CNG immediately after; the car switches back to petrol automatically if it runs out of CNG or any time by driver's demand, via a dedicated button on the dashboard.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\nDue to the new tightening emissions regulations Euro 6d-Temp, after September 2018 the power output of the Natural Power ''[[Twinair engine|TwinAir]]'' engine is reduced from 80 to 70 PS, when running on CNG - although remains 85 PS, when running on petrol.\n\n====Panda EasyPower====\nThe EasyPower is the [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]/petrol bi-fuel version of the Panda; like the Natural Power it too is factory developed and manufactured.\nIts 1.2 ''FIRE'' inline four develops 69 PS.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\n====Panda Trekking====\nLaunched in late 2012, the Trekking is a two-wheel drive model offering the looks and features of the Panda 4x4. It is distinguished from the 4x4, by the absence of skid plate inserts on bumpers, no \"4x4\" inlay in the bodyside molding and alloy wheels painted silver instead of a darker grey.\n\nAvailable on this model are the 0.9 ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol and 1.3 ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel engines, with some offroad capabilities thanks to the \"Traction +\" ESC-based electronically simulated front [[locking differential]]<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" /> and the standard [[M+S|M+S tires]], along with the ''TwinAir Natural Power'' turbocharged petrol/methane engine without the latter capabilities.\n\nThe Panda Trekking stayed in production until late 2016.\n\n[[File:' 12 - ITALY - Fiat Panda 4x4 Off-road test drive - Motorshow di Bologna cut.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A Panda 4x4 in action]]\n\n====Panda 4x4====\nThe third generation all wheel drive Panda was introduced at the 2012 [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref name=\"Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2012/cars/fiat/08/panda_4x4/2908.html|title=Panda 4x4|accessdate=3 September 2012|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref> The engine lineup includes the ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol engine and ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel.

The ELD works automatically by braking the wheel(s) where the ESC sensors detect excessive wheel slip, thus making the differentials more torque to the wheels in better traction conditions; this functionality is useful on low-grip surfaces, and is activated by the driver via a console switch.<ref name=\"fiatpress 4x4\" />\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2015 Fiat Panda Cross TwinAir 900cc Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2015 Fiat Panda Cross TwinAir 900cc Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda Cross\n}}\n\n====Panda Cross====\nLaunched at the 2014 [[Geneva Motor Show]], it is the range topping, offroad-styled Panda.

It was launched in the right-hand drive UK market in May 1981.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 1 h sst.jpg|thumb|left|Rear of pre-facelift Fiat Panda]]\nMechanically the first Pandas shared engines and transmissions with the [[Fiat 127]] and, in certain territories, the air-cooled 652&nbsp;cc two-cylinder powerplant of the [[Fiat 126]]. Rear suspension used a [[solid axle]] suspended on [[leaf spring]]s. Later versions added mechanical improvements while retaining a robust simplicity throughout its model life.\n\nLaunch models included the '''Panda 30''', powered by a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally-mounted]] [[Air cooling|air cooled]] 652&nbsp;cc [[Straight-twin engine|straight-two-cylinder engine]] derived from the 126,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Quattroruote |title=Anteprima: La \"Mini\" si toglie il cilindro: Tutte le bicilindriche |trans-title=Preview: The Mini loses a cylinder: All of the bicylinders |language=it |date=September 1984 |volume=29 |issue=347 |publisher=Editoriale Domus |location=Milan, Italy |first=Alessandro |last=Ferrari |pages=70\u201371}}</ref> and the '''Panda 45''', with a [[Transverse engine|transversely-mounted]] [[Water cooling|water cooled]] 903&nbsp;cc ([[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100 series]]) [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] from the 127. As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989_FIAT_Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions &mdash; with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989_Fiat_Panda_4x4_SISLEY_(3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors &mdash;in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox &mdash; with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time. \n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line.

Fiat did not say which country it was headed to.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fiat builds 2,000,000 Panda in Polish plant|url=http://europeancarnews.com/2011/07/04/fiat-builds-2000000-panda-in-polish-plant/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019113456/http://europeancarnews.com/2011/07/04/fiat-builds-2000000-panda-in-polish-plant/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-10-19|publisher=European Car News}}</ref>\n\n===Panda Classic===\nThe Panda Classic<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quattroruote.it/notizie/auto-novita/fiat-panda-classic-prezzo-di-lancio-da-7900-euro |title=Fiat panda Classic |language=it |publisher=Quattroruote.it |accessdate=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723012958/http://www.quattroruote.it/notizie/auto-novita/fiat-panda-classic-prezzo-di-lancio-da-7900-euro |archivedate=23 July 2012  }}</ref> was a second series Fiat Panda renamed and with a reduced list price to distinguish it from the new generation introduced in late 2011. The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n*The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n*The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n*The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n*The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n*The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n*The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n\n*The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n*The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n*The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n*The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n\n*'''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

On the other hand this requires a 40&nbsp;mm taller ride height and a reworked, transversal [[Muffler|silencer]] - thus the Natural Power uses the lifted chassis of the Trekking / 4x4 versions.\n\nTotal bi-fuel capacity is 72 liters - or 12 kilograms - of CNG and 35 L of petrol - two liters less than the monofuel's 37.\nAt startup the engine runs on petrol, but switches to CNG immediately after; the car switches back to petrol automatically if it runs out of CNG or any time by driver's demand, via a dedicated button on the dashboard.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\nDue to the new tightening emissions regulations Euro 6d-Temp, after September 2018 the power output of the Natural Power ''[[Twinair engine|TwinAir]]'' engine is reduced from 80 to 70 PS, when running on CNG - although remains 85 PS, when running on petrol.\n\n====Panda EasyPower====\nThe EasyPower is the [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]/petrol bi-fuel version of the Panda; like the Natural Power it too is factory developed and manufactured.\nIts 1.2 ''FIRE'' inline four develops 69 PS.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\n====Panda Trekking====\nLaunched in late 2012, the Trekking is a two-wheel drive model offering the looks and features of the Panda 4x4. It is distinguished from the 4x4, by the absence of skid plate inserts on bumpers, no \"4x4\" inlay in the bodyside molding and alloy wheels painted silver instead of a darker grey.\n\nAvailable on this model are the 0.9 ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol and 1.3 ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel engines, with some offroad capabilities thanks to the \"Traction +\" ESC-based electronically simulated front [[locking differential]]<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" /> and the standard [[M+S|M+S tires]], along with the ''TwinAir Natural Power'' turbocharged petrol/methane engine without the latter capabilities.\n\nThe Panda Trekking stayed in production until late 2016.\n\n[[File:' 12 - ITALY - Fiat Panda 4x4 Off-road test drive - Motorshow di Bologna cut.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A Panda 4x4 in action]]\n\n====Panda 4x4====\nThe third generation all wheel drive Panda was introduced at the 2012 [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref name=\"Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2012/cars/fiat/08/panda_4x4/2908.html|title=Panda 4x4|accessdate=3 September 2012|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref> The engine lineup includes the ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol engine and ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel.

The ELD works automatically by braking the wheel(s) where the ESC sensors detect excessive wheel slip, thus making the differentials more torque to the wheels in better traction conditions; this functionality is useful on low-grip surfaces, and is activated by the driver via a console switch.<ref name=\"fiatpress 4x4\" />\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2015 Fiat Panda Cross TwinAir 900cc Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2015 Fiat Panda Cross TwinAir 900cc Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda Cross\n}}\n\n====Panda Cross====\nLaunched at the 2014 [[Geneva Motor Show]], it is the range topping, offroad-styled Panda.

The league, due to the immediate difficulties to find the sixteen best teams, was played with a huge tournament of twenty teams, then occupying 38 days, from September to July 1947.

Torino, after a last misstep with Sampdoria (the only team in the tournament to take away three points out of four from Torino) put together a sixteen match unbeaten run, of which fourteen were victories, beginning with the derby won by Guglielmo Gabetto<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enciclopediadelcalcio.it/Gabetto.html|title=Gabetto, Guglielmo|publisher=Enciclopedia del Calcio|language=Italian|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref>, to go to other successes such as the five goals against Inter and Atalanta, the six against Vicenza, Genoa and Milan.

It began operations as the state's second university on 25 July 1973, and accepted its first undergraduate students in 1975. Its name is taken from Sir [[Walter Murdoch]] (1874\u20131970), the Founding Professor of English and former Chancellor of the [[University of Western Australia]].\n\nMurdoch is a [[verdant universities|verdant university]] and a member of the [[Innovative Research Universities]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1962, the Government of Western Australia earmarked an area of land in Bull Creek to be the site of a future, second state university. Integral to the planning of the creation of Western Australia's second university was the planning for the School of Veterinary Science, which was to be the first professional faculty of the new university.<ref name=\"Murdoch History\">{{cite web |url = http://www.murdoch.edu.au/About-us/Our-profile/History-of-Murdoch/ |title=History of Murdoch |publisher=Murdoch University|access-date=13 April 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170331101047/http://www.murdoch.edu.au/About-us/Our-profile/History-of-Murdoch/ |archive-date=31 March 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt was decided that the new university would be named after Sir Walter Murdoch, a prominent local author, philosopher, and an Emeritus Professor at the University of Western Australia. When asked if he minded a new university in Western Australia being named in his honour, he was quoted as saying, \"No, but it had better be a good one.\"<ref name=\"Murdoch History\" />\n\nMurdoch University was formally constituted on 25 July 1973. It was opened with an inauguration ceremony on 17 September 1974. This date was chosen as it was Sir Walter Murdoch's 100th birthday. The Governor-General of Australia, Sir John Kerr, attended the ceremony as the guest of honour. Lectures began in 1975, with 510 students enrolled for undergraduate programs.<ref name=\"Murdoch History\" />\n\nAt the time, the young university was notable for its admissions policy of taking into consideration eligibility factors other than the school leaving exam results of students. Other universities later came to adopt this more holistic perspective of student eligibility for entrance into university education.<ref name=\"Murdoch History\" />\n\nSince 2015, Murdoch University has become more teaching focused.  In late 2018, the University faced scandal subsequent to an enrolment surge of international students, many \u201clacking English language and computing skills\u201d. In 2019, a ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' investigation by the ABC found further denigration of standards with foreign students recruited as 'cash cows'.<ref>https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-06/uni-academics-risk-jobs-to-speak-about-international-students/11082640</ref>\n\n== Campuses ==\nMurdoch University has three Australian campuses: South Street Campus, Rockingham Campus, and Mandurah Campus.\n\n=== South Street ===\nThe main campus is on South Street, Perth, in the suburb of Murdoch, near the [[Kwinana Freeway]] ({{coord|-32.066|115.835|type:edu_region:AU|name=Murdoch University, South Street campus|display=inline,title}}).

The library and first academic buildings flanking this court were designed by R J Ferguson, who also designed several buildings on the [[University of Western Australia]] campus. According to the foundation ethos of Murdoch University, there were to be no imposing buildings like the University of Western Australia\u2019s grand, Mediterranean-style Winthrop Hall, with its imposing clock tower. Rather, the architecture adopts a low-slung form redolent of a homestead, with covered walkways suggesting a hybrid veranda or cloister around the bush court. In the smaller courtyards exotic gardens, including a Chinese garden of rocks and stones, contrast with the bush court.<ref>[[Hannah Lewi]] and Andrew Saniga, 2014'  'Planning for Expansion and Dissent: the a Modern Australian Campus, in edited proceedings, Expansion and Conflict, 13th International Docomomo Conference, Seoul Korea, September 2014.</ref> The planting and landscaping were the work of Marion Blackwell.\n\nFeatures of the campus include the Joglo Rahayu (Peace Pavilion), a semi-enclosed pavilion near the Education and Humanities building.

It began operations as the state's second university on 25 July 1973, and accepted its first undergraduate students in 1975. Its name is taken from Sir [[Walter Murdoch]] (1874\u20131970), the Founding Professor of English and former Chancellor of the [[University of Western Australia]].\n\nMurdoch is a [[verdant universities|verdant university]] and a member of the [[Innovative Research Universities]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1962, the Government of Western Australia earmarked an area of land in Bull Creek to be the site of a future, second state university. Integral to the planning of the creation of Western Australia's second university was the planning for the School of Veterinary Science, which was to be the first professional faculty of the new university.<ref name=\"Murdoch History\">{{cite web |url = http://www.murdoch.edu.au/About-us/Our-profile/History-of-Murdoch/ |title=History of Murdoch |publisher=Murdoch University|access-date=13 April 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170331101047/http://www.murdoch.edu.au/About-us/Our-profile/History-of-Murdoch/ |archive-date=31 March 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt was decided that the new university would be named after Sir Walter Murdoch, a prominent local author, philosopher, and an Emeritus Professor at the University of Western Australia. When asked if he minded a new university in Western Australia being named in his honour, he was quoted as saying, \"No, but it had better be a good one.\"<ref name=\"Murdoch History\" />\n\nMurdoch University was formally constituted on 25 July 1973. It was opened with an inauguration ceremony on 17 September 1974. This date was chosen as it was Sir Walter Murdoch's 100th birthday. The Governor-General of Australia, Sir John Kerr, attended the ceremony as the guest of honour. Lectures began in 1975, with 510 students enrolled for undergraduate programs.<ref name=\"Murdoch History\" />\n\nAt the time, the young university was notable for its admissions policy of taking into consideration eligibility factors other than the school leaving exam results of students. Other universities later came to adopt this more holistic perspective of student eligibility for entrance into university education.<ref name=\"Murdoch History\" />\n\nSince 2015, Murdoch University has become more teaching focused.  In late 2018, the University faced scandal subsequent to an enrolment surge of international students, many \u201clacking English language and computing skills\u201d. In 2019, a ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' investigation by the ABC found further denigration of standards with foreign students recruited as 'cash cows'.<ref>https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-06/uni-academics-risk-jobs-to-speak-about-international-students/11082640</ref>\n\n== Campuses ==\nMurdoch University has three Australian campuses: South Street Campus, Rockingham Campus, and Mandurah Campus.\n\n=== South Street ===\nThe main campus is on South Street, Perth, in the suburb of Murdoch, near the [[Kwinana Freeway]] ({{coord|-32.066|115.835|type:edu_region:AU|name=Murdoch University, South Street campus|display=inline,title}}).

The library and first academic buildings flanking this court were designed by R J Ferguson, who also designed several buildings on the [[University of Western Australia]] campus. According to the foundation ethos of Murdoch University, there were to be no imposing buildings like the University of Western Australia\u2019s grand, Mediterranean-style Winthrop Hall, with its imposing clock tower. Rather, the architecture adopts a low-slung form redolent of a homestead, with covered walkways suggesting a hybrid veranda or cloister around the bush court. In the smaller courtyards exotic gardens, including a Chinese garden of rocks and stones, contrast with the bush court.<ref>[[Hannah Lewi]] and Andrew Saniga, 2014'  'Planning for Expansion and Dissent: the a Modern Australian Campus, in edited proceedings, Expansion and Conflict, 13th International Docomomo Conference, Seoul Korea, September 2014.</ref> The planting and landscaping were the work of Marion Blackwell.\n\nFeatures of the campus include the Joglo Rahayu (Peace Pavilion), a semi-enclosed pavilion near the Education and Humanities building.

He also served for part of that time as a military chaplain at Tauherenikau Camp, near Featherston. From 1919 until 1932 he was minister of the Baptist Church in Sydenham, Christchurch. After his retirement in 1932 he remained active in the church, serving as president of the Canterbury Auxiliary of the Baptist Union, organising a Sunday school in Christchurch and helping to start a Baptist church at Greymouth.<ref name=\"teara.govt.nz\"/>\n\nHe was President of the Baptist Union of New Zealand between 1916\u20131918 and Foundation President of the Invercargill WEA ([[Workers Educational Association]]) in 1915.<ref name=\"teara.govt.nz\"/>\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Local body===\n\nIn 1914 he was transferred to [[Invercargill]] and, while there, spent 12 months on the borough council.

His father Bernard worked in a timber yard and his mother Doreen was a homemaker who immigrated to New Zealand from [[England]] after the [[World War II]]. He is the youngest of 3 siblings which include brother Frank and sister Susan. [[File:Tony Christiansen sitting up in hospital.jpg|thumb|alt=Tony Christiansen day after his accident.|Christiansen days after his accident.]]\n\n===Hit by a train===\nOn the morning of 3 June 1967 which was [[Queen's Birthday]] weekend, Christiansen had followed friend Gary Winters and his father Mick to the railway yard near Te Maunga to bag coal for sale to raise money for charity. As the two children were crossing the tracks, the train shunted backwards dragging Christiansen under and the dual set of wheels ran over his legs almost severing them.<ref name=\"Accident\"/>\n\nAs a result of this accident, both his legs could not be saved and were amputated. 48 hours after the accident, Christiansen was found sitting up in a wheelchair and in good spirits.<ref name=\"Accident\"/>\n\n==Achievements==\nChristiansen very quickly got on with life after his wounds healed. His extraordinary achievements following the accident made him New Zealand's most notable [[motivational speaker]]<ref name=\"Ashburton\"/> and one of the world's most interesting.<ref name=\"NZToday\"/>\n\n[[File:Tony Christiansen - Inspirational Speaker @ Swim.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Tony Christiansen Swim.|Christiansen young with no legs but a very abled swimmer.]]\n\n===Confidence in the water===\nAfter his accident, many people including strangers, visited Christiansen and wanted to help. Among them, 2 people made a significant difference to Christiansen's life. They were swimming coaches Dave Franklin and Allan Guthrie.<ref name=\"McCaroll\"/>\n\nEven before his accident, Christiansen hated water but Franklin and Guthrie were very persistent in teaching the now disabled young boy how to swim. Within 5 months of his first lesson, less than a year after his accident, Christiansen at 10 years of age, swam a mile non-stop.<ref name=\"Swim1\"/>\n\nThe following year, Christiansen joined the [[Tauranga]] Swimming Club and continued to improve as a swimmer while he became physically stronger. He set a goal to compete in the [[Tauranga]] mayor's annual sponsored swimming race held by the [[Lions Club]].\n\nOn 6 May 1971, Christiansen came just behind the mayor Bob Owen in that {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} race <ref name=\"Swim\"/> and in February 1974, he beat the mayor in the Annual Harbour \"Swimathon\".<ref name=\"SwimChairman\"/>\n\n===Surf Lifesaving===\nDuring his years in school, Christiansen was alienated from most of the physical activities. In his fifth form, week-long school camps were held, none of which he could participate in. As a result, his old swimming coach Dave Franklin invited him to join the surf lifesaving camp at the Omanu surf club. By the end of that week, Christiansen earned his surf lifesaving [[Bronze Medallion (New Zealand and Australia)]] <ref name=\"Lifesaver\"/><ref name=\"NZHerald1\"/> and joined the Omanu Pacific Surf Lifesaving Club.\n\nIn 1978, Christiansen was granted a Special Achievement Award from World Life Saving <ref name=\"Lifesaver\"/><ref name=\"Award\"/> which today is known as the [[International Life Saving Federation]]. In the same year, he gained his instructor's certificate.<ref name=\"Award\"/>\n\nChristiansen remained a member of the Omanu Pacific Surf Lifesaving Club and worked as a surf lifeguard until the age of 23. He was also the club's canoe team captain.<ref name=\"Lifesaver\"/> Throughout his career as a surf lifesaver, Christiansen made 33 rescues.<ref name=\"NZToday\"/><ref name=\"McCaroll\"/> He was believed to be the only paraplegic lifeguard in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=\"FESPIC\"/>\n\n[[File:Tony Christiansen - Inspirational Speaker @ FESPIC Games.jpg|thumb|alt=FESPIC Games.|Only 16 years of age at the 1975 [[FESPIC Games]], winning silver in the 100 metre sprints, gold in javelin and swimming.]]\n\n===Athletics Career & Representing New Zealand===\nAround the same time Christiansen got into surf lifesaving, he also became involved in the disabled sports movement. It wasn't long before he set a goal to represent New Zealand internationally.<ref name=\"ThatsLife\"/>\n\nChristiansen trained for the National Disabled Games in Wellington and competed in wheelchair racing, [[shot put]], [[discus]], [[Javelin throw|javelin]] and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]]. In 1972, he was nominated for a New Zealand Herald Junior Sports Award which he did not win but was recognized by the judges who included Yvette Corlett (1952 Olympic long jump champion), [[Murray Halberg]] and [[Don Oliver]].<ref name=\"NZHerald\"/> In 1976, he was nominated again and this time he won the award for paraplegic sports.<ref name=\"NZHerald1\"/>\n\nDuring his career in athletics, Christiansen held several local records and was the area pentathlon champion in 1978.<ref name=\"Lifesaver\"/>\n\nChristiansen's other international sports achievements include:\n* [[FESPIC Games]], [[\u014cita, \u014cita|Oita]] Japan 1975 - Gold in [[Javelin throw|javelin]] and 50 metres [[freestyle swimming]]; Silver in 100 metres wheelchair dash.<ref name=\"FESPIC\"/><ref name=\"FESPIC1\"/>\n* [[FESPIC Games]], [[Sydney]] Australia 1977 \u2013 Gold in [[shot put]], [[discus]], [[Javelin throw|javelin]], [[pentathlon]] and 100 metres swim; silver in 50 metres [[freestyle swimming]]; bronze in [[snooker]].<ref name=\"Race\"/>\n* [[FESPIC Games]], [[Hong Kong]] 1982 \u2013 Gold in [[discus]], silver in [[Javelin throw|javelin]] and [[basketball]], bronze in [[shot put]].<ref name=\"Race\"/>\n\nThroughout his athletics career, Christiansen represented New Zealand 5 times at the [[World Games]], [[FESPIC Games]] and the Paralympic Qualifying Games and won 35 medals including 12 golds, 17 silver and 6 bronze medals.<ref name=\"Race\"/><ref name=\"Lifesaver\"/>\n\n[[File:Tony Christiansen - Inspirational Speaker @ Signwriting.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Tony Christiansen Signwriting.|Christiansen at his best trade as a signwriter.]]\n\n===The Successful Business<ref name=\"Race\"/>===\nIn the book about his life, Race You To The Top, Christiansen described his performance in school as \"having artistic talent but never very academic\".\n\nWhile at school, Christiansen worked part-time doing signwriting jobs on stockcars and the same for [[Woolworths Limited|Woolworths]]. These credentials later led to a job as a ticket writer in [[New World (supermarket)]]. At the same time, he also worked for the Tauranga Museum where he learned many new skills.<ref name=\"ThatsLife\"/>\n\nChristiansen tried applying for jobs with signwriting companies but his numerous attempts failed. He eventually hassled Lance Styles, the owner of Commercial Signs, enough to land a job. Within 3 months, he had proven himself and impressed Styles who made him foreman.\n\nChristiansen later left Commercial Signs. In 1985, he returned and took a stake in the company. In 1995, he bought over the rest of the shareholding and became the sole owner of the company. For the next 2 years, he turned it into one of the largest commercial signwriting business in New Zealand and sold it in 1997 <ref name=\"NZToday\"/> to begin his career as a professional speaker.\n\n[[File:Tony Christiansen - Inspirational Speaker @ Motor Sports Race Car Champion.jpg|thumb|alt=Tony Christiansen Race Car Champion.|Christiansen won the race at Baypark Speedway.]]\n\n===Motor Sports===\nFrom a young age, Christiansen fell in love with cars and motor sports, picking up go-karting at the age of 12. He gave up the sport when he took up surf lifesaving but went back into motor sports at 26 and therein started competing on the race track.<ref name=\"Timescan\"/>\n\nIn order to drive, Christiansen integrates a hand control which are motorcycle-style twist throttle attached to a handle, in all his cars.<ref name=\"NZToday\"/><ref name=\"Timescan\"/><ref name=\"Toenails\"/><ref name=\"Zephyr1\"/> He names his midget race car \"Toenails\" and over the years have won several races locally at the Baypark Speedway<ref name=\"Race\"/><ref name=\"Toenails\"/> and domestically.<ref name=\"Timescan\"/><ref name=\"Zephyr1\"/> He also competed in the Pre-65 races in a [[Ford Zephyr]] Mark III<ref name=\"NZToday\"/><ref name=\"Zephyr1\"/><ref name=\"Zephyr\"/> and made his sprint car debut at [[Western Springs]] in November 1996.<ref name=\"Sprint\"/>\n\nChristiansen also participated in off-road races.<ref name=\"McCaroll\"/><ref name=\"Toenails\"/><ref name=\"Zephyr1\"/> His race cars are usually a signature yellow colour.<ref name=\"Timescan\"/><ref name=\"Toenails\"/>\n\nIn 2015, Christiansen returned to circuit racing and joined the Star Touring Car series. His car has a Holden body and runs on a Suzuki GSXR engine. He won the 2016 series with the highest points in the Star Car category.<ref name=\"Star\"/>\n\n===Martial Arts===\n[[File:Tony Christiansen - Inspirational Speaker @ Taekwondo 1.jpg|thumb|alt=Tae Kwon Do.|Training with Master Kesi O'Neil and mastering the art of [[Tae Kwon Do]].]]\n\nChristiansen was introduced to [[martial arts]] in 1986 through one of his children who was taking [[Tae Kwon Do]] lessons<ref name=\"NZToday\"/> and he decided to aim for a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]]. He trained under Allan France and later under Master Kesi O\u2019Neill after France moved to Australia.<ref name=\"Race\"/>\n\nHe obtained his Second Degree [[Black belt (martial arts)|Black Belt]] in 1990 <ref name=\"McCaroll\"/><ref name=\"Taekwondo\"/> and decided to move on to other things.\n\n===Pilot & Aviation History===\n[[File:Tony Christiansen - Inspirational Speaker @ Cessna 172 Pilot.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Pilot Tony Christiansen flies the Cessna 172.|Christiansen flies the Cessna 172 at [[Tauranga]] Airport.]]\n\nChristiansen's introduction to aviation started with radio-controlled planes which remains a passionate hobby.<ref name=\"Race\"/>  He had met and was taught to fly by Phil Hooker, the Bay of Plenty Flight Centre's chief flying instructor<ref name=\"Aviation\"/><ref name=\"Aviation1\"/>  whom Christiansen taught to fly radio-controlled planes.<ref name=\"Aviation\"/><ref name=\"Aviation2\"/>\n\nChristiansen flies a Cessna 172<ref name=\"Aviation\"/><ref name=\"Aviation1\"/> with a portable hand control to move rudders and apply the brakes.<ref name=\"Aviation2\"/>\n\nOn 24 March 1998,<ref name=\"Race\"/> Christiansen created aviation history when he became the first disabled New Zealander to fly solo.<ref name=\"McCaroll\"/><ref name=\"Aviation2\"/> According to a Civil Aviation Authority spokeswoman, Christiansen was the first person who had learned to fly from scratch with a disability.<ref name=\"Aviation2\"/>\n\n=== Kilimanjaro<ref name=\"Attitude\"/> ===\n[[File:Tony Christiansen - Inspirational Speaker @ Climbing Kilimanjaro.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Tony Christiansen climbing Mount Kilimanjaro.|Christiansen at the summit of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]].]]\nIn 2002, Christiansen was invited by [[Korean Broadcasting System]] to scale [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] with 2 other Koreans \u2013 Soo Young, a blind young woman and Hong Bin, an experienced mountaineer who lost all his fingers to frostbite on a climbing expedition in Canada.<ref name=\"Kilimanjaro\"/>\n\nAfter about 2 weeks of preparations and media interviews in [[Korea]], the group departed for [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Nairobi]] and travelled onwards to [[Arusha]] in northern [[Tanzania]]. They spent 3 days filming in a village with the [[Maasai people]].\n\nChristiansen climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in his mountain-climbing wheelchair as much as he could and the rest of the journey on his backside with only a pair of hi-tech, New Zealand-designed vinyl pants and a pair of gloves protecting him from the sharp volcanic rocks.<ref name=\"Kilimanjaro\"/>\n\nThe group reached the summit of the mountain on 21 December 2002. Christiansen reached Gilman's Point, the second highest peak at 5,685 metres. He did not reach Uhuru, the highest peak at 5,895 metres as he admitted in his book that he could not physically go on through the incredibly steep and rough terrain at the summit. It was also snowing and raining and it was getting dark, all making it too dangerous to carry on.\n\nIt took Christiansen 10 hours to reach Gilman's Point from Kibo Hut which is the last station on the [[Mount Kilimanjaro climbing routes#Marangu Route|Marangu Route]], and only 2 hours to descent.\n\nChristiansen's [[Kilimanjaro]] experience is told in detail in his second book \"Attitude Plus!\".<ref name=\"Otago\"/> He considers his climb to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro one of his proudest moment.<ref name=\"CHC\"/>\n\n===World\u2019s Fastest Amputee===\n[[File:Tony Christiansen - Inspirational Speaker @ Bonneville Worlds Fastest Amputee.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Tony Christiansen attempts to be the World's Fastest Amputee at the Bonneville Salt Flats.|Christiansen at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] with his dragster.]]\nIn 2008, having watched the movie \"[[The World's Fastest Indian]]\" 27 times on Air New Zealand flights, Christiansen was inspired to become \"The World\u2019s Fastest Amputee\".<ref name=\"Bonneville\"/><ref name=\"Bonneville1\"/> He set a goal to attempt to reach 200&nbsp;mph (321&nbsp;km/h) on the famed [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in [[Utah]], United States.<ref name=\"Bonneville\"/>\n\nHe set about modifying his C/Altered drag racer designed for a quarter mile strip into a salt flats racer that will run 8 miles (13&nbsp;km) on the vast salt flats.<ref name=\"Bonneville\"/>\n\nChristiansen's efforts were filmed by [[TV NZ]] for a documentary programme which captured the emotional highs and lows of his Speedweek venture. He did not achieve this targeted speed of {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, instead topped at 182&nbsp;mph (293&nbsp;km/h).<ref name=\"Bonneville2\"/>\n\n===Snow Sports===\nIn 2010 at [[Whakapapa skifield]], Christiansen met American adaptive ski instructor Travis Thiele, who works with the National Ability Center in the United States and took his first lesson in adaptive skiing. Christiansen did not fall. Thiele described Christiansen as \"strong as an ox\" and admitted that he had never in his career met a first-time adaptive skier who did not fall on his first attempt.<ref name=\"Ski\"/>\n\nThrough Thiele, Christiansen was introduced to members of the Paralympic Committee of the [[International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation]] ([[FIBT]]) who were campaigning to introduce a two-man adaptive bobsled competition as a demonstration sport at the [[2014 Winter Paralympics]] in [[Sochi]], Russia.<ref name=\"Bobsled\"/> In January 2012, Christiansen participated in the first ever International Introduction and Development School for Adaptive Bobsled and Skeleton hosted by the United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation and the [[Utah Olympic Park Track]]. He took the position and qualified as a bobsled driver.<ref name=\"Bobsled\"/>\n\nChristiansen is officially a member of [[FIBT]] representing New Zealand.<ref name=\"FIBT\"/>\n\n===Handcycling===\n[[File:Tony Christiansen @ Otago Central Rail Trail.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Tony Christiansen riding the Otago Central Rail Trail.|Christiansen riding the [[Otago Central Rail Trail]] towing his wheelchair.]]\nChristiansen rides his handcycles regularly as a form of exercise. In January 2015, he took part in the Round The Mountain Paracycling Challenge with 5 other handcyclist, riding the steep leg 4 of 6 legs. The challenge was a 150&nbsp;km route around [[Mount Taranaki]] in [[New Plymouth]].<ref name=\"Handcycle\"/>\n\nThe following month, Christiansen attempted and successfully rode the entire length of the [[Otago Central Rail Trail]].<ref name=\"Handcycle1\"/> He described the effort to be harder than he had expected as either his front steering wheel or both his back wheels were always grinding into the loose rocks. This resulted in him riding 8 to 11 hours a day. He started the ride in Clyde on 21 February and completed his feat in Middlemarch on 25 February 2015.\n\n==Politics==\nChristiansen was a candidate for the [[Bay of Plenty (New Zealand electorate)]] for the Kiwi Party in the 2008 General Election.<ref name=\"Politics\"/> He did not win the seat, garnering 2,258 votes, losing to incumbent [[Tony Ryall]].<ref name=\"Politics0\"/>\n\nIn 2010, Christiansen put his name forward for a seat in the Tauranga City Council local body elections.<ref name=\"Politics1\"/> He won and was the highest polling at-large candidate with 10,890 votes.<ref name=\"Politics2\"/><ref name=\"Politics3\"/><ref name=\"Politics4\"/><ref>[http://www.tauranga.govt.nz/about-the-council/the-elected-members/mayor-and-councillors/cr-tony-christiansen.aspx \"Cr.

His father Bernard worked in a timber yard and his mother Doreen was a homemaker who immigrated to New Zealand from [[England]] after the [[World War II]]. He is the youngest of 3 siblings which include brother Frank and sister Susan. [[File:Tony Christiansen sitting up in hospital.jpg|thumb|alt=Tony Christiansen day after his accident.|Christiansen days after his accident.]]\n\n===Hit by a train===\nOn the morning of 3 June 1967 which was [[Queen's Birthday]] weekend, Christiansen had followed friend Gary Winters and his father Mick to the railway yard near Te Maunga to bag coal for sale to raise money for charity. As the two children were crossing the tracks, the train shunted backwards dragging Christiansen under and the dual set of wheels ran over his legs almost severing them.<ref name=\"Accident\"/>\n\nAs a result of this accident, both his legs could not be saved and were amputated. 48 hours after the accident, Christiansen was found sitting up in a wheelchair and in good spirits.<ref name=\"Accident\"/>\n\n==Achievements==\nChristiansen very quickly got on with life after his wounds healed. His extraordinary achievements following the accident made him New Zealand's most notable [[motivational speaker]]<ref name=\"Ashburton\"/> and one of the world's most interesting.<ref name=\"NZToday\"/>\n\n[[File:Tony Christiansen - Inspirational Speaker @ Swim.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Tony Christiansen Swim.|Christiansen young with no legs but a very abled swimmer.]]\n\n===Confidence in the water===\nAfter his accident, many people including strangers, visited Christiansen and wanted to help. Among them, 2 people made a significant difference to Christiansen\u2019s life. They were swimming coaches Dave Franklin and Allan Guthrie.<ref name=\"McCaroll\"/>\n\nEven before his accident, Christiansen hated water but Franklin and Guthrie were very persistent in teaching the now disabled young boy how to swim. Within 5 months of his first lesson, less than a year after his accident, Christiansen at 10 years of age, swam a mile non-stop.<ref name=\"Swim1\"/>\n\nThe following year, Christiansen joined the [[Tauranga]] Swimming Club and continued to improve as a swimmer while he became physically stronger. He set a goal to compete in the [[Tauranga]] mayor\u2019s annual sponsored swimming race held by the [[Lions Club]].\n\nOn 6 May 1971, Christiansen came just behind the mayor Bob Owen in that {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} race <ref name=\"Swim\"/> and in February 1974, he beat the mayor in the Annual Harbour \"Swimathon\".<ref name=\"SwimChairman\"/>\n\n===Surf Lifesaving===\nDuring his years in school, Christiansen was alienated from most of the physical activities. In his fifth form, week-long school camps were held, none of which he could participate in. As a result, his old swimming coach Dave Franklin invited him to join the surf lifesaving camp at the Omanu surf club. By the end of that week, Christiansen earned his surf lifesaving [[Bronze Medallion (New Zealand and Australia)]] <ref name=\"Lifesaver\"/><ref name=\"NZHerald1\"/> and joined the Omanu Pacific Surf Lifesaving Club.\n\nIn 1978, Christiansen was granted a Special Achievement Award from World Life Saving <ref name=\"Lifesaver\"/><ref name=\"Award\"/> which today is known as the [[International Life Saving Federation]]. In the same year, he gained his instructor\u2019s certificate.<ref name=\"Award\"/>\n\nChristiansen remained a member of the Omanu Pacific Surf Lifesaving Club and worked as a surf lifeguard until the age of 23. He was also the club's canoe team captain.<ref name=\"Lifesaver\"/> Throughout his career as a surf lifesaver, Christiansen made 33 rescues.<ref name=\"NZToday\"/><ref name=\"McCaroll\"/> He was believed to be the only paraplegic lifeguard in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=\"FESPIC\"/>\n\n[[File:Tony Christiansen - Inspirational Speaker @ FESPIC Games.jpg|thumb|alt=FESPIC Games.|Only 16 years of age at the 1975 [[FESPIC Games]], winning silver in the 100 metre sprints, gold in javelin and swimming.]]\n\n===Athletics Career & Representing New Zealand===\nAround the same time Christiansen got into surf lifesaving, he also became involved in the disabled sports movement. It wasn\u2019t long before he set a goal to represent New Zealand internationally.<ref name=\"ThatsLife\"/>\n\nChristiansen trained for the National Disabled Games in Wellington and competed in wheelchair racing, [[shot put]], [[discus]], [[Javelin throw|javelin]] and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]]. In 1972, he was nominated for a New Zealand Herald Junior Sports Award which he did not win but was recognized by the judges who included Yvette Corlett (1952 Olympic long jump champion), [[Murray Halberg]] and [[Don Oliver]].<ref name=\"NZHerald\"/> In 1976, he was nominated again and this time he won the award for paraplegic sports.<ref name=\"NZHerald1\"/>\n\nDuring his career in athletics, Christiansen held several local records and was the area pentathlon champion in 1978.<ref name=\"Lifesaver\"/>\n\nChristiansen\u2019s other international sports achievements include:\n* [[FESPIC Games]], [[\u014cita, \u014cita|Oita]] Japan 1975 - Gold in [[Javelin throw|javelin]] and 50 metres [[freestyle swimming]]; Silver in 100 metres wheelchair dash.<ref name=\"FESPIC\"/><ref name=\"FESPIC1\"/>\n* [[FESPIC Games]], [[Sydney]] Australia 1977 \u2013 Gold in [[shot put]], [[discus]], [[Javelin throw|javelin]], [[pentathlon]] and 100 metres swim; silver in 50 metres [[freestyle swimming]]; bronze in [[snooker]].<ref name=\"Race\"/>\n* [[FESPIC Games]], [[Hong Kong]] 1982 \u2013 Gold in [[discus]], silver in [[Javelin throw|javelin]] and [[basketball]], bronze in [[shot put]].<ref name=\"Race\"/>\n\nThroughout his athletics career, Christiansen represented New Zealand 5 times at the [[World Games]], [[FESPIC Games]] and the Paralympic Qualifying Games and won 35 medals including 12 golds, 17 silver and 6 bronze medals.<ref name=\"Race\"/><ref name=\"Lifesaver\"/>\n\n[[File:Tony Christiansen - Inspirational Speaker @ Signwriting.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Tony Christiansen Signwriting.|Christiansen at his best trade as a signwriter.]]\n\n===The Successful Business<ref name=\"Race\"/>===\nIn the book about his life, Race You To The Top, Christiansen described his performance in school as \"having artistic talent but never very academic\".\n\nWhile at school, Christiansen worked part-time doing signwriting jobs on stockcars and the same for [[Woolworths Limited|Woolworths]]. These credentials later led to a job as a ticket writer in [[New World (supermarket)]]. At the same time, he also worked for the Tauranga Museum where he learned many new skills.<ref name=\"ThatsLife\"/>\n\nChristiansen tried applying for jobs with signwriting companies but his numerous attempts failed. He eventually hassled Lance Styles, the owner of Commercial Signs, enough to land a job. Within 3 months, he had proven himself and impressed Styles who made him foreman.\n\nChristiansen later left Commercial Signs. In 1985, he returned and took a stake in the company. In 1995, he bought over the rest of the shareholding and became the sole owner of the company. For the next 2 years, he turned it into one of the largest commercial signwriting business in New Zealand and sold it in 1997 <ref name=\"NZToday\"/> to begin his career as a professional speaker.\n\n[[File:Tony Christiansen - Inspirational Speaker @ Motor Sports Race Car Champion.jpg|thumb|alt=Tony Christiansen Race Car Champion.|Christiansen won the race at Baypark Speedway.]]\n\n===Motor Sports===\nFrom a young age, Christiansen fell in love with cars and motor sports, picking up go-karting at the age of 12. He gave up the sport when he took up surf lifesaving but went back into motor sports at 26 and therein started competing on the race track.<ref name=\"Timescan\"/>\n\nIn order to drive, Christiansen integrates a hand control which are motorcycle-style twist throttle attached to a handle, in all his cars.<ref name=\"NZToday\"/><ref name=\"Timescan\"/><ref name=\"Toenails\"/><ref name=\"Zephyr1\"/> He names his midget race car \"Toenails\" and over the years have won several races locally at the Baypark Speedway<ref name=\"Race\"/><ref name=\"Toenails\"/> and domestically.<ref name=\"Timescan\"/><ref name=\"Zephyr1\"/> He also competed in the Pre-65 races in a [[Ford Zephyr]] Mark III<ref name=\"NZToday\"/><ref name=\"Zephyr1\"/><ref name=\"Zephyr\"/> and made his sprint car debut at [[Western Springs]] in November 1996.<ref name=\"Sprint\"/>\n\nChristiansen also participated in off-road races.<ref name=\"McCaroll\"/><ref name=\"Toenails\"/><ref name=\"Zephyr1\"/> His race cars are usually a signature yellow colour.<ref name=\"Timescan\"/><ref name=\"Toenails\"/>\n\nIn 2015, Christiansen returned to circuit racing and joined the Star Touring Car series. His car has a Holden body and runs on a Suzuki GSXR engine. He won the 2016 series with the highest points in the Star Car category.<ref name=\"Star\"/>\n\n===Martial Arts===\n[[File:Tony Christiansen - Inspirational Speaker @ Taekwondo 1.jpg|thumb|alt=Tae Kwon Do.|Training with Master Kesi O'Neil and mastering the art of [[Tae Kwon Do]].]]\n\nChristiansen was introduced to [[martial arts]] in 1986 through one of his children who was taking [[Tae Kwon Do]] lessons<ref name=\"NZToday\"/> and he decided to aim for a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]]. He trained under Allan France and later under Master Kesi O\u2019Neill after France moved to Australia.<ref name=\"Race\"/>\n\nHe obtained his Second Degree [[Black belt (martial arts)|Black Belt]] in 1990 <ref name=\"McCaroll\"/><ref name=\"Taekwondo\"/> and decided to move on to other things.\n\n===Pilot & Aviation History===\n[[File:Tony Christiansen - Inspirational Speaker @ Cessna 172 Pilot.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Pilot Tony Christiansen flies the Cessna 172.|Christiansen flies the Cessna 172 at [[Tauranga]] Airport.]]\n\nChristiansen\u2019s introduction to aviation started with radio-controlled planes which remains a passionate hobby.<ref name=\"Race\"/>  He had met and was taught to fly by Phil Hooker, the Bay of Plenty Flight Centre\u2019s chief flying instructor<ref name=\"Aviation\"/><ref name=\"Aviation1\"/>  whom Christiansen taught to fly radio-controlled planes.<ref name=\"Aviation\"/><ref name=\"Aviation2\"/>\n\nChristiansen flies a Cessna 172<ref name=\"Aviation\"/><ref name=\"Aviation1\"/> with a portable hand control to move rudders and apply the brakes.<ref name=\"Aviation2\"/>\n\nOn 24 March 1998,<ref name=\"Race\"/> Christiansen created aviation history when he became the first disabled New Zealander to fly solo.<ref name=\"McCaroll\"/><ref name=\"Aviation2\"/> According to a Civil Aviation Authority spokeswoman, Christiansen was the first person who had learned to fly from scratch with a disability.<ref name=\"Aviation2\"/>\n\n=== Kilimanjaro<ref name=\"Attitude\"/> ===\n[[File:Tony Christiansen - Inspirational Speaker @ Climbing Kilimanjaro.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Tony Christiansen climbing Mount Kilimanjaro.|Christiansen at the summit of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]].]]\nIn 2002, Christiansen was invited by [[Korean Broadcasting System]] to scale [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] with 2 other Koreans \u2013 Soo Young, a blind young woman and Hong Bin, an experienced mountaineer who lost all his fingers to frostbite on a climbing expedition in Canada.<ref name=\"Kilimanjaro\"/>\n\nAfter about 2 weeks of preparations and media interviews in [[Korea]], the group departed for [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Nairobi]] and travelled onwards to [[Arusha]] in northern [[Tanzania]]. They spent 3 days filming in a village with the [[Maasai people]].\n\nChristiansen climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in his mountain-climbing wheelchair as much as he could and the rest of the journey on his backside with only a pair of hi-tech, New Zealand-designed vinyl pants and a pair of gloves protecting him from the sharp volcanic rocks.<ref name=\"Kilimanjaro\"/>\n\nThe group reached the summit of the mountain on 21 December 2002. Christiansen reached Gilman\u2019s Point, the second highest peak at 5,685 metres. He did not reach Uhuru, the highest peak at 5,895 metres as he admitted in his book that he could not physically go on through the incredibly steep and rough terrain at the summit. It was also snowing and raining and it was getting dark, all making it too dangerous to carry on.\n\nIt took Christiansen 10 hours to reach Gilman\u2019s Point from Kibo Hut which is the last station on the [[Mount Kilimanjaro climbing routes#Marangu Route|Marangu Route]], and only 2 hours to descent.\n\nChristiansen\u2019s [[Kilimanjaro]] experience is told in detail in his second book \"Attitude Plus!\".<ref name=\"Otago\"/> He considers his climb to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro one of his proudest moment.<ref name=\"CHC\"/>\n\n===World\u2019s Fastest Amputee===\n[[File:Tony Christiansen - Inspirational Speaker @ Bonneville Worlds Fastest Amputee.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Tony Christiansen attempts to be the World's Fastest Amputee at the Bonneville Salt Flats.|Christiansen at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] with his dragster.]]\nIn 2008, having watched the movie \"[[The World's Fastest Indian]]\" 27 times on Air New Zealand flights, Christiansen was inspired to become \"The World\u2019s Fastest Amputee\".<ref name=\"Bonneville\"/><ref name=\"Bonneville1\"/> He set a goal to attempt to reach 200&nbsp;mph (321&nbsp;km/h) on the famed [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in [[Utah]], United States.<ref name=\"Bonneville\"/>\n\nHe set about modifying his C/Altered drag racer designed for a quarter mile strip into a salt flats racer that will run 8 miles (13&nbsp;km) on the vast salt flats.<ref name=\"Bonneville\"/>\n\nChristiansen's efforts were filmed by [[TV NZ]] for a documentary programme which captured the emotional highs and lows of his Speedweek venture. He did not achieve this targeted speed of {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, instead topped at 182&nbsp;mph (293&nbsp;km/h).<ref name=\"Bonneville2\"/>\n\n===Snow Sports===\nIn 2010 at [[Whakapapa skifield]], Christiansen met American adaptive ski instructor Travis Thiele, who works with the National Ability Center in the United States and took his first lesson in adaptive skiing. Christiansen did not fall. Thiele described Christiansen as \"strong as an ox\" and admitted that he had never in his career met a first-time adaptive skier who did not fall on his first attempt.<ref name=\"Ski\"/>\n\nThrough Thiele, Christiansen was introduced to members of the Paralympic Committee of the [[International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation]] ([[FIBT]]) who were campaigning to introduce a two-man adaptive bobsled competition as a demonstration sport at the [[2014 Winter Paralympics]] in [[Sochi]], Russia.<ref name=\"Bobsled\"/> In January 2012, Christiansen participated in the first ever International Introduction and Development School for Adaptive Bobsled and Skeleton hosted by the United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation and the [[Utah Olympic Park Track]]. He took the position and qualified as a bobsled driver.<ref name=\"Bobsled\"/>\n\nChristiansen is officially a member of [[FIBT]] representing New Zealand.<ref name=\"FIBT\"/>\n\n===Handcycling===\n[[File:Tony Christiansen @ Otago Central Rail Trail.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Tony Christiansen riding the Otago Central Rail Trail.|Christiansen riding the [[Otago Central Rail Trail]] towing his wheelchair.]]\nChristiansen rides his handcycles regularly as a form of exercise. In January 2015, he took part in the Round The Mountain Paracycling Challenge with 5 other handcyclist, riding the steep leg 4 of 6 legs. The challenge was a 150&nbsp;km route around [[Mount Taranaki]] in [[New Plymouth]].<ref name=\"Handcycle\"/>\n\nThe following month, Christiansen attempted and successfully rode the entire length of the [[Otago Central Rail Trail]].<ref name=\"Handcycle1\"/> He described the effort to be harder than he had expected as either his front steering wheel or both his back wheels were always grinding into the loose rocks. This resulted in him riding 8 to 11 hours a day. He started the ride in Clyde on 21 February and completed his feat in Middlemarch on 25 February 2015.\n\n==Politics==\nChristiansen was a candidate for the [[Bay of Plenty (New Zealand electorate)]] for the Kiwi Party in the 2008 General Election.<ref name=\"Politics\"/> He did not win the seat, garnering 2,258 votes, losing to incumbent [[Tony Ryall]].<ref name=\"Politics0\"/>\n\nIn 2010, Christiansen put his name forward for a seat in the Tauranga City Council local body elections.<ref name=\"Politics1\"/> He won and was the highest polling at-large candidate with 10,890 votes.<ref name=\"Politics2\"/><ref name=\"Politics3\"/><ref name=\"Politics4\"/><ref>[http://www.tauranga.govt.nz/about-the-council/the-elected-members/mayor-and-councillors/cr-tony-christiansen.aspx \"Cr.

It was originally broadcast in nine episodes on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in early 1996. Written by [[Peter Flannery]], it tells the story of four friends from the city of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in [[North East England]] over a period of 31 years, from 1964 to 1995. The story makes reference to certain political and social events which occurred during the era portrayed, some specific to Newcastle and others which affected Britain as a whole. These include general elections, police and local government corruption, the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)]] and the [[Great Storm of 1987]].\n\nThe serial is commonly regarded as one of the most successful [[BBC television drama]]s of the 1990s, described by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as \"a production where all&nbsp;... worked to serve a writer's vision. We are not likely to look upon its like again\".<ref>Unknown. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. Quoted on the DVD release cover. ([[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] DVD 74321 941149)</ref> It has been named by the [[British Film Institute]] as one of the [[BFI TV 100|100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, by ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper as the third greatest television drama of all time and by the ''[[Radio Times]]'' magazine as one of the 40 greatest television programmes.<ref name=\"tv100\">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321071033/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/prog.php?id=25|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/prog.php?id=25|title=BFI TV 100 \u2013 25: Our Friends in the North|first=Phil|last=Wickham|date=2000|accessdate=31 August 2013|archivedate=21 March 2012|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]}}</ref><ref name=\"guardgreatest\"/><ref name=\"rt1\"/> It was awarded three [[British Academy Television Awards]] (BAFTAs), two [[Royal Television Society]] Awards, four [[Broadcasting Press Guild]] Awards and a Certificate of Merit from the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"awards\"/>\n\n''Our Friends in the North'' helped to establish the careers of its four lead actors, [[Daniel Craig]], [[Christopher Eccleston]], [[Gina McKee]] and [[Mark Strong]]. Daniel Craig's part in particular has been referred to as his [[breakthrough role]].<ref name=\"friend\"/><ref name=\"guard2010\"/> It was also a controversial production, as its stories were partly based on real people and events. Several years passed before it was adapted from a play, performed by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], to a television drama, due in part to the BBC's fear of legal action.\n\n==Plot==\n\n{{See also|List of Our Friends in the North episodes}}\n\n[[File:Christopher Eccleston Thor 2 cropped.png|thumb|[[Christopher Eccleston]] (pictured in 2013) played Dominic 'Nicky' Hutchinson in ''Our Friends in the North'', earning a [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA]] nomination for his performance.]]\n\nIn 1964, 20 year-old university student Nicky Hutchinson ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) returns to Newcastle after volunteering for the summer in the [[U.S. civil rights movement]]. His friends Geordie ([[Daniel Craig]]) and Tosker ([[Mark Strong]]) want to start a band but Nicky rebuffs them as he is occupied with his volunteering work. Nicky's girlfriend Mary ([[Gina McKee]]) is also unhappy with his lack of attention and they drift apart. Tosker takes advantage of the situation and successfully woos Mary, getting her pregnant. Nicky is offered a job working for Austin Donohue ([[Alun Armstrong]]), a former council leader who is starting a PR and lobbying firm. Nicky is impressed by Austin's apparent passion for change and he drops out of university to accept the job, to the dismay of his working-class father, Felix ([[Peter Vaughan]]). Geordie gets into a fight with his abusive, alcoholic father and runs away from home, abandoning his pregnant fiancee.\n\nNow living in London, Geordie accepts a job offer from sleazy crime boss Benny Barrett ([[Malcolm McDowell]]) and begins working as his assistant in the Soho sex industry. Meanwhile, Mary and Tosker struggle to adapt to their new married life. Their high-rise [[council flat]], despite being brand new, is plagued by structural issues including rampant [[damp]]. Nicky is dismayed that Austin's firm is representing John Edwards, the owner of the company responsible for the sub-standard flats. After discovering records of the extensive bribery that took place in the project's development, Nicky quits in protest. Austin later receives 4 years in prison for his involvement and Edwards is declared bankrupt. Tosker's dreams of becoming a professional singer rapidly fade after a brutal audition with a local talent scout. Dejected, he continues to work menial jobs to make ends meet. After visiting Geordie in London, he is given a business loan from Benny and starts his own fruit and vegetable business. Around this time, Geordie starts an affair with Benny's girlfriend Julia.\n\nWorking as a photo journalist in London, Nicky's ideologies become extreme to the point he joins an [[Propaganda of the deed|anarchist terrorist]] cell. While laying-low in Newcastle, he is confronted by his parents and family friend Eddie Wells ([[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]]) after his mother Florrie ([[Freda Dowie]]) finds a gun in his room. However his anarchist activities are brought to a sudden halt when the cell's hideout is raided by the police and everyone but Nicky is arrested. Later, Eddie asks for Felix's help in his campaign to run as an independent Labour candidate in an upcoming [[by-election]], Felix eventually agreeing. Nicky also offers his support, but Eddie refuses due to Nicky's past ties to extremism. Despite turning down Nicky's help, Eddie narrowly wins the seat. Nicky eventually returns to mainstream politics in Newcastle and becomes a Labour parliamentary candidate himself. However despite running in a safe constituency and receiving an endorsement from Eddie, he manages to hand the seat to the Conservatives after a [[smear campaign]] depicts him as a terrorist sympathiser.\n\nThe situation gets progressively more difficult for Benny's businesses as continued pressure from the [[Metropolitan Police]] Commissioner Colin Blamire ([[Peter Jeffrey]]) forces the heavily corrupt vice (\"dirty\") squad to reluctantly act. Meanwhile, tired of being repeatedly blackmailed by the dirty squad, one of Benny's men takes evidence of Met corruption to the Sunday papers and the resulting scandal forces the government to hold an independent inquiry. Roy Johnson ([[Tony Haygarth]]) is brought in from Newcastle as an outsider to run the investigation but is obstructed at every turn by Blamire, dirty squad Commander Harry Chapple ([[Donald Sumpter]]) and his henchman John Salway ([[David Schofield (actor)|David Schofield]]). Blamire is able to use a separate investigation into the Home Secretary's past business dealings to blackmail him into supressing the inquiry findings. A disheartened Johnson returns to Newcastle to take early retirement. With the inquiry behind them, Benny and the dirty squad are free to reach a new lucrative arrangement. Benny then has Geordie framed and imprisoned in revenge for the affair with Julia years before. Subsequent police investigations eventually bring down Chapple, Salway and many others.\n\nSome years later, Tosker is now a moderately successful businessman and Mary is occupied with her advocacy work. After Tosker's repeated infidelity, their marriage irrevocable breaks down and he moves out to live with his new girlfriend, Elaine ([[Tracey Wilkinson]]). Nicky and Mary briefly meet, but she is hesitant to resume their relationship out of concern for her young children. Out of prison and back living in Newcastle, Geordie is devastated to learn that Julia has been killed in an apparent accident. He questions Benny over the death, but accepts Benny's argument that he had no motive. Geordie is soon in trouble with the law again and flees to London for a second time.\n\nIn 1984, Nicky is covering the ongoing [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|miners' strike]]. After being injured in a scuffle between the police and the miners, he rekindles his relationship with Mary. Tosker meanwhile has made his fortune as a [[slum landlord]], straining his marriage with Elaine. At her urging, he sells the properties and invests heavily in stocks, which are wiped out in a later [[Black Monday (1987)|market crash]]. 3 years later, Nicky is struggling with his marriage to Mary and also with his father Felix who has been diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. In London, he picks a fight with Eddie Wells and starts an affair with a young student, Alice. He eventually leaves Mary but by this point Alice has already moved on. Geordie, who is now an alcoholic and living at a homeless shelter, sets fire to his bed in a moment of madness. Quickly apprehended, he is deemed a danger to society and sentenced to life in prison. Nicky reconciles with Eddie after he discovers Eddie's assistant is an undercover mole for a PR company. Eddie resigns in embarrassment but dies of a heart attack as he is leaving Westminster. In Newcastle, Mary initially refuses to run in the by-election for Eddie's seat but eventually changes her mind and is elected. Exasperated at Felix's increasingly outlandish behaviour, Florrie can no longer cope and Felix is sent to a care home.\n\n7 years later in 1995, Nicky has been living in Italy and returns to Newcastle to attend Florrie's funeral. Tosker and Elaine have slowly rebuilt their business and are on the eve of opening a new [[Tuxedo floating nightclubs|floating nightclub]]. Geordie has escaped from prison and approaches the club looking for work, where he is recognised by Elaine. Although Tosker and Elaine privately do not believe his story that he is out on parole, they take him in and give him a job playing keyboard for the opening night band. Nicky desperately tries to convince Felix that his life was [[Jarrow March|not a failure]], but Felix's mind is too far gone to understand. Geordie tries to attend the club launch event but is refused entry due to a miscommunication with the bouncers. Tosker fills in for the band at the last minute and finally achieves his dream of stardom, albeit on a small scale. The four friends finally reunite at Florrie's funeral. Afterwards, Tosker spends time with his grandchildren, Nicky decides to try and patch things up with Mary, and Geordie walks off to an unknown fate.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christopher Eccleston]] as Nicky Hutchinson\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Terry \"Tosker\" Cox\n* [[Gina McKee]] as Mary Cox\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as Geordie Peacock\n* [[Peter Vaughan]] as Felix Hutchinson\n* [[Freda Dowie]] as Florrie Hutchinson\n* [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] as Eddie Wells\n* [[Tracey Wilkinson]] as Elaine Cox\n* [[Alun Armstrong]] as Austin Donohue\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as Benny Barratt\n* [[Donald Sumpter]] as Harold Chapple\n* [[David Schofield (actor)|David Schofield]] as John Salway\n* [[Peter Jeffrey]] as Commissioner Blamire\n* [[Tony Haygarth]] as Roy Johnson\n\n==Background==\n\n===Stage play===\n[[File:Northumberland St. Ncle 1969.jpg|thumb|[[Northumberland Street]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], pictured in 1969, before it was pedestrianised. Life in Newcastle in the 1960s was a major influence on [[Peter Flannery]]'s writing of ''Our Friends in the North''.|alt=A busy urban street in Newcastle in the late 1960s. There are tall buildings on either side of the street, and various 1960s cars and buses on the road.]]\n\n''Our Friends in the North'' was originally written by the playwright [[Peter Flannery]] for the [[theatre]], while he was a [[Artist-in-residence|writer in residence]] for the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] (RSC).<ref name=\"bfi2\">Eaton, p. 2</ref> The idea came to Flannery while he was watching the rehearsals for the company's production of ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 2|Part 2]]'' at [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] in 1980; the scale of the plays inspired him to come up with his own historical epic.<ref name=\"bfi2\"/> The original three-hour long theatre version of ''Our Friends in the North'', directed by [[John Caird (director)|John Caird]] and featuring [[Jim Broadbent]] and [[Roger Allam]] among the cast, was produced by the RSC in 1982. It initially ran for a week at [[The Other Place (theatre)|The Other Place]] in Stratford before touring to the city in which it was set, [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], and then playing at The Pit, a [[studio theatre]] in the [[Barbican Centre]] in London.<ref>Eaton, p. 8</ref> In its original form, the story went up only to the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] and the coming to power of the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government under [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref>Eaton, p. 121</ref> The play also contained a significant number of scenes set in [[Rhodesia]], chronicling [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|UDI]], the oil embargo and the emergence of armed resistance to white supremacy.<ref>Eaton, p. 6</ref> This plot strand was dropped from the televised version, although the title ''Our Friends in the North'', a reference to how staff at [[BP]] in [[South Africa]] referred to the Rhodesian government of [[Ian Smith]], remained.<ref>Eaton, p. 7</ref>\n\nFlannery was heavily influenced not only by his own political viewpoints and life experiences, but also by the actual history of his home city of Newcastle during the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=\"bfi45\">Eaton, pp. 4\u20135</ref> Characters such as Austin Donohue and John Edwards were directly based on the real-life scandals of [[T. Dan Smith]] and [[John Poulson]]. Flannery contacted Smith and explained that he was going to write a play based on the events of the scandal, to which Smith replied, \"There is a play here of Shakespearean proportions.\"<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Flannery, Peter |year=2002 |title=Retrospective: An Interview with the Creators of the Series |medium=DVD | publisher=BMG |id=BMG DVD 74321}}</ref>\n\n===1980s attempts at production===\nThe stage version of ''Our Friends in the North'' was seen by [[BBC television drama]] producer [[Michael Wearing]] in Newcastle in 1982, and he was immediately keen on producing a television adaptation.<ref>Eaton, p. 9</ref> At that time, Wearing was based at the [[BBC English Regions]] Drama Department at [[Pebble Mill Studios|BBC Pebble Mill]] in Birmingham, which had a specific remit for making \"regional drama\".<ref>Eaton, p. 12</ref> Wearing initially approached Flannery to adapt his play into a four-part television serial for [[BBC Two|BBC2]], with each episode being 50 minutes long and the Rhodesian strand dropped for practical reasons.<ref name=\"born357\">Born, p. 357</ref><ref>Eaton, p. 13</ref> A change of executives meant that the project was not produced, although Wearing persisted in trying to get it commissioned. Flannery extended the serial to six episodes,<ref name=\"born357\"/> one for each [[United Kingdom general election]] from 1964 to 1979.<ref>Eaton, p. 14</ref> However, by this point in the mid-1980s, [[Michael Grade]] was Director of Programmes for BBC Television, and he had no interest in the project.<ref name=\"born358\">Born, p. 358</ref>\n\nBy 1989, Wearing had been recalled to the central BBC drama department in [[London]] where he was made Head of Serials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1363520/index.html|title=Wearing, Michael (1989\u2013)|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|first=Lez|last=Cooke|accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref> This new seniority eventually allowed him to further the cause of ''Our Friends in the North''. Flannery wrote to the BBC's then Managing Director of Television, [[Will Wyatt]], \"accusing him of cowardice for not approving it.\"<ref name=\"brooks\">{{cite news|title=Friends come in from the BBC cold|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 January 1996|page=7|first=Richard|last=Brooks}}</ref> The BBC was concerned not only with the budget and resources that would be required to produce the serial, but also with potential legal issues. Much of the background story was based on real-life events and people, such as Smith and Poulson and former [[Home Secretary]] [[Reginald Maudling]], upon whom another character, Claud Seabrook, was based.<ref>Eaton, p. 65</ref> According to ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper, one senior BBC lawyer, Glen Del Medico, even threatened to resign if the production was made. Others tried to persuade Flannery to reset the piece \"in a fictional country called Albion rather than Britain.\"<ref name=\"brooks\"/> Both Smith and Poulson died before the programme aired.<ref name=\"sunday times\"/>\n\n===Pre-production===\nIn 1992, Wearing was able to persuade the controller of BBC Two, [[Alan Yentob]], to commission Peter Flannery to write scripts for a new version of the project.<ref name=\"born358\"/> Yentob had no great enthusiasm for ''Our Friends in the North'', as he remembered a meeting with Flannery in 1988, when the writer had left him unimpressed by stating that ''Our Friends in the North'' was about \"post-war [[public housing|social housing]] policy\".<ref name=\"born358\"/><ref>Eaton, p. 18</ref> As Wearing was now a head of department at the BBC, he was too busy overseeing other projects to produce ''Our Friends in the North''.<ref name=\"bfi21\">Eaton, p. 21</ref> [[George S. J. Faber|George Faber]] was briefly attached to the project as producer before he moved on to become Head of Single Drama at the BBC.<ref name=\"bfi21\"/> Faber was succeeded by a young producer with great enthusiasm for the project, [[Charles Pattinson]].<ref>Eaton, p. 23</ref>\n\nWhen Yentob was succeeded as controller of BBC Two by [[Michael Jackson (TV executive)|Michael Jackson]], Pattinson was able to persuade him to commission full production on the series.<ref name=\"bfi2425\">Eaton, pp. 24\u201325</ref> This was in spite of the fact that Jackson and Wearing were not close and did not get on; Pattinson took to dealing with Jackson directly.<ref name=\"born358\"/> Jackson had agreed to nine one-hour episodes but Flannery protested that each episode should be as long as it needed to be, to which Jackson agreed.<ref name=\"bfi2425\"/> The long delay in production did have the advantage of allowing Flannery to extend the story and instead of ending in 1979, it carried on into the 1990s, bringing the four central characters into [[middle age]].<ref name=\"screen\">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/540670/index.html|title=Our Friends in the North|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|first=Ronald|last=Hackston|accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref> Flannery later commented that: \"The project has undoubtedly benefited from the delay. I'm not sure I have\".<ref name=\"bfi2425\"/> The series encountered more legal problems, when some references to the fictional businessman Alan Roe were removed, because of a perceived similarity to Sir [[John Hall (businessman)|John Hall]], a Newcastle businessman who had a number of things in common.

Reviewing the first episode in ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper, Ian Bell wrote: \"Flannery's script is faultless; funny, chilling, evocative, spare, linguistically precise. The four young friends about to share 31 hellish years in the life of modern Britain are excellently played.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=A Brief History of Tyne|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=21 January 1996|page=18|first=Ian|last=Bell}}</ref>\n\nThe conclusion of the serial in March brought similar praise. \"''Our Friends in the North'' confounded the gloomier predictions about its content and proved that there was an audience for political material, provided that it found its way to the screen through lives imagined in emotional detail&nbsp;... It will be remembered for an intimate sense of character, powerful enough to make you forgive its faults and stay loyal to the end,\"<ref name=\"sutcliffe\"/> was the verdict of ''[[The Independent]]'' on the final episode. Writing in the same newspaper the following day, [[Jeffrey Richards]] added that \"Monday night's final episode of ''Our Friends in the North'' has left many people bereft. The serial captivated much of the country, sketching a panoramic view of life in Britain from the sixties to the nineties&nbsp;... At once sweeping and intimate, both moving and angry, simultaneously historical and contemporary, it has followed in the distinguished footsteps of BBC series such as ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-bbcs-voice-of-two-nations-1341796.html|title=The BBC's voice of two nations|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=13 March 1996|accessdate=2 September 2013|first=Jeffrey|last=Richards|authorlink=Jeffrey Richards|page=15}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the response was not exclusively positive. In ''[[The Independent#The Independent on Sunday|The Independent on Sunday]]'', columnist [[Lucy Ellmann]] criticised both what she saw as the unchanging nature of the characters and Flannery's concentration on friendship rather than family. \"What's in the water there anyway? These are the youngest grandparents ever seen! Nothing has changed about them since ''1964'' except a few grey hairs&nbsp;... It's quite impressive that anything emotional could be salvaged from this nine-part hop, skip and jump through the years.

And of the latter, \"Peter Flannery seems to want to suggest that friendships are the only cure for a life blighted by deficient parents. But all that links this ill-matched foursome in the end is history and sentimentality. The emotional centre of the writing is still in family ties.\"<ref name=\"ellman\"/>\n\nMichael Jackson, the BBC2 controller who had finally commissioned production of the serial, felt that even though it was successful, its [[social realism|social realist]] form was outdated.<ref name=\"born356\">Born, p. 356</ref> The academic [[Georgina Born]], writing in 2004, also felt that although the serial had its strengths, it also contained \"involuntary marks of pastiche\" in its treatment of social realism.<ref name=\"born356\"/>\n\nIn contrast, the [[British Film Institute]]'s [[Screenonline]] website praises the serial for its realistic and un-clich\u00e9d depiction of life in the [[North East England]], stating that: \"Unlike many depictions of the North-East, it has fully rounded characters with authentic regional accents.

It was originally broadcast in nine episodes on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in early 1996. Written by [[Peter Flannery]], it tells the story of four friends from the city of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in [[North East England]] over a period of 31 years, from 1964 to 1995. The story makes reference to certain political and social events which occurred during the era portrayed, some specific to Newcastle and others which affected Britain as a whole. These include general elections, police and local government corruption, the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)]] and the [[Great Storm of 1987]].\n\nThe serial is commonly regarded as one of the most successful [[BBC television drama]]s of the 1990s, described by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as \"a production where all&nbsp;... worked to serve a writer's vision. We are not likely to look upon its like again\".<ref>Unknown. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. Quoted on the DVD release cover. ([[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] DVD 74321 941149)</ref> It has been named by the [[British Film Institute]] as one of the [[BFI TV 100|100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, by ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper as the third greatest television drama of all time and by the ''[[Radio Times]]'' magazine as one of the 40 greatest television programmes.<ref name=\"tv100\">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321071033/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/prog.php?id=25|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/prog.php?id=25|title=BFI TV 100 \u2013 25: Our Friends in the North|first=Phil|last=Wickham|date=2000|accessdate=31 August 2013|archivedate=21 March 2012|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]}}</ref><ref name=\"guardgreatest\"/><ref name=\"rt1\"/> It was awarded three [[British Academy Television Awards]] (BAFTAs), two [[Royal Television Society]] Awards, four [[Broadcasting Press Guild]] Awards and a Certificate of Merit from the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"awards\"/>\n\n''Our Friends in the North'' helped to establish the careers of its four lead actors, [[Daniel Craig]], [[Christopher Eccleston]], [[Gina McKee]] and [[Mark Strong]]. Daniel Craig's part in particular has been referred to as his [[breakthrough role]].<ref name=\"friend\"/><ref name=\"guard2010\"/> It was also a controversial production, as its stories were partly based on real people and events. Several years passed before it was adapted from a play, performed by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], to a television drama, due in part to the BBC's fear of legal action.\n\n==Plot==\n\n{{See also|List of Our Friends in the North episodes}}\n\n[[File:Christopher Eccleston Thor 2 cropped.png|thumb|[[Christopher Eccleston]] (pictured in 2013) played Dominic 'Nicky' Hutchinson in ''Our Friends in the North'', earning a [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA]] nomination for his performance.]]\n\nIn 1964, 20 year-old university student Nicky Hutchinson ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) returns to Newcastle after volunteering for the summer in the [[U.S. civil rights movement]]. His friends Geordie ([[Daniel Craig]]) and Tosker ([[Mark Strong]]) want to start a band but Nicky rebuffs them as he is occupied with his volunteering work. Nicky's girlfriend Mary ([[Gina McKee]]) is also unhappy with his lack of attention and they drift apart. Tosker takes advantage of the situation and successfully woos Mary, getting her pregnant. Nicky is offered a job working for Austin Donohue ([[Alun Armstrong]]), a former council leader who is starting a PR and lobbying firm. Nicky is impressed by Austin's apparent passion for change and he drops out of university to accept the job, to the dismay of his working-class father, Felix ([[Peter Vaughan]]). Geordie gets into a fight with his abusive, alcoholic father and runs away from home, abandoning his pregnant fiancee.\n\nNow living in London, Geordie accepts a job offer from sleazy crime boss Benny Barrett ([[Malcolm McDowell]]) and begins working as his assistant in the Soho sex industry. Meanwhile, Mary and Tosker struggle to adapt to their new married life. Their high-rise [[council flat]], despite being brand new, is plagued by structural issues including rampant [[damp]]. Nicky is dismayed that Austin's firm is representing John Edwards, the owner of the company responsible for the sub-standard flats. After discovering records of the extensive bribery that took place in the project's development, Nicky quits in protest. Austin later receives 4 years in prison for his involvement and Edwards is declared bankrupt. Tosker's dreams of becoming a professional singer rapidly fade after a brutal audition with a local talent scout. Dejected, he continues to work menial jobs to make ends meet. After visiting Geordie in London, he is given a business loan from Benny and starts his own fruit and vegetable business. Around this time, Geordie starts an affair with Benny's girlfriend Julia.\n\nWorking as a photo journalist in London, Nicky's ideologies become extreme to the point he joins an [[Propaganda of the deed|anarchist terrorist]] cell. While laying-low in Newcastle, he is confronted by his parents and family friend Eddie Wells ([[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]]) after his mother Florrie ([[Freda Dowie]]) finds a gun in his room. However his anarchist activities are brought to a sudden halt when the cell's hideout is raided by the police and everyone but Nicky is arrested. Later, Eddie asks for Felix's help in his campaign to run as an independent Labour candidate in an upcoming [[by-election]], Felix eventually agreeing. Nicky also offers his support, but Eddie refuses due to Nicky's past ties to extremism. Despite turning down Nicky's help, Eddie narrowly wins the seat. Nicky eventually returns to mainstream politics in Newcastle and becomes a Labour parliamentary candidate himself. However despite running in a safe constituency and receiving an endorsement from Eddie, he manages to hand the seat to the Conservatives after a [[smear campaign]] depicts him as a terrorist sympathiser.\n\nThe situation gets progressively more difficult for Benny's businesses as continued pressure from the [[Metropolitan Police]] Commissioner Colin Blamire ([[Peter Jeffrey]]) forces the heavily corrupt vice (\"dirty\") squad to reluctantly act. Meanwhile, tired of being repeatedly blackmailed by the dirty squad, one of Benny's men takes evidence of Met corruption to the Sunday papers and the resulting scandal forces the government to hold an independent inquiry. Roy Johnson ([[Tony Haygarth]]) is brought in from Newcastle as an outsider to run the investigation but is obstructed at every turn by Blamire, dirty squad Commander Harry Chapple ([[Donald Sumpter]]) and his henchman John Salway ([[David Schofield (actor)|David Schofield]]). Blamire is able to use a separate investigation into the Home Secretary's past business dealings to blackmail him into supressing the inquiry findings. A disheartened Johnson returns to Newcastle to take early retirement. With the inquiry behind them, Benny and the dirty squad are free to reach a new lucrative arrangement. Benny then has Geordie framed and imprisoned in revenge for the affair with Julia years before. Subsequent police investigations eventually bring down Chapple, Salway and many others.\n\nSome years later, Tosker is now a moderately successful businessman and Mary is occupied with her advocacy work. After Tosker's repeated infidelity, their marriage irrevocable breaks down and he moves out to live with his new girlfriend, Elaine ([[Tracey Wilkinson]]). Nicky and Mary briefly meet, but she is hesitant to resume their relationship out of concern for her young children. Out of prison and back living in Newcastle, Geordie is devastated to learn that Julia has been killed in an apparent accident. He questions Benny over the death, but accepts Benny's argument that he had no motive. Geordie is soon in trouble with the law again and flees to London for a second time.\n\nIn 1984, Nicky is covering the ongoing [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|miners' strike]]. After being injured in a scuffle between the police and the miners, he rekindles his relationship with Mary. Tosker meanwhile has made his fortune as a [[slum landlord]], straining his marriage with Elaine. At her urging, he sells the properties and invests heavily in stocks, which are wiped out in a later [[Black Monday (1987)|market crash]]. 3 years later, Nicky is struggling with his marriage to Mary and also with his father Felix who has been diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. In London, he picks a fight with Eddie Wells and starts an affair with a young student, Alice. He eventually leaves Mary but by this point Alice has already moved on. Geordie, who is now an alcoholic and living at a homeless shelter, sets fire to his bed in a moment of madness. Quickly apprehended, he is deemed a danger to society and sentenced to life in prison. Nicky reconciles with Eddie after he discovers Eddie's assistant is an undercover mole for a PR company. Eddie resigns in embarrassment but dies of a heart attack as he is leaving Westminster. In Newcastle, Mary initially refuses to run in the by-election for Eddie's seat but eventually changes her mind and is elected. Exasperated at Felix's increasingly outlandish behaviour, Florrie can no longer cope and Felix is sent to a care home.\n\n7 years later in 1995, Nicky has been living in Italy and returns to Newcastle to attend Florrie's funeral. Tosker and Elaine have slowly rebuilt their business and are on the eve of opening a new [[Tuxedo floating nightclubs|floating nightclub]]. Geordie has escaped from prison and approaches the club looking for work, where he is recognised by Elaine. Although Tosker and Elaine privately do not believe his story that he is out on parole, they take him in and give him a job playing keyboard for the opening night band. Nicky desperately tries to convince Felix that his life was [[Jarrow March|not a failure]], but Felix's mind is too far gone to understand. Geordie tries to attend the club launch event but is refused entry due to a miscommunication with the bouncers. Tosker fills in for the band at the last minute and finally achieves his dream of stardom, albeit on a small scale. The four friends finally reunite at Florrie's funeral. Afterwards, Tosker spends time with his grandchildren, Nicky decides to try and patch things up with Mary, and Geordie walks off to an unknown fate.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christopher Eccleston]] as Nicky Hutchinson\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Terry \"Tosker\" Cox\n* [[Gina McKee]] as Mary Cox\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as Geordie Peacock\n* [[Peter Vaughan]] as Felix Hutchinson\n* [[Freda Dowie]] as Florrie Hutchinson\n* [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] as Eddie Wells\n* [[Tracey Wilkinson]] as Elaine Cox\n* [[Alun Armstrong]] as Austin Donohue\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as Benny Barratt\n* [[Donald Sumpter]] as Harold Chapple\n* [[David Schofield (actor)|David Schofield]] as John Salway\n* [[Peter Jeffrey]] as Commissioner Blamire\n* [[Tony Haygarth]] as Roy Johnson\n\n==Background==\n\n===Stage play===\n[[File:Northumberland St. Ncle 1969.jpg|thumb|[[Northumberland Street]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], pictured in 1969, before it was pedestrianised.

There are tall buildings on either side of the street, and various 1960s cars and buses on the road.]]\n\n''Our Friends in the North'' was originally written by the playwright [[Peter Flannery]] for the [[theatre]], while he was a [[Artist-in-residence|writer in residence]] for the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] (RSC).<ref name=\"bfi2\">Eaton, p. 2</ref> The idea came to Flannery while he was watching the rehearsals for the company's production of ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 2|Part 2]]'' at [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] in 1980; the scale of the plays inspired him to come up with his own historical epic.<ref name=\"bfi2\"/> The original three-hour long theatre version of ''Our Friends in the North'', directed by [[John Caird (director)|John Caird]] and featuring [[Jim Broadbent]] and [[Roger Allam]] among the cast, was produced by the RSC in 1982. It initially ran for a week at [[The Other Place (theatre)|The Other Place]] in Stratford before touring to the city in which it was set, [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], and then playing at The Pit, a [[studio theatre]] in the [[Barbican Centre]] in London.<ref>Eaton, p. 8</ref> In its original form, the story went up only to the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] and the coming to power of the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government under [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref>Eaton, p. 121</ref> The play also contained a significant number of scenes set in [[Rhodesia]], chronicling [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|UDI]], the oil embargo and the emergence of armed resistance to white supremacy.<ref>Eaton, p. 6</ref> This plot strand was dropped from the televised version, although the title ''Our Friends in the North'', a reference to how staff at [[BP]] in [[South Africa]] referred to the Rhodesian government of [[Ian Smith]], remained.<ref>Eaton, p. 7</ref>\n\nFlannery was heavily influenced not only by his own political viewpoints and life experiences, but also by the actual history of his home city of Newcastle during the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=\"bfi45\">Eaton, pp. 4\u20135</ref> Characters such as Austin Donohue and John Edwards were directly based on the real-life scandals of [[T.

Flannery contacted Smith and explained that he was going to write a play based on the events of the scandal, to which Smith replied, \"There is a play here of Shakespearean proportions.\"<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Flannery, Peter |year=2002 |title=Retrospective: An Interview with the Creators of the Series |medium=DVD | publisher=BMG |id=BMG DVD 74321}}</ref>\n\n===1980s attempts at production===\nThe stage version of ''Our Friends in the North'' was seen by [[BBC television drama]] producer [[Michael Wearing]] in Newcastle in 1982, and he was immediately keen on producing a television adaptation.<ref>Eaton, p. 9</ref> At that time, Wearing was based at the [[BBC English Regions]] Drama Department at [[Pebble Mill Studios|BBC Pebble Mill]] in Birmingham, which had a specific remit for making \"regional drama\".<ref>Eaton, p. 12</ref> Wearing initially approached Flannery to adapt his play into a four-part television serial for [[BBC Two||BBC2]], with each episode being 50 minutes long and the Rhodesian strand dropped for practical reasons.<ref name=\"born357\">Born, p. 357</ref><ref>Eaton, p. 13</ref> A change of executives meant that the project was not produced, although Wearing persisted in trying to get it commissioned. Flannery extended the serial to six episodes,<ref name=\"born357\"/> one for each [[United Kingdom general election]] from 1964 to 1979.<ref>Eaton, p. 14</ref> However, by this point in the mid-1980s, [[Michael Grade]] was Director of Programmes for BBC Television, and he had no interest in the project.<ref name=\"born358\">Born, p. 358</ref>\n\nBy 1989, Wearing had been recalled to the central BBC drama department in [[London]] where he was made Head of Serials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1363520/index.html|title=Wearing, Michael (1989\u2013)|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|first=Lez|last=Cooke|accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref> This new seniority eventually allowed him to further the cause of ''Our Friends in the North''. Flannery wrote to the BBC's then Managing Director of Television, [[Will Wyatt]], \"accusing him of cowardice for not approving it.\"<ref name=\"brooks\">{{cite news|title=Friends come in from the BBC cold|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 January 1996|page=7|first=Richard|last=Brooks}}</ref> The BBC was concerned not only with the budget and resources that would be required to produce the serial, but also with potential legal issues. Much of the background story was based on real-life events and people, such as Smith and Poulson and former [[Home Secretary]] [[Reginald Maudling]], upon whom another character, Claud Seabrook, was based.<ref>Eaton, p. 65</ref> According to ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper, one senior BBC lawyer, Glen Del Medico, even threatened to resign if the production was made.

This was introduced in later episodes of the television version, but had not been part of the original play.<ref name=\"bfi30\"/> Other storyline and character changes were made with the new version of the first episode because it was the script that had most closely resembled the original stage play.

Reviewing the first episode in ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper, Ian Bell wrote: \"Flannery's script is faultless; funny, chilling, evocative, spare, linguistically precise. The four young friends about to share 31 hellish years in the life of modern Britain are excellently played.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=A Brief History of Tyne|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=21 January 1996|page=18|first=Ian|last=Bell}}</ref>\n\nThe conclusion of the serial in March brought similar praise. \"''Our Friends in the North'' confounded the gloomier predictions about its content and proved that there was an audience for political material, provided that it found its way to the screen through lives imagined in emotional detail&nbsp;... It will be remembered for an intimate sense of character, powerful enough to make you forgive its faults and stay loyal to the end,\"<ref name=\"sutcliffe\"/> was the verdict of ''[[The Independent]]'' on the final episode. Writing in the same newspaper the following day, [[Jeffrey Richards]] added that \"Monday night's final episode of ''Our Friends in the North'' has left many people bereft. The serial captivated much of the country, sketching a panoramic view of life in Britain from the sixties to the nineties&nbsp;... At once sweeping and intimate, both moving and angry, simultaneously historical and contemporary, it has followed in the distinguished footsteps of BBC series such as ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-bbcs-voice-of-two-nations-1341796.html|title=The BBC's voice of two nations|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=13 March 1996|accessdate=2 September 2013|first=Jeffrey|last=Richards|authorlink=Jeffrey Richards|page=15}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the response was not exclusively positive. In ''[[The Independent#The Independent on Sunday|The Independent on Sunday]]'', columnist [[Lucy Ellmann]] criticised both what she saw as the unchanging nature of the characters and Flannery's concentration on friendship rather than family. \"What's in the water there anyway? These are the youngest grandparents ever seen! Nothing has changed about them since ''1964'' except a few grey hairs&nbsp;... It's quite impressive that anything emotional could be salvaged from this nine-part hop, skip and jump through the years.

And of the latter, \"Peter Flannery seems to want to suggest that friendships are the only cure for a life blighted by deficient parents. But all that links this ill-matched foursome in the end is history and sentimentality. The emotional centre of the writing is still in family ties.\"<ref name=\"ellman\"/>\n\nMichael Jackson, the BBC2 controller who had finally commissioned production of the serial, felt that even though it was successful, its [[social realism|social realist]] form was outdated.<ref name=\"born356\">Born, p. 356</ref> The academic [[Georgina Born]], writing in 2004, also felt that although the serial had its strengths, it also contained \"involuntary marks of pastiche\" in its treatment of social realism.<ref name=\"born356\"/>\n\nIn contrast, the [[British Film Institute]]'s [[Screenonline]] website praises the serial for its realistic and un-clich\u00e9d depiction of life in the [[North East England]], stating that: \"Unlike many depictions of the North-East, it has fully rounded characters with authentic regional accents.

The series and several episode scripts were adapted from the \"Dobie Gillis\" short stories written by [[Max Shulman]] since 1945, and first collected in 1951 under the same title as the subsequent TV series. Shulman also wrote a feature film adaptation of his \"Dobie Gillis\" stories for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1953, entitled ''[[The Affairs of Dobie Gillis]]'' which featured [[Bobby Van]] in the title role.\n\n''Dobie Gillis'' is significant as the first American television program produced for a major network to feature teenagers as leading characters. In other series, such as ''[[Father Knows Best]]'' and ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'', teenagers were portrayed as supporting characters in a family story. An even earlier 1954 series, ''[[Meet Corliss Archer (TV series)|Meet Corliss Archer]]'', featured teenagers in leading roles and aired in syndication.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> ''Dobie Gillis'' broke ground by depicting elements of the current  [[counterculture]], particularly the [[Beat Generation]], primarily embodied in a stereotypical version of the \"beatnik\".{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Series star [[Dwayne Hickman]] would later say that ''Dobie'' represented \u201cthe end of innocence of the 1950s before the oncoming 1960s revolution\u201d.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\n==Overview==\n===Dobie Gillis and Maynard G. Krebs===\n[[File:Dobie gillis 1960.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Dobie Gillis (Dwayne Hickman, left), [[Maynard G. Krebs]] (Bob Denver, right) and one of Dobie's \"many loves\", Yvette LeBlanc ([[Danielle De Metz]]), in a still from the ''Dobie Gillis'' episode \"Parlez-Vous English\", originally aired December 27, 1960]]\nThe series revolved around teenager Dobie Gillis (Dwayne Hickman), who aspired to have popularity, money, and the attention of beautiful and unattainable girls. He did not have any of these qualities in abundance, and the tiny crises surrounding Dobie's lack of success made the story in each weekly episode. Also constantly in question, by Dobie and others, was Dobie's future, as the boy proved to be a poor student and an aimless drifter.\n\nHis sidekick and de facto best friend was American television's first [[beatnik]], [[Maynard G. Krebs]] ([[Bob Denver]]), who became the series' [[breakout character]]. An enthusiastic fan of [[jazz music]] (with a strong distaste for the music of [[Lawrence Welk]]), Maynard plays the [[bongo drum|bongos]], collects tinfoil and petrified frogs, and steers clear of romance, authority figures, and work (yelping \"Work?!\" every time he hears the word). Always speaking with the vernacular and slang of the beatniks and jazz musicians he admired, Maynard punctuates his sentences with the word \"[[Like (discourse particle)|like]]\" and has a tendency towards [[malapropism]]s. The main running gag on ''Dobie Gillis'' would have Dobie or one of the other characters rattling off a series of adjectives describing something undesirable or disgusting (\"I'd be a ragged, useless, dirty wreck!\"), at which point a previously unseen Maynard would appear (entering the scene in close-up), saying \"You rang?\"\n\n''Dobie Gillis'' is set in Central City, a fictitious city in the [[Midwestern United States]] (the original short stories are explicitly set in the [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]] area). One of the show's running gags is the reference, especially by Maynard, to a movie called ''The Monster that Devoured Cleveland'' and its sequels, one of which always seems to be playing at the local cinema.\n\n===Supporting characters===\nDobie's often apoplectic father, Herbert T. Gillis ([[Frank Faylen]]), owned a grocery store and was only happy when Dobie was behind a broom. Dobie's mother, Winifred ([[Florida Friebus]]), was a usually calm and serene woman who protected Dobie to the best of her ability and tended to baby him. Herbert Gillis, a proud, hard-working child of the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] veteran, was often (during the first season of the show) heard to declare, in relation to Dobie, \"I gotta kill that boy, I just gotta!\" The Gillis family also originally included an older son, Davey Gillis (portrayed by Dwayne Hickman's own older brother, [[Darryl Hickman]]), who made three appearances during the first season while home on break from college before being written out of the show.<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/>\n\nDobie's two main [[antagonist]]s were rich kids Milton Armitage (played by [[Warren Beatty]]), who appeared in five episodes, and, after Beatty's departure, [[Chatsworth Osborne, Jr.]], Milton's cousin (played by [[Steve Franken]]). Both characters represented the wealth and popularity to which Dobie aspired, but also served as romantic and competitive rivals for Dobie. Beatty's Milton was taller, better looking, and more athletic than Chatsworth. [[Doris Packer]] played Clarissa Osborne, Chatsworth's overbearing and snobbish mother.\n\nDobie was hopelessly attracted to the beautiful but greedy blonde [[Thalia Menninger]] ([[Tuesday Weld]]). Thalia was written out of the series after the first season and was succeeded by a seemingly endless stream of women for whom Dobie hankered. Weld returned as a slightly wiser Thalia for two guest appearances in season 3 and 4.\n\n[[Zelda Gilroy]] ([[Sheila Kuehl|Sheila James]]) was a brilliant and eager young girl, hopelessly in love with Dobie, much to his annoyance. Zelda did not find Dobie particularly attractive, but fell in love with him because she found him helpless and needing of her care, and also because of the concept of \"[[propinquity]]\" (or nearness; as Gillis and Gilroy, they were typically [[Alphabetical_order#Ordering_by_surname|seated together]] in class).<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Despite his protests, Dobie was clearly fond of Zelda, and Zelda claimed Dobie loved her but just had not realized it yet. To prove this, she would wrinkle her nose at Dobie, who would reflexively do the same back to Zelda and then protest \"now cut that out!\" Dobie and Zelda would later appear as a middle-aged married couple in the two spin-off ''Dobie Gillis'' reunion projects of the 1970s/1980s.\n\nLeander Pomfritt ([[Herbert Anderson]] in the pilot, [[William Schallert]] thereafter) was Dobie's English and science teacher at Central High School and later, when Dobie went to S. Peter Pryor Junior College, Pomfritt (played by Schallert) was on the faculty there as well. A stern educator fond of [[deadpan]] quips, Pomfritt referred to his pupils as \"my young barbarians\" and served as a father figure to both Dobie and Maynard.\n\n===Format===\n[[File:Bob Denver Dobie Gillis 1961.jpg|thumb|Maynard was not prepared to give up his beard after entering the army. Bob Denver and Kay Elhardt are featured in this still from the ''Dobie Gillis'' episode \"The Ballad of Maynard's Beard\", originally aired April 18, 1961.]]\nMost of the action for the first season-and-a-half of ''Dobie Gillis'' centered on the Gillis grocery store, Central High School, and the Central City park. The park scenes are used as the show's [[Frame story|framing device]], with Dobie sitting on a park bench in front of a reproduction of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s statue, ''[[The Thinker]]''. Breaking the [[fourth wall]], he would explain to the viewing audience his problem of the week, usually girls or money (in the earliest episodes, Dobie is seen emulating the trademark pose of ''The Thinker'' \u2013 head planted on fist in deep contemplation \u2013 before turning and acknowledging the camera).<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/>\n\nThe teen characters graduated from high school halfway through the second season, and Dobie and Maynard (along with Chatsworth) subsequently did a brief stint in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> Dobie continued to break the fourth wall and narrate the episodes, with the park set eschewed for an abstract set with the same reproduction of \"The Thinker.\"\n\nAt the start of the third season, Dobie and Maynard received their Army discharges and they, Zelda, and Chatsworth enroll in S. Peter Pryor [[junior college|Junior College]], where Mr. Pomfritt was now a professor after having resigned from his position at Central High. Dobie's science and history teacher at the college was Dr. Imogene Burkhart ([[Jean Byron]], whose real name was used for that of the character). In season four, Dobie's teenaged cousin Duncan \"Dunky\" Gillis ([[Bobby Diamond]]) moves in with the Gillises, and becomes something of a tag-along for Dobie and Maynard. The fourth-season episodes tended more towards surreal plots and situations featuring Maynard as the central character rather than Dobie.{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |p=56}}\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n*[[Dwayne Hickman]], as Dobie Gillis, is a clean-cut teenager (later young adult), an unremarkable student whose young heart finds poetry and literature resonant. He aspires to have dates with all of the beautiful girls he pursues, despite the pressures of home life, high school, and later the military and college. Dobie also serves as the series narrator, relating his observations to the audience from in front of a statue of Rodin's ''The Thinker''.\n*[[Frank Faylen]], as Herbert T. Gillis, is Dobie's old-fashioned, short-tempered, and gruff father, who runs a small independent grocery store.\n*[[Florida Friebus]], as Winifred \"Winnie\" Gillis, is Dobie's doting mother, who tends to baby her son and critique her husband's parenting skills.\n*[[Bob Denver]], as [[Maynard G. Krebs]], is Dobie's lazy and somewhat goofy best friend, a would-be beatnik who shuns romance, authority figures, and work. Like Dobie does later, Maynard briefly joins the Army in season two between his high-school graduation and enrollment in college.\n\n===Semiregulars===\n*[[Tuesday Weld]], as Thalia Menninger (season 1), is a beautiful high school classmate of Dobie's who is only willing to date Dobie when he has money or helps her in her schemes to make some for herself (with a father in poor health and a sister who married a layabout, Thalia sees it as her duty to bring some money into the family; she acknowledges that were this not a factor, she would date Dobie).<ref>The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, episode 1- 'Caper at the Bijou'</ref> Weld departed the series after the first season, later returning to make two guest appearances, as a somewhat chastened Thalia, once in season 3 and once in season 4.\n*[[Warren Beatty]], as Milton Armitage (season 1), is a rich jock at Dobie's high school and a rival of Dobie for Thalia's affections. Beatty quit the series midway through the first season.\n*[[Sheila Kuehl|Sheila James]], as [[Zelda Gilroy]], is the smartest girl in Dobie's high school and college, who is in love with the uninterested Dobie and schemes ways to get him to date and marry her.\n*[[Steve Franken]], as [[Chatsworth Osborne, Jr.]], is a spoiled rich boy and a classmate of Dobie's in high school and college. Chatsworth assumed the role left vacant by the departure of Milton from the series. Like Dobie, Chatsworth also briefly joins the Army in season two between his high-school graduation and enrollment in college.\n*[[William Schallert]], as Professor Leander Pomfritt, is a dry wit English and science teacher at Dobie's high school and later one of Dobie's college professors at S. Peter Pryor Junior College (seasons 1, 2 and 3). [[Herbert Anderson]] plays Mr. Pomfritt in the pilot episode.\n*[[Jean Byron]], as Mrs. Ruth Adams, is Dobie's math teacher in high school (season 1) and Dr. Imogene Burkhart, one of Dobie's professors at S. Peter Pryor Junior College. (seasons 3 and 4). One of the series inside jokes was that Jean Byron's birth name was Imogene Audette Burkhart.\n*[[Doris Packer]], as Mrs. Clarice Armitage, is Milton's mother, a rich and eccentric socialite. She shifted to Mrs. Clarissa Osborne ([[Chatsworth Osborne, Jr.]]'s mother) when Franken replaced Beatty midway through season one. She has disdain for anyone outside her social class and considers all boys, including her own son, as \"nasty\".\n\n===Notable recurring roles===\n*[[Darryl Hickman]], as Davey Gillis (season 1), is Dobie's older brother, a college student no more responsible and no less girl-crazy than Dobie. Davey was written out of the series after season one and Dobie is regarded as an only child thereafter.\n*[[Michael J. Pollard]], as Jerome Krebs (season 1), is Maynard's cousin, also a beatnik. Jerome was intended as a replacement for Maynard when Bob Denver was drafted in mid-1959, and was written out of the show after Denver failed his Army physical and returned to the series.\n*[[Marjorie Bennett]], as Blossom Kenney (seasons 1 and 2), is a frequent and persnickety customer of the Gillises' grocery store.\n*[[Tommy Farrell]], as Riff Ryan (seasons 1 and 2), is a beatnik record store owner and coffee house proprietor who serves as something of a reluctant mentor for Maynard.\n*[[Lynn Loring]], as Edwina \"Eddie\" Kegel (season 3), Chatsworth Osborne Jr.'s [[beatnik]] cousin.\n*[[Raymond Bailey]], as Dean McGruder (seasons 3 and 4), is head of S. Peter Pryor Junior College.\n\n==Episodes== \n{{Main|List of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis episodes}}\n{{:List of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis episodes}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Rodin-Denker-Kyoto.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Auguste Rodin]]'s statue of ''[[The Thinker]]'']]\nMax Shulman's first Dobie Gillis short stories were printed in 1945, and a short story compilation, ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'', was published in 1951.<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\" /> These stories were originally published in such magazines as ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.\n\nA follow-up collection, ''I Was a Teen-Age Dwarf'', appeared in 1959. The titular character appeared at various ages in these stories, all of which are set in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], though the majority of the stories centered on his college years at the [[University of Minnesota]].<ref>Shulman, Max.

Following its release, Shulman set about attempting to bring ''Dobie Gillis'' to television. An initial pilot was produced by veteran comedian and producer [[George Burns]] in 1957, with his son [[Ronnie Burns (actor)|Ronnie Burns]] starring as Dobie.<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/>\n\nAfter this pilot did not sell, Shulman took ''Dobie Gillis'' to [[20th Century Fox Television]], run at the time by [[Martin Manulis]]. Manulis asked Shulman to reduce the Dobie character's age from 19 to 17, making him a high-school student instead of a college student and an age peer of [[Ricky Nelson]] from ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'' and [[Wally Cleaver]] ([[Tony Dow]]) from ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]''.<ref name=\"HoneyImHome\">Jones, Gerard (1993).

Krebs, and Tuesday Weld as Dobie's unattainable love interest Thalia Menninger.\n\nFirst pitched to and rejected by NBC, ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' was greenlit for series by CBS. [[Philip Morris USA|Phillip Morris]]' [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] was the program's primary sponsor, and it sold a week-to-week alternating co-sponsorship to [[Pillsbury Company]] for the first two seasons, with Dwayne Hickman appearing in one of the Pillsbury commercials.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> [[Colgate-Palmolive]] replaced Pillsbury as the alternate sponsor in season three.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/>\n\nWhile the pilot for ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' was shot at the main [[20th Century Fox]] lot in [[Century City, California]], principal photography and production for the series proper took place at the original Fox Film Corporation studio at the intersection of [[Sunset Boulevard]] and [[Western Avenue (Los Angeles)|Western Avenue]] (next to the headquarters of [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group Inc.|DeLuxe]]) in [[Hollywood]].<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> ''Dobie Gillis'' was [[multi-camera setup|filmed with two cameras]], a method that producer and director [[Rod Amateau]] had learned while working on ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]''. Fox turned out one episode of ''Dobie Gillis'' a week, working from May to December of each year. Dwayne Hickman's fourth-wall-breaking monologues were saved for the end of the production of each episode; their length resulted in Hickman requesting and getting a [[teleprompter]] from which to read them for season two forward.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\nThe show was not filmed before a [[live studio audience]]; during the first season, a live audience viewed each episode and provided its [[laugh track]].<ref name=\"tweedle20100610\">{{cite interview|title=Hollywood Everyman: A Conversation with William Schallert|date=June 10, 2010|accessdate=December 12, 2011|url=http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/williamschallerti|last=Schallert|first=William|subjectlink=William Schallert|interviewer=Tweedle, Sam|work=Confessions of a Pop Culture Addict|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117134300/http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/williamschallerti/|archivedate=January 17, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Subsequent seasons used a standard laugh track provided by technician [[Charles Douglass]].{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |pp=9\u201321}}\n\nCreator Max Shulman served as the show runner for and an uncredited producer of ''Dobie Gillis''.<ref name=\"STUEP5\">{{cite web |last=Shostak |first=Stu |date=Nov 3, 2010 |url=http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php |title=Program 202 \u2014 Steve Franken |website=The Stu's Show Archives |access-date=Sep 9, 2013}}</ref> He contributed scripts for episodes of the show during all four seasons, with several stories \u2013 including \"Love is a Science\" (season 1, episode 3), \"Love is a Fallacy\" (season 1, episode 22), and \"Parlez-Vous English\" (season 2, episode 11) \u2013 directly adapted by Shulman from his original Dobie Gillis short stories.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/><ref name=\"STUEP5\"/>\n\nDuring its fourth season, the show, by then known as ''Max Shulman's Dobie Gillis'', suffered both from competition with NBC's color Western ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' and from the growing inattention from Max Shulman.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Shulman began spending increasing amounts of time at his home in [[Westport, Connecticut]] while the show was in active production,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}<ref name=\"STUEP5\"/> ceding his role as show runner to associate producers Joel Kane and Guy Scarpitta.

Despite being cast as a 17-year-old, Hickman was 24 when he starred in the pilot in the summer of 1958. Because Hickman had appeared for several years on ''Bob Cummings'' as Chuck, he was required by Shulman and CBS to bleach his dark brown hair blond for the role of Dobie to distance himself from that character in the public's (and the sponsors') minds.<ref>Roger Miller, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4207/is_19950112/ai_n10180818/print \"Baby Boomers still follow the pop icons of their era\"], ''Milwaukee Journal''; accessed February 7, 2016.</ref> By the second season, however, Hickman was permitted to return to his natural hair color, after he had complained to the producers that the constant bleaching required to keep his low [[crew cut]] hairstyle blond was causing his scalp to break out.<ref name=\"STUEP4\">{{cite web |last=Shostak |first=Stu |date=Feb 21, 2007 |url=http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php |title=Program 12 \u2014 Dwayne Hickman and Joan Roberts Hickman |website=The Stu's Show Archives |access-date=Aug 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBob Denver, a 23-year-old grade-school teacher and postal worker with no previous professional acting experience, won the part of 18-year-old Maynard G. Krebs after his sister, a casting director's secretary, added his name to a list of candidates auditioning for the role.<ref name=\"STUEP7\"/> Denver and Hickman had both attended [[Loyola Marymount University|Loyola University]] together several years earlier and were casually acquainted before ''Dobie Gillis''.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} After filming the third episode of ''Dobie Gillis'', Denver announced that he had received his [[Conscription|draft notice]]. The character of Maynard enlisted in the Army and was given an elaborate sendoff in the show's next episode, \"Maynard's Farewell to the Troops\". Stage actor [[Michael J. Pollard]] was brought out from New York to play Maynard's cousin, Jerome Krebs, who was introduced at the end of \"Maynard's Farewell to the Troops\" and was to assume Maynard's role in future scripts.<ref name=\"STUEP7\">{{cite web |last=Shostak |first=Stu |url=http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php |title=Program 137 \u2014 Remembering Bob Denver with guests Dreama Denver, Dwayne Hickman, Joan Roberts Hickman, and Bill Funt |website=The Stu's Show Archives |date=Aug 12, 2009 |access-date=Dec 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBefore Pollard had completed his first episode, \"The Sweet Singer of Central High\", however, Denver returned and announced that he had been designated \"[[4F (military conscription)|4F]]\" \u2013 unfit for service \u2013 during his physical because of a neck injury he had sustained some years earlier.<ref name=\"STUEP7\"/> After completing \"The Sweet Singer of Central High\", Pollard was bought out of his contract \u2013 he had signed a \"[[Guarantee (filmmaking)|play-or-pay]]\" contract and was paid for all 30 episodes in which he was to have appeared, and Denver was rehired. Maynard's return was explained by stating that the Army had given Maynard a \"hardship discharge\" \u2013 the Army's hardship, not Maynard's.<ref name=\"STUEP7\"/><ref>[http://www.peteranthonyholder.com/cjad27.htm CJAD 800 AM, Montreal radio interview with Bob Denver], peteranthonyholder.com; accessed February 7, 2016.</ref>\n\nInitially, only a supporting character, Denver's Maynard had graduated to co-lead by season two, as the character's \"beatnik\" mannerisms and eccentricities made him a hit with the viewing audience.<ref name=\"STUEP7\"/> For a handful of episodes towards the end of season three, Maynard became the show's lead character while Dwayne Hickman was hospitalized with and later recovering from [[pneumonia]].{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} \n\nDespite Maynard's rise in popularity and increased screen time, however, Denver \u2013 who had signed on as a Fox contract player without an agent \u2013 was unable to negotiate a raise in his $250/week salary until season four.{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |pp=9\u201321}}<ref name=\"STUEP7\"/> Denver was able to parlay his role on ''Dobie Gillis'' into lead roles on later television series, in particular the one for which he is best remembered, the 1964\u201367 CBS sitcom ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''.<ref name=\"STUEP7\"/>\n\nVeteran actors Frank Faylen, a longtime acquaintance of the Hickman family and a fellow parishioner at their church,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} and Florida Friebus were cast as Dobie's parents, Herbert T. Gillis and Winifred Gillis. Faylen's gruff, no-nonsense father character \u2013 which, according to Hickman, was essentially the same as Faylen's real-life personality{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} \u2013 was more of an antagonist to Dobie during the first season of the show, his demeanor underscored by his often-repeated catchphrase \"I gotta kill that boy! I just gotta!\" Both CBS and Marlboro strongly disapproved of the catchphrase and the Herbert T. Gillis character's hard edges.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} An early season-two episode, \"You Ain't Nothin' But a Houn' Dog\" (episode 2), in which Dobie inadvertently wins a father-and-son essay contest, was produced to explain why Herbert ceased use of his catchphrase. Herbert was further softened as the series bore on, the character's anger tempered to frustration.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Recurring casting notes===\nExperienced child actress Tuesday Weld was cast as Dobie's love interest in \"Caper at the Bijou\" and stayed on as a semiregular. Weld and Dwayne Hickman had previously appeared as a teenage couple in the 1958 Fox feature film ''[[Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys!]]'', based on a Max Shulman novel, though produced without his input.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Neither Hickman nor Weld was fond of the other, with Hickman later stating he felt Weld was not as dedicated as necessary to rehearsal and referring to her as \"a pain in the neck\". Weld reportedly found Hickman pushy and out-of-touch. Aged 15 at the time of shooting the pilot, Weld had to legally spend much of her time onset in school with a tutor,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} and the production periodically ran into issues involving Weld's later publicly known difficult home life.<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\">{{Cite video |title=Interview with Sheila James Kuehl |medium=Video |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation]] |date=2013 |url=http://emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/sheila-kuehl}}</ref> \n\nHer work in ''Dobie Gillis'' and the feature film ''[[The Five Pennies]]'' made Weld a star, leading to substantial publicity.{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |pp=9\u201321}} She departed the series after the first year to star in features, although she was persuaded by Max Shulman to return for two guest appearances, \"Birth of a Salesman\" (season 3, episode 21) and \"What's a Little Murder Between Friends?\" (season 4, episode 2).{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\nHerbert Anderson was cast as Mr. Pomfritt, Dobie and Maynard's English teacher at school. Anderson appeared in a lead role in the pilot for ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]''; when that show was picked up (also by CBS), he chose to stay with that cast, and veteran actor William Schallert appeared in the recurring role of Mr. Pomfritt through the end of season three.\n\nWarren Beatty was cast as Milton Armitage, a recurring rival of Dobie's at his high school, during the first half of season one.<ref name=\"Beatty\"/> Hickman later recalled that Beatty \"looked at me like I was a bug\" while on set.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Beatty did remain friends with his brief co-star [[Michael J. Pollard]]. The two co-starred in ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' eight years later. He quit the series in September 1959, midway through production of the first season after filming his fifth and final ''Dobie'' episode, \"The Smoke-Filled Room\", to appear in ''A Loss of Roses'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].<ref name=\"Beatty\">Finstead, Susan (2008). ''Warren Beatty: A Private Man''. New York: Random House LLC, pp. 190\u2013220<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nVeteran child actress Sheila James, who, playing daughter \"Jackie\" on ''[[The Stu Erwin Show]]'', had worked with Dwayne Hickman on that series and ''The Bob Cummings Show'', was cast without an audition as Zelda Gilroy, the tomboyish brainy girl who was in love with Dobie.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Originally intended as a one-shot character for the episode \"Love is a Science\" (season 1, episode 3), Max Shulman liked both Zelda and Sheila James and had Zelda retained as a semi-regular character. Signing a contract with ''Dobie Gillis'' necessitated James, then an eighteen-year-old college student, changing her major from theater to English, so Shulman could assist her with her studies on set.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/>\n\nAfter the third season of ''Dobie Gillis'', Rod Amateau and Max Shulman produced a pilot for a ''Zelda'' spinoff starring Sheila James as Zelda Gilroy, with [[Joe Flynn (US actor)|Joe Flynn]] and Jean Byron cast as her parents.<ref name=\"STUEP3\">{{cite web |last=Shostak |first=Stu |date=July 17, 2013 |url=http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php?y=2013 |title=Program 331 \u2014 Sheila James Kuehl |website=The Stu's Show Archives |access-date=July 25, 2013}}</ref> However, CBS president [[James Aubrey]] lingered over moving forward with the ''Zelda'' series for a long time before firmly rejecting the series, with Amateau telling James in private that Aubrey had found ''Zelda'' (and by extension James, then a closeted lesbian) \"too butch\".<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\"/> James' contract for the pilot and the resulting waiting period caused her to be absent from much of the fourth and final season of ''Dobie Gillis'', though Amateau was able to hire her to return as Zelda for four episodes towards the end of the season.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Acting roles became sparse for James by the late 1960s; she went into law and politics under her birth name of Sheila Kuehl and later became the first openly gay person elected to the [[California State Legislature]].<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\"/>\n\nSteve Franken, a 28-year-old veteran character actor, was cast immediately after Beatty's departure as Chatsworth Osbourne, Jr, a replacement character for Milton Armitage. While both Milton and Chatsworth were rich rivals of Dobie Gillis (and both characters shared the same actress, [[Doris Packer]], for a mother) and were, according to canon, cousins, where Beatty's Milton was a menacing and athletic physical threat, Franken's pompous, foppish Chatsworth tended to plot and scheme his way through competitions with Dobie, more often than not using his riches to get ahead.<ref name=\"STUEP5\"/> The Chatsworth character became popular enough that the producers had to consciously limit his appearances on the series to roughly one per month to prevent Franken from upstaging Hickman and Denver, but Franken stated both during and after ''Dobie Gillis'' that playing Chatsworth led him to be typecast and stifled his career.<ref name=\"STUEP5\"/>\n\nYoung actor Bobby Diamond was brought on at the beginning of season four as Dobie's teenaged cousin, Duncan \"Dunky\" Gillis. By 1962, the 28-year-old Dwayne Hickman had begun to look too mature to carry the teenager-based plot lines,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} and instead Diamond's \"Dunky\" was given this material, with the older yet immature Maynard as a running partner. The character was dropped midway through the fourth season, with attention shifting back to the characters of Dobie, Maynard, Chatsworth, and Zelda for the remaining episodes of the series.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\nActresses who played Dobie's love interests included [[Cheryl Holdridge]], [[Michele Lee]], [[Susan Watson]], [[Marlo Thomas]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Ellen Burstyn]] (then billed as Ellen McRae), [[Barbara Babcock]], [[Sherry Jackson]] and [[Danielle De Metz]]. [[Yvonne Craig]] appeared in the opening credits and the closing sequence of the pilot film used to sell the series to CBS but did not appear in the actual episode, \"Caper at The Bijou\", when it was broadcast. She would eventually play five different girlfriends on the show, more than any other actress.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Other media==\nAfter the first season of ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' had aired, [[Capitol Records]] attempted to make a recording star out of Dwayne Hickman, ignoring the fact that Hickman, by his own admission, was not a singer.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Recording engineers had to piece together numerous takes to get a usable vocal track from Hickman for each song. Hickman introduced several of the songs from the ''Dobie!'' album on the show during its second season, including \"I'm a Lover, Not a Fighter\" and \"Don't Send a Rabbit\".{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Earlier, while Hickman was appearing on ''[[Love That Bob]]'', he had recorded a single, \"School Dance\", for [[ABC-Paramount Records]], but both the single and the later Capitol album sold very few copies.<ref>[http://www.famousinterview.ca/interviews/dwayne_hickman.htm Dwayne Hickman interview], famousinterview.ca; accessed February 7, 2016.</ref>\n\n[[DC Comics]] published a ''Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' comic book that ran for 26 issues from 1960 to 1964, featuring artwork by [[Bob Oksner]].

Cherry after Dwayne Hickman, who was the film's producer, was forced by the network to fire Max Shulman and Rod Amateau, with whom he had originally conceived the film.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/><ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> The plot features the married Dobie and Zelda running the Gillis Grocery \u2013 now also a pharmacy \u2013 on their own, Dobie's parents having died.

The series and several episode scripts were adapted from the \"Dobie Gillis\" short stories written by [[Max Shulman]] since 1945, and first collected in 1951 under the same title as the subsequent TV series. Shulman also wrote a feature film adaptation of his \"Dobie Gillis\" stories for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1953, entitled ''[[The Affairs of Dobie Gillis]]'' which featured [[Bobby Van]] in the title role.\n\n''Dobie Gillis'' is significant as the first American television program produced for a major network to feature teenagers as leading characters. In other series, such as ''[[Father Knows Best]]'' and ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'', teenagers were portrayed as supporting characters in a family story. An even earlier 1954 series, ''[[Meet Corliss Archer (TV series)|Meet Corliss Archer]]'', featured teenagers in leading roles and aired in syndication.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> ''Dobie Gillis'' broke ground by depicting elements of the current  [[counterculture]], particularly the [[Beat Generation]], primarily embodied in a stereotypical version of the \"beatnik\".{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Series star [[Dwayne Hickman]] would later say that ''Dobie'' represented \u201cthe end of innocence of the 1950s before the oncoming 1960s revolution\u201d.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\n==Overview==\n===Dobie Gillis and Maynard G. Krebs===\n[[File:Dobie gillis 1960.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Dobie Gillis (Dwayne Hickman, left), [[Maynard G. Krebs]] (Bob Denver, right) and one of Dobie's \"many loves\", Yvette LeBlanc ([[Danielle De Metz]]), in a still from the ''Dobie Gillis'' episode \"Parlez-Vous English\", originally aired December 27, 1960]]\nThe series revolved around teenager Dobie Gillis (Dwayne Hickman), who aspired to have popularity, money, and the attention of beautiful and unattainable girls. He did not have any of these qualities in abundance, and the tiny crises surrounding Dobie's lack of success made the story in each weekly episode. Also constantly in question, by Dobie and others, was Dobie's future, as the boy proved to be a poor student and an aimless drifter.\n\nHis sidekick and de facto best friend was American television's first [[beatnik]], [[Maynard G. Krebs]] ([[Bob Denver]]), who became the series' [[breakout character]]. An enthusiastic fan of [[jazz music]] (with a strong distaste for the music of [[Lawrence Welk]]), Maynard plays the [[bongo drum|bongos]], collects tinfoil and petrified frogs, and steers clear of romance, authority figures, and work (yelping \"Work?!\" every time he hears the word). Always speaking with the vernacular and slang of the beatniks and jazz musicians he admired, Maynard punctuates his sentences with the word \"[[Like (discourse particle)|like]]\" and has a tendency towards [[malapropism]]s. The main running gag on ''Dobie Gillis'' would have Dobie or one of the other characters rattling off a series of adjectives describing something undesirable or disgusting (\"I'd be a ragged, useless, dirty wreck!\"), at which point a previously unseen Maynard would appear (entering the scene in close-up), saying \"You rang?\"\n\n''Dobie Gillis'' is set in Central City, a fictitious city in the [[Midwestern United States]] (the original short stories are explicitly set in the [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]] area). One of the show's running gags is the reference, especially by Maynard, to a movie called ''The Monster that Devoured Cleveland'' and its sequels, one of which always seems to be playing at the local cinema.\n\n===Supporting characters===\nDobie's often apoplectic father, Herbert T. Gillis ([[Frank Faylen]]), owned a grocery store and was only happy when Dobie was behind a broom. Dobie's mother, Winifred ([[Florida Friebus]]), was a usually calm and serene woman who protected Dobie to the best of her ability and tended to baby him. Herbert Gillis, a proud, hard-working child of the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] veteran, was often (during the first season of the show) heard to declare, in relation to Dobie, \"I gotta kill that boy, I just gotta!\" The Gillis family also originally included an older son, Davey Gillis (portrayed by Dwayne Hickman's own older brother, [[Darryl Hickman]]), who made three appearances during the first season while home on break from college before being written out of the show.<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/>\n\nDobie's two main [[antagonist]]s were rich kids Milton Armitage (played by [[Warren Beatty]]), who appeared in five episodes, and, after Beatty's departure, [[Chatsworth Osborne, Jr.]], Milton's cousin (played by [[Steve Franken]]). Both characters represented the wealth and popularity to which Dobie aspired, but also served as romantic and competitive rivals for Dobie. Beatty's Milton was taller, better looking, and more athletic than Chatsworth. [[Doris Packer]] played Clarissa Osborne, Chatsworth's overbearing and snobbish mother.\n\nDobie was hopelessly attracted to the beautiful but greedy blonde [[Thalia Menninger]] ([[Tuesday Weld]]). Thalia was written out of the series after the first season and was succeeded by a seemingly endless stream of women for whom Dobie hankered. Weld returned as a slightly wiser Thalia for two guest appearances in season 3 and 4.\n\n[[Zelda Gilroy]] ([[Sheila Kuehl|Sheila James]]) was a brilliant and eager young girl, hopelessly in love with Dobie, much to his annoyance. Zelda did not find Dobie particularly attractive, but fell in love with him because she found him helpless and needing of her care, and also because of the concept of \"[[propinquity]]\" (or nearness; as Gillis and Gilroy, they were typically [[Alphabetical_order#Ordering_by_surname|seated together]] in class).<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Despite his protests, Dobie was clearly fond of Zelda, and Zelda claimed Dobie loved her but just had not realized it yet. To prove this, she would wrinkle her nose at Dobie, who would reflexively do the same back to Zelda and then protest \"now cut that out!\" Dobie and Zelda would later appear as a middle-aged married couple in the two spin-off ''Dobie Gillis'' reunion projects of the 1970s/1980s.\n\nLeander Pomfritt ([[Herbert Anderson]] in the pilot, [[William Schallert]] thereafter) was Dobie's English and science teacher at Central High School and later, when Dobie went to S. Peter Pryor Junior College, Pomfritt (played by Schallert) was on the faculty there as well. A stern educator fond of [[deadpan]] quips, Pomfritt referred to his pupils as \"my young barbarians\" and served as a father figure to both Dobie and Maynard.\n\n===Format===\n[[File:Bob Denver Dobie Gillis 1961.jpg|thumb|Maynard was not prepared to give up his beard after entering the army. Bob Denver and Kay Elhardt are featured in this still from the ''Dobie Gillis'' episode \"The Ballad of Maynard's Beard\", originally aired April 18, 1961.]]\nMost of the action for the first season-and-a-half of ''Dobie Gillis'' centered on the Gillis grocery store, Central High School, and the Central City park. The park scenes are used as the show's [[Frame story|framing device]], with Dobie sitting on a park bench in front of a reproduction of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s statue, ''[[The Thinker]]''. Breaking the [[fourth wall]], he would explain to the viewing audience his problem of the week, usually girls or money (in the earliest episodes, Dobie is seen emulating the trademark pose of ''The Thinker'' \u2013 head planted on fist in deep contemplation \u2013 before turning and acknowledging the camera).<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/>\n\nThe teen characters graduated from high school halfway through the second season, and Dobie and Maynard (along with Chatsworth) subsequently did a brief stint in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> Dobie continued to break the fourth wall and narrate the episodes, with the park set eschewed for an abstract set with the same reproduction of \"The Thinker.\"\n\nAt the start of the third season, Dobie and Maynard received their Army discharges and they, Zelda, and Chatsworth enroll in S. Peter Pryor [[junior college|Junior College]], where Mr. Pomfritt was now a professor after having resigned from his position at Central High. Dobie's science and history teacher at the college was Dr. Imogene Burkhart ([[Jean Byron]], whose real name was used for that of the character). In season four, Dobie's teenaged cousin Duncan \"Dunky\" Gillis ([[Bobby Diamond]]) moves in with the Gillises, and becomes something of a tag-along for Dobie and Maynard. The fourth-season episodes tended more towards surreal plots and situations featuring Maynard as the central character rather than Dobie.{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |p=56}}\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n*[[Dwayne Hickman]], as Dobie Gillis, is a clean-cut teenager (later young adult), an unremarkable student whose young heart finds poetry and literature resonant. He aspires to have dates with all of the beautiful girls he pursues, despite the pressures of home life, high school, and later the military and college. Dobie also serves as the series narrator, relating his observations to the audience from in front of a statue of Rodin's ''The Thinker''.\n*[[Frank Faylen]], as Herbert T. Gillis, is Dobie's old-fashioned, short-tempered, and gruff father, who runs a small independent grocery store.\n*[[Florida Friebus]], as Winifred \"Winnie\" Gillis, is Dobie's doting mother, who tends to baby her son and critique her husband's parenting skills.\n*[[Bob Denver]], as [[Maynard G. Krebs]], is Dobie's lazy and somewhat goofy best friend, a would-be beatnik who shuns romance, authority figures, and work. Like Dobie does later, Maynard briefly joins the Army in season two between his high-school graduation and enrollment in college.\n\n===Semiregulars===\n*[[Tuesday Weld]], as Thalia Menninger (season 1), is a beautiful high school classmate of Dobie's who is only willing to date Dobie when he has money or helps her in her schemes to make some for herself (with a father in poor health and a sister who married a layabout, Thalia sees it as her duty to bring some money into the family; she acknowledges that were this not a factor, she would date Dobie).<ref>The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, episode 1- 'Caper at the Bijou'</ref> Weld departed the series after the first season, later returning to make two guest appearances, as a somewhat chastened Thalia, once in season 3 and once in season 4.\n*[[Warren Beatty]], as Milton Armitage (season 1), is a rich jock at Dobie's high school and a rival of Dobie for Thalia's affections. Beatty quit the series midway through the first season.\n*[[Sheila Kuehl|Sheila James]], as [[Zelda Gilroy]], is the smartest girl in Dobie's high school and college, who is in love with the uninterested Dobie and schemes ways to get him to date and marry her.\n*[[Steve Franken]], as [[Chatsworth Osborne, Jr.]], is a spoiled rich boy and a classmate of Dobie's in high school and college. Chatsworth assumed the role left vacant by the departure of Milton from the series. Like Dobie, Chatsworth also briefly joins the Army in season two between his high-school graduation and enrollment in college.\n*[[William Schallert]], as Professor Leander Pomfritt, is a dry wit English and science teacher at Dobie's high school and later one of Dobie's college professors at S. Peter Pryor Junior College (seasons 1, 2 and 3). [[Herbert Anderson]] plays Mr. Pomfritt in the pilot episode.\n*[[Jean Byron]], as Mrs. Ruth Adams, is Dobie's math teacher in high school (season 1) and Dr. Imogene Burkhart, one of Dobie's professors at S. Peter Pryor Junior College. (seasons 3 and 4). One of the series inside jokes was that Jean Byron's birth name was Imogene Audette Burkhart.\n*[[Doris Packer]], as Mrs. Clarice Armitage, is Milton's mother, a rich and eccentric socialite. She shifted to Mrs. Clarissa Osborne ([[Chatsworth Osborne, Jr.]]'s mother) when Franken replaced Beatty midway through season one. She has disdain for anyone outside her social class and considers all boys, including her own son, as \"nasty\".\n\n===Notable recurring roles===\n*[[Darryl Hickman]], as Davey Gillis (season 1), is Dobie's older brother, a college student no more responsible and no less girl-crazy than Dobie. Davey was written out of the series after season one and Dobie is regarded as an only child thereafter.\n*[[Michael J. Pollard]], as Jerome Krebs (season 1), is Maynard's cousin, also a beatnik. Jerome was intended as a replacement for Maynard when Bob Denver was drafted in mid-1959, and was written out of the show after Denver failed his Army physical and returned to the series.\n*[[Marjorie Bennett]], as Blossom Kenney (seasons 1 and 2), is a frequent and persnickety customer of the Gillises' grocery store.\n*[[Tommy Farrell]], as Riff Ryan (seasons 1 and 2), is a beatnik record store owner and coffee house proprietor who serves as something of a reluctant mentor for Maynard.\n*[[Lynn Loring]], as Edwina \"Eddie\" Kegel (season 3), Chatsworth Osborne Jr.'s [[beatnik]] cousin.\n*[[Raymond Bailey]], as Dean McGruder (seasons 3 and 4), is head of S. Peter Pryor Junior College.\n\n==Episodes== \n{{Main|List of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis episodes}}\n{{:List of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis episodes}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Rodin-Denker-Kyoto.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Auguste Rodin]]'s statue of ''[[The Thinker]]'']]\nMax Shulman's first Dobie Gillis short stories were printed in 1945, and a short story compilation, ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'', was published in 1951.<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\" /> These stories were originally published in such magazines as ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.\n\nA follow-up collection, ''I Was a Teen-Age Dwarf'', appeared in 1959.

Following its release, Shulman set about attempting to bring ''Dobie Gillis'' to television. An initial pilot was produced by veteran comedian and producer [[George Burns]] in 1957, with his son [[Ronnie Burns (actor)|Ronnie Burns]] starring as Dobie.<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/>\n\nAfter this pilot did not sell, Shulman took ''Dobie Gillis'' to [[20th Century Fox Television]], run at the time by [[Martin Manulis]]. Manulis asked Shulman to reduce the Dobie character's age from 19 to 17, making him a high-school student instead of a college student and an age peer of [[Ricky Nelson]] from ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'' and [[Wally Cleaver]] ([[Tony Dow]]) from ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]''.<ref name=\"HoneyImHome\">Jones, Gerard (1993).

Krebs, and Tuesday Weld as Dobie's unattainable love interest Thalia Menninger.\n\nFirst pitched to and rejected by NBC, ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' was greenlit for series by CBS. [[Philip Morris USA|Phillip Morris]]' [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] was the program's primary sponsor, and it sold a week-to-week alternating co-sponsorship to [[Pillsbury Company]] for the first two seasons, with Dwayne Hickman appearing in one of the Pillsbury commercials.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> [[Colgate-Palmolive]] replaced Pillsbury as the alternate sponsor in season three.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/>\n\nWhile the pilot for ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' was shot at the main [[20th Century Fox]] lot in [[Century City, California]], principal photography and production for the series proper took place at the original Fox Film Corporation studio at the intersection of [[Sunset Boulevard]] and [[Western Avenue (Los Angeles)|Western Avenue]] (next to the headquarters of [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group Inc.|DeLuxe]]) in [[Hollywood]].<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> ''Dobie Gillis'' was [[multi-camera setup|filmed with two cameras]], a method that producer and director [[Rod Amateau]] had learned while working on ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]''. Fox turned out one episode of ''Dobie Gillis'' a week, working from May to December of each year. Dwayne Hickman's fourth-wall-breaking monologues were saved for the end of the production of each episode; their length resulted in Hickman requesting and getting a [[teleprompter]] from which to read them for season two forward.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\nThe show was not filmed before a [[live studio audience]]; during the first season, a live audience viewed each episode and provided its [[laugh track]].<ref name=\"tweedle20100610\">{{cite interview|title=Hollywood Everyman: A Conversation with William Schallert|date=June 10, 2010|accessdate=December 12, 2011|url=http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/williamschallerti|last=Schallert|first=William|subjectlink=William Schallert|interviewer=Tweedle, Sam|work=Confessions of a Pop Culture Addict|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117134300/http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/williamschallerti/|archivedate=January 17, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Subsequent seasons used a standard laugh track provided by technician [[Charles Douglass]].{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |pp=9\u201321}}\n\nCreator Max Shulman served as the show runner for and an uncredited producer of ''Dobie Gillis''.<ref name=\"STUEP5\">{{cite web |last=Shostak |first=Stu |date=Nov 3, 2010 |url=http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php |title=Program 202 \u2014 Steve Franken |website=The Stu's Show Archives |access-date=Sep 9, 2013}}</ref> He contributed scripts for episodes of the show during all four seasons, with several stories \u2013 including \"Love is a Science\" (season 1, episode 3), \"Love is a Fallacy\" (season 1, episode 22), and \"Parlez-Vous English\" (season 2, episode 11) \u2013 directly adapted by Shulman from his original Dobie Gillis short stories.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/><ref name=\"STUEP5\"/>\n\nDuring its fourth season, the show, by then known as ''Max Shulman's Dobie Gillis'', suffered both from competition with NBC's color Western ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' and from the growing inattention from Max Shulman.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Shulman began spending increasing amounts of time at his home in [[Westport, Connecticut]] while the show was in active production,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}<ref name=\"STUEP5\"/> ceding his role as show runner to associate producers Joel Kane and Guy Scarpitta.

Despite being cast as a 17-year-old, Hickman was 24 when he starred in the pilot in the summer of 1958. Because Hickman had appeared for several years on ''Bob Cummings'' as Chuck, he was required by Shulman and CBS to bleach his dark brown hair blond for the role of Dobie to distance himself from that character in the public's (and the sponsors') minds.<ref>Roger Miller, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4207/is_19950112/ai_n10180818/print \"Baby Boomers still follow the pop icons of their era\"], ''Milwaukee Journal''; accessed February 7, 2016.</ref> By the second season, however, Hickman was permitted to return to his natural hair color, after he had complained to the producers that the constant bleaching required to keep his low [[crew cut]] hairstyle blond was causing his scalp to break out.<ref name=\"STUEP4\">{{cite web |last=Shostak |first=Stu |date=Feb 21, 2007 |url=http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php |title=Program 12 \u2014 Dwayne Hickman and Joan Roberts Hickman |website=The Stu's Show Archives |access-date=Aug 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBob Denver, a 23-year-old grade-school teacher and postal worker with no previous professional acting experience, won the part of 18-year-old Maynard G. Krebs after his sister, a casting director's secretary, added his name to a list of candidates auditioning for the role.<ref name=\"STUEP7\"/> Denver and Hickman had both attended [[Loyola Marymount University|Loyola University]] together several years earlier and were casually acquainted before ''Dobie Gillis''.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} After filming the third episode of ''Dobie Gillis'', Denver announced that he had received his [[Conscription|draft notice]]. The character of Maynard enlisted in the Army and was given an elaborate sendoff in the show's next episode, \"Maynard's Farewell to the Troops\". Stage actor [[Michael J. Pollard]] was brought out from New York to play Maynard's cousin, Jerome Krebs, who was introduced at the end of \"Maynard's Farewell to the Troops\" and was to assume Maynard's role in future scripts.<ref name=\"STUEP7\">{{cite web |last=Shostak |first=Stu |url=http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php |title=Program 137 \u2014 Remembering Bob Denver with guests Dreama Denver, Dwayne Hickman, Joan Roberts Hickman, and Bill Funt |website=The Stu's Show Archives |date=Aug 12, 2009 |access-date=Dec 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBefore Pollard had completed his first episode, \"The Sweet Singer of Central High\", however, Denver returned and announced that he had been designated \"[[4F (military conscription)|4F]]\" \u2013 unfit for service \u2013 during his physical because of a neck injury he had sustained some years earlier.<ref name=\"STUEP7\"/> After completing \"The Sweet Singer of Central High\", Pollard was bought out of his contract \u2013 he had signed a \"[[Guarantee (filmmaking)|play-or-pay]]\" contract and was paid for all 30 episodes in which he was to have appeared, and Denver was rehired. Maynard's return was explained by stating that the Army had given Maynard a \"hardship discharge\" \u2013 the Army's hardship, not Maynard's.<ref name=\"STUEP7\"/><ref>[http://www.peteranthonyholder.com/cjad27.htm CJAD 800 AM, Montreal radio interview with Bob Denver], peteranthonyholder.com; accessed February 7, 2016.</ref>\n\nInitially, only a supporting character, Denver's Maynard had graduated to co-lead by season two, as the character's \"beatnik\" mannerisms and eccentricities made him a hit with the viewing audience.<ref name=\"STUEP7\"/> For a handful of episodes towards the end of season three, Maynard became the show's lead character while Dwayne Hickman was hospitalized with and later recovering from [[pneumonia]].{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} \n\nDespite Maynard's rise in popularity and increased screen time, however, Denver \u2013 who had signed on as a Fox contract player without an agent \u2013 was unable to negotiate a raise in his $250/week salary until season four.{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |pp=9\u201321}}<ref name=\"STUEP7\"/> Denver was able to parlay his role on ''Dobie Gillis'' into lead roles on later television series, in particular the one for which he is best remembered, the 1964\u201367 CBS sitcom ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''.<ref name=\"STUEP7\"/>\n\nVeteran actors Frank Faylen, a longtime acquaintance of the Hickman family and a fellow parishioner at their church,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} and Florida Friebus were cast as Dobie's parents, Herbert T. Gillis and Winifred Gillis. Faylen's gruff, no-nonsense father character \u2013 which, according to Hickman, was essentially the same as Faylen's real-life personality{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} \u2013 was more of an antagonist to Dobie during the first season of the show, his demeanor underscored by his often-repeated catchphrase \"I gotta kill that boy! I just gotta!\" Both CBS and Marlboro strongly disapproved of the catchphrase and the Herbert T. Gillis character's hard edges.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} An early season-two episode, \"You Ain't Nothin' But a Houn' Dog\" (episode 2), in which Dobie inadvertently wins a father-and-son essay contest, was produced to explain why Herbert ceased use of his catchphrase. Herbert was further softened as the series bore on, the character's anger tempered to frustration.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Recurring casting notes===\nExperienced child actress Tuesday Weld was cast as Dobie's love interest in \"Caper at the Bijou\" and stayed on as a semiregular. Weld and Dwayne Hickman had previously appeared as a teenage couple in the 1958 Fox feature film ''[[Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys!]]'', based on a Max Shulman novel, though produced without his input.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Neither Hickman nor Weld was fond of the other, with Hickman later stating he felt Weld was not as dedicated as necessary to rehearsal and referring to her as \"a pain in the neck\". Weld reportedly found Hickman pushy and out-of-touch. Aged 15 at the time of shooting the pilot, Weld had to legally spend much of her time onset in school with a tutor,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} and the production periodically ran into issues involving Weld's later publicly known difficult home life.<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\">{{Cite video |title=Interview with Sheila James Kuehl |medium=Video |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation]] |date=2013 |url=http://emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/sheila-kuehl}}</ref> \n\nHer work in ''Dobie Gillis'' and the feature film ''[[The Five Pennies]]'' made Weld a star, leading to substantial publicity.{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |pp=9\u201321}} She departed the series after the first year to star in features, although she was persuaded by Max Shulman to return for two guest appearances, \"Birth of a Salesman\" (season 3, episode 21) and \"What's a Little Murder Between Friends?\" (season 4, episode 2).{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\nHerbert Anderson was cast as Mr. Pomfritt, Dobie and Maynard's English teacher at school. Anderson appeared in a lead role in the pilot for ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]''; when that show was picked up (also by CBS), he chose to stay with that cast, and veteran actor William Schallert appeared in the recurring role of Mr. Pomfritt through the end of season three.\n\nWarren Beatty was cast as Milton Armitage, a recurring rival of Dobie's at his high school, during the first half of season one.<ref name=\"Beatty\"/> Hickman later recalled that Beatty \"looked at me like I was a bug\" while on set.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Beatty did remain friends with his brief co-star [[Michael J. Pollard]]. The two co-starred in ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' eight years later. He quit the series in September 1959, midway through production of the first season after filming his fifth and final ''Dobie'' episode, \"The Smoke-Filled Room\", to appear in ''A Loss of Roses'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].<ref name=\"Beatty\">Finstead, Susan (2008). ''Warren Beatty: A Private Man''. New York: Random House LLC, pp. 190\u2013220<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nVeteran child actress Sheila James, who, playing daughter \"Jackie\" on ''[[The Stu Erwin Show]]'', had worked with Dwayne Hickman on that series and ''The Bob Cummings Show'', was cast without an audition as Zelda Gilroy, the tomboyish brainy girl who was in love with Dobie.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Originally intended as a one-shot character for the episode \"Love is a Science\" (season 1, episode 3), Max Shulman liked both Zelda and Sheila James and had Zelda retained as a semi-regular character. Signing a contract with ''Dobie Gillis'' necessitated James, then an eighteen-year-old college student, changing her major from theater to English, so Shulman could assist her with her studies on set.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/>\n\nAfter the third season of ''Dobie Gillis'', Rod Amateau and Max Shulman produced a pilot for a ''Zelda'' spinoff starring Sheila James as Zelda Gilroy, with [[Joe Flynn (US actor)|Joe Flynn]] and Jean Byron cast as her parents.<ref name=\"STUEP3\">{{cite web |last=Shostak |first=Stu |date=July 17, 2013 |url=http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php?y=2013 |title=Program 331 \u2014 Sheila James Kuehl |website=The Stu's Show Archives |access-date=July 25, 2013}}</ref> However, CBS president [[James Aubrey]] lingered over moving forward with the ''Zelda'' series for a long time before firmly rejecting the series, with Amateau telling James in private that Aubrey had found ''Zelda'' (and by extension James, then a closeted lesbian) \"too butch\".<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\"/> James' contract for the pilot and the resulting waiting period caused her to be absent from much of the fourth and final season of ''Dobie Gillis'', though Amateau was able to hire her to return as Zelda for four episodes towards the end of the season.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Acting roles became sparse for James by the late 1960s; she went into law and politics under her birth name of Sheila Kuehl and later became the first openly gay person elected to the [[California State Legislature]].<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\"/>\n\nSteve Franken, a 28-year-old veteran character actor, was cast immediately after Beatty's departure as Chatsworth Osbourne, Jr, a replacement character for Milton Armitage. While both Milton and Chatsworth were rich rivals of Dobie Gillis (and both characters shared the same actress, [[Doris Packer]], for a mother) and were, according to canon, cousins, where Beatty's Milton was a menacing and athletic physical threat, Franken's pompous, foppish Chatsworth tended to plot and scheme his way through competitions with Dobie, more often than not using his riches to get ahead.<ref name=\"STUEP5\"/> The Chatsworth character became popular enough that the producers had to consciously limit his appearances on the series to roughly one per month to prevent Franken from upstaging Hickman and Denver, but Franken stated both during and after ''Dobie Gillis'' that playing Chatsworth led him to be typecast and stifled his career.<ref name=\"STUEP5\"/>\n\nYoung actor Bobby Diamond was brought on at the beginning of season four as Dobie's teenaged cousin, Duncan \"Dunky\" Gillis. By 1962, the 28-year-old Dwayne Hickman had begun to look too mature to carry the teenager-based plot lines,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} and instead Diamond's \"Dunky\" was given this material, with the older yet immature Maynard as a running partner. The character was dropped midway through the fourth season, with attention shifting back to the characters of Dobie, Maynard, Chatsworth, and Zelda for the remaining episodes of the series.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\nActresses who played Dobie's love interests included [[Cheryl Holdridge]], [[Michele Lee]], [[Susan Watson]], [[Marlo Thomas]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Ellen Burstyn]] (then billed as Ellen McRae), [[Barbara Babcock]], [[Sherry Jackson]] and [[Danielle De Metz]]. [[Yvonne Craig]] appeared in the opening credits and the closing sequence of the pilot film used to sell the series to CBS but did not appear in the actual episode, \"Caper at The Bijou\", when it was broadcast. She would eventually play five different girlfriends on the show, more than any other actress.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Other media==\nAfter the first season of ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' had aired, [[Capitol Records]] attempted to make a recording star out of Dwayne Hickman, ignoring the fact that Hickman, by his own admission, was not a singer.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Recording engineers had to piece together numerous takes to get a usable vocal track from Hickman for each song. Hickman introduced several of the songs from the ''Dobie!'' album on the show during its second season, including \"I'm a Lover, Not a Fighter\" and \"Don't Send a Rabbit\".{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Earlier, while Hickman was appearing on ''[[Love That Bob]]'', he had recorded a single, \"School Dance\", for [[ABC-Paramount Records]], but both the single and the later Capitol album sold very few copies.<ref>[http://www.famousinterview.ca/interviews/dwayne_hickman.htm Dwayne Hickman interview], famousinterview.ca; accessed February 7, 2016.</ref>\n\n[[DC Comics]] published a ''Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' comic book that ran for 26 issues from 1960 to 1964, featuring artwork by [[Bob Oksner]].

Cherry after Dwayne Hickman, who was the film's producer, was forced by the network to fire Max Shulman and Rod Amateau, with whom he had originally conceived the film.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/><ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> The plot features the married Dobie and Zelda running the Gillis Grocery \u2013 now also a pharmacy \u2013 on their own, Dobie's parents having died. Meanwhile, Thalia (played by [[Connie Stevens]] after Weld declined to reprise the role) returns to Central City \u2013 with Maynard, whom she has rescued from a deserted island \u2013 after 20 years (an homage to ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''), and offers a $50,000 bounty to anyone who will kill Dobie when he refuses to divorce Zelda and marry her. Hickman, Denver, and James returned for ''Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis'', which featured Steve Franken as Chatsworth, WIlliam Schallert as Mr. Pomfritt, and [[Scott Grimes]] as son Georgie Gillis.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/><ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> [[Connie Stevens]]' daughter, [[Tricia Leigh Fisher]], played Chatsworth's daughter Chatsie, who chased Georgie Gillis with the same zeal Zelda had once used chasing Dobie.\n\n==Home media==\nOn July 2, 2013, [[Shout!

A French army of 80,000 commanded by [[Maurice, comte de Saxe|Marshal Saxe]] faced a combined [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|British, Dutch, German and Austrian]] force of 60,000, led by the [[William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]].\n\nUnder Saxe, arguably the most talented general of his generation, the French conquered much of the [[Austrian Netherlands]] between 1744 to 1746. Cumberland intended to retake [[Antwerp]] in the spring of 1747, but Saxe threatened to cut him off from his key supply base at [[Maastricht]], forcing him to defend it.\n\nSaxe exploited a series of mistakes by Cumberland, and only counterattacks by the Allied cavalry enabled the bulk of his army to withdraw in good order. Defeat ended Allied hopes of regaining lost ground, and the French captured [[Siege of Bergen op Zoom (1747)|Bergen op Zoom]] in September, then Maastricht in May 1748. \n\nHowever, the cost of the war meant France's financial system was on the verge of collapse, while the British naval blockade caused severe food shortages. Their position worsened in October 1747, when the British naval victory of [[Second_Battle_of_Cape_Finisterre_(1747)|Second Cape Finisterre]] left them unable to defend their merchant shipping or trade routes. Both sides now wanted peace, leading to the October 1748 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Location map many|Belgium|caption = The Austrian Netherlands and Southern Dutch Republic; key locations 1747\u20131748|relief=yes|border = black| width = 380| float = left\n|label = Brussels |pos=left  |lat_deg=50|lat_min =51|lon_deg = 4|lon_min = 21\n|label3 = Bergen op zoom |pos3= left|lat3_deg=51|lat3_min = 30|lon3_deg = 4|lon3_min = 18\n|label4 = Antwerp |pos4=bottom|lat4_deg=51|lat4_min = 13|lon4_deg = 4|lon4_min = 24\n|label5 = Lafelt |pos5=left|lat5_deg=50|lat5_min = 50|lon5_deg = 5|lon5_min = 37\n|label6 = Liege   |pos6=left|lat6_deg=50|lat6_min =38 |lon6_deg = 5 |lon6_min = 34\n|label7 = Breda   |pos7 = top| lat7_deg = 51 | lat7_min = 35 | lon7_deg = 4 | lon7_min = 47\n|label8 = Namur   |pos8 = bottom| lat8_deg = 50 | lat8_min = 28 | lon8_deg = 4| lon8_min = 52|\n|label9= Maastricht|pos9 = right|lat9_deg = 50 | lat9_min = 51 | lon9_deg = 5 | lon9_min = 41\n}}\nWhen the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] began in 1740, Britain was focused on the 1739\u20131748 [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] with [[Enlightenment_in_Spain|Spain]], fought mostly in the [[Caribbean_Sea|Caribbean]]. British and Dutch troops in [[Flanders]] initially did so as part of the army of [[Electorate_of_Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Hanover]]; France only declared war on Britain in March 1744, the [[Dutch Republic]] remained neutral until 1747.{{sfn|Scott|2015|pp=48\u201350}} \n\nSupported by British financial subsidies, by the end of 1746 Austria had defeated Spanish efforts to regain possessions in Northern Italy lost in the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. Austria acquired the [[Austrian Netherlands]] in 1713 only because neither the British or Dutch would allow the other to control it, and retaining it was not a strategic priority. [[Maria Theresa]] wanted peace in order to restructure her administration.{{sfn|Scott|2015|pp=58\u201360}}\n\nOne reason France entered the war was to reduce the post-1713 expansion of British commercial strength, viewed as a threat to the European balance of power. By 1747, British trade had recovered from its post 1739 decline and was expanding once again, while the French economy was being strangled by their naval blockade.{{sfn|McKay|1983|pp=138\u2013140}} \n\nVictory at [[Battle_of_Rocoux|Rocoux]] in October 1746 confirmed French control of the Austrian Netherlands, but failed to force Britain to end the war. The French financial system was on the verge of collapse, accompanied by severe food shortages; ending the war had become imperative. Declaring war on the Dutch made the situation worse; as neutrals, they had been the main carriers of French imports and exports.{{sfn|Scott|2015|p=61}}\n\nFranco-British negotiations began at [[Breda]] in August 1746, but the British envoy, [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], was told to delay, hoping the position in Flanders would improve.{{sfn|Rodger|1993|p=42}} Only British subsidies kept their Allies fighting; in the January 1747 Hague Convention, Britain agreed to fund Austrian and Sardinian forces in Italy and an Allied army of 140,000 in Flanders, increasing to 192,000 in 1748.{{sfn|Hochedlinger|2003|p=260}} \n\nAlthough the cost of the war also impacted the British, they were far better equipped to finance it.{{sfn|Carlos|Neal|Wandschneider|2006|p=2}} The [[Duke of Newcastle (PM)|Duke of Newcastle]] hoped to recover ground in the Austrian Netherlands, and that the death of [[Philip_V_of_Spain|Philip V]] in July 1746 would break the [[Pacte_de_Famille|Bourbon alliance]]; both proved incorrect.{{sfn|Scott|2015|p=62}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Fort Liefkenshoek 02.JPG|thumb|right|Fort Liefkenshoek, near [[Antwerp]] (background); its capture by the French in April forced the Allies to abandon plans to retake the port]]\nBy minimising French forces elsewhere, Saxe was able to assemble a field army of 120,000 men for the 1747 campaign. The defeat of the [[Jacobite_rising_of_1745|Jacobite Rising]] allowed [[William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Cumberland]] to transfer troops back to Flanders and prepare for an offensive. The plan was to capture [[Antwerp]] in February but bad weather, lack of transport, and war weariness meant the Allies were not ready to take the field until early May.{{Cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nDuring this delay, [[Louis_Georges_\u00c9rasme_de_Contades|Contades]] captured Fort Liefkenhock, making Antwerp too strong to attack. Simultaneously, [[Ulrich Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Woldemar, Comte de Lowendal|L\u00f6wendahl]] seized [[Sas van Gent]], [[IJzendijke|Ijzenijke]] and Eekels, threatening Cumberland's supply lines.{{sfn|White|2012|p=208}} The latter inspired an [[Orangism_(Dutch_Republic)#Second_Stadtholderless_Period_and_Orange_Restoration_of_1747|Orangist Coup]] in [[Zeeland]], which eventually led to [[William_IV,_Prince_of_Orange|William IV]] being appointed first hereditary [[Stadtholder]] of all seven Dutch provinces.{{sfn|Thompson|2012|p=177}} \n\nIn order to protect [[Maastricht]], Cumberland sent [[Leopold_Joseph_von_Daun|von Daun]] to secure [[Tongeren]], then held by [[Gaspard_de_Clermont-Tonnerre|Clermont-Tonnerre]]. The Allied cavalry under [[John_Ligonier,_1st_Earl_Ligonier|Ligonier]] were sent to occupy the Tongeren-Maastricht road, which ran along a ridge parallel to the [[River Meuse]]. Finding the French already in possession, they halted for the night, with the infantry billeted in the villages of Vlytingen and Lauffeld.{{sfn|Lauffeldt}} As at Rocoux, the Austrians were on the right, holding the villages of Grote and Kleine Spouwen, now part of the Belgian town of [[Bilzen]]. A steep ravine immediately in front protected them from a direct assault.{{sfn|Morris}}\n[[File:1st Earl Ligonier.jpg|thumb|left|[[John_Ligonier,_1st_Earl_Ligonier|Earl Ligonier]] (1680\u20131770); his cavalry charges allowed the Allies to make an orderly retreat, although he was taken prisoner]]\nThe next day was overcast and it later began raining heavily, making movement slow and difficult.

the Austrian Succession}}\nThe '''Battle of Lauffeld''', variously known as '''Lafelt''', '''Laffeld''', '''Lawfeld''', '''Lawfeldt''', '''Maastricht''' or '''Val''', took place on 2 July 1747, during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. A French army of 80,000 commanded by [[Maurice, comte de Saxe|Marshal Saxe]] faced a combined [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|British, Dutch, German and Austrian]] force of 60,000, led by the [[William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]].\n\nUnder Saxe, arguably the most talented general of his generation, the French conquered much of the [[Austrian Netherlands]] between 1744 to 1746. Cumberland intended to retake [[Antwerp]] in the spring of 1747, but Saxe threatened to cut him off from his key supply base at [[Maastricht]], forcing him to defend it.\n\nSaxe exploited a series of mistakes by Cumberland, and only counterattacks by the Allied cavalry enabled the bulk of his army to withdraw in good order. Defeat ended Allied hopes of regaining lost ground, and the French captured [[Siege of Bergen op Zoom (1747)|Bergen op Zoom]] in September, then Maastricht in May 1748. \n\nHowever, the cost of the war meant France's financial system was on the verge of collapse, while the British naval blockade caused severe food shortages. Their position worsened in October 1747, when the British naval victory of [[Second_Battle_of_Cape_Finisterre_(1747)|Second Cape Finisterre]] left them unable to defend their merchant shipping or trade routes. Both sides now wanted peace, leading to the October 1748 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Location map many|Belgium|caption = The Austrian Netherlands and Southern Dutch Republic; key locations 1747-1748|relief=yes|border = black| width = 380| float = left\n|label = Brussels |pos=left  |lat_deg=50|lat_min =51|lon_deg = 4|lon_min = 21\n|label3 = Bergen op zoom |pos3= left|lat3_deg=51|lat3_min = 30|lon3_deg = 4|lon3_min = 18\n|label4 = Antwerp |pos4=bottom|lat4_deg=51|lat4_min = 13|lon4_deg = 4|lon4_min = 24\n|label5 = Lafelt |pos5=left|lat5_deg=50|lat5_min = 50|lon5_deg = 5|lon5_min = 37\n|label6 = Liege   |pos6=left|lat6_deg=50|lat6_min =38 |lon6_deg = 5 |lon6_min = 34\n|label7 = Breda   |pos7 = top| lat7_deg = 51 | lat7_min = 35 | lon7_deg = 4 | lon7_min = 47\n|label8 = Namur   |pos8 = bottom| lat8_deg = 50 | lat8_min = 28 | lon8_deg = 4| lon8_min = 52|\n|label9= Maastricht|pos9 = right|lat9_deg = 50 | lat9_min = 51 | lon9_deg = 5 | lon9_min = 41\n}}\nWhen the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] began in 1740, Britain was focused on the 1739-1748 [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] with [[Enlightenment_in_Spain|Spain]], fought mostly in the [[Caribbean_Sea|Caribbean]]. British and Dutch troops in [[Flanders]] initially did so as part of the army of [[Electorate_of_Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Hanover]]; France only declared war on Britain in March 1744, the [[Dutch Republic]] remained neutral until 1747.{{sfn|Scott|2015|pp=48-50}} \n\nSupported by British financial subsidies, by the end of 1746 Austria had defeated Spanish efforts to regain possessions in Northern Italy lost in the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. Austria acquired the [[Austrian Netherlands]] in 1713 only because neither the British or Dutch would allow the other to control it, and retaining it was not a strategic priority. [[Maria Theresa]] wanted peace in order to restructure her administration.{{sfn|Scott|2015|pp=58-60}}\n\nOne reason France entered the war was to reduce the post-1713 expansion of British commercial strength, viewed as a threat to the European balance of power. By 1747, British trade had recovered from its post 1739 decline and was expanding once again, while the French economy was being strangled by their naval blockade.{{sfn|McKay|1983|pp=138-140}} \n\nVictory at [[Battle_of_Rocoux|Rocoux]] in October 1746 confirmed French control of the Austrian Netherlands, but failed to force Britain to end the war. The French financial system was on the verge of collapse, accompanied by severe food shortages; ending the war had become imperative. Declaring war on the Dutch made the situation worse; as neutrals, they had been the main carriers of French imports and exports.{{sfn|Scott|2015|p=61}}\n\nFranco-British negotiations began at [[Breda]] in August 1746, but the British envoy, [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], was told to delay, hoping the position in Flanders would improve.{{sfn|Rodger|1993|p=42}} Only British subsidies kept their Allies fighting; in the January 1747 Hague Convention, Britain agreed to fund Austrian and Sardinian forces in Italy and an Allied army of 140,000 in Flanders, increasing to 192,000 in 1748.{{sfn|Hochedlinger|2003|p=260}} \n\nAlthough the cost of the war also impacted the British, they were far better equipped to finance it.{{sfn|Carlos|Neal|Wandschneider|2006|p=2}} The [[Duke of Newcastle (PM)|Duke of Newcastle]] hoped to recover ground in the Austrian Netherlands, and that the death of [[Philip_V_of_Spain|Philip V]] in July 1746 would break the [[Pacte_de_Famille|Bourbon alliance]]; both proved incorrect.{{sfn|Scott|2015|p=62}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Fort Liefkenshoek 02.JPG|thumb|right|Fort Liefkenshoek, near [[Antwerp]] (background); its capture by the French in April forced the Allies to abandon plans to retake the port]]\nBy minimising French forces elsewhere, Saxe was able to assemble a field army of 120,000 men for the 1747 campaign. The defeat of the [[Jacobite_rising_of_1745|Jacobite Rising]] allowed [[William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Cumberland]] to transfer troops back to Flanders and prepare for an offensive. The plan was to capture [[Antwerp]] in February but bad weather, lack of transport, and war weariness meant the Allies were not ready to take the field until early May.{{Cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nDuring this delay, [[Louis_Georges_\u00c9rasme_de_Contades|Contades]] captured Fort Liefkenhock, making Antwerp too strong to attack. Simultaneously, [[Ulrich Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Woldemar, Comte de Lowendal|L\u00f6wendahl]] seized [[Sas van Gent]], [[IJzendijke|Ijzenijke]] and Eekels, threatening Cumberland's supply lines.{{sfn|White|2012|p=208}} The latter inspired an [[Orangism_(Dutch_Republic)#Second_Stadtholderless_Period_and_Orange_Restoration_of_1747|Orangist Coup]] in [[Zeeland]], which eventually led to [[William_IV,_Prince_of_Orange|William IV]] being appointed first hereditary [[Stadtholder]] of all seven Dutch provinces.{{sfn|Thompson|2012|p=177}} \n\nIn order to protect [[Maastricht]], Cumberland sent [[Leopold_Joseph_von_Daun|von Daun]] to secure [[Tongeren]], then held by [[Gaspard_de_Clermont-Tonnerre|Clermont-Tonnerre]]. The Allied cavalry under [[John_Ligonier,_1st_Earl_Ligonier|Ligonier]] were sent to occupy the Tongeren-Maastricht road, which ran along a ridge parallel to the [[River Meuse]]. Finding the French already in possession, they halted for the night, with the infantry billeted in the villages of Vlytingen and Lauffeld.{{sfn|Lauffeldt}} As at Rocoux, the Austrians were on the right, holding the villages of Grote and Kleine Spouwen, now part of the Belgian town of [[Bilzen]]. A steep ravine immediately in front protected them from a direct assault.{{sfn|Morris}}\n[[File:1st Earl Ligonier.jpg|thumb|left|[[John_Ligonier,_1st_Earl_Ligonier|Earl Ligonier]] (1680-1770); his cavalry charges allowed the Allies to make an orderly retreat, although he was taken prisoner]]\nThe next day was overcast and it later began raining heavily, making movement slow and difficult. An exchange of artillery fire began at 6:00 am, which continued until 8:30. The British and German infantry left the villages where they had spent the night, having first set them on fire to prevent their use by the French, and formed up on open ground.
