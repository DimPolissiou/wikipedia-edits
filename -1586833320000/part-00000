Initially the size of a [[regiment]], the LSSAH eventually grew into an elite [[military division|division-sized]] unit during [[World War II]].\n\nThe LSSAH participated in combat during the [[invasion of Poland]], and was amalgamated into the [[Waffen-SS]] together with the ''[[SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe]]'' (SS-VT) and the combat units of the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde]]'' (SS-TV) prior to Operation [[Operation Barbarossa|''Barbarossa'']] in 1941. By mid-1942 it had been increased in size from a regiment to a [[Panzergrenadier]] division and was designated '''SS Panzergrenadier Division \"Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler\"'''. It received its final form as a [[Panzer division]] in October 1943.\n\nMembers of the LSSAH perpetrated numerous atrocities and war crimes, including the [[Malmedy massacre]]. They killed an estimated 5,000 prisoners of war in the period 1940\u20131945, mostly on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Margolian|2000|p=14}}\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Early history (1923\u20131933)==\nIn the early days of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP), the leadership realized that a bodyguard unit composed of reliable men was needed. [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] formed a guard formation from the ''19.Granatwerfer-Kompanie''; from this formation the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) soon evolved. [[Adolf Hitler]] in early 1923, ordered the formation of a small separate bodyguard dedicated to his service rather than \"a suspect mass\", such as the SA.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=14, 16}} Originally the unit was composed of only eight men, commanded by [[Julius Schreck]] and [[Joseph Berchtold]].{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=16}} It was designated the ''Stabswache'' (staff guard).{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=45}} The ''Stabswache'' were issued unique badges, but at this point was still under SA control. Schreck resurrected the use of the ''[[Totenkopf]]'' (\"death's head\") as the unit's insignia, a symbol various elite forces had used in the past, including specialized assault troops of [[Imperial Germany]] in [[World War I]] who used ''[[Oskar von Hutier|Hutier]]'' [[infiltration tactics]].{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=16}}\n\nIn May 1923, the unit was renamed ''Sto\u00dftrupp'' (Shock Troop)\u2013Hitler.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=16}} The unit numbered no more than 20 members at that time.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=10, 16}} On 9 November 1923, the ''Sto\u00dftrupp'', along with the SA and several other Nazi paramilitary units, took part in the abortive [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in [[Munich]]. In the aftermath, Hitler was imprisoned and his party and all associated formations, including the ''Sto\u00dftrupp'', were disbanded.{{sfn|Wegner|1990|p=62}}\n\n[[File:LSSS AH.svg|thumb|left|upright|The second model of the LSSAH Standard]]\n\nIn the mid-1920s, violence remained a large part of Bavarian politics.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=26}} Hitler was a potential target. In 1925, Hitler ordered the formation of a new bodyguard unit, the ''Schutzkommando'' (protection command).{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=26}}  The unit was renamed the ''Sturmstaffel'' (assault squadron) and in November was renamed the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'', abbreviated to SS.{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp=26\u201329}} By 1933 the SS had grown from a small bodyguard unit to a formation of over 50,000 men. The decision was made to form a new bodyguard unit, again called the ''Stabswache'', which was mostly made up of men from the [[1st SS-Standarte]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=3}} By 1933 this unit was placed under the command of [[Sepp Dietrich]], who selected 117 men to form the ''SS-Stabswache'' Berlin on 17 March 1933.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=9}} The unit replaced the army guards at the [[Reich Chancellery]].{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=9}} Out of this initial group, three eventually became divisional commanders, at least eight would become regimental commanders, fifteen became battalion commanders, and over thirty became company commanders in the [[Waffen-SS]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=1}} Eleven men from the first company of 117 went on to win the Knights Cross, and forty of them were awarded the German Cross in gold for bravery.{{sfn|Johnson|1999|p=15}} Later in 1933, two further training units were formed: ''SS-Sonderkommando Zossen'' on 10 May, and a second unit, designated ''SS-Sonderkommando J\u00fcterbog'' on 8 July.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=11}} These were the only SS units to receive military training at that time. Most of the training staff came from the ranks of the army.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=11}} On 3 September 1933 the two ''Sonderkommando'' merged into the ''SS-Sonderkommando Berlin'' under Dietrich's command.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=13}} Most of their duties involved providing outer security for Hitler at his residences, public appearances and guard duty at the Reich Chancellery.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=45}}\n\nIn November 1933, on the 10th anniversary of the Beer Hall Putsch, the ''Sonderkommando'' took part in the rally and memorial service for the NSDAP members who had been killed during the putsch. During the ceremony, the members of the ''Sonderkommando'' swore personal allegiance to Hitler. At the conclusion the unit received a new title, \"''Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler''\" (LAH).{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=17, 19}} The term ''Leibstandarte'' was derived partly from ''[[Leibgarde (military)|Leibgarde]]'' \u2013 a somewhat archaic German translation of \"Guard of Corps\" or personal bodyguard of a military leader (\"Leib\" = lit. \"body, torso\") \u2013 and ''Standarte'': the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) or ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) term for a regiment-sized unit, also the German word for a specific type of heraldic flag ([[Heraldic flag#Standard|Standard]]).\n\n==Expansion==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-17311, Berlin-Lichterfelde, Hitler bei Leibstandarte.jpg|thumb|December 1935 parade for [[Adolf Hitler]] at the LSSAH Barracks. [[Sepp Dietrich]] is on the far right]]\n\nOn 13 April 1934, ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] ordered the ''Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler'' (LAH) to be renamed \"''Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler''\" (LSSAH). Himmler inserted the SS initials into the name to make it clear that the unit was independent from the SA or army.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=17, 19}} The LSSAH was considered a \"National Socialist\" unit, which eventually grew into an elite Panzer [[military division|division]] of the Waffen-SS.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=xxv, 12, 18, 58, 202, 203, 285}} Although nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=19, 33}}\n\nDuring 1934, ''[[Stabschef (SA)|Stabschef-SA]]'' Ernst R\u00f6hm continued to push for greater political influence for his already powerful SA. Hitler decided that the SA had to be eliminated as an independent political force and ordered the LSSAH to prepare for the action. The LSSAH formed two companies under the control of [[J\u00fcrgen Wagner]] and Otto Reich, these formations were moved to Munich on 30 June.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=22, 23}}\n\nHitler ordered all SA leaders to attend a meeting at the Hanselbauer Hotel in [[Bad Wiessee]], near Munich. Hitler along with Sepp Dietrich and a unit from the LSSAH travelled to Bad Wiessee to personally oversee R\u00f6hm's arrest on 30 June. Later at around 17:00 hours, Dietrich received orders from Hitler for the LSSAH to form an \"execution squad\" and go to Stadelheim prison where certain SA leaders were being held.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=22, 23}} There in the prison courtyard, the LSSAH firing squad shot five SA generals and an SA colonel.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=23}} Additional alleged \"traitors\" were shot in Berlin by a unit of the ''Leibstandarte''.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=24}} On 1 July Hitler finally agreed with G\u00f6ring and Himmler that R\u00f6hm should be executed.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=309\u2013314}} In what the Nazis called the R\u00f6hm Putsch, but otherwise came to be known as the [[Night of the Long Knives]], companies of the LSSAH, together with the [[Gestapo]] and G\u00f6ring's ''Landespolizeigruppe'', performed [[Death Squad]] actions. At least 85, but most likely no less than twice that number of people, were executed without trial over the next few days.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=309\u2013314}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=39}}\n\nThis action succeeded in effectively decapitating the SA and removing R\u00f6hm's threat to Hitler's leadership. In recognition of their actions, both the LSSAH and the ''Landespolizeigruppe'' ''General G\u00f6ring'' were expanded to regimental size and motorized.

The LSSAH again took the lead; by now its strength was reduced to just 77 armored vehicles. The 2nd SS Panzergrenadier Regiment, supported by several tanks, advanced up the road to Prokhorovka against heavy resistance. By midday, the infantry had cleared the Komsomolets State Farm and begun the attack on Hill 241.6, which they secured shortly after nightfall on 10 July.\n\nThe next day the advance resumed, with the division capturing Oktiabr'skii State Farm and Hill 252.2 in heavy fighting against Soviet [[Paratroop]]s of the [[Soviet 9th Guards Airborne Division|9th Guards Airborne Division]]. On 12 July, the Soviets threw the [[5th Guards Tank Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Tank Army]] into a [[Battle of Prokhorovka|counterattack near Prokhorovka]]. Two tank [[corps]] faced the LSSAH, hitting the Germans around Oktiabr'skii State Farm and Hill 252.2. In the ensuing fighting, the Germans inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviets. The Soviet counterattack had stalled the German advance, and the division was forced to fall back to Oktiabr'skii.

The II SS Panzer Corps was pulled back. The LSSAH was ordered out of the line, having suffered 2,753 casualties including 474 killed.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=14}} Eleven tanks were also lost during Citadel. The division was sent to Italy to help stabilize the situation there caused by the deposal of [[Benito Mussolini]] by the [[Pietro Badoglio|Badoglio]] government and the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] which began on the night of 9\u201310 July 1943.

The LSSAH was given the task of guarding several vital road and rail junctions in the area of [[Trento]]-[[Verona]]. After several weeks, the division was moved to the [[Parma]]-[[Reggio Emilia|Reggio]] area. During this period, the ''Leibstandarte'' was involved in several skirmishes with [[Partisan (military)|partisan]]s. With Italy having announced an [[Armistice with Italy|armistice with the Allies]] of 8 September 1943, the division was ordered to begin disarming nearby Italian units.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=15}} This went smoothly, with the exception of brief, bloody fights with Italian troops stationed in [[Parma]], [[Cremona]] and [[Piacenza]] on 9 September.

On 25 March, the 1st Panzer Army was encircled in the [[Kamenets-Podolsky pocket]].

The operation was preceded by a three-hour bombing by 2,500 aircraft.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=174}} The Division strength prior to Goodwood was reported as 59 Panzer IVs, 46 Panthers and 35 StuG IIIs.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=172}}\n\nII/1st SS Panzer Regiment, located near Garcelles, received orders to attack the British at [[Soliers]]. While moving its 13 Panthers towards Bourgu\u00e9bus, the unit engaged 60 British tanks, destroying 20 of them and capturing Soliers. Around 12:00, the Panther Battalion, I/1st SS Panzer regiment, was engaged in combat with the [[British 29th Armoured Brigade]] of the [[British 11th Armoured Division]]. The body of the LSSAH was rushed to the front from [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]], where it was being held in reserve. It counterattacked at 17:00, together with the [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Division]], and halted the British offensive on the left front.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=178}}\n\nThe British resumed their assault at around 13:00 on 19 July, having brought up reinforcements to continue the attack. They overran some of the forward German units and approached Bourgu\u00e9bus Ridge at 16:00. They came under fire from Panthers of the ''Leibstandarte'', who had taken up positions on the ridge. Reinforcements of the [[12th SS Panzer Division]] arrived at the right flank at around 15:00. The Canadians attacked next in the [[Battle of Verri\u00e8res Ridge]] and [[Operation Spring]] (see map), where the LSSAH came up against a number of Allied divisions, including the [[Guards Armoured Division]], [[British 7th Armoured Division|7th Armoured]], [[2nd Canadian Infantry Division|2nd]] and [[3rd Canadian Infantry Division|3rd Canadian]] Divisions.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=192}}\n\n===Operation L\u00fcttich===\n{{Main|Operation L\u00fcttich}}\n\nOn 25 July 1944, US forces under General [[Omar Bradley]] succeeded in breaking through the German defenses as part of [[Operation Cobra]] and entered Brittany.{{sfn |Van der Vat|2003|p=163}}{{sfn|D&#39;Este|1984|p=410}} Hitler forbade any retreat, and ordered a counteroffensive, codenamed [[Operation L\u00fcttich]],{{sfn|Lewin|1978|p=38}} by the XLVII Panzer Corps, consisting of the [[2nd Panzer Division]], part of the LSSAH, the [[SS Division Das Reich]] and the [[116th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|116th Panzer Division]].{{sfn |Van der Vat|2003|p=164}} The plan for the attack to hit the [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th Infantry Division]] east of Mortain, then cut through American defenses to reach the coast.{{sfn |Van der Vat|2003|p=163}} The US response was aided by [[Ultra]] intelligence, which had revealed the plans for Operation L\u00fcttich by 4 August.{{sfn|D&#39;Este|1984|p=415}} As a result, Bradley was able to obtain air support from both the US 9th Air Force and the [[RAF]].{{sfn|D&#39;Este|1984|p=416}}\n\n[[File:St.-Lambert-surrender.jpg|thumb|German soldiers surrender in St. Lambert on 19 August 1944.]]\nThe LSSAH and other divisions went on the attack on 7 August. The 1st SS Panzer Regiment, along with two battalions of motorized infantry, one combat engineer company, and the division's flak battalion, were used for the attack. The weather was not suitable for flying that morning, which disadvantaged the Allies. The SS Division Das Reich recaptured Mortain, and an armored battle group under [[Joachim Peiper]] reached Bourlopin, but had to halt due to US counterattacks and air strikes.\n\nThe much-reduced division was encircled in the [[Falaise pocket]] by US, Canadian, and Polish forces. Some LSSAH units broke out of the pocket on 22 August, leaving behind all their tanks and artillery. The division sustained 5,000 casualties during the Normandy campaign.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|pp=262\u2013264}} During their retreat from France, members of the LSSAH and the SS Division Hitlerjugend division murdered 34 French civilians in the towns of [[Tavaux]] and [[Plomion]].{{sfn|Beevor|2010|p=446}}\n\n===Ardennes Offensive===\n{{Main|Battle of the Bulge}}\n[[File:Kampfgruppe Knittel's troops on the road to Stavelot.jpg|thumb|Kampfgruppe Knittel's troops on the road to [[Stavelot]] to support Peiper]]\n\nThe Ardennes Offensive (16 December 1944 \u2013 25 January 1945) was a major German offensive launched through the forested [[Ardennes|Ardennes Mountains region]] of Belgium, France and Luxembourg..

At 12:30, near the hamlet of Baugnez, on the height halfway between the town of [[Malmedy]] and Ligneuville, Peiper's ''Kampfgruppe'' encountered a convoy of the [[285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion]], [[7th Armored Division (United States)|US 7th Armored Division]].{{sfn|Cole|1965|p=75}}{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=216}} After a brief battle the Americans surrendered.

Many of the perpetrators were sentenced to hang, but the sentences were commuted. Peiper himself was imprisoned for eleven years for his role in the killings.{{sfn|Parker|2012|p=278}}\n\nPeiper entered Stavelot on 18 December but encountered fierce resistance from the American defenders. Unable to defeat them, he left a smaller support force in town and headed for the bridge at [[Trois-Ponts]] with the bulk of his strength, but by the time he reached it, retreating US engineers had already destroyed it. Peiper then headed for the village of [[La Gleize]] and from there on to [[Stoumont]]. There, as Peiper approached, engineers blew up the bridge. US defenders were entrenched and ready. Peiper's men were cut off from the main German force and supplies when the Americans recaptured the poorly defended Stavelot on 19 December. As their situation in Stoumont was becoming hopeless, Peiper decided to pull back to La Gleize where he set up his defenses, waiting for the German relief force. Since no such force was able to penetrate the US line, Peiper decided to break out back to the German lines on 23 December. The men of the ''Kampfgruppe'' abandoned their vehicles and heavy equipment, although most of the men were able to escape.\n\nWith each passing day, enemy resistance stiffened and the advance was eventually halted on all fronts. The German High Command ordered that a renewed attack begin on 1 January 1945. Yet by this time, the Allies had regrouped their forces and were ready to repulse any attack launched by the Germans. The operation formally ended on 27 January 1945, and three days later Mohnke was promoted to SS-''[[Brigadef\u00fchrer]]''. LSSAH and the I SS Panzer Corps were then transferred to Hungary to bolster the crumbling situation there. Mohnke was wounded in an air raid.{{sfn|Fischer|2008|p=41}} In his place, SS-''Brigadef\u00fchrer'' [[Otto Kumm]] was appointed the new Division Commander as of 15 February 1945.{{sfn|Fischer|2008|p=41}}\n\n====Killing of Wereth 11====\n{{main|Wereth 11 Massacre}}\n[[File:Wereth 11 Memorial.JPG|thumb|upright=.5|right|Memorial to the ''Wereth 11'']]\nDuring Battle of the Bulge, troops from ''3./SS-PzAA1 LSSAH'' captured eleven African-American soldiers from the [[333rd Artillery Battalion (United States)|333rd Artillery Battalion]] in the hamlet of Wereth.

It began in great secrecy on 6 March 1945. The German forces launched attacks in Hungary near [[Lake Balaton]]. This area included some of the last oil reserves still available to the Axis. The operation involved many German units withdrawn from the failed Ardennes Offensive on the Western Front, including the [[6th Panzer Army|6th SS Panzer Army]] and the LSSAH. Operation Spring Awakening was a failure for the German side. Within a week, the early gains were halted by massive counter-attacks by Soviet forces. The overwhelming numerical superiority of the Red Army made any defense impossible, yet Hitler somehow had believed victory was attainable.{{sfn|Ziemke|1968|p=450}}\n\nAfter the failure of Operation Spring Awakening, Sepp Dietrich's 6th SS Panzer Army retreated in stages to the [[Vienna]] area.

The Germans could not hold Vienna, which fell to the Soviet forces on 13 April.{{sfn|Dollinger|1967|p=198}}\n\nThis defeat resulted in the ''\u00c4rmelstreifen'' (Cuff Titles Order) or \"armband order\", which was issued by Hitler to the commander of the 6th SS Panzer Army, Sepp Dietrich. Hitler claimed that the troops  \"did not fight as the situation demanded.\"{{sfn|Dollinger|1967|p=198}} As a mark of disgrace, Hitler ordered the Waffen-SS units involved to remove their [[cuff title]]s (German: ''\u00c4rmelstreifen'').

Initially the size of a [[regiment]], the LSSAH eventually grew into an elite [[military division|division-sized]] unit during [[World War II]].\n\nThe LSSAH participated in combat during the [[invasion of Poland]], and was amalgamated into the [[Waffen-SS]] together with the ''[[SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe]]'' (SS-VT) and the combat units of the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde]]'' (SS-TV) prior to Operation [[Operation Barbarossa|''Barbarossa'']] in 1941. By mid-1942 it had been increased in size from a regiment to a [[Panzergrenadier]] division and was designated '''SS Panzergrenadier Division \"Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler\"'''. It received its final form as a [[Panzer division]] in October 1943.\n\nMembers of the LSSAH perpetrated numerous atrocities and war crimes, including the [[Malmedy massacre]]. They killed an estimated 5,000 prisoners of war in the period 1940\u20131945, mostly on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Margolian|2000|p=14}}\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Early history (1923\u20131933)==\nIn the early days of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP), the leadership realized that a bodyguard unit composed of reliable men was needed. [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] formed a guard formation from the ''19.Granatwerfer-Kompanie''; from this formation the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) soon evolved. [[Adolf Hitler]] in early 1923, ordered the formation of a small separate bodyguard dedicated to his service rather than \"a suspect mass\", such as the SA.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=14, 16}} Originally the unit was composed of only eight men, commanded by [[Julius Schreck]] and [[Joseph Berchtold]].{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=16}} It was designated the ''Stabswache'' (staff guard).{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=45}} The ''Stabswache'' were issued unique badges, but at this point was still under SA control. Schreck resurrected the use of the ''[[Totenkopf]]'' (\"death's head\") as the unit's insignia, a symbol various elite forces had used in the past, including specialized assault troops of [[Imperial Germany]] in [[World War I]] who used ''[[Oskar von Hutier|Hutier]]'' [[infiltration tactics]].{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=16}}\n\nIn May 1923, the unit was renamed ''Sto\u00dftrupp'' (Shock Troop)\u2013Hitler.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=16}} The unit numbered no more than 20 members at that time.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=10, 16}} On 9 November 1923, the ''Sto\u00dftrupp'', along with the SA and several other Nazi paramilitary units, took part in the abortive [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in [[Munich]]. In the aftermath, Hitler was imprisoned and his party and all associated formations, including the ''Sto\u00dftrupp'', were disbanded.{{sfn|Wegner|1990|p=62}}\n\n[[File:LSSS AH.svg|thumb|left|upright|The second model of the LSSAH Standard]]\n\nIn the mid-1920s, violence remained a large part of Bavarian politics.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=26}} Hitler was a potential target. In 1925, Hitler ordered the formation of a new bodyguard unit, the ''Schutzkommando'' (protection command).{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=26}}  The unit was renamed the ''Sturmstaffel'' (assault squadron) and in November was renamed the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'', abbreviated to SS.{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp=26\u201329}} By 1933 the SS had grown from a small bodyguard unit to a formation of over 50,000 men. The decision was made to form a new bodyguard unit, again called the ''Stabswache'', which was mostly made up of men from the [[1st SS-Standarte]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=3}} By 1933 this unit was placed under the command of [[Sepp Dietrich]], who selected 117 men to form the ''SS-Stabswache'' Berlin on 17 March 1933.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=9}} The unit replaced the army guards at the [[Reich Chancellery]].{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=9}} Out of this initial group, three eventually became divisional commanders, at least eight would become regimental commanders, fifteen became battalion commanders, and over thirty became company commanders in the [[Waffen-SS]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=1}} Eleven men from the first company of 117 went on to win the Knights Cross, and forty of them were awarded the German Cross in gold for bravery.{{sfn|Johnson|1999|p=15}} Later in 1933, two further training units were formed: ''SS-Sonderkommando Zossen'' on 10 May, and a second unit, designated ''SS-Sonderkommando J\u00fcterbog'' on 8 July.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=11}} These were the only SS units to receive military training at that time. Most of the training staff came from the ranks of the army.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=11}} On 3 September 1933 the two ''Sonderkommando'' merged into the ''SS-Sonderkommando Berlin'' under Dietrich's command.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=13}} Most of their duties involved providing outer security for Hitler at his residences, public appearances and guard duty at the Reich Chancellery.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=45}}\n\nIn November 1933, on the 10th anniversary of the Beer Hall Putsch, the ''Sonderkommando'' took part in the rally and memorial service for the NSDAP members who had been killed during the putsch. During the ceremony, the members of the ''Sonderkommando'' swore personal allegiance to Hitler. At the conclusion the unit received a new title, \"''Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler''\" (LAH).{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=17, 19}} The term ''Leibstandarte'' was derived partly from ''[[Leibgarde (military)|Leibgarde]]'' \u2013 a somewhat archaic German translation of \"Guard of Corps\" or personal bodyguard of a military leader (\"Leib\" = lit. \"body, torso\") \u2013 and ''Standarte'': the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) or ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) term for a regiment-sized unit, also the German word for a specific type of heraldic flag ([[Heraldic flag#Standard|Standard]]).\n\n==Expansion==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-17311, Berlin-Lichterfelde, Hitler bei Leibstandarte.jpg|thumb|December 1935 parade for [[Adolf Hitler]] at the LSSAH Barracks. [[Sepp Dietrich]] is on the far right]]\n\nOn 13 April 1934, ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] ordered the ''Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler'' (LAH) to be renamed \"''Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler''\" (LSSAH). Himmler inserted the SS initials into the name to make it clear that the unit was independent from the SA or army.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=17, 19}} The LSSAH was considered a \"National Socialist\" unit, which eventually grew into an elite Panzer [[military division|division]] of the Waffen-SS.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=xxv, 12, 18, 58, 202, 203, 285}} Although nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=19, 33}}\n\nDuring 1934, ''[[Stabschef (SA)|Stabschef-SA]]'' Ernst R\u00f6hm continued to push for greater political influence for his already powerful SA. Hitler decided that the SA had to be eliminated as an independent political force and ordered the LSSAH to prepare for the action. The LSSAH formed two companies under the control of [[J\u00fcrgen Wagner]] and Otto Reich, these formations were moved to Munich on 30 June.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=22, 23}}\n\nHitler ordered all SA leaders to attend a meeting at the Hanselbauer Hotel in [[Bad Wiessee]], near Munich. Hitler along with Sepp Dietrich and a unit from the LSSAH travelled to Bad Wiessee to personally oversee R\u00f6hm's arrest on 30 June. Later at around 17:00 hours, Dietrich received orders from Hitler for the LSSAH to form an \"execution squad\" and go to Stadelheim prison where certain SA leaders were being held.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=22, 23}} There in the prison courtyard, the LSSAH firing squad shot five SA generals and an SA colonel.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=23}} Additional alleged \"traitors\" were shot in Berlin by a unit of the ''Leibstandarte''.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=24}} On 1 July Hitler finally agreed with G\u00f6ring and Himmler that R\u00f6hm should be executed.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=309\u2013314}} In what the Nazis called the R\u00f6hm Putsch, but otherwise came to be known as the [[Night of the Long Knives]], companies of the LSSAH, together with the [[Gestapo]] and G\u00f6ring's ''Landespolizeigruppe'', performed [[Death Squad]] actions.

The LSSAH again took the lead; by now its strength was reduced to just 77 armored vehicles. The 2nd SS Panzergrenadier Regiment, supported by several tanks, advanced up the road to Prokhorovka against heavy resistance. By midday, the infantry had cleared the Komsomolets State Farm and begun the attack on Hill 241.6, which they secured shortly after nightfall on 10 July.\n\nThe next day the advance resumed, with the division capturing Oktiabr'skii State Farm and Hill 252.2 in heavy fighting against Soviet [[Paratroop]]s of the [[Soviet 9th Guards Airborne Division|9th Guards Airborne Division]]. On 12 July, the Soviets threw the [[5th Guards Tank Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Tank Army]] into a [[Battle of Prokhorovka|counterattack near Prokhorovka]]. Two tank [[corps]] faced the LSSAH, hitting the Germans around Oktiabr'skii State Farm and Hill 252.2. In the ensuing fighting, the Germans inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviets. The Soviet counterattack had stalled the German advance, and the division was forced to fall back to Oktiabr'skii. The Soviet 5th Guards Tank Army lost 300 tanks destroyed and further 300 damaged on 12 July.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Fighting continued the next day, but the focus of the Soviet attack had then shifted to the Totenkopf, on the left of the LSSAH.\n\nWith the battle at Prokhorovka still in the balance, Soviet High Command launched an offensive of their own, [[Operation Kutuzov]], near [[Oryol|Orel]] causing Hitler to order the cessation of Citadel. The II SS Panzer Corps was pulled back. The LSSAH was ordered out of the line, having suffered 2,753 casualties including 474 killed.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=14}} Eleven tanks were also lost during Citadel. The division was sent to Italy to help stabilize the situation there caused by the deposal of [[Benito Mussolini]] by the [[Pietro Badoglio|Badoglio]] government and the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] which began on the night of 9\u201310 July 1943.

The LSSAH was given the task of guarding several vital road and rail junctions in the area of [[Trento]]-[[Verona]]. After several weeks, the division was moved to the [[Parma]]-[[Reggio Emilia|Reggio]] area. During this period, the ''Leibstandarte'' was involved in several skirmishes with [[Partisan (military)|partisan]]s. With Italy having announced an [[Armistice with Italy|armistice with the Allies]] of 8 September 1943, the division was ordered to begin disarming nearby Italian units.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=15}} This went smoothly, with the exception of brief, bloody fights with Italian troops stationed in [[Parma]], [[Cremona]] and [[Piacenza]] on 9 September.

On 25 March, the 1st Panzer Army was encircled in the [[Kamenets-Podolsky pocket]].

The operation was preceded by a three-hour bombing by 2,500 aircraft.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=174}} The Division strength prior to Goodwood was reported as 59 Panzer IVs, 46 Panthers and 35 StuG IIIs.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=172}}\n\nII/1st SS Panzer Regiment, located near Garcelles, received orders to attack the British at [[Soliers]]. While moving its 13 Panthers towards Bourgu\u00e9bus, the unit engaged 60 British tanks, destroying 20 of them and capturing Soliers. Around 12:00, the Panther Battalion, I/1st SS Panzer regiment, was engaged in combat with the [[British 29th Armoured Brigade]] of the [[British 11th Armoured Division]]. The body of the LSSAH was rushed to the front from [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]], where it was being held in reserve. It counterattacked at 17:00, together with the [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Division]], and halted the British offensive on the left front.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=178}}\n\nThe British resumed their assault at around 13:00 on 19 July, having brought up reinforcements to continue the attack. They overran some of the forward German units and approached Bourgu\u00e9bus Ridge at 16:00. They came under fire from Panthers of the ''Leibstandarte'', who had taken up positions on the ridge. Reinforcements of the [[12th SS Panzer Division]] arrived at the right flank at around 15:00. The Canadians attacked next in the [[Battle of Verri\u00e8res Ridge]] and [[Operation Spring]] (see map), where the LSSAH came up against a number of Allied divisions, including the [[Guards Armoured Division]], [[British 7th Armoured Division|7th Armoured]], [[2nd Canadian Infantry Division|2nd]] and [[3rd Canadian Infantry Division|3rd Canadian]] Divisions.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=192}}\n\n===Operation L\u00fcttich===\n{{Main|Operation L\u00fcttich}}\n\nOn 25 July 1944, US forces under General [[Omar Bradley]] succeeded in breaking through the German defenses as part of [[Operation Cobra]] and entered Brittany.{{sfn |Van der Vat|2003|p=163}}{{sfn|D&#39;Este|1984|p=410}} Hitler forbade any retreat, and ordered a counteroffensive, codenamed [[Operation L\u00fcttich]],{{sfn|Lewin|1978|p=38}} by the XLVII Panzer Corps, consisting of the [[2nd Panzer Division]], part of the LSSAH, the [[SS Division Das Reich]] and the [[116th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|116th Panzer Division]].{{sfn |Van der Vat|2003|p=164}} The plan for the attack to hit the [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th Infantry Division]] east of Mortain, then cut through American defenses to reach the coast.{{sfn |Van der Vat|2003|p=163}} The US response was aided by [[Ultra]] intelligence, which had revealed the plans for Operation L\u00fcttich by 4 August.{{sfn|D&#39;Este|1984|p=415}} As a result, Bradley was able to obtain air support from both the US 9th Air Force and the [[RAF]].{{sfn|D&#39;Este|1984|p=416}}\n\n[[File:St.-Lambert-surrender.jpg|thumb|German soldiers surrender in St. Lambert on 19 August 1944.]]\nThe LSSAH and other divisions went on the attack on 7 August. The 1st SS Panzer Regiment, along with two battalions of motorized infantry, one combat engineer company, and the division's flak battalion, were used for the attack. The weather was not suitable for flying that morning, which disadvantaged the Allies. The SS Division Das Reich recaptured Mortain, and an armored battle group under [[Joachim Peiper]] reached Bourlopin, but had to halt due to US counterattacks and air strikes.\n\nThe much-reduced division was encircled in the [[Falaise pocket]] by US, Canadian, and Polish forces. Some LSSAH units broke out of the pocket on 22 August, leaving behind all their tanks and artillery. The division sustained 5,000 casualties during the Normandy campaign.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|pp=262\u2013264}} During their retreat from France, members of the LSSAH and the SS Division Hitlerjugend division murdered 34 French civilians in the towns of [[Tavaux]] and [[Plomion]].{{sfn|Beevor|2010|p=446}}\n\n===Ardennes Offensive===\n{{Main|Battle of the Bulge}}\n[[File:Kampfgruppe Knittel's troops on the road to Stavelot.jpg|thumb|Kampfgruppe Knittel's troops on the road to [[Stavelot]] to support Peiper]]\n\nThe Ardennes Offensive (16 December 1944 \u2013 25 January 1945) was a major German offensive launched through the forested [[Ardennes|Ardennes Mountains region]] of Belgium, France and Luxembourg..

At 12:30, near the hamlet of Baugnez, on the height halfway between the town of [[Malmedy]] and Ligneuville, Peiper's ''Kampfgruppe'' encountered a convoy of the [[285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion]], [[7th Armored Division (United States)|US 7th Armored Division]].{{sfn|Cole|1965|p=75}}{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=216}} After a brief battle the Americans surrendered.

Many of the perpetrators were sentenced to hang, but the sentences were commuted. Peiper himself was imprisoned for eleven years for his role in the killings.{{sfn|Parker|2012|p=278}}\n\nPeiper entered Stavelot on 18 December but encountered fierce resistance from the American defenders. Unable to defeat them, he left a smaller support force in town and headed for the bridge at [[Trois-Ponts]] with the bulk of his strength, but by the time he reached it, retreating US engineers had already destroyed it. Peiper then headed for the village of [[La Gleize]] and from there on to [[Stoumont]]. There, as Peiper approached, engineers blew up the bridge. US defenders were entrenched and ready. Peiper's men were cut off from the main German force and supplies when the Americans recaptured the poorly defended Stavelot on 19 December. As their situation in Stoumont was becoming hopeless, Peiper decided to pull back to La Gleize where he set up his defenses, waiting for the German relief force. Since no such force was able to penetrate the US line, Peiper decided to break out back to the German lines on 23 December. The men of the ''Kampfgruppe'' abandoned their vehicles and heavy equipment, although most of the men were able to escape.\n\nWith each passing day, enemy resistance stiffened and the advance was eventually halted on all fronts. The German High Command ordered that a renewed attack begin on 1 January 1945. Yet by this time, the Allies had regrouped their forces and were ready to repulse any attack launched by the Germans. The operation formally ended on 27 January 1945, and three days later Mohnke was promoted to SS-''[[Brigadef\u00fchrer]]''. LSSAH and the I SS Panzer Corps were then transferred to Hungary to bolster the crumbling situation there. Mohnke was wounded in an air raid.{{sfn|Fischer|2008|p=41}} In his place, SS-''Brigadef\u00fchrer'' [[Otto Kumm]] was appointed the new Division Commander as of 15 February 1945.{{sfn|Fischer|2008|p=41}}\n\n====Killing of Wereth 11====\n{{main|Wereth 11 Massacre}}\n[[File:Wereth 11 Memorial.JPG|thumb|upright=.5|right|Memorial to the ''Wereth 11'']]\nDuring Battle of the Bulge, troops from ''3./SS-PzAA1 LSSAH'' captured eleven African-American soldiers from the [[333rd Artillery Battalion (United States)|333rd Artillery Battalion]] in the hamlet of Wereth.

It began in great secrecy on 6 March 1945. The German forces launched attacks in Hungary near [[Lake Balaton]]. This area included some of the last oil reserves still available to the Axis. The operation involved many German units withdrawn from the failed Ardennes Offensive on the Western Front, including the [[6th Panzer Army|6th SS Panzer Army]] and the LSSAH. Operation Spring Awakening was a failure for the German side. Within a week, the early gains were halted by massive counter-attacks by Soviet forces. The overwhelming numerical superiority of the Red Army made any defense impossible, yet Hitler somehow had believed victory was attainable.{{sfn|Ziemke|1968|p=450}}\n\nAfter the failure of Operation Spring Awakening, Sepp Dietrich's 6th SS Panzer Army retreated in stages to the [[Vienna]] area.

The Germans could not hold Vienna, which fell to the Soviet forces on 13 April.{{sfn|Dollinger|1967|p=198}}\n\nThis defeat resulted in the ''\u00c4rmelstreifen'' (Cuff Titles Order) or \"armband order\", which was issued by Hitler to the commander of the 6th SS Panzer Army, Sepp Dietrich. Hitler claimed that the troops  \"did not fight as the situation demanded.\"{{sfn|Dollinger|1967|p=198}} As a mark of disgrace, Hitler ordered the Waffen-SS units involved to remove their [[cuff title]]s (German: ''\u00c4rmelstreifen'').

Loki is a god on the streets and a demon in the sheets. By the [[j\u00f6tunn]] [[Angrbo\u00f0a]], Loki is the father of [[Hel (being)|Hel]], the wolf [[Fenrir]], and the world serpent [[J\u00f6rmungandr]]. By his wife [[Sigyn]], Loki is the father of [[Narfi and Nari|Narfi and/or Nari]]. By the stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], Loki is the mother\u2014giving birth in the form of a [[mare]]\u2014to the eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]]. In addition, Loki is referred to as the father of [[V\u00e1li]] in ''[[Prose Edda]]'', though this source also refers to [[Odin]] as the father of V\u00e1li twice, and V\u00e1li is found mentioned as a Son of Loki only once.\n\nLoki's relation with the gods varies by source; Loki sometimes assists the gods and sometimes behaves in a malicious manner towards them. Loki is a [[Shapeshifting|shape shifter]] and in separate incidents he appears in the form of a [[salmon]], a [[mare]], a [[Fly (animal)|fly]], and possibly an elderly woman named [[\u00de\u00f6kk]] (Old Norse 'thanks'). Loki's positive relations with the gods end with his role in engineering the death of the god [[Baldr]] and Loki is eventually bound by V\u00e1li with the entrails of one of his sons. In both the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', the goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]] is responsible for placing a serpent above him while he is bound. The serpent drips venom from above him that Sigyn collects into a bowl; however, she must empty the bowl when it is full, and the venom that drips in the meantime causes Loki to writhe in pain, thereby causing earthquakes. With the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]], Loki is foretold to slip free from his bonds and to fight against the gods among the forces of the [[J\u00f6tunn|j\u00f6tnar]], at which time he will encounter the god [[Heimdallr]] and the two will slay each other.\n\nLoki is referred to in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the ''Prose Edda'' and ''[[Heimskringla]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]; the [[Rune Poems|Norwegian Rune Poems]], in the poetry of [[skald]]s, and in Scandinavian folklore. Loki may be depicted on the [[Snaptun Stone]], the [[Loki#Kirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross|Kirkby Stephen Stone]], and the [[Gosforth Cross]]. Loki's origins and role in Norse mythology, which some scholars have described as that of a [[trickster god]], have been much debated by scholars. Loki has been depicted in or is referenced in a variety of media in modern popular culture.\n\n==Etymology, and alternative names==\nThe [[etymology]] of the name ''Loki'' has been extensively debated. The name has at times been associated with the Old Norse word ''logi'' ('flame'), but there seems not to be a sound linguistic basis for this. Rather, the later Scandinavian variants of the name (such as Faroese ''Lokki'', Danish ''Lokkemand'', Norwegian ''Loke'' and ''Lokke'', Swedish ''Luki'' and ''Luku'', along with Finnish ''Lukki'') point to an origin in the Germanic root *''luk''-, which denoted things to do with loops (like knots, hooks, closed-off rooms, and locks). This corresponds with usages such as the Swedish ''lokkan\u00e4t'' and Faroese ''Lokkanet'' ('cobweb', literally 'Lokke's web') and Faroese ''lokki''~''grindalokki''~''grindalokkur'' ('[[Crane fly|daddy-long-legs]]', associated in pre-modern folk-taxonomy with spiders). Some Eastern Swedish traditions referring to the same figure use forms in ''n''- like ''Nokk(e)'', but this corresponds to the *''luk''- etymology insofar as those dialects consistently used a different root, Germanic *''hnuk''-, in contexts where western varieties used *''luk''-: \"''nokke'' corresponds to ''n\u00f8kkel''\" ('key' in Eastern Scandinavian) \"as ''loki''~''lokke'' to ''lykil''\" ('key' in Western Scandinavian).<ref>Eldar Heide, \"[http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/Loke-artikkel%20til%20nettsida.pdf Loki, the ''V\u00e4tte'', and the Ash Lad: A Study Combining Old Scandinavian and Late Material] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222308/http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/Loke-artikkel%20til%20nettsida.pdf |date=2013-12-02 }}\", ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'', 7 (2011), 63\u2013106 (pp. 65\u201375, quoting p. 75), {{DOI|10.1484/J.VMS.1.102616}}.</ref> While it has been suggested that this association with closing could point to Loki's apocalyptic role at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]],{{sfnp|Simek|2007|p=195}} \"there is quite a bit of evidence that Loki in premodern society was thought to be the causer of knots/tangles/loops, or himself a knot/tangle/loop.

The poem begins with a prose introduction detailing that [[\u00c6gir]], a figure associated with the sea, is hosting a feast in his hall for a number of the gods and [[elf|elves]]. There, the gods praise \u00c6gir's servers [[Fimafeng]] and [[Eldir]]. Loki \"could not bear to hear that,\" and kills the servant Fimafeng. In response, the gods grab their shields, shrieking at Loki, and chase him out of the hall and to the woods. The gods then return to the hall, and continue drinking.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n;Entrance and rejection\nLoki comes out of the woods, and meets Eldir outside of the hall. Loki greets Eldir (and the poem itself begins) with a demand that Eldir tell him what the gods are discussing over their ale inside the hall. Eldir responds that they discuss their \"weapons and their prowess in war\" and yet no one there has anything friendly to say about Loki. Loki says that he will go into the feast, and that, before the end of the feast, he will induce quarrelling among the gods, and \"mix their [[mead]] with malice.\" Eldir responds that \"if shouting and fighting you pour out on\" to the gods, \"they'll wipe it off on you.\" Loki then enters the hall, and everyone there falls silent upon noticing him.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=85}}\n\n;Re-entrance and insults\nBreaking the silence, Loki says that, thirsty, he had come to these halls from a long way away to ask the gods for a drink of \"the famous mead.\" Calling the gods arrogant, Loki asks why they are unable to speak, and demands that they assign him a seat and a place for him at the feast, or tell him to leave. The [[skald]]ic god [[Bragi]] is the first to respond to Loki by telling him that Loki will not have a seat and place assigned to him by the gods at the feast, for the gods know what men they should invite.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=86}} Loki does not respond to Bragi directly, but instead directs his attention to Odin, and states:\n<blockquote>\n:Do you remember, Odin, when in bygone days\n:we mixed our blood together?\n:You said you would never drink ale\n:unless it were brought to both of us.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=86}}\n</blockquote>\nOdin then asks his silent son [[V\u00ed\u00f0arr]] to sit up, so that Loki (here referred to as the \"wolf's father\") may sit at the feast, and so that he may not speak words of blame to the gods in \u00c6gir's hall. V\u00ed\u00f0arr stands and pours a drink for Loki. Prior to drinking, Loki declaims a toast to the gods, with a specific exception for Bragi. Bragi responds that he will give a horse, sword, and ring from his possessions so that he does not repay the gods \"with hatred.\" Loki responds that Bragi will always be short of all of these things, accusing him of being \"wary of war\" and \"shy of shooting.\" Bragi responds that, were they outside of \u00c6gir's hall, Bragi would be holding Loki's head as a reward for his lies. Loki replies that Bragi is brave when seated, calling him a \"bench-ornament,\" and that Bragi would run away when troubled by an angry, spirited man.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=87}}\n\nThe goddess [[I\u00f0unn]] interrupts, asking Bragi, as a service to his relatives and adopted relatives, not to say words of blame to Loki in \u00c6gir's hall. Loki tells I\u00f0unn to be silent, calling her the most \"man-crazed\" of all women, and saying that she placed her washed, bright arms around her brother's slayer. I\u00f0unn says that she won't say words of blame in \u00c6gir's hall, and affirms that she quietened Bragi, who was made talkative by beer, and that she doesn't want the two of them to fight. The goddess [[Gefjun]] asks why the two gods must fight, saying that Loki knows that he is joking, and that \"all living things love him.\" Loki responds to Gefjun by stating that Gefjun's heart was once seduced by a \"white boy\" who gave her a jewel, and who Gefjun laid her thigh over.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=87\u201388}}\n\nOdin says that Loki must be insane to make Gefjun his enemy, as her wisdom about the fates of men may equal Odin's own. Loki says that Odin does a poor job in handing out honor in war to men, and that he's often given victory to the faint-hearted. Odin responds that even if this is true, Loki (in a story otherwise unattested) once spent eight winters beneath the earth as a woman milking cows, and during this time bore children. Odin declares this perverse. Loki counters that Odin once practiced [[sei\u00f0r]] (a type of sorcery) on the island of ''Samsey'' (now [[Sams\u00f8]], Denmark), and, appearing as a wizard, traveled among mankind, which Loki condemns as perverse.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=88\u201389}}\n\n[[Frigg]], a major goddess and Odin's wife, says that what Loki and Odin did in the ancient past should not be spoken of in front of others, and that ancient matters should always remain hidden. Loki brings up that Frigg is the daughter of [[Fj\u00f6rgyn and Fj\u00f6rgynn|Fj\u00f6rgyn]], a personification of the earth, and that she had once taken Odin's brothers [[Vili and V\u00e9]] into her embrace. Frigg responds that if there was a boy like her now-deceased son [[Baldr]] in the hall, Loki would not be able to escape from the wrath of the gods. Loki reminds Frigg that he is responsible for the death of her son Baldr.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=89}}\n\nThe goddess [[Freyja]] declares that Loki must be mad, stating that Frigg knows all fate, yet she does not speak it. Loki claims each of the gods and elves that are present have been Freyja's lover. Freyja replies that Loki is lying, that he just wants to \"yelp about wicked things\" that gods and goddesses are furious with him, and that he will go home thwarted. In response, Loki calls Freyja a malicious witch, and claims that Freyja was once astride her brother [[Freyr]], when all of the other laughing gods surprised her and Freyja then farted. This scenario is otherwise unattested. [[Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r]] (Freyja and Freyr's father) says that it is harmless for a woman to have a lover or \"someone else\" beside her husband, and that what is surprising is a \"pervert god coming here who has borne children.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=89\u201390}}\n\nLoki tells Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to be silent, recalling Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's status as once having been a hostage from the [[Vanir]] to the [[\u00c6sir]] during the [[\u00c6sir-Vanir War]], that the \"daughters of Hymir\" once used Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r \"as a pisspot,\" urinating in his mouth (an otherwise unattested comment). Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r responds that this was his reward when he was sent as a hostage to the \u00c6sir, and that he fathered his son (Freyr), whom no one hates, and is considered a prince of the \u00c6sir. Loki tells Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to maintain his moderation, and that he won't keep it secret any longer that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r fathered this son with [[Sister-wife of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r|his sister]] (unnamed), although one would expect him to be worse than he turned out.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nThe god [[Tyr]] defends Freyr, to which Loki replies that Tyr should be silent, for Tyr cannot \"deal straight with people,\" and points out that it was Loki's son, the wolf Fenrir, who tore Tyr's hand off. (According to the prose introduction to the poem Tyr is now one-handed from having his arm bitten off by Loki's son Fenrir while Fenrir was bound.) Tyr responds that while he may have lost a hand, Loki has lost the wolf, and trouble has come to them both. Further, that Fenrir must now wait in shackles until the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Loki tells Tyr to be silent a second time, and states that Tyr's wife (otherwise unattested) had a son by Loki, and that Tyr never received any compensation for this \"injury,\" further calling him a \"wretch.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=91}}\n\nFreyr himself interrupts at this point, and says that he sees a wolf lying before a river mouth, and that, unless Loki is immediately silent, like the wolf, Loki shall also be bound until [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Loki retorts that Freyr purchased his consort [[Ger\u00f0r]] with gold, having given away his sword, which he will lack at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. [[Byggvir]] (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that if he had as noble a lineage and as an honorable a seat as Freyr, he would grind down Loki, and make all of his limbs lame. Loki refers to Byggvir in terms of a dog, and says that Byggvir is always found at Freyr's ears, or twittering beneath a grindstone. Byggvir says that he's proud to be here by all the gods and men, and that he's said to be speedy. Loki tells him to be silent, that Byggvir does not know how to apportion food among men, and that he hides among the straw and [[dais]] when men go to battle.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=91\u201392}}\n\nThe god [[Heimdallr]] says that Loki is drunk and witless, and asks Loki why he won't stop speaking. Loki tells Heimdallr to be silent, that he was fated a \"hateful life,\" that Heimdallr must always have a muddy back, and serve as watchman of the gods. The goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]] says that while Loki now appears light-hearted and \"playing\" with his \"tail-wagging,\" he will soon be bound with his ice-cold son's guts on a sharp rock by the gods. Loki says that, even if this is his fate, that he was \"first and foremost\" with the other gods at the killing of Ska\u00f0i's father, [[\u00dejazi]]. Ska\u00f0i says that, with these events in mind, \"baneful advice\" will always come from her \"sanctuaries and plains\" to Loki. Loki says that Ska\u00f0i was once gentler in speech to him (referring to himself as the \"son of [[Laufey]]\") when Ska\u00f0i once invited him to her bed (an event that is unattested elsewhere), and that such events must be mentioned if they are to recall \"shameful deeds.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=91\u201393}}\n\n[[Sif]], wife of [[Thor]], goes forth and pours Loki a glass of mead into a crystal cup in a prose narrative. Continuing the poem, Sif welcomes Loki and invites him to take a crystal cup filled with ancient mead, and says that among the children of the \u00c6sir, she is singularly blameless. Loki \"takes the horn,\" drinks it, and says that she would be, if it were so, and states that Sif had a lover beside Thor, namely, Loki himself (an event that is otherwise unattested). [[Beyla]] (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that all of the mountains are shaking, that she thinks Thor must be on his way home, and when Thor arrives he will bring peace to those that quarrel there. Loki tells Beyla to be silent, that she is \"much imbued with malice,\" that no worse female has ever been among the \"\u00c6sir's children,\" and calling her a bad \"serving-wench.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=94}}\n\n;The arrival of Thor and the bondage of Loki\n[[File:Loki leaves the hall and threatens the \u00c6sir with fire by Fr\u00f8lich.jpg|thumb|''Loki threatens the \u00c6sir with fire'' (1895) by [[Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich]]]]\n[[Image:Louis Huard - The Punishment of Loki.jpg|thumb|''The Punishment of Loki'' by Louis Huard]]\nThor arrives, and tells Loki to be silent, referring to him as an \"evil creature,\" stating that with his hammer [[Mj\u00f6llnir]] he will silence Loki by hammering his head from his shoulders. Acknowledging that Thor has arrived, Loki asks Thor why he is raging, and says that Thor won't be so bold to fight against the wolf when he swallows Odin at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Thor again tells Loki to be silent, and threatens him with Mj\u00f6llnir, adding that he will throw Loki \"up on the roads to the east,\" and thereafter no one will be able to see Loki. Loki states that Thor should never brag of his journeys to the east, claiming that there Thor crouched cowering in the thumb of a glove, mockingly referring to him as a \"hero,\" and adding that such behaviour was unlike Thor. Thor responds by telling Loki to be silent, threatening him with Mj\u00f6llnir, and adding that every one of Loki's bones will be broken with it. Loki says he intends to live for a long while yet despite Thor's threats, and taunts Thor about an encounter Thor once had with the [[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki|Skr\u00fdmir]] ([[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki]] in disguise). Thor again commands Loki to be silent, threatens Loki with Mj\u00f6llnir, and says he will send Loki to [[Hel (location)|Hel]], below the gates of [[N\u00e1grind]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nIn response to Thor, Loki says that he \"spoke before the \u00c6sir,\" and \"before the sons of the \u00c6sir\" what his \"spirit urged\" him to say, yet before Thor alone he will leave, as he knows that Thor does strike. Loki ends the poetic verses of ''Lokasenna'' with a final stanza:\n<blockquote>\n:Ale you brewed, \u00c6gir, and you will never again hold a feast;\n:all your possessions which are here inside\u2014\n:may flame play over them,\n:and may your back be burnt!{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=95}}\n</blockquote>\nFollowing this final stanza a prose section details that after Loki left the hall, he disguised himself as a [[salmon]] and hid in the waterfall of [[Franangrsfors]], where the \u00c6sir caught him. The narrative continues that Loki was bound with the entrails of his son [[Narfi (son of Loki)|Nari]], and his son [[Narfi (son of Loki)|Narfi]] changed into a wolf. Ska\u00f0i fastened a venomous snake over Loki's face, and from it poison dripped. Sigyn, Loki's wife, sat with him holding a basin beneath the dripping venom, yet when the basin became full, she carried the poison away; and during this time the poison dripped on to Loki, causing him to writhe with such violence that all of the earth shook from the force, resulting in what are now known as earthquakes.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=95\u201396}}\n\n====''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a''====\n[[Image:Loki's flight to J\u00f6tunheim.jpg|thumb|''Loki's flight to J\u00f6tunheim'' (1908) by [[W. G. Collingwood]]]]\n[[Image:Ah, what a lovely maid it is! by Elmer Boyd Smith.jpg|thumb|''Ah, what a lovely maid it is!'' (1902) by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]].]]\nIn the poem ''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a'', Thor wakes and finds that his powerful hammer, [[Mj\u00f6llnir]], is missing. Thor turns to Loki first, and tells him that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two then go to the court of the goddess [[Freyja]], and Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak so that he may attempt to find Mj\u00f6llnir. Freyja agrees, saying she'd lend it even if it were made of silver and gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=97}}\n\nIn [[J\u00f6tunheimr]], the j\u00f6tunn [[\u00derymr]] sits on a [[tumulus|burial mound]], plaiting golden collars for his female dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses. \u00derymr sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the [[\u00c6sir]] and the [[Elf#Norse mythology|Elves]]; why is Loki alone in the J\u00f6tunheimr? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the \u00c6sir: that Thor's hammer, Mj\u00f6llnir, is gone. \u00derymr says that he has hidden Mj\u00f6llnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved if Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from J\u00f6tunheimr and back to the court of the gods.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=97\u201398}}\n\nThor asks Loki if his efforts were successful, and that Loki should tell him while he's still in the air as \"tales often escape a sitting man, and the man lying down often barks out lies.\" Loki states that it was indeed an effort, and also a success, for he has discovered that \u00derymr has the hammer, but that it cannot be retrieved unless Freyja is brought to \u00derymr as his wife. The two return to Freyja, and tell her to dress herself in a bridal head dress, as they will drive her to J\u00f6tunheimr. Freyja, indignant and angry, goes into a rage, causing all of the halls of the \u00c6sir to tremble in her anger, and her necklace, the famed [[Br\u00edsingamen]], falls from her. Freyja pointedly refuses.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=98}}\n\nAs a result, the gods and goddesses meet and hold a [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god [[Heimdallr]] puts forth the suggestion that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women's clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace Br\u00edsingamen. Thor rejects the idea, and Loki (here described as \"son of [[Laufey]]\") interjects that this will be the only way to get back Mj\u00f6llnir, and points out that without Mj\u00f6llnir, the j\u00f6tnar will be able to invade and settle in [[Asgard]]. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to J\u00f6tunheimr together.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=99}}\n\nAfter riding together in Thor's [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str|goat-driven chariot]], the two, disguised, arrive in J\u00f6tunheimr. \u00derymr commands the j\u00f6tnar in his hall to spread straw on the benches, for Freyja has arrived to be his wife. \u00derymr recounts his treasured animals and objects, stating that Freyja was all that he was missing in his wealth.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=100}}\n\nEarly in the evening, the disguised Loki and Thor meet with \u00derymr and the assembled j\u00f6tnar. Thor eats and drinks ferociously, consuming entire animals and three casks of [[mead]]. \u00derymr finds the behaviour at odds with his impression of Freyja, and Loki, sitting before \u00derymr and appearing as a \"very shrewd maid\", makes the excuse that \"Freyja's\" behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. \u00derymr then lifts \"Freyja's\" veil and wants to kiss \"her\" until catching the terrifying eyes staring back at him, seemingly burning with fire. Loki states that this is because \"Freyja\" had not slept for eight nights in her eagerness.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=100}}\n\nThe \"wretched sister\" of the j\u00f6tnar appears, asks for a bridal gift from \"Freyja\", and the j\u00f6tnar bring out Mj\u00f6llnir to \"sanctify the bride\", to lay it on her lap, and marry the two by \"the hand\" of the goddess [[V\u00e1r]]. Thor laughs internally when he sees the hammer, takes hold of it, strikes \u00derymr, beats all of the j\u00f6tnar, and kills the \"older sister\" of the j\u00f6tnar.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=101}}\n\n====''Reginsm\u00e1l''====\nLoki appears in both prose and the first six stanzas of the poem ''Reginsm\u00e1l''. The prose introduction to ''Reginsm\u00e1l'' details that, while the hero [[Sigurd]] was being fostered by [[Regin]], son of [[Hreidmar]], Regin tells him that once the gods Odin, [[H\u0153nir]], and Loki went to Andvara-falls, which contained many fish. Regin, a dwarf, had two brothers; [[Andvari]], who gained food by spending time in the Andvara-falls in the form of a [[Esox|pike]], and [[\u00d3tr]], who would often go to the Andvara-falls in the form of an otter.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=151}}\n\nWhile the three gods are at the falls, \u00d3tr (in the form of an otter) catches a salmon and eats it on a river bank, his eyes shut, when Loki hits and kills him with a stone. The gods think that this is great, and flay the skin from the otter to make a bag. That night, the three gods stay with Hreidmar (the father of Regin, Andvari, and the now-dead \u00d3tr) and show him their catches, including the skin of the otter. Upon seeing the skin, Regin and Hreidmar \"seized them and made them ransom their lives\" in exchange for filling the otterskin bag the gods had made with gold and covering the exterior of the bag with red gold.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=151}}\n\nLoki is sent to retrieve the gold, and Loki goes to the goddess [[R\u00e1n]], borrows her net, and then goes back to the Andvara-falls. At the falls, Loki spreads his net before Andvari (who is in the form of a pike), which Andvari jumps into. The stanzas of the poem then begin: Loki mocks Andvari, and tells him that he can save his head by telling Loki where his gold is. Andvari gives some background information about himself, including that he was cursed by a \"[[norns|norn]] of misfortune\" in his \"early days\". Loki responds by asking Andvari \"what requital\" does mankind get if \"they wound each other with words\". Andvari responds that lying men receive a \"terrible requital\": having to wade in the river [[Vadgelmir]], and that their suffering will be long.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\nLoki looks over the gold that Andvari possesses, and after Andvari hands over all of his gold, Andvari holds on to but a single ring; the ring [[Andvarinaut]], which Loki also takes. Andvari, now in the form of a dwarf, goes into a rock, and tells Loki that the gold will result in the death of two brothers, will cause strife between eight princes, and will be useless to everyone.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=152}}\n\nLoki returns, and the three gods give Hreidmar the money from the gold hoard and flatten out the otter skin, stretch out its legs, and heap gold atop it, covering it. Hreidmar looks it over, and notices a single hair that has not been covered. Hreidmar demands that it be covered as well. Odin puts forth the ring Andvarinaut, covering the single hair.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=152}}\n\nLoki states that they have now handed over the gold, and that gold is cursed as Andvari is, and that it will be the death of Hreidmar and Regin both. Hreidmar responds that if he had known this before, he would have taken their lives, yet that he believes those are not yet born whom the curse is intended for, and that he doesn't believe him. Further, with the hoard, he will have red gold for the rest of his life. Hreidmar tells them to leave, and the poem continues without further mention of Loki.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\n====''Baldrs draumar''====\nIn ''Baldr draumar'', Odin has awoken a deceased v\u00f6lva in [[Hel (location)|Hel]], and questions her repeatedly about his son [[Baldr]]'s bad dreams. Loki is mentioned in stanza 14, the final stanza of the poem, where the v\u00f6lva tells Odin to ride home, to be proud of himself, and that no one else will come visit until \"Loki is loose, escaped from his bonds\" and the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=245}}\n\n====''Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0''====\n[[File:Loki finds Gullveigs Heart - John Bauer.jpg|thumb|Loki consumes a roasted heart in a painting (1911) by [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]]]\nLoki is referenced in two stanzas in ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 hin skamma]]'', found within the poem ''[[Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0]]''. The first stanza notes that Loki produced \"the wolf\" with the j\u00f6tunn [[Angrbo\u00f0a]], that Loki himself gave birth to the horse [[Sleipnir]] by the stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], and that Loki (referred to as the \"brother of [[B\u00fdleistr]]\") thirdly gave birth to \"the worst of all marvels\". This stanza is followed by:\n<blockquote>\n:Loki ate some of the heart, the thought-stone of a woman,\n:roasted on a [[Tilia|linden-wood]] fire, he found it half-cooked;\n:Lopt was impregnated by a wicked woman,\n:from whom every ogress on earth is descended.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=258}}\n</blockquote>\nIn the second of the two stanzas, Loki is referred to as ''Lopt''.

High says that Loki's alternative name is ''Lopt'', that he is the son of the male j\u00f6tunn [[F\u00e1rbauti]], his mother is \"[[Laufey|Laufey or N\u00e1l]]\", and his brothers are [[Helblindi]] and [[B\u00fdleistr]]. High describes Loki as \"pleasing and handsome\" in appearance, malicious in character, \"very capricious in behaviour\", and as possessing \"to a greater degree than others\" learned cunning, and \"tricks for every purpose\", often getting the \u00c6sir into trouble, and then getting them out of it with his trickery. Loki's wife is named Sigyn, and they have a son named \"Nari or Narfi\". Otherwise, Loki had three children with the female j\u00f6tunn Angrbo\u00f0a from [[J\u00f6tunheimr]]; the wolf [[Fenrir]], the serpent [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], and the female being [[Hel (being)|Hel]]. The gods realized that these three children were being raised in J\u00f6tunheimr, and expected trouble from them partially due to the nature of Angrbo\u00f0a, but worse yet Loki.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=26\u201327}} In chapter 35, Gangleri comments that Loki produced a \"pretty terrible\"\u2014yet important\u2014family.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=29}}\n\n'''Loki, Sva\u00f0ilfari, and Sleipnir'''\n\nIn chapter 42, High tells a story set \"right at the beginning of the gods' settlement, when the gods at established [[Midgard]] and built [[Valhalla|Val-Hall]].\" The story is about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the [[S\u00f3l (sun)|sun]], and the [[M\u00e1ni|moon]]. After some debate, the gods agree to these conditions, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons without the help of any man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed. The stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks\u2014to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Sva\u00f0ilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of [[Sumarr and Vetr|summer]], the builder is nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene, and figure out who is responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki is to blame (here referred to as ''Loki Laufeyjarson''\u2014his surname derived from his mother's name, ''Laufey'').{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=35}}\n\n[[Image:Loki and Svadilfari by Hardy.jpg|thumb|''Loki and [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]]'' (1909) by Dorothy Hardy]]\nThe gods declare that Loki deserves a horrible death if he cannot find a scheme that will cause the builder to forfeit his payment, and threaten to attack him. Loki, afraid, swears oaths that he will devise a scheme to cause the builder to forfeit the payment, whatever it may cost himself. That night, the builder drives out to fetch stone with his stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari, and out from a wood runs a mare. The mare neighs at Sva\u00f0ilfari, and \"realizing what kind of horse it was,\" Sva\u00f0ilfari becomes frantic, neighs, tears apart his tackle, and runs towards the mare. The mare runs to the wood, Sva\u00f0ilfari follows, and the builder chases after. The two horses run around all night, causing the building to be halted and the builder is then unable to regain the previous momentum of his work.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=36}}\n\nThe builder goes into a rage, and when the \u00c6sir realize that the builder is a [[hrimthurs]], they disregard their previous oaths with the builder, and call for Thor. Thor arrives, and subsequently kills the builder by smashing the builder's skull into shards with the hammer Mj\u00f6llnir. However, Loki \"[[sexual intercourse|had such dealings]]\" with Sva\u00f0ilfari that \"[[Pregnancy|somewhat later]]\" Loki gives birth to a gray [[foal]] with eight legs; the horse [[Sleipnir]]\u2014\"the best horse among gods and men.\"{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=36}}\n\n'''Loki, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki, and Logi'''\n\nIn chapter 44, [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|Third]] reluctantly relates a tale where Thor and Loki are riding in Thor's chariot, which is pulled by his [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str|two goats]]. Loki and Thor stop at the house of a peasant farmer, and there they are given lodging for a night. Thor slaughters his goats, prepares them, puts them in a pot, and Loki and Thor sit down for their evening meal. Thor invites the peasant family who own the farm to share with him the meal he has prepared, but warns them not to break the bones. Afterward, at the suggestion of Loki, the peasant child [[\u00dej\u00e1lfi]] sucks the [[bone marrow]] from one of the goat bones, and when Thor goes to resurrect the goats, he finds one of the goats to be lame. In their terror, the family atones to Thor by giving Thor their son \u00dej\u00e1lfi and their daughter [[R\u00f6skva]].{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=37\u201338}}\n[[File:I am the giant Skrymir by Elmer Boyd Smith.jpg|thumb|''I am the giant [[Skrymir]]'' by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]]]]\nMinus the goats, Thor, Loki, and the two children continue east until they arrive at a vast forest in [[J\u00f6tunheimr]]. They continue through the woods until dark. The four seek shelter for the night. They encounter an immense building. Finding shelter in a side room, they experience earthquakes through the night. The earthquakes cause all four but Thor, who grips his hammer in preparation of defense, to be fearful. The building turns out to be the huge glove of [[Skrymir]], who has been snoring throughout the night, causing what seemed to be earthquakes. All four sleep beneath an oak tree near Skrymir in fear.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nThor wakes up in the middle of the night, and a series of events occur where Thor twice attempts to kill the sleeping Skr\u00fdmir with his hammer. Skr\u00fdmir awakes after each attempt, only to say that he detected an acorn falling on his head or that he wonders if bits of tree from the branches above have fallen on top of him. The second attempt awakes Skr\u00fdmir. Skr\u00fdmir gives them advice; if they are going to be cocky at the keep of [[\u00datgar\u00f0ar|\u00datgar\u00f0r]] it would be better for them to turn back now, for [[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki]]'s men there won't put up with it. Skr\u00fdmir throws his knapsack onto his back and abruptly goes into the forest. High comments that \"there is no report that the \u00c6sir expressed hope for a happy reunion\".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=40}}\n\nThe four travelers continue their journey until midday. They find themselves facing a massive castle in an open area. The castle is so tall that they must bend their heads back to their spines to see above it. At the entrance to the castle is a shut gate, and Thor finds that he cannot open it. Struggling, all four squeeze through the bars of the gate, and continue to a large hall. Inside the great hall are two benches, where many generally large people sit on two benches. The four see \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki, the king of the castle, sitting.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki says that no visitors are allowed to stay unless they can perform a feat. Loki, standing in the rear of the party, is the first to speak, claiming that he can eat faster than anyone. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki comments that this would be a feat indeed, and calls for a being by the name of [[Logi]] to come from the benches. A trencher is fetched, placed on the floor of the hall, and filled with meat. Loki and Logi sit down on opposing sides. The two eat as quickly as they can and meet at the midpoint of the trencher. Loki consumed all of the meat off of the bones on his side, yet Logi had not only consumed his meat, but also the bones and the trencher itself. It was evident to all that Loki had lost. In turn, \u00dej\u00e1lfi races against a figure by the name of Hugi three times and thrice loses.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nThor agrees to compete in a drinking contest but after three immense gulps fails. Thor agrees to lift a large, gray cat in the hall but finds that it arches his back no matter what he does, and that he can raise only a single paw. Thor demands to fight someone in the hall, but the inhabitants say doing so would be demeaning, considering Thor's weakness. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki then calls for his nurse [[Elli]], an old woman. The two wrestle but the harder Thor struggles the more difficult the battle becomes. Thor is finally brought down to a single knee. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki says to Thor that fighting anyone else would be pointless. Now late at night, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki shows the group to their rooms and they are treated with hospitality.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=42\u201344}}\n\nThe next morning the group gets dressed and prepares to leave the keep. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki appears, has his servants prepare a table, and they all merrily eat and drink. As they leave, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki asks Thor how he thought he fared in the contests. Thor says that he is unable to say he did well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki will now speak negatively about him. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki points out that the group has left his keep and says that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had an inkling of what he was dealing with he would never have allowed the group to enter in the first place. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki reveals that all was not what it seemed to the group. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki was in fact the immense Skr\u00fdmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first would have killed Skr\u00fdmir. In reality, Thor's blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nThe contests, too, were an illusion. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki reveals that Loki had actually competed against wildfire itself (''Logi'', Old Norse \"flame\"), \u00dej\u00e1lfi had raced against thought (''Hugi'', Old Norse \"thought\"), Thor's drinking horn had actually reached to the ocean and with his drinks he lowered the ocean level (resulting in [[tide]]s). The cat that Thor attempted to lift was in actuality the world serpent, [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], and everyone was terrified when Thor was able to lift the paw of this \"cat\", for Thor had actually held the great serpent up to the sky. The old woman Thor wrestled was in fact old age (''Elli'', Old Norse \"old age\"), and there is no one that old age cannot bring down. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki tells Thor that it would be better for \"both sides\" if they did not meet again. Upon hearing this, Thor takes hold of his hammer and swings it at \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki but he is gone and so is his castle. Only a wide landscape remains.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=45\u201346}}\n\n===Norwegian rune poem===\n[[File:Runic letter berkanan.svg|thumb|50px|The [[Berkanan|Bjarkan]] [[Runic alphabet|rune]]]]\nLoki is mentioned in stanza 13 of the [[Rune Poems|Norwegian rune poem]] in connection with the [[Younger Futhark]] [[Berkanan|Bjarkan]] [[Runic alphabet|rune]]:\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:<small>Old Norse:</small>\n:Bjarkan er laufgr\u00f8nster l\u00edma;\n::Loki bar fl\u00e6r\u00f0a t\u00edma.{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=26}}\n|\n:<small>Modern English:</small>\n:[[Birch]] has the greenest leaves of any shrub;\n::Loki was fortunate in his deceit.{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=27}}\n|}\n</blockquote>\nAccording to Bruce Dickins, the reference to \"Loki's deceit\" in the poem \"is doubtless to Loki's responsibility for Balder's death.\"{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=27}}\n\n==Archaeological record==\n\n===Snaptun Stone===\n[[Image:Lokistone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Snaptun Stone]] may feature a depiction of Loki]]\nIn 1950, a semi-circular flat stone featuring a depiction of a mustachioed face was discovered on a beach near Snaptun, [[Denmark]]. Made of [[soapstone]] that originated in Norway or Sweden, the depiction was carved around the year 1000 CE and features a face with scarred lips. The figure is identified as Loki due to his lips, considered a reference to a tale recorded in ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'' where [[sons of Ivaldi]] stitch up Loki's lips.{{sfnp|Madsen|1990|p=180}}\n\nThe stone is identified as a [[hearth]] stone; the nozzle of the [[bellows]] would be inserted into the hole in the front of the stone, and the air produced by the bellows pushed flame through the top hole, all the while the bellows were protected from the heat and flame. The stone may point to a connection between Loki and smithing and flames. According to Hans J\u00f8rgen Madsen, the Snaptun Stone is \"the most beautifully made hearth-stone that is known.\" The stone is housed and on display at the [[Moesg\u00e5rd Museum]] near [[Aarhus]], Denmark.{{sfnp|Madsen|1990|p=180}}\n\n===Kirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross===\nA fragmentary late 10th-century cross located in [[St Stephen's Church, Kirkby Stephen]], [[Cumbria]], [[England]], features a bound figure with horns and a beard. This figure is sometimes theorized as depicting the bound Loki.{{sfnp|Orchard|1997|p=105}} Discovered in 1870, the stone consists of yellowish-white [[sandstone]], and now sits at the front of the Kirkby Stephen church. A depiction of a similarly horned and round-shouldered figure was discovered in [[Gainford, County Durham]] and is now housed in the [[Durham Cathedral|Durham Cathedral Library]].{{sfnp|Calverley|1899|p=218}}\n\nThe mid-11th century [[Gosforth Cross]] has been interpreted as featuring various figures from Norse mythology and, like the Kirkby Stephen Stone, is also located in Cumbria. The bottom portion of the west side of the cross features a depiction of a long-haired female, kneeling figure holding an object above another prostrate, bound figure. Above and to their left is a knotted serpent. This has been interpreted as Sigyn soothing the bound Loki.{{sfnp|Orchard|1997|p=13}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Kirkby Stephen Stone by Petersen.jpg|The bound figure on the Kirkby Stephen Stone\nFile:Gosforth Cross Loki and Sigyn.jpg|Detail from the [[Gosforth Cross]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Scandinavian folklore==\nThe notion of Loki survived into the modern period in the folklore of Scandinavia. In Denmark, Loki appeared as ''Lokke''. In [[Jutland]], the phrases \"Lokke sl\u00e5r sin havre\" (\"Lokke is reaping his oats\") and \"Lokkemand driver sine geder\" (\"Lokkemand drives his goats\") are thereby recorded in the beginning of the 20th century, the latter with the variation of simply \"Lokke\". In [[Zealand]] the name \"Lokke lejemand\" (\"Lokke the Playing Man\") was used. In his study of Loki's appearance in Scandinavian folklore in the modern period, Danish folklorist [[Axel Olrik]] cites numerous examples of natural phenomena explained by way of Lokke in popular folk tradition, including rising heat. An example from 1841 reads as follows:\n<blockquote>\n:The expressions: \"Lokke (Lokki) s\u00e5r havre i dag\" (Lokke (Lokki) sows oats today), or: \"Lokke driver i dag med sine geder\" (Lokke herds his goats today), are used in several regions of Jutland, for example in Medelsom shire, the [[diocese of Viborg]] etc. ... and stand for the sight in the springtime, when the sunshine generates vapour from the ground, which can be seen as fluttering or shimmering air in the horizon of the flat landscape, similar to the hot steam over a kettle or a burning fire\n</blockquote>\nAnd in [[Thy (district)|Thy]], from the same source: \"... when you look at the horizon in clear weather and sunshine, and the air seems to move in shimmering waves, or like a sheet of water which seems to rise and sink in waves.\" Olrik further cites several different types of plants named after Loki. Olrik detects three major themes in folklore attestations; Lokke appeared as an \"air phenomenon\", connected with the \"home fire\", and as a \"teasing creature of the night\".{{sfnp|Olrik|1909}}\n\n''[[Loka T\u00e1ttur]]'' or ''Lokka T\u00e1ttur'' (Faroese \"tale\u2014or ''[[\u00fe\u00e1ttr]]''\u2014of Loki\") is a Faroese ballad dating to the late Middle Ages that features the gods Loki, Odin, and [[H\u0153nir]] helping a farmer and a boy escape the wrath of a bet-winning j\u00f6tunn. The tale notably features Loki as a benevolent god in this story, although his slyness is in evidence as usual.{{sfnp|Hirschfeld|1889|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n==Origin and identification with other figures==\nRegarding scholarship on Loki, scholar [[Gabriel Turville-Petre]] comments (1964) that \"more ink has been spilled on Loki than on any other figure in Norse myth. This, in itself, is enough to show how little scholars agree, and how far we are from understanding him.\"{{sfnp|Turville-Petre|1964|p=324}}\n\n===Origin===\nLoki's origins and role in Norse mythology have been much debated by scholars. In 1835, [[Jacob Grimm]] was first to produce a major theory about Loki, in which he advanced the notion of Loki as a \"god of fire\". In 1889, [[Sophus Bugge]] theorized Loki to be variant of [[Lucifer]] of Christianity, an element of Bugge's larger effort to find a basis of Christianity in Norse mythology. After [[World War II]], four scholarly theories dominated. The first of the four theories is that of [[Folke Str\u00f6m]], who in 1956 concluded that Loki is a [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] of the god [[Odin]]. In 1959, [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] theorized that Loki is a typical example of a [[trickster figure]]. In 1961, by way of excluding all non-Scandinavian mythological parallels in her analysis, [[Anna Birgitta Rooth]] concluded that Loki was originally a [[spider]]. [[Anne Holtsmark]], writing in 1962, concluded that no conclusion could be made about Loki.{{sfnp|von Schnurbein|2000|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\n===Identification with L\u00f3\u00f0urr===\nA popular theory proposed by the scholar [[Ursula Dronke]] is that ''[[L\u00f3\u00f0urr]]'' is \"a third name of Loki/Loptr\". The main argument for this is that the gods Odin, H\u0153nir and Loki occur as a trio in ''[[Haustl\u00f6ng]]'', in the prose prologue to ''[[Reginsm\u00e1l]]'' and also in the ''[[Loka T\u00e1ttur]]'' a [[Faroese people|Faroese]] ballad, an example of Norse deities appearing in later folklore. The Odin-kenning \"L\u00f3\u00f0urr's friend\" furthermore appears to parallel the kenning \"Loptr's friend\" and Loki is similarly referred to as \"H\u0153nir's friend\" in ''Haustl\u00f6ng'', strengthening the trio connection. While many scholars agree with this identification, it is not universally accepted. One argument against it is that Loki appears as a malevolent being later in ''V\u00f6lusp\u00e1'', seemingly conflicting with the image of L\u00f3\u00f0urr as a \"mighty and loving\" figure. Many scholars, including [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] and [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]], have also identified L\u00f3\u00f0urr as being the same deity as Loki. Scholar Haukur \u00deorgeirsson suggests that ''Loki'' and ''L\u00f3\u00f0urr'' were different names for the same deity based on that Loki is referred to as L\u00f3\u00f0ur in the r\u00edmur ''[[Lokrur]]''. \u00deorgeirsson argues that the writer must have had information about the identification from either a tradition or that the author drew the conclusion based on the ''Prose Edda'', as Snorri does not mention L\u00f3\u00f0urr. Since the contents of the ''Poetic Edda'' are assumed to have been forgotten around 1400 when the r\u00edmur was written, Haukur argues for a traditional identification. \u00deorgeirsson also points to ''[[\u00derymlur]]'' where the same identification is made with Loki and L\u00f3\u00f0urr. Haukur says that unless the possible but unlikely idea that the 14th- and 15th-century poets possessed written sources unknown to us is true, the idea must have come from either an unlikely amount of sources from where the poets could have drawn a similar conclusion that Loki and L\u00f3\u00f0urr are identical (like some recent scholars) or that remnants of an oral tradition remained. Haukur concludes that if L\u00f3\u00f0urr was historically considered an independent deity from Loki, then a discussion of when and why he became identified with Loki is appropriate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1793106/Lokrur_Lodurr_and_Late_Evidence|title=Lokrur, L\u00f3\u00f0urr and late evidence|last=\u00deorgeirsson|first=Haukur}}</ref>\n\n===Binding===\nThe scholar [[John Lindow]] highlights the recurring pattern of the [[bound monster]] in Norse mythology as being particularly associated to Loki. Loki and his three children by Angrboda were all bound in some way, and were all destined to break free at Ragnarok to wreak havoc on the world. He suggests a borrowed element from the traditions of the Caucasus region, and identifies a mythological parallel with the \"Christian legend of the bound Antichrist awaiting the Last Judgment\".{{sfnp|Lindow|2001|p=82-83}}\n\n==Modern interpretations and legacy==\n\nIn the 19th century, Loki was depicted in a variety of ways, some strongly at odds with others. According to Stefan Arvidssen, \"the conception of Loki varied during the nineteenth century. Sometimes he was presented as a dark-haired Semitic [[fifth column]]ist among the Nordic Aesir, but sometimes he was described as a Nordic [[Prometheus]], a heroic bearer of culture\".{{sfnp|Arvidsson|2006|p=154}} \n\nLoki appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera cycle [[Ring of the Nibelung]] as ''Loge'' (a play on Old Norse ''loge'', \"fire\"), depicted as an ally of the gods (specifically as [[Wotan]]'s assistant rather than [[Thor|Donner's]]), although he generally dislikes them and thinks of them as greedy, as they refuse to return the Rhine Gold to its rightful owners. In the conclusion of the first opera ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', he reveals his hope to turn into fire and destroy Valhalla, and in the final opera ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]'' Valhalla is set alight, destroying the Gods.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=Winder|editor1-last=McConnell|editor2-first=Werner|editor2-last=Wunderlich|editor3-first=Frank|editor3-last=Gentry|editor4-first=Ulrich|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Mueller|year=2013|title=The Nibelungen Tradition: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|at=\"Loge\" and \"Loki\"|isbn=978-0815317852}}</ref>\n\nAs the myths tell of Loki changing gender on several occasions,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clunies Ross |first1=Margaret |author-link1=Margaret Clunies Ross |year=2002 |editor1-last=Acker |editor1-first=Paul |editor2-last=Larrington |editor2-first=Carolyne |chapter=Reading ''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a'' |title=The Poetic Edda: Essays on Old Norse Mythology |pages=194 |isbn=0815316607 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlozzi |first1=Alfred F. |last2=Choate |first2=Kurt T |year=2018 |title=Transgender and Gender Diverse Persons: A Handbook |pages=266 |isbn=1351207091 }}</ref> some modern works interpret or depict the deity as [[genderfluid]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Birkedal |first1=K.

Loki is in some sources the son of [[F\u00e1rbauti]] and [[Laufey]], and the brother of [[Helblindi]] and [[B\u00fdleistr]]. By the [[j\u00f6tunn]] [[Angrbo\u00f0a]], Loki is the father of [[Hel (being)|Hel]], the wolf [[Fenrir]], and the world serpent [[J\u00f6rmungandr]]. By his wife [[Sigyn]], Loki is the father of [[Narfi and Nari|Narfi and/or Nari]]. By the stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], Loki is the mother\u2014giving birth in the form of a [[mare]]\u2014to the eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]]. In addition, Loki is referred to as the father of [[V\u00e1li]] in ''[[Prose Edda]]'', though this source also refers to [[Odin]] as the father of V\u00e1li twice, and V\u00e1li is found mentioned as a Son of Loki only once.\n\nLoki's relation with the gods varies by source; Loki sometimes assists the gods and sometimes behaves in a malicious manner towards them. Loki is a [[Shapeshifting|shape shifter]] and in separate incidents he appears in the form of a [[salmon]], a [[mare]], a [[Fly (animal)|fly]], and possibly an elderly woman named [[\u00de\u00f6kk]] (Old Norse 'thanks'). Loki's positive relations with the gods end with his role in engineering the death of the god [[Baldr]] and Loki is eventually bound by V\u00e1li with the entrails of one of his sons. In both the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', the goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]] is responsible for placing a serpent above him while he is bound. The serpent drips venom from above him that Sigyn collects into a bowl; however, she must empty the bowl when it is full, and the venom that drips in the meantime causes Loki to writhe in pain, thereby causing earthquakes. With the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]], Loki is foretold to slip free from his bonds and to fight against the gods among the forces of the [[J\u00f6tunn|j\u00f6tnar]], at which time he will encounter the god [[Heimdallr]] and the two will slay each other.\n\nLoki is referred to in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the ''Prose Edda'' and ''[[Heimskringla]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]; the [[Rune Poems|Norwegian Rune Poems]], in the poetry of [[skald]]s, and in Scandinavian folklore. Loki may be depicted on the [[Snaptun Stone]], the [[Loki#Kirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross|Kirkby Stephen Stone]], and the [[Gosforth Cross]]. Loki's origins and role in Norse mythology, which some scholars have described as that of a [[trickster god]], have been much debated by scholars. Loki has been depicted in or is referenced in a variety of media in modern popular culture.\n\n==Etymology, and alternative names==\nThe [[etymology]] of the name ''Loki'' has been extensively debated. The name has at times been associated with the Old Norse word ''logi'' ('flame'), but there seems not to be a sound linguistic basis for this. Rather, the later Scandinavian variants of the name (such as Faroese ''Lokki'', Danish ''Lokkemand'', Norwegian ''Loke'' and ''Lokke'', Swedish ''Luki'' and ''Luku'', along with Finnish ''Lukki'') point to an origin in the Germanic root *''luk''-, which denoted things to do with loops (like knots, hooks, closed-off rooms, and locks). This corresponds with usages such as the Swedish ''lokkan\u00e4t'' and Faroese ''Lokkanet'' ('cobweb', literally 'Lokke's web') and Faroese ''lokki''~''grindalokki''~''grindalokkur'' ('[[Crane fly|daddy-long-legs]]', associated in pre-modern folk-taxonomy with spiders). Some Eastern Swedish traditions referring to the same figure use forms in ''n''- like ''Nokk(e)'', but this corresponds to the *''luk''- etymology insofar as those dialects consistently used a different root, Germanic *''hnuk''-, in contexts where western varieties used *''luk''-: \"''nokke'' corresponds to ''n\u00f8kkel''\" ('key' in Eastern Scandinavian) \"as ''loki''~''lokke'' to ''lykil''\" ('key' in Western Scandinavian).<ref>Eldar Heide, \"[http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/Loke-artikkel%20til%20nettsida.pdf Loki, the ''V\u00e4tte'', and the Ash Lad: A Study Combining Old Scandinavian and Late Material] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222308/http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/Loke-artikkel%20til%20nettsida.pdf |date=2013-12-02 }}\", ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'', 7 (2011), 63\u2013106 (pp. 65\u201375, quoting p. 75), {{DOI|10.1484/J.VMS.1.102616}}.</ref> While it has been suggested that this association with closing could point to Loki's apocalyptic role at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]],{{sfnp|Simek|2007|p=195}} \"there is quite a bit of evidence that Loki in premodern society was thought to be the causer of knots/tangles/loops, or himself a knot/tangle/loop.

Collingwood]]]]\n[[Image:Lokasenna by Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich.jpg|thumb|A depiction of ''Lokasenna'' (1895) by [[Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich]]]]\nThe poem ''[[Lokasenna]]'' (Old Norse \"Loki's Quarrel\") centers around Loki [[flyting]] with other gods; Loki puts forth two stanzas of insults while the receiving figure responds with a single stanza, and then another figure chimes in. The poem begins with a prose introduction detailing that [[\u00c6gir]], a figure associated with the sea, is hosting a feast in his hall for a number of the gods and [[elf|elves]]. There, the gods praise \u00c6gir's servers [[Fimafeng]] and [[Eldir]]. Loki \"could not bear to hear that,\" and kills the servant Fimafeng. In response, the gods grab their shields, shrieking at Loki, and chase him out of the hall and to the woods. The gods then return to the hall, and continue drinking.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n;Entrance and rejection\nLoki comes out of the woods, and meets Eldir outside of the hall. Loki greets Eldir (and the poem itself begins) with a demand that Eldir tell him what the gods are discussing over their ale inside the hall. Eldir responds that they discuss their \"weapons and their prowess in war\" and yet no one there has anything friendly to say about Loki. Loki says that he will go into the feast, and that, before the end of the feast, he will induce quarrelling among the gods, and \"mix their [[mead]] with malice.\" Eldir responds that \"if shouting and fighting you pour out on\" to the gods, \"they'll wipe it off on you.\" Loki then enters the hall, and everyone there falls silent upon noticing him.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=85}}\n\n;Re-entrance and insults\nBreaking the silence, Loki says that, thirsty, he had come to these halls from a long way away to ask the gods for a drink of \"the famous mead.\" Calling the gods arrogant, Loki asks why they are unable to speak, and demands that they assign him a seat and a place for him at the feast, or tell him to leave. The [[skald]]ic god [[Bragi]] is the first to respond to Loki by telling him that Loki will not have a seat and place assigned to him by the gods at the feast, for the gods know what men they should invite.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=86}} Loki does not respond to Bragi directly, but instead directs his attention to Odin, and states:\n<blockquote>\n:Do you remember, Odin, when in bygone days\n:we mixed our blood together?\n:You said you would never drink ale\n:unless it were brought to both of us.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=86}}\n</blockquote>\nOdin then asks his silent son [[V\u00ed\u00f0arr]] to sit up, so that Loki (here referred to as the \"wolf's father\") may sit at the feast, and so that he may not speak words of blame to the gods in \u00c6gir's hall. V\u00ed\u00f0arr stands and pours a drink for Loki. Prior to drinking, Loki declaims a toast to the gods, with a specific exception for Bragi. Bragi responds that he will give a horse, sword, and ring from his possessions so that he does not repay the gods \"with hatred.\" Loki responds that Bragi will always be short of all of these things, accusing him of being \"wary of war\" and \"shy of shooting.\" Bragi responds that, were they outside of \u00c6gir's hall, Bragi would be holding Loki's head as a reward for his lies. Loki replies that Bragi is brave when seated, calling him a \"bench-ornament,\" and that Bragi would run away when troubled by an angry, spirited man.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=87}}\n\nThe goddess [[I\u00f0unn]] interrupts, asking Bragi, as a service to his relatives and adopted relatives, not to say words of blame to Loki in \u00c6gir's hall. Loki tells I\u00f0unn to be silent, calling her the most \"man-crazed\" of all women, and saying that she placed her washed, bright arms around her brother's slayer. I\u00f0unn says that she won't say words of blame in \u00c6gir's hall, and affirms that she quietened Bragi, who was made talkative by beer, and that she doesn't want the two of them to fight. The goddess [[Gefjun]] asks why the two gods must fight, saying that Loki knows that he is joking, and that \"all living things love him.\" Loki responds to Gefjun by stating that Gefjun's heart was once seduced by a \"white boy\" who gave her a jewel, and who Gefjun laid her thigh over.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=87\u201388}}\n\nOdin says that Loki must be insane to make Gefjun his enemy, as her wisdom about the fates of men may equal Odin's own. Loki says that Odin does a poor job in handing out honor in war to men, and that he's often given victory to the faint-hearted. Odin responds that even if this is true, Loki (in a story otherwise unattested) once spent eight winters beneath the earth as a woman milking cows, and during this time bore children. Odin declares this perverse. Loki counters that Odin once practiced [[sei\u00f0r]] (a type of sorcery) on the island of ''Samsey'' (now [[Sams\u00f8]], Denmark), and, appearing as a wizard, traveled among mankind, which Loki condemns as perverse.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=88\u201389}}\n\n[[Frigg]], a major goddess and Odin's wife, says that what Loki and Odin did in the ancient past should not be spoken of in front of others, and that ancient matters should always remain hidden. Loki brings up that Frigg is the daughter of [[Fj\u00f6rgyn and Fj\u00f6rgynn|Fj\u00f6rgyn]], a personification of the earth, and that she had once taken Odin's brothers [[Vili and V\u00e9]] into her embrace. Frigg responds that if there was a boy like her now-deceased son [[Baldr]] in the hall, Loki would not be able to escape from the wrath of the gods. Loki reminds Frigg that he is responsible for the death of her son Baldr.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=89}}\n\nThe goddess [[Freyja]] declares that Loki must be mad, stating that Frigg knows all fate, yet she does not speak it. Loki claims each of the gods and elves that are present have been Freyja's lover. Freyja replies that Loki is lying, that he just wants to \"yelp about wicked things\" that gods and goddesses are furious with him, and that he will go home thwarted. In response, Loki calls Freyja a malicious witch, and claims that Freyja was once astride her brother [[Freyr]], when all of the other laughing gods surprised her and Freyja then farted. This scenario is otherwise unattested. [[Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r]] (Freyja and Freyr's father) says that it is harmless for a woman to have a lover or \"someone else\" beside her husband, and that what is surprising is a \"pervert god coming here who has borne children.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=89\u201390}}\n\nLoki tells Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to be silent, recalling Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's status as once having been a hostage from the [[Vanir]] to the [[\u00c6sir]] during the [[\u00c6sir-Vanir War]], that the \"daughters of Hymir\" once used Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r \"as a pisspot,\" urinating in his mouth (an otherwise unattested comment). Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r responds that this was his reward when he was sent as a hostage to the \u00c6sir, and that he fathered his son (Freyr), whom no one hates, and is considered a prince of the \u00c6sir. Loki tells Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to maintain his moderation, and that he won't keep it secret any longer that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r fathered this son with [[Sister-wife of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r|his sister]] (unnamed), although one would expect him to be worse than he turned out.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nThe god [[Tyr]] defends Freyr, to which Loki replies that Tyr should be silent, for Tyr cannot \"deal straight with people,\" and points out that it was Loki's son, the wolf Fenrir, who tore Tyr's hand off. (According to the prose introduction to the poem Tyr is now one-handed from having his arm bitten off by Loki's son Fenrir while Fenrir was bound.) Tyr responds that while he may have lost a hand, Loki has lost the wolf, and trouble has come to them both. Further, that Fenrir must now wait in shackles until the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Loki tells Tyr to be silent a second time, and states that Tyr's wife (otherwise unattested) had a son by Loki, and that Tyr never received any compensation for this \"injury,\" further calling him a \"wretch.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=91}}\n\nFreyr himself interrupts at this point, and says that he sees a wolf lying before a river mouth, and that, unless Loki is immediately silent, like the wolf, Loki shall also be bound until [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Loki retorts that Freyr purchased his consort [[Ger\u00f0r]] with gold, having given away his sword, which he will lack at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. [[Byggvir]] (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that if he had as noble a lineage and as an honorable a seat as Freyr, he would grind down Loki, and make all of his limbs lame. Loki refers to Byggvir in terms of a dog, and says that Byggvir is always found at Freyr's ears, or twittering beneath a grindstone. Byggvir says that he's proud to be here by all the gods and men, and that he's said to be speedy. Loki tells him to be silent, that Byggvir does not know how to apportion food among men, and that he hides among the straw and [[dais]] when men go to battle.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=91\u201392}}\n\nThe god [[Heimdallr]] says that Loki is drunk and witless, and asks Loki why he won't stop speaking. Loki tells Heimdallr to be silent, that he was fated a \"hateful life,\" that Heimdallr must always have a muddy back, and serve as watchman of the gods. The goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]] says that while Loki now appears light-hearted and \"playing\" with his \"tail-wagging,\" he will soon be bound with his ice-cold son's guts on a sharp rock by the gods. Loki says that, even if this is his fate, that he was \"first and foremost\" with the other gods at the killing of Ska\u00f0i's father, [[\u00dejazi]]. Ska\u00f0i says that, with these events in mind, \"baneful advice\" will always come from her \"sanctuaries and plains\" to Loki. Loki says that Ska\u00f0i was once gentler in speech to him (referring to himself as the \"son of [[Laufey]]\") when Ska\u00f0i once invited him to her bed (an event that is unattested elsewhere), and that such events must be mentioned if they are to recall \"shameful deeds.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=91\u201393}}\n\n[[Sif]], wife of [[Thor]], goes forth and pours Loki a glass of mead into a crystal cup in a prose narrative. Continuing the poem, Sif welcomes Loki and invites him to take a crystal cup filled with ancient mead, and says that among the children of the \u00c6sir, she is singularly blameless. Loki \"takes the horn,\" drinks it, and says that she would be, if it were so, and states that Sif had a lover beside Thor, namely, Loki himself (an event that is otherwise unattested). [[Beyla]] (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that all of the mountains are shaking, that she thinks Thor must be on his way home, and when Thor arrives he will bring peace to those that quarrel there. Loki tells Beyla to be silent, that she is \"much imbued with malice,\" that no worse female has ever been among the \"\u00c6sir's children,\" and calling her a bad \"serving-wench.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=94}}\n\n;The arrival of Thor and the bondage of Loki\n[[File:Loki leaves the hall and threatens the \u00c6sir with fire by Fr\u00f8lich.jpg|thumb|''Loki threatens the \u00c6sir with fire'' (1895) by [[Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich]]]]\n[[Image:Louis Huard - The Punishment of Loki.jpg|thumb|''The Punishment of Loki'' by Louis Huard]]\nThor arrives, and tells Loki to be silent, referring to him as an \"evil creature,\" stating that with his hammer [[Mj\u00f6llnir]] he will silence Loki by hammering his head from his shoulders. Acknowledging that Thor has arrived, Loki asks Thor why he is raging, and says that Thor won't be so bold to fight against the wolf when he swallows Odin at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Thor again tells Loki to be silent, and threatens him with Mj\u00f6llnir, adding that he will throw Loki \"up on the roads to the east,\" and thereafter no one will be able to see Loki. Loki states that Thor should never brag of his journeys to the east, claiming that there Thor crouched cowering in the thumb of a glove, mockingly referring to him as a \"hero,\" and adding that such behaviour was unlike Thor. Thor responds by telling Loki to be silent, threatening him with Mj\u00f6llnir, and adding that every one of Loki's bones will be broken with it. Loki says he intends to live for a long while yet despite Thor's threats, and taunts Thor about an encounter Thor once had with the [[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki|Skr\u00fdmir]] ([[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki]] in disguise). Thor again commands Loki to be silent, threatens Loki with Mj\u00f6llnir, and says he will send Loki to [[Hel (location)|Hel]], below the gates of [[N\u00e1grind]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nIn response to Thor, Loki says that he \"spoke before the \u00c6sir,\" and \"before the sons of the \u00c6sir\" what his \"spirit urged\" him to say, yet before Thor alone he will leave, as he knows that Thor does strike. Loki ends the poetic verses of ''Lokasenna'' with a final stanza:\n<blockquote>\n:Ale you brewed, \u00c6gir, and you will never again hold a feast;\n:all your possessions which are here inside\u2014\n:may flame play over them,\n:and may your back be burnt!{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=95}}\n</blockquote>\nFollowing this final stanza a prose section details that after Loki left the hall, he disguised himself as a [[salmon]] and hid in the waterfall of [[Franangrsfors]], where the \u00c6sir caught him. The narrative continues that Loki was bound with the entrails of his son [[Narfi (son of Loki)|Nari]], and his son [[Narfi (son of Loki)|Narfi]] changed into a wolf. Ska\u00f0i fastened a venomous snake over Loki's face, and from it poison dripped. Sigyn, Loki's wife, sat with him holding a basin beneath the dripping venom, yet when the basin became full, she carried the poison away; and during this time the poison dripped on to Loki, causing him to writhe with such violence that all of the earth shook from the force, resulting in what are now known as earthquakes.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=95\u201396}}\n\n====''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a''====\n[[Image:Loki's flight to J\u00f6tunheim.jpg|thumb|''Loki's flight to J\u00f6tunheim'' (1908) by [[W. G. Collingwood]]]]\n[[Image:Ah, what a lovely maid it is! by Elmer Boyd Smith.jpg|thumb|''Ah, what a lovely maid it is!'' (1902) by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]].]]\nIn the poem ''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a'', Thor wakes and finds that his powerful hammer, [[Mj\u00f6llnir]], is missing. Thor turns to Loki first, and tells him that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two then go to the court of the goddess [[Freyja]], and Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak so that he may attempt to find Mj\u00f6llnir. Freyja agrees, saying she'd lend it even if it were made of silver and gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=97}}\n\nIn [[J\u00f6tunheimr]], the j\u00f6tunn [[\u00derymr]] sits on a [[tumulus|burial mound]], plaiting golden collars for his female dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses. \u00derymr sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the [[\u00c6sir]] and the [[Elf#Norse mythology|Elves]]; why is Loki alone in the J\u00f6tunheimr? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the \u00c6sir: that Thor's hammer, Mj\u00f6llnir, is gone. \u00derymr says that he has hidden Mj\u00f6llnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved if Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from J\u00f6tunheimr and back to the court of the gods.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=97\u201398}}\n\nThor asks Loki if his efforts were successful, and that Loki should tell him while he's still in the air as \"tales often escape a sitting man, and the man lying down often barks out lies.\" Loki states that it was indeed an effort, and also a success, for he has discovered that \u00derymr has the hammer, but that it cannot be retrieved unless Freyja is brought to \u00derymr as his wife. The two return to Freyja, and tell her to dress herself in a bridal head dress, as they will drive her to J\u00f6tunheimr. Freyja, indignant and angry, goes into a rage, causing all of the halls of the \u00c6sir to tremble in her anger, and her necklace, the famed [[Br\u00edsingamen]], falls from her. Freyja pointedly refuses.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=98}}\n\nAs a result, the gods and goddesses meet and hold a [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god [[Heimdallr]] puts forth the suggestion that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women's clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace Br\u00edsingamen. Thor rejects the idea, and Loki (here described as \"son of [[Laufey]]\") interjects that this will be the only way to get back Mj\u00f6llnir, and points out that without Mj\u00f6llnir, the j\u00f6tnar will be able to invade and settle in [[Asgard]]. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to J\u00f6tunheimr together.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=99}}\n\nAfter riding together in Thor's [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str|goat-driven chariot]], the two, disguised, arrive in J\u00f6tunheimr. \u00derymr commands the j\u00f6tnar in his hall to spread straw on the benches, for Freyja has arrived to be his wife. \u00derymr recounts his treasured animals and objects, stating that Freyja was all that he was missing in his wealth.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=100}}\n\nEarly in the evening, the disguised Loki and Thor meet with \u00derymr and the assembled j\u00f6tnar. Thor eats and drinks ferociously, consuming entire animals and three casks of [[mead]]. \u00derymr finds the behaviour at odds with his impression of Freyja, and Loki, sitting before \u00derymr and appearing as a \"very shrewd maid\", makes the excuse that \"Freyja's\" behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. \u00derymr then lifts \"Freyja's\" veil and wants to kiss \"her\" until catching the terrifying eyes staring back at him, seemingly burning with fire. Loki states that this is because \"Freyja\" had not slept for eight nights in her eagerness.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=100}}\n\nThe \"wretched sister\" of the j\u00f6tnar appears, asks for a bridal gift from \"Freyja\", and the j\u00f6tnar bring out Mj\u00f6llnir to \"sanctify the bride\", to lay it on her lap, and marry the two by \"the hand\" of the goddess [[V\u00e1r]]. Thor laughs internally when he sees the hammer, takes hold of it, strikes \u00derymr, beats all of the j\u00f6tnar, and kills the \"older sister\" of the j\u00f6tnar.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=101}}\n\n====''Reginsm\u00e1l''====\nLoki appears in both prose and the first six stanzas of the poem ''Reginsm\u00e1l''. The prose introduction to ''Reginsm\u00e1l'' details that, while the hero [[Sigurd]] was being fostered by [[Regin]], son of [[Hreidmar]], Regin tells him that once the gods Odin, [[H\u0153nir]], and Loki went to Andvara-falls, which contained many fish. Regin, a dwarf, had two brothers; [[Andvari]], who gained food by spending time in the Andvara-falls in the form of a [[Esox|pike]], and [[\u00d3tr]], who would often go to the Andvara-falls in the form of an otter.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=151}}\n\nWhile the three gods are at the falls, \u00d3tr (in the form of an otter) catches a salmon and eats it on a river bank, his eyes shut, when Loki hits and kills him with a stone. The gods think that this is great, and flay the skin from the otter to make a bag. That night, the three gods stay with Hreidmar (the father of Regin, Andvari, and the now-dead \u00d3tr) and show him their catches, including the skin of the otter. Upon seeing the skin, Regin and Hreidmar \"seized them and made them ransom their lives\" in exchange for filling the otterskin bag the gods had made with gold and covering the exterior of the bag with red gold.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=151}}\n\nLoki is sent to retrieve the gold, and Loki goes to the goddess [[R\u00e1n]], borrows her net, and then goes back to the Andvara-falls. At the falls, Loki spreads his net before Andvari (who is in the form of a pike), which Andvari jumps into. The stanzas of the poem then begin: Loki mocks Andvari, and tells him that he can save his head by telling Loki where his gold is. Andvari gives some background information about himself, including that he was cursed by a \"[[norns|norn]] of misfortune\" in his \"early days\". Loki responds by asking Andvari \"what requital\" does mankind get if \"they wound each other with words\". Andvari responds that lying men receive a \"terrible requital\": having to wade in the river [[Vadgelmir]], and that their suffering will be long.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\nLoki looks over the gold that Andvari possesses, and after Andvari hands over all of his gold, Andvari holds on to but a single ring; the ring [[Andvarinaut]], which Loki also takes. Andvari, now in the form of a dwarf, goes into a rock, and tells Loki that the gold will result in the death of two brothers, will cause strife between eight princes, and will be useless to everyone.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=152}}\n\nLoki returns, and the three gods give Hreidmar the money from the gold hoard and flatten out the otter skin, stretch out its legs, and heap gold atop it, covering it. Hreidmar looks it over, and notices a single hair that has not been covered. Hreidmar demands that it be covered as well. Odin puts forth the ring Andvarinaut, covering the single hair.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=152}}\n\nLoki states that they have now handed over the gold, and that gold is cursed as Andvari is, and that it will be the death of Hreidmar and Regin both. Hreidmar responds that if he had known this before, he would have taken their lives, yet that he believes those are not yet born whom the curse is intended for, and that he doesn't believe him. Further, with the hoard, he will have red gold for the rest of his life. Hreidmar tells them to leave, and the poem continues without further mention of Loki.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\n====''Baldrs draumar''====\nIn ''Baldr draumar'', Odin has awoken a deceased v\u00f6lva in [[Hel (location)|Hel]], and questions her repeatedly about his son [[Baldr]]'s bad dreams. Loki is mentioned in stanza 14, the final stanza of the poem, where the v\u00f6lva tells Odin to ride home, to be proud of himself, and that no one else will come visit until \"Loki is loose, escaped from his bonds\" and the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=245}}\n\n====''Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0''====\n[[File:Loki finds Gullveigs Heart - John Bauer.jpg|thumb|Loki consumes a roasted heart in a painting (1911) by [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]]]\nLoki is referenced in two stanzas in ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 hin skamma]]'', found within the poem ''[[Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0]]''. The first stanza notes that Loki produced \"the wolf\" with the j\u00f6tunn [[Angrbo\u00f0a]], that Loki himself gave birth to the horse [[Sleipnir]] by the stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], and that Loki (referred to as the \"brother of [[B\u00fdleistr]]\") thirdly gave birth to \"the worst of all marvels\". This stanza is followed by:\n<blockquote>\n:Loki ate some of the heart, the thought-stone of a woman,\n:roasted on a [[Tilia|linden-wood]] fire, he found it half-cooked;\n:Lopt was impregnated by a wicked woman,\n:from whom every ogress on earth is descended.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=258}}\n</blockquote>\nIn the second of the two stanzas, Loki is referred to as ''Lopt''.

In the poem, Fj\u00f6lsvi\u00f0r describes to the hero [[Svipdagr]] that [[Sinmara]] keeps the weapon [[L\u00e6vateinn]] within a chest, locked with [[Numbers in Germanic paganism|nine strong locks]] (due to significant translation differences, two translations of the stanza are provided here):\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:''Fjolsvith spake:''\n:\"L\u00e6vatein is there, that Lopt with runes\n:Once made by the doors of death;\n:In L\u00e6gjarn's chest by Sinmora lies it,\n:And nine locks fasten it firm.\"{{sfnp|Bellows|1936|p=245}}\n|\n:''Fiolsvith.''\n:H\u00e6vatein the twig is named, and Lopt plucked it,\n:down by the gate of Death.\n:In an iron chest it lies with Sinm\u0153ra,\n:and is with nine strong locks secured.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1907|pp=96\u201397}}\n|\n|}\n</blockquote>\n\n===''Prose Edda''===\n\n====''Gylfaginning''====\nThe ''Prose Edda'' book ''Gylfaginning'' tells various myths featuring Loki, including Loki's role in the birth of the horse [[Sleipnir]] and Loki's contest with [[Logi]], fire personified.\n\n'''High's introduction'''\n\nLoki first appears in the ''Prose Edda'' in chapter 20 of the book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', where he is referred to as the \"[[\u00c6sir|\u00e1s]] called Loki\" while the enthroned figure of [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|Third]] explains to \"Gangleri\" (King [[Gylfi]] in disguise) the goddess Frigg's prophetic abilities while citing a stanza of ''Lokasenna''.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=21}}\n[[Image:The children of Loki by Willy Pogany.png|thumb|right|\"The children of Loki\" (1920) by [[Willy Pogany]]]]\nLoki is more formally introduced by [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|High]] in chapter 34, where he is \"reckoned among the \u00c6sir\", and High states that Loki is called by some \"the \u00c6sir's calumniator\", \"originator of deceits\", and \"the disgrace of all gods and men\". High says that Loki's alternative name is ''Lopt'', that he is the son of the male j\u00f6tunn [[F\u00e1rbauti]], his mother is \"[[Laufey|Laufey or N\u00e1l]]\", and his brothers are [[Helblindi]] and [[B\u00fdleistr]]. High describes Loki as \"pleasing and handsome\" in appearance, malicious in character, \"very capricious in behaviour\", and as possessing \"to a greater degree than others\" learned cunning, and \"tricks for every purpose\", often getting the \u00c6sir into trouble, and then getting them out of it with his trickery. Loki's wife is named Sigyn, and they have a son named \"Nari or Narfi\". Otherwise, Loki had three children with the female j\u00f6tunn Angrbo\u00f0a from [[J\u00f6tunheimr]]; the wolf [[Fenrir]], the serpent [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], and the female being [[Hel (being)|Hel]]. The gods realized that these three children were being raised in J\u00f6tunheimr, and expected trouble from them partially due to the nature of Angrbo\u00f0a, but worse yet Loki.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=26\u201327}} In chapter 35, Gangleri comments that Loki produced a \"pretty terrible\"\u2014yet important\u2014family.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=29}}\n\n'''Loki, Sva\u00f0ilfari, and Sleipnir'''\n\nIn chapter 42, High tells a story set \"right at the beginning of the gods' settlement, when the gods at established [[Midgard]] and built [[Valhalla|Val-Hall]].\" The story is about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the [[S\u00f3l (sun)|sun]], and the [[M\u00e1ni|moon]]. After some debate, the gods agree to these conditions, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons without the help of any man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed. The stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks\u2014to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Sva\u00f0ilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of [[Sumarr and Vetr|summer]], the builder is nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene, and figure out who is responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki is to blame (here referred to as ''Loki Laufeyjarson''\u2014his surname derived from his mother's name, ''Laufey'').{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=35}}\n\n[[Image:Loki and Svadilfari by Hardy.jpg|thumb|''Loki and [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]]'' (1909) by Dorothy Hardy]]\nThe gods declare that Loki deserves a horrible death if he cannot find a scheme that will cause the builder to forfeit his payment, and threaten to attack him. Loki, afraid, swears oaths that he will devise a scheme to cause the builder to forfeit the payment, whatever it may cost himself. That night, the builder drives out to fetch stone with his stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari, and out from a wood runs a mare. The mare neighs at Sva\u00f0ilfari, and \"realizing what kind of horse it was,\" Sva\u00f0ilfari becomes frantic, neighs, tears apart his tackle, and runs towards the mare. The mare runs to the wood, Sva\u00f0ilfari follows, and the builder chases after. The two horses run around all night, causing the building to be halted and the builder is then unable to regain the previous momentum of his work.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=36}}\n\nThe builder goes into a rage, and when the \u00c6sir realize that the builder is a [[hrimthurs]], they disregard their previous oaths with the builder, and call for Thor. Thor arrives, and subsequently kills the builder by smashing the builder's skull into shards with the hammer Mj\u00f6llnir. However, Loki \"[[sexual intercourse|had such dealings]]\" with Sva\u00f0ilfari that \"[[Pregnancy|somewhat later]]\" Loki gives birth to a gray [[foal]] with eight legs; the horse [[Sleipnir]]\u2014\"the best horse among gods and men.\"{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=36}}\n\n'''Loki, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki, and Logi'''\n\nIn chapter 44, [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|Third]] reluctantly relates a tale where Thor and Loki are riding in Thor's chariot, which is pulled by his [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str|two goats]]. Loki and Thor stop at the house of a peasant farmer, and there they are given lodging for a night. Thor slaughters his goats, prepares them, puts them in a pot, and Loki and Thor sit down for their evening meal. Thor invites the peasant family who own the farm to share with him the meal he has prepared, but warns them not to break the bones. Afterward, at the suggestion of Loki, the peasant child [[\u00dej\u00e1lfi]] sucks the [[bone marrow]] from one of the goat bones, and when Thor goes to resurrect the goats, he finds one of the goats to be lame. In their terror, the family atones to Thor by giving Thor their son \u00dej\u00e1lfi and their daughter [[R\u00f6skva]].{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=37\u201338}}\n[[File:I am the giant Skrymir by Elmer Boyd Smith.jpg|thumb|''I am the giant [[Skrymir]]'' by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]]]]\nMinus the goats, Thor, Loki, and the two children continue east until they arrive at a vast forest in [[J\u00f6tunheimr]]. They continue through the woods until dark. The four seek shelter for the night. They encounter an immense building. Finding shelter in a side room, they experience earthquakes through the night. The earthquakes cause all four but Thor, who grips his hammer in preparation of defense, to be fearful. The building turns out to be the huge glove of [[Skrymir]], who has been snoring throughout the night, causing what seemed to be earthquakes. All four sleep beneath an oak tree near Skrymir in fear.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nThor wakes up in the middle of the night, and a series of events occur where Thor twice attempts to kill the sleeping Skr\u00fdmir with his hammer. Skr\u00fdmir awakes after each attempt, only to say that he detected an acorn falling on his head or that he wonders if bits of tree from the branches above have fallen on top of him. The second attempt awakes Skr\u00fdmir. Skr\u00fdmir gives them advice; if they are going to be cocky at the keep of [[\u00datgar\u00f0ar|\u00datgar\u00f0r]] it would be better for them to turn back now, for [[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki]]'s men there won't put up with it. Skr\u00fdmir throws his knapsack onto his back and abruptly goes into the forest. High comments that \"there is no report that the \u00c6sir expressed hope for a happy reunion\".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=40}}\n\nThe four travelers continue their journey until midday. They find themselves facing a massive castle in an open area. The castle is so tall that they must bend their heads back to their spines to see above it. At the entrance to the castle is a shut gate, and Thor finds that he cannot open it. Struggling, all four squeeze through the bars of the gate, and continue to a large hall. Inside the great hall are two benches, where many generally large people sit on two benches. The four see \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki, the king of the castle, sitting.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki says that no visitors are allowed to stay unless they can perform a feat. Loki, standing in the rear of the party, is the first to speak, claiming that he can eat faster than anyone. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki comments that this would be a feat indeed, and calls for a being by the name of [[Logi]] to come from the benches. A trencher is fetched, placed on the floor of the hall, and filled with meat. Loki and Logi sit down on opposing sides. The two eat as quickly as they can and meet at the midpoint of the trencher. Loki consumed all of the meat off of the bones on his side, yet Logi had not only consumed his meat, but also the bones and the trencher itself. It was evident to all that Loki had lost. In turn, \u00dej\u00e1lfi races against a figure by the name of Hugi three times and thrice loses.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nThor agrees to compete in a drinking contest but after three immense gulps fails. Thor agrees to lift a large, gray cat in the hall but finds that it arches his back no matter what he does, and that he can raise only a single paw. Thor demands to fight someone in the hall, but the inhabitants say doing so would be demeaning, considering Thor's weakness. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki then calls for his nurse [[Elli]], an old woman. The two wrestle but the harder Thor struggles the more difficult the battle becomes. Thor is finally brought down to a single knee. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki says to Thor that fighting anyone else would be pointless. Now late at night, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki shows the group to their rooms and they are treated with hospitality.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=42\u201344}}\n\nThe next morning the group gets dressed and prepares to leave the keep. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki appears, has his servants prepare a table, and they all merrily eat and drink. As they leave, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki asks Thor how he thought he fared in the contests. Thor says that he is unable to say he did well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki will now speak negatively about him. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki points out that the group has left his keep and says that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had an inkling of what he was dealing with he would never have allowed the group to enter in the first place. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki reveals that all was not what it seemed to the group. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki was in fact the immense Skr\u00fdmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first would have killed Skr\u00fdmir. In reality, Thor's blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nThe contests, too, were an illusion. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki reveals that Loki had actually competed against wildfire itself (''Logi'', Old Norse \"flame\"), \u00dej\u00e1lfi had raced against thought (''Hugi'', Old Norse \"thought\"), Thor's drinking horn had actually reached to the ocean and with his drinks he lowered the ocean level (resulting in [[tide]]s). The cat that Thor attempted to lift was in actuality the world serpent, [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], and everyone was terrified when Thor was able to lift the paw of this \"cat\", for Thor had actually held the great serpent up to the sky. The old woman Thor wrestled was in fact old age (''Elli'', Old Norse \"old age\"), and there is no one that old age cannot bring down. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki tells Thor that it would be better for \"both sides\" if they did not meet again. Upon hearing this, Thor takes hold of his hammer and swings it at \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki but he is gone and so is his castle. Only a wide landscape remains.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=45\u201346}}\n\n===Norwegian rune poem===\n[[File:Runic letter berkanan.svg|thumb|50px|The [[Berkanan|Bjarkan]] [[Runic alphabet|rune]]]]\nLoki is mentioned in stanza 13 of the [[Rune Poems|Norwegian rune poem]] in connection with the [[Younger Futhark]] [[Berkanan|Bjarkan]] [[Runic alphabet|rune]]:\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:<small>Old Norse:</small>\n:Bjarkan er laufgr\u00f8nster l\u00edma;\n::Loki bar fl\u00e6r\u00f0a t\u00edma.{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=26}}\n|\n:<small>Modern English:</small>\n:[[Birch]] has the greenest leaves of any shrub;\n::Loki was fortunate in his deceit.{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=27}}\n|}\n</blockquote>\nAccording to Bruce Dickins, the reference to \"Loki's deceit\" in the poem \"is doubtless to Loki's responsibility for Balder's death.\"{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=27}}\n\n==Archaeological record==\n\n===Snaptun Stone===\n[[Image:Lokistone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Snaptun Stone]] may feature a depiction of Loki]]\nIn 1950, a semi-circular flat stone featuring a depiction of a mustachioed face was discovered on a beach near Snaptun, [[Denmark]]. Made of [[soapstone]] that originated in Norway or Sweden, the depiction was carved around the year 1000 CE and features a face with scarred lips. The figure is identified as Loki due to his lips, considered a reference to a tale recorded in ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'' where [[sons of Ivaldi]] stitch up Loki's lips.{{sfnp|Madsen|1990|p=180}}\n\nThe stone is identified as a [[hearth]] stone; the nozzle of the [[bellows]] would be inserted into the hole in the front of the stone, and the air produced by the bellows pushed flame through the top hole, all the while the bellows were protected from the heat and flame. The stone may point to a connection between Loki and smithing and flames. According to Hans J\u00f8rgen Madsen, the Snaptun Stone is \"the most beautifully made hearth-stone that is known.\" The stone is housed and on display at the [[Moesg\u00e5rd Museum]] near [[Aarhus]], Denmark.{{sfnp|Madsen|1990|p=180}}\n\n===Kirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross===\nA fragmentary late 10th-century cross located in [[St Stephen's Church, Kirkby Stephen]], [[Cumbria]], [[England]], features a bound figure with horns and a beard. This figure is sometimes theorized as depicting the bound Loki.{{sfnp|Orchard|1997|p=105}} Discovered in 1870, the stone consists of yellowish-white [[sandstone]], and now sits at the front of the Kirkby Stephen church. A depiction of a similarly horned and round-shouldered figure was discovered in [[Gainford, County Durham]] and is now housed in the [[Durham Cathedral|Durham Cathedral Library]].{{sfnp|Calverley|1899|p=218}}\n\nThe mid-11th century [[Gosforth Cross]] has been interpreted as featuring various figures from Norse mythology and, like the Kirkby Stephen Stone, is also located in Cumbria. The bottom portion of the west side of the cross features a depiction of a long-haired female, kneeling figure holding an object above another prostrate, bound figure. Above and to their left is a knotted serpent. This has been interpreted as Sigyn soothing the bound Loki.{{sfnp|Orchard|1997|p=13}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Kirkby Stephen Stone by Petersen.jpg|The bound figure on the Kirkby Stephen Stone\nFile:Gosforth Cross Loki and Sigyn.jpg|Detail from the [[Gosforth Cross]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Scandinavian folklore==\nThe notion of Loki survived into the modern period in the folklore of Scandinavia. In Denmark, Loki appeared as ''Lokke''. In [[Jutland]], the phrases \"Lokke sl\u00e5r sin havre\" (\"Lokke is reaping his oats\") and \"Lokkemand driver sine geder\" (\"Lokkemand drives his goats\") are thereby recorded in the beginning of the 20th century, the latter with the variation of simply \"Lokke\". In [[Zealand]] the name \"Lokke lejemand\" (\"Lokke the Playing Man\") was used. In his study of Loki's appearance in Scandinavian folklore in the modern period, Danish folklorist [[Axel Olrik]] cites numerous examples of natural phenomena explained by way of Lokke in popular folk tradition, including rising heat. An example from 1841 reads as follows:\n<blockquote>\n:The expressions: \"Lokke (Lokki) s\u00e5r havre i dag\" (Lokke (Lokki) sows oats today), or: \"Lokke driver i dag med sine geder\" (Lokke herds his goats today), are used in several regions of Jutland, for example in Medelsom shire, the [[diocese of Viborg]] etc. ... and stand for the sight in the springtime, when the sunshine generates vapour from the ground, which can be seen as fluttering or shimmering air in the horizon of the flat landscape, similar to the hot steam over a kettle or a burning fire\n</blockquote>\nAnd in [[Thy (district)|Thy]], from the same source: \"... when you look at the horizon in clear weather and sunshine, and the air seems to move in shimmering waves, or like a sheet of water which seems to rise and sink in waves.\" Olrik further cites several different types of plants named after Loki. Olrik detects three major themes in folklore attestations; Lokke appeared as an \"air phenomenon\", connected with the \"home fire\", and as a \"teasing creature of the night\".{{sfnp|Olrik|1909}}\n\n''[[Loka T\u00e1ttur]]'' or ''Lokka T\u00e1ttur'' (Faroese \"tale\u2014or ''[[\u00fe\u00e1ttr]]''\u2014of Loki\") is a Faroese ballad dating to the late Middle Ages that features the gods Loki, Odin, and [[H\u0153nir]] helping a farmer and a boy escape the wrath of a bet-winning j\u00f6tunn. The tale notably features Loki as a benevolent god in this story, although his slyness is in evidence as usual.{{sfnp|Hirschfeld|1889|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n==Origin and identification with other figures==\nRegarding scholarship on Loki, scholar [[Gabriel Turville-Petre]] comments (1964) that \"more ink has been spilled on Loki than on any other figure in Norse myth. This, in itself, is enough to show how little scholars agree, and how far we are from understanding him.\"{{sfnp|Turville-Petre|1964|p=324}}\n\n===Origin===\nLoki's origins and role in Norse mythology have been much debated by scholars. In 1835, [[Jacob Grimm]] was first to produce a major theory about Loki, in which he advanced the notion of Loki as a \"god of fire\". In 1889, [[Sophus Bugge]] theorized Loki to be variant of [[Lucifer]] of Christianity, an element of Bugge's larger effort to find a basis of Christianity in Norse mythology. After [[World War II]], four scholarly theories dominated. The first of the four theories is that of [[Folke Str\u00f6m]], who in 1956 concluded that Loki is a [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] of the god [[Odin]]. In 1959, [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] theorized that Loki is a typical example of a [[trickster figure]]. In 1961, by way of excluding all non-Scandinavian mythological parallels in her analysis, [[Anna Birgitta Rooth]] concluded that Loki was originally a [[spider]]. [[Anne Holtsmark]], writing in 1962, concluded that no conclusion could be made about Loki.{{sfnp|von Schnurbein|2000|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\n===Identification with L\u00f3\u00f0urr===\nA popular theory proposed by the scholar [[Ursula Dronke]] is that ''[[L\u00f3\u00f0urr]]'' is \"a third name of Loki/Loptr\". The main argument for this is that the gods Odin, H\u0153nir and Loki occur as a trio in ''[[Haustl\u00f6ng]]'', in the prose prologue to ''[[Reginsm\u00e1l]]'' and also in the ''[[Loka T\u00e1ttur]]'' a [[Faroese people|Faroese]] ballad, an example of Norse deities appearing in later folklore. The Odin-kenning \"L\u00f3\u00f0urr's friend\" furthermore appears to parallel the kenning \"Loptr's friend\" and Loki is similarly referred to as \"H\u0153nir's friend\" in ''Haustl\u00f6ng'', strengthening the trio connection. While many scholars agree with this identification, it is not universally accepted. One argument against it is that Loki appears as a malevolent being later in ''V\u00f6lusp\u00e1'', seemingly conflicting with the image of L\u00f3\u00f0urr as a \"mighty and loving\" figure. Many scholars, including [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] and [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]], have also identified L\u00f3\u00f0urr as being the same deity as Loki. Scholar Haukur \u00deorgeirsson suggests that ''Loki'' and ''L\u00f3\u00f0urr'' were different names for the same deity based on that Loki is referred to as L\u00f3\u00f0ur in the r\u00edmur ''[[Lokrur]]''. \u00deorgeirsson argues that the writer must have had information about the identification from either a tradition or that the author drew the conclusion based on the ''Prose Edda'', as Snorri does not mention L\u00f3\u00f0urr. Since the contents of the ''Poetic Edda'' are assumed to have been forgotten around 1400 when the r\u00edmur was written, Haukur argues for a traditional identification. \u00deorgeirsson also points to ''[[\u00derymlur]]'' where the same identification is made with Loki and L\u00f3\u00f0urr. Haukur says that unless the possible but unlikely idea that the 14th- and 15th-century poets possessed written sources unknown to us is true, the idea must have come from either an unlikely amount of sources from where the poets could have drawn a similar conclusion that Loki and L\u00f3\u00f0urr are identical (like some recent scholars) or that remnants of an oral tradition remained. Haukur concludes that if L\u00f3\u00f0urr was historically considered an independent deity from Loki, then a discussion of when and why he became identified with Loki is appropriate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1793106/Lokrur_Lodurr_and_Late_Evidence|title=Lokrur, L\u00f3\u00f0urr and late evidence|last=\u00deorgeirsson|first=Haukur}}</ref>\n\n===Binding===\nThe scholar [[John Lindow]] highlights the recurring pattern of the [[bound monster]] in Norse mythology as being particularly associated to Loki. Loki and his three children by Angrboda were all bound in some way, and were all destined to break free at Ragnarok to wreak havoc on the world. He suggests a borrowed element from the traditions of the Caucasus region, and identifies a mythological parallel with the \"Christian legend of the bound Antichrist awaiting the Last Judgment\".{{sfnp|Lindow|2001|p=82-83}}\n\n==Modern interpretations and legacy==\n\nIn the 19th century, Loki was depicted in a variety of ways, some strongly at odds with others. According to Stefan Arvidssen, \"the conception of Loki varied during the nineteenth century. Sometimes he was presented as a dark-haired Semitic [[fifth column]]ist among the Nordic Aesir, but sometimes he was described as a Nordic [[Prometheus]], a heroic bearer of culture\".{{sfnp|Arvidsson|2006|p=154}} \n\nLoki appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera cycle [[Ring of the Nibelung]] as ''Loge'' (a play on Old Norse ''loge'', \"fire\"), depicted as an ally of the gods (specifically as [[Wotan]]'s assistant rather than [[Thor|Donner's]]), although he generally dislikes them and thinks of them as greedy, as they refuse to return the Rhine Gold to its rightful owners. In the conclusion of the first opera ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', he reveals his hope to turn into fire and destroy Valhalla, and in the final opera ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]'' Valhalla is set alight, destroying the Gods.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=Winder|editor1-last=McConnell|editor2-first=Werner|editor2-last=Wunderlich|editor3-first=Frank|editor3-last=Gentry|editor4-first=Ulrich|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Mueller|year=2013|title=The Nibelungen Tradition: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|at=\"Loge\" and \"Loki\"|isbn=978-0815317852}}</ref>\n\nAs the myths tell of Loki changing gender on several occasions,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clunies Ross |first1=Margaret |author-link1=Margaret Clunies Ross |year=2002 |editor1-last=Acker |editor1-first=Paul |editor2-last=Larrington |editor2-first=Carolyne |chapter=Reading ''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a'' |title=The Poetic Edda: Essays on Old Norse Mythology |pages=194 |isbn=0815316607 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlozzi |first1=Alfred F. |last2=Choate |first2=Kurt T |year=2018 |title=Transgender and Gender Diverse Persons: A Handbook |pages=266 |isbn=1351207091 }}</ref> some modern works interpret or depict the deity as [[genderfluid]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Birkedal |first1=K.

He has previously played for a number of different clubs in England and Scotland including [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], [[Bury F.C.|Bury]], [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]], [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] and [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]].\n\n==Club career==\nCoke began his career as a youth player at [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in 2003, before teaming up with his older brother [http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/sport/football/9357448.Coke_relishing_return_to_Ks/?ref=rss Jon] at non-league side [[Kingstonian F.C.|Kingstonian]] a year later.\n\n===Mansfield Town===\nCoke was soon snapped up by [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]] and signed his first professional contract on 31 March 2005.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mansfield Town offer contracts to duo|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/mansfield_town/4397919.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 March 2005|accessdate=14 August 2014}}</ref>  He scored his first goal for the club in the second round of the [[League Cup]] in the 1\u20130 win against [[Southampton FC|Southampton]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Mansfield Town 1\u20130 Southampton|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/4258478.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 September 2005|accessdate=14 August 2014}}</ref> which still heralds fond memories for Coke.  He then went on to score two goals in two appearances against [[Leyton Orient FC|Leyton Orient]] and [[Shrewsbury Town FC|Shrewsbury Town]] respectively, before being linked with several [[Championship League]] clubs, including: [[Southampton FC|Southampton]], [[Reading FC|Reading]], [[Norwich City FC.|Norwich City]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers FC|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].\n\nIn April 2006, Coke turned down a new two-year contract with [[The Stags]], but was persuaded by manager [[Peter Shirtliff]] to sign a one-year contract to remain at [[Field Mill]] for another year.  However, during the 2006/7 season, Coke suffered an injury that sidelined him for most of the season.  His misfortune continued the following season, which resulted in limited appearances for the club.  Despite this, Coke had still impressed enough to entice other clubs; most notably [[Wycombe Wanderers FC|Wycombe Wanderers]], to want to sign him.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wycombe to move for Mansfield
