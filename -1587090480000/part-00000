{"title_page": "Weiya", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{No footnotes|date=February 2015}}\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2015}}\n{{Orphan|date=October 2015}}\n}}\n\n'''Weiya''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|\u5c3e\u7259}}}}) is a traditional annual celebration for [[Tu Di Gong]] (the earth god, also known as Fude Zhengshen (\u798f\u5fb7\u6b63\u795e), the god of wealth and merit) on the 16th of the 12th lunar month in Chinese society, especially in [[Taiwan]]. Weiya is the last of the bimonthly [[Ya festival]]s honoring the earth god in the [[Chinese calendar|Chinese lunar calendar]]. In Taiwan, Weiya is also an occasion for employers to treat their employees to a banquet to thank them for their hard work throughout the year.\n\n==Origin==\nYa (traditional and simplified Chinese: \u7259), originally means the agent who is trading in the market. In ancient times, the Chinese used the character \u2018hu\u2019 (\u4e92) to describe the action of trading. In the [[Tang dynasty]], \u2018hu\u2019 (\u4e92) and \u2018ya\u2019(\u7259) became similar in writing, so people started to use \u2018Ya\u2019(\u7259) to describe the action of trading instead of \u2018hu\u2019(\u4e92) ever since then.\n\nThe Ya-festival was first started to celebrate and show people's respect to Tu Di Gong, believing that Tu Di Gong was the god who could protect their business and bring more customers. Taiwanese businessmen, especially, have traditionally been superstitions on dedicating to many different gods who may be able to prevent accidents or to improve their business. Businessmen who are trading in the market believe Tu Di Gong is the god who has the power to protect the ground, while they mostly have actual shops to do business. Since then, the \u2019Ya\u2019-festival has been a tradition in Chinese society and especially in Taiwan.\n\nThe public will usually gather some meat and fruit for the ceremony, and they will share the food after the ceremony. During normal times in a year, the ceremonies tend to be small, but the end of year ceremony (Weiya) is the biggest one. Traditionally, Weiya is the day to hold a ceremony for the \u2018Fude Zhengshen\u2019 (Tu Di Gong). There will be a series of ceremonies in front of the Tu Di Gong temple. People will bring firecrackers, candles, and sacrifices to the temple.\n\n==Modern times==\nWeiya in modern times has taken on another role in Taiwanese culture and society. It is not only a religious ceremony, but has also become a social event in many companies. Employers will treat their employees to a traditional Weiya banquet to show their thankfulness for their employee's hard work over the past year. It is a way for the employers to communicate with their employees, so it has become a big catering event in many companies. Many different entertaining shows come along with the Weiya banquet. Many large companies will spend a lot on hiring performers or having a prize draw.\n\nIn the old Sino-Taiwanese culture, there would be a boiled chicken dish in the Weiya banquet, if the employer decided not to keep hiring an employee in the coming year, they would serve the soup to the table with the chicken's head pointing at an employee as a hint that he or she might be dismissed. Employers usually  give out an end of year bonus. If an employee does not receive it, that can mean that he or she might be facing possible dismissal. This has made the Weiya banquet a stressful time for employees. However, the relationship between employers and their employees has slightly changed in the recent times, and Weiya banquets have changed as well. The chicken head has been avoided in most of the Weiya banquet's menu.\n\n==Traditional food==\nThere are a few traditional foods made by ordinary Taiwanese families during the Weiya time. ''[[Koah-pau]]'' ({{zh|links=no|c=[[:zh:\u5272\u5305|\u5272\u5305]]}}), a \u2018subway\u2019-type bread roll, contains pork, peanut powder, coriander and Chinese pickle, etc. [[Popiah]] ({{zh|links=no|c=\u6f64\u9905}}), a freshly made alternative of traditional Chinese spring roll. Both dishes are commonly made at the time of Weiya as a way to celebrate it.\n\n==Taboos==\nWeiya is an event in which businessmen hope for better business in the coming year. In Taiwanese culture, medical centers, pharmacies and funeral homes will not celebrate Weiya since it would be inappropriate for these kinds of businesses to hope for better business.\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web|url=http://ttf.ncfta.gov.tw/en-us/Season/Content.aspx?Para=13|title=The beauty of Festivals in Taiwan|publisher=Ttf.ncfta.gov.tw|accessdate=2014-03-23}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.goldendragontruro.co.uk/index.php/cult-festivals-longtaitou-1-e|title=Alert! - ESET NOD32 Antivirus|publisher=Goldendragontruro.co.uk|accessdate=2014-03-23}}\n\n[[Category:Festivals in Taiwan]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{No footnotes|date=February 2015}}\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2015}}\n{{Orphan|date=October 2015}}\n}}\n\n'''Weiya''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|\u5c3e\u7259}}}}) is a traditional annual celebration for [[Tu Di Gong]] (the earth god, also known as Fude Zhengshen (\u798f\u5fb7\u6b63\u795e), the god of wealth and merit) on the 16th of the 12th lunar month in Chinese society, especially in [[Taiwan]].

These dates, however, are not absolute, since written Old Norse is found well into the 15th century.{{sfn|Torp|Vik\u00f8r|1993}}\n\nOld Norse was divided into three [[dialect]]s: [[Old West Norse]], [[Old East Norse]], and [[Old Gutnish]]. Old West and East Norse formed a [[dialect continuum]], with no clear geographical boundary between them. For example, Old East Norse traits were found in eastern [[Norway]], although Old Norwegian is classified as Old West Norse, and Old West Norse traits were found in western [[Sweden]]. Most speakers spoke Old East Norse in what is present-day [[Denmark]] and Sweden. Old Gutnish, the more obscure dialectal branch, is sometimes included in the Old East Norse dialect due to geographical associations. It developed its own unique features and shared in changes to both other branches.\n\nThe 12th-century Icelandic ''[[Gray Goose Laws]]'' state that Swedes, Norwegians, Icelanders, and Danes spoke the same language, ''d\u01ebnsk tunga'' (\"Danish tongue\"; speakers of Old East Norse would have said ''dansk tunga''). Another term, used especially commonly with reference to West Norse, was ''norr\u0153nt m\u00e1l'' or ''norr\u01ffnt m\u00e1l'' (\"Nordic/Northern speech\"). Today Old Norse has developed into the modern North Germanic languages [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] (both inherited cases from the language), [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], of which Norwegian, Danish and Swedish retain considerable [[mutual intelligibility]].\n\n== Geographical distribution ==\n{{Old Norse language map}}\n[[Old Norse#Old Icelandic|Old Icelandic]] was very close to [[Old Norwegian]], and together they formed the Old West Norse dialect, which was also spoken in settlements in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], the [[Isle of Man]] and northwest England, and in Norse settlements in [[Normandy]].<ref name=\"JohnsonEcyc\">{{harvnb|Adams|1899|loc= \"Scandinavian Languages\", pp. 336\u2013338}}</ref> The Old East Norse dialect was spoken in Denmark, Sweden, settlements in [[Kievan Rus']],<ref name=\"Nationalencyklopedin\">{{citation| title = Nordiska spr\u00e5k| at = \u00a7 ''Historia'', \u00a7\u00a7 ''Omkring 800\u20131100''| work = [[Nationalencyklopedin]]| language = Swedish | year = 1994}}</ref> eastern England, and Danish settlements in [[Normandy]]. The [[Old Gutnish]] dialect was spoken in [[Gotland]] and in various settlements in the East. In the 11th century, Old Norse was the most widely spoken European language, ranging from [[Vinland]] in the West to the [[Volga River]] in the East. In [[Kievan Rus']], it survived the longest in [[Veliky Novgorod]], probably lasting into the [[13th century]] there.<ref name=\"Nationalencyklopedin\" /> The age of the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland]] is strongly contested, but at latest by the time of the [[Second Swedish Crusade]] in the 13th century, Swedish settlement had spread the language into the region.\n\n== Modern descendants ==\n{{Main|North Germanic languages}}\nThe modern descendants of the Old West Norse dialect are the West Scandinavian languages of [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and the extinct [[Norn language]] of [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]]; the descendants of the Old East Norse dialect are the East Scandinavian languages of [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Norwegian is descended from Old West Norse, but over the centuries it has been heavily influenced by East Norse, particularly during the [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] union.\n\nAmong these, the grammar of Icelandic and the Faroese have changed the least from Old Norse in the last thousand years. In contrast, the pronunciation of both Icelandic and Faroese have changed considerably from Old Norse. With Danish rule of the Faroe Islands, Faroese has also been influenced by Danish. Old Norse also had an influence on [[English language|English]] dialects and [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]], which contain many Old Norse [[loanword]]s. It also influenced the development of the [[Norman language]], and through it and to a smaller extent, that of modern [[French language|French]].\n\nOf the modern languages, Icelandic is the closest to Old Norse seen to grammar and vocabulary. Written modern Icelandic derives from the Old Norse [[phoneme|phonemic]] writing system. Contemporary Icelandic-speakers can read Old Norse, which varies slightly in spelling as well as semantics and word order. However, pronunciation, particularly of the vowel phonemes, has changed at least as much in Icelandic as in the other North Germanic languages.\n\nFaroese retains many similarities but is influenced by Danish, Norwegian, and [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] ([[Scottish Gaelic|Scottish]] and/or [[Irish language|Irish]]).{{sfn|van der Auwera|K\u00f6nig|1994|loc = \"Faroese\" (Barnes & Weyhe), p. 217}} Although Swedish, Danish and the Norwegian languages have diverged the most, they still retain [[mutual intelligibility]].{{sfn|Moberg|Gooskens|Nerbonne|Vaillette|2007}} Speakers of modern Swedish, Norwegian and Danish can mostly understand each other without studying their neighboring languages, particularly if speaking slowly. The languages are also sufficiently similar in writing that they can mostly be understood across borders. This could be because these languages have been mutually affected by each other, as well as having a similar development influenced by [[Middle Low German]].<ref>''See, e.g.'', {{harvnb|Harbert|2007|pp=7\u201310}}</ref>\n\n===Other influenced languages===\nVarious other languages, which are not closely related, have been heavily influenced by Norse, particularly the [[Norman language]]. [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] also have a number of Norse loanwords; the words ''Rus'' and ''Russia'', according to one theory, may be named after the [[Rus' people]], a Norse tribe; ''see [[Rus (name)]]'', probably from present-day east-central Sweden.

The [[Old Norse orthography#Normalized spelling|standardized orthography]] marks the long vowels with an acute accent. In medieval manuscripts, it is often unmarked but sometimes marked with an accent or through [[gemination]].\n\nOld Norse had nasalized versions of all ten vowel places.<ref name=\"CleasbyA\" group=\"cv\">{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigf\u00fasson|1874|loc= p.1, \"A\"}}</ref> These occurred as allophones of the vowels before nasal consonants and in places where a nasal had followed it in an older form of the word, before it was absorbed into a neighboring sound. If the nasal was absorbed by a stressed vowel, it would also lengthen the vowel. These nasalizations also occurred in the other Germanic languages, but were not retained long. They were noted in the [[First Grammatical Treatise]], and otherwise might have remained unknown. The First Grammarian marked these with a dot above the letter.<ref name=\"CleasbyA\" group=\"cv\" /> This notation did not catch on, and would soon be obsolete.

It is unclear whether they were sequences of two consonants (with the first element realised as {{IPA|/h/}} or perhaps {{IPA|/x/}}) or as single voiceless sonorants {{IPA|/l\u0325/}}, {{IPA|/r\u0325/}} and {{IPA|/n\u0325/}} respectively. In Old Norwegian, Old Danish and later Old Swedish, the groups ''hl'', ''hr'', ''hn'' were reduced to plain ''l'', ''r'', ''n'', which suggests that they had most likely already been pronounced as voiceless sonorants by Old Norse times.\n\nThe pronunciation of ''hv'' is unclear, but it may have been {{IPA|/x\u02b7/}} (the Proto-Germanic pronunciation), {{IPA|/h\u02b7/}} or the similar phoneme {{IPA|/\u028d/}}. Unlike the three other digraphs, it was retained much longer in all dialects. Without ever developing into a voiceless sonorant in Icelandic, it instead underwent [[fortition]] to a plosive {{IPA|/kv/}}, which suggests that instead of being a voiceless sonorant, it retained a stronger frication.\n\n=== Orthography ===\n{{Main|Old Norse orthography}}\nUnlike Proto-Norse, which was written with the [[Elder Futhark]], runic Old Norse was originally written with the [[Younger Futhark]], which had only 16 letters. Because of the limited number of runes, several runes were used for different sounds, and long and short vowels were not distinguished in writing. [[Medieval runes]] came into use some time later.\n\nAs for the [[Latin alphabet]], there was no standardized orthography in use in the Middle Ages. A modified version of the letter [[wynn]] called [[vend (letter)|vend]] was used briefly for the sounds {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/v/}}, and {{IPA|/w/}}. Long vowels were sometimes marked with acutes but also sometimes left unmarked or geminated. The [[Old Norse orthography#Normalized spelling|standardized Old Norse spelling]] was created in the 19th century and is, for the most part, phonemic. The most notable deviation is that the nonphonemic difference between the [[voiced dental fricative|voiced]] and the [[voiceless dental fricative]] is marked. The oldest texts and [[runic inscriptions]] use [[thorn (letter)|''\u00fe'']] exclusively. Long vowels are denoted with [[acute accent|acutes]]. Most other letters are written with the same glyph as the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] phoneme, except as shown in the table below.\n\n=== Accent ===\n{{See also|St\u00f8d|Norwegian phonology#Accent|Swedish phonology#Stress and pitch|l1=Danish st\u00f8d|l2=Norwegian tonal stress|l3=Swedish tonal stress}}\n{{Expand section|Dating, etc.|date=April 2010}}\n\nPrimary [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] in Old Norse falls on the [[word stem]], so that ''hyrjar'' would be pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8hyr.jar/}}. In compound words, secondary stress falls on the second stem (e.g. ''[[wikt:l\u00e6risveinn#Old Norse|l\u00e6risveinn]]'', {{IPA|/\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0\u027e.i\u02ccsw\u025bin\u02d0/}}).<ref name=\"ProseReader\">{{harvnb|Vigf\u00fasson|Powell|1879|loc=  Ch. 1}}</ref>\n\n== Phonological processes ==\n=== Ablaut ===\n[[Indo-European ablaut|Ablaut]] patterns are groups of vowels which are swapped, or ''ablauted,'' in the [[Syllable nucleus|nucleus]] of a word. [[Old Norse morphology#Strong verbs|Strong verbs]] ablaut the [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]]'s nucleus to derive the past forms of the verb. This parallels English conjugation, where, e.g., the nucleus of ''sing'' becomes ''sang'' in the past tense and ''sung'' in the past participle. Some verbs are derived by ablaut, as the [[Old Norse morphology#Present-preterite verbs|present-in-past verbs]] do by consequence of being derived from the past tense forms of strong verbs.\n\n=== Umlaut ===\n{{See also|Germanic umlaut|Old Norse morphology#Before Old Norse|l2=Old Norse morphophonology}}\n\nUmlaut or mutation is an [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilatory]] process acting on vowels preceding a vowel or semivowel of a different [[vowel backness]]. In the case of ''i-umlaut'' and ''\u0280-umlaut'', this entails a fronting of back vowels, with retention of lip rounding. In the case of ''u-umlaut'', this entails [[labialization]] of unrounded vowels. Umlaut is phonemic and in many situations grammatically significant as a side effect of losing the [[Proto-Germanic language#Morphology|Proto-Germanic morphological suffixes]] whose vowels created the umlaut [[allophones]].\n\nSome {{IPA|/y/}}, {{IPA|/y\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/\u00f8/}}, {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/\u00f8y/}},<ref name=\"FromOldNordic\" /> and all {{IPA|/\u025bi/}} were obtained by [[i-mutation|i-umlaut]] from {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/au/}}, and {{IPA|/ai/}} respectively.

Most of the fused [[morpheme]]s are retained in modern Icelandic, especially in regard to noun case declensions, whereas modern Norwegian in comparison has moved towards more analytical word structures.\n\n=== Gender ===\n{{Further|Grammatical gender}}\nOld Norse had three [[grammatical gender]]s \u2013 masculine, feminine and neuter. Adjectives or pronouns referring to a noun must [[Agreement (linguistics)|mirror the gender of that noun]], so that one says, \"heill ma\u00f0r!\" but, \"heilt barn!\" As in other languages, the grammatical gender of an impersonal noun is generally unrelated to an expected natural gender of that noun. While indeed ''karl'', \"man\" is masculine, ''kona'', \"woman\", is feminine, and ''h\u00fas'', house, is neuter, so also are ''hrafn'' and ''kr\u00e1ka'', for \"raven\" and \"crow\", masculine and feminine respectively, even in reference to a female raven or a male crow.\n\nAll neuter words have identical nominative and accusative forms,{{sfn|Old Norse for Beginners|loc = [http://www3.hi.is/~haukurth/norse/grammar/neutern.php Neuter nouns]}} and all feminine words have identical nominative and accusative plurals.{{sfn|Old Norse for Beginners|loc =  [http://www3.hi.is/~haukurth/norse/grammar/femininen.php Feminine nouns]}}\n\nThe gender of some words' plurals does not agree with that of their singulars, such as ''lim'' and ''mund''.<ref group=\"cv\">{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigf\u00fasson |1874|loc= p.&nbsp;389 col.1, \"LIM\"; p.&nbsp;437, col.1 \"MUND\"}}</ref> Some words, such as ''hungr'', have multiple genders, evidenced by their [[Determiner (linguistics)|determiners]] being declined in different genders within a given sentence.{{sfn|''The Menota handbook''|loc=Ch. 8 \u00a73.2.1 \"Gender\"}}{{sfn|Zo\u00ebga|1910|loc = H: ''hungr''}}\n\n=== Morphology ===\n{{Main|Old Norse morphology}}\nNouns, adjectives and pronouns were [[declension|declined]] in four grammatical cases{{snd}}[[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive case|genitive]] and [[dative case|dative]]{{snd}}in singular and plural numbers. Adjectives and pronouns were additionally declined in three grammatical genders. Some pronouns (first and second person) could have [[dual (grammatical number)|dual number]] in addition to singular and plural. The genitive was used [[partitive case|partitively]] and in compounds and [[kenning]]s (e.g., ''[[Ur\u00f0arbrunnr]]'', the well of Ur\u00f0r; ''[[Lokasenna]]'', the [[gibing]] of Loki).\n\nThere were several classes of nouns within each gender. The following is an example of the \"strong\" [[inflectional paradigm]]s:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | The strong masculine noun '''armr''' (English '''arm''')\n|-\n! Case !! '''Singular''' !! '''Plural'''\n|-\n| '''Nominative''' || armr || armar\n|-\n| '''Accusative''' || arm || rowspan=\"2\" | arma\n|-\n| '''Genitive''' || arms\n|-\n| '''Dative''' || armi ||  \u01ebrmum/armum\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | The feminine noun '''h\u01ebll''' (OWN), '''hall''' (OEN) (English '''hall''')\n|-\n!

This definite article, however, was a separate word and did not become attached to the noun before later stages of the Old Norse period.\n\n== Texts ==\n{{Commons category|Old Norse manuscripts}}\nThe earliest inscriptions in Old Norse are [[runic alphabet|runic]], from the 8th century. Runes continued to be commonly used until the 15th century and have been recorded to be in use in some form as late as the 19th century in some parts of Sweden. With the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|conversion to Christianity]] in the 11th century came the [[Latin alphabet]]. The oldest preserved texts in Old Norse in the Latin alphabet date from the middle of the 12th century. Subsequently, Old Norse became the vehicle of a large and varied body of vernacular literature, unique in medieval Europe. Most of the surviving literature was written in Iceland. Best known are the [[Norse saga]]s, the [[Icelanders' sagas]] and the mythological literature, but there also survives a large body of religious literature, translations into Old Norse of [[courtly romance]]s, classical mythology, and the Old Testament, as well as instructional material, [[First Grammatical Treatise|grammatical treatises]] and a large body of letters and official documents.{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2004|p=22\u2013102}}\n\n== Dialects ==\nMost of the innovations that appeared in Old Norse spread evenly through the Old Norse area. As a result, the dialects were very similar and considered to be the same language, a language that they sometimes called the Danish tongue (''D\u01ebnsk tunga''), sometimes Norse language (''Norr\u0153nt m\u00e1l''), as evidenced in the following two quotes from [[Heimskringla]] by [[Snorri Sturluson]]:\n\n{{Verse translation|M\u00f3\u00f0ir Dyggva var Dr\u00f3tt, d\u00f3ttir Danps konungs, sonar R\u00edgs er fyrstr var konungr kalla\u00f0r \u00e1 danska tungu.\n|attr1=[[Heimskringla]], Ynglinga saga \u00a7 20. ''Dau\u00f0i Dyggva''\n|Dyggvi's mother was Drott, the daughter of king Danp, R\u00edg's son, who was the first to be called king in the Danish tongue.\n}}\n\n{{Verse translation|...stirt var honum norr\u0153nt m\u00e1l, ok kylfdi m\u1d0a\u01ebk til or\u00f0anna, ok h\u01ebf\u00f0u margir menn \u00feat m\u1d0a\u01ebk at spotti.\n|attr1=[[Heimskringla]], Saga Sigur\u00f0ar J\u00f3rsalafara, Eysteins ok \u00d3lafs \u00a7 35(34). ''Fr\u00e1 ve\u00f0jan Haralds ok Magn\u00fas''\n|...the Norse language was hard for him, and he often fumbled for words, which amused people greatly.\n}}\n\nHowever, some changes were geographically limited and so created a dialectal difference between Old West Norse and Old East Norse.\n\nAs Proto-Norse evolved into Old Norse, in the 8th century, the effects of the [[Germanic umlaut|umlauts]] seem to have been very much the same over the whole Old Norse area. But in later dialects of the language a split occurred mainly between west and east as the use of umlauts began to vary. The typical umlauts (for example ''fylla'' from *''fullijan'') were better preserved in the West due to later generalizations in the east where many instances of umlaut were removed (many archaic Eastern texts as well as eastern runic inscriptions however portray the same extent of umlauts as in later Western Old Norse).\n\nAll the while, the changes resulting in [[breaking (linguistics)|breaking]] (for example ''hiarta'' from *''hert\u014d'') were more influential in the East probably once again due to generalizations within the inflectional system. This difference was one of the greatest reasons behind the dialectalization that took place in the 9th and 10th centuries, shaping an Old West Norse dialect in Norway and the Atlantic settlements and an Old East Norse dialect in Denmark and Sweden.\n\nOld West Norse and Old Gutnish did not take part in the monophthongization which changed ''\u00e6i'' (''ei'') into ''\u0113'', ''\u00f8y'' (''ey'') and ''au'' into ''\u00f8\u0304'', nor did certain peripheral dialects of Swedish, as seen in modern [[Swedish dialects in Ostrobothnia|Ostrobothnian dialects]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://aveneca.com/westeast.html|title=The Old Norse dialect areas| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707195311/http://aveneca.com/westeast.html| archivedate = 7 Jul 2011| year =2009 | work = aveneca.com}}</ref> Another difference was that Old West Norse lost certain combinations of consonants. The combinations -''mp''-, -''nt''-, and -''nk''- were assimilated into -''pp''-, -''tt''- and -''kk''- in Old West Norse, but this phenomenon was limited in Old East Norse.\n\nHere is a comparison between the two dialects as well as Old Gutnish. It is a transcription from one of the [[Funbo Runestones]] (U 990) from the eleventh century (translation: 'Ve\u00f0r and Thane and Gunnar raised this stone after Haursi, their father. God help his spirit'):\n{{block indent|Ve\u00f0r ok \u00deegn ok Gunnarr reistu stein \u00feenna at Haursa, f\u01eb\u00f0ur sinn. Gu\u00f0 hjalpi \u01ebnd hans.

Modern studies{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} have shown that the positions where it applies are the same as for runic Old West Norse. An alternative and probably more accurate transliteration would therefore render the text in OEN as such:\n{{block indent|Ve\u00f0r ok \u00deegn ok Gunnarr r\u00e6istu st\u00e6in \u00feenna at Haursa, f\u01eb\u00f0ur sinn. Gu\u00f0 hialpi \u01ebnd hans (OEN)}}\n\nSome [[past participle]]s and other words underwent i-umlaut in Old West Norse but not in Old East Norse dialects. Examples of that are Icelandic slegi\u00f0/sleginn and teki\u00f0/tekinn, which in Swedish are [[:wikt:slagit|slagit]]/[[:wikt:slagen|slagen]] and [[:wikt:tagit|tagit]]/[[:wikt:tagen|tagen]]. This can also be seen in the Icelandic and Norwegian words [[:wikt:sterkur|sterkur]] and [[:wikt:sterk|sterk]] (\"strong\"), which in Swedish is [[:wikt:stark|stark]] as in Old Swedish.<ref>{{citation| url = http://runeberg.org/svetym/0950.html | title = stark | page = 862 |work = Svensk etymologisk ordbok [Swedish etymological dictionary]|language = Swedish | year = 1922 | editor-first = Elof| editor-last = Hellquist | editorlink =Elof Hellquist }}</ref> These differences can also be seen in comparison between Norwegian and Swedish.\n\n=== Old West Norse ===\nThe combinations ''-mp-'', ''-nt-'', and ''-nk-'' mostly merged to ''-pp-'', ''-tt-'' and ''-kk-'' in Old West Norse around the 7th century, marking the first distinction between the Eastern and Western dialects.{{sfn|Bandle|2005|loc = Ch.

Old West Norse was also characterized by the preservation of ''u''-umlaut, which meant that, for example, [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]] *''tan\u00feu'', \"tooth\", was pronounced ''t\u01ebnn'' and not ''tann'' as in post-runic Old East Norse; OWN ''g\u01eb\u0301s'' and runic OEN ''g\u01eb\u0301s'', while post-runic OEN ''g\u00e1s'' \"goose\".\n\nThe earliest body of text appears in [[runic inscriptions]] and in poems composed c. 900 by [[\u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr of Hvinir]] (although the poems are not preserved in contemporary sources, but only in much later manuscripts). The earliest manuscripts are from the period 1150\u20131200 and concern both legal, religious and historical matters. During the 12th and 13th centuries, [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] and [[Western Norway]] were the most important areas of the Norwegian kingdom and they shaped Old West Norse as an archaic language with a rich set of declensions. In the body of text that has survived into the modern day from until c. 1300, Old West Norse had little dialect variation, and [[Old Icelandic]] does not diverge much more than the [[Old Norwegian]] dialects do from each other.\n\nOld Norwegian differentiated early from Old Icelandic by the loss of the consonant ''h'' in initial position before ''l'', ''n'' and ''r''; thus whereas Old Icelandic manuscripts might use the form ''hnefi'', \"fist\", Old Norwegian manuscripts might use ''nefi''.\n\nFrom the late 13th century, Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian started to diverge more. After c. 1350, the [[Black Death]] and following social upheavals seem to have accelerated language changes in Norway. From the late 14th century, the language used in Norway is generally referred to as [[Old Norwegian#Middle Norwegian|Middle Norwegian]].\n\nOld West Norse underwent a lengthening of initial vowels at some point, especially in Norwegian, so that OWN ''eta'' became ''\u00e9ta,'' ONW ''akr'' > ''\u00e1kr'', OIC ''ek'' > ''\u00e9k''.<ref>{{citation |title=Further Old Norse Secondary Formations |first=Albert Morey |last=Sturtevant |journal=Language |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=457\u2013462 |year=1953  |jstor=409955 |doi=10.2307/409955 }}</ref>\n\n==== Old Icelandic ====\nIn Iceland, initial {{IPA|/w/}} before {{IPA|/\u027e/}} was lost:<ref group=\"cv\">{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigf\u00fasson |1874|loc = p.&nbsp;481 \"R\"}}</ref> compare Icelandic ''[[wikt:rangur#Icelandic|rangur]]'' with Norwegian ''vrangr'', OEN ''vrang\u0280''.

When the colonies died out around the 15th century, the dialect went with it.

It is inscribed on both sides.]]\nOld East Norse, between 800 and 1100, is called ''Runic Swedish'' in Sweden and ''Runic Danish'' in Denmark, but for geographical rather than linguistic reasons. Any differences between the two were minute at best during the more ancient stages of this dialect group. Changes had a tendency to occur earlier in the Danish region. Even today many Old Danish changes have still not taken place in modern Swedish. Swedish is therefore the more [[Linguistic conservatism|conservative]] of the two in both the ancient and the modern languages, sometimes by a profound margin but in general, differences are still minute. The language is called \"runic\" because the body of text appears in [[runes]].\n\nRunic Old East Norse is characteristically conservative in form, especially Swedish (which is still true for modern Swedish compared to Danish). In essence it matches or surpasses the conservatism of post-runic Old West Norse, which in turn is generally more conservative than post-runic Old East Norse. While typically \"Eastern\" in structure, many later post-runic changes and trademarks of OEN had yet to happen.\n\nThe phoneme ''\u0280'', which evolved during the Proto-Norse period from ''z'', was still clearly separated from ''r'' in most positions, even when being geminated, while in OWN it had already merged with ''r''.\n\nMonophthongization of ''\u00e6i > \u0113'' and ''\u00f8y, au > \u00f8\u0304'' started in mid-10th-century Denmark.<ref name=\"FromOldNordic\" /> Compare runic OEN: ''f\u00e6ig\u0280'', ''g\u00e6i\u0280\u0280'', ''haug\u0280'', ''m\u00f8yd\u014dm\u0280'', ''di\u016b\u0280''; with Post-runic OEN: ''f\u0113gher'', ''g\u0113r'', ''h\u00f8\u0304gher'', ''m\u00f8\u0304d\u014dmber'', ''di\u016br''; OWN: ''[[wikt:feigr|feigr]]'', ''[[wikt:geirr|geirr]]'', ''[[wikt:howe|haugr]]'', ''meyd\u00f3mr'', ''d\u00fdr''; from PN *faigiaz, *gaizaz, *haugaz, *mawi- + d\u014dmaz 'maidendom; virginity', *diuza '(wild) animal'.\n\nFeminine o-stems often preserve the plural ending -a\u0280, while in OWN they more often merge with the feminine i-stems: (runic OEN) ''*s\u014dla\u0280'', ''*hafna\u0280''/''*hamna\u0280'', ''*v\u0101ga\u0280'' versus OWN ''s\u00f3lir'', ''hafnir'' and ''v\u00e1gir'' (modern Swedish ''solar'', ''hamnar'', ''v\u00e5gar'' (\"suns, havens, scales\"); Danish has mainly lost the distinction between the two stems, with both endings now being rendered as ''-er'' or ''-e'' alternatively for the o-stems).\n\nVice versa, masculine i-stems with the root ending in either ''g'' or ''k'' tended to shift the plural ending to that of the ja-stems while OEN kept the original: ''dr\u00e6ngia\u0280'', ''*\u00e6lgia\u0280'' and ''*b\u00e6nkia\u0280'' versus OWN ''[[wikt:drengr#Old Norse|drengir]]'', ''elgir'' (\"elks\") and ''[[wikt:bekkr#Etymology 1|bekkir]]'' (modern Danish ''[[wikt:dreng|drenge]]'', ''[[wikt:elg|elge]]'', ''[[wikt:b\u00e6nk|b\u00e6nke]]'', modern Swedish ''[[wikt:dr\u00e4ng|dr\u00e4ngar]]'', ''\u00e4lgar'', ''b\u00e4nkar'').\n\nThe plural ending of ja-stems were mostly preserved while those of OEN often acquired that of the i-stems: ''*b\u00e6\u00f0ia\u0280'', ''*b\u00e6kkia\u0280'', ''*v\u00e6fia\u0280'' versus OWN ''be\u00f0ir'' (\"beds\"), ''[[wikt:bekkr#Etymology 2|bekkir]]'', ''[[wikt:vefr#Old Norse|vefir]]'' (modern Swedish ''b\u00e4ddar'', ''b\u00e4ckar'', ''v\u00e4var'').\n\n==== Old Danish ====\n{{Further|History of Danish}}\nUntil the early 12th century, Old East Norse was very much a uniform dialect. It was in Denmark that the first innovations appeared that would differentiate Old Danish from Old Swedish ({{harvnb|Bandle|2005|loc = ''Old East Nordic'', pp.&nbsp;1856, 1859}}) as these innovations spread north unevenly (unlike the earlier changes that spread more evenly over the East Norse area), creating a series of [[isogloss]]es going from [[Zealand]] to [[Svealand]].\n\nIn Old Danish, {{IPA|/h\u027e/}} merged with {{IPA|/\u027e/}} during the 9th century.<ref>{{citation| first = Tarrin | last =  Wills | title = The Anonymous Verse in the Third Grammatical Treatise| url  =https://sro.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/10765/54631 | year = 2006 | isbn = | publisher = The Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Durham University }}</ref> From the 11th to 14th centuries, the unstressed vowels -''a'', -''o'' and -''e'' ([[Old Norse orthography#Normalized spelling|standard normalization]] -''a'', -''u'' and -''i'') started to merge into -''\u0259'', represented with the letter ''e''. This vowel came to be [[epenthesis|epenthetic]], particularly before ''-\u0280'' endings.<ref name=\"TheNordicLanguages\" /> At the same time, the voiceless [[stop consonant]]s ''p'', ''t'' and ''k'' became voiced plosives and even [[fricative consonant]]s. Resulting from these innovations, Danish has ''kage'' (cake), ''tunger'' (tongues) and ''g\u00e6ster'' (guests) whereas (Standard) Swedish has retained older forms, ''kaka'', ''tungor'' and ''g\u00e4ster'' (OEN ''kaka'', ''tungur'', ''g\u00e6stir'').\n\nMoreover, the Danish [[pitch accent]] shared with Norwegian and Swedish changed into ''[[st\u00f8d]]'' around this time.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==== Old Swedish ====\n{{Further|Old Swedish}}\nAt the end of the 10th and early 11th century initial ''h-'' before ''l'', ''n'' and ''r'' was still preserved in the middle and northern parts of Sweden, and is sporadically still preserved in some northern dialects as ''g-'', e.g. ''gly'' (lukewarm), from ''hl\u00fd\u0280''.

It is the oldest text written as a manuscript found in Sweden and from the 13th century. It is contemporaneous with most of the Icelandic literature. The text marks the beginning of [[Old Swedish]] as a distinct dialect.\n{{Verse translation|\nDr\u00e6p\u00e6r ma\u00fear sv\u00e6nskan man eller smalensk\u00e6n, innan konongsrikis man, eigh v\u00e6stg\u00f8skan, b\u00f8te firi atta \u00f8rtogher ok \u00ferettan mark\u00e6r ok \u00e6nga \u00e6tar bot.

For example, the diphthong ''ai'' in ''aigu'', ''\u00feair'' and ''waita'' was not retroactively{{clarify|date=June 2019}} umlauted to ''ei'' as in e.g. Old Icelandic ''eigu'', ''\u00feeir'' and ''veita''. Gutnish also shows dropping of {{IPA|/w/}} in initial {{IPA|/w\u027e/}}, which it shares with the Old West Norse dialects (except Old East Norwegian<ref>{{cite book |last=Noreen |first=Adolf |title=Altnordische Grammatik I: Altisl\u00e4ndische und altnorwegische Grammatik  |url=http://www.arnastofnun.is/solofile/1016380 |publisher= |page=211 (\u00a7 288, note 1)}}</ref>), but which is otherwise abnormal. Breaking was also particularly active in Old Gutnish, leading to e.g. ''biera'' versus mainland ''bera''.<ref name=\"TheNordicLanguages\" />\n\n==== Text example ====\nThe [[Gutasaga]] is the longest text surviving from [[Old Gutnish]]. It was written in the 13th century and dealt with the early history of the Gotlanders. This part relates to the agreement that the Gotlanders had with the Swedish king sometime before the 9th century:\n\n{{Verse translation|\nSo gingu gutar sielfs wiliandi vndir suia kunung \u00fey at \u00feair mattin frir Oc frelsir sykia suiariki j huerium sta\u00fe. vtan tull oc allar utgiftir.

Likewise, the Swedes had the right to go to Gotland without corn restrictions or other prohibitions. The king was to provide protection and help, when they needed it and asked for it. The king and the jarl shall send emissaries to the Gutnish ''thing'' to receive the taxes. These emissaries shall declare free passage for the Gotlanders to all locations in the sea of the king at Uppsala and likewise for everyone who wanted to travel to Gotland.\n|attr1={{harvnb|Gutasaga|loc= \u00a7 ''Intr\u00e4det i Sverige''}}\n|attr2=\n}}\n\n== Relationship to other languages ==\n=== Relationship to English ===\n{{See also|History of English#Scandinavian influence|List of English words of Old Norse origin}}\n[[Old English]] and Old Norse were related languages.

This is because both [[English language|English]] and Old Norse stem from a [[Proto-Germanic]] mother language.

These dates, however, are not absolute, since written Old Norse is found well into the 15th century.{{sfn|Torp|Vik\u00f8r|1993}}\n\nOld Norse was divided into three [[dialect]]s: [[Old West Norse]], [[Old East Norse]], and [[Old Gutnish]]. Old West and East Norse formed a [[dialect continuum]], with no clear geographical boundary between them. For example, Old East Norse traits were found in eastern [[Norway]], although Old Norwegian is classified as Old West Norse, and Old West Norse traits were found in western [[Sweden]]. Most speakers spoke Old East Norse in what is present-day [[Denmark]] and Sweden. Old Gutnish, the more obscure dialectal branch, is sometimes included in the Old East Norse dialect due to geographical associations. It developed its own unique features and shared in changes to both other branches.\n\nThe 12th-century Icelandic ''[[Gray Goose Laws]]'' state that Swedes, Norwegians, Icelanders, and Danes spoke the same language, ''d\u01ebnsk tunga'' (\"Danish tongue\"; speakers of Old East Norse would have said ''dansk tunga''). Another term, used especially commonly with reference to West Norse, was ''norr\u0153nt m\u00e1l'' or ''norr\u01ffnt m\u00e1l'' (\"Nordic/Northern speech\"). Today Old Norse has developed into the modern North Germanic languages [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] (both inherited cases from the language), [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], of which Norwegian, Danish and Swedish retain considerable [[mutual intelligibility]].\n\n== Geographical distribution ==\n{{Old Norse language map}}\n[[Old Norse#Old Icelandic|Old Icelandic]] was very close to [[Old Norwegian]], and together they formed the Old West Norse dialect, which was also spoken in settlements in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], the [[Isle of Man]] and northwest England, and in Norse settlements in [[Normandy]].<ref name=\"JohnsonEcyc\">{{harvnb|Adams|1899|loc= \"Scandinavian Languages\", pp. 336\u2013338}}</ref> The Old East Norse dialect was spoken in Denmark, Sweden, settlements in [[Kievan Rus']],<ref name=\"Nationalencyklopedin\">{{citation| title = Nordiska spr\u00e5k| at = \u00a7 ''Historia'', \u00a7\u00a7 ''Omkring 800\u20131100''| work = [[Nationalencyklopedin]]| language = Swedish | year = 1994}}</ref> eastern England, and Danish settlements in [[Normandy]]. The [[Old Gutnish]] dialect was spoken in [[Gotland]] and in various settlements in the East. In the 11th century, Old Norse was the most widely spoken European language, ranging from [[Vinland]] in the West to the [[Volga River]] in the East. In [[Kievan Rus']], it survived the longest in [[Veliky Novgorod]], probably lasting into the [[13th century]] there.<ref name=\"Nationalencyklopedin\" /> The age of the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland]] is strongly contested, but at latest by the time of the [[Second Swedish Crusade]] in the 13th century, Swedish settlement had spread the language into the region.\n\n== Modern descendants ==\n{{Main|North Germanic languages}}\nThe modern descendants of the Old West Norse dialect are the West Scandinavian languages of [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and the extinct [[Norn language]] of [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]]; the descendants of the Old East Norse dialect are the East Scandinavian languages of [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Norwegian is descended from Old West Norse, but over the centuries it has been heavily influenced by East Norse, particularly during the [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] union.\n\nAmong these, the grammar of Icelandic and the Faroese have changed the least from Old Norse in the last thousand years. In contrast, the pronunciation of both Icelandic and Faroese have changed considerably from Old Norse. With Danish rule of the Faroe Islands, Faroese has also been influenced by Danish. Old Norse also had an influence on [[English language|English]] dialects and [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]], which contain many Old Norse [[loanword]]s. It also influenced the development of the [[Norman language]], and through it and to a smaller extent, that of modern [[French language|French]].\n\nOf the modern languages, Icelandic is the closest to Old Norse seen to grammar and vocabulary. Written modern Icelandic derives from the Old Norse [[phoneme|phonemic]] writing system. Contemporary Icelandic-speakers can read Old Norse, which varies slightly in spelling as well as semantics and word order. However, pronunciation, particularly of the vowel phonemes, has changed at least as much in Icelandic as in the other North Germanic languages.\n\nFaroese retains many similarities but is influenced by Danish, Norwegian, and [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] ([[Scottish Gaelic|Scottish]] and/or [[Irish language|Irish]]).{{sfn|van der Auwera|K\u00f6nig|1994|loc = \"Faroese\" (Barnes & Weyhe), p. 217}} Although Swedish, Danish and the Norwegian languages have diverged the most, they still retain [[mutual intelligibility]].{{sfn|Moberg|Gooskens|Nerbonne|Vaillette|2007}} Speakers of modern Swedish, Norwegian and Danish can mostly understand each other without studying their neighboring languages, particularly if speaking slowly. The languages are also sufficiently similar in writing that they can mostly be understood across borders. This could be because these languages have been mutually affected by each other, as well as having a similar development influenced by [[Middle Low German]].<ref>''See, e.g.'', {{harvnb|Harbert|2007|pp=7\u201310}}</ref>\n\n===Other influenced languages===\nVarious other languages, which are not closely related, have been heavily influenced by Norse, particularly the [[Norman language]]. [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] also have a number of Norse loanwords; the words ''Rus'' and ''Russia'', according to one theory, may be named after the [[Rus' people]], a Norse tribe; ''see [[Rus (name)]]'', probably from present-day east-central Sweden. The current Finnish and Estonian words for Sweden are ''Ruotsi'' and ''Rootsi'', respectively.\n\nA number of loanwords have been introduced into the  [[Irish language]] \u2013 many but not all are associated with fishing and sailing.<ref>{{citation| title = Old Norse loanwords in modern Irish | first = Robert| last = Farren | type = thesis | year = 2014 | publisher = Lund University | url  =http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=4861711&fileOId=4861798 }}</ref><ref>{{citation| title = Norse loanwords in Old and Middle Irish | type=  thesis | first = Aukje | last = Borkent |  publisher = Utrecht University | year = 2014  | hdl= 1874/296646 }}</ref><ref>{{citation| url =http://irisharchaeology.ie/2013/11/some-irish-words-with-norse-origins/| title = Some Irish words with Norse Origins | date = 21 Nov 2013 | work = irisharchaeology.ie }}</ref><ref>{{citation| url = | title = The influence of Scandinavian on Irish | editor-first =Bo | editor-last= Almqvist | editorlink= Bo Almqvist | editor-first2= David | editor-last2= Greene | work = Proceedings of the Seventh Viking Congress | publisher = Dundalgan Press, Dundalk | pages =75\u201382 | last = Greene | first = D. | year = 1973 }}</ref> A similar influence is found in [[Scottish Gaelic]], with over one hundred loanwords estimated to be in the language, many of which, but not all, are related to fishing and sailing.<ref>{{citation| title = Lexical imposition: Old Norse vocabulary in Scottish Gaelic | first = Thomas W.

The [[Old Norse orthography#Normalized spelling|standardized orthography]] marks the long vowels with an acute accent. In medieval manuscripts, it is often unmarked but sometimes marked with an accent or through [[gemination]].\n\nOld Norse had nasalized versions of all ten vowel places.<ref name=\"CleasbyA\" group=\"cv\">{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigf\u00fasson|1874|loc= p.1, \"A\"}}</ref> These occurred as allophones of the vowels before nasal consonants and in places where a nasal had followed it in an older form of the word, before it was absorbed into a neighboring sound. If the nasal was absorbed by a stressed vowel, it would also lengthen the vowel. These nasalizations also occurred in the other Germanic languages, but were not retained long. They were noted in the [[First Grammatical Treatise]], and otherwise might have remained unknown. The First Grammarian marked these with a dot above the letter.<ref name=\"CleasbyA\" group=\"cv\" /> This notation did not catch on, and would soon be obsolete. Nasal and oral vowels probably merged around the 11th century in most of Old East Norse.{{sfn|Bandle|2005|loc = Ch.

It is unclear whether they were sequences of two consonants (with the first element realised as {{IPA|/h/}} or perhaps {{IPA|/x/}}) or as single voiceless sonorants {{IPA|/l\u0325/}}, {{IPA|/r\u0325/}} and {{IPA|/n\u0325/}} respectively. In Old Norwegian, Old Danish and later Old Swedish, the groups ''hl'', ''hr'', ''hn'' were reduced to plain ''l'', ''r'', ''n'', which suggests that they had most likely already been pronounced as voiceless sonorants by Old Norse times.\n\nThe pronunciation of ''hv'' is unclear, but it may have been {{IPA|/x\u02b7/}} (the Proto-Germanic pronunciation), {{IPA|/h\u02b7/}} or the similar phoneme {{IPA|/\u028d/}}. Unlike the three other digraphs, it was retained much longer in all dialects. Without ever developing into a voiceless sonorant in Icelandic, it instead underwent [[fortition]] to a plosive {{IPA|/kv/}}, which suggests that instead of being a voiceless sonorant, it retained a stronger frication.\n\n=== Orthography ===\n{{Main|Old Norse orthography}}\nUnlike Proto-Norse, which was written with the [[Elder Futhark]], runic Old Norse was originally written with the [[Younger Futhark]], which had only 16 letters. Because of the limited number of runes, several runes were used for different sounds, and long and short vowels were not distinguished in writing. [[Medieval runes]] came into use some time later.\n\nAs for the [[Latin alphabet]], there was no standardized orthography in use in the Middle Ages. A modified version of the letter [[wynn]] called [[vend (letter)|vend]] was used briefly for the sounds {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/v/}}, and {{IPA|/w/}}. Long vowels were sometimes marked with acutes but also sometimes left unmarked or geminated. The [[Old Norse orthography#Normalized spelling|standardized Old Norse spelling]] was created in the 19th century and is, for the most part, phonemic. The most notable deviation is that the nonphonemic difference between the [[voiced dental fricative|voiced]] and the [[voiceless dental fricative]] is marked. The oldest texts and [[runic inscriptions]] use [[thorn (letter)|''\u00fe'']] exclusively. Long vowels are denoted with [[acute accent|acutes]]. Most other letters are written with the same glyph as the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] phoneme, except as shown in the table below.\n\n=== Accent ===\n{{See also|St\u00f8d|Norwegian phonology#Accent|Swedish phonology#Stress and pitch|l1=Danish st\u00f8d|l2=Norwegian tonal stress|l3=Swedish tonal stress}}\n{{Expand section|Dating, etc.|date=April 2010}}\n\nPrimary [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] in Old Norse falls on the [[word stem]], so that ''hyrjar'' would be pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8hyr.jar/}}. In compound words, secondary stress falls on the second stem (e.g. ''[[wikt:l\u00e6risveinn#Old Norse|l\u00e6risveinn]]'', {{IPA|/\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0\u027e.i\u02ccsw\u025bin\u02d0/}}).<ref name=\"ProseReader\">{{harvnb|Vigf\u00fasson|Powell|1879|loc=  Ch. 1}}</ref>\n\n== Phonological processes ==\n=== Ablaut ===\n[[Indo-European ablaut|Ablaut]] patterns are groups of vowels which are swapped, or ''ablauted,'' in the [[Syllable nucleus|nucleus]] of a word. [[Old Norse morphology#Strong verbs|Strong verbs]] ablaut the [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]]'s nucleus to derive the past forms of the verb. This parallels English conjugation, where, e.g., the nucleus of ''sing'' becomes ''sang'' in the past tense and ''sung'' in the past participle. Some verbs are derived by ablaut, as the [[Old Norse morphology#Present-preterite verbs|present-in-past verbs]] do by consequence of being derived from the past tense forms of strong verbs.\n\n=== Umlaut ===\n{{See also|Germanic umlaut|Old Norse morphology#Before Old Norse|l2=Old Norse morphophonology}}\n\nUmlaut or mutation is an [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilatory]] process acting on vowels preceding a vowel or semivowel of a different [[vowel backness]]. In the case of ''i-umlaut'' and ''\u0280-umlaut'', this entails a fronting of back vowels, with retention of lip rounding. In the case of ''u-umlaut'', this entails [[labialization]] of unrounded vowels. Umlaut is phonemic and in many situations grammatically significant as a side effect of losing the [[Proto-Germanic language#Morphology|Proto-Germanic morphological suffixes]] whose vowels created the umlaut [[allophones]].\n\nSome {{IPA|/y/}}, {{IPA|/y\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/\u00f8/}}, {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/\u00f8y/}},<ref name=\"FromOldNordic\" /> and all {{IPA|/\u025bi/}} were obtained by [[i-mutation|i-umlaut]] from {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/au/}}, and {{IPA|/ai/}} respectively.

Most of the fused [[morpheme]]s are retained in modern Icelandic, especially in regard to noun case declensions, whereas modern Norwegian in comparison has moved towards more analytical word structures.\n\n=== Gender ===\n{{Further|Grammatical gender}}\nOld Norse had three [[grammatical gender]]s \u2013 masculine, feminine and neuter. Adjectives or pronouns referring to a noun must [[Agreement (linguistics)|mirror the gender of that noun]], so that one says, \"heill ma\u00f0r!\" but, \"heilt barn!\" As in other languages, the grammatical gender of an impersonal noun is generally unrelated to an expected natural gender of that noun. While indeed ''karl'', \"man\" is masculine, ''kona'', \"woman\", is feminine, and ''h\u00fas'', house, is neuter, so also are ''hrafn'' and ''kr\u00e1ka'', for \"raven\" and \"crow\", masculine and feminine respectively, even in reference to a female raven or a male crow.\n\nAll neuter words have identical nominative and accusative forms,{{sfn|Old Norse for Beginners|loc = [http://www3.hi.is/~haukurth/norse/grammar/neutern.php Neuter nouns]}} and all feminine words have identical nominative and accusative plurals.{{sfn|Old Norse for Beginners|loc =  [http://www3.hi.is/~haukurth/norse/grammar/femininen.php Feminine nouns]}}\n\nThe gender of some words' plurals does not agree with that of their singulars, such as ''lim'' and ''mund''.<ref group=\"cv\">{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigf\u00fasson |1874|loc= p.&nbsp;389 col.1, \"LIM\"; p.&nbsp;437, col.1 \"MUND\"}}</ref> Some words, such as ''hungr'', have multiple genders, evidenced by their [[Determiner (linguistics)|determiners]] being declined in different genders within a given sentence.{{sfn|''The Menota handbook''|loc=Ch. 8 \u00a73.2.1 \"Gender\"}}{{sfn|Zo\u00ebga|1910|loc = H: ''hungr''}}\n\n=== Morphology ===\n{{Main|Old Norse morphology}}\nNouns, adjectives and pronouns were [[declension|declined]] in four grammatical cases{{snd}}[[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive case|genitive]] and [[dative case|dative]]{{snd}}in singular and plural numbers. Adjectives and pronouns were additionally declined in three grammatical genders. Some pronouns (first and second person) could have [[dual (grammatical number)|dual number]] in addition to singular and plural. The genitive was used [[partitive case|partitively]] and in compounds and [[kenning]]s (e.g., ''[[Ur\u00f0arbrunnr]]'', the well of Ur\u00f0r; ''[[Lokasenna]]'', the [[gibing]] of Loki).\n\nThere were several classes of nouns within each gender. The following is an example of the \"strong\" [[inflectional paradigm]]s:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | The strong masculine noun '''armr''' (English '''arm''')\n|-\n! Case !! '''Singular''' !! '''Plural'''\n|-\n| '''Nominative''' || armr || armar\n|-\n| '''Accusative''' || arm || rowspan=\"2\" | arma\n|-\n| '''Genitive''' || arms\n|-\n| '''Dative''' || armi ||  \u01ebrmum/armum\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | The feminine noun '''h\u01ebll''' (OWN), '''hall''' (OEN) (English '''hall''')\n|-\n!

This definite article, however, was a separate word and did not become attached to the noun before later stages of the Old Norse period.\n\n== Texts ==\n{{Commons category|Old Norse manuscripts}}\nThe earliest inscriptions in Old Norse are [[runic alphabet|runic]], from the 8th century. Runes continued to be commonly used until the 15th century and have been recorded to be in use in some form as late as the 19th century in some parts of Sweden. With the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|conversion to Christianity]] in the 11th century came the [[Latin alphabet]]. The oldest preserved texts in Old Norse in the Latin alphabet date from the middle of the 12th century. Subsequently, Old Norse became the vehicle of a large and varied body of vernacular literature, unique in medieval Europe. Most of the surviving literature was written in Iceland. Best known are the [[Norse saga]]s, the [[Icelanders' sagas]] and the mythological literature, but there also survives a large body of religious literature, translations into Old Norse of [[courtly romance]]s, classical mythology, and the Old Testament, as well as instructional material, [[First Grammatical Treatise|grammatical treatises]] and a large body of letters and official documents.{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2004|p=22\u2013102}}\n\n== Dialects ==\nMost of the innovations that appeared in Old Norse spread evenly through the Old Norse area. As a result, the dialects were very similar and considered to be the same language, a language that they sometimes called the Danish tongue (''D\u01ebnsk tunga''), sometimes Norse language (''Norr\u0153nt m\u00e1l''), as evidenced in the following two quotes from [[Heimskringla]] by [[Snorri Sturluson]]:\n\n{{Verse translation|M\u00f3\u00f0ir Dyggva var Dr\u00f3tt, d\u00f3ttir Danps konungs, sonar R\u00edgs er fyrstr var konungr kalla\u00f0r \u00e1 danska tungu.\n|attr1=[[Heimskringla]], Ynglinga saga \u00a7 20. ''Dau\u00f0i Dyggva''\n|Dyggvi's mother was Drott, the daughter of king Danp, R\u00edg's son, who was the first to be called king in the Danish tongue.\n}}\n\n{{Verse translation|...stirt var honum norr\u0153nt m\u00e1l, ok kylfdi m\u1d0a\u01ebk til or\u00f0anna, ok h\u01ebf\u00f0u margir menn \u00feat m\u1d0a\u01ebk at spotti.\n|attr1=[[Heimskringla]], Saga Sigur\u00f0ar J\u00f3rsalafara, Eysteins ok \u00d3lafs \u00a7 35(34). ''Fr\u00e1 ve\u00f0jan Haralds ok Magn\u00fas''\n|...the Norse language was hard for him, and he often fumbled for words, which amused people greatly.\n}}\n\nHowever, some changes were geographically limited and so created a dialectal difference between Old West Norse and Old East Norse.\n\nAs Proto-Norse evolved into Old Norse, in the 8th century, the effects of the [[Germanic umlaut|umlauts]] seem to have been very much the same over the whole Old Norse area. But in later dialects of the language a split occurred mainly between west and east as the use of umlauts began to vary. The typical umlauts (for example ''fylla'' from *''fullijan'') were better preserved in the West due to later generalizations in the east where many instances of umlaut were removed (many archaic Eastern texts as well as eastern runic inscriptions however portray the same extent of umlauts as in later Western Old Norse).\n\nAll the while, the changes resulting in [[breaking (linguistics)|breaking]] (for example ''hiarta'' from *''hert\u014d'') were more influential in the East probably once again due to generalizations within the inflectional system. This difference was one of the greatest reasons behind the dialectalization that took place in the 9th and 10th centuries, shaping an Old West Norse dialect in Norway and the Atlantic settlements and an Old East Norse dialect in Denmark and Sweden.\n\nOld West Norse and Old Gutnish did not take part in the monophthongization which changed ''\u00e6i'' (''ei'') into ''\u0113'', ''\u00f8y'' (''ey'') and ''au'' into ''\u00f8\u0304'', nor did certain peripheral dialects of Swedish, as seen in modern [[Swedish dialects in Ostrobothnia|Ostrobothnian dialects]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://aveneca.com/westeast.html|title=The Old Norse dialect areas| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707195311/http://aveneca.com/westeast.html| archivedate = 7 Jul 2011| year =2009 | work = aveneca.com}}</ref> Another difference was that Old West Norse lost certain combinations of consonants. The combinations -''mp''-, -''nt''-, and -''nk''- were assimilated into -''pp''-, -''tt''- and -''kk''- in Old West Norse, but this phenomenon was limited in Old East Norse.\n\nHere is a comparison between the two dialects as well as Old Gutnish. It is a transcription from one of the [[Funbo Runestones]] (U 990) from the eleventh century (translation: 'Ve\u00f0r and Thane and Gunnar raised this stone after Haursi, their father. God help his spirit'):\n{{block indent|Ve\u00f0r ok \u00deegn ok Gunnarr reistu stein \u00feenna at Haursa, f\u01eb\u00f0ur sinn. Gu\u00f0 hjalpi \u01ebnd hans.

Modern studies{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} have shown that the positions where it applies are the same as for runic Old West Norse. An alternative and probably more accurate transliteration would therefore render the text in OEN as such:\n{{block indent|Ve\u00f0r ok \u00deegn ok Gunnarr r\u00e6istu st\u00e6in \u00feenna at Haursa, f\u01eb\u00f0ur sinn. Gu\u00f0 hialpi \u01ebnd hans (OEN)}}\n\nSome [[past participle]]s and other words underwent i-umlaut in Old West Norse but not in Old East Norse dialects. Examples of that are Icelandic slegi\u00f0/sleginn and teki\u00f0/tekinn, which in Swedish are [[:wikt:slagit|slagit]]/[[:wikt:slagen|slagen]] and [[:wikt:tagit|tagit]]/[[:wikt:tagen|tagen]].

Old West Norse was also characterized by the preservation of ''u''-umlaut, which meant that, for example, [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]] *''tan\u00feu'', \"tooth\", was pronounced ''t\u01ebnn'' and not ''tann'' as in post-runic Old East Norse; OWN ''g\u01eb\u0301s'' and runic OEN ''g\u01eb\u0301s'', while post-runic OEN ''g\u00e1s'' \"goose\".\n\nThe earliest body of text appears in [[runic inscriptions]] and in poems composed c. 900 by [[\u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr of Hvinir]] (although the poems are not preserved in contemporary sources, but only in much later manuscripts). The earliest manuscripts are from the period 1150\u20131200 and concern both legal, religious and historical matters. During the 12th and 13th centuries, [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] and [[Western Norway]] were the most important areas of the Norwegian kingdom and they shaped Old West Norse as an archaic language with a rich set of declensions. In the body of text that has survived into the modern day from until c. 1300, Old West Norse had little dialect variation, and [[Old Icelandic]] does not diverge much more than the [[Old Norwegian]] dialects do from each other.\n\nOld Norwegian differentiated early from Old Icelandic by the loss of the consonant ''h'' in initial position before ''l'', ''n'' and ''r''; thus whereas Old Icelandic manuscripts might use the form ''hnefi'', \"fist\", Old Norwegian manuscripts might use ''nefi''.\n\nFrom the late 13th century, Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian started to diverge more. After c. 1350, the [[Black Death]] and following social upheavals seem to have accelerated language changes in Norway. From the late 14th century, the language used in Norway is generally referred to as [[Old Norwegian#Middle Norwegian|Middle Norwegian]].\n\nOld West Norse underwent a lengthening of initial vowels at some point, especially in Norwegian, so that OWN ''eta'' became ''\u00e9ta,'' ONW ''akr'' > ''\u00e1kr'', OIC ''ek'' > ''\u00e9k''.<ref>{{citation |title=Further Old Norse Secondary Formations |first=Albert Morey |last=Sturtevant |journal=Language |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=457\u2013462 |year=1953  |jstor=409955 |doi=10.2307/409955 }}</ref>\n\n==== Old Icelandic ====\nIn Iceland, initial {{IPA|/w/}} before {{IPA|/\u027e/}} was lost:<ref group=\"cv\">{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigf\u00fasson |1874|loc = p.&nbsp;481 \"R\"}}</ref> compare Icelandic ''[[wikt:rangur#Icelandic|rangur]]'' with Norwegian ''vrangr'', OEN ''vrang\u0280''.

It is inscribed on both sides.]]\nOld East Norse, between 800 and 1100, is called ''Runic Swedish'' in Sweden and ''Runic Danish'' in Denmark, but for geographical rather than linguistic reasons. Any differences between the two were minute at best during the more ancient stages of this dialect group. Changes had a tendency to occur earlier in the Danish region. Even today many Old Danish changes have still not taken place in modern Swedish. Swedish is therefore the more [[Linguistic conservatism|conservative]] of the two in both the ancient and the modern languages, sometimes by a profound margin but in general, differences are still minute. The language is called \"runic\" because the body of text appears in [[runes]].\n\nRunic Old East Norse is characteristically conservative in form, especially Swedish (which is still true for modern Swedish compared to Danish). In essence it matches or surpasses the conservatism of post-runic Old West Norse, which in turn is generally more conservative than post-runic Old East Norse. While typically \"Eastern\" in structure, many later post-runic changes and trademarks of OEN had yet to happen.\n\nThe phoneme ''\u0280'', which evolved during the Proto-Norse period from ''z'', was still clearly separated from ''r'' in most positions, even when being geminated, while in OWN it had already merged with ''r''.\n\nMonophthongization of ''\u00e6i > \u0113'' and ''\u00f8y, au > \u00f8\u0304'' started in mid-10th-century Denmark.<ref name=\"FromOldNordic\" /> Compare runic OEN: ''f\u00e6ig\u0280'', ''g\u00e6i\u0280\u0280'', ''haug\u0280'', ''m\u00f8yd\u014dm\u0280'', ''di\u016b\u0280''; with Post-runic OEN: ''f\u0113gher'', ''g\u0113r'', ''h\u00f8\u0304gher'', ''m\u00f8\u0304d\u014dmber'', ''di\u016br''; OWN: ''[[wikt:feigr|feigr]]'', ''[[wikt:geirr|geirr]]'', ''[[wikt:howe|haugr]]'', ''meyd\u00f3mr'', ''d\u00fdr''; from PN *faigiaz, *gaizaz, *haugaz, *mawi- + d\u014dmaz 'maidendom; virginity', *diuza '(wild) animal'.\n\nFeminine o-stems often preserve the plural ending -a\u0280, while in OWN they more often merge with the feminine i-stems: (runic OEN) ''*s\u014dla\u0280'', ''*hafna\u0280''/''*hamna\u0280'', ''*v\u0101ga\u0280'' versus OWN ''s\u00f3lir'', ''hafnir'' and ''v\u00e1gir'' (modern Swedish ''solar'', ''hamnar'', ''v\u00e5gar'' (\"suns, havens, scales\"); Danish has mainly lost the distinction between the two stems, with both endings now being rendered as ''-er'' or ''-e'' alternatively for the o-stems).\n\nVice versa, masculine i-stems with the root ending in either ''g'' or ''k'' tended to shift the plural ending to that of the ja-stems while OEN kept the original: ''dr\u00e6ngia\u0280'', ''*\u00e6lgia\u0280'' and ''*b\u00e6nkia\u0280'' versus OWN ''[[wikt:drengr#Old Norse|drengir]]'', ''elgir'' (\"elks\") and ''[[wikt:bekkr#Etymology 1|bekkir]]'' (modern Danish ''[[wikt:dreng|drenge]]'', ''[[wikt:elg|elge]]'', ''[[wikt:b\u00e6nk|b\u00e6nke]]'', modern Swedish ''[[wikt:dr\u00e4ng|dr\u00e4ngar]]'', ''\u00e4lgar'', ''b\u00e4nkar'').\n\nThe plural ending of ja-stems were mostly preserved while those of OEN often acquired that of the i-stems: ''*b\u00e6\u00f0ia\u0280'', ''*b\u00e6kkia\u0280'', ''*v\u00e6fia\u0280'' versus OWN ''be\u00f0ir'' (\"beds\"), ''[[wikt:bekkr#Etymology 2|bekkir]]'', ''[[wikt:vefr#Old Norse|vefir]]'' (modern Swedish ''b\u00e4ddar'', ''b\u00e4ckar'', ''v\u00e4var'').\n\n==== Old Danish ====\n{{Further|History of Danish}}\nUntil the early 12th century, Old East Norse was very much a uniform dialect. It was in Denmark that the first innovations appeared that would differentiate Old Danish from Old Swedish ({{harvnb|Bandle|2005|loc = ''Old East Nordic'', pp.&nbsp;1856, 1859}}) as these innovations spread north unevenly (unlike the earlier changes that spread more evenly over the East Norse area), creating a series of [[isogloss]]es going from [[Zealand]] to [[Svealand]].\n\nIn Old Danish, {{IPA|/h\u027e/}} merged with {{IPA|/\u027e/}} during the 9th century.<ref>{{citation| first = Tarrin | last =  Wills | title = The Anonymous Verse in the Third Grammatical Treatise| url  =https://sro.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/10765/54631 | year = 2006 | isbn = | publisher = The Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Durham University }}</ref> From the 11th to 14th centuries, the unstressed vowels -''a'', -''o'' and -''e'' ([[Old Norse orthography#Normalized spelling|standard normalization]] -''a'', -''u'' and -''i'') started to merge into -''\u0259'', represented with the letter ''e''. This vowel came to be [[epenthesis|epenthetic]], particularly before ''-\u0280'' endings.<ref name=\"TheNordicLanguages\" /> At the same time, the voiceless [[stop consonant]]s ''p'', ''t'' and ''k'' became voiced plosives and even [[fricative consonant]]s. Resulting from these innovations, Danish has ''kage'' (cake), ''tunger'' (tongues) and ''g\u00e6ster'' (guests) whereas (Standard) Swedish has retained older forms, ''kaka'', ''tungor'' and ''g\u00e4ster'' (OEN ''kaka'', ''tungur'', ''g\u00e6stir'').\n\nMoreover, the Danish [[pitch accent]] shared with Norwegian and Swedish changed into ''[[st\u00f8d]]'' around this time.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==== Old Swedish ====\n{{Further|Old Swedish}}\nAt the end of the 10th and early 11th century initial ''h-'' before ''l'', ''n'' and ''r'' was still preserved in the middle and northern parts of Sweden, and is sporadically still preserved in some northern dialects as ''g-'', e.g. ''gly'' (lukewarm), from ''hl\u00fd\u0280''.

For example, the diphthong ''ai'' in ''aigu'', ''\u00feair'' and ''waita'' was not retroactively{{clarify|date=June 2019}} umlauted to ''ei'' as in e.g. Old Icelandic ''eigu'', ''\u00feeir'' and ''veita''. Gutnish also shows dropping of {{IPA|/w/}} in initial {{IPA|/w\u027e/}}, which it shares with the Old West Norse dialects (except Old East Norwegian<ref>{{cite book |last=Noreen |first=Adolf |title=Altnordische Grammatik I: Altisl\u00e4ndische und altnorwegische Grammatik  |url=http://www.arnastofnun.is/solofile/1016380 |publisher= |page=211 (\u00a7 288, note 1)}}</ref>), but which is otherwise abnormal. Breaking was also particularly active in Old Gutnish, leading to e.g. ''biera'' versus mainland ''bera''.<ref name=\"TheNordicLanguages\" />\n\n==== Text example ====\nThe [[Gutasaga]] is the longest text surviving from [[Old Gutnish]]. It was written in the 13th century and dealt with the early history of the Gotlanders. This part relates to the agreement that the Gotlanders had with the Swedish king sometime before the 9th century:\n\n{{Verse translation|\nSo gingu gutar sielfs wiliandi vndir suia kunung \u00fey at \u00feair mattin frir Oc frelsir sykia suiariki j huerium sta\u00fe. vtan tull oc allar utgiftir.

Likewise, the Swedes had the right to go to Gotland without corn restrictions or other prohibitions. The king was to provide protection and help, when they needed it and asked for it.

This is because both [[English language|English]] and Old Norse stem from a [[Proto-Germanic]] mother language.

The game is a [[prequel]] to the 1984 game ''[[Tir Na Nog (game)|Tir Na Nog]]''. The plot of the game has [[Celt]]ic hero [[Cuchulainn]] on his search to find his companion [[L\u00f3eg]] in the mysterious city of Dun Darach. Inspiration for the game came from the works of [[Fritz Lieber]] and [[Michael Moorcock]].\n\nThe background history is based on [[Celt]]ic folklore about the hero [[Cuchulainn]], and his battles against the people of [[Connachta]] in ancient [[Ireland]]. ''Dun Darach'' received positive reviews from video game critics. It was re-released by on different game compilations and on  [[Covermount|cover tapes]] in issues of British video game magazines.\n\n==Plot and gameplay==\n[[File:Dun Darach gameplay.png|left|thumb|Gameplay of ''Dun Darach''.]]\nOne day [[Cuchulainn]] was travelling home from a battle with the Connachta with his companion [[L\u00f3eg]] the charioteer. On the way, they stopped off at an [[inn]] and L\u00f3eg was persuaded to help a beautiful young woman named Skar whose [[chariot]] was damaged. Cuchulainn took refreshment at the inn and on leaving realised L\u00f3eg was missing. He later discovered that Skar is a sorceress and ally of the Connachta and had taken L\u00f3eg to the timeless Secret City of Dun Darach in retribution for the death of Prince Amhair. Cuchulainn went on a long search for the mysterious city and eventually discovered it and entered Dun Darach to find L\u00f3eg.<ref name=Crash1/>\n\n''Dun Darach'' is an [[arcade adventure]] video game. The player guides Cuchulainn through Dun Darach and interact with the environment by selecting from performing commands by typing them from the [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]]. The main objective is to find L\u00f3eg, taking [[side quests]] from [[non-player character]]s (NPCs). These NPCs can give short hints to the player, rob him, and confiscate his belongings if he carries stolen goods. Commands the player input can have Cuchulainn buy, steal and sell goods from shops in the city, bet at a casino (Iomain Ludum), and deposit money at a bank with daily [[compound interest]].

The game is a [[prequel]] to the 1984 game ''[[Tir Na Nog (game)|Tir Na Nog]]''. The plot of the game has [[Celt]]ic hero [[Cuchulainn]] on his search to find his companion [[L\u00f3eg]] in the mysterious city of Dun Darach. Inspiration for the game came from the works of [[Fritz Lieber]] and [[Michael Moorcock]].\n\nThe background history is based on [[Celt]]ic folklore about the hero [[Cuchulainn]], and his battles against the people of [[Connachta]] in ancient [[Ireland]]. ''Dun Darach'' received positive reviews from video game critics. It was re-released by on different game compilations and on  [[Covermount|cover tapes]] in issues of British video game magazines.\n\n==Plot and gameplay==\n[[File:Dun Darach gameplay.png|left|thumb|Gameplay of ''Dun Darach''.]]\nOne day [[Cuchulainn]] was travelling home from a battle with the Connachta with his companion [[L\u00f3eg]] the charioteer. On the way, they stopped off at an [[inn]] and L\u00f3eg was persuaded to help a beautiful young woman named Skar whose [[chariot]] was damaged. Cuchulainn took refreshment at the inn and on leaving realised L\u00f3eg was missing. He later discovered that Skar is a sorceress and ally of the Connachta and had taken L\u00f3eg to the timeless Secret City of Dun Darach in retribution for the death of Prince Amhair. Cuchulainn went on a long search for the mysterious city and eventually discovered it and entered Dun Darach to find L\u00f3eg.<ref name=Crash1/>\n\n''Dun Darach'' is an [[arcade adventure]] video game. The player guides Cuchulainn through Dun Darach and interact with the environment by selecting from performing commands by typing them from the [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]]. The main objective is to find L\u00f3eg, taking [[side quests]] from [[non-player character]]s (NPCs). These NPCs can give short hints to the player, rob him, and confiscate his belongings if he carries stolen goods. Commands the player input can have Cuchulainn buy, steal and sell goods from shops in the city, bet at a casino (Iomain Ludum), and deposit money at a bank with daily [[compound interest]].

For his birth year, it is likely to be somewhere between 1731 to 1733 as a royal decree was issued in 1743 to select the husband for Princess Hwahyeop. The decree asked for yangban families to submit the names of primary born sons of the same age or up to two years older than the Princess (\u300a\u627f\u653f\u9662\u65e5\u8bb0\u300b\u82f1\u795619\u5e742\u670822\u65e5\uff1a\u53c8\u4ee5\u79ae\u66f9\u8a00\u5553\u66f0, \u548c\u5354\u7fc1\u4e3b\u99d9\u99ac, \u81ea\u5341\u4e00\u6b72\u81f3\u5341\u4e09\u6b72\u63c0\u64c7\u4e8b, \u547d\u4e0b\u77e3\u3002). As for his death year, in 1775, King Yeongjo dismissed his uncle, Sin Ui (\u7533\u6666\uff0c1706-??), from the position of Chief State Counselor. The historian commented that Sin Ui was Sin Gwang-su's uncle without using the word \u201c\u6545\u201d, which would be referring to a deceased person (\u82f1\u7956125\u5377, 51\u5e747\u67081\u65e5\uff1a\u547d\u7f77\u9818\u8b70\u653f\u7533\u6666\u3002\u3010\u53f2\u81e3\u66f0: \u6666\u4ee5\u6545\u76f8\u6669\u5f1f, \u90fd\u5c09\u5149\u7d8f\u4e4b\u53d4, \u5924\u7de3\u621a\u7579, \u9a5f\u965e\u5927\u5b98, \u5c08\u4e8b\u963f\u8adb, \u5bb3\u516c\u5229\u5df1, \u8cc4\u8cc2\u516c\u884c, \u4eba\u83ab\u4e0d\u553e\u9119\u3002 \u53ca\u662f\u7f77\u76f8, \u8f3f\u8ad6\u5feb\u4e4b\u3002\u3011).

Your younger brother, the Crown Prince, had ladies-in-waiting sent offerings to Princess Hwahyeop. My elder sister was virtuous and chaste. She was born into the royal family and had grew up (with me) in the palace. She lived to see twenty springs till one frosty snow took her to join the immortals. Who would have expected this? Now I have rarely seen the wild geese flying across the sky.<ref>Translator's note: Geese is a popular motif in Chinese poems bearing various symbolic meanings. In the case of Prince Sado, he was lamenting the fact that his sisters (Princess Hwapyeong in 1743 and Princess Hwahyeop in 1752) were departing one after another to the netherworld. Thus the wild geese were rare (he had only three sisters born of the same mother) and getting fewer. He also used wild geese to allude to his sisters in his eulogy dedicated to Princess Hwapyeong. </ref> I could not believe that what had started as a minor illness would end up incurable. Mother and I had been anxious (over your deteriorating health) day and night. You were sincere and filial till the end of your journey. Upon hearing that His Majesty was about to visit you, you rose from your sick bed. But your words drifted like flowing water and faded away with time. My grief is merely expressed through these humble offerings.

For his birth year, it is likely to be somewhere between 1731 to 1733 as a royal decree was issued in 1743 to select the husband for Princess Hwahyeop. The decree asked for yangban families to submit the names of primary born sons of the same age or up to two years older than the Princess (\u300a\u627f\u653f\u9662\u65e5\u8bb0\u300b\u82f1\u795619\u5e742\u670822\u65e5\uff1a\u53c8\u4ee5\u79ae\u66f9\u8a00\u5553\u66f0, \u548c\u5354\u7fc1\u4e3b\u99d9\u99ac, \u81ea\u5341\u4e00\u6b72\u81f3\u5341\u4e09\u6b72\u63c0\u64c7\u4e8b, \u547d\u4e0b\u77e3\u3002). As for his death year, in 1775, King Yeongjo dismissed his uncle, Sin Ui (\u7533\u6666\uff0c1706-??), from the position of Chief State Counselor. The historian commented that Sin Ui was Sin Gwang-su's uncle without using the word \u201c\u6545\u201d, which would be referring to a deceased person (\u82f1\u7956125\u5377, 51\u5e747\u67081\u65e5\uff1a\u547d\u7f77\u9818\u8b70\u653f\u7533\u6666\u3002\u3010\u53f2\u81e3\u66f0: \u6666\u4ee5\u6545\u76f8\u6669\u5f1f, \u90fd\u5c09\u5149\u7d8f\u4e4b\u53d4, \u5924\u7de3\u621a\u7579, \u9a5f\u965e\u5927\u5b98, \u5c08\u4e8b\u963f\u8adb, \u5bb3\u516c\u5229\u5df1, \u8cc4\u8cc2\u516c\u884c, \u4eba\u83ab\u4e0d\u553e\u9119\u3002 \u53ca\u662f\u7f77\u76f8, \u8f3f\u8ad6\u5feb\u4e4b\u3002\u3011).

It has been remarked that it is rare for a Joseon king to inscribe a stone for a daughter, and has been taken as a sign of King Yeongjo's affection for this particular daughter.<ref>http://english.donga.com/Home/3/all/26/835447/1</ref>\n\n==Eulogies==\n{{chart top|width=100%|Tomb Epitaph written by King Yeongjo}} [[File:Tomb Epitah (1).jpg|thumb|Memorial stone Front]][[File:Tomb Epitah (2).jpg|thumb|Memorial stone Side and Back]]\n\nThe Royal Epitaph of Princess Hwahyeop, buried in PyongChang Village, Geumgok (Yangju)<ref>Original Text\uff1a\u5fa1\u5236\u548c\u534f\u7fc1\u4e3b\u5893\u5fd7\uff0c\u5893\u5728\u91d1\u8c37\u5e73\u4e18\u6751 - \u7b2c\u4e03\u5973\u548c\u534f\u5373\u668e\u5ad4\u6240\u751f\u4e5f\u3002\u7678\u4e11\u4e09\u6708\u521d\u4e03\u65e5\u751f\u4e8e\u5927\u5185\uff0c\u5df3\u672a\u5c01\u7235\uff0c\u5341\u4e00\u5c81\u4e0b\u5ac1\u6c38\u57ce\u5c09\u7533\u5149\u7ee5\uff0c\u5373\u5224\u4e66\u665a\u4e4b\u5b50\u4e5f\u3002\u4e01\u536f\u79cb\u4e03\u6708\u51fa\u9601\uff0c\u58ec\u7533\u5341\u4e00\u6708\u4e8c\u5341\u4e03\u65e5\u901d\u4e8e\u5927\u5bfa\u6d1e\u7b2c\u3002\u6c14\u54c1\u4ece\u5bb9\u6e05\u79c0\uff0c\u4e8b\u4eb2\u4ee5\u8bda\uff0c\u4e8b\u8205\u82e5\u4e00\u3002\u867d\u5904\u65bc\u9619\u4e2d\u6ce2\u8361\u4e4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u81ea\u5e7c\u81f3\u957f\u6fb9\u7136\u9759\u7136\uff0c\u65e0\u5c11\u95f4\u7109\uff0c\u82e5\u5f17\u95fb\u7109\uff0c\u82e5\u5f17\u89a9\u7109\uff0c\u5373\u548c\u534f\u4e4b\u6027\u54c1\u4e5f\u3002\u5f17\u7136\u4f55\u4ee5\u5fa1\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f55\u4ee5\u9f50\u4f17\u566b\uff0c\u5e38\u65f6\u4e3a\u4e88\u4e4b\u8bda\u3002\u867d\u5f17\u80fd\u8bb0\uff0c\u53bb\u51ac\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u65e5\uff0c\u7279\u4e3a\u4e34\u89c6\u4e5f\u3002\u95fb\u4e88\u4e4b\u6765\uff0c\u547d\u5de6\u53f3\u800c\u5907\u994c\u5f85\u4e88\uff0c\u4ee4\u4f8d\u8005\u800c\u63a2\u95ee\u6765\u4e88\u3002\u545c\u547c\uff01\u5176\u65f6\uff0c\u595a\u80fd\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u800c\u56e0\u6052\u65e5\u4e3a\u4e88\u4e4b\u5fc3\u4e5f\uff0c\u5401\u55df\u5176\u65e5\u4e8b\u5df2\u672b\u3002\u82e5\u60df\u5f85\u89c6\uff0c\u7ec8\u6c14\u5ffd\u660f\u7729\u96be\u4ee5\u582a\u7109\uff0c\u55df\u53f9\u81ea\u8c13\u66f0\uff0c\u5176\u5c06\u6b3a\u6211\uff0c\u5176\u5c06\u6b3a\u6211\u3002\u5165\u89c6\u800c\u8c13\u66f0\uff0c\u4e88\u4eca\u5165\u9619\uff0c\u4e88\u4eca\u5165\u9619\uff0c\u82e5\u662f\u8005\u4e09\uff0c\u660f\u660f\u6d94\u6d94\u6f20\u7136\u65e0\u5e94\uff0c\u6545\u996e\u6d95\u800c\u56de\u3002\u7fcc\u65e5\u671d\u95f4\uff0c\u533b\u6240\u4f20\uff0c\u5176\u540e\u7701\u89c9\uff0c\u8c13\u5176\u4f8d\u8005\u66f0\uff0c\u4f55\u5f17\u89c9\u4f59\u594f\u4ee5\u5b89\u56de\u4e91\u3002\u95fb\u6b64\u5f17\u89c9\u6cea\u4e0b\u62ab\u9762\u3002\u95fb\u5176\u8ba1\u6765\u4e34\uff0c\u4e8b\u5df2\u83ab\u8ffd\u3002\u545c\u547c\uff01\u6b64\u6000\u4f55\u4ee5\u8bb0\u7109\uff1f\u7fcc\u5e74\u6b63\u6708\u4e8c\u5341\u4e8c\u65e5\u846c\u4e8e\u6768\u5dde\u91d1\u8c37\u9762\u5e9a\u5411\u539f\u3002\u800c\u8c13\u5176\u4e88\u679d\uff0c\u4f55\u5fcd\u8bb0\u7109\uff0c\u5c24\u4e3a\u6df1\u6006\u8005\u3002\u7533\u95e8\u53ea\u6709\u4e73\u7ae5\u5f17\u5373\u7acb\u540e\u4e5f\u3002\u5fc3\u601d\u7d22\u6f20\u8bb0\uff0c\u867d\u8349\u8349\u6bd4\u8bf8\u6587\u5177\uff0c\u5eb6\u53ef\u6170\u7075\u3002\u5176\u5f55\u4e00\u884c\u6cea\u4e0b\u5341\u884c\u3002\u545c\u547c\u54c0\u54c9\uff01\u545c\u547c\u54c0\u54c9\uff01</ref> \n\nMy seventh daughter was born of [[Consort Yeong|Yeongbin Yi Ssi ( Lady Seonhui)]] on the 7th day of the 3rd lunar month of 1733 in the royal palace.

Volume 1, Number 1.jpg|thumb|right|First issue of ''Amazing Stories'', art by [[Frank R. Paul]]. This copy was autographed by [[Hugo Gernsback]] in 1965]]\n'''''Amazing Stories''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[science fiction magazine]] launched in April 1926 by [[Hugo Gernsback]]'s [[Experimenter Publishing]]. It was the first magazine devoted solely to [[science fiction]]. Science fiction stories had made regular appearances in other magazines, including some published by Gernsback, but ''Amazing'' helped define and launch a new genre of [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]].\n\nAs of 2018, ''Amazing'' has been published, with some interruptions, for ninety-two years, going through a half-dozen owners and many editors as it struggled to be profitable. Gernsback was forced into bankruptcy and lost control of the magazine in 1929. In 1938 it was purchased by [[Ziff-Davis]], who hired [[Raymond A. Palmer]] as editor. Palmer made the magazine successful though it was not regarded as a quality magazine within the science fiction community. In the late 1940s ''Amazing'' presented as fact stories about the [[Shaver Mystery]], a lurid mythos that explained accidents and disaster as the work of robots named deros, which led to dramatically increased circulation but widespread ridicule. ''Amazing'' switched to a [[digest size]] format in 1953, shortly before the end of the pulp-magazine era. It was sold to Sol Cohen's Universal Publishing Company in 1965, which filled it with reprinted stories but did not pay a reprint fee to the authors, creating a conflict with the newly formed [[Science Fiction Writers of America]]. [[Ted White (author)|Ted White]] took over as editor in 1969, eliminated the reprints and made the magazine respected again: ''Amazing'' was nominated for the prestigious [[Hugo Award]] three times during his tenure in the 1970s. Several other owners attempted to create a modern incarnation of the magazine in the following decades, but publication was suspended after the March 2005 issue. A new incarnation appeared in July 2012 as an online magazine.  Print publication resumed with the Fall 2018 issue.\n\nGernsback's initial editorial approach was to blend instruction with entertainment; he believed science fiction could educate readers. His audience rapidly showed a preference for implausible adventures, and the movement away from Gernsback's idealism accelerated when the magazine changed hands in 1929. Despite this, Gernsback had an enormous impact on the field: the creation of a specialist magazine for science fiction spawned an entire genre publishing industry. The letter columns in ''Amazing'', where fans could make contact with each other, led to the formation of science fiction fandom, which in turn had a strong influence on the development of the field. Writers whose first story was published in the magazine include [[John W. Campbell]], [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Howard Fast]], [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], [[Roger Zelazny]], and [[Thomas M. Disch]]. Overall, though, ''Amazing'' itself was rarely an influential magazine within the genre after the 1920s. Some critics have commented that by \"ghettoizing\" science fiction, Gernsback harmed its literary growth, but this viewpoint has been countered by the argument that science fiction needed an independent market to develop in to reach its potential.\n\n==Origins==\n[[Image:Science and Invention Jan 1922 pg824.png|thumb|upright|left| A \"scientific fiction\" story illustrated by Frank R. Paul in a 1922 issue of ''Science and Invention'']]\nBy the end of the 19th century, stories centered on scientific inventions, and stories set in the future, were appearing regularly in popular fiction magazines. The market for short stories lent itself to tales of invention in the tradition of [[Jules Verne]].<ref name=\"TTM_7\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;7.</ref> Magazines such as ''[[Munsey's Magazine]]'' and ''[[Argosy (magazine)|The Argosy]]'', launched in 1889 and 1896 respectively, carried a few science fiction stories each year. Some upmarket \"slick\" magazines such as ''[[McClure's]]'', which paid well and were aimed at a more literary audience, also carried scientific stories, but by the early years of the 20th century, science fiction (though it was not yet called that) was appearing more often in the [[pulp magazine]]s than in the slicks.<ref name=\"TTM_21-25\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;21\u201325.</ref><ref name=\"ESF_Pulp\">Nicholls, Peter, \"Pulp Magazines\", in Clute & Nicholls, ''Encyclopedia of SF'', p.&nbsp;979.</ref><ref name=\"T_155\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', p.&nbsp;155.</ref>\n\nIn 1908, Hugo Gernsback published the first issue of ''[[Modern Electrics]]'', a magazine aimed at the scientific hobbyist. It was an immediate success, and Gernsback began to include articles on imaginative uses of science, such as \"Wireless on Saturn\" (December 1908).<ref name=\"TTM_28-29\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;28\u201329.</ref> In April 1911, Gernsback began the serialization of his science fiction novel, ''[[Ralph 124C 41+]]'', but in 1913 he sold his interest in the magazine to his partner and launched a new magazine, ''[[Electrical Experimenter]]'', which soon began to publish scientific fiction. In 1920 Gernsback retitled the magazine ''Science and Invention'', and through the early 1920s he published much scientific fiction in its pages, along with non-fiction scientific articles.<ref name=\"TTM_29-35\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;29\u201335.</ref>\n\nGernsback had started another magazine called ''Practical Electrics'' in 1921. In 1924, he changed its name to ''The Experimenter'',<ref name=\"TTM_48-49\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;48\u201349.</ref> and sent a letter to 25,000 people to gauge interest in the possibility of a magazine devoted to scientific fiction; in his words, \"the response was such that the idea was given up for two years.\"<ref name=\"TTM_47\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;47.</ref> However, in 1926 he decided to go ahead, and ceased publication of ''The Experimenter'' to make room in his publishing schedule for a new magazine. The editor of ''The Experimenter'', [[T. O'Conor Sloane]], became the editor of ''Amazing Stories''. The first issue appeared on 10 March 1926, with a cover date of April 1926.<ref name=\"TTM_48-49\" />{{clear}}\n\n==Publishing history==\n\n===1920s===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 11pt; margin-left: 2em; text-align: center; float: right\"\n! !!Jan !!

Shaver responded with a story called \"I Remember [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]]\", published in the March 1945 issue, which was presented by Palmer as a mixture of truth and fiction. The story, about prehistoric civilizations, dramatically boosted ''Amazing'''s circulation, and Palmer ran a new Shaver story in every issue, culminating in a special issue in June 1947 devoted entirely to the Shaver Mystery, as it was called.{{refn|Palmer claimed the highest circulation of any science fiction magazine, but del Rey comments that though this may have been true, \"Palmer's tendency to magnify everything about the magazine cannot be discounted.\"<ref name=\"LDR_117-8_note\">del Rey, ''World of Science Fiction'', pp.&nbsp;117\u2013118.</ref>|group=notes}}<ref name=\"TTM_178-180\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;178\u2013180.</ref> ''Amazing'' soon drew ridicule for these stories. A derisive article by [[William S. Baring-Gould]] in the September 1946 issue of ''[[Harper's]]'' prompted [[William Bernard Ziff, Sr.|William Ziff]] to tell Palmer to limit the amount of Shaver-related material in the magazine; Palmer complied, but his interest (and possibly belief) in this sort of material was now significant, and he soon began planning to leave Ziff-Davis. In 1947 he formed Clark Publications, launching ''[[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]'' the following year, and in 1949 he resigned from Ziff-Davis to edit that and other magazines.<ref name=\"TTM_183-185\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;183\u2013185.</ref>\n\n[[Howard Browne]], who had been on a leave of absence from Ziff-Davis to write fiction, took over as editor and began by throwing away 300,000 words of inventory that Palmer had acquired before he left.<ref name=\"TTM_183-185\" /> Browne had ambitions of moving ''Amazing'' upmarket, and his argument was strengthened by [[Street & Smith]], one of the longest established and most respected publishers, who shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, largely as a result of the success of [[paperback|pocketbooks]], and Street & Smith decided to concentrate on their slick magazines. Some pulps struggled on for a few more years, but Browne was able to persuade Ziff and Davis that the future was in the slicks, and they raised his fiction budget from one cent to a ceiling of five cents per word. Browne managed to get promises of new stories from many well-known authors, including [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Theodore Sturgeon]]. He produced a dummy issue<ref name=\"dummy\">A dummy issue is a magazine issue produced to show to potential advertisers or for advance review.

Although he stayed involved with ''[[Fantastic Adventures]]'', another Ziff-Davis magazine, he left the editing work on ''Amazing'' to [[William Hamling (publisher)|William Hamling]] and Lila Shaffer. In December 1950, when Ziff-Davis moved their offices from Chicago to New York, Hamling stayed behind in Chicago, and Browne revived his involvement with the magazine.<ref name=\"T_7\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', p.&nbsp;7.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, Browne convinced Ziff-Davis to try a high-quality digest fantasy magazine. ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]'', which appeared in the summer of that year, focused on [[fantasy]] rather than science fiction and was so successful that it persuaded Ziff-Davis to switch ''Amazing'' from pulp format to digest in early 1953 (while also switching to a bimonthly schedule). Circulation fell, however, and subsequent budget cuts limited the story quality in both ''Amazing'' and ''Fantastic''. ''Fantastic'' began to print science fiction as well as fantasy. Circulation increased as a result, but Browne, who was not a science fiction aficionado, once again lost interest in the magazines.<ref name=\"T_48-51\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;48\u201351.</ref>\n\n[[Paul W.

Readers' letters in ''Amazing'' had indicated a desire for novels, which ''Amazing'' did not have room to run. The novel series did not last; only one, [[Henry Slesar]]'s ''20 Million Miles to Earth'', appeared. However, in response to readers' interest in longer fiction, Ziff-Davis expanded ''Amazing'' by 16 pages, starting with the March 1958 issue, and the magazine began to run complete novels.<ref name=\"T_173-174\" />\n\nFairman left to edit ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]'' at the end of 1958, and his place was taken by [[Cele Goldsmith]]. Goldsmith had been hired in 1955 as a secretary and became assistant editor to help cope with the additional work created when Ziff-Davis launched two short-lived magazines, ''Dream World'' and ''Pen Pals'', in 1956. Ziff-Davis were not confident of Goldsmith's abilities as an editor, so when Fairman left, a consultant, Norman Lobsenz, was hired to work with her. She performed well, however, and Lobsenz's involvement soon became minimal.<ref name=\"T_222-226\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;222\u2013226.</ref>\n\n===1960s===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 11pt; margin-right: 2em; text-align: center; float: left\"\n! !!Jan !!

Cohen was also producing reprint magazines such as ''[[Great Science Fiction]]'' and ''[[Science Fiction Classics]]'', but no payment was made to authors for any of these reprints. This brought Cohen into conflict with the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] (SFWA), a professional writers' organization formed in 1965. Soon SFWA called for a boycott of Ultimate's magazines until Cohen agreed to make payments.

Cohen contacted [[Robert Silverberg]], then the president of SFWA, and told him (falsely) that Malzberg had actually resigned.

The apparently erroneous<br/>volume numbering for the November 1979 issue is in fact shown correctly.\n|}When White took over as editor, ''Amazing'''s circulation was about 38,500, only about 4% of which were subscribers (as opposed to newsstand sales). This was a very low ebb for subscriptions; ''Analog'', by comparison, sold about 35% of its circulation through subscriptions. Cohen's wife mailed out the subscription copies from home, and Cohen had never tried to increase the subscriber base as this would have increased the burden on his wife.<ref name=\"GTF_72\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', p.&nbsp;72.</ref> White worked hard to increase the circulation despite Cohen's lack of support, but met with limited success. One of his first changes was to reduce the [[typeface]] to increase the amount of fiction in the magazine. To pay for this he increased the price of both ''Fantastic'' and ''Amazing'' to 60 cents, but this had a strong negative effect on circulation, which fell about 10% from 1969 to 1970.<ref name=\"GTF_74\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', p.&nbsp;74.</ref><ref name=\"GTF_480\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', p.&nbsp;480.</ref>\n\nIn 1972, White changed the title to ''Amazing Science Fiction'', distancing the magazine slightly from some of the pulp connotations of \"Amazing Stories\".<ref name=\"GTF_74\" /> White worked at a low wage, and his friends often read manuscripts for free, but despite his efforts the circulation continued to fall. From near 40,000 when White joined the magazine, the circulation fell to about 23,000 in October 1975. White was unwilling to continue with the very limited financial backing that Cohen provided, and he resigned in 1975. Cohen was able to convince White to remain; White promised to stay for one more year, but in the event remained as editor until late 1978.<ref name=\"GTF_84-85\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', pp.&nbsp;84\u201385.</ref>\n\n''Amazing'' raised its price from 75 cents to $1.00 with the November 1975 issue. The schedule switched to quarterly beginning with the March 1976 issue; as a result, the 50th anniversary issue had a cover date of June 1976. In 1977, Cohen announced that ''Amazing'' and ''Fantastic'' had lost $15,000, though ''Amazing'''s circulation (at nearly 26,000) was as good as it had been for several years. Cohen looked for a new publisher to buy the magazines, but in September of the following year sold his half-share in the company to his partner, Arthur Bernhard.<ref name=\"GTF_480\" /><ref name=\"GTF_85-86\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', pp.&nbsp;85\u201386.</ref> White had occasionally suggested to Cohen that ''Amazing'' would benefit from a redesign and investment; he made the same suggestions to Bernhard in early October. According to White, Bernhard not only said no, but told him he would not receive a salary until the next issue was turned in. In late 1978 White resigned, and returned all manuscripts in his possession to their authors, even if copy-edited and ready for publication. White claimed Bernhard had told him to do this, though Bernhard denied it.<ref name=\"GTF_347-348\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', pp.&nbsp;347\u2013348.</ref>\n\n===1980s to 2000s===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 11pt; margin-right: 2em; text-align: center; float: left\"\n! !! !!colspan=\"3\"| Spring !!colspan=\"3\"| Summer !!colspan=\"3\"| Fall!!colspan=\"2\"| Winter\n|-\n! !!Jan !!

She had worked for Bernhard as an illustrator and in the production department of several of his magazines, though not for ''Amazing''. She had also been an editor at ''Bill of Fare'', a restaurant trade magazine. Mavor had read a good deal of science fiction but knew nothing about the world of science fiction magazines when she took over. She was not confident that a woman would be accepted as the editor of a science fiction magazine, so she initially used the pseudonym \"Omar Gohagen\" for both ''Amazing'' and ''Fantastic'', dropping it late in 1980. Circulation continued to fall, and Bernhard refused to consider Mavor's request to undertake a subscription drive, which might have helped. Instead, in late 1980, Bernhard decided to merge the two magazines. ''Fantastic'''s last independent issue was October 1980; thereafter the combined magazine returned to a bimonthly schedule. At the same time the title was changed to ''Amazing Science Fiction Stories''. Bernhard cut Mavor's salary after the merger, as she was editing only one magazine. Despite this, she stayed with ''Amazing'', but was unable to prevent circulation from dropping again, down to only 11,000 newsstand sales in 1982.<ref name=\"GTF_348-355\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', pp.&nbsp;348\u2013355.</ref>\n\nShortly after the merger, Bernhard decided to retire, and approached [[Edward Ferman]], the editor of ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction|Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'', and Joel Davis, at Davis Publications, among others, about a possible sale of ''Amazing''. Jonathan Post, of Emerald City Publishing, believed he had concluded a deal with Bernhard, and began to advertise for submissions, but the negotiations failed. Bernhard also approached [[George H. Scithers]], who declined, but put Bernhard in touch with [[Gary Gygax]] of [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]].

In keeping with Gernsback's new approach, this was one of Verne's least scientifically plausible novels. Also included were [[H. G. Wells]]'s \"[[The New Accelerator]]\", and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s \"[[The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar]]\"; Gernsback put the names of all three authors on the cover. He also reprinted three more recent stories. Two came from his own magazine, ''Science and Invention''; these were \"[[The Man from the Atom]]\" by [[G. Peyton Wertenbaker]] and \"[[The Thing from\u2014'Outside']]\" by [[George Allan England]]. The third was [[Austin Hall (writer)|Austin Hall]]'s ''[[The Man Who Saved the Earth]]'', which had appeared in ''[[All-Story Weekly]]''.<ref name=\"TTM_50-51\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;50\u201351.</ref>\n\nIn the June 1926 issue Gernsback announced a competition to write a short story to suit a cover drawn by illustrator Frank R. Paul, with a first prize of $250. The competition drew over 360 entries, seven of which were eventually printed in ''Amazing''. The winner was [[Cyril G. Wates]], who sold three more stories to Gernsback in the late 1920s. Two other entrants went on to become successful writers: one was [[Clare Winger Harris]], whose story, \"[[The Fate of the Poseidonia]]\", took third place in the competition, and was published in the June 1927 issue as by \"Mrs. F.C. Harris\". The other notable entrant was [[A. Hyatt Verrill]], with ''The Voice from the Inner World'', which appeared in July 1927.<ref name=\"TTM_51-54\" /><ref name=\"issues\" />\n\nA letter column, titled ''Discussions'' soon appeared, and became a regular feature with the January 1927 issue. Many science fiction readers were isolated in small communities, knowing nobody else who liked the same fiction. Gernsback's habit of publishing the full address of all his correspondents meant that the letter column allowed fans to correspond with each other directly. [[Science fiction fandom]] traces its beginnings to the letter column in ''Amazing'' and its competitors,<ref name=\"TTM_51-54\" /><ref name=\"issues\" /> and one historian of the field, author [[Lester del Rey]], has commented that the introduction of this letter column \"may have been one of the most important events in the history of science fiction\".<ref name=\"LDR_45\">del Rey, ''World of Science Fiction'', p.&nbsp;45.</ref>{{refn|An example of one fan of the genre reaching out to others is a 1929 letter by Earl Hess of McIntyre, FL.

It was proving difficult to attract new, high-quality material, and Gernsback's slowness at paying his authors did not help. Writers such as [[H. P. Lovecraft|H.P. Lovecraft]], [[H. G. Wells|H.G. Wells]], and [[Murray Leinster]] all avoided ''Amazing'' because Gernsback took so long to pay for the stories he printed. The slow payments were probably known to many of the other active pulp writers, which would have further limited the volume of submissions.

[[A. Merritt]]'s ''[[The Moon Pool]]'', which began serialization in May 1927, was an early success; there was little or no scientific basis to the story, but it was very popular with ''Amazing'''s readers.<ref name=\"TTM_54-56\" /> The covers, all of which were painted by Paul, were garish and juvenile, leading some readers to complain.

Smith's ''[[The Skylark of Space]]'', written between 1915 and 1920, was a seminal [[space opera]] that found no ready market when ''Argosy'' stopped printing science fiction.<ref name=\"TTM_60\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;60.</ref> When Smith saw a copy of the April 1927 issue of ''Amazing'', he submitted it to Sloane, and it appeared in the August\u2013October 1928 issues.<ref>Sanders, ''Smith'', pp. 1 & 9; Moskowitz, ''Seekers'', p. 15.</ref> It was such a success that Sloane requested a sequel before the second installment had been published.<ref>Moskowitz, ''Seekers'', p. 15.</ref> It was also in the August 1928 issue that \"Armageddon \u2013 2419 AD\", by [[Philip Francis Nowlan]], appeared; this was the first appearance of [[Buck Rogers]] in print.<ref name=\"TTM_61-62\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;61\u201362.</ref>\n\n===Sloane, Palmer, Browne and Fairman===\nSloane took over full control of the content of ''Amazing'' when Gernsback left in 1929.<ref name=\"TTM_64\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;64.</ref> He was infamous for his slow response to manuscripts, and when ''[[Astounding Stories]]'' was launched in January 1930, with better rates and faster editorial response, some of Sloane's writers quickly defected.<ref name=\"TTM_69\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;69.</ref> Little of quality appeared in ''Amazing'' during Sloane's tenure,<ref name=\"LDR_62\">del Rey, ''World of Science Fiction'', p.&nbsp;62.</ref> though \"The Lost Machine\", an early story by [[John Wyndham]], appeared in April 1932, under Wyndham's real name of John Beynon Harris.

He wanted the magazine to provide escapist entertainment, and had no interest in scientific accuracy. His terse instruction\u2014\"Gimme Bang-Bang\"\u2014to one pulp writer sums up his approach. Palmer disposed of almost all of Sloane's accumulated inventory, instead acquiring stories from local Chicago writers he knew through his connections with science fiction fandom.<ref name=\"LDR_114-5\">del Rey, ''World of Science Fiction'', pp.&nbsp;114\u2013115.</ref><ref name=\"TTM_112\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;112.</ref><ref name=\"TTM_116-117\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;116\u2013117.</ref> He also added features such as a \"Correspondence Corner\" and a \"Collectors' Corner\" to appeal to fans, and introduced a \"Meet the Authors\" feature, though on at least one occasion the featured author was a pseudonym, and the biographical details were invented. An illustrated back cover was tried, and soon became standard.<ref name=\"LDR_114-5\" /><ref name=\"TTM_118-119\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;118\u2013119.</ref> In 1939 Palmer acquired [[Isaac Asimov]]'s first sale, \"[[Marooned off Vesta]]\".<ref name=ESF_56>John Clute & Malcolm Edwards, \"Isaac Asimov\", in Clute & Nicholls, ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', p.&nbsp;56.</ref>\n\nIn the 1940s, several writers established themselves as a stable of reliable contributors to ''Amazing''. These included [[David Wright O'Brien]] and [[William P. McGivern]], both of whom wrote an immense amount for Ziff-Davis, much of it under [[pen name|house name]]s such as [[Alexander Blade]]. [[John Russell Fearn]] became a prolific contributor, using the pseudonyms \"Thornton Ayre\" and \"Polton Cross\".<ref name=\"LDR_116\">del Rey, ''World of Science Fiction'', p.&nbsp;116.</ref> Palmer also encouraged long-time science fiction writers to return, publishing pulp authors such as [[Ed Earl Repp]] and [[Eando Binder]]. This policy did not always meet with approval from ''Amazing'''s readers, who, despite a clear preference for action and adventure stories, could not stomach the work of some of the early pulp writers such as [[Harry Bates (author)|Harry Bates]].<ref name=\"TTM_176-177\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;176\u2013177.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Amazing0647.jpg|thumb|upright|right|June 1947 issue of ''Amazing Stories'', featuring the Shaver Mystery]]\nThe first Shaver Mystery story, \"I Remember Lemuria\", by [[Richard S. Shaver]], appeared in the March 1945 issue. Shaver claimed that all the world's accidents and disasters were caused by an ancient race of deros (short for \"detrimental robots\") who lived in underground cities. This explanation for the world's ills, coming towards the end of World War II, struck a chord with ''Amazing'''s readership. Palmer received over 2,500 letters, instead of the usual 40 or 50, and proceeded to print a Shaver story in every issue. The June 1947 issue was given over entirely to the Shaver Mystery.<ref name=\"TTM_179-180\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;179\u2013180.</ref> From March 1948 the Shaver Mystery was dropped as a regular feature of the magazine, at Ziff's insistence. Palmer left the following year, and Browne, his successor, \"was determined to make sure that the lunatics were no longer in charge of the asylum\", in the words of science fiction historian Mike Ashley.<ref name=\"TTM_184-185\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;184\u2013185.</ref>\n\nBrowne had acquired some good-quality material in the process of planning the launch of a new slick version of ''Amazing'', and when the plan was abandoned this material appeared in the continuing pulp version. This included \"Operation RSVP\" by [[H. Beam Piper]], and \"[[Satisfaction Guaranteed (short story)|Satisfaction Guaranteed]]\" by Isaac Asimov. Despite the cancellation of the planned change to a slick format, news had reached the writing community of ''Amazing'''s new approach, and Browne began to receive much better material than Palmer had been able to publish. The existing stable of ''Amazing'' writers, such as [[Rog Phillips]] and [[Chester S. Geier]], were replaced by writers such as [[Fritz Leiber]], [[Fredric Brown]], and [[Clifford D. Simak]]. Browne also discovered several writers who went on to success in the field, publishing first stories by [[Walter M. Miller]], [[Mack Reynolds]], [[John Jakes]], [[Milton Lesser]] and [[Charles Beaumont]], all within nine months in late 1950 and early 1951.<ref name=\"TTM_225\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;225.</ref> Browne was disappointed by the cancellation of the planned slick version, however, and to some extent reverted to Palmer's policy of publishing sensational fiction. In 1952, for example, he serialized the anonymous ''Master of the Universe'', which purported to be a history of the future from 1975 to 2575.<ref name=\"TTM_48-49\" />\n\nWith the change to digest size in 1953, Browne once again attempted to use higher-quality fiction. The first digest issue, dated April\u2013May 1953, included stories by [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Robert A. Heinlein|Robert Heinlein]], [[Richard Matheson]], [[Theodore Sturgeon]], and [[Murray Leinster]]. Further well-regarded stories appeared over the course of 1953, including [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s \"[[Encounter in the Dawn]]\", and [[Henry Kuttner]]'s \"Or Else\".<ref name=\"TTM_50\"/> Subsequent budget cuts meant that Browne was unable to sustain this level.<ref name=\"TTM_50-51\"/> As in the 1940s, ''Amazing'' gained a stable of writers who appeared frequently, though this time the quality of the writers was rather higher\u2014it included [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Robert Silverberg]], and [[Randall Garrett]]\u2014and the regular writers were not appearing only in Ziff-Davis magazines. This remained the situation after Browne's departure in 1956 and through Paul Fairman's tenure.<ref name=\"T_222-226\" />\n\n===Cele Goldsmith===\n[[Cele Goldsmith Lalli|Cele Goldsmith]]'s tenure as editor began with the opportunity to showcase two very well-established writers: [[E.E. Smith]] and Isaac Asimov. Smith's ''The Galaxy Primes'' began serialization in March 1959. Asimov's first published story, \"[[Marooned off Vesta]]\", had appeared in the March 1939 issue of ''Amazing'', and Goldsmith reprinted it in March 1959 along with a sequel and Asimov's comments on the story. She soon began to publish some of the better new writers. [[Cordwainer Smith]]'s \"Golden the Ship Was\u2014Oh! Oh! Oh!\" appeared in April; and by the middle of the following year she had managed to attract stories from [[Robert Sheckley]], [[Alan E. Nourse]], [[Fritz Leiber]], [[Gordon R. Dickson]], [[Robert Bloch]], and [[James Blish]]. The changes she made were enough to bring Robert Heinlein back as a subscriber; Heinlein read a copy of the June 1961 issue, which, he said, \"... caused me to think I had been missing something.\"<ref name=\"T_222-223\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;222\u2013223. The quote is from an unpublished letter from Heinlein to Goldsmith, quoted by Ashley.</ref>\n\n[[Image:amazing stories 196103.jpg|thumb|upright|left|March 1961 issue, featuring [[James Blish]]'s \"A Dusk of Idols\"]]\nIn September 1960 ''Amazing'' began to carry [[Sam Moskowitz]]'s series of author profiles, which had begun in ''Fantastic'', the sister magazine. The following month the cover and logo were redesigned. In April 1961, the 35th anniversary of the first issue, Goldsmith ran several reprints, including stories by [[Ray Bradbury]] and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]].<ref name=\"T_222-226\" /> Goldsmith had little previous experience with science fiction, and bought what she liked, rather than trying to conform to a notion of what science fiction should be. The result was the debut of more significant writers in her magazines than anywhere else at that time. She published the first stories of [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], [[Roger Zelazny]], [[Piers Anthony]] and [[Thomas M. Disch]], among many others. Award-winning stories published during Goldsmith's editorship include Zelazny's \"[[He Who Shapes]]\", a story about the use of dream therapy to cure phobias. It was serialized in the January and February 1965 issues, and won a [[Nebula Award]], an annual award voted on by science fiction writers. Goldsmith often wrote long, helpful letters to her authors: Zelazny commented in a letter to her that \"Most of anything I have learned was stimulated by those first sales, and then I learned, and possibly even learned more, from some of the later rejections\". Disch and Le Guin have also acknowledged the influence Goldsmith had on their early careers.<ref name=\"T_224-225\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;224\u2013225. The quote from Zelazny is from a personal letter from Zelazny to Cele Lalli (Goldsmith), dated March 20, 1965, quoted in Ashley p.&nbsp;225.</ref>\n\nThe cover art for ''Amazing'' had been largely supplied by [[Ed Valigursky]] during the late fifties, but during the early sixties a much wider variety of artists appeared, including [[Alex Schomburg]], [[Leo Summers]] and [[Ed Emshwiller]]. Frank Paul, who had painted all the covers for the first few years of ''Amazing'', contributed a wraparound cover for the April 1961 35th anniversary issue; this was his last cover art for a science fiction magazine.<ref name=\"T_222-226\" />\n\nGoldsmith's open-minded approach meant that ''Amazing'' and ''Fantastic'' published some writers who did not fit into the other magazines. [[Philip K. Dick]]'s sales to magazines had dropped, but his work began to appear in ''Amazing'', and Goldsmith also regularly published [[David R. Bunch]]'s stories of Moderan, a world whose inhabitants were part human and part metal. Bunch, whose stories were \"bewildering, exotic word pictures\" according to Mike Ashley, had been unable to sell regularly elsewhere.<ref name=\"T_222-226\" />\n\n===Reprint era and Ted White===\n[[Image:Annual circulation of Amazing Stories.gif|thumb|300px|right|Annual circulation from 1960 to 1993]]\nWhen Sol Cohen bought both ''Amazing'' and ''Fantastic'' in early 1965, he decided to maximize profits by filling the magazines almost entirely with reprints. Cohen had acquired second serial rights from Ziff-Davis to all stories that had been printed in both magazines, and also in the companion magazines such as ''Fantastic Adventures''. Joseph Wrzos, the new editor, persuaded Cohen that at least one new story should appear in each issue; there was sufficient inventory left over from Goldsmith's tenure for this to be done without acquiring new material. Readers initially approved of the policy, since it made available some well-loved stories from earlier decades that had not been reprinted elsewhere.<ref name=\"T_263-264\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;263\u2013264.</ref> Both of Wrzos's successors, Harry Harrison and Barry Malzberg, were unable to persuade Cohen to use more new fiction.<ref name=\"T_266-267\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;266\u2013267.</ref>\n\nWhen Ted White took over, it was on condition that the reprints be phased out. This took some time: for a while both ''Amazing'' and ''Fantastic'' continued to include one reprint every issue; with the May 1972 issue the transformation was complete, and all stories were new. As well as eliminating the reprints, White reintroduced features such as a letter column and  \"The Clubhouse,\" a [[fanzine]] review and fannish news column. He continued the book review column, and a series of science articles by [[Gregory Benford]] and [[David Book]]. White also redesigned the look of the magazine, making it, in sf historian Mike Ashley's words, \"far more modern and sophisticated\".<ref name=\"GTF_70-74\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', pp.&nbsp;70\u201374.</ref>\n\nWhite was willing to print a variety of fiction, mixing traditional stories with more experimental material that was influenced by the British [[New Wave (science fiction)|New Wave]] or by 1960s [[Psychedelic art|psychedelia]]. In 1971 he serialized [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''The Lathe of Heaven'', about a man whose dreams can modify reality. One writer influenced by this was [[James Tiptree, Jr.]], who later wrote that \"after first plowing into the first pulpy pages of the 1971 ''Amazing'' in which ''Lathe'' came out, my toe-nails began to curl under and my spine hair stood up.\"<ref name=\"GTF_74-76\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', pp.&nbsp;74\u201376. The quote is from ''Universe SF Review'', September/October 1975, quoted by Ashley on p.&nbsp;76.</ref> White's willingness to experiment led to ''Amazing'' running more stories with sexual content than other magazines. One such story, White's own \"Growing Up Fast in the City\", was criticized as pornographic by some of ''Amazing'''s readers. Other stories, such as Rich Brown's \"Two of a Kind\", about the violent rape of a black woman and the subsequent death of her rapists, also led to controversy. White printed more conventional fiction as well, much of it high quality. The magazine was nominated for the [[Hugo award]] (a readers' award, named for Hugo Gernsback) for best editor three times during his tenure (1970, 1971 and 1972), finishing third each time.<ref name=\"GTF_82-83\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', pp.&nbsp;82\u201383.</ref>\n\nWhite's ability to attract new writers suffered because of the low rates he paid: one cent per word, as compared to three or five cents per word at the leading competitive magazines. To compensate, White cultivated new writers whose experimental work was not selling elsewhere. He made a deal in 1971 with [[Gordon Eklund]], who was hesitating to become a full-time writer because of the financial risks. White agreed to buy anything Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed it was a good story. The result was that much of Eklund's fiction appeared in ''Amazing'' and ''Fantastic'' over the next few years.<ref name=\"GTF_78-79\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', pp.&nbsp;78\u201379.</ref>\n\n''Amazing'''s reputation had been for formulaic science fiction almost since it began, but White was able to take the magazine to a higher standard than any other editor except Cele Goldsmith,<ref name=\"NESF_16\">Gunn, ''New Encyclopedia'', p.&nbsp;16.</ref> and gave ''Amazing'' a respected position in the field.<ref name=\"NESF_503\">Gunn, ''New Encyclopedia'', p.&nbsp;503.</ref> His successors were not able to maintain the same level of quality.<ref name=\"NESF_16\" />\n\n===After Ted White===\nWhen Elinor Mavor took over, in early 1979, she had no experience with science fiction magazines, and was unaware of the history of bad feeling within the science fiction community about the poor payments for reprinted stories. She was given an extremely limited budget to work with, and had few stories on hand to work with initially, and as a result her first issues contained several reprints. Mavor experimented in her first year with some new ideas, such as starting a story on the back cover in order to hook readers into buying the magazine to finish the story. She also began a serial story in graphic format that used reader input to continue its plot. It was not a success and \"thankfully\", according to Mike Ashley, the experiment was terminated after only three episodes.<ref name=\"GTF_348-355\" />\n\nOver time Mavor was to some extent able to reverse the negative perceptions of ''Amazing'' among established authors, but she was initially forced to work primarily with newer writers. Early discoveries of hers include [[Michael P. Kube-McDowell]], [[John E. Stith]] and [[Richard Paul Russo]]. In a notice published in her first issue, she asked readers for help in assembling news, reviews and fan information, and soon added columns that covered these areas. In 1981 [[Robert Silverberg]] began a series of opinion columns. The artwork was of high quality, including work by [[Stephen Fabian]], and later by [[David Burroughs Mattingly|David Mattingly]].<ref name=\"GTF_348-355\" />\n\nAfter the merger with ''Fantastic'', Mavor continued to draw well-known writers to the magazine, including [[Orson Scott Card]], [[George R. R. Martin]], and [[Roger Zelazny]]. [[Brad Linaweaver]]'s ''Moon of Ice'', which appeared in March 1982, was nominated for a [[Nebula award]]; Martin's ''Unsound Variations'', which had appeared the issue before, was nominated for both a Nebula and a Hugo award.<ref name=\"GTF_348-355\" />\n\nHistorian [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]]'s assessment of ''Amazing'' in the 1980s is that Mavor, Scithers and Price, who between them edited ''Amazing'' for a decade, were unable to sustain the standards established by Ted White in the 1970s.<ref name=\"NESF_16\" /> [[Brian Stableford]], by contrast, comments that both Scithers and Price made efforts to publish good material, and that the packaging, from 1991 onwards, was perhaps the best presented of any science fiction magazine.<ref name=\"ESF_25\" />\n\nWith the Wizards of the Coast relaunch in 1998 the contents, under editor Kim Mohan, became more media-focused. The initial plan was to have two or three stories per issue based on films, TV, and games.<ref name=\"Locus_Summer1998\" /><ref name=\"Locus_1998\">{{cite web | url = http://www.locusmag.com/1998/News/News01.html | title = Locus Online: SF News January 1998 | accessdate= September 20, 2008|publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> The 600th issue, in early 2000, included a [[Harlan Ellison]] story, as well as a story from the 100th issue, the 200th issue, and so on, up to the 500th issue.

Paizo also ran a [[blog]] for the magazine.<ref name=\"Locus_Aug2004\">{{cite web | url = http://www.locusmag.com/2004/Monitor/Magazines08a.html | title = Locus Online: New Magazines|date= August 2004|page= 1 | accessdate= September 22, 2008|publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref><ref name=\"Paizo_blog\">{{cite web | url = http://paizo.com/amazing/blog | title = Paizo Amazing blog | accessdate = October 22, 2006 | publisher = Paizo Publishing | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061209103804/http://paizo.com/amazing/blog | archivedate = December 9, 2006 }}</ref> The fiction received positive reviews,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.locusmag.com/2004/Monitor/Magazines11b.html | title = Locus Online: New Magazines|date= November 2004|page= 2 | accessdate= September 22, 2008|publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> but Paizo soon put the magazine on temporary hold, and canceled it permanently the following year.<ref name=\"Paizo\" />  The title remained in limbo until Steve Davidson's online version appeared in 2012.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://granitegeek.concordmonitor.com/2015/11/06/push-to-push-to-resurrect-amazing-stores-the-iconic-science-fiction-magazine-gets-a-tv-boost/|title=Push to resurrect Amazing Stories|first= David|last=Brooks|publisher=Granite Geek|date=November 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Influence on the field===\n''Amazing Stories'' was influential simply by being the first of its kind. In the words of science fiction writer and critic [[Damon Knight]], the magazine was \"a snag in the stream of history, from which a V-shape spread out in dozens and then in hundreds of altered lives\".<ref name=\"DKTF_2\">Knight, ''Futurians'', p.&nbsp;2.</ref> Many early fans of the field began to communicate with each other through the letter column, and to publish [[fanzine]]s\u2014amateur fan publications that helped establish connections among fans across the country. Many of these fans in turn became successful writers; and the existence of an organized science fiction fandom, and of writers such as [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and Isaac Asimov, who came to writing directly from fandom, can be dated to the creation of ''Amazing Stories''.<ref name=\"DKTF_2\"/> After the first few years, when there was little or no competition, ''Amazing Stories'' never again led the field in the eyes of critics or fans. Despite its long history, the magazine rarely contributed much to science fiction beyond the initial creation of the genre,<ref name=\"ATYS_205\">Aldiss, ''Trillion Year Spree'', p.&nbsp;205.</ref> though Gernsback himself is commemorated in the name ''Hugo'', which is the almost universally used term for the [[World Science Fiction Society]]'s annually presented [[Science Fiction Achievement Award]]s.<ref name=\"FDV_3\">Franson and DeVore, \"History\", p.&nbsp;3.</ref><ref name=\"ESF_Hugo\">Nicholls, Peter, \"Hugo\", in Clute & Nicholls, ''Hugo'', p.&nbsp;595.</ref> Gernsback has also been called the \"Father of Science Fiction\" for his role in creating ''Amazing Stories''.<ref name=\"Father\">See, for example, the titles of Moskowitz, ''Hugo Gernsback: Father of Science Fiction'', and Siegel, ''Hugo Gernsback: Father of Modern Science Fiction''.</ref>\n\n==Publication details==\n\n===Editors===\nBibliographers do not always agree who should be listed as editor of any given issue of ''Amazing''. For example, Gernsback was in control for the first three years, but Sloane performed all the editorial duties related to fiction, and he is sometimes described as the editor. Similarly, later editors were sometimes under the supervision of editorial directors. Bernard Davis held the title of \"Editor\" of all Ziff-Davis magazines when at that company, with the actual editing of the magazines done by respective \"Managing Editors\".The table below, and the charts above, generally follow the mastheads in the magazines, with short notes added. More details are given in the publishing history section, above, which focuses on when the editors involved actually obtained control of the magazine contents, instead of when their names appeared on the masthead.\n* [[Hugo Gernsback]] (April 1926 \u2013 April 1929).

Fairman actually took over editorial duties with the May or June 1956 issue.<ref name=\"AMZ_56_5-7\">Fairman began writing the editorials with the May 1956 issue, and in the July 1956 editorial he explained that Browne was on a two-month contract in Hollywood, writing scripts for ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]''. In the August editorial he announced that the change was permanent, and in the September 1956 issue Fairman was listed as editor on the masthead for the first time.

These last eight issues were numbered volume 1, numbers 1 to 8.<ref name=\"Tuck_535\" /> There was also a Canadian edition, which lasted for 24 issues, from September 1933 to August 1935, from Teck Publications; these were identical to the US editions except that the front covers were overprinted with \"Printed in Canada on Canadian Paper\".

Volume 1, Number 1.jpg|thumb|right|First issue of ''Amazing Stories'', art by [[Frank R. Paul]]. This copy was autographed by [[Hugo Gernsback]] in 1965]]\n'''''Amazing Stories''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[science fiction magazine]] launched in April 1926 by [[Hugo Gernsback]]'s [[Experimenter Publishing]]. It was the first magazine devoted solely to [[science fiction]]. Science fiction stories had made regular appearances in other magazines, including some published by Gernsback, but ''Amazing'' helped define and launch a new genre of [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]].\n\nAs of 2018, ''Amazing'' has been published, with some interruptions, for ninety-two years, going through a half-dozen owners and many editors as it struggled to be profitable. Gernsback was forced into bankruptcy and lost control of the magazine in 1929. In 1938 it was purchased by [[Ziff-Davis]], who hired [[Raymond A. Palmer]] as editor. Palmer made the magazine successful though it was not regarded as a quality magazine within the science fiction community. In the late 1940s ''Amazing'' presented as fact stories about the [[Shaver Mystery]], a lurid mythos that explained accidents and disaster as the work of robots named deros, which led to dramatically increased circulation but widespread ridicule. ''Amazing'' switched to a [[digest size]] format in 1953, shortly before the end of the pulp-magazine era. It was sold to Sol Cohen's Universal Publishing Company in 1965, which filled it with reprinted stories but did not pay a reprint fee to the authors, creating a conflict with the newly formed [[Science Fiction Writers of America]]. [[Ted White (author)|Ted White]] took over as editor in 1969, eliminated the reprints and made the magazine respected again: ''Amazing'' was nominated for the prestigious [[Hugo Award]] three times during his tenure in the 1970s. Several other owners attempted to create a modern incarnation of the magazine in the following decades, but publication was suspended after the March 2005 issue. A new incarnation appeared in July 2012 as an online magazine.  Print publication resumed with the Fall 2018 issue.\n\nGernsback's initial editorial approach was to blend instruction with entertainment; he believed science fiction could educate readers. His audience rapidly showed a preference for implausible adventures, and the movement away from Gernsback's idealism accelerated when the magazine changed hands in 1929. Despite this, Gernsback had an enormous impact on the field: the creation of a specialist magazine for science fiction spawned an entire genre publishing industry. The letter columns in ''Amazing'', where fans could make contact with each other, led to the formation of science fiction fandom, which in turn had a strong influence on the development of the field. Writers whose first story was published in the magazine include [[John W. Campbell]], [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Howard Fast]], [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], [[Roger Zelazny]], and [[Thomas M. Disch]]. Overall, though, ''Amazing'' itself was rarely an influential magazine within the genre after the 1920s. Some critics have commented that by \"ghettoizing\" science fiction, Gernsback harmed its literary growth, but this viewpoint has been countered by the argument that science fiction needed an independent market to develop in to reach its potential.\n\n==Origins==\n[[Image:Science and Invention Jan 1922 pg824.png|thumb|upright|left| A \"scientific fiction\" story illustrated by Frank R. Paul in a 1922 issue of ''Science and Invention'']]\nBy the end of the 19th century, stories centered on scientific inventions, and stories set in the future, were appearing regularly in popular fiction magazines. The market for short stories lent itself to tales of invention in the tradition of [[Jules Verne]].<ref name=\"TTM_7\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;7.</ref> Magazines such as ''[[Munsey's Magazine]]'' and ''[[Argosy (magazine)|The Argosy]]'', launched in 1889 and 1896 respectively, carried a few science fiction stories each year. Some upmarket \"slick\" magazines such as ''[[McClure's]]'', which paid well and were aimed at a more literary audience, also carried scientific stories, but by the early years of the 20th century, science fiction (though it was not yet called that) was appearing more often in the [[pulp magazine]]s than in the slicks.<ref name=\"TTM_21-25\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;21\u201325.</ref><ref name=\"ESF_Pulp\">Nicholls, Peter, \"Pulp Magazines\", in Clute & Nicholls, ''Encyclopedia of SF'', p.&nbsp;979.</ref><ref name=\"T_155\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', p.&nbsp;155.</ref>\n\nIn 1908, Hugo Gernsback published the first issue of ''[[Modern Electrics]]'', a magazine aimed at the scientific hobbyist. It was an immediate success, and Gernsback began to include articles on imaginative uses of science, such as \"Wireless on Saturn\" (December 1908).<ref name=\"TTM_28-29\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;28\u201329.</ref> In April 1911, Gernsback began the serialization of his science fiction novel, ''[[Ralph 124C 41+]]'', but in 1913 he sold his interest in the magazine to his partner and launched a new magazine, ''[[Electrical Experimenter]]'', which soon began to publish scientific fiction. In 1920 Gernsback retitled the magazine ''Science and Invention'', and through the early 1920s he published much scientific fiction in its pages, along with non-fiction scientific articles.<ref name=\"TTM_29-35\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;29\u201335.</ref>\n\nGernsback had started another magazine called ''Practical Electrics'' in 1921. In 1924, he changed its name to ''The Experimenter'',<ref name=\"TTM_48-49\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;48\u201349.</ref> and sent a letter to 25,000 people to gauge interest in the possibility of a magazine devoted to scientific fiction; in his words, \"the response was such that the idea was given up for two years.\"<ref name=\"TTM_47\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;47.</ref> However, in 1926 he decided to go ahead, and ceased publication of ''The Experimenter'' to make room in his publishing schedule for a new magazine.

Shaver responded with a story called \"I Remember [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]]\", published in the March 1945 issue, which was presented by Palmer as a mixture of truth and fiction. The story, about prehistoric civilizations, dramatically boosted ''Amazing'''s circulation, and Palmer ran a new Shaver story in every issue, culminating in a special issue in June 1947 devoted entirely to the Shaver Mystery, as it was called.{{refn|Palmer claimed the highest circulation of any science fiction magazine, but del Rey comments that though this may have been true, \"Palmer's tendency to magnify everything about the magazine cannot be discounted.\"<ref name=\"LDR_117-8_note\">del Rey, ''World of Science Fiction'', pp.&nbsp;117\u2013118.</ref>|group=notes}}<ref name=\"TTM_178-180\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;178\u2013180.</ref> ''Amazing'' soon drew ridicule for these stories. A derisive article by [[William S. Baring-Gould]] in the September 1946 issue of ''[[Harper's]]'' prompted [[William Bernard Ziff, Sr.|William Ziff]] to tell Palmer to limit the amount of Shaver-related material in the magazine; Palmer complied, but his interest (and possibly belief) in this sort of material was now significant, and he soon began planning to leave Ziff-Davis. In 1947 he formed Clark Publications, launching ''[[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]'' the following year, and in 1949 he resigned from Ziff-Davis to edit that and other magazines.<ref name=\"TTM_183-185\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;183\u2013185.</ref>\n\n[[Howard Browne]], who had been on a leave of absence from Ziff-Davis to write fiction, took over as editor and began by throwing away 300,000 words of inventory that Palmer had acquired before he left.<ref name=\"TTM_183-185\" /> Browne had ambitions of moving ''Amazing'' upmarket, and his argument was strengthened by [[Street & Smith]], one of the longest established and most respected publishers, who shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, largely as a result of the success of [[paperback|pocketbooks]], and Street & Smith decided to concentrate on their slick magazines. Some pulps struggled on for a few more years, but Browne was able to persuade Ziff and Davis that the future was in the slicks, and they raised his fiction budget from one cent to a ceiling of five cents per word. Browne managed to get promises of new stories from many well-known authors, including [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Theodore Sturgeon]]. He produced a dummy issue<ref name=\"dummy\">A dummy issue is a magazine issue produced to show to potential advertisers or for advance review.

Although he stayed involved with ''[[Fantastic Adventures]]'', another Ziff-Davis magazine, he left the editing work on ''Amazing'' to [[William Hamling (publisher)|William Hamling]] and Lila Shaffer. In December 1950, when Ziff-Davis moved their offices from Chicago to New York, Hamling stayed behind in Chicago, and Browne revived his involvement with the magazine.<ref name=\"T_7\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', p.&nbsp;7.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, Browne convinced Ziff-Davis to try a high-quality digest fantasy magazine. ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]'', which appeared in the summer of that year, focused on [[fantasy]] rather than science fiction and was so successful that it persuaded Ziff-Davis to switch ''Amazing'' from pulp format to digest in early 1953 (while also switching to a bimonthly schedule). Circulation fell, however, and subsequent budget cuts limited the story quality in both ''Amazing'' and ''Fantastic''. ''Fantastic'' began to print science fiction as well as fantasy. Circulation increased as a result, but Browne, who was not a science fiction aficionado, once again lost interest in the magazines.<ref name=\"T_48-51\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;48\u201351.</ref>\n\n[[Paul W.

Readers' letters in ''Amazing'' had indicated a desire for novels, which ''Amazing'' did not have room to run. The novel series did not last; only one, [[Henry Slesar]]'s ''20 Million Miles to Earth'', appeared. However, in response to readers' interest in longer fiction, Ziff-Davis expanded ''Amazing'' by 16 pages, starting with the March 1958 issue, and the magazine began to run complete novels.<ref name=\"T_173-174\" />\n\nFairman left to edit ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]'' at the end of 1958, and his place was taken by [[Cele Goldsmith]]. Goldsmith had been hired in 1955 as a secretary and became assistant editor to help cope with the additional work created when Ziff-Davis launched two short-lived magazines, ''Dream World'' and ''Pen Pals'', in 1956. Ziff-Davis were not confident of Goldsmith's abilities as an editor, so when Fairman left, a consultant, Norman Lobsenz, was hired to work with her. She performed well, however, and Lobsenz's involvement soon became minimal.<ref name=\"T_222-226\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;222\u2013226.</ref>\n\n===1960s===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 11pt; margin-right: 2em; text-align: center; float: left\"\n! !!Jan !!

Le Guin]] and [[Roger Zelazny]],<ref name=\"T_222-226\" /> but circulation lagged during her tenure. By 1964 ''Fantastic'''s circulation was down to 27,000, with ''Amazing'' doing little better. The following March both ''Amazing'' and ''Fantastic'' were sold to Ultimate Publishing Company, run by [[Sol Cohen]] and Arthur Bernhard.<ref name=\"NYT 1965\">{{cite news | last =Carlson | first =Walter | title =Advertising: Death and Taxes and Insurance | work = The New York Times | page =62 | date =June 23, 1965}}\" [P]urchase by the Ultimate Publishing Company, Inc., of two science-fiction magazines from Ziff-Davis Publishing Company.

Wrzos used the name \"Joseph Ross\" on the [[Masthead (American publishing)|masthead]]s to avoid mis-spellings.<ref name=\"T_263\" /> Both magazines immediately moved to a bi-monthly schedule.<ref name=\"T_321\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', p.&nbsp;321.</ref><ref name=\"T_325\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', p.&nbsp;325.</ref>\n\nCohen had acquired reprint rights to the magazines' back issues, although Wrzos did get Cohen to agree to print one new story every issue. Cohen was also producing reprint magazines such as ''[[Great Science Fiction]]'' and ''[[Science Fiction Classics]]'', but no payment was made to authors for any of these reprints. This brought Cohen into conflict with the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] (SFWA), a professional writers' organization formed in 1965. Soon SFWA called for a boycott of Ultimate's magazines until Cohen agreed to make payments. Cohen agreed to pay a flat fee for all stories, and then in August 1967 this was changed to a graduated rate, depending on the length of the story.<ref name=\"T_263-267\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;263\u2013267.</ref> [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]] had acted as an intermediary in Cohen's negotiations with SFWA, and when Wrzos left in 1967, Cohen asked Harrison to take over. ''[[Science Fantasy (magazine)|SF Impulse]]'', which Harrison had been editing, had folded in February 1967, so Harrison was available. He secured Cohen's agreement that the policy of printing almost nothing but reprinted stories would be phased out by the end of the year, and took over as editor with the September 1967 issue.<ref name=\"T_263-267\" />\n\nBy February 1968 Harrison decided to leave, as Cohen was showing no signs of abandoning the reprints. He resigned, and suggested [[Barry Malzberg]] to Cohen as a possible successor. Cohen knew Malzberg from his work at the [[Scott Meredith Literary Agency]], and thought that he might be more amenable than Harrison to continuing the reprint policy. Malzberg took over in April 1968, but immediately came into conflict with Cohen over the reprints, and then threatened to resign in October 1968 over a disagreement about artwork Malzberg had commissioned for a cover. Cohen contacted [[Robert Silverberg]], then the president of SFWA, and told him (falsely) that Malzberg had actually resigned. Silverberg recommended [[Ted White (author)|Ted White]] as a replacement. Cohen secured White's agreement and then fired Malzberg; White assumed control with the May 1969 issue.<ref name=\"T_263-267\" />\n\n===1970s===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 11pt; margin-left: 2em; text-align: center; float: right\"\n! !!Jan !!

The apparently erroneous<br/>volume numbering for the November 1979 issue is in fact shown correctly.\n|}When White took over as editor, ''Amazing'''s circulation was about 38,500, only about 4% of which were subscribers (as opposed to newsstand sales). This was a very low ebb for subscriptions; ''Analog'', by comparison, sold about 35% of its circulation through subscriptions. Cohen's wife mailed out the subscription copies from home, and Cohen had never tried to increase the subscriber base as this would have increased the burden on his wife.<ref name=\"GTF_72\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', p.&nbsp;72.</ref> White worked hard to increase the circulation despite Cohen's lack of support, but met with limited success. One of his first changes was to reduce the [[typeface]] to increase the amount of fiction in the magazine. To pay for this he increased the price of both ''Fantastic'' and ''Amazing'' to 60 cents, but this had a strong negative effect on circulation, which fell about 10% from 1969 to 1970.<ref name=\"GTF_74\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', p.&nbsp;74.</ref><ref name=\"GTF_480\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', p.&nbsp;480.</ref>\n\nIn 1972, White changed the title to ''Amazing Science Fiction'', distancing the magazine slightly from some of the pulp connotations of \"Amazing Stories\".<ref name=\"GTF_74\" /> White worked at a low wage, and his friends often read manuscripts for free, but despite his efforts the circulation continued to fall. From near 40,000 when White joined the magazine, the circulation fell to about 23,000 in October 1975. White was unwilling to continue with the very limited financial backing that Cohen provided, and he resigned in 1975. Cohen was able to convince White to remain; White promised to stay for one more year, but in the event remained as editor until late 1978.<ref name=\"GTF_84-85\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', pp.&nbsp;84\u201385.</ref>\n\n''Amazing'' raised its price from 75 cents to $1.00 with the November 1975 issue. The schedule switched to quarterly beginning with the March 1976 issue; as a result, the 50th anniversary issue had a cover date of June 1976. In 1977, Cohen announced that ''Amazing'' and ''Fantastic'' had lost $15,000, though ''Amazing'''s circulation (at nearly 26,000) was as good as it had been for several years. Cohen looked for a new publisher to buy the magazines, but in September of the following year sold his half-share in the company to his partner, Arthur Bernhard.<ref name=\"GTF_480\" /><ref name=\"GTF_85-86\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', pp.&nbsp;85\u201386.</ref> White had occasionally suggested to Cohen that ''Amazing'' would benefit from a redesign and investment; he made the same suggestions to Bernhard in early October. According to White, Bernhard not only said no, but told him he would not receive a salary until the next issue was turned in.

She had worked for Bernhard as an illustrator and in the production department of several of his magazines, though not for ''Amazing''. She had also been an editor at ''Bill of Fare'', a restaurant trade magazine. Mavor had read a good deal of science fiction but knew nothing about the world of science fiction magazines when she took over. She was not confident that a woman would be accepted as the editor of a science fiction magazine, so she initially used the pseudonym \"Omar Gohagen\" for both ''Amazing'' and ''Fantastic'', dropping it late in 1980. Circulation continued to fall, and Bernhard refused to consider Mavor's request to undertake a subscription drive, which might have helped. Instead, in late 1980, Bernhard decided to merge the two magazines. ''Fantastic'''s last independent issue was October 1980; thereafter the combined magazine returned to a bimonthly schedule. At the same time the title was changed to ''Amazing Science Fiction Stories''. Bernhard cut Mavor's salary after the merger, as she was editing only one magazine. Despite this, she stayed with ''Amazing'', but was unable to prevent circulation from dropping again, down to only 11,000 newsstand sales in 1982.<ref name=\"GTF_348-355\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', pp.&nbsp;348\u2013355.</ref>\n\nShortly after the merger, Bernhard decided to retire, and approached [[Edward Ferman]], the editor of ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction|Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'', and Joel Davis, at Davis Publications, among others, about a possible sale of ''Amazing''. Jonathan Post, of Emerald City Publishing, believed he had concluded a deal with Bernhard, and began to advertise for submissions, but the negotiations failed. Bernhard also approached [[George H. Scithers]], who declined, but put Bernhard in touch with [[Gary Gygax]] of [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]].

In keeping with Gernsback's new approach, this was one of Verne's least scientifically plausible novels. Also included were [[H. G. Wells]]'s \"[[The New Accelerator]]\", and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s \"[[The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar]]\"; Gernsback put the names of all three authors on the cover. He also reprinted three more recent stories. Two came from his own magazine, ''Science and Invention''; these were \"[[The Man from the Atom]]\" by [[G. Peyton Wertenbaker]] and \"[[The Thing from\u2014'Outside']]\" by [[George Allan England]]. The third was [[Austin Hall (writer)|Austin Hall]]'s ''[[The Man Who Saved the Earth]]'', which had appeared in ''[[All-Story Weekly]]''.<ref name=\"TTM_50-51\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;50\u201351.</ref>\n\nIn the June 1926 issue Gernsback announced a competition to write a short story to suit a cover drawn by illustrator Frank R. Paul, with a first prize of $250. The competition drew over 360 entries, seven of which were eventually printed in ''Amazing''. The winner was [[Cyril G. Wates]], who sold three more stories to Gernsback in the late 1920s. Two other entrants went on to become successful writers: one was [[Clare Winger Harris]], whose story, \"[[The Fate of the Poseidonia]]\", took third place in the competition, and was published in the June 1927 issue as by \"Mrs. F.C. Harris\". The other notable entrant was [[A. Hyatt Verrill]], with ''The Voice from the Inner World'', which appeared in July 1927.<ref name=\"TTM_51-54\" /><ref name=\"issues\" />\n\nA letter column, titled ''Discussions'' soon appeared, and became a regular feature with the January 1927 issue. Many science fiction readers were isolated in small communities, knowing nobody else who liked the same fiction. Gernsback's habit of publishing the full address of all his correspondents meant that the letter column allowed fans to correspond with each other directly. [[Science fiction fandom]] traces its beginnings to the letter column in ''Amazing'' and its competitors,<ref name=\"TTM_51-54\" /><ref name=\"issues\" /> and one historian of the field, author [[Lester del Rey]], has commented that the introduction of this letter column \"may have been one of the most important events in the history of science fiction\".<ref name=\"LDR_45\">del Rey, ''World of Science Fiction'', p.&nbsp;45.</ref>{{refn|An example of one fan of the genre reaching out to others is a 1929 letter by Earl Hess of McIntyre, FL.

It was proving difficult to attract new, high-quality material, and Gernsback's slowness at paying his authors did not help. Writers such as [[H. P. Lovecraft|H.P. Lovecraft]], [[H. G. Wells|H.G. Wells]], and [[Murray Leinster]] all avoided ''Amazing'' because Gernsback took so long to pay for the stories he printed. The slow payments were probably known to many of the other active pulp writers, which would have further limited the volume of submissions. New writers did appear, but the quality of their stories was often weak.<ref name=\"TTM_54-56\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;54\u201356.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Amazing stories 192809.jpg|thumb|upright|left|September 1928 issue.

[[A. Merritt]]'s ''[[The Moon Pool]]'', which began serialization in May 1927, was an early success; there was little or no scientific basis to the story, but it was very popular with ''Amazing'''s readers.<ref name=\"TTM_54-56\" /> The covers, all of which were painted by Paul, were garish and juvenile, leading some readers to complain. Raymond Palmer, later to become an editor of the magazine, wrote that a friend of his was forced to stop buying ''Amazing'' \"by reason of his parents' dislike of the cover illustrations\".<ref name=\"TTM_56_Q\">\"Discussions\", ''Amazing Stories'', October 1928, p. 662; quoted in Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;56.</ref> Gernsback experimented with a more sober cover for the September 1928 issue, but it sold poorly, and so the lurid covers continued.<ref name=\"TTM_54-56\" /> The combination of poor quality fiction with garish artwork has led some critics to comment that Gernsback created a \"ghetto\" for science fiction,<ref name=\"TTM_58\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;58.</ref> though it has also been argued that the creation of a specialized market allowed science fiction to develop and mature as a genre.<ref name=\"LDR_80\">del Rey, ''World of Science Fiction'', p.&nbsp;80.</ref>\n\nAmong the regular writers for ''Amazing'' by the end of the 1920s were several who were influential and popular at the time, such as [[David H. Keller]] and [[Stanton Coblentz]], and some who would continue to be successful for much longer, most notably [[Edward E. Smith]] and [[Jack Williamson]]. Smith's ''[[The Skylark of Space]]'', written between 1915 and 1920, was a seminal [[space opera]] that found no ready market when ''Argosy'' stopped printing science fiction.<ref name=\"TTM_60\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;60.</ref> When Smith saw a copy of the April 1927 issue of ''Amazing'', he submitted it to Sloane, and it appeared in the August\u2013October 1928 issues.<ref>Sanders, ''Smith'', pp. 1 & 9; Moskowitz, ''Seekers'', p. 15.</ref> It was such a success that Sloane requested a sequel before the second installment had been published.<ref>Moskowitz, ''Seekers'', p. 15.</ref> It was also in the August 1928 issue that \"Armageddon \u2013 2419 AD\", by [[Philip Francis Nowlan]], appeared; this was the first appearance of [[Buck Rogers]] in print.<ref name=\"TTM_61-62\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;61\u201362.</ref>\n\n===Sloane, Palmer, Browne and Fairman===\nSloane took over full control of the content of ''Amazing'' when Gernsback left in 1929.<ref name=\"TTM_64\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;64.</ref> He was infamous for his slow response to manuscripts, and when ''[[Astounding Stories]]'' was launched in January 1930, with better rates and faster editorial response, some of Sloane's writers quickly defected.<ref name=\"TTM_69\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;69.</ref> Little of quality appeared in ''Amazing'' during Sloane's tenure,<ref name=\"LDR_62\">del Rey, ''World of Science Fiction'', p.&nbsp;62.</ref> though \"The Lost Machine\", an early story by [[John Wyndham]], appeared in April 1932, under Wyndham's real name of John Beynon Harris.

He wanted the magazine to provide escapist entertainment, and had no interest in scientific accuracy. His terse instruction\u2014\"Gimme Bang-Bang\"\u2014to one pulp writer sums up his approach. Palmer disposed of almost all of Sloane's accumulated inventory, instead acquiring stories from local Chicago writers he knew through his connections with science fiction fandom.<ref name=\"LDR_114-5\">del Rey, ''World of Science Fiction'', pp.&nbsp;114\u2013115.</ref><ref name=\"TTM_112\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;112.</ref><ref name=\"TTM_116-117\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;116\u2013117.</ref> He also added features such as a \"Correspondence Corner\" and a \"Collectors' Corner\" to appeal to fans, and introduced a \"Meet the Authors\" feature, though on at least one occasion the featured author was a pseudonym, and the biographical details were invented. An illustrated back cover was tried, and soon became standard.<ref name=\"LDR_114-5\" /><ref name=\"TTM_118-119\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;118\u2013119.</ref> In 1939 Palmer acquired [[Isaac Asimov]]'s first sale, \"[[Marooned off Vesta]]\".<ref name=ESF_56>John Clute & Malcolm Edwards, \"Isaac Asimov\", in Clute & Nicholls, ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', p.&nbsp;56.</ref>\n\nIn the 1940s, several writers established themselves as a stable of reliable contributors to ''Amazing''. These included [[David Wright O'Brien]] and [[William P. McGivern]], both of whom wrote an immense amount for Ziff-Davis, much of it under [[pen name|house name]]s such as [[Alexander Blade]]. [[John Russell Fearn]] became a prolific contributor, using the pseudonyms \"Thornton Ayre\" and \"Polton Cross\".<ref name=\"LDR_116\">del Rey, ''World of Science Fiction'', p.&nbsp;116.</ref> Palmer also encouraged long-time science fiction writers to return, publishing pulp authors such as [[Ed Earl Repp]] and [[Eando Binder]]. This policy did not always meet with approval from ''Amazing'''s readers, who, despite a clear preference for action and adventure stories, could not stomach the work of some of the early pulp writers such as [[Harry Bates (author)|Harry Bates]].<ref name=\"TTM_176-177\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;176\u2013177.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Amazing0647.jpg|thumb|upright|right|June 1947 issue of ''Amazing Stories'', featuring the Shaver Mystery]]\nThe first Shaver Mystery story, \"I Remember Lemuria\", by [[Richard S. Shaver]], appeared in the March 1945 issue. Shaver claimed that all the world's accidents and disasters were caused by an ancient race of deros (short for \"detrimental robots\") who lived in underground cities. This explanation for the world's ills, coming towards the end of World War II, struck a chord with ''Amazing'''s readership. Palmer received over 2,500 letters, instead of the usual 40 or 50, and proceeded to print a Shaver story in every issue. The June 1947 issue was given over entirely to the Shaver Mystery.<ref name=\"TTM_179-180\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;179\u2013180.</ref> From March 1948 the Shaver Mystery was dropped as a regular feature of the magazine, at Ziff's insistence. Palmer left the following year, and Browne, his successor, \"was determined to make sure that the lunatics were no longer in charge of the asylum\", in the words of science fiction historian Mike Ashley.<ref name=\"TTM_184-185\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;184\u2013185.</ref>\n\nBrowne had acquired some good-quality material in the process of planning the launch of a new slick version of ''Amazing'', and when the plan was abandoned this material appeared in the continuing pulp version. This included \"Operation RSVP\" by [[H. Beam Piper]], and \"[[Satisfaction Guaranteed (short story)|Satisfaction Guaranteed]]\" by Isaac Asimov. Despite the cancellation of the planned change to a slick format, news had reached the writing community of ''Amazing'''s new approach, and Browne began to receive much better material than Palmer had been able to publish. The existing stable of ''Amazing'' writers, such as [[Rog Phillips]] and [[Chester S. Geier]], were replaced by writers such as [[Fritz Leiber]], [[Fredric Brown]], and [[Clifford D. Simak]]. Browne also discovered several writers who went on to success in the field, publishing first stories by [[Walter M. Miller]], [[Mack Reynolds]], [[John Jakes]], [[Milton Lesser]] and [[Charles Beaumont]], all within nine months in late 1950 and early 1951.<ref name=\"TTM_225\">Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;225.</ref> Browne was disappointed by the cancellation of the planned slick version, however, and to some extent reverted to Palmer's policy of publishing sensational fiction. In 1952, for example, he serialized the anonymous ''Master of the Universe'', which purported to be a history of the future from 1975 to 2575.<ref name=\"TTM_48-49\" />\n\nWith the change to digest size in 1953, Browne once again attempted to use higher-quality fiction. The first digest issue, dated April\u2013May 1953, included stories by [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Robert A. Heinlein|Robert Heinlein]], [[Richard Matheson]], [[Theodore Sturgeon]], and [[Murray Leinster]]. Further well-regarded stories appeared over the course of 1953, including [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s \"[[Encounter in the Dawn]]\", and [[Henry Kuttner]]'s \"Or Else\".<ref name=\"TTM_50\"/> Subsequent budget cuts meant that Browne was unable to sustain this level.<ref name=\"TTM_50-51\"/> As in the 1940s, ''Amazing'' gained a stable of writers who appeared frequently, though this time the quality of the writers was rather higher\u2014it included [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Robert Silverberg]], and [[Randall Garrett]]\u2014and the regular writers were not appearing only in Ziff-Davis magazines. This remained the situation after Browne's departure in 1956 and through Paul Fairman's tenure.<ref name=\"T_222-226\" />\n\n===Cele Goldsmith===\n[[Cele Goldsmith Lalli|Cele Goldsmith]]'s tenure as editor began with the opportunity to showcase two very well-established writers: [[E.E. Smith]] and Isaac Asimov. Smith's ''The Galaxy Primes'' began serialization in March 1959. Asimov's first published story, \"[[Marooned off Vesta]]\", had appeared in the March 1939 issue of ''Amazing'', and Goldsmith reprinted it in March 1959 along with a sequel and Asimov's comments on the story. She soon began to publish some of the better new writers. [[Cordwainer Smith]]'s \"Golden the Ship Was\u2014Oh! Oh! Oh!\" appeared in April; and by the middle of the following year she had managed to attract stories from [[Robert Sheckley]], [[Alan E. Nourse]], [[Fritz Leiber]], [[Gordon R. Dickson]], [[Robert Bloch]], and [[James Blish]]. The changes she made were enough to bring Robert Heinlein back as a subscriber; Heinlein read a copy of the June 1961 issue, which, he said, \"... caused me to think I had been missing something.\"<ref name=\"T_222-223\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;222\u2013223. The quote is from an unpublished letter from Heinlein to Goldsmith, quoted by Ashley.</ref>\n\n[[Image:amazing stories 196103.jpg|thumb|upright|left|March 1961 issue, featuring [[James Blish]]'s \"A Dusk of Idols\"]]\nIn September 1960 ''Amazing'' began to carry [[Sam Moskowitz]]'s series of author profiles, which had begun in ''Fantastic'', the sister magazine. The following month the cover and logo were redesigned. In April 1961, the 35th anniversary of the first issue, Goldsmith ran several reprints, including stories by [[Ray Bradbury]] and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]].<ref name=\"T_222-226\" /> Goldsmith had little previous experience with science fiction, and bought what she liked, rather than trying to conform to a notion of what science fiction should be. The result was the debut of more significant writers in her magazines than anywhere else at that time. She published the first stories of [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], [[Roger Zelazny]], [[Piers Anthony]] and [[Thomas M. Disch]], among many others. Award-winning stories published during Goldsmith's editorship include Zelazny's \"[[He Who Shapes]]\", a story about the use of dream therapy to cure phobias. It was serialized in the January and February 1965 issues, and won a [[Nebula Award]], an annual award voted on by science fiction writers. Goldsmith often wrote long, helpful letters to her authors: Zelazny commented in a letter to her that \"Most of anything I have learned was stimulated by those first sales, and then I learned, and possibly even learned more, from some of the later rejections\". Disch and Le Guin have also acknowledged the influence Goldsmith had on their early careers.<ref name=\"T_224-225\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;224\u2013225. The quote from Zelazny is from a personal letter from Zelazny to Cele Lalli (Goldsmith), dated March 20, 1965, quoted in Ashley p.&nbsp;225.</ref>\n\nThe cover art for ''Amazing'' had been largely supplied by [[Ed Valigursky]] during the late fifties, but during the early sixties a much wider variety of artists appeared, including [[Alex Schomburg]], [[Leo Summers]] and [[Ed Emshwiller]]. Frank Paul, who had painted all the covers for the first few years of ''Amazing'', contributed a wraparound cover for the April 1961 35th anniversary issue; this was his last cover art for a science fiction magazine.<ref name=\"T_222-226\" />\n\nGoldsmith's open-minded approach meant that ''Amazing'' and ''Fantastic'' published some writers who did not fit into the other magazines. [[Philip K. Dick]]'s sales to magazines had dropped, but his work began to appear in ''Amazing'', and Goldsmith also regularly published [[David R. Bunch]]'s stories of Moderan, a world whose inhabitants were part human and part metal. Bunch, whose stories were \"bewildering, exotic word pictures\" according to Mike Ashley, had been unable to sell regularly elsewhere.<ref name=\"T_222-226\" />\n\n===Reprint era and Ted White===\n[[Image:Annual circulation of Amazing Stories.gif|thumb|300px|right|Annual circulation from 1960 to 1993]]\nWhen Sol Cohen bought both ''Amazing'' and ''Fantastic'' in early 1965, he decided to maximize profits by filling the magazines almost entirely with reprints. Cohen had acquired second serial rights from Ziff-Davis to all stories that had been printed in both magazines, and also in the companion magazines such as ''Fantastic Adventures''. Joseph Wrzos, the new editor, persuaded Cohen that at least one new story should appear in each issue; there was sufficient inventory left over from Goldsmith's tenure for this to be done without acquiring new material. Readers initially approved of the policy, since it made available some well-loved stories from earlier decades that had not been reprinted elsewhere.<ref name=\"T_263-264\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;263\u2013264.</ref> Both of Wrzos's successors, Harry Harrison and Barry Malzberg, were unable to persuade Cohen to use more new fiction.<ref name=\"T_266-267\">Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;266\u2013267.</ref>\n\nWhen Ted White took over, it was on condition that the reprints be phased out. This took some time: for a while both ''Amazing'' and ''Fantastic'' continued to include one reprint every issue; with the May 1972 issue the transformation was complete, and all stories were new. As well as eliminating the reprints, White reintroduced features such as a letter column and  \"The Clubhouse,\" a [[fanzine]] review and fannish news column. He continued the book review column, and a series of science articles by [[Gregory Benford]] and [[David Book]]. White also redesigned the look of the magazine, making it, in sf historian Mike Ashley's words, \"far more modern and sophisticated\".<ref name=\"GTF_70-74\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', pp.&nbsp;70\u201374.</ref>\n\nWhite was willing to print a variety of fiction, mixing traditional stories with more experimental material that was influenced by the British [[New Wave (science fiction)|New Wave]] or by 1960s [[Psychedelic art|psychedelia]]. In 1971 he serialized [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''The Lathe of Heaven'', about a man whose dreams can modify reality. One writer influenced by this was [[James Tiptree, Jr.]], who later wrote that \"after first plowing into the first pulpy pages of the 1971 ''Amazing'' in which ''Lathe'' came out, my toe-nails began to curl under and my spine hair stood up.\"<ref name=\"GTF_74-76\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', pp.&nbsp;74\u201376. The quote is from ''Universe SF Review'', September/October 1975, quoted by Ashley on p.&nbsp;76.</ref> White's willingness to experiment led to ''Amazing'' running more stories with sexual content than other magazines. One such story, White's own \"Growing Up Fast in the City\", was criticized as pornographic by some of ''Amazing'''s readers. Other stories, such as Rich Brown's \"Two of a Kind\", about the violent rape of a black woman and the subsequent death of her rapists, also led to controversy. White printed more conventional fiction as well, much of it high quality. The magazine was nominated for the [[Hugo award]] (a readers' award, named for Hugo Gernsback) for best editor three times during his tenure (1970, 1971 and 1972), finishing third each time.<ref name=\"GTF_82-83\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', pp.&nbsp;82\u201383.</ref>\n\nWhite's ability to attract new writers suffered because of the low rates he paid: one cent per word, as compared to three or five cents per word at the leading competitive magazines. To compensate, White cultivated new writers whose experimental work was not selling elsewhere. He made a deal in 1971 with [[Gordon Eklund]], who was hesitating to become a full-time writer because of the financial risks. White agreed to buy anything Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed it was a good story. The result was that much of Eklund's fiction appeared in ''Amazing'' and ''Fantastic'' over the next few years.<ref name=\"GTF_78-79\">Ashley, ''Gateways'', pp.&nbsp;78\u201379.</ref>\n\n''Amazing'''s reputation had been for formulaic science fiction almost since it began, but White was able to take the magazine to a higher standard than any other editor except Cele Goldsmith,<ref name=\"NESF_16\">Gunn, ''New Encyclopedia'', p.&nbsp;16.</ref> and gave ''Amazing'' a respected position in the field.<ref name=\"NESF_503\">Gunn, ''New Encyclopedia'', p.&nbsp;503.</ref> His successors were not able to maintain the same level of quality.<ref name=\"NESF_16\" />\n\n===After Ted White===\nWhen Elinor Mavor took over, in early 1979, she had no experience with science fiction magazines, and was unaware of the history of bad feeling within the science fiction community about the poor payments for reprinted stories. She was given an extremely limited budget to work with, and had few stories on hand to work with initially, and as a result her first issues contained several reprints. Mavor experimented in her first year with some new ideas, such as starting a story on the back cover in order to hook readers into buying the magazine to finish the story. She also began a serial story in graphic format that used reader input to continue its plot. It was not a success and \"thankfully\", according to Mike Ashley, the experiment was terminated after only three episodes.<ref name=\"GTF_348-355\" />\n\nOver time Mavor was to some extent able to reverse the negative perceptions of ''Amazing'' among established authors, but she was initially forced to work primarily with newer writers. Early discoveries of hers include [[Michael P. Kube-McDowell]], [[John E. Stith]] and [[Richard Paul Russo]]. In a notice published in her first issue, she asked readers for help in assembling news, reviews and fan information, and soon added columns that covered these areas. In 1981 [[Robert Silverberg]] began a series of opinion columns. The artwork was of high quality, including work by [[Stephen Fabian]], and later by [[David Burroughs Mattingly|David Mattingly]].<ref name=\"GTF_348-355\" />\n\nAfter the merger with ''Fantastic'', Mavor continued to draw well-known writers to the magazine, including [[Orson Scott Card]], [[George R. R. Martin]], and [[Roger Zelazny]]. [[Brad Linaweaver]]'s ''Moon of Ice'', which appeared in March 1982, was nominated for a [[Nebula award]]; Martin's ''Unsound Variations'', which had appeared the issue before, was nominated for both a Nebula and a Hugo award.<ref name=\"GTF_348-355\" />\n\nHistorian [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]]'s assessment of ''Amazing'' in the 1980s is that Mavor, Scithers and Price, who between them edited ''Amazing'' for a decade, were unable to sustain the standards established by Ted White in the 1970s.<ref name=\"NESF_16\" /> [[Brian Stableford]], by contrast, comments that both Scithers and Price made efforts to publish good material, and that the packaging, from 1991 onwards, was perhaps the best presented of any science fiction magazine.<ref name=\"ESF_25\" />\n\nWith the Wizards of the Coast relaunch in 1998 the contents, under editor Kim Mohan, became more media-focused. The initial plan was to have two or three stories per issue based on films, TV, and games.<ref name=\"Locus_Summer1998\" /><ref name=\"Locus_1998\">{{cite web | url = http://www.locusmag.com/1998/News/News01.html | title = Locus Online: SF News January 1998 | accessdate= September 20, 2008|publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> The 600th issue, in early 2000, included a [[Harlan Ellison]] story, as well as a story from the 100th issue, the 200th issue, and so on, up to the 500th issue.

Several well-known authors appeared in the first issue, including Harlan Ellison, [[Bruce Sterling]], and [[Gene Wolfe]]. Paizo also ran a [[blog]] for the magazine.<ref name=\"Locus_Aug2004\">{{cite web | url = http://www.locusmag.com/2004/Monitor/Magazines08a.html | title = Locus Online: New Magazines|date= August 2004|page= 1 | accessdate= September 22, 2008|publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref><ref name=\"Paizo_blog\">{{cite web | url = http://paizo.com/amazing/blog | title = Paizo Amazing blog | accessdate = October 22, 2006 | publisher = Paizo Publishing | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061209103804/http://paizo.com/amazing/blog | archivedate = December 9, 2006 }}</ref> The fiction received positive reviews,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.locusmag.com/2004/Monitor/Magazines11b.html | title = Locus Online: New Magazines|date= November 2004|page= 2 | accessdate= September 22, 2008|publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> but Paizo soon put the magazine on temporary hold, and canceled it permanently the following year.<ref name=\"Paizo\" />  The title remained in limbo until Steve Davidson's online version appeared in 2012.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://granitegeek.concordmonitor.com/2015/11/06/push-to-push-to-resurrect-amazing-stores-the-iconic-science-fiction-magazine-gets-a-tv-boost/|title=Push to resurrect Amazing Stories|first= David|last=Brooks|publisher=Granite Geek|date=November 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Influence on the field===\n''Amazing Stories'' was influential simply by being the first of its kind. In the words of science fiction writer and critic [[Damon Knight]], the magazine was \"a snag in the stream of history, from which a V-shape spread out in dozens and then in hundreds of altered lives\".<ref name=\"DKTF_2\">Knight, ''Futurians'', p.&nbsp;2.</ref> Many early fans of the field began to communicate with each other through the letter column, and to publish [[fanzine]]s\u2014amateur fan publications that helped establish connections among fans across the country. Many of these fans in turn became successful writers; and the existence of an organized science fiction fandom, and of writers such as [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and Isaac Asimov, who came to writing directly from fandom, can be dated to the creation of ''Amazing Stories''.<ref name=\"DKTF_2\"/> After the first few years, when there was little or no competition, ''Amazing Stories'' never again led the field in the eyes of critics or fans. Despite its long history, the magazine rarely contributed much to science fiction beyond the initial creation of the genre,<ref name=\"ATYS_205\">Aldiss, ''Trillion Year Spree'', p.&nbsp;205.</ref> though Gernsback himself is commemorated in the name ''Hugo'', which is the almost universally used term for the [[World Science Fiction Society]]'s annually presented [[Science Fiction Achievement Award]]s.<ref name=\"FDV_3\">Franson and DeVore, \"History\", p.&nbsp;3.</ref><ref name=\"ESF_Hugo\">Nicholls, Peter, \"Hugo\", in Clute & Nicholls, ''Hugo'', p.&nbsp;595.</ref> Gernsback has also been called the \"Father of Science Fiction\" for his role in creating ''Amazing Stories''.<ref name=\"Father\">See, for example, the titles of Moskowitz, ''Hugo Gernsback: Father of Science Fiction'', and Siegel, ''Hugo Gernsback: Father of Modern Science Fiction''.</ref>\n\n==Publication details==\n\n===Editors===\nBibliographers do not always agree who should be listed as editor of any given issue of ''Amazing''. For example, Gernsback was in control for the first three years, but Sloane performed all the editorial duties related to fiction, and he is sometimes described as the editor. Similarly, later editors were sometimes under the supervision of editorial directors. Bernard Davis held the title of \"Editor\" of all Ziff-Davis magazines when at that company, with the actual editing of the magazines done by respective \"Managing Editors\".The table below, and the charts above, generally follow the mastheads in the magazines, with short notes added. More details are given in the publishing history section, above, which focuses on when the editors involved actually obtained control of the magazine contents, instead of when their names appeared on the masthead.\n* [[Hugo Gernsback]] (April 1926 \u2013 April 1929). Sloane performed almost all the editorial duties related to fiction.<ref name=\"TTM_48-49\" />\n* Arthur Lynch (May 1929 \u2013 October 1929).

Fairman actually took over editorial duties with the May or June 1956 issue.<ref name=\"AMZ_56_5-7\">Fairman began writing the editorials with the May 1956 issue, and in the July 1956 editorial he explained that Browne was on a two-month contract in Hollywood, writing scripts for ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]''. In the August editorial he announced that the change was permanent, and in the September 1956 issue Fairman was listed as editor on the masthead for the first time.

When she married she used her married name of Cele Lalli.<ref name=\"T_222_E\">Lobsenz was introduced in the November 1958 editorial, as if he were the editor. His title was editorial director. According to Mike Ashley, who corresponded with Cele Lalli, he was brought in as a consultant, wrote the editorials and story blurbs, met intermittently with Goldsmith, and read the stories she selected, but \"she was soon left alone to edit the magazines as she saw fit\".

Legend of the Phantosaur|author=|date=|work=amazon.com}}</ref> It premiered on Cartoon Network on September 3, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Mystery Inc. gang travels to a remote town to stay at the La Serena Spa in New Mexico, to relax Shaggy after a scary experience in a haunted mansion left him screaming for a few hours afterward. There, they meet Mr. Hubley, who works at the spa. When Shaggy asks if there is anything to eat, Hubley says no, but there is a barbecue in town.\n\nThe gang goes to the barbecue, and all but Shaggy and Scooby-Doo go off to see the paleontological dig of Professor Svankmajer. Shaggy and Scooby are too full to walk right away. When they set out, a [[gila monster]] steals a biscuit from them, causing Scooby to go after it. He meets the Phantosaur (described as somewhat resembling an ''[[Appalachiosaurus]]'' by Professor Svankmajer) and runs away. Later, Shaggy and Scooby are chased by the Phantosaur and narrowly escape.\n\nMeanwhile, Professor Svankmajor shows the rest of the gang over the dig, and Velma meets Svankmajor's student, Winsor. She instantly sees him as a soul mate and they plan to go out on a date, to which Fred replies to Daphne, \"On our own for clue searching then.\"\n\nBack at the spa, Shaggy is in terrible shape after a fright. Mr. Hubley helps with aromatherapy, assisted by Scooby-Doo adding a Scooby Snack to the aromas. Shaggy becomes more calm, but freaks out again when Mr. Hubley tells them the legend of the Phantosaur, the ghost of a predatory dinosaur. The legend says the Phantosaur was summoned by Native Americans to drive out Spanish conquistadors, but it turned on them instead.\n\nHubley has an advanced hypnosis machine with a hologram projector. He hypnotizes Shaggy to become fearless and unstoppable when he heard the word \"bad,\" and to switch back to normal when he hears it again. Then he orders Shaggy to forget everything; unfortunately, Hubley himself is affected by the hypnosis and he can't remember the key word for Shaggy.\n\nDaphne, Fred, and Velma go back to the dig to look for clues, but Velma is so love struck that she's not much use. She misses an obvious clue about many footprints going to a part of the cave where Winsor says they never go because of the snakes that lurk in the lower cave levels.\n\nMeanwhile, Scooby and Shaggy go to an all-you-can-eat restaurant and start to eat it out of business. Then a biker gang comes in. Shaggy accidentally squirts the contents of a [[hot dog bun]] on one of the bikers, who angrily grabs him and tells him, \"Little buddy, this is gonna be bad.\" Suddenly, Shaggy is fearless. He knocks out the whole motorcycle gang and repels all their assaults on him. Then the gang leader, a large, muscly man named Tex, arrives and, taking an admitted liking to Shaggy, challenges him to a motorcycle race on Dead Man's curve. Shaggy confidently accepts, even though he's never ridden a motorcycle before. As Tex leaves the restaurant, he tells Shaggy that he won't kill Shaggy \"too bad.\". Suddenly back to normal, Shaggy is terrified of the challenge he has just accepted, and by what he has just done to the rest of the gang.\n\nThat night, Daphne decides to give him motorcycling lessons, because she drove a motorcycle when she was five. Shaggy and Tex have their motorcycle race as planned, and Shaggy hears \"bad\" just in time and almost wins, until a Phantosaur shows up and he thinks in his mind that the monster must think it's so \"bad,\" which is enough to make him cowardly again and get chased, but still miraculously wins the race.\n\nEventually, they figure out that there were two phantosaurs and they were robots. The culprits were two mining engineers who wanted the silver they found in the area, which they couldn't get to because of the paleontologists.\n\nOnce back at Hubley's they find the hologram projector gone and they get attacked by a pack of ''[[Velociraptor]]'' and a ghostly fire-breathing ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. They learn that it was Professor Svankmajer and Winsor, much to Velma's dismay. They had found a complete ''[[Allosaurus]]'' encased in quartz crystal, a beautiful and priceless find, and they wanted to keep it for themselves. They wanted to scare everyone off so they could dig it out and take it away. They disguised three other graduate students in velociraptor costumes, and created an original red Phantosaur with an advanced holographic projector (stolen from Hubley's hypnotism room) and paint-stripper devices that blasted super-heated air for the fire effects.\n\nWhile they are underground, the dynamite charges Svankmajor set to blast free the dinosaur crystal go off (because Daphne left a paint-stripper on and the heat lit the fuses). Shaggy's hypnotic bravery comes in again when Svankmejer comments on how \"bad\" the lower caverns are, and he flawlessly leads them toward the exit until Daphne praises him that he's \"not bad.\"  Scooby realizes the keyword but is unable to tell the rest of the gang (who misunderstand his \"rad\" as other words). Shaggy has to complete the rest of the escape on sheer guts, and with some help from Tex and his biker friends. The remorseful Svankmajer and Winsor are arrested, but Velma says she will date Winsor again when he gets out of jail, which he happily agrees with.\n\nThey then go back to La Serena Spa and Mr. Hubley tries to un-hypnotize Shaggy, but accidentally makes the entire gang turn into him. The end of the movie shows them driving away in the \"Mustard\" Machine. A post-credits scene reveals the \"Mustard\" Machine wearing a wig that looks like Shaggy's hairstyle. The GPS inside the van says aloud that if it had hands, it would remove the wig, but as such, it has none.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Frank Welker]] as [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]], [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]] and misc. bikers\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as [[Shaggy Rogers]] and Shaky Joe\n* [[Mindy Cohn]] as [[Velma Dinkley]]\n* [[Grey DeLisle]] as [[Daphne Blake]]\n* [[Cathy Cavadini]] as Faith\n* [[John DiMaggio]] as Fritz, GPS and misc. bikers\n* [[Michael Gough (voice actor)|Michael Gough]] as Mr. Babbit, Blair, Grad Student #1 and misc. bikers\n* [[Matthew Gray Gubler]] as Winsor\n* [[Finola Hughes]] as Professor Svankmajer\n* [[Maulik Pancholy]] as Doctor\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] as Tex, Cop #2, Grad Student #3 and misc. bikers\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Mr. Hubley\n* [[Dave Wittenberg]] as Cop #1, Grad Student #2, Policeman and misc. bikers\n* [[Gwendoline Yeo]] as Ms. Fetich\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|1777608}}\n\n{{Scooby-Doo}}\n{{Warner Bros. animation and comics}}\n\n[[Category:2011 television films]]\n[[Category:2011 animated films]]\n[[Category:2011 films]]\n[[Category:Scooby-Doo direct-to-video animated films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:2010s American animated films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ethan Spaulding]]\n[[Category:American children's animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:Internet memes introduced in 2017]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Scooby-Doo!

She instantly sees him as a soul mate and they plan to go out on a date, to which Fred replies to Daphne, \"On our own for clue searching then.\"\n\nBack at the spa, Shaggy is in terrible shape after a fright. Mr. Hubley helps with aromatherapy, assisted by Scooby-Doo adding a Scooby Snack to the aromas. Shaggy becomes more calm, but freaks out again when Mr. Hubley tells them the legend of the Phantosaur, the ghost of a predatory dinosaur. The legend says the Phantosaur was summoned by Native Americans to drive out Spanish conquistadors, but it turned on them instead.\n\nHubley has an advanced hypnosis machine with a hologram projector. He hypnotizes Shaggy to become fearless and unstoppable when he heard the word \"bad,\" and to switch back to normal when he hears it again. Then he orders Shaggy to forget everything; unfortunately, Hubley himself is affected by the hypnosis and he can't remember the key word for Shaggy.\n\nDaphne, Fred, and Velma go back to the dig to look for clues, but Velma is so love struck that she's not much use. She misses an obvious clue about many footprints going to a part of the cave where Winsor says they never go because of the snakes that lurk in the lower cave levels.\n\nMeanwhile, Scooby and Shaggy go to an all-you-can-eat restaurant and start to eat it out of business. Then a biker gang comes in. Shaggy accidentally squirts the contents of a [[hot dog bun]] on one of the bikers, who angrily grabs him and tells him, \"Little buddy, this is gonna be bad.\" Suddenly, Shaggy is fearless. He knocks out the whole motorcycle gang and repels all their assaults on him. Then the gang leader, a large, muscly man named Tex, arrives and, taking an admitted liking to Shaggy, challenges him to a motorcycle race on Dead Man's curve. Shaggy confidently accepts, even though he's never ridden a motorcycle before. As Tex leaves the restaurant, he tells Shaggy that he won't kill Shaggy \"too bad.\". Suddenly back to normal, Shaggy is terrified of the challenge he has just accepted, and by what he has just done to the rest of the gang.\n\nThat night, Daphne decides to give him motorcycling lessons, because she drove a motorcycle when she was five. Shaggy and Tex have their motorcycle race as planned, and Shaggy hears \"bad\" just in time and almost wins, until a Phantosaur shows up and he thinks in his mind that the monster must think it's so \"bad,\" which is enough to make him cowardly again and get chased, but still miraculously wins the race.\n\nEventually, they figure out that there were two phantosaurs and they were robots. The culprits were two mining engineers who wanted the silver they found in the area, which they couldn't get to because of the paleontologists.\n\nOnce back at Hubley's they find the hologram projector gone and they get attacked by a pack of ''[[Velociraptor]]'' and a ghostly fire-breathing ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. They learn that it was Professor Svankmajer and Winsor, much to Velma's dismay. They had found a complete ''[[Allosaurus]]'' encased in quartz crystal, a beautiful and priceless find, and they wanted to keep it for themselves. They wanted to scare everyone off so they could dig it out and take it away. They disguised three other graduate students in velociraptor costumes, and created an original red Phantosaur with an advanced holographic projector (stolen from Hubley's hypnotism room) and paint-stripper devices that blasted super-heated air for the fire effects.\n\nWhile they are underground, the dynamite charges Svankmajor set to blast free the dinosaur crystal go off (because Daphne left a paint-stripper on and the heat lit the fuses). Shaggy's hypnotic bravery comes in again when Svankmejer comments on how \"bad\" the lower caverns are, and he flawlessly leads them toward the exit until Daphne praises him that he's \"not bad.\"  Scooby realizes the keyword but is unable to tell the rest of the gang (who misunderstand his \"rad\" as other words). Shaggy has to complete the rest of the escape on sheer guts, and with some help from Tex and his biker friends. The remorseful Svankmajer and Winsor are arrested, but Velma says she will date Winsor again when he gets out of jail, which he happily agrees with.\n\nThey then go back to La Serena Spa and Mr. Hubley tries to un-hypnotize Shaggy, but accidentally makes the entire gang turn into him. The end of the movie shows them driving away in the \"Mustard\" Machine. A post-credits scene reveals the \"Mustard\" Machine wearing a wig that looks like Shaggy's hairstyle. The GPS inside the van says aloud that if it had hands, it would remove the wig, but as such, it has none.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Frank Welker]] as [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]], [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]] and misc. bikers\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as [[Shaggy Rogers]] and Shaky Joe\n* [[Mindy Cohn]] as [[Velma Dinkley]]\n* [[Grey DeLisle]] as [[Daphne Blake]]\n* [[Cathy Cavadini]] as Faith\n* [[John DiMaggio]] as Fritz, GPS and misc. bikers\n* [[Michael Gough (voice actor)|Michael Gough]] as Mr. Babbit, Blair, Grad Student #1 and misc. bikers\n* [[Matthew Gray Gubler]] as Winsor\n* [[Finola Hughes]] as Professor Svankmajer\n* [[Maulik Pancholy]] as Doctor\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] as Tex, Cop #2, Grad Student #3 and misc. bikers\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Mr. Hubley\n* [[Dave Wittenberg]] as Cop #1, Grad Student #2, Policeman and misc. bikers\n* [[Gwendoline Yeo]] as Ms. Fetich\n\n==Ultra Instinct Shaggy meme==\nOn October 12, 2017, a [[YouTube]] user named \"Midya\" created a video featuring Shaggy fighting a biker gang in the film called \"Ultra Instinct Shaggy\" using the Ky\u016bkyoku no Battle theme from the ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' anime and slow-motion to make the character seem as if he were in the Ultra Instinct form (a powered up state in the Dragon Ball series where the user can react to attacks almost instinctively). The video earned millions of views and spawned the \"Ultra Instinct Shaggy\" meme depicting Shaggy Rogers as an omnipotent power, with subsequent fan art showing him beating other fictional characters such as [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Thanos]] and [[Goku]] from the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' franchise, as well as using still images and footage of the behind the scenes look at the [[Scooby-Doo (film)|2002 ''Scooby-Doo'' film]] with fake subtitles to make it seem as if Shaggy is a powerful being.\n\nAt the same time as the meme gained popularity in January 2019, the then-upcoming video game ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]'' was being marketed and thus a petition was made on [[Change.org]] by Woken News Network to include the character as [[Downloadable content|DLC]]. The petition received hundreds of thousands of signatures even gaining attention of ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' co-creator [[Ed Boon]], and Shaggy's voice actor [[Matthew Lillard]]. Lillard had previously tweeted posts and retweeted fan art in support of the idea as well as Boon jokingly petitioning to get [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby Doo]] into another [[NetherRealm Studios]] game ''[[Injustice 2]]''. It was later confirmed that Shaggy would never appear in any Mortal Kombat game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/28/18201001/powerful-shaggy-meme-timeline-explained|title=What is the Ultra Instinct Shaggy meme?: an investigation|last=Radulovic|first=Petrana|work=Polygon|date=January 29, 2019|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://gamerant.com/mortal-kombat-11-shaggy-ed-boon-response/|title=Mortal Kombat 11 Director Ed Boon Responds to Shaggy Petition|last=Cooper|first=Dalton|work=Game Rant|date=January 28, 2019|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://comicbook.com/gaming/01/30/-mortal-kombat-11-producer-scooby-doo-injustice-2-petition/|title='Mortal Kombat 11's' Ed Boon Has Fun With Shaggy Rumours, Suggests New Character for 'Injustice 2'|last=Workman|first=Robert|work=Comicbook.com|date=January 30, 2010|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/andyneuenschwander/|title=This \"Powerful Shaggy\" Meme Is So Damn Funny That Now Matthew Lillard Is On Board|last=Golder|first=Andy|work=[[Buzzfeed News]]|date=January 30, 2019|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://screenrant.com/mortal-kombat-shaggy-ed-boon/|title=Mortal Kombat 11 Co-Creator Fuels Fire of Shaggy Meme|last=Burks|first=Robin|work=Screen Rant|date=February 1, 2019|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/petition-add-shaggy-mortal-kombat-11-got-300000-signatures-counting|title=Petition to Add Shaggy to Mortal Kombat 11 Hits 300,000 Signatures|last=James|first=David|work=We Got This Covered|date=February 3, 2019|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|1777608}}\n\n{{Scooby-Doo}}\n{{Warner Bros. animation and comics}}\n\n[[Category:2011 television films]]\n[[Category:2011 animated films]]\n[[Category:2011 films]]\n[[Category:Scooby-Doo direct-to-video animated films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:2010s American animated films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ethan Spaulding]]\n[[Category:American children's animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:Internet memes introduced in 2017]]\n", "name_user": "2600:6c50:757f:bcf1:84ad:a370:2573:96e6", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(stupid nonsense)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooby-Doo!_Legend_of_the_Phantosaur"}
{"title_page": "Awards and decorations of the United States Army", "text_new": "'''Awards and decorations of the United States Army''' are those [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|military awards including decorations]] which are issued to members of the [[United States Army]] under the authority of the [[Secretary of the Army]].  Together with [[Badges of the United States Army|military badges]] such awards provide an outward display of a service member's accomplishments.\n\nThe first recognized medals of the U.S. Army appeared during the [[American Civil War]] and were generally issued by local commanders on an unofficial basis.  The [[Medal of Honor]] was the first award to be established in regulations as a permanent Army decoration, complete with benefits.  The Medal of Honor is the only Civil War era award which has survived as a decoration into the modern age.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. Army mandates that all unit awards will be worn separate from individual awards on the opposite side of a military uniform.  The Army is the only service to require this separation between unit and individual decorations.  All Army unit awards are worn enclosed in a [[gold frame]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Spanish\u2013American War]] was the first widespread award of [[campaign medal]]s, both for service in the actual conflict and for participation in subsequent garrison and occupation duty. After the Spanish\u2013American War, however, medals in the U.S. Army fell into disuse and, apart from a few peacetime Medal of Honor decorations, two medals for service in Mexico, or on the border, during the period 1911\u201317, plus the [[Civil War Campaign Medal]] and the [[Indian Campaign Medal]], both finally authorized in 1907, there were no further Army decorations created until the [[First World War]].\n\nWorld War I saw the first widespread distribution of medals for combat, as the Medal of Honor returned awarded for bravery in battle against an enemy force. The [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] was also created for those soldiers who had performed feats of bravery but not to the level required of the Medal of Honor. The only other medals of World War I were the [[World War I Victory Medal (United States)|World War I Victory Medal]], accompanied by a confusing array of [[battle clasps]] to denote combat participation, and the very belated [[Army of Occupation of Germany Medal]].\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the U.S. Army issued very few decorations and it was often common for a service member to spend an entire career without receiving a single medal. As [[World War II]] loomed, however, an [[American Defense Service Medal]] was created for those on duty, and a [[Good Conduct Medal (United States)|Good Conduct Medal]] began to be issued to enlisted personnel. With the outbreak of the war, the Army began the largest expansion of medals since the Spanish\u2013American War as well as the first wide scale issuance of [[Inter-service awards and decorations of the United States military|inter-service awards and decorations]]. In addition, several [[United States service medals of the World Wars|World War II campaign medals]] were created for various theaters and a [[World War II Victory Medal]] was established at the end of the conflict as well as an [[Army of Occupation Medal|occupation medal]].\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the Army expanded both its number of medals and ribbons, as well as having its service members eligible for several new inter-service campaign and [[service medal]]s (such as the [[Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal]] and the [[National Defense Service Medal]]).\n\nIn the modern age, members of other military branches serving under an Army command are also eligible to receive Army decorations. All Army service members may receive [[Inter-service awards and decorations of the United States military|inter-service awards and decorations]], [[international decoration]]s, and [[Authorized foreign decorations of the United States military|authorized foreign medals]]. The Department of the Army also awards a limited number of [[Department of the Army Civilian Awards|civilian awards]].\n\nThe current active decorations of the United States Army as follows (the [[Medal of Honor]], the highest military award, is not shown as it covers all of the military services):\n\n==United States Army decorations==\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n!

He is also a member of the [[Brotherhood of Guardians]], a [[secret society]] that defends the island and is made up of Knuckles' predecessors/ancestors. In keeping with the incorporation of elements of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|'' Sonic the Hedgehog'']] cartoon into the series, Knuckles lives on the planet Mobius. Knuckles is supported in his efforts by the [[Chaotix]], and often works together with Sonic the Hedgehog and the Freedom Fighters.\n\nWhen Knuckles was first introduced he was the lone defender of the island, but differences between this continuity and the games were quickly introduced. Writer [[Ken Penders]] built up a considerable backstory for Knuckles, in which he is abandoned by his father, Locke, as part of his Guardian training. He was later tricked by Robotnik into believing that Sonic and Tails were on their way to steal the Chaos Emerald and its powers. After a short melee, Robotnik blatantly betrayed Knuckles, causing him to join Sonic in a begrudging team-up, which eventually grew into a strong friendship.\n\nNot too long after that, he formed the Chaotix along with Vector, out of the few refugee inhabitants on Angel Island at the time and would leave the island to their care if he ever had to leave. The Chaotix at the time were Knuckles the Echidna, Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, Mighty the Armadillo, Charmy Bee, Heavy, and Bomb, but later saw the addition of Ray the Flying Squirrel, Julie-Su the Echidna (who became his love interest), and Saffron Bee (Charmy's betrothed), while Heavy and Bomb departed and later joined the King's Secret Service. Knuckles was also revealed to have a mystically significant destiny as \"the Avatar,\" corresponding to similar destinies shared by Tails and Sonic. He and Princess [[Sally Acorn]] were also revealed to be childhood friends, having met when she and her father paid a visit to the Floating Island while Knuckles' father was Guardian.\n\nAfter believing himself to be the last living Echidna for some time, Knuckles stumbled upon the existence of others; his earliest encounters with others of his people would earn him enemies. The first would be his great-uncle Dimitri, who had been possessed by a malevolent spirit and become an evil being known as Enerjak. He would then run across a cyborg army known as the Dark Legion-led by Dimitri's descendants-who had previously been banished to another dimension by one of the Knuckles' ancestors. Julie-Su started out as a member of this group but defected to join Knuckles after an Echidna sixth sense known as the Soultouch identified Knuckles as an ideal soul mate. Accompanied by Julie, Knuckles would come across others of his kind, including the city of Echidnaopolis-home to his mother after she divorced his father Locke-the Brotherhood of Guardians, and the hidden city of Albion.\n\nKnuckles' early adventures typically involved protecting Angel Island or the various Echidna groups-only rarely would he join the Freedom Fighters against threats like Dr. Robotnik. However, Robotnik's encroachments on different areas of the planet-including Angel Island itself-eventually persuaded Knuckles to relocate to the surface to join the battle against the evil doctor and other threats. One of his enemies-a villainous Echidna named Dr. Finitevus-later made Knuckles into a new Enerjak after revealing that Robotnik had driven the Echidna race to the brink of extinction. Knuckles would become wracked with guilt over his actions, especially since the remnants of the Dark Legion chose to ally themselves with Dr. Robotnik.\n\nThe final blow would come when Knuckles responded to a distress call from his people and arrived in Albion to find it deserted. This would be revealed to be the work of Thrash the Tasmanian Devil, whose people were mutated by ancient Echidnas. Thrash's actions led to almost all the remaining Echidnas being banished from Mobius, with Knuckles failing to rescue them. In reality, the disappearance of these characters-among others-was due to a lawsuit by Ken Penders.\n\nAs a result of the continuity reboot that followed the crossover with the ''[[Mega Man]]'' franchise, Knuckles became virtually indistinguishable from his video game counterpart: he is the last known Echidna and the last Guardian of Master Emerald, and the Chaotix no longer serve as his full-time support team.\n\n===In animation===\nKnuckles' animation debut came with the 1996 Japanese ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[original video animation|OVA]]. Sonic and Tails meet him in an alternate dimension, and over the course of the film he helps them defeat Black Eggman/Metal Robotnik and [[Metal Sonic|Hyper Metal Sonic]], two robots created by Eggman/Robotnik. As Metal is about to descend into a lava pit, Sonic attempts to save him after all, but Knuckles holds him back and Sonic is disappointed. Knuckles play-fights with Sonic a few times in the film as well.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie]]|year=1999|publisher=[[ADV Films]]|medium=DVD}}</ref>\n\nKnuckles is a minor character in ''[[Sonic Underground]]''.

He takes guarding Master Emerald seriously and has a fearsome temper with a \"chip on his shoulder\".

He is also a member of the [[Brotherhood of Guardians]], a [[secret society]] that defends the island and is made up of Knuckles' predecessors/ancestors. In keeping with the incorporation of elements of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|'' Sonic the Hedgehog'']] cartoon into the series, Knuckles lives on the planet Mobius. Knuckles is supported in his efforts by the [[Chaotix]], and often works together with Sonic the Hedgehog and the Freedom Fighters.\n\nWhen Knuckles was first introduced he was the lone defender of the island, but differences between this continuity and the games were quickly introduced. Writer [[Ken Penders]] built up a considerable backstory for Knuckles, in which he is abandoned by his father, Locke, as part of his Guardian training. He was later tricked by Robotnik into believing that Sonic and Tails were on their way to steal the Chaos Emerald and its powers. After a short melee, Robotnik blatantly betrayed Knuckles, causing him to join Sonic in a begrudging team-up, which eventually grew into a strong friendship.\n\nNot too long after that, he formed the Chaotix along with Vector, out of the few refugee inhabitants on Angel Island at the time and would leave the island to their care if he ever had to leave. The Chaotix at the time were Knuckles the Echidna, Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, Mighty the Armadillo, Charmy Bee, Heavy, and Bomb, but later saw the addition of Ray the Flying Squirrel, Julie-Su the Echidna (who became his love interest), and Saffron Bee (Charmy's betrothed), while Heavy and Bomb departed and later joined the King's Secret Service. Knuckles was also revealed to have a mystically significant destiny as \"the Avatar,\" corresponding to similar destinies shared by Tails and Sonic. He and Princess [[Sally Acorn]] were also revealed to be childhood friends, having met when she and her father paid a visit to the Floating Island while Knuckles' father was Guardian.\n\nAfter believing himself to be the last living Echidna for some time, Knuckles stumbled upon the existence of others; his earliest encounters with others of his people would earn him enemies. The first would be his great-uncle Dimitri, who had been possessed by a malevolent spirit and become an evil being known as Enerjak. He would then run across a cyborg army known as the Dark Legion-led by Dimitri's descendants-who had previously been banished to another dimension by one of the Knuckles' ancestors. Julie-Su started out as a member of this group but defected to join Knuckles after an Echidna sixth sense known as the Soultouch identified Knuckles as an ideal soul mate. Accompanied by Julie, Knuckles would come across others of his kind, including the city of Echidnaopolis-home to his mother after she divorced his father Locke-the Brotherhood of Guardians, and the hidden city of Albion.\n\nKnuckles' early adventures typically involved protecting Angel Island or the various Echidna groups-only rarely would he join the Freedom Fighters against threats like Dr. Robotnik. However, Robotnik's encroachments on different areas of the planet-including Angel Island itself-eventually persuaded Knuckles to relocate to the surface to join the battle against the evil doctor and other threats. One of his enemies-a villainous Echidna named Dr. Finitevus-later made Knuckles into a new Enerjak after revealing that Robotnik had driven the Echidna race to the brink of extinction. Knuckles would become wracked with guilt over his actions, especially since the remnants of the Dark Legion chose to ally themselves with Dr. Robotnik.\n\nThe final blow would come when Knuckles responded to a distress call from his people and arrived in Albion to find it deserted. This would be revealed to be the work of Thrash the Tasmanian Devil, whose people were mutated by ancient Echidnas. Thrash's actions led to almost all the remaining Echidnas being banished from Mobius, with Knuckles failing to rescue them. In reality, the disappearance of these characters-among others-was due to a lawsuit by Ken Penders.\n\nAs a result of the continuity reboot that followed the crossover with the ''[[Mega Man]]'' franchise, Knuckles became virtually indistinguishable from his video game counterpart: he is the last known Echidna and the last Guardian of Master Emerald, and the Chaotix no longer serve as his full-time support team.\n\n===In animation===\nKnuckles' animation debut came with the 1996 Japanese ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[original video animation|OVA]]. Sonic and Tails meet him in an alternate dimension, and over the course of the film he helps them defeat Black Eggman/Metal Robotnik and [[Metal Sonic|Hyper Metal Sonic]], two robots created by Eggman/Robotnik. As Metal is about to descend into a lava pit, Sonic attempts to save him after all, but Knuckles holds him back and Sonic is disappointed. Knuckles play-fights with Sonic a few times in the film as well.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie]]|year=1999|publisher=[[ADV Films]]|medium=DVD}}</ref>\n\nKnuckles is a minor character in ''[[Sonic Underground]]''.

G. Wells' The War of the Worlds''''') is a 1953 American [[science fiction film]] from [[Paramount Pictures]], produced by [[George Pal]], directed by [[Byron Haskin]], and starring [[Gene Barry]] and [[Ann Robinson]].\n\nThe film is a loose adaptation of the [[The War of the Worlds|novel of the same name]] by [[H. G. Wells]], the first of five film adaptations. It is a modern retelling of the 1897 novel, changing the setting from [[Victorian era]]-[[England]] to 1953 southern [[California]]. Earth is suddenly and unexpectedly invaded by [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martians]], and American scientist [[Doctor Clayton Forrester (War of the Worlds)|Clayton Forrester]] searches for any weakness that can stop them.\n\n''The War of the Worlds'' won an [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and went on to influence other science fiction films. In 2011, it was selected for preservation in the United States' [[National Film Registry]] in the [[Library of Congress]], being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn southern [[California]], [[Doctor Clayton Forrester (War of the Worlds)|Dr. Clayton Forrester]], a well-known atomic scientist, is fishing with colleagues when a large object crashes near the town of [[Linda Rosa, California|Linda Rosa]]. At the impact site, he meets [[University of Southern California|USC]] [[library science]] instructor Sylvia Van Buren and her uncle, Pastor Matthew Collins. Later that night, a round hatch on the object unscrews and opens; a Martian weapon disintegrates the three men standing guard at the site, simultaneously shutting down all technology in the town with an [[electromagnetic pulse]]. The [[United States Marine Corps]] surround the crash site as reports pour in of identical objects landing all over the world and destroying cities. Pastor Collins attempts to make contact with the Martians, but is also disintegrated. The Martian [[Tripod (War of the Worlds)|war machines]] effortlessly defeat the military with their \"[[Heat-Ray]]\" and \"skeleton beam\" weapons.\n\nAttempting to escape in a military [[spotter plane]], Forrester and Sylvia crash land and hide in an abandoned farm house. They begin to develop closer feelings for each other just before the house is buried by yet another crashing cylinder. They encounter and dismember an \"electronic eye\" on a long cable from a nearby hovering Martian machine, and collect a blood sample from a Martian wounded by Forrester with an axe while protecting Sylvia. They manage to escape unseen just before the farm house is obliterated. Forrester takes the camera housing and blood samples to his team at Pacific Tech, in the hopes of finding a way to defeat the invaders.\n\nMany of the major world capitals are destroyed by the Martians, and the United States government makes the decision to drop the [[atomic bomb]]. The Martians' [[force shield]]s, however, prove impervious to the bomb's destructive power.\n\nAs the Martians advance on [[Los Angeles]] unopposed, the city is evacuated, and many of the inhabitants flee to the nearby mountains. Forrester, Sylvia, and the Pacific Tech team become separated in the chaos, and their scientific equipment is stolen or destroyed. Forrester searches for Sylvia in the city. Based on a story she had told him earlier, he guesses that she would take refuge in a church. After searching through several, he finds Sylvia among many praying survivors. Just as the Martians strike the church, their machines suddenly lose power and crash, one after another. Forrester witnesses one Martian dying as it tries to leave its fighting machine, noting that they were \"all [[Divine providence|praying for a miracle]]\".\n\nIn [[voice-over]], the film's narrator observes that while the Martians were impervious to humanity's weapons, they had \"...no resistance to the bacteria in our atmosphere to which we have long since become immune. ... After all that men could do had failed, the Martians were destroyed and humanity was saved by the littlest things, which God, in His wisdom, had put upon this Earth...\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Gene Barry]] as [[Doctor Clayton Forrester (War of the Worlds)|Dr. Clayton Forrester]]\n* [[Ann Robinson]] as Sylvia van Buren\n* [[Les Tremayne]] as General Mann\n* [[Robert O.

Woody's creator [[Walter Lantz]] and George Pal were close friends. Pal tried to always include the Woody character out of friendship and good luck in his productions, noted Joe Adamson years later, \"Walter had been close friends with Pal ever since Pal had left Europe in advance of the war and arrived in Hollywood.\"<ref name=\"Adamson 1985\">Adamson, Joe.

Blake, \"Religion in Speculative Fiction\", Ch.2, 5</ref> the film is very different from the original novel in its attitude toward religion, as reflected especially in the depiction of [[clergymen]] as characters. \"The staunchly [[secularist]] Wells depicted a cowardly and thoroughly uninspiring [[Curate]], whom the narrator regards with disgust, with which the reader is invited to concur. In the film there is instead the sympathetic and heroic Pastor Collins who dies a martyr's death. And then the film's final scene in the church, strongly emphasizing the Divine nature of Humanity's deliverance, has no parallel in the original book\".\n\nPal's adaptation has many other notable differences from H. G. Wells' novel. The closest resemblance is probably that of the antagonists. The film's aliens are indeed Martians and invade Earth for the same reasons as those stated in the novel (the state of Mars suggests that it is becoming unable to support life, leading to the Martians' decision to try to make Earth their new home). They land in the same way, by crashing to the earth. However, the novel's spacecraft are large cylinder-shaped projectiles fired from the Martian surface from some kind of cannon, instead of the film's meteorite-spaceships; but the Martians emerge from their craft in the same way, by unscrewing a large, round hatch. They appear to have no use for humans in the film. In the novel, however, the invaders are observed \"feeding\" on humans by fatally transfusing their captives' blood supply directly into Martian bodies by using [[pipettes]]; there is also a later speculation about the Martians eventually using trained human slaves to hunt down all remaining survivors after they have conquered Earth. In the film, the Martians do not bring their fast-growing [[red weed]] with them, but they are defeated by Earth [[microorganisms]], as in the novel. However, they die from the effects of the microorganisms within three days of the landing of the first meteorite-ship; in the novel, the Martians die within about three weeks of their invasion of England.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\t \t\nThe Martians themselves bear no physical resemblance to the novel's Martians, who are described as bear-sized, roundish creatures with brown bodies, \"merely heads\", with quivering beak-like, V-shaped mouths dripping [[saliva]]; they have sixteen whip-like tentacles in two groupings of eight arranged on each side of their mouths and two large \"luminous, disk-like eyes\". Due to budget constraints, their film counterparts are short, reddish-brown creatures with two long, thin arms with three long, thin fingers with suction cup tips. The Martian's \"head\", if it can be called that, is a broad \"face\" at the top-front of its broad shouldered upper torso, the only apparent feature of which is a single large eye with three distinctly colored lenses (red, blue, and green). The Martians' lower extremities, whatever they may be, are never shown. (Some speculative designs for the creature suggest the idea of three thin legs resembling their fingers, while others show them as [[bipeds]] with short, stubby legs with three-toed feet.)<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\t \t\nThe film's Martian war machines do actually have more of a resemblance than they may seem at first glance. The novel's machines are 10-story-tall tripods and carry the heat-ray projector on an articulated arm connected to the front of the war machine's main body. The film's machines are shaped like manta rays, with a bulbous, elongated green window at the front, through which the Martians observe their surroundings. On top of the machine is the cobra head-like heat-ray attached to a long, narrow, goose-neck extension. They can be mistaken for flying machines, but Forrester states that they are lifted by \"invisible legs\"; in one scene, when the first machine emerges, you can see faint traces of three energy legs beneath and three sparking traces where the three energy shafts touch the burning ground. Therefore, technically speaking, the film's war machines are indeed tripods, though they are never given that designation. Whereas the novel's war machines had no protection against British army and navy cannon fire, the film's war machines have a force field surrounding them; this invisible shield is described by Forrester as a \"protective blister\".<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\t  \t\nThe Martian weaponry is also partially unchanged. The heat-ray has the very same effect as that of the novel. However, the novel's heat-ray mechanism is briefly described as just a rounded hump when first seen in silhouette rising above the landing crater's rim; it fires an invisible energy beam in a wide arc while still in the pit made by the first Martian cylinder after it crash-lands. The film's heat-ray projector when first seen is shaped like a cobra's head and has a single, red pulsing \"eye\", which likely acts like a targeting telescope for the Martians inside their manta ray-like war machine. The novel describes another weapon, the \"black smoke\" used to kill all life; the war machines fire canisters  containing a black smoke-powder through a [[bazooka]]-like tube accessory. When dispersed, this black powder is lethal to all life forms who breathe it. This weapon is replaced in the film by a Martian \"skeleton beam\", green pulsing bursts fired from the wingtips of the manta-ray machines; these bursts break apart the [[sub-atomic]] bonds that hold matter together on anything they touch. These skeleton beams are used off screen to obliterate several French cities.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\t  \t\nThe plot of the film is very different from the novel, which tells the story of a 19th-century writer (with additional narration in later chapters by his medical student younger brother), who journeys through [[Victorian London]] and its southwestern suburbs while the Martians attack, eventually being reunited with his wife; the film's protagonist is a California scientist who falls in love with a former college student after the Martian invasion begins. However, certain points of the film's plot are similar to the novel, from the crash-landing of the Martian meteorite-ships to their eventual defeat by Earth's microorganisms. Forrester also experiences similar events like the book's narrator: an ordeal in a destroyed house, observing an actual Martian up close, and eventually reuniting with his love interest at the end of the story. The film is given more of a Cold War theme with its use of the Atomic Bomb against the enemy and the mass-destruction that such a global war would inflict on mankind.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe composer of the film score, [[Leith Stevens]], also composed two other scores for Pal productions: ''[[Destination Moon (film)|Destination Moon]]'' and ''[[When Worlds Collide (1951 film)|When Worlds Collide]]''.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\n===Special effects===\nAn effort was made to avoid the stereotypical flying saucer look of [[unidentified flying object|UFOs]]: The Martian war machines (designed by Al Nozaki) were instead made to be sinister-looking machines shaped like manta rays floating above the ground. Three Martian war machine props were made out of copper for the film. The same blueprints were used a decade later to construct the alien spacecraft in the film ''[[Robinson Crusoe on Mars]]'', also directed by Byron Haskin; that film prop was later reported melted down as part of a scrap copper recycling drive.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/> \n\nEach Martian machine was topped with an articulated metal neck/arm, culminating in the [[cobra]]-like head, housing a single electronic eye that operated both like a [[periscope]] and as a weapon. The electronic eye also housed the Martian heat ray, which pulsed and fired red sparking beams, all accompanied by thrumming and a high-pitched clattering shriek when the ray was used. The distinctive [[sound effect]] of the weapon was created by an orchestra performing a written score, mainly through the use of violins and cellos. For many years, it was utilized as a standard ray-gun sound on children's television shows and the science-fiction anthology series ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', particularly in the episode \"[[The Children of Spider County]]\".<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\nThe machines also fired a pulsing green ray (referred to as a skeleton beam) from their wingtips, generating a distinctive sound, also disintegrating their targets, notably people; this second weapon is a replacement for the [[chemical warfare|chemical weapon]] [[black smoke]] described in Wells' novel. This weapon's sound effect (created by striking a high tension cable with a hammer) was reused in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'', accompanying the launch of [[photon torpedo]]es. The sound used when the Martian ships begin to move was also recycled by The Original Series as the sound of an overloading hand phaser. Another prominent sound effect was a chattering, synthesized echo, perhaps representing some kind of Martian [[sonar]]; it can be described as sounding like hissing electronic rattlesnakes.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\nWhen the large Marine force opens fire on the Martians with everything in its heavy arsenal, each Martian machine is protected by an impenetrable [[Force shield|force field]] that resembles, when briefly visible between explosions, the clear jar placed over a mantle clock, or a [[bell jar]]; [[cylindrical]] and with a [[hemispherical]] top. This effect was accomplished by the use of simple matte paintings on clear glass, which were then photographed and combined with other effects, then optically printed together during post-production.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\nThe disintegration effect took 144 separate matte paintings to create. The sound effects of the war machines' heat rays firing were created by mixing the sound of three [[electric guitar]]s being recorded backwards. The Martian's scream in the farmhouse ruins was created by mixing the sound of a microphone scraping along dry ice being combined with a woman's recorded scream and then reverse-played for the sound effect mix.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\nThere were many problems trying to create the walking [[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)|tripods]] of Wells' novel. It was eventually decided to make the Martian machines appear to float in the air on three invisible legs. To show their existence, subtle special effects downward lights were to be added directly under the moving war machines; however, in the final film, these only appear when one of the first machines can be seen rising from the Martian's landing site. It proved too difficult to mark out the invisible legs when smoke and other effects had to be seen beneath the machines, and the effect used to create them also created a major fire hazard. In all of the subsequent scenes, however, the three invisible leg beams create small, sparking fires where they touch the ground.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Release===\n''The War of the Worlds'' had its official Hollywood [[Film premiere|premiere]] on February 20, 1953, although it did not go into [[Wide release|general theatrical release]] until the autumn of that year.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/> The film was both a critical and [[box office]] success.

The switch in film stock resulted in a degradation of lighting, timing, and resolution, causing the originally invisible wires suspending the Martian war machines to become increasingly more visible with each succeeding advance in film and video format, leading many, including respected critics, to believe the quality of the effects was always low quality. <ref>Miller, Thomas Kent.

G. Wells' The War of the Worlds''''') is a 1953 American [[science fiction film]] from [[Paramount Pictures]], produced by [[George Pal]], directed by [[Byron Haskin]], and starring [[Gene Barry]] and [[Ann Robinson]].\n\nThe film is a loose adaptation of the [[The War of the Worlds|novel of the same name]] by [[H. G. Wells]], the first of five film adaptations. It is a modern retelling of the 1897 novel, changing the setting from [[Victorian era]]-[[England]] to 1953 southern [[California]]. Earth is suddenly and unexpectedly invaded by [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martians]], and American scientist [[Doctor Clayton Forrester (War of the Worlds)|Clayton Forrester]] searches for any weakness that can stop them.\n\n''The War of the Worlds'' won an [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and went on to influence other science fiction films. In 2011, it was selected for preservation in the United States' [[National Film Registry]] in the [[Library of Congress]], being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn southern [[California]], [[Doctor Clayton Forrester (War of the Worlds)|Dr. Clayton Forrester]], a well-known atomic scientist, is fishing with colleagues when a large object crashes near the town of [[Linda Rosa, California|Linda Rosa]]. At the impact site, he meets [[University of Southern California|USC]] [[library science]] instructor Sylvia Van Buren and her uncle, Pastor Matthew Collins. Later that night, a round hatch on the object unscrews and opens; a Martian weapon disintegrates the three men standing guard at the site, simultaneously shutting down all technology in the town with an [[electromagnetic pulse]]. The [[United States Marine Corps]] surround the crash site as reports pour in of identical objects landing all over the world and destroying cities. Pastor Collins attempts to make contact with the Martians, but is also disintegrated. The Martian [[Tripod (War of the Worlds)|war machines]] effortlessly defeat the military with their \"[[Heat-Ray]]\" and \"skeleton beam\" weapons.\n\nAttempting to escape in a military [[spotter plane]], Forrester and Sylvia crash land and hide in an abandoned farm house. They begin to develop closer feelings for each other just before the house is buried by yet another crashing cylinder. They encounter and dismember an \"electronic eye\" on a long cable from a nearby hovering Martian machine, and collect a blood sample from a Martian wounded by Forrester with an axe while protecting Sylvia. They manage to escape unseen just before the farm house is obliterated. Forrester takes the camera housing and blood samples to his team at Pacific Tech, in the hopes of finding a way to defeat the invaders.\n\nMany of the major world capitals are destroyed by the Martians, and the United States government makes the decision to drop the [[atomic bomb]]. The Martians' [[force shield]]s, however, prove impervious to the bomb's destructive power.\n\nAs the Martians advance on [[Los Angeles]] unopposed, the city is evacuated, and many of the inhabitants flee to the nearby mountains. Forrester, Sylvia, and the Pacific Tech team become separated in the chaos, and their scientific equipment is stolen or destroyed. Forrester searches for Sylvia in the city. Based on a story she had told him earlier, he guesses that she would take refuge in a church. After searching through several, he finds Sylvia among many praying survivors. Just as the Martians strike the church, their machines suddenly lose power and crash, one after another.

Woody's creator [[Walter Lantz]] and George Pal were close friends.

Blake, \"Religion in Speculative Fiction\", Ch.2, 5</ref> the film is very different from the original novel in its attitude toward religion, as reflected especially in the depiction of [[clergymen]] as characters. \"The staunchly [[secularist]] Wells depicted a cowardly and thoroughly uninspiring [[Curate]], whom the narrator regards with disgust, with which the reader is invited to concur. In the film there is instead the sympathetic and heroic Pastor Collins who dies a martyr's death. And then the film's final scene in the church, strongly emphasizing the Divine nature of Humanity's deliverance, has no parallel in the original book\".\n\nPal's adaptation has many other notable differences from H. G. Wells' novel. The closest resemblance is probably that of the antagonists. The film's aliens are indeed Martians and invade Earth for the same reasons as those stated in the novel (the state of Mars suggests that it is becoming unable to support life, leading to the Martians' decision to try to make Earth their new home). They land in the same way, by crashing to the earth. However, the novel's spacecraft are large cylinder-shaped projectiles fired from the Martian surface from some kind of cannon, instead of the film's meteorite-spaceships; but the Martians emerge from their craft in the same way, by unscrewing a large, round hatch. They appear to have no use for humans in the film. In the novel, however, the invaders are observed \"feeding\" on humans by fatally transfusing their captives' blood supply directly into Martian bodies by using [[pipettes]]; there is also a later speculation about the Martians eventually using trained human slaves to hunt down all remaining survivors after they have conquered Earth. In the film, the Martians do not bring their fast-growing [[red weed]] with them, but they are defeated by Earth [[microorganisms]], as in the novel. However, they die from the effects of the microorganisms within three days of the landing of the first meteorite-ship; in the novel, the Martians die within about three weeks of their invasion of England.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\t \t\nThe Martians themselves bear no physical resemblance to the novel's Martians, who are described as bear-sized, roundish creatures with brown bodies, \"merely heads\", with quivering beak-like, V-shaped mouths dripping [[saliva]]; they have sixteen whip-like tentacles in two groupings of eight arranged on each side of their mouths and two large \"luminous, disk-like eyes\". Due to budget constraints, their film counterparts are short, reddish-brown creatures with two long, thin arms with three long, thin fingers with suction cup tips. The Martian's \"head\", if it can be called that, is a broad \"face\" at the top-front of its broad shouldered upper torso, the only apparent feature of which is a single large eye with three distinctly colored lenses (red, blue, and green). The Martians' lower extremities, whatever they may be, are never shown. (Some speculative designs for the creature suggest the idea of three thin legs resembling their fingers, while others show them as [[bipeds]] with short, stubby legs with three-toed feet.)<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\t \t\nThe film's Martian war machines do actually have more of a resemblance than they may seem at first glance. The novel's machines are 10-story-tall tripods and carry the heat-ray projector on an articulated arm connected to the front of the war machine's main body. The film's machines are shaped like manta rays, with a bulbous, elongated green window at the front, through which the Martians observe their surroundings. On top of the machine is the cobra head-like heat-ray attached to a long, narrow, goose-neck extension. They can be mistaken for flying machines, but Forrester states that they are lifted by \"invisible legs\"; in one scene, when the first machine emerges, you can see faint traces of three energy legs beneath and three sparking traces where the three energy shafts touch the burning ground. Therefore, technically speaking, the film's war machines are indeed tripods, though they are never given that designation. Whereas the novel's war machines had no protection against British army and navy cannon fire, the film's war machines have a force field surrounding them; this invisible shield is described by Forrester as a \"protective blister\".<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\t  \t\nThe Martian weaponry is also partially unchanged. The heat-ray has the very same effect as that of the novel. However, the novel's heat-ray mechanism is briefly described as just a rounded hump when first seen in silhouette rising above the landing crater's rim; it fires an invisible energy beam in a wide arc while still in the pit made by the first Martian cylinder after it crash-lands. The film's heat-ray projector when first seen is shaped like a cobra's head and has a single, red pulsing \"eye\", which likely acts like a targeting telescope for the Martians inside their manta ray-like war machine. The novel describes another weapon, the \"black smoke\" used to kill all life; the war machines fire canisters  containing a black smoke-powder through a [[bazooka]]-like tube accessory. When dispersed, this black powder is lethal to all life forms who breathe it. This weapon is replaced in the film by a Martian \"skeleton beam\", green pulsing bursts fired from the wingtips of the manta-ray machines; these bursts break apart the [[sub-atomic]] bonds that hold matter together on anything they touch. These skeleton beams are used off screen to obliterate several French cities.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\t  \t\nThe plot of the film is very different from the novel, which tells the story of a 19th-century writer (with additional narration in later chapters by his medical student younger brother), who journeys through [[Victorian London]] and its southwestern suburbs while the Martians attack, eventually being reunited with his wife; the film's protagonist is a California scientist who falls in love with a former college student after the Martian invasion begins. However, certain points of the film's plot are similar to the novel, from the crash-landing of the Martian meteorite-ships to their eventual defeat by Earth's microorganisms. Forrester also experiences similar events like the book's narrator: an ordeal in a destroyed house, observing an actual Martian up close, and eventually reuniting with his love interest at the end of the story. The film is given more of a Cold War theme with its use of the Atomic Bomb against the enemy and the mass-destruction that such a global war would inflict on mankind.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe composer of the film score, [[Leith Stevens]], also composed two other scores for Pal productions: ''[[Destination Moon (film)|Destination Moon]]'' and ''[[When Worlds Collide (1951 film)|When Worlds Collide]]''.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\n===Special effects===\nAn effort was made to avoid the stereotypical flying saucer look of [[unidentified flying object|UFOs]]: The Martian war machines (designed by Al Nozaki) were instead made to be sinister-looking machines shaped like manta rays floating above the ground. Three Martian war machine props were made out of copper for the film. The same blueprints were used a decade later to construct the alien spacecraft in the film ''[[Robinson Crusoe on Mars]]'', also directed by Byron Haskin; that film prop was later reported melted down as part of a scrap copper recycling drive.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/> \n\nEach Martian machine was topped with an articulated metal neck/arm, culminating in the [[cobra]]-like head, housing a single electronic eye that operated both like a [[periscope]] and as a weapon. The electronic eye also housed the Martian heat ray, which pulsed and fired red sparking beams, all accompanied by thrumming and a high-pitched clattering shriek when the ray was used. The distinctive [[sound effect]] of the weapon was created by an orchestra performing a written score, mainly through the use of violins and cellos. For many years, it was utilized as a standard ray-gun sound on children's television shows and the science-fiction anthology series ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', particularly in the episode \"[[The Children of Spider County]]\".<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\nThe machines also fired a pulsing green ray (referred to as a skeleton beam) from their wingtips, generating a distinctive sound, also disintegrating their targets, notably people; this second weapon is a replacement for the [[chemical warfare|chemical weapon]] [[black smoke]] described in Wells' novel. This weapon's sound effect (created by striking a high tension cable with a hammer) was reused in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'', accompanying the launch of [[photon torpedo]]es. The sound used when the Martian ships begin to move was also recycled by The Original Series as the sound of an overloading hand phaser. Another prominent sound effect was a chattering, synthesized echo, perhaps representing some kind of Martian [[sonar]]; it can be described as sounding like hissing electronic rattlesnakes.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\nWhen the large Marine force opens fire on the Martians with everything in its heavy arsenal, each Martian machine is protected by an impenetrable [[Force shield|force field]] that resembles, when briefly visible between explosions, the clear jar placed over a mantle clock, or a [[bell jar]]; [[cylindrical]] and with a [[hemispherical]] top. This effect was accomplished by the use of simple matte paintings on clear glass, which were then photographed and combined with other effects, then optically printed together during post-production.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\nThe disintegration effect took 144 separate matte paintings to create. The sound effects of the war machines' heat rays firing were created by mixing the sound of three [[electric guitar]]s being recorded backwards. The Martian's scream in the farmhouse ruins was created by mixing the sound of a microphone scraping along dry ice being combined with a woman's recorded scream and then reverse-played for the sound effect mix.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\nThere were many problems trying to create the walking [[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)|tripods]] of Wells' novel. It was eventually decided to make the Martian machines appear to float in the air on three invisible legs. To show their existence, subtle special effects downward lights were to be added directly under the moving war machines; however, in the final film, these only appear when one of the first machines can be seen rising from the Martian's landing site. It proved too difficult to mark out the invisible legs when smoke and other effects had to be seen beneath the machines, and the effect used to create them also created a major fire hazard. In all of the subsequent scenes, however, the three invisible leg beams create small, sparking fires where they touch the ground.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Release===\n''The War of the Worlds'' had its official Hollywood [[Film premiere|premiere]] on February 20, 1953, although it did not go into [[Wide release|general theatrical release]] until the autumn of that year.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/> The film was both a critical and [[box office]] success.

The switch in film stock resulted in a degradation of lighting, timing, and resolution, causing the originally invisible wires suspending the Martian war machines to become increasingly more visible with each succeeding advance in film and video format, leading many, including respected critics, to believe the quality of the effects was always low quality. <ref>Miller, Thomas Kent.
