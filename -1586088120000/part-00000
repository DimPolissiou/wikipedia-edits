Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 which means the town of god, boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were about 400 Jain temples. The ancient Jain temples of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of Jain temples in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the Jain temples at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].<ref>Sharma, Suresh K.; Sharma, Usha (2004), Cultural and Religious Heritage of India: Jainism, Mittal Publications, {{ISBN|978-81-7099-957-7}}</ref><ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samprati Samprati - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <br>\nDelwara, Nagda and Aayad were the centers of learning and culture before 15th century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to Nagda. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><br>\nAs on 2017, three main Jain temples remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of Rishabhdevbhagwan and one of Parshvnathbhagwan. Jain temples at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, Rishabhdev and Parshvnath. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 Tirthankara with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen Vidya-devis (goddesses of knowledge) are carved on the ceiling.\n\n=== Why Jain temples at [[Mt. Abu]] are called Dilwara Jain temples? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\"/> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the Solanki rulers of Gujaratvisited these temples during 11th and 13th centuries ADand were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the Jain temples. Vimal Shah,the minister, governor of Chandravati and commander in chief of Bhimadev I (1022\u201364), the Solanki ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near Mount Abu which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. The temple is known as Vimal Vasahi (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at Chandravati (near Abu road). Later, in 1230, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 Vastupal and Tejpal, both ministers of a Virdhaval, the Vaghela ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the Jain temples designed after Vimal Vasahi temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11th and 13th century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as Dilwara (Delwara) Jain temples. The Dilwara temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara (Mewar).\n\n== Arrival of Chauhans to Aravalli\u2019s of South West [[Rajasthan]] ==\nThe Chauhans during 11th century founded Amber, [[Sambhar, Rajasthan|Sambhar]] and [[Ajmer]] in Rajputana. The last of them, Vigraha Raja or Rao Bisaldeo, in the middle of the 12th century extended the ancestral dominions considerably and conquered [[Delhi]] from a chief of the Tomara clan. At that time, according to their own bard, the dominions of the Chauhans extended north to Hissar and south to the [[Aravalli]] hills. After Prithviraj Chauhan III was killed in a battle in 1192, the Chauhan kingdom was broken up. <br>\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized Nadol (near Jodhpur) from the Paramaras and established himself there toward the end of the 10th century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan Qutbud-din Aibak of Delhi, during the 12th century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to Bhinmal and Sanchor, before seizing Jalore from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipalwas progenitor of Songara clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref>Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref><br>\nChauhans have 26 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of Jalore, Chandravati and Sirohi belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.<br>\n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar(now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Kshem Singh or Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to Dungarpur. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. Jagirdars of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref><br>\n<blockquote> ''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle. Samant Singh went to Vagad and established Dungarpur state. Later Rawal Kumar Singh, younger brother of Rawal Samant Singh, recaptured Ahar, the capital of Mewar\u201d.'' </blockquote>\nThis fact is also established by the existence of an Ashapura temple on a hill top at village Berwas, between Ahar and Debari region of Udaipur. Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri KrishanJugnu, \u201cDebarimeans window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. <br>\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13th century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar Ojha writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015). Udaipur Rajya ka Itihas Part 1 & 2 (Hindi). Rajasthani Granthaghar, Jodhpur</ref><br>\n<blockquote> ''\u201cThe information regarding genealogy of Deora Chauhans, available from the different books of \u2018Bhaats\u2019 (story tellers) and inscriptions, is full of contradictions and the names are at variance. There is a difference of opinion as well, among historians regarding genealogy of Songara and Deora Chauhans\u201d.'' </blockquote>\n\n==Rulers of Delwara before medieval period==\nBhanwarlal Nahata writes in \u2018Bachhawat MunthaVanshavli\u2019,<ref>BhanwarlalNahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref><br>\n<blockquote> ''\u201cChauhans have 24 sects and Deoras are one of them. Among Deora Songiragotra, first one is Sanwantsi (Samant Singh) Songira, who had 4 sons \u2013 1 Kalhade (Kanhadeo), 2 Malde (Maldeo), 3 Salhe (Reningdeo) and 4 Sagarsi (Sagar). Sagar\u2019s son Bohitya became sharvak (Jain disciple) by the blessings of Vardhman Suri Khartar\u201d.'' </blockquote>\nRaja Sagar fought against Muslim invaders<br>\nDuring 12th century, Rao Samant Singh of Jalore had four sons \u2013 Rao Kanhadeo, Maldeo, Raningdeo and Sagar. Rao Kanhadeo and his son Kunwar Viramdeo were killed in a battle against Allauddin Khilji in 1311, while Rao Maldeo and Rao Raningdeo ruled smaller Jagirs in Jalore. It is believed that Rao Sagar was given the Jagir of Delwara, as the adjoining areas of Girva (Udaipur) were ruled by Deora Chauhans until 14-15th century.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Tod1/bk04ch05.html#fn925 Chapter 5<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <br>\nThere is another bard's tale that during 12th Century, Delwara was being ruled by a Rajput ruler Rao Bhim Singh. His only daughter was married to Rao Samant Singh of Jalore, who had two queens. Sagar was born to Delwara Baiji. Due to differences with the other queen over succession to the throne of Jalore, she returned to her father's place, Delwara. Since Rao Bhim Singh, did not have any male child, his grandson Sagar, a Deora Chauhan, ascended the throne of Delwara.<ref>Seth Rajmal Lalwani; Sukhsampat Raj Bhandari and others (1939). Oswal Jati ka Itihas. Oswal History Publishing House, Bhanpura, Indore.</ref> <br>\nAround middle of 13th century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of Jalore was a very brave king of Delwara. He was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan. Raja Sagar was blessed with three sons - Bohitya, Gangadas and Jaisingh. Whenever there was invasion from Muslims, Rana Jaitra Singh (1213\u201353) called Raja Sagar for help in the battle. Raja Sagar always came along with army and fought valiantly against the invading Muslims.<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\">Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980).

While he ensured full protection for Jaitra Singh, as Delwada's army fought fearlessly alongside Mewar army. Iltutmish destroyed temples after temples in and around Nagda and Delwara. The villages were burnt. <br>\nDr Shri Krishan Jugnu, writes in his book, Nandeshma Abhilekh \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh<ref>Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, Nandeshma Abhilekh \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh (2015). Lokchetna Prakashan.</ref><br>\n<blockquote>''\u201cThis fierce battle was fought in the valley near Nagda towards Gogunda. Besides Gohils, there were brave soldiers from Chauhans, Chandanas, Solankis, Parmars, Chaarans and Tribals who fought for Mewar. They gave a tough fight to Sultan\u2019s army. However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In 14th century, according to a mythological tradition of offeringwater tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.\u201d There is another bard that says, Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.''</blockquote>\n\n===Raja Bohitya sacrifices his life for Mewar===\nRaja Sagar's son Raja Bohitya was also brave and intelligent like his father and ruled Delwara during the time of Rawal Samar Singh (1273\u20131302) and Rana Ratan Singh (1302\u20131303). Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara. It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=autogenerated1>Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref><br>\nOne day while Bohitya was asleep in his palace, a snake climbed the bed and bit him on his legs. After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. Both Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999). Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan. Rawat Publications.</ref><br>\n\n=== Rana Shree Karan Sacrifices his Life for Mewar ===\nAfter Raja Bohitya,his eldest son Raja Shree Karan ascended the throne of Delwara. Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14th Century the soldiers of RanaShree Karan looted the treasury of Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983).

Muhammad Bin Tughluk brought in large army to recapture Chittor Fort, but he was defeated by the army of Maharana Hamir Singh I and taken prisoner at Singoli, near Mandalgarh. Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting MaharanaHamir Singh I.Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts. But he died in 1351 at Delhi.

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj.

Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, the Kingdom of Mewar was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with Badi Sadri and Gogunda. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15th Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. <br> \nAjja fought alongside Maharana Sangram Singh I (1509\u20131527) against Babur in 1527 at the Battle of Khanwa. When Maharana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> <br>\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14th century till Jhalas came in 15th century?

Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 which means the town of god, boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were about 400 Jain temples. The ancient Jain temples of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of Jain temples in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the Jain temples at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].<ref>Sharma, Suresh K.; Sharma, Usha (2004), Cultural and Religious Heritage of India: Jainism, Mittal Publications, {{ISBN|978-81-7099-957-7}}</ref><ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samprati Samprati - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <br>\nDelwara, Nagda and Aayad were the centers of learning and culture before 15th century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to Nagda. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><br>\nAs on 2017, three main Jain temples remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of Rishabhdevbhagwan and one of Parshvnathbhagwan. Jain temples at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, Rishabhdev and Parshvnath. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 Tirthankara with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen Vidya-devis (goddesses of knowledge) are carved on the ceiling.\n\n=== Why Jain temples at [[Mt. Abu]] are called Dilwara Jain temples? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\"/> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the Solanki rulers of Gujaratvisited these temples during 11th and 13th centuries ADand were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the Jain temples. Vimal Shah,the minister, governor of Chandravati and commander in chief of Bhimadev I (1022\u201364), the Solanki ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near Mount Abu which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. The temple is known as Vimal Vasahi (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at Chandravati (near Abu road). Later, in 1230, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 Vastupal and Tejpal, both ministers of a Virdhaval, the Vaghela ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the Jain temples designed after Vimal Vasahi temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11th and 13th century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as Dilwara (Delwara) Jain temples. The Dilwara temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara (Mewar).\n\n== Arrival of Chauhans to Aravalli\u2019s of South West [[Rajasthan]] ==\nThe Chauhans during 11th century founded Amber, [[Sambhar, Rajasthan|Sambhar]] and [[Ajmer]] in Rajputana. The last of them, Vigraha Raja or Rao Bisaldeo, in the middle of the 12th century extended the ancestral dominions considerably and conquered [[Delhi]] from a chief of the Tomara clan. At that time, according to their own bard, the dominions of the Chauhans extended north to Hissar and south to the [[Aravalli]] hills. After Prithviraj Chauhan III was killed in a battle in 1192, the Chauhan kingdom was broken up. <br>\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized Nadol (near Jodhpur) from the Paramaras and established himself there toward the end of the 10th century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan Qutbud-din Aibak of Delhi, during the 12th century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to Bhinmal and Sanchor, before seizing Jalore from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipalwas progenitor of Songara clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref>Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref><br>\nChauhans have 26 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of Jalore, Chandravati and Sirohi belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.<br>\n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar(now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Kshem Singh or Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to Dungarpur. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. Jagirdars of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref><br>\n<blockquote> ''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle. Samant Singh went to Vagad and established Dungarpur state. Later Rawal Kumar Singh, younger brother of Rawal Samant Singh, recaptured Ahar, the capital of Mewar\u201d.'' </blockquote>\nThis fact is also established by the existence of an Ashapura temple on a hill top at village Berwas, between Ahar and Debari region of Udaipur. Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri KrishanJugnu, \u201cDebarimeans window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. <br>\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13th century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar Ojha writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Rao Kanhadeo and his son Kunwar Viramdeo were killed in a battle against Allauddin Khilji in 1311, while Rao Maldeo and Rao Raningdeo ruled smaller Jagirs in Jalore. It is believed that Rao Sagar was given the Jagir of Delwara, as the adjoining areas of Girva (Udaipur) were ruled by Deora Chauhans until 14-15th century.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Tod1/bk04ch05.html#fn925 Chapter 5<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <br>\nThere is another bard's tale that during 12th Century, Delwara was being ruled by a Rajput ruler Rao Bhim Singh. His only daughter was married to Rao Samant Singh of Jalore, who had two queens. Sagar was born to Delwara Baiji. Due to differences with the other queen over succession to the throne of Jalore, she returned to her father's place, Delwara. Since Rao Bhim Singh, did not have any male child, his grandson Sagar, a Deora Chauhan, ascended the throne of Delwara.<ref>Seth Rajmal Lalwani; Sukhsampat Raj Bhandari and others (1939).

He was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan. Raja Sagar was blessed with three sons - Bohitya, Gangadas and Jaisingh. Whenever there was invasion from Muslims, Rana Jaitra Singh (1213\u201353) called Raja Sagar for help in the battle. Raja Sagar always came along with army and fought valiantly against the invading Muslims.<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\">Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980).

While he ensured full protection for Jaitra Singh, as Delwada's army fought fearlessly alongside Mewar army. Iltutmish destroyed temples after temples in and around Nagda and Delwara. The villages were burnt. <br>\nDr Shri Krishan Jugnu, writes in his book, Nandeshma Abhilekh \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh<ref>Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, Nandeshma Abhilekh \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh (2015).

However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In 14th century, according to a mythological tradition of offeringwater tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.\u201d There is another bard that says, Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.''</blockquote>\n\n===Raja Bohitya sacrifices his life for Mewar===\nRaja Sagar's son Raja Bohitya was also brave and intelligent like his father and ruled Delwara during the time of Rawal Samar Singh (1273\u20131302) and Rana Ratan Singh (1302\u20131303). Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara. It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=autogenerated1>Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref><br>\nOne day while Bohitya was asleep in his palace, a snake climbed the bed and bit him on his legs. After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. Both Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999). Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan.
