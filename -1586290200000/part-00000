Innovations included the strikingly modern [[Ponton (automobile)|Ponton]] format body-work incorporating numerous styling features from the United States and large amounts of chrome decoration both on the outside and on the inside.\n\nThe car was offered till 1957.   Unusually, at least in European terms, the manufacturer followed the example of [[General Motors]] in [[Detroit]] by applying an annual facelift.   There was a new front grill every year along with other detailed modifications to the trim.   The policy of annual facelifts ensured plenty of publicity, and the car was a commercial success, achieving second place in the West German sales charts year after year, beaten to the top slot only by the much smaller, less costly and at this time seemingly unstoppable [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen]].   Around 580,000 Olympia Rekords were produced.   Opel boss Edward Zdunek justified the annual facelifts with the explanation that they gave customers the possibility of \"sozialen Differenzierung\" (social differentiation).   Nevertheless, commentators also noted that the Detroit inspired annual face-lift disadvantaged owners because it depressed second hand values for the Olympia Rekord.<ref name=OldtimerKatalogNr23>{{cite journal| authorlink = G\u00fcnther Zink  (verantwortlich)| title =Oldtimer Katalog| journal = | volume = Nr. 23| pages = Seite 260\u2013261|year = 2009|isbn = 978-3-86852-067-5 |publisher=HEEL Verlag GmbH|location=K\u00f6nigswinter }}</ref> The Olympia Rekord set a pattern that Opel would follow for many decades, providing a lot more car for the money than most competitor manufacturers.\n\nBy contrast to the modern and annually modified bodywork, the 1488 cc ohc four-cylinder water-cooled engine was very little changed since it had first been offered in the [[Opel Olympia]] back in 1937.   When the Olympia Rekord first appeared in 1953 maximum power output of 40&nbsp;hp (29&nbsp;kW) at 3800 rpm was claimed.   This was increased at the end of 1955 for the 1956 model year to 45&nbsp;hp (33&nbsp;kW) at 3900 rpm.   At the same time there was a marginal increase in maximum torque, and the compression ratio was raised from 6.5:1 to 6.9:1.   The 1950s was a decade during which minimum fuel octanes were raised progressively across western Europe:  the manufacturer continued to specify \"normal\" grade fuel for the Olympia Rekord throughout its life.\n\n==The Name==\nThe car retained the \"Olympia\" name, originally applied in 1935 to the predecessor model in anticipation of the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympic Games]].   The Olympia had been a defining model for Opel, featuring then revolutionary monocoque body construction, and intended to be produced in huge numbers at a time when the national economy was finally seen to be on a sustained upswing.    Adding the name \"Rekord\" in 1953 built on the theme of sporting success, and reflected a spirit of optimism which the model's marketplace performance would justify.\n\n== Evolution ==\n\n===1953/54===\nThe Opel Olympia Rekord was introduced with a new generously proportioned body and an old 1,488 cc engine in March 1953.   The top seller, by far, was the two-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]].   From August 1953 Opel also offered a 2-door cabriolet (''\"Cabrio-Limouisine\"'') which, despite costing only an extra DM 300, sold in very small numbers.   Also available from August was a 3-door [[station wagon|estate]] which Opel branded as the Opel Olympia Rekord CarAVan.  The resulting eleven syllable name was evidently no handicap in the marketplace, since the \"Caravan\" name would turn up on many subsequent Opel estate models.   The styling was upbeat and an unapologetic tribute to the designs that [[General Motors]] were producing in [[Detroit]], with a particularly striking open mouthed front grill which reminded commentators of a shark's mouth (der \"Haifischmaul-Kuelhergrill\").<ref name=OldtimerKatalogNr23/>   Some customers may have been irritated that all the cars were delivered with their standard steel wheels painted black regardless of the colour of the car body, although sellers of after-market wheel trims were no doubt delighted by Opel's cost-cutting approach to painting the car's wheels.<ref name=\"Oswald, p 179\">[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 179</ref>\n\nThe advertised price in Germany was DM 6,410 for the 2-door \"Limousine\" (sedan) and DM 6,710 for the \"Cabrio-Limousine\" and \"Caravan\" (estate).   By July 1954 Opel had produced 113,966 \"Limousine\" (sedan) or \"Cabrio-Limousine\" Olympia Rekords along with 15,804 \"Caravan\" (estate) versions and 6,258 Olympia Rekord panel vans.<ref name=\"Oswald, p 179\"/>\n\n===1954/55===\nProduction of the first Olympia Rekord ended in July 1954 and in late summer 1954 the mildly facelifted 1955 car was presented. The advertised power output of the 1,488 cc engine was unchanged at 40&nbsp;hp (29&nbsp;kW) despite a slight increase in the compression ratio from 6.3:1 to 6.5:1. The back window grew in size and the front grill was modified, through he addition of a single thick horizontal bar across the hitherto \"open-mouthed\" grill. This new adornment earned for the 1956 model, when coloured green, the soubriquet \"Gurkenraspel\" ''(\"cucumber grill\")''.<ref name=OldtimerKatalogNr23/>\n\nA new base model was offered at DM 5,850, which was slightly above DM 1,000 more expensive than the market leading [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen]]. Opel's new entry level family car also received a reduced name, being badged simply as the Opel Olympia, while the other models in the range continued with the Opel Olympia Rekord name. The 1955 model year also saw the introduction of a light panel van version.\n\n===1955/56===\nThe 1956 model, introduced towards the end of 1955, featured simplified bumpers from which the over-riders had disappeared.   The hitherto \"open-mouthed\" grill was now filled with closely packed thin vertical bars.   Further price reductions followed the trend also followed by other German auto-makers during the mid-1950s and the advertised German market price for the 1956 model ranged from 5,410 to 6,560 marks.   The old 1,488 cc engine was also upgraded with a further increase in the compression ratio, now to 6.9:1, and advertised maximum power was increased to 45&nbsp;hp (33&nbsp;kW).   In other respects the old engine was very little changed.\n\nIn July 1956 the 2-door cabriolet version was withdrawn. It had not sold well: the few survivors are much prized by enthusiasts and collectors half a century later.<ref name=OldtimerKatalogNr23/>\n\n===1956/57===\nThe 1957 model appeared in July 1956.   The grill was again modified, the roof was slightly flattened and the exterior acquired even more chrome embellishment.   Although the company had previously shunned significant mechanical changes when making their annual upgrades, they did now introduced an all-synchromesh gear-box.\n\nGerman market advertised prices now stood between DM 5,510 and 6,560. By way of comparison, 1957 was the year that Volkswagen finally managed to sink the price of their entry level [[Volkswagen Type 1|Beetle]] to just below DM 4,000.\n\nThe Opel Olympia Rekord was superseded in August 1957 by the new, larger and more flamboyantly styled [[Opel (Olympia) Rekord P1|Rekord P1]] which would for the first time be offered with four doors.   The 1937 Opel Olympia engine would continue to power entry level Opel Rekord models till 1965, however.\n\n==Commercial==\nDuring the four-year period between 1953 and 1957 Opel recorded production of 582,924 Olympia Rekords, with the rate accelerating markedly in 1957.<ref name=OldtimerKatalogNr23/>   It was still produced at about half the rate of the Volkswagen Beetle, but it was repeatedly Germany's second best seller, and the first of a long line of Opel's that would outsell competitor vehicles from Ford, both in Germany and in key European export markets.   During six years from 1952 to 1958 Ford recorded production of 564,863 [[Ford Taunus P1|Taunus 12Ms and 15Ms]]<ref name=OldtimerKatalogNr23/> which were comparable to the middle weight Opel in many ways, though half a class down in terms of price and (at least in the case of the 12M version) power.\n\n== Technical data ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-style=\"background:#DDDDDD;\"\n| colspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" | '''Opel Olympia Rekord'''  1953-1957\n|- style=\"background:#EEEEEE;\"\n! width=\"20%\"|\n! width=\"20%\"|1953/54\n! width=\"20%\"|1954/55 \n! width=\"20%\"|1955/56\n! width=\"20%\"|1956/57\n|- style=\"background:#EEEEEE;\"|\n! width=\"20%\" align=\"left\" |\n! width=\"20%\"|\n! width=\"20%\"| \n! width=\"20%\"|\n! width=\"20%\"|\n|- style=\"background:#EEEEEE;\"\n| Motor:&nbsp;

At the same time there was a marginal increase in maximum torque, and the compression ratio was raised from 6.5:1 to 6.9:1.   The 1950s was a decade during which minimum fuel octanes were raised progressively across western Europe:  the manufacturer continued to specify \"normal\" grade fuel for the Olympia Rekord throughout its life.\n\n==The Name==\nThe car retained the \"Olympia\" name, originally applied in 1935 to the predecessor model in anticipation of the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympic Games]].   The Olympia had been a defining model for Opel, featuring then revolutionary monocoque body construction, and intended to be produced in huge numbers at a time when the national economy was finally seen to be on a sustained upswing.    Adding the name \"Rekord\" in 1953 built on the theme of sporting success, and reflected a spirit of optimism which the model's marketplace performance would justify.\n\n== Evolution ==\n\n===1953/54===\nThe Opel Olympia Rekord was introduced with a new generously proportioned body and an old 1,488 cc engine in March 1953.   The top seller, by far, was the two-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]].   From August 1953 Opel also offered a 2-door cabriolet (''\"Cabrio-Limouisine\"'') which, despite costing only an extra DM 300, sold in very small numbers.   Also available from August was a 3-door [[station wagon|estate]] which Opel branded as the Opel Olympia Rekord CarAVan.  The resulting eleven syllable name was evidently no handicap in the marketplace, since the \"Caravan\" name would turn up on many subsequent Opel estate models.   The styling was upbeat and an unapologetic tribute to the designs that [[General Motors]] were producing in [[Detroit]], with a particularly striking open mouthed front grill which reminded commentators of a shark's mouth (der \"Haifischmaul-Kuelhergrill\").<ref name=OldtimerKatalogNr23/>   Some customers may have been irritated that all the cars were delivered with their standard steel wheels painted black regardless of the colour of the car body, although sellers of after-market wheel trims were no doubt delighted by Opel's cost-cutting approach to painting the car's wheels.<ref name=\"Oswald, p 179\">[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 179</ref>\n\nThe advertised price in Germany was DM 6,410 for the 2-door \"Limousine\" (sedan) and DM 6,710 for the \"Cabrio-Limousine\" and \"Caravan\" (estate).   By July 1954 Opel had produced 113,966 \"Limousine\" (sedan) or \"Cabrio-Limousine\" Olympia Rekords along with 15,804 \"Caravan\" (estate) versions and 6,258 Olympia Rekord panel vans.<ref name=\"Oswald, p 179\"/>\n\n===1954/55===\nProduction of the first Olympia Rekord ended in July 1954 and in late summer 1954 the mildly facelifted 1955 car was presented. The advertised power output of the 1,488 cc engine was unchanged at 40&nbsp;hp (29&nbsp;kW) despite a slight increase in the compression ratio from 6.3:1 to 6.5:1. The back window grew in size and the front grill was modified, through he addition of a single thick horizontal bar across the hitherto \"open-mouthed\" grill. This new adornment earned for the 1956 model, when coloured green, the soubriquet \"Gurkenraspel\" ''(\"cucumber grill\")''.<ref name=OldtimerKatalogNr23/>\n\nA new base model was offered at DM 5,850, which was slightly above DM 1,000 more expensive than the market leading [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen]]. Opel's new entry level family car also received a reduced name, being badged simply as the Opel Olympia, while the other models in the range continued with the Opel Olympia Rekord name. The 1955 model year also saw the introduction of a light panel van version.\n\n===1955/56===\nThe 1956 model, introduced towards the end of 1955, featured simplified bumpers from which the over-riders had disappeared.   The hitherto \"open-mouthed\" grill was now filled with closely packed thin vertical bars.   Further price reductions followed the trend also followed by other German auto-makers during the mid-1950s and the advertised German market price for the 1956 model ranged from 5,410 to 6,560 marks.   The old 1,488 cc engine was also upgraded with a further increase in the compression ratio, now to 6.9:1, and advertised maximum power was increased to 45&nbsp;hp (33&nbsp;kW).   In other respects the old engine was very little changed.\n\nIn July 1956 the 2-door cabriolet version was withdrawn. It had not sold well: the few survivors are much prized by enthusiasts and collectors half a century later.<ref name=OldtimerKatalogNr23/>\n\n===1956/57===\nThe 1957 model appeared in July 1956.   The grill was again modified, the roof was slightly flattened and the exterior acquired even more chrome embellishment.   Although the company had previously shunned significant mechanical changes when making their annual upgrades, they did now introduced an all-synchromesh gear-box.\n\nGerman market advertised prices now stood between DM 5,510 and 6,560. By way of comparison, 1957 was the year that Volkswagen finally managed to sink the price of their entry level [[Volkswagen Type 1|Beetle]] to just below DM 4,000.\n\nThe Opel Olympia Rekord was superseded in August 1957 by the new, larger and more flamboyantly styled [[Opel (Olympia) Rekord P1|Rekord P1]] which would for the first time be offered with four doors.   The 1937 Opel Olympia engine would continue to power entry level Opel Rekord models till 1965, however.\n\n==Commercial==\nDuring the four-year period between 1953 and 1957 Opel recorded production of 582,924 Olympia Rekords, with the rate accelerating markedly in 1957.<ref name=OldtimerKatalogNr23/>   It was still produced at about half the rate of the Volkswagen Beetle, but it was repeatedly Germany\u2019s second best seller, and the first of a long line of Opel\u2019s that would outsell competitor vehicles from Ford, both in Germany and in key European export markets.   During six years from 1952 to 1958 Ford recorded production of 564,863 [[Ford Taunus P1|Taunus 12Ms and 15Ms]]<ref name=OldtimerKatalogNr23/> which were comparable to the middle weight Opel in many ways, though half a class down in terms of price and (at least in the case of the 12M version) power.\n\n== Technical data ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-style=\"background:#DDDDDD;\"\n| colspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" | '''Opel Olympia Rekord'''  1953-1957\n|- style=\"background:#EEEEEE;\"\n!

Reagan, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from [[California]], took office following a landslide victory over [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] President [[Jimmy Carter]] in the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 presidential election]]. Reagan was succeeded by his Vice President, [[George H. W. Bush]], who won the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential election]] with Reagan's support. Reagan's 1980 election resulted from a dramatic [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative shift to the right]] in American politics, including a loss of confidence in [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]], [[New Deal]], and [[Great Society]] programs and priorities that had dominated the national agenda since the 1930s.\n\nDomestically, the Reagan administration enacted a [[Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981|major tax cut]], sought to cut non-military spending, and eliminated federal regulations. The administration's economic policies, known as \"[[Reaganomics]]\", were inspired by [[supply-side economics]]. The combination of tax cuts and an increase in defense spending led to budget deficits, and the [[National debt of the United States|federal debt]] increased significantly during Reagan's tenure. Reagan signed the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]] (which simplified the tax code by reducing rates and removing several tax breaks) and the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]] (which enacted sweeping changes to U.S. immigration law and granted amnesty to three million [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]]). Reagan also appointed more [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal judges]] than any other president, including four [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justices.\n\nReagan's [[Foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration|foreign policy]] stance was resolutely [[anti-communism|anti-communist]]; its plan of action, known as the [[Reagan Doctrine]], sought to [[rollback|roll back]] the global influence of the [[Soviet Union]] in an attempt to end the Cold War. Under this doctrine, the Reagan administration initiated a massive buildup of the United States military; promoted new technologies such as missile defense systems; and, in 1983, undertook an [[invasion of Grenada]], the first major overseas action by U.S. troops since the end of the [[Vietnam War]]. The administration also created controversy by granting [[United States and state-sponsored terrorism|aid to paramilitary forces]] seeking to overthrow leftist governments, particularly in war-torn [[Central America]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Specifically, the Reagan administration engaged in covert arms sales to [[Iran]] to fund [[Contras|Contra]] rebels in Nicaragua that were fighting to overthrow their nation's socialist government; the resulting [[Iran\u2013Contra affair|scandal]] led to the conviction or resignation of several administration officials. During Reagan's second term, he sought closer relations with Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and the two leaders signed a major [[arms control]] agreement known as the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF Treaty]].\n\nLeaving office in 1989, Reagan held an approval rating of 68%. This rating matches the approval ratings of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Bill Clinton]] as the highest rating for a departing president in the modern era.<ref>{{cite web|title = A Look Back At The Polls|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-look-back-at-the-polls/|publisher = CBS News|access-date = May 15, 2015}}</ref> Historians and political scientists generally [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|rank]] Reagan as an above-average president. Due to Reagan's impact on public discourse and advocacy of [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]], some historians have described the period during and after his presidency as the [[Reagan Era]].\n\n==Conservative shift in politics==\n{{Further|Conservatism in the United States|Reagan Era}}\n\nEven prior to becoming president, Reagan was the leader of a dramatic conservative shift that undercut many of the domestic and foreign policies that had dominated the national agenda for decades.<ref>Bruce J.

While distrust of high officials had been an American characteristic for two centuries, Watergate engendered heightened levels of suspicion and encouraged the media to engage in a vigorous search for scandals.<ref>J. Lull, and S. Hinerman, \"The search for scandal' in J. Lull & S. Hinerman, eds. ''Media scandals: Morality and desire in the popular culture marketplace'' (1997) pp. 1-33.</ref> An unexpected new factor was the emergence of the [[Christian right|religious right]] as a cohesive political force that gave strong support to conservatism.<ref>Paul Boyer, \"The Evangelical Resurgence in 1970s American Protestantism\" in Schulman and Zelizer, eds. ''Rightward bound'' pp 29-51.:</ref><ref>Stephen D. Johnson and Joseph B.

Though the civil rights legislation of the 1960s had been a triumphal issue for liberalism and had created a new, pro-Democratic black electorate, it had also destroyed the argument that whites had to vote Democratic in order to protect segregation in the South.<ref>Earl Black and Merle Black, ''Politics and Society in the South'' (1989) p 249.</ref> Responding to these various trends, Reagan and other conservatives successfully presented conservative ideas as an alternative to a public that had grown disillusioned with New Deal liberalism and the Democratic Party.<ref>Wilentz, pp. 4\u20137</ref> Reagan's charisma and speaking skills helped him frame conservatism as an optimistic, forward-looking vision for the country.<ref>Wilentz, pp. 137\u2013138</ref>\n\n==1980 presidential election==\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1980.svg|right|thumb|1980 electoral vote results]]\n{{Main|Ronald Reagan 1980 presidential campaign|1980 United States presidential election}}\n\nReagan, who had served as [[Governor of California]] from 1967 to 1975, narrowly lost the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1976|1976 Republican presidential primaries]] to incumbent President [[Gerald Ford]]. With the defeat of Ford by Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]] in the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 election]], Reagan immediately became the front-runner for the 1980 Republican presidential nomination.<ref>Weisberg,\npp. 56-57</ref> A darling of the conservative movement, Reagan faced more moderate Republicans such as [[George H.

After Bush won the Iowa caucuses, he became Reagan's primary challenger, but Reagan won the New Hampshire primary and most of the following primaries, gaining an insurmountable delegate lead by the end of March 1980. Ford was Reagan's first choice for his running mate, but Reagan backed away from the idea out of the fear of a \"copresidency\" in which Ford would exercise an unusual degree of power. Reagan instead chose Bush, and the Reagan-Bush ticket was nominated at the [[1980 Republican National Convention]]. Meanwhile, Carter won the Democratic nomination, defeating a primary challenge by Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]. Polls taken after the party conventions showed a tied race between Reagan and Carter, while independent candidate [[John B. Anderson]] had the support of many moderates.<ref>Weisberg, pp. 61-63</ref>\n\nThe 1980 general campaign between Reagan and Carter was conducted amid a multitude of domestic concerns and the ongoing [[Iran hostage crisis]]. After winning the Republican nomination, Reagan pivoted to the center. Though he continued to champion a major tax cut, Reagan backed off of his support for free trade and the privatization of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], and promised to consider [[arms control]] treaties with the [[Soviet Union]]. He instead sought to focus the race on Carter's handling of the economy. Mired with an approval rating in the low 30s, Carter also waged a negative campaign, focusing on the supposed risk of war if Reagan took office.<ref>Rossinow, pp. 23\u201327</ref>\n\nReagan and Carter met in one presidential debate, held just one week before election day. Reagan delivered an effective performance, asking voters, \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?...Is America as respected throughout the world as it was?\" Though the race had been widely regarded as a close contest, Reagan won over the large majority of undecided voters.<ref>Rossinow, pp. 27\u201328</ref> Reagan took 50.7% of the popular vote and 489 of the 538 electoral votes. Carter won 41% of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes, while Anderson won 6.6% of the popular vote. In the concurrent [[United States elections, 1980|congressional elections]], Republicans took control of the Senate for the first time since the 1950s, while Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives.<ref>Patterson, pp. 149\u2013151</ref>\n\n==Administration==\n\n{{Infobox U.S. Cabinet\n|align=right\n|Name=Reagan\n|President=Ronald Reagan\n|President start=1981\n|President end=1989\n|Vice President=[[George H.

After the deadline passed, Reagan fired over 10,000 air traffic controllers, while approximately 40 percent of the union members returned to work.

Congress, which favored negotiations between the Contras and Sandinista, passed the 1982 [[Boland Amendment]], prohibiting the CIA and Defense Department from using their budgets to provide aid to the Contras.

South Africa's military was then engaged in an occupation of [[Namibia]] and [[proxy war]]s in several neighboring countries, in alliance with Savimbi's UNITA.

Reagan, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from [[California]], took office following a landslide victory over [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] President [[Jimmy Carter]] in the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 presidential election]]. Reagan was succeeded by his Vice President, [[George H. W. Bush]], who won the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential election]] with Reagan's support. Reagan's 1980 election resulted from a dramatic [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative shift to the right]] in American politics, including a loss of confidence in [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]], [[New Deal]], and [[Great Society]] programs and priorities that had dominated the national agenda since the 1930s.\n\nDomestically, the Reagan administration enacted a [[Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981|major tax cut]], sought to cut non-military spending, and eliminated federal regulations. The administration's economic policies, known as \"[[Reaganomics]]\", were inspired by [[supply-side economics]]. The combination of tax cuts and an increase in defense spending led to budget deficits, and the [[National debt of the United States|federal debt]] increased significantly during Reagan's tenure. Reagan signed the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]] (which simplified the tax code by reducing rates and removing several tax breaks) and the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]] (which enacted sweeping changes to U.S. immigration law and granted amnesty to three million [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]]). Reagan also appointed more [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal judges]] than any other president, including four [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justices.\n\nReagan's [[Foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration|foreign policy]] stance was resolutely [[anti-communism|anti-communist]]; its plan of action, known as the [[Reagan Doctrine]], sought to [[rollback|roll back]] the global influence of the [[Soviet Union]] in an attempt to end the Cold War. Under this doctrine, the Reagan administration initiated a massive buildup of the United States military; promoted new technologies such as missile defense systems; and, in 1983, undertook an [[invasion of Grenada]], the first major overseas action by U.S. troops since the end of the [[Vietnam War]]. The administration also created controversy by granting [[United States and state-sponsored terrorism|aid to paramilitary forces]] seeking to overthrow leftist governments, particularly in war-torn [[Central America]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Specifically, the Reagan administration engaged in covert arms sales to [[Iran]] to fund [[Contras|Contra]] rebels in Nicaragua that were fighting to overthrow their nation's socialist government; the resulting [[Iran\u2013Contra affair|scandal]] led to the conviction or resignation of several administration officials. During Reagan's second term, he sought closer relations with Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and the two leaders signed a major [[arms control]] agreement known as the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF Treaty]].\n\nLeaving office in 1989, Reagan held an approval rating of 68%. This rating matches the approval ratings of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Bill Clinton]] as the highest rating for a departing president in the modern era.<ref>{{cite web|title = A Look Back At The Polls|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-look-back-at-the-polls/|publisher = CBS News|access-date = May 15, 2015}}</ref> Historians and political scientists generally [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|rank]] Reagan as an above-average president. Due to Reagan's impact on public discourse and advocacy of [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]], some historians have described the period during and after his presidency as the [[Reagan Era]].\n\n==Conservative shift in politics==\n{{Further|Conservatism in the United States|Reagan Era}}\n\nEven prior to becoming president, Reagan was the leader of a dramatic conservative shift that undercut many of the domestic and foreign policies that had dominated the national agenda for decades.<ref>Bruce J. Schulman and Julian E. Zelizer, eds.

While distrust of high officials had been an American characteristic for two centuries, Watergate engendered heightened levels of suspicion and encouraged the media to engage in a vigorous search for scandals.<ref>J. Lull, and S. Hinerman, \"The search for scandal' in J. Lull & S. Hinerman, eds. ''Media scandals: Morality and desire in the popular culture marketplace'' (1997) pp. 1-33.</ref> An unexpected new factor was the emergence of the [[Christian right|religious right]] as a cohesive political force that gave strong support to conservatism.<ref>Paul Boyer, \"The Evangelical Resurgence in 1970s American Protestantism\" in Schulman and Zelizer, eds. ''Rightward bound'' pp 29-51.:</ref><ref>Stephen D. Johnson and Joseph B.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1385498 online]</ref>\n\nOther factors in the rise of the conservative movement the emergence of a \"[[culture war]]\" as a triangular battle among conservatives, traditional liberals, and the [[New Left]], involving such issues as individual freedom, divorce, sexual freedom, abortion, and homosexuality.<ref>James Davison Hunter, ''Culture wars:  The struggle to control the family, art, education, law, and politics in America'' (1992).</ref> A mass movement of population from the cities to the suburbs led to the creation of a new group of voters less attached to [[New Deal]] economic policies and [[political machine|machine politics]].<ref>Wilentz, pp. 23\u201324</ref> Meanwhile, it became socially acceptable for conservative Southern whites, especially well educated suburbanites, to vote Republican. Though the civil rights legislation of the 1960s had been a triumphal issue for liberalism and had created a new, pro-Democratic black electorate, it had also destroyed the argument that whites had to vote Democratic in order to protect segregation in the South.<ref>Earl Black and Merle Black, ''Politics and Society in the South'' (1989) p 249.</ref> Responding to these various trends, Reagan and other conservatives successfully presented conservative ideas as an alternative to a public that had grown disillusioned with New Deal liberalism and the Democratic Party.<ref>Wilentz, pp. 4\u20137</ref> Reagan's charisma and speaking skills helped him frame conservatism as an optimistic, forward-looking vision for the country.<ref>Wilentz, pp. 137\u2013138</ref>\n\n==1980 presidential election==\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1980.svg|right|thumb|1980 electoral vote results]]\n{{Main|Ronald Reagan 1980 presidential campaign|1980 United States presidential election}}\n\nReagan, who had served as [[Governor of California]] from 1967 to 1975, narrowly lost the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1976|1976 Republican presidential primaries]] to incumbent President [[Gerald Ford]]. With the defeat of Ford by Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]] in the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 election]], Reagan immediately became the front-runner for the 1980 Republican presidential nomination.<ref>Weisberg,\npp. 56-57</ref> A darling of the conservative movement, Reagan faced more moderate Republicans such as [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Howard Baker]], and [[Bob Dole]] in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1980|1980 Republican presidential primaries]]. After Bush won the Iowa caucuses, he became Reagan's primary challenger, but Reagan won the New Hampshire primary and most of the following primaries, gaining an insurmountable delegate lead by the end of March 1980. Ford was Reagan's first choice for his running mate, but Reagan backed away from the idea out of the fear of a \"copresidency\" in which Ford would exercise an unusual degree of power. Reagan instead chose Bush, and the Reagan-Bush ticket was nominated at the [[1980 Republican National Convention]]. Meanwhile, Carter won the Democratic nomination, defeating a primary challenge by Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]. Polls taken after the party conventions showed a tied race between Reagan and Carter, while independent candidate [[John B. Anderson]] had the support of many moderates.<ref>Weisberg, pp. 61-63</ref>\n\nThe 1980 general campaign between Reagan and Carter was conducted amid a multitude of domestic concerns and the ongoing [[Iran hostage crisis]]. After winning the Republican nomination, Reagan pivoted to the center. Though he continued to champion a major tax cut, Reagan backed off of his support for free trade and the privatization of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], and promised to consider [[arms control]] treaties with the [[Soviet Union]]. He instead sought to focus the race on Carter's handling of the economy. Mired with an approval rating in the low 30s, Carter also waged a negative campaign, focusing on the supposed risk of war if Reagan took office.<ref>Rossinow, pp. 23\u201327</ref>\n\nReagan and Carter met in one presidential debate, held just one week before election day. Reagan delivered an effective performance, asking voters, \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?...Is America as respected throughout the world as it was?\" Though the race had been widely regarded as a close contest, Reagan won over the large majority of undecided voters.<ref>Rossinow, pp. 27\u201328</ref> Reagan took 50.7% of the popular vote and 489 of the 538 electoral votes. Carter won 41% of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes, while Anderson won 6.6% of the popular vote. In the concurrent [[United States elections, 1980|congressional elections]], Republicans took control of the Senate for the first time since the 1950s, while Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives.<ref>Patterson, pp. 149\u2013151</ref>\n\n==Administration==\n\n{{Infobox U.S. Cabinet\n|align=right\n|Name=Reagan\n|President=Ronald Reagan\n|President start=1981\n|President end=1989\n|Vice President=[[George H.

Reagan and his foreign policy team were particularly concerned about the potential influence of [[Cuba]] on countries such as [[Grenada]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[El Salvador]]. To counter the influence of Cuba and the Soviet Union, Reagan launched the [[Caribbean Basin Initiative]], an economic program designed to aid countries opposed to Communism.

Casey to arm the right-wing [[Contras]]. Congress, which favored negotiations between the Contras and Sandinista, passed the 1982 [[Boland Amendment]], prohibiting the CIA and Defense Department from using their budgets to provide aid to the Contras. Still intent on supporting the Contras, the Reagan administration raised funds for the Contras from private donors and foreign governments.<ref>Weisberg, pp. 128-129</ref> When Congress learned that the CIA had secretly placed [[naval mine]]s in Nicaraguan harbors, Congress passed a second Boland Amendment that barred granting any assistance to the Contras.<ref>Patterson, pp. 208\u2013209</ref>\n\nDuring his second term, Reagan sought to find a way procure the release of seven American hostages held by [[Hezbollah]], a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] paramilitary group supported by Iran. The Reagan administration decided to sell American arms to Iran, then engaged in the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], in hopes that Iran would pressure Hezbollah to release the hostages.<ref name=\"weisberg129134\"/> Secretary of Defense Weinberger and Secretary of State Shultz both opposed the arrangement, so it was handled by National Security Advisor [[Robert McFarlane]] and McFarlane's successor, [[John Poindexter]].<ref>Patterson, pp. 209\u2013210</ref> The Reagan administration sold over 2000 missiles to Iran without informing Congress; Hezbollah released four hostages but captured an additional six Americans. On the initiative of [[Oliver North]], an aide on the National Security Council, the Reagan administration redirected the proceeds from the missile sales to the Contras.<ref name=\"weisberg129134\">Weisberg, pp. 129-134</ref> The transactions became public knowledge by early November 1986. Reagan initially denied any wrongdoing, but on November 25 he announced that Poindexter and North had left the administration and that he would form the [[Tower Commission]] to investigate the transactions. A few weeks later, Reagan asked a panel of federal judges to appoint a [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|special prosecutor]] who would conduct a separate investigation, and the panel chose [[Lawrence Walsh]].<ref>Patterson, pp. 210\u2013211</ref>\n\nThe Tower Commission, chaired by former Republican Senator [[John Tower]], released a report in February 1987 that confirmed that the administration had traded arms for hostages and sent the proceeds of the weapons sales to the Contras. The report laid most of the blame for the operation on North, Poindexter, and McFarlane, but it was also critical of Regan and other White House staffers.<ref>Brands, pp. 646-649</ref> In response to the Tower Commission report, Reagan stated, \"Its findings are honest, convincing and highly critical...As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities.\"<ref>Brands, pp. 650-653</ref> The [[Iran\u2013Contra scandal]], as it became known, did serious damage to the Reagan presidency, raising questions about Reagan's competency and the wisdom of conservative policies.<ref>Rossinow, pp. 202\u2013204</ref> A poll taken in March 1987 showed that 85 percent of respondents believed that the Reagan administration had engaged in an organized cover-up, and half of the respondents believed that Reagan had been personally involved.

Since his departure from the band, the musical project called [[Recoil (band)|Recoil]] became his primary musical enterprise, which initially started as a side project to Depeche Mode in 1986. Wilder has also provided production and remixing services to the bands [[Nitzer Ebb]] and [[Curve (band)|Curve]].\nHe is a classically trained musician.<ref>Bell, Max: \"[http://www.tuug.org/~jaakko/dm/dmtekstit/privateaw.html ALAN WILDER: THE BAND BOY] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040505/http://www.tuug.org/~jaakko/dm/dmtekstit/privateaw.html |date=4 March 2016}}\", PRIVATE LIVES \u2013 THE DEPECHE MODE STORY, 1985</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nAlan Charles Wilder was born into a [[middle class]] family and was raised in [[Acton, London|Acton]], [[West London (sub region)|West London]]. He began piano at the age of eight, through the encouragement of his parents. Later on, he learned the flute at [[St Clement Danes]] grammar school and became a leading musician in his school bands. After school, Alan worked as a studio assistant at DJM Studios. This led to him ending up working for bands such as The Dragons and Dafne & the Tenderspots (as Alan Normal). Others include Real to Real (featuring Adrian Chilvers on bass, Pete Fresh on guitar, Wolfgang Marlander on drums and Paul St. James on vocals), [[The Hitmen (British band)|The Hitmen]], and [[The Korgis]], appearing on the UK No.&nbsp;13 single \"If I Had You\" (1979).\n\n==1982\u20131995: Depeche Mode==\nFollowing the departure of [[Vince Clarke]], Depeche Mode placed an advertisement in the music magazine ''[[Melody Maker]]'': \"Keyboard player needed for established band \u2013 no timewasters.\" Even though the ad was looking for someone under 21 (Wilder was 22) he lied about his age to get the job, and got away with it. He joined Depeche Mode in January 1982, initially as a tour keyboardist, and soon thereafter as a full member of the recording band.\n\nWilder wrote a handful of songs for Depeche Mode, including \"Two Minute Warning\" and \"The Landscape Is Changing\" (and a B-side, \"Fools\") from the album ''[[Construction Time Again]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://music.thedigitalfix.com/content/review/2223/depeche-mode.html|archiveurl=http://archive.today/20120917231957/http://music.thedigitalfix.com/content/review/2223/depeche-mode.html|url-status=dead|title=Depeche Mode &#124; Review &#124; Music @ The Digital Fix|archivedate=November 28, 2019}}</ref> and \"If You Want\" (and a B-side, \"In Your Memory\") from the album ''[[Some Great Reward]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://music.thedigitalfix.com/content/review/2227/depeche-mode.html|archiveurl=http://archive.today/20120913005406/http://music.thedigitalfix.com/content/review/2227/depeche-mode.html|url-status=dead|title=Depeche Mode &#124; Review &#124; Music @ The Digital Fix|archivedate=November 28, 2019}}</ref> and finally co-wrote \"Black Day\" (and a B-side, \"Christmas Island\") from the album ''[[Black Celebration]]''.\nHowever, Wilder's more notable contributions to Depeche Mode were as a musician, arranger, and producer.\n\nIn addition to playing synthesizer throughout his time with Depeche Mode, Wilder also played piano on the band's signature ballad \"[[Blasphemous Rumours / Somebody|Somebody]],\" and oboe on the band's hit anthem, \"[[Everything Counts]].\" In the documentary film ''[[101 (album)|101]]'', Wilder demonstrates how different synthesizer parts of a song are split and arranged across a sampling keyboard for playing them live during the concert, just one small example of Wilder's ongoing contributions to Depeche Mode during his time as a member of the group. For the recording of the album ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]]'' and its corresponding [[Devotional Tour]], Wilder also played live drums.\n\nFor \"[[Enjoy the Silence]]\" from the album ''[[Violator (album)|Violator]]'', Wilder took Martin Gore's melancholy ballad-esque demo and re-envisioned the song as a percolating, melodic dance track.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.themusicfix.co.uk/content.php?contentid=2253 |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002243/http://www.themusicfix.co.uk/content.php?contentid=2253 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The resulting single went on to become one of the most commercially successful songs in Depeche Mode's history.\n\n===Departure===\nOn 26 June 1995, Wilder announced his departure from Depeche Mode:\n\n:\"Due to increasing dissatisfaction with the internal relations and working practices of the group, it is with some sadness that I have decided to part company from Depeche Mode. My decision to leave the group was not an easy one particularly as our last few albums were an indication of the full potential that Depeche Mode was realizing. Since joining in 1982, I have continually striven to give total energy, enthusiasm and commitment to the furthering of the group's success and in spite of a consistent imbalance in the distribution of the workload, willingly offered this. Unfortunately, within the group, this level of input never received the respect and acknowledgement that it warrants. Whilst I believe that the calibre of our musical output has improved, the quality of our association has deteriorated to the point where I no longer feel that the end justifies the means. I have no wish to cast aspersions on any individual; suffice to say that relations have become seriously strained, increasingly frustrating and, ultimately, in certain situations, intolerable. Given these circumstances, I have no option but to leave the group. It seems preferable therefore, to leave on a relative high, and as I still retain a great enthusiasm and passion for music, I am excited by the prospect of pursuing new projects. The remaining band members have my support and best wishes for anything they may pursue in the future, be it collectively or individually.\"\n\nAfter his split from Depeche Mode, Wilder was approached by [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] with an offer to join [[the Cure]].

During the encore, Wilder accompanied Martin Gore on piano for \"[[Blasphemous Rumours / Somebody|Somebody]]\". Gore returned the favour and played a DJ set on one of Recoil's Selected Events.\n\nIn 2011, Wilder provided two mixes for the Depeche Mode track \"In Chains\".\n\n==1986\u2013present: Recoil==\n===Side project===\nRecoil began in 1986 as a two-track experimental EP. Simply entitled ''[[1 + 2 (album)|1 + 2]]'', this collection of primitive demos caught the attention of [[Mute Records]] label boss [[Daniel Miller (music producer)|Daniel Miller]] and was inconspicuously released as a mini-album on 12\" vinyl. An album, ''[[Hydrology (album)|Hydrology]]'', soon followed in 1988 and both were eventually re-issued by Mute on CD as ''[[Hydrology (album)|Hydrology plus 1 + 2]]''. Wilder described the project at the time as \"an antidote to Depeche Mode; a way to alleviate the frustrations of always working within a pop format\".{{Cite quote|date=February 2009}}\n\nAlmost immediately, Wilder found himself back in the studio to record what would become the most successful Depeche Mode album to date, ''[[Violator (album)|Violator]]''. It wasn't until the band finally allowed themselves an extended break after the [[World Violation Tour]] that Alan could return to Recoil\u2014not, however, before agreeing to produce ''Ebbhead'', another album for label-mates [[Nitzer Ebb]].\n\nIt was during this time that he cemented a working relationship with lead singer Douglas McCarthy who would return the favour by singing on Recoil's next album, ''[[Bloodline (Recoil album)|Bloodline]]''. For the ''Bloodline'' LP, released in 1991, Wilder recruited guest vocalists for the first time, with further contributions from [[Toni Halliday]] and [[Moby]]. 'Bloodline' also marked the first Recoil single, a cover of [[Alex Harvey (musician)|Alex Harvey]]'s song 'Faith Healer' as well as 'Electro Blues For Bukka White', featuring the posthumously sampled voice of Blues-man White set into a post-modern context.\n\nBetween 1992\u201393 Wilder resumed his Depeche Mode duties as the band recorded the album ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]]''.  Depeche Mode embarked on their most adventurous tour to date, enduring a grueling fifteen months on the road. Although the group had reached the pinnacle of success, aspects of the lifestyle had taken their toll on everyone and things eventually came to a head. In June 1995, having spent fourteen years as an integral part of one of the most popular and influential bands the UK has ever produced, Alan Wilder made the decision to leave Depeche Mode.\n\n===Solo efforts===\nFree from his group commitments, Wilder could now focus solely on Recoil. In September 1996, he began work in his own studio, The Thin Line, gradually piecing together what would become Recoil's next album ''[[Unsound Methods]]''. Guest vocalists this time played a more up-front role than ever and featured [[Maggie Estep]], Siobhan Lynch, the reappearance of Douglas McCarthy, and Hildia Campbell.\n\nIn the spring of 2000, Recoil released ''[[Liquid (Recoil album)|Liquid]]'' which this time featured fellow Mute artist [[Diamanda Gal\u00e1s]], 1940s gospel crooners the [[Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet]], along with New York spoken-word performers [[Nicole Blackman]] and Samantha Coerbell.\n\nFollowing a five-year break from recording, Alan Wilder returned in 2007 with Recoil's fifth studio album, entitled ''[[SubHuman]]''.\n\n2010 saw the release of 'Selected', a selection of Recoil tracks chosen by Alan who explains: \"The collection is made up of my personal favourites, remastered and edited together into what I consider a cohesive and total listening experience.\u201d\n\nA tour entitled \u2018A Strange Hour\u2019 was presented during 2010 & 2011 in 52 cities across the world, as part of the \u2018Selected Events\u2019, which celebrated 25 years of the Recoil project. It signified the first time Recoil had ever taken to the road.  The events were not so much \u2018live\u2019 band but more art or video installation. Wilder gathered together filmmakers from as far as Russia, via the Czech Republic and Hungary, all the way to Argentina for this purpose, working very fast, and in the modern way, by creating a central server where everybody could upload their work for others to see, react to and feedback on.  Says Wilder: \u201cThis for me typifies the whole essence of what Recoil is all about \u2013 a collective but with a focused direction \u2013 and a very thrilling process it was too, watching and hearing \u2019A Strange Hour\u2019 come together from our base in the UK.\u201d\n\nRecoil returned in 2012 to release the concert film 'A Strange Hour In Budapest' on Blu-ray, with 5.1 surround sound, directed by Attila Herk\u00f3.\n\nAlso in 2012, we saw Alan Wilder turn up again as Executive Producer & contributor for a new tribute album to Mark Hollis & Talk Talk.  Recoil offered two cover versions for the album featuring the vocals of Linton Kwesi Johnson, Shara Worden and Paul Marshall.  Wilder also mixed a track for Richard Reed Parry from Arcade Fire. \u2018Spirit of Talk Talk\u2019 was released in September 2012 on Fierce Panda Records.\n\n==Discography==\n===Early work===\n* The Dragons \u2013 \"Misbehavin'\" (1977)\n* Dafne & The Tenderspots \u2013 \"Disco Hell\" (1979)\n* [[The Korgis]] \u2013 \"If I Had You\" (1979) UK No.&nbsp;13 (The track also appears on ''[[The Korgis (album)|The Korgis]]'', as well as all of the band's [[The Korgis#Compilations|compilation albums]].)\n* Real to Real \u2013 \"White Man Reggae\" (March 1980)\n* Real to Real \u2013 \"The Blue\" (1980)\n* Real to Real \u2013 ''Tightrope Walkers'' (November 1980)\n* Real to Real \u2013 \"Mr. and Mrs.\" (March 1981)\n* The Flatbackers  \u2013 \"Serenade of Love\" (1981)\n* The Hitmen  \u2013 \"Ouija\" (1981)\n\n===With Depeche Mode===\n{{Main|Depeche Mode discography}}\nWilder appeared on all of Depeche Mode's releases from \"[[Get the Balance Right!|Get the Balance Right]]\" (31 January 1983) up to \"[[In Your Room (Depeche Mode song)|In Your Room]]\" (10 January 1994), later taking part in reissues and compilations containing material from his time in the band.\n====Discography featuring Alan Wilder====\nStudio albums:\n* [[Construction Time Again]] (1983)\n* [[Some Great Reward]] (1984)\n* [[Black Celebration]] (1986)\n* [[Music for the Masses]] (1987)\n* [[Violator (album)|Violator]] (1990)\n* [[Songs of Faith and Devotion]] (1993)\n\nLive albums:\n* [[101 (album)|101]] (1989)\n* [[Songs of Faith and Devotion Live]] (1993)\n\nCompilations:\n* [[People Are People (album)|People Are People]] (1984) - all tracks, excepting: \"Now This Is Fun\" and \"[[Leave In Silence]]\".\n* [[The Singles 81\u219285]] (1985) - all tracks, excepting: \"[[Dreaming of Me]]\", \"[[New Life (song)|New Life]]\", \"[[Just Can't Get Enough (Depeche Mode song)|Just Can't Get Enough]]\", \"[[See You (Depeche Mode song)|See You]]\", \"[[The Meaning of Love]]\" (only on the CD version) and \"[[Leave in Silence]]\";

He began piano at the age of eight, through the encouragement of his parents. Later on, he learned the flute at [[St Clement Danes]] grammar school and became a leading musician in his school bands. After school, Alan worked as a studio assistant at DJM Studios. This led to him ending up working for bands such as The Dragons and Dafne & the Tenderspots (as Alan Normal). Others include Real to Real (featuring Adrian Chilvers on bass, Pete Fresh on guitar, Wolfgang Marlander on drums and Paul St. James on vocals), [[The Hitmen (British band)|The Hitmen]], and [[The Korgis]], appearing on the UK No.&nbsp;13 single \"If I Had You\" (1979).\n\n==1982\u20131995: Depeche Mode==\nFollowing the departure of [[Vince Clarke]], Depeche Mode placed an advertisement in the music magazine ''[[Melody Maker]]'': \"Keyboard player needed for established band \u2013 no timewasters.\" Even though the ad was looking for someone under 21 (Wilder was 22) he lied about his age to get the job, and got away with it. He joined Depeche Mode in January 1982, initially as a tour keyboardist, and soon thereafter as a full member of the recording band.\n\nWilder wrote a handful of songs for Depeche Mode, including \"Two Minute Warning\" and \"The Landscape Is Changing\" (and a B-side, \"Fools\") from the album ''[[Construction Time Again]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://music.thedigitalfix.com/content/review/2223/depeche-mode.html|archiveurl=http://archive.today/20120917231957/http://music.thedigitalfix.com/content/review/2223/depeche-mode.html|url-status=dead|title=Depeche Mode &#124; Review &#124; Music @ The Digital Fix|archivedate=November 28, 2019}}</ref> and \"If You Want\" (and a B-side, \"In Your Memory\") from the album ''[[Some Great Reward]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://music.thedigitalfix.com/content/review/2227/depeche-mode.html|archiveurl=http://archive.today/20120913005406/http://music.thedigitalfix.com/content/review/2227/depeche-mode.html|url-status=dead|title=Depeche Mode &#124; Review &#124; Music @ The Digital Fix|archivedate=November 28, 2019}}</ref> and finally co-wrote \"Black Day\" (and a B-side, \"Christmas Island\") from the album ''[[Black Celebration]]''.\nHowever, Wilder's more notable contributions to Depeche Mode were as a musician, arranger, and producer.\n\nIn addition to playing synthesizer throughout his time with Depeche Mode, Wilder also played piano on the band's signature ballad \"[[Blasphemous Rumours / Somebody|Somebody]],\" and oboe on the band's hit anthem, \"[[Everything Counts]].\" In the documentary film ''[[101 (album)|101]]'', Wilder demonstrates how different synthesizer parts of a song are split and arranged across a sampling keyboard for playing them live during the concert, just one small example of Wilder's ongoing contributions to Depeche Mode during his time as a member of the group. For the recording of the album ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]]'' and its corresponding [[Devotional Tour]], Wilder also played live drums.\n\nFor \"[[Enjoy the Silence]]\" from the album ''[[Violator (album)|Violator]]'', Wilder took Martin Gore's melancholy ballad-esque demo and re-envisioned the song as a percolating, melodic dance track.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.themusicfix.co.uk/content.php?contentid=2253 |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002243/http://www.themusicfix.co.uk/content.php?contentid=2253 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The resulting single went on to become one of the most commercially successful songs in Depeche Mode's history.\n\n===Departure===\nOn 26 June 1995, Wilder announced his departure from Depeche Mode:\n\n:\"Due to increasing dissatisfaction with the internal relations and working practices of the group, it is with some sadness that I have decided to part company from Depeche Mode. My decision to leave the group was not an easy one particularly as our last few albums were an indication of the full potential that Depeche Mode was realizing. Since joining in 1982, I have continually striven to give total energy, enthusiasm and commitment to the furthering of the group's success and in spite of a consistent imbalance in the distribution of the workload, willingly offered this. Unfortunately, within the group, this level of input never received the respect and acknowledgement that it warrants. Whilst I believe that the calibre of our musical output has improved, the quality of our association has deteriorated to the point where I no longer feel that the end justifies the means. I have no wish to cast aspersions on any individual; suffice to say that relations have become seriously strained, increasingly frustrating and, ultimately, in certain situations, intolerable.

Guest vocalists this time played a more up-front role than ever and featured [[Maggie Estep]], Siobhan Lynch, the reappearance of Douglas McCarthy, and Hildia Campbell.\n\nIn the spring of 2000, Recoil released ''[[Liquid (Recoil album)|Liquid]]'' which this time featured fellow Mute artist [[Diamanda Gal\u00e1s]], 1940s gospel crooners the [[Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet]], along with New York spoken-word performers [[Nicole Blackman]] and Samantha Coerbell.\n\nFollowing a five-year break from recording, Alan Wilder returned in 2007 with Recoil's fifth studio album, entitled ''[[SubHuman]]''.\n\n2010 saw the release of 'Selected', a selection of Recoil tracks chosen by Alan who explains: \"The collection is made up of my personal favourites, remastered and edited together into what I consider a cohesive and total listening experience.\u201d\n\nA tour entitled \u2018A Strange Hour\u2019 was presented during 2010 & 2011 in 52 cities across the world, as part of the \u2018Selected Events\u2019, which celebrated 25 years of the Recoil project. It signified the first time Recoil had ever taken to the road.  The events were not so much \u2018live\u2019 band but more art or video installation. Wilder gathered together filmmakers from as far as Russia, via the Czech Republic and Hungary, all the way to Argentina for this purpose, working very fast, and in the modern way, by creating a central server where everybody could upload their work for others to see, react to and feedback on.  Says Wilder: \u201cThis for me typifies the whole essence of what Recoil is all about \u2013 a collective but with a focused direction \u2013 and a very thrilling process it was too, watching and hearing \u2019A Strange Hour\u2019 come together from our base in the UK.\u201d\n\nRecoil returned in 2012 to release the concert film 'A Strange Hour In Budapest' on Blu-ray, with 5.1 surround sound, directed by Attila Herk\u00f3.\n\nAlso in 2012, we saw Alan Wilder turn up again as Executive Producer & contributor for a new tribute album to Mark Hollis & Talk Talk.  Recoil offered two cover versions for the album featuring the vocals of Linton Kwesi Johnson, Shara Worden and Paul Marshall.  Wilder also mixed a track for Richard Reed Parry from Arcade Fire. \u2018Spirit of Talk Talk\u2019 was released in September 2012 on Fierce Panda Records.\n\n==Discography==\n===Early work===\n* The Dragons \u2013 \"Misbehavin'\" (1977)\n* Dafne & The Tenderspots \u2013 \"Disco Hell\" (1979)\n* [[The Korgis]] \u2013 \"If I Had You\" (1979) UK No.&nbsp;13 (The track also appears on ''[[The Korgis (album)|The Korgis]]'', as well as all of the band's [[The Korgis#Compilations|compilation albums]].)\n* Real to Real \u2013 \"White Man Reggae\" (March 1980)\n* Real to Real \u2013 \"The Blue\" (1980)\n* Real to Real \u2013 ''Tightrope Walkers'' (November 1980)\n* Real to Real \u2013 \"Mr. and Mrs.\" (March 1981)\n* The Flatbackers  \u2013 \"Serenade of Love\" (1981)\n* The Hitmen  \u2013 \"Ouija\" (1981)\n\n===With Depeche Mode===\n{{Main|Depeche Mode discography}}\nWilder appeared on all of Depeche Mode's releases from \"[[Get the Balance Right!|Get the Balance Right]]\" (31 January 1983) up to \"[[In Your Room (Depeche Mode song)|In Your Room]]\" (10 January 1994), later taking part in reissues and compilations containing material from his time in the band.\n==Discography featuring Alan Wilder==\nStudio albums:\n* [[Construction Time Again]] (1983)\n* [[Some Great Reward]] (1984)\n* [[Black Celebration]] (1986)\n* [[Music for the Masses]] (1987)\n* [[Violator (album)|Violator]] (1990)\n* [[Songs of Faith and Devotion]] (1993)\n\nLive albums:\n* [[101 (album)|101]] (1989)\n* [[Songs of Faith and Devotion Live]] (1993)\n\nCompilations:\n* [[People Are People (album)|People Are People]] (1984) - all tracks, excepting: \"Now This Is Fun\" and \"[[Leave In Silence]]\".\n* [[The Singles 81\u219285]] (1985) - all tracks, excepting: \"[[Dreaming of Me]]\", \"[[New Life (song)|New Life]]\", \"[[Just Can't Get Enough (Depeche Mode song)|Just Can't Get Enough]]\", \"[[See You (Depeche Mode song)|See You]]\", \"[[The Meaning of Love]]\" (only on the CD version) and \"[[Leave in Silence]]\";
