It is produced by [[Spin Master|Spin Master Entertainment]], with animation provided by [[Guru Studio]]. In Canada, the series is primarily broadcast on [[TVOntario]], which first ran previews of the show in August 2013. The series premiered on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States on August 12, 2013.\n\nThe series focuses on a young boy named Ryder who leads a crew of [[search and rescue dogs]] that call themselves the PAW Patrol. They work together on missions to protect the shoreside community of Adventure Bay. Each dog has a specific set of skills based on [[emergency services]] professions, such as a [[firefighter]], a [[police officer]], and an [[aircraft pilot|aviation pilot]]. They all reside in [[doghouse]]s that transform into customized [[vehicles]] for their missions. They are also equipped with backpacks called \"pup packs\" that contain tools that relate to the pups' jobs.\n\nSpin Master has developed the show into a [[media franchise]] and released an ongoing line of toys based on it. ''PAW Patrol'' toy sales have generated millions of dollars in revenue for the corporation and increased Spin Master's presence in the preschool toy market.<ref name=\"financialpost\">{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/paw-patrol-has-spin-master-on-a-roll-as-earnings-exceed-analyst-expectations|title=PAW Patrol has Spin Master on a roll as earnings exceed analyst expectations|work=[[Financial Post]]|publisher=[[Sun Media]]|date=May 16, 2016|author=Damon van der Linde|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902211158/http://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/paw-patrol-has-spin-master-on-a-roll-as-earnings-exceed-analyst-expectations|archivedate=2 September 2016}}</ref> The show, and its associated products, have received a variety of awards and nominations from associations such as the [[Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television]] and the [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]].\n\nOn June 4, 2019, the series was renewed for a seventh season of 26 half hour episodes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nickelodeon Renews Four Hit Series from Its Powerhouse Preschool Portfolio|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/06/04/nickelodeon-renews-four-hit-series-from-its-powerhouse-preschool-portfolio-291402/20190604nickelodeon01/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=June 4, 2019}}</ref> In the United States, select episodes are available to stream on [[Noggin (brand)#Mobile applications|Noggin]], for free with [[TV Everywhere]] authentication on Nickelodeon's app and with a public library card through the [[Hoopla (digital media service)|Hoopla]] app.\n\nOn February 19, 2020, the series was renewed for an eighth season of 26 half hour episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/02/nickelodeon-renewals-are-you-afraid-of-the-dark-all-that-paw-patrol-blues-clues-the-casagrandes-top-elf-1202862741/|title='Are You Afraid Of The Dark?', 'All That', 'Top Elf,' 'Blue\u2019s Clues', 'The Casagrandes' & 'PAW Patrol' Among Slew Of Nickelodeon Renewals|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|author=Patrick Hipes|date=February 19, 2020|access-date=February 19, 2020}}</ref> A theatrical feature film, titled ''PAW Patrol: The Movie'', is scheduled for an August 2021 release.\n\n==Format==\nEach episode of ''PAW Patrol'' follows a similar pattern and features recurring topics. Episodes normally open with a scene depicting the dogs going about their everyday lives, often playing with [[dog toy]]s or engaging in activities at the local playground. Ryder, a ten-year-old boy, is advised of a problem by receiving a call for help or by witnessing a situation himself. His most frequent caller is an accident-prone [[marine biology|marine biologist]] named Cap'n Turbot, who knows much about Adventure Bay's wildlife. Ryder always alerts the dogs via their blinking [[pet tag]]s. The team members report to their base, the Lookout, and enter its elevator. Marshall typically arrives last causing a humorous mishap that makes the other dogs laugh as the elevator rises. When they reach the top floor, they arrange themselves in a line. Chase announces that the team is ready for action as Ryder tells the pups what has happened. He chooses several members of the team, normally two [[first responder]]s, to help solve whatever problem has emerged. They ride a slide down to their vehicles and complete their mission. When they have finished, Ryder says his catchphrase: \"Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help!\", and congratulates the pups.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of PAW Patrol episodes}}\n{{:List of PAW Patrol episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===PAW Patrol members===\n[[File:PAW Patrol main characters, cast promo art.png|thumb|right|385px|The illustrated designs of the entire PAW Patrol team as of Tracker's introduction.]]\n\n====Original members====\n* {{visible anchor|Ryder}} is a 10-year-old boy and the leader of the PAW Patrol.

Chapman sketched early designs of the PAW Patrol team under the working title ''Raffi & the Rescue Dogs''. Spin Master hired toy designers to develop the format further; after the concept was in place, they began designing merchandise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/business/20141126/hollywood-helps-make-southern-california-center-of-toy-universe|title=Hollywood helps make Southern California center of toy universe|work=[[Daily Breeze]]|publisher=[[Digital First Media]]|date=November 26, 2014|accessdate=August 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809074257/http://www.dailybreeze.com/business/20141126/hollywood-helps-make-southern-california-center-of-toy-universe|archive-date=August 9, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nChapman's original pitch focused on the idea that the six PAW Patrol dogs were rescued by Ryder before joining the team. [[Scott Kraft]], the show's first writer, and Jamie Whitney, the show's first director, decided to abandon the rescued dog theme in 2012. The name of the series' protagonist, Ryder, was changed multiple times during production; he was originally called Raffi, Roddy, and Robbie before Spin Master settled on Ryder.\n\n[[File:PAW Patrol original character designs.png|thumb|Early models of the ''PAW Patrol'' pups.]]\nAccording to a 2017 Spin Master interview, \"everything pup-related was debated endlessly: names, sizes, ages, breeds.\"<ref name=\"globeandmail\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/whats-paw-patrols-secret-how-it-captivated-children-and-conquered-theworld/article37417532/|title=What's Paw Patrol's secret?

The visual appearance of Cap'n Turbot, mainly his distinctive bead eyes and large nose, was based on the design of Chapman's Bob the Builder character. Ryder's hairstyle was based on that of Ronnen Harary.<ref name=\"globeandmail\" />\n\nIn January 2012, Spin Master began approaching television broadcasters.

It is produced by [[Spin Master|Spin Master Entertainment]], with animation provided by [[Guru Studio]]. In Canada, the series is primarily broadcast on [[TVOntario]], which first ran previews of the show in August 2013. The series premiered on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States on August 12, 2013.\n\nThe series focuses on a young boy named Ryder who leads a crew of [[search and rescue dogs]] that call themselves the PAW Patrol. They work together on missions to protect the shoreside community of Adventure Bay. Each dog has a specific set of skills based on [[emergency services]] professions, such as a [[firefighter]], a [[police officer]], and an [[aircraft pilot|aviation pilot]]. They all reside in [[doghouse]]s that transform into customized [[vehicles]] for their missions. They are also equipped with backpacks called \"pup packs\" that contain tools that relate to the pups' jobs.\n\nSpin Master has developed the show into a [[media franchise]] and released an ongoing line of toys based on it. ''PAW Patrol'' toy sales have generated millions of dollars in revenue for the corporation and increased Spin Master's presence in the preschool toy market.<ref name=\"financialpost\">{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/paw-patrol-has-spin-master-on-a-roll-as-earnings-exceed-analyst-expectations|title=PAW Patrol has Spin Master on a roll as earnings exceed analyst expectations|work=[[Financial Post]]|publisher=[[Sun Media]]|date=May 16, 2016|author=Damon van der Linde|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902211158/http://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/paw-patrol-has-spin-master-on-a-roll-as-earnings-exceed-analyst-expectations|archivedate=2 September 2016}}</ref> The show, and its associated products, have received a variety of awards and nominations from associations such as the [[Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television]] and the [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]].\n\nOn June 4, 2019, the series was renewed for a seventh season of 26 half hour episodes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nickelodeon Renews Four Hit Series from Its Powerhouse Preschool Portfolio|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/06/04/nickelodeon-renews-four-hit-series-from-its-powerhouse-preschool-portfolio-291402/20190604nickelodeon01/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=June 4, 2019}}</ref> In the United States, select episodes are available to stream on [[Noggin (brand)#Mobile applications|Noggin]], for free with [[TV Everywhere]] authentication on Nickelodeon's app and with a public library card through the [[Hoopla (digital media service)|Hoopla]] app.\n\nOn February 19, 2020, the series was renewed for an eighth season of 26 half hour episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/02/nickelodeon-renewals-are-you-afraid-of-the-dark-all-that-paw-patrol-blues-clues-the-casagrandes-top-elf-1202862741/|title='Are You Afraid Of The Dark?', 'All That', 'Top Elf,' 'Blue\u2019s Clues', 'The Casagrandes' & 'PAW Patrol' Among Slew Of Nickelodeon Renewals|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|author=Patrick Hipes|date=February 19, 2020|access-date=February 19, 2020}}</ref> A theatrical feature film, titled ''PAW Patrol: The Movie'', is scheduled for an August 2021 release.\n\n==Format==\nEach episode of ''PAW Patrol'' follows a similar pattern and features recurring topics. Episodes normally open with a scene depicting the dogs going about their everyday lives, often playing with [[dog toy]]s or engaging in activities at the local playground. Ryder, a ten-year-old boy, is advised of a problem by receiving a call for help or by witnessing a situation himself. His most frequent caller is an accident-prone [[marine biology|marine biologist]] named Cap'n Turbot, who knows much about Adventure Bay's wildlife. Ryder always alerts the dogs via their blinking [[pet tag]]s. The team members report to their base, the Lookout, and enter its elevator. Marshall typically arrives last causing a humorous mishap that makes the other dogs laugh as the elevator rises. When they reach the top floor, they arrange themselves in a line. Chase announces that the team is ready for action as Ryder tells the pups what has happened. He chooses several members of the team, normally two [[first responder]]s, to help solve whatever problem has emerged. They ride a slide down to their vehicles and complete their mission. When they have finished, Ryder says his catchphrase: \"Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help!\", and congratulates the pups.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of PAW Patrol episodes}}\n{{:List of PAW Patrol episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===PAW Patrol members===\n[[File:PAW Patrol main characters, cast promo art.png|thumb|right|385px|The illustrated designs of the entire PAW Patrol team as of Tracker's introduction.]]\n\n====Original members====\n* {{visible anchor|Ryder}} is a 10-year-old boy and the leader of the PAW Patrol.

Chapman sketched early designs of the PAW Patrol team under the working title ''Raffi & the Rescue Dogs''. Spin Master hired toy designers to develop the format further; after the concept was in place, they began designing merchandise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/business/20141126/hollywood-helps-make-southern-california-center-of-toy-universe|title=Hollywood helps make Southern California center of toy universe|work=[[Daily Breeze]]|publisher=[[Digital First Media]]|date=November 26, 2014|accessdate=August 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809074257/http://www.dailybreeze.com/business/20141126/hollywood-helps-make-southern-california-center-of-toy-universe|archive-date=August 9, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nChapman's original pitch focused on the idea that the six PAW Patrol dogs were rescued by Ryder before joining the team. [[Scott Kraft]], the show's first writer, and Jamie Whitney, the show's first director, decided to abandon the rescued dog theme in 2012. The name of the series' protagonist, Ryder, was changed multiple times during production; he was originally called Raffi, Roddy, and Robbie before Spin Master settled on Ryder.\n\n[[File:PAW Patrol original character designs.png|thumb|Early models of the ''PAW Patrol'' pups.]]\nAccording to a 2017 Spin Master interview, \"everything pup-related was debated endlessly: names, sizes, ages, breeds.\"<ref name=\"globeandmail\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/whats-paw-patrols-secret-how-it-captivated-children-and-conquered-theworld/article37417532/|title=What's Paw Patrol's secret?

The visual appearance of Cap'n Turbot, mainly his distinctive bead eyes and large nose, was based on the design of Chapman's Bob the Builder character. Ryder's hairstyle was based on that of Ronnen Harary.<ref name=\"globeandmail\" />\n\nIn January 2012, Spin Master began approaching television broadcasters.

He was the first [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|No. 617 Squadron]], which he led in the [[Operation Chastise|\"Dam Busters\" raid]] in 1943, resulting in the breaching of two large dams in the [[Ruhr area]] of Germany. He was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces, in the aftermath of the raid in May 1943 and became the most highly decorated British serviceman at that time.<ref name=\"decoration\"/> He completed over 170 war operations before dying in action at the age of 26.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life and education==\nGibson was born in [[Shimla|Simla]], India, on 12 August 1918, the son of Alexander James Gibson and his wife Leonora (\"Nora\") Mary Gibson.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=7}}.</ref> At the time of Gibson's birth, his father was an officer in the [[Indian Forest Service|Imperial Indian Forestry Service]], becoming the Chief Conservator of Forests for the [[Hill States of India|Simla Hill States]] in 1922.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=9}}.</ref> In 1924, when he was six, his parents separated.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=13}}.</ref> His mother was granted custody of Gibson, his elder brother Alexander (\"Alick\") and sister Joan, and decided to return to England.<ref name=\"Ottaway 2009 17\">{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=17}}.</ref>\n\nAs her family came from [[Porthleven]], Cornwall, Nora Gibson settled first in [[Penzance]]. Gibson started school in England at the same school as his sister, West Cornwall College.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=14}}.</ref> His mother then moved to London and he was sent as a boarder to Earl's Avenue School, a [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]], later known as St George's, in [[Folkestone]], Kent.<ref name=\"Ottaway 2009 17\"/>\n\nIn 1932 Gibson started at [[St Edward's School, Oxford]], the same school as [[Douglas Bader]] where he was also placed in the same house, Cowell's. Gibson's housemaster was A. F. \"Freddie\" Yorke who became Gibson's guardian.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=13}}.</ref>\n\nFollowing her return from India, Gibson's mother developed a drinking problem which escalated into [[alcoholism]]. Her behaviour became increasingly erratic and sometimes violent towards her children.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|pp=18\u201319}}.</ref> The school organised lodgings for Gibson and his brother during the school holidays. Nora's younger sister, Mrs Beatrice (\"Gwennie\") Christopher, gave Gibson his own room at her house. Her husband, John, helped Nora out with school fees. They also both attended some school functions to support their nephews.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|pp=25\u201326}}.</ref>\n\nGibson was an average student academically and played for the Rugby Second XV. His interests included science and photography. At one stage as a teenager, he seems to have become interested and quite expert in the workings of [[Theatre organ|cinema organs]]. He read all kinds of books, especially the [[King Arthur|Arthurian legends]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. His favourite play was ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|pp=23\u201324}}.</ref> He was made a house [[Prefect#Academic|prefect]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=29}}.</ref>\n\nFrom an early age Gibson wanted to fly. He had a picture of his boyhood hero, [[Albert Ball|Albert Ball VC]], the First World War [[flying ace]], on his bedroom wall at his aunt's house. His ambition was to become a civilian test pilot. He wrote for advice to [[Vickers]], receiving a reply from their chief test pilot, Captain [[Joseph Summers|Joseph \"Mutt\" Summers]], who wrote that Gibson should first learn to fly by joining the RAF on a short service commission. Gibson applied to the RAF, but was rejected when he failed the Medical Board; the probable reason that his legs were too short. His later application was successful, and his personal file included the remark \"satisfactory leg length test carried out\". He commenced a short service commission in November 1936.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|pp=30\u201331}}.</ref>\n\n==Initial military service==\n===Initial military training===\nGibson commenced his flying training on 16 November 1936 at the Bristol Flying School, [[RAF Yatesbury|Yatesbury]], with No. 6 Flying Training Course and with civilian instructors. Owing to poor weather the course did not conclude until 1 January 1937. After some leave, he then moved to No. 24 (Training) Group at [[RAF Uxbridge]] for his RAF basic training. He was commissioned with the rank of [[acting pilot officer]] with effect from 31 January 1937.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=18}}</ref>{{sfn|Gazette|34371|p=1086}} He then underwent further flying training as a member of the junior section of No. 5 Flying Training Course at 6 Flying Training School, [[RAF Netheravon]]. He was awarded his [[Aviator badge#United Kingdom|pilot's wings]] on 24 May 1937.\n\nAs part of the Advanced Training Squadron, during summer 1937, he participated in further training at [[RAF Sutton Bridge|No. 3 Armament Training Station]], [[Sutton Bridge#Wartime Sutton Bridge|Sutton Bridge]], Lincolnshire. He opted for bombers as these gave experience in multi-engined planes, this being typical for individuals planning on a civilian flying career. He returned to Netheravon and graduated on 31 August 1937. He passed all his ground exams first time, with an average of 77.29% and a flying rating of \"average\".<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=17\u201321}}.</ref> However, his rating as a companion was below average owing to his sometimes rude and condescending behaviour towards junior ranks and ground crews in particular.{{sfn|Hastings|2005|p=218}}\n\n===No. 83 (Bomber) Squadron===\nGibson's initial posting was to [[No. 83 Squadron RAF|No. 83 (Bomber) Squadron]], stationed at [[Edinburgh Airport|RAF Turnhouse]], west of [[Edinburgh]]. He was assigned to 'A' Flight and was placed under the supervision of [[Pilot Officer]] Anthony \"Oscar\" Bridgman. The Squadron was flying [[Hawker Hind]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=25\u201326}}.</ref> He joined a settled group of officers from similar minor public school backgrounds. As some stayed with the squadron for a few years, promotion was slow. He was promoted to [[pilot officer]] on 16 November 1937.<ref name=\"Morris 1994 28\u201329\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=28\u201329}}.</ref>{{sfn|Gazette|34457|p=7352}} His behaviour towards the ground crews continued to be perceived as unsatisfactory and they gave him the nickname the \"Bumptious Bastard\".<ref name=\"Morris 1994 30\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=30}}.</ref>\n\nIn March 1938, the Squadron was transferred from [[No. 2 Group RAF|No. 2 Group]] to [[No. 5 Group RAF|No. 5 Group]] and relocated to [[RAF Scampton]]. In June they moved to [[RAF Leuchars]] for an armaments training camp.<ref name = \"ott34\">{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=34}}.</ref> From October the squadron started their conversion to the [[Handley Page Hampden]], which was completed by January 1939.<ref name = \"ott36\">{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=36}}.</ref> At a Court of Inquiry in October 1938, Gibson was found guilty of negligence after a taxiing incident at [[RAF Hemswell]].<ref name=\"Morris 1994 28\u201329\"/> He spent Christmas Day 1938 in hospital at [[RAF Rauceby]] with [[chickenpox]]. He was then sent on convalescent leave, returning to the squadron in late January.<ref name=\"ott36\"/>\n\nIn Spring 1939 the squadron took part in an armaments training camp at [[HMS Fieldfare|RAF Evanton]] near [[Invergordon]] in Scotland.<ref name=\"Morris 1994 30\"/> With the likelihood of war increasing and as part of a plan to improve standards, Gibson was sent on a navigation course at [[Hamble-le-Rice|Hamble]] near [[Southampton]]. He did not appear to take the course seriously, but passed with an average mark. The instructor added the comment \"could do well\". He was due to leave the RAF, but was retained owing to the outbreak of hostilities in Abyssinia.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=33}}.</ref> In June he was promoted to flying officer.<ref name = \"ott37\">{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=37}}.</ref>{{sfn|Gazette|34700|p=6659}} On 25 July the squadron made a long-distance flight to the south of France. They participated in Home Defence exercises over London in August. He then went on his summer leave. At this stage of his career, he had never flown or landed a plane at night.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=35\u201336}}.</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n\n===First operational tour: No. 83 Squadron, Bomber Command===\nGibson was recalled from leave back to Scampton by telegram on 31 August 1939. Gibson flew on 3 September 1939, two days after the start of the Second World War. He was one of the pilots selected to attack the German fleet, which was near [[Bombing of Wilhelmshaven in World War II|Wilhelmshaven]]. He took off at 18:15. The operation was aborted owing to bad weather and he landed back at Scampton around 23:00. On 5 September while in the Mess, he was bitten by a dog. His arm was put in a sling and he was granted 36 hours leave. This allowed him to attend his brother's wedding in Rugby, where he was Alick's best man. On his return, the squadron had moved to [[Manchester Airport|Ringway]] near [[Manchester]] under the Scatter Scheme. They were there for 10 days. The squadron did not fly on another operation until December, during the [[Phoney War]].<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=37\u201340}}.</ref>\n\nIn February 1940, Gibson was one of the members of the squadron put on temporary secondment to [[Coastal Command]] at [[RAF Lossiemouth]]. On 27 February, he participated in an operation that was sent to attack a [[U-Boat]]. However, owing to various communications problems, one of the aircraft dropped its bombs on a [[Royal Navy]] [[submarine]]. The senior officers involved with the incident were censured for their failure to bring the squadron up to a satisfactory standard. The squadron then underwent a period of intensive training.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=50\u201353}}.</ref>\n\nThe period from April to September 1940 was one of the most operationally intense periods of Gibson's career. He completed 34 operations in 5 months, with 10 in June. The type of operation varied from [[Glossary of RAF code names|\"gardening\"]] \u2013 laying mines in various seaways and harbour entrances \u2013 to attacks on capital ships, as well as attacks on ground-based military and economic targets. During this time, he acquired a reputation for being seemingly fearless, particularly as he was willing to fly in marginal weather. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) on 9 July 1940.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=66}}.</ref>{{sfn|Gazette|34892|p=4177}} He was trained for a low-level attack on the [[Dortmund-Ems canal]], but he missed the actual raid on 12 August. On his return from a raid on [[Lorient]] on 27 August, he spotted a [[Dornier Do 215]] and attacked it. He was credited with a \"probable\" kill. He was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] on 3 September 1940.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=59}}.</ref>{{sfn|Gazette|34996|p=6633}}  His last operation with the squadron was to [[Berlin]] on 23 September 1940. [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]], then the [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) No. 5 Group, later described Gibson as the \"most full-out fighting pilot\" under his command at this time.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=72}}.</ref>\n\nAs was usual practice, to give pilots a rest from operations, Gibson was posted as a flying instructor to No. 14 [[Operational Training Unit]] (OTU) at [[RAF Cottesmore]]. He was there for two weeks, part of which was spent on leave, but he did not settle. He was then transferred to No. 16 OTU at [[RAF Upper Heyford]]. Meanwhile, Air Marshal [[Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside|Sholto Douglas]], [[Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]], and Air Vice Marshal [[Trafford Leigh-Mallory]], AOC [[No. 12 Group RAF|No. 12 (Fighter) Group]], made an appeal to Harris for bomber pilots with their night-flying experience to fly night fighters. Gibson volunteered. Harris wrote a letter introducing the pilots, which included the comment \"a hand-picked bunch of which Gibson is the best\". Harris agreed to help Gibson's career when he had completed this tour with \"the best command within my power\".<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=72\u201374}}.</ref>\n\n===Second operational tour: No. 29 Squadron, Fighter Command===\nGibson was ordered to report on 13 November 1940 to [[No. 29 Squadron RAF|No. 29 Squadron]] as the commander of 'A' Flight. The squadron was stationed at [[RAF Digby]], but flew from a small satellite field at [[RAF Wellingore]] about six miles away. The officers' mess was nearby in The Grange. When he arrived, the Commanding Officer, [[Squadron Leader]] Charles Widdows, was in the process of rebuilding the squadron following an outbreak of indiscipline that nearly led to its disbandment during July 1940. He was weeding out under-performing pilots and replacing his flight commanders. Gibson attracted some hostility from some longer-standing members of the squadron. because as one of these new flight commanders, he was seen as part of Widdows' reforms and he had been chosen over an existing member of the squadron. He had also come from a Bomber squadron. The root cause of the low morale was a lack of combat success. The [[Bristol Blenheim]] was not designed as a night fighter and the [[airborne interception]] (AI) was still in its very early days of development. Also, Widdows was required to split the squadron up with a few pilots each at Ternhill, Kirton and Wittering and with no more than half at Digby at any one time. Gibson flew six operations in Blenheims.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=77\u201379}}.</ref>\n\nThe squadron started to convert to the [[Bristol Beaufighter|Bristol Beaufighter I]] and Widdows personally supervised his pilots during their conversion.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=79}}.</ref> Gibson's first flight in a Beaufighter was on 1 December 1940. He then undertook some intensive training on AI procedure. He found the night-fighter culture very different from bombers as the two-man crew had to work as a team with the pilot relying on the guidance of the AI operator t<nowiki/>o find their targets. Gibson made his first operational flight in a Beaufighter on 10 December with Sergeant Taylor as his AI operator. That winter saw bad weather and he flew only three operations in the whole of January. He claimed a kill on 12 March, but it was not confirmed.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=88}}.</ref> However, his kill on 14 March was confirmed as a [[Heinkel He 111]]. He went to [[Skegness]] to collect the tail assembly as trophy for the squadron and the crew's dinghy for himself.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=89\u201390}}.</ref> He was attacked by an intruder when landing at Wellingore on 8 April. Gibson was unharmed, but his AI operator, Sergeant Bell, was injured in the leg.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=90\u201391}}.</ref>\n\nIn April, Widdows obtained a transfer for the squadron from 12 to 11 Group and a move to [[RAF West Malling]] in Kent. Gibson flew down with him on 25 April to inspect the facilities. The full squadron flew down on 29 April.<ref name=\"Morris 1994 91\u201392\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=91\u201392}}.</ref> Gibson was promoted to acting squadron leader towards the end of June 1941 and started to deputise for the commander in his absence. Widdows was promoted to station command and was replaced by Wing Commander Edward Colbeck-Welch. Gibson claimed two more kills which were confirmed. Another unidentified bomber, possibly a [[Heinkel]], was claimed in flames on 3/4 May.<ref name = \"M92\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=92}}.</ref> On 6 July he downed a Heinkel He 111H-5 of 8/KG4 near [[Sheerness]].<ref name=\"M92\"/> His AI operator on all his successful claims was Sergeant R.H. James, who was awarded a [[Distinguished Flying Medal]]. However, the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'''s bombing offensive was tailing off and Gibson started to become bored by the relative safety, and began to describe patrols as \"stooge patrols\" in his log book.  He made some further interceptions but his guns or cannons failed. He was also concerned by his relative lack of success compared with his fellow flight commander [[Bob Braham]].<ref name=\"Morris 1994 91\u201392\"/> He seems to have been happy at West Malling and said \"Of all the airfields in Great Britain, here, many say, including myself, we have the most pleasant\". His final patrols with the squadron were flown on 15 December. He left with both flying and gunnery ratings of above average. He was awarded a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his DFC.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=74}}.</ref>{{sfn|Gazette|35276|p=5360}}\n\nAgain, as a rest from operations, Gibson was due to be posted to an OTU, this time No. 51 OTU, [[RAF Cranfield]] as Chief Flying Instructor. By now he had decided he wanted to return to bombers. Despite a visit to HQ No. 5 Group on 15 December to petition for a transfer, Fighter Command insisted he had to go to Cranfield.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=95}}.</ref> His opportunity came a few weeks later when on 22 February 1942, Arthur Harris was appointed [[Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (AOC-in-C) of Bomber Command. Harris fulfilled his promise made in September 1940. He called Gibson for an interview. On 22 March, Harris wrote to Air Vice Marshal [[John Slessor]], AOC No. 5 Group, explaining his intention to promote Gibson to acting [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] to put him in command of a Lancaster squadron. Harris suggested [[No. 207 Squadron RAF|No. 207 Squadron]]. Slessor exercised his discretion and appointed Gibson CO of [[No. 106 Squadron RAF|No. 106 Squadron]]. Gibson was posted from No. 51 OTU and sent on leave until April, which he spent in south Wales.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=99\u2013100}}.</ref>\n\n===Third operational tour: No. 106 Squadron, Bomber Command===\nWhen the newly promoted Wing Commander Gibson joined No. 106 Squadron at [[RAF Coningsby]], morale was good, but there was serious disappointment with the new twin-engined [[Avro Manchester]] because its [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]] [[Rolls-Royce Vulture|Vulture]] engines were unreliable. Therefore, the squadron was scheduled to convert to the four-engined [[Avro Lancaster]], equipped with [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engines as soon as they became available.<ref name = \"morris105\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=105}}.</ref>\n\nGibson eased himself back into bomber operational flying with a mine-laying operation in the Baltic on 22 April 1942.<ref name = \"morris105\"/> and completed three more sorties in the Manchester during the following 3 weeks.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=350}}.</ref>\n\nApril 1942 was a good month for the squadron. They flew on eighteen nights, six consecutively and the improvements in performance were noted by analysts at both No. 5 Group and Bomber Command.<ref name = \"morris105\"/> The Lancasters started to arrive during May and an ad hoc training plan was started while normal operations were maintained. Gibson made his first flight in a Lancaster in early May.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=106\u2013107}}.</ref>\n\nAs a commander, Gibson's main concern was to be seen to share the risk.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=104}}.</ref> He continued to show unremitting aggression with a selectivity towards harder targets rather than easier ones. He expected the same determination from everyone on the squadron. He was ruthless in screening crews for reliability. The station's Medical Officer became expert in determining which crews were simply unlucky in contrast with genuine malingerers. However he was capable of serious misjudgements on occasions, and could be prone to unreasonable outbursts and the persecution of some crews and their members.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=112\u2013114}}.</ref>\n\nLike Widdows, he carefully supervised new crews and eased them into operational flying with \"Nasturtium training\" \u2013 mine-laying and then easier targets. He was pressurised to expose them earlier to greater risks and he acquired a reputation for not accepting any interference in how he ran the squadron.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=105\u2013106}}.</ref>\n\nGibson's exercise of summary discipline tended towards constructive tasks aimed at improving the efficiency of the squadron such as maintenance of aircraft, engines or weapons<ref name=\"Morris 1994 113\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=113}}.</ref> He was responsible for the emergence of an inner circle of officers who shared his intensity for operations. Their off-duty activities included swimming, water polo and shooting. However, his behaviour towards NCOs and ground crews could still be a problem.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=112}}.</ref> Soon after his arrival, the NCOs perceived one incident he was involved in with them as particularly high-handed and the ground crews quickly gave him the nickname \"The Boy Emperor\".<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=104\u2013105}}.</ref> Gibson got on better with his own class and background than with \"other ranks and colonials\". Bomb-aimer George \"Johnny\" Johnson of Joe McCarthy's crew said that on 106 Squadron he was known as the 'Arch-Bastard' because of his strict discipline, and he did not mix with the lower ranks or talk to NCOs or ground crews. A little man, he was arrogant, bombastic and a strict disciplinarian but \"had something to be bombastic about\" and was a \"true leader ... though he never spoke to or even acknowledged me.\" {{sfn|Nichol|2015|p=19}}\n\nOn 11 May, he was hospitalised at RAF Rauceby. The exact reason is unknown, but suggestions include a sinus or middle ear problem. He was then sent on two weeks convalescent leave. This absence meant he was unable to participate in Operation Millennium, the \"1000 Bomber raids\", the first of which was made on [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|Cologne]] on 30 May 1942. He found this frustrating because this raid saw the introduction of the [[Bomber stream]]. This was where the aircraft were concentrated together in an attempt to overwhelm the defences, with each allocated a specific place, height band, and time slot.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=107\u2013108}}.</ref> This period saw the introduction of aiming-point photography. Gibson tried it out and then encouraged all aircrews to become \"photo minded\". Obtaining good aiming point photographs quickly became a competition both within, and between squadrons.<ref name=\"Morris 1994 113\"/>\n\nOn his return he continued to build up his experience with the Lancaster. He flew with his friend, pilot John Hopgood on 4 July and then on a long cross-country flight the day after, 5 July.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=110}}.</ref> He made his first operational flight in a Lancaster on 8 July with [[Dave Shannon]] as his second pilot. They were together again on 11 July when they went to [[Danzig]]. They were appalled when they were sent on a daylight Mohling raid to the [[Krupp Arms Works|Krupps]] in [[Essen]] on 18 July. It was known as a difficult and dangerous target at night and they were relieved to be recalled when near [[Vlissingen]]. They jettisoned their bombs over the sea before returning.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=110\u2013111}}.</ref>\n\nThe squadron was selected for special training in the use of two kinds of new bombsight for use with a special bomb designed for attacks on capital ships. However, Gibson advised that the aircraft should not attack any ships below 8,500 feet. They put this training into practice with a marathon flight to [[Gdynia]] on 27 August 1942. The targets were [[German battleship Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']] and [[German battleship Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']]. Gibson again flew with Shannon and they swapped places during the flight. There was significant unexpected haze over the target when they arrived. Gibson's bomb aimer, Squadron Leader Richardson, a bombing instructor from [[Manby|RAF Manby]], requested twelve practice runs over the target, but they still failed to damage the ship. In fact no ships were damaged during the raid, but the squadron's preparation for the raid was noted by Harris and Air Commodore [[Alec Coryton]], the AOC No. 5 Group.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=116\u2013117}}.</ref>\n\nOn 30 September the squadron moved from Coningsby to [[RAF Syerston]] in [[Nottinghamshire]]. They expected this move to be only temporary while the runways were concreted, but problems at Coningsby meant it became permanent.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=117\u2013118}}.</ref>\n\nGibson quickly formed a good relationship with Syerston's station commander Group Captain [[Augustus Walker|\"Gus\" Walker]]. In October, they were required to conduct low-level training exercises with aircraft flying in formations of threes and sixes. This training was put to use in a raid on the 17th on [[Le Creusot]] in France. Gibson and Hopgood were among the pilots sent to attack the electric transformer station at nearby [[Montchanin]].<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=119\u2013120}}.</ref> Later in the month they started to attack Italian targets including Genoa, Milan and Turin.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=121}}.</ref> In November 1942 Gibson was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO).<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=91}}.</ref>{{sfn|Gazette|35791|p=5031}}\n\nOn 8 December Gibson did not fly. He was in the control room with Walker watching the aircraft taxiing for take-off. Walker noticed some incendiaries which had fallen out of the bomb bay of a reserve Lancaster located near the main bomb dump. The incendiaries had ignited. Walker drove out to the plane and tried to move the incendiaries with a rake. He lost his arm in the subsequent explosion of the 4000&nbsp;lb \"cookie\" bomb still in the aircraft's bomb bay. He was replaced by Group Captain Bussell.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=124\u2013125}}.</ref>\n\nOn 16 January 1943, Gibson took the [[BBC]]'s [[war correspondent]], Major [[Richard Dimbleby]] on a sortie to Berlin. Dimbleby described the raid in a later radio broadcast. Gibson was very pleased with the outcome, as he always wanted to communicate what life was like for the aircrews.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=135\u2013137}}.</ref> On 12 March, he made his final flight with the squadron to [[Stuttgart]]. He flew on three engines and was forced to stay low throughout the raid.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=140}}.</ref>\n\nBussell recommended Gibson for a Bar to his DSO, but this was reduced to a second Bar to his DFC at HQ No. 5 Group owing to the recent award of the DSO. However, Harris confirmed the Bar to Gibson's DSO with the comment \"any Captain who completes 172 sorties in outstanding manner is worth two DSOs if not a VC. Bar to DSO approved\".<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=141}}.</ref>{{sfn|Gazette|35963|p=1518}} Gibson was informed on 25 March, after he left the squadron.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=100}}.</ref>\n\nGibson was expecting to go on leave to Cornwall and was therefore shocked when he received a call from HQ No. 5 Group to inform him he was being posted there to write a book.<ref name = \"sweet96\">{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=96}}.</ref>\n\n==No. 617 Squadron and Operation Chastise==\n{{main|Operation Chastise}}\n\n===Formation of Squadron X===\nAfter the decision was made to attack the [[Ruhr]] dams, Harris decided to hand the direct responsibility for the detailed planning, preparation and execution to Air Vice Marshal [[Ralph Cochrane]], AOC No. 5 Group. Harris told him he must form a new squadron and nominated Gibson as the CO.<ref name = \"sweet96\"/>\n\nOn 18 March Gibson attended an interview at HQ No. 5 Group where Cochrane asked him if he was willing to fly on \"one more trip\". Gibson indicated that he was. He attended a further interview the following day when he was told that he was to command a new squadron, which would be required to fly low at night with an objective that had to be achieved by 19 May. At this meeting, he was introduced to Group Captain [[John Whitworth]], the commander of RAF Scampton where the new squadron was to be stationed.<ref name = \"sweet97\">{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=97}}.</ref>\n\n====Selection of aircrew====\nUnusually, Gibson was allowed to select crews for the new squadron with help from Group Captain Satterly, the Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) No. 5 Group. The initial intention was for the squadron to be formed from volunteer tour-expired crews. Bomber Command then stated they should have completed or nearly completed two tours of operations.<ref name = \"sweet97\"/>\n\nHe selected Squadron Leaders Maudslay and Young as his flight commanders. His selection of Young resulted in the transfer of the whole of 'C' Flight from [[No. 57 Squadron RAF|No. 57 Squadron]] into the new one. Some crews or pilots were known to him including Hopgood and Shannon, who by this time had transferred from No. 106 squadron to the [[Pathfinder (RAF)|Pathfinders]] and No. 83 Squadron. He selected [[Harold Brownlow Martin|Harold \"Mick\" Martin]] for his low-flying expertise. Of Gibson's regular crew from No. 106 Squadron, only Hutchinson, the wireless operator, volunteered for this new one. He brought in a friend, Taerum, a Canadian navigator. Taerum in turn brought in another friend, Spafford, a bomb-aimer and they joined Hutchinson in Gibson's crew. In the end some crews had not completed one tour, with some individuals having flown fewer than ten operations.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=98\u201399}}.</ref>\n\nGibson was strict in screening the crews during training. That not all the crews were known to him is reflected in how two crews were posted off the squadron as not satisfactory and another crew chose to leave after their navigator was deemed unsatisfactory.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=102\u2013103}}.</ref>\n\n===Training of No. 617 Squadron===\nGibson arrived at Scampton on 21 March. His office was on the 1st floor in No.2 Hangar. His immediate task was to get the general administration organised. He delegated this and the adjutant assigned from No. 57 Squadron was quickly replaced with Flight Lieutenant Humphreys from Syerston. Humphreys was instrumental in the rapid establishment of the squadron.<ref name = \"sweet102\">{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=102}}.</ref> The ground staff started to muster from 21 March and were fully present by 27 March. Flight Sergeant (Discip) Powell inspected them and weeded out those he felt other squadrons had off-loaded.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=99}}.</ref> The aircrews started to arrive from 24 March.<ref name=\"sweet97\"/>\n\nOn 24 March Gibson travelled to Burhill near Weybridge for his first meeting with [[Barnes Wallis]]. Wallis discovered Gibson had not been cleared for a full briefing and therefore could not be told the targets. Wallis was able to explain the design and operation of the new weapon, [[Bouncing bomb|Upkeep]] and showed him films from its trials. It was a depth charge which, if rotated with backspin and dropped at the correct speed and altitude, would bounce across the surface of a body of water towards a target. This bouncing behaviour gave it its nickname the [[bouncing bomb]]. The crews usually referred to it as a mine.<ref name=\"sweet102\" />\n\nOn 27 March Group Captain Satterley provided Gibson with \"most secret\" written orders, including a description of the attack and the general plan for the squadron's preliminary training. From these Gibson learnt that the targets were \"lightly defended special targets\" which reduced his suspicion that they were training to attack the [[German battleship Tirpitz|Tirpitz]]. The orders included a list of nine lakes and reservoirs in the Midlands and North Wales, for training flights and target practice. They included [[Eyebrook Reservoir]], near [[Uppingham]], Rutland, [[Abberton Reservoir]] near Colchester and [[Derwent Reservoir (Derbyshire)|Derwent Reservoir]] and some of the earliest flights made by the new No. 617 Squadron, were reconnaissance flights over these bodies of water.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=101}}.</ref> A recommendation to maximize the training time available was to use simulated night flying as developed by the USAAF.<ref name=\"sweet102\" /> This required the cockpit to be covered in blue celluloid and the pilots and bomb aimers to wear goggles with amber-tinted lenses. Gibson wanted six aeroplanes converted but only two became available, the first on 11 April.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=106}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Upkeep in Lancaster.jpg|thumb|\"Upkeep\" [[bouncing bomb]] used for dam busting bomb mounted under Lancaster B III (Special). The chain was driven by a hydraulic motor and gave the bomb its [[backspin]].]]\nAnother important factor was the need for a specially adapted version of the Lancaster, the B.III (Special), officially the \"Type 464 (Provisioning)\". The bomb bay doors were removed and the ends of the bay were covered with fairings. Upkeep was suspended on pivoted, vee-shaped struts which sprang apart when the bomb-release button was pressed. A drive belt and pulley to rotate the bomb at 500 rpm was mounted on the starboard strut and driven by a hydraulic motor housed in the forward fairing. The mid-upper turret was removed and a more bulbous bomb aimer's blister was fitted. The first adapted aircraft arrived at Scampton on 8 April.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=108}}.</ref>\n\nOn 28 March, Gibson made his first flight to explore the low-flying requirement. He took Hopgood and Young with him and found low flying during daylight satisfactory but during an attempt at dusk the difficulty of their task became apparent, when they nearly ditched.<ref name=\"sweet102\" /> On 29 March, Gibson was shown scale models of the [[M\u00f6hne Reservoir|Moehne]] and [[Sorpe Dam|Sorpe]] dams by Cochrane at HQ 5 Group.  He then attended a further meeting with Wallis at Weybridge. At this meeting he rejected Wallis's proposal of a daylight raid.<ref name=\"sweet102\" />\n\nThe squadron commenced daily flying training at the beginning of April with long cross-country flights with precise turning points to develop their navigation skills.<ref name=\"sweet102\" /> They then started to practise low flying over water. The squadron completed over a thousand flying hours by the end of April and Gibson was able to report to Whitworth, that they could fly pinpoint to pinpoint at low level at night, could bomb using a rangefinder and fly over water at {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Sweetman 2002 103\">{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=105, 103}}.</ref> On 24 April Wallis made a request for the altitude to be reduced to {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Gibson reported on 27 April that it was possible and the training was adapted accordingly.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=156}}.</ref>\n\nGibson was closely involved with discussions about the design, trial and approval of the solutions developed for the various technical issues encountered. These included the Dann bomb sight and the 'Spotlight Altimeter Calibrator', which was the name given to the spotlights attached to the Lancasters, to ensure the determination of the correct height above a body of water.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=106\u2013109}}.</ref> Security was Gibson's constant concern and he was especially displeased to learn from his bombing leader Watson that he had been shown details of the targets within days of his arrival at RAF Manston. Gibson wrote to Cochrane who raised his concerns about this 'criminal' breach of security at the highest levels.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=109}}.</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning of May squadron training shifted to the tactical aspects of the operation.<ref name=\"Sweetman 2002 103\"/> On 1 May Gibson communicated to Wallis his confidence that the operation would succeed. He repeated this optimism in his weekly report to Whitworth on 4 May where he described the squadron as \"ready to operate\".<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=111}}.</ref> On 6 May he held a conference with the pilots to explain the tactical aspects. They flew a rehearsal that evening with Gibson directing a group by radio telephony (R/T) on the spot over the Eyebrook and Abberton Reservoirs. A second group went to the Derwent Reservoir and a third to the Wash.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=112}}.</ref> On 10 May, Satterly sent the draft handwritten operation order to Whitworth for review and revision, to be returned by 1600 on 12 May. It included, how the squadron would be split into waves to attack the targets, reserves, likely defences and exit routes; Gibson provided detailed comments.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=113\u2013114}}.</ref> Despite Gibson's confidence, there still had not been a successful release of a live Upkeep, which took until 11 May. Most of the crews were able to practise at Reculver from 11 to 14 May. Gibson practised at [[Reculver]] in Lancaster ED932/AJ-G, the aircraft he used on the raid. The aircraft's call letters were the same as his father's initials: AJG. On 14 May the squadron flew on a full dress rehearsal designed to simulate the routes, targets and the geography of the raid. Gibson took Whitworth with him and described the outcome in his log book as \"completely successful\".<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=116}}.</ref>\n\nCochrane travelled to Scampton on 15 May to inform Whitworth and Gibson that the operation would take place the following evening, over 16/17 May. At about 16:00, Gibson travelled with Cochrane on his return to Grantham. Here he discussed the draft operation order with Satterly and Wing Commander Dunn, No. 5 Group's chief signals officer. He returned to Scampton and at 18:00 at Whitworth's house, along with Wallis, he briefed Young and Maudsley, his flight commanders, and Hopgood, the deputy leader, and Hay, the squadron's bombing leader. He had obtained Cochrane's verbal agreement for Hopgood and Hay to attend, which proved beneficial as Hopgood was able to point out the new defences at Huls. After the meeting broke up, Whitworth informed Gibson that [[Nigger (dog)|his dog]], named Nigger, had been killed in a road accident. It did not seem to affect Gibson outwardly. He was aware how superstitious some aircrew could be, as the dog was the squadron's mascot. Wallis feared it was a dreadful omen.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=131\u2013133}}.</ref>\n\n==Raid of 16/17 May 1943==\n===Briefings during 16 May===\nThe first thing Gibson did early on the morning of 16 May was to report to the Medical Officer because of pains in his feet. The MO had previously diagnosed [[gout]] but he could not prescribe painkillers as these might affect Gibson's alertness when flying. As Gibson felt he had no choice but to fly, he decided to continue as he was.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=163}}.</ref> The first briefing was at midday when Gibson and Wallis explained the details of the raid to the pilots and navigators. The next one was at 14:30 and included the bomb aimers and gunners. At 18:00 all the aircrew were called to a final briefing in the upper briefing room, which was guarded.\n\nGibson explained how they were going \"to attack the great dams of Germany\". He then introduced Wallis who explained how Upkeep would be used against the dams. Cochrane then spoke and emphasised how they would do \"a tremendous amount of damage\" but their exploits would remain secret. Gibson explained the operational details again and made it clear no crews were to return with their mine. He handed over to Wing Commander Dunn who explained the signals procedures. The meeting broke up and the crews went for their meal at 19:30.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=150\u2013151}}.</ref>\n\n===Flight to the M\u00f6hne Dam===\n[[File:Wing Commander Guy Gibson (in door of aircraft) and his crew board their Avro Lancaster bomber for No. 617 Squadron's raid on the Ruhr Dams, 16 May 1943. CH18005.jpg|right|thumb|189x189px]]\nGibson was driven out to his aircraft [[List of RAF Squadron Codes|AJ-G]] by his regular driver, Eileen Strawson. Cochrane came out to Gibson's aircraft to wish him well. A photo was taken of the crew entering the aircraft beforehand.  Gibson took off at 21:39 with Hopgood and Martin. They flew out over Skegness and Cromer. The winds were stronger than forecast, as a result they made landfall later and further south than expected. Gibson had the route adjusted to [[Roosendaal]] and they flew on unopposed to the [[Rhine]]. Again they were too far south, about {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the expected landmark and received flak from barges on the river and batteries on the banks. They had similar navigation problems until they reached the target.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=155\u2013156}}.</ref> They found the defences at the M\u00f6hne Dam as described at the briefing. There was an active light flak battery but no searchlights or barrage balloons.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=161}}.</ref>\n\n===Attack on the M\u00f6hne Dam===\nGibson made a dummy run over the dam to look the target over and reported how he \"liked the look of it\". The second formation of three led by Young arrived at this point. Gibson made his bombing run but the bomb was released short and did not damage the dam. It took about five minutes for the water to settle down after the explosion. He then called in Hopgood to make his attack. He watched as Hopgood's aircraft was hit by flak, caught fire and then exploded. Hopgood's crew had managed to release their bomb but it overshot and destroyed an electrical station below the dam. Gibson waited again for the water to settle. He then called in [[Harold Brownlow Martin|Martin]] to make his attack but this time decided to fly with him, parallel and slightly ahead, to draw off the flak. Martin's mine did not damage the dam. Gibson called in Young and Martin flew alongside him, whilst Gibson flew along another evasive path. It was not obvious until [[David Maltby|Maltby]] started the next bombing run that Young's mine had breached the dam. At 00:56, Hutchinson sent the code word \"N I G G E R\" (sic), the name of Gibson's recently killed dog, to signal the breach to HQ 5 Group and then confirmed it on their request. Martin and Maltby departed for home.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=161\u2013166}}.</ref>\n\n===Attack on the Eder Dam===\nAfter breaching the M\u00f6hne dam, Gibson flew with Young as his deputy and the remaining aircraft that still had their mines, to the Eder See. Shannon had arrived with Young while Maudslay and Knight had arrived while Hopgood had been preparing for his bombing run. The flight to the Eder See lasted about 14 minutes. They did not fly in formation and did not encounter any opposition. The dam was difficult to find and there was early morning mist starting to gather over the water. Shannon arrived too far west and found the Rehbuch dam. Gibson's aircraft fired red Very lights to help him find the others. Although the dam's defences consisted of only two sentries with rifles, it was still a difficult target owing to the approach. Shannon flew three dummy runs and then Maudsley flew two. Shannon flew two more dummy runs before finally releasing his bomb, which did not breach the dam. When Maudslay released his bomb it hit a parapet and his plane appeared to get caught in the explosion. However, there were messages from the aircraft and it is possible that it survived this and crash-landed later. Gibson called in Astell but did not seem to realise he was not present. He then called in Knight, who made a single dummy run before releasing his bomb. It breached the dam. At 01:54, Hutchinson signalled the breach and then confirmed it.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=168\u2013171}}.</ref>\n\n===Return flight, debriefing and questionnaire===\nGibson returned via the M\u00f6hne dam and the third exit route.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=174}}.</ref> At 02:10, he received an enquiry from HQ 5 Group, asking whether any crews were available to attack the Sorpe. He replied that there were not. He had an uneventful flight home and landed at 04:15 with just three small holes in his aircraft's tail.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=173}}.</ref> He attended a debriefing and like all the pilots who returned from this raid, he had to complete a special questionnaire about the target and behaviour of the weapon. The pilots were invited to make additional comments. Gibson's comments included how VHF had proved a \"perfect\" method to control the raid.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=176\u2013177}}.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nOne of Gibson's first tasks after his own debriefing was to deal with the early returns. He accepted that Munro's aircraft had sustained significant damage and Rice's mine had fallen off. Gibson was furious with Anderson because he returned with his bomb, despite the instructions at the briefing. The crew were posted off the squadron with immediate effect, although the squadron's official records show they left in early June. At 08:30 he received a lengthy message from Cochrane thanking him for his efforts in making the raid a success.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=236}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cochrane, Gibson, King George VI and Whitworth discussing the Dambusters Raid.jpg|thumb|right|Air Vice Marshal [[Ralph Cochrane]], Wing Commander Guy Gibson, King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] and Group Captain [[John Whitworth]] discuss the Dambuster Raid during the King's visit to RAF Scampton on 27 May 1943.]]\nOn 27 May the [[George VI|King]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen]] visited Scampton. There was lunch in the officers' mess followed by an inspection of the Squadron. Gibson showed the King models and photos of the dams.

Humphreys and Hevron started the task of informing the next of kin. A party was organised at [[RAF Woodhall Spa]] on the evening of 17 May and Gibson attended but he made sure a beer was sent to Humphreys with his compliments. It took three days to complete the telegrams and follow-up letters. Gibson continued his usual practice of adding personal comments to letters where possible.\n\nOn 18 May, there was a parade where Cochrane and Gibson made speeches to the squadron members. He then released the air crews from duty on seven days' leave and half the ground crew on three days' leave.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=238}}.</ref> Gibson went on weekend leave to Penarth. On the Sunday he received a call from Harris to inform him he had been awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC).{{sfn|Gazette|36030|p=2361}} His response was subdued as he felt responsible for those he had recruited and who had not returned, particularly Hopgood. He was reported as saying: \"It all seems so unfair\".<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=177}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Wing Commander Guy Gibson, Vc, Dso and Bar, Dfc and Bar, Commander of 617 Squadron (dambusters) at Scampton, Lincolnshire, 22 July 1943 TR1122.jpg|thumb|right|Wing Commander Guy Gibson (Right) and S/Ldr [[David Maltby]] (left) at RAF Scampton, on 22 July 1943 after the raid.]]\nOn 22 June, Gibson and all the other newly decorated members of 617 Squadron attended an investiture at [[Buckingham Palace]]. It was performed by the Queen as the King was in North Africa. She presented Gibson with his VC and the Bar to his DSO first, and in the process he became the most highly decorated serviceman in the country.<ref name=\"decoration\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=182}}.</ref> After the investitures all the crews went on to the Hungaria Restaurant to a dinner arranged by [[Avro|AV Roe]], the builders of the Lancaster. Gibson was presented with a silver model of a Lancaster by the company's chairman, [[Thomas Sopwith]]. Also at the dinner were [[Roy Chadwick]], the designer of the Lancaster, and Wallis.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=183}}.</ref>\n\nHarris made arrangements to ensure Gibson was rested from operations and on 24 July he and his wife were invited to lunch at [[Chequers]] as guests of the Prime Minister, [[Winston Churchill]]. Here Gibson was shown a film smuggled out of Germany about the concentration camps.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=189\u2013190}}.</ref> On 2 August, Gibson made his last flight with 617 Squadron. He flew with his regular crew and his successor, Wing Commander [[George Holden (RAF officer)|George Holden]], to [[Eyebrook Reservoir]] to familiarise him with the technique to release Upkeep.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=192\u2013193}}.</ref>\n\n==Post-Chastise activities==\n\n===Tour of Canada and US===\nOn 3 August Gibson travelled to London to join the party accompanying the Prime Minister to the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quadrant Conference]] in [[Quebec]], Canada. Around midnight they were taken by a special train to [[HMNB Clyde|Faslane]] where they boarded the [[RMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']], setting sail around 17:30 on 4 August.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=193}}.</ref>\n\nThe party included some of the most senior military figures such as [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]], Chief of Combined Operations and Air Chief Marshal [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Sir Charles Portal]], [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]]. Gibson was therefore an outsider, like fellow passenger, Brigadier [[Orde Wingate]], the [[Chindits]] leader. However, unlike Wingate, he seems to have found it easier to enter into shipboard life. [[Mary Soames, Baroness Soames|Mary Churchill]], who was travelling as her father's [[aide-de-camp]], found Gibson \"had all the aura of a hero\" and also \"very agreeable and debonair to talk to\". On the last evening of the voyage, on 8 August, after dinner, Gibson was invited to address the whole party on the Dams Raid.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=197}}.</ref>\n\nOn 9 August they arrived in [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], and were transferred by special trains to Quebec. A certain amount of disinformation circulated around their arrival including how Gibson had acted as the pilot on the aircraft that had flown Churchill across the Atlantic. They arrived at a time of significant tension between the British and Canadian governments. The Canadians were unhappy with the relative lack of credit being granted to the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]'s (RCAF) contribution to the war effort. On 11 August, Gibson attended a select luncheon with the Prime Minister, where he was introduced to the Canadian Prime Minister, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]]. He spent the rest of the afternoon at an RCAF recruiting centre.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=197\u2013198}}.</ref>\n\nOn 12 August Gibson attended a Press Conference arranged in his honour. It was hosted by Hon. C.G. Power, the Canadian air minister and attended by hundreds of journalists from around the world. Gibson responded to questions about the Dams Raid and revealed the Prime Minister called him \"Dam-buster\". Reports of the conference were enthusiastic. He attended engagements in the Quebec area. On 17 August, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] arrived at the Conference. Churchill arranged for Gibson to meet the President at a private meeting.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=198\u2013201}}.</ref>\n\nGibson left Quebec on 20 August to start the Canadian leg of his tour. It was a punishing schedule and included civic receptions and speeches, motorcades, interviews, broadcasts, along with travel. He went to [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]], [[Toronto]] and [[London, Ontario|London (Ontario)]]. As Churchill was in [[New York City|New York]], on 5 September, Gibson was diverted there to make a radio broadcast which was heard on station WJZ New York. In [[Winnipeg]] he met the family of Harvey Glinz, who had been killed on the Dams Raid when flying as the front-gunner in Barlow's crew. He then went on to training bases at [[Carberry, Manitoba|Carberry]], Rivers, Dafoe, [[Moose Jaw]] and Moss Bank.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=201\u2013204}}.</ref>\n\nOn 11 September he arrived in [[Calgary]]. Here he met the mother of the navigator in his own Dams Raid crew, Mrs Taerum. He spent time with her at home the following day. He also met Leading Aircraftman Robert Young, the younger brother of Squadron Leader Young, also killed on the Dams raid.  He continued on to [[Vancouver]] and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] before returning to Montreal and Ottawa in the east. He had a week's rest at the Seignory Club in Ottawa from 28 September to 3 October.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=204\u2013206}}.</ref>\n\nOn 4 October he began the United States leg of his tour in [[Washington, D.C.]]. He attended a major Press Conference at the offices of the British Information Service in New York on 7 October.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} This was \"at a time when the first American airmen were coming home 'tour expired' after 25 operations. During questions one young lady asked, 'Wing Commander Gibson, how many operations have you been on over Germany?' He replied, 'One hundred and seventy-four.' There was a stunned silence\".{{sfn|Thompson|1989|p=36}}\n\nOn 19 October, Gibson was invested with the Commander's Insignia to the [[Legion of Merit]] by General [[Henry H. Arnold]] at [[Bolling Field]] near Washington D.C. The decision to award him with the Legion of Merit was taken quickly. It was also exceptional. To avoid duplication American awards were, in general, not accepted for actions which had already earned a British medal. This allowed them to be restricted to cases where Americans wished to express particular gratitude. For example, they were often given for the air/sea rescue of American personnel.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=206}}.</ref>\nIt was announced formally in Britain in December 1943.{{sfn|Gazette|36271|p=5284}}\n\nGibson continued on to [[Chicago]], [[Minneapolis]] and then to [[Los Angeles]]. He stayed with the film director [[Howard Hawks]]. Most his time was spent in private, his reward for his gruelling tour. However, it is possible he might have been giving technical advice on a proposed film of the Dams Raid. Hawks had commissioned [[Roald Dahl]] to write a script for the film and had started to build models of the dams and Lancaster bombers. He was encouraged by Bomber Command's PR Department. However, when Wallis was shown the script, he thought it absurd, and the project was scrapped.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=207\u2013208}}.</ref>\n\nGibson returned to Montreal and flew back to Britain in a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberator]] being ferried across the Atlantic. He landed at [[Prestwick]] on 1 December and was met by a representative from the Ministry of Intelligence.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=208}}.</ref> On his return he was exhausted, but still went straight from home in London to Scampton to visit 617 Squadron. When he arrived he was informed that they had moved to Coningsby, and was driven over. He visited HQ 5 Group in an attempt to obtain an operational posting, but was declared non-operational sick and sent on a month's rest leave.  At the end of his leave he was due to be posted to the Directorate of Accidents with the order to write a book.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=217\u2013218}}.</ref> During this time he was hospitalised with [[Tonsillitis|Vincent's Angina]] on 17 December.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=141}}.</ref>\n\nThe view emerged that as a result of the tour he had acquired and retained an increased sense of his own importance. In July 1944 Harris wrote to Cochrane to comment that the Americans had \"spoiled young Gibson\".<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=210}}.</ref> Therefore, this route was not pursued again later in the war with other highly decorated airmen, such as [[Leonard Cheshire]].\n\n===Directorate for the Prevention of Accidents: writing ''Enemy Coast Ahead''===\nIn January 1944 Gibson was posted to the Directorate for the Prevention of Accidents. He appears to have been under orders to write a book. This posting was effectively a cover to give him the time and access to the resources he needed to complete it. It is possible either the Ministry of Intelligence or the RAF's publicity department wanted him to complete a book in order to counter the increasing criticisms of the Strategic Air Offensive.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=224}}.</ref>\n\nGibson was located in a small back room and had access to a dictaphone and typist. He did not seem to take well to his assignment initially. When Heveron travelled from Scampton to deliver some information about 617 Squadron, Heveron found him depressed and with long hair.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=223}}.</ref>\n\nHowever Gibson did seem to become increasingly enthusiastic about writing. His wife remembered his writing at home during weekends while he was at Staff College during March\u2013May 1944.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=226}}.</ref> The typescript survives of a draft Gibson submitted in summer 1944. His wife donated it to the [[Royal Air Force Museum London|RAF Museum]] at Hendon. The writing style confirms that Gibson wrote most of the book, because it includes his characteristic style of comments and humour, plus in places it is simply bad. Therefore, the book was not ghost-written, as some have suggested. The typescript includes corrections in his own hand. These may suggest he had the help of a professional editor while he was writing.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=222}}.</ref> The text was passed by the censors who edited out some of his more intolerant political and social views as well as operational information. He completed his final draft in September 1944.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=258\u2013259}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to an article published in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' in June 2013, the book's final title was one of seven suggested by Gibson himself in a letter written to publishers Pearn, Pollinger and Higham dated 1 August 1944.{{sfn|Duell|2013}} The full list of titles suggested by Gibson was:\n\n*''Four Years Lifetime''\n*''Flak-Fun-Fear''\n*''The Boys Die Young''\n*''[[Enemy Coast Ahead]]''\n*''Eight Are Missing''\n*''Reich Wreckers''\n*''By Fire and By Water''\n\n===Appearance on ''Desert Island Discs''===\nOn 19 February 1944 Gibson appeared as the Castaway{{sfn|''BBC''|1944}} on ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' with Roy Plomley.{{sfn|Morris|1994|pp=233\u2013234}}\n\nHis musical choices were:\n\n*''[[Warsaw Concerto]]'' by [[Richard Addinsell]] played by [[London Symphony Orchestra]]\n*\"[[Where or When]]\" (from ''[[Babes in Arms]]'') played by [[Jack Hylton]] & His Orchestra\n*\"A Thousand and One Nights Waltz\" by [[Johann Strauss II]]: Symphony Orchestra Conductor: Johann Stauss III\n*''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'' overture by [[Richard Wagner]] played by Berlin State Opera Orchestra\n*\"[[If I Had My Way]]\" performed by [[Bing Crosby]]\n*\"[[The Marines Hymn]]\" performed by [[Fred Waring]] & His Pennsylvanians\n*\"[[Royal Air Force March Past]]\" performed by The Central Band of The Royal Air Force\n*\"[[Ride of the Valkyries]]\" (from ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'') by [[Richard Wagner]] performed by Queens Hall Orchestra\n\n===Politics, prospective parliamentary candidate for Macclesfield===\n[[W. Garfield Weston|Garfield Weston]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Macclesfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Macclesfield]] was due to retire and was looking for a replacement. In February 1944 he approached Gibson to suggest Gibson consider standing for Parliament.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=228}}.</ref> Gibson agreed, but first he had to be selected by the local party. Gibson made visits to Macclesfield to campaign for selection. On one occasion he shared a platform with [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Lord Robert Vansittart]], who gave his name \u2013 Vansittartism \u2013 to a form of collective German guilt for the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=230}}.</ref> A short-list of candidates was drawn up, which also included Air Vice Marshal [[Don Bennett]].<ref name=\"Morris 1994 236\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=236}}.</ref> Gibson was selected by a narrow margin and became the Conservative [[prospective parliamentary candidate]] for the constituency.<ref name=\"Morris 1994 236\"/> Despite the constituency party's having taken him on knowing his circumstances as a serving officer, Gibson resigned as their candidate in August 1944 citing the demands of his service career.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=254}}.</ref>\n\n==Return to operations==\n\n===Staff College and Base Staff Officer===\nGibson attended a staff course at the RAF Staff College at [[Bulstrode Park]] near [[Gerrards Cross]] from the end of March to May 1944.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=147}}.</ref> He then went on leave. During the last week he got very restless as he learned about the D-Day landings. He feared the war would end before he could get back into the action. On his return he appealed straight to Harris. Four days later he was appointed as a staff officer at No. 55 Base, [[RAF East Kirkby]] to understudy to the Base Air Staff Officer (BASO). Duties included operational planning and liaison between the units within the Base.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=249}}.</ref>\n\nOn 5 July he flew in a Lancaster for the first time since leaving No. 617 Squadron. It was a test flight and the crew commented that he handled it well considering how long it had been since he had last flown.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=999}}.</ref> On 19 July he joined a Lancaster crew, possibly from No. 630 Squadron, located at East Kirkby, during an attack on a [[V-1 flying bomb]] launch site at [[Criel-sur-Mer]] in France. He pasted an aiming point photo from the operation in his log book.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=251\u2013252}}.</ref>\n\nOn 2 August he was posted to No. 54 Base, RAF Coningsby, where he arrived on the 4th. Coningsby was a centre for tactical innovation and home of the elite No. 54 Base Flight.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=253}}.</ref> Here he was exposed to intelligence that increased his concern that the war would end without him getting back into the action.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=255}}.</ref> At this stage he may have had Cochrane's consent for limited operational flying, provided it was non-participatory, short time over target and he could bail out over Allied-controlled territory.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=256}}.</ref>\n\nOn 15 August he flew in a [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|Lightning]] as an observer on a daylight raid over Deelen in the Netherlands. He made a similar flight in a Lightning a few days later to Le Havre. On 2 September he flew a [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] to [[Scatsta Airport|Scasta]] in [[Shetland]].<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=256\u2013257}}.</ref>\n\n===Death===\nOn 19 September an order came through from Bomber Command for No. 5 Group to prepare for an attack on [[Bremen]]. Planes from No. 5 Group would be responsible for all aspects of the operation, including target illumination and marking and control of the raid. Cochrane, the AOC, would be responsible for tactics and route planning.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=265}}.</ref> As the day progressed the weather forecast changed, and at 16:45 an order came through to change to the reserve targets at [[Rheydt]] and [[Moenchengladbach|Moenchen-Gladbach]].<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=267}}.</ref>\n\nAt the flight planning conference it was decided that three areas would be attacked simultaneously; they were designated as red, green and yellow. The red area was Rheydt town centre, where the attack would be fully controlled by a master bomber who would monitor the marking and coordinate the main force bombing. The tactics \u2013 dispersed marking \u2013 were untried and unrehearsed, and therefore would require expertise from the controller and markers.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=268\u2013269}}.</ref> The announcement that Gibson would be the controller was met with general incredulity. It was assumed it would be regular controller from No. 54 Base Flight or a qualified one from No. 627 Squadron. Some suspicion started to circulate that the proposed complexity may have come from Gibson and his lack of experience in marking techniques.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=272}}.</ref>\n\nAs Gibson did not have a regular navigator, one had to be found to fly with him. The first choice was ill, so Squadron Leader Jim Warwick was selected.<ref name=\"Morris 1994 273\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=273}}.</ref> He was the Station Navigation Officer and therefore screened from operations.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=257}}.</ref> There was also no serviceable Mosquito available at Coningsby for Gibson to use, so it was decided to use the reserve aircraft of No. 627 Squadron, located at RAF Woodhall Spa. Gibson and Warwick were driven over. When they arrived about 18:30, for unknown reasons, Gibson rejected the reserve aircraft ''KB213'' and insisted on using the Mosquito B.XX ''[[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|KB267]]'' instead. The crew who were expecting to fly in ''KB267'' were unhappy with the change. As the two crews were performing different functions the bomb loads had to be swapped. They took off at 19:51.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=273\u2013274}}.</ref>\n\nWhen they arrived at the target, the marking of the red area went badly wrong owing to a series of mishaps. The three markers could not identify the marking point and one aircraft had engine problems. Gibson attempted to mark it himself but his Target Indicators (TIs) did not release. As the illumination from the flares was fading, he called for more flares and warned the red section of the main force not to bomb. He then commanded them to stand by, so they started to turn away from the target. This was potentially dangerous and exposed them to further risk from flak and night fighters. Some started to bomb the green area, either out of confusion or nervousness. He then authorised the remaining aircraft to bomb the green area. The red area was eventually marked, but it was too late to direct any of the main force's aircraft to attack it. The raid concluded at 21:58. He remained calm despite the confusion. The time of Gibson's departure from the target is unknown. It is possible that he loitered in a wide, high orbit to assess the outcome and left around 22:00. One crew from No. 61 Squadron claimed they heard him say he had a damaged engine.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=276\u2013281}}.</ref>\n\nGibson's aircraft crashed at [[Steenbergen]] in the Netherlands at around 22:30. Witnesses heard an aircraft flying low, saw that its cockpit was illuminated and then it crashed.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=281}}.</ref> At first, Gibson's failure to return to Woodhall Spa was not considered out of the ordinary, as it was assumed he had landed at Coningsby. Likewise at Coningsby there was no immediate concern as there was fog and it was assumed he would have landed elsewhere. However, it soon became apparent he had not returned. The rumour spread rapidly around No. 5 Group that he was missing.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=282\u2013283}}.</ref> He was not posted officially as missing until 29 November,<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=286}}</ref> although Prime Minister Winston Churchill was informed on 26 September: \"The Air Ministry have told us that Wing Commander Gibson, V.C. is reported missing from a recent raid in which he flew a Mosquito to Munchen Gladbach\".{{sfn|''churchillarchive''|1944}}\n\n===Funeral===\nAt Steenbergen, the Germans cordoned off the crash site at the Graaf Hendrikpolder. Human remains were recovered which confirmed there had been one person in the plane and therefore initially it was suspected the other member may have bailed out. However, with the discovery of a third hand, the presence of a second person was confirmed. Jim Warwick was identified from his identity tag. The laundry tag in a sock identified the other person as a \"Guy Gibson\". The remains were placed in a small specially constructed coffin.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=284\u2013285}}.</ref>\n\nThe local deputy mayor, Mr. Herbers, wanted to give the men a proper funeral. They hired a horse-drawn hearse from nearby Halsteren.  The coffin was draped with the flag of the Netherlands and was laid to rest in the Roman Catholic cemetery. The funeral was attended by the Roman Catholic priest, Father Verhoeven and the Protestant Pastor van den Brink. As they did not know the men's religion they performed the funeral between them. Father Verhoeven read the psalm, ''De Profundis'' and Pastor van den Brink spoke the Lord's Prayer in English.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=285\u2013286}}.</ref> A cross was erected over the grave with Warwick's full rank and name with the name \"Guy Gibson\" underneath. When it was later confirmed who \"Guy Gibson\" was, a new cross was constructed with Gibson's rank, name and decorations.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=164}}.</ref>\n\n===Analysis and theories of the crash===\nThe exact cause of Gibson's crash is unknown and is likely to remain so. A number of theories exist, with some more likely than others. Various contributory factors may also have led to the loss of his Mosquito.<ref name=\"Morris 1994 289\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=289}}.</ref> One theory advanced is that the accident was due to Gibson's lack of experience flying Mosquitos. His log book, which he had last updated on 16 September, detailed 9 hours and 35 minutes flying Mosquitos. It was observed it took him three attempts to land at [[Scatsta Airport|Scatsta]]. He had been on one training flight on 31 August to learn how to dive bomb and Mosquito crews knew they had to practise regularly, particularly in pulling out of dives. Also, he had not rehearsed the emergency procedures to exit a Mosquito \u2013 as it could take 30 seconds even on the ground.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=294\u2013295}}.</ref>\n\nThe same lack of experience flying the Mosquito applied to his navigator, Squadron Leader Warwick, who had never flown in one operationally. That a letter was found with Warwick's address ([[RAF Coningsby]]) on it suggests Warwick's inclusion on the flight was a very late decision. He was experienced and would have known not to take anything like an addressed letter with him under normal circumstances.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=284}}.</ref>\n\nHarris wrote that Gibson appointed himself as the controller. It is possible he seized this opportunity in Air Commodore Sharpe's absence when the late change in target was announced.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=296}}.</ref> There were some instances of Mosquitos breaking up because of their wooden frames. Harris considered this as a possibility, however, it is unlikely.<ref name=\"Morris 1994 289\"/> Lack of fuel is the explanation most favoured by members of No. 627 Squadron at the time. In December 1985 the site was excavated and wreckage from the plane recovered. No enemy damage was noticeable. It has therefore been suggested that Gibson and Warwick had failed to switch fuel tanks at the correct time.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=306}}.</ref> It has also been suggested there was a fault with the fuel tank selector.{{sfn|''RAF''|2012}} Further, it is possible that a lack of familiarity with the Mosquito resulted in neither Gibson nor Warwick being able to find the switches to swap the fuel supply. This would also be a reason to explain why the cockpit was illuminated: they were attempting to locate the switches. In either case, the result would be that the aircraft simply ran out of fuel.\n\nIf Gibson left Rheydt at 22:00 then it is estimated he was about 70 miles short of the expected location if the aircraft had been operating normally. Therefore, it is possible the aircraft was flying underpowered at the time of the crash. This would suggest some sort of damage to the aircraft.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=302}}.</ref>\n\nSpeculation persists{{according to whom|date=August 2017}} that Gibson's Mosquito may have been shot down by German jet fighter ace [[Kurt Welter]]. On the night of the raid, 19 September 1944, Welter was the only German pilot to have claimed a Mosquito shot down that night and Gibson's Mosquito the only Mosquito lost.<ref name=\"Hinchliffe 1998, p. 294\">Hinchliffe 1998, p. 294.</ref> However, a listing of ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' claims transcribed from the original microfilms shows that Welter's claim was on the night of 18/19 September, and was north of [[Wittenberg]], in the area southwest of [[Berlin]], more than 500&nbsp;km from Steenbergen.{{sfn|Guest|Goyat|2003|p=?}} Welter claimed his Mosquito at 23.05 hours near [[G\u00fctersloh]], and recent research indicates that it was actually an intruder Mosquito FB.VI PZ177 of No. 23 Squadron.

Rear gunner Sergeant Bernard McCormack flew on the raid. Before he died in 1992, he left a taped confession with his wife that he had seen what he thought was a [[Junkers Ju 88|Ju 88]] flying near his plane and had fired 600 rounds at it when in the vicinity of Steenbergen. He saw the plane go down. During the debriefing after the raid he explained what had happened and was asked again about the incident by an Intelligence Officer the following day. McCormack came to believe the plane shot down belonged to Gibson.{{sfn|Satherly|2011}}\n\nIt is possible that Gibson was not where others might have expected him to be. During the briefing for the raid, he was advised to use an exit route that would put him over France. However, he disagreed and insisted he would return by the shortest route at low level.<ref name=\"Morris 1994 273\"/>\n\n===Posthumous tributes===\nGibson's death was formally announced on 8 January 1945. However, many knew of his loss before this date.{{sfn|Morris|1994|p=311}}\n\nOn 19 December 1944 Churchill wrote to Eve Gibson:\n\n{{quote|I had great admiration for him \u2013 the glorious Dam-buster. I had hoped that he would come into Parliament and make his way there after the stress of the war was over, but he never spared himself nor would allow others to spare him. We have lost in this officer one of the most splendid of all our fighting men. His name will not be forgotten; it will for ever be enshrined in the most wonderful records of our country.{{sfn|Morris|1994|p=311}} }}\n\nIn his introduction to ''Enemy Coast Ahead'', Sir Arthur Harris described Gibson as:\n\n{{quote|As great a warrior as this island ever bred.{{sfn|Gibson|2005|p=9}}}}\n\nBarnes Wallis said of Gibson:\n\n{{quote|For some men of great courage and adventure, inactivity was a slow death. Would a man like Gibson ever have adjusted back to peacetime life? One can imagine it would have been a somewhat empty existence after all he had been through. Facing death had become his drug. He had seen countless friends and comrades perish in the great crusade. Perhaps something in him even welcomed the inevitability he had always felt that before the war ended he would join them in their Bomber Command Valhalla. He had pushed his luck beyond all limits and he knew it. But that was the kind of man he was\u2026a man of great courage, inspiration and leadership. A man born for war\u2026but born to fall in war.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p= ~216}} }}\n\n==Personal life==\nGibson met Eve Moore, a show dancer and [[actress]], in December 1939 when she was performing in the revue ''Come Out To Play'' at the New Hippodrome Theatre, [[Coventry]]. He later claimed that they met at a party. She claimed he saw the revue three nights in succession before introducing himself to her on the fourth and accompanying her to a cast party.\n\nShe was born Evelyn Mary Moore in [[Penarth]], [[Wales]] on 27 December 1911, which made her seven years older than Gibson.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=43\u201344}}.</ref> He became infatuated with her and travelled to meet her during his leave whenever he could as the revue progressed around the country. He also found opportunities to pursue her while on duty. He volunteered to fly Hampdens to [[MOD St Athan|RAF St Athan]], only twelve miles from [[Cardiff]] and conveniently close to Penarth.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=44}}.</ref> He managed to arrange a stopover in [[Glasgow]] when travelling to [[Lossiemouth]].<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=50\u201351}}.</ref>\n\nGibson proposed to Eve in October 1940 and she accepted.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=72\u201372}}.</ref> On 21 November he flew down to Cardiff in a Blenheim.

They divorced and she returned to Britain in 1954. She reverted to the surname Gibson, so many people did not realise she had remarried. She died on 3 November 1988, the same day as [[Harold Brownlow Martin|Harold Martin]].<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=317}}.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, during research for his book, Richard Morris interviewed Margaret Masters, who formed a close relationship with Gibson during late 1942\u201344.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=333}}.</ref> As Margaret North, she was a member of the medical team called out on 8 December 1942 from [[RAF Rauceby]] to [[RAF Syerston]] to attend to Group Captain Walker. She was a WAAF corporal and a theatre nurse in the Crash and Burn Unit. When Gibson returned to Rauceby the following day to visit Walker, she and Gibson started talking and he asked her out. They would visit pubs and go to the cinema. As she was part of the RAF, she understood his world and she became his confidante. She helped him with an incident of operational stress in mid-January 1943. As he was married and therefore unavailable, in February 1943 she decided to marry someone else.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=126\u2013134}}.</ref> They kept in contact and Gibson became her son's godfather.

(39438), Reserve of Air Force Officers, No. 617 Squadron: \u2014\n\nThis officer served as a night bomber pilot at the beginning of the war and quickly established a reputation as an outstanding operational pilot. In addition to taking the fullest possible share in all normal operations, he made single-handed attacks during his \"rest\" nights on such highly defended objectives as the German battleship ''Tirpitz'', then completing in Wilhelmshaven.\n\nWhen his tour of operational duty was concluded, he asked for a further operational posting and went to a night-fighter unit instead of being posted for instructional duties. In the course of his second operational tour, he destroyed at least three enemy bombers and contributed much to the raising and development of new night-fighter formations.\n\nAfter a short period in a training unit, he again volunteered for operational duties and returned to night bombers. Both as an operational pilot and as leader of his squadron, he achieved outstandingly successful results and his personal courage knew no bounds. Berlin, Cologne, Danzig, Gdynia, Genoa, Le Creusot, Milan, Nuremberg and Stuttgart were among the targets he attacked by day and by night.\n\nOn the conclusion of his third operational tour, Wing Commander Gibson pressed strongly to be allowed to remain on operations and he was selected to command a squadron then forming for special tasks. Under his inspiring leadership, this squadron has now executed one of the most devastating attacks of the war\u2014the breaching of the Moehne and Eder dams.\n\nThe task was fraught with danger and difficulty. Wing Commander Gibson personally made the initial attack on the Moehne dam. Descending to within a few feet of the water and taking the full brunt of the antiaircraft defences, he delivered his attack with great accuracy. Afterwards he circled very low for 30 minutes, drawing the enemy fire on himself in order to leave as free a run as possible to the following aircraft which were attacking the dam in turn.\n\nWing Commander Gibson then led the remainder of his force to the Eder dam where, with complete disregard for his own safety, he repeated his tactics and once more drew on himself the enemy fire so that the attack could be successfully developed.\n\nWing Commander Gibson has completed over 170 sorties, involving more than 600 hours operational flying. Throughout his operational career, prolonged exceptionally at his own request, he has shown leadership, determination and valour of the highest order.{{sfn|Gazette|36030|p=2361}}\n|-\n| [[File:US Legion of Merit Commander ribbon.png| 80px]]\n| [[Legion of Merit|Commander of the Legion of Merit]]\n| (United States) 1943{{sfn|Gazette|36271|p=5284}}\n| The KING has granted unrestricted permission for the wearing of the undermentioned decorations, conferred upon the officers indicated, in recognition of valuable services rendered in connection with the war: \u2014\n\nCONFERRED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\n\nLegion of Merit (Commander).\n\nWing Commander Guy Penrose GIBSON, V.C., D.S.O., D.F.C.

In the recent attack at Le Creusot, Wing-Commander Gibson bombed and machine-gunned the transformer station nearby from five hundred feet. On 22 October 1942, he participated in the attack on Genoa and, two days later, he led his squadron in a daylight sortie against Milan. On both occasions, Wing-Commander Gibson flew with great distinction. He is a most skilful and courageous leader whose keenness has set a most inspiring example.{{sfn|Gazette|35791|p=5031}}\n|-\n| bar 1943{{sfn|Gazette|35963|p=1518}}\n| ''Bar to the Distinguished Service Order''\nActing Wg-Cdr G.P.

He has always displayed the greatest keenness and, within the past two months, has taken part in six attacks against well-defended targets, including Berlin. In March 1943, he captained an aircraft detailed to attack Stuttgart. On the outward flight engine trouble developed but he flew on to his objective and bombed it from a low level. This is typical of his outstanding determination to make every sortie a success. By his skilful leadership and contempt for danger, he has set an example which has inspired the squadron he commands.{{sfn|Gazette|35963|p=1518}}\n|-\n| rowspan=2 | [[File:UK DFC w bar BAR.svg| 80px]]\n| rowspan=2 | [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar]] (DFC & Bar)\n| 1940{{sfn|Gazette|34892|p=4177}}\n| ''Distinguished Flying Cross''\nFg Off.

He was the first [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|No. 617 Squadron]], which he led in the [[Operation Chastise|\"Dam Busters\" raid]] in 1943, resulting in the breaching of two large dams in the [[Ruhr area]] of Germany. He was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces, in the aftermath of the raid in May 1943 and became the most highly decorated British serviceman at that time.<ref name=\"decoration\"/> He completed over 170 war operations before dying in action at the age of 26.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life and education==\nGibson was born in [[Shimla|Simla]], India, on 12 August 1918, the son of Alexander James Gibson and his wife Leonora (\"Nora\") Mary Gibson.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=7}}.</ref> At the time of Gibson's birth, his father was an officer in the [[Indian Forest Service|Imperial Indian Forestry Service]], becoming the Chief Conservator of Forests for the [[Hill States of India|Simla Hill States]] in 1922.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=9}}.</ref> In 1924, when he was six, his parents separated.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=13}}.</ref> His mother was granted custody of Gibson, his elder brother Alexander (\"Alick\") and sister Joan, and decided to return to England.<ref name=\"Ottaway 2009 17\">{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=17}}.</ref>\n\nAs her family came from [[Porthleven]], Cornwall, Nora Gibson settled first in [[Penzance]]. Gibson started school in England at the same school as his sister, West Cornwall College.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=14}}.</ref> His mother then moved to London and he was sent as a boarder to Earl's Avenue School, a [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]], later known as St George's, in [[Folkestone]], Kent.<ref name=\"Ottaway 2009 17\"/>\n\nIn 1932 Gibson started at [[St Edward's School, Oxford]], the same school as [[Douglas Bader]] where he was also placed in the same house, Cowell's. Gibson's housemaster was A. F. \"Freddie\" Yorke who became Gibson's guardian.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=13}}.</ref>\n\nFollowing her return from India, Gibson's mother developed a drinking problem which escalated into [[alcoholism]]. Her behaviour became increasingly erratic and sometimes violent towards her children.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|pp=18\u201319}}.</ref> The school organised lodgings for Gibson and his brother during the school holidays. Nora's younger sister, Mrs Beatrice (\"Gwennie\") Christopher, gave Gibson his own room at her house. Her husband, John, helped Nora out with school fees. They also both attended some school functions to support their nephews.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|pp=25\u201326}}.</ref>\n\nGibson was an average student academically and played for the Rugby Second XV. His interests included science and photography. At one stage as a teenager, he seems to have become interested and quite expert in the workings of [[Theatre organ|cinema organs]]. He read all kinds of books, especially the [[King Arthur|Arthurian legends]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. His favourite play was ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|pp=23\u201324}}.</ref> He was made a house [[Prefect#Academic|prefect]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=29}}.</ref>\n\nFrom an early age Gibson wanted to fly. He had a picture of his boyhood hero, [[Albert Ball|Albert Ball VC]], the First World War [[flying ace]], on his bedroom wall at his aunt's house. His ambition was to become a civilian test pilot. He wrote for advice to [[Vickers]], receiving a reply from their chief test pilot, Captain [[Joseph Summers|Joseph \"Mutt\" Summers]], who wrote that Gibson should first learn to fly by joining the RAF on a short service commission. Gibson applied to the RAF, but was rejected when he failed the Medical Board; the probable reason that his legs were too short. His later application was successful, and his personal file included the remark \"satisfactory leg length test carried out\". He commenced a short service commission in November 1936.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|pp=30\u201331}}.</ref>\n\n==Initial military service==\n===Initial military training===\nGibson commenced his flying training on 16 November 1936 at the Bristol Flying School, [[RAF Yatesbury|Yatesbury]], with No. 6 Flying Training Course and with civilian instructors. Owing to poor weather the course did not conclude until 1 January 1937. After some leave, he then moved to No. 24 (Training) Group at [[RAF Uxbridge]] for his RAF basic training. He was commissioned with the rank of [[acting pilot officer]] with effect from 31 January 1937.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=18}}</ref>{{sfn|Gazette|34371|p=1086}} He then underwent further flying training as a member of the junior section of No. 5 Flying Training Course at 6 Flying Training School, [[RAF Netheravon]]. He was awarded his [[Aviator badge#United Kingdom|pilot's wings]] on 24 May 1937.\n\nAs part of the Advanced Training Squadron, during summer 1937, he participated in further training at [[RAF Sutton Bridge|No. 3 Armament Training Station]], [[Sutton Bridge#Wartime Sutton Bridge|Sutton Bridge]], Lincolnshire. He opted for bombers as these gave experience in multi-engined planes, this being typical for individuals planning on a civilian flying career. He returned to Netheravon and graduated on 31 August 1937. He passed all his ground exams first time, with an average of 77.29% and a flying rating of \"average\".<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=17\u201321}}.</ref> However, his rating as a companion was below average owing to his sometimes rude and condescending behaviour towards junior ranks and ground crews in particular.{{sfn|Hastings|2005|p=218}}\n\n===No. 83 (Bomber) Squadron===\nGibson's initial posting was to [[No. 83 Squadron RAF|No. 83 (Bomber) Squadron]], stationed at [[Edinburgh Airport|RAF Turnhouse]], west of [[Edinburgh]]. He was assigned to 'A' Flight and was placed under the supervision of [[Pilot Officer]] Anthony \"Oscar\" Bridgman. The Squadron was flying [[Hawker Hind]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=25\u201326}}.</ref> He joined a settled group of officers from similar minor public school backgrounds. As some stayed with the squadron for a few years, promotion was slow. He was promoted to [[pilot officer]] on 16 November 1937.<ref name=\"Morris 1994 28\u201329\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=28\u201329}}.</ref>{{sfn|Gazette|34457|p=7352}} His behaviour towards the ground crews continued to be perceived as unsatisfactory and they gave him the nickname the \"Bumptious Bastard\".<ref name=\"Morris 1994 30\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=30}}.</ref>\n\nIn March 1938, the Squadron was transferred from [[No. 2 Group RAF|No. 2 Group]] to [[No. 5 Group RAF|No. 5 Group]] and relocated to [[RAF Scampton]]. In June they moved to [[RAF Leuchars]] for an armaments training camp.<ref name = \"ott34\">{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=34}}.</ref> From October the squadron started their conversion to the [[Handley Page Hampden]], which was completed by January 1939.<ref name = \"ott36\">{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=36}}.</ref> At a Court of Inquiry in October 1938, Gibson was found guilty of negligence after a taxiing incident at [[RAF Hemswell]].<ref name=\"Morris 1994 28\u201329\"/> He spent Christmas Day 1938 in hospital at [[RAF Rauceby]] with [[chickenpox]]. He was then sent on convalescent leave, returning to the squadron in late January.<ref name=\"ott36\"/>\n\nIn Spring 1939 the squadron took part in an armaments training camp at [[HMS Fieldfare|RAF Evanton]] near [[Invergordon]] in Scotland.<ref name=\"Morris 1994 30\"/> With the likelihood of war increasing and as part of a plan to improve standards, Gibson was sent on a navigation course at [[Hamble-le-Rice|Hamble]] near [[Southampton]]. He did not appear to take the course seriously, but passed with an average mark. The instructor added the comment \"could do well\". He was due to leave the RAF, but was retained owing to the outbreak of hostilities in Abyssinia.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=33}}.</ref> In June he was promoted to flying officer.<ref name = \"ott37\">{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=37}}.</ref>{{sfn|Gazette|34700|p=6659}} On 25 July the squadron made a long-distance flight to the south of France. They participated in Home Defence exercises over London in August. He then went on his summer leave. At this stage of his career, he had never flown or landed a plane at night.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=35\u201336}}.</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n\n===First operational tour: No. 83 Squadron, Bomber Command===\nGibson was recalled from leave back to Scampton by telegram on 31 August 1939. Gibson flew on 3 September 1939, two days after the start of the Second World War. He was one of the pilots selected to attack the German fleet, which was near [[Bombing of Wilhelmshaven in World War II|Wilhelmshaven]]. He took off at 18:15. The operation was aborted owing to bad weather and he landed back at Scampton around 23:00. On 5 September while in the Mess, he was bitten by a dog. His arm was put in a sling and he was granted 36 hours leave. This allowed him to attend his brother's wedding in Rugby, where he was Alick's best man. On his return, the squadron had moved to [[Manchester Airport|Ringway]] near [[Manchester]] under the Scatter Scheme. They were there for 10 days. The squadron did not fly on another operation until December, during the [[Phoney War]].<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=37\u201340}}.</ref>\n\nIn February 1940, Gibson was one of the members of the squadron put on temporary secondment to [[Coastal Command]] at [[RAF Lossiemouth]]. On 27 February, he participated in an operation that was sent to attack a [[U-Boat]]. However, owing to various communications problems, one of the aircraft dropped its bombs on a [[Royal Navy]] [[submarine]]. The senior officers involved with the incident were censured for their failure to bring the squadron up to a satisfactory standard. The squadron then underwent a period of intensive training.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=50\u201353}}.</ref>\n\nThe period from April to September 1940 was one of the most operationally intense periods of Gibson's career. He completed 34 operations in 5 months, with 10 in June. The type of operation varied from [[Glossary of RAF code names|\"gardening\"]] \u2013 laying mines in various seaways and harbour entrances \u2013 to attacks on capital ships, as well as attacks on ground-based military and economic targets. During this time, he acquired a reputation for being seemingly fearless, particularly as he was willing to fly in marginal weather. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) on 9 July 1940.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=66}}.</ref>{{sfn|Gazette|34892|p=4177}} He was trained for a low-level attack on the [[Dortmund-Ems canal]], but he missed the actual raid on 12 August. On his return from a raid on [[Lorient]] on 27 August, he spotted a [[Dornier Do 215]] and attacked it. He was credited with a \"probable\" kill. He was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] on 3 September 1940.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=59}}.</ref>{{sfn|Gazette|34996|p=6633}}  His last operation with the squadron was to [[Berlin]] on 23 September 1940. [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]], then the [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) No. 5 Group, later described Gibson as the \"most full-out fighting pilot\" under his command at this time.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=72}}.</ref>\n\nAs was usual practice, to give pilots a rest from operations, Gibson was posted as a flying instructor to No. 14 [[Operational Training Unit]] (OTU) at [[RAF Cottesmore]]. He was there for two weeks, part of which was spent on leave, but he did not settle. He was then transferred to No. 16 OTU at [[RAF Upper Heyford]]. Meanwhile, Air Marshal [[Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside|Sholto Douglas]], [[Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]], and Air Vice Marshal [[Trafford Leigh-Mallory]], AOC [[No. 12 Group RAF|No. 12 (Fighter) Group]], made an appeal to Harris for bomber pilots with their night-flying experience to fly night fighters. Gibson volunteered. Harris wrote a letter introducing the pilots, which included the comment \"a hand-picked bunch of which Gibson is the best\". Harris agreed to help Gibson's career when he had completed this tour with \"the best command within my power\".<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=72\u201374}}.</ref>\n\n===Second operational tour: No. 29 Squadron, Fighter Command===\nGibson was ordered to report on 13 November 1940 to [[No. 29 Squadron RAF|No. 29 Squadron]] as the commander of 'A' Flight. The squadron was stationed at [[RAF Digby]], but flew from a small satellite field at [[RAF Wellingore]] about six miles away. The officers' mess was nearby in The Grange. When he arrived, the Commanding Officer, [[Squadron Leader]] Charles Widdows, was in the process of rebuilding the squadron following an outbreak of indiscipline that nearly led to its disbandment during July 1940. He was weeding out under-performing pilots and replacing his flight commanders. Gibson attracted some hostility from some longer-standing members of the squadron. because as one of these new flight commanders, he was seen as part of Widdows' reforms and he had been chosen over an existing member of the squadron. He had also come from a Bomber squadron. The root cause of the low morale was a lack of combat success. The [[Bristol Blenheim]] was not designed as a night fighter and the [[airborne interception]] (AI) was still in its very early days of development. Also, Widdows was required to split the squadron up with a few pilots each at Ternhill, Kirton and Wittering and with no more than half at Digby at any one time. Gibson flew six operations in Blenheims.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=77\u201379}}.</ref>\n\nThe squadron started to convert to the [[Bristol Beaufighter|Bristol Beaufighter I]] and Widdows personally supervised his pilots during their conversion.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=79}}.</ref> Gibson's first flight in a Beaufighter was on 1 December 1940. He then undertook some intensive training on AI procedure. He found the night-fighter culture very different from bombers as the two-man crew had to work as a team with the pilot relying on the guidance of the AI operator t<nowiki/>o find their targets. Gibson made his first operational flight in a Beaufighter on 10 December with Sergeant Taylor as his AI operator. That winter saw bad weather and he flew only three operations in the whole of January. He claimed a kill on 12 March, but it was not confirmed.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=88}}.</ref> However, his kill on 14 March was confirmed as a [[Heinkel He 111]]. He went to [[Skegness]] to collect the tail assembly as trophy for the squadron and the crew's dinghy for himself.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=89\u201390}}.</ref> He was attacked by an intruder when landing at Wellingore on 8 April. Gibson was unharmed, but his AI operator, Sergeant Bell, was injured in the leg.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=90\u201391}}.</ref>\n\nIn April, Widdows obtained a transfer for the squadron from 12 to 11 Group and a move to [[RAF West Malling]] in Kent. Gibson flew down with him on 25 April to inspect the facilities. The full squadron flew down on 29 April.<ref name=\"Morris 1994 91\u201392\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=91\u201392}}.</ref> Gibson was promoted to acting squadron leader towards the end of June 1941 and started to deputise for the commander in his absence. Widdows was promoted to station command and was replaced by Wing Commander Edward Colbeck-Welch. Gibson claimed two more kills which were confirmed. Another unidentified bomber, possibly a [[Heinkel]], was claimed in flames on 3/4 May.<ref name = \"M92\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=92}}.</ref> On 6 July he downed a Heinkel He 111H-5 of 8/KG4 near [[Sheerness]].<ref name=\"M92\"/> His AI operator on all his successful claims was Sergeant R.H. James, who was awarded a [[Distinguished Flying Medal]]. However, the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'''s bombing offensive was tailing off and Gibson started to become bored by the relative safety, and began to describe patrols as \"stooge patrols\" in his log book.  He made some further interceptions but his guns or cannons failed. He was also concerned by his relative lack of success compared with his fellow flight commander [[Bob Braham]].<ref name=\"Morris 1994 91\u201392\"/> He seems to have been happy at West Malling and said \"Of all the airfields in Great Britain, here, many say, including myself, we have the most pleasant\". His final patrols with the squadron were flown on 15 December. He left with both flying and gunnery ratings of above average. He was awarded a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his DFC.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=74}}.</ref>{{sfn|Gazette|35276|p=5360}}\n\nAgain, as a rest from operations, Gibson was due to be posted to an OTU, this time No. 51 OTU, [[RAF Cranfield]] as Chief Flying Instructor. By now he had decided he wanted to return to bombers. Despite a visit to HQ No. 5 Group on 15 December to petition for a transfer, Fighter Command insisted he had to go to Cranfield.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=95}}.</ref> His opportunity came a few weeks later when on 22 February 1942, Arthur Harris was appointed [[Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (AOC-in-C) of Bomber Command. Harris fulfilled his promise made in September 1940. He called Gibson for an interview. On 22 March, Harris wrote to Air Vice Marshal [[John Slessor]], AOC No. 5 Group, explaining his intention to promote Gibson to acting [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] to put him in command of a Lancaster squadron. Harris suggested [[No. 207 Squadron RAF|No. 207 Squadron]]. Slessor exercised his discretion and appointed Gibson CO of [[No. 106 Squadron RAF|No. 106 Squadron]]. Gibson was posted from No. 51 OTU and sent on leave until April, which he spent in south Wales.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=99\u2013100}}.</ref>\n\n===Third operational tour: No. 106 Squadron, Bomber Command===\nWhen the newly promoted Wing Commander Gibson joined No. 106 Squadron at [[RAF Coningsby]], morale was good, but there was serious disappointment with the new twin-engined [[Avro Manchester]] because its [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]] [[Rolls-Royce Vulture|Vulture]] engines were unreliable. Therefore, the squadron was scheduled to convert to the four-engined [[Avro Lancaster]], equipped with [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engines as soon as they became available.<ref name = \"morris105\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=105}}.</ref>\n\nGibson eased himself back into bomber operational flying with a mine-laying operation in the Baltic on 22 April 1942.<ref name = \"morris105\"/> and completed three more sorties in the Manchester during the following 3 weeks.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=350}}.</ref>\n\nApril 1942 was a good month for the squadron. They flew on eighteen nights, six consecutively and the improvements in performance were noted by analysts at both No. 5 Group and Bomber Command.<ref name = \"morris105\"/> The Lancasters started to arrive during May and an ad hoc training plan was started while normal operations were maintained. Gibson made his first flight in a Lancaster in early May.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=106\u2013107}}.</ref>\n\nAs a commander, Gibson's main concern was to be seen to share the risk.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=104}}.</ref> He continued to show unremitting aggression with a selectivity towards harder targets rather than easier ones. He expected the same determination from everyone on the squadron. He was ruthless in screening crews for reliability. The station's Medical Officer became expert in determining which crews were simply unlucky in contrast with genuine malingerers. However he was capable of serious misjudgements on occasions, and could be prone to unreasonable outbursts and the persecution of some crews and their members.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=112\u2013114}}.</ref>\n\nLike Widdows, he carefully supervised new crews and eased them into operational flying with \"Nasturtium training\" \u2013 mine-laying and then easier targets. He was pressurised to expose them earlier to greater risks and he acquired a reputation for not accepting any interference in how he ran the squadron.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=105\u2013106}}.</ref>\n\nGibson's exercise of summary discipline tended towards constructive tasks aimed at improving the efficiency of the squadron such as maintenance of aircraft, engines or weapons<ref name=\"Morris 1994 113\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=113}}.</ref> He was responsible for the emergence of an inner circle of officers who shared his intensity for operations. Their off-duty activities included swimming, water polo and shooting. However, his behaviour towards NCOs and ground crews could still be a problem.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=112}}.</ref> Soon after his arrival, the NCOs perceived one incident he was involved in with them as particularly high-handed and the ground crews quickly gave him the nickname \"The Boy Emperor\".<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=104\u2013105}}.</ref> Gibson got on better with his own class and background than with \"other ranks and colonials\". Bomb-aimer George \"Johnny\" Johnson of Joe McCarthy's crew said that on 106 Squadron he was known as the 'Arch-Bastard' because of his strict discipline, and he did not mix with the lower ranks or talk to NCOs or ground crews. A little man, he was arrogant, bombastic and a strict disciplinarian but \"had something to be bombastic about\" and was a \"true leader ... though he never spoke to or even acknowledged me.\" {{sfn|Nichol|2015|p=19}}\n\nOn 11 May, he was hospitalised at RAF Rauceby. The exact reason is unknown, but suggestions include a sinus or middle ear problem. He was then sent on two weeks convalescent leave. This absence meant he was unable to participate in Operation Millennium, the \"1000 Bomber raids\", the first of which was made on [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|Cologne]] on 30 May 1942. He found this frustrating because this raid saw the introduction of the [[Bomber stream]]. This was where the aircraft were concentrated together in an attempt to overwhelm the defences, with each allocated a specific place, height band, and time slot.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=107\u2013108}}.</ref> This period saw the introduction of aiming-point photography. Gibson tried it out and then encouraged all aircrews to become \"photo minded\". Obtaining good aiming point photographs quickly became a competition both within, and between squadrons.<ref name=\"Morris 1994 113\"/>\n\nOn his return he continued to build up his experience with the Lancaster. He flew with his friend, pilot John Hopgood on 4 July and then on a long cross-country flight the day after, 5 July.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=110}}.</ref> He made his first operational flight in a Lancaster on 8 July with [[Dave Shannon]] as his second pilot. They were together again on 11 July when they went to [[Danzig]]. They were appalled when they were sent on a daylight Mohling raid to the [[Krupp Arms Works|Krupps]] in [[Essen]] on 18 July. It was known as a difficult and dangerous target at night and they were relieved to be recalled when near [[Vlissingen]]. They jettisoned their bombs over the sea before returning.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=110\u2013111}}.</ref>\n\nThe squadron was selected for special training in the use of two kinds of new bombsight for use with a special bomb designed for attacks on capital ships. However, Gibson advised that the aircraft should not attack any ships below 8,500 feet. They put this training into practice with a marathon flight to [[Gdynia]] on 27 August 1942. The targets were [[German battleship Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']] and [[German battleship Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']]. Gibson again flew with Shannon and they swapped places during the flight. There was significant unexpected haze over the target when they arrived. Gibson's bomb aimer, Squadron Leader Richardson, a bombing instructor from [[Manby|RAF Manby]], requested twelve practice runs over the target, but they still failed to damage the ship. In fact no ships were damaged during the raid, but the squadron's preparation for the raid was noted by Harris and Air Commodore [[Alec Coryton]], the AOC No. 5 Group.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=116\u2013117}}.</ref>\n\nOn 30 September the squadron moved from Coningsby to [[RAF Syerston]] in [[Nottinghamshire]]. They expected this move to be only temporary while the runways were concreted, but problems at Coningsby meant it became permanent.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=117\u2013118}}.</ref>\n\nGibson quickly formed a good relationship with Syerston's station commander Group Captain [[Augustus Walker|\"Gus\" Walker]]. In October, they were required to conduct low-level training exercises with aircraft flying in formations of threes and sixes. This training was put to use in a raid on the 17th on [[Le Creusot]] in France. Gibson and Hopgood were among the pilots sent to attack the electric transformer station at nearby [[Montchanin]].<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=119\u2013120}}.</ref> Later in the month they started to attack Italian targets including Genoa, Milan and Turin.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=121}}.</ref> In November 1942 Gibson was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO).<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=91}}.</ref>{{sfn|Gazette|35791|p=5031}}\n\nOn 8 December Gibson did not fly. He was in the control room with Walker watching the aircraft taxiing for take-off. Walker noticed some incendiaries which had fallen out of the bomb bay of a reserve Lancaster located near the main bomb dump. The incendiaries had ignited. Walker drove out to the plane and tried to move the incendiaries with a rake. He lost his arm in the subsequent explosion of the 4000&nbsp;lb \"cookie\" bomb still in the aircraft's bomb bay. He was replaced by Group Captain Bussell.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=124\u2013125}}.</ref>\n\nOn 16 January 1943, Gibson took the [[BBC]]'s [[war correspondent]], Major [[Richard Dimbleby]] on a sortie to Berlin. Dimbleby described the raid in a later radio broadcast. Gibson was very pleased with the outcome, as he always wanted to communicate what life was like for the aircrews.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=135\u2013137}}.</ref> On 12 March, he made his final flight with the squadron to [[Stuttgart]]. He flew on three engines and was forced to stay low throughout the raid.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=140}}.</ref>\n\nBussell recommended Gibson for a Bar to his DSO, but this was reduced to a second Bar to his DFC at HQ No. 5 Group owing to the recent award of the DSO. However, Harris confirmed the Bar to Gibson's DSO with the comment \"any Captain who completes 172 sorties in outstanding manner is worth two DSOs if not a VC. Bar to DSO approved\".<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=141}}.</ref>{{sfn|Gazette|35963|p=1518}} Gibson was informed on 25 March, after he left the squadron.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=100}}.</ref>\n\nGibson was expecting to go on leave to Cornwall and was therefore shocked when he received a call from HQ No. 5 Group to inform him he was being posted there to write a book.<ref name = \"sweet96\">{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=96}}.</ref>\n\n==No. 617 Squadron and Operation Chastise==\n{{main|Operation Chastise}}\n\n===Formation of Squadron X===\nAfter the decision was made to attack the [[Ruhr]] dams, Harris decided to hand the direct responsibility for the detailed planning, preparation and execution to Air Vice Marshal [[Ralph Cochrane]], AOC No. 5 Group. Harris told him he must form a new squadron and nominated Gibson as the CO.<ref name = \"sweet96\"/>\n\nOn 18 March Gibson attended an interview at HQ No. 5 Group where Cochrane asked him if he was willing to fly on \"one more trip\". Gibson indicated that he was. He attended a further interview the following day when he was told that he was to command a new squadron, which would be required to fly low at night with an objective that had to be achieved by 19 May. At this meeting, he was introduced to Group Captain [[John Whitworth]], the commander of RAF Scampton where the new squadron was to be stationed.<ref name = \"sweet97\">{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=97}}.</ref>\n\n====Selection of aircrew====\nUnusually, Gibson was allowed to select crews for the new squadron with help from Group Captain Satterly, the Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) No. 5 Group. The initial intention was for the squadron to be formed from volunteer tour-expired crews. Bomber Command then stated they should have completed or nearly completed two tours of operations.<ref name = \"sweet97\"/>\n\nHe selected Squadron Leaders Maudslay and Young as his flight commanders. His selection of Young resulted in the transfer of the whole of 'C' Flight from [[No. 57 Squadron RAF|No. 57 Squadron]] into the new one. Some crews or pilots were known to him including Hopgood and Shannon, who by this time had transferred from No. 106 squadron to the [[Pathfinder (RAF)|Pathfinders]] and No. 83 Squadron. He selected [[Harold Brownlow Martin|Harold \"Mick\" Martin]] for his low-flying expertise. Of Gibson's regular crew from No. 106 Squadron, only Hutchinson, the wireless operator, volunteered for this new one. He brought in a friend, Taerum, a Canadian navigator. Taerum in turn brought in another friend, Spafford, a bomb-aimer and they joined Hutchinson in Gibson's crew. In the end some crews had not completed one tour, with some individuals having flown fewer than ten operations.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=98\u201399}}.</ref>\n\nGibson was strict in screening the crews during training. That not all the crews were known to him is reflected in how two crews were posted off the squadron as not satisfactory and another crew chose to leave after their navigator was deemed unsatisfactory.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=102\u2013103}}.</ref>\n\n===Training of No. 617 Squadron===\nGibson arrived at Scampton on 21 March. His office was on the 1st floor in No.2 Hangar. His immediate task was to get the general administration organised. He delegated this and the adjutant assigned from No. 57 Squadron was quickly replaced with Flight Lieutenant Humphreys from Syerston. Humphreys was instrumental in the rapid establishment of the squadron.<ref name = \"sweet102\">{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=102}}.</ref> The ground staff started to muster from 21 March and were fully present by 27 March. Flight Sergeant (Discip) Powell inspected them and weeded out those he felt other squadrons had off-loaded.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=99}}.</ref> The aircrews started to arrive from 24 March.<ref name=\"sweet97\"/>\n\nOn 24 March Gibson travelled to Burhill near Weybridge for his first meeting with [[Barnes Wallis]]. Wallis discovered Gibson had not been cleared for a full briefing and therefore could not be told the targets. Wallis was able to explain the design and operation of the new weapon, [[Bouncing bomb|Upkeep]] and showed him films from its trials. It was a depth charge which, if rotated with backspin and dropped at the correct speed and altitude, would bounce across the surface of a body of water towards a target. This bouncing behaviour gave it its nickname the [[bouncing bomb]]. The crews usually referred to it as a mine.<ref name=\"sweet102\" />\n\nOn 27 March Group Captain Satterley provided Gibson with \"most secret\" written orders, including a description of the attack and the general plan for the squadron's preliminary training. From these Gibson learnt that the targets were \"lightly defended special targets\" which reduced his suspicion that they were training to attack the [[German battleship Tirpitz|Tirpitz]]. The orders included a list of nine lakes and reservoirs in the Midlands and North Wales, for training flights and target practice. They included [[Eyebrook Reservoir]], near [[Uppingham]], Rutland, [[Abberton Reservoir]] near Colchester and [[Derwent Reservoir (Derbyshire)|Derwent Reservoir]] and some of the earliest flights made by the new No. 617 Squadron, were reconnaissance flights over these bodies of water.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=101}}.</ref> A recommendation to maximize the training time available was to use simulated night flying as developed by the USAAF.<ref name=\"sweet102\" /> This required the cockpit to be covered in blue celluloid and the pilots and bomb aimers to wear goggles with amber-tinted lenses. Gibson wanted six aeroplanes converted but only two became available, the first on 11 April.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=106}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Upkeep in Lancaster.jpg|thumb|\"Upkeep\" [[bouncing bomb]] used for dam busting bomb mounted under Lancaster B III (Special). The chain was driven by a hydraulic motor and gave the bomb its [[backspin]].]]\nAnother important factor was the need for a specially adapted version of the Lancaster, the B.III (Special), officially the \"Type 464 (Provisioning)\". The bomb bay doors were removed and the ends of the bay were covered with fairings. Upkeep was suspended on pivoted, vee-shaped struts which sprang apart when the bomb-release button was pressed. A drive belt and pulley to rotate the bomb at 500 rpm was mounted on the starboard strut and driven by a hydraulic motor housed in the forward fairing. The mid-upper turret was removed and a more bulbous bomb aimer's blister was fitted. The first adapted aircraft arrived at Scampton on 8 April.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=108}}.</ref>\n\nOn 28 March, Gibson made his first flight to explore the low-flying requirement. He took Hopgood and Young with him and found low flying during daylight satisfactory but during an attempt at dusk the difficulty of their task became apparent, when they nearly ditched.<ref name=\"sweet102\" /> On 29 March, Gibson was shown scale models of the [[M\u00f6hne Reservoir|Moehne]] and [[Sorpe Dam|Sorpe]] dams by Cochrane at HQ 5 Group.  He then attended a further meeting with Wallis at Weybridge. At this meeting he rejected Wallis's proposal of a daylight raid.<ref name=\"sweet102\" />\n\nThe squadron commenced daily flying training at the beginning of April with long cross-country flights with precise turning points to develop their navigation skills.<ref name=\"sweet102\" /> They then started to practise low flying over water. The squadron completed over a thousand flying hours by the end of April and Gibson was able to report to Whitworth, that they could fly pinpoint to pinpoint at low level at night, could bomb using a rangefinder and fly over water at {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Sweetman 2002 103\">{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=105, 103}}.</ref> On 24 April Wallis made a request for the altitude to be reduced to {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Gibson reported on 27 April that it was possible and the training was adapted accordingly.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=156}}.</ref>\n\nGibson was closely involved with discussions about the design, trial and approval of the solutions developed for the various technical issues encountered. These included the Dann bomb sight and the 'Spotlight Altimeter Calibrator', which was the name given to the spotlights attached to the Lancasters, to ensure the determination of the correct height above a body of water.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=106\u2013109}}.</ref> Security was Gibson's constant concern and he was especially displeased to learn from his bombing leader Watson that he had been shown details of the targets within days of his arrival at RAF Manston. Gibson wrote to Cochrane who raised his concerns about this 'criminal' breach of security at the highest levels.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=109}}.</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning of May squadron training shifted to the tactical aspects of the operation.<ref name=\"Sweetman 2002 103\"/> On 1 May Gibson communicated to Wallis his confidence that the operation would succeed. He repeated this optimism in his weekly report to Whitworth on 4 May where he described the squadron as \"ready to operate\".<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=111}}.</ref> On 6 May he held a conference with the pilots to explain the tactical aspects. They flew a rehearsal that evening with Gibson directing a group by radio telephony (R/T) on the spot over the Eyebrook and Abberton Reservoirs. A second group went to the Derwent Reservoir and a third to the Wash.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=112}}.</ref> On 10 May, Satterly sent the draft handwritten operation order to Whitworth for review and revision, to be returned by 1600 on 12 May. It included, how the squadron would be split into waves to attack the targets, reserves, likely defences and exit routes; Gibson provided detailed comments.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=113\u2013114}}.</ref> Despite Gibson's confidence, there still had not been a successful release of a live Upkeep, which took until 11 May. Most of the crews were able to practise at Reculver from 11 to 14 May. Gibson practised at [[Reculver]] in Lancaster ED932/AJ-G, the aircraft he used on the raid. The aircraft's call letters were the same as his father's initials: AJG. On 14 May the squadron flew on a full dress rehearsal designed to simulate the routes, targets and the geography of the raid. Gibson took Whitworth with him and described the outcome in his log book as \"completely successful\".<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=116}}.</ref>\n\nCochrane travelled to Scampton on 15 May to inform Whitworth and Gibson that the operation would take place the following evening, over 16/17 May. At about 16:00, Gibson travelled with Cochrane on his return to Grantham. Here he discussed the draft operation order with Satterly and Wing Commander Dunn, No. 5 Group's chief signals officer. He returned to Scampton and at 18:00 at Whitworth's house, along with Wallis, he briefed Young and Maudsley, his flight commanders, and Hopgood, the deputy leader, and Hay, the squadron's bombing leader. He had obtained Cochrane's verbal agreement for Hopgood and Hay to attend, which proved beneficial as Hopgood was able to point out the new defences at Huls. After the meeting broke up, Whitworth informed Gibson that [[Nigger (dog)|his dog]], named Nigger, had been killed in a road accident. It did not seem to affect Gibson outwardly. He was aware how superstitious some aircrew could be, as the dog was the squadron's mascot. Wallis feared it was a dreadful omen.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=131\u2013133}}.</ref>\n\n==Raid of 16/17 May 1943==\n===Briefings during 16 May===\nThe first thing Gibson did early on the morning of 16 May was to report to the Medical Officer because of pains in his feet. The MO had previously diagnosed [[gout]] but he could not prescribe painkillers as these might affect Gibson's alertness when flying. As Gibson felt he had no choice but to fly, he decided to continue as he was.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=163}}.</ref> The first briefing was at midday when Gibson and Wallis explained the details of the raid to the pilots and navigators. The next one was at 14:30 and included the bomb aimers and gunners. At 18:00 all the aircrew were called to a final briefing in the upper briefing room, which was guarded.\n\nGibson explained how they were going \"to attack the great dams of Germany\". He then introduced Wallis who explained how Upkeep would be used against the dams. Cochrane then spoke and emphasised how they would do \"a tremendous amount of damage\" but their exploits would remain secret. Gibson explained the operational details again and made it clear no crews were to return with their mine. He handed over to Wing Commander Dunn who explained the signals procedures. The meeting broke up and the crews went for their meal at 19:30.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=150\u2013151}}.</ref>\n\n===Flight to the M\u00f6hne Dam===\n[[File:Wing Commander Guy Gibson (in door of aircraft) and his crew board their Avro Lancaster bomber for No. 617 Squadron's raid on the Ruhr Dams, 16 May 1943. CH18005.jpg|right|thumb|189x189px]]\nGibson was driven out to his aircraft [[List of RAF Squadron Codes|AJ-G]] by his regular driver, Eileen Strawson. Cochrane came out to Gibson's aircraft to wish him well. A photo was taken of the crew entering the aircraft beforehand.  Gibson took off at 21:39 with Hopgood and Martin. They flew out over Skegness and Cromer. The winds were stronger than forecast, as a result they made landfall later and further south than expected. Gibson had the route adjusted to [[Roosendaal]] and they flew on unopposed to the [[Rhine]]. Again they were too far south, about {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the expected landmark and received flak from barges on the river and batteries on the banks. They had similar navigation problems until they reached the target.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=155\u2013156}}.</ref> They found the defences at the M\u00f6hne Dam as described at the briefing. There was an active light flak battery but no searchlights or barrage balloons.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=161}}.</ref>\n\n===Attack on the M\u00f6hne Dam===\nGibson made a dummy run over the dam to look the target over and reported how he \"liked the look of it\". The second formation of three led by Young arrived at this point. Gibson made his bombing run but the bomb was released short and did not damage the dam. It took about five minutes for the water to settle down after the explosion. He then called in Hopgood to make his attack. He watched as Hopgood's aircraft was hit by flak, caught fire and then exploded. Hopgood's crew had managed to release their bomb but it overshot and destroyed an electrical station below the dam. Gibson waited again for the water to settle. He then called in [[Harold Brownlow Martin|Martin]] to make his attack but this time decided to fly with him, parallel and slightly ahead, to draw off the flak. Martin's mine did not damage the dam. Gibson called in Young and Martin flew alongside him, whilst Gibson flew along another evasive path. It was not obvious until [[David Maltby|Maltby]] started the next bombing run that Young's mine had breached the dam. At 00:56, Hutchinson sent the code word \"N I G G E R\" (sic), the name of Gibson's recently killed dog, to signal the breach to HQ 5 Group and then confirmed it on their request. Martin and Maltby departed for home.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=161\u2013166}}.</ref>\n\n===Attack on the Eder Dam===\nAfter breaching the M\u00f6hne dam, Gibson flew with Young as his deputy and the remaining aircraft that still had their mines, to the Eder See. Shannon had arrived with Young while Maudslay and Knight had arrived while Hopgood had been preparing for his bombing run. The flight to the Eder See lasted about 14 minutes. They did not fly in formation and did not encounter any opposition. The dam was difficult to find and there was early morning mist starting to gather over the water. Shannon arrived too far west and found the Rehbuch dam. Gibson's aircraft fired red Very lights to help him find the others. Although the dam's defences consisted of only two sentries with rifles, it was still a difficult target owing to the approach. Shannon flew three dummy runs and then Maudsley flew two. Shannon flew two more dummy runs before finally releasing his bomb, which did not breach the dam. When Maudslay released his bomb it hit a parapet and his plane appeared to get caught in the explosion. However, there were messages from the aircraft and it is possible that it survived this and crash-landed later. Gibson called in Astell but did not seem to realise he was not present. He then called in Knight, who made a single dummy run before releasing his bomb. It breached the dam. At 01:54, Hutchinson signalled the breach and then confirmed it.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=168\u2013171}}.</ref>\n\n===Return flight, debriefing and questionnaire===\nGibson returned via the M\u00f6hne dam and the third exit route.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=174}}.</ref> At 02:10, he received an enquiry from HQ 5 Group, asking whether any crews were available to attack the Sorpe. He replied that there were not. He had an uneventful flight home and landed at 04:15 with just three small holes in his aircraft's tail.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=173}}.</ref> He attended a debriefing and like all the pilots who returned from this raid, he had to complete a special questionnaire about the target and behaviour of the weapon. The pilots were invited to make additional comments. Gibson's comments included how VHF had proved a \"perfect\" method to control the raid.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|pp=176\u2013177}}.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nOne of Gibson's first tasks after his own debriefing was to deal with the early returns. He accepted that Munro's aircraft had sustained significant damage and Rice's mine had fallen off. Gibson was furious with Anderson because he returned with his bomb, despite the instructions at the briefing. The crew were posted off the squadron with immediate effect, although the squadron's official records show they left in early June. At 08:30 he received a lengthy message from Cochrane thanking him for his efforts in making the raid a success.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=236}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cochrane, Gibson, King George VI and Whitworth discussing the Dambusters Raid.jpg|thumb|right|Air Vice Marshal [[Ralph Cochrane]], Wing Commander Guy Gibson, King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] and Group Captain [[John Whitworth]] discuss the Dambuster Raid during the King's visit to RAF Scampton on 27 May 1943.]]\nOn 27 May the [[George VI|King]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen]] visited Scampton. There was lunch in the officers' mess followed by an inspection of the Squadron. Gibson showed the King models and photos of the dams. The King chose the motto for the new squadron 'Apres Moi Le Deluge'.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=178\u2013179}}.</ref> On 28 May [[Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso|Archibald Sinclair]], the [[Secretary of State for Air]] visited Scampton.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=179}}.</ref> Gibson then went on a fortnight's leave to Cornwall where he spent most of his time fishing.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=181}}.</ref>\n\nAs the full extent of the losses \u2013 eight aircraft and 56 crew \u2013 became apparent, Wallis became distraught at the human cost. Humphreys and Hevron started the task of informing the next of kin. A party was organised at [[RAF Woodhall Spa]] on the evening of 17 May and Gibson attended but he made sure a beer was sent to Humphreys with his compliments. It took three days to complete the telegrams and follow-up letters. Gibson continued his usual practice of adding personal comments to letters where possible.\n\nOn 18 May, there was a parade where Cochrane and Gibson made speeches to the squadron members. He then released the air crews from duty on seven days' leave and half the ground crew on three days' leave.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=238}}.</ref> Gibson went on weekend leave to Penarth. On the Sunday he received a call from Harris to inform him he had been awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC).{{sfn|Gazette|36030|p=2361}} His response was subdued as he felt responsible for those he had recruited and who had not returned, particularly Hopgood. He was reported as saying: \"It all seems so unfair\".<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=177}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Wing Commander Guy Gibson, Vc, Dso and Bar, Dfc and Bar, Commander of 617 Squadron (dambusters) at Scampton, Lincolnshire, 22 July 1943 TR1122.jpg|thumb|right|Wing Commander Guy Gibson (Right) and S/Ldr [[David Maltby]] (left) at RAF Scampton, on 22 July 1943 after the raid.]]\nOn 22 June, Gibson and all the other newly decorated members of 617 Squadron attended an investiture at [[Buckingham Palace]]. It was performed by the Queen as the King was in North Africa. She presented Gibson with his VC and the Bar to his DSO first, and in the process he became the most highly decorated serviceman in the country.<ref name=\"decoration\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=182}}.</ref> After the investitures all the crews went on to the Hungaria Restaurant to a dinner arranged by [[Avro|AV Roe]], the builders of the Lancaster. Gibson was presented with a silver model of a Lancaster by the company's chairman, [[Thomas Sopwith]]. Also at the dinner were [[Roy Chadwick]], the designer of the Lancaster, and Wallis.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=183}}.</ref>\n\nHarris made arrangements to ensure Gibson was rested from operations and on 24 July he and his wife were invited to lunch at [[Chequers]] as guests of the Prime Minister, [[Winston Churchill]]. Here Gibson was shown a film smuggled out of Germany about the concentration camps.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=189\u2013190}}.</ref> On 2 August, Gibson made his last flight with 617 Squadron. He flew with his regular crew and his successor, Wing Commander [[George Holden (RAF officer)|George Holden]], to [[Eyebrook Reservoir]] to familiarise him with the technique to release Upkeep.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=192\u2013193}}.</ref>\n\n==Post-Chastise activities==\n\n===Tour of Canada and US===\nOn 3 August Gibson travelled to London to join the party accompanying the Prime Minister to the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quadrant Conference]] in [[Quebec]], Canada. Around midnight they were taken by a special train to [[HMNB Clyde|Faslane]] where they boarded the [[RMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']], setting sail around 17:30 on 4 August.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=193}}.</ref>\n\nThe party included some of the most senior military figures such as [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]], Chief of Combined Operations and Air Chief Marshal [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Sir Charles Portal]], [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]]. Gibson was therefore an outsider, like fellow passenger, Brigadier [[Orde Wingate]], the [[Chindits]] leader. However, unlike Wingate, he seems to have found it easier to enter into shipboard life. [[Mary Soames, Baroness Soames|Mary Churchill]], who was travelling as her father's [[aide-de-camp]], found Gibson \"had all the aura of a hero\" and also \"very agreeable and debonair to talk to\". On the last evening of the voyage, on 8 August, after dinner, Gibson was invited to address the whole party on the Dams Raid.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=197}}.</ref>\n\nOn 9 August they arrived in [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], and were transferred by special trains to Quebec. A certain amount of disinformation circulated around their arrival including how Gibson had acted as the pilot on the aircraft that had flown Churchill across the Atlantic. They arrived at a time of significant tension between the British and Canadian governments. The Canadians were unhappy with the relative lack of credit being granted to the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]'s (RCAF) contribution to the war effort. On 11 August, Gibson attended a select luncheon with the Prime Minister, where he was introduced to the Canadian Prime Minister, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]]. He spent the rest of the afternoon at an RCAF recruiting centre.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=197\u2013198}}.</ref>\n\nOn 12 August Gibson attended a Press Conference arranged in his honour. It was hosted by Hon. C.G. Power, the Canadian air minister and attended by hundreds of journalists from around the world. Gibson responded to questions about the Dams Raid and revealed the Prime Minister called him \"Dam-buster\". Reports of the conference were enthusiastic. He attended engagements in the Quebec area. On 17 August, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] arrived at the Conference. Churchill arranged for Gibson to meet the President at a private meeting.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=198\u2013201}}.</ref>\n\nGibson left Quebec on 20 August to start the Canadian leg of his tour. It was a punishing schedule and included civic receptions and speeches, motorcades, interviews, broadcasts, along with travel. He went to [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]], [[Toronto]] and [[London, Ontario|London (Ontario)]]. As Churchill was in [[New York City|New York]], on 5 September, Gibson was diverted there to make a radio broadcast which was heard on station WJZ New York. In [[Winnipeg]] he met the family of Harvey Glinz, who had been killed on the Dams Raid when flying as the front-gunner in Barlow's crew. He then went on to training bases at [[Carberry, Manitoba|Carberry]], Rivers, Dafoe, [[Moose Jaw]] and Moss Bank.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=201\u2013204}}.</ref>\n\nOn 11 September he arrived in [[Calgary]]. Here he met the mother of the navigator in his own Dams Raid crew, Mrs Taerum. He spent time with her at home the following day. He also met Leading Aircraftman Robert Young, the younger brother of Squadron Leader Young, also killed on the Dams raid.  He continued on to [[Vancouver]] and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] before returning to Montreal and Ottawa in the east. He had a week's rest at the Seignory Club in Ottawa from 28 September to 3 October.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=204\u2013206}}.</ref>\n\nOn 4 October he began the United States leg of his tour in [[Washington, D.C.]]. He attended a major Press Conference at the offices of the British Information Service in New York on 7 October.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} This was \"at a time when the first American airmen were coming home 'tour expired' after 25 operations. During questions one young lady asked, 'Wing Commander Gibson, how many operations have you been on over Germany?' He replied, 'One hundred and seventy-four.' There was a stunned silence\".{{sfn|Thompson|1989|p=36}}\n\nOn 19 October, Gibson was invested with the Commander's Insignia to the [[Legion of Merit]] by General [[Henry H. Arnold]] at [[Bolling Field]] near Washington D.C. The decision to award him with the Legion of Merit was taken quickly. It was also exceptional. To avoid duplication American awards were, in general, not accepted for actions which had already earned a British medal. This allowed them to be restricted to cases where Americans wished to express particular gratitude. For example, they were often given for the air/sea rescue of American personnel.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=206}}.</ref>\nIt was announced formally in Britain in December 1943.{{sfn|Gazette|36271|p=5284}}\n\nGibson continued on to [[Chicago]], [[Minneapolis]] and then to [[Los Angeles]]. He stayed with the film director [[Howard Hawks]]. Most his time was spent in private, his reward for his gruelling tour. However, it is possible he might have been giving technical advice on a proposed film of the Dams Raid. Hawks had commissioned [[Roald Dahl]] to write a script for the film and had started to build models of the dams and Lancaster bombers. He was encouraged by Bomber Command's PR Department. However, when Wallis was shown the script, he thought it absurd, and the project was scrapped.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=207\u2013208}}.</ref>\n\nGibson returned to Montreal and flew back to Britain in a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberator]] being ferried across the Atlantic. He landed at [[Prestwick]] on 1 December and was met by a representative from the Ministry of Intelligence.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=208}}.</ref> On his return he was exhausted, but still went straight from home in London to Scampton to visit 617 Squadron. When he arrived he was informed that they had moved to Coningsby, and was driven over. He visited HQ 5 Group in an attempt to obtain an operational posting, but was declared non-operational sick and sent on a month's rest leave.  At the end of his leave he was due to be posted to the Directorate of Accidents with the order to write a book.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=217\u2013218}}.</ref> During this time he was hospitalised with [[Tonsillitis|Vincent's Angina]] on 17 December.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=141}}.</ref>\n\nThe view emerged that as a result of the tour he had acquired and retained an increased sense of his own importance. In July 1944 Harris wrote to Cochrane to comment that the Americans had \"spoiled young Gibson\".<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=210}}.</ref> Therefore, this route was not pursued again later in the war with other highly decorated airmen, such as [[Leonard Cheshire]].\n\n===Directorate for the Prevention of Accidents: writing ''Enemy Coast Ahead''===\nIn January 1944 Gibson was posted to the Directorate for the Prevention of Accidents. He appears to have been under orders to write a book. This posting was effectively a cover to give him the time and access to the resources he needed to complete it. It is possible either the Ministry of Intelligence or the RAF's publicity department wanted him to complete a book in order to counter the increasing criticisms of the Strategic Air Offensive.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=224}}.</ref>\n\nGibson was located in a small back room and had access to a dictaphone and typist. He did not seem to take well to his assignment initially. When Heveron travelled from Scampton to deliver some information about 617 Squadron, Heveron found him depressed and with long hair.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=223}}.</ref>\n\nHowever Gibson did seem to become increasingly enthusiastic about writing. His wife remembered his writing at home during weekends while he was at Staff College during March\u2013May 1944.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=226}}.</ref> The typescript survives of a draft Gibson submitted in summer 1944. His wife donated it to the [[Royal Air Force Museum London|RAF Museum]] at Hendon. The writing style confirms that Gibson wrote most of the book, because it includes his characteristic style of comments and humour, plus in places it is simply bad. Therefore, the book was not ghost-written, as some have suggested. The typescript includes corrections in his own hand. These may suggest he had the help of a professional editor while he was writing.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=222}}.</ref> The text was passed by the censors who edited out some of his more intolerant political and social views as well as operational information. He completed his final draft in September 1944.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=258\u2013259}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to an article published in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' in June 2013, the book's final title was one of seven suggested by Gibson himself in a letter written to publishers Pearn, Pollinger and Higham dated 1 August 1944.{{sfn|Duell|2013}} The full list of titles suggested by Gibson was:\n\n*''Four Years Lifetime''\n*''Flak-Fun-Fear''\n*''The Boys Die Young''\n*''[[Enemy Coast Ahead]]''\n*''Eight Are Missing''\n*''Reich Wreckers''\n*''By Fire and By Water''\n\n===Appearance on ''Desert Island Discs''===\nOn 19 February 1944 Gibson appeared as the Castaway{{sfn|''BBC''|1944}} on ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' with Roy Plomley.{{sfn|Morris|1994|pp=233\u2013234}}\n\nHis musical choices were:\n\n*''[[Warsaw Concerto]]'' by [[Richard Addinsell]] played by [[London Symphony Orchestra]]\n*\"[[Where or When]]\" (from ''[[Babes in Arms]]'') played by [[Jack Hylton]] & His Orchestra\n*\"A Thousand and One Nights Waltz\" by [[Johann Strauss II]]: Symphony Orchestra Conductor: Johann Stauss III\n*''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'' overture by [[Richard Wagner]] played by Berlin State Opera Orchestra\n*\"[[If I Had My Way]]\" performed by [[Bing Crosby]]\n*\"[[The Marines Hymn]]\" performed by [[Fred Waring]] & His Pennsylvanians\n*\"[[Royal Air Force March Past]]\" performed by The Central Band of The Royal Air Force\n*\"[[Ride of the Valkyries]]\" (from ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'') by [[Richard Wagner]] performed by Queens Hall Orchestra\n\n===Politics, prospective parliamentary candidate for Macclesfield===\n[[W. Garfield Weston|Garfield Weston]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Macclesfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Macclesfield]] was due to retire and was looking for a replacement. In February 1944 he approached Gibson to suggest Gibson consider standing for Parliament.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=228}}.</ref> Gibson agreed, but first he had to be selected by the local party. Gibson made visits to Macclesfield to campaign for selection. On one occasion he shared a platform with [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Lord Robert Vansittart]], who gave his name \u2013 Vansittartism \u2013 to a form of collective German guilt for the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=230}}.</ref> A short-list of candidates was drawn up, which also included Air Vice Marshal [[Don Bennett]].<ref name=\"Morris 1994 236\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=236}}.</ref> Gibson was selected by a narrow margin and became the Conservative [[prospective parliamentary candidate]] for the constituency.<ref name=\"Morris 1994 236\"/> Despite the constituency party's having taken him on knowing his circumstances as a serving officer, Gibson resigned as their candidate in August 1944 citing the demands of his service career.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=254}}.</ref>\n\n==Return to operations==\n\n===Staff College and Base Staff Officer===\nGibson attended a staff course at the RAF Staff College at [[Bulstrode Park]] near [[Gerrards Cross]] from the end of March to May 1944.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=147}}.</ref> He then went on leave. During the last week he got very restless as he learned about the D-Day landings. He feared the war would end before he could get back into the action. On his return he appealed straight to Harris. Four days later he was appointed as a staff officer at No. 55 Base, [[RAF East Kirkby]] to understudy to the Base Air Staff Officer (BASO). Duties included operational planning and liaison between the units within the Base.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=249}}.</ref>\n\nOn 5 July he flew in a Lancaster for the first time since leaving No. 617 Squadron. It was a test flight and the crew commented that he handled it well considering how long it had been since he had last flown.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=999}}.</ref> On 19 July he joined a Lancaster crew, possibly from No. 630 Squadron, located at East Kirkby, during an attack on a [[V-1 flying bomb]] launch site at [[Criel-sur-Mer]] in France. He pasted an aiming point photo from the operation in his log book.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=251\u2013252}}.</ref>\n\nOn 2 August he was posted to No. 54 Base, RAF Coningsby, where he arrived on the 4th. Coningsby was a centre for tactical innovation and home of the elite No. 54 Base Flight.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=253}}.</ref> Here he was exposed to intelligence that increased his concern that the war would end without him getting back into the action.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=255}}.</ref> At this stage he may have had Cochrane's consent for limited operational flying, provided it was non-participatory, short time over target and he could bail out over Allied-controlled territory.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=256}}.</ref>\n\nOn 15 August he flew in a [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|Lightning]] as an observer on a daylight raid over Deelen in the Netherlands. He made a similar flight in a Lightning a few days later to Le Havre. On 2 September he flew a [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] to [[Scatsta Airport|Scasta]] in [[Shetland]].<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=256\u2013257}}.</ref>\n\n===Death===\nOn 19 September an order came through from Bomber Command for No. 5 Group to prepare for an attack on [[Bremen]]. Planes from No. 5 Group would be responsible for all aspects of the operation, including target illumination and marking and control of the raid. Cochrane, the AOC, would be responsible for tactics and route planning.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=265}}.</ref> As the day progressed the weather forecast changed, and at 16:45 an order came through to change to the reserve targets at [[Rheydt]] and [[Moenchengladbach|Moenchen-Gladbach]].<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=267}}.</ref>\n\nAt the flight planning conference it was decided that three areas would be attacked simultaneously; they were designated as red, green and yellow. The red area was Rheydt town centre, where the attack would be fully controlled by a master bomber who would monitor the marking and coordinate the main force bombing. The tactics \u2013 dispersed marking \u2013 were untried and unrehearsed, and therefore would require expertise from the controller and markers.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=268\u2013269}}.</ref> The announcement that Gibson would be the controller was met with general incredulity. It was assumed it would be regular controller from No. 54 Base Flight or a qualified one from No. 627 Squadron. Some suspicion started to circulate that the proposed complexity may have come from Gibson and his lack of experience in marking techniques.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=272}}.</ref>\n\nAs Gibson did not have a regular navigator, one had to be found to fly with him. The first choice was ill, so Squadron Leader Jim Warwick was selected.<ref name=\"Morris 1994 273\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=273}}.</ref> He was the Station Navigation Officer and therefore screened from operations.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=257}}.</ref> There was also no serviceable Mosquito available at Coningsby for Gibson to use, so it was decided to use the reserve aircraft of No. 627 Squadron, located at RAF Woodhall Spa. Gibson and Warwick were driven over. When they arrived about 18:30, for unknown reasons, Gibson rejected the reserve aircraft ''KB213'' and insisted on using the Mosquito B.XX ''[[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|KB267]]'' instead. The crew who were expecting to fly in ''KB267'' were unhappy with the change. As the two crews were performing different functions the bomb loads had to be swapped. They took off at 19:51.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=273\u2013274}}.</ref>\n\nWhen they arrived at the target, the marking of the red area went badly wrong owing to a series of mishaps. The three markers could not identify the marking point and one aircraft had engine problems. Gibson attempted to mark it himself but his Target Indicators (TIs) did not release. As the illumination from the flares was fading, he called for more flares and warned the red section of the main force not to bomb. He then commanded them to stand by, so they started to turn away from the target. This was potentially dangerous and exposed them to further risk from flak and night fighters. Some started to bomb the green area, either out of confusion or nervousness. He then authorised the remaining aircraft to bomb the green area. The red area was eventually marked, but it was too late to direct any of the main force's aircraft to attack it. The raid concluded at 21:58. He remained calm despite the confusion. The time of Gibson's departure from the target is unknown. It is possible that he loitered in a wide, high orbit to assess the outcome and left around 22:00. One crew from No. 61 Squadron claimed they heard him say he had a damaged engine.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=276\u2013281}}.</ref>\n\nGibson's aircraft crashed at [[Steenbergen]] in the Netherlands at around 22:30. Witnesses heard an aircraft flying low, saw that its cockpit was illuminated and then it crashed.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=281}}.</ref> At first, Gibson's failure to return to Woodhall Spa was not considered out of the ordinary, as it was assumed he had landed at Coningsby. Likewise at Coningsby there was no immediate concern as there was fog and it was assumed he would have landed elsewhere. However, it soon became apparent he had not returned. The rumour spread rapidly around No. 5 Group that he was missing.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=282\u2013283}}.</ref> He was not posted officially as missing until 29 November,<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=286}}</ref> although Prime Minister Winston Churchill was informed on 26 September: \"The Air Ministry have told us that Wing Commander Gibson, V.C. is reported missing from a recent raid in which he flew a Mosquito to Munchen Gladbach\".{{sfn|''churchillarchive''|1944}}\n\n===Funeral===\nAt Steenbergen, the Germans cordoned off the crash site at the Graaf Hendrikpolder. Human remains were recovered which confirmed there had been one person in the plane and therefore initially it was suspected the other member may have bailed out. However, with the discovery of a third hand, the presence of a second person was confirmed. Jim Warwick was identified from his identity tag. The laundry tag in a sock identified the other person as a \"Guy Gibson\". The remains were placed in a small specially constructed coffin.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=284\u2013285}}.</ref>\n\nThe local deputy mayor, Mr. Herbers, wanted to give the men a proper funeral. They hired a horse-drawn hearse from nearby Halsteren.  The coffin was draped with the flag of the Netherlands and was laid to rest in the Roman Catholic cemetery. The funeral was attended by the Roman Catholic priest, Father Verhoeven and the Protestant Pastor van den Brink. As they did not know the men's religion they performed the funeral between them. Father Verhoeven read the psalm, ''De Profundis'' and Pastor van den Brink spoke the Lord's Prayer in English.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=285\u2013286}}.</ref> A cross was erected over the grave with Warwick's full rank and name with the name \"Guy Gibson\" underneath. When it was later confirmed who \"Guy Gibson\" was, a new cross was constructed with Gibson's rank, name and decorations.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=164}}.</ref>\n\n===Analysis and theories of the crash===\nThe exact cause of Gibson's crash is unknown and is likely to remain so. A number of theories exist, with some more likely than others. Various contributory factors may also have led to the loss of his Mosquito.<ref name=\"Morris 1994 289\">{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=289}}.</ref> One theory advanced is that the accident was due to Gibson's lack of experience flying Mosquitos. His log book, which he had last updated on 16 September, detailed 9 hours and 35 minutes flying Mosquitos. It was observed it took him three attempts to land at [[Scatsta Airport|Scatsta]]. He had been on one training flight on 31 August to learn how to dive bomb and Mosquito crews knew they had to practise regularly, particularly in pulling out of dives. Also, he had not rehearsed the emergency procedures to exit a Mosquito \u2013 as it could take 30 seconds even on the ground.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=294\u2013295}}.</ref>\n\nThe same lack of experience flying the Mosquito applied to his navigator, Squadron Leader Warwick, who had never flown in one operationally. That a letter was found with Warwick's address ([[RAF Coningsby]]) on it suggests Warwick's inclusion on the flight was a very late decision. He was experienced and would have known not to take anything like an addressed letter with him under normal circumstances.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=284}}.</ref>\n\nHarris wrote that Gibson appointed himself as the controller. It is possible he seized this opportunity in Air Commodore Sharpe's absence when the late change in target was announced.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=296}}.</ref> There were some instances of Mosquitos breaking up because of their wooden frames. Harris considered this as a possibility, however, it is unlikely.<ref name=\"Morris 1994 289\"/> Lack of fuel is the explanation most favoured by members of No. 627 Squadron at the time. In December 1985 the site was excavated and wreckage from the plane recovered. No enemy damage was noticeable. It has therefore been suggested that Gibson and Warwick had failed to switch fuel tanks at the correct time.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=306}}.</ref> It has also been suggested there was a fault with the fuel tank selector.{{sfn|''RAF''|2012}} Further, it is possible that a lack of familiarity with the Mosquito resulted in neither Gibson nor Warwick being able to find the switches to swap the fuel supply. This would also be a reason to explain why the cockpit was illuminated: they were attempting to locate the switches. In either case, the result would be that the aircraft simply ran out of fuel.\n\nIf Gibson left Rheydt at 22:00 then it is estimated he was about 70 miles short of the expected location if the aircraft had been operating normally. Therefore, it is possible the aircraft was flying underpowered at the time of the crash. This would suggest some sort of damage to the aircraft.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=302}}.</ref>\n\nSpeculation persists{{according to whom|date=August 2017}} that Gibson's Mosquito may have been shot down by German jet fighter ace [[Kurt Welter]]. On the night of the raid, 19 September 1944, Welter was the only German pilot to have claimed a Mosquito shot down that night and Gibson's Mosquito the only Mosquito lost.<ref name=\"Hinchliffe 1998, p. 294\">Hinchliffe 1998, p. 294.</ref> However, a listing of ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' claims transcribed from the original microfilms shows that Welter's claim was on the night of 18/19 September, and was north of [[Wittenberg]], in the area southwest of [[Berlin]], more than 500&nbsp;km from Steenbergen.{{sfn|Guest|Goyat|2003|p=?}} Welter claimed his Mosquito at 23.05 hours near [[G\u00fctersloh]], and recent research indicates that it was actually an intruder Mosquito FB.VI PZ177 of No. 23 Squadron. The crew, Flying Officer K. Eastwood and navigator Flight Lieutenant G.G. Rogers, were both killed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aircrewremembered.com/raf1944/3/eastwoodkenneth.html |title=Aircrew Remembered's Allied Forces Archive Reports |publisher=Aircrewremembered.com |accessdate=24 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151224110144/http://www.aircrewremembered.com/raf1944/3/eastwoodkenneth.html |archivedate=24 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2011, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' published an article asserting that the cause of Gibson's death may have been a [[friendly fire]] incident. Rear gunner Sergeant Bernard McCormack flew on the raid. Before he died in 1992, he left a taped confession with his wife that he had seen what he thought was a [[Junkers Ju 88|Ju 88]] flying near his plane and had fired 600 rounds at it when in the vicinity of Steenbergen. He saw the plane go down. During the debriefing after the raid he explained what had happened and was asked again about the incident by an Intelligence Officer the following day. McCormack came to believe the plane shot down belonged to Gibson.{{sfn|Satherly|2011}}\n\nIt is possible that Gibson was not where others might have expected him to be. During the briefing for the raid, he was advised to use an exit route that would put him over France. However, he disagreed and insisted he would return by the shortest route at low level.<ref name=\"Morris 1994 273\"/>\n\n===Posthumous tributes===\nGibson's death was formally announced on 8 January 1945. However, many knew of his loss before this date.{{sfn|Morris|1994|p=311}}\n\nOn 19 December 1944 Churchill wrote to Eve Gibson:\n\n{{quote|I had great admiration for him \u2013 the glorious Dam-buster. I had hoped that he would come into Parliament and make his way there after the stress of the war was over, but he never spared himself nor would allow others to spare him. We have lost in this officer one of the most splendid of all our fighting men. His name will not be forgotten; it will for ever be enshrined in the most wonderful records of our country.{{sfn|Morris|1994|p=311}} }}\n\nIn his introduction to ''Enemy Coast Ahead'', Sir Arthur Harris described Gibson as:\n\n{{quote|As great a warrior as this island ever bred.{{sfn|Gibson|2005|p=9}}}}\n\nBarnes Wallis said of Gibson:\n\n{{quote|For some men of great courage and adventure, inactivity was a slow death. Would a man like Gibson ever have adjusted back to peacetime life? One can imagine it would have been a somewhat empty existence after all he had been through. Facing death had become his drug. He had seen countless friends and comrades perish in the great crusade. Perhaps something in him even welcomed the inevitability he had always felt that before the war ended he would join them in their Bomber Command Valhalla. He had pushed his luck beyond all limits and he knew it. But that was the kind of man he was\u2026a man of great courage, inspiration and leadership. A man born for war\u2026but born to fall in war.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p= ~216}} }}\n\n==Personal life==\nGibson met Eve Moore, a show dancer and [[actress]], in December 1939 when she was performing in the revue ''Come Out To Play'' at the New Hippodrome Theatre, [[Coventry]]. He later claimed that they met at a party. She claimed he saw the revue three nights in succession before introducing himself to her on the fourth and accompanying her to a cast party.\n\nShe was born Evelyn Mary Moore in [[Penarth]], [[Wales]] on 27 December 1911, which made her seven years older than Gibson.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=43\u201344}}.</ref> He became infatuated with her and travelled to meet her during his leave whenever he could as the revue progressed around the country. He also found opportunities to pursue her while on duty. He volunteered to fly Hampdens to [[MOD St Athan|RAF St Athan]], only twelve miles from [[Cardiff]] and conveniently close to Penarth.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=44}}.</ref> He managed to arrange a stopover in [[Glasgow]] when travelling to [[Lossiemouth]].<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=50\u201351}}.</ref>\n\nGibson proposed to Eve in October 1940 and she accepted.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|pp=72\u201372}}.</ref> On 21 November he flew down to Cardiff in a Blenheim. They were married in Penarth's Anglican Church on 23 November.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=81}}.</ref> Gibson's Aunt Gwennie and Uncle John attended, but reports that Gibson's father attended his wedding with his new wife are regarded as untrue.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=62}}.</ref>\n\nEve returned with him to [[Lincolnshire]]. They lodged in a bed-sit room in the Lion and Royal pub in [[Navenby]]. She was on her own most of the time and quickly became very unhappy.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=62}}.</ref> When No. 29 Squadron moved to West Malling, they moved into a cottage, Clare Cottage. She joined in the station's social life taking part in revues and musicals. She could also travel more easily to London from Kent.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=94}}.</ref> When Gibson was posted to Cranfield she decided to return to Penarth. In summer 1942 she found a job in London and moved there, where she shared a flat with a girlfriend.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=97}}.</ref> They both had casual relationships outside their marriage.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=67}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=115}}.</ref> They last met in August 1944 around Gibson's birthday, and he seems to have been ready to discuss a divorce, although she seemed to want to try again when the war had finished.<ref>{{harvnb|Ottaway|2009|p=154}}.</ref>\n\nAfter Gibson's death, Eve moved to South Africa in 1948 to marry Jack Hyman, a South African businessman. They divorced and she returned to Britain in 1954. She reverted to the surname Gibson, so many people did not realise she had remarried. She died on 3 November 1988, the same day as [[Harold Brownlow Martin|Harold Martin]].<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=317}}.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, during research for his book, Richard Morris interviewed Margaret Masters, who formed a close relationship with Gibson during late 1942\u201344.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=333}}.</ref> As Margaret North, she was a member of the medical team called out on 8 December 1942 from [[RAF Rauceby]] to [[RAF Syerston]] to attend to Group Captain Walker. She was a WAAF corporal and a theatre nurse in the Crash and Burn Unit. When Gibson returned to Rauceby the following day to visit Walker, she and Gibson started talking and he asked her out.

(39438), Reserve of Air Force Officers, No. 617 Squadron: \u2014\n\nThis officer served as a night bomber pilot at the beginning of the war and quickly established a reputation as an outstanding operational pilot. In addition to taking the fullest possible share in all normal operations, he made single-handed attacks during his \"rest\" nights on such highly defended objectives as the German battleship ''Tirpitz'', then completing in Wilhelmshaven.\n\nWhen his tour of operational duty was concluded, he asked for a further operational posting and went to a night-fighter unit instead of being posted for instructional duties. In the course of his second operational tour, he destroyed at least three enemy bombers and contributed much to the raising and development of new night-fighter formations.\n\nAfter a short period in a training unit, he again volunteered for operational duties and returned to night bombers. Both as an operational pilot and as leader of his squadron, he achieved outstandingly successful results and his personal courage knew no bounds. Berlin, Cologne, Danzig, Gdynia, Genoa, Le Creusot, Milan, Nuremberg and Stuttgart were among the targets he attacked by day and by night.\n\nOn the conclusion of his third operational tour, Wing Commander Gibson pressed strongly to be allowed to remain on operations and he was selected to command a squadron then forming for special tasks. Under his inspiring leadership, this squadron has now executed one of the most devastating attacks of the war\u2014the breaching of the Moehne and Eder dams.\n\nThe task was fraught with danger and difficulty. Wing Commander Gibson personally made the initial attack on the Moehne dam. Descending to within a few feet of the water and taking the full brunt of the antiaircraft defences, he delivered his attack with great accuracy. Afterwards he circled very low for 30 minutes, drawing the enemy fire on himself in order to leave as free a run as possible to the following aircraft which were attacking the dam in turn.\n\nWing Commander Gibson then led the remainder of his force to the Eder dam where, with complete disregard for his own safety, he repeated his tactics and once more drew on himself the enemy fire so that the attack could be successfully developed.\n\nWing Commander Gibson has completed over 170 sorties, involving more than 600 hours operational flying. Throughout his operational career, prolonged exceptionally at his own request, he has shown leadership, determination and valour of the highest order.{{sfn|Gazette|36030|p=2361}}\n|-\n| [[File:US Legion of Merit Commander ribbon.png| 80px]]\n| [[Legion of Merit|Commander of the Legion of Merit]]\n| (United States) 1943{{sfn|Gazette|36271|p=5284}}\n| The KING has granted unrestricted permission for the wearing of the undermentioned decorations, conferred upon the officers indicated, in recognition of valuable services rendered in connection with the war: \u2014\n\nCONFERRED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\n\nLegion of Merit (Commander).\n\nWing Commander Guy Penrose GIBSON, V.C., D.S.O., D.F.C.

In the recent attack at Le Creusot, Wing-Commander Gibson bombed and machine-gunned the transformer station nearby from five hundred feet. On 22 October 1942, he participated in the attack on Genoa and, two days later, he led his squadron in a daylight sortie against Milan. On both occasions, Wing-Commander Gibson flew with great distinction. He is a most skilful and courageous leader whose keenness has set a most inspiring example.{{sfn|Gazette|35791|p=5031}}\n|-\n| bar 1943{{sfn|Gazette|35963|p=1518}}\n| ''Bar to the Distinguished Service Order''\nActing Wg-Cdr G.P.

He has always displayed the greatest keenness and, within the past two months, has taken part in six attacks against well-defended targets, including Berlin. In March 1943, he captained an aircraft detailed to attack Stuttgart. On the outward flight engine trouble developed but he flew on to his objective and bombed it from a low level. This is typical of his outstanding determination to make every sortie a success. By his skilful leadership and contempt for danger, he has set an example which has inspired the squadron he commands.{{sfn|Gazette|35963|p=1518}}\n|-\n| rowspan=2 | [[File:UK DFC w bar BAR.svg| 80px]]\n| rowspan=2 | [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar]] (DFC & Bar)\n| 1940{{sfn|Gazette|34892|p=4177}}\n| ''Distinguished Flying Cross''\nFg Off.

In 1960, its name was changed to Auburn University to acknowledge the varied academic programs and larger curriculum of a major university.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Auburn University}}\n[[File:1883 Old Main Building South College Street Auburn Alabama.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|\"Old Main\", the first building on Auburn's campus, was destroyed by fire in 1887]]\n\nThe Alabama Legislature chartered the institution as the East Alabama Male College on February 1, 1856, coming under the guidance of the [[Methodist Church]] in 1859.<ref>Anson West, ''History of Methodism in Alabama'' (Nashville: Methodist Episcopal Church South, 1893), 738\u2013739.</ref> Its first president was Reverend [[William J. Sasnett]], and the school opened its doors in 1859 to a student body of eighty and a faculty of ten.\n\nAuburn's early history is inextricably linked with the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]-era [[Southern United States#Reconstruction and Jim Crow|South]]. Classes were held in \"Old Main\" until the college was closed due to the war, when most of the students and faculty left to enlist. The campus was a training ground for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Army, and \"Old Main\" served as a hospital for Confederate wounded.\n\nTo commemorate Auburn's contribution to the Civil War, a cannon lathe used for the manufacture of cannons for the Confederate Army and recovered from [[Selma, Alabama]], was presented to the college in 1952 by brothers of Delta Chapter of the [[Alpha Phi Omega]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/codelemur/5108012123/in/set-72157625100858387|title= The Cannon Lathe plaque|access-date= January 17, 2011}}</ref> It sits today on the lawn next to [[Samford Hall]].\n\n===Post-Civil War===\nThe school reopened in 1866 after the end of the Civil War, its only closure. In 1872, control of the institution was transferred from the Methodist Church to the State of [[Alabama]] for financial reasons. Alabama placed the school under the provisions of the [[Morrill Act]] as a [[Land-grant colleges|land-grant institution]], the first in the South to be established separately from the state university.{{clarify|What does this sentence's last passage mean?|date=March 2017}} This act provided for 240,000 acres (971&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}) of Federal land to be sold to provide funds for an agricultural and mechanical school. As a result, in 1872 the school was renamed the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama.\n\nUnder the act's provisions, land-grant institutions were also supposed to teach military tactics and train officers for the United States military. In the late 19th century, most students at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama were enrolled in the cadet program, learning military tactics and training to become officers. Each county in the state was allowed to nominate two cadets to attend the college free of charge.\n\n[[File:1890s Samford Hall Auburn Alabama.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Samford Hall]] in the 1890s]]\nThe university's original curriculum focused on engineering and agriculture. This trend changed under the guidance of [[William Leroy Broun]], who taught classics and sciences and believed both disciplines were important for the growth of the university and the individual. In 1892, two historic events occurred: women were admitted to the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama, and football was played as a school sport. Eventually, football replaced polo as the main sport on campus. The college was renamed the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (API) in 1899, largely because of Broun's influence.<ref name=\"Auburn history\"/>\n\n[[File:Auburn cadets.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|API [[Cadet]]s drill on Ross Square in 1918]]\nOn October 1, 1918, nearly all of Alabama Polytechnic Institute's able-bodied male students 18 or older voluntarily joined the [[United States Army]] for short-lived military careers on campus. The student-soldiers numbered 878, according to API president Charles Thach, and formed the academic section of the Student Army Training Corps. The vocational section was composed of enlisted men sent to Auburn for training in radio and mechanics. The students received honorable discharges two months later following the Armistice that ended [[World War I]]. API struggled through the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], having scrapped an extensive expansion program by then-President [[Bradford Knapp]]. Faculty salaries were cut drastically, and enrollment decreased along with state appropriations to the college. By the end of the 1930s, Auburn had essentially recovered, but then faced new conditions caused by [[World War II]].\n\nAs war approached in 1940, there was a great shortage of engineers and scientists needed for the defense industries. The [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Office of Education]] asked all American engineering schools to join in a \"crash\" program to produce what was often called \"instant engineers.\" API became an early participant in an activity that eventually became [[Engineering, Science, and Management War Training]] (ESMWT). Fully funded by the government and coordinated by Auburn's Dean of Engineering, college-level courses were given in concentrated, mainly evening classes at sites across Alabama. Taken by thousands of adults \u2013 including many women \u2013 these courses were highly beneficial in filling the wartime ranks of civilian engineers, chemists, and other technical professionals. The ESMWT also benefited API by providing employment for faculty members when the student body was significantly diminished by [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]] and volunteer enlistment.\n\nDuring the war, API also trained U.S. military personnel on campus; between 1941 and 1945, Auburn produced over 32,000 troops for the war effort. Following the end of World War II, API, like many colleges around the country, experienced a period of massive growth caused by returning military personnel taking advantage of their [[GI Bill]] offer of free education. In the five-year period following the end of the war, enrollment at API more than doubled.\n\n===Name change to Auburn===\n[[File:AuburnTigers.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Current Auburn Athletics logo]]\n\nRecognizing the school had moved beyond its agricultural and mechanical roots, it was granted university status by the Alabama Legislature in 1960 and renamed Auburn University, a name that better expressed the varied academic programs and expanded curriculum that the school had been offering for years. However, it was popularly called \"Auburn\" for many years before the official name change.\n\n===Civil Rights era to present===\nAuburn University was [[racial segregation|racially segregated]] prior to 1963, with only white students being admitted. Integration began in 1964 with the admittance of the first African-American student, Harold A.

In addition, Auburn's graduate Landscape Architecture program was ranked No. 13 nationally and Industrial Design program 4th.\n\nThe undergraduate Interior Design program in the College of Human Sciences is ranked No. 1 nationally by DesignIntelligence magazine.{{when|date=September 2019}} For its annual survey, \"America's Best Architecture & Design Schools,\" the publication asked 277 leading architecture and design firms which schools best prepare students for success in the profession. Based on Interior Design programs accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA), Auburn was ranked No. 1 in the nation, along with Savannah College of Art and Design.{{when|date=September 2019}}\n\nAuburn's College of Architecture pioneered the nation's first interior architecture degree program; its dual degree Architecture & Interior Architecture degree was the first in the nation. Its College of Architecture, Design, and Construction pioneered the nation's first Design Build master's degree program, capitalizing on the College's Building Science program with Auburn's \"Rural Studio\" program where Architectural students build highly creative and ingenious homes for some of the poorest regions of Alabama. These homes and efforts have been publicized by People Magazine, Time, featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show, numerous Architectural and Construction periodicals as well. Of special mention is the School's [[Rural Studio]] program, founded by the late [[Samuel Mockbee]].\n\nThe Samuel Ginn College of Engineering has a 134-year tradition of engineering education, consistently ranking in the nation's largest 20 engineering programs in terms of numbers of engineers graduating annually. The college has a combined enrollment of close to 4,000. Auburn's College of Engineering offers majors in civil, mechanical, electrical, industrial and systems engineering, polymer and fiber engineering, aerospace, agricultural, bio-systems, materials, chemical engineering, computer science, and software engineering, and\u2014more recently\u2014began a program in [[wireless engineering]] after receiving a donation from alumnus [[Samuel L. Ginn]]. In 2001, Ginn, a noted U.S. pioneer in wireless communication, made a $25 million gift to the college and announced plans to spearhead an additional $150 million in support. This gave Auburn the first Bachelor of Wireless Engineering degree program in the United States. Auburn University was the first university in the Southeast to offer the bachelor of software engineering degree and the master of software engineering degree.\n\n[[File:Ross Chemistry Laboratory on the Auburn University campus, Alabama LCCN2010639196.tif|alt=|left|thumb|307x307px|Ross Hall, home to Auburn's Department of Chemical Engineering]]\nAuburn has historically placed much of its emphasis on the education of engineers at the undergraduate level, and in recent years has been ranked as high as the 10th largest undergraduate engineering program in the U.S. in terms of the number of undergraduate degrees awarded on annual basis. The Ginn College of Engineering is now focused on expanding the graduate programs, and was recently ranked 60th nationally university with doctoral programs in engineering by ''U.S. News & World Report''. Last year, the college ranked 67th among all engineering programs.\n\nAuburn's Economics Department (formerly in the College of Business, now in the College of Liberal Arts) was ranked 123rd in the world in 1999 by the ''Journal of Applied Econometrics''. Auburn was rated ahead of such international powerhouses as INSEAD in France (141st) and the London Business School (146th). Auburn's MBA Program in the College of Business has annually been ranked by ''U.S. News & World Report magazine'' in the top ten percent of the nation's more than 750 MBA Programs. The [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] (LvMI) offices were once located in the business department of Auburn University, and the LvMI continues to work with the university on many levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/about/3467#part |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher= Mises Institute|website=Mises.org |date= |access-date=December 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\nROTC programs are available in three branches of service: Air Force, Army, and Navy/Marine Corps with the latter being the only one in Alabama. Over 100 officers that attended Auburn have reached flag rank (general or admiral), including one, [[Carl Epting Mundy Jr.]], who served as [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps]]. Auburn is one of only seven universities in the Nuclear Enlisted Commissioning Program, and has historically been one of the top ROTC producers of Navy nuclear submarine officers.\n\nIn addition to the ROTC graduates commissioned through Auburn, two master's degree alumni from Auburn, four-star generals [[Hugh Shelton]] and [[Richard Myers]], served as [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in the last decade. Both officers received their commissions elsewhere, and attended Auburn for an M.S. (Shelton) and M.B.A. (Myers).\n\nAuburn has graduated six astronauts (including [[Ken Mattingly|T.K. Mattingly]] of [[Apollo 13]] fame) and one current and one former director of the [[Kennedy Space Center]]. 1972 Auburn Mechanical Engineering graduate Jim Kennedy, currently director of NASA's Kennedy Space Center, was previously deputy director of [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC). Several hundred Auburn graduates, primarily engineers and scientists, currently work directly for NASA or NASA contractors. Hundreds of Auburn engineers worked for NASA at MSFC during the peak years of the \"space race\" in the 1960s, when the Saturn and Apollo moon programs were in full development.\n\n<div style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+'''Fall Freshman Statistics'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possass.aspx|title=Office of Institutional Research and Assessment|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602042446/https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possass.aspx|archive-date=June 2, 2015|url-status=dead}}<br />* {{cite web|url=https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possasa.aspx|title=Office of Institutional Research and Assessment|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601224549/https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possasa.aspx|archive-date=June 1, 2015|url-status=dead}}<br />* {{cite web|url=https://oira.auburn.edu/dictionary/cdsdefinitions.aspx|title=Office of Institutional Research and Assessment|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601224840/https://oira.auburn.edu/dictionary/cdsdefinitions.aspx|archive-date=June 1, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|-\n! &nbsp;\n!2015<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2015/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref>\n!2014<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2014/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref>!! 2013<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2013/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2012<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2012/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2011<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2011/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2010<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2010/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2009<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2009/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2008<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2008/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Hargis]]\n\nThe Auburn campus is primarily arranged in a grid-like pattern with several distinct building groups. The northern section of the central campus (bounded by Magnolia Ave. and Thach Ave.) contains most of the College of Engineering buildings, the Lowder business building, and the older administration buildings. The middle section of the central campus (bounded by Thach Ave. and Roosevelt Dr.) contains the College of Liberal Arts (except fine arts) and the College of Education, mostly within Haley Center. The southern section of the central campus (bounded by Roosevelt Dr. and Samford Ave.) contains the most of the buildings related to the College of Science and Mathematics, as well as fine arts buildings.\n\nSeveral erratic building spurts, beginning in the 1950s, have resulted in some exceptions to the subject clusters as described above. Growing interaction issues between pedestrians and vehicles led to the closure of a significant portion of Thach Avenue to vehicular traffic in 2004. A similarly sized portion of Roosevelt Drive was also closed to vehicles in 2005. In an effort to make a more appealing walkway, these two sections have been converted from asphalt to concrete. The general movement towards a pedestrian only campus is ongoing, but is often limited by the requirements for emergency and maintenance vehicular access.\n\n[[File:Cater Hall Auburn University.JPG|alt=|left|thumb|255x255px|Katharine Cooper Cater Hall]]\nThe current period of ongoing construction began around the year 2000. All recently constructed buildings have used a more traditional architectural style that is similar to the style of Samford Hall, Mary Martin Hall, and the Quad dorms. The Science Center complex was completed in 2005. This complex contains chemistry labs, traditional classrooms, and a large lecture hall. A new medical clinic opened behind the Hill dorm area. Taking the place of the old medical clinic and a few other older buildings, is the Shelby Center for Engineering Technology. Phase I of the Shelby Center opened in the Spring of 2008, with regular classes being held starting with the Summer 2008 term. A new Student Center opened in 2008.<ref>Auburn University Campus Map \u2013 http://oitapps.auburn.edu/campusmap/ click on each building for more information.<br />* Buildings at auburn University {{cite web|url=http://www.lib.auburn.edu/architecture/buildings/ |title=Explore the history of Auburn University's Campus |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415174847/http://www.lib.auburn.edu/architecture/buildings/ |archivedate=April 15, 2008 |access-date=August 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Student life==\n{| style=\"text-align:center; float:right; margin-left:1em; margin:auto;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ ''Ethnic composition of student body \u2013 Fall 2016'<ref>{{cite web |title=Race/Ethnicitiy Enrollment by College/School FALL 2016 |url=https://web.auburn.edu/ir/factbook/enrollment/psbe/eebcs3.aspx |publisher=Auburn University |date=October 19, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Even into the 1970s, boarding houses were still available in the community. It wasn't until the [[Great Depression]] that Auburn began to construct the first buildings on campus that were residence halls in the modern sense. As the university gradually shifted away from agricultural and military instruction to more of an academic institution, more and more dorms began to replace the barracks and boarding houses.\n\nIn the 1980s, the City of Auburn began to experience rapid growth in the number of apartment complexes constructed. Most Auburn students today live off-campus in the apartment complexes and condos, which surround the immediate area around the university. Only 19 percent of all undergraduate students at Auburn live on campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=1608&profileId=8 |title=College Search |publisher=Auburn University \u2013 Housing & Campus Life |date= |access-date=December 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAuburn's on-campus student housing consists of five complexes located at various locations over campus \u2013 The Quad, The Hill, The Village, Cambridge, and South Donahue.\n* The Quad is the oldest of the five housing complexes, dating to the Great Depression projects begun by the [[Works Progress Administration]] and located in Central Campus. Comprising ten buildings split into the Upper and Lower Quads, the Quad houses undergraduate students. Eight of the buildings are coed by floor, the remaining two are female-only. The Upper Quad comprises four Honors College dorms.\n* The Hill consists of 12 buildings and is located in South Campus. The Hill houses mostly undergraduates. There are two high-rise, 6-story dormitories (Boyd and Sasnett), and all dorms are coed (but have gender-separated floors) with the exception of Leischuck and Hall M, which are female only. All of the Hill dormitories were previously used to house sororities until 2009. The sororities are now housed in the newer Village complex.\n* The Village was constructed in 2009 and includes eight 4-story buildings to accommodate 1,700 residents. This complex houses undergraduates and sororities.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theplainsman.com/front/board_approves_tuition_increase_new_residence_halls |title=Board approves tuition increase, new residence halls |work=The Auburn Plainsman |access-date=April 29, 2007}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n*Cambridge was bought by Auburn University and converted from a hotel to a residence hall in 2010.

These are luxury suites consisting of two bedrooms with a shared common area. Each bedroom has a double-sized bed, and each suite comes fit with a mounted flat-screen TV and its own washer and dryer units.\n\n===Greek life===\nAuburn has an above-average size Greek system.  Greek associated students make up about 21% of undergraduate men and 43% of undergraduate women at Auburn.<ref>https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/auburn-university-1009/student-life</ref> \n\nAuburn's Greek system was behind most of the nation's public college Greek systems with integration, the first African-American student to be initiated into a historically white sorority happened in 2001.<ref name=wcdb>{{cite web|last1=Belanger|first1=Evan|title=How racially diverse is Auburn's Greek system?

In 2018, an African-American student became the first [[person of color]] president of a historically white Greek organization on campus.<ref>https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/04/auburns-first-african-american-sorority-president-shares-her-panhellenic-experience</ref>\n\nInterfraternity Council fraternities at Auburn are roughly divided into two separate areas: \"Old Row\" and \"New Row\". \"Old Row\" traditionally was made up of the fraternities whose houses were located along Magnolia Avenue on the north side of campus. \"New Row\" is made up of fraternities whose houses were located along Lem Morrison Drive southwest of campus. However, being an \"Old Row\" or \"New Row\" fraternity does not really depend on where the house is located but on the age of the fraternity. Therefore, there are some \"Old Row\" fraternities with houses on \"New Row\" Lem Morrison Drive because they moved there. Today's \"Old Row\" on and around Magnolia Avenue was once the \"New Row\", as the first generation of fraternity houses at Auburn were on or near College Street. Most of these houses were demolished by the end of the 1970s, and only the [[Phi Gamma Delta]] and [[Chi Phi]] fraternities remain. Some fraternity houses are not located on either \"New Row\" or \"Old Row\".  Only Auburn's historically white fraternities have traditional Greek mansions and houses.<ref>https://www.al.com/living/2016/06/auburn_frats.html</ref>\n\nInterfraternity Council fraternities: [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Alpha Gamma Rho]], [[Alpha Psi]], [[Alpha Sigma Phi]], [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Beta Theta Pi]], [[Beta Upsilon Chi]], [[Chi Phi]], [[Delta Chi]], [[Delta Tau Delta]], [[Farmhouse]], [[Kappa Alpha Order]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Phi Delta Theta]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], [[Phi Kappa Psi]], [[Phi Kappa Tau]], [[Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Pi Kappa Phi]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Sigma Nu]], [[Sigma Pi]], [[Sigma Tau Gamma]], [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]], and [[Theta Chi]]\n\nThere are eighteen Panhellenic Council sororities represented at Auburn University.  The Auburn Panhellenic community donates roughly $500,000 and over 60,000 hours to various philanthropies every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al.com/living/2016/07/auburn_sororities_through_the.html|title=12 facts you might not know about Auburn sororities|first=Amber|last=Sutton|date=July 28, 2016|website=al.com}}</ref>  [[Sorority Recruitment|Sorority recruitment]] is a week-long process held by the Panhellenic Council in August of every year.  Each Panhellenic Council sorority at Auburn has over 200 members. Panhellenic Council sororities are not based in individual mansions and houses like Auburn's historically white fraternities, but in The Village on campus in Magnolia Hall, Oak Hall, and Willow Hall.  Each of the three buildings house six sororities.  Each sorority has an individual \"chapter\" room on the first floor for meetings and a \"hall\" where members can live located above on the second, third, or fourth floor of the same building.  Usually the sorority's officers and members of the sophomore class live on the \"hall\".  \n\n[[Panhellenic Council]] sororities: [[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Alpha Delta Pi]], [[Alpha Gamma Delta]], [[Alpha Omicron Pi]], [[Alpha Xi Delta]], [[Chi Omega]], [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Delta Gamma]], [[Delta Zeta]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], [[Kappa Delta]], [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Phi Mu]], [[Sigma Kappa]], [[Sigma Sigma Sigma]], and [[Zeta Tau Alpha]]\n\nAlthough a few of Auburn's [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC)]] organizations are inactive, all nine  have been established on campus:\n[[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], [[Omega Psi Phi]], [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Phi Beta Sigma]], [[Zeta Phi Beta]], [[Sigma Gamma Rho]], and [[Iota Phi Theta]].  In 2019, Auburn's Board of Trustees approved the building of a $250K NPHC Legacy Plaza on campus with the intentions of improving recruitment, representation and retention of black students at Auburn which have been on a decline since its all-time high in 2007.<ref>https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/10/auburn-university-given-failing-grade-for-racial-equity</ref>  When the plaza is complete in 2022, Auburn will be the second SEC school to have a NPHC Legacy Plaza.  None of Auburn's NPHC organizations have traditional Greek mansions and houses so the plaza will be the first architectural indication of NPHC's presence on campus.<ref>https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2019/10/auburn-to-be-second-sec-school-with-nphc-legacy-plaza</ref>\n\nAuburn's Multicultural Greek Council is composed of [[Kappa Delta Chi]] and [[Omega Delta Phi]].  Both were established on campus in 2016 and have no architectural presence at Auburn.\n\n==Athletics==\n[[File:Aubie-01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aubie]], the Auburn University Tiger Mascot]]\n{{Main|Auburn Tigers}}\n\nAuburn University's sports teams are known as the '''Tigers''', and they participate in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-A]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and in the Western Division of the 14-member [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). [[War Eagle]] is the battle cry and greeting used by the Auburn Family (students, alumni, and fans). Auburn has won a total of 21 intercollegiate national championships (including 17 NCAA Championships), which includes 2 [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|football]] (1957, 2010), 8 [[NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving Championships|men's swimming and diving]] (1997, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009), 5 [[NCAA Women's Swimming and Diving Championships|women's swimming and diving]] (2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007), 5 [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] (2008, 2011,2013, 2016, 2018), and 1 [[NCAA Women's Outdoor Track and Field Championship|women's outdoor track and field]] (2006) titles. Auburn has also won a total of 70 [[Southeastern Conference]] championships, including 51 men's titles and 19 women's titles. Auburn's colors of orange and blue were chosen by [[George Petrie (American football)|Dr. George Petrie]], Auburn's first football coach, based on those of his alma mater, the [[University of Virginia]].\n\n===Football===\n[[File:1913 Auburn football team Champions of South.jpg|alt=|thumb|474x474px|[[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn Tigers]] undefeated 1913 team]]\n{{Main|Auburn Tigers football}} <!-- Editors, please consider adding new content to the main article, [[Auburn Tigers football]] instead. -->\n\nAuburn named [[Gus Malzahn]] as the new football head coach on December 4, 2012. Other past coaches include [[Gene Chizik]], [[George Petrie (American football)|George Petrie]], [[John Heisman]], [[Mike Donahue]], [[Jack Meagher]], [[Ralph Jordan|Ralph \"Shug\" Jordan]], [[Pat Dye]], [[Terry Bowden]] and [[Tommy Tuberville]].\n\nAuburn played its first game in 1892 against the [[Georgia Bulldogs football|University of Georgia]] at [[Piedmont Park]] in [[Atlanta]] starting what is currently the oldest college football rivalry in the [[Deep South]]. Auburn's first perfect season came in [[1913 Auburn Tigers football team|1913]], when the Tigers went 8\u20130, claiming a second SIAA conference championship and the first national championship in school history. The Tigers' first bowl appearance was in 1937 in the sixth [[Bacardi Bowl]] played in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. AU football has won twelve SEC Conference Championships, and since the division of the conference in 1992, eight western division championships and six trips to the SEC Championship game. Auburn plays arch-rival [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] each year in a game known as the [[Iron Bowl]].\n\nIn [[1957 Auburn Tigers football team|1957]], Auburn was coached by \"Shug\" Jordan to a 10\u20130 record and was awarded the AP National Championship. Ohio State University was first in the UPI coaches' poll. Auburn was ineligible for a bowl game, however, having been placed on probation by the Southeastern Conference.\n\nThree Auburn players, [[Pat Sullivan (American football)|Pat Sullivan]] in 1971, [[Bo Jackson]] in 1985, and [[Cam Newton]] in 2010 have won the [[Heisman Trophy]]. The Trophy's namesake, [[John Heisman]], coached at Auburn from 1895 until 1899. Auburn is the only school where Heisman coached (among others, [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] and [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]]) that has produced multiple Heisman Trophy winners. Auburn's [[Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium]] has a capacity of 87,451 ranking as the ninth-largest on-campus stadium in the NCAA {{as of|2006|September|lc=y}}.\n\n[[File:Jordan hare stadium.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium]], 2005]]\nAuburn went 11\u20130 under Terry Bowden in 1993, but was on probation and not allowed to play in the SEC Championship game. Auburn completed the 2004 football season with a 13\u20130 record winning the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] championship, the school's first conference title since 1989 and the first outright title since 1987. The 2004 team was led by quarterback [[Jason Campbell]], running backs [[Carnell Williams]] and [[Ronnie Brown]], and cornerback [[Carlos Rogers (American football)|Carlos Rogers]], all subsequently drafted in the first round of the [[2005 NFL Draft]]. The team's new offensive coordinator, [[Al Borges]], led the team to use the [[west coast offense|west coast style offense]] which maximized the use of both star running backs. However, the Tigers were ranked behind two other undefeated teams, [[2004 USC Trojans football team|Southern California]] and [[2004 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], that played in the [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] championship game.\n\nPrior to the 2008 season, Tony Franklin was hired as offensive coordinator to put Auburn into the spread offense. He was fired, however, following the sixth game of the season that ended in a loss to Vanderbilt. Tommy Tuberville then resigned as head coach after the season. On December 13, 2008, it was reported that [[Gene Chizik]] had been hired as Auburn's new head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=496642 |title=Auburn hires Gene Chizik as football coach |access-date=December 13, 2008 |date=December 13, 2008 |publisher=Sporting News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216160910/http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=496642 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Coach Gene Chizik then hired [[Gus Malzahn]] as the Tigers' new Offensive Coordinator.\n\n[[File:Rolling Toomers Corner Auburn University.jpg|thumb|left|The Auburn tradition of rolling Toomer's Corner after a sports win]]\nIn [[2010 Auburn Tigers football team|2010]], Auburn defeated [[2010 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon]] 22\u201319 in the [[2011 BCS National Championship Game]] to secure the school's second national championship. The Tigers finished the season with a 14\u20130 record, including comeback wins over [[2010 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]], [[2010 South Carolina Gamecocks football team|South Carolina]], [[2010 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]], and [[2010 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]. The Tigers trailed the Tide 24\u20130 in Tuscaloosa, but managed a 28\u201327 comeback victory in the 75th edition of the [[Iron Bowl]]. Auburn would again defeat South Carolina 56\u201317 in the [[2010 SEC Championship Game]], claiming the school's eleventh conference championship. The Tigers were led by head coach Gene Chizik, offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn, quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner [[Cam Newton]], and defensive tackle and Lombardi Award winner [[Nick Fairley]]. In Malzahn's first season as head coach (2013), Auburn had two miraculous finishes in the final minute against Georgia and Alabama to win the SEC West. They went on to win the 2013 SEC Championship Game over Missouri and fell short in the [[2014 BCS National Championship Game]] to the [[Florida State Seminoles]] 34\u201331 in [[Pasadena, California]]. <!-- Keep this a summary.

The Auburn Equestrian team most recently captured the 2016 national championship.\n\n==Traditions==\n{{Main|Auburn University traditions}}\nAuburn University has many traditions including a creed, an alma mater, a fight song, a battle cry, a mascot and several notable game-day traditions including an eagle flying over the football field.\n\n===Colors===\nThe official colors are: <ref name=\"AU Official Colors\">{{cite web |url=http://www.auburn.edu/template/colors.html|title=Auburn University Official Colors |access-date=March 5, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"ocm.auburn.edu\"/>\n* Burnt Orange {{color box|#DD550C}}, [[RGB color model|RGB]] (221,85,12) (#DD550C), [[Pantone|PMS]] (158) \n* Navy Blue {{color box|#03244D}}, [[RGB color model|RGB]] (3,36,77) (#03244D), [[Pantone|PMS]] (289)\n\n===Fight song===\nAuburn University's [[fight song]], \"War Eagle\", was written in 1954 and 1955 by [[Robert Allen (song composer)|Robert Allen]] and [[Al Stillman]]. It was introduced at the beginning of the [[1955 Auburn Tigers football team|1955 football season]] and served as the official fight song ever since.\n\n===Hey Day===\nIn the 1950s and 60s Auburn designated a day on campus called \"Hey Day\" that encouraged students to interact with each other and simply say \"hey.\" Auburn reinstated this tradition in 1985 and has continued to evolve until this day. On Hey Days now, students are asked to put on name tags, handed out by student body leaders, and encouraged to say \"hey\" to whomever may pass them by during the day.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.auburntigers.com/trads/01_auburn_tradition.html|title=Official Athletics Site of the Auburn Tigers \u2013 Traditions|publisher=AuburnTigers.com|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503170727/http://www.auburntigers.com/trads/01_auburn_tradition.html|archive-date=May 3, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Auburn's Eagles===\nAuburn has currently two eagles in their flight program for educational initiatives. One of these educational programs is known as the pregame flight program where the eagle handlers set an eagle free before Auburn takes the field at Jordan Hare Stadium. The eagle then proceeds to fly around the stadium and eventually land in the middle of the field.\n\nTiger, also known as War Eagle VI, was born in 1980 in captivity and given to Auburn University in 1986. Tiger's first flight before an Auburn Football game came against Wyoming in 2000. She retired after the Georgia game in 2006. Throughout Tiger's career, she flew many different flights and at many different venues including the 2002 Winter Olympics. Tiger died at the age of 34 in 2014.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\nAuburn's first Flight program eagle is Nova, War Eagle VII. His first flight came before Auburn's game against Kentucky in 2004. He was born at the Montgomery zoo and given to Auburn a year later.\n\nSpirit is the only Bald Eagle Auburn has used for its pregame flight program. His first flight was in 2000. Spirit was found as a baby with an injured beak and nursed back to health before being given to Auburn for further rehabilitation in 1998. Unfortunately, Spirit's beak was damaged to the point that it is impossible for his release back into the wild.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\n===Aubie the Tiger===\nAuburn's mascot, [[Aubie]] the tiger, has been around since 1959. He made his first appearance that year on the October 3 gameday football program versus [[Hardin\u2013Simmons Cowboys football|Hardin-Simmons College]]. Aubie was the creation of ''[[Birmingham Post-Herald]]'' artist Phil Neel and was the focal point of Auburn's football programs for 18 years. Auburn Football experienced good luck while Aubie remained on the cover, ending with a 23\u20132\u20131 home record and 63\u201316\u20132 overall record while he was on the program cover. Aubie the tiger is still currently Auburn's official mascot and has won the most National Mascot titles in the contest's history, with nine.<ref name=\"Aubie The Tiger\">{{cite web|url=http://studentaffairs.auburn.edu/2016/02/05/aubie-named-2016-mascot-national-champion/|title=Aubie Named 2016 Mascot National Champion |work= Auburn University Student Affairs}}</ref>\n\n===Auburn Football Tiger Walk===\nAuburn's Tiger Walk began in the 1960s, after fans would try to stop the players and get autographs before the games. It has since evolved into the spectacle, where fans line Donahue Drive to cheer on the team as they make their way from the athletic complex to the field. The highest point of the tiger walk came in 1989, when Auburn and Alabama played each other for the first time away from [[Legion Field]] in Birmingham. It is estimated that around 20,000 Auburn fans came out and lined the street to cheer on the team that day.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\n===War Eagle chant theories===\nDuring Auburn's game against Georgia in 1892, a civil war veteran in the stands brought his pet eagle that he found on a battleground during the war. The eagle during the game flew away from the soldier and began circling the field in the air. As all this went on, Auburn began marching down the field to eventually score the game-winning touchdown. At the end of the game, the eagle dove into the ground and subsequently died; however, the Auburn faithful took the eagle as an omen of success and coined the phrase \"WAR EAGLE\" in turn.<ref name=\"Auburn Tigers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/auburnfootball/|title=Auburn football \u2013 Auburn Tigers Football NCAA News |work=al.com|access-date=May 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring a pep rally in 1913, a cheerleader said that the team would have to fight the whole game because the game meant \"war.\" At the same time of the rally, an eagle emblem fell on a student's military hat. When asked what it was, he yelled it was a \"War Eagle\".<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\nDuring a game against the Carlisle Indian Team in 1914, Auburn attempted to single out Carlisle's toughest player, Bald Eagle. To tire him out, they began running the ball his way during every play, by saying \"bald eagle\", while in formation. The crowd mistook this and began yelling \"War Eagle\", instead, leading to Auburn's player, Lucy Hairston, to yell \"War Eagle\" at the end of the game, after he scored the game-winning touchdown.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\nAfter a battle, the Saxon warriors would yell \"War Eagle\", when the buzzards started to circle the battlefields. Some believe that Auburn coined its battle cry from this practice by the Saxons.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\n===Toomer's Corner===\nThe tradition of rolling Toomer's Corner on Auburn's campus after winning home and big away games is thought to have originated in the 1950s. The tradition is thought to have spawned from when the owner of Toomer's Drugs, Sheldon Toomer, would toss his receipt paper into the trees to signal an Auburn road victory.

In 1960, its name was changed to Auburn University to acknowledge the varied academic programs and larger curriculum of a major university.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Auburn University}}\n[[File:1883 Old Main Building South College Street Auburn Alabama.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|\"Old Main\", the first building on Auburn's campus, was destroyed by fire in 1887]]\n\nThe Alabama Legislature chartered the institution as the East Alabama Male College on February 1, 1856, coming under the guidance of the [[Methodist Church]] in 1859.<ref>Anson West, ''History of Methodism in Alabama'' (Nashville: Methodist Episcopal Church South, 1893), 738\u2013739.</ref> Its first president was Reverend [[William J. Sasnett]], and the school opened its doors in 1859 to a student body of eighty and a faculty of ten.\n\nAuburn's early history is inextricably linked with the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]-era [[Southern United States#Reconstruction and Jim Crow|South]]. Classes were held in \"Old Main\" until the college was closed due to the war, when most of the students and faculty left to enlist. The campus was a training ground for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Army, and \"Old Main\" served as a hospital for Confederate wounded.\n\nTo commemorate Auburn's contribution to the Civil War, a cannon lathe used for the manufacture of cannons for the Confederate Army and recovered from [[Selma, Alabama]], was presented to the college in 1952 by brothers of Delta Chapter of the [[Alpha Phi Omega]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/codelemur/5108012123/in/set-72157625100858387|title= The Cannon Lathe plaque|access-date= January 17, 2011}}</ref> It sits today on the lawn next to [[Samford Hall]].\n\n===Post-Civil War===\nThe school reopened in 1866 after the end of the Civil War, its only closure. In 1872, control of the institution was transferred from the Methodist Church to the State of [[Alabama]] for financial reasons. Alabama placed the school under the provisions of the [[Morrill Act]] as a [[Land-grant colleges|land-grant institution]], the first in the South to be established separately from the state university.{{clarify|What does this sentence's last passage mean?|date=March 2017}} This act provided for 240,000 acres (971&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}) of Federal land to be sold to provide funds for an agricultural and mechanical school. As a result, in 1872 the school was renamed the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama.\n\nUnder the act's provisions, land-grant institutions were also supposed to teach military tactics and train officers for the United States military. In the late 19th century, most students at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama were enrolled in the cadet program, learning military tactics and training to become officers. Each county in the state was allowed to nominate two cadets to attend the college free of charge.\n\n[[File:1890s Samford Hall Auburn Alabama.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Samford Hall]] in the 1890s]]\nThe university's original curriculum focused on engineering and agriculture. This trend changed under the guidance of [[William Leroy Broun]], who taught classics and sciences and believed both disciplines were important for the growth of the university and the individual. In 1892, two historic events occurred: women were admitted to the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama, and football was played as a school sport. Eventually, football replaced polo as the main sport on campus. The college was renamed the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (API) in 1899, largely because of Broun's influence.<ref name=\"Auburn history\"/>\n\n[[File:Auburn cadets.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|API [[Cadet]]s drill on Ross Square in 1918]]\nOn October 1, 1918, nearly all of Alabama Polytechnic Institute's able-bodied male students 18 or older voluntarily joined the [[United States Army]] for short-lived military careers on campus. The student-soldiers numbered 878, according to API president Charles Thach, and formed the academic section of the Student Army Training Corps. The vocational section was composed of enlisted men sent to Auburn for training in radio and mechanics. The students received honorable discharges two months later following the Armistice that ended [[World War I]]. API struggled through the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], having scrapped an extensive expansion program by then-President [[Bradford Knapp]]. Faculty salaries were cut drastically, and enrollment decreased along with state appropriations to the college. By the end of the 1930s, Auburn had essentially recovered, but then faced new conditions caused by [[World War II]].\n\nAs war approached in 1940, there was a great shortage of engineers and scientists needed for the defense industries. The [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Office of Education]] asked all American engineering schools to join in a \"crash\" program to produce what was often called \"instant engineers.\" API became an early participant in an activity that eventually became [[Engineering, Science, and Management War Training]] (ESMWT). Fully funded by the government and coordinated by Auburn's Dean of Engineering, college-level courses were given in concentrated, mainly evening classes at sites across Alabama. Taken by thousands of adults \u2013 including many women \u2013 these courses were highly beneficial in filling the wartime ranks of civilian engineers, chemists, and other technical professionals. The ESMWT also benefited API by providing employment for faculty members when the student body was significantly diminished by [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]] and volunteer enlistment.\n\nDuring the war, API also trained U.S. military personnel on campus; between 1941 and 1945, Auburn produced over 32,000 troops for the war effort. Following the end of World War II, API, like many colleges around the country, experienced a period of massive growth caused by returning military personnel taking advantage of their [[GI Bill]] offer of free education. In the five-year period following the end of the war, enrollment at API more than doubled.\n\n===Name change to Auburn===\n[[File:AuburnTigers.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Current Auburn Athletics logo]]\n\nRecognizing the school had moved beyond its agricultural and mechanical roots, it was granted university status by the Alabama Legislature in 1960 and renamed Auburn University, a name that better expressed the varied academic programs and expanded curriculum that the school had been offering for years. However, it was popularly called \"Auburn\" for many years before the official name change.\n\n===Civil Rights era to present===\nAuburn University was [[racial segregation|racially segregated]] prior to 1963, with only white students being admitted.

Based on Interior Design programs accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA), Auburn was ranked No. 1 in the nation, along with Savannah College of Art and Design.{{when|date=September 2019}}\n\nAuburn's College of Architecture pioneered the nation's first interior architecture degree program; its dual degree Architecture & Interior Architecture degree was the first in the nation. Its College of Architecture, Design, and Construction pioneered the nation's first Design Build master's degree program, capitalizing on the College's Building Science program with Auburn's \"Rural Studio\" program where Architectural students build highly creative and ingenious homes for some of the poorest regions of Alabama. These homes and efforts have been publicized by People Magazine, Time, featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show, numerous Architectural and Construction periodicals as well. Of special mention is the School's [[Rural Studio]] program, founded by the late [[Samuel Mockbee]].\n\nThe Samuel Ginn College of Engineering has a 134-year tradition of engineering education, consistently ranking in the nation's largest 20 engineering programs in terms of numbers of engineers graduating annually. The college has a combined enrollment of close to 4,000. Auburn's College of Engineering offers majors in civil, mechanical, electrical, industrial and systems engineering, polymer and fiber engineering, aerospace, agricultural, bio-systems, materials, chemical engineering, computer science, and software engineering, and\u2014more recently\u2014began a program in [[wireless engineering]] after receiving a donation from alumnus [[Samuel L. Ginn]]. In 2001, Ginn, a noted U.S. pioneer in wireless communication, made a $25 million gift to the college and announced plans to spearhead an additional $150 million in support. This gave Auburn the first Bachelor of Wireless Engineering degree program in the United States. Auburn University was the first university in the Southeast to offer the bachelor of software engineering degree and the master of software engineering degree.\n\n[[File:Ross Chemistry Laboratory on the Auburn University campus, Alabama LCCN2010639196.tif|alt=|left|thumb|307x307px|Ross Hall, home to Auburn's Department of Chemical Engineering]]\nAuburn has historically placed much of its emphasis on the education of engineers at the undergraduate level, and in recent years has been ranked as high as the 10th largest undergraduate engineering program in the U.S. in terms of the number of undergraduate degrees awarded on annual basis. The Ginn College of Engineering is now focused on expanding the graduate programs, and was recently ranked 60th nationally university with doctoral programs in engineering by ''U.S. News & World Report''. Last year, the college ranked 67th among all engineering programs.\n\nAuburn's Economics Department (formerly in the College of Business, now in the College of Liberal Arts) was ranked 123rd in the world in 1999 by the ''Journal of Applied Econometrics''. Auburn was rated ahead of such international powerhouses as INSEAD in France (141st) and the London Business School (146th). Auburn's MBA Program in the College of Business has annually been ranked by ''U.S. News & World Report magazine'' in the top ten percent of the nation's more than 750 MBA Programs. The [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] (LvMI) offices were once located in the business department of Auburn University, and the LvMI continues to work with the university on many levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/about/3467#part |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher= Mises Institute|website=Mises.org |date= |access-date=December 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\nROTC programs are available in three branches of service: Air Force, Army, and Navy/Marine Corps with the latter being the only one in Alabama. Over 100 officers that attended Auburn have reached flag rank (general or admiral), including one, [[Carl Epting Mundy Jr.]], who served as [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps]]. Auburn is one of only seven universities in the Nuclear Enlisted Commissioning Program, and has historically been one of the top ROTC producers of Navy nuclear submarine officers.\n\nIn addition to the ROTC graduates commissioned through Auburn, two master's degree alumni from Auburn, four-star generals [[Hugh Shelton]] and [[Richard Myers]], served as [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in the last decade. Both officers received their commissions elsewhere, and attended Auburn for an M.S. (Shelton) and M.B.A. (Myers).\n\nAuburn has graduated six astronauts (including [[Ken Mattingly|T.K. Mattingly]] of [[Apollo 13]] fame) and one current and one former director of the [[Kennedy Space Center]]. 1972 Auburn Mechanical Engineering graduate Jim Kennedy, currently director of NASA's Kennedy Space Center, was previously deputy director of [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC). Several hundred Auburn graduates, primarily engineers and scientists, currently work directly for NASA or NASA contractors. Hundreds of Auburn engineers worked for NASA at MSFC during the peak years of the \"space race\" in the 1960s, when the Saturn and Apollo moon programs were in full development.\n\n<div style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+'''Fall Freshman Statistics'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possass.aspx|title=Office of Institutional Research and Assessment|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602042446/https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possass.aspx|archive-date=June 2, 2015|url-status=dead}}<br />* {{cite web|url=https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possasa.aspx|title=Office of Institutional Research and Assessment|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601224549/https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possasa.aspx|archive-date=June 1, 2015|url-status=dead}}<br />* {{cite web|url=https://oira.auburn.edu/dictionary/cdsdefinitions.aspx|title=Office of Institutional Research and Assessment|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601224840/https://oira.auburn.edu/dictionary/cdsdefinitions.aspx|archive-date=June 1, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|-\n! &nbsp;\n!2015<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2015/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref>\n!2014<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2014/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref>!! 2013<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2013/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2012<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2012/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2011<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2011/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2010<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2010/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2009<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2009/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2008<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2008/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Hargis]]\n\nThe Auburn campus is primarily arranged in a grid-like pattern with several distinct building groups. The northern section of the central campus (bounded by Magnolia Ave. and Thach Ave.) contains most of the College of Engineering buildings, the Lowder business building, and the older administration buildings. The middle section of the central campus (bounded by Thach Ave. and Roosevelt Dr.) contains the College of Liberal Arts (except fine arts) and the College of Education, mostly within Haley Center. The southern section of the central campus (bounded by Roosevelt Dr. and Samford Ave.) contains the most of the buildings related to the College of Science and Mathematics, as well as fine arts buildings.\n\nSeveral erratic building spurts, beginning in the 1950s, have resulted in some exceptions to the subject clusters as described above. Growing interaction issues between pedestrians and vehicles led to the closure of a significant portion of Thach Avenue to vehicular traffic in 2004. A similarly sized portion of Roosevelt Drive was also closed to vehicles in 2005. In an effort to make a more appealing walkway, these two sections have been converted from asphalt to concrete. The general movement towards a pedestrian only campus is ongoing, but is often limited by the requirements for emergency and maintenance vehicular access.\n\n[[File:Cater Hall Auburn University.JPG|alt=|left|thumb|255x255px|Katharine Cooper Cater Hall]]\nThe current period of ongoing construction began around the year 2000. All recently constructed buildings have used a more traditional architectural style that is similar to the style of Samford Hall, Mary Martin Hall, and the Quad dorms. The Science Center complex was completed in 2005. This complex contains chemistry labs, traditional classrooms, and a large lecture hall. A new medical clinic opened behind the Hill dorm area. Taking the place of the old medical clinic and a few other older buildings, is the Shelby Center for Engineering Technology. Phase I of the Shelby Center opened in the Spring of 2008, with regular classes being held starting with the Summer 2008 term.

Even into the 1970s, boarding houses were still available in the community. It wasn't until the [[Great Depression]] that Auburn began to construct the first buildings on campus that were residence halls in the modern sense. As the university gradually shifted away from agricultural and military instruction to more of an academic institution, more and more dorms began to replace the barracks and boarding houses.\n\nIn the 1980s, the City of Auburn began to experience rapid growth in the number of apartment complexes constructed. Most Auburn students today live off-campus in the apartment complexes and condos, which surround the immediate area around the university. Only 19 percent of all undergraduate students at Auburn live on campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=1608&profileId=8 |title=College Search |publisher=Auburn University \u2013 Housing & Campus Life |date= |access-date=December 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAuburn's on-campus student housing consists of five complexes located at various locations over campus \u2013 The Quad, The Hill, The Village, Cambridge, and South Donahue.\n* The Quad is the oldest of the five housing complexes, dating to the Great Depression projects begun by the [[Works Progress Administration]] and located in Central Campus. Comprising ten buildings split into the Upper and Lower Quads, the Quad houses undergraduate students. Eight of the buildings are coed by floor, the remaining two are female-only. The Upper Quad comprises four Honors College dorms.\n* The Hill consists of 12 buildings and is located in South Campus. The Hill houses mostly undergraduates. There are two high-rise, 6-story dormitories (Boyd and Sasnett), and all dorms are coed (but have gender-separated floors) with the exception of Leischuck and Hall M, which are female only. All of the Hill dormitories were previously used to house sororities until 2009. The sororities are now housed in the newer Village complex.\n* The Village was constructed in 2009 and includes eight 4-story buildings to accommodate 1,700 residents. This complex houses undergraduates and sororities.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theplainsman.com/front/board_approves_tuition_increase_new_residence_halls |title=Board approves tuition increase, new residence halls |work=The Auburn Plainsman |access-date=April 29, 2007}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n*Cambridge was bought by Auburn University and converted from a hotel to a residence hall in 2010. It is a five story building accommodating 300 students.\n* South Donahue opened in 2013 and is a single residence hall located on the corner of South Donahue and West Samford, right next to the baseball stadium. These are luxury suites consisting of two bedrooms with a shared common area. Each bedroom has a double-sized bed, and each suite comes fit with a mounted flat-screen TV and its own washer and dryer units.\n\n===Greek life===\nAuburn has an above-average size Greek system.  Greek associated students make up about 21% of undergraduate men and 43% of undergraduate women at Auburn.<ref>https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/auburn-university-1009/student-life</ref> \n\nAuburn's Greek system was behind most of the nation's public college Greek systems with integration, the first African-American student to be initiated into a historically white sorority happened in 2001.<ref name=wcdb>{{cite web|last1=Belanger|first1=Evan|title=How racially diverse is Auburn's Greek system?

In 2018, an African-American student became the first [[person of color]] president of a historically white Greek organization on campus.<ref>https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/04/auburns-first-african-american-sorority-president-shares-her-panhellenic-experience</ref>\n\nInterfraternity Council fraternities at Auburn are roughly divided into two separate areas: \"Old Row\" and \"New Row\". \"Old Row\" traditionally was made up of the fraternities whose houses were located along Magnolia Avenue on the north side of campus. \"New Row\" is made up of fraternities whose houses were located along Lem Morrison Drive southwest of campus. However, being an \"Old Row\" or \"New Row\" fraternity does not really depend on where the house is located but on the age of the fraternity. Therefore, there are some \"Old Row\" fraternities with houses on \"New Row\" Lem Morrison Drive because they moved there. Today's \"Old Row\" on and around Magnolia Avenue was once the \"New Row\", as the first generation of fraternity houses at Auburn were on or near College Street. Most of these houses were demolished by the end of the 1970s, and only the [[Phi Gamma Delta]] and [[Chi Phi]] fraternities remain. Some fraternity houses are not located on either \"New Row\" or \"Old Row\".  Only Auburn's historically white fraternities have traditional Greek mansions and houses.<ref>https://www.al.com/living/2016/06/auburn_frats.html</ref>\n\nInterfraternity Council fraternities: [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Alpha Gamma Rho]], [[Alpha Psi]], [[Alpha Sigma Phi]], [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Beta Theta Pi]], [[Beta Upsilon Chi]], [[Chi Phi]], [[Delta Chi]], [[Delta Tau Delta]], [[Farmhouse]], [[Kappa Alpha Order]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Phi Delta Theta]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], [[Phi Kappa Psi]], [[Phi Kappa Tau]], [[Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Pi Kappa Phi]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Sigma Nu]], [[Sigma Pi]], [[Sigma Tau Gamma]], [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]], and [[Theta Chi]]\n\nThere are eighteen Panhellenic Council sororities represented at Auburn University.  The Auburn Panhellenic community donates roughly $500,000 and over 60,000 hours to various philanthropies every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al.com/living/2016/07/auburn_sororities_through_the.html|title=12 facts you might not know about Auburn sororities|first=Amber|last=Sutton|date=July 28, 2016|website=al.com}}</ref>  [[Sorority Recruitment|Sorority recruitment]] is a week-long process held by the Panhellenic Council in August of every year.  Each Panhellenic Council sorority at Auburn has over 200 members. Panhellenic Council sororities are not based in individual mansions and houses like Auburn's historically white fraternities, but in The Village on campus in Magnolia Hall, Oak Hall, and Willow Hall.  Each of the three buildings house six sororities.  Each sorority has an individual \"chapter\" room on the first floor for meetings and a \"hall\" where members can live located above on the second, third, or fourth floor of the same building.  Usually the sorority's officers and members of the sophomore class live on the \"hall\".  \n\n[[Panhellenic Council]] sororities: [[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Alpha Delta Pi]], [[Alpha Gamma Delta]], [[Alpha Omicron Pi]], [[Alpha Xi Delta]], [[Chi Omega]], [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Delta Gamma]], [[Delta Zeta]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], [[Kappa Delta]], [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Phi Mu]], [[Sigma Kappa]], [[Sigma Sigma Sigma]], and [[Zeta Tau Alpha]]\n\nAlthough a few of Auburn's [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC)]] organizations are inactive, all nine  have been established on campus:\n[[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], [[Omega Psi Phi]], [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Phi Beta Sigma]], [[Zeta Phi Beta]], [[Sigma Gamma Rho]], and [[Iota Phi Theta]].  In 2019, Auburn's Board of Trustees approved the building of a $250K NPHC Legacy Plaza on campus with the intentions of improving recruitment, representation and retention of black students at Auburn which have been on a decline since its all-time high in 2007.<ref>https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/10/auburn-university-given-failing-grade-for-racial-equity</ref>  When the plaza is complete in 2022, Auburn will be the second SEC school to have a NPHC Legacy Plaza.  None of Auburn's NPHC organizations have traditional Greek mansions and houses so the plaza will be the first architectural indication of NPHC\u2019s presence on campus.<ref>https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2019/10/auburn-to-be-second-sec-school-with-nphc-legacy-plaza</ref>\n\nAuburn's Multicultural Greek Council is composed of [[Kappa Delta Chi]] and [[Omega Delta Phi]].  Both were established on campus in 2016 and have no architectural presence at Auburn.\n\n==Athletics==\n[[File:Aubie-01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aubie]], the Auburn University Tiger Mascot]]\n{{Main|Auburn Tigers}}\n\nAuburn University's sports teams are known as the '''Tigers''', and they participate in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-A]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and in the Western Division of the 14-member [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). [[War Eagle]] is the battle cry and greeting used by the Auburn Family (students, alumni, and fans). Auburn has won a total of 21 intercollegiate national championships (including 17 NCAA Championships), which includes 2 [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|football]] (1957, 2010), 8 [[NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving Championships|men's swimming and diving]] (1997, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009), 5 [[NCAA Women's Swimming and Diving Championships|women's swimming and diving]] (2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007), 5 [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] (2008, 2011,2013, 2016, 2018), and 1 [[NCAA Women's Outdoor Track and Field Championship|women's outdoor track and field]] (2006) titles. Auburn has also won a total of 70 [[Southeastern Conference]] championships, including 51 men's titles and 19 women's titles. Auburn's colors of orange and blue were chosen by [[George Petrie (American football)|Dr. George Petrie]], Auburn's first football coach, based on those of his alma mater, the [[University of Virginia]].\n\n===Football===\n[[File:1913 Auburn football team Champions of South.jpg|alt=|thumb|474x474px|[[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn Tigers]] undefeated 1913 team]]\n{{Main|Auburn Tigers football}} <!-- Editors, please consider adding new content to the main article, [[Auburn Tigers football]] instead. -->\n\nAuburn named [[Gus Malzahn]] as the new football head coach on December 4, 2012. Other past coaches include [[Gene Chizik]], [[George Petrie (American football)|George Petrie]], [[John Heisman]], [[Mike Donahue]], [[Jack Meagher]], [[Ralph Jordan|Ralph \"Shug\" Jordan]], [[Pat Dye]], [[Terry Bowden]] and [[Tommy Tuberville]].\n\nAuburn played its first game in 1892 against the [[Georgia Bulldogs football|University of Georgia]] at [[Piedmont Park]] in [[Atlanta]] starting what is currently the oldest college football rivalry in the [[Deep South]]. Auburn's first perfect season came in [[1913 Auburn Tigers football team|1913]], when the Tigers went 8-0, claiming a second SIAA conference championship and the first national championship in school history. The Tigers' first bowl appearance was in 1937 in the sixth [[Bacardi Bowl]] played in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. AU football has won twelve SEC Conference Championships, and since the division of the conference in 1992, eight western division championships and six trips to the SEC Championship game. Auburn plays arch-rival [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] each year in a game known as the [[Iron Bowl]].\n\nIn [[1957 Auburn Tigers football team|1957]], Auburn was coached by \"Shug\" Jordan to a 10\u20130 record and was awarded the AP National Championship. Ohio State University was first in the UPI coaches' poll. Auburn was ineligible for a bowl game, however, having been placed on probation by the Southeastern Conference.\n\nThree Auburn players, [[Pat Sullivan (American football)|Pat Sullivan]] in 1971, [[Bo Jackson]] in 1985, and [[Cam Newton]] in 2010 have won the [[Heisman Trophy]]. The Trophy's namesake, [[John Heisman]], coached at Auburn from 1895 until 1899. Auburn is the only school where Heisman coached (among others, [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] and [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]]) that has produced multiple Heisman Trophy winners. Auburn's [[Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium]] has a capacity of 87,451 ranking as the ninth-largest on-campus stadium in the NCAA {{as of|2006|September|lc=y}}.\n\n[[File:Jordan hare stadium.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium]], 2005]]\nAuburn went 11\u20130 under Terry Bowden in 1993, but was on probation and not allowed to play in the SEC Championship game. Auburn completed the 2004 football season with a 13\u20130 record winning the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] championship, the school's first conference title since 1989 and the first outright title since 1987. The 2004 team was led by quarterback [[Jason Campbell]], running backs [[Carnell Williams]] and [[Ronnie Brown]], and cornerback [[Carlos Rogers (American football)|Carlos Rogers]], all subsequently drafted in the first round of the [[2005 NFL Draft]]. The team's new offensive coordinator, [[Al Borges]], led the team to use the [[west coast offense|west coast style offense]] which maximized the use of both star running backs. However, the Tigers were ranked behind two other undefeated teams, [[2004 USC Trojans football team|Southern California]] and [[2004 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], that played in the [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] championship game.\n\nPrior to the 2008 season, Tony Franklin was hired as offensive coordinator to put Auburn into the spread offense. He was fired, however, following the sixth game of the season that ended in a loss to Vanderbilt. Tommy Tuberville then resigned as head coach after the season. On December 13, 2008, it was reported that [[Gene Chizik]] had been hired as Auburn's new head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=496642 |title=Auburn hires Gene Chizik as football coach |access-date=December 13, 2008 |date=December 13, 2008 |publisher=Sporting News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216160910/http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=496642 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Coach Gene Chizik then hired [[Gus Malzahn]] as the Tigers' new Offensive Coordinator.\n\n[[File:Rolling Toomers Corner Auburn University.jpg|thumb|left|The Auburn tradition of rolling Toomer's Corner after a sports win]]\nIn [[2010 Auburn Tigers football team|2010]], Auburn defeated [[2010 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon]] 22\u201319 in the [[2011 BCS National Championship Game]] to secure the school's second national championship. The Tigers finished the season with a 14\u20130 record, including comeback wins over [[2010 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]], [[2010 South Carolina Gamecocks football team|South Carolina]], [[2010 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]], and [[2010 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]. The Tigers trailed the Tide 24\u20130 in Tuscaloosa, but managed a 28\u201327 comeback victory in the 75th edition of the [[Iron Bowl]]. Auburn would again defeat South Carolina 56\u201317 in the [[2010 SEC Championship Game]], claiming the school's eleventh conference championship. The Tigers were led by head coach Gene Chizik, offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn, quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner [[Cam Newton]], and defensive tackle and Lombardi Award winner [[Nick Fairley]]. In Malzahn's first season as head coach (2013), Auburn had two miraculous finishes in the final minute against Georgia and Alabama to win the SEC West.

One of these educational programs is known as the pregame flight program where the eagle handlers set an eagle free before Auburn takes the field at Jordan Hare Stadium. The eagle then proceeds to fly around the stadium and eventually land in the middle of the field.\n\nTiger, also known as War Eagle VI, was born in 1980 in captivity and given to Auburn University in 1986. Tiger's first flight before an Auburn Football game came against Wyoming in 2000. She retired after the Georgia game in 2006. Throughout Tiger's career, she flew many different flights and at many different venues including the 2002 Winter Olympics. Tiger died at the age of 34 in 2014.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\nAuburn's first Flight program eagle is Nova, War Eagle VII. His first flight came before Auburn's game against Kentucky in 2004. He was born at the Montgomery zoo and given to Auburn a year later.\n\nSpirit is the only Bald Eagle Auburn has used for its pregame flight program. His first flight was in 2000. Spirit was found as a baby with an injured beak and nursed back to health before being given to Auburn for further rehabilitation in 1998. Unfortunately, Spirit's beak was damaged to the point that it is impossible for his release back into the wild.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\n===Aubie the Tiger===\nAuburn's mascot, [[Aubie]] the tiger, has been around since 1959. He made his first appearance that year on the October 3 gameday football program versus [[Hardin\u2013Simmons Cowboys football|Hardin-Simmons College]]. Aubie was the creation of ''[[Birmingham Post-Herald]]'' artist Phil Neel and was the focal point of Auburn's football programs for 18 years. Auburn Football experienced good luck while Aubie remained on the cover, ending with a 23\u20132\u20131 home record and 63\u201316\u20132 overall record while he was on the program cover. Aubie the tiger is still currently Auburn's official mascot and has won the most National Mascot titles in the contest's history, with nine.<ref name=\"Aubie The Tiger\">{{cite web|url=http://studentaffairs.auburn.edu/2016/02/05/aubie-named-2016-mascot-national-champion/|title=Aubie Named 2016 Mascot National Champion |work= Auburn University Student Affairs}}</ref>\n\n===Auburn Football Tiger Walk===\nAuburn's Tiger Walk began in the 1960s, after fans would try to stop the players and get autographs before the games. It has since evolved into the spectacle, where fans line Donahue Drive to cheer on the team as they make their way from the athletic complex to the field. The highest point of the tiger walk came in 1989, when Auburn and Alabama played each other for the first time away from [[Legion Field]] in Birmingham. It is estimated that around 20,000 Auburn fans came out and lined the street to cheer on the team that day.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\n===War Eagle chant theories===\nDuring Auburn's game against Georgia in 1892, a civil war veteran in the stands brought his pet eagle that he found on a battleground during the war. The eagle during the game flew away from the soldier and began circling the field in the air. As all this went on, Auburn began marching down the field to eventually score the game-winning touchdown. At the end of the game, the eagle dove into the ground and subsequently died; however, the Auburn faithful took the eagle as an omen of success and coined the phrase \"WAR EAGLE\" in turn.<ref name=\"Auburn Tigers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/auburnfootball/|title=Auburn football \u2013 Auburn Tigers Football NCAA News |work=al.com|access-date=May 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring a pep rally in 1913, a cheerleader said that the team would have to fight the whole game because the game meant \"war.\" At the same time of the rally, an eagle emblem fell on a student's military hat. When asked what it was, he yelled it was a \"War Eagle\".<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\nDuring a game against the Carlisle Indian Team in 1914, Auburn attempted to single out Carlisle's toughest player, Bald Eagle. To tire him out, they began running the ball his way during every play, by saying \"bald eagle\", while in formation. The crowd mistook this and began yelling \"War Eagle\", instead, leading to Auburn's player, Lucy Hairston, to yell \"War Eagle\" at the end of the game, after he scored the game-winning touchdown.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\nAfter a battle, the Saxon warriors would yell \"War Eagle\", when the buzzards started to circle the battlefields. Some believe that Auburn coined its battle cry from this practice by the Saxons.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\n===Toomer's Corner===\nThe tradition of rolling Toomer's Corner on Auburn's campus after winning home and big away games is thought to have originated in the 1950s. The tradition is thought to have spawned from when the owner of Toomer's Drugs, Sheldon Toomer, would toss his receipt paper into the trees to signal an Auburn road victory. This iconic tradition was ranked by USA Today as the \"Best Sports Tradition\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2257393-behind-the-auburn-tradition-of-rolling-toomers-corner |title=Behind the Auburn Tradition of Rolling Toomer's Corner|author=BR Studios|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=May 29, 2015}}<br />* {{cite web|url=http://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/03/rolling-of-toomers-corner-oaks-voted-best-sports-tradition|title=Rolling of Toomer's Corner Oaks voted 'Best Sports Tradition'|author=The Plainsman|work=The Plainsman |access-date=March 9, 2018}}<br />* {{cite web|url=https://www.10best.com/awards/travel/best-sports-tradition/|title=10 Best Sports Traditions|author=USA Today|work=USA Today|access-date=March 9, 2018}}</ref> In November 2010, Harvey Updike Jr. poisoned the beloved trees at Toomer's Corner using 80DF after Auburn beat rival and Updike's team of choice 28-27.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/11/harvey_updyke_poisoned_toomers.html|title=Harvey Updyke poisoned Toomer's Corner oaks 5 years ago|work=AL.com|access-date=October 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Selected organizations==\n===Media and publications===\n* ''[[The Auburn Plainsman]]'' \u2013 the university's student-run newspaper, has won 23 [[National Pacemaker Awards]] from the [[Associated Collegiate Press]] since 1966.

As a player, he first played for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] but made his name playing for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the 1930s, winning two [[Football League First Division|league titles]] and an [[FA Cup]], as well as five caps for [[England national football team|England]]. Drake is Arsenal's joint fifth highest goalscorer of all time. He also holds the record for the most goals scored in a top flight game in English football, [[Aston Villa 1\u20137 Arsenal (14 December 1935)|with seven against Aston Villa]] in December 1935. A former [[centre forward]], Drake has been described as a \"classic number 9\" and as a \"strong, powerful, brave and almost entirely unthinking\" player who \"typified the English view.\"<ref>{{cite book| first=Jonathan | last=Wilson | title=Inverting the Pyramid: The History of Football Tactics | publisher=Orion | year=2008| isbn=0752889958| page=88}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.arsenal.com/history/club-records/goalscoring-records| title=Goalscorers|website=Arsenal.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter retiring from playing football, he became a manager, and while in charge of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] he took the club to its first [[List of English football champions|league title]]. He was also a [[cricket]]er, but only ever played sparingly for [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Southampton===\nBorn in Southampton, Drake started playing at [[Winchester City F.C.|Winchester City]], whilst continuing to work as a gas-meter reader. He nearly joined [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Spurs]] as a schoolboy, but missed the trial match with an injury. In June 1931, he was persuaded by [[George Kay]] to join [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], then playing in Division Two. He made his Saints debut on 14 November 1931 at [[Swansea Town F.C.|Swansea Town]], and signed as a professional in November, becoming first-choice centre-forward by the end of the 1931\u201332 season.<ref name=Bio /><ref name=AFC /><ref name=Bio1 /><ref name=Bio2 />\n\nIn the following season he made 33 league appearances, scoring 20 goals. After only one full season, his bravery and skill attracted the attention of Arsenal's [[Herbert Chapman]], who tried to persuade Drake to move to north London. Drake rejected the chance of a move to [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] and decided to remain at [[The Dell (Southampton F.C.)|The Dell]]. He started the [[1933\u201334 in English football|1933\u201334 season]] by scoring a hat-trick in the opening game against [[Bradford City F.C.|Bradford City]], following this with at least one goal in the next four games, thereby amassing eight goals in the opening five games. By early March he had blasted his way to the top of the [[Football League Division Two]] goal-scoring table with 22 goals.<ref name=Bio /><ref name=Bio1 /><ref name=Bio2 /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/southampton-v-bradford-city-26-august-1933-100900/|title=Southampton v Bradford City, 26 August 1933|website=11v11.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/port-vale-v-southampton-02-september-1933-100920/|title=Port Vale v Southampton, 02 September 1933|website=11v11.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/oldham-athletic-v-southampton-28-august-1933-100904/|title=Oldham Athletic v Southampton, 28 August 1933|website=11v11.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/southampton-v-oldham-athletic-04-september-1933-100927/|title=Southampton v Oldham Athletic, 04 September 1933|website=11v11.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/southampton-v-notts-county-09-september-1933-100941/|title=Southampton v Notts County, 09 September 1933|website=11v11.com}}</ref>\n\nArsenal, with [[George Allison]] now in charge, renewed their interest and Drake eventually decided to join the Gunners. Saints had declined several previous offers, but eventually were forced to sell to balance their books. Drake made a total of 74 appearances for Southampton, scoring 48 goals.<ref name=Bio /><ref name=AFC /><ref name=Bio1 /><ref name=Bio2 />\n\n===Arsenal===\nDrake moved to Arsenal in March 1934 for \u00a36,500, and scored on his league debut against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] on 24 March 1934, in a 3\u20132 win. Although he joined too late to qualify for a [[Football League First Division|League Championship]] medal in [[1933\u201334 in English football|1933\u201334]], Drake would win one in [[1934\u201335 in English football|1934\u201335]], scoring 42 goals in 41 league games in the process \u2013 this included three [[hat-trick]]s and four four-goal hauls. With two more goals in the [[FA Cup]] and [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]], Drake scored 44 in all that season, breaking [[Jack Lambert (footballer, born 1902)|Jack Lambert]]'s club record, one that still holds to this day.<ref name=Bio /><ref name=AFC /><ref name=Bio1 /><ref name=Bio2 />\n\nThe following season, [[1935\u201336 in English football|1935\u201336]] Drake scored seven in a single match against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at [[Villa Park]] on 14 December 1935, a club record and top flight record that also still stands. Drake claimed an eighth goal hit the crossbar and went over the line, but the [[referee (association football)|referee]] waved away his appeal. Drake would go on to win the [[FA Cup]] in [[1935\u201336 in English football|1935\u201336]] with him scoring the only goal in the [[1936 FA Cup Final|final]] and the League title again in [[1937\u201338 in English football|1937\u201338]] with Arsenal.<ref name=Bio /><ref name=AFC /><ref name=Bio1 /><ref name=Bio2 />\n\nDespite being injured regularly (he was a doubt up until the last minute for the 1936 Cup Final), Drake's speed, fierce shooting and brave playing style meant he was Arsenal's first-choice centre forward for the rest of the decade, and he was the club's top scorer for each of the five seasons from 1934\u201335 to [[1938\u201339 in English football|1938\u201339]]. The [[Second World War]] curtailed Drake's career, although he served in the [[Royal Air Force]] as well as turning out for Arsenal in wartime games and also appearing as a guest player for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] later in World War II.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hogg|first=Tony|title=West Ham Who's Who|year=1995|publisher=Independent UK Sports publications|location=London|isbn=1-899429-01-8|pages=223}}</ref> However, Drake's career would not last long into peacetime; a [[vertebral column|spinal]] injury incurred in a game against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in 1945 forced him to retire from playing.

As one of seven Arsenal players in the side, he scored the third goal in a heated 3\u20132 win. With England Drake also went on to win the [[1935 British Home Championship|1935]] [[British Home Championship]] title.

He led the club to the runners-up spot in [[Division Three South]] in 1948\u201349 and again in [[1951\u201352 in English football|1951\u201352]], though at the time only the champions were promoted.\n\n===Chelsea===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\nWithout much ado he was appointed manager of First Division [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in June 1952. This is so due to the rivalry between the Gunners and the Blues being non existent at the time. Upon Drake's arrival at Chelsea, he made a series of sweeping changes, doing much to rid the club of its previous amateurish, music hall image. He discarded the club's [[Chelsea F.C.#Crest|Chelsea pensioner crest]] and with it the Pensioners nickname, and insisted a new one be adopted. From these changes came the Lion Rampant Regardant crest and the Blues nickname. He introduced scouting reports and a new, tougher, training regime based on ballwork, a rare practice in English football at the time. The club's previous policy of signing unreliable big-name players was abandoned; Drake instead used his knowledge of the lower divisions and the amateur game to recruit little-known, but more reliable players.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/02/03/chelsea-vs-arsenal-modern-rivalry/amp/|title=Chelsea vs Arsenal: a very modern rivalry|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref name=Bio1>{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/ARSENALdrake.htm|title=Ted Drake|website=Spartacus Educational.com}}</ref><ref name=Bio>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldsoccertalk.com/2009/09/28/legends-of-english-football-10-ted-drake/amp/|title=Legends Of English Football: #10 Ted Drake|website=World Soccer Talk.com}}</ref> These included [[John McNichol]], [[Frank Blunstone]], [[Derek Saunders]], [[Jim Lewis (footballer, born 1927)|Jim Lewis]] and [[Peter Sillett]]\n\nWithin three years, in the [[1954\u201355 in English football|1954\u201355]] season, Drake had led Chelsea to their first league championship triumph. In doing so, he became the first person to win the league title both as player and manager. However, Drake never came close to repeating the success. The championship-winning side was gradually broken up, to be replaced by the crop of youngsters emerging from the club's youth team, such as [[Jimmy Greaves]], [[Peter Brabrook]] and [[Bobby Tambling]], for whom Drake was an aloof figure.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Thereafter performances and results were very erratic, leaving the club stranded in mid-table; an [[FA Cup]] loss to [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] side [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] weakened his position at the club and a few months later, Drake was sacked early into the [[1961\u201362 in English football|1961\u201362]] season.\n\nAfter leaving Chelsea, he became reserve team manager at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].

As a player, he first played for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] but made his name playing for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the 1930s, winning two [[Football League First Division|league titles]] and an [[FA Cup]], as well as five caps for [[England national football team|England]]. Drake is Arsenal's joint fifth highest goalscorer of all time. He also holds the record for the most goals scored in a top flight game in English football, [[Aston Villa 1\u20137 Arsenal (14 December 1935)|with seven against Aston Villa]] in December 1935. A former [[centre forward]], Drake has been described as a \"classic number 9\" and as a \"strong, powerful, brave and almost entirely unthinking\" player who \"typified the English view.\"<ref>{{cite book| first=Jonathan | last=Wilson | title=Inverting the Pyramid: The History of Football Tactics | publisher=Orion | year=2008| isbn=0752889958| page=88}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.arsenal.com/history/club-records/goalscoring-records| title=Goalscorers|website=Arsenal.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter retiring from playing football, he became a manager, and while in charge of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] he took the club to its first [[List of English football champions|league title]]. He was also a [[cricket]]er, but only ever played sparingly for [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Southampton===\nBorn in Southampton, Drake started playing at [[Winchester City F.C.|Winchester City]], whilst continuing to work as a gas-meter reader. He nearly joined [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Spurs]] as a schoolboy, but missed the trial match with an injury. In June 1931, he was persuaded by [[George Kay]] to join [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], then playing in Division Two. He made his Saints debut on 14 November 1931 at [[Swansea Town F.C.|Swansea Town]], and signed as a professional in November, becoming first-choice centre-forward by the end of the 1931\u201332 season.<ref name=Bio /><ref name=AFC /><ref name=Bio1 /><ref name=Bio2 />\n\nIn the following season he made 33 league appearances, scoring 20 goals. After only one full season, his bravery and skill attracted the attention of Arsenal's [[Herbert Chapman]], who tried to persuade Drake to move to north London. Drake rejected the chance of a move to [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] and decided to remain at [[The Dell (Southampton F.C.)|The Dell]]. He started the [[1933\u201334 in English football|1933\u201334 season]] by scoring a hat-trick in the opening game against [[Bradford City F.C.|Bradford City]], following this with at least one goal in the next four games, thereby amassing eight goals in the opening five games. By early March he had blasted his way to the top of the [[Football League Division Two]] goal-scoring table with 22 goals.<ref name=Bio /><ref name=Bio1 /><ref name=Bio2 /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/southampton-v-bradford-city-26-august-1933-100900/|title=Southampton v Bradford City, 26 August 1933|website=11v11.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/port-vale-v-southampton-02-september-1933-100920/|title=Port Vale v Southampton, 02 September 1933|website=11v11.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/oldham-athletic-v-southampton-28-august-1933-100904/|title=Oldham Athletic v Southampton, 28 August 1933|website=11v11.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/southampton-v-oldham-athletic-04-september-1933-100927/|title=Southampton v Oldham Athletic, 04 September 1933|website=11v11.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/southampton-v-notts-county-09-september-1933-100941/|title=Southampton v Notts County, 09 September 1933|website=11v11.com}}</ref>\n\nArsenal, with [[George Allison]] now in charge, renewed their interest and Drake eventually decided to join the Gunners. Saints had declined several previous offers, but eventually were forced to sell to balance their books. Drake made a total of 74 appearances for Southampton, scoring 48 goals.<ref name=Bio /><ref name=AFC /><ref name=Bio1 /><ref name=Bio2 />\n\n===Arsenal===\nDrake moved to Arsenal in March 1934 for \u00a36,500, and scored on his league debut against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] on 24 March 1934, in a 3\u20132 win. Although he joined too late to qualify for a [[Football League First Division|League Championship]] medal in [[1933\u201334 in English football|1933\u201334]], Drake would win one in [[1934\u201335 in English football|1934\u201335]], scoring 42 goals in 41 league games in the process \u2013 this included three [[hat-trick]]s and four four-goal hauls. With two more goals in the [[FA Cup]] and [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]], Drake scored 44 in all that season, breaking [[Jack Lambert (footballer, born 1902)|Jack Lambert]]'s club record, one that still holds to this day.<ref name=Bio /><ref name=AFC /><ref name=Bio1 /><ref name=Bio2 />\n\nThe following season, [[1935\u201336 in English football|1935\u201336]] Drake scored seven in a single match against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at [[Villa Park]] on 14 December 1935, a club record and top flight record that also still stands. Drake claimed an eighth goal hit the crossbar and went over the line, but the [[referee (association football)|referee]] waved away his appeal. Drake would go on to win the [[FA Cup]] in [[1935\u201336 in English football|1935\u201336]] with him scoring the only goal in the [[1936 FA Cup Final|final]] and the League title again in [[1937\u201338 in English football|1937\u201338]] with Arsenal.<ref name=Bio /><ref name=AFC /><ref name=Bio1 /><ref name=Bio2 />\n\nDespite being injured regularly (he was a doubt up until the last minute for the 1936 Cup Final), Drake's speed, fierce shooting and brave playing style meant he was Arsenal's first-choice centre forward for the rest of the decade, and he was the club's top scorer for each of the five seasons from 1934\u201335 to [[1938\u201339 in English football|1938\u201339]]. The [[Second World War]] curtailed Drake's career, although he served in the [[Royal Air Force]] as well as turning out for Arsenal in wartime games and also appearing as a guest player for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] later in World War II.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hogg|first=Tony|title=West Ham Who's Who|year=1995|publisher=Independent UK Sports publications|location=London|isbn=1-899429-01-8|pages=223}}</ref> However, Drake's career would not last long into peacetime; a [[vertebral column|spinal]] injury incurred in a game against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in 1945 forced him to retire from playing. With 139 goals in 184 games, he is along with [[Jimmy Brain]] the joint-fifth all-time scorer for Arsenal.<ref name=AFC /><ref name=Bio /><ref name=Bio1 /><ref name=Bio2 />\n\nDrake is as well one of 32 Arsenal legends who are emblazoned in a [[mural]] upon the walls of the club's [[Emirates Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/heroes-together-no-17-ted-drake|title= Heroes Together: Ted Drake|website=Arsenal.com}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nDrake's exploits at club level brought him recognition at international level, and he made his [[England national football team|England]] debut against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the \"[[Battle of Highbury]]\" on 14 November 1934. As one of seven Arsenal players in the side, he scored the third goal in a heated 3\u20132 win. With England Drake also went on to win the [[1935 British Home Championship|1935]] [[British Home Championship]] title.

He led the club to the runners-up spot in [[Division Three South]] in 1948\u201349 and again in [[1951\u201352 in English football|1951\u201352]], though at the time only the champions were promoted.\n\n===Chelsea===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\nWithout much ado he was appointed manager of First Division [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in June 1952. This is so due to the rivalry between the Gunners and the Blues being non existent at the time. Upon Drake's arrival at Chelsea, he made a series of sweeping changes, doing much to rid the club of its previous amateurish, music hall image. He discarded the club's [[Chelsea F.C.#Crest|Chelsea pensioner crest]] and with it the Pensioners nickname, and insisted a new one be adopted. From these changes came the Lion Rampant Regardant crest and the Blues nickname. He introduced scouting reports and a new, tougher, training regime based on ballwork, a rare practice in English football at the time. The club's previous policy of signing unreliable big-name players was abandoned; Drake instead used his knowledge of the lower divisions and the amateur game to recruit little-known, but more reliable players.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/02/03/chelsea-vs-arsenal-modern-rivalry/amp/|title=Chelsea vs Arsenal: a very modern rivalry|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref name=Bio1>{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/ARSENALdrake.htm|title=Ted Drake|website=Spartacus Educational.com}}</ref><ref name=Bio>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldsoccertalk.com/2009/09/28/legends-of-english-football-10-ted-drake/amp/|title=Legends Of English Football: #10 Ted Drake|website=World Soccer Talk.com}}</ref> These included [[John McNichol]], [[Frank Blunstone]], [[Derek Saunders]], [[Jim Lewis (footballer, born 1927)|Jim Lewis]] and [[Peter Sillett]]\n\nWithin three years, in the [[1954\u201355 in English football|1954\u201355]] season, Drake had led Chelsea to their first league championship triumph. In doing so, he became the first person to win the league title both as player and manager. However, Drake never came close to repeating the success. The championship-winning side was gradually broken up, to be replaced by the crop of youngsters emerging from the club's youth team, such as [[Jimmy Greaves]], [[Peter Brabrook]] and [[Bobby Tambling]], for whom Drake was an aloof figure.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Thereafter performances and results were very erratic, leaving the club stranded in mid-table; an [[FA Cup]] loss to [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] side [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] weakened his position at the club and a few months later, Drake was sacked early into the [[1961\u201362 in English football|1961\u201362]] season.\n\nAfter leaving Chelsea, he became reserve team manager at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. During 1970 Drake went on to have a six-month stint as assistant manager under [[Vic Buckingham]] at [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. He later returned to Fulham where he became a chief scout, director and life president of the Cottagers.

When Braunstein departed in early 1969, Elektra shelved the album. In 1968, the band moved in together at their first house in the [[Thomaston, New York|Thomaston]] area of [[Great Neck, New York]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/blue-oyster-cult-s-40th-anniversary-cd-1.4147975|title=Blue Oyster Cult's 40th anniversary CD|last=October 26|first=STEVE KNOPPER Special to Newsday Updated|last2=Pm|first2=2012 2:26|website=Newsday|language=en|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n[[Eric Bloom]] was hired by the band as their [[acoustical engineering|acoustic engineer]] and eventually became lead singer, replacing Braunstein, through a series of three unlikely coincidences, one in which Lanier decided to join Bloom on a drive to an [[upstate New York|upstate]] gig where he spent the night with Bloom's old college bandmates and got to hear old tapes of Bloom's talent as lead vocalist.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR1NpyxowP4 \"Three Strokes of Fate\"], Living Legends Music interview (posted to YouTube on Nov 4, 2008) where Bloom explains three highly unlikely events that happened in which he ended up joining the band and becoming their lead singer:<br />1) Being their amp salesperson at Sam Ash,<br />2) Telling one person where he was staying in NYC and getting the soundboard job offer,<br />3) Upstate roadtrip where Lanier decided to join and got to hear Bloom's old band tapes as lead vocalist.</ref>  Because of this, Bloom was offered the job of lead singer for Soft White Underbelly. However, a bad review of a 1969 Fillmore East show caused Pearlman to change the name of the band&nbsp;\u2013 first to Oaxaca, then to the Stalk-Forrest Group. The band recorded yet another album's worth of material for Elektra, but only one single (\"What Is Quicksand?\" b/w \"Arthur Comics\") was released (and only in a promo edition of 300 copies) on [[Elektra Records]] (this album was eventually released, with additional outtakes, by Rhino Handmade Records as ''[[St. Cecilia: The Elektra Recordings]]'' in 2001). The album featured Bloom as their main lead singer, but Roeser also sang lead on a few songs, a pattern of sharing lead vocals that has continued throughout the band's career.\n\nAfter a few more temporary band names, including the Santos Sisters, the band settled on Blue \u00d6yster Cult in 1971 (see [[#Band name and logo|below]] for its origin).\n\nNew York City producer/composer and jingle writer [[David Lucas (composer)|David Lucas]] saw the band perform and took them into his Warehouse Recording Studio and produced four demos, with which Pearlman was able to get the renamed band another audition with [[Columbia Records]]. [[Clive Davis]] liked what he heard, and signed the band to the label. The first album was subsequently produced and recorded by Lucas on eight track at Lucas' studio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blueoystercult.com/Studio/SWbios.html#Lucas |title='David Lucas' in band-relations bio page|publisher=Official B\u00d6C website |date= |accessdate=2011-03-05}}</ref> Winters would leave the band and be replaced by Bouchard's brother, [[Joe Bouchard]].\n\n===Black-and-white years (1971\u20131975)===\nTheir debut album ''[[Blue \u00d6yster Cult (album)|Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]'' was released in January 1972, with a black-and-white cover designed by artist Bill Gawlik. The album featured the songs \"[[Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll]]\", \"Stairway to the Stars\" and \"Then Came the Last Days of May\". By this time, the band's sound had become more oriented toward hard rock, but songs like \"She's As Beautiful As a Foot\" and \"Redeemed\" also showed a strong element of the band's psychedelic roots. All of the band members except for Allen Lanier sang lead, a pattern that would continue on many subsequent albums, although lead singer Eric Bloom sang the majority of the songs. The album sold well, and Blue \u00d6yster Cult toured with artists such as [[the Byrds]], [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]] and [[Alice Cooper]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Perry |first=Shawn |url=http://www.vintagerock.com/ebloom_interview.aspx |title=The Eric Bloom Interview |publisher=Vintagerock.com |accessdate=2010-09-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720122423/http://www.vintagerock.com/ebloom_interview.aspx |archivedate=2007-07-20 }}</ref> During the touring process, the band's sound became heavier and more direct.\n\nTheir next album ''[[Tyranny and Mutation]]'', released in 1973, was written while the band was on tour for their first LP. It contained songs such as \"The Red and the Black\" (an ode to the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and a rewrite of \"I'm On the Lamb But I Ain't No Sheep\" from the debut album, and also a reference to [[The Red and the Black|the novel by Stendhal of the same name]]), \"Hot Rails to Hell\" and \"Baby Ice Dog\", the first of the band's many collaborations with [[Patti Smith]]. It featured a harder-rocking approach than before, though the band's songs were also growing more complex. The album outsold its predecessor, a trend that would continue with their next few albums.\n\nThe band's third album, ''[[Secret Treaties]]'' (1974)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://texasarchive.org/2010_03463|title=Blue \u00d6yster Cult Concert and Interview (1975)|last=|first=|date=|website=Texas Archive of the Moving Image|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 1, 2019}}</ref> received positive reviews, featuring songs such as \"Career of Evil\" (co-written by Patti Smith), \"Dominance and Submission\" and \"[[Astronomy (song)|Astronomy]]\". As a result of constant touring, the band was now capable of headlining arenas. The album continued the trend of growing sales, and would eventually go gold.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=blue+oyster+cult+secret+treaties#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA|work=RIAA|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAs the three albums during this formative period all had black-and-white covers, the period of their career has been dubbed the 'black and white years' by fans and critics.\n\n===Commercial success (1975\u20131981)===\nThe band's first live album ''[[On Your Feet or on Your Knees]]'' (1975) achieved greater success and went gold. Its success gave the band more time to work on a follow-up. The band members were able to purchase home recording units to record demos for their next album.\n\nTheir next studio album, ''[[Agents of Fortune]]'' (1976), was their first to go platinum and was again produced by David Lucas. It contained the hit single \"[[(Don't Fear) The Reaper]]\", which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts and has become a classic of the hard rock genre. Other major songs on the album were \"(This Ain't) The Summer of Love\", \"E.T.I. (Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence)\" and \"The Revenge of Vera Gemini\". Having recorded demos of the songs at home before recording the album, the band's songwriting process had become more individual, with none of the songs featuring the collaborative writing between the band members that had been common on their earlier albums.  Although the album still featured their trademark hard rock with sinister lyrics, the songs had become more conventional in structure, and the production was more polished.  For the first and only time, the album featured lead vocals from all five band members, with Allen Lanier singing lead on the song ''True Confessions.'' With Albert Bouchard singing lead on three songs and Joe Bouchard and Donald Roeser singing lead on one each, Eric Bloom ended up taking the lead on only four of the album's ten songs.\n\nFor the tour, the band added lasers to their light show, for which they became known. They were among the first acts to use lasers in performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blueoystercult.com/History/history6.html|publisher=Blue Oyster Cult.com|title=The History of B\u00d6C|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref>\n\nTheir next album, ''[[Spectres (album)|Spectres]]'' (1977), had the FM radio hit \"[[Godzilla (Blue \u00d6yster Cult song)|Godzilla]]\", and would become the one of the band's better-selling albums, with other well-known songs like \"I Love The Night\" and \"Goin' Through The Motions.\" However, its sales were not as strong as those for the previous album, going gold but not platinum, becoming their first album to sell less than its predecessor. It featured even more polished production, and continued the trend of the lead vocals extensively shared between members, although Allen Lanier did not sing lead. As with the previous album, Eric Bloom sang lead on fewer than half the songs.\n\nThe band then released another live album, ''[[Some Enchanted Evening (Blue \u00d6yster Cult album)|Some Enchanted Evening]]'' (1978). Though it was intended as another double-live album in the vein of ''On Your Feet or on Your Knees'', Columbia insisted that it be edited down to single-album length. It was a resounding commercial success, becoming Blue \u00d6yster Cult's most popular album and eventually selling over 2 million copies. It also revealed that while the band's studio work was becoming increasingly well-produced, they were still very much a hard rock band on stage.\n\nIt was followed by the studio album ''[[Mirrors (Blue \u00d6yster Cult album)|Mirrors]]'' (1979). For ''Mirrors'', instead of working with previous producers Sandy Pearlman (who instead went on to manage [[Black Sabbath]]) and Murray Krugman, Blue \u00d6yster Cult chose [[Tom Werman]], who had worked with acts such as [[Cheap Trick]] and [[Ted Nugent]]. It featured the band's glossiest production to date. It also gave Roeser, the lead vocalist on the band's biggest hits, bigger prominence as a vocalist, singing lead on four of the nine songs.  However, the resulting album sales were disappointing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldhistoryproject.org/1979/6/blue-oyster-cult-releases-mirrors|title=Blue \u00d6yster Cult releases Mirrors|website=World History Project}}</ref>\n\nPearlman's association with Black Sabbath led to Sabbath's ''[[Heaven and Hell (Black Sabbath album)|Heaven and Hell]]'' producer [[Martin Birch]] being hired for the next Blue \u00d6yster Cult record. The album found the band returning to their hard rock roots, and although both of the Bouchard brothers and guitarist Roeser all got lead vocal turns, Bloom would sing the majority of the tracks. The result was positive, with ''[[Cult\u00f6saurus Erectus]]'' (1980) receiving good reviews. The album went to number 12 in the United Kingdom, but did not do as well in the United States. The song \"[[Black Blade (song)|Black Blade]]\", which was written by Bloom with lyrics by science fiction and fantasy author [[Michael Moorcock]], is a kind of retelling of Moorcock's epic [[Elric of Melnibon\u00e9]] saga. The band also did a co-headlining tour with Black Sabbath in support of the album, calling the tour \"[[Black and Blue (video)|Black and Blue]]\".\n\nBirch produced the band's next album as well, ''[[Fire of Unknown Origin]]'' (1981). The biggest hit on this album was the Top 40 hit \"[[Burnin' for You]]\", a song Roeser had written with a [[Richard Meltzer]] lyric. He had intended to use it on his solo album, ''[[Flat Out (Buck Dharma album)|Flat Out]]'' (1982), but he was convinced to use it on the Blue \u00d6yster Cult album instead. The revival of the band's heavier sound continued, albeit with fairly heavy use of synthesizers and some noticeable [[New wave music|New Wave]] influence on a few tracks. It contained other fan favorites such as \"[[Joan Crawford]]\" (inspired by the book and film ''[[Mommie Dearest]]'') and \"[[Veteran of the Psychic Wars]]\", another song co-written by Moorcock. Several of the songs had been written for the animated film ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'', but only \"Veteran of the Psychic Wars\" (which had not been written for ''Heavy Metal'') was actually used in the movie. The album marked a strong commercial resurgence for the band and achieved gold status, their first studio album since ''Spectres'' to do so.\n\nDuring the tour for ''Fire of Unknown Origin'', Albert Bouchard had a falling out with the others and left the band, and Rick Downey (formerly the band's lighting designer) replaced him on drums. This marked the end of the band's original and best-known lineup.\n\n===Decline and fall (1982\u20131987)===\nAfter leaving the band, Albert Bouchard spent five years working on a solo album based on Sandy Pearlman's poem \"Imaginos\". Blue \u00d6yster Cult also released a third live album ''[[Extraterrestrial Live]]''.\n\nThe band then went to the studio for the next album, ''[[The Rev\u00f6lution by Night]]'' (1983), with [[Bruce Fairbairn]] as producer. After two albums of a return to a harder rocking sound, the band adopted a more radio-friendly, AOR-oriented sound with Fairbairn providing a 1980s-style production. This approach met with some success, especially on its highest-charting single, Roeser's \"[[Shooting Shark]]\", co-written by Patti Smith and featuring [[Randy Jackson]] on bass, which reached number 83 on the charts. Bloom's \"[[Take Me Away (Blue \u00d6yster Cult song)|Take Me Away]]\", achieving some FM radio play. However, the album didn't match sales of its predecessor, failed to achieve gold status and marked the beginning of the band's second commercial decline. After touring for ''Rev\u00f6lution'', Rick Downey left, leaving Blue \u00d6yster Cult without a drummer.\n\nBOC re-united with Albert Bouchard for a California tour in February 1985, infamously known as the \u2018Albert Returns\u2019 Tour. This arrangement was only temporary and caused more tensions between the band and Bouchard, since he had thought he would be staying on permanently, which wasn't the case. The band had only intended to use him as a last-minute fill-in until another drummer could come on board, which resulted in Bouchard's leaving after the tour. Allen Lanier also quit the band shortly thereafter, leaving them without a keyboardist and with only three remaining original members. This incarnation of the band would sometimes be referred to as '3\u00d6C' by fans, a pun on the number of original members left.\n\nBlue \u00d6yster Cult hired drummer Jimmy Wilcox and keyboardist Tommy Zvoncheck to finish the album ''[[Club Ninja]]'', which was poorly received, with only \"Dancin' In the Ruins\" \u2014one of several songs on the record written entirely by outside songwriters\u2014enjoying minimal success on radio and [[MTV]]. The best-known original on the album is \"Perfect Water\" written by Dharma and [[Jim Carroll]] (noted author of ''[[The Basketball Diaries (book)|The Basketball Diaries]]''). While the band members have generally been disparaging about the album in retrospect, Joe Bouchard has stated that \"Perfect Water\" is \"perfect genius.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Blue \u00d6yster Cult: Secrets Revealed!|last1=Popoff|first1=Martin|date=March 2009|publisher=Power Chord Press|isbn=978-0-9752807-0-6|edition=2|location=[[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada|page=218|chapter=Club Ninja|authorlink1=Martin Popoff}}<!--| accessdate = 2012-03-17 --></ref>\n\nThe band toured in Germany, after which bassist Bouchard left, leaving only two members of the classic lineup: Eric Bloom and Donald Roeser. Some people referred to the band as \"Two \u00d6yster Cult\" during this period. Jon Rogers was hired to replace Joe and this version of the band finished out the 1986 tour. After it wound up that year, the band took a temporary break from recording and touring. [[File:Blue \u00d6yster Cult Sweden Rock 2008.jpg|thumb|Blue \u00d6yster Cult performing at the [[Sweden Rock Festival]], 2008.]] When Blue \u00d6yster Cult received an offer to tour in Greece in the early summer of 1987, the band reformed. Allen Lanier had agreed to rejoin so the new line-up now featured three founding members, along with Jon Rogers returning on bass and Ron Riddle as their newest drummer.\n\n[[Columbia Records]] was not interested in releasing the ''[[Imaginos]]'' project as an Albert Bouchard solo album so it was arranged for the record  to be released in 1988 by Columbia as a Blue \u00d6yster Cult album, with some new lead vocal overdubs from Bloom and Roeser and lead guitar overdubs from Roeser. These replaced most of Albert Bouchard's lead vocals, as well as many lead guitar parts that had been recorded by session musicians. Joe Bouchard and Allen Lanier had earlier contributed some minor keyboard and backing vocal parts to the album, allowing all five original members to be credited. The album didn't sell well (despite a positive review in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine) and though the then-current Blue \u00d6yster Cult lineup (minus both Bouchard brothers) toured to promote ''Imaginos'', promotion by the label was virtually non-existent. When Columbia Records' parent company CBS Records was purchased by [[Sony]] and became [[Sony Music Entertainment]], Blue \u00d6yster Cult were dropped from the label.\n\n=== 1990s and early 2000s ===\nThe band spent the next 11 years touring without releasing an album of new material, though they did contribute two new songs to the ''[[Bad Channels]]'' movie soundtrack, released in 1992, and also released an album of re-recorded songs from the band's original lineup called ''[[Cult Classic]]'' in 1994. During these years, while the three original members remained constant, there were several changes in the band's rhythm section. Ron Riddle quit in 1991 and was followed by a series of other drummers including\n[[Chuck Burgi]] (1991\u20131992, 1992\u20131995, 1996\u20131997), [[John Miceli]] (1992, 1995), John O'Reilly (1995\u20131996) and [[Bobby Rondinelli]] (1997\u20132004). As for the bass position, Rogers left in 1995, and was replaced by Danny Miranda.\n\n[[File:Blue \u00d6yster Cult 2012 Edmonton 223b.JPG|thumb|right|Blue \u00d6yster Cult performs in [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]], Canada on August 18, 2012.]]\nIn the late 1990s, Blue \u00d6yster Cult secured a recording contract with CMC Records (later purchased by [[Sanctuary Records]]), and continued to tour frequently. Two studio albums were released, ''[[Heaven Forbid]]'' (1998) and ''[[Curse of the Hidden Mirror]]'' (2001). Both albums featured songs co-written by cyberpunk/horror novelist [[John Shirley]]. The first mostly featured Miranda on bass and Burgi on drums, though a few tracks feature earliest bassist Jon Rogers and one track features Rondinelli on drums, who had joined the band near the end of the recording. ''Curse of the Hidden Mirror'' features Miranda and Rondinelli as the rhythm section, and the pair contributed to the songwriting as well. Neither album sold well.\n\nAnother live record, ''[[A Long Day's Night]]'' and DVD (same title), followed in 2002, both drawn from one concert in Chicago. This album also featured the Bloom, Roeser, Lanier, Miranda, Rondinelli lineup.\n\nAlthough the band's lineup had remained stable from 1997 to 2004, they began to experience personnel changes again in 2004. Rondinelli left in 2004, and was replaced by Jules Radino. Miranda left during the same year and ended up as the bassist for [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]]. He was replaced by Richie Castellano, who would also take occasional turns as a lead vocalist onstage.\n\nIn 2001, Sony/Columbia's reissue arm, [[Legacy Records]] issued expanded versions of the first four Blue \u00d6yster Cult studio albums, including some previously unreleased demos and outtakes from album sessions, live recordings (from the ''Live 72'' EP), and post-St. Cecilia tunes from the Stalk-Forrest Group era.\n\n[[File:Allenlanier.JPG|right|thumb|Blue \u00d6yster Cult live in 2006]]\n\n=== Recent events ===\nAllen Lanier retired from live performances in 2007 after not appearing with the band since late 2006. Castellano switched to rhythm guitar and keyboards (Castellano also filled in on lead guitar and vocals for an ailing Buck Dharma in two shows in 2005), and the position of bassist was taken up by [[Rudy Sarzo]] (previously a member of [[Quiet Riot]], [[Whitesnake]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Dio (band)|Dio]]), with the band employing Danny Miranda and Jon Rogers as guest bassists to fill in when Sarzo was unavailable. Sarzo then joined as an official member of the band, although Rogers continued to occasionally fill in when Sarzo was busy.\n\nIn February 2007, the Sony Legacy remaster series continued, releasing expanded versions of studio album ''[[Spectres (album)|Spectres]]'' and live album ''[[Some Enchanted Evening (Blue \u00d6yster Cult album)|Some Enchanted Evening]]''.\n\nIn June 2012, the band announced that bassist [[Rudy Sarzo]] was leaving the band and was being replaced by former [[Utopia (American band)|Utopia]] bassist [[Kasim Sulton]].\n\nIn August of the same year, it was announced that Sony Legacy would be releasing a 17-disc boxed set entitled ''The Complete Columbia Albums Collection'' on October 30, 2012. The set includes the first round of the remastered series plus the long-awaited remastered versions of ''On Your Feet or on Your Knees'' (1975), ''[[Mirrors (Blue \u00d6yster Cult album)|Mirrors]]'', ''[[Cult\u00f6saurus Erectus]]'', ''[[Fire Of Unknown Origin]]'', ''[[Extraterrestrial Live]]'', ''[[The Rev\u00f6lution by Night]]'', ''[[Club Ninja]]'' and ''[[Imaginos]]''. Also exclusive to this set are two discs of rare and unreleased B-sides, demos and radio broadcasts.\n\nAlso in 2012, celebrating the 40th anniversary of Blue \u00d6yster Cult, the then-current incarnation of the band reunited for the first time in 25 years with other original members Joe and Albert Bouchard and Allen Lanier as guests for a special event in New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/original-blue-oyster-cult-lineup-reunites-new-york-city/|title=Original Blue Oyster Cult Lineup Reunites in New York City|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}</ref>\n\nFounding keyboardist/guitarist Allen Lanier died of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] on August 14, 2013.<ref>[http://www.noise11.com/news/allen-lanier-of-blue-oyster-cult-dead-at-66-20130815 Allen Lanier of Blue Oyster Cult Dead At 66 | News | Music News].

Writer [[Richard Meltzer]] also provided the band with lyrics from their early days up through their most recent studio album. Pearlman also gave stage names to each of the band members (Jesse Python for Eric Bloom, Andy Panda for Andy Winters, Prince Omega for Albert Bouchard, La Verne for Allen Lanier) but only Buck Dharma kept his.<ref>{{cite book |last=Popoff |first=Martin |title=Blue Oyster Cult, Secrets Revealed! |publisher=Metal Blade Records, Inc. |isbn=0-9752807-0-8 |page=9|year=2004 }}</ref> The band recorded an album's worth of material for [[Elektra Records]] in 1968. When Braunstein departed in early 1969, Elektra shelved the album. In 1968, the band moved in together at their first house in the [[Thomaston, New York|Thomaston]] area of [[Great Neck, New York]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/blue-oyster-cult-s-40th-anniversary-cd-1.4147975|title=Blue Oyster Cult's 40th anniversary CD|last=October 26|first=STEVE KNOPPER Special to Newsday Updated|last2=Pm|first2=2012 2:26|website=Newsday|language=en|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n[[Eric Bloom]] was hired by the band as their [[acoustical engineering|acoustic engineer]] and eventually became lead singer, replacing Braunstein, through a series of three unlikely coincidences, one in which Lanier decided to join Bloom on a drive to an [[upstate New York|upstate]] gig where he spent the night with Bloom's old college bandmates and got to hear old tapes of Bloom's talent as lead vocalist.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR1NpyxowP4 \"Three Strokes of Fate\"], Living Legends Music interview (posted to YouTube on Nov 4, 2008) where Bloom explains three highly unlikely events that happened in which he ended up joining the band and becoming their lead singer:<br />1) Being their amp salesperson at Sam Ash,<br />2) Telling one person where he was staying in NYC and getting the soundboard job offer,<br />3) Upstate roadtrip where Lanier decided to join and got to hear Bloom's old band tapes as lead vocalist.</ref>  Because of this, Bloom was offered the job of lead singer for Soft White Underbelly. However, a bad review of a 1969 Fillmore East show caused Pearlman to change the name of the band&nbsp;\u2013 first to Oaxaca, then to the Stalk-Forrest Group. The band recorded yet another album's worth of material for Elektra, but only one single (\"What Is Quicksand?\" b/w \"Arthur Comics\") was released (and only in a promo edition of 300 copies) on [[Elektra Records]] (this album was eventually released, with additional outtakes, by Rhino Handmade Records as ''[[St. Cecilia: The Elektra Recordings]]'' in 2001). The album featured Bloom as their main lead singer, but Roeser also sang lead on a few songs, a pattern of sharing lead vocals that has continued throughout the band's career.\n\nAfter a few more temporary band names, including the Santos Sisters, the band settled on Blue \u00d6yster Cult in 1971 (see [[#Band name and logo|below]] for its origin).\n\nNew York City producer/composer and jingle writer [[David Lucas (composer)|David Lucas]] saw the band perform and took them into his Warehouse Recording Studio and produced four demos, with which Pearlman was able to get the renamed band another audition with [[Columbia Records]]. [[Clive Davis]] liked what he heard, and signed the band to the label. The first album was subsequently produced and recorded by Lucas on eight track at Lucas' studio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blueoystercult.com/Studio/SWbios.html#Lucas |title='David Lucas' in band-relations bio page|publisher=Official B\u00d6C website |date= |accessdate=2011-03-05}}</ref> Winters would leave the band and be replaced by Bouchard's brother, [[Joe Bouchard]].\n\n===Black-and-white years (1971\u20131975)===\nTheir debut album ''[[Blue \u00d6yster Cult (album)|Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]'' was released in January 1972, with a black-and-white cover designed by artist Bill Gawlik. The album featured the songs \"[[Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll]]\", \"Stairway to the Stars\" and \"Then Came the Last Days of May\". By this time, the band's sound had become more oriented toward hard rock, but songs like \"She's As Beautiful As a Foot\" and \"Redeemed\" also showed a strong element of the band's psychedelic roots. All of the band members except for Allen Lanier sang lead, a pattern that would continue on many subsequent albums, although lead singer Eric Bloom sang the majority of the songs. The album sold well, and Blue \u00d6yster Cult toured with artists such as [[the Byrds]], [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]] and [[Alice Cooper]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Perry |first=Shawn |url=http://www.vintagerock.com/ebloom_interview.aspx |title=The Eric Bloom Interview |publisher=Vintagerock.com |accessdate=2010-09-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720122423/http://www.vintagerock.com/ebloom_interview.aspx |archivedate=2007-07-20 }}</ref> During the touring process, the band's sound became heavier and more direct.\n\nTheir next album ''[[Tyranny and Mutation]]'', released in 1973, was written while the band was on tour for their first LP. It contained songs such as \"The Red and the Black\" (an ode to the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and a rewrite of \"I'm On the Lamb But I Ain't No Sheep\" from the debut album, and also a reference to [[The Red and the Black|the novel by Stendhal of the same name]]), \"Hot Rails to Hell\" and \"Baby Ice Dog\", the first of the band's many collaborations with [[Patti Smith]]. It featured a harder-rocking approach than before, though the band's songs were also growing more complex. The album outsold its predecessor, a trend that would continue with their next few albums.\n\nThe band's third album, ''[[Secret Treaties]]'' (1974)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://texasarchive.org/2010_03463|title=Blue \u00d6yster Cult Concert and Interview (1975)|last=|first=|date=|website=Texas Archive of the Moving Image|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 1, 2019}}</ref> received positive reviews, featuring songs such as \"Career of Evil\" (co-written by Patti Smith), \"Dominance and Submission\" and \"[[Astronomy (song)|Astronomy]]\". As a result of constant touring, the band was now capable of headlining arenas. The album continued the trend of growing sales, and would eventually go gold.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=blue+oyster+cult+secret+treaties#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA|work=RIAA|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAs the three albums during this formative period all had black-and-white covers, the period of their career has been dubbed the 'black and white years' by fans and critics.\n\n===Commercial success (1975\u20131981)===\nThe band's first live album ''[[On Your Feet or on Your Knees]]'' (1975) achieved greater success and went gold. Its success gave the band more time to work on a follow-up. The band members were able to purchase home recording units to record demos for their next album.\n\nTheir next studio album, ''[[Agents of Fortune]]'' (1976), was their first to go platinum and was again produced by David Lucas. It contained the hit single \"[[(Don't Fear) The Reaper]]\", which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts and has become a classic of the hard rock genre. Other major songs on the album were \"(This Ain't) The Summer of Love\", \"E.T.I. (Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence)\" and \"The Revenge of Vera Gemini\". Having recorded demos of the songs at home before recording the album, the band's songwriting process had become more individual, with none of the songs featuring the collaborative writing between the band members that had been common on their earlier albums.  Although the album still featured their trademark hard rock with sinister lyrics, the songs had become more conventional in structure, and the production was more polished.  For the first and only time, the album featured lead vocals from all five band members, with Allen Lanier singing lead on the song ''True Confessions.'' With Albert Bouchard singing lead on three songs and Joe Bouchard and Donald Roeser singing lead on one each, Eric Bloom ended up taking the lead on only four of the album's ten songs.\n\nFor the tour, the band added lasers to their light show, for which they became known. They were among the first acts to use lasers in performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blueoystercult.com/History/history6.html|publisher=Blue Oyster Cult.com|title=The History of B\u00d6C|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref>\n\nTheir next album, ''[[Spectres (album)|Spectres]]'' (1977), had the FM radio hit \"[[Godzilla (Blue \u00d6yster Cult song)|Godzilla]]\", and would become the one of the band's better-selling albums, with other well-known songs like \"I Love The Night\" and \"Goin' Through The Motions.\" However, its sales were not as strong as those for the previous album, going gold but not platinum, becoming their first album to sell less than its predecessor. It featured even more polished production, and continued the trend of the lead vocals extensively shared between members, although Allen Lanier did not sing lead. As with the previous album, Eric Bloom sang lead on fewer than half the songs.\n\nThe band then released another live album, ''[[Some Enchanted Evening (Blue \u00d6yster Cult album)|Some Enchanted Evening]]'' (1978). Though it was intended as another double-live album in the vein of ''On Your Feet or on Your Knees'', Columbia insisted that it be edited down to single-album length. It was a resounding commercial success, becoming Blue \u00d6yster Cult's most popular album and eventually selling over 2 million copies. It also revealed that while the band's studio work was becoming increasingly well-produced, they were still very much a hard rock band on stage.\n\nIt was followed by the studio album ''[[Mirrors (Blue \u00d6yster Cult album)|Mirrors]]'' (1979). For ''Mirrors'', instead of working with previous producers Sandy Pearlman (who instead went on to manage [[Black Sabbath]]) and Murray Krugman, Blue \u00d6yster Cult chose [[Tom Werman]], who had worked with acts such as [[Cheap Trick]] and [[Ted Nugent]]. It featured the band's glossiest production to date. It also gave Roeser, the lead vocalist on the band's biggest hits, bigger prominence as a vocalist, singing lead on four of the nine songs.  However, the resulting album sales were disappointing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldhistoryproject.org/1979/6/blue-oyster-cult-releases-mirrors|title=Blue \u00d6yster Cult releases Mirrors|website=World History Project}}</ref>\n\nPearlman's association with Black Sabbath led to Sabbath's ''[[Heaven and Hell (Black Sabbath album)|Heaven and Hell]]'' producer [[Martin Birch]] being hired for the next Blue \u00d6yster Cult record. The album found the band returning to their hard rock roots, and although both of the Bouchard brothers and guitarist Roeser all got lead vocal turns, Bloom would sing the majority of the tracks. The result was positive, with ''[[Cult\u00f6saurus Erectus]]'' (1980) receiving good reviews. The album went to number 12 in the United Kingdom, but did not do as well in the United States. The song \"[[Black Blade (song)|Black Blade]]\", which was written by Bloom with lyrics by science fiction and fantasy author [[Michael Moorcock]], is a kind of retelling of Moorcock's epic [[Elric of Melnibon\u00e9]] saga. The band also did a co-headlining tour with Black Sabbath in support of the album, calling the tour \"[[Black and Blue (video)|Black and Blue]]\".\n\nBirch produced the band's next album as well, ''[[Fire of Unknown Origin]]'' (1981). The biggest hit on this album was the Top 40 hit \"[[Burnin' for You]]\", a song Roeser had written with a [[Richard Meltzer]] lyric. He had intended to use it on his solo album, ''[[Flat Out (Buck Dharma album)|Flat Out]]'' (1982), but he was convinced to use it on the Blue \u00d6yster Cult album instead. The revival of the band's heavier sound continued, albeit with fairly heavy use of synthesizers and some noticeable [[New wave music|New Wave]] influence on a few tracks. It contained other fan favorites such as \"[[Joan Crawford]]\" (inspired by the book and film ''[[Mommie Dearest]]'') and \"[[Veteran of the Psychic Wars]]\", another song co-written by Moorcock. Several of the songs had been written for the animated film ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'', but only \"Veteran of the Psychic Wars\" (which had not been written for ''Heavy Metal'') was actually used in the movie. The album marked a strong commercial resurgence for the band and achieved gold status, their first studio album since ''Spectres'' to do so.\n\nDuring the tour for ''Fire of Unknown Origin'', Albert Bouchard had a falling out with the others and left the band, and Rick Downey (formerly the band's lighting designer) replaced him on drums. This marked the end of the band's original and best-known lineup.\n\n===Decline and fall (1982\u20131987)===\nAfter leaving the band, Albert Bouchard spent five years working on a solo album based on Sandy Pearlman's poem \"Imaginos\". Blue \u00d6yster Cult also released a third live album ''[[Extraterrestrial Live]]''.\n\nThe band then went to the studio for the next album, ''[[The Rev\u00f6lution by Night]]'' (1983), with [[Bruce Fairbairn]] as producer. After two albums of a return to a harder rocking sound, the band adopted a more radio-friendly, AOR-oriented sound with Fairbairn providing a 1980s-style production. This approach met with some success, especially on its highest-charting single, Roeser's \"[[Shooting Shark]]\", co-written by Patti Smith and featuring [[Randy Jackson]] on bass, which reached number 83 on the charts. Bloom's \"[[Take Me Away (Blue \u00d6yster Cult song)|Take Me Away]]\", achieving some FM radio play. However, the album didn\u2019t match sales of its predecessor, failed to achieve gold status and marked the beginning of the band's second commercial decline. After touring for ''Rev\u00f6lution'', Rick Downey left, leaving Blue \u00d6yster Cult without a drummer.\n\nBOC re-united with Albert Bouchard for a California tour in February 1985, infamously known as the \u2018Albert Returns\u2019 Tour. This arrangement was only temporary and caused more tensions between the band and Bouchard, since he had thought he would be staying on permanently, which wasn\u2019t the case. The band had only intended to use him as a last-minute fill-in until another drummer could come on board, which resulted in Bouchard's leaving after the tour. Allen Lanier also quit the band shortly thereafter, leaving them without a keyboardist and with only three remaining original members. This incarnation of the band would sometimes be referred to as '3\u00d6C' by fans, a pun on the number of original members left.\n\nBlue \u00d6yster Cult hired drummer Jimmy Wilcox and keyboardist Tommy Zvoncheck to finish the album ''[[Club Ninja]]'', which was poorly received, with only \"Dancin' In the Ruins\" \u2014one of several songs on the record written entirely by outside songwriters\u2014enjoying minimal success on radio and [[MTV]]. The best-known original on the album is \"Perfect Water\" written by Dharma and [[Jim Carroll]] (noted author of ''[[The Basketball Diaries (book)|The Basketball Diaries]]''). While the band members have generally been disparaging about the album in retrospect, Joe Bouchard has stated that \"Perfect Water\" is \"perfect genius.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Blue \u00d6yster Cult: Secrets Revealed!|last1=Popoff|first1=Martin|date=March 2009|publisher=Power Chord Press|isbn=978-0-9752807-0-6|edition=2|location=[[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada|page=218|chapter=Club Ninja|authorlink1=Martin Popoff}}<!--| accessdate = 2012-03-17 --></ref>\n\nThe band toured in Germany, after which bassist Bouchard left, leaving only two members of the classic lineup: Eric Bloom and Donald Roeser. Some people referred to the band as \"Two \u00d6yster Cult\" during this period. Jon Rogers was hired to replace Joe and this version of the band finished out the 1986 tour. After it wound up that year, the band took a temporary break from recording and touring. [[File:Blue \u00d6yster Cult Sweden Rock 2008.jpg|thumb|Blue \u00d6yster Cult performing at the [[Sweden Rock Festival]], 2008.]] When Blue \u00d6yster Cult received an offer to tour in Greece in the early summer of 1987, the band reformed. Allen Lanier had agreed to rejoin so the new line-up now featured three founding members, along with Jon Rogers returning on bass and Ron Riddle as their newest drummer.\n\n[[Columbia Records]] was not interested in releasing the ''[[Imaginos]]'' project as an Albert Bouchard solo album so it was arranged for the record  to be released in 1988 by Columbia as a Blue \u00d6yster Cult album, with some new lead vocal overdubs from Bloom and Roeser and lead guitar overdubs from Roeser. These replaced most of Albert Bouchard's lead vocals, as well as many lead guitar parts that had been recorded by session musicians. Joe Bouchard and Allen Lanier had earlier contributed some minor keyboard and backing vocal parts to the album, allowing all five original members to be credited. The album didn\u2019t sell well (despite a positive review in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine) and though the then-current Blue \u00d6yster Cult lineup (minus both Bouchard brothers) toured to promote ''Imaginos'', promotion by the label was virtually non-existent. When Columbia Records' parent company CBS Records was purchased by [[Sony]] and became [[Sony Music Entertainment]], Blue \u00d6yster Cult were dropped from the label.\n\n=== 1990s and early 2000s ===\nThe band spent the next 11 years touring without releasing an album of new material, though they did contribute two new songs to the ''[[Bad Channels]]'' movie soundtrack, released in 1992, and also released an album of re-recorded songs from the band's original lineup called ''[[Cult Classic]]'' in 1994. During these years, while the three original members remained constant, there were several changes in the band's rhythm section. Ron Riddle quit in 1991 and was followed by a series of other drummers including\n[[Chuck Burgi]] (1991\u20131992, 1992\u20131995, 1996\u20131997), [[John Miceli]] (1992, 1995), John O'Reilly (1995\u20131996) and [[Bobby Rondinelli]] (1997\u20132004). As for the bass position, Rogers left in 1995, and was replaced by Danny Miranda.\n\n[[File:Blue \u00d6yster Cult 2012 Edmonton 223b.JPG|thumb|right|Blue \u00d6yster Cult performs in [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]], Canada on August 18, 2012.]]\nIn the late 1990s, Blue \u00d6yster Cult secured a recording contract with CMC Records (later purchased by [[Sanctuary Records]]), and continued to tour frequently. Two studio albums were released, ''[[Heaven Forbid]]'' (1998) and ''[[Curse of the Hidden Mirror]]'' (2001). Both albums featured songs co-written by cyberpunk/horror novelist [[John Shirley]]. The first mostly featured Miranda on bass and Burgi on drums, though a few tracks feature earliest bassist Jon Rogers and one track features Rondinelli on drums, who had joined the band near the end of the recording. ''Curse of the Hidden Mirror'' features Miranda and Rondinelli as the rhythm section, and the pair contributed to the songwriting as well. Neither album sold well.\n\nAnother live record, ''[[A Long Day's Night]]'' and DVD (same title), followed in 2002, both drawn from one concert in Chicago. This album also featured the Bloom, Roeser, Lanier, Miranda, Rondinelli lineup.\n\nAlthough the band's lineup had remained stable from 1997 to 2004, they began to experience personnel changes again in 2004. Rondinelli left in 2004, and was replaced by Jules Radino. Miranda left during the same year and ended up as the bassist for [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]]. He was replaced by Richie Castellano, who would also take occasional turns as a lead vocalist onstage.\n\nIn 2001, Sony/Columbia's reissue arm, [[Legacy Records]] issued expanded versions of the first four Blue \u00d6yster Cult studio albums, including some previously unreleased demos and outtakes from album sessions, live recordings (from the ''Live 72'' EP), and post-St. Cecilia tunes from the Stalk-Forrest Group era.\n\n[[File:Allenlanier.JPG|right|thumb|Blue \u00d6yster Cult live in 2006]]\n\n=== Recent events ===\nAllen Lanier retired from live performances in 2007 after not appearing with the band since late 2006. Castellano switched to rhythm guitar and keyboards (Castellano also filled in on lead guitar and vocals for an ailing Buck Dharma in two shows in 2005), and the position of bassist was taken up by [[Rudy Sarzo]] (previously a member of [[Quiet Riot]], [[Whitesnake]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Dio (band)|Dio]]), with the band employing Danny Miranda and Jon Rogers as guest bassists to fill in when Sarzo was unavailable. Sarzo then joined as an official member of the band, although Rogers continued to occasionally fill in when Sarzo was busy.\n\nIn February 2007, the Sony Legacy remaster series continued, releasing expanded versions of studio album ''[[Spectres (album)|Spectres]]'' and live album ''[[Some Enchanted Evening (Blue \u00d6yster Cult album)|Some Enchanted Evening]]''.\n\nIn June 2012, the band announced that bassist [[Rudy Sarzo]] was leaving the band and was being replaced by former [[Utopia (American band)|Utopia]] bassist [[Kasim Sulton]].\n\nIn August of the same year, it was announced that Sony Legacy would be releasing a 17-disc boxed set entitled ''The Complete Columbia Albums Collection'' on October 30, 2012. The set includes the first round of the remastered series plus the long-awaited remastered versions of ''On Your Feet or on Your Knees'' (1975), ''[[Mirrors (Blue \u00d6yster Cult album)|Mirrors]]'', ''[[Cult\u00f6saurus Erectus]]'', ''[[Fire Of Unknown Origin]]'', ''[[Extraterrestrial Live]]'', ''[[The Rev\u00f6lution by Night]]'', ''[[Club Ninja]]'' and ''[[Imaginos]]''. Also exclusive to this set are two discs of rare and unreleased B-sides, demos and radio broadcasts.\n\nAlso in 2012, celebrating the 40th anniversary of Blue \u00d6yster Cult, the then-current incarnation of the band reunited for the first time in 25 years with other original members Joe and Albert Bouchard and Allen Lanier as guests for a special event in New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/original-blue-oyster-cult-lineup-reunites-new-york-city/|title=Original Blue Oyster Cult Lineup Reunites in New York City|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}</ref>\n\nFounding keyboardist/guitarist Allen Lanier died of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] on August 14, 2013.<ref>[http://www.noise11.com/news/allen-lanier-of-blue-oyster-cult-dead-at-66-20130815 Allen Lanier of Blue Oyster Cult Dead At 66 | News | Music News].

The shows featured songs from ''Agents of Fortune'' that had either not been played live before (\"True Confessions\", \"The Revenge of Vera Gemini\", \"Sinful Love\", \"Tenderloin\", \"Debbie Denise\"), songs that had not been played since the album's debut tour (\"Morning Final\"), and songs that were either no longer or never were played frequently (\"This Ain't the Summer of Love\", \"Tattoo Vampire\"), as well as the fan favorite \"Five Guitars\", which had not been played since Albert initially left the band in 1981. Albert played in the following songs at the show: \"The Revenge of Vera Gemini\" (vocals, guitar), \"Sinful Love\" (vocals, guitar), \"Tattoo Vampire\" (guitar), \"Morning Final\" (guitar), \"Tenderloin\" (cymbals), \"Debbie Denise\" (vocals, acoustic guitar), \"Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll\" (vocals, drums), and \"Five Guitars\" (guitar).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://getreadytorock.me.uk/blog/2016/07/gig-review-blue-oyster-cult-kentish-town-forum-29-july-2016/|title=Gig review: BLUE OYSTER CULT \u2013 Kentish Town Forum, London, 29 July 2016|work=Get Ready to ROCK!

Recording with Danny, Richie and Jules should be a great experience as we've been touring together for years, and Buck and I look forward to including them in the creative and recording process,\" said Bloom. \"The current band is GREAT and has never been recorded other than live, so we feel now's the time for new songs to be written and recorded. About half of the songs for the new record exist and the rest will be finished during the process,\" added Buck Dharma.

Pearlman had also come up with the band's earlier name, \"Soft White Underbelly\", from a phrase used by [[Winston Churchill]] in describing [[Italy]] during [[World War II]].

A \"remake\" (rather than a re-telling) of [[Heidi, Girl of the Alps]], much of the story is the same; the titular character is a then-five-year-old girl, who's taken to her grandfather on the [[Swiss Alps]] by her aunt, Dete to live with him and while the girl ends up improving his life, she also befriends Peter, the goatherd of the village Dorfli below and the one who causes her to find a big passion of hers, goats and other animals in general. But in this version, there is also a trio, Karl, Theresa, and William, who usually try to do something that would downgrade Peter, whom they often refer to as a mountain goat, in some way or another. But in the first winter up there, a letter is eventually gotten and what results from there will end up changing another's life, as well.\n\nThe series has been distributed in 138 countries around the world.\n\n==Characters==\nThe actors cited are from the Australian cast.\n\n*Heidi Meier (voiced by Monique Hore): The title character, a cute and innocent orphan girl, who grows from five to eight years old over the series, like its base, as well as the base novel.\n*Ernst Meier (voiced by Peter McAllum): Heidi's grandfather, an angerable and turned-grump old man who works as a carpenter.\n*Peter (voiced by Nicole Shostak): Young goatherd. He owns the goat Goldfinch, who becomes a mother to baby Mischief.\n*Dete (voiced by Beth Armstrong): Heidi's mother's sister and her aunt who forcibly leaves Heidi with her grandfather and shows sacchranine self-righteousness with those around her, including her own niece. She works as a partly cooking maid in the Sesemann household, with bulter Sebastian who she eventually falls in love with and marries, though where is not actually specified.\n*Karl Traber (voiced by Charlotte Hamlyn): Used to call Peter \"Billy goat\" until an incident where he saved Karl's life.\n*Theresa Keller (voiced by Charlotte Hamlyn): Owns the goat Sweetheart. Theresa is often mean to Heidi and Peter, along with Karl and William but accepts them in episode 33 and starts being a lot nicer. \n*William (voiced by Jamie Croft): A short and obese member of the trio-turned-duo, tends to be distracted by thoughts of food and gets easily filled with fear and has a goat owned by his own family.\n*Clara Sesemann (voiced by Sophia Morrison): A little girl and rich who is in a wheelchair, Heidi helps her to walk again and was a tough coach to her.\n*Josef: Heidi's grandfather's Saint Bernard.\n*Miss Vera Rottenmeier (voiced by Beth Armstrong): The Sesemann household's strict governess, who has an overblown worry of Clara's health, focus on the kids' education and reactions towards animals (though whom she has an allergy of), highly conformist and attemptively enforcing of it, the most on \"Adeleid\" (Heidi), and refuses other's opinions more often than not, in useless stubbornness.\n*Sebastian (voiced by [[Jamie Croft]]): The Sesemann household's butler.\n*Mr. Sesemann (voiced by Peter McAllum): Clara's father.\n*Joan Keller (voiced by Peter McAllum, Jamie Croft): Dorfli's grocer, and Theresa's father.\n*Alda Keller (voiced by Nicole Shostak): Theresa's snobby mother.\n*Tobias Meier: Heidi's deceased father, who never built the Devil Bridge over a mountain gap he and his son worked on.\n*Adelaide Meier: Heidi's deceased mother, and Dete's sister.\n*Anna Meier: Heidi's grandfather's late wife.\n*Brigitte (voiced by Beth Armstrong): Peter's mother.\n*Suzanne (voiced by Beth Armstrong): Peter's blind grandmother.\n*Barbel (voiced by [[Kate Fitzpatrick]]): A friend of Dete's, and William' mother.\n*Hans: Barbel's husband, the village blacksmith. William's father.\n*Grandmamma (voiced by [[Penny Cook]]): Clara's kind and youthful grandmother. She is an actress in the theatre.\n*Hans Bakker: A frustratable home school teacher who excessively punishes Heidi for her confusions and whose own teaching method includes torture involving physical pressure, the latter mentioned which gets him fired from teaching at Sesemann's.\n*Mr. Traber: Karl's father, who is a school teacher. He and Karl move before Clara's visit.\n*Rudy: A boy in Frankfurt who plays a [[barrel organ]] in the street. Owns the kittens Socks and Star.\n*Dr. Bankman: The Sesemann family doctor.\n*Mr. Dinkelmann: In one episode he came to the Sesemann's house to be regarding a adoption for Heidi to be Clara's sister\n\n==Episode list== \n# Up to the Mountain\n# First Day in the Mountains\n# The Challenge\n# Save Chippy\n# The Treehouse Oath\n# A Night Out\n# For a Loaf of Bread\n# Trapped in the Manor\n# Beware of the Wolf\n# Peter's Treasure\n# Attack the Treehouse\n# Save Sweetheart\n# The End of Spring\n# Clara\n# The Bell Tower\n# The Promise\n# Papa Returns\n# Home Schooled\n# Let's Make a Show\n# At the Park\n# Clara Stands\n# Goats in the City\n# The Resignation\n# A Tree for Shelter\n# The Ghost\n# The Letter\n# Back to [[Sertig|D\u00f6rfli]]\n# A New Goat in the Herd\n# The Broken Statue\n# The Brooch\n# The School Test\n# Scavenger Hunt\n# Goat's Hour\n# The Storm\n# The Devil's Bridge\n# Friedrich\n# The Wheelchair\n# Forgiven\n# The Edelweiss\n\n==Production==\nOn the behalf of [[ZDF]], one of the series' co-producers, with the intention of renewing Heidi, Girl of the Alps and fellow series to the modern children's audience, the series was produced from 2013\u201314, mainly in France, that much like [[Maya the Bee]] and [[Vicky the Viking]] before, including being done by the same main studio, on the behalf of [[ZDF]], but in this production, multiple other companies, including the Australia-based, specifically-made Heidi Pyl, joined in on making the series.\n\nIn the first production, from the writing bible, written by Christel Gonnard, was the first twenty-seven episodes first had their locations shot with high-definition footage, for reference to the animators making the now-fictionalized locations of the series, in Haute-Savoie for the Alps (referred to as that, rather than the Alm, as in the base series and novel) and in Friborg for Frankfurt, similarly to Zuyio (later Nippon)'s team shooting pictures of the official locations themselves, for the setting references to background painters and writers, for the base series. The two halves that happened to be made in that production were directed, respectively, by Pierre-Antoine Hiroz and Anne Deluz. The theme music was two songs at the time; the credits song, replaced by a bit of a piece of background music from the series, when the series was bought the rights out of, was sung by Cindy Santos, first known in 2006, when she participated in the French show Nouvelle Star.\n\nThe first three episodes were screen as a \"world preview\" at Geneva's Tout Ecran Movie Festival (Festival Cin\u00e9ma Tout Ecran) on October 31, 2007 (albeit only coincidentally for [[Halloween]]). Later, was a twenty-episode documentary series, of three minutes each episode, and produced by Rita and Chocolat TV Productions, aired on T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Suisse Romande as well as on Chocolat's website, before the latter was removed, which documented the first production. Afterwards, an account of a promoter, impersonating an now-teenage Heidi, was opened on a blog and a [[MySpace]] page, where the character promoted the series. The series premiered on the Swiss network [[T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Suisse Romande]] on December 22, 2007, in Swiss HD. In France, [[Studio 100 Animation]] bought the rights in 2013 and produced a 3D series of 39 episodes of 26 minutes each, now directed by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mouscadet, from that year to 2014 and the completed series began airing in 2015.\n\nDue to the partnership of Eurovision Fiction, was the series sent to their affiliated countries, including [[Ireland]], [[Norway]] (see below), [[Cyprus]] (in [[Greek language|Greek]] dub), [[Slovakia]] (also see below), [[Bulgaria]] and [[Poland]] and aired (as of recent, at least part-finished) on the EBU member chains of those countries.\n\n==Changes==\nFrom ''[[Heidi, Girl of the Alps]]'', for time and/or other reasons, were several changes made in this version:\n\n* The characterizations were heavily simplified; with Heidi, her emotions were more prominent and her friendship with Peter is less affected by his beating tendencies of the goats, partly because they are stopped at once, when Heidi sees that and does her action.\n* Sub-plots, from Heidi's relationship with the fir trees to the eventual living in the winter home, are either altered (including being simplified) or removed entirely or even created for this series: of the last one, partway through Heidi learning how to read, Clara and her grandmother inform Heidi of: \"[[Princess and the Frog]]\", which they turn to making performance out of; based on that fairy tale being one of those shown with its illustration to Heidi, while Clara's grandmother first encouraged her to learn how to read, that night.\n* Many of the base series' more episodic plots are re-told; the \"Sad News-Snowflake\" two-parter is told as: \"Save Sweetheart\", where the butcher is independent of the goat, the plants searched for saving the goat are in a singular place and adds the sub-plot of Therese trying to keep one of the flock at bay, while Peter and Heidi climb the nearby mountains for the plants.\n* Clara's training to being walking begins while Heidi's still in Frankfurt and progresses from there to episode thirty-eight.\n* Elements from the two-part novel, including the religious elements (generally removed in the base series for comprehensibility issues with the more current Buddhist audience) are returned, sometimes loosely; Heidi's tendend prayers to the little star is based on her praying to God, to find a way to get her home to the Alm, inspired by Clara's grandmother's advice.\n* A \"terrible trio\" group of villains are introduced, most prominent in the first third of the series, where they usually try to get Peter's secret cabin to themselves, especially from Heidi.

A \"remake\" (rather than a re-telling) of [[Heidi, Girl of the Alps]], much of the story is the same; the titular character is a then-five-year-old girl, who's taken to her grandfather on the [[Swiss Alps]] by her aunt, Dete to live with him and while the girl ends up improving his life, she also befriends Peter, the goatherd of the village Dorfli below and the one who causes her to find a big passion of hers, goats and other animals in general. But in this version, there is also a trio, Karl, Theresa, and William, who usually try to do something that would downgrade Peter, whom they often refer to as a mountain goat, in some way or another. But in the first winter up there, a letter is eventually gotten and what results from there will end up changing another's life, as well.\n\nThe series has been distributed in 138 countries around the world.\n\n==Characters==\nThe actors cited are from the Australian cast.\n\n*Heidi Meier (voiced by Monique Hore): The title character, a cute and innocent orphan girl, who grows from five to eight years old over the series, like its base, as well as the base novel.\n*Ernst Meier (voiced by Peter McAllum): Heidi's grandfather, an angerable and turned-grump old man who works as a carpenter.\n*Peter (voiced by Nicole Shostak): Young goatherd.

The two halves that happened to be made in that production were directed, respectively, by Pierre-Antoine Hiroz and Anne Deluz. The theme music was two songs at the time; the credits song, replaced by a bit of a piece of background music from the series, when the series was bought the rights out of, was sung by Cindy Santos, first known in 2006, when she participated in the French show Nouvelle Star.\n\nThe first three episodes were screen as a \"world preview\" at Geneva's Tout Ecran Movie Festival (Festival Cin\u00e9ma Tout Ecran) on October 31, 2007 (albeit only coincidentally for [[Halloween]]). Later, was a twenty-episode documentary series, of three minutes each episode, and produced by Rita and Chocolat TV Productions, aired on T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Suisse Romande as well as on Chocolat's website, before the latter was removed, which documented the first production. Afterwards, an account of a promoter, impersonating an now-teenage Heidi, was opened on a blog and a [[MySpace]] page, where the character promoted the series. The series premiered on the Swiss network [[T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Suisse Romande]] on December 22, 2007, in Swiss HD. In France, [[Studio 100 Animation]] bought the rights in 2013 and produced a 3D series of 39 episodes of 26 minutes each, now directed by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mouscadet, from that year to 2014 and the completed series began airing in 2015.\n\nDue to the partnership of Eurovision Fiction, was the series sent to their affiliated countries, including [[Ireland]], [[Norway]] (see below), [[Cyprus]] (in [[Greek language|Greek]] dub), [[Slovakia]] (also see below), [[Bulgaria]] and [[Poland]] and aired (as of recent, at least part-finished) on the EBU member chains of those countries.\n\n==Changes==\nFrom ''[[Heidi, Girl of the Alps]]'', for time and/or other reasons, were several changes made in this version:\n\n* The characterizations were heavily simplified; with Heidi, her emotions were more prominent and her friendship with Peter is less affected by his beating tendencies of the goats, partly because they are stopped at once, when Heidi sees that and does her action.\n* Sub-plots, from Heidi's relationship with the fir trees to the eventual living in the winter home, are either altered (including being simplified) or removed entirely or even created for this series: of the last one, partway through Heidi learning how to read, Clara and her grandmother inform Heidi of: \"[[Princess and the Frog]]\", which they turn to making performance out of; based on that fairy tale being one of those shown with its illustration to Heidi, while Clara's grandmother first encouraged her to learn how to read, that night.\n* Many of the base series' more episodic plots are re-told; the \"Sad News-Snowflake\" two-parter is told as: \"Save Sweetheart\", where the butcher is independent of the goat, the plants searched for saving the goat are in a singular place and adds the sub-plot of Therese trying to keep one of the flock at bay, while Peter and Heidi climb the nearby mountains for the plants.\n* Clara's training to being walking begins while Heidi's still in Frankfurt and progresses from there to episode thirty-eight.\n* Elements from the two-part novel, including the religious elements (generally removed in the base series for comprehensibility issues with the more current Buddhist audience) are returned, sometimes loosely; Heidi's tendend prayers to the little star is based on her praying to God, to find a way to get her home to the Alm, inspired by Clara's grandmother's advice.\n* A \"terrible trio\" group of villains are introduced, most prominent in the first third of the series, where they usually try to get Peter's secret cabin to themselves, especially from Heidi. Their trio ends when Carl moves away.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nWhile it was a simple success in France, in countries where the original series is well-loved, from Mexico to Germany, it has, at the most positive, gotten a lukewarm reaction, including claims from [[Latin American]] fans that the story changes \"ruined\" the entire series, much like other series like this.
