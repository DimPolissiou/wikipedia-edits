After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes,<ref name=Haugen_p9_71>[[#Haugen|Haugen]], pp. 9, 71</ref> Mussolini and his followers consolidated their power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a [[one-party state|one-party dictatorship]]. Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and extraordinary means and aspired to create a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state. In 1929, Mussolini signed the [[Lateran Treaty]] with the Vatican, ending decades of struggle between the Italian state and the Papacy, and recognized the independence of [[Vatican City]].\n\nMussolini's foreign policy aimed to expand the sphere of influence of [[Italian fascism]]. In 1923, he began the \"[[Pacification of Libya]]\" and [[Corfu incident|ordered the bombing of Corfu]] in retaliation for the murder of an Italian general. In 1936, Mussolini formed [[Italian East Africa]] (AOI) by merging [[Eritrea]], [[Italian Somaliland|Somalia]] and [[Ethiopia]] following the [[Abyssinian crisis]] and the [[Second Italo\u2013Ethiopian War]]. In 1939, Italian forces occupied [[Albania]]. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered the successful [[Italian military intervention in Spain]] in favor of [[Francisco Franco]] during the [[Spanish civil war]]. At the same time, Mussolini's Italy tried to avoid the outbreak of a second global war and took part in the [[Stresa front]], the [[Lytton Report]], the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the [[Four-Power Pact]] and the [[Munich Agreement]]. However, Italy distanced Britain and France by forming the [[axis powers]] with Germany and Japan. Germany [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, resulting in declarations of war by France and the UK and the start of [[World War II]].\n\nOn 10 June 1940\u2014with the [[Fall of France]] imminent\u2014Italy officially entered the war and eventually occupied [[Italian occupation of France|parts of south-east France]], [[Italian occupation of Corsica|Corsica]], and [[Tunisian campaign|Tunisia]]. Mussolini planned to concentrate Italian forces on a major offensive against the [[British Empire]] in Africa and the Middle East, known as the \"parallel war\", while expecting the collapse of the UK in the [[European theatre of world war II|European theatre]]. The Italians [[Italian invasion of Egypt|invaded Egypt]], [[Italian bombing of Mandatory Palestine in World War II|bombed Mandatory Palestine]], and [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|occupied British Somaliland]] with initial success. However, the British government refused to accept proposals for a peace that would involve accepting [[Axis Powers|Axis]] victories in Eastern and Western Europe; plans for an invasion of the UK did not proceed and the war continued. In October 1940, Mussolini sent Italian forces into Greece, starting the [[Greco-Italian War]]. The [[Royal Air force]] prevented the Italian invasion and allowed the Greeks to push the Italians back to Albania.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=IoIlDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT85&dq=Italian+forces+in+Greece+british+air+force#v=onepage&q=Italian%20forces%20in%20Greece%20british%20air%20force&f=false |title = The Desert Air Force in World War II: Air Power in the Western Desert, 1940-1942|isbn = 9781526703798|last1 = Delve|first1 = Ken Delve|date = 31 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkan campaign]] was significantly prolonged until the definition of the [[Axis occupation of Greece]] and [[Occupation of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

He also did office work for the local Socialist Party, and edited its newspaper ''L'Avvenire del Lavoratore'' (''The Future of the Worker''). Returning to Italy, he spent a brief time in Milan, and in 1910 he returned to his hometown of Forl\u00ec, where he edited the weekly ''Lotta di classe'' (''The Class Struggle'').\n\nMussolini thought of himself as an intellectual and was considered to be well-read. He read avidly; his favorites in European philosophy included Sorel, the Italian Futurist [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], French Socialist [[Gustave Herv\u00e9]], Italian anarchist [[Errico Malatesta]], and German philosophers [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Karl Marx]], the founders of [[Marxism]].<ref>Denis Mack Smith, ''Mussolini; A biography'' (1982) pp. 9\u201313</ref><ref>R.J.B.

One of the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the war was [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] who promoted [[Italian irredentism]] and helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in the war.{{sfn|Tucker|2005|p=335}} The [[Italian Liberal Party]] under the leadership of [[Paolo Boselli]] promoted intervention in the war on the side of the Allies and utilized the [[Societ\u00e0 Dante Alighieri]] to promote Italian nationalism.{{sfn|Tucker|2005|p=219}}{{sfn|Tucker|2005|p=826}} Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose it.{{sfn|Tucker|2005|p=209}} Prior to Mussolini taking a position on the war, a number of revolutionary [[Syndicalism|syndicalists]] had announced their support of intervention, including [[Alceste De Ambris]], [[Filippo Corridoni]], and [[Angelo Oliviero Olivetti]].{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=189}} The [[Italian Socialist Party]] decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors had been killed, resulting in a general strike called [[Red Week (Italy)|Red Week]].{{sfn|Tucker|2005|p=596}}\n\nMussolini initially held official support for the party's decision and, in an August 1914 article, Mussolini wrote \"Down with the War. We remain neutral.\" He saw the war as an opportunity, both for his own ambitions as well as those of socialists and Italians. He was influenced by [[Anti-Austrian sentiment|anti-Austrian]] Italian nationalist sentiments, believing that the war offered Italians in Austria-Hungary the chance to liberate themselves from rule of the [[Hapsburg|Habsburgs]]. He eventually decided to declare support for the war by appealing to the need for socialists to overthrow the [[Hohenzollern]] and Habsburg monarchies in Germany and Austria-Hungary who he said had consistently repressed socialism.<ref name=\"Emile Ludwig 1969. p. 321\">Emil Ludwig.

The ''Arditi'''s black uniform and use of the fez were adopted by Mussolini in the creation of his Fascist movement.]]\n\nMussolini further justified his position by denouncing the [[Central Powers]] for being [[reactionary]] powers; for pursuing [[Imperialism|imperialist]] designs against Belgium and Serbia as well as historically against Denmark, France, and against Italians, since hundreds of thousands of Italians were under Habsburg rule. He argued that the fall of Hohenzollern and Habsburg monarchies and the repression of \"reactionary\" Turkey would create conditions beneficial for the working class. While he was supportive of the Entente powers, Mussolini responded to the conservative nature of [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]] by stating that the mobilization required for the war would undermine Russia's reactionary authoritarianism and the war would bring Russia to social revolution. He said that for Italy the war would complete the process of ''[[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]'' by uniting the Italians in Austria-Hungary into Italy and by allowing the common people of Italy to be participating members of the Italian nation in what would be Italy's first national war. Thus he claimed that the vast social changes that the war could offer meant that it should be supported as a revolutionary war.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=189}}\n\nAs Mussolini's support for the intervention solidified, he came into conflict with socialists who opposed the war. He attacked the opponents of the war and claimed that those proletarians who supported [[pacifism]] were out of step with the proletarians who had joined the rising interventionist [[Vanguardism|vanguard]] that was preparing Italy for a revolutionary war. He began to criticize the Italian Socialist Party and socialism itself for having failed to recognize the national problems that had led to the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=191}} He was expelled from the party for his support of intervention.\n\nThe following excerpts are from a police report prepared by the Inspector-General of Public Security in Milan, G. Gasti, that describe his background and his position on the First World War that resulted in his ousting from the Italian Socialist Party. The Inspector General wrote:\n{{bquote|Professor Benito Mussolini,&nbsp;... 38, revolutionary socialist, has a police record; elementary school teacher qualified to teach in secondary schools; former first secretary of the Chambers in Cesena, Forl\u00ec, and Ravenna; after 1912 editor of the newspaper ''Avanti!'' to which he gave a violent suggestive and intransigent orientation. In October 1914, finding himself in opposition to the directorate of the Italian Socialist party because he advocated a kind of active neutrality on the part of Italy in the War of the Nations against the party's tendency of absolute neutrality, he withdrew on the twentieth of that month from the directorate of ''Avanti!'' Then on the fifteenth of November [1914], thereafter, he initiated publication of the newspaper ''Il Popolo d'Italia'', in which he supported\u2014in sharp contrast to ''Avanti!'' and amid bitter polemics against that newspaper and its chief backers\u2014the thesis of Italian intervention in the war against the militarism of the Central Empires. For this reason he was accused of moral and political unworthiness and the party thereupon decided to expel him&nbsp;... Thereafter he&nbsp;... undertook a very active campaign in behalf of Italian intervention, participating in demonstrations in the piazzas and writing quite violent articles in Popolo d'Italia&nbsp;...<ref name=\"Mediterranean4\" />}}\n\nIn his summary, the Inspector also noted:\n{{bquote|He was the ideal editor of ''Avanti!'' for the Socialists. In that line of work he was greatly esteemed and beloved. Some of his former comrades and admirers still confess that there was no one who understood better how to interpret the spirit of the proletariat and there was no one who did not observe his apostasy with sorrow. This came about not for reasons of self-interest or money. He was a sincere and passionate advocate, first of vigilant and armed neutrality, and later of war; and he did not believe that he was compromising with his personal and political honesty by making use of every means\u2014no matter where they came from or wherever he might obtain them\u2014to pay for his newspaper, his program and his line of action. This was his initial line. It is difficult to say to what extent his socialist convictions (which he never either openly or privately abjure) may have been sacrificed in the course of the indispensable financial deals which were necessary for the continuation of the struggle in which he was engaged&nbsp;... But assuming these modifications did take place&nbsp;... he always wanted to give the appearance of still being a socialist, and he fooled himself into thinking that this was the case.<ref>''Mediterranean Fascism 1919\u20131945'' Edited by Charles F.

''Modern Italy; A Political History''. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press. p. 284.</ref> Further funding for Mussolini's Fascists during the war came from French sources, beginning in May 1915. A major source of this funding from France is believed to have been from French socialists who sent support to dissident socialists who wanted Italian intervention on France's side.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=200}}\n\nOn 5 December 1914, Mussolini denounced [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox socialism]] for failing to recognize that the war had made national identity and loyalty more significant than class distinction.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=191}} He fully demonstrated his transformation in a speech that acknowledged the nation as an entity, a notion he had rejected prior to the war, saying:\n{{bquote|The nation has not disappeared. We used to believe that the concept was totally without substance. Instead we see the nation arise as a palpitating reality before us!&nbsp;... Class cannot destroy the nation. Class reveals itself as a collection of interests\u2014but the nation is a history of sentiments, traditions, language, culture, and race. Class can become an integral part of the nation, but the one cannot eclipse the other.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|pp=191\u201392}}<br />The class struggle is a vain formula, without effect and consequence wherever one finds a people that has not integrated itself into its proper linguistic and racial confines\u2014where the national problem has not been definitely resolved. In such circumstances the class movement finds itself impaired by an inauspicious historic climate.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=192}}}}\n\nMussolini continued to promote the need of a revolutionary vanguard elite to lead society. He no longer advocated a proletarian vanguard, but instead a vanguard led by dynamic and revolutionary people of any social class.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=192}}\nThough he denounced orthodox socialism and class conflict, he maintained at the time that he was a nationalist socialist and a supporter of the legacy of nationalist socialists in Italy's history, such as [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], and [[Carlo Pisacane]]. As for the Italian Socialist Party and its support of orthodox socialism, he claimed that his failure as a member of the party to revitalize and transform it to recognize the contemporary reality revealed the hopelessness of orthodox socialism as outdated and a failure.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=193}} This perception of the failure of orthodox socialism in the light of the outbreak of World War I was not solely held by Mussolini; other pro-interventionist Italian socialists such as [[Filippo Corridoni]] and [[Sergio Panunzio]] had also denounced classical [[Marxism]] in favor of intervention.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=195}}\n\n[[File:Mussolini bersagliere.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Mussolini as a ''[[bersagliere]]'' during WWI]]\n\nThese basic political views and principles formed the basis of Mussolini's newly formed political movement, the ''Fasci Rivoluzionari d'Azione Internazionalista'' in 1914, who called themselves ''Fascisti'' (Fascists).{{sfn|Gregor|1979|pp=193, 195}} At this time, the Fascists did not have an integrated set of policies and the movement was small, ineffective in its attempts to hold mass meetings, and was regularly harassed by government authorities and orthodox socialists.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|pp=195\u201396}} Antagonism between the interventionists, including the Fascists, versus the anti-interventionist orthodox socialists resulted in violence between the Fascists and socialists. The opposition and attacks by the anti-interventionist revolutionary socialists against the Fascists and other interventionists were so violent that even [[democratic socialist]]s who opposed the war such as [[Anna Kuliscioff]] said that the Italian Socialist Party had gone too far in a campaign of silencing the freedom of speech of supporters of the war. These early hostilities between the Fascists and the revolutionary socialists shaped Mussolini's conception of the nature of Fascism in its support of political violence.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=196}}\n\nMussolini became an ally with the [[Irredentism|irredentist]] politician and journalist [[Cesare Battisti (politician)|Cesare Battisti]] and\u2014like him\u2014entered the Army and served in the war. \"He was sent to the zone of operations where he was seriously injured by the explosion of a grenade.\"<ref name=\"Mediterranean4\"/>\n\nThe Inspector General continued:\n{{bquote|He was promoted to the rank of corporal \"for merit in war\".

Mussolini utilized works of [[Plato]], [[Georges Sorel]], [[Nietzsche]], and the economic ideas of [[Vilfredo Pareto]], to develop fascism. Mussolini admired Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', which he often read for inspiration.{{sfn|Moseley|2004|p=39}} ''The Republic'' expounded a number of ideas that fascism promoted, such as rule by an elite promoting the state as the ultimate end, opposition to democracy, protecting the class system and promoting class collaboration, rejection of egalitarianism, promoting the militarization of a nation by creating a class of warriors, demanding that citizens perform civic duties in the interest of the state, and utilizing state intervention in education to promote the development of warriors and future rulers of the state.<ref>Sharma, Urmila.

The right to colonize the neighboring [[Slovene minority in Italy (1920\u20131947)|Slovene ethnic areas]] and the Mediterranean, being inhabited by what were alleged to be less developed peoples, was justified on the grounds that Italy was allegedly suffering from overpopulation.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nBorrowing the idea first developed by [[Enrico Corradini]] before 1914 of the natural conflict between \"[[plutocratic]]\" nations like Britain and \"proletarian\" nations like Italy, Mussolini claimed that Italy's principal problem was that \"plutocratic\" countries like Britain were blocking Italy from achieving the necessary ''spazio vitale'' that would let the Italian economy grow.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|pp=48\u201350}} Mussolini equated a nation's potential for economic growth with territorial size, thus in his view the problem of poverty in Italy could only be solved by winning the necessary ''spazio vitale''.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|p=50}}\n\nThough [[biological racism]] was less prominent in Fascism than in [[National Socialism]], right from the start the ''spazio vitale'' concept had a strong racist undercurrent. Mussolini asserted there was a \"natural law\" for stronger peoples to subject and dominate \"inferior\" peoples such as the \"barbaric\" Slavic peoples of Yugoslavia.

In Mussolini's thinking, [[demography]] was destiny; nations with rising populations were nations destined to conquer; and nations with falling populations were decaying powers that deserved to die. Hence, the importance of [[natalism]] to Mussolini, since only by increasing the birth rate could Italy ensure that its future as a great power that would win its ''spazio vitale'' would be assured. By Mussolini's reckoning, the Italian population had to reach 60 million to enable Italy to fight a major war\u2014hence his relentless demands for Italian women to have more children in order to reach that number.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|p=52}}\n\nMussolini and the fascists managed to be simultaneously [[revolutionary]] and [[Traditionalist Conservatism|traditionalist]];<ref>{{cite journal |jstor= 1852268 |author= Roland Sarti |title= Fascist Modernization in Italy: Traditional or Revolutionary |date= 8 January 2008 |pages= 1029\u201345 |volume= 75 |issue= 4 |journal= The American Historical Review |doi= 10.2307/1852268}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.appstate.edu/~brantzrw/history3134/mussolini.html |publisher= Appstate.edu |title= Mussolini's Italy |date= 8 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080415145038/http://www.appstate.edu/~brantzrw/history3134/mussolini.html |archivedate= 15 April 2008}}</ref> because this was vastly different from anything else in the political climate of the time, it is sometimes described{{by whom|date=July 2016}} as \"The Third Way\".<ref>{{Cite book |last= Macdonald | first= Hamish |title= Mussolini and Italian Fascism |publisher= Nelson Thornes |url= https://books.google.com/?id=221W9vKkWrcC&pg=PT17&dq=%22third+way%22+mussolini |isbn= 978-0-7487-3386-6 |year= 1999}}</ref> The Fascisti, led by one of Mussolini's close confidants, [[Dino Grandi]], formed armed squads of war veterans called [[blackshirts]] (or ''[[Squadrismo|squadristi]]'') with the goal of restoring order to the streets of Italy with a strong hand. The blackshirts clashed with communists, socialists, and anarchists at parades and demonstrations; all of these factions were also involved in clashes against each other. The Italian government rarely interfered with the blackshirts' actions, owing in part to a looming threat and widespread fear of a communist revolution. The Fascisti grew rapidly; within two years they transformed themselves into the [[National Fascist Party]] at a congress in Rome.

On the morning of 28 October, [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]], who according to the [[Statuto Albertino|Albertine Statute]] held the supreme military power, refused the government request to declare [[martial law]], which led to Facta's resignation. The King then handed over power to Mussolini (who stayed in his headquarters in Milan during the talks) by asking him to form a new government. The King's controversial decision has been explained by historians as a combination of delusions and fears; Mussolini enjoyed wide support in the military and among the industrial and agrarian elites, while the King and the conservative establishment were afraid of a possible civil war and ultimately thought they could use Mussolini to restore law and order in the country, but failed to foresee the danger of a totalitarian evolution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lyttelton|first=Adrian|title=The Seizure of Power: Fascism in Italy, 1919\u20131929|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-55394-0|pages=75\u201377}}</ref>\n\n=== Appointment as Prime Minister ===\nAs Prime Minister, the first years of Mussolini's rule were characterized by a right-wing coalition government composed of Fascists, nationalists, liberals, and two Catholic clerics from the [[Italian People's Party (1919\u20131926)|Popular Party]]. The Fascists made up a small minority in his original governments. Mussolini's domestic goal was the eventual establishment of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state with himself as supreme leader (''[[Il Duce]]''), a message that was articulated by the Fascist newspaper ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia|Il Popolo]]'', which was now edited by Mussolini's brother, [[Arnaldo Mussolini|Arnaldo]]. To that end, Mussolini obtained from the legislature dictatorial powers for one year (legal under the Italian constitution of the time). He favored the complete restoration of state authority, with the integration of the ''Fasci di Combattimento'' into the armed forces (the foundation in January 1923 of the ''Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale'') and the progressive identification of the party with the state. In political and social economy, he passed legislation that favored the wealthy industrial and agrarian classes (privatizations, liberalizations of rent laws and dismantlement of the unions).<ref name=\"Living History 2\" />\n\nIn 1923, Mussolini sent Italian forces to invade [[Corfu]] during the [[Corfu incident]].

First, he went beyond the vague promise of future national renewal, and proved the movement could actually seize power and operate a comprehensive government in a major country along fascist lines. Second, the movement claimed to represent the entire national community, not a fragment such as the working class or the aristocracy. He made a significant effort to include the previously alienated Catholic element. He defined public roles for the main sectors of the business community rather than allowing it to operate backstage. Third, he developed a cult of one-man leadership that focused media attention and national debate on his own personality. As a former journalist, Mussolini proved highly adept at exploiting all forms of mass media, including such new forms as motion pictures and radio. Fourth, he created a mass membership party, with free programs for young men, young women, and various other groups who could therefore be more readily mobilized and monitored. He shut down all alternative political formations and parties (but this step was not an innovation by any means). Like all dictators he made liberal use of the threat of extrajudicial violence, as well as actual violence by his Blackshirts, to frighten his opposition.<ref>Konrad Jarausch, ''Out of Ashes: A new history of Europe in the 20th century'' (2015) pp. 179\u201380</ref>\n\n=== Police state ===\n{{See also|Assassination attempts on Benito Mussolini}}\n[[File:Benito Mussolini.gif|thumb|alt=Benito Mussolini seated portrait in suit and tie facing left|Mussolini in his early years in power]]\nBetween 1925 and 1927, Mussolini progressively dismantled virtually all constitutional and conventional restraints on his power and built a [[police state]]. A law passed on 24 December 1925\u2014Christmas Eve for the largely [[Roman Catholic]] country\u2014changed Mussolini's formal title from \"President of the Council of Ministers\" to \"Head of the Government\", although he was still called \"Prime Minister\" by most non-Italian news sources. He was no longer responsible to Parliament and could be removed only by the King. While the [[Statuto Albertino|Italian constitution]] stated that ministers were responsible only to the sovereign, in practice it had become all but impossible to govern against the express will of Parliament. The Christmas Eve law ended this practice, and also made Mussolini the only person competent to determine the body's agenda. This law transformed Mussolini's government into a de facto legal dictatorship. Local autonomy was abolished, and [[podest\u00e0]]s appointed by the [[Italian Senate]] replaced elected mayors and councils.\n\nOn 7 April 1926, Mussolini survived a first assassination attempt by [[Violet Gibson]], an Irish woman and daughter of [[Edward Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne|Lord Ashbourne]], who was deported after her arrest.<ref name=thetimesapr081926>The Times, Thursday, 8 April 1926; p. 12; Issue 44240; column A</ref> On 31 October 1926, 15-year-old [[Anteo Zamboni]] attempted to shoot Mussolini in Bologna.

In the same year, an electoral law abolished parliamentary elections. Instead, the [[Grand Council of Fascism]] selected a single list of candidates to be approved by [[Referendum|plebiscite]]. The Grand Council had been created five years earlier as a party body but was \"constitutionalized\" and became the highest constitutional authority in the state. On paper, the Grand Council had the power to recommend Mussolini's removal from office, and was thus theoretically the only check on his power. However, only Mussolini could summon the Grand Council and determine its agenda. To gain control of the South, especially [[Sicily]], he appointed [[Cesare Mori]] as a Prefect of the city of Palermo, with the charge of eradicating [[the Mafia]] at any price. In the telegram, Mussolini wrote to Mori:{{quote|Your Excellency has carte blanche; the authority of the State must absolutely, I repeat absolutely, be re-established in Sicily.

These harsh methods earned him the nickname of \"Iron Prefect\". In 1927, Mori's inquiries brought evidence of collusion between [[the Mafia]] and the Fascist establishment, and he was dismissed for length of service in 1929, at which time the number of murders in [[Palermo Province]] had decreased from 200 to 23.

His earliest (and one of the best known) was the ''Battle for Wheat'', by which 5,000 new farms were established and five new agricultural towns (among them [[Littoria]] and [[Sabaudia]]) on land reclaimed by draining the [[Pontine Marshes]]. In [[Sardinia]], a model agricultural town was founded and named ''Mussolinia'', but has long since been renamed [[Arborea]]. This town was the first of what Mussolini hoped would have been thousands of new agricultural settlements across the country. The Battle for Wheat diverted valuable resources to wheat production away from other more economically viable crops. Landowners grew wheat on unsuitable soil using all the advances of modern science, and although the wheat harvest increased, prices rose, consumption fell and high [[tariff]]s were imposed.<ref>Clark, Martin, ''Modern Italy'', Pearson Longman, 2008, p. 322</ref> The tariffs promoted widespread inefficiencies and the government [[subsidy|subsidies]] given to farmers pushed the country further into debt.\n\n[[File:Inaugurazione Littoria 001.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Inaugurazione Littoria with massed parade in 1932|The inauguration of Littoria in 1932]]\n\nMussolini also initiated the \"Battle for Land\", a policy based on [[land reclamation]] outlined in 1928. The initiative had a mixed success; while projects such as the draining of the Pontine Marsh in 1935 for agriculture were good for propaganda purposes, provided work for the [[unemployment|unemployed]] and allowed for great land owners to control subsidies, other areas in the Battle for Land were not very successful. This program was inconsistent with the Battle for Wheat (small plots of land were inappropriately allocated for large-scale wheat production), and the Pontine Marsh was lost during World War II. Fewer than 10,000 [[peasant]]s resettled on the redistributed land, and [[peasant]] poverty remained high. The Battle for Land initiative was abandoned in 1940.\n\nIn 1930, in the Doctrine of Fascism he wrote, \"The so-called crisis can only be settled by State action and within the orbit of the State.\"<ref>Mussolini, Benito, The Doctrine of Fascism, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1479216345}}, p. 21</ref> He tried to combat [[economic recession]] by introducing a \"Gold for the Fatherland\" initiative, encouraging the public to voluntarily donate [[gold jewelry]] to government officials in exchange for steel [[wristband]]s bearing the words \"Gold for the Fatherland\". Even [[Rachele Mussolini]] donated her wedding ring. The collected gold was melted down and turned into gold bars, which were then distributed to the [[national bank]]s.\n\nGovernment control of business was part of Mussolini's policy planning. By 1935, he claimed that three-quarters of Italian businesses were under state control. Later that year, Mussolini issued several edicts to further control the economy, e.g. forcing banks, businesses, and private citizens to surrender all foreign-issued stock and bond holdings to the Bank of Italy. In 1936, he imposed [[price control]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Carl F.

The regime promoted a lavish [[Propaganda of Fascist Italy#Personality cult|cult of personality]] centered on the figure of Mussolini. He pretended to incarnate the new fascist [[\u00dcbermensch]], promoting an aesthetic of exasperated [[Machismo|Machism]] that attributed to him quasi-divine capacities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Falasca-Zamponi|first=Simonetta|title=Fascist spectacle : the aesthetics of power in Mussolini's Italy|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-22677-7|page=67|edition=1st pbk.}}</ref> At various times after 1922, Mussolini personally took over the ministries of the interior, foreign affairs, colonies, corporations, defense, and public works. Sometimes he held as many as seven departments simultaneously, as well as the premiership. He was also head of the all-powerful Fascist Party and the armed local fascist militia, the [[Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale|MVSN]] or \"Blackshirts\", who terrorized incipient resistance in the cities and provinces. He would later form the [[OVRA]], an institutionalized [[secret police]] that carried official state support. In this way he succeeded in keeping power in his own hands and preventing the emergence of any rival.\n\nMussolini also portrayed himself as a valiant sportsman and a skilled musician. All teachers in schools and universities had to swear an oath to defend the fascist regime. Newspaper editors were all personally chosen by Mussolini, and only those in possession of a certificate of approval from the Fascist Party could practice journalism. These certificates were issued in secret; Mussolini thus skillfully created the illusion of a \"free press\". The trade unions were also deprived of any independence and were integrated into what was called the [[corporate state|\"corporative\" system]]. The aim, inspired by medieval [[guild]]s and never completely achieved, was to place all Italians in various professional organizations or ''corporations'', all under clandestine governmental control.\n\n[[File:Benito Mussolini Roman Salute.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Benito Mussolini saluting crowd|From 1925, Mussolini styled himself ''[[Il Duce]]'' (the leader)]]\nLarge sums of money were spent on highly visible public works and on international prestige projects. These included as the [[Blue Riband]] ocean liner [[SS Rex|SS ''Rex'']]; setting aeronautical records with the world's fastest [[seaplane]], the [[Macchi M.C.72]]; and the transatlantic flying boat cruise of [[Italo Balbo]], which was greeted with much fanfare in the United States when it landed in Chicago in 1933.\n\nThe principles of the [[The Doctrine of Fascism|doctrine of Fascism]] were laid down in an article by eminent philosopher [[Giovanni Gentile]] and Mussolini himself that appeared in 1932 in the ''[[Enciclopedia Italiana]]''. Mussolini always portrayed himself as an intellectual, and some historians agree.<ref>Bosworth, ''Mussolini '' pp. 58\u201359</ref> Gunther called him \"easily the best educated and most sophisticated of the dictators\", and the only national leader of 1940 who was an intellectual.{{r|gunther1940}} German historian [[Ernst Nolte]] said that \"His command of contemporary philosophy and political literature was at least as great as that of any other contemporary European political leader.\"<ref>Ernst Nolte, ''Three Faces of Fascism: Action Fran\u00e7aise, Italian Fascism, National Socialism'' (1966) p. 200</ref>\n\n=== Culture ===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}<!-- first four paragraphs have no citations -->\n[[File:Has seven 1 a.jpg|thumb|alt=Benito Mussolini being cheered by Fascist Blackshirt youth in 1935|Benito Mussolini and Fascist [[Blackshirt]] youth in 1935]]\nNationalists in the years after World War I thought of themselves as combating the liberal and domineering institutions created by [[Prime Minister of Italy|cabinets]]\u2014such as those of [[Giovanni Giolitti]], including traditional schooling. [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], a revolutionary [[cultural movement]] which would serve as a catalyst for Fascism, argued for \"a school for physical courage and patriotism\", as expressed by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] in 1919. Marinetti expressed his disdain for \"the by now prehistoric and [[Technophobia|troglodyte]] [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]] courses\", arguing for their replacement with exercise modelled on those of the [[Arditi]] soldiers (\"[learning] to advance on hands and knees in front of razing machine gun fire; to wait open-eyed for a crossbeam to move sideways over their heads etc.\"). It was in those years that the first Fascist youth wings were formed: [[Avanguardia Giovanile Fascista]] (Fascist Youth Vanguards) in 1919, and ''Gruppi Universitari Fascisti'' (Fascist University Groups) in 1922.\n\nAfter the March on Rome that brought Mussolini to power, the Fascists started considering ways to politicize Italian society, with an accent on education. Mussolini assigned former [[Arditi|ardito]] and deputy-secretary for Education [[Renato Ricci]] the task of \"reorganizing the youth from a moral and physical point of view.\" Ricci sought inspiration with [[Robert Baden-Powell]], the founder of [[Scouting]], meeting with him in England, as well as with [[Bauhaus]] artists in Germany. The [[Opera Nazionale Balilla]] was created through Mussolini's decree of 3 April 1926, and was led by Ricci for the following eleven years. It included children between the ages of 8 and 18, grouped as the Balilla and the Avanguardisti.\n\n[[File:Benito Mussolini colored.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Colorized photograph of Mussolini wearing the [[commander-in-chief]] uniform]]\nAccording to Mussolini: \"Fascist education is moral, physical, social, and military: it aims to create a complete and harmoniously developed human, a fascist one according to our views\". Mussolini structured this process taking in view the emotional side of childhood: \"Childhood and adolescence alike&nbsp;... cannot be fed solely by concerts, theories, and abstract teaching. The truth we aim to teach them should appeal foremost to their fantasy, to their hearts, and only then to their minds\".\n\nThe \"educational value set through action and example\" was to replace the established approaches. Fascism opposed its version of [[idealism]] to prevalent [[rationalism]], and used the Opera Nazionale Balilla to circumvent educational tradition by imposing the collective and hierarchy, as well as Mussolini's own [[Cult of personality|personality cult]].\n\nAnother important constituent of the Fascist cultural policy was [[Roman Catholicism]]. In 1929, a concordat with the [[Holy See|Vatican]] was signed, ending decades of struggle between the Italian state and the [[Papacy]] that dated back to the 1870 takeover of the [[Papal States]] by the [[House of Savoy]] during the [[unification of Italy]]. The [[Lateran treaties]], by which the Italian state was at last recognized by the Roman Catholic Church, and the independence of Vatican City was recognized by the Italian state, were so much appreciated by the ecclesiastic hierarchy that Pope [[Pius XI]] acclaimed Mussolini as \"the Man of Providence\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Fattorini|first=Emma|title=Hitler, Mussolini and the Vatican: Pope Pius XI and the speech that was never made|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-7456-4488-2|page=xi|edition=[English edition]}}</ref>\n\nThe 1929 treaty included a legal provision whereby the Italian government would protect the honor and dignity of the Pope by prosecuting offenders.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN1944220320080919 Comic escapes prosecution for insulting pope (Oddly Enough) Reuters], (Friday 19 September 2008 1:15&nbsp;pm EDT) By Phil Stewart</ref> In 1927, Mussolini was re-[[baptism|baptized]] by a Roman Catholic priest. After 1929, Mussolini, with his anti-Communist doctrines, convinced many Catholics to actively support him.\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\nIn foreign policy, Mussolini was pragmatic and opportunistic. At the center of his vision lay the dream to forge a new [[Roman Empire]] in Africa and the [[Balkans]], vindicating the so-called \"[[mutilated victory]]\" of 1918 imposed by the \"plutodemocracies\" (Britain and France) that betrayed the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] and usurped the supposed \"natural right\" of Italy to achieve supremacy in the Mediterranean basin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burgwyn|first=H.

In the 1920s, Italy's foreign policy was based on the traditional idea of Italy maintaining \"equidistant\" stance from all the major powers in order to exercise \"determinant weight\", which by whatever power Italy chose to align with would decisively change the balance of power in Europe, and the price of such an alignment would be support for Italian ambitions in Europe and Africa.<ref>Kallis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 pp. 129 & 141</ref> In the meantime, since for Mussolini demography was destiny, he carried out relentless natalist policies designed to increase the birthrate; for example, in 1924 making advocating or giving information about contraception a criminal offense, and in 1926 ordering every Italian woman to double the number of children that they were willing to bear.<ref>Strang, Bruce ''On the Fiery March'', New York: Praeger, 2003 p. 27.</ref> For Mussolini, Italy's current population of 40 million was insufficient to fight a major war, and he needed to increase the population to at least 60 million Italians before he would be ready for war.<ref>Strang, Bruce ''On the Fiery March'', New York: Praeger, 2003 p. 26.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mussolini truppe Etiopia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Mussolini inspecting troops during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italo-Ethiopian War]]]]\nIn his early years in power, Mussolini operated as a pragmatic statesman, trying to achieve some advantages, but never at the risk of war with Britain and France. An exception was the bombardment and occupation of [[Corfu]] in 1923, following an [[Corfu incident|incident]] in which Italian military personnel charged by the [[League of Nations]] to settle a boundary dispute between Greece and Albania were assassinated by bandits; the nationality of the bandits remains unclear. At the time of the Corfu incident, Mussolini was prepared to go to war with Britain, and only desperate pleading by the Italian Navy leadership, who argued that the Italian Navy was no match for the British Royal Navy, persuaded Mussolini to accept a diplomatic solution.<ref name=\"Sullivan pp. 178\u2013203\">Sullivan, Barry \"More than meets the eye: the Ethiopian War and the Origins of the Second World War\" pp. 178\u2013203 from ''The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered A.J.P.

In 1929, Mussolini ordered his Army General Staff to begin planning for aggression against France and Yugoslavia.<ref name=\"Sullivan pp. 178\u2013203\"/> In July 1932, Mussolini sent a message to German Defense Minister General [[Kurt von Schleicher]], suggesting an anti-French Italo-German alliance, an offer Schleicher responded to favorably, albeit with the condition that Germany needed to rearm first.<ref name=\"Sullivan pp. 178\u2013203\"/> In late 1932\u2013early 1933, Mussolini planned to launch a surprise attack against both France and Yugoslavia that was to begin in August 1933.<ref name=\"Sullivan pp. 178\u2013203\"/> Mussolini's planned war of 1933 was only stopped when he learned that the French ''[[Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau]]'' had broken the Italian military codes, and that the French, being forewarned of all the Italian plans, were well prepared for the Italian attack.<ref name=\"Sullivan pp. 178\u2013203\"/>\n\nAfter [[Adolf Hitler]] came into power, threatening Italian interests in Austria and the Danube basin, Mussolini proposed the [[Four Power Pact]] with Britain, France and Germany in 1933. When the Austrian 'austro-fascist' Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss#Assassination|Engelbert Dollfuss]] with dictatorial power was assassinated on 25 July 1934 by National-Socialist supporters, Mussolini even threatened Germany with war in the event of a German invasion of Austria. Mussolini for a period of time continued strictly opposing any German attempt to obtain [[Anschluss]] and promoted the ephemeral [[Stresa Front]] against Germany in 1935.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R69173, M\u00fcnchener Abkommen, Staatschefs.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=group portrait Edward Chamberlain, \u00c9douard Daladier, Adolf Hitler, Mussolini, and Count Ciano, as they prepared to sign the Munich Agreement|From left to right:\n[[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]], [[\u00c9douard Daladier|Daladier]], Hitler, Mussolini, and Italian Foreign Minister [[Count Ciano]], as they prepare to sign the [[Munich Agreement]]]]\nDespite Mussolini's imprisonment for opposing the Italo-Turkish War in Africa as \"nationalist [[delirium tremens]]\" and \"a miserable war of conquest\",{{r|gunther1940}} after the [[Abyssinia Crisis]] of 1935\u20131936, in the [[Second Italo\u2013Ethiopian War]] Italy invaded [[Ethiopia]] following border incidents occasioned by Italian inclusions over the vaguely drawn border between Ethiopia and [[Italian Somaliland]]. Historians are still divided about the reasons for the attack on Ethiopia in 1935.

Mussolini's new regime faced numerous territorial losses: in addition to losing the Italian lands held by the Allies and Badoglio's government, the provinces of [[South Tyrol|Bolzano]], [[Province of Belluno|Belluno]] and [[Trentino|Trento]] were placed under German administration in the [[Operational Zone of the Alpine Foothills]], while the provinces of [[Friuli|Udine]], [[Gorizia and Gradisca|Gorizia]], [[Province of Trieste|Trieste]], [[Istria|Pola]] (now Pula), [[Rijeka|Fiume]] (now Rijeka) and [[Province of Ljubljana|Ljubljana]] (Lubiana in Italian) were incorporated into the German [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral]].<ref name=\"Speer\">{{cite book|last1=Speer|first1=Albert|title=Inside the Third Reich|date=1995|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-1842127353|pages=420\u201321}}</ref><ref>A copy of an existing document is available online.

One of those executed was his son-in-law, [[Galeazzo Ciano]]. As Head of State and Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Italian Social Republic, Mussolini used much of his time to write his memoirs. Along with his autobiographical writings of 1928, these writings would be combined and published by [[Da Capo Press]] as ''My Rise and Fall''. In an interview in January 1945 by Madeleine Mollier, a few months before he was captured and executed by Italian anti-fascist partisans, he stated flatly: \"Seven years ago, I was an interesting person.

This was done both to discourage any Fascists from continuing the fight, and as an act of revenge for the hanging of many partisans in the same place by Axis authorities. The corpse of the deposed leader was subject to ridicule and abuse.

Starace, who once said of Mussolini \"He is a god,\"<ref>Quoted in \"Mussolini: A New Life\", p. 276 by Nicholas Burgess Farrell. 2004</ref> saluted what was left of his leader just before he was shot. The body of Starace was subsequently hung up next to that of Mussolini.\n\nAfter his death and the display of his corpse in Milan, Mussolini was buried in an unmarked grave in the [[Cimitero Maggiore di Milano|Musocco]] cemetery, to the north of the city. On [[Easter Sunday]] 1946, his body was located and dug up by [[Domenico Leccisi]] and two other [[neo-fascism|neo-Fascists]].\n\nOn the loose for months\u2014and a cause of great anxiety to the new Italian democracy\u2014Mussolini's body was finally \"recaptured\" in August, hidden in a small trunk at the [[Certosa di Pavia]], just outside Milan. Two [[Franciscan Order|Fransciscan]] brothers were subsequently charged with concealing the corpse, though it was discovered on further investigation that it had been constantly on the move. Unsure what to do, the authorities held the remains in a kind of political limbo for ten years, before agreeing to allow them to be re-interred at [[Predappio]] in [[Romagna]], his birthplace. [[Adone Zoli]], the then-current prime minister, contacted [[Rachele Mussolini|Donna Rachele]], the dictator's widow, to tell her he was returning the remains, as he needed the support of the far-right in parliament, including Leccisi himself. In Predappio the dictator was buried in a crypt (the only posthumous honor granted to Mussolini).

The couple had a son the following year and named him Benito Albino Mussolini. In December 1915, Mussolini married [[Rachele Mussolini|Rachele Guidi]], who had been his mistress since 1910. Due to his upcoming political ascendency, the information about his first marriage was suppressed, and both his first wife and son were later persecuted.<ref name=\"timeswife\"/> With Rachele, Mussolini had two daughters, [[Edda Mussolini|Edda]] (1910\u20131995) and Anna Maria (1929\u20131968), the latter of whom married in [[Ravenna]] on 11 June 1960 to Nando Pucci Negri; and three sons: [[Vittorio Mussolini|Vittorio]] (1916\u20131997), [[Bruno Mussolini|Bruno]] (1918\u20131941) and [[Romano Mussolini|Romano]] (1927\u20132006).

After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes,<ref name=Haugen_p9_71>[[#Haugen|Haugen]], pp. 9, 71</ref> Mussolini and his followers consolidated their power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a [[one-party state|one-party dictatorship]]. Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and extraordinary means and aspired to create a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state. In 1929, Mussolini signed the [[Lateran Treaty]] with the Vatican, ending decades of struggle between the Italian state and the Papacy, and recognized the independence of [[Vatican City]].\n\nMussolini's foreign policy aimed to expand the sphere of influence of [[Italian fascism]]. In 1923, he began the \"[[Pacification of Libya]]\" and [[Corfu incident|ordered the bombing of Corfu]] in retaliation for the murder of an Italian general. In 1936, Mussolini formed [[Italian East Africa]] (AOI) by merging [[Eritrea]], [[Italian Somaliland|Somalia]] and [[Ethiopia]] following the [[Abyssinian crisis]] and the [[Second Italo\u2013Ethiopian War]]. In 1939, Italian forces occupied [[Albania]]. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered the successful [[Italian military intervention in Spain]] in favor of [[Francisco Franco]] during the [[Spanish civil war]]. At the same time, Mussolini's Italy tried to avoid the outbreak of a second global war and took part in the [[Stresa front]], the [[Lytton Report]], the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the [[Four-Power Pact]] and the [[Munich Agreement]]. However, Italy distanced Britain and France by forming the [[axis powers]] with Germany and Japan. Germany [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, resulting in declarations of war by France and the UK and the start of [[World War II]].\n\nOn 10 June 1940\u2014with the [[Fall of France]] imminent\u2014Italy officially entered the war and eventually occupied [[Italian occupation of France|parts of south-east France]], [[Italian occupation of Corsica|Corsica]], and [[Tunisian campaign|Tunisia]]. Mussolini planned to concentrate Italian forces on a major offensive against the [[British Empire]] in Africa and the Middle East, known as the \"parallel war\", while expecting the collapse of the UK in the [[European theatre of world war II|European theatre]]. The Italians [[Italian invasion of Egypt|invaded Egypt]], [[Italian bombing of Mandatory Palestine in World War II|bombed Mandatory Palestine]], and [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|occupied British Somaliland]] with initial success. However, the British government refused to accept proposals for a peace that would involve accepting [[Axis Powers|Axis]] victories in Eastern and Western Europe; plans for an invasion of the UK did not proceed and the war continued. In October 1940, Mussolini sent Italian forces into Greece, starting the [[Greco-Italian War]]. The [[Royal Air force]] prevented the Italian invasion and allowed the Greeks to push the Italians back to Albania.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=IoIlDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT85&dq=Italian+forces+in+Greece+british+air+force#v=onepage&q=Italian%20forces%20in%20Greece%20british%20air%20force&f=false |title = The Desert Air Force in World War II: Air Power in the Western Desert, 1940-1942|isbn = 9781526703798|last1 = Delve|first1 = Ken Delve|date = 31 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkan campaign]] was significantly prolonged until the definition of the [[Axis occupation of Greece]] and [[Occupation of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

As a consequence, early on 25 July, the [[Grand Council of Fascism]] passed a motion of no confidence in Mussolini; later that day [[Victor Emmanuel III|the King]] dismissed him as [[head of government]] and had him placed in custody, appointing [[Pietro Badoglio]] to succeed him as Prime Minister.\n\nAfter the king agreed the armistice with the allies, on 12 September 1943 Mussolini was rescued from captivity in the [[Gran Sasso raid]] by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|paratroopers]] and ''[[Waffen-SS]]'' [[commando]]s led by Major [[Harald Mors|Otto-Harald Mors]].

He was influenced by [[Anti-Austrian sentiment|anti-Austrian]] Italian nationalist sentiments, believing that the war offered Italians in Austria-Hungary the chance to liberate themselves from rule of the [[Hapsburg|Habsburgs]]. He eventually decided to declare support for the war by appealing to the need for socialists to overthrow the [[Hohenzollern]] and Habsburg monarchies in Germany and Austria-Hungary who he said had consistently repressed socialism.<ref name=\"Emile Ludwig 1969. p. 321\">Emil Ludwig.

He argued that the fall of Hohenzollern and Habsburg monarchies and the repression of \"reactionary\" Turkey would create conditions beneficial for the working class. While he was supportive of the Entente powers, Mussolini responded to the conservative nature of [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]] by stating that the mobilization required for the war would undermine Russia's reactionary authoritarianism and the war would bring Russia to social revolution. He said that for Italy the war would complete the process of ''[[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]'' by uniting the Italians in Austria-Hungary into Italy and by allowing the common people of Italy to be participating members of the Italian nation in what would be Italy's first national war. Thus he claimed that the vast social changes that the war could offer meant that it should be supported as a revolutionary war.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=189}}\n\nAs Mussolini's support for the intervention solidified, he came into conflict with socialists who opposed the war. He attacked the opponents of the war and claimed that those proletarians who supported [[pacifism]] were out of step with the proletarians who had joined the rising interventionist [[Vanguardism|vanguard]] that was preparing Italy for a revolutionary war. He began to criticize the Italian Socialist Party and socialism itself for having failed to recognize the national problems that had led to the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=191}} He was expelled from the party for his support of intervention.\n\nThe following excerpts are from a police report prepared by the Inspector-General of Public Security in Milan, G. Gasti, that describe his background and his position on the First World War that resulted in his ousting from the Italian Socialist Party. The Inspector General wrote:\n{{bquote|Professor Benito Mussolini,&nbsp;... 38, revolutionary socialist, has a police record; elementary school teacher qualified to teach in secondary schools; former first secretary of the Chambers in Cesena, Forl\u00ec, and Ravenna; after 1912 editor of the newspaper ''Avanti!'' to which he gave a violent suggestive and intransigent orientation. In October 1914, finding himself in opposition to the directorate of the Italian Socialist party because he advocated a kind of active neutrality on the part of Italy in the War of the Nations against the party's tendency of absolute neutrality, he withdrew on the twentieth of that month from the directorate of ''Avanti!'' Then on the fifteenth of November [1914], thereafter, he initiated publication of the newspaper ''Il Popolo d'Italia'', in which he supported\u2014in sharp contrast to ''Avanti!'' and amid bitter polemics against that newspaper and its chief backers\u2014the thesis of Italian intervention in the war against the militarism of the Central Empires. For this reason he was accused of moral and political unworthiness and the party thereupon decided to expel him&nbsp;... Thereafter he&nbsp;... undertook a very active campaign in behalf of Italian intervention, participating in demonstrations in the piazzas and writing quite violent articles in Popolo d'Italia&nbsp;...<ref name=\"Mediterranean4\" />}}\n\nIn his summary, the Inspector also noted:\n{{bquote|He was the ideal editor of ''Avanti!'' for the Socialists. In that line of work he was greatly esteemed and beloved. Some of his former comrades and admirers still confess that there was no one who understood better how to interpret the spirit of the proletariat and there was no one who did not observe his apostasy with sorrow. This came about not for reasons of self-interest or money. He was a sincere and passionate advocate, first of vigilant and armed neutrality, and later of war; and he did not believe that he was compromising with his personal and political honesty by making use of every means\u2014no matter where they came from or wherever he might obtain them\u2014to pay for his newspaper, his program and his line of action. This was his initial line. It is difficult to say to what extent his socialist convictions (which he never either openly or privately abjure) may have been sacrificed in the course of the indispensable financial deals which were necessary for the continuation of the struggle in which he was engaged&nbsp;... But assuming these modifications did take place&nbsp;... he always wanted to give the appearance of still being a socialist, and he fooled himself into thinking that this was the case.<ref>''Mediterranean Fascism 1919\u20131945'' Edited by Charles F.

We used to believe that the concept was totally without substance. Instead we see the nation arise as a palpitating reality before us!&nbsp;... Class cannot destroy the nation.

He no longer advocated a proletarian vanguard, but instead a vanguard led by dynamic and revolutionary people of any social class.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=192}}\nThough he denounced orthodox socialism and class conflict, he maintained at the time that he was a nationalist socialist and a supporter of the legacy of nationalist socialists in Italy's history, such as [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], and [[Carlo Pisacane]]. As for the Italian Socialist Party and its support of orthodox socialism, he claimed that his failure as a member of the party to revitalize and transform it to recognize the contemporary reality revealed the hopelessness of orthodox socialism as outdated and a failure.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=193}} This perception of the failure of orthodox socialism in the light of the outbreak of World War I was not solely held by Mussolini; other pro-interventionist Italian socialists such as [[Filippo Corridoni]] and [[Sergio Panunzio]] had also denounced classical [[Marxism]] in favor of intervention.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=195}}\n\n[[File:Mussolini bersagliere.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Mussolini as a ''[[bersagliere]]'' during WWI]]\n\nThese basic political views and principles formed the basis of Mussolini's newly formed political movement, the ''Fasci Rivoluzionari d'Azione Internazionalista'' in 1914, who called themselves ''Fascisti'' (Fascists).{{sfn|Gregor|1979|pp=193, 195}} At this time, the Fascists did not have an integrated set of policies and the movement was small, ineffective in its attempts to hold mass meetings, and was regularly harassed by government authorities and orthodox socialists.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|pp=195\u201396}} Antagonism between the interventionists, including the Fascists, versus the anti-interventionist orthodox socialists resulted in violence between the Fascists and socialists. The opposition and attacks by the anti-interventionist revolutionary socialists against the Fascists and other interventionists were so violent that even [[democratic socialist]]s who opposed the war such as [[Anna Kuliscioff]] said that the Italian Socialist Party had gone too far in a campaign of silencing the freedom of speech of supporters of the war. These early hostilities between the Fascists and the revolutionary socialists shaped Mussolini's conception of the nature of Fascism in its support of political violence.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=196}}\n\nMussolini became an ally with the [[Irredentism|irredentist]] politician and journalist [[Cesare Battisti (politician)|Cesare Battisti]] and\u2014like him\u2014entered the Army and served in the war. \"He was sent to the zone of operations where he was seriously injured by the explosion of a grenade.\"<ref name=\"Mediterranean4\"/>\n\nThe Inspector General continued:\n{{bquote|He was promoted to the rank of corporal \"for merit in war\".

Mussolini asserted there was a \"natural law\" for stronger peoples to subject and dominate \"inferior\" peoples such as the \"barbaric\" Slavic peoples of Yugoslavia. He stated in a September 1920 speech: {{quote|When dealing with such a race as Slavic\u2014inferior and barbarian\u2014we must not pursue the carrot, but the stick policy&nbsp;...

In Mussolini's thinking, [[demography]] was destiny; nations with rising populations were nations destined to conquer; and nations with falling populations were decaying powers that deserved to die. Hence, the importance of [[natalism]] to Mussolini, since only by increasing the birth rate could Italy ensure that its future as a great power that would win its ''spazio vitale'' would be assured. By Mussolini's reckoning, the Italian population had to reach 60 million to enable Italy to fight a major war\u2014hence his relentless demands for Italian women to have more children in order to reach that number.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|p=52}}\n\nMussolini and the fascists managed to be simultaneously [[revolutionary]] and [[Traditionalist Conservatism|traditionalist]];<ref>{{cite journal |jstor= 1852268 |author= Roland Sarti |title= Fascist Modernization in Italy: Traditional or Revolutionary |date= 8 January 2008 |pages= 1029\u201345 |volume= 75 |issue= 4 |journal= The American Historical Review |doi= 10.2307/1852268}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.appstate.edu/~brantzrw/history3134/mussolini.html |publisher= Appstate.edu |title= Mussolini's Italy |date= 8 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080415145038/http://www.appstate.edu/~brantzrw/history3134/mussolini.html |archivedate= 15 April 2008}}</ref> because this was vastly different from anything else in the political climate of the time, it is sometimes described{{by whom|date=July 2016}} as \"The Third Way\".<ref>{{Cite book |last= Macdonald | first= Hamish |title= Mussolini and Italian Fascism |publisher= Nelson Thornes |url= https://books.google.com/?id=221W9vKkWrcC&pg=PT17&dq=%22third+way%22+mussolini |isbn= 978-0-7487-3386-6 |year= 1999}}</ref> The Fascisti, led by one of Mussolini's close confidants, [[Dino Grandi]], formed armed squads of war veterans called [[blackshirts]] (or ''[[Squadrismo|squadristi]]'') with the goal of restoring order to the streets of Italy with a strong hand. The blackshirts clashed with communists, socialists, and anarchists at parades and demonstrations; all of these factions were also involved in clashes against each other. The Italian government rarely interfered with the blackshirts' actions, owing in part to a looming threat and widespread fear of a communist revolution. The Fascisti grew rapidly; within two years they transformed themselves into the [[National Fascist Party]] at a congress in Rome.

On the morning of 28 October, [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]], who according to the [[Statuto Albertino|Albertine Statute]] held the supreme military power, refused the government request to declare [[martial law]], which led to Facta's resignation. The King then handed over power to Mussolini (who stayed in his headquarters in Milan during the talks) by asking him to form a new government. The King's controversial decision has been explained by historians as a combination of delusions and fears; Mussolini enjoyed wide support in the military and among the industrial and agrarian elites, while the King and the conservative establishment were afraid of a possible civil war and ultimately thought they could use Mussolini to restore law and order in the country, but failed to foresee the danger of a totalitarian evolution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lyttelton|first=Adrian|title=The Seizure of Power: Fascism in Italy, 1919\u20131929|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-55394-0|pages=75\u201377}}</ref>\n\n=== Appointment as Prime Minister ===\nAs Prime Minister, the first years of Mussolini's rule were characterized by a right-wing coalition government composed of Fascists, nationalists, liberals, and two Catholic clerics from the [[Italian People's Party (1919\u20131926)|Popular Party]]. The Fascists made up a small minority in his original governments. Mussolini's domestic goal was the eventual establishment of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state with himself as supreme leader (''[[Il Duce]]''), a message that was articulated by the Fascist newspaper ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia|Il Popolo]]'', which was now edited by Mussolini's brother, [[Arnaldo Mussolini|Arnaldo]]. To that end, Mussolini obtained from the legislature dictatorial powers for one year (legal under the Italian constitution of the time). He favored the complete restoration of state authority, with the integration of the ''Fasci di Combattimento'' into the armed forces (the foundation in January 1923 of the ''Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale'') and the progressive identification of the party with the state. In political and social economy, he passed legislation that favored the wealthy industrial and agrarian classes (privatizations, liberalizations of rent laws and dismantlement of the unions).<ref name=\"Living History 2\" />\n\nIn 1923, Mussolini sent Italian forces to invade [[Corfu]] during the [[Corfu incident]].

First, he went beyond the vague promise of future national renewal, and proved the movement could actually seize power and operate a comprehensive government in a major country along fascist lines. Second, the movement claimed to represent the entire national community, not a fragment such as the working class or the aristocracy. He made a significant effort to include the previously alienated Catholic element. He defined public roles for the main sectors of the business community rather than allowing it to operate backstage. Third, he developed a cult of one-man leadership that focused media attention and national debate on his own personality. As a former journalist, Mussolini proved highly adept at exploiting all forms of mass media, including such new forms as motion pictures and radio. Fourth, he created a mass membership party, with free programs for young men, young women, and various other groups who could therefore be more readily mobilized and monitored. He shut down all alternative political formations and parties (but this step was not an innovation by any means). Like all dictators he made liberal use of the threat of extrajudicial violence, as well as actual violence by his Blackshirts, to frighten his opposition.<ref>Konrad Jarausch, ''Out of Ashes: A new history of Europe in the 20th century'' (2015) pp. 179\u201380</ref>\n\n=== Police state ===\n{{See also|Assassination attempts on Benito Mussolini}}\n[[File:Benito Mussolini.gif|thumb|alt=Benito Mussolini seated portrait in suit and tie facing left|Mussolini in his early years in power]]\nBetween 1925 and 1927, Mussolini progressively dismantled virtually all constitutional and conventional restraints on his power and built a [[police state]]. A law passed on 24 December 1925\u2014Christmas Eve for the largely [[Roman Catholic]] country\u2014changed Mussolini's formal title from \"President of the Council of Ministers\" to \"Head of the Government\", although he was still called \"Prime Minister\" by most non-Italian news sources. He was no longer responsible to Parliament and could be removed only by the King. While the [[Statuto Albertino|Italian constitution]] stated that ministers were responsible only to the sovereign, in practice it had become all but impossible to govern against the express will of Parliament. The Christmas Eve law ended this practice, and also made Mussolini the only person competent to determine the body's agenda. This law transformed Mussolini's government into a de facto legal dictatorship. Local autonomy was abolished, and [[podest\u00e0]]s appointed by the [[Italian Senate]] replaced elected mayors and councils.\n\nOn 7 April 1926, Mussolini survived a first assassination attempt by [[Violet Gibson]], an Irish woman and daughter of [[Edward Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne|Lord Ashbourne]], who was deported after her arrest.<ref name=thetimesapr081926>The Times, Thursday, 8 April 1926; p. 12; Issue 44240; column A</ref> On 31 October 1926, 15-year-old [[Anteo Zamboni]] attempted to shoot Mussolini in Bologna.

In the same year, an electoral law abolished parliamentary elections. Instead, the [[Grand Council of Fascism]] selected a single list of candidates to be approved by [[Referendum|plebiscite]]. The Grand Council had been created five years earlier as a party body but was \"constitutionalized\" and became the highest constitutional authority in the state. On paper, the Grand Council had the power to recommend Mussolini's removal from office, and was thus theoretically the only check on his power. However, only Mussolini could summon the Grand Council and determine its agenda. To gain control of the South, especially [[Sicily]], he appointed [[Cesare Mori]] as a Prefect of the city of Palermo, with the charge of eradicating [[the Mafia]] at any price. In the telegram, Mussolini wrote to Mori:{{quote|Your Excellency has carte blanche; the authority of the State must absolutely, I repeat absolutely, be re-established in Sicily.

These harsh methods earned him the nickname of \"Iron Prefect\".

His earliest (and one of the best known) was the ''Battle for Wheat'', by which 5,000 new farms were established and five new agricultural towns (among them [[Littoria]] and [[Sabaudia]]) on land reclaimed by draining the [[Pontine Marshes]]. In [[Sardinia]], a model agricultural town was founded and named ''Mussolinia'', but has long since been renamed [[Arborea]]. This town was the first of what Mussolini hoped would have been thousands of new agricultural settlements across the country. The Battle for Wheat diverted valuable resources to wheat production away from other more economically viable crops. Landowners grew wheat on unsuitable soil using all the advances of modern science, and although the wheat harvest increased, prices rose, consumption fell and high [[tariff]]s were imposed.<ref>Clark, Martin, ''Modern Italy'', Pearson Longman, 2008, p. 322</ref> The tariffs promoted widespread inefficiencies and the government [[subsidy|subsidies]] given to farmers pushed the country further into debt.\n\n[[File:Inaugurazione Littoria 001.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Inaugurazione Littoria with massed parade in 1932|The inauguration of Littoria in 1932]]\n\nMussolini also initiated the \"Battle for Land\", a policy based on [[land reclamation]] outlined in 1928. The initiative had a mixed success; while projects such as the draining of the Pontine Marsh in 1935 for agriculture were good for propaganda purposes, provided work for the [[unemployment|unemployed]] and allowed for great land owners to control subsidies, other areas in the Battle for Land were not very successful. This program was inconsistent with the Battle for Wheat (small plots of land were inappropriately allocated for large-scale wheat production), and the Pontine Marsh was lost during World War II. Fewer than 10,000 [[peasant]]s resettled on the redistributed land, and [[peasant]] poverty remained high. The Battle for Land initiative was abandoned in 1940.\n\nIn 1930, in the Doctrine of Fascism he wrote, \"The so-called crisis can only be settled by State action and within the orbit of the State.\"<ref>Mussolini, Benito, The Doctrine of Fascism, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1479216345}}, p. 21</ref> He tried to combat [[economic recession]] by introducing a \"Gold for the Fatherland\" initiative, encouraging the public to voluntarily donate [[gold jewelry]] to government officials in exchange for steel [[wristband]]s bearing the words \"Gold for the Fatherland\". Even [[Rachele Mussolini]] donated her wedding ring. The collected gold was melted down and turned into gold bars, which were then distributed to the [[national bank]]s.\n\nGovernment control of business was part of Mussolini's policy planning. By 1935, he claimed that three-quarters of Italian businesses were under state control.

The regime promoted a lavish [[Propaganda of Fascist Italy#Personality cult|cult of personality]] centered on the figure of Mussolini. He pretended to incarnate the new fascist [[\u00dcbermensch]], promoting an aesthetic of exasperated [[Machismo|Machism]] that attributed to him quasi-divine capacities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Falasca-Zamponi|first=Simonetta|title=Fascist spectacle : the aesthetics of power in Mussolini's Italy|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-22677-7|page=67|edition=1st pbk.}}</ref> At various times after 1922, Mussolini personally took over the ministries of the interior, foreign affairs, colonies, corporations, defense, and public works. Sometimes he held as many as seven departments simultaneously, as well as the premiership. He was also head of the all-powerful Fascist Party and the armed local fascist militia, the [[Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale|MVSN]] or \"Blackshirts\", who terrorized incipient resistance in the cities and provinces. He would later form the [[OVRA]], an institutionalized [[secret police]] that carried official state support. In this way he succeeded in keeping power in his own hands and preventing the emergence of any rival.\n\nMussolini also portrayed himself as a valiant sportsman and a skilled musician. All teachers in schools and universities had to swear an oath to defend the fascist regime. Newspaper editors were all personally chosen by Mussolini, and only those in possession of a certificate of approval from the Fascist Party could practice journalism. These certificates were issued in secret; Mussolini thus skillfully created the illusion of a \"free press\". The trade unions were also deprived of any independence and were integrated into what was called the [[corporate state|\"corporative\" system]]. The aim, inspired by medieval [[guild]]s and never completely achieved, was to place all Italians in various professional organizations or ''corporations'', all under clandestine governmental control.\n\n[[File:Benito Mussolini Roman Salute.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Benito Mussolini saluting crowd|From 1925, Mussolini styled himself ''[[Il Duce]]'' (the leader)]]\nLarge sums of money were spent on highly visible public works and on international prestige projects. These included as the [[Blue Riband]] ocean liner [[SS Rex|SS ''Rex'']]; setting aeronautical records with the world's fastest [[seaplane]], the [[Macchi M.C.72]]; and the transatlantic flying boat cruise of [[Italo Balbo]], which was greeted with much fanfare in the United States when it landed in Chicago in 1933.\n\nThe principles of the [[The Doctrine of Fascism|doctrine of Fascism]] were laid down in an article by eminent philosopher [[Giovanni Gentile]] and Mussolini himself that appeared in 1932 in the ''[[Enciclopedia Italiana]]''. Mussolini always portrayed himself as an intellectual, and some historians agree.<ref>Bosworth, ''Mussolini '' pp. 58\u201359</ref> Gunther called him \"easily the best educated and most sophisticated of the dictators\", and the only national leader of 1940 who was an intellectual.{{r|gunther1940}} German historian [[Ernst Nolte]] said that \"His command of contemporary philosophy and political literature was at least as great as that of any other contemporary European political leader.\"<ref>Ernst Nolte, ''Three Faces of Fascism: Action Fran\u00e7aise, Italian Fascism, National Socialism'' (1966) p. 200</ref>\n\n=== Culture ===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}<!-- first four paragraphs have no citations -->\n[[File:Has seven 1 a.jpg|thumb|alt=Benito Mussolini being cheered by Fascist Blackshirt youth in 1935|Benito Mussolini and Fascist [[Blackshirt]] youth in 1935]]\nNationalists in the years after World War I thought of themselves as combating the liberal and domineering institutions created by [[Prime Minister of Italy|cabinets]]\u2014such as those of [[Giovanni Giolitti]], including traditional schooling. [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], a revolutionary [[cultural movement]] which would serve as a catalyst for Fascism, argued for \"a school for physical courage and patriotism\", as expressed by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] in 1919. Marinetti expressed his disdain for \"the by now prehistoric and [[Technophobia|troglodyte]] [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]] courses\", arguing for their replacement with exercise modelled on those of the [[Arditi]] soldiers (\"[learning] to advance on hands and knees in front of razing machine gun fire; to wait open-eyed for a crossbeam to move sideways over their heads etc.\"). It was in those years that the first Fascist youth wings were formed: [[Avanguardia Giovanile Fascista]] (Fascist Youth Vanguards) in 1919, and ''Gruppi Universitari Fascisti'' (Fascist University Groups) in 1922.\n\nAfter the March on Rome that brought Mussolini to power, the Fascists started considering ways to politicize Italian society, with an accent on education. Mussolini assigned former [[Arditi|ardito]] and deputy-secretary for Education [[Renato Ricci]] the task of \"reorganizing the youth from a moral and physical point of view.\" Ricci sought inspiration with [[Robert Baden-Powell]], the founder of [[Scouting]], meeting with him in England, as well as with [[Bauhaus]] artists in Germany. The [[Opera Nazionale Balilla]] was created through Mussolini's decree of 3 April 1926, and was led by Ricci for the following eleven years. It included children between the ages of 8 and 18, grouped as the Balilla and the Avanguardisti.\n\n[[File:Benito Mussolini colored.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Colorized photograph of Mussolini wearing the [[commander-in-chief]] uniform]]\nAccording to Mussolini: \"Fascist education is moral, physical, social, and military: it aims to create a complete and harmoniously developed human, a fascist one according to our views\". Mussolini structured this process taking in view the emotional side of childhood: \"Childhood and adolescence alike&nbsp;... cannot be fed solely by concerts, theories, and abstract teaching. The truth we aim to teach them should appeal foremost to their fantasy, to their hearts, and only then to their minds\".\n\nThe \"educational value set through action and example\" was to replace the established approaches. Fascism opposed its version of [[idealism]] to prevalent [[rationalism]], and used the Opera Nazionale Balilla to circumvent educational tradition by imposing the collective and hierarchy, as well as Mussolini's own [[Cult of personality|personality cult]].\n\nAnother important constituent of the Fascist cultural policy was [[Roman Catholicism]]. In 1929, a concordat with the [[Holy See|Vatican]] was signed, ending decades of struggle between the Italian state and the [[Papacy]] that dated back to the 1870 takeover of the [[Papal States]] by the [[House of Savoy]] during the [[unification of Italy]]. The [[Lateran treaties]], by which the Italian state was at last recognized by the Roman Catholic Church, and the independence of Vatican City was recognized by the Italian state, were so much appreciated by the ecclesiastic hierarchy that Pope [[Pius XI]] acclaimed Mussolini as \"the Man of Providence\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Fattorini|first=Emma|title=Hitler, Mussolini and the Vatican: Pope Pius XI and the speech that was never made|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-7456-4488-2|page=xi|edition=[English edition]}}</ref>\n\nThe 1929 treaty included a legal provision whereby the Italian government would protect the honor and dignity of the Pope by prosecuting offenders.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN1944220320080919 Comic escapes prosecution for insulting pope (Oddly Enough) Reuters], (Friday 19 September 2008 1:15&nbsp;pm EDT) By Phil Stewart</ref> In 1927, Mussolini was re-[[baptism|baptized]] by a Roman Catholic priest. After 1929, Mussolini, with his anti-Communist doctrines, convinced many Catholics to actively support him.\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\nIn foreign policy, Mussolini was pragmatic and opportunistic. At the center of his vision lay the dream to forge a new [[Roman Empire]] in Africa and the [[Balkans]], vindicating the so-called \"[[mutilated victory]]\" of 1918 imposed by the \"plutodemocracies\" (Britain and France) that betrayed the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] and usurped the supposed \"natural right\" of Italy to achieve supremacy in the Mediterranean basin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burgwyn|first=H.

In the 1920s, Italy's foreign policy was based on the traditional idea of Italy maintaining \"equidistant\" stance from all the major powers in order to exercise \"determinant weight\", which by whatever power Italy chose to align with would decisively change the balance of power in Europe, and the price of such an alignment would be support for Italian ambitions in Europe and Africa.<ref>Kallis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 pp. 129 & 141</ref> In the meantime, since for Mussolini demography was destiny, he carried out relentless natalist policies designed to increase the birthrate; for example, in 1924 making advocating or giving information about contraception a criminal offense, and in 1926 ordering every Italian woman to double the number of children that they were willing to bear.<ref>Strang, Bruce ''On the Fiery March'', New York: Praeger, 2003 p. 27.</ref> For Mussolini, Italy's current population of 40 million was insufficient to fight a major war, and he needed to increase the population to at least 60 million Italians before he would be ready for war.<ref>Strang, Bruce ''On the Fiery March'', New York: Praeger, 2003 p. 26.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mussolini truppe Etiopia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Mussolini inspecting troops during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italo-Ethiopian War]]]]\nIn his early years in power, Mussolini operated as a pragmatic statesman, trying to achieve some advantages, but never at the risk of war with Britain and France.

In 1929, Mussolini ordered his Army General Staff to begin planning for aggression against France and Yugoslavia.<ref name=\"Sullivan pp. 178\u2013203\"/> In July 1932, Mussolini sent a message to German Defense Minister General [[Kurt von Schleicher]], suggesting an anti-French Italo-German alliance, an offer Schleicher responded to favorably, albeit with the condition that Germany needed to rearm first.<ref name=\"Sullivan pp. 178\u2013203\"/> In late 1932\u2013early 1933, Mussolini planned to launch a surprise attack against both France and Yugoslavia that was to begin in August 1933.<ref name=\"Sullivan pp. 178\u2013203\"/> Mussolini's planned war of 1933 was only stopped when he learned that the French ''[[Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau]]'' had broken the Italian military codes, and that the French, being forewarned of all the Italian plans, were well prepared for the Italian attack.<ref name=\"Sullivan pp. 178\u2013203\"/>\n\nAfter [[Adolf Hitler]] came into power, threatening Italian interests in Austria and the Danube basin, Mussolini proposed the [[Four Power Pact]] with Britain, France and Germany in 1933. When the Austrian 'austro-fascist' Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss#Assassination|Engelbert Dollfuss]] with dictatorial power was assassinated on 25 July 1934 by National-Socialist supporters, Mussolini even threatened Germany with war in the event of a German invasion of Austria. Mussolini for a period of time continued strictly opposing any German attempt to obtain [[Anschluss]] and promoted the ephemeral [[Stresa Front]] against Germany in 1935.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R69173, M\u00fcnchener Abkommen, Staatschefs.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=group portrait Edward Chamberlain, \u00c9douard Daladier, Adolf Hitler, Mussolini, and Count Ciano, as they prepared to sign the Munich Agreement|From left to right:\n[[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]], [[\u00c9douard Daladier|Daladier]], Hitler, Mussolini, and Italian Foreign Minister [[Count Ciano]], as they prepare to sign the [[Munich Agreement]]]]\nDespite Mussolini's imprisonment for opposing the Italo-Turkish War in Africa as \"nationalist [[delirium tremens]]\" and \"a miserable war of conquest\",{{r|gunther1940}} after the [[Abyssinia Crisis]] of 1935\u20131936, in the [[Second Italo\u2013Ethiopian War]] Italy invaded [[Ethiopia]] following border incidents occasioned by Italian inclusions over the vaguely drawn border between Ethiopia and [[Italian Somaliland]]. Historians are still divided about the reasons for the attack on Ethiopia in 1935.

In an interview in January 1945 by Madeleine Mollier, a few months before he was captured and executed by Italian anti-fascist partisans, he stated flatly: \"Seven years ago, I was an interesting person.

The corpse of the deposed leader was subject to ridicule and abuse.

The body of Starace was subsequently hung up next to that of Mussolini.\n\nAfter his death and the display of his corpse in Milan, Mussolini was buried in an unmarked grave in the [[Cimitero Maggiore di Milano|Musocco]] cemetery, to the north of the city. On [[Easter Sunday]] 1946, his body was located and dug up by [[Domenico Leccisi]] and two other [[neo-fascism|neo-Fascists]].\n\nOn the loose for months\u2014and a cause of great anxiety to the new Italian democracy\u2014Mussolini's body was finally \"recaptured\" in August, hidden in a small trunk at the [[Certosa di Pavia]], just outside Milan. Two [[Franciscan Order|Fransciscan]] brothers were subsequently charged with concealing the corpse, though it was discovered on further investigation that it had been constantly on the move. Unsure what to do, the authorities held the remains in a kind of political limbo for ten years, before agreeing to allow them to be re-interred at [[Predappio]] in [[Romagna]], his birthplace. [[Adone Zoli]], the then-current prime minister, contacted [[Rachele Mussolini|Donna Rachele]], the dictator's widow, to tell her he was returning the remains, as he needed the support of the far-right in parliament, including Leccisi himself. In Predappio the dictator was buried in a crypt (the only posthumous honor granted to Mussolini).

The couple had a son the following year and named him Benito Albino Mussolini. In December 1915, Mussolini married [[Rachele Mussolini|Rachele Guidi]], who had been his mistress since 1910.

It contains much fine architecture spanning the 11th to the 16th centuries and is the place of interment of numerous [[Bishop of Winchester|Bishops of Winchester]] (such as [[William of Wykeham]]), [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] monarchs (such as [[Egbert of Wessex]]) and later monarchs such as King [[Canute the Great|Canute]] and [[William II of England|William Rufus]].<ref name=\"RTGB\">{{cite book |last=Dodson |first=Aidan |title=The Royal Tombs of Great Britain |location=London |publisher=Gerald Duckworth & Co. |year=2004}}</ref> It was once an important [[pilgrim]]age centre and housed the [[shrine]] of [[Swithun|Saint Swithun]]. The ancient [[Pilgrims' Way]] to [[Canterbury]] begins at Winchester. The plan of the earlier [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]] is laid out in the grass adjoining the cathedral. The [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] (the original burial place of [[Alfred the Great]] and [[Edward the Elder]]<ref name=\"RTGB\" />) once stood beside it. The cathedral has a girls choir and a boys choir, who sing regularly in the cathedral.\n\nWinchester Cathedral Close contains a number of historic buildings from the time when the cathedral was also a [[priory]]. Of particular note is the ''[[Deanery]]'', which dates back to the 13th century. It was originally the Prior's House, and was the birthplace of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]] in 1486. Not far away is ''Cheyney Court'', a mid 15th-century [[timber framing|timber-framed]] house incorporating the Porter's Lodge for the Priory Gate. It was the Bishop's court house.\n\nThe earliest [[hammer-beam]]ed building still standing in England is situated in the Cathedral Close, next to the Dean's garden. It is known as the ''Pilgrims' Hall'', as it was part of the hostelry used to accommodate the many pilgrims to Saint Swithun's shrine. Left-overs from the lavish banquets of the Priors (the monastic predecessors of the later Deans) would be given to the pilgrims, who were welcome to spend the night in the hall. It is thought by Winchester City Council to have been built in 1308. Now part of [[The Pilgrims' School]], the hall is used by the school for assemblies in the morning, drama lessons, plays, orchestral practices, Cathedral Waynflete{{clarify|date=September 2019}} rehearsals, the school's Senior Commoners' Choir rehearsals etc.\n\nEntrance for pedestrians to the North [[garth (architecture)|garth]] of the cathedral is via the Norman arches of Saint Maurice's tower, in the High Street.<ref>Hampshire Churches, Margaret Green,Winton Pubs.Ltd.1967. Page 90.</ref>\n\n===Wolvesey Castle and Palace===\n{{Main|Wolvesey Castle}}\n[[Wolvesey Castle]] was the [[Anglo-Normans|Norman]] bishop's palace, dating from 1110, but standing on the site of an earlier Saxon structure. It was enhanced by [[Henry de Blois]] during [[the Anarchy]] of his brother King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]]'s reign. He was besieged there for some days. In the 16th century, Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]] and King [[Philip II of Spain]] were guests just before their wedding in the Cathedral. The building is now a ruin (maintained by [[English Heritage]]), but the chapel was incorporated into the new palace built in the 1680s, only one wing of which survives.\n\n===Castle===\n{{Main|Winchester Castle}}\n[[File:Winchester RoundTable.jpg|thumb|The \"Winchester Round Table\" in the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle]]]]\nWinchester is well known for the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle|its castle]], which was built in the 12th century. The Great Hall was rebuilt sometime between 1222 and 1235, and still exists in this form. It is famous for ''[[King Arthur]]'s [[Round Table]]'', which has hung in the hall from at least 1463. The table actually dates from the 13th century, and as such is not contemporary to Arthur. Despite this it is still of considerable historical interest and attracts many tourists. The table was originally unpainted, but was painted for [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] in 1522. The names of the legendary [[Knights of the Round Table]] are written around the edge of the table surmounted by King Arthur on his throne. Opposite the table are [[Prince Charles]]'s 'Wedding Gates'. In the grounds of the Great Hall is a recreation of a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] garden. Apart from the hall, only a few excavated remains of the stronghold survive among the modern Law Courts. The buildings were supplanted by the adjacent [[King's House, Winchester|King's House]], now incorporated into the [[Peninsula Barracks]] where there are five military museums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winchestermilitarymuseums.co.uk|accessdate=15 April 2012|title=Winchester's Military Museums|publisher=Winchester's Military Museums}}</ref> (The training that used to be carried out at the barracks is now done by the [[Army Training Regiment]] Winchester, based at the [[Sir John Moore Barracks]], {{convert|2|mi|km|sigfig=1}} outside the city).<ref name=\"Ministry of Defence training\">{{cite web|title=MOD Training and Education|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/training_education/6959.aspx|website=MOD Training|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Hospital of St Cross===\n{{Main|Hospital of St Cross}}\n[[File:The Hospital of St Cross.jpg|alt=The Hospital of St Cross|thumb|The Hospital of St Cross]]\nThe [[almshouse]]s and vast [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[chapel]] of [[Hospital of St Cross]] were founded just outside the city centre by [[Henry de Blois]] in the 1130s.

It contains much fine architecture spanning the 11th to the 16th centuries and is the place of interment of numerous [[Bishop of Winchester|Bishops of Winchester]] (such as [[William of Wykeham]]), [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] monarchs (such as [[Egbert of Wessex]]) and later monarchs such as King [[Canute the Great|Canute]] and [[William II of England|William Rufus]].<ref name=\"RTGB\">{{cite book |last=Dodson |first=Aidan |title=The Royal Tombs of Great Britain |location=London |publisher=Gerald Duckworth & Co. |year=2004}}</ref> It was once an important [[pilgrim]]age centre and housed the [[shrine]] of [[Swithun|Saint Swithun]]. The ancient [[Pilgrims' Way]] to [[Canterbury]] begins at Winchester. The plan of the earlier [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]] is laid out in the grass adjoining the cathedral. The [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] (the original burial place of [[Alfred the Great]] and [[Edward the Elder]]<ref name=\"RTGB\" />) once stood beside it. The cathedral has a girls choir and a boys choir, who sing regularly in the cathedral.\n\nWinchester Cathedral Close contains a number of historic buildings from the time when the cathedral was also a [[priory]]. Of particular note is the ''[[Deanery]]'', which dates back to the 13th century. It was originally the Prior's House, and was the birthplace of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]] in 1486. Not far away is ''Cheyney Court'', a mid 15th-century [[timber framing|timber-framed]] house incorporating the Porter's Lodge for the Priory Gate. It was the Bishop's court house.\n\nThe earliest [[hammer-beam]]ed building still standing in England is situated in the Cathedral Close, next to the Dean's garden. It is known as the ''Pilgrims' Hall'', as it was part of the hostelry used to accommodate the many pilgrims to Saint Swithun's shrine. Left-overs from the lavish banquets of the Priors (the monastic predecessors of the later Deans) would be given to the pilgrims, who were welcome to spend the night in the hall. It is thought by Winchester City Council to have been built in 1308. Now part of [[The Pilgrims' School]], the hall is used by the school for assemblies in the morning, drama lessons, plays, orchestral practices, Cathedral Waynflete{{clarify|date=September 2019}} rehearsals, the school's Senior Commoners' Choir rehearsals etc.\n\nEntrance for pedestrians to the North [[garth (architecture)|garth]] of the cathedral is via the Norman arches of Saint Maurice's tower, in the High Street.<ref>Hampshire Churches, Margaret Green,Winton Pubs.Ltd.1967.

It was enhanced by [[Henry de Blois]] during [[the Anarchy]] of his brother King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]]'s reign. He was besieged there for some days. In the 16th century, Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]] and King [[Philip II of Spain]] were guests just before their wedding in the Cathedral. The building is now a ruin (maintained by [[English Heritage]]), but the chapel was incorporated into the new palace built in the 1680s, only one wing of which survives.\n\n===Castle===\n{{Main|Winchester Castle}}\n[[File:Winchester RoundTable.jpg|thumb|The \"Winchester Round Table\" in the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle]]]]\nWinchester is well known for the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle|its castle]], which was built in the 12th century. The Great Hall was rebuilt sometime between 1222 and 1235, and still exists in this form. It is famous for ''[[King Arthur]]'s [[Round Table]]'', which has hung in the hall from at least 1463. The table actually dates from the 13th century, and as such is not contemporary to Arthur. Despite this it is still of considerable historical interest and attracts many tourists. The table was originally unpainted, but was painted for [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] in 1522. The names of the legendary [[Knights of the Round Table]] are written around the edge of the table surmounted by King Arthur on his throne. Opposite the table are [[Prince Charles]]'s 'Wedding Gates'. In the grounds of the Great Hall is a recreation of a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] garden. Apart from the hall, only a few excavated remains of the stronghold survive among the modern Law Courts. The buildings were supplanted by the adjacent [[King's House, Winchester|King's House]], now incorporated into the [[Peninsula Barracks]] where there are five military museums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winchestermilitarymuseums.co.uk|accessdate=15 April 2012|title=Winchester's Military Museums|publisher=Winchester's Military Museums}}</ref> (The training that used to be carried out at the barracks is now done by the [[Army Training Regiment]] Winchester, based at the [[Sir John Moore Barracks]], {{convert|2|mi|km|sigfig=1}} outside the city).<ref name=\"Ministry of Defence training\">{{cite web|title=MOD Training and Education|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/training_education/6959.aspx|website=MOD Training|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Hospital of St Cross===\n{{Main|Hospital of St Cross}}\n[[File:The Hospital of St Cross.jpg|alt=The Hospital of St Cross|thumb|The Hospital of St Cross]]\nThe [[almshouse]]s and vast [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[chapel]] of [[Hospital of St Cross]] were founded just outside the city centre by [[Henry de Blois]] in the 1130s.

On both shows McGraw offers advice in the form of \"life strategies\" from his life experience as a [[clinical psychology|clinical]] and [[Forensic psychology|forensic psychologist]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drphil.com/about-dr-phil/|title=About Dr. Phil {{!}} Dr. Phil|date=2015-10-22|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref>\n\nThe show is in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] throughout the United States and a number of other countries. Its tenth season premiered on September 12, 2011. Occasional prime time specials have aired on [[CBS]]. The program has been nominated for a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] every year since 2004. Since September 2008, ''Dr. Phil'' has been broadcast in HDTV with a revamped look and a new theme written and performed by McGraw's son, Jordan.\n\nThe executive producers are Phil McGraw and [[showrunner]] Oprah Winfrey. It is a production of [[Phil McGraw|Peteski Productions]] and distributed by [[CBS Television Distribution]]. [[Harpo Productions]] co-produced the series until 2010, with [[Paramount Domestic Television]] and its successor, [[CBS Paramount Domestic Television]], serving as secondary co-producers until 2007. It was originally distributed by [[King World Productions]].\n\nThe program is recorded before a live studio audience in Stage 29 on the [[Paramount Pictures]] lot in [[Hollywood, California]]. It is recorded from August through to May with a break in December for the holiday season. Reruns of earlier episodes of the series began broadcasting on the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]] in January 2011. On October 25, 2018, it was announced that ''Dr. Phil'' had been renewed for four additional seasons, taking the show to May 2023, or the end of its 21st season.\n\n==Format==\nThe show covers a wide variety of topics including [[weight loss]], [[financial planning]], errant children, gift suggestions, [[autistic]] children, unhappily [[marriage|married couples]], [[Teenage rebellion|rebellious teenagers]], mothers who dress far from their age, mothers who refuse to attend weddings, children being stars and their parents' rights, the emotional benefits of controlling, [[dysfunctional families]], mothers who refuse to give their married sons money, and support for charitable causes. Radio personality and former child star [[Danny Bonaduce]] came to the show twice in a year to discuss his failing [[marriage]] (and later [[divorce]]) with second wife Gretchen.\n\nOn several shows children and/or adults have taken [[lie detector|polygraph]] tests, usually done by retired FBI agent Jack Trimarco. The show is generally serious in tone, leavened with humor from time to time. It has its occasional tense moments and often [[trash TV|trashy]] scenes, like that of ''[[The Montel Williams Show]]'', but without melees or aggressive fights on stage, in contrast to ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' or ''[[The Steve Wilkos Show]]''. McGraw is noted for often bringing families back on multiple shows for follow-up \"therapy\" sessions in his segment called \"Dr. Phil Family.\"\n\nGenerally the program is filmed and guests appear in studio, but in 2006 the ''Dr. Phil House'' began as an occasional series. McGraw and his production staff invite guests to a special house wired with numerous cameras and microphones. There, his staff monitors the conversations of the guests he is trying to help, and intervenes when necessary in order to prevent physical violence. McGraw also provides on-the-spot advice and counseling to the \"house guests\". McGraw's wife Robin sits in the studio audience for almost every show and, at the end of the show, walks off the set with him.\n\n=={{anchor|Notable episodes}}Notable episodes==\n* In a show that aired on May 2, 2005, twin sisters Jocelyn and Crystal Potter appeared. Crystal claimed to want to work in the [[adult industry]] together with Jocelyn, who rejected the idea as repulsive. Brothel owner [[Dennis Hof]] was interviewed and stated that the two could make half a million dollars per year in his establishment. The sisters' testimony proved to be less than truthful: beginning in 2002, they appeared as the \"Potter Sisters\" in numerous pornographic films together, and in 2003, they even appeared together with Hof in the porn film ''Goin' Down At The Bunny Ranch''. The show received much criticism due to perceptions of hypocrisy, because even though McGraw was an outspoken critic of [[pornography]], his own son [[Jay McGraw]] was married to [[Erica Dahm]], a ''[[Playboy]]'' Playmate (December 1998), who was notable for performing with her two identical triplet sisters.<ref name=\"porn\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/313967p-268580c.html |title=Dr. Phil's Double Trouble|accessdate=January 31, 2008|publisher=New York Daily News|year=2005|author=Ben Widdicombe |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231052936/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/313967p-268580c.html |archivedate = December 31, 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"porn2\">{{Cite web|url=http://s91498905.onlinehome.us/DrPhil/|title=How Dr. Phil became Dr. Phoney|accessdate=January 31, 2008|publisher=OnlineHome.us|year=2005|author=Anon}}</ref>\n* The ''Dr. Phil House'' was set in an actual house within the [[Wilshire Park, Los Angeles, California|Wilshire Park]] neighborhood in Los Angeles.

Rather than hosting live-audience shows, or putting the show on hiatus, McGraw began hosting Dr. Phil from his home studio. The episodes typically began with McGraw being joined by various medical doctors, CDC officials and mental health professionals \u2013 via internet-conference \u2013 and discussed public concerns and anxieties surrounding the pandemic, as well as the mental and physical strain that viewers might have. This was the first time during the history of the Dr. Phil Show that regular, weekly episodes were not filmed in the Studio, and did not involve either in-person guests, audiences and very limited technical assistance.\n\n==''Dr. Phil Now''==\nEpisodes under the ''Dr. Phil Now'' banner usually feature current events in the news with McGraw's viewpoint, often with an interview with the subject involved, which may include a suspect in a [[true crime]] case, the parents in a contentious child custody battle, or a celebrity subject. These episodes often feature more urgent music, and often feature McGraw originating the segment from the [[master control]] room of [[KCBS-TV]] with a bank of monitors tuned to various news networks and local news stations to give a more news-like feel to the episode.\n\n==Criticism==\nMcGraw's advice and methods have drawn criticism from psychotherapists as well as from laypersons.

After McGraw's success with his segments on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', ''Dr. Phil'' debuted on September 16, 2002. On both shows McGraw offers advice in the form of \"life strategies\" from his life experience as a [[clinical psychology|clinical]] and [[Forensic psychology|forensic psychologist]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drphil.com/about-dr-phil/|title=About Dr. Phil {{!}} Dr. Phil|date=2015-10-22|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref>\n\nThe show is in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] throughout the United States and a number of other countries. Its tenth season premiered on September 12, 2011. Occasional prime time specials have aired on [[CBS]]. The program has been nominated for a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] every year since 2004. Since September 2008, ''Dr. Phil'' has been broadcast in HDTV with a revamped look and a new theme written and performed by McGraw's son, Jordan.\n\nThe executive producers are Phil McGraw and [[showrunner]] Oprah Winfrey. It is a production of [[Phil McGraw|Peteski Productions]] and distributed by [[CBS Television Distribution]]. [[Harpo Productions]] co-produced the series until 2010, with [[Paramount Domestic Television]] and its successor, [[CBS Paramount Domestic Television]], serving as secondary co-producers until 2007. It was originally distributed by [[King World Productions]].\n\nThe program is recorded before a live studio audience in Stage 29 on the [[Paramount Pictures]] lot in [[Hollywood, California]]. It is recorded from August through to May with a break in December for the holiday season. Reruns of earlier episodes of the series began broadcasting on the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]] in January 2011. On October 25, 2018, it was announced that ''Dr. Phil'' had been renewed for four additional seasons, taking the show to May 2023, or the end of its 21st season.\n\n==Format==\nThe show covers a wide variety of topics including [[weight loss]], [[financial planning]], errant children, gift suggestions, [[autistic]] children, unhappily [[marriage|married couples]], [[Teenage rebellion|rebellious teenagers]], mothers who dress far from their age, mothers who refuse to attend weddings, children being stars and their parents' rights, the emotional benefits of controlling, [[dysfunctional families]], mothers who refuse to give their married sons money, and support for charitable causes. Radio personality and former child star [[Danny Bonaduce]] came to the show twice in a year to discuss his failing [[marriage]] (and later [[divorce]]) with second wife Gretchen.\n\nOn several shows children and/or adults have taken [[lie detector|polygraph]] tests, usually done by retired FBI agent Jack Trimarco. The show is generally serious in tone, leavened with humor from time to time. It has its occasional tense moments and often [[trash TV|trashy]] scenes, like that of ''[[The Montel Williams Show]]'', but without melees or aggressive fights on stage, in contrast to ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' or ''[[The Steve Wilkos Show]]''. McGraw is noted for often bringing families back on multiple shows for follow-up \"therapy\" sessions in his segment called \"Dr. Phil Family.\"\n\nGenerally the program is filmed and guests appear in studio, but in 2006 the ''Dr. Phil House'' began as an occasional series. McGraw and his production staff invite guests to a special house wired with numerous cameras and microphones. There, his staff monitors the conversations of the guests he is trying to help, and intervenes when necessary in order to prevent physical violence. McGraw also provides on-the-spot advice and counseling to the \"house guests\". McGraw's wife Robin sits in the studio audience for almost every show and, at the end of the show, walks off the set with him.\n\n=={{anchor|Notable episodes}}Notable episodes==\n* In a show that aired on May 2, 2005, twin sisters Jocelyn and Crystal Potter appeared. Crystal claimed to want to work in the [[adult industry]] together with Jocelyn, who rejected the idea as repulsive. Brothel owner [[Dennis Hof]] was interviewed and stated that the two could make half a million dollars per year in his establishment. The sisters' testimony proved to be less than truthful: beginning in 2002, they appeared as the \"Potter Sisters\" in numerous pornographic films together, and in 2003, they even appeared together with Hof in the porn film ''Goin' Down At The Bunny Ranch''. The show received much criticism due to perceptions of hypocrisy, because even though McGraw was an outspoken critic of [[pornography]], his own son [[Jay McGraw]] was married to [[Erica Dahm]], a ''[[Playboy]]'' Playmate (December 1998), who was notable for performing with her two identical triplet sisters.<ref name=\"porn\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/313967p-268580c.html |title=Dr. Phil's Double Trouble|accessdate=January 31, 2008|publisher=New York Daily News|year=2005|author=Ben Widdicombe |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231052936/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/313967p-268580c.html |archivedate = December 31, 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"porn2\">{{Cite web|url=http://s91498905.onlinehome.us/DrPhil/|title=How Dr. Phil became Dr. Phoney|accessdate=January 31, 2008|publisher=OnlineHome.us|year=2005|author=Anon}}</ref>\n* The ''Dr. Phil House'' was set in an actual house within the [[Wilshire Park, Los Angeles, California|Wilshire Park]] neighborhood in Los Angeles.
