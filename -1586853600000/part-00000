Some of them adopted the name Bnei Akiva and others had appellations such as HaShomer HaDati.<ref name=yv/> Twenty-five years later (1958), the Israeli and Diaspora groups merged and the Mazkirut Olamit (World Secretariat) of Bnei Akiva was formed.\n\n==Ideology==\nBnei Akiva's motto is ''Torah v'Avodah'', a phrase coined by Rav Shmuel Chaim Landau (Shachal).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Modern%20History/Centenary%20of%20Zionism/Youth%20Movements |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831061726/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Modern%20History/Centenary%20of%20Zionism/Youth%20Movements |archivedate=2010-08-31 }}</ref>  Bnei Akiva's objectives are to educate Jewish youth with values of [[Torah]] and work, to provide stimulating experiential and informal opportunities for encountering Judaism, and to encourage Jewish continuity and leadership. Bnei Akiva's twin ideals of ''Torah'' and ''[[Avodah]]'' translate to religious commitment and work on the land of Israel.  Bnei Akiva believes in emigration to the land of Israel ([[Aliyah|Aliya]]) as a central [[mitzvah|commandment]] of [[Judaism]], and maintains that the future of the Jewish people is tied to the state of Israel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bneiakiva.org/about/|title=About Bnei Akiva|accessdate=17 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923133920/http://www.bneiakiva.org/about/ |archivedate=23 September 2010|website=Bnei Akiva}}</ref> In the organization's early years, ''Avodah'' was understood as meaning agricultural work, as reflected in the symbolism of the movement's [[#The Emblem|emblem]]. In more recent years, there has driven a shift in ideology towards a broader definition of working for the development of the country. Members are encouraged to spend a year in Israel on organised learning and touring programs to broaden their knowledge of Israel and developing their leadership skills.\n\nSimilarly, the original [[socialism|socialist]] aims of Bnei Akiva are less actively pursued. Until the 1980s many Bnei Akiva members joined [[Religious Kibbutz Movement|religious Kibbutzim]] in groups based on mutual army service or Aliya. Since the 1990s, Bnei Akiva members now typically settle in development towns and settlements. \n\n==Organizational framework==\nIn Israel, Bnei Akiva is affiliated with [[Religious Kibbutz Movement|the Religious Kibbutz Movement]] and the party \"[[The Jewish Home]]\". It is run by a National Secretariat (''Hanhala Artzit''). Outside Israel, local branches of Bnei Akiva are under the Bnei Akiva Olami (Worldwide) organization. In every country, Bnei Akiva operates a network of [[Shabbat]] groups, summer camps, leadership seminars, [[Shabbaton]]im, and other activities.\n\n==Symbols of Bnei Akiva==\n===Emblem===\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|150px|Bnei Akiva emblem]]\nThe \"Semel\", Bnei Akiva's [[emblem]], shows farming utensils and wheat sheaves symbolizing the agricultural perspective of the ideology, and two tablets of stone in the center symbolizing the [[Torah]]. The two perspectives of Torah and Avoda are united together by the ribbon which says Bnei Akiva on it - symbolizing that the two aspects can only and must work hand in hand. The letters on the two tablets are the Hebrew letters 'Tav' and 'Ayin' standing for ''Torah veAvoda'' (\"Torah and work\").<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wej.com.au/bnei/bnei_home.html | title=Bnei Akiva Sydney Australia | accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref>\n\n===Anthem===\nThe Bnei Akiva's [[anthem]] was composed by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]] (originally known as Chaver Minkin).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bneiakiva.org/about/basics/yadAchim.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725001852/http://www.bneiakiva.org/about/basics/yadAchim.asp |archivedate=2011-07-25 }}</ref> He composed the anthem during the [[Chol HaMoed]] period of the [[Jewish holidays|holiday]] of [[Sukkot]], 1932, at a gathering of youth leaders in [[Kfar Saba]].

The Melbourne snif is the largest in Bnei Akiva Olami. Tochniot are held on Saturday afternoons, and bi-annual camps are run for each state. Other initiatives include weekly learning, group volunteer days, and regular minyanim. Bnei Akiva Melbourne runs an annual \"Amazing Race\" styled event. Bnei Akiva Sydney celebrated its 50th anniversary on November 7, 1999, at the Hakoah Club. The event was well received by madrichim, chanichim, and bogrim. Bnei Akiva Perth is a flourishing snif that is a driving force in the Perth Jewish Community. It co-ordinates a number of events during the year including a themed Kabbalat Shabbat, providing gift baskets for Purim, an Israeli history movie night and Shabbat dinners throughout the year. There is a federal summer camp held in December attended by senior chanichim from all snifim in Australia and New Zealand. Bnei Akiva Australia is a member of the [[Australasian Zionist Youth Council]] (AZYC).\n\n===Bnei Akiva Brasil===\nThere are two branches In [[Rio de Janeiro]], one in [[Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro|Copacabana]] (Snif Metzadah) and one in [[Tijuca]] (Snif Beit Yafah). Bnei Akiva's presence in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] started in the 50s. It now has two branches, one in [[Jardins]] and one in Higienopolis. Bnei Akiva also have a snif in [[Bel\u00e9m]]. Bnei Akiva's activities include Shabbatonim, camp (each year there are two camps in S\u00e3o Paulo and two in Rio de Janeiro), many field trips, and commemorations of the holidays.\n\n===Bnei Akiva of Europe===\n====Bnei Akiva Netherlands====\nIn the Netherlands, Bne Akiwa (the way it is transcribed in Dutch) started after the Holocaust period. During the latter half of the 20th century its main yearly activities were weekly pe'ulot on Shabbath in Amsterdam and on Sunday in other cities, summer and winter camps in the country, different European camps in the summer (Sayarim and Seminar Torani), Avoda summercamp in Israel, and participation in Hachshara year in Israel programs; Shabbath Ha'irgun weekend; publication of the magazine Zeraim. Different from other countries the movement is led by a Board which consists of members aged 16\u201322 years, placing a rather big responsibility on young shoulders, while the shaliach is the chairman. Many members have made aliya, while those who stay(ed) play(ed) significant roles in Jewish communal and non-Jewish life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bneakiwa.nl|title=Bne Akiwa Nederland|website=www.bneakiwa.nl}}</ref>\n\n====Bnei Akiva France====\nThere are snifim in the most important cities such as Paris, Lyon, Marseille and Strasbourg. Paris hosts several snifim. Each year several mahanot are organized for the winter and summer holidays. A Shabbat is organized each year for all the madrichim around the country. In France, the director of a snif is called a merakez.\n\n====Bnei Akiva Belgium====\nThere is one snif in Belgium, in Antwerp. There are mahanot organized each year in the winter (in the French Alps) and in the summer (depending on age there is the regular mahane, Sayarim and mahane Avoda). The madrichim attend a Shabbat with the rest of the European madrichim every year. The snif in Antwerp currently has 150 chanichim who come together every shabbat for a powerful Peula about aliyah (migration to Israel) and historic figures. The tsevet madrichim are Hineni and Orot, they consist of 18 madrichim. The current rosh snif is Dan Scalais (Orot). There are 8 kvutzot in the snif: rabbi akiva+ bar kochva (Madrichim: Eithan Elishakove and Netanel Elkabas), hachana nevatim (Madrichim best ones: Lionel Lesman Refael Michaely), Nevatim (Madrichim: Gabri\u00ebl Gotlib and Charles Trau), Nitsanim (Madrichim: Benjamin Trau and Amber Elishakove, Maalot (Madrichim:Bar Golan and Rafa\u00ebl Peterfreund), Maapilim (Madrichim: Laeticia Speaker and Avi Leiner), Haro\u00eb (Madrichim: Maayan Papismedov and David Morsel), Dorot (Madrichim: Hila Michaeli and Natanel Yatziv).\nThe two nominees of dorot are Eline Ohaion and Noam Schiff for the role of worse chanichim.\n\n====Bnei Akiva Switzerland====\nBnei Akiva [[Switzerland]] was founded in 1936. Numerous former Bnei Akiva Switzerland chaverim have made aliya as a result of being in the youth movement. Today,{{When|date=August 2018}} Bnei Akiva Switzerland has more than 120 members in the two chapters ([[snifim]]), in [[Basel]] and [[Zurich]]. [[Geneva]] used to have its own chapter, but was closed by the parent organization in [[Israel]] because of a lack of interested members. Bnei Akiva is the biggest Jewish youth organization in Switzerland. Due to the lack of a Jewish high school in Switzerland, Bnei Akiva fulfills an important role as a regular meeting place. It is a vital entity that allows high-school students, who do not see each other on a daily basis, to stay in contact with their Jewish friends. Every year there are two camps, one in summer and one in winter. Additionally, the two oldest shvatim (\"tribes\") join the Sayarim summer camp (a camp in which usually the oldest shevet of chapters all over Europe take part) on a biannual basis, followed by a four-week Israel trip the following year. A number of Shabbatonim take place throughout the year, such as the Yom Yerushalayim weekend. This snif is known as one of the worst snifim in Europe.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bne-akiwa.ch|title=Bne Akiwa Schweiz - \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e2\u05e7\u05d9\u05d1\u05d0 \u05e9\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05e5|first=M.|last=Fichmann|website=www.bne-akiwa.ch}}</ref>\n\n===Bnei Akiva UK===\nBnei Akiva in the UK was founded in 1939. Its beginnings were closely associated with Bachad and the Torah V'Avodah movement, which both encouraged aliya. [[Arieh Handler]] was the main figure in the early growth of Bnei Akiva, as he brought over children from Nazi Europe on the [[Kindertransport]] and placed them in Bachad Hachshara (preparation) centres. These aimed to prepare the youth to work the Land of Israel on kibbutzim by learning agricultural techniques. The first of these was at Gwrych Castle, which held the first-ever gathering of Bnei Akiva UK in December 1940. After the local Marquis shut down the centre and expelled the Jewish immigrants, other hachshara centres were set up in Bromsgrove, Buckinghamshire and the most famous, [[Thaxted]], [[Essex]].\n\nMany [[Kibbutz]]im, including Lavi and Beit Rimon, were founded by members of BAUK. In modern times, hachshara takes place in Israel and involves two schemes: Torani (the yeshiva and seminary track) and Kivun (giving participants a range of experiences in Israel). Bnei Akiva is the leading provider of gap years to Israel for 18-year-olds in the UK.\n\nNowadays, Bnei Akiva is the largest Jewish youth movement in the country, with more than 1,000 members paying Mas Chaver (membership) each year. It is run by five full-time sabbatical workers who work in the London Bayit, the offices of Bnei Akiva UK. Bnei Akiva also brings over families of shlichim (emissaries) from Israel, one serving as the Bnei Akiva rabbinical couple and one serving the northern communities. The mazkirut and shlichim together with the nivcharim [elected representatives], who are elected by the movement's members each year, form the Hanhalla [governing body]. \n \nBnei Akiva runs 21 svivot (branches) around the UK. They run activities on Shabbat afternoons as well as running Succah Crawls, Family Friday Nights and Shabbatot Ha'Irgun. This year, there are active Bnei Akiva groups in, [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]], [[Borehamwood|Borehamwood & Elstree]], [[Brondesbury Park]], [[Bushey]], [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]], [[Chigwell]], [[Edgware]], [[Finchley]], [[Golders Green]], [[Hale, Greater Manchester|Hale]], [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]], [[Hendon]], [[Leeds]], [[Mill Hill]], [[Muswell Hill]], [[Oxford]], [[Pinner]], [[Radlett]], [[City of Salford|Salford]], [[South Hampstead]], [[South Woodford]], [[Stanmore]], [[Whitefield, Greater Manchester|Whitefield]] and [[Woodside Park (Barnet, London)|Woodside Park]]. \n\nAreas which have previously hosted Svivot include, [[Accrington]], [[Belmont, Harrow|Belmont]], [[Birmingham]], [[Bowdon, Greater Manchester|Bowdon]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Kenton, London|Kenton]], [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury]],  [[Maida Vale]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Redbridge, London|Redbridge]], [[Sheffield]],  [[Southgate, London|Southgate]],  [[Stamford Hill]] and [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]]. The svivot mostly operate in local synagogues, however Bnei Akiva has two purpose-built buildings to house activities in [[Temple Fortune]] in London and Salford.\n\nBnei Akiva runs summer and winter camps (machanot) from school years 3\u201312. The winter camps include Aleph (Years Six & Seven), Ma'apilim (Year Eight), Haroeh (Year Nine), Gimmel (Year Ten) and Hadracha Course (Year Twelve). H-Course is a long-running leadership training camp which gives participants the skills to become the future leaders of the movement.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BATV Yediot News Old Title.png|thumbnail|right|Opening Titles 2011 - 2012]] -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:New title.png|thumbnail|right|Opening Titles 2013 -]] -->\n\nSummer camps include Ari (Years 3-6), Aleph (Year Six), Aleph Chalutzi (Year Seven), Bet Base (Year Eight), Bet Chalutzi (Year Nine) and Gimmel (Year Ten). For Year 11, there is Israel Machane, a three-week-long tour visiting sites in Israel. In 2011, Machane Cadur Regel (Football Camp) ran for years 3\u20135 in partnership with [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]] Football Club. Bnei Akiva also used to run the widely acclaimed Yachad programme, which caters for children with disabilities who want to be involved in camps.\n\nIn addition, there is a Beit Midrash Programme (BMP) which runs in conjunction with the other camps every summer. In recent years, Bnei Akiva has teamed up with Kaytana to run camps for [[Ethiopia]]n children in [[Israel]] and also with Camp Simcha UK to run Keshet camp in [[London]] for children with serious illnesses. More than 1,000 people are involved in Bnei Akiva camps each year, making it the biggest provider of Jewish youth group camps in the UK.\n\nBnei Akiva UK actively supports projects in memory of [[Yoni Jesner]] who was heavily involved with the Glasgow branch of Bnei Akiva. He died from a critical head injury following a suicide bus bombing in Tel-Aviv, Israel.\n\n===Bnei Akiva Mexico===\nBnei Akiva in Mexico was founded in 1948. It is located in [[Mexico City]], with three chapters and one main house, which is the center of activities. There are more than 100 active members in the movement and a large population of non-active members, those who have grown too old for the youth groups, or those who have \"made ''[[Aliya]]''\" (moved to Israel). Bnei Akiva members are involved in community service such as participating in its institutions, studying in [[Jewish day school]]s, [[Hebrew school]]s and [[Yeshiva|Yeshivot]], and participating in ''Chessed'' activities ([[community service]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bneiakivamexico.org|title=\u5feb\u9069\uff01\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u4fbf\u5229\u30b0\u30c3\u30ba|website=www.bneiakivamexico.org|access-date=2019-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914172317/http://bneiakivamexico.org/|archive-date=2017-09-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Bnei Akiva New Zealand===\nBnei Akiva is one of the main Jewish youth movements in New Zealand, with weekly meetings and activities in Auckland and Wellington and national bi-annual camps. Bnei Akiva NZ's goal is to educate Jewish youth with the values of Torah ve'Avodah, combining a deeply rooted association with Israel together with day-to-day life in accordance with traditional Jewish values, and to provide stimulating experiential and informal opportunities for encountering Judaism. Bnei Akiva NZ ensures Jewish continuity and the future of the New Zealand Jewish community. Bnei Akiva New Zealand is a member of the [[Australasian Zionist Youth Council]] (AZYC).Website of Bnei Akiva New Zealand.\n\n===Bnei Akiva of the United States and Canada===\nBnei Akiva of the United States and Canada (known before 1993 as Bnei Akiva of North America) was formed with the 1950 merger between HaShomer HaDati and Bnei Akiva. It has several tiers of organization. At its most basic level, Bnei Akiva operates on a local level with Glilim (cities), which often contain one or more snifim (branches) where youth groups are run on [[Shabbat]]. Most Glilim are run by shlichim, (emissaries) from Israel, usually young couples. The first Bnei Akiva galil in America, technically belonging to HaShomer HaDati, was organized in [[Brooklyn]] by Meir Golombek in 1934, with additional Glilim forming around young leaders throughout the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s at a time when very little Zionist education was available in the United States. The level of activity in any given galil has fluctuated over the years depending on the level of leadership present.\n\nIn 2000, in an attempt to help Glilim that were without their own shlichim, Bnei Akiva of the United States and Canada formally added an additional regional infrastructure, with shlichim appointed to serve in a regional role and coordinate activities in several Glilim. The first such regional shaliach, for the Midwest, was Ilan Frydman.\n\nIn additional to the galil-based organization of Bnei Akiva, a second focus of activities in Bnei Akiva of the US&C are the summer camps, known as Camp Moshava. The first Moshava, in Hightstown, NJ, was established in 1936, with a second one opening in Rolling Prairie, Indiana in 1938 and a third in Bronte, Ontario in 1946. In 1947, a fourth Moshava began operating in Saugos, CA. Camp Stone, the fifth Moshava, began operating as a Bnei Akiva camp in conjunction with Young Israel in 1972. (Stone operated for three years without direct involvement from Bnei Akiva, from 1969-1972) Currently, the New York camp is located in Indian Orchard, PA, the Midwest Moshava moved to Wild Rose, WI, and the Canadian Moshava relocated to Ennismore, Ontario. The California Moshava currently operates out of Running Springs, CA, after a long hiatus following the 1985 sale of their Big Bear, CA, campus. Bnei Akiva also operates local day camps during the summer in New Jersey and Toronto. This follows the first attempt at such a program in Atlanta in the early 1990s. Attendance at Bnei Akiva summer programs is typically larger than participation in Glilim, though many chanichim and madrichim are active in both frameworks.\n\nAdditionally, there are several national programs that are run by Bnei Akiva of the US&C, most notably Mach Hach Baaretz, a six-week tour of Israel following 10th grade which attracts many participants who are not otherwise involved with Bnei Akiva. This program was started in 1972 by members in Los Angeles, and has grown to be one of the most successful and popular programs offered by Bnei Akiva of the United States and Canada. Another program, Machal, which is for graduates of 9th grade, was originally a national program, but is now run out of each camp separately. Various national shabbatonim are run by the national office, including Kenes Manhigei Chevraya Bet (KMCB) which brings together some of the most promising young high school leaders for extra training.\n\nJennifer van Amerongen is currently serving as Merakezet Chinuch (Coordinator of Education). Ariel Shields and Michal Laub are currently serving as Mazkirim Artzi (National Directors of Programming) of Bnei Akiva of the United States and Canada.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Boston====\nBnei Akiva Boston has two active Snifim: Sharon Bnei Akiva in Young Israel of Sharon, and Newton Bnei Akiva (NBA) as a joint program between Congregations Beth El-Atereth Israel and Shaarei Tefillah. Bnei Akiva Boston recommenced activity in September 2007 after a decade-long hiatus. As of 2017, Sharon Bnei Akiva operates its weekly activities on Shabbat afternoons for 2-8th grade children while NBA operates on Shabbat afternoons in the Fall/Spring and Motzei Shabbat in the winter.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Chicago====\nBnei Akiva of Chicago was established in 1935 is one of the largest Glilim in the country. Chicago hosts several local and regional shabbatonim each year. Galil Chicago has four snifim named Saad, Tirat Tzvi, Lakeview and Kfar Tzion. Chaverim from Chicago traditionally attend [[Camp Moshava, Wild Rose, WI]], in the summers, and that Moshava is most associated with Galil Chicago. It is part of the Midwest Region.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Cleveland====\nBnei Akiva Cleveland currently has more than 100 members, counting chanichim and madrichim. The city hosts a number of annual activities, including a Purim Carnival and Sukkot Festival, as well as a number of community programs such as Musicians Towers (prayers led by Bnei Akiva in a nursing home for the major Jewish holidays). The current shlichim in Cleveland are Yosef and Efrat Cashdan, with two additional Bnot Sherut. Members of Bnei Akiva Cleveland typically attend [[Camp Stone]] in the summer, and that camp's headquarters is located in Cleveland. Galil Cleveland is part of the Midwest Region.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Detroit====\nBnei Akiva has been operating in Detroit since 1950. Bnei Akiva has three snifim that meet every Shabbat: at the Young Israel of Oak Park, at the Young Israel of Southfield and at Ohel Moed of Shomrey Emunah in West Bloomfield. Many members of Bnei Akiva of Detroit have moved to Israel, and one former shaliach, [[Otniel Schneller]], previously served in the [[Knesset]]. The current shaliach is Yonatan Edrei, who lives in Oak Park, MI. Galil Detroit is in the Midwest Region, and campers primarily attend Camp Stone.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Hamilton====\nBnei Akiva of Hamilton is currently run by Mazkir Galil Ethan Terazadeh. Contrary to popular belief, Bnei Akiva of Hamilton is not the actual name for this Snif, rather called Bnei Akiva of Narnia.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Los Angeles====\nBnei Akiva Los Angeles (BALA), founded in 1946, is one of the oldest and most active Glilim in North America. BALA has four snifim spread throughout Los Angeles, each named after a prominent religious kibbutz: Snif Lavi (Tarzana), Snif Tirat Tzvi (North Hollywood), Snif Sa'ad (Hancock Park), and Snif Shluchot (Beverly Hills). Each snif holds weekly programming on Shabbatot for chanichim ranging from 2nd through 5th grade. In addition to its four snifim, BALA holds frequent events and programming for Vazach (sixth through eighth grade) and Chevraya Bet (high school). BALA also runs a Manhigut (leadership) program for ninth graders, in which budding Bnei Akiva leaders learn valuable leadership skills in preparation for joining the hadracha staff the following year. After a period of stagnation and low participation in the 2000s, BALA has undergone a significant revival in recent years, thanks in large part to the efforts of beloved former shlichim Eyal Fridman and Toby Tabak, who began their tenure in 2013 and were replaced in 2017 by Hagai and Adina Keisar. BALA will continue its growth in the coming year under the leadership of Mazkirei Galil Eytan Merkin and Naomi Weberman.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Montreal====\nBnei Akiva of Montreal is based in Hebrew Academy, where they have their one branch (snif-\u05e1\u05e0\u05d9\u05e3).

The current shlichim in Montreal are Eli and Sivan Veresh. Bnei Akiva Montreal runs weekly and monthly activities, educational training and Inter-city Shabbatonim.\n\n====Bnei Akiva Northeast====\nBnei Akiva of Northeast (BANE), the oldest galil in North America, has hundreds of members in 10 chapters across the region. In 1954, Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], became the mazkir (director) of Greater [[New York City|New York]]'s sixteen chapters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rabbi Meir Kahane: His Life and Thought|url=http://www.ziontimes.com/13-book_reviews/rabbikahane_hislifeandthought.asp|website=Zion Times}}</ref> BANE has branches in [[New Jersey]] (in [[Teaneck, New Jersey|Teaneck]], [[Fair Lawn, New Jersey|Fair Lawn]], [[Englewood, New Jersey|Englewood]] and [[Tenafly, New Jersey|Tenafly]]) and [[New York City|New York]] (on the [[Upper West Side|Upper West Side of Manhattan]], the [[Upper East Side|Upper East Side of Manhattan]], [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] in [[the Bronx]], [[Scarsdale, New York|Scarsdale]] and [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[West Hempstead, New York|West Hempstead]] and [[North Woodmere, New York|North Woodmere]] in [[Long Island]]). BANE also runs [[Shabbatonim]] and special events throughout the year for youth who are connected to Camp Moshava in [[Indian Orchard, Pennsylvania]]. Additional programs are run for college students, and largely focus on a commitment to live in the [[Land of Israel]].\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Philadelphia====\nBnei Akiva of Philadelphia maintains three snifim: Northeast Philadelphia, Lower Merion and Cherry Hill, NJ. Galil Philadelphia prides itself on its dedicated and spirited core of madrichim. It is part of the Mid-Atlantic Region, and hosts a range of exciting activities and Shabbatonim each year while receiving guidance from college-aged bogrim. While the Northeast branch has been in existence for decades, Snif Lower Merion began weekly Shabbat programming in September 2003 under the leadership of Chava Forman. In September 2012, Galil Philadelphia added a third snif in Cherry Hill, NJ.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Pittsburgh====\nAn active galil existed in Pittsburgh through the 1960s, when it became dormant. Activities resumed in 2005. Currently, Bnei Akiva of Pittsburgh operates a weekly snif out of the Shaare Torah synagogue. In addition, Bnei Akiva sponsors monthly social activities such as scavenger hunts, matza baking and trips to the movies. There is a special leadership program for 9th graders called Manhigut, which helps prepare them to be madrichim.<ref>[http://www.bneiakiva.org/pittsburgh Bnei Akiva Pittsburgh] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827192517/http://www.bneiakiva.org/pittsburgh |date=August 27, 2008 }}</ref> It is a member of the Bnei Akiva Midwest region.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Silver Spring====\nBnei Akiva of [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]] is part of the Mid-Atlantic Region and is the only galil in Maryland. Bnei Akiva of Silver Spring, also known as BASS, runs biweekly Shabbat programming at [[Kemp Mill, Maryland|Kemp Mill Synagogue]] for grades 3rd-6th as well as special ZA\"CH activities for grades 7th-8th. As the only chapter of Bnei Akiva in the area, BASS is responsible for the annual Yom HaZikaron and Yom Ha'atzmaut Tekes for the Greater Washington area at the [[Melvin J. Berman Hebrew Academy|Berman Hebrew Academy]] as well as other community youth activities. The current Roshei Snif are Aliza Mintz and Noa Ferziger and the current Roshei ZA\"CH and Ariella Wolf and Zachary Goldberg.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of St. Louis====\nBnei Akiva St. Louis was founded in 2008. It has one snif that meets weekly.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Toronto====\nBnei Akiva of Toronto was started in 1935 and maintains a strong presence in the city. Bnei Akiva of Toronto is known for being the biggest galil in the world outside of Israel. There are four snifim (BAYT, Or Chaim, Shaarei Shamayim, and Kehilla Centre), with more than 100 children attending on [[Shabbat]] afternoon, as well as programming for grades 2-12 and university students (Bogrim) throughout the year. There is also the Bnei Akiva-run camp [[Moshava]] Ennismore just outside Toronto, along with a day camp, Moshava Ba'ir Toronto, run in the city. Toronto houses the only Bnei Akiva [[yeshiva]] outside [[Israel]], Yeshivat Or Chaim with Ulpanat Orot, forms [[Bnei Akiva Schools of Toronto]]. Currently, Eliav Saban and Yakira Gasner are the Mazkirim of Bnei Akiva of Toronto. Bnei Akiva Toronto is a member of the Midwest Region.\n\n====Other Glilim====\nAdditional cities with active Bnei Akiva chapters include Atlanta, Baltimore, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Hollywood, FL, Houston, Minneapolis, Potomac, Silver Spring, and Washington. In the past, there have been several other chapters, including Boca Raton, Memphis, Miami, Phoenix, San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle.\n\n====Gap Year Programming====\nFor the 2014-2015 year, Bnei Akiva of the US and Canada launched a seminary and a yeshiva program in Israel called Midreshet Torah V'Avodah and Yeshivat Torah V'Avodah. In the words of the programs' website, www.tvaisrael.org, \"Along with several months of focused in-depth Torah study in an Israeli yeshiva or midrasha setting, TVA will open you up to Eretz Yisrael and Am Yisrael through targeted internships, intense volunteering and service learning, living and working on Kibbutz, exploring pivotal issues facing the future of the Jewish people, rigorous spoken-Hebrew language training, and exciting tiyulim throughout the year. All of these experiences will be infused with rigorous Torah learning while living in apartments in the dynamic community of Katamon in Jerusalem.\"\n\nIn the past, Bnei Akiva operated several other Gap Year programs. Until the 1980s members of BAUS&C participated in Hachshara. In the early 1990s, a program called Midrash Uma'aseh existed and drew many of the most involved members of Bnei Akiva. Since 1982, Bnei Akiva has offered a program called Tochnit Nissan for members studying in Israel during the month of Nissan. Traditionally, this program took place on a kibbutz, though other options are now offered.\n\n====Aliya====\nBnei Akiva of the United States and Canada actively promotes aliya, but the way in which this occurs has changed over the years. Until the 1990s, chanichim were encouraged to make aliya in garinim, or small groups intended to bolster existing communities. These were almost always directed to a Kibbutz Hadati, and fierce debates took place as to whether any other form of aliya was a valid expression of the movement's ideals. Today{{When|date=August 2018}} the push for aliya is more general, with no specific communities or framework in mind. The focus is more on coming to Israel and contributing positively to society in any way.\n\n===Bnei Akiva South Africa===\nBnei Akiva's presence in [[South Africa]] dates back to the 1920s. Today,{{When|date=August 2018}} it is one of the largest active Jewish youth movements in the country. It runs many ''[[Shabbaton]]im'' as well as weekly activities at its various centres on the country. Bnei Akiva runs a month-long annual summer camp in the [[Western Cape]], which is attended by more than 1,000 chanichim (campers) and madrichim (counselors). There is also a winter camp held in different locations each year, and is attended by youth from all over South Africa. The movement also runs many Israel programs throughout the year including MTA, Tafnit, Hadracha Tzeira, Kfar Haroeh and Bema'aleh.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)]]\n*[[Orthodox Judaism]]\n*[[Religious Kibbutz Movement]]\n*[[Religious Zionism]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101223021250/http://www.dianellashule.com/communityX.php?CGID=2]\n*[http://www.yba.org.il] - Yeshivot Bnei Akiva - In Israel (Hebrew)\n*[http://www.afyba.org] - American Friends of Yeshivot Bnei Akiva\n*[http://www.bauk.org]- Bnei Akiva UK (Bnei Akiva of Great Britain and Ireland)\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bneiakiva.org/ Bnei Akiva of the US and Canada]\n*[http://www.worldbneiakiva.org/ World Bnei Akiva]\n \n{{Religious Zionism|state=expanded}}\n{{Jewish Youth and Student Organisations|state=collapsed}}\n{{Organized Jewish Life in the United States|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Youth organizations based in Israel]]\n[[Category:Zionist youth movements]]\n[[Category:Orthodox Judaism]]\n[[Category:Jewish clubs and societies]]\n[[Category:Religious Zionist organizations]]\n[[Category:Jewish organizations established in 1929]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Largest religious Zionist youth movement in the world}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{condense|date=August 2018}}\n{{tone|date=August 2018}}\n{{update|date=August 2018}}\n{{close paraphrasing|source=http://www.wej.com.au/bnei/bnei_home.html|date=August 2018}}\n}}\n{{Infobox organization\n|name          = Bnei Akiva<br />{{Nobold|{{Hebrew|\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e2\u05e7\u05d9\u05d1\u05d0}}}}\n|logo = World Bnei Akiva.png\n|logo_size = 200px\n|logo_caption = World Bnei Akiva logo\n|map = \n|motto         = {{Lang|he|\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d5\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4}} (\"Torah and Work\") <!--''Torah ve'Avodah''-->\n|predecessor = \n|successor = \n|formation     = {{Start date and age|1929}}\n|extinction = \n|type          = [[List of Jewish youth organizations|Jewish Youth Movement]]\n|status        = Non-profit organization\n|purpose       = Educational\n|headquarters  = [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]]\n|coords        = {{coord|31|46.892|N|35|12.988|E|source:hewiki_type:landmark|display=inline}}\n|language = \n|leader_title  = General Director<!-- ([[Hebrew language|Heb.]] ''Mazkir Klali'') -->\n|leader_name = Roi Abecassis\n|key_people = \n|main_organ = \n|parent_organization = [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]\n|affiliations = \n|budget        = <!-- {{USD|0}} -->\n|size          = 160px\n|msize = \n|malt = \n|mcaption = \n|abbreviation = \n|location      = 54 [[King George Street (Jerusalem)|King George Street]], Jerusalem, Israel\n|region_served = Worldwide\n|membership    = Youth\n|general = \n|num_staff     = 25 (2016)\n|num_volunteers = \n|website       = {{URL|http://www.worldbneiakiva.org/}}\n}}\n\n'''Bnei Akiva''' ({{lang-he-n|\u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05e2\u05b2\u05e7\u05b4\u05d9\u05d1\u05b8\u05d0}}, \"Children of Akiva\") is the largest [[Religious Zionism|religious Zionist]] [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]] in the world, with over 125,000 members in 42 countries.

Some of them adopted the name Bnei Akiva and others had appellations such as HaShomer HaDati.<ref name=yv/> Twenty-five years later (1958), the Israeli and Diaspora groups merged and the Mazkirut Olamit (World Secretariat) of Bnei Akiva was formed.\n\n==Ideology==\nBnei Akiva's motto is ''Torah v'Avodah'', a phrase coined by Rav Shmuel Chaim Landau (Shachal).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Modern%20History/Centenary%20of%20Zionism/Youth%20Movements |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831061726/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Modern%20History/Centenary%20of%20Zionism/Youth%20Movements |archivedate=2010-08-31 }}</ref>  Bnei Akiva's objectives are to educate Jewish youth with values of [[Torah]] and work, to provide stimulating experiential and informal opportunities for encountering Judaism, and to encourage Jewish continuity and leadership. Bnei Akiva's twin ideals of ''Torah'' and ''[[Avodah]]'' translate to religious commitment and work on the land of Israel.  Bnei Akiva believes in emigration to the land of Israel ([[Aliyah|Aliya]]) as a central [[mitzvah|commandment]] of [[Judaism]], and maintains that the future of the Jewish people is tied to the state of Israel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bneiakiva.org/about/|title=About Bnei Akiva|accessdate=17 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923133920/http://www.bneiakiva.org/about/ |archivedate=23 September 2010|website=Bnei Akiva}}</ref> In the organization's early years, ''Avodah'' was understood as meaning agricultural work, as reflected in the symbolism of the movement's [[#The Emblem|emblem]]. In more recent years, there has driven a shift in ideology towards a broader definition of working for the development of the country. Members are encouraged to spend a year in Israel on organised learning and touring programs to broaden their knowledge of Israel and developing their leadership skills.\n\nSimilarly, the original [[socialism|socialist]] aims of Bnei Akiva are less actively pursued. Until the 1980s many Bnei Akiva members joined [[Religious Kibbutz Movement|religious Kibbutzim]] in groups based on mutual army service or Aliya. Since the 1990s, Bnei Akiva members now typically settle in development towns and settlements. \n\n==Organizational framework==\nIn Israel, Bnei Akiva is affiliated with [[Religious Kibbutz Movement|the Religious Kibbutz Movement]] and the party \"[[The Jewish Home]]\". It is run by a National Secretariat (''Hanhala Artzit''). Outside Israel, local branches of Bnei Akiva are under the Bnei Akiva Olami (Worldwide) organization. In every country, Bnei Akiva operates a network of [[Shabbat]] groups, summer camps, leadership seminars, [[Shabbaton]]im, and other activities.\n\n==Symbols of Bnei Akiva==\n===Emblem===\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|150px|Bnei Akiva emblem]]\nThe \"Semel\", Bnei Akiva's [[emblem]], shows farming utensils and wheat sheaves symbolizing the agricultural perspective of the ideology, and two tablets of stone in the center symbolizing the [[Torah]]. The two perspectives of Torah and Avoda are united together by the ribbon which says Bnei Akiva on it - symbolizing that the two aspects can only and must work hand in hand.

The Melbourne snif is the largest in Bnei Akiva Olami. Tochniot are held on Saturday afternoons, and bi-annual camps are run for each state. Other initiatives include weekly learning, group volunteer days, and regular minyanim. Bnei Akiva Melbourne runs an annual \"Amazing Race\" styled event. Bnei Akiva Sydney celebrated its 50th anniversary on November 7, 1999, at the Hakoah Club. The event was well received by madrichim, chanichim, and bogrim. Bnei Akiva Perth is a flourishing snif that is a driving force in the Perth Jewish Community. It co-ordinates a number of events during the year including a themed Kabbalat Shabbat, providing gift baskets for Purim, an Israeli history movie night and Shabbat dinners throughout the year. There is a federal summer camp held in December attended by senior chanichim from all snifim in Australia and New Zealand. Bnei Akiva Australia is a member of the [[Australasian Zionist Youth Council]] (AZYC).\n\n===Bnei Akiva Brasil===\nThere are two branches In [[Rio de Janeiro]], one in [[Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro|Copacabana]] (Snif Metzadah) and one in [[Tijuca]] (Snif Beit Yafah). Bnei Akiva's presence in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] started in the 50s. It now has two branches, one in [[Jardins]] and one in Higienopolis. Bnei Akiva also have a snif in [[Bel\u00e9m]]. Bnei Akiva's activities include Shabbatonim, camp (each year there are two camps in S\u00e3o Paulo and two in Rio de Janeiro), many field trips, and commemorations of the holidays.\n\n===Bnei Akiva of Europe===\n====Bnei Akiva Netherlands====\nIn the Netherlands, Bne Akiwa (the way it is transcribed in Dutch) started after the Holocaust period. During the latter half of the 20th century its main yearly activities were weekly pe'ulot on Shabbath in Amsterdam and on Sunday in other cities, summer and winter camps in the country, different European camps in the summer (Sayarim and Seminar Torani), Avoda summercamp in Israel, and participation in Hachshara year in Israel programs; Shabbath Ha'irgun weekend; publication of the magazine Zeraim. Different from other countries the movement is led by a Board which consists of members aged 16\u201322 years, placing a rather big responsibility on young shoulders, while the shaliach is the chairman. Many members have made aliya, while those who stay(ed) play(ed) significant roles in Jewish communal and non-Jewish life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bneakiwa.nl|title=Bne Akiwa Nederland|website=www.bneakiwa.nl}}</ref>\n\n====Bnei Akiva France====\nThere are snifim in the most important cities such as Paris, Lyon, Marseille and Strasbourg. Paris hosts several snifim. Each year several mahanot are organized for the winter and summer holidays. A Shabbat is organized each year for all the madrichim around the country. In France, the director of a snif is called a merakez.\n\n====Bnei Akiva Belgium====\nThere is one snif in Belgium, in Antwerp. There are mahanot organized each year in the winter (in the French Alps) and in the summer (depending on age there is the regular mahane, Sayarim and mahane Avoda). The madrichim attend a Shabbat with the rest of the European madrichim every year. The snif in Antwerp currently has 150 chanichim who come together every shabbat for a powerful Peula about aliyah (migration to Israel) and historic figures. The tsevet madrichim are Hineni and Orot, they consist of 18 madrichim. The current rosh snif is Dan Scalais (Orot). There are 8 kvutzot in the snif: rabbi akiva+ bar kochva (Madrichim: Eithan Elishakove and Netanel Elkabas), hachana nevatim (Madrichim best ones: Lionel Lesman Refael Michaely), Nevatim (Madrichim: Gabri\u00ebl Gotlib and Charles Trau), Nitsanim (Madrichim: Benjamin Trau and Amber Elishakove, Maalot (Madrichim:Bar Golan and Rafa\u00ebl Peterfreund), Maapilim (Madrichim: Laeticia Speaker and Avi Leiner), Haro\u00eb (Madrichim: Maayan Papismedov and David Morsel), Dorot (Madrichim: Hila Michaeli and Natanel Yatziv).\nThe two nominees of dorot are Eline Ohaion and Noam Schiff for the role of worse chanichim.\n\n====Bnei Akiva Switzerland====\nBnei Akiva [[Switzerland]] was founded in 1936. Numerous former Bnei Akiva Switzerland chaverim have made aliya as a result of being in the youth movement. Today,{{When|date=August 2018}} Bnei Akiva Switzerland has more than 120 members in the two chapters ([[snifim]]), in [[Basel]] and [[Zurich]]. [[Geneva]] used to have its own chapter, but was closed by the parent organization in [[Israel]] because of a lack of interested members. Bnei Akiva is the biggest Jewish youth organization in Switzerland. Due to the lack of a Jewish high school in Switzerland, Bnei Akiva fulfills an important role as a regular meeting place. It is a vital entity that allows high-school students, who do not see each other on a daily basis, to stay in contact with their Jewish friends. Every year there are two camps, one in summer and one in winter. Additionally, the two oldest shvatim (\"tribes\") join the Sayarim summer camp (a camp in which usually the oldest shevet of chapters all over Europe take part) on a biannual basis, followed by a four-week Israel trip the following year. A number of Shabbatonim take place throughout the year, such as the Yom Yerushalayim weekend. This snif is known as one of the worst snifim in Europe.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bne-akiwa.ch|title=Bne Akiwa Schweiz - \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e2\u05e7\u05d9\u05d1\u05d0 \u05e9\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05e5|first=M.|last=Fichmann|website=www.bne-akiwa.ch}}</ref>\n\n===Bnei Akiva UK===\nBnei Akiva in the UK was founded in 1939. Its beginnings were closely associated with Bachad and the Torah V'Avodah movement, which both encouraged aliya. [[Arieh Handler]] was the main figure in the early growth of Bnei Akiva, as he brought over children from Nazi Europe on the [[Kindertransport]] and placed them in Bachad Hachshara (preparation) centres. These aimed to prepare the youth to work the Land of Israel on kibbutzim by learning agricultural techniques. The first of these was at Gwrych Castle, which held the first-ever gathering of Bnei Akiva UK in December 1940. After the local Marquis shut down the centre and expelled the Jewish immigrants, other hachshara centres were set up in Bromsgrove, Buckinghamshire and the most famous, [[Thaxted]], [[Essex]].\n\nMany [[Kibbutz]]im, including Lavi and Beit Rimon, were founded by members of BAUK. In modern times, hachshara takes place in Israel and involves two schemes: Torani (the yeshiva and seminary track) and Kivun (giving participants a range of experiences in Israel). Bnei Akiva is the leading provider of gap years to Israel for 18-year-olds in the UK.\n\nNowadays, Bnei Akiva is the largest Jewish youth movement in the country, with more than 1,000 members paying Mas Chaver (membership) each year. It is run by five full-time sabbatical workers who work in the London Bayit, the offices of Bnei Akiva UK. Bnei Akiva also brings over families of shlichim (emissaries) from Israel, one serving as the Bnei Akiva rabbinical couple and one serving the northern communities. The mazkirut and shlichim together with the nivcharim [elected representatives], who are elected by the movement's members each year, form the Hanhalla [governing body]. \n \nBnei Akiva runs 21 svivot (branches) around the UK. They run activities on Shabbat afternoons as well as running Succah Crawls, Family Friday Nights and Shabbatot Ha'Irgun. This year, there are active Bnei Akiva groups in, [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]], [[Borehamwood|Borehamwood & Elstree]], [[Brondesbury Park]], [[Bushey]], [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]], [[Chigwell]], [[Edgware]], [[Finchley]], [[Golders Green]], [[Hale, Greater Manchester|Hale]], [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]], [[Hendon]], [[Leeds]], [[Mill Hill]], [[Muswell Hill]], [[Oxford]], [[Pinner]], [[Radlett]], [[City of Salford|Salford]], [[South Hampstead]], [[South Woodford]], [[Stanmore]], [[Whitefield, Greater Manchester|Whitefield]] and [[Woodside Park (Barnet, London)|Woodside Park]]. \n\nAreas which have previously hosted Svivot include, [[Accrington]], [[Belmont, Harrow|Belmont]], [[Birmingham]], [[Bowdon, Greater Manchester|Bowdon]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Kenton, London|Kenton]], [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury]],  [[Maida Vale]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Redbridge, London|Redbridge]], [[Sheffield]],  [[Southgate, London|Southgate]],  [[Stamford Hill]] and [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]]. The svivot mostly operate in local synagogues, however Bnei Akiva has two purpose-built buildings to house activities in [[Temple Fortune]] in London and Salford.\n\nBnei Akiva runs summer and winter camps (machanot) from school years 3\u201312. The winter camps include Aleph (Years Six & Seven), Ma'apilim (Year Eight), Haroeh (Year Nine), Gimmel (Year Ten) and Hadracha Course (Year Twelve). H-Course is a long-running leadership training camp which gives participants the skills to become the future leaders of the movement.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BATV Yediot News Old Title.png|thumbnail|right|Opening Titles 2011 - 2012]] -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:New title.png|thumbnail|right|Opening Titles 2013 -]] -->\n\nSummer camps include Ari (Years 3-6), Aleph (Year Six), Aleph Chalutzi (Year Seven), Bet Base (Year Eight), Bet Chalutzi (Year Nine) and Gimmel (Year Ten). For Year 11, there is Israel Machane, a three-week-long tour visiting sites in Israel. In 2011, Machane Cadur Regel (Football Camp) ran for years 3\u20135 in partnership with [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]] Football Club. Bnei Akiva also used to run the widely acclaimed Yachad programme, which caters for children with disabilities who want to be involved in camps.\n\nIn addition, there is a Beit Midrash Programme (BMP) which runs in conjunction with the other camps every summer. In recent years, Bnei Akiva has teamed up with Kaytana to run camps for [[Ethiopia]]n children in [[Israel]] and also with Camp Simcha UK to run Keshet camp in [[London]] for children with serious illnesses. More than 1,000 people are involved in Bnei Akiva camps each year, making it the biggest provider of Jewish youth group camps in the UK.\n\nBnei Akiva UK actively supports projects in memory of [[Yoni Jesner]] who was heavily involved with the Glasgow branch of Bnei Akiva. He died from a critical head injury following a suicide bus bombing in Tel-Aviv, Israel.\n\n===Bnei Akiva Mexico===\nBnei Akiva in Mexico was founded in 1948. It is located in [[Mexico City]], with three chapters and one main house, which is the center of activities. There are more than 100 active members in the movement and a large population of non-active members, those who have grown too old for the youth groups, or those who have \"made ''[[Aliya]]''\" (moved to Israel). Bnei Akiva members are involved in community service such as participating in its institutions, studying in [[Jewish day school]]s, [[Hebrew school]]s and [[Yeshiva|Yeshivot]], and participating in ''Chessed'' activities ([[community service]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bneiakivamexico.org|title=\u5feb\u9069\uff01\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u4fbf\u5229\u30b0\u30c3\u30ba|website=www.bneiakivamexico.org|access-date=2019-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914172317/http://bneiakivamexico.org/|archive-date=2017-09-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Bnei Akiva New Zealand===\nBnei Akiva is one of the main Jewish youth movements in New Zealand, with weekly meetings and activities in Auckland and Wellington and national bi-annual camps. Bnei Akiva NZ's goal is to educate Jewish youth with the values of Torah ve'Avodah, combining a deeply rooted association with Israel together with day-to-day life in accordance with traditional Jewish values, and to provide stimulating experiential and informal opportunities for encountering Judaism. Bnei Akiva NZ ensures Jewish continuity and the future of the New Zealand Jewish community. Bnei Akiva New Zealand is a member of the [[Australasian Zionist Youth Council]] (AZYC).Website of Bnei Akiva New Zealand.\n\n===Bnei Akiva of the United States and Canada===\nBnei Akiva of the United States and Canada (known before 1993 as Bnei Akiva of North America) was formed with the 1950 merger between HaShomer HaDati and Bnei Akiva. It has several tiers of organization. At its most basic level, Bnei Akiva operates on a local level with Glilim (cities), which often contain one or more snifim (branches) where youth groups are run on [[Shabbat]]. Most Glilim are run by shlichim, (emissaries) from Israel, usually young couples. The first Bnei Akiva galil in America, technically belonging to HaShomer HaDati, was organized in [[Brooklyn]] by Meir Golombek in 1934, with additional Glilim forming around young leaders throughout the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s at a time when very little Zionist education was available in the United States. The level of activity in any given galil has fluctuated over the years depending on the level of leadership present.\n\nIn 2000, in an attempt to help Glilim that were without their own shlichim, Bnei Akiva of the United States and Canada formally added an additional regional infrastructure, with shlichim appointed to serve in a regional role and coordinate activities in several Glilim. The first such regional shaliach, for the Midwest, was Ilan Frydman.\n\nIn additional to the galil-based organization of Bnei Akiva, a second focus of activities in Bnei Akiva of the US&C are the summer camps, known as Camp Moshava. The first Moshava, in Hightstown, NJ, was established in 1936, with a second one opening in Rolling Prairie, Indiana in 1938 and a third in Bronte, Ontario in 1946. In 1947, a fourth Moshava began operating in Saugos, CA. Camp Stone, the fifth Moshava, began operating as a Bnei Akiva camp in conjunction with Young Israel in 1972. (Stone operated for three years without direct involvement from Bnei Akiva, from 1969-1972) Currently, the New York camp is located in Indian Orchard, PA, the Midwest Moshava moved to Wild Rose, WI, and the Canadian Moshava relocated to Ennismore, Ontario. The California Moshava currently operates out of Running Springs, CA, after a long hiatus following the 1985 sale of their Big Bear, CA, campus. Bnei Akiva also operates local day camps during the summer in New Jersey and Toronto. This follows the first attempt at such a program in Atlanta in the early 1990s. Attendance at Bnei Akiva summer programs is typically larger than participation in Glilim, though many chanichim and madrichim are active in both frameworks.\n\nAdditionally, there are several national programs that are run by Bnei Akiva of the US&C, most notably Mach Hach Baaretz, a six-week tour of Israel following 10th grade which attracts many participants who are not otherwise involved with Bnei Akiva. This program was started in 1972 by members in Los Angeles, and has grown to be one of the most successful and popular programs offered by Bnei Akiva of the United States and Canada. Another program, Machal, which is for graduates of 9th grade, was originally a national program, but is now run out of each camp separately. Various national shabbatonim are run by the national office, including Kenes Manhigei Chevraya Bet (KMCB) which brings together some of the most promising young high school leaders for extra training.\n\nJennifer van Amerongen is currently serving as Merakezet Chinuch (Coordinator of Education). Ariel Shields and Michal Laub are currently serving as Mazkirim Artzi (National Directors of Programming) of Bnei Akiva of the United States and Canada.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Boston====\nBnei Akiva Boston has two active Snifim: Sharon Bnei Akiva in Young Israel of Sharon, and Newton Bnei Akiva (NBA) as a joint program between Congregations Beth El-Atereth Israel and Shaarei Tefillah. Bnei Akiva Boston recommenced activity in September 2007 after a decade-long hiatus. As of 2017, Sharon Bnei Akiva operates its weekly activities on Shabbat afternoons for 2-8th grade children while NBA operates on Shabbat afternoons in the Fall/Spring and Motzei Shabbat in the winter.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Chicago====\nBnei Akiva of Chicago was established in 1935 is one of the largest Glilim in the country. Chicago hosts several local and regional shabbatonim each year. Galil Chicago has four snifim named Saad, Tirat Tzvi, Lakeview and Kfar Tzion. Chaverim from Chicago traditionally attend [[Camp Moshava, Wild Rose, WI]], in the summers, and that Moshava is most associated with Galil Chicago. It is part of the Midwest Region.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Cleveland====\nBnei Akiva Cleveland currently has more than 100 members, counting chanichim and madrichim. The city hosts a number of annual activities, including a Purim Carnival and Sukkot Festival, as well as a number of community programs such as Musicians Towers (prayers led by Bnei Akiva in a nursing home for the major Jewish holidays). The current shlichim in Cleveland are Yosef and Efrat Cashdan, with two additional Bnot Sherut. Members of Bnei Akiva Cleveland typically attend [[Camp Stone]] in the summer, and that camp's headquarters is located in Cleveland. Galil Cleveland is part of the Midwest Region.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Detroit====\nBnei Akiva has been operating in Detroit since 1950. Bnei Akiva has three snifim that meet every Shabbat: at the Young Israel of Oak Park, at the Young Israel of Southfield and at Ohel Moed of Shomrey Emunah in West Bloomfield. Many members of Bnei Akiva of Detroit have moved to Israel, and one former shaliach, [[Otniel Schneller]], previously served in the [[Knesset]]. The current shaliach is Yonatan Edrei, who lives in Oak Park, MI. Galil Detroit is in the Midwest Region, and campers primarily attend Camp Stone.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Hamilton====\nBnei Akiva of Hamilton is currently run by Mazkir Galil Ethan Terazadeh. Contrary to popular belief, Bnei Akiva of Hamilton is not the actual name for this Snif, rather called Bnei Akiva of Narnia.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Los Angeles====\nBnei Akiva Los Angeles (BALA), founded in 1946, is one of the oldest and most active Glilim in North America. BALA has four snifim spread throughout Los Angeles, each named after a prominent religious kibbutz: Snif Lavi (Tarzana), Snif Tirat Tzvi (North Hollywood), Snif Sa'ad (Hancock Park), and Snif Shluchot (Beverly Hills). Each snif holds weekly programming on Shabbatot for chanichim ranging from 2nd through 5th grade. In addition to its four snifim, BALA holds frequent events and programming for Vazach (sixth through eighth grade) and Chevraya Bet (high school). BALA also runs a Manhigut (leadership) program for ninth graders, in which budding Bnei Akiva leaders learn valuable leadership skills in preparation for joining the hadracha staff the following year. After a period of stagnation and low participation in the 2000s, BALA has undergone a significant revival in recent years, thanks in large part to the efforts of beloved former shlichim Eyal Fridman and Toby Tabak, who began their tenure in 2013 and were replaced in 2017 by Hagai and Adina Keisar. BALA will continue its growth in the coming year under the leadership of Mazkirei Galil Eytan Merkin and Naomi Weberman.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Montreal====\nBnei Akiva of Montreal is based in Hebrew Academy, where they have their one branch (snif-\u05e1\u05e0\u05d9\u05e3).

Additional programs are run for college students, and largely focus on a commitment to live in the [[Land of Israel]].\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Philadelphia====\nBnei Akiva of Philadelphia maintains three snifim: Northeast Philadelphia, Lower Merion and Cherry Hill, NJ. Galil Philadelphia prides itself on its dedicated and spirited core of madrichim. It is part of the Mid-Atlantic Region, and hosts a range of exciting activities and Shabbatonim each year while receiving guidance from college-aged bogrim. While the Northeast branch has been in existence for decades, Snif Lower Merion began weekly Shabbat programming in September 2003 under the leadership of Chava Forman.

Bnei Akiva of Silver Spring, also known as BASS, runs biweekly Shabbat programming at [[Kemp Mill, Maryland|Kemp Mill Synagogue]] for grades 3rd-6th as well as special ZA\"CH activities for grades 7th-8th. As the only chapter of Bnei Akiva in the area, BASS is responsible for the annual Yom HaZikaron and Yom Ha'atzmaut Tekes for the Greater Washington area at the [[Melvin J. Berman Hebrew Academy|Berman Hebrew Academy]] as well as other community youth activities. The current Roshei Snif are Aliza Mintz and Noa Ferziger and the current Roshei ZA\"CH and Ariella Wolf and Zachary Goldberg.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of St. Louis====\nBnei Akiva St. Louis was founded in 2008. It has one snif that meets weekly.\n\n====Bnei Akiva of Toronto====\nBnei Akiva of Toronto was started in 1935 and maintains a strong presence in the city. Bnei Akiva of Toronto is known for being the biggest galil in the world outside of Israel. There are four snifim (BAYT, Or Chaim, Shaarei Shamayim, and Kehilla Centre), with more than 100 children attending on [[Shabbat]] afternoon, as well as programming for grades 2-12 and university students (Bogrim) throughout the year. There is also the Bnei Akiva-run camp [[Moshava]] Ennismore just outside Toronto, along with a day camp, Moshava Ba'ir Toronto, run in the city. Toronto houses the only Bnei Akiva [[yeshiva]] outside [[Israel]], Yeshivat Or Chaim with Ulpanat Orot, forms [[Bnei Akiva Schools of Toronto]].

In the past, there have been several other chapters, including Boca Raton, Memphis, Miami, Phoenix, San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle.\n\n====Gap Year Programming====\nFor the 2014-2015 year, Bnei Akiva of the US and Canada launched a seminary and a yeshiva program in Israel called Midreshet Torah V'Avodah and Yeshivat Torah V'Avodah. In the words of the programs' website, www.tvaisrael.org, \"Along with several months of focused in-depth Torah study in an Israeli yeshiva or midrasha setting, TVA will open you up to Eretz Yisrael and Am Yisrael through targeted internships, intense volunteering and service learning, living and working on Kibbutz, exploring pivotal issues facing the future of the Jewish people, rigorous spoken-Hebrew language training, and exciting tiyulim throughout the year. All of these experiences will be infused with rigorous Torah learning while living in apartments in the dynamic community of Katamon in Jerusalem.\"\n\nIn the past, Bnei Akiva operated several other Gap Year programs. Until the 1980s members of BAUS&C participated in Hachshara. In the early 1990s, a program called Midrash Uma'aseh existed and drew many of the most involved members of Bnei Akiva. Since 1982, Bnei Akiva has offered a program called Tochnit Nissan for members studying in Israel during the month of Nissan. Traditionally, this program took place on a kibbutz, though other options are now offered.\n\n====Aliya====\nBnei Akiva of the United States and Canada actively promotes aliya, but the way in which this occurs has changed over the years. Until the 1990s, chanichim were encouraged to make aliya in garinim, or small groups intended to bolster existing communities. These were almost always directed to a Kibbutz Hadati, and fierce debates took place as to whether any other form of aliya was a valid expression of the movement's ideals. Today{{When|date=August 2018}} the push for aliya is more general, with no specific communities or framework in mind. The focus is more on coming to Israel and contributing positively to society in any way.\n\n===Bnei Akiva South Africa===\nBnei Akiva's presence in [[South Africa]] dates back to the 1920s. Today,{{When|date=August 2018}} it is one of the largest active Jewish youth movements in the country. It runs many ''[[Shabbaton]]im'' as well as weekly activities at its various centres on the country. Bnei Akiva runs a month-long annual summer camp in the [[Western Cape]], which is attended by more than 1,000 chanichim (campers) and madrichim (counselors). There is also a winter camp held in different locations each year, and is attended by youth from all over South Africa. The movement also runs many Israel programs throughout the year including MTA, Tafnit, Hadracha Tzeira, Kfar Haroeh and Bema'aleh.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)]]\n*[[Orthodox Judaism]]\n*[[Religious Kibbutz Movement]]\n*[[Religious Zionism]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101223021250/http://www.dianellashule.com/communityX.php?CGID=2]\n*[http://www.yba.org.il] - Yeshivot Bnei Akiva - In Israel (Hebrew)\n*[http://www.afyba.org] - American Friends of Yeshivot Bnei Akiva\n*[http://www.bauk.org]- Bnei Akiva UK (Bnei Akiva of Great Britain and Ireland)\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bneiakiva.org/ Bnei Akiva of the US and Canada]\n*[http://www.worldbneiakiva.org/ World Bnei Akiva]\n \n{{Religious Zionism|state=expanded}}\n{{Jewish Youth and Student Organisations|state=collapsed}}\n{{Organized Jewish Life in the United States|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Youth organizations based in Israel]]\n[[Category:Zionist youth movements]]\n[[Category:Orthodox Judaism]]\n[[Category:Jewish clubs and societies]]\n[[Category:Religious Zionist organizations]]\n[[Category:Jewish organizations established in 1929]]\n", "name_user": "Applebaymedia", "label": "safe", "comment": "I added the exact year of the movements founding", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bnei_Akiva"}

These can be [[Play from scrimmage|plays from scrimmage]] \u2013 passes, runs, [[Punt (gridiron football)|punts]], or [[field goal]] attempts (from either a place kick or a drop kick) \u2013 or free kicks such as kickoffs and fair catch kicks. Substitutions can be made between downs, which allows for a great deal of specialization as [[Coach (sport)|coaches]] choose the players best suited for each particular situation. During a play, each team should have no more than 11 players on the field, and each of them has specific tasks assigned for that specific play.\n\n==Objective of the game==\nThe objective of this game is to score more points than the other team during the allotted time.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Unofficial Beginner's Guide to Football |url=https://files.nyu.edu/rk1193/public/Objectives_Basics_Field.html |accessdate=October 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105020025/https://files.nyu.edu/rk1193/public/Objectives_Basics_Field.html |archivedate=November 5, 2013 }}</ref> The team with the ball (the ''offense'') has 4 plays (''downs'') to advance at least 10 yards, and can score points once they reach the opposite end of the field, which is home to a scoring zone called the ''[[end zone]]'', as well as the goal posts. If the offense succeeds in advancing at least 10 yards, they earn a \"first down\" and the number of tries allotted is reset and then they are again given 4 tries to advance an additional 10 yards, starting from the spot to which they last advanced. If the offense does not advance at least 10 yards during their 4 downs, the team without the ball (the ''defense'') regains control of the ball (called ''[[turnover on downs]]'').\n\nOn offense, points are scored by advancing the ball into the opponent's end zone for a ''[[touchdown]]'' (worth six points), or by kicking the ball from the playing field through the raised vertical posts (the ''goal posts'') which are most commonly situated on the end line of the end zone for a ''[[field goal]]'' (worth three points). After scoring a touchdown, the offense is given an additional opportunity from the 2-yard line (3-yard line in amateur football) to attempt to score (in the NFL, 15-yard line on 1-point conversions). Conversion attempts are used to score 1 or 2 points as follows:\n* The offense may attempt a field goal kick which is worth 1 point.\n* The offense may attempt to re-advance the ball into the opponent's end zone for a ''two-point conversion'' worth 2 points.\n\nWhile the opposing team has possession, the defense attempts to prevent the offense from advancing the ball and scoring. If an offensive player loses the ball during play (a ''[[fumble]]'') or the ball is caught by a defensive player while still in the air (an ''interception''), the defense may attempt to run into the offense's end zone for a touchdown. The defense may also score points by tackling the ball carrier in the offense's own end zone, called a ''[[Safety (gridiron football score)|safety]]'' (which is worth two points).\n\n==Time of play==\nCollegiate and professional football games are 60 minutes long, divided into four quarters of 15 minutes each. In high school football, 12 minute quarters are usually played. The clock is stopped frequently, however, with the result that a typical college or professional game can exceed three hours in duration. The referee controls the game clock and stops the clock after any incomplete pass or any play that ends out of bounds. In addition, each team is allowed 3 [[Time-out (sport)|timeouts]] in each half that they may use at their own discretion. The clock normally runs during the action of plays, with a few exceptions known as [[untimed play]]s. Some high schools employ a [[mercy rule]] in which the clock runs continuously after one team's lead over the other achieves a certain number of points. In these instances, the clock only stops for injuries, or time outs called by a team or a referee.\n\nThe clock may also be stopped for an officials' time-out, after which, if the clock was running, it is restarted. For example: if there is a question whether or not a team has moved the ball far enough for a first down, the officials may use a measuring device (''the chains'') to determine the distance. While this measurement is taking place, the officials will signal for a stoppage of the clock. Once the measurement is finished and the ball is placed at the proper location (''spotted''), the referee will then signal for the clock to restart. Additional situations where officials may take a time-out are to administer a penalty or for an injured player to be removed from the field.\n\nIn addition to the game clock, a separate ''play clock'' is also used. This counts down the time the offense has to start the next play before it is assessed a penalty for delay of game (see below). This clock is typically 25 seconds from when the referee marks the ball ready for play. The [[National Football League|NFL]] and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] use a 40-second play clock that starts immediately after the previous play ends, though for certain delays, such as penalty enforcement, the offense has 25 seconds from when the ball is marked ready. The purpose of the play clock is to ensure that the game progresses at a consistent pace, preventing unnecessary delays. Overall, [[clock management]] is a significant part of the game; teams leading toward the end of the game will often try to [[Running out the clock|run out the clock]], while trailing teams attempt the opposite.\n\nOfficials also call for media time-outs, which allow time for television and radio advertising. They also stop the clock after a change of possession of the ball from one team to the other. Successful PATs (Point(s) After Touchdown), a field goal try, or a kickoff may also warrant stopping the clock. If an instant replay challenge is called during the game, the referees signal for a media time out. The referee signals these media time-outs by first using the time out signal, then extending both arms in a horizontal position.\n\nTeams change ends of the field at the end of the first quarter and the end of the third quarter, though otherwise the situation on the field regarding possession, downs remaining and distance-to-goal does not change at these occasions (so a team with possession 5 yards from the opponent's endzone at the end of the first quarter would resume play 5 yards from the endzone at the other end of the field, which they would then be attacking). Separating the first and second halves is ''halftime.'' Both halves, and any overtime, begin with [[Kick-off (American football)|kick-offs]] \u2014 the kicking team is decided by a [[#Coin toss|coin toss]] (see below).\n\nIn the NFL, an automatic timeout is called by the officials when there are two minutes left in both the second and the fourth quarters, and overtime; this is most commonly referred to as the ''two-minute warning.'' No such warning is normally given in amateur football, though if there is no visible stadium clock, the referee will give a two-minute warning (four minutes in high school).\n\n==Overtime==\n\n===NFL===\nIf a game is tied at the end of four quarters, ''[[Overtime (sports)#National Football League|overtime]]'' is played. In overtime, a coin toss is used to determine which team will possess the ball first. The winner of the coin toss can choose to give the ball or receive the ball. If the first possession results in a touchdown (by the receiving team or by the defensive team on a turnover) or a safety, the scoring team wins. If the receiving team fails to score and loses possession, the game goes into sudden death and first to score wins.\n\nHowever if the initial receiving team only scores a field goal, the game is not automatically over and the other team is given an opportunity to possess the ball as well. The other team can win with a touchdown, tie with a field goal leading to sudden death or lose if they fail to score.\n\nDuring the regular season in the NFL, one overtime period is played (with each team receiving two time outs). If both teams are tied after the 10-minute overtime, the game officially ends in a tie. Before the {{NFL year|2017}} season, there was a 15-minute overtime. In the playoffs, 15-minute overtime periods continue until a winner is determined. Overtime follows a three-minute intermission after the end of the regulation game. Prior to start of overtime, a coin flip is performed in which the captain of the visiting team calls the toss. The team that wins the coin flip has the option either to receive the kickoff or choose the side of the field they wish to defend. Ties are rare in the NFL;<ref name=2013tie>{{cite news |title= Vikings, Packers Play To Tie |date= November 23, 2013 |agency= Associated Press |publisher= ESPN |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=331124009 }}</ref> a game between the [[Arizona Cardinals]] and [[Detroit Lions]] on September 8, 2019, ended in a 27&ndash;all draw.

Under the prior rules, the team that won the coin toss would usually elect to receive the ball, then gain just enough yardage to win the game by kicking a field goal without the other team ever touching the ball. The coin toss winner won approximately 60% of overtime games under that rule.  In practical effect the \"coin toss\" (and neither the plays called; or, the players of the team) were determining the winner of the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/sports/football/06overtime.html|title=N.F.L.\u2019s New Overtime Rule Means Extra Choices|first=Judy|last=Battista|date=December 9, 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe first overtime game played under a trial of the new overtime rules occurred in the [[2011\u201312 NFL playoffs#AFC: Denver Broncos 29.2C Pittsburgh Steelers 23 .28OT.29|2011\u20132012 NFL AFC Wildcard Playoff game]] between the [[Denver Broncos]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] at [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]], [[Denver]], Colorado.

In the NFC title game, the [[New Orleans Saints]] won the coin toss but an interception allowed the [[Los Angeles Rams]] to drive into range to kick the winning field goal. In the AFC Championship held later that day, the [[New England Patriots]] won the coin toss and on their first drive scored the winning touchdown over the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].<ref name=\"ftw.usatoday.com\"/><ref name=\"bleacherreport.com\"/>\n\n====NFL Europa====\n[[NFL Europe|NFL Europa]], a defunct league run by the NFL, used a 10-minute overtime period, with the constraint that each team must have the opportunity of possession; once both teams have had such an opportunity, the overtime proceeds in a manner similar to the NFL's. Thus, if Team A has the first possession of overtime and scores a touchdown and converts their kick (thus being 7 points ahead of Team B), Team A would then kick off to Team B (In the NFL, the game would have ended with the touchdown, without a conversion being attempted). Team B would have to match or exceed the 7 point difference within this ensuing possession; exceeding it would end the game immediately, while matching the difference would result in a kickoff to Team A. From this point, the overtime is sudden death. The defunct [[United Football League (2009\u201312)|United Football League]] had also used this rule.\n\n===World Football League===\nThe defunct [[World Football League]], in its first season of 1974, used an overtime system more analogous to the system long used in international [[Association football|soccer]]. The overtime consisted of one 15-minute period, which was played in its entirety and divided into two halves of 7\u00bd minutes each, with each half starting with a kickoff by one of the teams. The league changed to the NFL's sudden-death format for its final season in 1975.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wfl.charlottehornetswfl.com/pages_wfl/rule_changes.php|title=WFL Rule Changes|access-date=2017-12-27}}</ref>\n\n===College and high school===\nIn college and high school football, an overtime procedure (the ''Kansas plan'') ensures that each team has equal opportunity to score. In college, both teams are granted possession of the ball at their opponents' 25 yard-line in succession; the procedure repeats for next three possessions if needed; all possessions thereafter will be from the opponent's 3-yard line. A coin flip takes place, with the winning team having the option either 1) to declare that they will take the ball first or second, or 2) to decide on which end of the field the series will occur (both teams' series occur on the same end of the field). The losing team will have the first option in any subsequent even-numbered overtime. In the first overtime, the team with first series attempts to score either a touchdown or a field goal; their possession ends when either a touchdown or a field goal have been scored, they turn the ball over via a fumble or an interception, or they fail to gain a first down. After a touchdown, a team may attempt either an extra-point or a two-point conversion. However, if the team on defense during the first series recovers a fumble and returns it for a touchdown, or returns an interception for a touchdown, the defensive team wins the game. (This is the only way for a college overtime game to end without both teams having possession.) Otherwise, regardless of the outcome of the first team's series (be it touchdown, field goal, or turnover), the other team begins their series. If the score remains tied after both teams have completed a series, the procedure is repeated. If the score remains tied after double overtime, teams scoring touchdowns are required to attempt a two-point conversion for next two overtime periods. Just as in regulation, if a defensive team recovers a fumble/returns an interception to the end zone during a two-point conversion attempt, they will receive two points. Starting in 2019, if the game is still tied after four overtime periods, each team attempts one 2-point conversion per period rather than getting the ball at the 25-yard line.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shapiro |first1=Michael |title=How Does College Football Overtime Work? 2019 Rule Changes, Explained |url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2019/college-football-overtime-rules-explained-changes |website=SI.com |publisher=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=19 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn high school football, individual state associations can choose any overtime format they want, or even elect to not play overtime at all (ties stand in this case). However, most states use the Kansas Plan. In a majority of states, each team is granted possession of the ball at the 10-yard line, meaning that a team cannot make a first down without scoring except via a defensive penalty that carries an automatic first down (such as defensive [[pass interference]] or roughing the passer). As is the case with the college overtime rule, the team that wins the coin toss will have the choice as to whether to take the ball first or second, or decide at which end of the field the overtime will be played. The other major difference between overtime in college football and high school football is that in some states, if the defense forces a turnover, the ball is dead immediately, thus eliminating the possibility of scoring. However, in [[Texas]], the college overtime rule is used, as both the [[University Interscholastic League]], which governs interscholastic activities for Texas public high schools, and the [[Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools]], the largest analogous body for Texas private high schools, play by NCAA football rules with a few modifications for the high school level.\n\n===XFL===\nThe original incarnation of the [[XFL (2001)|XFL]] used a modified Kansas Plan which, upon the first team scoring, required the opponent to score the same or greater number of points in the same or fewer downs (i.e., if the first team scored a touchdown, and converted the one-point conversion in three downs, the opponent would have to match that touchdown and conversion in three downs as well). Each team started at the 20-yard line, but like high school, there were no opportunities for first downs. The league also banned field goals except on a fourth down.\n\nThe [[XFL (2020)|XFL's current incarnation]] uses a five-round [[penalty shootout|shootout]] of two-point conversions similar to a penalty shootout in soccer or ice hockey. Such a shootout had never been attempted in organized football at the time the rule was proposed; in April 2019, the [[NCAA]] adopted a similar concept for games that reach a fifth overtime starting with the [[2019 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2019 FBS season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/04/07/spring-league-returns-with-revolutionary-overtime-idea/|title=Spring League returns with revolutionary overtime idea|last=Florio|first=Mike|date=April 7, 2019|work=Profootballtalk.com|accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Greg |title=Targeting protocols approved for football |url=http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/targeting-protocols-approved-football |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=July 11, 2019}}</ref> The defense is not able to score, as should a turnover occur, the play would be dead.<ref name=\"XFL Rules\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.xfl.com/rules|title=XFL Rules|website=XFL.com|language=en|access-date=January 7, 2020}}</ref> Defensive penalties result in the ball moving up to the 1-yard line, while a second defensive penalty on any play, even in future rounds, result in a score awarded to the offensive team. To speed up the overtime process, both teams' offense and defense are on the field at the appropriate end zone. Once one team's offense has completed its round of the shootout, the other team's offense plays its round from the opposite end zone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/26478796|title=XFL to have 3-point tries, 2-point OT shootouts|date=April 9, 2019|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref> These overtime rules ensure that both teams have an opportunity to win the game and would limit overtime to 5 or 6 minutes.

The winner of the toss may defer their choice to the start of the second half, or they may take first choice of:\n# Receiving the kickoff to start the game, or kicking off to start the game\n# Choosing an end of the field to defend in the first quarter (with the teams switching directions at the end of the first quarter and at the end of the third quarter)\nThe loser of the toss gets the remaining option.\n\nAt the start of the second half, the team that did not choose first (either because they deferred their choice or because they lost the toss) gets the first choice of options.\n\nAccording to ''USA Today'', in college games, the team that wins the toss defers their choice to the start of the second half over 90% of the time.<ref>{{cite news | title=Coin toss switch tops list of NFL rule changes | url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2008-04-02-rule-changes_N.htm | first=Jarrett | last=Bell | newspaper=[[USA Today]] | date=April 2, 2008 | accessdate=September 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIf a game goes to overtime, a coin toss is held before the start of overtime, but tosses are not held before the start of subsequent overtime periods. In college, for example, the loser of the toss to start overtime has first choice in the second overtime period. The choices available to the captains in overtime vary among the NFL, college, and various states' high school rules.\n\nIn high school, the coin toss may be held between the captains or coaches earlier before the start of the game. At three minutes before kickoff, the captains meet for a simulated coin toss, where the referee announces the results of the earlier toss.\n\n====XFL====\nThe [[XFL (2001)|original incarnation of the XFL]] did not implement a coin toss; instead an event took place called the \"opening scramble\", in which one player from each team fought to recover a football 20 yards away to determine possession. Both players lined up side-by-side on one of the 30-yard lines, with the ball being placed at the 50-yard line. At the whistle, the two players would run toward the ball and attempt to gain possession; whichever player gained possession first was allowed to choose possession (as if he had won a coin toss in other leagues).\n\nThe [[XFL (2020)|XFL's current incarnation]] also does not feature coin tosses. Instead, the home team is given the option to kick off, receive, select a goal, or defer to the second half. In the event of overtime, the visiting team is given the choice of going first or second or selecting which end zone to attack (with the home team getting the other choice).\n\n===Downed player===\nThe rules vary from the college level to the professional level. In the NFL, unless a player is tagged by an opposing player or gives himself up, he is not down. A player carrying the ball (the runner) is '''downed''' when any of the following occurs:\n* Any part of the runner other than his hands or feet touches the ground. Ankles and wrists count as downed. This may be as a result of:\n** Contact by an opponent (called '''down by contact''') where the opponent ''tackles'' the runner by pushing him, grasping him and pulling him to the ground, sliding into his legs, or touching him in any manner prior to any part of the runner other than his hands or feet touching the ground. Unlike the use of the word ''tackle'' in other sports, if the opposing player fails to down the ball carrier, it is merely an ''attempted tackle.'' If the ball carrier falls onto another player but he doesn't make contact with the ground, he can still get up and keep playing. A player on the ground is not considered part of the ground.\n** Intentionally downing the ball: intentionally [[quarterback kneel|kneeling]], verbally declaring \"I'm down\" (except in college), or similar actions. For example, to protect himself from violent hits by opponents attempting to tackle him, the quarterback may choose to slide to the ground feet-first. This slide is interpreted as intentionally downing the ball, and opponents may then be penalized for hitting him.\n** In amateur football, a runner is downed when any part of his body other than his hands or feet touches the ground at any time (unless he is the holder for a place kick). In professional football, the runner is not down for such accidental contact; he must be down by contact with an opponent as described above.\n* The runner goes out of bounds: that is, any part of his body (including his hands or feet) touches the ground, or anything other than another player or an official, on or past a sideline or an endline. The sideline itself is out of bounds, so that the runner is deemed out of bounds if he steps on or touches any part of it. A runner may carry the ball in such a manner that it is over the sideline, so long as the ball or runner does not touch anything out of bounds.\n* The runner's forward progress toward the opponents' goal line is stopped by contact with an opponent, with little chance to be resumed. The exact moment at which the player's forward progress stops is subject to the judgment of the officials. In particular, for the protection of the quarterback, he is considered down as soon as an official judges that he is in the grasp of an opponent behind the line of scrimmage, and the tackling defensive player(s) will be awarded with a [[quarterback sack|sack]]. If he is driven backward by the opponent, the ball will be spotted where his forward progress was stopped.\n\n==Scrimmage downs==\nThe majority of a football game takes place on plays, or ''downs'', that begin at the line of scrimmage. The officials ''spot'' the ball (place it in a designated spot on the field) on the line of scrimmage and declare it ready for play.\n\n===Positions===\n{{Main|American football positions}}\nThe width of the spotted football defines the width of the [[Neutral zone (gridiron football)|neutral zone]], an area of the field no player other than the snapper may position himself in or above before the snap. Each team has its own line of scrimmage, thought of as a vertical plane from sideline to sideline that passes through the point of the ball nearest its own goal line.\n\n[[File:American Football Positions2.png|right|thumb|300px|A formation at the line of scrimmage. Offensive players are marked by O symbols, defensive players by X symbols. This diagram shows two of the most common formations, the offense is in the [[I formation]] while the defense is in the [[4\u20133 defense|4\u20133 formation]]. There are many different formations the players may take.]]\n\nA typical offense is made up of a [[quarterback]], five [[Lineman (gridiron football)|offensive linemen]], two [[wide receiver]]s, a [[running back]], a [[Fullback (gridiron football)|fullback]], and a [[tight end]], however teams will vary their personnel on the field to fit any given play. A quarterback is essentially the leader of the offense. It is most often their responsibility to pass along the play called to the rest of the players in the huddle before any given play. A quarterback is the primary ball handler on offense. It is their responsibility to call the snap count for the ball to enter play. Once the ball is hiked into play, it is their job to either hand the ball off to one of their running backs, or scout the field for an open receiver to throw the ball to. In some instances, the quarterback will run the ball themselves. A quarterback is guarded by their offensive linemen. The offensive line is made up of a left and right [[Tackle (gridiron football position)|tackle]], a left and right [[Guard (American and Canadian football)|guard]], and a [[Center (gridiron football)|center]]. It is the center's responsibility to hike the ball to the quarterback. An offensive line has two different jobs. When the offense runs a pass play, it is their job to guard the quarterback from the defense that are rushing. When the offense runs a run play, it is their job to clear a path for the running back to run through. The running back also has multiple roles. They will either take the ball from the quarterback and run, move up and help the offensive line block, or go out and catch a pass. While the role of the fullback is deteriorating currently among professional leagues, it is their primary responsibility to lead the running back. Running backs and fullbacks are sometimes also called a halfback, a wingback, or a slotback. Like the running back, the tight end also has multiple roles. They will either help the offensive line protect the quarterback, block on run plays, or run or catch the ball themselves. The wide receivers primary role is to run out into the field of play and catch the ball, although they will also block in some instances.\n\nThe players on offense must arrange themselves in a [[Formation (American football)|formation]], all behind their [[line of scrimmage]] (that is, on their side of the ball). For reasons of safety and competitive balance, there are strict rules which define the way in which the offensive players may line up. Seven players must line up directly on the line of scrimmage while four players line up behind the line of scrimmage. Within this formation, there are six [[eligible receiver]]s who may receive a [[forward pass]] during play. These eligible receivers are either the running back, fullback, tight end, or wide receivers. The remaining five linemen, often called ''interior linemen'' do not normally handle the ball during a play. Because of these rules, various leagues of American football have enacted strict rules of uniform numbering so officials may more easily judge which players were eligible and which were not at the start of a play. For example, in [[college football]], ineligible players wear numbers 50\u201379, while eligible receivers wear 1\u201349 or 80\u201399. Even within this structure, offenses can still present a wide number of formations, so long as they maintain the \"seven and four\" arrangement. Receivers, for example, may play close to the other linemen or they may play some distance down the line of scrimmage, where they would sometimes be called split ends. Of the four backs, they may play behind the linemen, or may play \"split out\" to provide additional wide receivers. These additional receivers can be flankers (if they play split far wide, but still in the backfield) or slot receivers if they play in the \"slot\" between the split end and the rest of the offensive line.\n\nThe players on defense may arrange themselves in any manner, as long as all players are \"behind the line\" (that is, on the side of the line nearest their own end zone). Players who line up opposite the offensive line are called [[Lineman (gridiron football)#Defensive line|defensive linemen]], usually with one or two [[defensive tackle]]s in the middle (a single defensive tackle is often called the nose guard or nose tackle) and with one [[defensive end]] on each side. A defensive lineman's job is typically to put pressure on the opposing team's quarterback by rushing the offensive line. The defensive line is also most often the first set of players the opponent must get through should they choose to run the ball. Behind the linemen are the [[linebacker]]s. A linebackers job can be any number of things, including trying to rush the opposing team's quarterback, stopping the opponents running back on run plays, or covering the opponents tight end or wide receivers. Positioned opposite the wide receivers are the [[cornerback]]s. Their primary responsibility is to cover the wide receivers. Farthest back from the line are the [[Safety (gridiron football position)|safeties]], usually in the middle of the field behind the linebackers. The safeties are the last line of defense against the opponent. Like a linebacker, a safety's role can vary, however their most common role is to help the cornerbacks cover the opponent's wide receivers, which is called \"double coverage\". The linemen and linebackers close to the line of scrimmage, are often referred to as playing \"in the box\". Players outside \"the box\" (usually cornerbacks and safeties) are collectively referred to as the \"secondary\".\n\n===Starting the down===\nA scrimmage down begins with a ''snap'', where the center throws or hands the ball backward to one of the backs, usually the quarterback. The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a back, throws the ball, or runs with it himself. The down ends when the ball becomes dead (see below). The ball is typically next spotted where the ball became dead; however, if it became dead outside the hash marks, it is brought in on the same yard line to the nearest hash mark. This spot becomes the line of scrimmage for the next play. In the case of an incomplete forward pass, the ball is returned to the spot where it was last snapped to begin the next play. A fumbled ball that goes out of bounds is declared dead and possession remains with the team that most recently had control of the ball.\n\n===Dead ball===\nThe ball becomes dead, and the down ends, when:\n* the ball carrier is downed, as described above;\n* a forward pass falls incomplete (it touches the ground before possession is secured by a player);\n* the ball carrier or ball touches the sideline or end line or otherwise goes outside the field of play (\"out of bounds\");\n* the ball carrier or the ball, except on a scoring field goal attempt, hits any part of the goalpost (even if it bounces back onto the field);\n* a team scores;\n* a kick receiver makes a [[fair catch]] (waving his arm above his head to signal a fair catch, where the kicking team is not allowed to interfere with him or hit him after the catch, but in return he is not allowed to run), or a member of the receiving team gains possession after a fair catch signal was given;\n* a member of the kicking team possesses a kicked ball beyond the line of scrimmage (e.g. \"downing\" a punt allowed to roll by the receiving team by holding it to stop its roll);\n* a kicked ball comes to rest;\n* a [[touchback]] occurs; or\n* under NFL or college rules, on fourth down (or, in the NFL, on any down after the two-minute warning in either half/overtime), a ball fumbled forward by the offensive team is recovered by an offensive team player other than the fumbler.\n\nThe nearest official typically blows his whistle after the ball becomes dead to alert the players that the down has already ended. If the ball is alive and the official sounds an ''inadvertent whistle'', then the ball still becomes dead, but the team in possession of the ball may elect to have the down replayed or take the spot where the ball was declared dead. If the ball was loose from a fumble, then the ball can be put into play at the spot of the fumble. If the ball was in flight from a kick or a pass, then the down is always replayed.\n\n==Free kick downs==\nA '''free kick''' is a down which does not occur from scrimmage. The kicking team begins behind the ball, while the receiving team must remain at least 10 yards downfield before the ball is kicked.\n\n===Kickoffs===\nA kickoff is a type of free kick where the ball is placed on a [[Tee#Kicking tee|tee]] (or held) at the kicking team's 35-yard line (40 for high school). In the 2011 NFL Season, changes were made regarding kickoffs to limit injuries. Kickoffs were returned from the 30-yard line to the 35-yard line, repealing a 1994 rule change. In addition, players on the kickoff coverage team (apart from the kicker) cannot line up more than a specified distance behind the kickoff line. This distance is 5 yards at most levels of the game and 1 yard in the NFL, minimizing running starts and thus reducing the speed of collisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81ee38c1/article/nfl-moves-kickoffs-to-35yard-line-touchbacks-unchanged|title=NFL moves kickoffs to 35 yard line; touchbacks unchanged|accessdate=August 15, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Breech 2018-05-22\">{{cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-kickoffs-will-be-undergoing-these-major-rule-changes-for-2018/ |title=NFL kickoffs will be undergoing these major rule changes for 2018 |last=Breech |first=John |date=May 22, 2018 |website=CBSSports.com |accessdate= May 22, 2018}}</ref> The kicking team's players may not cross this line until the ball is kicked; members of the non-kicking (or \"receiving\") team are similarly restrained behind a line 10 yards further downfield (the 45-yard line, or 50 for high school). A valid kickoff must travel at least this 10-yard distance to the receiving team's restraining line, after which any player of either team may catch or pick up the ball and try to advance it (a member of the kicking team may only recover a kickoff and may not advance it) before being downed (see \"Downed player,\" below). In most cases, the ball is kicked as far as possible (typically 40 to 70 yards), after which a player of the receiving team is usually able to secure possession (since the members of the kicking team cannot start downfield until after the ball is kicked). Occasionally, for tactical reasons, the kicking team may instead choose to attempt an '''onside kick''', in which the kicker tries to kick the ball along the ground just over the required 10-yard distance in such a manner that one of his own teammates can recover the ball for the kicking side. If it is touched before ten yards, the ball is dead and a re-kick or spot of the ball will be rewarded to the receiving team.\n\n====Receiving a kickoff====\nA member of the receiving team gaining possession of the ball on a kickoff may attempt to advance it as far as he can toward the kicking team's goal line before being downed. Once the ball carrier is downed, the play is whistled dead and the ball is placed by the officials at the point where the play ended; this spot then becomes the [[line of scrimmage]] for the ensuing play. A kick that travels through or goes out of bounds within the end zone without being touched, or is caught by the receiving team in the end zone but not advanced out of it, results in a touchback; the ball is then placed at the receiving team's 25-yard line, which becomes the line of scrimmage. In college football only, a fair catch by the receiving team between its own 25-yard line and goal line is treated as a touchback, with the ball placed at the 25.\n\nA kickoff that goes out of bounds anywhere other than the end zone before being touched by the receiving team is an illegal kick: the receiving team has the option of having the ball re-kicked from five yards closer to the kicking team's goal line, or they may choose to take possession of the ball at the point where it went out of bounds or 30 yards from the point of the kick (25 yards in high school, and in college {{as of|2012|lc=y}}), whichever is more advantageous.\n\n===Other free kicks===\nA free kick is also used to restart the game following a safety. The team that was trapped in its own end zone, therefore conceding two points to the other team, kicks the ball from its own 20-yard line. This can be a place kick (in the NFL, a tee cannot be used), drop kick or punt.\n\nIn the NFL and high school, a free kick may be taken on the play immediately after a [[fair catch]]; see \"fair catch kick\" below.\n\n==Scoring==\n===Scrimmage plays and kickoffs===\nMost standard football plays are considered '''scrimmage plays,''' initiated from a line of scrimmage. Exceptions are kickoffs and try plays (below). Although similar rules apply during a try play, the number of points awarded for each score differs on a try play.\n\n====Touchdown (6 points)====\n{{Main|Touchdown}}\nA touchdown is earned when a player has legal possession of the ball and the ball touches or goes over the imaginary vertical plane above the opposing team's goal line. After a touchdown, the scoring team attempts a try play for 1 or 2 points (see below). A successful touchdown is signaled by an official extending both arms vertically above the head. A touchdown is worth six points, except in the defunct [[World Football League|WFL]] where it was worth seven points.\n\nFor statistical purposes, the player who advances the ball into or catches it in the end zone is credited with the touchdown. If a forward pass was thrown on the play, the throwing player is also credited with a passing touchdown.\n\n====Field goal (3 points)====\n{{Main|Field goal}}\nA field goal is scored when the ball is place kicked, drop kicked, or free kicked after a fair catch or awarded fair catch (High School or NFL only) between the goal posts behind the opponent's end zone. The most common type of kick used is the place kick. For a place kick, the ball must first be snapped to a placeholder, who holds the ball upright on the ground with his fingertip so that it may be kicked. Three points are scored if the ball crosses between the two upright posts and above the crossbar and remains over. If a field goal is missed, the ball is returned to the original line of scrimmage (in the NFL, to the spot of the kick; in high school, to the 20-yard line if the ball enters the end zone, or otherwise where the ball becomes dead after the kick) or to the 20-yard line if that is further from the goal line, and possession is given to the other team. If the ball does not go out of bounds, the other team may catch the kicked ball and attempt to advance it, but this is usually not advantageous. One official is positioned under each goalpost; if either one rules the field goal no good, then the field goal is unsuccessful. A successful field goal is signaled by an official extending both arms vertically above the head. A team that successfully kicks a field goal kicks off to the opposing team on the next play.\n\n====Safety (2 points)====\n{{Main|Safety (gridiron football score)}}\nThe uncommon '''safety''' is scored if a player causes the ball to become dead in his own end zone; two points are awarded to the opposing (usually defending) team. This can happen if a player is either downed or goes out of bounds in the end zone while carrying the ball, or if he fumbles the ball, and it goes out of bounds in the end zone. A safety is also awarded to the defensive team if the offensive team commits a foul which is enforced in its own end zone. A safety is ''not'' awarded if a player intercepts a pass or receives a kick in his own end zone and is downed there. This situation, in which the opponent caused the ball to enter the end zone, is called a [[touchback]]; no points are scored, and the team that gained possession of the ball is awarded possession at its own 25-yard line. If the interception or reception occurs outside the end zone, and the player is carried into the end zone by momentum, the ball is placed at the spot of the catch and no safety is awarded. A safety is signaled by a referee holding both palms together above the head, fingertips pointing upwards. After a safety, the team that conceded the safety kicks a free kick (which may be a punt, place kick, or drop kick) from its 20-yard line.\n\n===Try plays===\nA '''try play''' (as opposed to a regular '''scrimmage play''' or kickoff), more commonly referred to as an '''extra-point attempt,''' '''PAT''' (abbreviation of \"point after touchdown\"), '''conversion attempt,''' or '''two-point conversion attempt''', based on the scoring team's intentions on the play, is awarded to the scoring team immediately following a touchdown. This un-timed down is an opportunity to score additional points.<ref>{{cite book  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = 2007 Official Rules of the NFL  | publisher = Triumph Books  | date = October 1, 2007  | location =   | pages =   | url = https://archive.org/details/2007officialplay0000nati  | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 978-1-60078-028-8  | url-access = registration  }}</ref>\n\n* Although the game clock is not advanced during a try play, the play clock is enforced. A delay of game penalty, false start, or similar penalty, by the offense results in a 5-yard penalty assessed for the try. Typically, penalties charged against the defense give the offensive two options: half the distance to the goal for the try, or assessing the full penalty on the ensuing kickoff. Since the try is not timed by the game clock, if a touchdown is scored as regulation time expires (and game clock subsequently reads 0:00.0), the try is still allowed to be conducted. After the [[Minneapolis Miracle]] in 2018, the NFL implemented a rule that if a team scores on the final play of the game, and extra points would not change the result, the PAT will no longer be conducted.\n\n====Extra point (field goal - 1 point)====\nThe offensive team may attempt to kick the ball through the goalposts, in the same manner that a field goal is kicked during a scrimmage play. In the NFL, the ball is spotted at the 15-yard line. In college and high school, the ball is spotted at the 3-yard line. If successful, the team is awarded 1 point, referred to as an [[Conversion (gridiron football)|extra point]]. This option is almost always chosen, because a two-point conversion attempt is much riskier. Since the extra point is almost always successful, sportscasters will often refer to a team up or trailing by seven (not six) points as being \"up/trailing by a touchdown\".\n\n====Two-point conversion (touchdown - 2 points)====\nThe offensive team may attempt to advance the ball via run or pass into the end zone, much like a touchdown on the extra-point attempt, except that it receives two points. This is called a '''[[two-point conversion]]'''. If the offense elects to attempt a two-point conversion on the try play, the ball is spotted at the 2-yard line in the NFL and on 3-yard line for college and high school. The success rate for two-point conversions is about 48 percent<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-nfl-teams-are-going-for-two-just-as-they-should-be/|title=More NFL Teams Are Going For Two \u2014 Just As They Should Be|first=Chase|last=Stuart|date=November 15, 2016|publisher=}}</ref> in the NFL, making the two-point conversion attempt a risky tactic; thus it is usually attempted only when two points will help the team but one point will not.\n* For example, suppose that it is late in the game with a score of 21\u201310 and the losing team scores a touchdown, making the score 21\u201316. The scoring team will usually attempt the two-point conversion, because if successful, a three-point deficit later could be matched with one field goal; failure to convert would result in a five-point deficit that could be surmounted with another touchdown \u2013 a situation no worse than the four-point deficit achieved with a kicked extra point.\n* Another example would be if a team scores a late-game touchdown, and as a result is down by two points. A successful two-point conversion would tie the game, and likely force overtime. In very rare and risky instances, a trailing team who scored a touchdown, and as a result is down by 1 point, may attempt a two-point conversion to gamble on a win and avoid overtime (or, under NCAA or NFHS rules, a subsequent overtime period). Two famous examples of this gamble were by [[1983 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] in the last minute of the [[1984 Orange Bowl]] (unsuccessful) and by [[2006 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State]] in the first overtime of the [[2007 Fiesta Bowl]] (successful). Under NCAA rules, teams are required to \"go for two\" starting with the third overtime procedure.\n\n=====Defensive conversion=====\nUnder college and NFL rules, if the defensive team gains possession and advances the ball the length of the field into the opposite end zone on the try play (via interception or a fumble recovery, or by blocking a kick and legally recovering the ball), they score two points. This is officially recorded as a '''defensive conversion''' scored by the defense. The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] adopted this rule in 1988; the NFL added this in 2015.\n* This scenario cannot occur under [[National Federation of State High School Associations|high school football]] rules; the ball is ruled dead and the try is over immediately when the defense gains possession.\n\n====Safety (1 point)====\nA safety scored on a try play is worth one point. This can occur when, for example, the defense gains control of the ball and advances it into the field of play, but then retreats into its own end zone when play is stopped. Similarly, the defense could recover a fumble in its own end zone before play is stopped. A safety on a try play could also be awarded to the defense if the defense takes possession of the ball during a try play, advances it all the way down to the opposite end of the field, where the offensive team then regains possession before the play is declared dead in that end zone.\n\n====Officials signals on try plays====\nThe officials' signal for a successful try, whether an extra point or a two-point conversion, is the same as for a touchdown. The officials' signal for a safety on a try play is also the same as on a scrimmage play.\n\nAfter the try, the team that scored the touchdown kicks off to the opposing team. Unlike a safety that occurs on a scrimmage play, no free kick is awarded following a safety on a try play.\n\n====Try play rules in overtime====\nDuring sudden-death overtime, particularly in the NFL, if a team scores a touchdown in the overtime period, the game is immediately over, and the try is not attempted.\n\nIn NCAA overtime, if the second team to possess the ball in the overtime scores a touchdown which puts them ahead of the opponent in points the game ends immediately and no try is attempted.\n\n===Fair catch kick===\n{{Main|Fair catch kick}}\nA free kick (see above) may be taken on the play immediately after any fair catch of a punt. In the NFL, if the receiving team elects to attempt this and time expired during the punt, the half/overtime is extended with an untimed down. The ball must be held on the ground by a member of the kicking team or drop kicked; a tee may not be used. (High school kickers may use a tee). This is both a field goal attempt and a free kick; if the ball is kicked between the goal posts, three points are scored for the kicking team. This is the only case where a free kick may score points. This method of scoring is extremely rare, last successfully completed in the NFL by [[Ray Wersching]] in 1976. It is only advantageous when a team catches a very short punt with very little time left. A team is unlikely to be punting with only a few seconds left in a half or overtime, and it is rarer still for punts to be caught near field goal range. The officials' signal for a successful fair catch kick is the same as for a field goal.\n\n====Defunct leagues====\n* In the [[World Football League|WFL]], PAT's were called \"Action Points\" and could '''only''' be scored via a run or pass play (as opposed to by kick as in the NFL), and were worth one point. The ball was placed on the two-and-a-half -yard line for an Action Point. This rule was a revival of a 1968 preseason experiment by the NFL and [[American Football League]]. The [[XFL (2001)|XFL's first incarnation]] employed a similar rule in which teams ran a single offensive down from the two-yard line (functionally identical to the NFL/NCAA/CFL two-point conversion), also for one point. By the playoffs, two-point and three-point conversions had been added to the rules. Teams could opt for the bonus points by playing the conversion farther back from the goal line. This rule remains intact in the [[XFL (2020)|current XFL]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/04/08/xfl-to-use-one-two-three-point-conversions/|title=XFL to use one-, two-, three-point conversions|last=Florio|first=Mike|date=April 8, 2019|website=ProFootballTalk|language=en|access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Officiating==\n{{Main|Official (American football)}}\nThe game is officiated by a crew of three to seven officials. Every crew will consist of a ''referee'', who is generally in charge of the game and watches action on the quarterback and in the offensive backfield; an ''umpire'', who handles spotting the ball and watches action on the offensive line; and a ''head linesman'', who supervises placement of the down box and line-to-gain chains. The crew may also consist of a ''line judge'', ''back judge'', ''field judge'' and ''side judge'', in the order listed: i.e. a crew of five officials has a referee, umpire, head linesman, line judge and back judge.\n\nOfficials are selected by the teams in advance or appointed by the governing league. While the majority of officials at lower levels only officiate games on a part-time basis, the NFL is implementing a new system where seven officials will become full-time employees of the league, one for each official position (i.e. back judge, field judge, side judge, etc.).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000110332/article/carl-johnson-named-nfls-first-fulltime-game-official|title=Carl Johnson named NFL's first full-time game official|publisher=}}</ref> In the other three major North American professional sports leagues \u2013 [[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and [[National Hockey League|NHL]] \u2013 officials are employed by their respective leagues. The sheer volume of games in the other three sports necessitates full-time officials; the NFL regular season is only 16 games long, compared to 162 games for MLB and 82 for the NBA and NHL.\n\nDuring the game, the officials are assisted in the administration of the game by other persons, including: a ''clock operator'' to start and stop the game clock (and possibly also the play clock); a [[chain crew]] who hold the ''down indicator'' and the ''line-to-gain chains'' on the sideline; and ''ball boys'', who provide footballs to officials between downs (e.g. a dry ball each down on a wet day). These individuals may be provided by the teams involved \u2013 it is common for a high school coach's son or daughter to act as ball boy for the team.\n\n==Fouls and their penalties==\n{{Main|Penalty (American football)}}\nBecause football is a high-[[contact sport]] requiring a balance between offense and defense, many rules exist that regulate equality, safety, contact, and actions of players on each team. It is very difficult to always avoid violating these rules without giving up too much of an advantage. Thus, an elaborate system of fouls and penalties has been developed to \"let the punishment fit the crime\" and maintain a balance between following the rules and keeping a good flow of the game. Players are constantly looking for ways to find an advantage that stretches the limitations imposed by the rules. Also, the frequency and severity of fouls can make a large difference in the outcome of a game, so coaches are constantly looking for ways to minimize the number and severity of infractions committed by their players.\n\nIt is a common misconception that the term \"penalty\" is used to refer both to an infraction and the penal consequence of that infraction. A ''foul'' is a rule infraction for which a penalty is prescribed.<ref>NCAA Rule 2-9</ref> Some of the more common fouls are listed below. In most cases when a foul occurs, the offending team will be assessed a penalty of 5, 10 or 15 yards, depending on the foul. Also, in most cases, if the foul is committed while the ball is in play, the down will be replayed from the new position (for example, if the offense commits a foul on a first-down play, the next play will still be first down, but the offense may have to go 15 yards, or farther, to achieve another first down.) But if a defensive foul results in the ball advancing beyond the offense's first-down objective, the next play will be the first down of a new series. Some penalties (typically for more serious fouls), however, require a loss of down for the offense; and some defensive fouls may result in an automatic first down regardless of the ball position.\n\nIn all cases (except for ejection of a player or, in rare cases, forfeiture of the game), the non-offending team is given the option of declining the penalty and letting the result of the play stand (although the Referee may exercise this option on their behalf when it is obvious), if they believe it to be more to their advantage. For some fouls by the defense, the penalty is applied in addition to the yardage gained on the play. Most '''personal fouls''', which involve danger to another player, carry 15-yard penalties; in rare cases, they result in offending players being ejected from the game. In the NFL, if a defensive foul occurs after time has expired at the end of a half, the half will be continued for a single, untimed play from scrimmage. Under college rules, any accepted penalty when time has expired at the end of any quarter results in an extension for one untimed down.\n\nIn the NFL, with three exceptions, no penalty may move the ball more than half the distance toward the penalized team's goal line. These exceptions are defensive pass interference (see the discussion of that foul for more details), intentional grounding, and offensive holding \u2013 but in this last case the exception pertains only if the infraction occurs within the offensive team's own end zone, in which case an automatic safety is assessed (intentional grounding from the end zone also carries an automatic safety). Under college rules, the same half-the-distance principle applies, but any offensive fouls involving contact in their end zone (e.g. holding, illegal blocking or personal fouls) result in a safety.\n\n:The '''neutral zone''' is the space between the two free-kick lines during a free-kick down and between the two scrimmage lines during a scrimmage down. For a free-kick down, the neutral zone is 10 yards wide and for a scrimmage down it is as wide as the length of the football. It is established when the ball is marked ready for play. No player may legally be in the neutral zone except for the snapper on scrimmage downs, and no one except the kicker and the holder for free kick downs.\n\n==Timeouts==\nEach team receives three [[Time-out (sport)#Gridiron football|timeouts]] per half (if the game goes to overtime, each team receives additional timeouts), making for a total of six timeouts per team in a regulation game. Unused timeouts may not carry over to the second half or overtime. In professional football, a team must have at least one remaining timeout to challenge an official's call.\n\n==Instant replay==\n{{Main|Replay review in gridiron football}}\n\nIn the NFL, a number of rulings can be reviewed by officials or challenged by coaches. If a coach wants to challenge a play, he must do so before the next play begins, and he does so by throwing a red flag similar to the officials' yellow flags. Coaches are allowed two challenges per game and are granted a third if their first two are successful. The team loses a timeout if they lose the challenge. Therefore, they cannot challenge if they do not have timeouts. Plays within the two-minute-warning and overtime cannot be challenged; any review must be initiated by a replay official off-field. The referee performs the actual review via a video screen on the sideline. The referee will announce the result of instant replay reviews over his wireless microphone.\n\nBeginning in the 2011 NFL Season, an instant replay review by the booth official will now be automatic for every play ruled by the referees on the field to have scored points. This is seen as another step in the \"modernization\" of sports. Every scoring play will be reviewed now, which saves coaches from using up their challenges on close plays in the endzone.<ref>{{cite web|title=What You Need To Know About The New NFL Rule Changes \u2013 2011|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/nfl-rule-changes-primer-2011-3}}</ref> And since the 2012 season, the booth official also reviews all turnovers during the game.\n\nIn college, coaches are allowed one challenge per game by first requesting a timeout. Otherwise, a replay official in the press box observes all plays. If he deems a ruling may be in error, he notifies the officials on the field to interrupt the game before the beginning of the next play. The replay official performs the review and relays the decision to the referee, who announces the result. Not every conference employs replay, which is optional.\n\nHigh school rules generally do not provide for video review of any decisions by officials during a game. By state adoption, replay may be used in a state championship game. At all times, the use of television or video tape for coaching purposes during the game is prohibited. If a coach feels a rule has been misinterpreted, he may call timeout and request a coach-referee conference to ''discuss'' the ruling with the referee, but no replay equipment will be consulted during the conference.\n\n==Major rule differences between NFL and college football==\nSome of the major rule differences between NFL and college football include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;\n!

The team leading after both possessions is declared the winner. If the teams remain tied, another overtime is played.

These can be [[Play from scrimmage|plays from scrimmage]] \u2013 passes, runs, [[Punt (gridiron football)|punts]], or [[field goal]] attempts (from either a place kick or a drop kick) \u2013 or free kicks such as kickoffs and fair catch kicks. Substitutions can be made between downs, which allows for a great deal of specialization as [[Coach (sport)|coaches]] choose the players best suited for each particular situation. During a play, each team should have no more than 11 players on the field, and each of them has specific tasks assigned for that specific play.\n\n==Objective of the game==\nThe objective of this game is to score more points than the other team during the allotted time.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Unofficial Beginner's Guide to Football |url=https://files.nyu.edu/rk1193/public/Objectives_Basics_Field.html |accessdate=October 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105020025/https://files.nyu.edu/rk1193/public/Objectives_Basics_Field.html |archivedate=November 5, 2013 }}</ref> The team with the ball (the ''offense'') has 4 plays (''downs'') to advance at least 10 yards, and can score points once they reach the opposite end of the field, which is home to a scoring zone called the ''[[end zone]]'', as well as the goal posts. If the offense succeeds in advancing at least 10 yards, they earn a \"first down\" and the number of tries allotted is reset and then they are again given 4 tries to advance an additional 10 yards, starting from the spot to which they last advanced. If the offense does not advance at least 10 yards during their 4 downs, the team without the ball (the ''defense'') regains control of the ball (called ''[[turnover on downs]]'').\n\nOn offense, points are scored by advancing the ball into the opponent's end zone for a ''[[touchdown]]'' (worth six points), or by kicking the ball from the playing field through the raised vertical posts (the ''goal posts'') which are most commonly situated on the end line of the end zone for a ''[[field goal]]'' (worth three points). After scoring a touchdown, the offense is given an additional opportunity from the 2-yard line (3-yard line in amateur football) to attempt to score (in the NFL, 15-yard line on 1-point conversions). Conversion attempts are used to score 1 or 2 points as follows:\n* The offense may attempt a field goal kick which is worth 1 point.\n* The offense may attempt to re-advance the ball into the opponent's end zone for a ''two-point conversion'' worth 2 points.\n\nWhile the opposing team has possession, the defense attempts to prevent the offense from advancing the ball and scoring. If an offensive player loses the ball during play (a ''[[fumble]]'') or the ball is caught by a defensive player while still in the air (an ''interception''), the defense may attempt to run into the offense's end zone for a touchdown. The defense may also score points by tackling the ball carrier in the offense's own end zone, called a ''[[Safety (gridiron football score)|safety]]'' (which is worth two points).\n\n==Time of play==\nCollegiate and professional football games are 60 minutes long, divided into four quarters of 15 minutes each. In high school football, 12 minute quarters are usually played. The clock is stopped frequently, however, with the result that a typical college or professional game can exceed three hours in duration. The referee controls the game clock and stops the clock after any incomplete pass or any play that ends out of bounds. In addition, each team is allowed 3 [[Time-out (sport)|timeouts]] in each half that they may use at their own discretion. The clock normally runs during the action of plays, with a few exceptions known as [[Untimed play|untimed plays]]. Some high schools employ a [[mercy rule]] in which the clock runs continuously after one team's lead over the other achieves a certain number of points. In these instances, the clock only stops for injuries, or time outs called by a team or a referee.\n\nThe clock may also be stopped for an officials' time-out, after which, if the clock was running, it is restarted. For example: if there is a question whether or not a team has moved the ball far enough for a first down, the officials may use a measuring device (''the chains'') to determine the distance. While this measurement is taking place, the officials will signal for a stoppage of the clock. Once the measurement is finished and the ball is placed at the proper location (''spotted''), the referee will then signal for the clock to restart. Additional situations where officials may take a time-out are to administer a penalty or for an injured player to be removed from the field.\n\nIn addition to the game clock, a separate ''play clock'' is also used. This counts down the time the offense has to start the next play before it is assessed a penalty for delay of game (see below). This clock is typically 25 seconds from when the referee marks the ball ready for play. The [[National Football League|NFL]] and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] use a 40-second play clock that starts immediately after the previous play ends, though for certain delays, such as penalty enforcement, the offense has 25 seconds from when the ball is marked ready. The purpose of the play clock is to ensure that the game progresses at a consistent pace, preventing unnecessary delays. Overall, [[clock management]] is a significant part of the game; teams leading toward the end of the game will often try to [[Running out the clock|run out the clock]], while trailing teams attempt the opposite.\n\nOfficials also call for media time-outs, which allow time for television and radio advertising. They also stop the clock after a change of possession of the ball from one team to the other. Successful PATs (Point(s) After Touchdown), a field goal try, or a kickoff may also warrant stopping the clock. If an instant replay challenge is called during the game, the referees signal for a media time out. The referee signals these media time-outs by first using the time out signal, then extending both arms in a horizontal position.\n\nTeams change ends of the field at the end of the first quarter and the end of the third quarter, though otherwise the situation on the field regarding possession, downs remaining and distance-to-goal does not change at these occasions (so a team with possession 5 yards from the opponent's endzone at the end of the first quarter would resume play 5 yards from the endzone at the other end of the field, which they would then be attacking). Separating the first and second halves is ''halftime.'' Both halves, and any overtime, begin with [[Kick-off (American football)|kick-offs]] \u2014 the kicking team is decided by a [[#Coin toss|coin toss]] (see below).\n\nIn the NFL, an automatic timeout is called by the officials when there are two minutes left in both the second and the fourth quarters, and overtime; this is most commonly referred to as the ''two-minute warning.'' No such warning is normally given in amateur football, though if there is no visible stadium clock, the referee will give a two-minute warning (four minutes in high school).\n\n==Overtime==\n\n===NFL===\nIf a game is tied at the end of four quarters, ''[[Overtime (sports)#National Football League|overtime]]'' is played. In overtime, a coin toss is used to determine which team will possess the ball first. The winner of the coin toss can choose to give the ball or receive the ball. If the first possession results in a touchdown (by the receiving team or by the defensive team on a turnover) or a safety, the scoring team wins. If the receiving team fails to score and loses possession, the game goes into sudden death and first to score wins.\n\nHowever if the initial receiving team only scores a field goal, the game is not automatically over and the other team is given an opportunity to possess the ball as well. The other team can win with a touchdown, tie with a field goal leading to sudden death or lose if they fail to score.\n\nDuring the regular season in the NFL, one overtime period is played (with each team receiving two time outs). If both teams are tied after the 10-minute overtime, the game officially ends in a tie. Before the {{NFL year|2017}} season, there was a 15-minute overtime. In the playoffs, 15-minute overtime periods continue until a winner is determined. Overtime follows a three-minute intermission after the end of the regulation game. Prior to start of overtime, a coin flip is performed in which the captain of the visiting team calls the toss. The team that wins the coin flip has the option either to receive the kickoff or choose the side of the field they wish to defend. Ties are rare in the NFL;<ref name=2013tie>{{cite news |title= Vikings, Packers Play To Tie |date= November 23, 2013 |agency= Associated Press |publisher= ESPN |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=331124009 }}</ref> a game between the [[Arizona Cardinals]] and [[Detroit Lions]] on September 8, 2019, ended in a 27&ndash;all draw.

Under the prior rules, the team that won the coin toss would usually elect to receive the ball, then gain just enough yardage to win the game by kicking a field goal without the other team ever touching the ball. The coin toss winner won approximately 60% of overtime games under that rule.  In practical effect the \"coin toss\" (and neither the plays called; or, the players of the team) were determining the winner of the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/sports/football/06overtime.html|title=N.F.L.\u2019s New Overtime Rule Means Extra Choices|first=Judy|last=Battista|date=December 9, 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> \n\nThe first overtime game played under a trial of the new overtime rules occurred in the [[2011\u201312 NFL playoffs#AFC: Denver Broncos 29.2C Pittsburgh Steelers 23 .28OT.29|2011\u20132012 NFL AFC Wildcard Playoff game]] between the [[Denver Broncos]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] at [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]], [[Denver]], Colorado.

Thus, if Team A has the first possession of overtime and scores a touchdown and converts their kick (thus being 7 points ahead of Team B), Team A would then kick off to Team B (In the NFL, the game would have ended with the touchdown, without a conversion being attempted). Team B would have to match or exceed the 7 point difference within this ensuing possession; exceeding it would end the game immediately, while matching the difference would result in a kickoff to Team A. From this point, the overtime is sudden death. The defunct [[United Football League (2009\u201312)|United Football League]] had also used this rule.\n\n===World Football League===\nThe defunct [[World Football League]], in its first season of 1974, used an overtime system more analogous to the system long used in international [[Association football|soccer]]. The overtime consisted of one 15-minute period, which was played in its entirety and divided into two halves of 7\u00bd minutes each, with each half starting with a kickoff by one of the teams. The league changed to the NFL's sudden-death format for its final season in 1975.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wfl.charlottehornetswfl.com/pages_wfl/rule_changes.php|title=WFL Rule Changes|access-date=2017-12-27}}</ref>\n\n===College and high school===\nIn college and high school football, an overtime procedure (the ''Kansas plan'') ensures that each team has equal opportunity to score. In college, both teams are granted possession of the ball at their opponents' 25 yard-line in succession; the procedure repeats for next three possessions if needed; all possessions thereafter will be from the opponent's 3-yard line. A coin flip takes place, with the winning team having the option either 1) to declare that they will take the ball first or second, or 2) to decide on which end of the field the series will occur (both teams' series occur on the same end of the field). The losing team will have the first option in any subsequent even-numbered overtime. In the first overtime, the team with first series attempts to score either a touchdown or a field goal; their possession ends when either a touchdown or a field goal have been scored, they turn the ball over via a fumble or an interception, or they fail to gain a first down. After a touchdown, a team may attempt either an extra-point or a two-point conversion. However, if the team on defense during the first series recovers a fumble and returns it for a touchdown, or returns an interception for a touchdown, the defensive team wins the game. (This is the only way for a college overtime game to end without both teams having possession.) Otherwise, regardless of the outcome of the first team's series (be it touchdown, field goal, or turnover), the other team begins their series. If the score remains tied after both teams have completed a series, the procedure is repeated. If the score remains tied after double overtime, teams scoring touchdowns are required to attempt a two-point conversion for next two overtime periods. Just as in regulation, if a defensive team recovers a fumble/returns an interception to the end zone during a two-point conversion attempt, they will receive two points. Starting in 2019, if the game is still tied after four overtime periods, each team attempts one 2-point conversion per period rather than getting the ball at the 25-yard line.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shapiro |first1=Michael |title=How Does College Football Overtime Work? 2019 Rule Changes, Explained |url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2019/college-football-overtime-rules-explained-changes |website=SI.com |publisher=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=19 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn high school football, individual state associations can choose any overtime format they want, or even elect to not play overtime at all (ties stand in this case). However, most states use the Kansas Plan. In a majority of states, each team is granted possession of the ball at the 10-yard line, meaning that a team cannot make a first down without scoring except via a defensive penalty that carries an automatic first down (such as defensive [[pass interference]] or roughing the passer). As is the case with the college overtime rule, the team that wins the coin toss will have the choice as to whether to take the ball first or second, or decide at which end of the field the overtime will be played. The other major difference between overtime in college football and high school football is that in some states, if the defense forces a turnover, the ball is dead immediately, thus eliminating the possibility of scoring. However, in [[Texas]], the college overtime rule is used, as both the [[University Interscholastic League]], which governs interscholastic activities for Texas public high schools, and the [[Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools]], the largest analogous body for Texas private high schools, play by NCAA football rules with a few modifications for the high school level.\n\n===XFL===\nThe original incarnation of the [[XFL (2001)|XFL]] used a modified Kansas Plan which, upon the first team scoring, required the opponent to score the same or greater number of points in the same or fewer downs (i.e., if the first team scored a touchdown, and converted the one-point conversion in three downs, the opponent would have to match that touchdown and conversion in three downs as well). Each team started at the 20-yard line, but like high school, there were no opportunities for first downs. The league also banned field goals except on a fourth down.\n\nThe [[XFL (2020)|XFL's current incarnation]] uses a five-round [[penalty shootout|shootout]] of two-point conversions similar to a penalty shootout in soccer or ice hockey. Such a shootout had never been attempted in organized football at the time the rule was proposed; in April 2019, the [[NCAA]] adopted a similar concept for games that reach a fifth overtime starting with the [[2019 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2019 FBS season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/04/07/spring-league-returns-with-revolutionary-overtime-idea/|title=Spring League returns with revolutionary overtime idea|last=Florio|first=Mike|date=April 7, 2019|work=Profootballtalk.com|accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Greg |title=Targeting protocols approved for football |url=http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/targeting-protocols-approved-football |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=July 11, 2019}}</ref> The defense is not able to score, as should a turnover occur, the play would be dead.<ref name=\"XFL Rules\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.xfl.com/rules|title=XFL Rules|website=XFL.com|language=en|access-date=January 7, 2020}}</ref> Defensive penalties result in the ball moving up to the 1-yard line, while a second defensive penalty on any play, even in future rounds, result in a score awarded to the offensive team. To speed up the overtime process, both teams' offense and defense are on the field at the appropriate end zone. Once one team's offense has completed its round of the shootout, the other team's offense plays its round from the opposite end zone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/26478796|title=XFL to have 3-point tries, 2-point OT shootouts|date=April 9, 2019|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref> These overtime rules ensure that both teams have an opportunity to win the game and would limit overtime to 5 or 6 minutes.

Haney flips the coin at the Pro Bowl.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Cecil D. Haney]] flips the coin at the [[2013 Pro Bowl]].]]\n\n===Coin toss===\nThree minutes before the start of the game, the referee meets with captains from both teams for a coin toss. The visiting team calls the toss. The winner of the toss may defer their choice to the start of the second half, or they may take first choice of:\n# Receiving the kickoff to start the game, or kicking off to start the game\n# Choosing an end of the field to defend in the first quarter (with the teams switching directions at the end of the first quarter and at the end of the third quarter)\nThe loser of the toss gets the remaining option.\n\nAt the start of the second half, the team that did not choose first (either because they deferred their choice or because they lost the toss) gets the first choice of options.\n\nAccording to ''USA Today'', in college games, the team that wins the toss defers their choice to the start of the second half over 90% of the time.<ref>{{cite news | title=Coin toss switch tops list of NFL rule changes | url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2008-04-02-rule-changes_N.htm | first=Jarrett | last=Bell | newspaper=[[USA Today]] | date=April 2, 2008 | accessdate=September 28, 2010}}</ref> \n\nIf a game goes to overtime, a coin toss is held before the start of overtime, but tosses are not held before the start of subsequent overtime periods. In college, for example, the loser of the toss to start overtime has first choice in the second overtime period. The choices available to the captains in overtime vary among the NFL, college, and various states' high school rules.\n\nIn high school, the coin toss may be held between the captains or coaches earlier before the start of the game. At three minutes before kickoff, the captains meet for a simulated coin toss, where the referee announces the results of the earlier toss.\n\n====XFL====\nThe [[XFL (2001)|original incarnation of the XFL]] did not implement a coin toss; instead an event took place called the \"opening scramble\", in which one player from each team fought to recover a football 20 yards away to determine possession. Both players lined up side-by-side on one of the 30-yard lines, with the ball being placed at the 50-yard line. At the whistle, the two players would run toward the ball and attempt to gain possession; whichever player gained possession first was allowed to choose possession (as if he had won a coin toss in other leagues).\n\nThe [[XFL (2020)|XFL's current incarnation]] also does not feature coin tosses. Instead, the home team is given the option to kick off, receive, select a goal, or defer to the second half. In the event of overtime, the visiting team is given the choice of going first or second or selecting which end zone to attack (with the home team getting the other choice).\n\n===Downed player===\nThe rules vary from the college level to the professional level. In the NFL, unless a player is tagged by an opposing player or gives himself up, he is not down. A player carrying the ball (the runner) is '''downed''' when any of the following occurs:\n* Any part of the runner other than his hands or feet touches the ground. Ankles and wrists count as downed. This may be as a result of:\n** Contact by an opponent (called '''down by contact''') where the opponent ''tackles'' the runner by pushing him, grasping him and pulling him to the ground, sliding into his legs, or touching him in any manner prior to any part of the runner other than his hands or feet touching the ground. Unlike the use of the word ''tackle'' in other sports, if the opposing player fails to down the ball carrier, it is merely an ''attempted tackle.'' If the ball carrier falls onto another player but he doesn't make contact with the ground, he can still get up and keep playing. A player on the ground is not considered part of the ground.\n** Intentionally downing the ball: intentionally [[quarterback kneel|kneeling]], verbally declaring \"I'm down\" (except in college), or similar actions. For example, to protect himself from violent hits by opponents attempting to tackle him, the quarterback may choose to slide to the ground feet-first. This slide is interpreted as intentionally downing the ball, and opponents may then be penalized for hitting him.\n** In amateur football, a runner is downed when any part of his body other than his hands or feet touches the ground at any time (unless he is the holder for a place kick). In professional football, the runner is not down for such accidental contact; he must be down by contact with an opponent as described above.\n* The runner goes out of bounds: that is, any part of his body (including his hands or feet) touches the ground, or anything other than another player or an official, on or past a sideline or an endline. The sideline itself is out of bounds, so that the runner is deemed out of bounds if he steps on or touches any part of it. A runner may carry the ball in such a manner that it is over the sideline, so long as the ball or runner does not touch anything out of bounds.\n* The runner's forward progress toward the opponents' goal line is stopped by contact with an opponent, with little chance to be resumed. The exact moment at which the player's forward progress stops is subject to the judgment of the officials. In particular, for the protection of the quarterback, he is considered down as soon as an official judges that he is in the grasp of an opponent behind the line of scrimmage, and the tackling defensive player(s) will be awarded with a [[quarterback sack|sack]]. If he is driven backward by the opponent, the ball will be spotted where his forward progress was stopped.\n\n==Scrimmage downs==\nThe majority of a football game takes place on plays, or ''downs'', that begin at the line of scrimmage. The officials ''spot'' the ball (place it in a designated spot on the field) on the line of scrimmage and declare it ready for play.\n\n===Positions===\n{{Main|American football positions}}\nThe width of the spotted football defines the width of the [[Neutral zone (gridiron football)|neutral zone]], an area of the field no player other than the snapper may position himself in or above before the snap. Each team has its own line of scrimmage, thought of as a vertical plane from sideline to sideline that passes through the point of the ball nearest its own goal line.\n\n[[File:American Football Positions2.png|right|thumb|300px|A formation at the line of scrimmage. Offensive players are marked by O symbols, defensive players by X symbols. This diagram shows two of the most common formations, the offense is in the [[I formation]] while the defense is in the [[4\u20133 defense|4\u20133 formation]]. There are many different formations the players may take.]]\n\nA typical offense is made up of a [[quarterback]], five [[Lineman (gridiron football)|offensive linemen]], two [[Wide receiver|wide receivers]], a [[running back]], a [[Fullback (gridiron football)|fullback]], and a [[tight end]], however teams will vary their personnel on the field to fit any given play. A quarterback is essentially the leader of the offense. It is most often their responsibility to pass along the play called to the rest of the players in the huddle before any given play. A quarterback is the primary ball handler on offense. It is their responsibility to call the snap count for the ball to enter play. Once the ball is hiked into play, it is their job to either hand the ball off to one of their running backs, or scout the field for an open receiver to throw the ball to. In some instances, the quarterback will run the ball themselves. A quarterback is guarded by their offensive linemen. The offensive line is made up of a left and right [[Tackle (gridiron football position)|tackle]], a left and right [[Guard (American and Canadian football)|guard]], and a [[Center (gridiron football)|center]]. It is the center's responsibility to hike the ball to the quarterback. An offensive line has two different jobs. When the offense runs a pass play, it is their job to guard the quarterback from the defense that are rushing. When the offense runs a run play, it is their job to clear a path for the running back to run through. The running back also has multiple roles. They will either take the ball from the quarterback and run, move up and help the offensive line block, or go out and catch a pass. While the role of the fullback is deteriorating currently among professional leagues, it is their primary responsibility to lead the running back. Running backs and fullbacks are sometimes also called a halfback, a wingback, or a slotback. Like the running back, the tight end also has multiple roles. They will either help the offensive line protect the quarterback, block on run plays, or run or catch the ball themselves. The wide receivers primary role is to run out into the field of play and catch the ball, although they will also block in some instances.\n\nThe players on offense must arrange themselves in a [[Formation (American football)|formation]], all behind their [[line of scrimmage]] (that is, on their side of the ball). For reasons of safety and competitive balance, there are strict rules which define the way in which the offensive players may line up. Seven players must line up directly on the line of scrimmage while four players line up behind the line of scrimmage. Within this formation, there are six [[eligible receiver]]s who may receive a [[forward pass]] during play. These eligible receivers are either the running back, fullback, tight end, or wide receivers. The remaining five linemen, often called ''interior linemen'' do not normally handle the ball during a play. Because of these rules, various leagues of American football have enacted strict rules of uniform numbering so officials may more easily judge which players were eligible and which were not at the start of a play. For example, in [[college football]], ineligible players wear numbers 50\u201379, while eligible receivers wear 1\u201349 or 80\u201399. Even within this structure, offenses can still present a wide number of formations, so long as they maintain the \"seven and four\" arrangement. Receivers, for example, may play close to the other linemen or they may play some distance down the line of scrimmage, where they would sometimes be called split ends. Of the four backs, they may play behind the linemen, or may play \"split out\" to provide additional wide receivers. These additional receivers can be flankers (if they play split far wide, but still in the backfield) or slot receivers if they play in the \"slot\" between the split end and the rest of the offensive line.\n\nThe players on defense may arrange themselves in any manner, as long as all players are \"behind the line\" (that is, on the side of the line nearest their own end zone). Players who line up opposite the offensive line are called [[Lineman (gridiron football)#Defensive line|defensive linemen]], usually with one or two [[defensive tackle]]s in the middle (a single defensive tackle is often called the nose guard or nose tackle) and with one [[defensive end]] on each side. A defensive lineman's job is typically to put pressure on the opposing teams quarterback by rushing the offensive line. The defensive line is also most often the first set of players the opponent must get through should they choose to run the ball. Behind the linemen are the [[Linebacker|linebackers]]. A linebackers job can be any number of things, including trying to rush the opposing teams quarterback, stopping the opponents running back on run plays, or covering the opponents tight end or wide receivers. Positioned opposite the wide receivers are the [[cornerback]]s. Their primary responsibility is to cover the wide receivers. Farthest back from the line are the [[Safety (gridiron football position)|safeties]], usually in the middle of the field behind the linebackers. The safeties are the last line of defense against the opponent. Like a linebacker, a safety's role can vary, however their most common role is to help the cornerbacks cover the opponent's wide receivers, which is called \"double coverage\". The linemen and linebackers close to the line of scrimmage, are often referred to as playing \"in the box\". Players outside \"the box\" (usually cornerbacks and safeties) are collectively referred to as the \"secondary\".\n\n===Starting the down===\nA scrimmage down begins with a ''snap'', where the center throws or hands the ball backward to one of the backs, usually the quarterback. The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a back, throws the ball, or runs with it himself. The down ends when the ball becomes dead (see below). The ball is typically next spotted where the ball became dead; however, if it became dead outside the hash marks, it is brought in on the same yard line to the nearest hash mark. This spot becomes the line of scrimmage for the next play. In the case of an incomplete forward pass, the ball is returned to the spot where it was last snapped to begin the next play. A fumbled ball that goes out of bounds is declared dead and possession remains with the team that most recently had control of the ball.\n\n===Dead ball===\nThe ball becomes dead, and the down ends, when:\n* the ball carrier is downed, as described above;\n* a forward pass falls incomplete (it touches the ground before possession is secured by a player);\n* the ball carrier or ball touches the sideline or end line or otherwise goes outside the field of play (\"out of bounds\");\n* the ball carrier or the ball, except on a scoring field goal attempt, hits any part of the goalpost (even if it bounces back onto the field);\n* a team scores;\n* a kick receiver makes a [[fair catch]] (waving his arm above his head to signal a fair catch, where the kicking team is not allowed to interfere with him or hit him after the catch, but in return he is not allowed to run), or a member of the receiving team gains possession after a fair catch signal was given;\n* a member of the kicking team possesses a kicked ball beyond the line of scrimmage (e.g. \"downing\" a punt allowed to roll by the receiving team by holding it to stop its roll);\n* a kicked ball comes to rest;\n* a [[touchback]] occurs; or\n* under NFL or college rules, on fourth down (or, in the NFL, on any down after the two-minute warning in either half/overtime), a ball fumbled forward by the offensive team is recovered by an offensive team player other than the fumbler.\n\nThe nearest official typically blows his whistle after the ball becomes dead to alert the players that the down has already ended. If the ball is alive and the official sounds an ''inadvertent whistle'', then the ball still becomes dead, but the team in possession of the ball may elect to have the down replayed or take the spot where the ball was declared dead. If the ball was loose from a fumble, then the ball can be put into play at the spot of the fumble. If the ball was in flight from a kick or a pass, then the down is always replayed.\n\n==Free kick downs==\nA '''free kick''' is a down which does not occur from scrimmage. The kicking team begins behind the ball, while the receiving team must remain at least 10 yards downfield before the ball is kicked.\n\n===Kickoffs===\nA kickoff is a type of free kick where the ball is placed on a [[Tee#Kicking tee|tee]] (or held) at the kicking team's 35-yard line (40 for high school). In the 2011 NFL Season, changes were made regarding kickoffs to limit injuries. Kickoffs were returned from the 30-yard line to the 35-yard line, repealing a 1994 rule change. In addition, players on the kickoff coverage team (apart from the kicker) cannot line up more than a specified distance behind the kickoff line. This distance is 5 yards at most levels of the game and 1 yard in the NFL, minimizing running starts and thus reducing the speed of collisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81ee38c1/article/nfl-moves-kickoffs-to-35yard-line-touchbacks-unchanged|title=NFL moves kickoffs to 35 yard line; touchbacks unchanged|accessdate=August 15, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Breech 2018-05-22\">{{cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-kickoffs-will-be-undergoing-these-major-rule-changes-for-2018/ |title=NFL kickoffs will be undergoing these major rule changes for 2018 |last=Breech |first=John |date=May 22, 2018 |website=CBSSports.com |accessdate= May 22, 2018}}</ref> The kicking team's players may not cross this line until the ball is kicked; members of the non-kicking (or \"receiving\") team are similarly restrained behind a line 10 yards further downfield (the 45-yard line, or 50 for high school). A valid kickoff must travel at least this 10-yard distance to the receiving team's restraining line, after which any player of either team may catch or pick up the ball and try to advance it (a member of the kicking team may only recover a kickoff and may not advance it) before being downed (see \"Downed player,\" below). In most cases, the ball is kicked as far as possible (typically 40 to 70 yards), after which a player of the receiving team is usually able to secure possession (since the members of the kicking team cannot start downfield until after the ball is kicked). Occasionally, for tactical reasons, the kicking team may instead choose to attempt an '''onside kick''', in which the kicker tries to kick the ball along the ground just over the required 10-yard distance in such a manner that one of his own teammates can recover the ball for the kicking side. If it is touched before ten yards, the ball is dead and a re-kick or spot of the ball will be rewarded to the receiving team.\n\n====Receiving a kickoff====\nA member of the receiving team gaining possession of the ball on a kickoff may attempt to advance it as far as he can toward the kicking team's goal line before being downed. Once the ball carrier is downed, the play is whistled dead and the ball is placed by the officials at the point where the play ended; this spot then becomes the [[line of scrimmage]] for the ensuing play. A kick that travels through or goes out of bounds within the end zone without being touched, or is caught by the receiving team in the end zone but not advanced out of it, results in a touchback; the ball is then placed at the receiving team's 25-yard line, which becomes the line of scrimmage. In college football only, a fair catch by the receiving team between its own 25-yard line and goal line is treated as a touchback, with the ball placed at the 25. \n\nA kickoff that goes out of bounds anywhere other than the end zone before being touched by the receiving team is an illegal kick: the receiving team has the option of having the ball re-kicked from five yards closer to the kicking team's goal line, or they may choose to take possession of the ball at the point where it went out of bounds or 30 yards from the point of the kick (25 yards in high school, and in college {{as of|2012|lc=y}}), whichever is more advantageous.\n\n===Other free kicks===\nA free kick is also used to restart the game following a safety. The team that was trapped in its own end zone, therefore conceding two points to the other team, kicks the ball from its own 20-yard line. This can be a place kick (in the NFL, a tee cannot be used), drop kick or punt.\n\nIn the NFL and high school, a free kick may be taken on the play immediately after a [[fair catch]]; see \"fair catch kick\" below.\n\n==Scoring==\n===Scrimmage plays and kickoffs===\nMost standard football plays are considered '''scrimmage plays,''' initiated from a line of scrimmage. Exceptions are kickoffs and try plays (below). Although similar rules apply during a try play, the number of points awarded for each score differs on a try play.\n====Touchdown (6 points)====\n{{Main|Touchdown}}\nA touchdown is earned when a player has legal possession of the ball and the ball touches or goes over the imaginary vertical plane above the opposing team's goal line. After a touchdown, the scoring team attempts a try play for 1 or 2 points (see below). A successful touchdown is signaled by an official extending both arms vertically above the head. A touchdown is worth six points, except in the defunct [[World Football League|WFL]] where it was worth seven points.\n\nFor statistical purposes, the player who advances the ball into or catches it in the end zone is credited with the touchdown. If a forward pass was thrown on the play, the throwing player is also credited with a passing touchdown.\n\n====Field goal (3 points)====\n{{Main|Field goal}}\nA field goal is scored when the ball is place kicked, drop kicked, or free kicked after a fair catch or awarded fair catch (High School or NFL only) between the goal posts behind the opponent's end zone. The most common type of kick used is the place kick. For a place kick, the ball must first be snapped to a placeholder, who holds the ball upright on the ground with his fingertip so that it may be kicked. Three points are scored if the ball crosses between the two upright posts and above the crossbar and remains over. If a field goal is missed, the ball is returned to the original line of scrimmage (in the NFL, to the spot of the kick; in high school, to the 20-yard line if the ball enters the end zone, or otherwise where the ball becomes dead after the kick) or to the 20-yard line if that is further from the goal line, and possession is given to the other team. If the ball does not go out of bounds, the other team may catch the kicked ball and attempt to advance it, but this is usually not advantageous. One official is positioned under each goalpost; if either one rules the field goal no good, then the field goal is unsuccessful. A successful field goal is signaled by an official extending both arms vertically above the head. A team that successfully kicks a field goal kicks off to the opposing team on the next play.\n\n====Safety (2 points)====\n{{Main|Safety (gridiron football score)}}\nThe uncommon '''safety''' is scored if a player causes the ball to become dead in his own end zone; two points are awarded to the opposing (usually defending) team. This can happen if a player is either downed or goes out of bounds in the end zone while carrying the ball, or if he fumbles the ball, and it goes out of bounds in the end zone. A safety is also awarded to the defensive team if the offensive team commits a foul which is enforced in its own end zone. A safety is ''not'' awarded if a player intercepts a pass or receives a kick in his own end zone and is downed there. This situation, in which the opponent caused the ball to enter the end zone, is called a [[touchback]]; no points are scored, and the team that gained possession of the ball is awarded possession at its own 25-yard line. If the interception or reception occurs outside the end zone, and the player is carried into the end zone by momentum, the ball is placed at the spot of the catch and no safety is awarded. A safety is signaled by a referee holding both palms together above the head, fingertips pointing upwards. After a safety, the team that conceded the safety kicks a free kick (which may be a punt, place kick, or drop kick) from its 20-yard line.\n\n===Try plays===\nA '''try play''' (as opposed to a regular '''scrimmage play''' or kickoff), more commonly referred to as an '''extra-point attempt,''' '''PAT''' (abbreviation of \"point after touchdown\"), '''conversion attempt,''' or '''two-point conversion attempt''', based on the scoring team's intentions on the play, is awarded to the scoring team immediately following a touchdown. This un-timed down is an opportunity to score additional points.<ref>{{cite book  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = 2007 Official Rules of the NFL  | publisher = Triumph Books  | date = October 1, 2007  | location =   | pages =   | url = https://archive.org/details/2007officialplay0000nati  | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 978-1-60078-028-8  | url-access = registration  }}</ref>\n\n* Although the game clock is not advanced during a try play, the play clock is enforced. A delay of game penalty, false start, or similar penalty, by the offense results in a 5-yard penalty assessed for the try. Typically, penalties charged against the defense give the offensive two options: half the distance to the goal for the try, or assessing the full penalty on the ensuing kickoff. Since the try is not timed by the game clock, if a touchdown is scored as regulation time expires (and game clock subsequently reads 0:00.0), the try is still allowed to be conducted. After the [[Minneapolis Miracle]] in 2018, the NFL implemented a rule that if a teams scores on the final play of the game, and extra points would not change the result, the PAT will no longer be conducted. \n\n====Extra point (field goal - 1 point)====\nThe offensive team may attempt to kick the ball through the goalposts, in the same manner that a field goal is kicked during a scrimmage play. In the NFL, the ball is spotted at the 15-yard line. In college and high school, the ball is spotted at the 3-yard line. If successful, the team is awarded 1 point, referred to as an [[Conversion (gridiron football)|extra point]]. This option is almost always chosen, because a two-point conversion attempt is much riskier. Since the extra point is almost always successful, sportscasters will often refer to a team up or trailing by seven (not six) points as being \"up/trailing by a touchdown\".\n\n====Two-point conversion (touchdown - 2 points)====\nThe offensive team may attempt to advance the ball via run or pass into the end zone, much like a touchdown on the extra-point attempt, except that it receives two points. This is called a '''[[two-point conversion]]'''. If the offense elects to attempt a two-point conversion on the try play, the ball is spotted at the 2-yard line in the NFL and on 3-yard line for college and high school. The success rate for two-point conversions is about 48 percent<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-nfl-teams-are-going-for-two-just-as-they-should-be/|title=More NFL Teams Are Going For Two \u2014 Just As They Should Be|first=Chase|last=Stuart|date=November 15, 2016|publisher=}}</ref> in the NFL, making the two-point conversion attempt a risky tactic; thus it is usually attempted only when two points will help the team but one point will not.\n* For example, suppose that it is late in the game with a score of 21\u201310 and the losing team scores a touchdown, making the score 21\u201316. The scoring team will usually attempt the two-point conversion, because if successful, a three-point deficit later could be matched with one field goal; failure to convert would result in a five-point deficit that could be surmounted with another touchdown \u2013 a situation no worse than the four-point deficit achieved with a kicked extra point.\n* Another example would be if a team scores a late-game touchdown, and as a result is down by two points. A successful two-point conversion would tie the game, and likely force overtime. In very rare and risky instances, a trailing team who scored a touchdown, and as a result is down by 1 point, may attempt a two-point conversion to gamble on a win and avoid overtime (or, under NCAA or NFHS rules, a subsequent overtime period). Two famous examples of this gamble were by [[1983 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] in the last minute of the [[1984 Orange Bowl]] (unsuccessful) and by [[2006 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State]] in the first overtime of the [[2007 Fiesta Bowl]] (successful). Under NCAA rules, teams are required to \"go for two\" starting with the third overtime procedure.\n\n=====Defensive conversion=====\nUnder college and NFL rules, if the defensive team gains possession and advances the ball the length of the field into the opposite end zone on the try play (via interception or a fumble recovery, or by blocking a kick and legally recovering the ball), they score two points. This is officially recorded as a '''defensive conversion''' scored by the defense. The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] adopted this rule in 1988; the NFL added this in 2015.\n* This scenario cannot occur under [[National Federation of State High School Associations|high school football]] rules; the ball is ruled dead and the try is over immediately when the defense gains possession.\n\n====Safety (1 point)====\nA safety scored on a try play is worth one point. This can occur when, for example, the defense gains control of the ball and advances it into the field of play, but then retreats into its own end zone when play is stopped. Similarly, the defense could recover a fumble in its own end zone before play is stopped. A safety on a try play could also be awarded to the defense if the defense takes possession of the ball during a try play, advances it all the way down to the opposite end of the field, where the offensive team then regains possession before the play is declared dead in that end zone.\n\n====Officials signals on try plays====\nThe officials' signal for a successful try, whether an extra point or a two-point conversion, is the same as for a touchdown. The officials' signal for a safety on a try play is also the same as on a scrimmage play.\n\nAfter the try, the team that scored the touchdown kicks off to the opposing team. Unlike a safety that occurs on a scrimmage play, no free kick is awarded following a safety on a try play.\n\n====Try play rules in overtime====\nDuring sudden-death overtime, particularly in the NFL, if a team scores a touchdown in the overtime period, the game is immediately over, and the try is not attempted.\n\nIn NCAA overtime, if the second team to possess the ball in the overtime scores a touchdown which puts them ahead of the opponent in points the game ends immediately and no try is attempted.\n\n===Fair catch kick===\n{{Main|Fair catch kick}}\nA free kick (see above) may be taken on the play immediately after any fair catch of a punt. In the NFL, if the receiving team elects to attempt this and time expired during the punt, the half/overtime is extended with an untimed down. The ball must be held on the ground by a member of the kicking team or drop kicked; a tee may not be used. (High school kickers may use a tee). This is both a field goal attempt and a free kick; if the ball is kicked between the goal posts, three points are scored for the kicking team. This is the only case where a free kick may score points. This method of scoring is extremely rare, last successfully completed in the NFL by [[Ray Wersching]] in 1976. It is only advantageous when a team catches a very short punt with very little time left. A team is unlikely to be punting with only a few seconds left in a half or overtime, and it is rarer still for punts to be caught near field goal range. The officials' signal for a successful fair catch kick is the same as for a field goal.\n\n====Defunct leagues====\n* In the [[World Football League|WFL]], PAT's were called \"Action Points\" and could '''only''' be scored via a run or pass play (as opposed to by kick as in the NFL), and were worth one point. The ball was placed on the two-and-a-half -yard line for an Action Point. This rule was a revival of a 1968 preseason experiment by the NFL and [[American Football League]]. The [[XFL (2001)|XFL's first incarnation]] employed a similar rule in which teams ran a single offensive down from the two-yard line (functionally identical to the NFL/NCAA/CFL two-point conversion), also for one point. By the playoffs, two-point and three-point conversions had been added to the rules. Teams could opt for the bonus points by playing the conversion farther back from the goal line. This rule remains intact in the [[XFL (2020)|current XFL]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/04/08/xfl-to-use-one-two-three-point-conversions/|title=XFL to use one-, two-, three-point conversions|last=Florio|first=Mike|date=April 8, 2019|website=ProFootballTalk|language=en|access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Officiating==\n{{Main|Official (American football)}}\nThe game is officiated by a crew of three to seven officials. Every crew will consist of a ''referee'', who is generally in charge of the game and watches action on the quarterback and in the offensive backfield; an ''umpire'', who handles spotting the ball and watches action on the offensive line; and a ''head linesman'', who supervises placement of the down box and line-to-gain chains. The crew may also consist of a ''line judge'', ''back judge'', ''field judge'' and ''side judge'', in the order listed: i.e. a crew of five officials has a referee, umpire, head linesman, line judge and back judge.\n\nOfficials are selected by the teams in advance or appointed by the governing league. While the majority of officials at lower levels only officiate games on a part-time basis, the NFL is implementing a new system where seven officials will become full-time employees of the league, one for each official position (i.e. back judge, field judge, side judge, etc.).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000110332/article/carl-johnson-named-nfls-first-fulltime-game-official|title=Carl Johnson named NFL's first full-time game official|publisher=}}</ref> In the other three major North American professional sports leagues \u2013 [[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and [[National Hockey League|NHL]] \u2013 officials are employed by their respective leagues. The sheer volume of games in the other three sports necessitates full-time officials; the NFL regular season is only 16 games long, compared to 162 games for MLB and 82 for the NBA and NHL.\n\nDuring the game, the officials are assisted in the administration of the game by other persons, including: a ''clock operator'' to start and stop the game clock (and possibly also the play clock); a [[chain crew]] who hold the ''down indicator'' and the ''line-to-gain chains'' on the sideline; and ''ball boys'', who provide footballs to officials between downs (e.g. a dry ball each down on a wet day). These individuals may be provided by the teams involved \u2013 it is common for a high school coach's son or daughter to act as ball boy for the team.\n\n==Fouls and their penalties==\n{{Main|Penalty (American football)}}\nBecause football is a high-[[contact sport]] requiring a balance between offense and defense, many rules exist that regulate equality, safety, contact, and actions of players on each team. It is very difficult to always avoid violating these rules without giving up too much of an advantage. Thus, an elaborate system of fouls and penalties has been developed to \"let the punishment fit the crime\" and maintain a balance between following the rules and keeping a good flow of the game. Players are constantly looking for ways to find an advantage that stretches the limitations imposed by the rules. Also, the frequency and severity of fouls can make a large difference in the outcome of a game, so coaches are constantly looking for ways to minimize the number and severity of infractions committed by their players.\n\nIt is a common misconception that the term \"penalty\" is used to refer both to an infraction and the penal consequence of that infraction. A ''foul'' is a rule infraction for which a penalty is prescribed.<ref>NCAA Rule 2-9</ref> Some of the more common fouls are listed below. In most cases when a foul occurs, the offending team will be assessed a penalty of 5, 10 or 15 yards, depending on the foul. Also, in most cases, if the foul is committed while the ball is in play, the down will be replayed from the new position (for example, if the offense commits a foul on a first-down play, the next play will still be first down, but the offense may have to go 15 yards, or farther, to achieve another first down.) But if a defensive foul results in the ball advancing beyond the offense's first-down objective, the next play will be the first down of a new series. Some penalties (typically for more serious fouls), however, require a loss of down for the offense; and some defensive fouls may result in an automatic first down regardless of the ball position.\n\nIn all cases (except for ejection of a player or, in rare cases, forfeiture of the game), the non-offending team is given the option of declining the penalty and letting the result of the play stand (although the Referee may exercise this option on their behalf when it is obvious), if they believe it to be more to their advantage. For some fouls by the defense, the penalty is applied in addition to the yardage gained on the play. Most '''personal fouls''', which involve danger to another player, carry 15-yard penalties; in rare cases, they result in offending players being ejected from the game. In the NFL, if a defensive foul occurs after time has expired at the end of a half, the half will be continued for a single, untimed play from scrimmage. Under college rules, any accepted penalty when time has expired at the end of any quarter results in an extension for one untimed down.\n\nIn the NFL, with three exceptions, no penalty may move the ball more than half the distance toward the penalized team's goal line. These exceptions are defensive pass interference (see the discussion of that foul for more details), intentional grounding, and offensive holding \u2013 but in this last case the exception pertains only if the infraction occurs within the offensive team's own end zone, in which case an automatic safety is assessed (intentional grounding from the end zone also carries an automatic safety). Under college rules, the same half-the-distance principle applies, but any offensive fouls involving contact in their end zone (e.g. holding, illegal blocking or personal fouls) result in a safety.\n\n:The '''neutral zone''' is the space between the two free-kick lines during a free-kick down and between the two scrimmage lines during a scrimmage down. For a free-kick down, the neutral zone is 10 yards wide and for a scrimmage down it is as wide as the length of the football. It is established when the ball is marked ready for play. No player may legally be in the neutral zone except for the snapper on scrimmage downs, and no one except the kicker and the holder for free kick downs.\n\n==Timeouts==\nEach team receives three [[Time-out (sport)#Gridiron football|timeouts]] per half (if the game goes to overtime, each team receives additional timeouts), making for a total of six timeouts per team in a regulation game. Unused timeouts may not carry over to the second half or overtime. In professional football, a team must have at least one remaining timeout to challenge an official's call.\n\n==Instant replay==\n{{Main|Replay review in gridiron football}}\n\nIn the NFL, a number of rulings can be reviewed by officials or challenged by coaches. If a coach wants to challenge a play, he must do so before the next play begins, and he does so by throwing a red flag similar to the officials' yellow flags. Coaches are allowed two challenges per game and are granted a third if their first two are successful. The team loses a timeout if they lose the challenge. Therefore, they cannot challenge if they do not have timeouts. Plays within the two-minute-warning and overtime cannot be challenged; any review must be initiated by a replay official off-field. The referee performs the actual review via a video screen on the sideline. The referee will announce the result of instant replay reviews over his wireless microphone.\n\nBeginning in the 2011 NFL Season, an instant replay review by the booth official will now be automatic for every play ruled by the referees on the field to have scored points. This is seen as another step in the \"modernization\" of sports. Every scoring play will be reviewed now, which saves coaches from using up their challenges on close plays in the endzone.<ref>{{cite web|title=What You Need To Know About The New NFL Rule Changes \u2013 2011|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/nfl-rule-changes-primer-2011-3}}</ref> And since the 2012 season, the booth official also reviews all turnovers during the game.\n\nIn college, coaches are allowed one challenge per game by first requesting a timeout. Otherwise, a replay official in the press box observes all plays. If he deems a ruling may be in error, he notifies the officials on the field to interrupt the game before the beginning of the next play. The replay official performs the review and relays the decision to the referee, who announces the result. Not every conference employs replay, which is optional.\n\nHigh school rules generally do not provide for video review of any decisions by officials during a game. By state adoption, replay may be used in a state championship game. At all times, the use of television or video tape for coaching purposes during the game is prohibited. If a coach feels a rule has been misinterpreted, he may call timeout and request a coach-referee conference to ''discuss'' the ruling with the referee, but no replay equipment will be consulted during the conference.\n\n==Major rule differences between NFL and college football==\nSome of the major rule differences between NFL and college football include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;\n!

The team leading after both possessions is declared the winner. If the teams remain tied, another overtime is played.

For the next decade, Soviet pilots performed the bulk of the flying and equipping for the AAF, probably about one-half of the aircraft were [[Airco DH.9A|Polikarpov R-1s]], a Soviet copy of the de Havilland DH.9A. Most AAF aircraft were destroyed in the civil war that began in December 1928, and it was not before 1937 that a serious rebuilding effort began. From the late 1930s until World War II, British [[Hawker Hind]] and Italian [[IMAM Ro.37]] aircraft constituted the bulk of the Afghan Air Force, which by 1938 amounted to about 30 planes in service.<ref>R.

With the collapse of the Najibullah Government in 1992, the Air Force ceased to be a single entity, instead breaking up amongst the different mujahideen factions in the ongoing civil war. By the end of the 1990s, the [[military of the Taliban]] maintained five supersonic [[MIG-21MF]]s and 10 [[Sukhoi-22]] fighter-bombers.<ref>York, Geoffrey.

The aircraft was operated extensively during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, mainly for attacking [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[mujahideen]] fighters. Early in the war, the only anti-air weapons of the mujahideen were Soviet made shoulder-launched, heat-seeking SAMs and American Redeye, which had either been captured from the Soviets or their Afghan allies or were supplied from Western sources. Many of them came from stocks the Israelis had captured during their wars with Soviet client states in the Middle East. Owing to a combination of the limited capabilities of these early types of missiles, poor training and poor material condition of the missiles, they were not particularly effective.<ref>Yakubovich, Nikolay.

In the first use of the Stinger in Afghanistan, mujahideen fighters downed three of eight unsuspecting Soviet Mi-24 Hinds as they approached the airfield at Jalalabad on a late September afternoon. Some scholars point to that event in 1986 as the turning point in the war. Moreover, for most of the remainder of the war when Stingers were known to be present, Soviet and Afghan aircraft elected to remain at higher altitudes where they were less vulnerable to the missile, but also less effective in ground attacks. Although employed extensively throughout the war as a ground attack platform, the Hind suffered from a weak tail boom and was found to be underpowered for some missions it was called upon to perform in the mountains of Afghanistan, where high [[density altitude]] is especially problematic for rotary-wing aircraft.<ref>Mohammad Yousaf and Mark Adkin, Afghanistan-The Bear Trap (Casemate: Havertown, Penn., 2001 [1992]), pp 174\u201380; [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/SKJ.htm Stalder, \"Air War in Afghanistan\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315054416/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/SKJ.htm |date=15 March 2017 }}</ref>\n\nOverall, the Hind proved effective and very reliable, earning the respect of both Soviet and Afghan pilots as well as ordinary Afghans throughout the country. The mujahideen nicknamed the Mi-24 the \"Devil's Chariot\" due to its notorious reputation. Since the end of the Soviet-Afghan war, the civil war of the 1990s, and the post-11 September 2001 US/Coalition operations, the Afghan Air Force (AAF) is again using the Mi-35 Hind.<ref>Yousaf, Afghanistan-The Bear Trap, pp 174\u201380</ref>\n\n=== 21st century ===\n[[File:AAF firefighting students in 2011.jpg|thumb|Firefighting students at the Air Force University in 2011]]\nFor the first time in over two decades Afghanistan has begun training new pilots.

The U.S. declaration that the C-27A was now an Afghan Air Force asset effectively violated international law and the Italian government enforced the embargo and stopped shipment of contracted supplies to Afghanistan. This put the U.S. government in a dilemma since the $290 million contract was funded through the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) which required, by U.S. law, that all military materials purchased be turned over to the Afghan government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.disamjournal.org/articles/afghanistan-security-forces-fund-asffthe-past-present-and-future-860 |work=The DISAM Journal |first=Ed |last=McFarland |title=Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF)\u2014The Past, Present, and Future |date=1 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006140706/http://www.disamjournal.org/articles/afghanistan-security-forces-fund-asffthe-past-present-and-future-860 |archivedate=6 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe C-27A was eventually determined to be a U.S. owned asset utilized by the Afghan Air Force with intent to turn over the asset in the future (assuming the Italian embargo would at some point be lifted or that enough supplies could be stock piled to take the aircraft through its expected 10-year service life), but this determination was not immediate. This caused a delay of contracted goods beyond the time frame of the initial contract through no fault of the contractor, and made it necessary for the U.S. government to enter into a second more costly maintenance contract with Alenia North America to get aircraft operational. Since the C-27A aircraft purchased still had Italian military air worthiness certificates controlled by the company, Alenia North America effectively monopolized the entire supply chain making fair competition non-existent. This second contract inflated the total program cost to over $600 million, and it would have cost over $1.2 billion had the U.S. opted to extend the contract up to 10 years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/asd_01_04_2013_p01-02-533438.xml&p=2 | work= Aerospace Daily & Defense Report | first=Anthony | last=Osborne | title=U.S. Air Force Halts Troubled Afghan Air Force Transport Deal | date=4 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe C-27A contract with Alenia North America was eventually terminated, citing that the contractor failed to meet their legal obligations and announced that the Afghan Air Force would be receiving four C-130 transport aircraft (expected in 2013).<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.stripes.com/news/us-scraps-entire-fleet-of-afghan-cargo-planes-1.202220 | work=Stars and Stripes | first=Heath | last=Druzin | title=US scraps entire fleet of Afghan cargo planes | date=28 December 2012 | access-date=27 June 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630030545/http://www.stripes.com/news/us-scraps-entire-fleet-of-afghan-cargo-planes-1.202220 | archive-date=30 June 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The G-222 program legacy to the C-130 is that the cockpit and cargo compartment configurations of the C-27A are similar to that of a C-130H.

The Afghan flag was possibly used as well. Afghanistan adopted a black, red, and green flag after the 1929 revolt, and when the Air Force was given aircraft again in 1937, it placed this flag on the rudder, and adopted wing and fuselage roundels based on the three colors.\n<gallery>\nFile:Roundel of the Afghan Air Force (1948-1979).svg|Roundel introduced in 1967; also used as a fin flash.

The three letters are the initials of ''Afghan Ordou-e Melli'' (Afghan National Army).\n</gallery>\nThe Royal Afghan Air Force retained the roundels until adopting a new style in 1967, with a unique insignia consisting of a tri-color triangle using the national colors upon a white disc, on which was inscribed with Arabic lettering forming various phrases. This roundel was placed on the rudder in place of the flag. This remained in use after the overthrow of the monarchy until the Russian invasion in 1979, when a new insignia of a red disc with yellow inscriptions was adopted. This was short-lived however, as in 1983, a more Soviet-standard red star on a white disc ringed in black, red, and green was adopted. These were maintained until after the Soviet departure.\n\nUpon the departure of Soviet forces from Afghanistan, and the fall of the communist government, a return to the triangle insignia was noted, although markings varied depending on the ownership of the aircraft.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of active aircraft of the Afghan Air Force]]\n* [[Latifa Nabizada]]\n* [[Niloofar Rahmani]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Afghan Air Force}}\n* [http://www.artiklar.z-bok.se/Afghanistan-1.html The First 30 Years of Aviation in Afghanistan]\n* [http://cocardes.monde.online.fr/v2html/en/pays/afghanistan.html Roundels of the world, Afghanistan]\n\n{{Afghan security forces}}\n{{air forces}}\n\n[[Category:Military of Afghanistan|Air Force]]\n[[Category:Air forces by country]]\n[[Category:Aviation in Afghanistan|Air Force]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1924]]\n[[Category:1924 establishments in Afghanistan]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Air warfare branch of Afghanistan's armed forces}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Infobox military unit\n| unit_name = Afghan Air Force\n| native_name = {{native name|ps|\u062f \u0627\u0641\u063a\u0627\u0646\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0648\u0627\u0626\u064a \u0681\u0648\u0627\u06a9}}\n| image = Emblem of the Afghan Air Force.svg\n| image_size = \n| caption = Afghan Air Force emblem \n| dates = June 2010 (current form)<br/>({{Age in years and months|2010|06|1}})<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/anaac.htm|title=Afghan Air Force (AAF)|first=John|last=Pike|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=11 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112042619/https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/anaac.htm|archive-date=12 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><br/>2002 (Afghan National Army Air Corps)<br/>({{Age in years|2002}})<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/anaac-modernization.htm|title=Afghan Air Force (AAF) \u2013 Modernization|first=John|last=Pike|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=11 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112100832/https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/anaac-modernization.htm|archive-date=12 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><br/>22 August 1924 (original formation)<br/>({{Age in years and months|1924|08|22}})<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/the-new-afghanistan-air-force-67148969/?all|title=The New Afghanistan Air Force|access-date=11 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181124105709/https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/the-new-afghanistan-air-force-67148969/?all|archive-date=24 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| country = {{flag|Afghanistan}}\n| allegiance =\n| branch = \n| type = [[Air force]]\n| role = [[Aerial warfare]]\n| size = 7,100 airmen<ref name=\"khaama.com\"/> <br/>183 aircraft<ref name=\"Concerns regarding misuse of Afghan Air Force fleet echoed in latest report to U.S. Congress\"/>\n| command_structure = [[File:Emblem of the Ministry of Defence of Afghanistan.svg|23px]] [[Ministry of Defense (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Defense]]\n| garrison = National Military Command Center, [[Kabul]], [[Kabul Province]], [[Afghanistan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalguard.mil/News/Article-View/Article/590370/virginia-national-guards-29th-infantry-division-mentors-making-a-difference-in/|title=Virginia National Guard\u2019s 29th Infantry Division mentors making a diff|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115071701/http://www.nationalguard.mil/News/Article-View/Article/590370/virginia-national-guards-29th-infantry-division-mentors-making-a-difference-in/|archive-date=15 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| garrison_label = Headquarters\n| equipment = \n| equipment_label = \n| nickname = \n| patron = \n| motto = \n| colors = \n| colors_label = \n| march = \n| mascot = \n| battles = \n| anniversaries = \n| decorations = \n| battle_honours = \n| current_commander = Maj.

For the next decade, Soviet pilots performed the bulk of the flying and equipping for the AAF, probably about one-half of the aircraft were [[Airco DH.9A|Polikarpov R-1s]], a Soviet copy of the de Havilland DH.9A. Most AAF aircraft were destroyed in the civil war that began in December 1928, and it was not before 1937 that a serious rebuilding effort began. From the late 1930s until World War II, British [[Hawker Hind]] and Italian [[IMAM Ro.37]] aircraft constituted the bulk of the Afghan Air Force, which by 1938 amounted to about 30 planes in service.<ref>R.

During his five years in power, until the Communist coup of 1978, Daoud relied on Soviet assistance to upgrade the capabilities and increase the size of the Afghan Air Force, introducing newer-models of Soviet-built [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]] fighters and [[Antonov An-24|An-24]] and [[Antonov An-26|An-26]] transports.

With the collapse of the Najibullah Government in 1992, the Air Force ceased to be a single entity, instead breaking up amongst the different mujahideen factions in the ongoing civil war. By the end of the 1990s, the [[military of the Taliban]] maintained five supersonic [[MIG-21MF]]s and 10 [[Sukhoi-22]] fighter-bombers.<ref>York, Geoffrey.

It was 2005 before a US-led, international effort began to rebuild the Afghan Air Force; since 2007, the pace has increased significantly under the auspices of the Combined Air Power Transition Force.<ref>Debay, \"Wings over Panjshir\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Mil Mi-24]] and [[Mil Mi-24|Mi-35]] (export model) [[attack helicopter]]s have a long history in Afghanistan. The aircraft was operated extensively during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, mainly for attacking [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[mujahideen]] fighters. Early in the war, the only anti-air weapons of the mujahideen were Soviet made shoulder-launched, heat-seeking SAMs and American Redeye, which had either been captured from the Soviets or their Afghan allies or were supplied from Western sources. Many of them came from stocks the Israelis had captured during their wars with Soviet client states in the Middle East. Owing to a combination of the limited capabilities of these early types of missiles, poor training and poor material condition of the missiles, they were not particularly effective.<ref>Yakubovich, Nikolay.

In the first use of the Stinger in Afghanistan, mujahideen fighters downed three of eight unsuspecting Soviet Mi-24 Hinds as they approached the airfield at Jalalabad on a late September afternoon. Some scholars point to that event in 1986 as the turning point in the war. Moreover, for most of the remainder of the war when Stingers were known to be present, Soviet and Afghan aircraft elected to remain at higher altitudes where they were less vulnerable to the missile, but also less effective in ground attacks. Although employed extensively throughout the war as a ground attack platform, the Hind suffered from a weak tail boom and was found to be underpowered for some missions it was called upon to perform in the mountains of Afghanistan, where high [[density altitude]] is especially problematic for rotary-wing aircraft.<ref>Mohammad Yousaf and Mark Adkin, Afghanistan-The Bear Trap (Casemate: Havertown, Penn., 2001 [1992]), pp 174\u201380; [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/SKJ.htm Stalder, \"Air War in Afghanistan\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315054416/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/SKJ.htm |date=15 March 2017 }}</ref>\n\nOverall, the Hind proved effective and very reliable, earning the respect of both Soviet and Afghan pilots as well as ordinary Afghans throughout the country. The mujahideen nicknamed the Mi-24 the \"Devil's Chariot\" due to its notorious reputation. Since the end of the Soviet-Afghan war, the civil war of the 1990s, and the post-11 September 2001 US/Coalition operations, the Afghan Air Force (AAF) is again using the Mi-35 Hind.<ref>Yousaf, Afghanistan-The Bear Trap, pp 174\u201380</ref>\n\n=== 21st century ===\n[[File:AAF firefighting students in 2011.jpg|thumb|Firefighting students at the Air Force University in 2011]]\nFor the first time in over two decades Afghanistan has begun training new pilots.

The U.S. declaration that the C-27A was now an Afghan Air Force asset effectively violated international law and the Italian government enforced the embargo and stopped shipment of contracted supplies to Afghanistan. This put the U.S. government in a dilemma since the $290 million contract was funded through the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) which required, by U.S. law, that all military materials purchased be turned over to the Afghan government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.disamjournal.org/articles/afghanistan-security-forces-fund-asffthe-past-present-and-future-860 |work=The DISAM Journal |first=Ed |last=McFarland |title=Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF)\u2014The Past, Present, and Future |date=1 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006140706/http://www.disamjournal.org/articles/afghanistan-security-forces-fund-asffthe-past-present-and-future-860 |archivedate=6 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe C-27A was eventually determined to be a U.S. owned asset utilized by the Afghan Air Force with intent to turn over the asset in the future (assuming the Italian embargo would at some point be lifted or that enough supplies could be stock piled to take the aircraft through its expected 10-year service life), but this determination was not immediate. This caused a delay of contracted goods beyond the time frame of the initial contract through no fault of the contractor, and made it necessary for the U.S. government to enter into a second more costly maintenance contract with Alenia North America to get aircraft operational. Since the C-27A aircraft purchased still had Italian military air worthiness certificates controlled by the company, Alenia North America effectively monopolized the entire supply chain making fair competition non-existent. This second contract inflated the total program cost to over $600 million, and it would have cost over $1.2 billion had the U.S. opted to extend the contract up to 10 years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/asd_01_04_2013_p01-02-533438.xml&p=2 | work= Aerospace Daily & Defense Report | first=Anthony | last=Osborne | title=U.S. Air Force Halts Troubled Afghan Air Force Transport Deal | date=4 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe C-27A contract with Alenia North America was eventually terminated, citing that the contractor failed to meet their legal obligations and announced that the Afghan Air Force would be receiving four C-130 transport aircraft (expected in 2013).<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.stripes.com/news/us-scraps-entire-fleet-of-afghan-cargo-planes-1.202220 | work=Stars and Stripes | first=Heath | last=Druzin | title=US scraps entire fleet of Afghan cargo planes | date=28 December 2012 | access-date=27 June 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630030545/http://www.stripes.com/news/us-scraps-entire-fleet-of-afghan-cargo-planes-1.202220 | archive-date=30 June 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The G-222 program legacy to the C-130 is that the cockpit and cargo compartment configurations of the C-27A are similar to that of a C-130H.

The Afghan flag was possibly used as well. Afghanistan adopted a black, red, and green flag after the 1929 revolt, and when the Air Force was given aircraft again in 1937, it placed this flag on the rudder, and adopted wing and fuselage roundels based on the three colors.\n<gallery>\nFile:Roundel of the Afghan Air Force (1948-1979).svg|Roundel introduced in 1967; also used as a fin flash.

This roundel was placed on the rudder in place of the flag. This remained in use after the overthrow of the monarchy until the Russian invasion in 1979, when a new insignia of a red disc with yellow inscriptions was adopted. This was short-lived however, as in 1983, a more Soviet-standard red star on a white disc ringed in black, red, and green was adopted. These were maintained until after the Soviet departure.\n\nUpon the departure of Soviet forces from Afghanistan, and the fall of the communist government, a return to the triangle insignia was noted, although markings varied depending on the ownership of the aircraft.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of active aircraft of the Afghan Air Force]]\n* [[Latifa Nabizada]]\n* [[Niloofar Rahmani]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Afghan Air Force}}\n* [http://www.artiklar.z-bok.se/Afghanistan-1.html The First 30 Years of Aviation in Afghanistan]\n* [http://cocardes.monde.online.fr/v2html/en/pays/afghanistan.html Roundels of the world, Afghanistan]\n\n{{Afghan security forces}}\n{{air forces}}\n\n[[Category:Military of Afghanistan|Air Force]]\n[[Category:Air forces by country]]\n[[Category:Aviation in Afghanistan|Air Force]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1924]]\n[[Category:1924 establishments in Afghanistan]]\n", "name_user": "MAS1357", "label": "safe", "comment": "edited current commander.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Air_Force"}

He has written extensively on Russian history as well on communications, the Internet and Wikipedia.\n\n===Russian history===\nPoe is the co-founder and a former editor of the academic journal ''[[Kritika (journal)|Kritika]]: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History.'' He is the author or editor of several books on Russia including ''A People Born to Slavery: Russia in Early Modern European Ethnography'' (2000) and ''The Russian Elite in the Seventeenth Century'' (2004).<ref name=\"Book\" /> ''The Russian Moment in World History'' (2006) is a brief, 116 page book that was written for the general public. It provides an overview of more than 1,400 years of Russian history beginning in the 6th to 9th centuries with the migration of [[Slavs]] from [[central Europe]] to the northeast. It ends with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.<ref name=\"Moment\">Poe, Marshall. (2006) ''The Russian Moment in World History''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.</ref>\n\nPoe argues the Soviet Union did not collapse because of the failure of [[Communism]] as many pundits assert. Rather, he contends that the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] lost faith in the traditional path that had not only preserved Russian independence for almost five centuries, but had also enabled the country to build a huge [[empire]]. That path included a reliance on [[autocracy|autocratic leadership]], a [[planned economy|command economy]], tight controls on debate in the [[public sphere]] and a state-engineered military. \"Using these means,\" Poe writes, \"the Russian elite was able to take a primitive, premodern state and transform it in the course of two centuries into one of the most powerful enterprises on earth. It is difficult to see how such a thing could be seen as a failure.\"<ref name=\"Moment\" />\n\nPoe's work on Russian history has brought back from obscurity the writings of the 16th-century Austrian diplomat [[Sigismund von Herberstein]], who was one of the first European ethnographers of Russia.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/09/common-knowledge/305151/|title=Common Knowledge|author=Rothenberg Gritz, Jennie|magazine=The Atlantic|accessdate=2014-07-14}}</ref>\n\n===''The Atlantic''===\nFrom 2003 to 2005, Poe conducted research for ''The Atlantic'' magazine and co-wrote the regular feature \"Primary Sources.\".<ref name=\"CV\" /> A typical one, in the magazine's July/August 2005 edition, provided information on a variety of studies and reports supported by online links.

During an interview with [[Andrew Keen]], he argued that through a collaborative group, great things can be accomplished. \"Wikipedia is in a sense kind of [[public utility]] now. It's much more like the electric company or the water company or the public library than it is anything else and there's no reason it shouldn't exist and continue to expand alongside all kinds of other commercial ventures because it is basically built for free. I mean it's just \u2014 it's a utility that is provided to the public at almost no public cost.\" <ref>Keen, Andrew.

Retrieved from the [[Wayback Machine]] on 19 January 2013</ref>\n\n===Communications: Pull and Push===\nIn 2011, Poe published ''A History of Communications: Media and Society from the Evolution of Speech to the Internet'', a 337-page book that analyzes how media networks originate, how they function and how they shape social practices and values.<ref name=\"Book\">Poe, Marshall T. (2011) ''A History of Communications: Media and Society from the Evolution of Speech to the Internet''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> Poe explains in the book's introduction that he is seeking to expand and refine the communications theories of the late Canadian scholar [[Harold Innis]]. In his 1950 book [[Empire and Communications]], Innis conducted a sweeping historical survey of how various media influenced the rise and fall of empires from ancient to modern times.<ref>Innis, Harold. (2007) ''Empire and Communications''. Toronto: Dundurn Press.</ref>\n\nPoe advances the idea that new media are developed by inventors and tinkerers, but are not \"pulled\" into broad use until \"organized interests\" recognize their need for these new communications tools. He argues, for example, that [[audiovisual]] media such as radio, telephone, television and film were developed well before they were taken up by industrial [[capitalism|capitalists]] who needed more effective ways to market the goods they produced. Audiovisual media also served the interests of bureaucrats and politicians who gained popularity by giving citizens access to modern conveniences. \"Modern states are [[welfare state]]s,\" Poe writes, \"and welfare states make sure their citizens have things to listen to and watch.\"\n\nIn turn, audiovisual media shaped social practices and values. They \"pushed\" societies into a [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] pursuit of private entertainment justified by people's need for relaxation in an otherwise stressful society. And, since [[evolutionary psychology]] suggests that human beings find it easier to listen and watch than to read and write, audiovisual media caught on rapidly. \"When faced with reading a good book,\" Poe writes, \"or watching an awful TV show, most people will watch the awful TV show.\"<ref name=\"Book\" />\n\nPoe writes about five periods in media history: the age of [[speech]], the age of [[manuscript culture|manuscripts]], the age of [[printing|print]], the age of audiovisual media and the age of the [[Internet]]. He provides a detailed analysis of each under eight headings: ''accessibility'', ''privacy'', ''fidelity'', ''volume'', ''velocity'', ''range'', ''persistence'' and ''searchability''. Poe writes, for example, that in the 150,000 years during which speech was the only medium or network, its accessibility was high because nearly everyone could speak and listen. Privacy, however, was low in such face-to-face communication and so too was fidelity because speech can convey only sounds, not pictures or other direct sensory information. Volume and range were also low because the unaided human voice can't carry very far or to many people, but velocity was high because speech travels at the speed of sound. Poe notes that speech is not a persistent medium because it fades away instantly, but it is searchable because what is said can remain in people's memories. He draws many conclusions from this analysis including his theory that societies dominated by speech tended to be democratized and [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]], but also distrustful of strangers because as a medium, speech is suited to small, tightly knit groups.<ref name=\"Book\" />\n\n===New publishing model===\nIn his 2002 essay \"Note to Self: Print Monograph Dead; Invent New Publishing Model,\" published in the ''Journal of Electronic Publishing'', Poe questioned the viability of the old [[academic publishing]] model, arguing in favor of self-publishing and [[print on demand]]. He explained how he did this with one of the two volumes of his [[prosopography|prosopographical]] study of the Russian elite in the [[early modern]] period. \"Shortly after I sent the book for review\", he writes, \"a very worried journal editor contacted me. He was upset that I hadn't included a copyright page on the e-book I sent him. Without a copyright page, he explained, any reader could copy my book, send it all over the world, or use it in the classroom &mdash; all without my permission. That, I responded, was the point.

During an interview with [[Andrew Keen]], he argued that through a collaborative group, great things can be accomplished. \"Wikipedia is in a sense kind of [[public utility]] now. It's much more like the electric company or the water company or the public library than it is anything else and there's no reason it shouldn't exist and continue to expand alongside all kinds of other commercial ventures because it is basically built for free.

Retrieved from the [[Wayback Machine]] on 19 January 2013</ref>\n\n===Communications: Pull and Push===\nIn 2011, Poe published ''A History of Communications: Media and Society from the Evolution of Speech to the Internet'', a 337-page book that analyzes how media networks originate, how they function and how they shape social practices and values.<ref name=\"Book\">Poe, Marshall T. (2011) ''A History of Communications: Media and Society from the Evolution of Speech to the Internet''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> Poe explains in the book's introduction that he is seeking to expand and refine the communications theories of the late Canadian scholar [[Harold Innis]]. In his 1950 book [[Empire and Communications]], Innis conducted a sweeping historical survey of how various media influenced the rise and fall of empires from ancient to modern times.<ref>Innis, Harold. (2007) ''Empire and Communications''. Toronto: Dundurn Press.</ref>\n\nPoe advances the idea that new media are developed by inventors and tinkerers, but are not \"pulled\" into broad use until \"organized interests\" recognize their need for these new communications tools. He argues, for example, that [[audiovisual]] media such as radio, telephone, television and film were developed well before they were taken up by industrial [[capitalism|capitalists]] who needed more effective ways to market the goods they produced. Audiovisual media also served the interests of bureaucrats and politicians who gained popularity by giving citizens access to modern conveniences. \"Modern states are [[welfare state]]s,\" Poe writes, \"and welfare states make sure their citizens have things to listen to and watch.\"\n\nIn turn, audiovisual media shaped social practices and values. They \"pushed\" societies into a [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] pursuit of private entertainment justified by people's need for relaxation in an otherwise stressful society. And, since [[evolutionary psychology]] suggests that human beings find it easier to listen and watch than to read and write, audiovisual media caught on rapidly. \"When faced with reading a good book,\" Poe writes, \"or watching an awful TV show, most people will watch the awful TV show.\"<ref name=\"Book\" />\n\nPoe writes about five periods in media history: the age of [[speech]], the age of [[manuscript culture|manuscripts]], the age of [[printing|print]], the age of audiovisual media and the age of the [[Internet]]. He provides a detailed analysis of each under eight headings: ''accessibility'', ''privacy'', ''fidelity'', ''volume'', ''velocity'', ''range'', ''persistence'' and ''searchability''. Poe writes, for example, that in the 150,000 years during which speech was the only medium or network, its accessibility was high because nearly everyone could speak and listen. Privacy, however, was low in such face-to-face communication and so too was fidelity because speech can convey only sounds, not pictures or other direct sensory information. Volume and range were also low because the unaided human voice can't carry very far or to many people, but velocity was high because speech travels at the speed of sound. Poe notes that speech is not a persistent medium because it fades away instantly, but it is searchable because what is said can remain in people's memories. He draws many conclusions from this analysis including his theory that societies dominated by speech tended to be democratized and [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]], but also distrustful of strangers because as a medium, speech is suited to small, tightly knit groups.<ref name=\"Book\" />\n\n===New publishing model===\nIn his 2002 essay \"Note to Self: Print Monograph Dead; Invent New Publishing Model,\" published in the ''Journal of Electronic Publishing'', Poe questioned the viability of the old [[academic publishing]] model, arguing in favor of self-publishing and [[print on demand]]. He explained how he did this with one of the two volumes of his [[prosopography|prosopographical]] study of the Russian elite in the [[early modern]] period. \"Shortly after I sent the book for review\", he writes, \"a very worried journal editor contacted me. He was upset that I hadn't included a copyright page on the e-book I sent him. Without a copyright page, he explained, any reader could copy my book, send it all over the world, or use it in the classroom &mdash; all without my permission. That, I responded, was the point.

She grew up in [[Schloss Burg (Solingen)|Schloss Burg]] on the edge of [[Solingen]].\n\nAnne's father was influenced by [[Erasmus]] and followed a moderate path within the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].  He sided with the [[Schmalkaldic League]] and opposed [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]. After John's death, Anne's brother [[Wilhelm, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|William]] became [[United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg]], bearing the promising epithet \"The Rich\". In 1526, her elder sister [[Sibylle of Cleves|Sibylle]] was married to [[John Frederick, Elector of Saxony]], head of the [[Schmalkaldic League|Protestant Confederation of Germany]] and considered the \"Champion of the Reformation\".\n\nAt the age of 11 (1527), Anne was betrothed to [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine|Francis]], son and heir of [[Antoine, Duke of Lorraine]] while he was only 10.{{sfn|Norton|2010|pp=12\u201313}} Thus the betrothal was considered unofficial and was cancelled in 1535.

Cromwell oversaw the talks and a marriage treaty was signed on 4 October of that year.\n\nHenry valued education and cultural sophistication in women, but Anne lacked these.  She had received no formal education but was skilled in needlework and liked playing card games. She could read and write, but only in German.{{sfn|Norton|2010|pp=10\u201311}} Nevertheless, Anne was considered gentle, virtuous and docile, which is why she was recommended as a suitable candidate for Henry.\n\nAnne was described by the French ambassador, [[Charles de Marillac]], as tall and slim, \"of middling beauty and of very assured and resolute countenance\".{{sfn|Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII 15: 1540 no. 22}} She was fair haired and was said to have had a lovely face.

When the king finally met Anne, he was reportedly shocked by her plain appearance, and the marriage was never consummated.{{sfn|Elton|1991|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Z15sBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&dq=cromwell+anne+of+cleves+downfall&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIktfDyZ3VAhXG7IMKHb-cCXM4ChDoAQgtMAE#v=onepage&q=cromwell%20anne%20of%20cleves%20downfall&f=false 157]}}{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA77&dq=cromwell+anne+of+cleves+Duchess+of+Milan+%22as+the+golden+sun+did+the+silver&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz1ZC0z53VAhUN0IMKHWSfAnkQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=cromwell%20anne%20of%20cleves%20Duchess%20of%20Milan%20%22as%20the%20golden%20sun%20did%20the%20silver&f=false 77]}}\n\nHenry urged Cromwell to find a legal way to avoid the marriage but, by this point, doing so was impossible without endangering the vital alliance with the Germans. In his anger and frustration the King finally turned on Cromwell, to his subsequent regret.{{sfn|Lehmberg|1977|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=MhY9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA127&dq=Henry+VIII+execution+of+cromwell+later+regretted&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiH8P_L0Z3VAhVJ44MKHdxECwQQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Henry%20VIII%20execution%20of%20cromwell%20later%20regretted&f=false 127]}}\n\n=== Marriage ===\n[[File:Bruyn Anne of Cleves.jpg|right|thumb|A portrait of Anne in the 1540s by [[Barthel Bruyn the Elder|Bartholom\u00e4us Bruyn the elder]].]]\n\nDespite Henry's very vocal misgivings, the two were married on 6 January 1540 at the royal [[Palace of Placentia]] in [[Greenwich]], London, by [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishop]] [[Thomas Cranmer]]. The phrase \"God send me well to keep\" was engraved around Anne's wedding ring. Immediately after arriving in England, Anne conformed to the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] form of worship, which Henry expected.{{sfn|Weir|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=M1yHXitDdyQC&pg=PA412&lpg=PA412 412]}} The couple's first night as husband and wife was not a successful one.

Witness statements were taken from a number of courtiers and two physicians which register the king's disappointment at her appearance. Henry had also commented to [[Groom of the Stool#Grooms of the Stool under Henry VIII|Thomas Heneage and Anthony Denny]] that he could not believe she was a virgin.{{sfn|Strype I(II)|1822|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalme0102stry#page/450/mode/2up 450\u2013463]}}\n\nShortly afterwards, Anne was asked for her consent to an annulment, to which she agreed.  Cromwell, the moving force behind the marriage, was [[attainder|attainted]] for [[treason]]. The marriage was annulled on 9 July 1540, on the grounds of non-consummation and her pre-contract to Francis of Lorraine. Henry VIII's physician stated that after the wedding night, Henry said he was not impotent because he experienced \"''{{lang|la|duas pollutiones nocturnas in somno}}''\" (two [[nocturnal emission|nocturnal pollutions]] while in sleep; i.e., two [[wet dream]]s).{{sfn|Strype I(II)|1822|p=[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalme0102stry#page/460/mode/2up 461]}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Holbein en Angleterre |work=Amateur d'Art, par Lunettes Rouge |date=29 November 2006 |publisher=[[Le Monde|La Vie\u2013Le Monde Group]] |url=http://lunettesrouges.blog.lemonde.fr/2006/11/29/holbein-en-angleterre/ |accessdate=4 January 2014 |language=fr }}.</ref>\n\n==After the annulment==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Anne of Cleves.svg|thumb|250px|Anne of Cleves' arms as queen consort.{{sfn|Boutell|1863|p=243}}]]\n\nThe former queen received a generous [[legal settlement|settlement]], including [[Richmond Palace]], and [[Hever Castle]], home of Henry's former in-laws, the Boleyns.

Henry and Anne became good friends\u2014she was an honorary member of the King's family and was referred to as \"the King's Beloved Sister\". She was invited to court often and, out of gratitude for her not contesting the annulment, Henry decreed that she would be given precedence over all women in England save his own wife and daughters.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=108}}\n\nAfter [[Catherine Howard]] was beheaded, Anne and her brother, [[William, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg]], pressed the king to remarry Anne.

She is the only wife of Henry VIII to be buried in the Abbey.\n\nAnne's [[epitaph]] in Westminster Abbey, which is in English, reads simply:<ref>Google Images</ref>\n\n<center>ANNE OF CLEVES</center>\n<center>QUEEN OF ENGLAND</center>\n<center>BORN 1515 * DIED 1557</center>\n\nShe also has the distinction of being the last of Henry VIII's wives to die,{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=165}} as she outlived Henry's last wife, [[Catherine Parr]], by 9 years. She was not the longest-lived, however, since [[Catherine of Aragon]] was 50 at the time of her death.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=161}}\n\n==Literature==\nAnne is the subject of four biographies: Julia Hamilton's ''Anne of Cleves'' (1972), and Mary Saaler's ''Anne of Cleves: Fourth Wife of Henry VIII'' (1995), [[Elizabeth Norton]]'s ''Anne of Cleves: Henry VIII's Discarded Bride'' (2009), and Heather Darsie's ''Anna, Duchess of Cleves: The King's Beloved Sister'' (2019). Retha Warnicke has written an academic study on Anne's marriage called ''The Marrying of Anne of Cleves. Royal Protocol in Early Modern England'' (2000).\n\nAnne of Cleves appears as a character in many historical novels about Henry's reign. In ''[[The Fifth Queen]]'' (1906) by [[Ford Madox Ford]] she is portrayed as a sensible, practical woman who happily settles for  an annulment in return for  the material benefits it brings. Anne of Cleves is the main character of ''My Lady of Cleves'' (1946) by [[Margaret Campbell Barnes]]. About a third of ''[[The Boleyn Inheritance]]'' (2006) by [[Philippa Gregory]] is recounted from Anne's point of view, covering the period of Henry VIII's marriages to her and to her successor Catherine Howard. The book concludes with Anne living away from court, and avoiding the execution ceremonies of Howard and of [[Jane Boleyn]], sister-in-law to one of Henry's queens and lady-in-waiting to five of the others, including Anne. Gregory includes Anne in a non-fictional review of the period at the end of the book.\n\nAnne and her Holbein portrait in the Louvre are the focus of the novel ''Amenable Women'' (2009) by [[Mavis Cheek]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Annis |title=Amenable Women by Mavis Cheek |work=HistoricalNovels.info |url=http://www.historicalnovels.info/Amenable-Women.html |accessdate=2 April 2012 }}; {{cite web|title=Amenable Women, Mavis Cheek |work=Faber & Faber |url=http://www.faber.co.uk/work/amenable-women/9780571238965/ |accessdate=2 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515022239/http://www.faber.co.uk/work/amenable-women/9780571238965/ |archivedate=15 May 2009 }}</ref> Anne and Catherine Howard are the subject of ''The Queen's Mistake'' by Diane Haeger (2009), while Anne and Jane Seymour are covered in Volume 3 of Dixie Atkins's tetralogy ''A Golden Sorrow'' (2010). D. Lawrence-Young authored a [[biographical novel]] \"Anne of Cleves \u2013 Henry's Luckiest Wife\" published by GMTA/Celestial Press. N.C. USA, 2013.\n\nIn May 2019 [[Alison Weir]] released her fourth Six Tudor Queens Novel, ''Anna of Kleve: Queen of Secrets.'' The novel follows her throughout her life, first in Germany then Tudor England.\n\n==In film and television==\nThe role of Anne of Cleves was played by:\n* [[Elsa Lanchester]] in ''[[The Private Life of Henry VIII]]'', which was released in 1933.

In March 1539, negotiations for Anne's marriage to Henry began, as Henry believed that he needed to form a political alliance with her brother, [[Wilhelm, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|William]], who was a leader of the Protestants of western Germany, to strengthen his position against potential attacks from Catholic France and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref>http://blog.english-heritage.org.uk/henry-viii-and-anne-of-cleves/</ref>\n\nAnne arrived in England on 27 December 1539 and married Henry on 6 January 1540. However, after six months, the marriage was declared [[unconsummated]] and, as a result, she was not crowned [[queen consort]]. Following the [[annulment]], she was given a generous settlement by the King, and thereafter referred to as ''the King's Beloved Sister''.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=108}}{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA252#v=onepage&q&f=false 252]}} She lived to see the coronation of [[Queen Mary I]], outliving the rest of Henry's wives.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=165}}\n\n==Early life==\nAnne was born in 1515, on either 22 September,{{sfn|Weir|2009|p=155}}{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=7}} or more probably 28 June.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Darsie |first1=Heather |title=Anna, Duchess of Cleves: The King's Beloved Sister |date=15 April 2019 |publisher=Amberley Publishing |isbn=9781445677101 |pages=17\u201320}}</ref> She was born in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]],<ref>At the time, the area was in the Duchy of Berg.</ref> the second daughter of [[John III, Duke of Cleves|John III]] of the [[House of La Marck]], Duke of [[Duchy of J\u00fclich|J\u00fclich]] ''[[jure uxoris]]'', [[Duchy of Cleves|Cleves]], [[Berg (state)|Berg]] ''jure uxoris'', Count of [[County of Mark|Mark]], also known as [[de la Marck]] and [[County of Ravensberg|Ravensberg]] ''jure uxoris'' (often referred to as Duke of Cleves) who died in 1538, and his wife [[Maria of J\u00fclich-Berg|Maria, Duchess of Julich-Berg]] (1491\u20131543). She grew up in [[Schloss Burg (Solingen)|Schloss Burg]] on the edge of [[Solingen]].\n\nAnne's father was influenced by [[Erasmus]] and followed a moderate path within the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].  He sided with the [[Schmalkaldic League]] and opposed [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]. After John's death, Anne's brother [[Wilhelm, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|William]] became [[United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg]], bearing the promising epithet \"The Rich\". In 1526, her elder sister [[Sibylle of Cleves|Sibylle]] was married to [[John Frederick, Elector of Saxony]], head of the [[Schmalkaldic League|Protestant Confederation of Germany]] and considered the \"Champion of the Reformation\".\n\nAt the age of 11 (1527), Anne was betrothed to [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine|Francis]], son and heir of [[Antoine, Duke of Lorraine]] while he was only 10.{{sfn|Norton|2010|pp=12\u201313}} Thus the betrothal was considered unofficial and was cancelled in 1535. Her brother William was a [[Lutheran]] but the family was unaligned religiously, with her mother, the Duchess Maria, described as a \"strict Catholic\".{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HKynDn8DnhEC&pg=PT369&lpg=PT369#v=onepage&q&f=false 364]}} The Duke's ongoing dispute over [[Guelders|Gelderland]] with Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] made them suitable allies for England's King Henry VIII in the wake of the [[Truce of Nice]]. The match with Anne was urged on the King by his chief minister, [[Thomas Cromwell]].\n\n===Wedding preparations===\nThe artist [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] was dispatched to [[D\u00fcren]] to paint portraits of Anne and her younger sister, [[Amalia of Cleves|Amalia]], each of whom Henry was considering as his fourth wife. Henry required the artist to be as accurate as possible, not to flatter the sisters. The two versions of Holbein's portrait are in the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]] in Paris and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.

Cromwell oversaw the talks and a marriage treaty was signed on 4 October of that year.\n\nHenry valued education and cultural sophistication in women, but Anne lacked these.  She had received no formal education but was skilled in needlework and liked playing card games. She could read and write, but only in German.{{sfn|Norton|2010|pp=10\u201311}} Nevertheless, Anne was considered gentle, virtuous and docile, which is why she was recommended as a suitable candidate for Henry.\n\nAnne was described by the French ambassador, [[Charles de Marillac]], as tall and slim, \"of middling beauty and of very assured and resolute countenance\".{{sfn|Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII 15: 1540 no. 22}} She was fair haired and was said to have had a lovely face. In the words of the chronicler [[Edward Hall]], \"Her hair hanging down, which was fair, yellow and long ... she was apparelled after the English fashion, with a French hood, which so set forth her beauty and good visage, that every creature rejoiced to behold her\".{{sfn|Hall|1809|pp=836\u2013837}} She appeared rather solemn by English standards, and looked old for her age. Holbein painted her with high forehead, heavy-lidded eyes and a pointed chin.\n\nHenry met her privately on New Year's Day 1540 at Rochester Abbey in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] on her journey from [[Dover]].{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false 138]}} Henry and some of his courtiers, following a courtly-love tradition, went disguised into the room where Anne was staying.{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false 138]}} [[Eustace Chapuys]] reported:\n{{Wives of Henry VIII}}\n\n<blockquote>[The King] so went up into the chamber where the said Lady Anne was looking out of a window to see the bull-baiting which was going on in the courtyard, and suddenly he embraced and kissed her, and showed her a token which the king had sent her for New Year\u2019s gift, and she being abashed and not knowing who it was thanked him, and so he spoke with her. But she regarded him little, but always looked out the window\u2026. and when the king saw that she took so little notice of his coming he went into another chamber and took off his cloak and came in again in a coat of purple velvet. And when the lords and knights saw his grace they did him reverence.<ref>[https://thehistoryjar.com/2017/01/06/anne-of-cleves-not-love-at-first-sight/ \"Anne of Cleves \u2013 Not Love at First Sight\" ''The History Jar''] retrieved February 6, 2017</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to the testimony of his companions, he was disappointed with Anne, feeling she was not as described. According to the chronicler [[Charles Wriothesley]], Anne \"regarded him little\",{{sfn|Wriothesley|1875|pp=109\u2013110}} though it is unknown whether she knew this was the king.{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA132#v=onepage&q&f=false 132]}} Henry did then reveal his true identity to Anne, although he is said to have been put off the marriage from then on. Henry and Anne then met officially on 3 January on Blackheath outside the gates of Greenwich Park, where a grand reception was laid out.{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false 146]}}\n\nMost historians believe that he later used as excuses Anne's alleged unsatisfactory appearance and failure to inspire him to consummate the marriage, saying he felt he had been misled, for everyone had praised Anne's attractions: \"She is nothing so fair as she hath been reported\", he complained.{{sfn|Schofield|2011|p=361}} Cromwell received some of the blame for the portrait by Holbein which Henry believed had not been an accurate representation of Anne and for some of the exaggerated reports of her beauty. When the king finally met Anne, he was reportedly shocked by her plain appearance, and the marriage was never consummated.{{sfn|Elton|1991|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Z15sBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&dq=cromwell+anne+of+cleves+downfall&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIktfDyZ3VAhXG7IMKHb-cCXM4ChDoAQgtMAE#v=onepage&q=cromwell%20anne%20of%20cleves%20downfall&f=false 157]}}{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA77&dq=cromwell+anne+of+cleves+Duchess+of+Milan+%22as+the+golden+sun+did+the+silver&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz1ZC0z53VAhUN0IMKHWSfAnkQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=cromwell%20anne%20of%20cleves%20Duchess%20of%20Milan%20%22as%20the%20golden%20sun%20did%20the%20silver&f=false 77]}}\n\nHenry urged Cromwell to find a legal way to avoid the marriage but, by this point, doing so was impossible without endangering the vital alliance with the Germans. In his anger and frustration the King finally turned on Cromwell, to his subsequent regret.{{sfn|Lehmberg|1977|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=MhY9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA127&dq=Henry+VIII+execution+of+cromwell+later+regretted&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiH8P_L0Z3VAhVJ44MKHdxECwQQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Henry%20VIII%20execution%20of%20cromwell%20later%20regretted&f=false 127]}}\n\n=== Marriage ===\n[[File:Bruyn Anne of Cleves.jpg|right|thumb|A portrait of Anne in the 1540s by [[Barthel Bruyn the Elder|Bartholom\u00e4us Bruyn the elder]].]]\n\nDespite Henry's very vocal misgivings, the two were married on 6 January 1540 at the royal [[Palace of Placentia]] in [[Greenwich]], London, by [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishop]] [[Thomas Cranmer]]. The phrase \"God send me well to keep\" was engraved around Anne's wedding ring. Immediately after arriving in England, Anne conformed to the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] form of worship, which Henry expected.{{sfn|Weir|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=M1yHXitDdyQC&pg=PA412&lpg=PA412 412]}} The couple's first night as husband and wife was not a successful one.

Witness statements were taken from a number of courtiers and two physicians which register the king's disappointment at her appearance. Henry had also commented to [[Groom of the Stool#Grooms of the Stool under Henry VIII|Thomas Heneage and Anthony Denny]] that he could not believe she was a virgin.{{sfn|Strype I(II)|1822|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalme0102stry#page/450/mode/2up 450\u2013463]}}\n\nShortly afterwards, Anne was asked for her consent to an annulment, to which she agreed.  Cromwell, the moving force behind the marriage, was [[attainder|attainted]] for [[treason]]. The marriage was annulled on 9 July 1540, on the grounds of non-consummation and her pre-contract to Francis of Lorraine. Henry VIII's physician stated that after the wedding night, Henry said he was not impotent because he experienced \"''{{lang|la|duas pollutiones nocturnas in somno}}''\" (two [[nocturnal emission|nocturnal pollutions]] while in sleep; i.e., two [[wet dream]]s).{{sfn|Strype I(II)|1822|p=[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalme0102stry#page/460/mode/2up 461]}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Holbein en Angleterre |work=Amateur d'Art, par Lunettes Rouge |date=29 November 2006 |publisher=[[Le Monde|La Vie\u2013Le Monde Group]] |url=http://lunettesrouges.blog.lemonde.fr/2006/11/29/holbein-en-angleterre/ |accessdate=4 January 2014 |language=fr }}.</ref>\n\n==After the annulment==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Anne of Cleves.svg|thumb|250px|Anne of Cleves' arms as queen consort.{{sfn|Boutell|1863|p=243}}]]\n\nThe former queen received a generous [[legal settlement|settlement]], including [[Richmond Palace]], and [[Hever Castle]], home of Henry's former in-laws, the Boleyns.

In it, she mentions her brother, sister, and sister-in-law, as well as the future Queen Elizabeth, the Duchess of Suffolk, and the Countess of Arundel.{{sfn|Norton|2010|pp=158\u2013161}} She left some money to her servants and asked Mary and Elizabeth to employ them in their households.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=161}} She was remembered by everyone who served her as a particularly generous and easy-going mistress.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=165}}\n\nAnne died at Chelsea Old Manor on 16 July 1557, eight weeks before her forty-second birthday. The most likely cause of her death was [[cancer]].{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HKynDn8DnhEC&pg=PT507#v=onepage&q&f=false 504]}} She was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], on 3&nbsp;August,{{sfn|Machyn|1968|pp=145\u2013146}} in what has been described as a \"somewhat hard to find tomb\" on the opposite side of [[Edward the Confessor]]'s shrine and slightly above eye level for a person of average height. She is the only wife of Henry VIII to be buried in the Abbey.\n\nAnne's [[epitaph]] in Westminster Abbey, which is in English, reads simply:<ref>Google Images</ref>\n\n<center>ANNE OF CLEVES</center>\n<center>QUEEN OF ENGLAND</center>\n<center>BORN 1515 * DIED 1557</center>\n\nShe also has the distinction of being the last of Henry VIII's wives to die,{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=165}} as she outlived Henry's last wife, [[Catherine Parr]], by 9 years. She was not the longest-lived, however, since [[Catherine of Aragon]] was 50 at the time of her death.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=161}}\n\n==Literature==\nAnne is the subject of four biographies: Julia Hamilton's ''Anne of Cleves'' (1972), and Mary Saaler's ''Anne of Cleves: Fourth Wife of Henry VIII'' (1995), [[Elizabeth Norton]]'s ''Anne of Cleves: Henry VIII's Discarded Bride'' (2009), and Heather Darsie's ''Anna, Duchess of Cleves: The King's Beloved Sister'' (2019). Retha Warnicke has written an academic study on Anne's marriage called ''The Marrying of Anne of Cleves. Royal Protocol in Early Modern England'' (2000).\n\nAnne of Cleves appears as a character in many historical novels about Henry's reign. In ''[[The Fifth Queen]]'' (1906) by [[Ford Madox Ford]] she is portrayed as a sensible, practical woman who happily settles for  an annulment in return for  the material benefits it brings. Anne of Cleves is the main character of ''My Lady of Cleves'' (1946) by [[Margaret Campbell Barnes]]. About a third of ''[[The Boleyn Inheritance]]'' (2006) by [[Philippa Gregory]] is recounted from Anne's point of view, covering the period of Henry VIII's marriages to her and to her successor Catherine Howard. The book concludes with Anne living away from court, and avoiding the execution ceremonies of Howard and of [[Jane Boleyn]], sister-in-law to one of Henry's queens and lady-in-waiting to five of the others, including Anne. Gregory includes Anne in a non-fictional review of the period at the end of the book.\n\nAnne and her Holbein portrait in the Louvre are the focus of the novel ''Amenable Women'' (2009) by [[Mavis Cheek]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Annis |title=Amenable Women by Mavis Cheek |work=HistoricalNovels.info |url=http://www.historicalnovels.info/Amenable-Women.html |accessdate=2 April 2012 }}; {{cite web|title=Amenable Women, Mavis Cheek |work=Faber & Faber |url=http://www.faber.co.uk/work/amenable-women/9780571238965/ |accessdate=2 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515022239/http://www.faber.co.uk/work/amenable-women/9780571238965/ |archivedate=15 May 2009 }}</ref> Anne and Catherine Howard are the subject of ''The Queen's Mistake'' by Diane Haeger (2009), while Anne and Jane Seymour are covered in Volume 3 of Dixie Atkins's tetralogy ''A Golden Sorrow'' (2010). D. Lawrence-Young authored a [[biographical novel]] \"Anne of Cleves \u2013 Henry's Luckiest Wife\" published by GMTA/Celestial Press. N.C. USA, 2013.\n\nIn May 2019 [[Alison Weir]] released her fourth Six Tudor Queens Novel, ''Anna of Kleve: Queen of Secrets.'' The novel follows her throughout her life, first in Germany then Tudor England.\n\n==In film and television==\nThe role of Anne of Cleves was played by:\n* [[Elsa Lanchester]] in ''[[The Private Life of Henry VIII]]'', which was released in 1933. Lanchester's husband [[Charles Laughton]] played Henry VIII and won an Academy Award for his portrayal.<ref>{{Allmovie title|39313|The Private Life of Henry VIII}}</ref>\n* [[Elvi Hale]] in the episode ''Anne of Cleves'' in the 1971 television series ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (BBC TV series)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/sixwivesof.htm |title=Six Wives of Henry VII, The |website=Encyclopedia of Television |publisher=Museum of Broadcast Communications |access-date=2019-01-03 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> This series portrays Anne as a personally naive yet politically clever woman who convinces Henry against consummating the union so that he can get out of his alliance with the Germans should the need arise.

The series also has an anachronistically svelte Henry engaging in an affair with Anne after his marriage to Catherine Howard, realizing too late that he \"like[s] her after all.\"\n* Alexia McIntosh portrays a hilariously confident Cleves in ''[[Six (musical)|Six]]'' the Musical on the West End, emphasizing her life after her marriage to Henry, as well as the money and power she acquired after their annulment. There are currently multiple productions internationally in countries such as the United States, Australia, United Kingdom, and Norwegian Cruise Lines.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Boutell\n  |first=Charles\n  |author-link=Charles Boutell\n  |title=A Manual of Heraldry, Historical and Popular\n  |location=London\n  |publisher=Winsor and Newton\n  |year=1863\n  |url=https://archive.org/stream/amanualheraldry00boutgoog#page/n346/mode/2up\n  |ref={{sfnref|Boutell|1863}}\n}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Darsie |first1=Heather |title=Anna, Duchess of Cleves: The King's 'Beloved Sister' |date=2019 |publisher=Amberley |location=Stroud |isbn=978-1-4456-7710-1}}\n* {{cite web|editor=Dasent, John Roche\n  |title=Acts of the Privy Council\n  |volume=2\n  |year=1890\n  |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/source.aspx?pubid=1177&sp=3&pg=82\n  |publisher=British-history.ac.uk\n  |accessdate=5 January 2014\n  |ref={{sfnref|Acts of the Privy Council 2}}\n}}\n* {{cite book|last=Ellis\n  |first=Henry\n  |author-link=Henry Ellis (librarian)\n  |chapter=Extracts from the Proceedings of Privy Council from the Year 1545 to the Year 1558\n  |title=Archaeologia: or Miscellaneous Tracts Relating to Antiquity\n  |volume=XVIII\n  |location=London\n  |publisher=Society of Antiquaries of London\n  |year=1817\n  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8FEMAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA131#v=onepage&q&f=false\n  |ref={{sfnref|Ellis|1817}}\n}}\n* {{cite book|last=Elton\n  |first=G.
