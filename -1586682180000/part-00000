those with DLB \"might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care\".<ref name=Mueller2017/> An increased rate of hospitalization compared to AD is most commonly related to hallucinations and confusion, followed by falls and infection.<ref name= Tahami2019/>  \n\nLife expectancy is difficult to predict, and limited study data are available.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Survival may be defined from the point of disease onset, or from the point of diagnosis.<ref name=Mueller2017/>  A 2017 review found survival from disease onset between 5.5 and 7.7&nbsp;years, survival from diagnosis between 1.9 and 6.3&nbsp;years, and a shorter survival time after diagnosis than in AD.

look away or look at something else, focus on or try to touch the hallucination, wait for it to go away on its own, and speak with others about the visualization.<ref name=Burghaus2012/> Delusions and hallucinations may be reduced by increasing lighting in the evening, and making sure there is no light at night when the individual with DLB is sleeping.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWith the increased risk of antipsychotics for people with DLB, educated caregivers are able to act as advocates for the person with DLB.<ref name=LBDACareMeds>{{cite web |url=

'allergic' to haloperidol and other neuroleptics\".<ref name=Gomperts2016/>  Caregiver training, [[watchful waiting]], identifying sources of pain, and increasing social interaction can help minimize agitation.<ref name=Boot2015/>  Individuals with dementia may not be able to communicate that they are in pain, and pain is a common trigger of agitation.<ref name=Boot2013/>  Medical alert bracelets or notices about medication sensitivity are available and can save lives.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWhen RBD is present, individuals and their caregivers can be counselled about the need to improve bedroom safety.<ref name=Walker2015/><ref name=StLouisNov2017/> Sleep-related injuries from falling or jumping out of bed can be avoided by lowering the height of the bed,<ref name= Taylor2020/> placing a mattress next to the bed to soften the impact of a fall, and removing sharp objects from around the bed.<ref name= Taylor2020/> Sharp surfaces near the bed can be padded, bed alarm systems may help with sleepwalking, and bed partners may find it safer to sleep in another room.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/> According to St Louis and Boeve, firearms should be locked away, out of the bedroom.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/>\n\nDriving ability may be impaired early in DLB because of visual hallucinations, movement issues related to parkinsonism, and fluctuations in cognitive ability, and at some point it becomes unsafe for the person to drive.<ref name=LBDAEarlyCare/> Driving ability is assessed as part of management and family members generally determine when driving privileges are removed.<ref name=Boot2013/><ref name=LBDAEarlyCare>{{cite web |url= https://www.lbda.org/go/early-stage-lbd-caregiving |title= Early stage LBD caregiving | publisher= [[Lewy Body Dementia

avoid falls.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe [[prognosis]] for DLB has not been well studied; early studies had methodological limitations, such as small [[Sample size determination|sample size]] and [[selection bias]].<ref name=Mueller2017/> Relative to AD, DLB generally leads to higher disability, lower [[life expectancy]] and a reduced [[quality of life]], with increased costs of care.<ref name= Tahami2019/> Depression, apathy, and visual hallucinations contribute to the reduced quality of life.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Decline may be more rapid when severe visuospatial deficits show up early in the course of the Lewy body dementias,<ref name=Walker2015/> when the [[Apolipoprotein |''APOE'' gene]] is present, or when AD\u2014or its [[biomarker]]s\u2014is also present.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The severity of orthostatic hypotension also predicts a worse prognosis.<ref name=Boot2015/>\n\nCompared to AD, which is better studied, memory is retained longer, while verbal fluency may be lost faster.<ref name=Mueller2017/> There are more neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB than AD, and they may emerge earlier, so according to Tahami<ref name= Tahami2019/> and Mueller, those with DLB \"might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care\".<ref name=Mueller2017/> An increased rate of hospitalization compared to AD is most commonly related to hallucinations and confusion, followed by falls and infection.<ref name= Tahami2019/>  \n\nLife expectancy is difficult to predict, and limited study data are available.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Survival may be defined from the point of disease onset, or from the point of diagnosis.<ref name=Mueller2017/>  A 2017 review found survival from disease onset between 5.5 and 7.7&nbsp;years, survival from diagnosis between 1.9 and 6.3&nbsp;years, and a shorter survival time after diagnosis than in AD. The difference in survival between AD and DLB could be because DLB is harder to diagnose, and may be diagnosed later in the course of the disease.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The US [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] writes that people with DLB typically live 8&nbsp;years following diagnosis, about the same as AD,<ref name=NINDS2019/> though some people with Lewy body dementias live for 20&nbsp;years.<ref name=NINDS2020Book/> Shorter life expectancy is more likely when visual hallucinations, abnormal gait, and variable cognition are present early on.<ref name=Mueller2017/> In the late part of the disease, people may be unable to care for themselves.<ref name=NIH2018Bas/> Falls\u2014caused by many factors including parkinsonism, dysautonomia, and frailness\u2014increase [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]].<ref name= Taylor2020/> [[Aspiration pneumonia]], a complication of [[Dysphasia|difficulty in swallowing]] that results from dysautonomia, commonly causes death among people with the Lewy body dementias.<ref name= Taylor2020/><ref name=Palma2018/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe Lewy body dementias are as a group the second most common form of neurodegnerative dementia after AD as of 2020.<ref name= Taylor2020/><ref name=Walker2015/> DLB itself is one of the three most common types of dementia, along with AD and vascular dementia.<ref name=NINDS2020Book>{{cite web|title=Lewy body dementia: Hope through research |url= https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Hope-Through-Research/Lewy-Body-Dementia-Hope-Through-Research |website= National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke |publisher = US National Institutes of Health |accessdate= March 18, 2020 |date= January 10, 2020}}</ref><ref name=Kosakav/>{{efn|name=CommonDem|Kosaka (2017) writes: \"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is now well known to be the second most frequent dementia following Alzheimer disease (AD).

Through his works, he became well-known in the West as well as the East.\n\n== Biography ==\n\nThe existing variations in the basic accounts of al-Farabi's origins and pedigree indicate that they were not recorded during his lifetime or soon thereafter by anyone with concrete information, but were based on hearsay or guesses (as is the case with other contemporaries of al-Farabi). Little is known about his life. Early sources include an autobiographical passage where al-Farabi traces the history of logic and philosophy up to his time, and brief mentions by [[Al-Masudi]], [[Ibn al-Nadim]] and [[Ibn Hawqal]]. [[Said Al-Andalusi]] wrote a biography of al-Farabi. [[Arabic]] biographers of the 12th\u201313th centuries thus had few facts to hand, and used invented stories about his life.<ref name=\"Iranica\"/>\n\nFrom incidental accounts it is known that he spent significant time (most of his life) in [[Baghdad]] with Christian scholars including the cleric Yuhanna ibn Haylan, Yahya ibn Adi, and Abu Ishaq Ibrahim al-Baghdadi. He later spent time in [[Damascus]] and in Egypt before returning to Damascus where he died in 950-1.<ref>Reisman, D.(ed.)''Before and After Avicenna''.

Thus, there are many places that carry the name (or various evolutions of that hydrological/geological toponym) in that general area, such as [[Otrar|F\u0101r\u0101b]] on the Jaxartes ([[Syr Darya]]) in modern [[Kazakhstan]], F\u0101r\u0101b (modern [[T\u00fcrkmenabat]]) on the Oxus [[Amu Darya]] in [[Turkmenistan]], or even[[Faryab Province|F\u0101ry\u0101b]] in [[Greater Khorasan]] (modern day Afghanistan).

In the auto-biographical passage preserved by [[Ibn Abi Osaybe'a|Ibn Ab\u012b U\u1e63aibi\u02bfa]], Farabi stated that he had studied logic, medicine and sociology with Y\u016b\u1e25ann\u0101 bin \u1e24ayl\u0101n up to and including Aristotle's ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', i.e., according to the order of the books studied in the curriculum, F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b was claiming that he had studied [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''Eisagoge'' and Aristotle's ''Categories'', ''De Interpretatione'', ''Prior and Posterior Analytics''. His teacher, bin \u1e24ayl\u0101n, was a [[Nestorian]] cleric. This period of study was probably in Baghdad, where [[Al-Masudi]] records that Y\u016b\u1e25ann\u0101 died during the reign of [[Al-Muqtadir]] (295-320/908-32). He was in Baghdad at least until the end of September 942, as recorded in notes in his ''Mab\u0101de\u02be \u0101r\u0101\u02be ahl al-mad\u012bna al-f\u0101\u017cela''.

Al-Farabi incorporated the [[Platonism|Platonic]] view, drawing a parallel from within the Islamic context, in that he regarded the ideal state to be ruled by the [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]]-[[imam]], instead of the philosopher-king envisaged by Plato. Al-Farabi argued that the ideal state was the city-state of [[Medina]] when it was governed by the prophet [[Muhammad]] as its [[head of state]], as he was in direct communion with [[Allah]] whose law was revealed to him.\n\n=== Physics ===\n\nAl-Farabi wrote a short treatise \"On Vacuum\", where he thought about the nature of the existence of [[vacuum|void]].<ref name=Stanford/> He also may have carried out the first [[experiment]]s concerning the existence of [[vacuum]], in which he investigated handheld plungers in water.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} His final conclusion was that air's volume can expand to fill available space, and he suggested that the concept of perfect vacuum was incoherent.<ref name=\"Stanford\"/>\n\n=== Psychology ===\n\nWrote ''Social Psychology'' and ''Principles of the Opinions of the Citizens of the Virtuous City'', which were the first treatises to deal with [[social psychology]].

A prolific writer, he is credited with over one hundred works.<ref>Black, D. ''Al-Farabi'' in Leaman, O & Nasr, H (2001). ''History of Islamic Philosophy''.

His ideas are marked by their coherency, despite drawing together of many different philosophical disciplines and traditions. Some other significant influences on his work were the planetary model of [[Ptolemy]] and elements of [[Neo-Platonism]],<ref>Motahhari, Mortaza, Becoming familiar with Islamic knowledge, V1, p:162</ref> particularly metaphysics and practical (or political) philosophy (which bears more resemblance to Plato's ''Republic'' than Aristotle's ''Politics'').<ref>Reisman, D.

Zimmermann published in 1981. Farabi had a great influence on [[Maimonides]], the most important Jewish thinker of the middle ages. Maimonides wrote in Arabic a ''Treatise on logic'', the celebrated ''Maqala fi sina at al-mantiq''. In a wonderfully concise way, the work treats of the essentials of Aristotelian logic in the light of comments made by the Persian philosophers: [[Avicenna]] and, above all, al-Farabi. [[R\u00e9mi Brague]]  in his book devoted to the Treatise stresses the fact that Farabi is the only thinker mentioned therein.\n\nAl-Farabi as well as [[Ibn Sina]] and [[Averroes]] have been recognized as [[Peripatetics]] (''al-Mashsha\u2019iyu''n) or [[Rationalism|rationalists]] (''Estedlaliun'') among Muslims.<ref>Motahhari, Morteza, Becoming familiar with Islamic knowledge, V1, p.166\n\u0627\u06af\u0631 \u0628\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u0643\u0644\u0645\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0647\n\u0643\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0631\u064a\u0645 \u0643\u0647 \u0645\u0641\u064a\u062f \u0645\u0641\u0647\u0648\u0645 \u0631\u0648\u0634 \u0641\u0644\u0633\u0641\u06cc \u0645\u0634\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u062f \u0628\u0627\u064a\u062f \u0643\u0644\u0645\u0647 ( \u0627\u0633\u062a\u062f\u0644\u0627\u0644\u06cc ) \u0631\u0627\n\u0628\u0647 \u0643\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0631\u064a\u0645  .\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/pd/d-22.htm |title=Dictionary of Islamic Philosophical Terms |publisher=Muslimphilosophy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H002 |title=Aristotelianism in Islamic philosophy |publisher=Muslimphilosophy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-19}}</ref> However, he tried to gather the ideas of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] in his book \"The gathering of the ideas of the two philosophers\".<ref>Motahhari, Mortaza, Becoming familiar with Islamic knowledge, V1, p.167\n\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0628\u06cc \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0643\u0648\u0686\u0643 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f \u0628\u0647 \u0646\u0627\u0645 ( \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0639 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0631\u0623\u064a\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u064a\u0645\u064a\u0646 ) \u062f\u0631\n\u0627\u064a\u0646 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0633\u0627\u0626\u0644 \u0627\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0641\u06cc \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u062f\u0648 \u0641\u064a\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0641 \u0637\u0631\u062d \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0648 \u0643\u0648\u0634\u0634 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0643\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u0646\u062d\u0648\u06cc\n\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0645\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u062f\u0648 \u062d\u0643\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0632 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u0648\u062f .</ref>\n\nAccording to Adamson, his work was singularly directed towards the goal of simultaneously reviving and reinventing the Alexandrian philosophical tradition, to which his Christian teacher, Yuhanna bin Haylan belonged. His success should be measured by the honorific title of \"the second master\" of philosophy (Aristotle being the first), by which he was known.<ref name=psych/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Mahdi|first1=Muhsin|title=Alfarabi: Philosophy of Plato and Aristotle|date=1962|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=0801487161|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-SaXczxPo40C&pg=PA4&dq=al-farabi+the+second+master#v=onepage&q=al-farabi%20the%20second%20master&f=false|accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref> Adamson also says that he does not make any reference to the ideas of either [[al-Kindi]] or his contemporary, [[Abu Bakr al-Razi]], which clearly indicates that he did not consider their approach to Philosophy as a correct or viable one.<ref>Reisman, p55</ref>\n\n== Thought ==\n\n=== Metaphysics and cosmology ===\n\nIn contrast to [[al-Kindi]], who considered the subject of metaphysics to be God, al-Farabi believed that it was concerned primarily with being ''qua'' being (that is, being in and of itself), and this is related to God only to the extent that God is a principle of absolute being. Al-Kindi's view was, however, a common misconception regarding Greek philosophy amongst Muslim intellectuals at the time, and it was for this reason that [[Avicenna]] remarked that he did not understand Aristotle's ''Metaphysics'' properly until he had read a prolegomenon written by al-Farabi.<ref>Black, p188</ref>\n\nAl-Farabi's cosmology is essentially based upon three pillars: Aristotelian metaphysics of causation, highly developed [[Plotinus|Plotinian]] [[emanationism|emanational cosmology]] and the Ptolemaic astronomy.<ref>Reisman, p56</ref> In his model, the universe is viewed as a number of concentric circles; the outermost sphere or \"first heaven\", the sphere of fixed stars, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and finally, the Moon. At the centre of these concentric circles is the sub-lunar realm which contains the material world.<ref name=\"Black, p189 \">Black, p189</ref> Each of these circles represent the domain of the secondary intelligences (symbolized by the celestial bodies themselves), which act as causal intermediaries between the First Cause (in this case, God) and the material world. Furthermore these are said to have emanated from God, who is both their formal and efficient cause.\n\nThe process of emanation begins (metaphysically, not temporally) with the First Cause, whose principal activity is self-contemplation. And it is this intellectual activity that underlies its role in the creation of the universe. The First Cause, by thinking of itself, \"overflows\" and the incorporeal entity of the second intellect \"emanates\" from it. Like its predecessor, the second intellect also thinks about itself, and thereby brings its celestial sphere (in this case, the sphere of fixed stars) into being, but in addition to this it must also contemplate upon the First Cause, and this causes the \"emanation\" of the next intellect. The cascade of emanation continues until it reaches the tenth intellect, beneath which is the material world. And as each intellect must contemplate both itself and an increasing number of predecessors, each succeeding level of existence becomes more and more complex. This process is based upon necessity as opposed to will. In other words, God does not have a choice whether or not to create the universe, but by virtue of His own existence, He causes it to be. This view also suggests that the universe is eternal, and both of these points were criticized by [[al-Ghazzali]] in his attack on the philosophers<ref>Reisman, p57</ref><ref>Corbin, H. (1993). ''History of Islamic Philosophy''. London: Keagan Paul International. p161</ref>\n\nIn his discussion of the First Cause (or God), al-Farabi relies heavily on [[negative theology]]. He says that it cannot be known by intellectual means, such as dialectical division or definition, because the terms used in these processes to define a thing constitute its substance. Therefore if one was to define the First Cause, each of the terms used would actually constitute a ''part'' of its substance and therefore behave as a ''cause'' for its existence, which is impossible as the First Cause is uncaused; it exists without being caused. Equally, he says it cannot be known according to genus and differentia, as its substance and existence are different from all others, and therefore it has no category to which it belongs. If this were the case, then it would not be the First Cause, because something would be prior in existence to it, which is also impossible. This would suggest that the more philosophically simple a thing is, the more perfect it is. And based on this observation, Adamson says it is possible to see the entire hierarchy of al-Farabi's cosmology according to classification into genus and species. Each succeeding level in this structure has as its principal qualities multiplicity and deficiency, and it is this ever-increasing complexity that typifies the material world.<ref>Reisman, p58-59</ref>\n\n=== Epistemology and eschatology ===\n\nHuman beings are unique in al-Farabi's vision of the universe because they stand between two worlds: the \"higher\", immaterial world of the celestial intellects and universal intelligibles, and the \"lower\", material world of generation and decay; they inhabit a physical body, and so belong to the \"lower\" world, but they also have a rational capacity, which connects them to the \"higher\" realm. Each level of existence in al-Farabi's cosmology is characterized by its movement towards perfection, which is to become like the First Cause; a perfect intellect. Human perfection (or \"happiness\"), then, is equated with constant intellection and contemplation.<ref>Reisman, p61</ref>\n\nAl-Farabi divides intellect into four categories: potential, actual, acquired and the Agent. The first three are the different states of the human intellect and the fourth is the [[Tenth Intellect]] (the moon) in his emanational cosmology. The potential intellect represents the capacity to think, which is shared by all human beings, and the actual intellect is an intellect engaged in the act of thinking. By thinking, al-Farabi means abstracting universal intelligibles from the sensory forms of objects which have been apprehended and retained in the individual's imagination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://umcc.ais.org/~maftab/ip/hmp/XXIII-TwentyThree.pdf |title=page 461 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325171417/http://umcc.ais.org/~maftab/ip/hmp/XXIII-TwentyThree.pdf |archivedate=2007-03-25 }}</ref>\n\nThis motion from potentiality to actuality requires the Agent Intellect to act upon the retained sensory forms; just as the Sun illuminates the physical world to allow us to see, the Agent Intellect illuminates the world of intelligibles to allow us to think.<ref name=\"Reisman, p64 \">Reisman, p64</ref> This illumination removes all accident (such as time, place, quality) and physicality from them, converting them into primary intelligibles, which are logical principles such as \"the whole is greater than the part\". The human intellect, by its act of intellection, passes from potentiality to actuality, and as it gradually comprehends these intelligibles, it is identified with them (as according to Aristotle, by knowing something, the intellect becomes like it).<ref name=\"Reisman, p63 \">Reisman, p63</ref> Because the Agent Intellect knows all of the intelligibles, this means that when the human intellect knows all of them, it becomes associated with the Agent Intellect's perfection and is known as the acquired Intellect.<ref name=\"Black, p186\">Black, p186</ref>\n\nWhile this process seems mechanical, leaving little room for human choice or volition, Reisman says that al-Farabi is committed to human voluntarism.<ref name=\"Reisman, p63 \"/> This takes place when man, based on the knowledge he has acquired, decides whether to direct himself towards virtuous or unvirtuous activities, and thereby decides whether or not to seek true happiness. And it is by choosing what is ethical and contemplating about what constitutes the nature of ethics, that the actual intellect can become \"like\" the active intellect, thereby attaining perfection. It is only by this process that a human soul may survive death, and live on in the afterlife.<ref name=\"Reisman, p64 \"/><ref>Corbin, p158</ref>\n\nAccording to al-Farabi, the afterlife is not the personal experience commonly conceived of by religious traditions such as [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]]. Any individual or distinguishing features of the soul are annihilated after the death of the body; only the rational faculty survives (and then, only if it has attained perfection), which becomes one with all other rational souls within the agent intellect and enters a realm of pure intelligence.<ref name=\"Black, p186\"/> [[Henry Corbin]] compares this eschatology with that of the Ismaili Neo-Platonists, for whom this process initiated the next grand cycle of the universe.<ref>Corbin, p165</ref> However, Deborah Black mentions we have cause to be skeptical as to whether this was the mature and developed view of al-Farabi, as later thinkers such as [[Ibn Tufayl]], [[Averroes]] and [[Ibn Bajjah]] would assert that he repudiated this view in his commentary on the [[Nicomachean Ethics]], which has been lost to modern experts.<ref name=\"Black, p186\"/>\n\n=== Psychology, the soul and prophetic knowledge ===\n\nIn his treatment of the human soul, al-Farabi draws on a basic Aristotelian outline, which is  informed by the commentaries of later Greek thinkers. He says it is composed of four faculties: The ''appetitive'' (the desire for, or aversion to an object of sense), the ''sensitive'' (the perception by the senses of corporeal substances), the ''imaginative'' (the faculty which retains images of sensible objects after they have been perceived, and then separates and combines them for a number of ends), and the ''rational'', which is the faculty of intellection.<ref>Black, p184</ref> It is the last of these which is unique to human beings and distinguishes them from plants and animals. It is also the only part of the soul to survive the death of the body. Noticeably absent from these scheme are internal senses, such as common sense, which would be discussed by later philosophers such as [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]].<ref>Reisman, p60-61</ref><ref>Black (2), D. ''Psychology: Soul and Intellect'' in Adamson, P and Taylor, R. (2005). ''The Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p313</ref>\n\nSpecial attention must be given to al-Farabi's treatment of the soul's ''imaginative'' faculty, which is essential to his interpretation of prophethood and prophetic knowledge. In addition to its ability to retain and manipulate sensible images of objects, he gives the imagination the function of imitation. By this he means the capacity to represent an object with an image other than its own. In other words, to imitate \"x\" is to imagine \"x\" by associating it with sensible qualities that do not describe its own appearance. This extends the representative ability of the imagination beyond sensible forms and to include temperaments, emotions, desires and even immaterial intelligibles or abstract universals, as happens when, for example, one associates \"evil\" with \"darkness\".<ref>Black (b), p313</ref><ref>Black, p185</ref> The prophet, in addition to his own intellectual capacity, has a very strong imaginative faculty, which allows him to receive an overflow of intelligibles from the agent intellect (the tenth intellect in the emanational cosmology). These intelligibles are then associated with symbols and images, which allow him to communicate abstract truths in a way that can be understood by ordinary people. Therefore what makes prophetic knowledge unique is not its content, which is also accessible to philosophers through demonstration and intellection, but rather the form that it is given by the prophet's imagination.<ref>Corbin, p164</ref><ref>Black, p187</ref>\n\n=== Practical philosophy (ethics and politics) ===\n\nThe practical application of philosophy was a major concern expressed by al-Farabi in many of his works, and while the majority of his philosophical output has been influenced by Aristotelian thought, his practical philosophy was unmistakably based on that of [[Plato]].<ref>Corbin, p162</ref> In a similar manner to [[Plato's Republic|Plato's ''Republic'']], al-Farabi emphasized that philosophy was both a theoretical and practical discipline; labeling those philosophers who do not apply their erudition to practical pursuits as \"futile philosophers\". The ideal society, he wrote, is one directed towards the realization of \"true happiness\" (which can be taken to mean philosophical enlightenment) and as such, the ideal philosopher must hone all the necessary arts of rhetoric and poetics to communicate abstract truths to the ordinary people, as well as having achieved enlightenment himself.<ref>Black, p190</ref> Al-Farabi compared the philosopher's role in relation to society with a physician in relation to the body; the body's health is affected by the \"balance of its [[humorism|humours]]\" just as the city is determined by the moral habits of its people. The philosopher's duty, he wrote, was to establish a \"virtuous\" society by healing the souls of the people, establishing justice and guiding them towards \"true happiness\".<ref>Butterworth, p278</ref>\n\nOf course, al-Farabi realized that such a society was rare and required a very specific set of historical circumstances to be realized, which means very few societies could ever attain this goal. He divided those \"vicious\" societies, which have fallen short of the ideal \"virtuous\" society, into three categories: ignorant, wicked and errant. ''Ignorant'' societies have, for whatever reason, failed to comprehend the purpose of human existence, and have supplanted the pursuit of happiness for another (inferior) goal, whether this be wealth, sensual gratification or power. Al-Farabi mentions  \"weeds\" in the virtuous society: those people who try to undermine its progress towards the true human end.<ref>Black, p191</ref> The best known Arabic source for al-Farabi's political philosophy is his work titled, ''al-Madina al-fadila'' (''The Virtuous City'').\n\nWhether or not al-Farabi actually intended to outline a political programme in his writings remains a matter of dispute amongst academics. [[Henry Corbin]], who considers al-Farabi to be a <nowiki>crypto-</nowiki>[[Shi'ite]], says that his ideas should be understood as a \"prophetic philosophy\" instead of being interpreted politically.<ref>Corbin, p162-163</ref> On the other hand, [[Charles Butterworth (philosopher)|Charles Butterworth]] contends that nowhere in his work does al-Farabi speak of a prophet-legislator or revelation (even the word philosophy is scarcely mentioned), and the main discussion that takes place concerns the positions of \"king\" and \"statesmen\".<ref>Butterworth, C. ''Ethical and Political Philosophy'' in Adamson, P and Taylor, R. (2005). ''The Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p276</ref> Occupying a middle position is David Reisman, who like Corbin believes that al-Farabi did not want to expound a political doctrine (although he does not go so far to attribute it to Islamic Gnosticism either). He argues that al-Farabi was using different types of society as examples, in the context of an ethical discussion, to show what effect correct or incorrect thinking could have.<ref>Reisman, p68</ref>  Lastly, [[Joshua Parens]] argues that al-Farabi was slyly asserting that a [[pan-Islamic]] society could not be made, by using reason to show how many conditions (such as moral and deliberative virtue) would have to be met, thus leading the reader to conclude that humans are not fit for such a society.<ref>Joshua Parens, An Islamic Philosophy of Virtuous Religions: Introducing Alfarabi (New York: State University of New York Press, 2006), 2.</ref> Some other authors like [[Mykhaylo Yakubovych]] argue that for al-Farabi religion (''milla'') and philosophy (''falsafa'') constituted the same praxeological value (i.e. basis for ''amal al-fadhil''\u2014\"virtuous deed\"), while its epistemological level (''ilm''\u2014\"knowledge\") was different.<ref>Mykhaylo Yakubovych.

Through his works, he became well-known in the West as well as the East.\n\n== Biography ==\n\nThe existing variations in the basic accounts of al-Farabi's origins and pedigree indicate that they were not recorded during his lifetime or soon thereafter by anyone with concrete information, but were based on hearsay or guesses (as is the case with other contemporaries of al-Farabi). Little is known about his life. Early sources include an autobiographical passage where al-Farabi traces the history of logic and philosophy up to his time, and brief mentions by [[Al-Masudi]], [[Ibn al-Nadim]] and [[Ibn Hawqal]]. [[Said Al-Andalusi]] wrote a biography of al-Farabi. [[Arabic]] biographers of the 12th\u201313th centuries thus had few facts to hand, and used invented stories about his life.<ref name=\"Iranica\"/>\n\nFrom incidental accounts it is known that he spent significant time (most of his life) in [[Baghdad]] with Christian scholars including the cleric Yuhanna ibn Haylan, Yahya ibn Adi, and Abu Ishaq Ibrahim al-Baghdadi. He later spent time in [[Damascus]] and in Egypt before returning to Damascus where he died in 950-1.<ref>Reisman, D.(ed.)''Before and After Avicenna''.

Thus, there are many places that carry the name (or various evolutions of that hydrological/geological toponym) in that general area, such as [[Otrar|F\u0101r\u0101b]] on the Jaxartes ([[Syr Darya]]) in modern [[Kazakhstan]], F\u0101r\u0101b (modern [[T\u00fcrkmenabat]]) on the Oxus [[Amu Darya]] in [[Turkmenistan]], or even[[Faryab Province|F\u0101ry\u0101b]] in [[Greater Khorasan]] (modern day Afghanistan).

Zimmermann published in 1981. Farabi had a great influence on [[Maimonides]], the most important Jewish thinker of the middle ages. Maimonides wrote in Arabic a ''Treatise on logic'', the celebrated ''Maqala fi sina at al-mantiq''. In a wonderfully concise way, the work treats of the essentials of Aristotelian logic in the light of comments made by the Persian philosophers: [[Avicenna]] and, above all, al-Farabi.

Al-Kindi's view was, however, a common misconception regarding Greek philosophy amongst Muslim intellectuals at the time, and it was for this reason that [[Avicenna]] remarked that he did not understand Aristotle's ''Metaphysics'' properly until he had read a prolegomenon written by al-Farabi.<ref>Black, p188</ref>\n\nAl-Farabi's cosmology is essentially based upon three pillars: Aristotelian metaphysics of causation, highly developed [[Plotinus|Plotinian]] [[emanationism|emanational cosmology]] and the Ptolemaic astronomy.<ref>Reisman, p56</ref> In his model, the universe is viewed as a number of concentric circles; the outermost sphere or \"first heaven\", the sphere of fixed stars, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and finally, the Moon. At the centre of these concentric circles is the sub-lunar realm which contains the material world.<ref name=\"Black, p189 \">Black, p189</ref> Each of these circles represent the domain of the secondary intelligences (symbolized by the celestial bodies themselves), which act as causal intermediaries between the First Cause (in this case, God) and the material world. Furthermore these are said to have emanated from God, who is both their formal and efficient cause.\n\nThe process of emanation begins (metaphysically, not temporally) with the First Cause, whose principal activity is self-contemplation. And it is this intellectual activity that underlies its role in the creation of the universe. The First Cause, by thinking of itself, \"overflows\" and the incorporeal entity of the second intellect \"emanates\" from it. Like its predecessor, the second intellect also thinks about itself, and thereby brings its celestial sphere (in this case, the sphere of fixed stars) into being, but in addition to this it must also contemplate upon the First Cause, and this causes the \"emanation\" of the next intellect. The cascade of emanation continues until it reaches the tenth intellect, beneath which is the material world. And as each intellect must contemplate both itself and an increasing number of predecessors, each succeeding level of existence becomes more and more complex. This process is based upon necessity as opposed to will. In other words, God does not have a choice whether or not to create the universe, but by virtue of His own existence, He causes it to be. This view also suggests that the universe is eternal, and both of these points were criticized by [[al-Ghazzali]] in his attack on the philosophers<ref>Reisman, p57</ref><ref>Corbin, H. (1993). ''History of Islamic Philosophy''. London: Keagan Paul International. p161</ref>\n\nIn his discussion of the First Cause (or God), al-Farabi relies heavily on [[negative theology]]. He says that it cannot be known by intellectual means, such as dialectical division or definition, because the terms used in these processes to define a thing constitute its substance. Therefore if one was to define the First Cause, each of the terms used would actually constitute a ''part'' of its substance and therefore behave as a ''cause'' for its existence, which is impossible as the First Cause is uncaused; it exists without being caused. Equally, he says it cannot be known according to genus and differentia, as its substance and existence are different from all others, and therefore it has no category to which it belongs. If this were the case, then it would not be the First Cause, because something would be prior in existence to it, which is also impossible. This would suggest that the more philosophically simple a thing is, the more perfect it is. And based on this observation, Adamson says it is possible to see the entire hierarchy of al-Farabi's cosmology according to classification into genus and species. Each succeeding level in this structure has as its principal qualities multiplicity and deficiency, and it is this ever-increasing complexity that typifies the material world.<ref>Reisman, p58-59</ref>\n\n=== Epistemology and eschatology ===\n\nHuman beings are unique in al-Farabi's vision of the universe because they stand between two worlds: the \"higher\", immaterial world of the celestial intellects and universal intelligibles, and the \"lower\", material world of generation and decay; they inhabit a physical body, and so belong to the \"lower\" world, but they also have a rational capacity, which connects them to the \"higher\" realm. Each level of existence in al-Farabi's cosmology is characterized by its movement towards perfection, which is to become like the First Cause; a perfect intellect. Human perfection (or \"happiness\"), then, is equated with constant intellection and contemplation.<ref>Reisman, p61</ref>\n\nAl-Farabi divides intellect into four categories: potential, actual, acquired and the Agent. The first three are the different states of the human intellect and the fourth is the [[Tenth Intellect]] (the moon) in his emanational cosmology. The potential intellect represents the capacity to think, which is shared by all human beings, and the actual intellect is an intellect engaged in the act of thinking. By thinking, al-Farabi means abstracting universal intelligibles from the sensory forms of objects which have been apprehended and retained in the individual's imagination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://umcc.ais.org/~maftab/ip/hmp/XXIII-TwentyThree.pdf |title=page 461 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325171417/http://umcc.ais.org/~maftab/ip/hmp/XXIII-TwentyThree.pdf |archivedate=2007-03-25 }}</ref>\n\nThis motion from potentiality to actuality requires the Agent Intellect to act upon the retained sensory forms; just as the Sun illuminates the physical world to allow us to see, the Agent Intellect illuminates the world of intelligibles to allow us to think.<ref name=\"Reisman, p64 \">Reisman, p64</ref> This illumination removes all accident (such as time, place, quality) and physicality from them, converting them into primary intelligibles, which are logical principles such as \"the whole is greater than the part\". The human intellect, by its act of intellection, passes from potentiality to actuality, and as it gradually comprehends these intelligibles, it is identified with them (as according to Aristotle, by knowing something, the intellect becomes like it).<ref name=\"Reisman, p63 \">Reisman, p63</ref> Because the Agent Intellect knows all of the intelligibles, this means that when the human intellect knows all of them, it becomes associated with the Agent Intellect's perfection and is known as the acquired Intellect.<ref name=\"Black, p186\">Black, p186</ref>\n\nWhile this process seems mechanical, leaving little room for human choice or volition, Reisman says that al-Farabi is committed to human voluntarism.<ref name=\"Reisman, p63 \"/> This takes place when man, based on the knowledge he has acquired, decides whether to direct himself towards virtuous or unvirtuous activities, and thereby decides whether or not to seek true happiness. And it is by choosing what is ethical and contemplating about what constitutes the nature of ethics, that the actual intellect can become \"like\" the active intellect, thereby attaining perfection. It is only by this process that a human soul may survive death, and live on in the afterlife.<ref name=\"Reisman, p64 \"/><ref>Corbin, p158</ref>\n\nAccording to al-Farabi, the afterlife is not the personal experience commonly conceived of by religious traditions such as [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]]. Any individual or distinguishing features of the soul are annihilated after the death of the body; only the rational faculty survives (and then, only if it has attained perfection), which becomes one with all other rational souls within the agent intellect and enters a realm of pure intelligence.<ref name=\"Black, p186\"/> [[Henry Corbin]] compares this eschatology with that of the Ismaili Neo-Platonists, for whom this process initiated the next grand cycle of the universe.<ref>Corbin, p165</ref> However, Deborah Black mentions we have cause to be skeptical as to whether this was the mature and developed view of al-Farabi, as later thinkers such as [[Ibn Tufayl]], [[Averroes]] and [[Ibn Bajjah]] would assert that he repudiated this view in his commentary on the [[Nicomachean Ethics]], which has been lost to modern experts.<ref name=\"Black, p186\"/>\n\n=== Psychology, the soul and prophetic knowledge ===\n\nIn his treatment of the human soul, al-Farabi draws on a basic Aristotelian outline, which is  informed by the commentaries of later Greek thinkers. He says it is composed of four faculties: The ''appetitive'' (the desire for, or aversion to an object of sense), the ''sensitive'' (the perception by the senses of corporeal substances), the ''imaginative'' (the faculty which retains images of sensible objects after they have been perceived, and then separates and combines them for a number of ends), and the ''rational'', which is the faculty of intellection.<ref>Black, p184</ref> It is the last of these which is unique to human beings and distinguishes them from plants and animals. It is also the only part of the soul to survive the death of the body. Noticeably absent from these scheme are internal senses, such as common sense, which would be discussed by later philosophers such as [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]].<ref>Reisman, p60-61</ref><ref>Black (2), D.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p313</ref>\n\nSpecial attention must be given to al-Farabi's treatment of the soul's ''imaginative'' faculty, which is essential to his interpretation of prophethood and prophetic knowledge. In addition to its ability to retain and manipulate sensible images of objects, he gives the imagination the function of imitation. By this he means the capacity to represent an object with an image other than its own. In other words, to imitate \"x\" is to imagine \"x\" by associating it with sensible qualities that do not describe its own appearance. This extends the representative ability of the imagination beyond sensible forms and to include temperaments, emotions, desires and even immaterial intelligibles or abstract universals, as happens when, for example, one associates \"evil\" with \"darkness\".<ref>Black (b), p313</ref><ref>Black, p185</ref> The prophet, in addition to his own intellectual capacity, has a very strong imaginative faculty, which allows him to receive an overflow of intelligibles from the agent intellect (the tenth intellect in the emanational cosmology). These intelligibles are then associated with symbols and images, which allow him to communicate abstract truths in a way that can be understood by ordinary people. Therefore what makes prophetic knowledge unique is not its content, which is also accessible to philosophers through demonstration and intellection, but rather the form that it is given by the prophet's imagination.<ref>Corbin, p164</ref><ref>Black, p187</ref>\n\n=== Practical philosophy (ethics and politics) ===\n\nThe practical application of philosophy was a major concern expressed by al-Farabi in many of his works, and while the majority of his philosophical output has been influenced by Aristotelian thought, his practical philosophy was unmistakably based on that of [[Plato]].<ref>Corbin, p162</ref> In a similar manner to [[Plato's Republic|Plato's ''Republic'']], al-Farabi emphasized that philosophy was both a theoretical and practical discipline; labeling those philosophers who do not apply their erudition to practical pursuits as \"futile philosophers\". The ideal society, he wrote, is one directed towards the realization of \"true happiness\" (which can be taken to mean philosophical enlightenment) and as such, the ideal philosopher must hone all the necessary arts of rhetoric and poetics to communicate abstract truths to the ordinary people, as well as having achieved enlightenment himself.<ref>Black, p190</ref> Al-Farabi compared the philosopher's role in relation to society with a physician in relation to the body; the body's health is affected by the \"balance of its [[humorism|humours]]\" just as the city is determined by the moral habits of its people. The philosopher's duty, he wrote, was to establish a \"virtuous\" society by healing the souls of the people, establishing justice and guiding them towards \"true happiness\".<ref>Butterworth, p278</ref>\n\nOf course, al-Farabi realized that such a society was rare and required a very specific set of historical circumstances to be realized, which means very few societies could ever attain this goal. He divided those \"vicious\" societies, which have fallen short of the ideal \"virtuous\" society, into three categories: ignorant, wicked and errant. ''Ignorant'' societies have, for whatever reason, failed to comprehend the purpose of human existence, and have supplanted the pursuit of happiness for another (inferior) goal, whether this be wealth, sensual gratification or power. Al-Farabi mentions  \"weeds\" in the virtuous society: those people who try to undermine its progress towards the true human end.<ref>Black, p191</ref> The best known Arabic source for al-Farabi's political philosophy is his work titled, ''al-Madina al-fadila'' (''The Virtuous City'').\n\nWhether or not al-Farabi actually intended to outline a political programme in his writings remains a matter of dispute amongst academics. [[Henry Corbin]], who considers al-Farabi to be a <nowiki>crypto-</nowiki>[[Shi'ite]], says that his ideas should be understood as a \"prophetic philosophy\" instead of being interpreted politically.<ref>Corbin, p162-163</ref> On the other hand, [[Charles Butterworth (philosopher)|Charles Butterworth]] contends that nowhere in his work does al-Farabi speak of a prophet-legislator or revelation (even the word philosophy is scarcely mentioned), and the main discussion that takes place concerns the positions of \"king\" and \"statesmen\".<ref>Butterworth, C. ''Ethical and Political Philosophy'' in Adamson, P and Taylor, R. (2005). ''The Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p276</ref> Occupying a middle position is David Reisman, who like Corbin believes that al-Farabi did not want to expound a political doctrine (although he does not go so far to attribute it to Islamic Gnosticism either). He argues that al-Farabi was using different types of society as examples, in the context of an ethical discussion, to show what effect correct or incorrect thinking could have.<ref>Reisman, p68</ref>  Lastly, [[Joshua Parens]] argues that al-Farabi was slyly asserting that a [[pan-Islamic]] society could not be made, by using reason to show how many conditions (such as moral and deliberative virtue) would have to be met, thus leading the reader to conclude that humans are not fit for such a society.<ref>Joshua Parens, An Islamic Philosophy of Virtuous Religions: Introducing Alfarabi (New York: State University of New York Press, 2006), 2.</ref> Some other authors like [[Mykhaylo Yakubovych]] argue that for al-Farabi religion (''milla'') and philosophy (''falsafa'') constituted the same praxeological value (i.e. basis for ''amal al-fadhil''\u2014\"virtuous deed\"), while its epistemological level (''ilm''\u2014\"knowledge\") was different.<ref>Mykhaylo Yakubovych.

The attraction can be to the [[physical attraction|physical]] or other qualities or traits of a person, or to such qualities in the context where they appear. The attraction may be to a person's [[aesthetics]] or movements or to their voice or smell, besides other factors. The attraction may be enhanced by a person's adornments, clothing, perfume or [[hair style|style]]. It can be influenced by [[individual]] [[Genetics|genetic]], [[psychological]], or cultural factors, or to other, more amorphous qualities. Sexual attraction is also a response to another person that depends on a combination of the person possessing the traits and on the criteria of the person who is attracted.\n\nThough attempts have been made to devise objective criteria of sexual attractiveness and measure it as [[individual capital|one of several bodily forms]] of [[capital asset]] (''see [[erotic capital]]''), a person's sexual attractiveness is to a large extent a subjective measure dependent on another person's interest, perception, and [[sexual orientation]]. For example, a [[Homosexuality|gay or lesbian person]] would typically find a person of the [[Same-sex attraction|same sex]] to be more attractive than one of the other sex. A [[bisexuality|bisexual person]] would find either sex to be attractive. [[Asexuality]] refers to those who do not experience sexual attraction for either sex, though they may have romantic attraction (homoromantic, biromantic or heteroromantic) or a non-directed libido.<ref name=asexualityarchive>{{cite web|title=Things That Are Not Asexuality|url=http://www.asexualityarchive.com/things-that-are-not-asexuality/|website=Asexuality Archive|date=2012-05-27}}</ref> [[Interpersonal attraction]] includes factors such as [[propinquity|physical or psychological similarity]], [[Intimate relationship#Intimacy|familiarity]] or possessing a preponderance of [[Koinophilia#Physical attractiveness|common or familiar features]], [[similarity (psychology)|similarity]], [[Interpersonal compatibility|complementarity]], [[reciprocal liking]], and [[reinforcement]].<ref>Miller, R., Perlman, D., and Brehm, S.S.

Hormone levels throughout the menstrual cycle affect a woman's overt behaviours, influencing the way a woman presents herself to others during stages of her menstrual cycle, in attempt to attract high quality mates the closer the woman is to [[ovulation]].<ref name=\"Pillsworth\">{{cite journal|last1=Pillsworth|first1=Elizabeth G.|last2=Haselton|first2=Martie G.|last3=Buss|first3=David M.|title=Ovulatory Shifts in Female Sexual Desire|journal=Journal of Sex Research|date=February 2004|volume=41|issue=1|pages=55\u201365|doi=10.1080/00224490409552213|pmid=15216424|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/ovulatoryshifts.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Social and biological factors==\n[[Human sexuality]] has many aspects. In [[biology]], sexuality describes the reproductive mechanism and the basic biological drive that exists in all sexually reproducing species and can encompass [[sexual intercourse]] and sexual contact in all its forms. There are also emotional and physical aspects of sexuality. These relate to the bond between individuals, which may be expressed through profound feelings or emotions. [[Sociology|Sociologically]], it can cover the [[Culture|cultural]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Law|legal]] aspects; [[philosophy|philosophically]], it can span the [[morality|moral]], [[ethics|ethical]], [[theology|theological]], [[spirituality|spiritual]], and [[religion|religious]] aspects.\n\nWhich aspects of a person's sexuality attract another is influenced by [[cultural]] factors; it has varied over time as well as personal factors. Influencing factors may be determined more locally among sub-cultures, across [[sexual field]]s, or simply by the preferences of the [[individual]]. These preferences come about as a result of a complex variety of [[Genetics|genetic]], [[psychological]], and cultural factors.\n\nA person's [[physical appearance]] has a critical impact on their sexual attractiveness. This involves the impact one's appearance has on the [[sense]]s, especially in the beginning of a relationship:\n\n* [[Visual perception]] (the symmetry of [[Facial symmetry|the face]], [[physical attractiveness]], [[Human skin|health]], and how they act or move, for example, while dancing);\n* [[Hearing (sense)|Audition]] (how the other's [[human voice|voice]] and movements [[sound]]);\n* [[Olfaction]] (how the other smells, naturally or artificially; the wrong smell may be repellent).\n\nAs with other animals, [[pheromone]]s may have an impact, though less significantly in the case of humans. Theoretically, the \"wrong\" pheromone may cause someone to be disliked, even when they would otherwise appear attractive. Frequently, a pleasant-smelling [[perfume]] is used to encourage the member of the opposite sex to more deeply inhale the [[air]] surrounding its wearer,{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} increasing the [[probability]] that the individual's pheromones will be inhaled.

Conclusively, it was shown that the male participants who were asked by the female interviewer to perform the [[thematic apperception test]] (TAT) on the fear-arousing bridge, wrote more sexual content in the stories and attempted, with greater effort, to contact the interviewer after the experiment than those participants who performed the TAT on the normal bridge. In another test, a male participant, chosen from a group of 80, was given anticipated shocks. With him was an attractive female confederate, who was also being shocked. The experiment showed that the male's sexual imagery in the TAT was much higher when self shock was anticipated and not when the female confederate shock was anticipated.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dutton|first=Donald G|author2=Arthur P.

It may be to attract someone with whom they can form a deeper relationship, for [[companionship]], [[procreation]], or an [[intimate relationship]], besides other possible purposes. It can be part of a [[courtship]] process. This can involve physical aspects or interactive processes whereby people find and attract potential partners, and maintain a relationship. These processes, which involve attracting a partner and maintaining sexual interest, can include [[flirting]], which can be used to attract the sexual attention of another to encourage romance or sexual relations, and can involve [[body language]], conversation, joking, or brief physical contact.<ref>[http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html SIRC Guide to Flirting.

For example, it has been suggested that women's sexual preferences shift toward more masculine physical characteristics during peak phases of fertility. In such, a [[Facial symmetry|symmetrical]] and masculine face outwardly indicates the reproductive value of a prospective mate.<ref name=\"Gangestad1998\">{{cite journal|last1=Gangestad|first1=S.

It is therefore suggested that females are attracted to masculine faces only during [[ovulation]] as masculinity reflects a high level of fitness, used to ensure reproductive success. Whilst such preferences may be of lesser importance today, the evolutionary explanation offers reasoning as to why such effects are recorded.\n\nAs well as masculinity, females are more sensitive to the scent of males who display high levels of developmental stability.<ref name=\"Gangestad1998\"/> An individual's developmental stability is a measurement of fluctuating asymmetry, defined as their level of deviation from perfect bilateral symmetry. In a comparison of female college students, the results indicated that those normally cycling were more receptive to the scent of shirts worn by [[Facial symmetry|symmetrica]]<nowiki/>l men when nearing peak fertility in their ovulatory cycle. The same women reported no such preference for the scent of symmetrical men when re-tested during non-fertile stages of the menstrual cycle. Those using the [[Oral contraceptive pill|contraceptive pill]], and therefore not following regular cyclical patterns, reported no such preference.<ref name=\"Gangestad1998\"/>\n\nAs with masculine faces, the ability to determine symmetry via scent was likely designed by [[natural selection]] to increase the probability of reproductive success through mating with a male offering strong [[genetics]]. This is evidenced in research focusing on traits of symmetrical males, who consistently record higher levels of IQ, coordination, social dominance, and consequently, greater reproductive fitness.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Van Dongen|first1=Stefan|last2=Gangestad|first2=Steven W.|title=Human fluctuating asymmetry in relation to health and quality: a meta-analysis|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=November 2011|volume=32|issue=6|pages=380\u2013398|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2011.03.002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pound|first1=N.|last2=Lawson|first2=D.

This effect has been found to be most significant in women who are less feminine (those with low [[Estrone glucuronide|E3G]] levels), in comparison to women with higher E3G levels. It has been suggested that this difference in preference is because feminine women (those with high E3G levels) are more successful at obtaining investment. It is not necessary for these women to change their mating preferences during their cycles. More masculine women may make these changes to enhance their chances of achieving investment.\n\nWomen have been found to report greater sexual attraction to men other than their own partners when near ovulation compared with the luteal phase. Women whose partners have high developmental stability have greater attraction to men other than their partners when fertile.

The attraction can be to the [[physical attraction|physical]] or other qualities or traits of a person, or to such qualities in the context where they appear. The attraction may be to a person's [[aesthetics]] or movements or to their voice or smell, besides other factors. The attraction may be enhanced by a person's adornments, clothing, perfume or [[hair style|style]]. It can be influenced by [[individual]] [[Genetics|genetic]], [[psychological]], or cultural factors, or to other, more amorphous qualities. Sexual attraction is also a response to another person that depends on a combination of the person possessing the traits and on the criteria of the person who is attracted.\n\nThough attempts have been made to devise objective criteria of sexual attractiveness and measure it as [[individual capital|one of several bodily forms]] of [[capital asset]] (''see [[erotic capital]]''), a person's sexual attractiveness is to a large extent a subjective measure dependent on another person's interest, perception, and [[sexual orientation]]. For example, a [[Homosexuality|gay or lesbian person]] would typically find a person of the [[Same-sex attraction|same sex]] to be more attractive than one of the other sex. A [[bisexuality|bisexual person]] would find either sex to be attractive. [[Asexuality]] refers to those who do not experience sexual attraction for either sex, though they may have romantic attraction (homoromantic, biromantic or heteroromantic) or a non-directed libido.<ref name=asexualityarchive>{{cite web|title=Things That Are Not Asexuality|url=http://www.asexualityarchive.com/things-that-are-not-asexuality/|website=Asexuality Archive|date=2012-05-27}}</ref> [[Interpersonal attraction]] includes factors such as [[propinquity|physical or psychological similarity]], [[Intimate relationship#Intimacy|familiarity]] or possessing a preponderance of [[Koinophilia#Physical attractiveness|common or familiar features]], [[similarity (psychology)|similarity]], [[Interpersonal compatibility|complementarity]], [[reciprocal liking]], and [[reinforcement]].<ref>Miller, R., Perlman, D., and Brehm, S.S.

Hormone levels throughout the menstrual cycle affect a woman's overt behaviours, influencing the way a woman presents herself to others during stages of her menstrual cycle, in attempt to attract high quality mates the closer the woman is to [[ovulation]].<ref name=\"Pillsworth\">{{cite journal|last1=Pillsworth|first1=Elizabeth G.|last2=Haselton|first2=Martie G.|last3=Buss|first3=David M.|title=Ovulatory Shifts in Female Sexual Desire|journal=Journal of Sex Research|date=February 2004|volume=41|issue=1|pages=55\u201365|doi=10.1080/00224490409552213|pmid=15216424|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/ovulatoryshifts.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Social and biological factors==\n[[Human sexuality]] has many aspects. In [[biology]], sexuality describes the reproductive mechanism and the basic biological drive that exists in all sexually reproducing species and can encompass [[sexual intercourse]] and sexual contact in all its forms. There are also emotional and physical aspects of sexuality. These relate to the bond between individuals, which may be expressed through profound feelings or emotions. [[Sociology|Sociologically]], it can cover the [[Culture|cultural]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Law|legal]] aspects; [[philosophy|philosophically]], it can span the [[morality|moral]], [[ethics|ethical]], [[theology|theological]], [[spirituality|spiritual]], and [[religion|religious]] aspects.\n\nWhich aspects of a person's sexuality attract another is influenced by [[cultural]] factors; it has varied over time as well as personal factors. Influencing factors may be determined more locally among sub-cultures, across [[sexual field]]s, or simply by the preferences of the [[individual]]. These preferences come about as a result of a complex variety of [[Genetics|genetic]], [[psychological]], and cultural factors.\n\nA person's [[physical appearance]] has a critical impact on their sexual attractiveness. This involves the impact one's appearance has on the [[sense]]s, especially in the beginning of a relationship:\n\n* [[Visual perception]] (the symmetry of [[Facial symmetry|the face]], [[physical attractiveness]], [[Human skin|health]], and how they act or move, for example, while dancing);\n* [[Hearing (sense)|Audition]] (how the other's [[human voice|voice]] and movements [[sound]]);\n* [[Olfaction]] (how the other smells, naturally or artificially; the wrong smell may be repellent).\n\nAs with other animals, [[pheromone]]s may have an impact, though less significantly in the case of humans. Theoretically, the \"wrong\" pheromone may cause someone to be disliked, even when they would otherwise appear attractive. Frequently, a pleasant-smelling [[perfume]] is used to encourage the member of the opposite sex to more deeply inhale the [[air]] surrounding its wearer,{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} increasing the [[probability]] that the individual's pheromones will be inhaled.

Conclusively, it was shown that the male participants who were asked by the female interviewer to perform the [[thematic apperception test]] (TAT) on the fear-arousing bridge, wrote more sexual content in the stories and attempted, with greater effort, to contact the interviewer after the experiment than those participants who performed the TAT on the normal bridge. In another test, a male participant, chosen from a group of 80, was given anticipated shocks. With him was an attractive female confederate, who was also being shocked.

In such, a symmetrical and masculine face outwardly indicates the reproductive value of a prospective mate.<ref name=\"Gangestad1998\">{{cite journal|last1=Gangestad|first1=S.

It is therefore suggested that females are attracted to masculine faces only during [[ovulation]] as masculinity reflects a high level of fitness, used to ensure reproductive success. Whilst such preferences may be of lesser importance today, the evolutionary explanation offers reasoning as to why such effects are recorded.\n\nAs well as masculinity, females are more sensitive to the scent of males who display high levels of developmental stability.<ref name=\"Gangestad1998\"/> An individual's developmental stability is a measurement of fluctuating asymmetry, defined as their level of deviation from perfect bilateral symmetry. In a comparison of female college students, the results indicated that those normally cycling were more receptive to the scent of shirts worn by symmetrical men when nearing peak fertility in their ovulatory cycle. The same women reported no such preference for the scent of symmetrical men when re-tested during non-fertile stages of the menstrual cycle. Those using the [[Oral contraceptive pill|contraceptive pill]], and therefore not following regular cyclical patterns, reported no such preference.<ref name=\"Gangestad1998\"/>\n\nAs with masculine faces, the ability to determine symmetry via scent was likely designed by [[natural selection]] to increase the probability of reproductive success through mating with a male offering strong [[genetics]]. This is evidenced in research focusing on traits of symmetrical males, who consistently record higher levels of IQ, coordination, social dominance, and consequently, greater reproductive fitness.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Van Dongen|first1=Stefan|last2=Gangestad|first2=Steven W.|title=Human fluctuating asymmetry in relation to health and quality: a meta-analysis|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=November 2011|volume=32|issue=6|pages=380\u2013398|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2011.03.002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pound|first1=N.|last2=Lawson|first2=D.

In such, during ovulation, females show a strong preference for symmetrical males as they are reaching peak fertility. As it would be advantageous for asymmetrical men to release a scent similar to that produced by symmetrical males, the female signal used to detect symmetry is presumed to be an honest one (asymmetrical males cannot fake it).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zahavi|first1=Amotz|title=Mate selection \u2013 A selection for a handicap|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=September 1975|volume=53|issue=1|pages=205\u2013214|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3|pmid=1195756|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21959410|citeseerx=10.1.1.586.3819}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to this, females have different behavioural preferences towards men during stages in their cycles. It has been found that women have a preference towards more masculine voices during the late-follicular, fertile phase of the menstrual cycle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feinberg|first=D.

This effect has been found to be most significant in women who are less feminine (those with low [[Estrone glucuronide|E3G]] levels), in comparison to women with higher E3G levels. It has been suggested that this difference in preference is because feminine women (those with high E3G levels) are more successful at obtaining investment. It is not necessary for these women to change their mating preferences during their cycles. More masculine women may make these changes to enhance their chances of achieving investment.\n\nWomen have been found to report greater sexual attraction to men other than their own partners when near ovulation compared with the luteal phase. Women whose partners have high developmental stability have greater attraction to men other than their partners when fertile. This can be interpreted as women possessing an adaptation to be attracted to men possessing markers of genetic fitness, therefore sexual attraction depends on the qualities of her partner.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gangestad |first1=S.

The relevance of domain authority on website-listing in the [[Search engine results page|SERP]]s of search engines led to the birth of a whole industry of [[Spamdexing|Black Hat SEO]] providers, trying to feign an increased level of domain authority.<ref name=www2006SpamDetection>{{cite journal|last1=Ntoulas|first1=Alexandros|last2=Najork|first2=Marc|last3=Manasse|first3=Mark|last4=Fetterly|first4=Dennis|title=Detecting Spam Web Pages through Content Analysis|journal=International World Wide Web Conference|date=May 23\u201326, 2006|volume=WWW 2006|url=http://www.ra.ethz.ch/CDStore/www2006/devel-www2006.ecs.soton.ac.uk/programme/files/pdf/3052.pdf|ref=ACM 1-59593-323-9/06/0005}}</ref>\nThe ranking by major search engines, e.g., Google\u2019s [[PageRank]] is agnostic of specific industry or subject areas and assesses a website in the context of the totality of websites in the Internet.<ref name=PageBrin_PageRank>{{cite journal|last1=Brin|first1=Sergey|last2=Page|first2=Larry|title=The PageRank Citation Ranking: Bringing Order to the Web|journal=Stanford University InfoLab Publication Server|date=January 29, 1998|url=http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/1/1999-66.pdf}}</ref> The results on the SERP page set the PageRank in the context of a specific keyword.

When individuals judge domain authority, decisive factors can include the prestige of a website, the prestige of the contributing authors in a specific domain, the quality and relevance of the information on a website, the novelty of the content, but also the competitive situation around the discussed subject area or the quality of the outgoing links.<ref name=\"OnPage.orgDomainAuthority\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ventureskies.com/blog/what-is-domain-authority-and-how-do-i-build-it|title=What Is Domain Authority and How Do I Build It?|last1=Scholten|first=Ulrich|date=Nov 29, 2015|publisher=VentureSkies}}</ref>\nSeveral search engines (e.g., [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], [[Google]], [[Yahoo]]) have developed automated analyses and rank algorithms for domain authority.

A website is considered a node. Its prestige is defined by the quantity of nodes that have directed edges pointing on the website and the quality of those nodes. The nodes\u2019 quality is also defined through their prestige. This definition assures that a prestigious website is not only pointed at by many other websites but that those pointing websites are prestigious themselves<ref name=WassermanSocialNetworkAnalysis>{{cite book|last1=Wasserman|first1=Stanley|last2=Faust|first2=Katherine|title=Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications (Structural Analysis in the Social Sciences)|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, USA|isbn=0 521 38707 8}}</ref>\nSimilar to the prestige of a website, the contributing authors\u2019 prestige is taken into consideration, in those cases, where the authors are named and identified (e.g., with their [[Twitter]] or [[Google Plus]] profile]. In this case, prestige is measured with the prestige of the authors who quote them or refer to them and the quantity of referrals which these authors receive.<ref name=OnPage.orgDomainAuthority />\nSearch engines use additional factors to scrutinize the websites\u2019 prestige. To do so, Google\u2019s PageRank looks at factors like link-diversification and link-dynamics: When too many links are coming from the same domain or webmaster, there is a risk of [[Spamdexing|Black Hat SEO]]. When backlinks grow rapidly, this nourishes suspicion of [[Spamming|Spam]] or Black Hat SEO as origin. In addition Google looks at factors like the public availability of the [[WhoIs]] information of the domain owner, the use of global [[Top-level domains]], domain age and volatility of ownership to assess their apparent prestige. Lastly search engines look at the traffic and the amount of organic searches for a site as the amount of traffic should be congruent to the level of prestige that a website has in a certain domain.<ref name=OnPage.orgDomainAuthority />\n\n==Information quality==\n[[Information quality]] describes the value which information provides to the reader. Wang and Strong categorize assessable dimensions of information into intrinsic ([[accuracy]], [[wikt:objectivity|objectivity]], [[Credibility|believability]], [[reputation]]), contextual ([[relevancy]], [[value-added]]/authenticity, [[wikt:timeless|timeless]]ness, [[wikt:complete|complete]]ness, quantity), representational ([[interpretability]], format, coherence, compatibility) and accessibile ([[accessibility]] and access security).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Richard Y.|last2=Strong|first2=Diane M.|title=Beyond Accuracy: What Data Quality Means to Data Consumers|journal=Journal of Management Information Systems|date=October 26, 2013|volume=12|issue=4|pages=5\u201333|jstor=40398176}}</ref>\nHumans can base their judgments on quality based on experience in judging content, style and grammatical correctness. Information systems like search engines need indirect means, allowing concluding on the quality of information.

This makes them more visible and the content more relevant, interlinked and useful.<ref name=WassermanSocialNetworkAnalysis /> Centrality from a graph-theoretical perspective describes unidirectional relationships, not making a distinction between receiving and sending information. From this point of view, it includes the inbound links considered in the definition of \u201cprestige\u201d complemented with outgoing links. Another difference between prestige and centrality is that the measure of prestige counts for a complete website or an author, whereas centrality can be considered on a more granular level like one individual blog post.\nSearch engines look at various factors to judge the quality of outgoing links, i.e., on link-centrality, describing the quality and quantity as well as the relevance of outgoing links and the prestige of its destination. They also look at the frequency of new content publication (\u201cfreshness of information\u201d) to be sure that the website is still an active player in the community.<ref name=OnPage.orgDomainAuthority />\n\n==Competitive situation around a subject==\nThe domain authority that a website attains is not the only factor which defines its positioning in the SERPs of search engines. The second important factor is the competitiveness of a specific sector. Subjects like [[SEO]] are very competitive. A website needs to outperform the prestige of competing websites to attain domain authority.
