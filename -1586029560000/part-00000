One of the more plausible is that the name is derived from the name of the stream Homeyuk, which flowed into the [[Sozh river|river Sozh]] near the foot of the hill where the first settlement was founded. Names of other Belarusian cities are formed along these lines: for example, the name [[Minsk]] is derived from the river Menka, [[Polatsk]] from the river [[Palata River|Palata]], and [[Vitsebsk]] from the river Vitsba.\nIn historical sources from 1142{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} to the 16th century, the city is mentioned as Hom', Homye, Homiy, Homey, or Homyi. These forms are tentatively explained as derivatives of an unattested ''*gom\u016d'' of uncertain meaning.<ref>''\u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044c \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u043e\u0432: \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0444\u043e\u043d\u0434,'' \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u041e.\u041d. \u0422\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u0432\u044b\u043f.7 (\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430, 1980), \u0441\u0442\u0440.21.</ref>\nThe modern name for the city has been in use only since the 16th\u201317th centuries.\n\nDuring the Soviet period, another story about the city's name was popular: raftsmen on the river Sozh supposedly warned each other about the danger of running into sandy shallows by shouting \u00abHo! Ho! Mel!\u00bb. A more recent narrative, propagated by some modern researchers, is that the name is derived from an ancient Belarusian greeting: \u00abDats u homel\u00bb, which means \u00abto pat on the shoulder\u00bb.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Gomel under [[Kievan Rus']]===\n[[File:Gomel inner fortress in the 12th century.jpg|thumb|left|190px| Gomel's inner fortress in the 12th century]]\nGomel was founded at the end of the 1st millennium AD on the lands of the [[East Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] tribal union of [[Radimichs]]. It lays on the banks of the [[Sozh river]] and the Homeyuk stream. Sozh's high right bank, cut through by canyons, provided a natural fortification. For some time, Gomel was the capital of the Gomel Principality, before it became part of the [[Principality of Chernigov]]. Gomel is first mentioned in the [[Hypatian Codex]] under the year of 1142 as being territory of the princes of Chernigov. For some time, Gomel was ruled by the prince of Smolensk [[Rostislav Mstislavich]] before it was re-captured by [[Iziaslav III Davidovich]], after whose death it belonged to [[Sviatoslav Olgovich]] and then to Sviatoslav's son Oleg. Under Oleg, Gomel went to the Principality of [[Novhorod-Siverskyi]]. The next ruler was [[Igor Svyatoslavich]] \u2013 the hero of \"[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]\". During this period, the town was a fortified point and the centre of a [[volost]]. In the 12th\u201313th centuries the city's area was not less than 40 ha, and it had developed various crafts and was connected by trading routes with the cities of Northern and Southern Rus'. Archeological data have shown that the city was badly damaged during the Mongol-Tatar assault in the first half of the 13th century.\n\n===Gomel in the Great Duchy of Lithuania and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth===\n[[File:Gomel fortress in the 16th century.gif|thumb|left|230px| Gomel fortress in the 16th century]]\nIn 1335, the Gomel region was joined to the [[Great Duchy of Lithuania]] by [[Algirdas]]. From 1335 to 1406 it was under the ownership of prince Patricia Narymuntovich and his sons, from 1406 to 1419 the city was ruled by the Great Duke's deputies, from 1419 to 1435 it belonged to prince [[Svitrigaila]], from 1446 to 1452 to prince Vasiliy Yaroslavich, from 1452 to 1483 to [[Mozhaysk]] prince Ivan Andreyevich, and from 1483 to 1505 to his son Semyon, who transferred it to the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].\n\nDuring the Second [[Muscovite-Lithuanian War]] of 1500\u20131503 Lithuania tried to regain Gomel and other lands transferred to Moscow, but suffered defeat and lost one-third of its territory. In 1535, Lithuanian and Polish forces under [[Jerzy Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], [[Jan Tarnowski]] and Andrzej Niemirowicz re-captured the city after the surrender of Moscow's deputy, D. Shchepin-Obolensky. In the same year, the Great Duke of Lithuania [[Sigismund K\u0119stutaitis]] founded the Gomel [[Starostwo]]. According to the peace agreement of 1537, Gomel together with its [[volost]] remained a Lithuanian possession. In 1535\u20131565 Gomel is the centre of [[starostwo]], and from 1565 onwards Gomel is in the [[Rechytsa]] [[Powiat]] of the [[Minsk Voivodeship]].\n\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Gomel, 1560.gif|thumb|right|100px| Coat of Arms of Gomel, 1560]]\nIn 1560, the city's first [[coat of arms]] was introduced. In 1569, Gomel became part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. From this moment on, the city became the arena of numerous attacks and battles between [[Cossaks]], Russia and the [[Polish-Lithuania Commonwealth]]. In 1572, Gomel [[Starostwo]] was given to B. Sapega. At the beginning of the 1570s, Gomel was captured by the forces of [[Ivan the Terrible]], but in 1576 it was re-captured by J. Radziwi\u0142\u0142. In 1581, Gomel was again attacked by Russian troops, and in 1595\u20131596 it was in the hands of [[Severyn Nalyvaiko]]'s [[Cossaks]].\n\nAfter the beginning of the struggle against [[Orthodox Christianity]] in Lithuania, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Nikolayevskiy Cathedral was closed on the order of [[Greek Catholic]] [[Eparch]] [[Josaphat Kuntsevych]] in 1621. In 1633 the city was besieged by the [[Cossaks]] of Bulgakov and Yermolin, in 1648 captured by the Golovatskiy's Cossack detachment, and in 1649 by Martyn Nebaba's detachment. After that, Gomel got through several sieges in 1651 but in 1654 was captured by Ivan Zolotarenko's detachment. He and his sons held the city until 1667 and then began to serve under [[Alexis of Russia]], however, after the [[Truce of Andrusovo]] Gomel at last returned to the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], where it first belonged to [[Miko\u0142aj Krzysztof \"the Orphan\" Radziwi\u0142\u0142|M. K. Radziwi\u0142\u0142]] and then \u2013 till the [[annexation]] by the [[Russian Empire]] \u2013 to the [[Czartoryski family]]. During the [[Great Northern War]] Russian forces under [[Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov]] stood in Gomel. In 1670, Gomel got the [[Magdeburg rights]]. Towards the middle of the 17th century, the city fell into crisis mainly due to the struggles mentioned above. It suffered significant damage, the population decreased severely, and many crafts disappeared.\n\n=== Gomel in the Russian Empire ===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Rumjanzew-sadunaiski.jpg|[[Pyotr Alexandrovich Rumyantsev-Zadunaisky]] (1725\u20131796)\nFile:Rumyan.jpg|[[Nikolay Petrovich Rumyantsev]] (1754\u20131826)\nFile:S.

In 1775, [[Catherine the Great|Empress Catherine II]] gave Gomel and Gomel eldership in the eternal hereditary possession of Russian military commander [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]].\n\nThe Peter and Paul Cathedral, designed by architect John Clark, was built in 1809\u20131819. [[Nikolay Rumyantsev]] opened the first high school, hotel courtyard, glass, tile, distilleries, weaving and spinning factories, and he built a church, a synagogue, a pharmacy, a hospice and a permanent wooden bridge across the [[Sozh river]].\n\nAfter the death of Nikolay Rumyantsev, the city came in possession of his brother Sergei Petrovich Rumyantsev. However, due to lack of money, Sergei indebted Gomel with the state treasury of the [[Russian Empire]]. Subsequently, after not being able to pay off the debt, the treasury sold the city. [[Gomel Palace]] was acquired by Prince [[Ivan Paskevich]], and the rest of the city by [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] (1838). Paskevich had an English garden made around the palace, which is still in place today. In 1856, the estate passed on to his son Fyodor Ivanovich Paskevich.\n\nBy 1913, Gomel was a major industrial city and counted 104,500 inhabitants.\n\n=== Ukrainian period ===\nPreceding the [[treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], on 1 March 1918 the city was liberated from Bolshevik troops (the Executive Committee of the Gomel Council of Workers' Deputies had left already on 21 February) by German forces.<ref name=\"153431/ Contraband\"/> In March 1918 the city became part of [[Chernihiv Governorate]] of the [[Ukrainian State]].<ref name=\"153431/ Contraband\">{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2018/12/19/153431/ Contraband, strikes, Bolsheviks ...

Insurgents took control of strategic objects and executed members of the Soviet leadership of the city. The rebels were defeated.\n\nIn 1919, Gomel became the centre of the [[Gomel Governorate]] in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]]. After the end of the hostilities, restoration of industry and transport began. In the 1920s, a number of large businesses had been created: shipyards, a factory named \"Polespechat\", a shoe factory named \"Trud\", a bakery, and the first phase of a municipal power plant. In 1926 the city was passed to the [[Belarusian SSR]].\n\nBy 1940, 264 industrial enterprises had been established\n\n===World War II===\nDuring [[World War II]], Gomel was under [[German occupation of Byelorussia during World War II|Nazi occupation]] from [[Operation Barbarossa|August 19, 1941]] until [[Battle of the Dnieper|November 26, 1943]]. The city was taken by [[Konstantin Rokossovsky|Rokossovsky]]'s [[1st Belorussian Front|Belorussian Front]] during the Gomel-Rechitsa Offensive. Eighty percent of the city was destroyed. The population of Gomel had dropped dramatically. According to the data of the registry, the population of Gomel numbered less than 15,000 inhabitants, compared to 144,000 inhabitants in 1940.\n\n=== The post-war period ===\nAfter the war, restoration of Gomel began promptly. The majority of pre-revolutionary buildings were lost. City streets were considerably expanded, and buildings in [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist Empire style]] were erected. In 1950, almost all of the pre-war enterprises resumed their work.\n\n===Chernobyl disaster===\nAs a result of the catastrophe at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant|Chernobyl nuclear power plant]] on 26 April 1986, Gomel suffered [[radioactive contamination]]. This significantly worsened both the ecological situation and the socio-economic crisis that had struck the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in the late 1980s. It caused a sharp decline in living standards and a gradual depopulation that lasted until the early 21st century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, a scientific centre and practice for radiation medicine and human ecology was built in Gomel to overcome and study the consequences of the catastrophe at Chernobyl.<ref name=\"rcrm\">{{cite web |title=The Republican Research Centre for Radiation Medicine and Human Ecology |url=http://rcrm.by/english/center_eng.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201114602/http://rcrm.by/english/center_eng.html|archive-date=1 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe development of radiological dose values varies between individual villages in severely contaminated regions, depending on the surroundings and the economic orientation.

From that moment on, a gradual decrease of the number of Jews in the city began. 40,880 Jews lived in Gomel in 1939, when they comprised 29.4 percent of the total population.

On the right bank of the river, it is a gradually decreasing plain water-glacial and [[fluvial terrace]] of the [[Sozh River|Sozh river]]. The left bank is a low-lying alluvial plain. The highest elevation of 144 meters above sea level is found at the northern outskirts of Gomel, the lowest elevation of 115 m at the water boundary Sozh river. Novobelitskiy district, which is located on the left bank of the river (i.e., towards the south), has elevations averaging of 10\u201315 meters lower than the northern and central parts of the city.\n\nOn the left bank of the Sozh many kilometers of beaches can be found.\n\n===Climate===\nGomel has a warm-summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'').

The city is an important railroad hub in the southeastern part of Belarus, as it is situated midway on the [[Minsk]]-[[Kiev]] rail link. The strategic location of Gomel near the border with Russia and Ukraine provides a direct connection to the vast railroad networks of those countries.\n\nA trolleybus network opened on 20 May 1962 and consists of 23 routes (not counting variations). On 15 December 2010, after constructing an overhead wire network in the streets of Egorenko, Sviridov and Chechersk, a new trolley line opened to the terminus \"Neighborhood Klinkowski\" that resulted in a change of trolleybus routes 9, 16, 17.

Rolling stock consist of types [[ACSM-201]], [[ACSM-321]], MAZ-203T, ACSM-213.\nThere are more than 60 bus routes totaling 670 kilometers, and a number of express routes. Rolling stock consists mainly of buses MAZ-105, MAZ-107, MAZ-103, and to a lesser extent MAZ-203, MAZ-206, and since 2014, the extra-large-capacity, low-[[MAZ-215]].

These facilities, including eight stadiums and the Ice Palace, which has two ice arenas, support common activities such as hockey, track and field, and football. The [[Central Stadium (Gomel)|Central Stadium]] is the home of Gomel's local football club, [[FC Gomel]].

Gomel State Medical University provides classes in both English and Russian. Many prominent scientists work here as senior lecturers.\n\n==Culture==\nThroughout the eight hundred-year history of Gomel, only a few sights have been preserved. A small part of them belongs to the 1700s and 1800s, the main part belongs to the 20th - 21st centuries. Most of the architectural monuments of the 20th century date back to the 1950s. Most of them are concentrated in the central part of the city.\n\nThe Ferris Wheel and the Ferris Tower, located in a park a few hundred meters from the palace complex, are popular for exploring the city.

Names of other Belarusian cities are formed along these lines: for example, the name [[Minsk]] is derived from the river Menka, [[Polatsk]] from the river [[Palata River|Palata]], and [[Vitsebsk]] from the river Vitsba.\nIn historical sources from 1142{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} to the 16th century, the city is mentioned as Hom', Homye, Homiy, Homey, or Homyi. These forms are tentatively explained as derivatives of an unattested ''*gom\u016d'' of uncertain meaning.<ref>''\u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044c \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u043e\u0432: \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0444\u043e\u043d\u0434,'' \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u041e.\u041d. \u0422\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u0432\u044b\u043f.7 (\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430, 1980), \u0441\u0442\u0440.21.</ref>\nThe modern name for the city has been in use only since the 16th\u201317th centuries.\n\nDuring the Soviet period, another story about the city's name was popular: raftsmen on the river Sozh supposedly warned each other about the danger of running into sandy shallows by shouting \u00abHo! Ho! Mel!\u00bb. A more recent narrative, propagated by some modern researchers, is that the name is derived from an ancient Belarusian greeting: \u00abDats u homel\u00bb, which means \u00abto pat on the shoulder\u00bb.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Gomel under [[Kievan Rus']]===\n[[File:Gomel inner fortress in the 12th century.jpg|thumb|left|190px| Gomel's inner fortress in the 12th century]]\nGomel was founded at the end of the 1st millennium AD on the lands of the [[East Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] tribal union of [[Radimichs]]. It lays on the banks of the [[Sozh river]] and the Homeyuk stream. Sozh's high right bank, cut through by canyons, provided a natural fortification. For some time, Gomel was the capital of the Gomel Principality, before it became part of the [[Principality of Chernigov]]. Gomel is first mentioned in the [[Hypatian Codex]] under the year of 1142 as being territory of the princes of Chernigov. For some time, Gomel was ruled by the prince of Smolensk [[Rostislav Mstislavich]] before it was re-captured by [[Iziaslav III Davidovich]], after whose death it belonged to [[Sviatoslav Olgovich]] and then to Sviatoslav's son Oleg. Under Oleg, Gomel went to the Principality of [[Novhorod-Siverskyi]]. The next ruler was [[Igor Svyatoslavich]] \u2013 the hero of \"[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]\". During this period, the town was a fortified point and the centre of a [[volost]]. In the 12th\u201313th centuries the city's area was not less than 40 ha, and it had developed various crafts and was connected by trading routes with the cities of Northern and Southern Rus'. Archeological data have shown that the city was badly damaged during the Mongol-Tatar assault in the first half of the 13th century.\n\n===Gomel in the Great Duchy of Lithuania and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth===\n[[File:Gomel fortress in the 16th century.gif|thumb|left|230px| Gomel fortress in the 16th century]]\nIn 1335, the Gomel region was joined to the [[Great Duchy of Lithuania]] by [[Algirdas]]. From 1335 to 1406 it was under the ownership of prince Patricia Narymuntovich and his sons, from 1406 to 1419 the city was ruled by the Great Duke's deputies, from 1419 to 1435 it belonged to prince [[Svitrigaila]], from 1446 to 1452 to prince Vasiliy Yaroslavich, from 1452 to 1483 to [[Mozhaysk]] prince Ivan Andreyevich, and from 1483 to 1505 to his son Semyon, who transferred it to the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].\n\nDuring the Second [[Muscovite-Lithuanian War]] of 1500\u20131503 Lithuania tried to regain Gomel and other lands transferred to Moscow, but suffered defeat and lost one-third of its territory. In 1535, Lithuanian and Polish forces under [[Jerzy Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], [[Jan Tarnowski]] and Andrzej Niemirowicz re-captured the city after the surrender of Moscow's deputy, D. Shchepin-Obolensky. In the same year, the Great Duke of Lithuania [[Sigismund K\u0119stutaitis]] founded the Gomel [[Starostwo]]. According to the peace agreement of 1537, Gomel together with its [[volost]] remained a Lithuanian possession. In 1535\u20131565 Gomel is the centre of [[starostwo]], and from 1565 onwards Gomel is in the [[Rechytsa]] [[Powiat]] of the [[Minsk Voivodeship]].\n\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Gomel, 1560.gif|thumb|right|100px| Coat of Arms of Gomel, 1560]]\nIn 1560, the city's first [[coat of arms]] was introduced. In 1569, Gomel became part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. From this moment on, the city became the arena of numerous attacks and battles between [[Cossaks]], Russia and the [[Polish-Lithuania Commonwealth]]. In 1572, Gomel [[Starostwo]] was given to B. Sapega. At the beginning of the 1570s, Gomel was captured by the forces of [[Ivan the Terrible]], but in 1576 it was re-captured by J. Radziwi\u0142\u0142. In 1581, Gomel was again attacked by Russian troops, and in 1595\u20131596 it was in the hands of [[Severyn Nalyvaiko]]'s [[Cossaks]].\n\nAfter the beginning of the struggle against [[Orthodox Christianity]] in Lithuania, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Nikolayevskiy Cathedral was closed on the order of [[Greek Catholic]] [[Eparch]] [[Josaphat Kuntsevych]] in 1621. In 1633 the city was besieged by the [[Cossaks]] of Bulgakov and Yermolin, in 1648 captured by the Golovatskiy's Cossack detachment, and in 1649 by Martyn Nebaba's detachment. After that, Gomel got through several sieges in 1651 but in 1654 was captured by Ivan Zolotarenko's detachment. He and his sons held the city until 1667 and then began to serve under [[Alexis of Russia]], however, after the [[Truce of Andrusovo]] Gomel at last returned to the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], where it first belonged to [[Miko\u0142aj Krzysztof \"the Orphan\" Radziwi\u0142\u0142|M. K. Radziwi\u0142\u0142]] and then \u2013 till the [[annexation]] by the [[Russian Empire]] \u2013 to the [[Czartoryski family]]. During the [[Great Northern War]] Russian forces under [[Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov]] stood in Gomel. In 1670, Gomel got the [[Magdeburg rights]]. Towards the middle of the 17th century, the city fell into crisis mainly due to the struggles mentioned above. It suffered significant damage, the population decreased severely, and many crafts disappeared.\n\n=== Gomel in the Russian Empire ===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Rumjanzew-sadunaiski.jpg|[[Pyotr Alexandrovich Rumyantsev-Zadunaisky]] (1725\u20131796)\nFile:Rumyan.jpg|[[Nikolay Petrovich Rumyantsev]] (1754\u20131826)\nFile:S.

In 1775, [[Catherine the Great|Empress Catherine II]] gave Gomel and Gomel eldership in the eternal hereditary possession of Russian military commander [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]].\n\nThe Peter and Paul Cathedral, designed by architect John Clark, was built in 1809\u20131819. [[Nikolay Rumyantsev]] opened the first high school, hotel courtyard, glass, tile, distilleries, weaving and spinning factories, and he built a church, a synagogue, a pharmacy, a hospice and a permanent wooden bridge across the [[Sozh river]].\n\nAfter the death of Nikolay Rumyantsev, the city came in possession of his brother Sergei Petrovich Rumyantsev. However, due to lack of money, Sergei indebted Gomel with the state treasury of the [[Russian Empire]]. Subsequently, after not being able to pay off the debt, the treasury sold the city. [[Gomel Palace]] was acquired by Prince [[Ivan Paskevich]], and the rest of the city by [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] (1838). Paskevich had an English garden made around the palace, which is still in place today. In 1856, the estate passed on to his son Fyodor Ivanovich Paskevich.\n\nBy 1913, Gomel was a major industrial city and counted 104,500 inhabitants.\n\n=== Ukrainian period ===\nPreceding the [[treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], on 1 March 1918 the city was liberated from Bolshevik troops (the Executive Committee of the Gomel Council of Workers' Deputies had left already on 21 February) by German forces.<ref name=\"153431/ Contraband\"/> In March 1918 the city became part of [[Chernihiv Governorate]] of the [[Ukrainian State]].<ref name=\"153431/ Contraband\">{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2018/12/19/153431/ Contraband, strikes, Bolsheviks ...

Insurgents took control of strategic objects and executed members of the Soviet leadership of the city. The rebels were defeated.\n\nIn 1919, Gomel became the centre of the [[Gomel Governorate]] in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]]. After the end of the hostilities, restoration of industry and transport began. In the 1920s, a number of large businesses had been created: shipyards, a factory named \"Polespechat\", a shoe factory named \"Trud\", a bakery, and the first phase of a municipal power plant. In 1926 the city was passed to the [[Belarusian SSR]].\n\nBy 1940, 264 industrial enterprises had been established\n\n===World War II===\nDuring [[World War II]], Gomel was under [[German occupation of Byelorussia during World War II|Nazi occupation]] from [[Operation Barbarossa|August 19, 1941]] until [[Battle of the Dnieper|November 26, 1943]]. The city was taken by [[Konstantin Rokossovsky|Rokossovsky]]'s [[1st Belorussian Front|Belorussian Front]] during the Gomel-Rechitsa Offensive. Eighty percent of the city was destroyed. The population of Gomel had dropped dramatically. According to the data of the registry, the population of Gomel numbered less than 15,000 inhabitants, compared to 144,000 inhabitants in 1940.\n\n=== The post-war period ===\nAfter the war, restoration of Gomel began promptly. The majority of pre-revolutionary buildings were lost. City streets were considerably expanded, and buildings in [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist Empire style]] were erected. In 1950, almost all of the pre-war enterprises resumed their work.\n\n===Chernobyl disaster===\nAs a result of the catastrophe at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant|Chernobyl nuclear power plant]] on 26 April 1986, Gomel suffered [[radioactive contamination]]. This significantly worsened both the ecological situation and the socio-economic crisis that had struck the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in the late 1980s. It caused a sharp decline in living standards and a gradual depopulation that lasted until the early 21st century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, a scientific centre and practice for radiation medicine and human ecology was built in Gomel to overcome and study the consequences of the catastrophe at Chernobyl.<ref name=\"rcrm\">{{cite web |title=The Republican Research Centre for Radiation Medicine and Human Ecology |url=http://rcrm.by/english/center_eng.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201114602/http://rcrm.by/english/center_eng.html|archive-date=1 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe development of radiological dose values varies between individual villages in severely contaminated regions, depending on the surroundings and the economic orientation.

According to the 1897 census, 55% of the population of Gomel were [[Jews]]. In 1903, there was a violent [[pogrom]] against the Jewish population of the city. From that moment on, a gradual decrease of the number of Jews in the city began. 40,880 Jews lived in Gomel in 1939, when they comprised 29.4 percent of the total population. Most Jews had left the city in anticipation of German occupation, but still between 3,000-4,000 Gomel Jews fell victim to the [[Holocaust]].<ref name=\"YV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/untoldstories/database/index.asp?cid=323 |publisher=Yad Vashem |title=The murder sites of the Jews in the occupied territories of the former USSR: Gomel |date=2017 |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref> The end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s saw [[History of the Jews in Belarus#Late 20th century to modern days|mass emigration]] of Jews from Gomel, but at the same time restoration of Jewish institutions in the city by the remaining Jewish inhabitants.<ref name=\"JW\">{{cite web|url=http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/homyel/gomel_history.html |publisher=Paul Zoglin |title=Gomel history |date=2009-12-16 |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nGomel is situated in the southeastern part of the country, on the right bank of the [[Sozh river|river Sozh]], {{convert|302|km|0|abbr=on}} south-east of [[Minsk]], {{convert|534|km|0|abbr=on}} east of [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]], {{convert|171|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Mogilev]], {{convert|237|km|0|abbr=on}} west of [[Bryansk]] and {{convert|111|km|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Chernihiv]].\n\nThe terrain on which the city as a whole is built, is flat. On the right bank of the river, it is a gradually decreasing plain water-glacial and [[fluvial terrace]] of the [[Sozh River|Sozh river]]. The left bank is a low-lying alluvial plain. The highest elevation of 144 meters above sea level is found at the northern outskirts of Gomel, the lowest elevation of 115 m at the water boundary Sozh river. Novobelitskiy district, which is located on the left bank of the river (i.e., towards the south), has elevations averaging of 10\u201315 meters lower than the northern and central parts of the city.\n\nOn the left bank of the Sozh many kilometers of beaches can be found.\n\n===Climate===\nGomel has a warm-summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb''). Warm summers and cold winters are caused by frequent arrival of warm sea air masses from the Atlantic and the dominating western transfer.\n\n[[Binghamton]] and [[Oshawa]] feature similar climate conditions.\n{{Weather box\n|width = auto\n|location = Gomel\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan record high C = 9.6\n| Feb record high C = 15.8\n| Mar record high C = 21.5\n| Apr record

These facilities, including eight stadiums and the Ice Palace, which has two ice arenas, support common activities such as hockey, track and field, and football. The [[Central Stadium (Gomel)|Central Stadium]] is the home of Gomel\u2019s local football club, [[FC Gomel]].

Gomel State Medical University provides classes in both English and Russian. Many prominent scientists work here as senior lecturers.\n\n==Culture==\nThroughout the eight hundred year history of Gomel, only a few sights have been preserved.

In 2018 they swept [[Visalia Rawhide]] to win their third league championship\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nThe Quakes franchise has been in existence since 1966 when it played in [[Lodi, California]]. A team of investors from the city had pooled together $2,500 to start the franchise a few years earlier, and their first name was the Lodi Crushers. Until 1984, the team played at [[Tony Zupo Field|Lawrence Park]] (now [[Tony Zupo Field]]) for home games. Several times in its early history, the team was sold from one group of collaborating town residents to another. The franchise since in 1966 has been affiliated with several major league teams, notably the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the late 1970s and the [[Chicago Cubs]] in the early 1980s. While in Lodi the team won several [[California League|California League Championships]], including 1973, 1977 and 1981.<ref name=\"team history\"/>\n\nAfter 1984, the Chicago Cubs pulled out of Lodi, and the franchise's owner Michelle Sprague couldn't find a major league affiliate. She deactivated the team for a year, selling to a group including former L.A. Dodger, [[Ken McMullen (baseball)|Ken McMullen]]. After spending time in [[Ventura, California|Ventura]] under new ownerships (a group of investors including Roy Englebrecht, actor [[Mark Harmon]], and former Quakes' majority owner [[Hank Stickney]]), the team moved to [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] and in 1987 and became the [[San Bernardino Spirit]]. [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] was among the players that came through [[Fiscalini Field]] on their way to the big leagues.<ref name=\"team history\"/>\n\n===Move to Rancho Cucamonga===\n[[File:RanchoCucamongaEpicenter.JPG|left|thumb|200px|The team plays their games at [[LoanMart Field]], and has since 1992]]\nIn the early 1990s, Stickney was informed by the city of [[Rancho Cucamonga]] that they would be breaking ground on a new stadium. Selling the rights to the name the San Bernardino Spirit to a different franchise, the main staff of Stickney's team moved outside the construction zone where the ballpark would be built. Construction started on November 14, 1991. Named \"The Quake\" after a vote, the stadium was nicknamed the \"Epicenter\". The team moved into the stadium on April 1, 1993. The Rancho Cucamonga Quakes played their first game at the stadium on April 8 against the [[High Desert Mavericks]], winning 7\u20133. The Quakes won their first California League championship in 1994, defeating the Modesto A's in four games.<ref name=\"team history\"/>\n\nThe Quakes continue to play their home games at the stadium, now renamed [[LoanMart Field]]. While the stadium held up to 7000 fans in its first few years of existence, recent renovations in 2014 and 2015 now sees the ballpark hold just over 4900 total fans.  During the late 1990s and 2000s, the Quakes broke several league attendance records.<ref name=\"team history\"/>\n\nAfter being an affiliate of the San Diego Padres for the first eight years in Rancho Cucamonga, the team swapped affiliations with the [[Lake Elsinore Storm]], beginning the 2001 season. For the next ten seasons, the Quakes were affiliated with the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]]. In 2010, its final year of affiliation with the Angels, the team advanced to the California League championship round, losing in extra innings in the fifth and deciding game to the [[San Jose Giants]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100921&content_id=14909628&vkey=news_t526&fext=.jsp&sid=t526 | title=Giants Win in 10 Innings, Take 2010 Title | publisher= Rancho Cucamonga Quakes Homepage | date=September 21, 2010 | accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref> After the season, the Quakes once again changed affiliations, joining the Dodgers' system.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100928&content_id=15175938&vkey=news_t526&fext=.jsp&sid=t526 | title=Quakes and Dodgers Agree to Partnership | publisher= Rancho Cucamonga Quakes Homepage | date=September 28, 2010 | accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Rancho_Cucamonga_Quakes_in_their_dugout.jpg|thumb|left|The 2018 Quakes in their dugout at LoneMart Field]]\nTelevision actor [[Mark Harmon]] (''[[St. Elsewhere]]'', ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'') was one of the team's owners until he sold his interest in the team to local businessman Scott Ostlund.

This work seeks a better understanding of the [[psychology|psychological]] and [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] basis of decision-making in order to determine the validity of models of human economic behavior. His research uses mostly economics experiments\u2014and occasionally field studies\u2014to understand how people behave when making decisions (e.g., risky gambles for money), in games, and in markets (e.g., speculative price bubbles).\n\nHe spoke at the Econometric Society World Congress in London on August 20, 2005 and at the Nobel Centennial Symposium in 2001 on Behavioral and Experimental Economics.\n\nHe is the author of \"Behavioral Game Theory\" published by [[Princeton University Press]] in 2003.\n\nDuring the late 90's and until mid-2008, Camerer began instructing college courses in fields such as Cognitive Psychology, Microeconomic Theory, Behavioral Economics, and Organizational Design. These courses were held at a variety of different universities, including the aforementioned California Institute of Technology and additionally [[New York University]]. <ref name=\"Colin Camerer\"/>\n\nIn September 2013, Camerer was named a [[MacArthur fellow]].<ref name=nyt/>\n\n==Fever Records==\nIn 1983, Camerer started a [[record label]] called \"Fever Records\" as \"an economics experiment\".

To compound the confusion, a post office (called Golovin) was established at the mission in 1899, but closed in 1906.

Lt. [[Lavrenty Zagoskin]], from the Imperial Russian Navy sent to Alaska to scout locations for trading posts, reported the village as \"Ikalikguigmyut\" in 1842. In 1867, the Mission Covenant of Sweden established a church and school south of the current site of Golovin. Around 1890, John Dexter established a trading post that became the center for swapping prospecting information for the entire Seward Peninsula. Gold was discovered in 1898 at [[Council, Alaska|Council]] and Golovin became a supply point for the gold fields. Supplies were unloaded from ships at Golovin and shipped across Golovnin Lagoon and up the [[Fish River (Alaska)|Fish]] and [[Niukluk River|Niukluk]] Rivers to Council.\n\nWhen gold was discovered in what is now [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], much of the mining and shipping activity moved there and Golovin declined in population.\n\n[[Reindeer]] herding was introduced in the area about 1900.\n\nGolovin is used as a checkpoint on the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race|Iditarod]] in [[Nome, Alaska]].<ref>Elim to Golovin. http://www.iditarod.com/checkpoints/checkpoint48.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923013328/http://iditarod.com/checkpoints/checkpoint48.html |date=2010-09-23 }}</ref><ref>Mackey Blows Through Elim Headed for Golovin. {{cite web |url=http://iditarodblogs.com/news/2010/03/15/2893/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502033525/http://iditarodblogs.com/news/2010/03/15/2893/ |archivedate=2010-05-02 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Golovin}}\n* [http://library.state.ak.us/asp/edocs/2007/04/ocn123495361.pdf Subsistence wildlife harvests in five northwest Alaska communities, 2001-2003 : results of a household survey / by Kawerak, Inc., Maniilaq Association, and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game ; by Susan Georgette ...

The 1900 census considered Golofnin City a successor to Golofnin Bay, though it appeared that this community was located at the site of the Golovin (or Golofnin) Mission, a Swedish Evangelical Union mission and reindeer station, which was along the west side of the Golovnin Bay (now since abandoned). To compound the confusion, a post office (called Golovin) was established at the mission in 1899, but closed in 1906.

Lt. [[Lavrenty Zagoskin]], from the Imperial Russian Navy sent to Alaska to scout locations for trading posts, reported the village as \"Ikalikguigmyut\" in 1842. In 1867, the Mission Covenant of Sweden established a church and school south of the current site of Golovin. Around 1890, John Dexter established a trading post that became the center for swapping prospecting information for the entire Seward Peninsula. Gold was discovered in 1898 at [[Council, Alaska|Council]] and Golovin became a supply point for the gold fields. Supplies were unloaded from ships at Golovin and shipped across Golovnin Lagoon and up the [[Fish River (Alaska)|Fish]] and [[Niukluk River|Niukluk]] Rivers to Council.\n\nWhen gold was discovered in what is now [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], much of the mining and shipping activity moved there and Golovin declined in population.\n\n[[Reindeer]] herding was introduced in the area about 1900.\n\nGolovin is used as a checkpoint on the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race|Iditarod]] in [[Nome, Alaska]].<ref>Elim to Golovin. http://www.iditarod.com/checkpoints/checkpoint48.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923013328/http://iditarod.com/checkpoints/checkpoint48.html |date=2010-09-23 }}</ref><ref>Mackey Blows Through Elim Headed for Golovin. {{cite web |url=http://iditarodblogs.com/news/2010/03/15/2893/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502033525/http://iditarodblogs.com/news/2010/03/15/2893/ |archivedate=2010-05-02 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Golovin}}\n* [http://library.state.ak.us/asp/edocs/2007/04/ocn123495361.pdf Subsistence wildlife harvests in five northwest Alaska communities, 2001-2003 : results of a household survey / by Kawerak, Inc., Maniilaq Association, and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game ; by Susan Georgette ...

Juan Urteaga (vocals), Colin Davis (guitar), Jim Tkacz (guitar), Matt Faivre (bass), Mike Hamilton (drums). The band's signature style, namely the mixture of Floridian style death metal riffing with catchy rhythmic grooves, was generated at this time.  The band's self-released debut LP, ''Stench of the Deceased'', contained six of the previously recorded demo songs and two new songs, re-recorded.  Jim Tkacz left the band before the album was recorded and was replaced by Aaron Strong, who had appeared on the previous demos as a guest lead guitarist.    \n\nDuring this period Vile played often in the Bay Area, often opening for more prominent acts such as [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]], [[Cannibal Corpse]], [[Morbid Angel]] and others. They toured eastward into Texas with [[Deeds of Flesh]] in 1997 and played a West Coast mini tour with [[Immolation (band)|Immolation]] in 1998.  \n\nThe band received some initial positive attention in the death metal music scene and press due to fact that members of Cannibal Corpse spoke highly of them in interviews and wore their T-shirts publicly.  \n\nAfter the release of their debut LP, [[Relapse Records]] began courting the band and they played the Relapse stages at the 1999 [[Milwaukee Metalfest]] as well as the [[November to Dismember]] metalfest in San Antonio Texas the same year. They again played the Relapse stage at the year 2000 Milwaukee Metalfest.  \n\nRelapse Records signed the band to a three-album deal in 2000, but then dropped the band in 2001 during a period of quiet after drummer Mike Hamilton quit the band and Vile had a difficult time replacing him.  \n\nHamilton was eventually replaced by drummer Tyson Jupin and the band signed to the French label Listenable Records as well as striking a North American deal with Unique Leader Records.  \n\nVile released their second LP, ''Depopulate'' in 2002.  This album was notably faster and more progressive and received good reviews from fans and the press.  The band toured Europe in 2003 as a headliner with Mangled, Disavowed and Spawn of Possession.  In 2004 they opened for Cannibal Corpse during the Tour of the Wretched North American tour.  Both of these tours incorporated guest drummer [[Reno Kiilerich]] who subsequently played with [[Dimmu Borgir]] and [[Hate Eternal]]. The Cannibal tour also incorporated James Lee of the band [[Origin (band)|Origin]] as fill in vocalist and Luke Jaeger on lead guitars.  \n\nIn 2005 the band released their third LP, The New Age of Chaos.  This album featured more prominent melodies and song structures were simplified.  Singer Juan Urteaga performed on the album but left the band after its release.  The band toured the US and Europe in support of the album in 2005 and 2006. [[Marco Pitruzzella|Marco Pitruzella]] played drums for the band during a California mini tour in 2006 and brothers J.J. and Mike Hrubovcak (guitar and vocals) joined the band.   \n\nVile was relatively quiet during the years of 2007-2011 as Colin Davis, remaining as the only original member of the band and a professional audio engineer (Imperial Mastering), dedicated himself to producing, recording and mastering.  \n\nVile's fourth LP, Metamorphosis was released in late 2011 on [[Willowtip Records]] in North America and [[Hammerheart Records]] in Europe.  The album's music and lyrics were written entirely by guitarist Colin Davis.  The stylistic trend towards increasing melodies and standard song structuring continued.  The band headlined a European tour in 2012 and played the West Coast and Japan in 2013.

He specialised in [[genre scenes]] and is noted for his [[trompe l'oeil]] \"niche\" paintings and candlelit night-scenes with strong [[chiaroscuro]]. He was a student of [[Rembrandt]].\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Gerrit Dou - Girl Chopping Onions - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Girl Chopping Onions'', 1646]]\nDou was born in [[Leiden]], where his father was a manufacturer of stained-glass.<ref name=baer28>Baer, p.28</ref> He studied drawing under [[Bartholomeus Dolendo]], and then trained in the stained-glass workshop of [[Pieter Couwenhorn]]. In February 1628, at the age of fourteen, his father sent him to study painting in the studio of [[Rembrandt]] (then aged about 21) who lived nearby.<ref name=baer28/>  From Rembrandt, with whom he remained for about three years, he acquired his skill in colouring and in the more subtle effects of [[chiaroscuro]], and his master's style is reflected in several of his earlier pictures, notably a self-portrait at the age of 22 in the [[Bridgewater Collection]], and in the ''Blind Tobit going to meet his Son'', at [[Wardour Castle]] [locations may be outdated].<ref name=eb1911>''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' 1911</ref>\n \nAt a comparatively early point in his career, however, he developed a distinctive manner of his own which diverged considerably from Rembrandt's, cultivating a minute and elaborate style of treatment. He is said to have spent five days in painting a hand, and his work was so fine that he found it necessary to manufacture his own brushes.<ref name=eb1911/>\n[[File:Dou, Gerrit - A Woman playing a Clavichord - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''A Woman Playing a [[Clavichord]]'', c. 1665]]\n\nNotwithstanding the minuteness of his touch, the general effect was harmonious and free from stiffness, and his colour was always fresh and transparent. He often represented subjects in lantern or candle light, the effects of which he reproduced with an unparalleled fidelity and skill. He often painted with the aid of a concave lens combined with a convex mirror (the former sharpening perception, the latter providing a rightway-up image to paint from), and to obtain exactness looked at his subject through a frame crossed with squares of silk thread. His practice as a portrait painter, which was at first considerable, gradually declined, sitters being unwilling to give him the time that he deemed necessary. His pictures were always small in size. More than 200 are attributed to him, and examples are to be found in most of the major public collections of Europe.<ref name=eb1911/> His ''chef-d'oeuvre'' is generally considered to be ''[[:Image:Gerrit Dou - De waterzuchtige vrouw.jpg|The dropsical woman]]'' (1663), and ''[[:Image:Gerrit Dou - De Hollandse huisvrouw.jpg|The Dutch Housewife]]'' (1650), both in the [[Louvre]]. The ''Evening School'', in the Amsterdam Rijksmuseum, is the best example of the candlelight scenes in which he excelled. In the [[National Gallery, London]], favorable specimens are to be seen in the ''[[:Image:Gerard Dou 004.jpg|Poulterer's Shop]]'' (1672), and a self-portrait (see above).<ref name=eb1911/>  Dou's pictures brought high prices,  and one patron, Pieter Spiering, who acted as Swedish Ambassador in The Hague from the mid-1630s, paid him 500 guilders annually simply for the right of first refusal of his latest works.<ref>Baer, p.30. Spiering was the son of a wealthy Delft tapestry manufacturer.</ref> Queen Christina of Sweden owned eleven paintings by Dou, and Cosimo III de' Medici visited his house, where he may have bought at least one of the works now in the Uffizi.

Angels also stresses how Dou\u2019s paintings expressed the [[Paragone|paragone debate]] current around that time. The debate was an ongoing competition between painting, sculpture and poetry as to which was the best representation of nature. It was especially popular in Leiden where the painters were seeking to obtain the rights of a guild from the town council in order to have laws for their economic protection.<ref>Eric Jan Sluijter: ''De Lof der Schilderkunst. Over schilderijen van Gerrit Dou (1613-1675) en een traktaat van Philips Angel uit 1642'', Hilversum 1993 (Zeven Provinci\u00ebn Reeks; Uitgeverij Verloren). 83 pp. + 45 ill</ref>\n\n[[File:Gerard Dou - Maid at the Window - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Maid at the Window'', c. 1660]]\n\nThe paragone debate is not only addressed in writings from that time but is also reflected in the subject matter of several of Dou\u2019s paintings. An example of this is the ''Old Painter at work'', in which an old painter is shown working on a canvas behind a table displaying objects that show his capabilities of imitation. The aged painter refers to an argument in the paragone debate that a painter can achieve his best work at an old age, while a sculptor cannot because of the physical demands of sculpting. On the table, a sculptured head and a printed book are rendered in a lifelike fashion to show that painting can imitate both sculpture and printed paper, thereby reinforcing the notion that painting trumps sculpture. According to Sluijter, the \"amazing true-to-life peacock and a beautiful Triton shell, next to a copper pot with the most refined reflections of light\" show that art beats nature. Sluijter argues that the peacock stands for the ability of painting to \"preserve the transient works of nature thereby even surpassing it\".  [Sluijter, 2000]{{Full citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nDifficulties arise when an artist wants to associate a certain meaning with a specific object. One of the most troublesome and thus one of the most instructive objects in Dou\u2019s oeuvre is a relief by [[Fran\u00e7ois Duquesnoy]] called ''Putti Teasing a Goat''. This relief features in many of Dou\u2019s pictures with a window-sill motif, and has been assigned various meanings. J. A. Emmens, for example, states that in ''The Trumpeter'' the relief represents \"the deceitfulness of human desires, because the goat, personifying lust, can time and again be deceived by appearance, by the deceptive imitation, which is the mask\".  [Emmens, Opstellen, cit. (note 4), vol. 2, p 183 in Hecht, 2002]{{Full citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n''The Kitchen Maid with a Boy in a Window'' features a maidservant, fish and a little boy holding a hare, cramped together with a bunch of vegetables, a dead bird and copperware. Sluijter acknowledges that a contemporary viewer would have certainly approved of this scene as representing an approximation of life since the rendering of all the material is very realistic. On the overall series of maidservant-scenes, Sluijter remarks that the image of a maidservant was generally associated with a sexual undertone. According to de Jongh, this motif has erotic references. In his article on [[Erotica]] in 17th-century genre pieces, de Jongh argues that dead hunted birds and animals most likely all refer to the notion of eroticism and availability of the woman depicted because birding and hunting were synonyms for sexual encounters. All images of maidservants accompanied by dead birds or animals refer to hunting and ''vogelen'' (birding), which in Dutch means to copulate. The maidservants are thereby explicitly erotic. Certainly, a cock as a bird refers to a cock as the male sex organ and this can be seen hanging from the wall in ''Kitchen Maid with a Boy in a Window''. [de Jongh, 1968\u20131969]{{Full citation needed|date=November 2014}} De Jongh\u00b4s erotic interpretations can be disputed regarding the paintings by Gerard Dou because he depicts his dead chicks and furry hares not only with seductive maidservants but also as props in motifs with old servants, or in domestic household scenes, such as the ''Young Mother''.\n\n[[File:Gerrit Dou (Dutch, 1613\u20131675), Sleeping Dog, 1650. Oil on panel.jpg|thumb|left|''Sleeping Dog'', 1650. Oil on panel ([[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]])]]\n[[File:Gerard Dou - Trumpet-Player in front of a Banquet - WGA06662.jpg|thumb|''Trumpet-Player in front of a Banquet'', 1660\u20131665 ([[Louvre Palace]])]]\n\nAdditionally, to objects possibly having a deeper meaning via [[emblem book|emblem books]], complete scenes in Dou\u2019s oeuvre have been related to scenes depicted in emblem books or prints. The ''Girl Pouring Water'' is a variation of the theme ''Educatio prima bona sit'' from Boissards ''Vesuntini emblemata''. This emblem depicts the moral that \"children absorb knowledge like a pot absorbs water\". The gaining of knowledge is represented by a little boy standing in the background while the water is poured in the foreground. [Hollander, 2002]{{Full citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nOne painting that is strongly associated with an emblem is the ''Night School''. This particular painting is rather anecdotal in character. Baer disagrees with Hecht who refers to this painting as being merely a demonstration of Dou\u2019s abilities to work with artificial light. Baer identifies the candle lights with the light of understanding, and she relates the unlit lantern on the left wall with ignorance, which is combated by teaching, represented by the lit lantern in the middle of the floor. Additionally, Baer suggests that the girl at the left is a representation of Cognitione because she strikes the same pose as in [[Cesare Ripa]]\u2019s ''Iconologia''.  Like Ripa\u2019s emblem, the girl in Dou\u2019s painting holds a candle while pointing towards a line of text. The essence of Ripa\u2019s emblem is that \u201clike our eyes, which need light to see, so our reason needs our senses, especially that of sight, to achieve true understanding\u201d. [Baer, 2001]{{Full citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Posthumous reputation==\n\nDou's work commanded high prices long after his death, until the 1860s. Soon after, he fell into near complete obscurity.<ref name=\"Johnson\">Johnson, Paul. ''Art: A New History'', Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2003.</ref> For example, when the Metropolitan Museum of Art held in an exhibit to introduce Dutch art, it featured 37 by Rembrandt, 20 by Hals, but none by Dou.

The Dutch royal court itself, however, preferred work of a more classical tendency.<ref>Baer, p.32</ref>\n\nDou died in Leiden.<ref name=eb1911/> His most noted pupils were [[Frans van Mieris the Elder]].<ref name=eb1911/> and [[Gabri\u00ebl Metsu]].

Angels also stresses how Dou\u2019s paintings expressed the [[Paragone|paragone debate]] current around that time. The debate was an ongoing competition between painting, sculpture and poetry as to which was the best representation of nature. It was especially popular in Leiden where the painters were seeking to obtain the rights of a guild from the town council in order to have laws for their economic protection.<ref>Eric Jan Sluijter: ''De Lof der Schilderkunst. Over schilderijen van Gerrit Dou (1613-1675) en een traktaat van Philips Angel uit 1642'', Hilversum 1993 (Zeven Provinci\u00ebn Reeks; Uitgeverij Verloren). 83 pp. + 45 ill</ref>\n\n[[File:Gerard Dou - Maid at the Window - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Maid at the Window'', c. 1660]]\n\nThe paragone debate is not only addressed in writings from that time but is also reflected in the subject matter of several of Dou\u2019s paintings. An example of this is the ''Old Painter at work'', in which an old painter is shown working on a canvas behind a table displaying objects that show his capabilities of imitation. The aged painter refers to an argument in the paragone debate that a painter can achieve his best work at an old age, while a sculptor cannot because of the physical demands of sculpting. On the table, a sculptured head and a printed book are rendered in a lifelike fashion to show that painting can imitate both sculpture and printed paper, thereby reinforcing the notion that painting trumps sculpture. According to Sluijter, the \"amazing true-to-life peacock and a beautiful Triton shell, next to a copper pot with the most refined reflections of light\" show that art beats nature. Sluijter argues that the peacock stands for the ability of painting to \"preserve the transient works of nature thereby even surpassing it\".  [Sluijter, 2000]{{Full citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nDifficulties arise when an artist wants to associate a certain meaning with a specific object. One of the most troublesome and thus one of the most instructive objects in Dou\u2019s oeuvre is a relief by [[Fran\u00e7ois Duquesnoy]] called ''Putti Teasing a Goat''. This relief features in many of Dou\u2019s pictures with a window-sill motif, and has been assigned various meanings. J. A. Emmens, for example, states that in ''The Trumpeter'' the relief represents \"the deceitfulness of human desires, because the goat, personifying lust, can time and again be deceived by appearance, by the deceptive imitation, which is the mask\".  [Emmens, Opstellen, cit. (note 4), vol. 2, p 183 in Hecht, 2002]{{Full citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n''The Kitchen Maid with a Boy in a Window'' features a maidservant, fish and a little boy holding a hare, cramped together with a bunch of vegetables, a dead bird and copperware. Sluijter acknowledges that a contemporary viewer would have certainly approved of this scene as representing an approximation of life since the rendering of all the material is very realistic. On the overall series of maidservant-scenes, Sluijter remarks that the image of a maidservant was generally associated with a sexual undertone. According to de Jongh, this motif has erotic references. In his article on [[Erotica]] in 17th-century genre pieces, de Jongh argues that dead hunted birds and animals most likely all refer to the notion of eroticism and availability of the woman depicted because birding and hunting were synonyms for sexual encounters. All images of maidservants accompanied by dead birds or animals refer to hunting and ''vogelen'' (birding), which in Dutch means to copulate. The maidservants are thereby explicitly erotic. Certainly, a cock as a bird refers to a cock as the male sex organ and this can be seen hanging from the wall in ''Kitchen Maid with a Boy in a Window''. [de Jongh, 1968\u20131969]{{Full citation needed|date=November 2014}} De Jongh\u00b4s erotic interpretations can be disputed regarding the paintings by Gerard Dou because he depicts his dead chicks and furry hares not only with seductive maidservants but also as props in motifs with old servants, or in domestic household scenes, such as the ''Young Mother''.\n\n[[File:Gerrit Dou (Dutch, 1613\u20131675), Sleeping Dog, 1650. Oil on panel.jpg|thumb|left|''Sleeping Dog'', 1650. Oil on panel ([[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]])]]\n[[File:Gerard Dou - Trumpet-Player in front of a Banquet - WGA06662.jpg|thumb|''Trumpet-Player in front of a Banquet'', 1660\u20131665 ([[Louvre Palace]])]]\n\nAdditionally, to objects possibly having a deeper meaning via [[emblem book|emblem books]], complete scenes in Dou\u2019s oeuvre have been related to scenes depicted in emblem books or prints. The ''Girl Pouring Water'' is a variation of the theme ''Educatio prima bona sit'' from Boissards ''Vesuntini emblemata''. This emblem depicts the moral that \"children absorb knowledge like a pot absorbs water\". The gaining of knowledge is represented by a little boy standing in the background while the water is poured in the foreground. [Hollander, 2002]{{Full citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nOne painting that is strongly associated with an emblem is the ''Night School''. This particular painting is rather anecdotal in character. Baer disagrees with Hecht who refers to this painting as being merely a demonstration of Dou\u2019s abilities to work with artificial light. Baer identifies the candle lights with the light of understanding, and she relates the unlit lantern on the left wall with ignorance, which is combated by teaching, represented by the lit lantern in the middle of the floor. Additionally, Baer suggests that the girl at the left is a representation of Cognitione because she strikes the same pose as in [[Cesare Ripa]]\u2019s ''Iconologia''.  Like Ripa\u2019s emblem, the girl in Dou\u2019s painting holds a candle while pointing towards a line of text. The essence of Ripa\u2019s emblem is that \u201clike our eyes, which need light to see, so our reason needs our senses, especially that of sight, to achieve true understanding\u201d. [Baer, 2001]{{Full citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Posthumous reputation==\n\nDou's work commanded high prices long after his death, until the 1860s.

It's beautiful, and I still have it, but it's heavy as shit. I jump and run around a lot onstage, and it was really getting to my shoulder, so I was looking for a lighter guitar. I heard from one of our road crew that [[Eric Carmen]] from the [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]] was selling a Melody Maker, so I ended up buying it. Now, this is the guitar that he played on \"Go All the Way\" and all those [Raspberries] hits. And then I played it on \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\", \"Crimson and Clover\", \"Do You Want to Touch Me\", \"Bad Reputation\" ...all those early records. Then I took it off the road because I got nervous that someone was gonna steal it or break it. It's so beautiful. It's white, has no stickers on it, and there are cracks in the paint and yellowing from age or club cigarettes. It's an unbelievable-looking guitar. I have it in a closet and I take it out occasionally to record. But I don't even need to use it to record anymore, because I have a guitar that sounds pretty much like it. I'm actually kind of afraid to bring out the original. It's got a great heritage. It's a guitar full of hits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/dear-guitar-hero-joan-jett-talks-gibson-melody-makers-runaways-pre-show-jitters-and-more|title=Joan Jett Talks Gibson Melody Makers, the Runaways, Pre-Show Jitters and More|author=Brad Angle|website=Guitar WOrld|accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ericcarmen.com/forums/index.php?/topic/31131-joan-jett-talks-erics-guitar/|title=Joan Jett Talks Eric's Guitar|website=EricCarmen.com|accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Joan Jett by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|Jett promoting [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] in [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], New York City, 2010]]\n\nJett has consistently refused either to confirm or deny rumors that she is lesbian or [[Bisexuality|bisexual]].

It's beautiful, and I still have it, but it's heavy as shit. I jump and run around a lot onstage, and it was really getting to my shoulder, so I was looking for a lighter guitar. I heard from one of our road crew that [[Eric Carmen]] from the [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]] was selling a Melody Maker, so I ended up buying it. Now, this is the guitar that he played on \"Go All the Way\" and all those [Raspberries] hits. And then I played it on \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\", \"Crimson and Clover\", \"Do You Want to Touch Me\", \"Bad Reputation\" ...all those early records. Then I took it off the road because I got nervous that someone was gonna steal it or break it. It's so beautiful. It's white, has no stickers on it, and there are cracks in the paint and yellowing from age or club cigarettes. It's an unbelievable-looking guitar. I have it in a closet and I take it out occasionally to record. But I don't even need to use it to record anymore, because I have a guitar that sounds pretty much like it. I'm actually kind of afraid to bring out the original. It's got a great heritage.

Its function was to hold the [[Minotaur]], the monster eventually killed by the [[hero]] [[Theseus]]. Daedalus had so cunningly made the Labyrinth that he could barely escape it after he built it.<ref>{{harvnb|Doob|1992|p=36}}</ref>\n\nAlthough early Cretan coins occasionally exhibit branching (multicursal) patterns,<ref>Kern, ''Through the Labyrinth'', 2000, item 43, p. 53.</ref> the single-path (unicursal) seven-course \"Classical\" design without branching or dead ends became associated with the Labyrinth on coins as early as 430 BC,<ref>Kern, ''Through the Labyrinth'', 2000, item 50, p. 54.</ref> and similar non-branching patterns became widely used as visual representations of the Labyrinth \u2013 even though both logic and literary descriptions make it clear that the Minotaur was trapped in a complex branching maze.<ref>Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth'', pp. 40\u201341.</ref> Even as the designs became more elaborate, visual depictions of the mythological Labyrinth from Roman times until the Renaissance are almost invariably unicursal.  Branching mazes were reintroduced only when [[hedge maze]]s became popular during the Renaissance.\n\nIn English, the term ''labyrinth'' is generally synonymous with ''[[maze]]''.  As a result of the long history of unicursal representation of the mythological Labyrinth, however, many contemporary scholars and enthusiasts observe a distinction between the two.  In this specialized usage ''maze'' refers to a complex branching multicursal puzzle with choices of path and direction, while a unicursal ''labyrinth'' has only a single path to the center. A labyrinth in this sense has an unambiguous route to the center and back and presents no navigational challenge.<ref>Kern, ''Through the Labyrinth'', p. 23.</ref><ref>The usage restricting ''maze'' to patterns that involve choices of path is mentioned by Matthews (p. 2\u20133) as early as 1922, though he does not find the distinction useful and does not follow it himself.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labyrinthos.net/Labyrinth%20Typology.pdf |author=Jeff Saward |website=Labyrinthos |title=Mazes or Labyrinths? |access-date=28 Dec 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://labyrinthsociety.org/about-labyrinths | website=The Labyrinth Society | title=About Labyrinths | access-date=18 Sep 2015 \n}}</ref>\n\nUnicursal labyrinths appeared as designs on [[pottery]] or [[basketry]], as [[body art]], and in etchings on walls of caves or churches.  The Romans created many primarily decorative unicursal designs on walls and floors in tile or mosaic.  Many labyrinths set in floors or on the ground are large enough that the path can be walked. Unicursal patterns have been used historically both in group ritual and for private [[meditation]], and are increasingly found for therapeutic use in hospitals and hospices.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Labyrinth'' is a word of [[pre-Greek]] origin, which the Greeks associated with the palace of [[Knossos]] in [[Crete]], excavated by [[Arthur Evans]] early in the 20th century.

Another contender is a series of tunnels at [[Gortyn]], accessed by a narrow crack but expanding into interlinking caverns. Unlike the Skotino cave, these caverns have smooth walls and columns, and appear to have been at least partially man-made. This site corresponds to an unusual labyrinth symbol on a 16th-century map of Crete contained in a book of maps in the library of [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. A map of the caves themselves was produced by the [[France|French]] in 1821. The site was also used by German soldiers to store ammunition during the [[Second World War]].

[[Herodotus]], in Book II of his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)#Book II (Euterpe)|Histories]]'', describes as a \"labyrinth\" a building complex in Egypt, \"near the place called the [[Crocodilopolis|City of Crocodiles]],\" that he considered to surpass the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]]:\n{{blockquote|It has twelve covered courts \u2014 six in a row facing north, six south \u2014 the gates of the one range exactly fronting the gates of the other. Inside, the building is of two storeys and contains three thousand rooms, of which half are underground, and the other half directly above them. I was taken through the rooms in the upper storey, so what I shall say of them is from my own observation, but the underground ones I can speak of only from report, because the Egyptians in charge refused to let me see them, as they contain the tombs of the kings who built the labyrinth, and also the tombs of the sacred crocodiles. The upper rooms, on the contrary, I did actually see, and it is hard to believe that they are the work of men; the baffling and intricate passages from room to room and from court to court were an endless wonder to me, as we passed from a courtyard into rooms, from rooms into galleries, from galleries into more rooms and thence into yet more courtyards. The roof of every chamber, courtyard, and gallery is, like the walls, of stone. The walls are covered with carved figures, and each court is exquisitely built of white marble and surrounded by a colonnade.<ref>[[Herodotus]], ''[[The Histories of Herodotus|The Histories]]'', translated by [[Aubrey de S\u00e9lincourt]], Book II, pp. 160\u201361.</ref>}}\n\nDuring the 19th century, the remains of this structure were discovered by [[Flinders Petrie]] at the foot of the pyramid of [[Amenemhat III]] at [[Hawara]] in the [[Faiyum Oasis]].<ref>Matthews, p. 13.</ref> The Classical accounts of various authors (Herodotus, Strabo, Pliny the Elder, among others) are not entirely consistent, perhaps due to degradation of the structure during Classical times.<ref>Kern 2000, p. 59.</ref>  In origin, the structure was likely a collection of funerary temples such as are commonly found near Egyptian pyramids.<ref>Kern 2000, p. 59.</ref>\n\nIn 1898, the ''[[Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities]]'' described the structure as \"the largest of all the temples of Egypt, the so-called Labyrinth, of which, however, only the foundation stones have been preserved.\"<ref>[[Harry Thurston Peck|Peck, Harry Thurston (chief editor)]].  \"Hieratic Papyrus. (Twentieth Dynasty.)\" in the ''[[Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities]]'', published 1898, page 29.</ref>\n\nHerodotus' description of the Egyptian Labyrinth inspired some central scenes in [[Boles\u0142aw Prus]]' 1895 [[historical novel]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)#Inspirations|Pharaoh]]''.\n\n===Pliny's Lemnian labyrinth===\n[[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''Natural History'' (36.90) lists the legendary [[Smilis]], reputed to be a contemporary of Daedalus, together with the historical mid-sixth-century BC architects and sculptors Rhoikos and Theodoros as two of the makers of the Lemnian labyrinth, which Andrew Stewart<ref>Andrew Stewart, ''One Hundred Greek Sculptors: Their Careers and Extant Works'', \"Smilis.\"</ref> regards as \"evidently a misunderstanding of the Samian temple's location ''en limnais'' ['in the marsh'].\"\n\n===Pliny's Italian labyrinth===\nAccording to Pliny, the tomb of the great Etruscan general [[Lars Porsena]] contained an underground maze. Pliny's description of the exposed portion of the tomb is intractable; Pliny, it seems clear, had not observed this structure himself, but is quoting the historian and Roman antiquarian [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]].\n\n===Ancient labyrinths outside Europe===\n[[File:Halebid2.JPG|thumb|right|Carving showing the warrior Abhimanyu entering the ''chakravyuha'' \u2013 [[Hoysaleswara temple]], [[Halebidu]], India]]\nA design essentially identical to the 7-course \"classical\" pattern appeared in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] culture, the [[Tohono O'odham people]] labyrinth which features [[I'itoi]], the \"Man in the Maze.\" The Tonoho O'odham pattern has two distinct differences from the classical: it is radial in design, and the entrance is at the top, where traditional labyrinths have the entrance at the bottom (see below).

An image of the [[Minotaur]] or an allusion to the legend of the Minotaur appears at the center of many of these mosaic labyrinths. The four-axis medieval patterns may have developed from the Roman model, but are more varied in how the four quadrants of the design are traced out. The Minotaur or other danger is retained in the center of several medieval examples. The Chartres pattern (named for its appearance in [[Chartres Cathedral]]) is the most common medieval design; it appears in manuscripts as early as the 9th century.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Classical 7-Circuit Labyrinth.svg|\"Classical\" or \"Cretan\" design, well-known in antiquity.\nFile:Labirinto do Outeiro do Cribo.JPG|Labyrinth at [[Meis]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], possibly from the [[Atlantic Bronze Age]]\nFile:NAMA Tablette 1287.jpg|Earliest securely dated labyrinth, incised on a clay tablet from [[Pylos]], ca 1200 BC\nFile:Labirinto, armati e figure di paletta - Parco di Naquane R 1 - Capo di Ponte (Foto Luca Giarelli).jpg|Labyrinth among [[rock drawings in Valcamonica]], [[Italy]], probably 1st millennium BC\nFile:Theseus Minotaur Mosaic.jpg|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[mosaic]] picturing [[Theseus]] and the [[Minotaur]].

These labyrinths, generally in coastal areas, are marked out with stones, most often in the simple 7- or 11-course classical forms. They often have names which translate as \"[[Troy Town]].\" They are thought to have been constructed by fishing communities:  trapping malevolent [[troll]]s or winds in the labyrinth's coils might ensure a safe fishing expedition.

His use of it has inspired other authors (e.g. [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', Mark Z. Danielewski's ''[[House of Leaves]]''). Additionally, [[Roger Zelazny]]'s fantasy series, ''[[The Chronicles of Amber]]'', features a labyrinth, called \"the Pattern,\" which grants those who walk it the power to move between parallel worlds. The avant-garde multi-screen film, ''[[In the Labyrinth (film)|In the Labyrinth]]'', presents a search for meaning in a symbolic modern labyrinth. In [[Rick Riordan]]'s series [[Percy Jackson & the Olympians]], the events of the fourth novel ''[[The Battle of the Labyrinth]]'' predominantly take place within the labyrinth of Daedalus, which has followed [[History of Western civilization|the heart of the West]] to settle beneath the [[United States]]. Australian author [[Sara Douglass]] incorporated some labyrinthine ideas in her series [[The Troy Game]], in which the Labyrinth on Crete is one of several in the ancient world, created with the cities as a source of magical power. [[Lawrence Durrell]]'s ''The Dark Labyrinth'' depicts travelers trapped underground in Crete. A magical labyrinth, based on the original myth, appears in the third episode of ''[[The Librarians (2014 TV series)|The Librarians]]'' (\"And The Horns of a Dilemma\"). Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's [[The Shining]] introduces a labyrinth to the original story as a setting for the final confrontation between Jack and Danny Torrance. \n\nThe labyrinth is also treated in contemporary [[fine arts]]. Examples include [[Piet Mondrian]]'s ''Dam and Ocean'' (1915), [[Joan Mir\u00f3]]'s ''Labyrinth'' (1923), [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''Minotauromachia'' (1935), [[M. C. Escher]]'s ''[[Relativity (M. C.

In this they may be preserving its original meaning: the ultimate ancestor, here evoked by two continuous lines joining its twelve primary joints.\"<ref name=\"Schuster 1996 307\">\n{{cite book|last=Schuster|first=Carl, & Edmund Carpenter|title=Patterns that Connect: Social Symbolism in Ancient & Tribal Art|year=1996|publisher=Harry N.

These are often used for contemplation; walking among the turnings, one loses track of direction and of the outside world, and thus quiets the mind. The Labyrinth Society<ref>[http://wwll.veriditas.labyrinthsociety.org/ Labyrinth.Society.org]</ref> provides a locator for modern labyrinths all over the world.\n\nIn addition, the labyrinth can serve as a metaphor for situations that are difficult to be extricated from, as an image that suggests getting lost in a subterranean dungeon-like world. [[Octavio Paz]] titled his book on [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[National identity|identity]] ''[[The Labyrinth of Solitude]]'', describing the Mexican condition as orphaned and lost.\n\n===Christian use===\n[[File:Labyrinth at Chartres Cathedral.JPG|thumb|300px|Walking the labyrinth at Chartres Cathedral]]\n\nLabyrinths have on various occasions been used in Christian tradition as a part of worship. The earliest known example is from a fourth-century pavement at the Basilica of St Reparatus, at Orleansville, Algeria, with the words \"Sancta Eclesia\" {{sic}} at the center, though it is unclear how it might have been used in worship.\n\nIn medieval times, labyrinths began to appear on church walls and floors around 1000 C.E..

Its function was to hold the [[Minotaur]], the monster eventually killed by the [[hero]] [[Theseus]]. Daedalus had so cunningly made the Labyrinth that he could barely escape it after he built it.<ref>{{harvnb|Doob|1992|p=36}}</ref>\n\nAlthough early Cretan coins occasionally exhibit branching (multicursal) patterns,<ref>Kern, ''Through the Labyrinth'', 2000, item 43, p. 53.</ref> the single-path (unicursal) seven-course \"Classical\" design without branching or dead ends became associated with the Labyrinth on coins as early as 430 BC,<ref>Kern, ''Through the Labyrinth'', 2000, item 50, p. 54.</ref> and similar non-branching patterns became widely used as visual representations of the Labyrinth \u2013 even though both logic and literary descriptions make it clear that the Minotaur was trapped in a complex branching maze.<ref>Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth'', pp. 40\u201341.</ref> Even as the designs became more elaborate, visual depictions of the mythological Labyrinth from Roman times until the Renaissance are almost invariably unicursal.

In this specialized usage ''maze'' refers to a complex branching multicursal puzzle with choices of path and direction, while a unicursal ''labyrinth'' has only a single path to the center.

The Romans created many primarily decorative unicursal designs on walls and floors in tile or mosaic.  Many labyrinths set in floors or on the ground are large enough that the path can be walked. Unicursal patterns have been used historically both in group ritual and for private [[meditation]], and are increasingly found for therapeutic use in hospitals and hospices.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Labyrinth'' is a word of [[pre-Greek]] origin, which the Greeks associated with the palace of [[Knossos]] in [[Crete]], excavated by [[Arthur Evans]] early in the 20th century.

[[Herodotus]], in Book II of his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)#Book II (Euterpe)|Histories]]'', describes as a \"labyrinth\" a building complex in Egypt, \"near the place called the [[Crocodilopolis|City of Crocodiles]],\" that he considered to surpass the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]]:\n{{blockquote|It has twelve covered courts \u2014 six in a row facing north, six south \u2014 the gates of the one range exactly fronting the gates of the other. Inside, the building is of two storeys and contains three thousand rooms, of which half are underground, and the other half directly above them. I was taken through the rooms in the upper storey, so what I shall say of them is from my own observation, but the underground ones I can speak of only from report, because the Egyptians in charge refused to let me see them, as they contain the tombs of the kings who built the labyrinth, and also the tombs of the sacred crocodiles. The upper rooms, on the contrary, I did actually see, and it is hard to believe that they are the work of men; the baffling and intricate passages from room to room and from court to court were an endless wonder to me, as we passed from a courtyard into rooms, from rooms into galleries, from galleries into more rooms and thence into yet more courtyards. The roof of every chamber, courtyard, and gallery is, like the walls, of stone. The walls are covered with carved figures, and each court is exquisitely built of white marble and surrounded by a colonnade.<ref>[[Herodotus]], ''[[The Histories of Herodotus|The Histories]]'', translated by [[Aubrey de S\u00e9lincourt]], Book II, pp. 160\u201361.</ref>}}\n\nDuring the 19th century, the remains of this structure were discovered by [[Flinders Petrie]] at the foot of the pyramid of [[Amenemhat III]] at [[Hawara]] in the [[Faiyum Oasis]].<ref>Matthews, p. 13.</ref> The Classical accounts of various authors (Herodotus, Strabo, Pliny the Elder, among others) are not entirely consistent, perhaps due to degradation of the structure during Classical times.<ref>Kern 2000, p. 59.</ref>  In origin, the structure was likely a collection of funerary temples such as are commonly found near Egyptian pyramids.<ref>Kern 2000, p. 59.</ref>\n\nIn 1898, the ''[[Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities]]'' described the structure as \"the largest of all the temples of Egypt, the so-called Labyrinth, of which, however, only the foundation stones have been preserved.\"<ref>[[Harry Thurston Peck|Peck, Harry Thurston (chief editor)]].  \"Hieratic Papyrus.

His use of it has inspired other authors (e.g. [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', Mark Z. Danielewski's ''[[House of Leaves]]''). Additionally, [[Roger Zelazny]]'s fantasy series, ''[[The Chronicles of Amber]]'', features a labyrinth, called \"the Pattern,\" which grants those who walk it the power to move between parallel worlds. The avant-garde multi-screen film, ''[[In the Labyrinth (film)|In the Labyrinth]]'', presents a search for meaning in a symbolic modern labyrinth. In [[Rick Riordan]]'s series [[Percy Jackson & the Olympians]], the events of the fourth novel ''[[The Battle of the Labyrinth]]'' predominantly take place within the labyrinth of Daedalus, which has followed [[History of Western civilization|the heart of the West]] to settle beneath the [[United States]]. Australian author [[Sara Douglass]] incorporated some labyrinthine ideas in her series [[The Troy Game]], in which the Labyrinth on Crete is one of several in the ancient world, created with the cities as a source of magical power. [[Lawrence Durrell]]'s ''The Dark Labyrinth'' depicts travelers trapped underground in Crete. A magical labyrinth, based on the original myth, appears in the third episode of ''[[The Librarians (2014 TV series)|The Librarians]]'' (\"And The Horns of a Dilemma\").\n\nThe labyrinth is also treated in contemporary [[fine arts]].

In this they may be preserving its original meaning: the ultimate ancestor, here evoked by two continuous lines joining its twelve primary joints.\"<ref name=\"Schuster 1996 307\">\n{{cite book|last=Schuster|first=Carl, & Edmund Carpenter|title=Patterns that Connect: Social Symbolism in Ancient & Tribal Art|year=1996|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|isbn=978-0-8109-6326-9|page=307}}\n</ref> Schuster also observes the common theme of the labyrinth being a refuge for a trickster; in India, the demon [[Ravana]] has dominion over labyrinths, the trickster Djonaha lives in a labyrinth according to Sumatran [[Batak|Bataks]], and Europeans say it is the home of a rogue.<ref name=\"Schuster 1996 307\"/>\n\nOne can think of labyrinths as symbolic of [[pilgrimage]]; people can walk the path, ascending toward salvation or enlightenment. Author [[Ben Radford]] conducted an investigation into some of the claims of spiritual and healing effects of labyrinths, reporting on his findings in his book [[Mysterious New Mexico]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Radford|first1=Ben|authorlink=Ben Radford|title=Mysterious New Mexico|date=2014|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque, NM|isbn=978-0-8263-5450-1|pages=207\u2013224|chapter=Chapter 10 Labyrinths: Sacred Symbols in the Sand}}</ref>\n\nMany labyrinths have been constructed recently in churches, hospitals, and parks. These are often used for contemplation; walking among the turnings, one loses track of direction and of the outside world, and thus quiets the mind. The Labyrinth Society<ref>[http://wwll.veriditas.labyrinthsociety.org/ Labyrinth.Society.org]</ref> provides a locator for modern labyrinths all over the world.\n\nIn addition, the labyrinth can serve as a metaphor for situations that are difficult to be extricated from, as an image that suggests getting lost in a subterranean dungeon-like world. [[Octavio Paz]] titled his book on [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[National identity|identity]] ''[[The Labyrinth of Solitude]]'', describing the Mexican condition as orphaned and lost.\n\n===Christian use===\n[[File:Labyrinth at Chartres Cathedral.JPG|thumb|300px|Walking the labyrinth at Chartres Cathedral]]\n\nLabyrinths have on various occasions been used in Christian tradition as a part of worship. The earliest known example is from a fourth-century pavement at the Basilica of St Reparatus, at Orleansville, Algeria, with the words \"Sancta Eclesia\" {{sic}} at the center, though it is unclear how it might have been used in worship.\n\nIn medieval times, labyrinths began to appear on church walls and floors around 1000 C.E.. The most famous medieval labyrinth, with great influence on later practice, was created in [[Chartres Cathedral]].<ref name=\"kern_church\">{{cite book\n|last=Kern\n|first=Hermann\n|title=Through the Labyrinth: Designs and Meaning Over 5,000 Years\n|year=2000\n|publisher=Prestel\n|isbn=978-3-7913-2144-8\n|chapter=VIII. Church Labyrinths\n}}</ref> The purpose of the labyrinths is not clear, though there are surviving descriptions of French clerics performing a ritual Easter dance along the path on Easter Sunday.<ref name=\"kern_church\" />  Some books (guidebooks in particular) suggest that mazes on cathedral floors originated in the medieval period as alternatives to pilgrimage to the Holy Land, but the earliest attested use of the phrase \"chemin de Jerusalem\" (path to Jerusalem) dates to the late 18th century when it was used to describe mazes at [[Reims]] and [[Saint-Omer]].<ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite book\n|last=Wright\n|first=Craig M.\n|title=The maze and the warrior: symbols in architecture, theology, and music\n|year=2001\n|publisher=Harvard University Press\n|isbn=978-0-674-00503-7\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-wGs_-9H8IC&pg=PA210&dq=%22Chemin+de+Jerusalem%22#v=onepage&q=%22Chemin%20de%20Jerusalem%22&f=false|page=210\n}}</ref> The accompanying ritual, depicted in Romantic illustrations as involving pilgrims following the maze on their knees while praying, may have been practiced at Chartres during the 17th century.<ref name=\"Wright\" />\n\nThe use of labyrinths has recently been revived in some contexts of Christian worship. Many churches in Europe and North America have constructed permanent, typically unicursal, labyrinths, or employ temporary ones (e.g., painted on canvas or outlined with candles).  For example, a labyrinth was set up on the floor of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] for a week in March 2000.<ref>Ian Tarrant and Sally Dakin, ''Labyrinths and Prayer Stations'', p 6.</ref> Some conservative Christians disapprove of labyrinths, considering them pagan practices or \"new age\" fads.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=3440 |title=Maze Craze |author=Mark Tooley |work=Touchstone Magazine |publisher=The Fellowship of St. James |date=September 2000 |accessdate=December 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Caerdroia]]\n*[[Celtic maze]]\n*[[Hedge maze]]\n*[[I'itoi]]\n*[[Julian's Bower]]\n*[[Mizmaze]]\n*[[Oxkintok]]\n*[[Stone labyrinths of Bolshoi Zayatsky Island]]\n*[[Troy Town]]\n*[[Turf maze]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Hermann Kern, ''Through the Labyrinth'', ed.
