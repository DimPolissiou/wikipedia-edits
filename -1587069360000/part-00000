Once the shuttle and crew were on-orbit, they set about preparing the shuttle for the mission ahead. The first tasks they completed were opening the payload bay doors, activating the [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] antenna, and activating the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS), also known as the [[Canadarm]]. Prior to this, commander [[Mark Kelly (astronaut)|Mark Kelly]] and pilot [[Gregory H. Johnson|Greg Johnson]] completed an engine firing, known as the OMS-2 burn, to circularize the orbit of the shuttle. They also completed another engine firing, the NC-1 burn, to help the shuttle catch up to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).

Commander [[Mark Kelly (astronaut)|Mark Kelly]], pilot [[Gregory H. Johnson|Greg Johnson]] and mission specialist and flight engineer [[Roberto Vittori]] performed a checkout of ''Endeavour''{{'}}s Flight Control Systems (FCS). They began by starting [[Auxiliary Power Unit#Spacecraft|Auxiliary Power Unit 1]] (APU 1), so they could test the flight systems such as the ailerons and rudder. The APU was used to provide hydraulic pressure to power the flight control systems. The astronauts next moved on to a test of the [[Reaction Control System]] (RCS) jets. This test saw Kelly, Johnson and Vittori fire each jet once. Meanwhile, [[Drew Feustel]], [[Mike Fincke]] and [[Greg Chamitoff]] stowed items on the mid-deck for their return to Earth. Later in the crew day, they stowed the [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub> band]] antenna for re-entry. The crew also performed several experiments, including an eye exam and the Ram Burn Observation (RAMBO2) experiments, and conducted a deorbit briefing to go over the procedures for the landing. The entire crew furthermore participated in in-flight interviews with [[ABC News]], [[CBS News]], [[CNN]], [[NBC News]] and [[Fox News Radio]], and sent a crew tribute to ''Endeavour'' down to the ground.<ref name=\"stat31\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts134/news/STS-134-31.html|title=STS-134 MCC Status Report #31|accessdate=31 May 2011|publisher=NASA}}</ref>\n\n===1 June (Flight Day 17 \u2013 Re-entry and landing)===\nThe crew was awakened by mission control at 5:57 PM [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] to begin flight day 17 to the song \"Sunrise No. 1\" by Stormy Mondays.<ref name=mcc32>{{cite news|title=STS-134 MCC Status Report #32|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts134/news/STS-134-32.html|accessdate=1 June 2011|newspaper=NASA}}</ref> The payload bay doors on the shuttle were closed at 10:48&nbsp;p.m. EDT.

However, the shuttle did not actually dock with the ISS again; instead, it was positioned below the station.\n\nOn [[STS-131]], the docking target on the ISS was enhanced with reflectors, to allow for the characterization of the Orion Rel-Nav sensors' performance during STS-134's rendezvous and proximity operations with the ISS. These proximity operations were tested during approach and docking, undocking, flyaround (time permitting), and during a modified separation from the ISS.

The launch of ''Endeavour'' came after an on-time tanking process which filled the shuttle's [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]] with more than {{convert|500000|gal|l|abbr=in|order=flip}} of [[liquid oxygen]] and [[liquid hydrogen]]; the tanking started at 23:36 EDT on 15 May 2011. Once the shuttle and crew were on-orbit, they set about preparing the shuttle for the mission ahead. The first tasks they completed were opening the payload bay doors, activating the [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] antenna, and activating the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS), also known as the [[Canadarm]]. Prior to this, commander [[Mark Kelly (astronaut)|Mark Kelly]] and pilot [[Gregory H.

The joint crews completed a series of leak checks and opened the hatches at 11:38 UTC. Once the hatches were open, the joint crew held a welcome ceremony and completed a safety briefing. The first task for the joint crew was to unberth the [[Express Logistics Carrier]] (ELC) 3, and attach it to its final location on the ISS's [[Integrated Truss Structure|Port 3]] (P3) truss segment. Express Logistics Carrier 3 was removed from the payload bay of ''Endeavour'' by the [[Canadarm|SRMS]] and handed off to the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS), also known as [[Canadarm2]]. The ELC 3 was finally installed at 16:18 UTC. Kelly began to transfer oxygen from space shuttle ''Endeavour'' to the ISS.

The trio was also assisted by commander [[Mark Kelly (astronaut)|Mark Kelly]] in preparing the tools required for the [[Extravehicular Activity]] (EVA). While this was going on, [[Expedition 27]] crew members [[Paolo Nespoli]], [[Cady Coleman]] and [[Ron Garan]] assisted the rest of the STS-134 crew in completing transfers to and from ''Endeavour''. Late in the crew day, the two crews performed an EVA procedures review. After the review, Chamitoff and Feustel camped out in the ''Quest'' Airlock overnight, in preparation for the mission's first spacewalk. The campout was done with the airlock's air pressure reduced, so as to purge [[nitrogen]] bubbles from the astronauts' blood and thus prevent [[decompression sickness]]. Members of both crews also conducted two in-flight interviews with media on the ground, including [[PBS NewsHour]], [[National Public Radio]], [[Associated Press]], [[Reuters]] and [[Fox News]].

They wanted to save this capability, since a CO<sub>2</sub> sensor in Chamitoff's suit had failed during EVA 1, cutting that spacewalk short.<ref name=\"stat21\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts134/news/STS-134-21.html|title=STS-134 MCC Status Report #21|accessdate=26 May 2011|publisher=NASA}}</ref>\n\n===27 May (Flight Day 12 \u2013 EVA 4)===\n[[File:STS-134 EVA4 Michael Fincke 7.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' docked at the [[ISS]].]]\nThe final spacewalk of the STS-134 mission, and the final spacewalk of the Space Shuttle program, was carried out on flight day 12. The EVA was conducted by [[Mike Fincke]] and [[Gregory Chamitoff|Greg Chamitoff]], who began the EVA by installing the [[Orbiter Boom Sensor System]] (OBSS) on the [[Integrated Truss Structure|Starboard 1]] (S1) truss segment. After the OBSS was installed, Fincke and Chamitoff removed the End Effector Grapple Fixture (EFGF) and replaced it with a spare Power and Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF). The station's [[Canadarm2]] could not grapple the EFGF, so the PDGF was installed on the end. After that task was completed, Fincke and Chamitoff moved to the [[Express Logistics Carrier]] (ELC) 3, and released some torque on the bolts that were holding the spare arm for [[Dextre]] down against the ELC. The EVA saw the total cumulative time spent performing EVAs in support of the ISS pass the 1,000-hour mark.

The {{convert|175|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus lacked space for horizontal expansion, following the California State University expansion plan started in 1959. This doubled the university's housing capacity, making Cal State LA the largest in the [[California State University]] system. [[Maxwell Starkman]] & Associates, AIA, of Beverly Hills, designed the development plan. Unlike other components of the Cal State University system being developed in the 1960s, the residence halls were privately financed by [[Louis Lesser Enterprises, Inc.]] The first residential life complex phase I on-campus housing was opened in June 1984, and three years later, a second residential life complex Phase II was opened. Cal State LA has a student-housing complex where students can rent a house at double occupancy for $655.00 per month (as of November 2009).

The driver loaded the excavator backwards and neglected to tuck the boom so the maximum height was actually 17 feet, 9 inches above the roadway. The pedestrian bridge, which had just been inspected in the month prior to the accident and found to be structurally sound, had a vertical clearance of 16 feet.

Occasionally, however, a fictional state is created to house fictional cities, towns, or counties. Typically, a work that features a fictional state will also reveal the names of several cities within that state.\n\n===Non-existent states===\n\n====Named U.S. states====\n\n=====Comics=====\n* '''[[Calisota]]''', in the [[Duck universe]] from various [[Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]] [[comic books]], Calisota is roughly equivalent to [[Northern California]].

Michener]]'s novel ''[[Space (novel)|Space]]'' (1982) located roughly along the border between [[Kansas]] and [[Nebraska]], that is meant to stand for the American [[midwest]] in general. The origin of its name is clearly stated : \"Fremont was the most typical of the great Western states. Named for the flamboyant explorer [[John Charles Fremont]], it had honoured in its four major cities those outstanding politicians of the early 19th century whose interest in the West had helped that vast area become an integral part of the nation.\" (Webster, Calhoun, Clay, Benton - note the relationship with respectively the two great political parties of the US.)<ref>page 124 of the pocket book edition of Michener's \"Space\"</ref>\n* '''Hohoq''', popularly known as '''Ar''' in [[John Hodgman]]'s ''[[The Areas of My Expertise]]'' (2005), is a large flying state inhabited by a mix of [[German-American]] settlers and bird people known as Thunderbirds.

Its capital is located in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]. After President [[Al Smith]] agrees to President [[Jake Featherston]]'s request to hold plebiscites in former Confederate states for readmittance into the Confederacy, Houston is readmitted as part of Texas; however, after the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]] and the annexation of the Confederacy by the United States, Houston is recreated and readmitted as a state of the Union, with the independence of the [[Republic of Texas|Second Republic of Texas]] being put into doubt.\n*'''Jefferson''', in a series of short works called the ''[[State of Jefferson Stories]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]]. Based on the borders of the proposed [[Jefferson (proposed Pacific state)|Pacific state]], this version was created from parts of northern [[California]] and southern [[Oregon]] in 1919 rather than in 1941. The states capital is located in [[Yreka, California|Yreka]]. Moreover, [[Bigfoot|sasquatch]] are real, sentient, and are regular members of Jefferson's society.  \n* '''Michisota''', a fictional state in [[Lisa Wheeler]]'s children's book ''Avalanche Annie: A Not-So-Tall-Tale'' that is a cross between [[Michigan]] and [[Minnesota]], has snowy weather, and a mountain called Mount Himalachia.\n* '''Mickewa''', a state represented by Senator Elias Gotobed, in [[Anthony Trollope]]' novel ''[[The American Senator]]'' (1877).\n* '''Ochichornia''', in [[Vasily Aksyonov]]'s semi-biographic novels and stories, relates to the popular Russian song \"The Dark Eyes\" (\"\u041e\u0447\u0438 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435\", \"Ochi Chernie\" in Russian).

A Confederate state in this timeline, Native Americans enjoy a large degree of autonomy in this state and are generally respected by white Confederates. The state is annexed by the United States along with Houston and Kentucky after the [[Great War (series)|First Great War]]. C.S. President Jake Featherston successfully persuades U.S. President Al Smith to hold referenda in these states to return them to the Confederacy; only Sequoyah votes against re-entry into the Confederacy, becoming one of several ''casus belli'' of the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]] in North America.\n* '''Toxoplassachusetts''', the state occupied by the \"toxoplasmodic hivemind\", which constitutes 1/3 of the U.S. population, in John Hodgman's ''That Is All''.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n* '''Udana'''.

A fictional version of [[Pennsylvania]].\n* '''[[Moosylvania]]''', from [[Jay Ward]]'s ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show|Rocky and Bullwinkle]]'' television series. This state has been contested by the U.S. and [[Canada]] in two episodes of the series, \"Moosylvania\" and \"Moosylvania Saved\". The U.S. says it is a province of Canada, while Canada says it is a U.S. state. It is an island in the middle of western [[Lake Superior]]. [[Bullwinkle J. Moose|Bullwinkle]] is governor of Moosylvania. The state's official sport is farkling. Jay Ward even tried to make the [[51st state]], which he called \"Moosylvania\", by claiming an island off the coast of the U.S. and Canada for himself and promoting it all over the country. When Ward and his publicist, Howard Brandy, arrived at the White House gate with a proposal and signed petition, the guards told them to leave due to the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].\n*'''New Delaware''', mentioned in a January 16, 2013 episode of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' as a state that doesn't exist anymore\u2014an example for Senate officials who \"pick up the wrong state to change the rules with\".<ref>{{cite news|work=The Daily Show with Jon Stewart|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/t02ywb/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-thanks-for-nothing--d--k-trippers |title=Thanks for Nothing, D*#k Trippers}}</ref>\n* '''New Troy'''\n\n:*In ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', is the state wherein [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] is located. New Troy is probably analogous to [[New York State]]. The name was never used as a state in the comics, which has placed Metropolis in various locations along the eastern coast of the United States over the decades. \n:*The place name has also been used by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] as a direct analog of [[New York State]] for the original version of the [[Squadron Supreme]] in assorted [[Marvel Universe]] comics series.\n\n* '''North Texas''' is referenced on [[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]] as a state in the show's alternate universe. A brief shot of a map shows that the Dakotas, Carolinas, and Virginias are each one state, Texas is split in two, Kansas and Oklahoma are combined into a state called \"Midland,\" and the western half of California is missing from the map, although whether the coastline is still part of Mexico or has sunk into the sea is unclear.\n* '''Oklachusetts''', from the [[Seth MacFarlane]] animated short ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve|The Life of Larry]]'' (1995). Larry, who would later become [[Peter Griffin]] in ''[[Family Guy]]'', described it as \"where the wind comes sweeping down the [[Massachusetts Turnpike|Pike]]\".\n* '''Statesota''' is the state in which Moralton is located in the [[Adult Swim]] series ''[[Moral Orel]]''.

Its capital city has the same name: Wichita.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n=====Video games=====\n* '''Alderney''' from ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' is the surrogate to New Jersey. Alderney replaced New Guernsey (see below) as the parody surrogate state in the ''Grand Theft Auto'' series, also getting its name from its [[Channel Islands]] [[Alderney|namesake]]. Alderney is depicted in-game as being directly west of the State of Liberty and a location where a portion of ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' takes place.\n* '''[[Columbia (BioShock)|Columbia]]''', a floating city and former state in ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'' (2013), controversy for its actions in the [[Boxer Rebellion]] having prompted its secession.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stanton|first=Rich|title=How to write BioShock Infinite|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|date=13 March 2013|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-12-how-to-write-bioshock-infinite|accessdate=21 March 2013}}</ref>\n* '''Liberty''' is the state that Liberty City is located in the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' and has been depicted in one form or another the most out of all other fictional states. In ''Grand Theft Auto IV'', Liberty is shown situated directed east of the State of Alderney in and in the 3D universe is stated to be located somewhere close to Carcer City. It is the surrogate to New York.\n* '''New Guernsey''' is a surrogate for [[New Jersey]] state and/or [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] in various fictional contexts, including the [[Batman]] comics, television series and films. Like the real New Jersey, the \"State of New Guernsey\" is named after [[Guernsey|one]] of the Channel Islands. (The similarly named \"New Guernsey\" in the ''Grand Theft Auto'' games series, however, is only a city, located in the state of Alderney; [[#Collections of states as Independent nations|see below]].)\n* '''Temperance''', in ''[[Gangsters 2]]'' (2001). The state map had an eastern coastline and included several large islands, and was made up of a combination of urban and upstate areas. The architecture and in particular civic institutions like the police seemed largely based on [[Illinois]]\u2014the most important fact about it, however, was simply that it was a dry state during [[Prohibition]].\n* '''North Yankton''', in the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013), is the birthplace of Michael De Santa (born Michael Townley) and where the prologue took place. Likely based on [[North Dakota]].\n*'''[[San Andreas (Grand Theft Auto)|San Andreas]]''' is the state where [[Rockstar Games]]' ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' game (2004) is set, housing the cities of [[Los Santos (Grand Theft Auto)|Los Santos]] (based off [[Los Angeles]]), [[San Fierro]] ([[San Francisco]]), and [[Las Venturas]] (Las Vegas).  San Andreas also constitutes the setting of ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013) but only constituting the southern part of the state which contains two counties, one with the City of Los Santos and several other smaller towns.\n* '''Ambarino''' from the video game ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018). It is likely based mostly based on [[Colorado]], and their names share a similar etymology; in the [[Spanish language]], ambarino means \"amber\", whereas Colorado means \"reddish\".\n* '''Lemoyne''' from the video game ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' (2018). It is based on [[Louisiana]] with the states capital being ''Saint Denis'' (a parody of [[New Orleans]]). It is located in the [[Southern United States]].\n* '''New Austin''' from the video games ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010) and ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' (2018). It is strongly based on [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]] but also has influences from southern [[California]], [[Nevada]], and [[Texas]]. It borders the fictional [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of ''Nuevo Para\u00edso''.\n* '''New Hanover''' from the video game ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' (2018). It is based on several states. The Heartlands are based upon the real-life [[Heartland (United States)|American Heartlands]] in states such as [[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], and both North and [[South Dakota]]. The Cumberland Forest is based upon the [[Front Range]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] in Eastern [[Colorado]]. Roanoke Ridge is based upon the [[Ouachita Mountains|Ouachita]] and [[Ozarks]] regions, which include eastern Oklahoma, [[Arkansas]], and southern [[Missouri]]. The states overall geographic placement roughly corresponds to that of Oklahoma and Arkansas.\n* '''West Elizabeth''' from the video games ''Red Dead Redemption'' (2010) and ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' (2018). The Great Plains region is based on the real-life Great Plains region in Oklahoma and Texas. The Tall Trees region is based on the [[Calaveras Big Trees State Park]] and its surrounding areas in Northern [[California]], especially with its sequoia trees, while its placement somewhat corresponds to the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] of [[New Mexico]]. Big Valley is primarily inspired by various mountainous and forested areas of Colorado, such as the [[Rocky Mountain National Park]], Gunnison Valley and the [[San Juan Mountains]]. The area's pine trees, lush grasslands and rocky mountains are quite reminiscent of Colorado.\n* '''North Washington''' is a mysterious state where ''Dead or Alive: Northtown'' novel series takes place, housing the cities and towns of Olyres City (a largest gigantic capital megalopolis of the state), Northtown (a mysterious, sleepy, remote, rural, mining, industrialized, resort, incorporated and company hill city, where there are criminal and supernatural things happen), Southtown, Westtown, Easttown, Willow Creek, Brayle, Farmerville, Ash, Avon's Grove, Comfort, Covenant, Crow's Bridge, Gonen, Otter Ferry, Shoal, Scales, Silvermines, Stoneheim, Strong, Strand, Tallow, Raven City, Tyr, White Falls, Redwood Falls, Yursgrad, Muirthene, Llancarfan, Madrigal, Tandem, Helsford, Myrgard, Avildale Park, Cladsville, Ghostspirit, Dougsfield, Ironmale, Ellywood Springs, Barn City, Bonetown, Jakcsville, Timmsvale, Anthony, Entertainopolis, Landish, Konner, Plains Hill, Cave City, Pine Oaks, Bown, Orange Creek, Beika, Keolloseu, Aelbeageu, Arktuis Vill, White Sand Harbor, Willieoseu, Frost Woods, StoneHammer Vill, Dragon Fangs Vill, Lupes Town, Gothsville, Eastport, Wolf City and Toadstool.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The state where there are many criminal and supernatural occurrences.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} it's the city first appeared in the novel ''Dead or Alive: Northtown: Chapter 1 - Welcome to Northtown, North Washington'' and finally appeared in ''Dead or Alive 7''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Unnamed U.S. states====\n{{Original research|section|date = May 2014}}\n* '''Cherokee State''' appears on the license plates on the sitcom ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]''; this is likely intended to be a [[List of U.S. state and territory nicknames|state nickname]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n* '''Eagle State''' likewise appears on yes on the television series ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n* [[Hooterville]], claimed in an episode of ''[[Green Acres]]'' \"A Home Isn't Built in a Day\" (S02 E11) to be a state named after '''Rutherford B.

In the ''[[Green Acres]]'' episode \"One of Our Assemblymen is Missing\" (S01 E06) Oliver Douglas visits the unnamed state's governor, who presents him with a souvenir of \"The Kangaroo State\", a toy kangaroo. However, ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'' and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' place Hooterville in Missouri.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n* '''Sideburn State''' appears on license plates on the television series ''[[The Adventures of Pete & Pete]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n* '''Sill.''' is the abbreviation for the state containing Lichfield in the works of [[James Branch Cabell]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n* '''[[Springfield's State (The Simpsons)|Unnamed State]]''' in ''The Simpsons'' contains [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#Shelbyville|Shelbyville]], and [[Capital City (The Simpsons)|Capitol City]] from ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Producer/director [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]] once unofficially named Springfield's setting as being in the fictional state of '''North Takoma'''. In the episode, \"Duffless\", [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]'s driver's license states that the postal abbreviation of their home state is \"NT\". In [[Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington]], there is a montage with essayists from different states presenting their work, while the camera pans over a U.S. map. When the map moves to Springfield for Lisa's contribution, we can see the abbreviation \"NT\" over the state that Springfield is in. In ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' (2007), [[Ned Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] are at the top of a mountain, where Flanders states you can see the four states that border Springfield: [[Ohio]], [[Nevada]], [[Maine]] and [[Kentucky]]. In the episode \"Bart vs. Lisa vs. The Third Grade\", it is stated that the state bird is the pot-bellied finch, the state pasta is futicelli, and the state flag is a Confederate flag rising above an ocean (an embarrassment considering this state was Northern). The state practices capital punishment.\n*'''Unnamed State''' in [[Joe Klein (journalist)|Joe Klein]]'s 1996 [[Primary Colors (novel)|novel]] and 1998 film ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'', also referred to in the sequel ''The Running Mate'' (2000), is a small southern state and home to Governor Jack Stanton (D), whose hometown is Grace Junction. Its capital is Mammoth Falls. Unnamed State is allegorical to [[Arkansas]], and Jack Stanton represents Arkansas Governor [[Bill Clinton]].\n*'''Unnamed State''' in [[Joe Klein (journalist)|Joe Klein]]'s novel ''The Running Mate'' (2000) is a Midwestern state and the home state of Senator Charlie Martin (D). Des Pointe is the state capital, largest city and hometown of Senator Martin, but many other locations in the state are mentioned. Industrial centers are Port Sallesby and Singer Rapids. Stated to have 53 counties. Charlie Martin is partially based on [[Nebraska]] Senator [[Bob Kerrey]], but Nebraska and several other Midwestern states are mentioned separately, leaving the identity of Martin's home state unclear\n*'''Unnamed State''', in [[Sinclair Lewis]]' novel ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' (1935), is a Western state and home state of dictatorial President Berzelius \"Buzz\" Windrip. Windrip's secretary and chief assistant Lee Sarason is described as having been, at the beginning of Windrip's rise, managing editor of the most widely circulated paper in this state's region.\n\n===Alternative representations of The United States===\n\n====51st state====\n{{further|51st state}}\n\"51st state\" (and related terms) has been used in books and film, usually in a negative sense:\n*In ''[[Americathon]]'' (1979), set in a fictional 1998, Britain (renamed as Limeyland) has become the 57th state, and the logo of the [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] grocery chain hangs on the [[Palace of Westminster]].\n*In the alternative universe of Alan Moore's graphic novel ''[[Watchmen]]'', the Vietnam War ends with the conquest of the North and annexation of a united Vietnam as the 51st state.\n*In the novel ''51st State'' (1998) by [[Peter Preston]], Britain leaves the European Union and becomes the 51st state of the United States.\n*In ''[[The Light of Other Days]]'' (2000), a novel by [[Arthur C.

It is a slave army with trappings of foreign-conscripted Roman legionaries during the late empire. All military, no civilian, and with none of the supporting civilian culture. It appears only in ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]''.\n\n:*The '''New California Republic''' ('''NCR''') is a federal presidential republic founded in New California by Aradesh.

This nation is actually closer to a [[Micronation]], because since on-off monarchies and republics with an [[Oligarchy|only family]] control it, and they only had one citizen working as a teacher or merchant (optional) during the game. This \"Nation\" only appears in [[Fallout 3]].\n\n:*'''The Free Economic Zone of New Vegas''' is a faction led by Robert House in New Vegas.

As wave of secessionist sentiment rises in America; the governor of California declares home rule and secedes from the Union on April 15, 2013. Texas follows a few days later, taking neighboring states with it and re-forming the Republic of Texas. Other factions form in the following months, and by 2014, all hopes for a peaceful resolution are gone, and the [[Second American Civil War]] begins.\n*'''Countries in [[Jericho (2006 TV series)|''Jericho'']]'''\n\n:*'''Allied States of America:''' A country in the television series ''[[Jericho (2006 TV series)|Jericho]]'' that forms after nuclear weapons are detonated in many of the [[United States of America|United States]]' major cities.

Many states were humorously respelled (such as \"eHIO\" for Ohio). The map also showed two new states: [[Pennsylvania]] being divided into the '''Penn Republic''' and '''Sylvania''', parodying the breakup of [[Czechoslovakia]] into the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]. Other humorous states, such as \"[[Virginia|East]] [[West Virginia]],\" are included. Most of the series takes place in [[New New York (fictional state)|New New York]], which the episode \"[[The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings]]\" confirms is the name of both the state and city.\n* The [[animated series]] ''[[The Flintstones]]'' presented a few \"prehistoric\" versions of modern-day states, including:\n** '''Texarock''': A prehistoric version of [[Texas]] (though the name \"Texas\" was also used interchangeably).\n** '''Arkanstone''': A prehistoric version of [[Arkansas]]; the former home of various [[hillbilly]] ancestors of [[Fred Flintstone]], as well as their rivals, the Hatrock family.

Michigan is separated into two administrative regions, with the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]] belonging to Ameritech, and the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] belonging to the North Central region. [[Alaska]] is mentioned as never having been pacified, requiring continued engagement by Soviet troops, and there are pockets of armed resistance in the [[Rocky Mountains]] and in West Virginia. There is no mention of what happened to [[Hawaii]] or to [[U.S. Territories]] such as [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]], and [[American Samoa]].\n\n* '''Coalition States''': a [[Fascism|fascist]] [[empire]] founded upon the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] ruins of the [[Midwestern United States|American Midwest]] in the ''[[Rifts (role-playing game)|Rifts]]'' [[role-playing game]].<ref>{{cite book | first1 = K. | last1 = Siembieda | authorlink1 = Kevin Siembieda | first2 = C. | last2 = Bellaire | first3 = S. | last3 = Therrien | first4 = T. | last4 = Ward | first5 = E. | last5 = Wujcik | authorlink5 = Erick Wujcik | title = Rifts Role-Playing Game, Ultimate Edition |date=August 2005 | publisher = [[Palladium Books]] | location = [[Taylor, Michigan|Taylor, MI]] | isbn = 1-57457-150-8 | pages = 24\u201331 | lastauthoramp = y}}</ref>\n* '''[[The Alteration]]''', written by [[Kingsley Amis]], set in an alternate universe where the [[Protestant Reformation]] never occurred owing to the prevention of [[Henry VIII]]'s succession to the English throne and the ascension to the Papacy of both [[Martin Luther]] and [[Thomas More]]; by 1976, Catholicism and the Papacy dominate most of the Western World. During the course of the book, a number of countries and territories are mentioned.\n:* '''Republic of New England''' \u2013 the breakaway country which is the greatest extent to which Schismatic theology has spread. It includes such locations as Cramneria, Hussville, Waldsdenia, Arnoldstown and Wycliffe City. A 'First Citizen' acts as the secular head ([[Joseph Rudyard Kipling]] is mentioned as being 'First Citizen between 1914 and 1918) and the Archpresbytor of Arnoldstown acts as the head of the church. New England is scientifically more advanced and culturally freer than the Papal Realms (having invented heavier-than-air flight and allowing the performance of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays) but practices a harsh penal system and a system of [[apartheid]] between whites and Native Americans.\n:* '''[[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]''' \u2013 Mentioned as having fought a war against New England circa 1848. It is not mentioned whether it is a district of [[New France]] or an independent country.\n:* '''Mexico''' \u2013 Mentioned as having fought a war against New England circa 1848. Mexico is an independent empire existing alongside [[New Spain]].\n:* '''Quebec''' \u2013 A French colony.\n:* '''Florida''' \u2013 A Spanish colony.\n:* '''New Muscovy''' \u2013 A colony of [[Muscovy]], analogous with [[Russian America|Alaska]].\n\nA novel-within-a-novel is mentioned, an alternate version of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s [[The Man in the High Castle]] depicting an alternate reality where the Protestant Reformation occurred. In 1848, England's American colonies revolt and win their independence, going on to conquer all of North America except for New Muscovy and Spanish Florida.\n\n* '''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]''', written by [[Margaret Atwood]], is set during an indeterminate point in the then future (approximately 2005, the book having been published in 1985). It is set primarily in the Christian fundamentalist theonomy of the Republic of Gilead. In the novel, the only given details of its territorial extent are its setting in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], the African-American 'National Homelands' located in the Midwest and the 'Colonies' (assorted agricultural districts and areas of fatal pollution worked by 'Unwomen').\n\nIn the [[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|television series]], however, the Republic of Gilead is shown via a map to occupy the former continental United States minus territories held by rebel militias. A rump United States exists, consisting of the extraterritorial states of Hawaii and Alaska (the capital being relocated to [[Anchorage]]) and an American diaspora in Canada; the new United States flag shows forty-eight of the fifty stars in its blue canton as white outlines, presumably representing those states lost to Gilead.\n\n* '''[[The Difference Engine]]''', co-authored by [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling|Bruce Stirling]], is set in an alternate 1855 where the timeline diverged in 1824 with [[Charles Babbage]]'s completion of his Difference Engine. The information technology revolution occurs in the Victorian Era and the British Empire is the most powerful on Earth.\n\nThe British Empire interfered in North American affairs, causing the United States to fragment in order to prevent it from becoming a world power. The following nations are mentioned.\n\n:* '''The United States''' \u2013 The rump state left after fragmentation.\n:* '''The Confederate States'''\n:* '''Manhattan Commune'''\n:* '''Republic of California'''\n:* '''Republic of Texas''' \u2013 [[Sam Houston]] appears in the novel as the exile Texian President.\n:* '''British North America''' \u2013 This is slighter large than in reality.\n:* '''Russian America'''\n:* '''Mexico''' \u2013 Under the occupation of the [[Second French Empire]].\n:* '''Terra Nullis''' \u2013 This consists mostly of the [[Missouri Territory]] and is ruled by different Native American nations.\n\n* '''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]''', a retro-futuristic United States setting influenced by the post-war culture of 1950s America, and its combination of hope for the promises of technology and lurking fear of nuclear annihilation. Since the end of The Great War, the United States ultimately dissolves, with various territories broadly referred as the \"Wasteland\" or simply the \"Wastes\".\n\n:*The '''Brotherhood of Steel''' is a neo-knightly order founded by deserters of the U.S. Armed Forces shortly before the Great War. They are probably the most widely-spread faction in post-war America, however many Brotherhood divisions have differing ideologies and practices, due to this they vary from location such as the Mojave Chapter and the East Coast Brotherhood. They have appeared in every Fallout game to date, and are the main focus of ''[[Fallout: Tactics]]'' and ''[[Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel]]''.\n\n:*The '''Enclave''' is a secretive, militaristic organization established after the Great War, founded by descendants of the pre-War United States government and its military-industrial complex. They consider themselves the legal continuation of the U.S. government and continuously plot their resurgence. They are the main antagonists of ''[[Fallout 2]]'', ''[[Fallout 3]]'', and its add-on ''[[Fallout 3 downloadable content|Broken Steel]]''. Remnants of the Enclave's west coast division appear as a faction in ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' and the Enclave are mentioned by a former Enclave soldier turned follower for the Children of Atom in Fallout 4's add-on ''[[Fallout 4: Far Harbor|Far Harbor]]''.\n\n:*'''The Commonwealth''' is what is left of the pre-Great War State of Massachusetts in New England Commonwealth of the United States in the alternate history of the Fallout universe. Most of it is a \"war-ravaged quagmire of violence and despair\" like much of the rest of the former United States, but it is also where Boston is located. It was first mentioned in ''[[Fallout 3]]'' and later appeared in ''[[Fallout 4]]''.\n\n:*'''Caesar's Legion''' is an autocratic, ultra-reactionary, utilitarian slaver army founded in 2247 by Edward Sallow and Joshua Graham. It is largely inspired and partially based on the ancient Roman Empire, though it isn't the Roman Empire or the Roman Republic or even its military, the Legion. It is a slave army with trappings of foreign-conscripted Roman legionaries during the late empire. All military, no civilian, and with none of the supporting civilian culture. It appears only in ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]''.\n\n:*The '''New California Republic''' ('''NCR''') is a federal presidential republic founded in New California by Aradesh. Comprising five contiguous states, territories and holdings in pre-War regions in Nevada, Arizona, Oregon, and parts of Mexico, the Republic dedicates itself to the values of the old world: [[democracy]], [[liberty]], and the [[rule of law]]. It was founded in 2186, is mentioned in ''[[Fallout 3]]'', and appears in ''[[Fallout 2]]'' & ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]''.\n\n:*'''Shi''' is a post-apocalyptic nation that is against post-war politics, and uses some of the Chinese culture, such as their ancestors' customs, clothing, language and demeanor. The younger generations, however, seem to rely more on the surviving popular culture interpretations of Chinese culture (such as kung-fu holovideos), rather than actual cultural traditions. It only appears in ''[[Fallout 2]]'' and flashback in memories by remains of Kellogg's brain ''[[Fallout 4]]''.\t\n\n:*'''Republic of Dave''' (formerly '''Kingdom of Tom''', '''Kingdom of Larry''', the '''Republic of Stevie-Ray''', '''Billsylvania''', and the '''New Republic of Stevie-Ray''') is a small farming settlement in the far northeast corner of the Capital Wasteland ([[Fallout 3]]) that is considered by its close-knit inhabitants to be a sovereign nation-state. This nation is actually closer to a [[Micronation]], because since on-off monarchies and republics with an [[Oligarchy|only family]] control it, and they only had one citizen working as a teacher or merchant (optional) during the game. This \"Nation\" only appears in [[Fallout 3]].\n\n:*'''The Free Economic Zone of New Vegas''' is a faction led by Robert House in New Vegas. Although it is formally founded if House establishes sovereignty over the Mojave, in practice, it exists in a practical capacity throughout Mr House's rule in New Vegas.\n\n*'''[[Shattered Union]]''', on Inauguration Day in Washington, D.C., a low-yield tactical nuclear weapon is detonated, destroying most of the city and effectively wiping out the presidential line of succession. The [[European Union]] sends peacekeepers to the New York and Washington metropolitan areas to secure international interests, while the [[Russian Federation]] invades and occupies Alaska (under the pretense of \"expanded humanitarian operations\"). As wave of secessionist sentiment rises in America; the governor of California declares home rule and secedes from the Union on April 15, 2013. Texas follows a few days later, taking neighboring states with it and re-forming the Republic of Texas. Other factions form in the following months, and by 2014, all hopes for a peaceful resolution are gone, and the [[Second American Civil War]] begins.\n*'''Countries in [[Jericho (2006 TV series)|''Jericho'']]'''\n\n:*'''Allied States of America:''' A country in the television series ''[[Jericho (2006 TV series)|Jericho]]'' that forms after nuclear weapons are detonated in many of the [[United States of America|United States]]' major cities.  Its capital is [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], and it controls all of the states west of the Mississippi River, with the exception of [[Texas]].\n\n:*'''Republic of Texas:''' A country that was formerly the state of [[Texas]] <nowiki/>and has the same borders.  Its capital is [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] because [[Dallas]] and [[Houston]] were destroyed.\n\n:*'''United States of America:''' A country in the television series ''[[Jericho (2006 TV series)|Jericho]]''.  It is only a fictional country because it only rules over the states east of the Mississippi River.  Its capital is [[Columbus, Ohio]].\n<gallery>\nFile:Jericho flag (TV series).svg|'''Flag of the Allied States of America'''\nFile:Flag of the United States (Pantone).svg|'''Flag of the United States of America (Same flag the real [[United States of America|United States]] currently uses).'''\nFile:Flag of Texas.svg|'''Flag of the Republic of Texas (Same flag the real [[Texas|State of Texas]] currently uses).'''\nFile:ASA-USA Jericho Map.PNG|'''Map with the three countries:<br />{{red|Allied States of America}}<br />{{blue|United States of America}}<br />{{magenta|Republic of Texas}}'''\n</gallery>\n\n==Other collections of independent states==\n[[File:Correspondance entre les actuels \u00c9tats am\u00e9ricains et les Districts de Panem (Hunger Games).png|thumb|496px|right|Assumed location of Panem's Districts in comparison with the current administrative divisions of the United States; the rise of the oceans and the overflow beyond the American borders not being taken in account. \n{{Legend|#7F00FF|The Capitol}}\n{{Legend|#FFFF00|District 1 (luxury items)}}\n{{Legend|#E73E01|District 2 (masonry, weaponry, law enforcement units)}}\n{{Legend|#0000FF|District 3 (electronics)}}\n{{Legend|#007FFF|District 4 (pisciculture, commercial fishing)}}\n{{Legend|#C8AD7F|District 5 (hydroelectric power)}}\n{{Legend|#74D0F1|District 6 (transportation)}}\n{{Legend|#5B3B11|District 7 (forestry, lumber)}}\n{{Legend|#FFC0CB|District 8 (textiles)}}\n{{Legend|#FFD700|District 9 (agriculture [grain])}}\n{{Legend|#800000|District 10 (agriculture [livestock])}}\n{{Legend|#008000|District 11 (agriculture [fruits and vegetables])}}\n{{Legend|#000000|District 12 (mining [coal])}}\n{{Legend|#C2F732|District 13 (mining [graphite], military technology, nuclear technology)}}]]\n* ''[[The Hunger Games]]'' takes place in the fictional nation of ''Panem'', which has replaced the [[21st century]] [[North America]]n nations at an unspecified future time after a series of ecological disasters and a great war.{{sfnp|Collins|2008|p=18}} The name ''Panem'' comes from the [[Latin]] word for ''bread''.{{sfnp|Collins|2010|p=223}} Panem consists of a Capitol city located in the [[Rocky Mountains]],{{sfnp|Collins|2008|p=41}} surrounded by thirteen outlying Districts. The government is a [[totalitarian]] dictatorship similar to [[Roman Empire|ancient Rome]], a [[police state]] in which the Districts are subservient to the Capitol, expected to provide economic goods in exchange for protection provided by \"Peacekeepers\".\n* The [[comic book]] ''[[Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew]]'' took place in the \"United Species of America\" on the parallel world of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-C]]; the comic featured several analogs of real US states, including:\n** '''Taxes''', nicknamed \"the Lone Stork State\"; an analogue of [[Texas]]. Taxes was the home of [[supervillain]] Armordillo, as well as the cities of \"[[Houston, Texas|Hogston]]\" and \"[[San Antonio, Texas|San Antoadio]].\"\n** '''Kornsas''', in the midwest; an analogue of [[Kansas]].\n** '''Califurnia''', on the western coast of the U.S.; an analogue of [[California]]. This state featured the cities \"[[San Bernardino, California|Saint Bernardino]],\" \"[[Beverly Hills, California|Beaverly Hills]],\" \"[[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Follywood]],\" and \"[[Los Angeles, California|Los Antelopes]].\" The Zoo Crew's headquarters was located in Follywood; the city was also the home of team members [[Yankee Poodle]] and [[Rubberduck]].\n* The episode of the animated series ''[[Futurama]]'' entitled \"[[Bendin' in the Wind]]\" showed some maps of the US in the year 3000. Many states were humorously respelled (such as \"eHIO\" for Ohio). The map also showed two new states: [[Pennsylvania]] being divided into the '''Penn Republic''' and '''Sylvania''', parodying the breakup of [[Czechoslovakia]] into the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]. Other humorous states, such as \"[[Virginia|East]] [[West Virginia]],\" are included. Most of the series takes place in [[New New York (fictional state)|New New York]], which the episode \"[[The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings]]\" confirms is the name of both the state and city.\n* The [[animated series]] ''[[The Flintstones]]'' presented a few \"prehistoric\" versions of modern-day states, including:\n** '''Texarock''': A prehistoric version of [[Texas]] (though the name \"Texas\" was also used interchangeably).\n** '''Arkanstone''': A prehistoric version of [[Arkansas]]; the former home of various [[hillbilly]] ancestors of [[Fred Flintstone]], as well as their rivals, the Hatrock family. Bears a (probably coincidental) similarity to the name of the Arkenstone.\n** '''New Rock''': A prehistoric version of [[New York (state)|New York]].\n* The ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' video game franchise has featured a number of fictional states:\n** '''Alderney''', a parallel of [[New Jersey]], neighboring Liberty City. It contains the city New Guernsey.\n** '''Liberty City (also known as Liberty City State)''', based on [[New York (state)|New York]] and appears in [[Grand Theft Auto III]] and [[Grand Theft Auto IV]], albeit in different universes (GTA III era and GTA IV era).\n** '''San Andreas''' has similarities to [[California]] and [[Nevada]]: [[Los Santos (Grand Theft Auto)|Los Santos]] and San Fierro are based on [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]], respectively, while Las Venturas is a version of [[Las Vegas]]. The name is derived from the [[San Andreas Fault]].\n* The video game ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' features two fictional U.S. states and one fictional Mexican state:\n** '''West Elizabeth''': a Plains state, based mostly on [[Colorado]]. It contains the city of Blackwater.\n** '''New Austin''': a Southwestern state, portrayed as a rough combination of [[Texas]] and [[Nevada]] with areas resembling the Southeast and the Northeast. It contains the cities of Thieves' Landing and Armadillo and borders the fictional Mexican state of '''Nuevo Paraiso''', which itself contains the cities of Chuparosa and Escalera.\n* In [[Orson Scott Card]]'s ''[[The Tales of Alvin Maker]]'' series, the United States exists as a much smaller nation, between the area of [[New England]] and the Crown Colonies which extend from roughly Virginia south to Georgia. The nation has a significantly higher Iroquois and Dutch influence than in the real world. Member states include:\n** '''Irrakwa'''\n** '''New Holland'''\n** '''[[New Orange]]'''\n** '''[[New Sweden]]'''\n** '''[[Pennsylvania]]'''\n** '''Suskwahenny'''\n* Barry Shils' 1991 film [[Motorama (film)|''Motorama'']] contains a number of fictional states, which appear to be in the southwestern US. Three of these ([[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer]], [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen]], and [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex]]) are counties in [[New Jersey]]. In order of appearance, they are:\n** '''Mercer''' ''(nickname: The Frontier State)''\n** '''South Lydon''' ''(nickname: The Lonesome State)''\n** '''Tristana''' ''(nickname: The Green State)''\n** '''Bergen''' ''(nickname: The Long State)''\n** '''Vetner''' (no nickname given)\n** '''Essex''' ''(nickname: The Last State)''\n* State N\u00ba51. In John Katzenbach's novel \"Games of Wits\", this state is ruled by a dictatorship. This state is described as square in shape and includes the territory of several other states, including:\n**[[Nevada]]\n**[[Utah]]\n**[[Oregon]]\n**[[Idaho]]\n**[[California]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[51st state]]\n* [[Jesusland map|The United States of Canada]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |last1=Lammle |first1=Rob |title=The U.S. Map With Only 38 States |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/57444/map-only-38-states |website=Mental Floss |language=en |date=June 23, 2014}}\n\n{{Fiction navbox}}\n{{USStateLists}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional states of the United States| ]]\n[[Category:Fictional North American countries|U.

[[Iowa]] voters elected state senators in 35 of the state senate's 50 districts--all 25 of the odd-numbered seats were up for regularly-scheduled elections and, due to the oddities of redistricting following the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]], 10 of the even-numbered sears were up as well. State senators serve four-year terms in the [[Iowa State Senate]], with half of the seats ''traditionally'' up for election each cycle.\n\nThe primary election on June 4, 2002 determined which candidates appeared on the November 5, 2002 general election ballot.

[[Iowa]] voters elected state senators in 35 of the state senate's 50 districts--all 25 of the odd-numbered seats were up for regularly-scheduled elections and, due to the oddities of redistricting following the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]], 10 of the even-numbered sears were up as well. State senators serve four-year terms in the [[Iowa State Senate]], with half of the seats ''traditionally'' up for election each cycle.\n\nThe primary election on June 4, 2002 determined which candidates appeared on the November 5, 2002 general election ballot.

On March 12, 2002 a special election in [[Iowa Senate, District 10|district 10]] resulted in [[Amanda Ragan]] flipping a seat in favor of the [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]]. Therefore, on election day in November 2002, [[Iowa Republican Party|Republicans]] controlled 29 seats and [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]] had 21.\n\nTo reclaim control of the chamber from [[Iowa Republican Party|Republicans]], the [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]] needed to net 5 Senate seats. \n\n[[Iowa Republican Party|Republicans]] maintained control of the [[Iowa State Senate]] following the 2002 general election with the balance of power remaining unchanged with [[Iowa Republican Party|Republicans]] holding 29 seats and [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]] having 21 seats. \n\n==Summary of Results==\n*NOTE: 15 of the even-numbered districts did not have elections in 2002 so they are not listed here.\n*Also note, an asterisk (*) after a Senator's name indicates they were an incumbent re-elected, but to a new district number due to redistricting. \n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:14px;\"\n! class=\"unsortable\"| [[Iowa State Senate|State Senate]] District\n! class=\"unsortable\"|[[Incumbent]]\n! colspan=\"2\"| Party\n! class=\"unsortable\"|Elected Senator\n! colspan=\"2\"| Party\n|-\n| [https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/DMP/924811.pdf 1st]\n| Steven D.
