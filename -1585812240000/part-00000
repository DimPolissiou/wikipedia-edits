It was founded in the 15th century, and reached its peak in the 18th century, when it briefly became the hegemon of South Sulawesi replacing [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]]. Wajoq retained its independence until it was [[South Sulawesi expeditions of 1905|subdued in the early 20th century]] by the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]]. It continued to exist in some form up to mid-20th century, when the self-governing entity was transformed into [[Wajo Regency]] in the newly independent [[Republic of Indonesia]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history (c. 1400\u20131582) ===\nThe emergence of Wajoq and other interior polities of South Sulawesi is associated with the major [[intensive farming|agricultural expansion]] and [[centralized government|political centralization]] in the 14th century, which was encouraged by an increase in external demand for South Sulawesi rice.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=100\u2013103}} Population rose as the formerly common [[Slash-and-burn|swidden]] agriculture was increasingly replaced with intensive [[wet rice]] cultivation. Throughout the interior of the peninsula, forests were [[deforestation|cleared]] and new settlements were founded.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=98\u2013100}} The people of Wajoq themselves associate the origin of their polity with migrations and establishment of new settlements. Wajorese text ''[[Lontaraq Sukkuqna Wajoq]]'' (''Complete Chronicle of Wajoq''), for example, recounts the story of a Bugis noble who, on a hunting expedition, found \"an area with wide fields, thick forests with wild boars, deer, and buffalo, and numerous lakes replete with fish\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=27}} He then decided to settle and founded the polity of Cinnotabiq,{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=348, 359}} which transformed into Wajoq in the early 15th century.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=24}}\n\nTradition mantains that the name \"Wajoq\" came from the ''bajoq'' tree{{efn|Commonly identified as a ''[[Macaranga]]'' species ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=403}}).}}, under which the then Cinnotabiq ruler La Tenribali{{efn|Also known in several manuscripts as La Tenriba or La Tenribabbareng ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=399}}).}} supposedly concluded a [[social contract]] with the three chiefs of Boliq, whose communities formed the core of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=25, 114}} La Tenribali was appointed to reign over Boliq lands and thus became the first ''batara'' (ruler, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"sky\") of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}} The third ''batara'' of Wajoq, La Pateddungi To Samallangiq, was forced to [[abdicate]] by his people, reportedly because of his immoral actions. He was later [[assassin]]ated by a Wajorese noble.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=478}} Wajoq then underwent a constitutional change, after which a governing council was established. This council included and was presided by an elective principal ruler, who from then on would be known as the ''arung matoa'' (lit. \"senior lord\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=174}}). La Pal\u00e9wo To Palippu from B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola was chosen by the council as the first ''arung matoa'' of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=479\u2013482}}\n\nDuring the reign of the fourth ''arung matoa'', [[La Tadampareq|La Tadampareq Puang ri Maggalatung]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1491\u20131521{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=575}}), Wajoq became one of the major Bugis polities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=112\u2013113}} By the turn of the 16th century, Wajoq had been able to secure a relatively higher standing in its relationship with the neighboring [[Luwu|Luwuq]], which was a powerful polity in South Sulawesi during the 15th century, and presumably was regarded as Wajoq's overlord.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=21}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Together with Luwuq, Wajoq won a war against the nearby polity of [[Sidenreng|Sid\u00e9nr\u00e9ng]] in [[Ajatappareng]], forcing the latter to cede its territories north of the central lakes to Wajoq.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Wajoq under La Tadampareq also absorbed the remnants of what might have been the core territories of Cina, another influential early Bugis polity.{{sfnp|Caldwell|Wellen|2017|pp=306, 319}} Balance of power in the region further shifted in the early 16th century when [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]], a Bugis polity south of Wajoq, emerged victorious against Luwuq, and thus assumed a paramount position in the eastern part of the peninsula.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=22}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=114}} At the same time, the [[Makassar people|Makassar]] twin kingdoms of [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa]] and [[Kingdom of Tallo|Talloq]] to the west also [[Early history of Gowa and Talloq#Gowa and Talloq from 1511 to 1565|started to expand their power]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=24}} Early in the century, Gowa had cooperated with Bon\u00e9 in wars against Luwuq and Wajoq,{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=23}} but by the mid of the century their struggles for [[hegemony]] made Gowa and Bon\u00e9 clashed against each other. By this time, Wajoq had also fallen under Gowa's sphere of influence, and supported Gowa in a war against Bon\u00e9 in the 1560s.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=116, 131\u2013132}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=30}}\n\n=== The ''Tellumpocco'' alliance and the rise of Gowa-Talloq (1582\u20131660) ===\n[[File:South Sulawesi circa 1600.svg|thumb|upright=1|Political division of southern Sulawesi in around 1590]]\n\nThe continued rise of Gowa and its harsh treatment of its Bugis subordinates Wajoq and [[Soppeng|Sopp\u00e9ng]] prompted the latter two to sign the Treaty of Timurung, a mutual defense pact initiated by Bon\u00e9 in 1582.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=132\u2013133}} The relationship between these three allied Bugis polities, also known as the ''[[Tellumpocco]]'' (\"Three Powers\", lit. \"Three Peaks\"), is defined as that of brothers, with Bon\u00e9 acting as the elder, Wajoq the middle, and Sopp\u00e9ng the younger one. It sought to reclaim the autonomy of these Bugis lands, and to stop Gowa's expansionism.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=249}} Gowa's subsequent campaigns against Wajoq in 1582 and 1590 as well as against Bon\u00e9 in 1585 and 1588 were all successfully repulsed by the alliance, or in the case of 1590 campaign, abandoned following the murder of Gowa's ruler [[Tunijalloq]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=31}}\n\nNevertheless, by the early 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had succeeded in becoming the most dominant powers in the South Sulawesi peninsula as they bolstered international trade and promoted the new faith of [[Islam]].{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29, 177}} Between 1608 and 1611, Gowa waged successful campaigns throughout South Sulawesi, forcing Sopp\u00e9ng to embrace Islam in 1609, Wajoq in 1610, and Bon\u00e9 in 1611.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=33}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=136\u2013137}} Thereafter, the ''Tellumpocco'' surrendered the control of their foreign affairs to Gowa, although they were allowed to retain the alliance and still preserve considerable autonomy within their own domains.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}} This arrangement proved to be quite successful to win the support of the Bugis. Wajoq in particular grew increasingly loyal to Gowa. The ''arung matoa'' To Mappassaungng\u00e9 (r. 1627\u20131628{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=576}}) even offered to guard the Gowa capital when its ruler was off for an expedition, despite he was not being obliged to do so.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nWajoq entered another conflict when the ruler of Bon\u00e9, [[La Maddaremmeng]] (r. 1626\u20131643), whether for political or religious reasons, attacked and pillaged P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, one of Wajoq's constituent communities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=40}}{{efn|La Maddaremmeng had previously became a subject of controversy, as he had enforced a stricter interpretation of Islam to his people. He also went to abolish non-hereditary slavery in accordance to his belief, and tried to convince the other ''Tellumpocco'' members to follow his steps. This was not received favorably by Gowa, who viewed Bon\u00e9's attempt to spread its religious influence as a direct challenge to its hegemony over South Sulawesi ({{harvnb|Wellen|2014|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}; {{harvnb|Pelras|1996|p=142}}).}} As La Maddaremmeng refused to compensate for the goods seized in P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, Wajoq and Bon\u00e9 went to war against each other.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} Gowa and Sopp\u00e9ng sided with Wajoq in this conflict, and the joint forces succeeded in [[Battle of Passemp\u00e9|defeating Bon\u00e9 in October 1643]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=142}} Bon\u00e9 was harshly punished by being made a vassal of Gowa,{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} with a Bugis noble installed as a [[regent]] responsible to a Makassar lord. A subsequent rebellion led by La Maddaremmeng's brother was also quashed, and Bon\u00e9's status was further degraded to that of a \"slave\" (i.e. a colony), while its nobles were forcibly relocated to Gowa.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=142\u2013143}} Several contested territories held by Bon\u00e9 were given to Wajoq, and a large number of people from Bon\u00e9 were forced into [[Corv\u00e9e|unpaid labor]] in Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29\u201330}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=42\u201343}} This humiliation entrenched a feeling of resentment among the people of Bon\u00e9 towards both Gowa and Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=43}}\n\n=== Makassar War and Wajorese migrations (1660\u20131730) ===\nBy the second quarter of the 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had became the most politically and economically powerful polities in eastern Indonesia. The twin kingdoms' attempt to retain their hegemony brought them to a conflict with the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), which wanted to monopolize the [[spice trade]] in the [[Moluccas]].{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=45\u201347}} In 1660, the Dutch attacked Gowa and managed to seize the fort of Paqnakkukang.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=49}} Gowa then forced its vassals to provide labor to build military constructions in anticipation of further conflict, which ultimately resulted in a rebellion led by the Bon\u00e9 noble [[Arung Palakka]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=50\u201352}} However, his attempt to revive the ''Tellumpocco'' alliance failed, as Wajoq refused to break its treaty with Gowa to join forces with the rebels.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=54}}<!-- According to the historian [[Leonard Andaya]], Wajoq's decision can be explained by the fact that its recent experiences with Gowa were much more positive than those with Bon\u00e9.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=54\u201355}} In the most recent memory of the Wajorese, it was Bon\u00e9, not Gowa, which invaded their country. Wajoq and Bon\u00e9 also had frequent disputes over territorial boundaries and the allegiance of their vassals.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=54\u201355}}{{efn|system of vassals...}} On the other hand, Wajoq's relationship with Gowa had been more friendly in the preceding years; Wajoq was one of Gowa's most trusted vassals, with the ''arung matoa'' [[La Tenrilai To Senngeng]] (r. 1658\u20131670) had even been married to a daughter of Gowa ruler [[Hasanuddin of Gowa|Hasanuddin]] (r. 1653\u20131669).{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37, 54\u201355}}--> Lacking enough support, the rebellion was successfully quelled by Gowa and Wajoq forces, driving Arung Palakka to escape to [[Buton]], and later, to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], seeking aid from the VOC.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=56\u201359, 66}}\n\nDuring the [[Makassar War]] (1666\u20131669), Wajoq fiercely supported Gowa against the alliance of the VOC and local forces from Bon\u00e9 and elsewhere led by Arung Palakka. Even after the fall of Gowa's court Sombaopu and the formal surrender of Gowa and Talloq, the ''arung matoa'' [[La Tenrilai To Sengngeng]] (r. 1658\u20131670) still refused to abide by the [[Treaty of Bungaya]] and continued to resist the Dutch and Bon\u00e9 forces.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=31\u201332}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37, 124\u2013126, 138}} By mid-1670, Arung Palakka had launched a large-scale invasion of Wajoq.<!-- Along the way, several Wajoq's vassals deserted and joined Bon\u00e9 forces, bringing the total number of invading forces to around 40,000 people when it arrived to besiege Tosora, the walled capital city of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=138\u2013139}}--> Despite hard resistance from Wajorese defenders, the walled capital city of Tosora fell to the Bon\u00e9-led forces in December 1670. La Tenrilai was [[killed in action]], and his successor [[La Paliliq To Malu]] (r. 1670\u20131679) was forced to sign a treaty restricting Wajorese political, trade and military powers, in addition to the Treaty of Bungaya.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=33\u201335}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=140\u2013141}} In spite of Wajoq's surrender, it still faced harsh retribution from Arung Palakka and the people of Bon\u00e9. Many Wajorese were kidnapped and harassed or had their belongings seized.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=36}} Bon\u00e9 also annexed the coastal territories near the mouth of [[Walanae River|Cenrana River]], which was Wajoq's sole acess to the sea.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=143}} Wajoq's complains to the Dutch at Makassar regarding Bon\u00e9's arbitrary actions were given little attention. By this time, Arung Palakka had been sending soldiers to help the VOC in [[Trunajaya rebellion|a campaign in Java]], and the VOC did not want to risk severing their relationship with an important ally.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=37\u201338}}{{sfnp|Andaya|pp=142\u2013143, 190\u2013192, 205}}\n\nIt was these difficulties faced by the Wajorese in their homeland which prompted them to emigrate elsewhere.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=143}} While migration had always been an important part of Wajorese culture, it was particularly prominent in the aftermath of the Makassar War, when a large number of Wajorese migrants established themselves abroad in Makassar, eastern [[Borneo]], the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], and the [[Straits of Malacca]] area, among other places.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=143}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=38, 82}}{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}} These diaspora communities were connected to their homeland as well as to each other by familial, commercial, political and legal ties.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=82}} By the early 18th century, a sequence of Wajorese rulers had began to take advantage of these connections to revitalize their country. Several rulers ordered their people abroad to buy weapons to rearm Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=82}}{{sfnp|Duli|2010|pp=144\u2013145}} Attention was also given to commerce; one particular ''arung matoa'', [[La Tenriwerrung Puanna Sangngaji]] (r. 1711\u20131713), even proclaimed it as a moral duty, noting that the people of Wajoq \"could not 'stand upright' unless they sought riches\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=82}} His successor, [[La Sal\u00e9wangeng To Tenrirua]] (r. 1713\u20131736), actively supported international commerce in more practical ways.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=82\u201383}} He dredged the river that leads to the capital Tosora to ease access for large boats, strengthened local industries by requiring them to appoint political representatives known as ''akkajenangngeng'', created an official governmental post with the specific role of promoting trade, and set up a fund which can be used for investment on commerce and agriculture as well as for social security purposes.{{sfnp|Duli|2010|pp=144\u2013145}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=82\u201383}}\n\n=== Wajoq under La Maddukelleng (1730\u20131754) ===\n{{sect-stub|date=April 2020}}\nSince Arung Palakka's death in 1696, none of his successor was as capable as him in maintaining Bon\u00e9's hegemony over South Sulawesi. This allowed Wajorese trade to flourish without much restriction.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=30, 69}} Interaction between Wajorese diaspora communities and their homeland intensified, and it culminated in the 1730s when the exiled Wajorese [[La Maddukelleng]] came back to South Sulawesi.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=137}} At first, he and his followers raided several communities in the western part of the peninsula and in the islands near Makassar.{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|p=55}} In 1736, he assumed the leadership of P\u00e9n\u00e9ki (a constituent polity of Wajoq) and got involved in a confrontation with Bon\u00e9. Following a retaliatory invasion from Bon\u00e9, many Wajorese people came to support La Maddukelleng, and he assumed the position of ''arung matoa'' (r. 1736\u20131754{{efn|{{harvtxt|Noorduyn|1972|p=61}} dates his reign to 1737\u20131754, but according to {{harvtxt|Abidin|1985|p=577}} and {{harvtxt|Wellen|2014|p=145}}, he was appointed as the ''arung matoa'' of Wajoq on November 6, 1736.

These communities were related to each other as well as to the central government at Tosora in various ways, ranging from vassalage to alliance \"as between brothers\".{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=176\u2013177}} The polity of Wajoq was divided into three ''limpo'' or main districts, namely B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola, Tua, and Talotenreng, which represented its three original founding communities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|pp=49\u201350}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=177\u2013178}} Each ''limpo'' held power over several smaller communities that either chose to affiliate themselves with the said ''limpo'' or were conquered.{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|p=50}} Each of these communities had considerable freedom, with its own leader and customs. It can also switch allegiance between different states, and by doing so, both its people and its territory will be subject to the new state.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=22}}\n\nThe paramount ruler of Wajoq is titled ''arung matoa''.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=23}} In running the day-to-day administration of Wajoq, the ''arung matoa'' was assisted by three pairs of civilian and military leaders, each pair representing one of the three ''limpo''.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=482}}{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=245}} The civilian leader of a ''limpo'' was called a ''ranreng'' or regent, while the military leader was called a ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' or \"standard bearer\".{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=178}} The titles of the ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' were taken from the banner they carried: ''Pilla'' or \"Scarlet\" for B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola, ''Patola'' or \"Multi-colored\" for Talotenreng, and ''Cakkuridi'' or \"Yellow\" for Tua.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=23}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=485}} Each of the ''ranreng'' and  ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' were at least as powerful as the ''arung matoa''; together, these seven officials formed the state's highest governing body, known as ''Petta Wajoq''.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=23}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=178}}\n\nThe ''arung matoa'' was chosen among the \"white-blood\" or nobility class. The position of arung matoa cannot be held at once with another office. It also cannot be inherited and can only be held for life as long as the ruler was deemed fit for the position.{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=465, 535}} A ruler in precolonial South Sulawesi was expected to be subordinate to the state and the ''[[adat]]'' or customary law which delineates the autonomy of local communities; failure to do so may result in removal from office. The ''arung matoa'' La Samal\u00e9wa To Appakiung (r. 1612\u20131616), for example, was deposed by his people, reportedly because of his arbitrary actions.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=22}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=385}}\n\nThe central governing council of Wajoq consisted of 40 officials, collectively called the ''Arung Patampulu'' (lit. \"Forty Lords\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=165}}), of which the ''arung matoa'' was a member as well as the head.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=482}} The whole members only convened on certain occasions, including the election of a new ''arung matoa''.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=23, 175}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|p=51}}\n<!--\nThe power of ''Arung Patampulu'' is balanced by three non-noble officials known as ''punggawa'', who were elected among the elders of each district. ''Punggawa'' had considerable power... \n\n- Diaspora governmental structure (focus on Borneo and Makassar)...\n-->\n\n==Culture and society==\n{{see also|Bugis people}}\n{{sect-stub|date=April 2020}}\nWajorese texts often reiterate that \"the people of Wajoq are free\", and that their only master is the customary law, which is based on consensus. The concept of the \"freedoms of Wajoq\" included, among others: [[freedom of speech|freedom of expressing opinions]], freedom to act based on one's intention, [[freedom of movement]], [[freedom of contract]], and the freedom from unjust punishment.{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=148}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=481}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=433, 447\u2013448}} These \"freedoms\", however, had limitations and do not necessarily apply to the whole population.\n\nBugis women in the precolonial states of South Sulawesi were routinely involved in many aspects of the society. Women were also actively involved in the government. One 19th-century observer states that the women of South Sulawesi were commonly \"consulted by the men on all public affairs\" and were often \"raised to the throne, [even] when the monarchy is elective\".{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=250}} The British adventurer [[James Brooke]] (future [[Rajah of Sarawak]]), notes that at the time of his visit to Wajoq in 1840, four out of six members of Petta Ennengng\u00e9 were women, who frequently \"appear in public like the men; ride, rule, and visit even foreigners, without the knowledge or consent of their husbands.\"{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=250}}\n\n==Economy==\nWajoq was the source of most South Sulawesi overseas merchants between late 17th and late 19th centuries.{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=147}} Wajorese commerce extended as far as [[Sumatra]], [[Cambodia]], and [[New Guinea]].{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}}{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=147}} Throughout the Maritime Southeast Asia, Wajorese and other Bugis merchants acted as intermediaries between large and small trading nations.{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}} Wajorese trade flourished in part because of deliberate support from the government at Wajoq as well as from Wajorese communities abroad.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=67\u201368}} Leaders of Wajorese overseas communities regularly convened to advance their interest. One such conference in the early 18th century saw the codification of laws regulating Wajorese commerce and navigation, popularly called the Ammana Gappa's law code, after the then leader of the Wajorese community in Makassar. These laws set up frameworks for managing credit and debts as well as regulating other kinds of business relationships, providing ways to resolve conflict and giving Wajorese merchants advantages over merchants from other groups in Maritime Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=84, 91, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=64\u201365, 71}} Such a law code, according to historian Kathryn Wellen, is \"highly unusual, if not unique, for early modern insular Southeast Asia\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=84}}\n\nThe government financially supported Wajorese merchants by providing monetary loans, taken from the fund established by La Sal\u00e9wangeng. Borrowers were obliged to return the principals alongside parts of their profits. The profits would then be used to further Wajoq's interest, such as building armaments or renovating the state's mosque. This system allowed a large segment of Wajorese population to participate in commerce while also utilizing their economic power for the benefit of the society as a whole.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=82\u201383, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=76}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Early history of Gowa and

It was founded in the 15th century, and reached its peak in the 18th century, when it briefly became the hegemon of South Sulawesi replacing [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]]. Wajoq retained its independence until it was [[South Sulawesi expeditions of 1905|subdued in the early 20th century]] by the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]]. It continued to exist in some form up to mid-20th century, when the self-governing entity was transformed into [[Wajo Regency]] in the newly independent [[Republic of Indonesia]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history (c. 1400\u20131582) ===\nThe emergence of Wajoq and other interior polities of South Sulawesi is associated with the major [[intensive farming|agricultural expansion]] and [[centralized government|political centralization]] in the 14th century, which was encouraged by an increase in external demand for South Sulawesi rice.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=100\u2013103}} Population rose as the formerly common [[Slash-and-burn|swidden]] agriculture was increasingly replaced with intensive [[wet rice]] cultivation. Throughout the interior of the peninsula, forests were [[deforestation|cleared]] and new settlements were founded.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=98\u2013100}} The people of Wajoq themselves associate the origin of their polity with migrations and establishment of new settlements. Wajorese text ''[[Lontaraq Sukkuqna Wajoq]]'' (''Complete Chronicle of Wajoq''), for example, recounts the story of a Bugis noble who, on a hunting expedition, found \"an area with wide fields, thick forests with wild boars, deer, and buffalo, and numerous lakes replete with fish\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=27}} He then decided to settle and founded the polity of Cinnotabiq,{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=348, 359}} which transformed into Wajoq in the early 15th century.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=24}}\n\nTradition mantains that the name \"Wajoq\" came from the ''bajoq'' tree{{efn|Commonly identified as a ''[[Macaranga]]'' species ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=403}}).}}, under which the then Cinnotabiq ruler La Tenribali{{efn|Also known in several manuscripts as La Tenriba or La Tenribabbareng ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=399}}).}} supposedly concluded a [[social contract]] with the three chiefs of Boliq, whose communities formed the core of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=25, 114}} La Tenribali was appointed to reign over Boliq lands and thus became the first ''batara'' (ruler, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"sky\") of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}} The third ''batara'' of Wajoq, La Pateddungi To Samallangiq, was forced to [[abdicate]] by his people, reportedly because of his immoral actions. He was later [[assassin]]ated by a Wajorese noble.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=478}} Wajoq then underwent a constitutional change, after which a governing council was established. This council included and was presided by an elective principal ruler, who from then on would be known as the ''arung matoa'' (lit. \"senior lord\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=174}}). La Pal\u00e9wo To Palippu from B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola was chosen by the council as the first ''arung matoa'' of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=479\u2013482}}\n\nDuring the reign of the fourth ''arung matoa'', [[La Tadampareq|La Tadampareq Puang ri Maggalatung]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1491\u20131521{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=575}}), Wajoq became one of the major Bugis polities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=112\u2013113}} By the turn of the 16th century, Wajoq had been able to secure a relatively higher standing in its relationship with the neighboring [[Luwu|Luwuq]], which was a powerful polity in South Sulawesi during the 15th century, and presumably was regarded as Wajoq's overlord.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=21}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Together with Luwuq, Wajoq won a war against the nearby polity of [[Sidenreng|Sid\u00e9nr\u00e9ng]] in [[Ajatappareng]], forcing the latter to cede its territories north of the central lakes to Wajoq.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Wajoq under La Tadampareq also absorbed the remnants of what might have been the core territories of Cina, another influential early Bugis polity.{{sfnp|Caldwell|Wellen|2017|pp=306, 319}} Balance of power in the region further shifted in the early 16th century when [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]], a Bugis polity south of Wajoq, emerged victorious against Luwuq, and thus assumed a paramount position in the eastern part of the peninsula.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=22}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=114}} At the same time, the [[Makassar people|Makassar]] twin kingdoms of [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa]] and [[Kingdom of Tallo|Talloq]] to the west also [[Early history of Gowa and Talloq#Gowa and Talloq from 1511 to 1565|started to expand their power]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=24}} Early in the century, Gowa had cooperated with Bon\u00e9 in wars against Luwuq and Wajoq,{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=23}} but by the mid of the century their struggles for [[hegemony]] made Gowa and Bon\u00e9 clashed against each other. By this time, Wajoq had also fallen under Gowa's sphere of influence, and supported Gowa in a war against Bon\u00e9 in the 1560s.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=116, 131\u2013132}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=30}}\n\n=== The ''Tellumpocco'' alliance and the rise of Gowa-Talloq (1582\u20131660) ===\n[[File:South Sulawesi circa 1600.svg|thumb|upright=1|Political division of southern Sulawesi in around 1590]]\n\nThe continued rise of Gowa and its harsh treatment of its Bugis subordinates Wajoq and [[Soppeng|Sopp\u00e9ng]] prompted the latter two to sign the Treaty of Timurung, a mutual defense pact initiated by Bon\u00e9 in 1582.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=132\u2013133}} The relationship between these three allied Bugis polities, also known as the ''[[Tellumpocco]]'' (\"Three Powers\", lit. \"Three Peaks\"), is defined as that of brothers, with Bon\u00e9 acting as the elder, Wajoq the middle, and Sopp\u00e9ng the younger one. It sought to reclaim the autonomy of these Bugis lands, and to stop Gowa's expansionism.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=249}} Gowa's subsequent campaigns against Wajoq in 1582 and 1590 as well as against Bon\u00e9 in 1585 and 1588 were all successfully repulsed by the alliance, or in the case of 1590 campaign, abandoned following the murder of Gowa's ruler [[Tunijalloq]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=31}}\n\nNevertheless, by the early 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had succeeded in becoming the most dominant powers in the South Sulawesi peninsula as they bolstered international trade and promoted the new faith of [[Islam]].{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29, 177}} Between 1608 and 1611, Gowa waged successful campaigns throughout South Sulawesi, forcing Sopp\u00e9ng to embrace Islam in 1609, Wajoq in 1610, and Bon\u00e9 in 1611.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=33}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=136\u2013137}} Thereafter, the ''Tellumpocco'' surrendered the control of their foreign affairs to Gowa, although they were allowed to retain the alliance and still preserve considerable autonomy within their own domains.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}} This arrangement proved to be quite successful to win the support of the Bugis.

The ''arung matoa'' To Mappassaungng\u00e9 (r. 1627\u20131628{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=576}}) even offered to guard the Gowa capital when its ruler was off for an expedition, despite he was not being obliged to do so.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nWajoq entered another conflict when the ruler of Bon\u00e9, [[La Maddaremmeng]] (r. 1626\u20131643), whether for political or religious reasons, attacked and pillaged P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, one of Wajoq's constituent communities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=40}}{{efn|La Maddaremmeng had previously became a subject of controversy, as he had enforced a stricter interpretation of Islam to his people. He also went to abolish non-hereditary slavery in accordance to his belief, and tried to convince the other ''Tellumpocco'' members to follow his steps. This was not received favorably by Gowa, who viewed Bon\u00e9's attempt to spread its religious influence as a direct challenge to its hegemony over South Sulawesi ({{harvnb|Wellen|2014|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}; {{harvnb|Pelras|1996|p=142}}).}} As La Maddaremmeng refused to compensate for the goods seized in P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, Wajoq and Bon\u00e9 went to war against each other.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} Gowa and Sopp\u00e9ng sided with Wajoq in this conflict, and the joint forces succeeded in [[Battle of Passemp\u00e9|defeating Bon\u00e9 in October 1643]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=142}} Bon\u00e9 was harshly punished by being made a vassal of Gowa,{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} with a Bugis noble installed as a [[regent]] responsible to a Makassar lord. A subsequent rebellion led by La Maddaremmeng's brother was also quashed, and Bon\u00e9's status was further degraded to that of a \"slave\" (i.e. a colony), while its nobles were forcibly relocated to Gowa.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=142\u2013143}} Several contested territories held by Bon\u00e9 were given to Wajoq, and a large number of people from Bon\u00e9 were forced into [[Corv\u00e9e|unpaid labor]] in Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29\u201330}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=42\u201343}} This humiliation entrenched a feeling of resentment among the people of Bon\u00e9 towards both Gowa and Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=43}}\n\n=== Makassar War and Wajorese migrations (1660\u20131730) ===\nBy the second quarter of the 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had became the most politically and economically powerful polities in eastern Indonesia.

These communities were related to each other as well as to the central government at Tosora in various ways, ranging from vassalage to alliance \"as between brothers\".{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=176\u2013177}} The polity of Wajoq was divided into three ''limpo'' or main districts, namely B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola, Tua, and Talotenreng, which represented its three original founding communities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|pp=49\u201350}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=177\u2013178}} Each ''limpo'' held power over several smaller communities that either chose to affiliate themselves with the said ''limpo'' or were conquered.{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|p=50}} Each of these communities had considerable freedom, with its own leader and customs. It can also switch allegiance between different states, and by doing so, both its people and its territory will be subject to the new state.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=22}}\n\n<!--Arung matoa is the highest...-->In running the day-to-day administration of Wajoq, the ''arung matoa'' was assisted by three pairs of civilian and military leaders, each pair representing one of the three ''limpo''.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=482}}{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=245}} The civilian leader of a ''limpo'' was called a ''ranreng'' or regent, while the military leader was called a ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' or \"standard bearer\".{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=178}} The titles of the ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' were taken from the banner they carried: ''Pilla'' or \"Scarlet\" for B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola, ''Patola'' or \"Multi-colored\" for Talotenreng, and ''Cakkuridi'' or \"Yellow\" for Tua.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=23}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=485}} Each of the ''ranreng'' and  ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' were at least as powerful as the ''arung matoa''; together, these seven officials formed the state's highest governing body, known as ''Petta Wajoq''.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=23}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=178}}\n\nThe ''arung matoa'' was chosen among the \"white-blood\" or nobility class. The position of arung matoa cannot be held at once with another office. It also cannot be inherited and can only be held for life as long as the ruler was deemed fit for the position.{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=465, 535}} A ruler in precolonial South Sulawesi was expected to be subordinate to the state and the ''[[adat]]'' or customary law which delineates the autonomy of local communities; failure to do so may result in removal from office. The ''arung matoa'' La Samal\u00e9wa To Appakiung (r. 1612\u20131616), for example, was deposed by his people, reportedly because of his arbitrary actions.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=22}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=385}}\n\nThe central governing council of Wajoq consisted of 40 officials, collectively called the ''Arung Patampulu'' (lit. \"Forty Lords\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=165}}), of which the ''arung matoa'' was a member as well as the head.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=482}} The whole members only convened on certain occasions, including the election of a new ''arung matoa''.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=23, 175}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|p=51}}\n<!--\nThe power of ''Arung Patampulu'' is balanced by three non-noble officials known as ''punggawa'', who were elected among the elders of each district. ''Punggawa'' had considerable power... \n\n- Diaspora governmental structure (focus on Borneo and Makassar)...\n-->\n\n==Culture and society==\n{{see also|Bugis people}}\n{{sect-stub|date=April 2020}}\nWajorese texts often reiterate that \"the people of Wajoq are free\", and that their only master is the customary law, which is based on consensus. The concept of the \"freedoms of Wajoq\" included, among others: [[freedom of speech|freedom of expressing opinions]], freedom to act based on one's intention, [[freedom of movement]], [[freedom of contract]], and the freedom from unjust punishment.{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=148}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=481}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=433, 447\u2013448}} These \"freedoms\", however, had limitations and do not necessarily apply to the whole population.\n\nBugis women in the precolonial states of South Sulawesi were routinely involved in many aspects of the society. Women were also actively involved in the government. One 19th-century observer states that the women of South Sulawesi were commonly \"consulted by the men on all public affairs\" and were often \"raised to the throne, [even] when the monarchy is elective\".{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=250}} The British adventurer [[James Brooke]] (future [[Rajah of Sarawak]]), notes that at the time of his visit to Wajoq in 1840, four out of six members of Petta Ennengng\u00e9 were women, who frequently \"appear in public like the men; ride, rule, and visit even foreigners, without the knowledge or consent of their husbands.\"{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=250}}\n\n==Economy==\nWajoq was the source of most South Sulawesi overseas merchants between late 17th and late 19th centuries.{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=147}} Wajorese commerce extended as far as [[Sumatra]], [[Cambodia]], and [[New Guinea]].{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}}{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=147}} Throughout the Maritime Southeast Asia, Wajorese and other Bugis merchants acted as intermediaries between large and small trading nations.{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}} Wajorese trade flourished in part because of deliberate support from the government at Wajoq as well as from Wajorese communities abroad.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=67\u201368}} Leaders of Wajorese overseas communities regularly convened to advance their interest. One such conference in the early 18th century saw the codification of laws regulating Wajorese commerce and navigation, popularly called the Ammana Gappa's law code, after the then leader of the Wajorese community in Makassar. These laws set up frameworks for managing credit and debts as well as regulating other kinds of business relationships, providing ways to resolve conflict and giving Wajorese merchants advantages over merchants from other groups in Maritime Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=84, 91, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=64\u201365, 71}} Such a law code, according to historian Kathryn Wellen, is \"highly unusual, if not unique, for early modern insular Southeast Asia\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=84}}\n\nThe government financially supported Wajorese merchants by providing monetary loans, taken from the fund established by La Sal\u00e9wangeng. Borrowers were obliged to return the principals alongside parts of their profits. The profits would then be used to further Wajoq's interest, such as building armaments or renovating the state's mosque. This system allowed a large segment of Wajorese population to participate in commerce while also utilizing their economic power for the benefit of the society as a whole.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=82\u201383, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=76}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Early history of Gowa and

It was designed by [[Percy Allan]] and built in 1899 by [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]] contractor, S. McGill. The property is owned by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1467>{{cite NSW SHR|5051369|Dunmore Bridge over the Paterson River|hr=01467|fn=H00/00322|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n===Timber truss bridges and Allan trusses===\nTimber [[Truss bridge|truss road bridges]] have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n[[Truss bridge#Allan truss|Allan trusses]] were the first truly scientifically engineered timber truss bridges, and incorporate American design ideas for the first time. This is a reflection of the changing mindset of the NSW people, who were slowly accepting that American ideas could be as good as or better than European ones. The high quality and low cost of the Allan truss design entrenched the dominance of timber truss bridges for NSW roads for the next 30 years.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n[[Percy Allan]], the designer of Allan truss and other bridges, was a senior engineer of the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in late 19th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n===Dunmore Bridge===\nThe bridge was built in 1899 by S. McGill at a cost of [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]12,433, with J. Ferguson as inspector in charge of the work, under principal assistant engineer of bridges [[Ernest de Burgh]]. It replaced the 1863 Dunmore Bridge, which had been damaged in a flood in January 1895, and by 1896 was reported to be so suffering from the \"ravages of cobra, white ant and rot\" that a new bridge was required. Contractor McGill also built the [[Morpeth Bridge]] and the Hinton Bridge nearby. The new bridge was opened on 15 December 1899 by [[Walter Bennett (politician)|Walter Bennett]] MP, the Member for [[Electoral district of Durham|Durham]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article137526393 |title=The New Bridge at Dunmore. |newspaper=[[Dungog Chronicle : Durham and Gloucester Advertiser]] |volume=VI |issue=1255 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=19 December 1899 |accessdate=26 July 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article237185128 |title=BRIDGE OVER THE PATERSON RIVER. |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |issue=6400 |location=Sydney |date=15 December 1899 |accessdate=26 July 2018 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe lifting mechanism for the lift span has since been removed. The timber truss spans were replaced in 2013 with the same design, except replacing the wrought iron vertical tension members with steel and using blackbutt timber instead of grey ironbark.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n== Description ==\nDunmore Bridge is an overhead braced Allan type timber truss road bridge. It has three timber truss [[Span (architecture)|spans]], each of {{convert|34.2|m|ft|0}}, {{convert|34.4|m|ft|0}}, and {{convert|33.8|m|ft|0}}. It has an internal steel truss [[Vertical-lift bridge|lift span]] of {{convert|17.8|m|ft|0}}. There is a single approach span at each end giving the bridge an overall length of {{convert|130.5|m|ft|0}}. The bridge has a height restriction of {{convert|4.6|m|ft|0}} because of the overhead bracing between the tops of the trusses.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\nThe main spans of the superstructure are supported by twin cast iron cylinder [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. The bridge provides a single lane carriage way with a minimum width of {{convert|4.3|m|ft|0}} and a footpath. An Armco guardrail protects vehicular traffic, and a timber post and rail fence is provided on the footpath. The lifting mechanism is no longer in service following the removal of the lifting ropes and counter weights.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\nThe bridge was reported to be in good condition as at 13 September 2005. It has been well maintained by the RTA.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nCompleted in 1899, the Dunmore bridge is a representative example of an Allan truss road bridge, and is one of three surviving overhead braced timber truss road bridges in NSW. The bridge also has a lift span to allow river traffic under it, which is a rare feature that also contains much technical significance and information about engineering technology of the late 19th century. Most of its engineering details are intact, and the bridge is in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\nAllan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were 20% cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50% more load, and were easier to maintain. The people who live in the area around the bridge (Woodville and the Hunter region) value the bridge highly, and as such it has social significance. Dunmore Bridge is located in the Hunter region, which has 15 historic bridges each constructed before 1905, and it gains heritage significance from its proximity to the high concentration of other historic bridges in the area. In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Dunmore bridge is a rare and representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being Nationally significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\nDunmore Bridge over the Paterson River was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has moderate aesthetic significance.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The Dunmore bridge is valued by the people of the Hunter region.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nHighly rare - only combination of overhead Allan truss and lift span<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nHighly representative of overhead braced Allan trusses: in 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering|Australian Roads}}\n*[[:Category:Road bridges in New South Wales|List of road bridges in New South Wales]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite web|author=|date=2007|title=Dunmore Bridge over the Paterson River|url=http://www.visitnsw.com.au/Operator.aspx?ProductId=9019444}}\n* {{cite web|author=Attraction Homepage|date=2007|title=Dunmore Bridge over the Paterson River|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4301091}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC|name=Dunmore Bridge over the Paterson River|dno=5051369|id=01467|year=2018|accessdate=2 June 2018}}\n\n{{Road infrastructure in regional New South Wales}}\n\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Road bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1899]]\n[[Category:1899 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Truss bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Allan truss bridges]]\n", "text_old": "<!-- Article title: Dunmore Bridge over the Paterson River SHRNo:1467 DatabaseNo:5051369 -->\n{{Use Australian English|date=June 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2018}}\n{{Infobox bridge\n| name                = Dunmore Bridge\n| native_name         = \n| native_name_lang    = \n| image               = \n| image_upright       = \n| alt                 = \n| caption             = \n| pushpin_map         = \n| pushpin_relief      = \n| pushpin_map_size    = \n| pushpin_map_alt     = \n| pushpin_map_caption = \n| coordinates         = {{coord|-32.6804|151.6055|region:AU-NSW_type:landmark|display=inline,title|format=dms}}<!-- {{Coord}} -->\n| os_grid_reference   = \n| qid                 = \n| refs                = \n| carries             = Clarence Town Road\n| crosses             = [[Paterson River]]\n| locale              = [[Woodville, New South Wales|Woodville]], [[New South Wales]], Australia\n| starts              = \n| ends                = \n| official_name       = \n| other_name          = \n| named_for           = \n| owner               = [[Roads and Maritime Services]]\n| maint               = \n| heritage            = \n| id                  = \n| id_type             = \n| website             = \n| preceded            = \n| followed            = \n| design              = [[Truss bridge#Allan truss|Allan truss]]\n| material            = Timber\n| material1           = \n| material2           = \n| length              = {{convert|130.5|m|ft|0}}\n| width               = {{convert|4.3|m|ft|0}}\n| height              =\n| depth               = \n| traversable         = \n| towpath             = \n| mainspan            = {{convert|34.4|m|ft|0}}\n| number_spans        = 3:<br/>{{ubl|- {{convert|34.2|m|ft|0}}|- {{convert|34.4|m|ft|0}}|- {{convert|33.8|m|ft|0}}}}\n| piers_in_water      = \n| load                = \n| clearance_above     = {{convert|4.6|m|ft|0}}\n| clearance_below     = \n| lanes               = \n| life                = \n| first_length        = \n| first_diameter      = \n| second_length       = \n| second_diameter     = \n| third_length        = \n| third_diameter      = \n| capacity            = \n| num_track           = \n| track_gauge         = \n| structure_gauge     = \n| electrification     = \n| architect           = \n| designer            = [[Percy Allan]]\n| contracted_designer = \n| winner              = \n| engineering         = \n| builder             = S.

It has three timber truss [[Span (architecture)|spans]], each of {{convert|34.2|m|ft|0}}, {{convert|34.4|m|ft|0}}, and {{convert|33.8|m|ft|0}}. It has an internal steel truss [[Vertical-lift bridge|lift span]] of {{convert|17.8|m|ft|0}}. There is a single approach span at each end giving the bridge an overall length of {{convert|130.5|m|ft|0}}. The bridge has a height restriction of {{convert|4.6|m|ft|0}} because of the overhead bracing between the tops of the trusses.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\nThe main spans of the superstructure are supported by twin cast iron cylinder [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. The bridge provides a single lane carriage way with a minimum width of {{convert|4.3|m|ft|0}} and a footpath. An Armco guardrail protects vehicular traffic, and a timber post and rail fence is provided on the footpath. The lifting mechanism is no longer in service following the removal of the lifting ropes and counter weights.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\nThe bridge was reported to be in good condition as at 13 September 2005. It has been well maintained by the RTA.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nCompleted in 1899, the Dunmore bridge is a representative example of an Allan truss road bridge, and is one of three surviving overhead braced timber truss road bridges in NSW. The bridge also has a lift span to allow river traffic under it, which is a rare feature that also contains much technical significance and information about engineering technology of the late 19th century. Most of its engineering details are intact, and the bridge is in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\nAllan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were 20% cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50% more load, and were easier to maintain. The people who live in the area around the bridge (Woodville and the Hunter region) value the bridge highly, and as such it has social significance. Dunmore Bridge is located in the Hunter region, which has 15 historic bridges each constructed before 1905, and it gains heritage significance from its proximity to the high concentration of other historic bridges in the area. In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Dunmore bridge is a rare and representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being Nationally significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\nDunmore Bridge over the Paterson River was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has moderate aesthetic significance.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The Dunmore bridge is valued by the people of the Hunter region.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nHighly rare - only combination of overhead Allan truss and lift span<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nHighly representative of overhead braced Allan trusses: in 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering|Australian Roads}}\n*[[:Category:Road bridges in New South Wales|List of road bridges in New South Wales]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite web|author=|date=2007|title=Dunmore Bridge over the Paterson River|url=http://www.visitnsw.com.au/Operator.aspx?ProductId=9019444}}\n* {{cite web|author=Attraction Homepage|date=2007|title=Dunmore Bridge over the Paterson River|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4301091}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC|name=Dunmore Bridge over the Paterson River|dno=5051369|id=01467|year=2018|accessdate=2 June 2018}}\n\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Road bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1899]]\n[[Category:1899 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Truss bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Allan truss bridges]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAttribution:{{Road infrastructure in regional New South Wales}}", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunmore_Bridge"}

The Vert & Or first began to play in 1971 in the Quebec Universities Athletic Association, but only played for three seasons. The program was dropped after the 1973 season due to a shift in philosophy as many francophone universities placed an emphasis on community involvement and intramural athletic activities as opposed to intercollegiate athletics. That philosophy has shifted back to intercollegiate sports as [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]], [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] and Sherbrooke each began programs in 1996, 2002 and 2003, respectively.\n\nThe current football program has seen mixed success, with teams only qualifying for the postseason three times in its first eight years. However, the Vert & Or have shown progress as they played in their first [[Dunsmore Cup]] in [[2010 CIS football season|2010]], losing a close game to the [[Laval Rouge et Or]]. Then, in [[2011 CIS football season|2011]], Sherbrooke finished in 2nd place in the Quebec conference and hosted their first playoff game. Consequently, then head coach [[Andr\u00e9 Bolduc]] was named the RSEQ coach of the year. The team finished in third place in [[2012 CIS football season|2012]] and appeared in their second Dunsmore Cup, but once again lost to Laval.\n\n=== Recent regular season results ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

As a subdivision of the [[National Premier Leagues|nationwide NPL]], the league is the highest level within the [[Football Victoria#Soccer pyramid in Victoria|Victorian soccer league system]], serving jointly as the second tier within the overall [[Australian soccer league system|Australian pyramid]].\n\nAdministered by [[Football Victoria]], NPL Victoria is the latest iteration of first division competitions in the state. Historically known as the '''Victorian State League''' and later as the '''Victorian Premier League''', the league was first founded in 1908. It adopted its current branding in 2014, following [[Football Federation Australia]]'s 2012 National Competition Review. \n\nNPL Victoria is contested by 14 clubs. Running from February to September each year, the league sees teams play 26 regular season fixtures, once at home and once away against each other club. The first-placed team at the conclusion of the regular season is termed the \"premier\". The top six-placed clubs then play a [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out]] [[playoffs|finals series]], with the winner becoming the \"champion\". The bottom-placed teams operate a system of promotion and relegation with the division below, [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]]. \n\nThe league premier qualifies as Victoria's representative in the [[National Premier Leagues#Competition format##NPL Finals Series|national finals series]], whilst the champion plays against the [[Dockerty Cup]] winner in the [[FV Community Shield]].\n\n==History==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Victorian Premier League 2010.png|thumb|150px|Victorian Premier League logo.]] -->\nThe league commenced in 1909 with [[Carlton United FC|Carlton United]] being the first champions. It has run continuously except for a three season postponement from 1916 to 1918 owing to World War I. After 1945 the league, like fellow state competitions around the country, received a massive boost in numbers and quality with the post-war influx of European migrants, whose dominance was established so effectively that no club which had won the title before 1952, [[Brunswick Juventus|Juventus]]' first title, has won one since.\n\nJuventus would go on to dominate the league in the 1950s, winning six titles, including five in a row from 1952 to 1956. In 1958, after the Victorian Amateur Soccer Federation was formed, the league became known as the Victorian State League. From 1962 until 1976 the league was largely dominated by [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne Hellas]] and [[Footscray JUST]], which won 11 titles between them.\n\nWith creation of the [[National Soccer League]] (NSL) in 1977, the league gradually lost most of its stronger clubs, a trend that reached its peak between 1984 and 1986, when the NSL used a split conference system. After 1987, however, the league slowly started regaining clubs, firstly those discarded when the conference system experiment was abandoned and later when clubs became permanently relegated by the NSL to their respective state leagues. The dominant side during the years from 1977 to 2004 was [[Green Gully Cavaliers|Green Gully]], who won six titles during this period, despite also missing the years 1984\u20131986 from being in the NSL.\n\nIn 1991 the league rebranded again to become the Victorian Premier League and the first finals to determine the champions were staged in 1992, won by the newly promoted [[North Geelong Warriors|North Geelong]]. Following the demise of the NSL in 2004, the remaining two Victorian NSL teams [[Melbourne Knights]] and [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]] were granted permission to play in the VPL season of 2005. The league received a major boost at the start of the 2005 season when [[Vodafone]] became major naming rights sponsors, with the competition being renamed the Vodafone Cup. The 2005 season initially saw crowds attending in record numbers to witness the return of old derbies such as that between South Melbourne and [[Heidelberg United]], but with the formation of the A-League filling the void of a national domestic league, 2006 saw a sharp decline in attendances.\n\nThe end of the 2006 season also witnessed a controversial finish to the relegation battle. With three teams finishing on 30 points, [[Sunshine George Cross FC|Sunshine George Cross]] were relegated on goal difference. However, a post-season appeal to the tribunal on the grounds that [[Bulleen Royals|Essendon Royals]] had fielded a suspended player (Ilcho Mladenovski in round 24) saw the Royals deducted a point and relegated. Ultimately, both clubs reprised their position in the following season's competition with the inclusion of the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] evening out the numbers to 16, and as the first part of reforms to the competition set to be brought about in 2008.\n\nThe Australian Institute of Sport experiment was largely derided by the local clubs, and after their removal from the competition in 2008, the league reverted to 12 teams and a Top 5 Finals-Series in 2009. However, the concept of a youth development squad was reintroduced in 2010 with the National Training Centre team playing in midweek fixtures throughout the season but not for competition points. In 2011 the team, mostly comprising players from the [[Melbourne Victory]] youth squad, was renamed Victorian Training Centre Football and was eligible to score competition points for its matches but ineligible to qualify for the finals series or be relegated.\n\nOn 15 September 2013, Victoria Police arrested up to ten people, including [[Southern Stars FC]] players David Obaze, Nicholas McKoy and Joe Woolley as well as the coach, Zaya Younan, for allegations of match fixing. They are expected to be charged with corrupting the outcome of betting.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/sport/soccer/victorian-detectives-bust-soccer-matchfixing-syndicate-20130915-2tsh5.html ''The Age'' newspaper]</ref>\n\nIn early 2013, it was announced that Victoria would join the [[National Premier Leagues]], with the Victorian Premier League expected to be rebranded for the 2014 season.<ref name=\"australian-gallop-fa-cup\">{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/football/gallop-aims-for-aussie-fa-cup/story-fn63e0vj-1226577434849 | title=Gallop aims for Aussie FA Cup | work=The Australian | date=14 February 2013 | agency=Australian Associated Press | accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"442-seconddivision\">{{cite news | url=http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/252498,second-division-by-2022.aspx | title=Second Division 'By 2022'? | work=Australian FourFourTwo | date=3 October 2012 | agency=Sportal Australia | accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref> Although Football Federation Victoria's initial proposal was halted with the announcement of a deferral in November 2013 after several clubs objected to the process for selecting team.

The season is staged during the Australian winter, running from February to September. The league combines aspects of both the traditional European-style [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] and Australian-style [[playoffs|finals series]] within its competition format.  \n===Regular season===\nThe regular season consists of a double [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]]. Each club plays every other club twice, once at home and once away, for a total of 26 matches. Teams receive [[three points for a win]], one point for a draw and no points for a loss. The clubs are ranked first based on the number of points acquired during the season. If two teams have an equal number of points, they are separated firstly by [[goal difference]] and then the number of goals scored, calculated across all matches. The Rules of Competition provide head-to-head aggregate and head-to-head [[away goals rule|away goals]] as further tiebreakers if necessary.<ref>https://www.footballvictoria.com.au/sites/ffv/files/2019-02/2019%20Rules%20of%20Competitions%20Mens%20%20Boys%20final.pdf</ref> The team ranked first at the end of the regular season is termed the premiers, and becomes Victoria's entry for the [[National Premier Leagues|national NPL finals]]. \n===Finals series===\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, the six highest-ranked clubs qualify for the (Victorian) finals series. The finals take place over three weeks, with teams entering the series based on their respective finishes in the regular season. The teams ranked 3\u20136 enter at the elimination finals stage. The third-ranked team plays the sixth-ranked team, whilst the fourth-ranked team plays the fifth-ranked one. The two winners of the elimination finals meet the teams ranked 1 and 2 in the semi-finals. The premier in the regular season plays the lower-ranked qualifier from the elimination finals, whilst the runner-up plays the higher-ranked qualifier. The finals conclude with the [[grand final]], played between the two winners of the semi-finals. The winner of the grand final is crowned the champions. As all finals matches require a winner, they are all [[single-elimination tournament|knock-out fixtures]]. If a draw occurs at the end of normal time, 30 minutes of [[overtime (sports)|extra time]] are played. A [[penalty shoot-out]] is played if the teams are still drawn.\n\n===Promotion and relegation===\nNPL Victoria also operates a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with the division immediately below it, [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]]. The 13th and 14th-ranked clubs are automatically relegated. From NPL 2, the winners of each of the conferences, East and West, are automatically promoted to replaced the two lowest-ranked NPL clubs. The 12th-ranked NPL club also participates in a single-leg promotion/relegation play-off against an NPL 2 team, with the winner competing in the following year's NPL. The NPL 2 representative in the promotion/relegation play-off is determined by an earlier play-off between the runners-up of the two respective conferences.\n\n==Current clubs==\nThe following clubs are contesting the 2020 NPL Victoria season:\n\n[[Eastern Lions SC|Eastern Lions]] and [[St Albans Saints SC|St Albans]] were promoted from [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]] in 2019 as the champions of the East and West conferences, respectively, while [[Pascoe Vale FC|Pascoe Vale]] and [[Kingston City FC|Kingston City]] were relegated as the two last-placed finishers.

As a subdivision of the [[National Premier Leagues|nationwide NPL]], the league is the highest level within the [[Football Victoria#Soccer pyramid in Victoria|Victorian soccer league system]], serving jointly as the second tier within the overall [[Australian soccer league system|Australian pyramid]].\n\nAdministered by [[Football Victoria]], NPL Victoria is the latest iteration of first division competitions in the state. Historically known as the '''Victorian State League''' and later as the '''Victorian Premier League''', the league was first founded in 1908. It adopted its current branding in 2014, following [[Football Federation Australia]]'s 2012 National Competition Review. \n\nNPL Victoria is contested by 14 clubs. Running from February to September each year, the league sees teams play 26 regular season fixtures, once at home and once away against each other club. The first-placed team at the conclusion of the regular season is termed the \"premier\". The top six-placed clubs then play a [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out]] [[playoffs|finals series]], with the winner becoming the \"champion\". The bottom-placed teams operate a system of promotion and relegation with the division below, [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]]. \n\nThe league premier qualifies as Victoria's representative in the [[National Premier Leagues#Competition format##NPL Finals Series|national finals series]], whilst the champion plays against the [[Dockerty Cup]] winner in the [[FV Community Shield]].\n\n==History==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Victorian Premier League 2010.png|thumb|150px|Victorian Premier League logo.]] -->\nThe league commenced in 1909 with [[Carlton United FC|Carlton United]] being the first champions. It has run continuously except for a three season postponement from 1916 to 1918 owing to World War I. After 1945 the league, like fellow state competitions around the country, received a massive boost in numbers and quality with the post-war influx of European migrants, whose dominance was established so effectively that no club which had won the title before 1952, [[Brunswick Juventus|Juventus]]' first title, has won one since.\n\nJuventus would go on to dominate the league in the 1950s, winning six titles, including five in a row from 1952 to 1956. In 1958, after the Victorian Amateur Soccer Federation was formed, the league became known as the Victorian State League. From 1962 until 1976 the league was largely dominated by [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne Hellas]] and [[Footscray JUST]], which won 11 titles between them.\n\nWith creation of the [[National Soccer League]] (NSL) in 1977, the league gradually lost most of its stronger clubs, a trend that reached its peak between 1984 and 1986, when the NSL used a split conference system. After 1987, however, the league slowly started regaining clubs, firstly those discarded when the conference system experiment was abandoned and later when clubs became permanently relegated by the NSL to their respective state leagues. The dominant side during the years from 1977 to 2004 was [[Green Gully Cavaliers|Green Gully]], who won six titles during this period, despite also missing the years 1984\u20131986 from being in the NSL.\n\nIn 1991 the league rebranded again to become the Victorian Premier League and the first finals to determine the champions were staged in 1992, won by the newly promoted [[North Geelong Warriors|North Geelong]]. Following the demise of the NSL in 2004, the remaining two Victorian NSL teams [[Melbourne Knights]] and [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]] were granted permission to play in the VPL season of 2005. The league received a major boost at the start of the 2005 season when [[Vodafone]] became major naming rights sponsors, with the competition being renamed the Vodafone Cup. The 2005 season initially saw crowds attending in record numbers to witness the return of old derbies such as that between South Melbourne and [[Heidelberg United]], but with the formation of the A-League filling the void of a national domestic league, 2006 saw a sharp decline in attendances.\n\nThe end of the 2006 season also witnessed a controversial finish to the relegation battle. With three teams finishing on 30 points, [[Sunshine George Cross FC|Sunshine George Cross]] were relegated on goal difference. However, a post-season appeal to the tribunal on the grounds that [[Bulleen Royals|Essendon Royals]] had fielded a suspended player (Ilcho Mladenovski in round 24) saw the Royals deducted a point and relegated. Ultimately, both clubs reprised their position in the following season's competition with the inclusion of the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] evening out the numbers to 16, and as the first part of reforms to the competition set to be brought about in 2008.\n\nThe Australian Institute of Sport experiment was largely derided by the local clubs, and after their removal from the competition in 2008, the league reverted to 12 teams and a Top 5 Finals-Series in 2009. However, the concept of a youth development squad was reintroduced in 2010 with the National Training Centre team playing in midweek fixtures throughout the season but not for competition points. In 2011 the team, mostly comprising players from the [[Melbourne Victory]] youth squad, was renamed Victorian Training Centre Football and was eligible to score competition points for its matches but ineligible to qualify for the finals series or be relegated.\n\nOn 15 September 2013, Victoria Police arrested up to ten people, including [[Southern Stars FC]] players David Obaze, Nicholas McKoy and Joe Woolley as well as the coach, Zaya Younan, for allegations of match fixing. They are expected to be charged with corrupting the outcome of betting.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/sport/soccer/victorian-detectives-bust-soccer-matchfixing-syndicate-20130915-2tsh5.html ''The Age'' newspaper]</ref>\n\nIn early 2013, it was announced that Victoria would join the [[National Premier Leagues]], with the Victorian Premier League expected to be rebranded for the 2014 season.<ref name=\"australian-gallop-fa-cup\">{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/football/gallop-aims-for-aussie-fa-cup/story-fn63e0vj-1226577434849 | title=Gallop aims for Aussie FA Cup | work=The Australian | date=14 February 2013 | agency=Australian Associated Press | accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"442-seconddivision\">{{cite news | url=http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/252498,second-division-by-2022.aspx | title=Second Division 'By 2022'? | work=Australian FourFourTwo | date=3 October 2012 | agency=Sportal Australia | accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref> Although Football Federation Victoria's initial proposal was halted with the announcement of a deferral in November 2013 after several clubs objected to the process for selecting team.

The season is staged during the Australian winter, running from February to September. The league combines aspects of both the traditional European-style [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] and Australian-style [[playoffs|finals series]] within its competition format.  \n===Regular season===\nThe regular season consists of a double [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]]. Each club plays every other club twice, once at home and once away, for a total of 26 matches. Teams receive [[three points for a win]], one point for a draw and no points for a loss. The clubs are ranked first based on the number of points acquired during the season. If two teams have an equal number of points, they are separated firstly by [[goal difference]] and then the number of goals scored, calculated across all matches. The Rules of Competition provide head-to-head aggregate and head-to-head [[away goals rule|away goals]] as further tiebreakers if necessary.<ref>https://www.footballvictoria.com.au/sites/ffv/files/2019-02/2019%20Rules%20of%20Competitions%20Mens%20%20Boys%20final.pdf</ref> The team ranked first at the end of the regular season is termed the premiers, and becomes Victoria's entry for the [[National Premier Leagues|national NPL finals]]. \n===Finals series===\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, the six highest-ranked clubs qualify for the (Victorian) finals series. The finals take place over three weeks, with teams entering the series based on their respective finishes in the regular season. The teams ranked 3\u20136 enter at the elimination finals stage. The third-ranked team plays the sixth-ranked team, whilst the fourth-ranked team plays the fifth-ranked one. The two winners of the elimination finals meet the teams ranked 1 and 2 in the semi-finals. The premier in the regular season plays the lower-ranked qualifier from the elimination finals, whilst the runner-up plays the higher-ranked qualifier. The finals conclude with the [[grand final]], played between the two winners of the semi-finals. The winner of the grand final is crowned the champions. As all finals matches require a winner, they are all [[single-elimination tournament|knock-out fixtures]]. If a draw occurs at the end of normal time, 30 minutes of [[overtime (sports)|extra time]] are played. A [[penalty shoot-out]] is played if the teams are still drawn.\n\n===Promotion and relegation===\nNPL Victoria also operates a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with the division immediately below it, [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]]. The 13th and 14th-ranked clubs are automatically relegated. From NPL 2, the winners of each of the conferences, East and West, are automatically promoted to replaced the two lowest-ranked NPL clubs. The 12th-ranked NPL club also participates in a single-leg promotion/relegation play-off against an NPL 2 team, with the winner competing in the following year's NPL. The NPL 2 representative in the promotion/relegation play-off is determined by an earlier play-off between the runners-up of the two respective conferences.\n\n==Current clubs==\nThe following clubs are contesting the 2020 NPL Victoria season:\n\n[[Eastern Lions SC|Eastern Lions]] and [[St Albans Saints SC|St Albans]] were promoted from [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]] in 2019 as the champions of the East and West conferences, respectively, while [[Pascoe Vale FC|Pascoe Vale]] and [[Kingston City FC|Kingston City]] were relegated as the two last-placed finishers. [[Dandenong Thunder SC|Dandenong Thunder]] avoided relegation by winning the promotion/relegation play-off against [[FC Bulleen Lions|Bulleen Lions]].\n\n{{Location map+ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne |caption=Locations of 2020 NPL Victoria clubs within metropolitan Melbourne\n| width = 380\n| places =\n {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Avondale FC|Avondale]] \n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37.7626|S|144.8583|E}} }}\n {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Altona Magic SC|Altona]] \n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = top\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|50|48|S|144|51|25|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Bentleigh Greens|Bentleigh]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = bottom\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|58|7|S|145|5|27|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Green Gully SC|Green Gully]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = left\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|43|27|S|144|49|8|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Heidelberg United FC|Heidelberg]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|44|23|S|145|2|3|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Hume City FC|Hume]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = top\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|39|55|S|144|54|58|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Melbourne Knights FC|Knights]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = left\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|45|44|S|144|50|43|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Oakleigh Cannons FC|Oakleigh]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = bottom\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|54|22|S|145|5|55|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = {{nowrap|[[Eastern Lions SC|Eastern Lions]]}}\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = bottom\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37.8585318|S|145.0983669|E}} }} \n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[St Albans Saints SC|St Albans]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37.7330618|S|144.8119635|E}}  }} \n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Port Melbourne SC|Port Melbourne]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = bottom\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{Coord|37|49|59.92|S|144|55|44.17|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = {{nowrap|[[Dandenong Thunder SC|Dandenong Thunder]]}}\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{Coord|38.0023|S|145.2092|E}} }}\n{{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = {{nowrap|[[Dandenong City SC|Dandenong City]]}}\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{Coord|37.9599|S|145.2377|E}} }}\n{{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = {{nowrap|[[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]]}}\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{Coord|37|50|25|S|144|57|54|E}} }}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

S. W.|website=Roads and Maritime Services|language=en|access-date=2019-01-16}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nTimber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1469/>\n\nHarvey Dare, the designer of Dare truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer in the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1469/>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1469/>\n\n== Description ==\nGee Gee Bridge is a Dare-type timber [[truss bridge#Allan truss|Allan truss]] road bridge. It has a single timber truss span of {{convert|27.7|m}}. There are three timber approach [[Span (architecture)|spans]] at one end and two at the other giving the bridge an overall length of {{convert|72.5|m}}.<ref name=nswshr-1469/>\n\nThe super structure is supported by timber trestles and provides a dual-lane carriage way with a minimum width of {{convert|5.5|m}}. A timber post and rail guard rail extends the full length of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1469/>\n\nIn the 1990s strengthening of the timber trestles took place.<ref name=nswshr-1469/>\n\n=== Condition ===\nAs at 3 June 2005, the condition of the bridge was good. Intact, but timber [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] have been strengthened by additional piles.<ref name=nswshr-1469/> As at the time of removed from the Heritage Register the bridge was described as being in poor condition with \"no identifiable prospects for transfer, relocation, adaptive reuse or retention as an orphan structure.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nIn the 1990s there was strengthening of the timber trestles.<ref name=nswshr-1469/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe Gee Gee bridge is a Dare-type timber truss bridge, and was completed in 1929. In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Harvey Dare, the designer of this type of truss. Dare trusses were fifth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. They were similar to Allan trusses, but contain improvements which make them stronger and easier to maintain. This engineering enhancement represents a significant evolution of the design of timber truss bridges, and gives Dare trusses some technical significance. In 1998 there were 27 surviving Dare trusses in NSW of the 40 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.

across the [[Wakool River]], connecting [[Cunninyeuk, New South Wales|Cunninyeuk]] to [[Wetuppa, New South Wales|Wetuppa]], both in the [[Murray River Council]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. The bridge was designed by Harvey Dare and built in 1929. The bridge is owned by the Murray River Council and was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000<ref name=\"nswshr-1469\">{{cite NSW SHR|5051371|Gee Gee Bridge over Wakool River (under consideration for removal)|hr=01469|fn=EF14/5765|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref> and removed from the register on 2 March 2018.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/minister.aspx|title=Minister's decisions on heritage listings|access-date=16 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe 1929 bridge is being replaced under the NSW [[Roads and Maritime Services]] Timber Truss Bridge Strategy.

Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1469/>\n\nHarvey Dare, the designer of Dare truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer in the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1469/>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1469/>\n\n== Description ==\nGee Gee Bridge is a Dare-type timber [[truss bridge#Allan truss|Allan truss]] road bridge. It has a single timber truss span of {{convert|27.7|m}}. There are three timber approach [[Span (architecture)|spans]] at one end and two at the other giving the bridge an overall length of {{convert|72.5|m}}.<ref name=nswshr-1469/>\n\nThe super structure is supported by timber trestles and provides a dual-lane carriage way with a minimum width of {{convert|5.5|m}}. A timber post and rail guard rail extends the full length of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1469/>\n\nIn the 1990s strengthening of the timber trestles took place.<ref name=nswshr-1469/>\n\n=== Condition ===\nAs at 3 June 2005, the condition of the bridge was good. Intact, but timber [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] have been strengthened by additional piles.<ref name=nswshr-1469/> As at the time of removed from the Heritage Register the bridge was described as being in poor condition with \"no identifiable prospects for transfer, relocation, adaptive reuse or retention as an orphan structure.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nIn the 1990s there was strengthening of the timber trestles.<ref name=nswshr-1469/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe Gee Gee bridge is a Dare-type timber truss bridge, and was completed in 1929. In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Harvey Dare, the designer of this type of truss. Dare trusses were fifth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. They were similar to Allan trusses, but contain improvements which make them stronger and easier to maintain. This engineering enhancement represents a significant evolution of the design of timber truss bridges, and gives Dare trusses some technical significance. In 1998 there were 27 surviving Dare trusses in NSW of the 40 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Gee Gee Bridge is a representative example of Dare timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1469/>\n\nThe Gee Gee Bridge over Wakool River was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1469/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Harvey Dare, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1469/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible.
