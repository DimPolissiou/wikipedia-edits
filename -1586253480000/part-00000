The absence of regulation of the manufacture and use of cosmetics has led to negative [[adverse effect|side effects]], [[deformities]], blindness, and even death through the ages. Examples are the prevalent use of [[ceruse]] (white lead), to cover the face during the [[Renaissance]], and blindness caused by the [[mascara]] Lash Lure during the early 20th century.\n\n[[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian men]] and women used makeup to enhance their appearance. They were very fond of eyeliner and eye-shadows in dark colors including blue, red, and black. Ancient [[Sumer]]ian men and women were possibly the first to invent and wear lipstick, about 5,000 years ago.<ref>{{citation |title=Reading Our Lips: The History of Lipstick Regulation in Western Seats of Power |year=2006 |author=Schaffer, Sarah |publisher=Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard |accessdate=2014-06-05 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/10018966}}</ref> They crushed [[gemstone]]s and used them to decorate their faces, mainly on the lips and around the eyes.<ref name=\"lipstick3\">{{cite news |url= http://inventorspot.com/articles/the_slightly_gross_origins_lipstick_13653|title=The History of Lipstick And It's Slightly Gross Origins| publisher=InventorSpot|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref> Also around 3000 BC to 1500 BC, women in the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] applied red tinted lipstick to their lips for face decoration.<ref>Williams, Yona .

Cosmetics are mentioned in the [[Old Testament]], such as in 2 Kings 9:30, where [[Jezebel]] painted her eyelids\u2014approximately 840 BC\u2014and in the book of [[Esther]], where beauty treatments are described.\n\nOne of the most popular [[traditional Chinese medicine]]s is the fungus ''[[Tremella fuciformis]]'', used as a beauty product by women in China and Japan. The fungus reportedly increases moisture retention in the skin and prevents senile degradation of micro-blood vessels in the skin, reducing wrinkles and smoothing fine lines.  Other anti-aging effects come from increasing the presence of [[superoxide dismutase]] in the brain and liver; it is an [[enzyme]] that acts as a potent [[antioxidant]] throughout the body, particularly in the skin. Tremella fuciformis is also known in Chinese medicine for nourishing the lungs.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Reshetnikov SV, Wasser SP, Duckman I, Tsukor K |title=Medicinal value of the genus ''Tremella'' Pers.

''The History of Make-up''. First ed. Great Britain: The Macmillan Company, 1970. 41\u201342. Print.</ref>\n\nCosmetic use was frowned upon at many points in Western history. For example, in the 19th century, [[Queen Victoria]] publicly declared makeup improper, vulgar, and acceptable only for use by actors.<ref>{{cite book | title = Lipstick: A Celebration of the World's Favorite Cosmetic | first = J | last = Pallingston | isbn = 978-0-312-19914-2 | publisher = St. Martin's Press | year = 1998}}</ref>\n\nMany women in the 19th century liked to be thought of as fragile ladies. They compared themselves to delicate flowers and emphasized their delicacy and femininity. They always aimed to look pale and interesting. Sometimes ladies discreetly used a little rouge on the cheeks and used \"[[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]]\" to dilate their eyes so it would make them stand out more. Makeup was frowned upon in general, especially during the 1870s when social etiquette became more rigid. Teachers and clergywomen specifically were forbidden from the use of cosmetic products.\n\nDuring the 19th century, there was a high number of incidences of lead-poisoning because of the fashion for red and white lead makeup and powder. This led to swelling and inflammation of the eyes, weakened tooth enamel, and caused the skin to blacken. Heavy use was known to lead to death. However, in the second part of the 19th century, great advances were made in chemistry from the chemical fragrances that enabled a much easier production of cosmetic products.\n\nIt was socially acceptable for actresses in the 1800s to use makeup, and famous beauties such as [[Sarah Bernhardt]] and [[Lillie Langtry]] could be powdered. Most cosmetic products available were still either chemically dubious or found in the kitchen amid food coloring, berries and [[beetroot]].\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, cosmetics were in widespread use by women in nearly all [[industrial society|industrial societies]] around the world. The cosmetic industry became a multi billion-dollar enterprise by the beginning of the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/sports-and-everyday-life/fashion-and-clothing/clothing-jewelry-and-personal-adornment/cosmetics|title=Cosmetics}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 at the feminist [[Miss America protest]], protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \"Freedom Trash Can\".

The market was developed in the US during the 1910s by [[Elizabeth Arden]], [[Helena Rubinstein]], and [[Max Factor]]. These firms were joined by [[Revlon]] just before [[World War II]] and [[Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies|Est\u00e9e Lauder]] just after.\n\nAlthough modern makeup has been traditionally used mainly by women, an increasing number of men are using cosmetics usually associated to women to enhance or cover their own facial features such as blemishes, dark circles, and so on. Cosmetics brands release [[Male cosmetics|products specially tailored for men]], and men are increasingly using them.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/cos-206.html |title=FDA Authority Over Cosmetics |publisher=Cfsan.fda.gov |accessdate=2011-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513223418/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/cos-206.html |archive-date=2009-05-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nCosmetics are intended to be applied externally. They include, but are not limited to, products that can be applied to the face: [[Human skin|skin]]-care [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]], [[lipstick]]s, [[Human eye|eye]] and facial makeup, [[Wet wipe|towelettes]], and [[colored contact lenses]]; to the body: [[deodorant]]s, [[lotion]]s, [[Powder (substance)|powders]], [[perfume]]s, baby products, bath oils, [[bubble bath]]s, [[bath salts]], and body [[butter]]s; to the hands/nails: fingernail and toe [[nail polish]], and [[hand sanitizer]]; to the hair: permanent chemicals, [[hair]] [[hair coloring|colors]], [[hair spray]]s, and [[gel]]s.\n\nA subset of cosmetics is called \"makeup\", refers primarily to products containing color pigments that are intended to alter the user's appearance. Manufacturers may distinguish between \"decorative\" and \"care\" cosmetics.\n\nCosmetics that are meant to be used on the face and eye area are usually applied with a brush, a makeup sponge, or the fingertips.\n\nMost cosmetics are distinguished by the area of the body intended for application.\n* [[Lipstick]], [[lip gloss]], [[lip liner]], [[Lip augmentation|lip plumper]], [[lip balm]], lip stain, lip conditioner, lip primer, lip boosters, and lip butters:<ref name=USHealthandHuman>{{cite web|title=Cosmetics and Your Health \u2013 FAQs |url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |publisher=Womenshealth.gov |date=November 2004 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312162359/http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |archivedate=2013-03-12 }}</ref> Lipsticks are intended to add color and texture to the lips and often come in a wide range of colors, as well as finishes such as matte, satin, gloss and lustre. Lip stains have a water or gel base and may contain alcohol to help the product stay on leaving a matte look. They temporarily saturate the lips with a dye. Usually designed to be waterproof, the product may come with an applicator [[makeup brush|brush]], directly through the applicator, rollerball, or could be applied with a finger. Lip glosses are intended to add shine to the lips and may add a tint of color, as well as being scented or flavored. Lip balms are most often used to moisturize, tint, and protect the lips. Some brands contain [[sunscreen]]. Using a priming lip product such as lip balm or chap-stick can prevent chapped lips.\n* [[Primer (cosmetics)|Primer]] is used to set the face before makeup is applied. This creates another layer between the skin to prevent acne and makeup clogging up pores. Primer creates an even tone throughout the skin and makes makeup last longer. Primer is applied throughout the face including eyes, lips, and lashes. This product has a creamy texture and applies smoothly.\n* [[Concealer]] covers imperfections of the skin. Concealer is often used for any extra coverage needed to cover acne/pimple blemishes, undereye circles, and other imperfections. Concealer is often thicker and more solid than foundation, and provides longer lasting, more detailed coverage as well as creating a fresh clean base for all the rest of the makeup. This product also brightens up the skin and applying under the foundation can remove blemishes and discoloration because of acne scars. Some formulations are intended only for the eye or only for the face. This product can also be used for contouring the face like ones nose, cheekbones, and jaw line to add a more defined look to the total face. In that case, adding a setting powder will add a matte finish.\n* [[Foundation (cosmetics)|Foundation]] is used to smooth out the [[face]] by covering spots, [[acne]], blemishes, or uneven skin tone. These are sold in a liquid, cream, or powder, or more recently in a mousse. Foundation provides sheer, matte, dewy or full coverage.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Foundation primer is applied before foundation to fill out pores, create a dewy look or create a smoother finish. They usually come in cream formulas to be applied before foundation as a base.\n* [[Face powder]] sets the foundation and under eye concealer, giving it a [[wikt:Special:Search/matte|matte]] finish while also concealing small flaws or blemishes. It can also be used to [[Baking (make-up)|bake]] the foundation, so that it stays on longer and create a matte finish. Tinted face powders may be worn alone as a light foundation so that the full face does not look as caked-up as it could.\n* [[Rouge (cosmetics)|Rouge, blush, or blusher]] is cheek coloring to bring out the color in the [[cheek]]s and make the [[Zygomatic bone|cheekbones]] appear more defined. Rouge comes in powder, cream, and liquid forms. Different blush colors are used to complement different skin tones.<ref name=USHealthandHuman />\n* [[Highlighter (cosmetics)|Highlight]], used to draw attention to the high points of the face such as the cheekbones, below the eyebrows, nose, upper lip, and collar bones. This product also adds a glow; comes in liquid, cream, and powder forms. It often contains a substance to provide shimmer. Alternatively, a lighter-toned foundation/concealer can be used.\n* [[Bronzer]] gives skin a bit of color and contours the face for a sharper definition or creates a tan-look. Bronzer is considered to be more of a natural look and can be used for everyday wear. Bronzer enhances the color of the face.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> It comes in either matte, semi-matte/satin, or shimmer finishes.\n* [[Mascara]] is used to darken, lengthen, thicken, or draw attention to the [[eyelash]]es. It is available in various colors. Some mascaras include [[glitter]] flecks. There are many formulas, including [[Waterproofing|waterproof]] versions for those prone to [[allergies]] or sudden tears. It is often used after an [[eyelash curler]] and mascara primer.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Many mascaras have components to help lashes appear longer and thicker.\n[[File:Pre-wedding make-up.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eye shadow]] being applied]]\n[[File:Jim Brochu.jpg|thumb|[[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actor [[Jim Brochu]] applies makeup before the opening night of a play.]]\n* [[Eye shadow]] is a pigmented powder/cream or substance used to accentuate the eye area, traditionally on, above, and under the eyelids.  Many colours may be used at once and blended together to create different effects using a blending brush.  This is conventionally applied with a range of eyeshadow brushes, though it isn't uncommon for alternative methods of application to be used such as fingers. However, it is important to have clean fingers because oils from your skin can result in pimples <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eyeshadow|title=eyeshadow \u2013 definition of eyeshadow in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref>\n* [[Eye liner]] is used to enhance and elongate the apparent size or depth of the [[eye]]. For example, white eyeliner on the waterline and inner corners of the eye makes the eyes look bigger and more awake. It can come in the form of a pencil, a gel, or a liquid and can be found in almost any color. Conversely, black eyeliner makes eyes look smaller, brightens up the face and draws attention to the eyes.\n* [[Eyebrow]] pencils, creams, [[wax]]es, gels, and powders are used to color, fill in, and define the brows.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Popular in recent years, the \"Instagram look\" is creating fuller eyebrows by filling it, sharper angles, and adding gel to set it.\n* [[Nail polish]] is used to color the [[Nail (anatomy)|fingernails]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|toenails]].<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Transparent, colorless versions may strengthen nails or be used as a top or base coat to protect the nail or polish. This can be found in gloss, matte, and powder.\n* [[Setting spray]] is used as the last step in the process of applying makeup. It keeps applied makeup intact for long periods. An addition to setting spray is setting powder, which may be either pigmented or translucent. Both of these products claim to keep makeup from absorbing into the skin or melting off.\n* [[Eyelash extensions|False eyelashes]] are used when exaggerated eyelashes are desired. Their basic design usually consists of human hair, mink hair, or synthetic materials attached to a thin cloth-like band, which is applied with glue to the lashline. Designs vary in length and color. Rhinestones, gems, and even feathers and lace occur on some false eyelash designs. Eyelashes can be purchased in several drug or beauty supply stores and can be applied with eyelash glue. These eyelashes are not permanent and can be taken off easily by gently taking them off with your fingers.\n* [[Contouring]] is designed to give shape to an area of the face.  The aim is to enhance the natural shading on the face to give the illusion of a more defined facial structure which can be altered to preference.  Brighter skin coloured makeup products are used to 'highlight' areas which are wanted to draw attention to or to be caught in the light, whereas darker shades are used to create a shadow.  These light and dark tones are blended on the skin to create the illusion of a more definite face shape. It can be achieved using a \"contour palette\" \u2013 which can be either cream or powder.\nCosmetics can be also described by the physical composition of the product. Cosmetics can be liquid or cream [[emulsion]]s; powders, both pressed and loose; dispersions; and [[anhydrous]] creams or sticks.\n\n== Products ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}\n\nCleansing is a standard step in skin care routines.  Skin cleaning include some or all of these steps or cosmetics:\n\n* Cleansers or foaming washes are used to remove excess dirt, oil, and makeup left on the skin. Different cleansing products are aimed at various types of skin, such as sulfate-free cleansers and spin brushes.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n*Cleansing oil or oil cleanser is an oil-based solution that gently emulsifies the skin's natural oils. Cleansing oils are not recommended to individuals with blemish prone-skin.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n* Toners are used after cleansing the skin to freshen it up, boost the appearance of one's complexion, and remove any traces of cleanser, mask, or makeup, as well to help restore the skin's natural pH. They are usually applied to a cotton pad and wiped over the skin, but can be sprayed onto the skin from a spray bottle. Toners typically contain alcohol, water, and herbal extracts or other chemicals depending on skin type whether oily, dry, or combination. Toners containing alcohol are quite astringent, and usually targeted at oily skins. Dry or normal skin should be treated with alcohol-free toners. Witch hazel solution is a popular toner for all skin types, but many other products are available. Many toners contain [[salicylic acid]] and/or [[benzoyl peroxide]].\n* [[Facial mask]]s are treatments applied to the skin and then removed. Typically, they are applied to a dry, cleansed face, avoiding the eyes and lips.\n** Clay-based masks use kaolin clay or fuller's earth to transport essential oils and chemicals to the skin, and are typically left on until completely dry. As the clay dries, it absorbs excess oil and dirt from the surface of the skin and may help to clear blocked pores or draw comedones to the surface. Because of its drying actions, clay-based masks should only be used on oily skins.\n** Peel masks are typically gel-like in consistency, and contain acids or exfoliating agents to help exfoliate the skin, along with other ingredients to hydrate, discourage wrinkles, or treat uneven skin tone. They are left on to dry and then gently peeled off. They should be avoided by people with dry or sensitive skin, as they tend to be very drying.\n** Sheet masks are a relatively new product that are becoming extremely popular in Asia. Sheet masks consist of a thin cotton or fiber sheet with holes cut out for the eyes and lips and cut to fit the contours of the face, onto which serums and skin treatments are brushed in a thin layer; the sheets may be soaked in the treatment. Masks are available to suit almost all skin types and skin complaints. Sheet masks are quicker, less messy, and require no specialized knowledge or equipment for their use compared to other types of face masks, but they may be difficult to find and purchase outside Asia.\n* [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|Exfoliants]] are products that help slough off dry, dead skin cells to improve the skin's appearance. This is achieved either by using mild acids or other chemicals to loosen old skin cells, or abrasive substances to physically scrub them off. Exfoliation can even out patches of rough skin, improve circulation to the skin, clear blocked pores to discourage acne and improve the appearance and healing of scars.\n** Chemical exfoliants may include citric acid (from citrus fruits), acetic acid (from vinegar), malic acid (from fruit), glycolic acid, lactic acid, or salicylic acid. They may be liquids or gels, and may or may not contain an abrasive to remove old skin cells afterwards.\n\nAbrasive exfoliants include gels, creams or lotions, as well as physical objects. [[Luffa|Loofahs]], [[microfiber]] cloths, natural sponges, or brushes may be used to exfoliate skin, simply by rubbing them over the face in a circular motion. Gels, creams, or lotions may contain an acid to encourage dead skin cells to loosen, and an abrasive such as [[microbead]]s, sea salt and sugar, ground nut shells, rice bran, or ground apricot kernels to scrub the dead cells off the skin. Salt and sugar scrubs tend to be the harshest, while scrubs containing beads or rice bran are typically very gentle.\n\n* [[Moisturizer]]s are creams or lotions that hydrate the skin and help it to retain moisture; they may contain [[essential oil]]s, herbal extracts, or chemicals to assist with oil control or reducing irritation. Night creams are typically more hydrating than day creams, but may be too thick or heavy to wear during the day, hence their name. Tinted moisturizers contain a small amount of foundation, which can provide light coverage for minor blemishes or to even out skin tones. They are usually applied with the fingertips or a cotton pad to the entire face, avoiding the lips and area around the eyes. Eyes require a different kind of moisturizer compared with the rest of the face. The skin around the eyes is extremely thin and sensitive, and is often the first area to show signs of aging. Eye creams are typically very light lotions or gels, and are usually very gentle; some may contain ingredients such as caffeine or [[Vitamin K]] to reduce puffiness and dark circles under the eyes. Eye creams or gels should be applied over the entire eye area with a finger, using a patting motion. Finding a moisturizer with SPF is beneficial to prevent aging and wrinkles.\n\n== Brushes ==\nA makeup brush is used to apply makeup onto the face. There are two types of makeup brushes: synthetic and natural. Synthetic brushes are best for cream products while natural brushes are ideal for powder products.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/real-and-synthetic-makeup-brushes-difference-guide|title=This Is the Real Difference Between Natural and Synthetic Makeup Brushes|last=Webster|first=Emma Sarran|work=Teen Vogue|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en}}</ref> Using the appropriate brush to apply a certain product allows the product to blend into the skin smoothly and evenly.\n\n* A [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]] brush is usually a dense brush that distributes the product evenly while smoothing out the face. This brush is best used to achieve full coverage.\n* A [[concealer]] brush has a small, tapered tip that allows for precise spot correction such as blemishes or discoloration.\n* A stippling brush has soft, synthetic bristles that gives an airbrushed effect. This brush is best used to achieve light to medium coverage.\n* A [[Rouge (cosmetics)|blush]] brush comes in all shapes and sizes and is used to apply blush, allowing the blush to look natural while giving a flush of color.\n* A [[Face powder|powder]] brush tends to be big and fluffy for quick and easy application of dusting powder all over the face. Powder gives the appearance of a matte effect.\n* A bronzer blush, which can also serve as a contour brush is an angled brush that gives the face dimensions and illusions, by allowing the makeup to be placed in substitution of bone structure. This brush can also be used to add a shimmering highlight illusion to the cheekbones, nose and chin.\n* A highlight brush, also known as a fan brush, has bristles that are typically spread out and is used to apply where the sun would naturally hit.\n* An [[Eye shadow|eyeshadow]] brush is a dense brush that allows shadow to be packed onto the eyelid.\n* A blending eyeshadow brush is used to blend out any harsh lines you may have from the eyeshadow and can soften the eyeshadow look.\n* An [[Eye liner|eyeliner]] brush is tapered with an extra fine tip used for gel eyeliners which allows precision to line the eyes.\n* A spoolie is used to brush out the eyebrows and can also be used as a mascara wand.\n* A lip brush is small to ensure precision and is used to apply lipstick evenly onto the lips.\n* An eyebrow brush is tapered and is slanting from the top, which tends to define the eyebrows and fill in the empty spaces between brows, to give them a fuller and denser look.\n\n== Other products ==\n{{Main|Skin care|Sunscreen|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}\nThere are two categories of personal care products. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics as products intended to cleanse or beautify (for instance, shampoos and lipstick). A separate category exists for medications, which are intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent [[disease]], or to affect the structure or function of the body (for instance, sunscreens and acne creams).

Makeup sponges can be used to apply foundation, blend concealer, and apply powder or highlighter. The most popular brand of makeup sponges is the Beauty Blender.\n\n== Ingredients ==\n{{Main|Ingredients of cosmetics}}\nA variety of [[organic compound]]s and [[inorganic compound]]s comprise typical cosmetics.  Typical organic compounds are modified natural oils and fats as well as a variety of petrochemically derived agents.  Inorganic compounds are processed minerals such as iron oxides, talc, and zinc oxide.  The oxides of zinc and iron are classified as [[pigment]]s, i.e. colorants that have no solubility in solvents.\n\n=== Natural ===\n{{See also|Organic movement|Maker culture}}\nHandmade and [[Organic certification|certified organic]] products are becoming more [[mainstream]], due to the fact that certain chemicals in some [[skincare]] products may be harmful if absorbed through the skin. Products claimed to be organic should, in the U.S., be certified \"USDA Organic\".<ref>{{cite news | title = Natural, Organic Beauty | work=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/fashion/01skin.html?_r=1&oref=slogin | first=Natasha | last=Singer | date=2007-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Mineral ===\nThe term \"mineral makeup\" applies to a category of face makeup, including foundation, eye shadow, blush, and bronzer, made with loose, dry mineral powders.  These powders are often mixed with oil-water [[emulsion]]s. Lipsticks, liquid foundations, and other liquid cosmetics, as well as compressed makeups such as eye shadow and blush in compacts, are often called mineral makeup if they have the same primary ingredients as dry mineral makeups. However, liquid makeups must contain preservatives and compressed makeups must contain binders, which dry mineral makeups do not.  Mineral makeup usually does not contain synthetic fragrances, preservatives, parabens, mineral oil, and chemical dyes. For this reason, dermatologists may consider mineral makeup to be gentler to the skin than makeup that contains those ingredients.<ref name=\"The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup\">{{cite web | url=https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/the-lowdown-on-mineral-makeup#2 | title=The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup | website=WebMD | accessdate=29 October 2018 | page=2}}</ref>  Some minerals are nacreous or pearlescent, giving the skin a shining or sparking appearance. One example is [[bismuth oxychloride]].<ref name=Ullmann /> There are various mineral-based makeup brands, including: Bare Minerals, [[Tarte Cosmetics|Tarte]], [[Bobbi Brown]], and [[Stila]].\n\n==== Porous minerals ====\nPorous minerals is a subcategory of mineral makeup ingredients where the porosity of the mineral particles enables extraordinary absorption capacity compared to non-porous mineral materials. This feature improves sebum control, long-lasting mattifying effect or gives a matte texture when used in makeup. Porous minerals can also act as carriers, absorbing a wide range of substances into its porous network.\n\n==== Benefits of mineral-based makeup ====\nAlthough some ingredients in cosmetics may cause concerns, some are widely seen as beneficial. Titanium dioxide, found in sunscreens, and zinc oxide have anti-inflammatory properties.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/literature-review-safety-titanium-dioxide-and-zinc-oxide-nanoparticles-sunscreens|title=Literature review on the safety of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles in sunscreens|last=Administration|first=Australian Government Department of Health.

It is in direct contact with the cosmetic product. Secondary packaging is the outer wrapping of one or several cosmetic container(s). An important difference between primary and secondary packaging is that any information that is necessary to clarify the safety of the product must appear on the primary package. Otherwise, much of the required information can appear on just the secondary packaging.<ref name=\"CosmeticsEuropeRegulation\">{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmetics Regulation|url=https://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/cosmetics-industry/understanding-cosmetics-regulation/|publisher=Cosmetics Europe Association|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nCosmetic packaging is standardized by the [[ISO 22715]], set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]]{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref name=\"ISO22715:2006\">{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO 22715:2006 Cosmetics \u2013 Packaging and labelling|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36436|publisher=ISO.org|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref> and regulated by national or regional regulations such as those issued by the [[Regulation (European Union)|EU]] or the [[FDA]].

In this industry, it is common fall back on a suitably qualified person, such as an independent third party inspection and testing company, to verify the cosmetics\u2019 compliance with the requirements of applicable cosmetic regulations and other relevant legislation, including [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]], [[Good manufacturing practice|GMP]], [[Dangerous goods|hazardous substances]], etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/consumer-issues/product-safety/cosmetic-products-safety-regulations-2008-as-amended|title=Product safety for manufacturers|work=bis.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn the European Union, the circulation of cosmetic products and their safety has been a subject of legislation since 1976.

For instance, all annexes of the Regulation 1223/2009 were aimed to address potential risks to human [[health]].\nUnder the EU cosmetic regulation, manufacturers, retailers, and importers of cosmetics in Europe will be designated as \"Responsible Person\".<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:342:0059:0209:en:PDF \"EU Cosmetic Regulation 1223/2009\"], European Parliament & Council, 30 November 2009, Retrieved 7 April 2015</ref> This new status implies that the responsible person has the legal [[Legal liability|liability]] to ensure that the cosmetics and [[brand]]s they manufacture or sell comply with the current cosmetic regulations and norms.

The rules apply to manufacturers, importers, and retailers of cosmetics in Brazil, and most of them have been harmonized so they can apply to the entire [[Mercosur]].\n\nThe current legislation restricts the use of certain substances such as pyrogallol, [[formaldehyde]], or paraformaldehyde and bans the use of others such as lead [[acetate]] in cosmetic products. All restricted and forbidden substances and products are listed in the regulation RDC 16/11 and RDC 162, 09/11/01.\n\nMore recently, a new cosmetic [[Technical Regulation]] (RDC 15/2013) was set up to establish a list of authorized and restricted substances for cosmetic use, used in products such as [[Hair coloring|hair dyes]], nail hardeners, or used as product preservatives.\n\nMost Brazilian regulations are optimized, harmonized, or adapted in order to be applicable and extended to the entire Mercosur [[economic zone]].\n\n=== International ===\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) published new guidelines on the safe manufacturing of cosmetic products under a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) regime. Regulators in several countries and regions have adopted this standard, '''ISO 22716:2007''', effectively replacing existing guidance and standards.\nISO 22716 provides a comprehensive approach for a quality management system for those engaged in the manufacturing, packaging, testing, storage, and transportation of cosmetic end products. The standard deals with all aspects of the supply chain, from the early delivery of raw materials and components until the shipment of the final product to the consumer.\n\nThe standard is based on other quality management systems, ensuring smooth integration with such systems as ISO 9001 or the British Retail Consortium (BRC) standard for consumer products. Therefore, it combines the benefits of GMP, linking cosmetic product safety with overall business improvement tools that enable organisations to meet global consumer demand for cosmetic product safety certification.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36437 ISO 22716] ISO Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practices, Retrieved 09/27/2012</ref>\n\nIn July 2012, since microbial contamination is one of the greatest concerns regarding the quality of cosmetic products, the ISO has introduced a new standard for evaluating the antimicrobial protection of a cosmetic product by preservation efficacy testing and microbiological risk assessment.\n\n== Careers ==\n[[File:Professional Make-up Artist.jpg|right|thumb|A professional [[makeup artist]] servicing a client]]\n[[File:Alek Wek.jpg|right|thumb|Model [[Alek Wek]] receiving makeup from a professional.]]\n\nAn account executive is responsible for visiting department and specialty stores with counter sales of cosmetics.

They are usually paid by the hour by a cosmetic company; however, they sometimes work independently.\n\nProfessionals in cosmetics [[marketing]] careers manage research focus groups, promote the desired brand image, and provide other marketing services (sales forecasting, allocation to retailers, etc.).\n\nMany involved within the cosmetics industry often specialize in a certain area of cosmetics such as [[prosthetic makeup|special effects makeup]] or makeup techniques specific to the film, media, and fashion sectors.\n\nThe newest cosmetic based career is a beauty influencer. A beauty influencer is someone who has used their large social media following as a platform to make a name for themselves in the cosmetics industry. The most successful beauty influencers such as Jeffree Star, James Charles, and Jaclyn Hill, go on to create their own makeup brands or collaborate with other major brands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Airbrush makeup]]\n* [[Baking (make-up)|Baking]]\n* [[Body art]]\n* [[Cosmeceutical]]\n* [[Cosmetic packaging]]\n* [[Electrotherapy (cosmetic)]]\n* [[Female cosmetic coalitions]]\n* [[Henna]]\n* [[List of cosmetic ingredients]]\n* [[Male cosmetics]]\n* [[Maker culture]]\n* [[Moulage]]\n* [[Natural skin care]]\n* [[Permanent makeup]]\n* [[Skin care]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|last=Winter|first=Ruth|title=A Consumer's Dictionary of Cosmetic Ingredients: Complete Information About the Harmful and Desirable Ingredients in Cosmetics (Paperback)|origyear=2005|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=US|isbn=978-1-4000-5233-2|year=2005}}\n\n{{Sister project links| wikt=no | commons=Category:Cosmetics | b=no | n=no | q=Cosmetics | s=no | v=no | voy=no | species=no | d=no}}\n\n{{Cosmetics}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cosmetics| ]]\n[[Category:Skin care]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Substances applied to the body to change its appearance or fragrance}}\n{{About|substances also known as \"make-up\" in English||Cosmetic (disambiguation){{!}}Cosmetic}}\n{{Redirect|Make-up}}\n{{Redirect-distinguish|Toilette|Toilet}}\n{{Tone|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:Cosmetics.JPG|thumb|Assorted cosmetics and tools]]\n[[File:Makeup .jpg|thumb|Woman wearing several forms of cosmetics, including [[lipstick]], [[eye liner]], [[eye shadow]], [[Hair coloring|hair dye]], [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]], and [[mascara]].]]\n[[File:Self make up by an artist.jpg|thumb|An actor preparing for a stage performance.

Examples are the prevalent use of [[ceruse]] (white lead), to cover the face during the [[Renaissance]], and blindness caused by the [[mascara]] Lash Lure during the early 20th century.\n\n[[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian men]] and women used makeup to enhance their appearance. They were very fond of eyeliner and eye-shadows in dark colors including blue, red, and black. Ancient [[Sumer]]ian men and women were possibly the first to invent and wear lipstick, about 5,000 years ago.<ref>{{citation |title=Reading Our Lips: The History of Lipstick Regulation in Western Seats of Power |year=2006 |author=Schaffer, Sarah |publisher=Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard |accessdate=2014-06-05 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/10018966}}</ref> They crushed [[gemstone]]s and used them to decorate their faces, mainly on the lips and around the eyes.<ref name=\"lipstick3\">{{cite news |url= http://inventorspot.com/articles/the_slightly_gross_origins_lipstick_13653|title=The History of Lipstick And It's Slightly Gross Origins| publisher=InventorSpot|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref> Also around 3000 BC to 1500 BC, women in the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] applied red tinted lipstick to their lips for face decoration.<ref>Williams, Yona .

Cosmetics are mentioned in the [[Old Testament]], such as in 2 Kings 9:30, where [[Jezebel]] painted her eyelids\u2014approximately 840 BC\u2014and in the book of [[Esther]], where beauty treatments are described.\n\nOne of the most popular [[traditional Chinese medicine]]s is the fungus ''[[Tremella fuciformis]]'', used as a beauty product by women in China and Japan. The fungus reportedly increases moisture retention in the skin and prevents senile degradation of micro-blood vessels in the skin, reducing wrinkles and smoothing fine lines.  Other anti-aging effects come from increasing the presence of [[superoxide dismutase]] in the brain and liver; it is an [[enzyme]] that acts as a potent [[antioxidant]] throughout the body, particularly in the skin.

They compared themselves to delicate flowers and emphasized their delicacy and femininity. They always aimed to look pale and interesting. Sometimes ladies discreetly used a little rouge on the cheeks and used \"[[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]]\" to dilate their eyes so it would make them stand out more. Makeup was frowned upon in general, especially during the 1870s when social etiquette became more rigid. Teachers and clergywomen specifically were forbidden from the use of cosmetic products.\n\nDuring the 19th century, there was a high number of incidences of lead-poisoning because of the fashion for red and white lead makeup and powder. This led to swelling and inflammation of the eyes, weakened tooth enamel, and caused the skin to blacken. Heavy use was known to lead to death. However, in the second part of the 19th century, great advances were made in chemistry from the chemical fragrances that enabled a much easier production of cosmetic products.\n\nIt was socially acceptable for actresses in the 1800s to use makeup, and famous beauties such as [[Sarah Bernhardt]] and [[Lillie Langtry]] could be powdered. Most cosmetic products available were still either chemically dubious or found in the kitchen amid food coloring, berries and [[beetroot]].\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, cosmetics were in widespread use by women in nearly all [[industrial society|industrial societies]] around the world. The cosmetic industry became a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the beginning of the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/sports-and-everyday-life/fashion-and-clothing/clothing-jewelry-and-personal-adornment/cosmetics|title=Cosmetics}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 at the feminist [[Miss America protest]], protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \"Freedom Trash Can\".

The market was developed in the US during the 1910s by [[Elizabeth Arden]], [[Helena Rubinstein]], and [[Max Factor]]. These firms were joined by [[Revlon]] just before [[World War II]] and [[Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies|Est\u00e9e Lauder]] just after.\n\nAlthough modern makeup has been traditionally used mainly by women, an increasing number of men are using cosmetics usually associated to women to enhance or cover their own facial features such as blemishes, dark circles, and so on. Cosmetics brands release [[Male cosmetics|products specially tailored for men]], and men are increasingly using them.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/cos-206.html |title=FDA Authority Over Cosmetics |publisher=Cfsan.fda.gov |accessdate=2011-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513223418/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/cos-206.html |archive-date=2009-05-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nCosmetics are intended to be applied externally. They include, but are not limited to, products that can be applied to the face: [[Human skin|skin]]-care [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]], [[lipstick]]s, [[Human eye|eye]] and facial makeup, [[Wet wipe|towelettes]], and [[colored contact lenses]]; to the body: [[deodorant]]s, [[lotion]]s, [[Powder (substance)|powders]], [[perfume]]s, baby products, bath oils, [[bubble bath]]s, [[bath salts]], and body [[butter]]s; to the hands/nails: fingernail and toe [[nail polish]], and [[hand sanitizer]]; to the hair: permanent chemicals, [[hair]] [[hair coloring|colors]], [[hair spray]]s, and [[gel]]s.\n\nA subset of cosmetics is called \"makeup\", refers primarily to products containing color pigments that are intended to alter the user's appearance. Manufacturers may distinguish between \"decorative\" and \"care\" cosmetics.\n\nCosmetics that are meant to be used on the face and eye area are usually applied with a brush, a makeup sponge, or the fingertips.\n\nMost cosmetics are distinguished by the area of the body intended for application.\n* [[Lipstick]], [[lip gloss]], [[lip liner]], [[Lip augmentation|lip plumper]], [[lip balm]], lip stain, lip conditioner, lip primer, lip boosters, and lip butters:<ref name=USHealthandHuman>{{cite web|title=Cosmetics and Your Health \u2013 FAQs |url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |publisher=Womenshealth.gov |date=November 2004 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312162359/http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |archivedate=2013-03-12 }}</ref> Lipsticks are intended to add color and texture to the lips and often come in a wide range of colors, as well as finishes such as matte, satin, gloss and lustre. Lip stains have a water or gel base and may contain alcohol to help the product stay on leaving a matte look. They temporarily saturate the lips with a dye. Usually designed to be waterproof, the product may come with an applicator [[makeup brush|brush]], directly through the applicator, rollerball, or could be applied with a finger. Lip glosses are intended to add shine to the lips and may add a tint of color, as well as being scented or flavored. Lip balms are most often used to moisturize, tint, and protect the lips. Some brands contain [[sunscreen]]. Using a priming lip product such as lip balm or chapstick can prevent chapped lips.\n* [[Primer (cosmetics)|Primer]] is used to set the face before makeup is applied. This creates another layer between the skin to prevent acne and makeup clogging up pores. Primer creates an even tone throughout the skin and makes makeup last longer. Primer is applied throughout the face including eyes, lips, and lashes. This product has a creamy texture and applies smoothly.\n* [[Concealer]] covers imperfections of the skin. Concealer is often used for any extra coverage needed to cover acne/pimple blemishes, undereye circles, and other imperfections. Concealer is often thicker and more solid than foundation, and provides longer lasting, more detailed coverage as well as creating a fresh clean base for all the rest of the makeup. This product also brightens up the skin and applying under the foundation can remove blemishes and discoloration because of acne scars. Some formulations are intended only for the eye or only for the face. This product can also be used for contouring the face like ones nose, cheekbones, and jaw line to add a more defined look to the total face. In that case, adding a setting powder will add a matte finish.\n* [[Foundation (cosmetics)|Foundation]] is used to smooth out the [[face]] by covering spots, [[acne]], blemishes, or uneven skin tone. These are sold in a liquid, cream, or powder, or more recently in a mousse. Foundation provides sheer, matte, dewy or full coverage.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Foundation primer is applied before foundation to fill out pores, create a dewy look or create a smoother finish. They usually come in cream formulas to be applied before foundation as a base.\n* [[Face powder]] sets the foundation and under eye concealer, giving it a [[wikt:Special:Search/matte|matte]] finish while also concealing small flaws or blemishes. It can also be used to [[Baking (make-up)|bake]] the foundation, so that it stays on longer and create a matte finish. Tinted face powders may be worn alone as a light foundation so that the full face does not look as caked-up as it could.\n* [[Rouge (cosmetics)|Rouge, blush, or blusher]] is cheek coloring to bring out the color in the [[cheek]]s and make the [[Zygomatic bone|cheekbones]] appear more defined. Rouge comes in powder, cream, and liquid forms. Different blush colors are used to complement different skin tones.<ref name=USHealthandHuman />\n* [[Highlighter (cosmetics)|Highlight]], used to draw attention to the high points of the face such as the cheekbones, below the eyebrows, nose, upper lip, and collar bones. This product also adds a glow; comes in liquid, cream, and powder forms. It often contains a substance to provide shimmer. Alternatively, a lighter-toned foundation/concealer can be used.\n* [[Bronzer]] gives skin a bit of color and contours the face for a sharper definition or creates a tan-look. Bronzer is considered to be more of a natural look and can be used for everyday wear. Bronzer enhances the color of the face.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> It comes in either matte, semi-matte/satin, or shimmer finishes.\n* [[Mascara]] is used to darken, lengthen, thicken, or draw attention to the [[eyelash]]es. It is available in various colors. Some mascaras include [[glitter]] flecks. There are many formulas, including [[Waterproofing|waterproof]] versions for those prone to [[allergies]] or sudden tears. It is often used after an [[eyelash curler]] and mascara primer.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Many mascaras have components to help lashes appear longer and thicker.\n[[File:Pre-wedding make-up.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eye shadow]] being applied]]\n[[File:Jim Brochu.jpg|thumb|[[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actor [[Jim Brochu]] applies makeup before the opening night of a play.]]\n* [[Eye shadow]] is a pigmented powder/cream or substance used to accentuate the eye area, traditionally on, above, and under the eyelids.  Many colours may be used at once and blended together to create different effects using a blending brush.  This is conventionally applied with a range of eyeshadow brushes, though it isn't uncommon for alternative methods of application to be used such as fingers. However, it is important to have clean fingers because oils from your skin can result in pimples <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eyeshadow|title=eyeshadow \u2013 definition of eyeshadow in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref>\n* [[Eye liner]] is used to enhance and elongate the apparent size or depth of the [[eye]]. For example, white eyeliner on the waterline and inner corners of the eye makes the eyes look bigger and more awake. It can come in the form of a pencil, a gel, or a liquid and can be found in almost any color. Conversely, black eyeliner makes eyes look smaller, brightens up the face and draws attention to the eyes.\n* [[Eyebrow]] pencils, creams, [[wax]]es, gels, and powders are used to color, fill in, and define the brows.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Popular in recent years, the \"Instagram look\" is creating fuller eyebrows by filling it, sharper angles, and adding gel to set it.\n* [[Nail polish]] is used to color the [[Nail (anatomy)|fingernails]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|toenails]].<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Transparent, colorless versions may strengthen nails or be used as a top or base coat to protect the nail or polish. This can be found in gloss, matte, and powder.\n* [[Setting spray]] is used as the last step in the process of applying makeup. It keeps applied makeup intact for long periods. An addition to setting spray is setting powder, which may be either pigmented or translucent. Both of these products claim to keep makeup from absorbing into the skin or melting off.\n* [[Eyelash extensions|False eyelashes]] are used when exaggerated eyelashes are desired. Their basic design usually consists of human hair, mink hair, or synthetic materials attached to a thin cloth-like band, which is applied with glue to the lashline. Designs vary in length and color. Rhinestones, gems, and even feathers and lace occur on some false eyelash designs. Eyelashes can be purchased in several drug or beauty supply stores and can be applied with eyelash glue. These eyelashes are not permanent and can be taken off easily by gently taking them off with your fingers.\n* [[Contouring]] is designed to give shape to an area of the face.  The aim is to enhance the natural shading on the face to give the illusion of a more defined facial structure which can be altered to preference.  Brighter skin coloured makeup products are used to 'highlight' areas which are wanted to draw attention to or to be caught in the light, whereas darker shades are used to create a shadow.  These light and dark tones are blended on the skin to create the illusion of a more definite face shape. It can be achieved using a \"contour palette\" \u2013 which can be either cream or powder.\nCosmetics can be also described by the physical composition of the product. Cosmetics can be liquid or cream [[emulsion]]s; powders, both pressed and loose; dispersions; and [[anhydrous]] creams or sticks.\n\n== Products ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}\n\nCleansing is a standard step in skin care routines.  Skin cleaning include some or all of these steps or cosmetics:\n\n* Cleansers or foaming washes are used to remove excess dirt, oil, and makeup left on the skin. Different cleansing products are aimed at various types of skin, such as sulfate-free cleansers and spin brushes.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n*Cleansing oil or oil cleanser is an oil-based solution that gently emulsifies the skin's natural oils. Cleansing oils are not recommended to individuals with blemish prone-skin.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n* Toners are used after cleansing the skin to freshen it up, boost the appearance of one's complexion, and remove any traces of cleanser, mask, or makeup, as well to help restore the skin's natural pH. They are usually applied to a cotton pad and wiped over the skin, but can be sprayed onto the skin from a spray bottle. Toners typically contain alcohol, water, and herbal extracts or other chemicals depending on skin type whether oily, dry, or combination. Toners containing alcohol are quite astringent, and usually targeted at oily skins. Dry or normal skin should be treated with alcohol-free toners. Witch hazel solution is a popular toner for all skin types, but many other products are available. Many toners contain [[salicylic acid]] and/or [[benzoyl peroxide]].\n* [[Facial mask]]s are treatments applied to the skin and then removed. Typically, they are applied to a dry, cleansed face, avoiding the eyes and lips.\n** Clay-based masks use kaolin clay or fuller's earth to transport essential oils and chemicals to the skin, and are typically left on until completely dry. As the clay dries, it absorbs excess oil and dirt from the surface of the skin and may help to clear blocked pores or draw comedones to the surface. Because of its drying actions, clay-based masks should only be used on oily skins.\n** Peel masks are typically gel-like in consistency, and contain acids or exfoliating agents to help exfoliate the skin, along with other ingredients to hydrate, discourage wrinkles, or treat uneven skin tone. They are left on to dry and then gently peeled off. They should be avoided by people with dry or sensitive skin, as they tend to be very drying.\n** Sheet masks are a relatively new product that are becoming extremely popular in Asia. Sheet masks consist of a thin cotton or fiber sheet with holes cut out for the eyes and lips and cut to fit the contours of the face, onto which serums and skin treatments are brushed in a thin layer; the sheets may be soaked in the treatment. Masks are available to suit almost all skin types and skin complaints. Sheet masks are quicker, less messy, and require no specialized knowledge or equipment for their use compared to other types of face masks, but they may be difficult to find and purchase outside Asia.\n* [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|Exfoliants]] are products that help slough off dry, dead skin cells to improve the skin's appearance. This is achieved either by using mild acids or other chemicals to loosen old skin cells, or abrasive substances to physically scrub them off. Exfoliation can even out patches of rough skin, improve circulation to the skin, clear blocked pores to discourage acne and improve the appearance and healing of scars.\n** Chemical exfoliants may include citric acid (from citrus fruits), acetic acid (from vinegar), malic acid (from fruit), glycolic acid, lactic acid, or salicylic acid. They may be liquids or gels, and may or may not contain an abrasive to remove old skin cells afterwards.\n\nAbrasive exfoliants include gels, creams or lotions, as well as physical objects. [[Luffa|Loofahs]], [[microfiber]] cloths, natural sponges, or brushes may be used to exfoliate skin, simply by rubbing them over the face in a circular motion. Gels, creams, or lotions may contain an acid to encourage dead skin cells to loosen, and an abrasive such as [[microbead]]s, sea salt and sugar, ground nut shells, rice bran, or ground apricot kernels to scrub the dead cells off the skin. Salt and sugar scrubs tend to be the harshest, while scrubs containing beads or rice bran are typically very gentle.\n\n* [[Moisturizer]]s are creams or lotions that hydrate the skin and help it to retain moisture; they may contain [[essential oil]]s, herbal extracts, or chemicals to assist with oil control or reducing irritation. Night creams are typically more hydrating than day creams, but may be too thick or heavy to wear during the day, hence their name. Tinted moisturizers contain a small amount of foundation, which can provide light coverage for minor blemishes or to even out skin tones. They are usually applied with the fingertips or a cotton pad to the entire face, avoiding the lips and area around the eyes. Eyes require a different kind of moisturizer compared with the rest of the face. The skin around the eyes is extremely thin and sensitive, and is often the first area to show signs of aging. Eye creams are typically very light lotions or gels, and are usually very gentle; some may contain ingredients such as caffeine or [[Vitamin K]] to reduce puffiness and dark circles under the eyes. Eye creams or gels should be applied over the entire eye area with a finger, using a patting motion. Finding a moisturizer with SPF is beneficial to prevent aging and wrinkles.\n\n== Brushes ==\nA makeup brush is used to apply makeup onto the face. There are two types of makeup brushes: synthetic and natural. Synthetic brushes are best for cream products while natural brushes are ideal for powder products.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/real-and-synthetic-makeup-brushes-difference-guide|title=This Is the Real Difference Between Natural and Synthetic Makeup Brushes|last=Webster|first=Emma Sarran|work=Teen Vogue|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en}}</ref> Using the appropriate brush to apply a certain product allows the product to blend into the skin smoothly and evenly.\n\n* A [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]] brush is usually a dense brush that distributes the product evenly while smoothing out the face. This brush is best used to achieve full coverage.\n* A [[concealer]] brush has a small, tapered tip that allows for precise spot correction such as blemishes or discoloration.\n* A stippling brush has soft, synthetic bristles that gives an airbrushed effect. This brush is best used to achieve light to medium coverage.\n* A [[Rouge (cosmetics)|blush]] brush comes in all shapes and sizes and is used to apply blush, allowing the blush to look natural while giving a flush of color.\n* A [[Face powder|powder]] brush tends to be big and fluffy for quick and easy application of dusting powder all over the face. Powder gives the appearance of a matte effect.\n* A bronzer blush, which can also serve as a contour brush is an angled brush that gives the face dimensions and illusions, by allowing the makeup to be placed in substitution of bone structure. This brush can also be used to add a shimmering highlight illusion to the cheekbones, nose and chin.\n* A highlight brush, also known as a fan brush, has bristles that are typically spread out and is used to apply where the sun would naturally hit.\n* An [[Eye shadow|eyeshadow]] brush is a dense brush that allows shadow to be packed onto the eyelid.\n* A blending eyeshadow brush is used to blend out any harsh lines you may have from the eyeshadow and can soften the eyeshadow look.\n* An [[Eye liner|eyeliner]] brush is tapered with an extra fine tip used for gel eyeliners which allows precision to line the eyes.\n* A spoolie is used to brush out the eyebrows and can also be used as a mascara wand.\n* A lip brush is small to ensure precision and is used to apply lipstick evenly onto the lips.\n* An eyebrow brush is tapered and is slanting from the top, which tends to define the eyebrows and fill in the empty spaces between brows, to give them a fuller and denser look.\n\n== Other products ==\n{{Main|Skin care|Sunscreen|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}\nThere are two categories of personal care products. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics as products intended to cleanse or beautify (for instance, shampoos and lipstick). A separate category exists for medications, which are intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent [[disease]], or to affect the structure or function of the body (for instance, sunscreens and acne creams). Some products, such as moisturizing sunscreens and anti-dandruff shampoos, are regulated within both categories.<ref name=\"Kessler2015\">Kessler R.

Makeup sponges can be used to apply foundation, blend concealer, and apply powder or highlighter. The most popular brand of makeup sponges is the Beauty Blender.\n\n== Ingredients ==\n{{Main|Ingredients of cosmetics}}\nA variety of [[organic compound]]s and [[inorganic compound]]s comprise typical cosmetics.  Typical organic compounds are modified natural oils and fats as well as a variety of petrochemically derived agents.  Inorganic compounds are processed minerals such as iron oxides, talc, and zinc oxide.  The oxides of zinc and iron are classified as [[pigment]]s, i.e. colorants that have no solubility in solvents.\n\n=== Natural ===\n{{See also|Organic movement|Maker culture}}\nHandmade and [[Organic certification|certified organic]] products are becoming more [[mainstream]], due to the fact that certain chemicals in some [[skincare]] products may be harmful if absorbed through the skin. Products claimed to be organic should, in the U.S., be certified \"USDA Organic\".<ref>{{cite news | title = Natural, Organic Beauty | work=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/fashion/01skin.html?_r=1&oref=slogin | first=Natasha | last=Singer | date=2007-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Mineral ===\nThe term \"mineral makeup\" applies to a category of face makeup, including foundation, eye shadow, blush, and bronzer, made with loose, dry mineral powders.  These powders are often mixed with oil-water [[emulsion]]s. Lipsticks, liquid foundations, and other liquid cosmetics, as well as compressed makeups such as eye shadow and blush in compacts, are often called mineral makeup if they have the same primary ingredients as dry mineral makeups. However, liquid makeups must contain preservatives and compressed makeups must contain binders, which dry mineral makeups do not.  Mineral makeup usually does not contain synthetic fragrances, preservatives, parabens, mineral oil, and chemical dyes. For this reason, dermatologists may consider mineral makeup to be gentler to the skin than makeup that contains those ingredients.<ref name=\"The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup\">{{cite web | url=https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/the-lowdown-on-mineral-makeup#2 | title=The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup | website=WebMD | accessdate=29 October 2018 | page=2}}</ref>  Some minerals are nacreous or pearlescent, giving the skin a shining or sparking appearance. One example is [[bismuth oxychloride]].<ref name=Ullmann /> There are various mineral-based makeup brands, including: Bare Minerals, [[Tarte Cosmetics|Tarte]], [[Bobbi Brown]], and [[Stila]].\n\n==== Porous minerals ====\nPorous minerals is a subcategory of mineral makeup ingredients where the porosity of the mineral particles enables extraordinary absorption capacity compared to non-porous mineral materials. This feature improves sebum control, long-lasting mattifying effect or gives a matte texture when used in makeup. Porous minerals can also act as carriers, absorbing a wide range of substances into its porous network.\n\n==== Benefits of mineral-based makeup ====\nAlthough some ingredients in cosmetics may cause concerns, some are widely seen as beneficial. Titanium dioxide, found in sunscreens, and zinc oxide have anti-inflammatory properties.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/literature-review-safety-titanium-dioxide-and-zinc-oxide-nanoparticles-sunscreens|title=Literature review on the safety of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles in sunscreens|last=Administration|first=Australian Government Department of Health.

It is in direct contact with the cosmetic product. Secondary packaging is the outer wrapping of one or several cosmetic container(s). An important difference between primary and secondary packaging is that any information that is necessary to clarify the safety of the product must appear on the primary package. Otherwise, much of the required information can appear on just the secondary packaging.<ref name=\"CosmeticsEuropeRegulation\">{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmetics Regulation|url=https://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/cosmetics-industry/understanding-cosmetics-regulation/|publisher=Cosmetics Europe Association|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nCosmetic packaging is standardized by the [[ISO 22715]], set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]]{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref name=\"ISO22715:2006\">{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO 22715:2006 Cosmetics \u2013 Packaging and labelling|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36436|publisher=ISO.org|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref> and regulated by national or regional regulations such as those issued by the [[Regulation (European Union)|EU]] or the [[FDA]].

All restricted and forbidden substances and products are listed in the regulation RDC 16/11 and RDC 162, 09/11/01.\n\nMore recently, a new cosmetic [[Technical Regulation]] (RDC 15/2013) was set up to establish a list of authorized and restricted substances for cosmetic use, used in products such as [[Hair coloring|hair dyes]], nail hardeners, or used as product preservatives.\n\nMost Brazilian regulations are optimized, harmonized, or adapted in order to be applicable and extended to the entire Mercosur [[economic zone]].\n\n=== International ===\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) published new guidelines on the safe manufacturing of cosmetic products under a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) regime. Regulators in several countries and regions have adopted this standard, '''ISO 22716:2007''', effectively replacing existing guidance and standards.\nISO 22716 provides a comprehensive approach for a quality management system for those engaged in the manufacturing, packaging, testing, storage, and transportation of cosmetic end products. The standard deals with all aspects of the supply chain, from the early delivery of raw materials and components until the shipment of the final product to the consumer.\n\nThe standard is based on other quality management systems, ensuring smooth integration with such systems as ISO 9001 or the British Retail Consortium (BRC) standard for consumer products. Therefore, it combines the benefits of GMP, linking cosmetic product safety with overall business improvement tools that enable organisations to meet global consumer demand for cosmetic product safety certification.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36437 ISO 22716] ISO Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practices, Retrieved 09/27/2012</ref>\n\nIn July 2012, since microbial contamination is one of the greatest concerns regarding the quality of cosmetic products, the ISO has introduced a new standard for evaluating the antimicrobial protection of a cosmetic product by preservation efficacy testing and microbiological risk assessment.\n\n== Careers ==\n[[File:Professional Make-up Artist.jpg|right|thumb|A professional [[makeup artist]] servicing a client]]\n[[File:Alek Wek.jpg|right|thumb|Model [[Alek Wek]] receiving makeup from a professional.]]\n\nAn account executive is responsible for visiting department and specialty stores with counter sales of cosmetics. They explain new products and \"gifts with purchase\" arrangements (free items given out upon purchase of cosmetics items costing over some set amount).\n\nA beauty adviser provides product advice based on the client's skin care and makeup requirements. Beauty advisers can be certified by an Anti-Aging Beauty Institute.\n\nA [[Cosmetology|cosmetician]] is a professional who provides facial and body treatments for clients. The term [[Cosmetology|cosmetologist]] is sometimes used interchangeably with this term, but the former most commonly refers to a certified professional. A freelance [[makeup artist]] provides clients with beauty advice and cosmetics assistance. They are usually paid by the hour by a cosmetic company; however, they sometimes work independently.\n\nProfessionals in cosmetics [[marketing]] careers manage research focus groups, promote the desired brand image, and provide other marketing services (sales forecasting, allocation to retailers, etc.).\n\nMany involved within the cosmetics industry often specialize in a certain area of cosmetics such as [[prosthetic makeup|special effects makeup]] or makeup techniques specific to the film, media, and fashion sectors.\n\nThe newest cosmetic based career is a beauty influencer. A beauty influencer is someone who has used their large social media following as a platform to make a name for themselves in the cosmetics industry. The most successful beauty influencers such as Jeffree Star, James Charles, and Jaclyn Hill, go on to create their own makeup brands or collaborate with other major brands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Airbrush makeup]]\n* [[Baking (make-up)|Baking]]\n* [[Body art]]\n* [[Cosmeceutical]]\n* [[Cosmetic packaging]]\n* [[Electrotherapy (cosmetic)]]\n* [[Female cosmetic coalitions]]\n* [[Henna]]\n* [[List of cosmetic ingredients]]\n* [[Male cosmetics]]\n* [[Maker culture]]\n* [[Moulage]]\n* [[Natural skin care]]\n* [[Permanent makeup]]\n* [[Skin care]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|last=Winter|first=Ruth|title=A Consumer's Dictionary of Cosmetic Ingredients: Complete Information About the Harmful and Desirable Ingredients in Cosmetics (Paperback)|origyear=2005|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=US|isbn=978-1-4000-5233-2|year=2005}}\n\n{{Sister project links| wikt=no | commons=Category:Cosmetics | b=no | n=no | q=Cosmetics | s=no | v=no | voy=no | species=no | d=no}}\n\n{{Cosmetics}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cosmetics| ]]\n[[Category:Skin care]]\n", "name_user": "Tanishka017", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"}

The FRGC was a separate algorithm development project designed to promote and advance face recognition technology that supports existing face recognition efforts in the U.S. Government. One of the objectives of the FRGC was to develop face recognition algorithms capable of performance an order of magnitude better than FRVT 2002. The FRGC was conducted from May 2004 through March 2006. FRGC data is still available to face recognition researchers.

The Faroe Islands and Greenland have been under the [[Monarchy of Denmark|Crown of Denmark]] since 1397 (''[[de facto]]'') when the [[Kalmar Union]] was ratified, and part of the Kingdom of Denmark since 1814 (''[[de jure]]''). However, due to their separate historical and cultural identities, these parts of the Realm now have an [[Autonomous administrative division|extensive degree of self-government]] and have assumed [[legislature|legislative]] and [[Executive (government)|administrative]] responsibility in a substantial number of fields.<ref name=\"denmark.dk\">{{cite web|title=Greenland and the Faroe Islands|url=http://denmark.dk/en/society/greenland-and-the-faroes/|work=Denmark.dk|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark|accessdate=19 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521224520/http://denmark.dk/en/society/greenland-and-the-faroes|archivedate=21 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nLegal matters in the Realm are subject to the [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish constitution]].<ref>See ''\"Danmarks Riges Grundlov\"'' (\u00a7 1).</ref> Beginning in 1948, The Home Rule Arrangements transfer political competence and responsibility from the Danish political authorities to the Faroese and later the Greenlandic political authorities. In 1978, The Unity of The Realm was for the first time unofficially referred to as ''rigsf\u00e6llesskabet''. The name caught on and since the 1990s, both \"The unity of the Realm\" and the Danish Realm itself have increasingly been referred to as simply ''rigsf\u00e6llesskabet'' ({{lang-fo|r\u00edkisfelagsskapurin}}; {{lang-kl|naalagaaffeqatigiit}})<!--Sourced, do not remove--> in daily parlance.<ref name=Adriansen/>\n\nThe Danish constitution<ref name=\"constitution\" /> stipulates that it applies for all parts of the [[Denmark|Kingdom of Denmark]] and that legislative, executive and judicial powers are the responsibility of the [[Folketing|Danish Parliament]], the [[Cabinet of Denmark|Danish Government]] and the [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Danish Supreme Court]]. The Faroe Islands received [[home rule]] in 1948 and Greenland did so in 1979. In 2005, the Faroes received a self-government arrangement, and in 2009 Greenland received \"[[#Terminology|self rule]]\", thus leaving the Danish state government with virtually no influence over internal affairs devolved to the home governments of Greenland and the Faroe Islands.\n\n==Constitutionality==\nThe Danish Realm's unique state of [[State (polity)|internal affairs]] is acted out in the principle of the \"unity of the Realm\".<ref name=\"unity of the realm\"/> This principle is derived from Article 1 of the [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish Constitution]] which specifies that constitutional law applies equally to all areas of the Danish Realm.<ref name=\"constitution\">[http://www.eu-oplysningen.dk/upload/application/pdf/0172b719/Constitution%20of%20Denmark.pdf%3Fdownload%3D1 Constitutional Act of Denmark].

The Kingdom of Denmark's parliament, with its 179 members, is located in the capital, [[Copenhagen]]. Greenland and the Faroe Islands each elect two members to the parliament; the remaining 175 members are elected in Denmark.

The Faroese and Greenlandic authorities administer the tasks taken over from the state, enact legislation in these specific fields and have the economic responsibility for solving these tasks. The [[Politics of Denmark|Danish government]] provides an annual grant to the Faroese and the Greenlandic authorities to cover the costs of these devolved areas.<ref name=\"denmark.dk\" />\n\n[[File:Tinganes.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tinganes]], in the capital [[T\u00f3rshavn]], is the location of the Faroese Home Government.]]\n\nThe 1948 \"Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands\" sets out the terms of Faroese [[#Terminology|home rule]].

Neither Greenland nor the Faroe Islands can write laws which concern the relationship with other states, nor laws that apply to the entire Realm; furthermore, the Supreme Court (Danish: ''H\u00f8jesteret'') in Copenhagen is the final legal instance, and legal matters from Greenland and the Faroe Islands must be prepared for that court, like any Danish matter.

Representatives for both have joined Danish delegations in discussions on some international matters, such as fishing rights. Greenlandic representatives were included in the process of a new treaty between Denmark and the US regarding the [[Thule Air Base]] in northwest Greenland.\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark as a whole is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[OECD]] and the [[World Trade Organization]]. The Faroe Islands and Greenland are associated members of the [[Nordic Council]] in their own right as part of the wider membership of the Kingdom. Although the Kingdom of Denmark is a member of the [[European Union]], both areas have special dispensation and remain outside the EU. Greenland joined the EU as part of Denmark in 1973, but [[1982 Greenlandic European Economic Community membership referendum|opted to leave]] in 1985 after Greenlandic home rule was introduced in 1979.\n\nThe \"Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands\" specifies that a 'Faroese' shall be understood to mean a person who is a \"''national'' of Denmark and a ''resident'' of the Faroe Islands\".<ref name=\"Faroese home rule\" /> The Government of Denmark issues special passports for its citizens living in the Faroe Islands and Greenland with the right to choose a regular [[Danish passport]] as well.

In this arrangement, the Danish government deals with external matters such as defence and foreign affairs. Greenland and the Faroe Islands maintain their own elected assemblies and administrations, headed by a premier who appoints a cabinet. This is synonymous with \"self-governing\".\n\n; ''Selvstyre'': Following [[2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum|a referendum]] on 25 November 2008 (the 30th anniversary of the establishment of home rule in Greenland), the relationship between the Danish and Greenlandic governments changed, with Greenland gaining greater autonomy. Further powers were granted to the Greenlandic government on 21 June 2009, including control of the police force, coastguard, and courts. Additionally, Greenland now receives fewer Danish subsidies, becoming more self-sufficient.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7749427.stm Greenland votes for more autonomy] BBC News, 26 November 2008</ref> As a result of these changes Greenland was now said to have ''self rule'' with minimal support from Denmark, as opposed to \"home rule\".\n\n; ''Rigsombudsmand'': [[High Commissioners]] represent the interests of Denmark in the Faroe Islands and Greenland. There is one Danish High Commissioner in each territory.

The Faroe Islands and Greenland have been under the [[Monarchy of Denmark|Crown of Denmark]] since 1397 (''[[de facto]]'') when the [[Kalmar Union]] was ratified, and part of the Kingdom of Denmark since 1814 (''[[de jure]]''). However, due to their separate historical and cultural identities, these parts of the Realm now have an [[Autonomous administrative division|extensive degree of self-government]] and have assumed [[legislature|legislative]] and [[Executive (government)|administrative]] responsibility in a substantial number of fields.<ref name=\"denmark.dk\">{{cite web|title=Greenland and the Faroe Islands|url=http://denmark.dk/en/society/greenland-and-the-faroes/|work=Denmark.dk|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark|accessdate=19 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521224520/http://denmark.dk/en/society/greenland-and-the-faroes|archivedate=21 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nLegal matters in the Realm are subject to the [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish constitution]].<ref>See ''\"Danmarks Riges Grundlov\"'' (\u00a7 1).</ref> Beginning in 1948, The Home Rule Arrangements transfer political competence and responsibility from the Danish political authorities to the Faroese and later the Greenlandic political authorities. In 1978, The Unity of The Realm was for the first time unofficially referred to as ''rigsf\u00e6llesskabet''. The name caught on and since the 1990s, both \"The unity of the Realm\" and the Danish Realm itself have increasingly been referred to as simply ''rigsf\u00e6llesskabet'' ({{lang-fo|r\u00edkisfelagsskapurin}}; {{lang-kl|naalagaaffeqatigiit}})<!--Sourced, do not remove--> in daily parlance.<ref name=Adriansen/>\n\nThe Danish constitution<ref name=\"constitution\" /> stipulates that it applies for all parts of the [[Denmark|Kingdom of Denmark]] and that legislative, executive and judicial powers are the responsibility of the [[Folketing|Danish Parliament]], the [[Cabinet of Denmark|Danish Government]] and the [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Danish Supreme Court]]. The Faroe Islands received [[home rule]] in 1948 and Greenland did so in 1979. In 2005, the Faroes received a self-government arrangement, and in 2009 Greenland received \"[[#Terminology|self rule]]\", thus leaving the Danish state government with virtually no influence over internal affairs devolved to the home governments of Greenland and the Faroe Islands.\n\n==Constitutionality==\nThe Danish Realm's unique state of [[State (polity)|internal affairs]] is acted out in the principle of the \"unity of the Realm\".<ref name=\"unity of the realm\"/> This principle is derived from Article 1 of the [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish Constitution]] which specifies that constitutional law applies equally to all areas of the Danish Realm.<ref name=\"constitution\">[http://www.eu-oplysningen.dk/upload/application/pdf/0172b719/Constitution%20of%20Denmark.pdf%3Fdownload%3D1 Constitutional Act of Denmark].

Faroese or Greenlandic self-governance cannot be established by [[international law|international]] [[treaty|treaties]] but must be established by Danish law; the Danish parliament (the [[Folketing]]) delegates a precisely defined part of its competence to the [[#terminology|home rule]] authorities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Din\u0161\u1e6dein|first=Y\u00f4r\u0101m|title=Models of Autonomy|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=1412828848|page=36}}</ref>\n\nThe language of Denmark is [[Danish language|Danish]], and the Danish state authorities are based in Denmark. The Kingdom of Denmark's parliament, with its 179 members, is located in the capital, [[Copenhagen]]. Greenland and the Faroe Islands each elect two members to the parliament; the remaining 175 members are elected in Denmark. The Government ministries are located in Copenhagen, as is the highest court, the [[Supreme Court of Denmark|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"constitution\" />\n\n==Devolved powers==\n{{See also|Home rule|Politics of the Faroe Islands|Politics of Greenland}}\n\nIn principle, the Danish Realm constitutes a unified sovereign state, with equal status between its constituent parts.<ref name=\"commonwealth\" /> [[Devolution]] differs from [[federalism]] in that the devolved powers of the subnational authority ultimately reside in central government, thus the state remains ''[[de jure]]'' unitary.\n\nThe Self-Government Arrangements devolves political competence and responsibility from the Danish political authorities to the Faroese and the Greenlandic political authorities. The Faroese and Greenlandic authorities administer the tasks taken over from the state, enact legislation in these specific fields and have the economic responsibility for solving these tasks. The [[Politics of Denmark|Danish government]] provides an annual grant to the Faroese and the Greenlandic authorities to cover the costs of these devolved areas.<ref name=\"denmark.dk\" />\n\n[[File:Tinganes.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tinganes]], in the capital [[T\u00f3rshavn]], is the location of the Faroese Home Government.]]\n\nThe 1948 \"Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands\" sets out the terms of Faroese [[#Terminology|home rule]].

More significantly, the Act specifies the powers devolved from the Government of Denmark, including: [[local government]] and municipal affairs; [[taxation]], at a local and territorial level; [[public service]]s, including police and town planning; [[welfare state|welfare services]], such as housing; primary and secondary education; Archives, libraries, museums; [[agriculture]] and fishing; entertainment; among other areas.<ref name=\"Faroese home rule\" /> The Faroe Islands were previously administered as a [[counties of Denmark|Danish county]] (''amt''); the Home Rule Act abolished the post of ''Amtmand'' (County Governor) and replaced it with the role of ''Rigsombudsmand'' ([[High Commission of Denmark in the Faroe Islands#The High Commissioner of the Faroe Islands|High Commissioner of the Danish government]]).<ref name=\"Faroese home rule\" /> These powers were expanded in a 2005 Act, which named the Faroese home government as an \"equal partner\" with the Danish government.<ref>[https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=20991 retsinformation.dk ''Lov om de f\u00e6r\u00f8ske myndigheders overtagelse af sager og sagsomr\u00e5der'']{{in lang|da}} ''Denne lov bygger p\u00e5 en overenskomst mellem F\u00e6r\u00f8ernes landsstyre og den danske regering som ligev\u00e6rdige parter.''</ref>\n\nThe 1978 \"Greenland Home Rule Act\" devolves powers in much the same way as the Faroese Home Rule Act.

Additionally, the  Faroese and Greenlandic parliaments are subordinate to the [[Folketing|Parliament of the Kingdom of Denmark]], where the two territories are represented by two seats each (from a total of 179 seats).\n\n== Legal status ==\nThe Faroe Islands and Greenland have two seats each (out of 179) in the Danish parliament, ''Folketinget''.<ref>From Folketinget's website, List of all constituencies in the 2015 general election [http://www.ft.dk/dokumenter/publikationer/folketinget/medlemsfortegnelse%20efter%20valgkreds.aspx] for a readable PDF-file, please press \"Hent som PDF\"</ref>\nGreenland's powers of self-government were increased in 2009 through the Greenland Self-Rule Act, which established the Greenlanders as a separate national people under international law, while the Faroe Islands have gradually taken control of more and more areas of responsibility according to their Home Rule Act from 1948.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://logting.elektron.fo/logkjak/logir/Heimastyrislog/Heimastyrislogin%20donsk%20-%20LOV%20nr%20137%20af%2023-03-1948.htm|title=Logting.elektron.fo|publisher=}}</ref> The Faroese/Danish act of 2005 states: \"This law is based on an agreement between the Governments of the Faroe Islands and Denmark as equal partners.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=20991|title=Retsinformation.dk, Lov om de f\u00e6r\u00f8ske myndigheders overtagelse af sager og sagsomr\u00e5der|publisher=}}</ref> Despite this principle of unity among the three territories, some commentators consider the Danish Realm as a [[federation]] or a ''[[sui generis]]'' legal construction. In the opinion of [[Bogi Eliasen]], the Kingdom of Denmark is not a unitary state \"but a structure with some federative elements of divided power\".<ref name=\"commonwealth\" /> Danish justice [[Frederik Harhoff]] states that the Kingdom of Denmark is \"neither a federation (since it lacks a treaty to this effect), nor is it a [[confederation]]\".<ref name=\"commonwealth\" /> But the provisions for home rule are limited to internal matters only. Neither Greenland nor the Faroe Islands can write laws which concern the relationship with other states, nor laws that apply to the entire Realm; furthermore, the Supreme Court (Danish: ''H\u00f8jesteret'') in Copenhagen is the final legal instance, and legal matters from Greenland and the Faroe Islands must be prepared for that court, like any Danish matter.

Representatives for both have joined Danish delegations in discussions on some international matters, such as fishing rights. Greenlandic representatives were included in the process of a new treaty between Denmark and the US regarding the [[Thule Air Base]] in northwest Greenland.\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark as a whole is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[OECD]] and the [[World Trade Organization]]. The Faroe Islands and Greenland are associated members of the [[Nordic Council]] in their own right as part of the wider membership of the Kingdom. Although the Kingdom of Denmark is a member of the [[European Union]], both areas have special dispensation and remain outside the EU. Greenland joined the EU as part of Denmark in 1973, but [[1982 Greenlandic European Economic Community membership referendum|opted to leave]] in 1985 after Greenlandic home rule was introduced in 1979.\n\nThe \"Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands\" specifies that a 'Faroese' shall be understood to mean a person who is a \"''national'' of Denmark and a ''resident'' of the Faroe Islands\".<ref name=\"Faroese home rule\" /> The Government of Denmark issues special passports for its citizens living in the Faroe Islands and Greenland with the right to choose a regular [[Danish passport]] as well. The Faroese Home Rule Act states that, in [[Faroese passport]]s, ''F\u00f8royingur'' (Faroese) and ''F\u00f8royar'' (Faroe Islands) shall be inserted after the words ''Dansk'' (Danish) and ''Danmark'' (Denmark).<ref name=\"Faroese home rule\" />\n\n== Population and area ==\n{{Further|Geography of Denmark|Geography of Greenland|Geography of the Faroe Islands}}\n[[File:Kingdom of Denmark, administrative divisions - en - colored (zoom).svg|thumb|300px|right|Comparison map: Greenland, the Faroe Islands (enlarged) and Denmark differ significantly in size. The Danish Realm is spread far apart, across the North Atlantic Ocean and [[North Sea]].]]\n\nThe size of the Danish population is far greater than the population size of the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark proper has a population of about 5.6 million\npeople, while the populations of the Faroe Islands and Greenland are 48,000 and 56,000 people, respectively. A medium-sized Danish provincial town has,\nfor comparison, a population of about 50,000. With an area of over two million km\u00b2 (836,109 square miles), Greenland is the [[list of countries and territories by population density|most sparsely populated territory]] in the world.\n\nThe disparity between the small population of the former colonies and the greater population of Denmark proper has helped to enforce the dominant position that Denmark proper holds in the Realm.

In this arrangement, the Danish government deals with external matters such as defence and foreign affairs. Greenland and the Faroe Islands maintain their own elected assemblies and administrations, headed by a premier who appoints a cabinet. This is synonymous with \"self-governing\".\n\n; ''Selvstyre'': Following [[2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum|a referendum]] on 25 November 2008 (the 30th anniversary of the establishment of home rule in Greenland), the relationship between the Danish and Greenlandic governments changed, with Greenland gaining greater autonomy. Further powers were granted to the Greenlandic government on 21 June 2009, including control of the police force, coastguard, and courts. Additionally, Greenland now receives fewer Danish subsidies, becoming more self-sufficient.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7749427.stm Greenland votes for more autonomy] BBC News, 26 November 2008</ref> As a result of these changes Greenland was now said to have ''self rule'' with minimal support from Denmark, as opposed to \"home rule\".\n\n; ''Rigsombudsmand'': [[High Commissioners]] represent the interests of Denmark in the Faroe Islands and Greenland. There is one Danish High Commissioner in each territory. He or she can attend the meetings at the L\u00f8gting in the Faroes and at the Inatsisartut in Greenland, but they can't vote.\n\n; ''Folketingsmedlemmer fra F\u00e6r\u00f8erne og Gr\u00f8nland'': Members of the Folketing from the Faroe Islands and Greenland: Greenland and the Faroe Islands and their self-rule administrations take part in consultations on policies and decisions affecting their region, including negotiations with the devolved legislatures and the [[Folketing|Danish parliament (''Folketing'')]].
