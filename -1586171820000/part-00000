In his later years he was [[artist-in-residence]] at the [[McMichael Gallery]] in [[Kleinburg, Ontario]].<ref name = NGC/><ref>[https://www.utoronto.ca/gallery/collection_pages/jackson.htm ] {{webarchive. |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120043109/http://www.utoronto.ca/gallery/collection_pages/jackson.htm |date=November 20, 2005 }}</ref>\n\n== Early life and training ==\nAs a young boy, Jackson worked as an office boy for a [[lithograph]] company, after his father abandoned his family of six children. It was at this company that Jackson began his art training. In the evenings, he took classes at Montreal's [[Monument-National]].\n\nIn 1905, Jackson worked his way to [[Europe]] on a cattle boat, returning by the same means and travelling on to [[Chicago]]. In Chicago, he joined a commercial art firm and took courses at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. He saved his earnings and, by 1907, was able to visit [[France]] to study [[Impressionism]]. In France, Jackson decided to become a professional painter, studying at [[Paris]]' [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]]<ref name = NGC/> under [[Jean-Paul Laurens|J. P. Laurens]]. Some of his most important artistic development was at the [[Etaples art colony]], which he first visited in 1908 with his New Zealand friend [[Eric Spencer Macky]] (1880\u20131958). Jackson painted his ''Paysage Embrum\u00e9'' then and, rather to his surprise, it was accepted by the Paris Salon.<ref name=\"Larsen\">{{cite book|last1=Larsen|first1=Wayne|title=A.Y.

Y. Jackson).jpg|thumb|left|''Red Maple'' (1914), by A. Y. Jackson]]\n\nWhen Jackson returned to Canada, he settled in Sweetsburg, [[Quebec]], where he began painting works such as the Neo-Impressionist \"The Edge of Maple Wood\". He held his first single artist exhibition at the Montreal Art Gallery with Randolph Hewton in 1913. Unable to make ends meet and discouraged by the Canadian art scene, he considered moving to the United States. However, he received a letter from [[J. E. H. MacDonald]] which changed his mind. MacDonald inquired about ''The Edge of Maple Wood'', which he had seen at a Toronto art show, informing Jackson that Toronto artist [[Lawren Harris]] wanted to purchase the painting if he still owned it.\n\nAfter the purchase, Jackson struck up a correspondence with the two Toronto artists, often debating on topics related to Canadian art. Jackson soon began visiting Toronto. Dr. [[James MacCallum]] convinced Jackson to relocate to Toronto by offering to buy enough of his paintings for one year to guarantee him a living income.<ref name=\"Klages\">{{cite book|last1=Klages|first1=Gregory|title=The Many Deaths of Tom Thomson: Separating Fact from Fiction|date=2016|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=9781459731974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7tAkCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=20 November 2016|language=en}}</ref>{{rp|24}} He moved into the [[Studio Building (Toronto)|Studio Building]] which was financed by Lawren Harris, heir to the Massey-Harris farm machinery fortune, and Dr. James MacCallum. Harris, overseeing construction of the building, was too busy to concentrate on his own artistic endeavours and loaned his own studio space, over the Commerce Bank branch at the northwest corner of Yonge and Bloor streets, to the newly arrived Montrealer, A. Y. Jackson. The spot is now occupied by the 34-storey 2 Bloor West. Jackson was a welcome addition to the Toronto art scene, having traveled in Europe and bringing with him a respected&nbsp;\u2013 though as yet not particularly successful&nbsp;\u2013 talent. The canvas taking shape while he waited to move into the Studio Building, ''Terre Sauvage'', became one of his most famous. In January 1914 the Studio Building was ready for occupation. [[Tom Thomson]] was another of the first residents of the building and shared a studio with Jackson for a year.<ref name=Klages/>{{rp|24}}<ref name=\"en.wikipedia.org\">[[Studio Building (Toronto)]]</ref> Like the other Group of Seven painters, Jackson embraced landscape themes and sought to develop a bold style. An avid outdoorsman, Jackson became good friends with [[Tom Thomson]], and the duo often fished and sketched together, beginning with a trip to Algonquin Park in fall 1914.<ref name=Klages/>{{rp|25}} Inspired by Thomson, Jackson and the other painters who would one day be known as the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] undertook trips to [[Algonquin Park]], [[Georgian Bay]], [[Algoma District, Ontario|Algoma]] and the [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore]].\n\nWith the outbreak of [[World War I]], Jackson enlisted in the [[Canadian Forces Land Force Command|Canadian Army]]'s 60th battalion in 1915. Soon after he reached the front he was wounded at the Battle of Sanctuary Wood in June 1916 and found himself once more at \u00c9taples in the hospital there.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WGjfZPizNQIC&pg=PT99&lpg=PT99&dq=Arthur+Baker+Clack+Etaples#v=onepage&q=%20%C3%89taples%20&f=false |title=Defiant Spirits: The Modernist Revolution of the Group of Seven - Ross King - Google Books |date= 2010-09-25|accessdate=2014-07-26|isbn=9781553658078 |last1=King |first1=Ross }}</ref> While recovering from his injuries, he came to the attention of [[Lord Beaverbrook]].<ref name=\"Brandon\">{{cite book|last1=Brandon|first1=Laura|title=Art and war|date=2007|publisher=I.B.

He removed Tom Thomson's easel, made by Thomson's own hand, from his studio and used it for all the subsequent pictures he produced in the Studio Building. Shortly after he returned from wintering on Georgian Bay, he learned that in his absence he had been included in an informal group of Studio Building artists, exhibiting for the first time, called the Group of Seven.<ref name=\"en.wikipedia.org\"/>\n\nThe [[Beaver Hall Group]] was formed in Montreal in May 1920 with A. Y. Jackson as president. In his opening speech, Jackson emphasized the right of the artist to paint what they feel \"with utter disregard for what has hitherto been considered requisite to the acceptance of the work at the recognized art exhibitions in Canadian centres. \"Schools and 'isms' do not trouble us\", he maintained, \"individual expression is our chief concern\".<ref name=\"Meadowcraft\">{{cite book|last1=Meadowcroft|first1=Barbara|title=Painting friends : the Beaver Hall women painters|date=2000|publisher=V\u00e9hicule Press|location=[Montr\u00e9al]|isbn=9781550651256|edition=[Nachdr.]|oclc=45044300}}</ref> He identified its goals as being those of the Group of Seven, and over the years Jackson maintained the contact between Toronto and Montreal, supporting and stimulating the Montreal artists through regular visits and correspondence.

In his later years he was [[artist-in-residence]] at the [[McMichael Gallery]] in [[Kleinburg, Ontario]].<ref name = NGC/><ref>[https://www.utoronto.ca/gallery/collection_pages/jackson.htm ] {{webarchive. |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120043109/http://www.utoronto.ca/gallery/collection_pages/jackson.htm |date=November 20, 2005 }}</ref>\n\n== Early life and training ==\nAs a young boy, Jackson worked as an office boy for a [[lithograph]] company, after his father abandoned his family of six children. It was at this company that Jackson began his art training. In the evenings, he took classes at Montreal's [[Monument-National]].\n\nIn 1905, Jackson worked his way to [[Europe]] on a cattle boat, returning by the same means and travelling on to [[Chicago]]. In Chicago, he joined a commercial art firm and took courses at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. He saved his earnings and, by 1907, was able to visit [[France]] to study [[Impressionism]]. In France, Jackson decided to become a professional painter, studying at [[Paris]]' [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]]<ref name = NGC/> under [[Jean-Paul Laurens|J. P. Laurens]]. Some of his most important artistic development was at the [[Etaples art colony]], which he first visited in 1908 with his New Zealand friend [[Eric Spencer Macky]] (1880\u20131958). Jackson painted his ''Paysage Embrum\u00e9'' then and, rather to his surprise, it was accepted by the Paris Salon.<ref name=\"Larsen\">{{cite book|last1=Larsen|first1=Wayne|title=A.Y.

Y. Jackson).jpg|thumb|left|''Red Maple'' (1914), by A. Y. Jackson]]\n\nWhen Jackson returned to Canada, he settled in Sweetsburg, [[Quebec]], where he began painting works such as the Neo-Impressionist \"The Edge of Maple Wood\". He held his first single artist exhibition at the Montreal Art Gallery with Randolph Hewton in 1913. Unable to make ends meet and discouraged by the Canadian art scene, he considered moving to the United States. However, he received a letter from [[J. E. H. MacDonald]] which changed his mind. MacDonald inquired about ''The Edge of Maple Wood'', which he had seen at a Toronto art show, informing Jackson that Toronto artist [[Lawren Harris]] wanted to purchase the painting if he still owned it.\n\nAfter the purchase, Jackson struck up a correspondence with the two Toronto artists, often debating on topics related to Canadian art. Jackson soon began visiting Toronto. Dr. [[James MacCallum]] convinced Jackson to relocate to Toronto by offering to buy enough of his paintings for one year to guarantee him a living income.<ref name=\"Klages\">{{cite book|last1=Klages|first1=Gregory|title=The Many Deaths of Tom Thomson: Separating Fact from Fiction|date=2016|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=9781459731974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7tAkCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=20 November 2016|language=en}}</ref>{{rp|24}} He moved into the [[Studio Building (Toronto)|Studio Building]] which was financed by Lawren Harris, heir to the Massey-Harris farm machinery fortune, and Dr. James MacCallum. Harris, overseeing construction of the building, was too busy to concentrate on his own artistic endeavours and loaned his own studio space, over the Commerce Bank branch at the northwest corner of Yonge and Bloor streets, to the newly arrived Montrealer, A. Y. Jackson. The spot is now occupied by the 34-storey 2 Bloor West. Jackson was a welcome addition to the Toronto art scene, having traveled in Europe and bringing with him a respected&nbsp;\u2013 though as yet not particularly successful&nbsp;\u2013 talent. The canvas taking shape while he waited to move into the Studio Building, ''Terre Sauvage'', became one of his most famous. In January 1914 the Studio Building was ready for occupation. [[Tom Thomson]] was another of the first residents of the building and shared a studio with Jackson for a year.<ref name=Klages/>{{rp|24}}<ref name=\"en.wikipedia.org\">[[Studio Building (Toronto)]]</ref> Like the other Group of Seven painters, Jackson embraced landscape themes and sought to develop a bold style.

Soon after he reached the front he was wounded at the Battle of Sanctuary Wood in June 1916 and found himself once more at \u00c9taples in the hospital there.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WGjfZPizNQIC&pg=PT99&lpg=PT99&dq=Arthur+Baker+Clack+Etaples#v=onepage&q=%20%C3%89taples%20&f=false |title=Defiant Spirits: The Modernist Revolution of the Group of Seven - Ross King - Google Books |date= 2010-09-25|accessdate=2014-07-26|isbn=9781553658078 |last1=King |first1=Ross }}</ref> While recovering from his injuries, he came to the attention of [[Lord Beaverbrook]].<ref name=\"Brandon\">{{cite book|last1=Brandon|first1=Laura|title=Art and war|date=2007|publisher=I.B.

He removed Tom Thomson's easel, made by Thomson's own hand, from his studio and used it for all the subsequent pictures he produced in the Studio Building. Shortly after he returned from wintering on Georgian Bay, he learned that in his absence he had been included in an informal group of Studio Building artists, exhibiting for the first time, called the Group of Seven.<ref name=\"en.wikipedia.org\"/>\n\nThe [[Beaver Hall Group]] was formed in Montreal in May 1920 with A. Y. Jackson as president. In his opening speech, Jackson emphasized the right of the artist to paint what they feel \"with utter disregard for what has hitherto been considered requisite to the acceptance of the work at the recognized art exhibitions in Canadian centres. \"Schools and 'isms' do not trouble us\", he maintained, \"individual expression is our chief concern\".<ref name=\"Meadowcraft\">{{cite book|last1=Meadowcroft|first1=Barbara|title=Painting friends : the Beaver Hall women painters|date=2000|publisher=V\u00e9hicule Press|location=[Montr\u00e9al]|isbn=9781550651256|edition=[Nachdr.]|oclc=45044300}}</ref> He identified its goals as being those of the Group of Seven, and over the years Jackson maintained the contact between Toronto and Montreal, supporting and stimulating the Montreal artists through regular visits and correspondence.

The international relations of minor countries are covered in their own history articles. This era covers the period from the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315), to the end of the [[Diplomatic history of World War I|First World War]] and the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. For the previous era see [[International relations, 1648\u20131814]]. For the 1920s and 1930s see [[International relations (1919\u20131939)]].\n\nImportant themes include the rapid industrialization and growing power of Britain, France and Prussia/Germany, and, later in the period, the United States and Japan. This led to [[imperialism|imperialist]] and [[colonialism|colonialist]] competitions for influence and power throughout the world, most famously the [[Scramble for Africa]] in the 1880s and 1890s. The reverberations are still widespread and consequential in the 21st century. Britain established an informal economic network that, combined with its colonies and its Royal Navy, made it the hegemonic nation until its power was challenged by the united Germany. It was a largely peaceful century, with no wars between the great powers, apart from the 1854\u20131871 interval, and some small wars between Russia and the Ottoman Empire. After 1900 there were a series of wars in the Balkan region, which exploded out of control into [[Diplomatic history of World War I|World War I]] (1914\u20131918)\u2014a massively devastating event that was unexpected in its timing, duration, casualties, and long-term impact.\n\nIn 1814 diplomats recognised five Great Powers: France, Britain, Russia, Austria (in 1867\u20131918, Austria\u2013Hungary) and [[Prussia]] (in 1871 the German Empire). Italy was added to this group after [[Risorgimento|its unification]] and on the eve of the First World War there were two major blocs in Europe: the [[Triple Entente]] formed by [[French Third Republic|France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] formed by [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]. The [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Restoration (Spain)|Spain]], and [[Switzerland]] were smaller powers. [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]], and [[Principality of Albania|Albania]] initially operated as autonomous vassals for they were legally still part of the declining [[Ottoman Empire]], which may also be included among the major powers, before gaining their independence.<ref>Carlton J.

The [[Treaty of Chaumont]] of March 1814 reaffirmed decisions that had been made already and which would be ratified by the more important Congress of Vienna of 1814\u201315. They included the establishment of a [[German Confederation|confederated Germany]] including both Austria and Prussia (plus the Czech lands), the division of French protectorates and annexations into independent states, the restoration of the Bourbon kings of Spain, the enlargement of the Netherlands to include what in 1830 became modern Belgium, and the continuation of British subsidies to its allies.

The [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)]] ended the military occupation of France and adjusted downward the 700 million francs the French were obligated to pay as reparations. The Russian tsar proposed the formation of an entirely new alliance, to include all of the signatories from the Vienna treaties, to guarantee the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and preservation of the ruling governments of all members of this new coalition. The tsar further proposed an international army, with the Russian army as its nucleus, to provide the wherewithal to intervene in any country that needed it. Lord Castlereagh saw this as a highly undesirable commitment to reactionary policies. He recoiled at the idea of Russian armies marching across Europe to put down popular uprisings. Furthermore, to admit all the smaller countries would create intrigue and confusion.

It wanted to support the [[Ottoman Empire]] as a bulwark against Russian expansionism. It opposed interventions designed to suppress democracy, and was especially worried that France and Spain planned to suppress the independence movement underway in Latin America.

Trade was handled by neutral American and Dutch traders. The colonies set up temporary governments or juntas which were effectively independent from Spain. The division exploded between Spaniards who were born in Spain (called ''peninsulares'') versus those of Spanish descent born in [[New Spain]] (called ''criollos'' in Spanish or \"creoles\" in English). The two groups wrestled for power, with the ''criollos'' leading the call for independence and eventually winning that independence.

Repeated attempts to regain control failed, as Spain had no help from European powers. Indeed, Britain and the United States worked against Spain, enforcing the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. British merchants and bankers took a dominant role in Latin America. In 1824, the armies of generals [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] of Argentina and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] of Venezuela defeated the last Spanish forces; the final defeat came at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] in southern [[History of Peru|Peru]]. After the loss of its colonies, Spain played a minor role in international affairs. Spain kept Cuba, which repeatedly revolted in three wars of independence, culminating in the [[Cuban War of Independence]]. The United States demanded reforms from Spain, which Spain refused.

However Russia's ambitions in the region were seen as a major geostrategic threat by the other European powers. Austria feared the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire would destabilize its southern borders. Russia gave strong emotional support for the fellow [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christian]] Greeks. The British were motivated by strong public support for the Greeks.

Third he promoted the spread of constitutional Liberal governments like in Britain, along the model of the 1832 Reform Act. He therefore welcomed liberal revolutions as in France (1830),  and Greece (1843). Fourth he promoted British nationalism, looking for advantages for his nation as an the Belgian revolt of 1830 and the Italian unification of 1859. He avoided wars, and operated with only a very small British Army. He felt the best way to promote peace was to maintain a balance of power to prevent any nation\u2014especially France or Russia\u2014from dominating Europe.<ref>Norman Lowe, ''Mastering Modern British History'' (3rd ed. 1998) p. 111. </ref><ref>Muriel E.

Tens of thousands of people were killed, and many more were forced into exile. Significant lasting reforms included the abolition of [[serfdom]] in Austria and Hungary, the end of [[absolute monarchy]] in Denmark, and the introduction of [[representative democracy]] in the Netherlands.

Russia denounced this claim, since it claimed to be the protector of all Eastern Orthodox Christians in the Ottoman Empire. France sent its fleet to the Black Sea; Russia responded with its own show of force. In 1851, Russia sent troops into the Ottoman provinces of Moldavia and Wallachia. Britain, now fearing for the security of the Ottoman Empire, sent a fleet to join with the French expecting the Russians would back down. Diplomatic efforts failed. The Sultan declared war against Russia in October 1851. Following an Ottoman naval disaster in November, Britain and France declared war against Russia.

The Powers promised to respect Ottoman independence and territorial integrity. Russia gave up a little land and relinquished its claim to a protectorate over the Christians in the Ottoman domains. In a major blow to Russian power and prestige, the Black Sea was demilitarized, and an international commission was set up to guarantee freedom of commerce and navigation on the Danube River.

In the long run the war marked a turning point in Russian domestic and foreign policy. Russia's  military demonstrated its weakness, its poor leadership, and its lack of modern weapons and technology. Russia's weak economy was unable to fully support its military adventures, so in the future it redirected its attention to much weaker Muslim areas in central Asia, and left Europe alone. Russian intellectuals used the humiliating defeat to demand fundamental reform of the government and social system. The war weakened both Russia and Austria, so they could no longer promote stability. This opened the way for Napoleon III, [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Cavour]] (in Italy) and [[Otto von Bismarck]] (in Germany) to launch a series of wars in the 1860s that reshaped Europe.<ref>Stephen J.

The two provinces had long been under Ottoman control, but both Russia and Austria also wanted them, making the region a site of conflict in the 19th century.

He facilitated a French company building the [[Suez Canal]], which Britain could not stop. In Europe, however, Napoleon failed again and again.  The Crimean war of 1854\u20131856 produced no gains. [[Second Italian War of Independence|War with Austria]] in 1859 facilitated the unification of Italy, and Napoleon was rewarded with the annexation of Savoy and Nice. The British grew annoyed at his intervention in Syria in 1860\u201361. He angered Catholics alarmed at his poor treatment of the Pope, then reversed himself and angered the anticlerical liberals at home and his erstwhile Italian allies. He lowered the tariffs, which helped in the long run but in the short run angered owners of large estates and the textile and iron industrialists, while leading worried workers to organize. Matters grew worse in the 1860s as Napoleon nearly blundered into war with the United States in 1862, while his Mexican intervention in 1861\u20131867 was a total disaster. Finally in the end he went to war with Prussia in 1870 when it was too late to stop the unification of all Germans, aside from Austria, under the leadership of Prussia. Napoleon had alienated everyone; after failing to obtain an alliance with Austria and Italy, France had no allies and was bitterly divided at home.

Doyle, ''The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War'' (2017).</ref> British and French aristocratic leaders personally disliked American republicanism and favoured the more aristocratic Confederacy. The South was also by far the chief source of cotton for European textile mills. The goal of the Confederacy was to obtain British and French intervention, that is, war against the Union. Confederates believed (with scant evidence) that \"[[King Cotton|cotton is king]]\" \u2013 that is, cotton was so essential to British and French industry that they would fight to get it. The Confederates did raise money in Europe, which they used to buy warships and munitions. However Britain had a large surplus of cotton in 1861; stringency did not come until 1862. Most important was the dependence on grain from the U.S. North for a large portion of the British food supply, France would not intervene alone, and in any case was less interested in cotton than in securing its control of Mexico. The Confederacy would allow that if it secured its independence, but the Union never would approve.<ref>Lynn Marshall Case and Warren F.

The British people generally favored the United States. What little cotton was available came from New York City, as the blockade by the U.S. Navy shut down 95% of Southern exports to Britain. In September 1862, during the Confederate invasion of Maryland, Britain (along with France) contemplated stepping in and negotiating a peace settlement, which could only mean war with the United States. But in the same month, US president [[Abraham Lincoln]] announced the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].

To do it, he engaged in a series of short, decisive wars with Denmark, Austria and France.

The Danish and German duchies of Schleswig-Holstein were, by international agreement, ruled by the king of Denmark but were not legally part of Denmark. An international treaty provided that the two territories were not to be separated from each other, though Holstein was part of the German Confederation. In the late 1840s, with both German and Danish nationalism on the rise, Denmark attempted to incorporate Schleswig into its kingdom. [[First Schleswig War|The first war]] was a Danish victory.

He retained control over Prussia and as well as the foreign and domestic policies of the new German Empire.  Bismarck had built his reputation as a war-maker but changed overnight into a peacemaker. He skillfully used [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]], it was Bismarck who \"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers\".<ref>[[Eric Hobsbawm]], ''The Age of Empire: 1875\u20131914'' (1987),  p. 312.</ref>\n\nBismarck's main mistake was giving in to the Army and to intense public demand in Germany for acquisition of the border provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, thereby turning France into a permanent, deeply-committed enemy (''see'' [[French\u2013German enmity]]).

It had come dangerously close to intervening in the American Civil War in 1861\u20131862, and in May 1871 it signed the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]] with the United States that put into arbitration the American claims that the lack of British neutrality had prolong the war; arbitrators eventually awarded the United States $15 million.<ref>Hayes, ''A Generation of Materialism, 1871\u20131900'' (1941),  pp 2-3.</ref>  Russia took advantage of the Franco-Prussian war to renounce the 1856 treaty in which it had been forced to demilitarize the Black Sea.  Repudiation of treaties was unacceptable to the powers, so the solution was a conference in January 1871 at London that formally abrogated key elements of the 1856 treaty and endorsed the new Russian action.  Russia had always wanted control of Constantinople and the straits that connected the Black Sea to the Mediterranean and would nearly achieve that in the First World War.<ref>Hayes, ''A Generation of Materialism, 1871\u20131900'' (1941),  pp 3-4.</ref>  France had long stationed an army in Rome to protect the pope; it recalled the soldiers in 1870, and the Kingdom of Italy moved in, [[Capture of Rome|seized the remaining papal territories]], and made Rome its capital city in 1871 ending the [[risorgimento]].

Training took place in peacetime, and in wartime a much larger, well-trained, fully staffed army could be mobilized very quickly.  Prussia had started in 1814, and the Prussian triumphs of the 1860s made its model irresistible. The key element was universal conscription, with relatively few exemptions.  The upper strata was drafted into the officer corps for one year's training, but was nevertheless required to do its full reserve duty along with everyone else. Austria adopted the system in 1868 (shortly after its defeat by Prussia) and France In 1872 (shortly after its defeat by Prussia and other German states).  Japan followed in 1873, Russia in 1874, and Italy in 1875.  All major countries adopted conscription by 1900, except for Great Britain and the United States.  By then peacetime Germany had an army of 545,000, which could be expanded in a matter of days to 3.4 million by calling up the reserves.  The comparable numbers in France were 1.8 million and 3.5 million; Austria, 1.1 million and 2.6 million; Russia, 1.7 million to 4 million.  The new system was expensive, with a per capita cost of the forces doubling or even tripling between 1870 and 1914.  By then total defense spending averaged about 5% of the national income.  Nevertheless, taxpayers seemed satisfied; parents were especially impressed with the dramatic improvements shown in the immature boys they sent away at age 18, compared to the worldly-wise men who returned two years later.<ref>Hale, ''The Great Illusion: 1900\u20131914'' pp 21-27.</ref>\n\n==Imperialism==\n{{further information|New Imperialism}}\n[[File:Afrikakonferenz.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Berlin Conference (1884)]] chaired by German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] regulated European imperialism in Africa.]]\n\nMost of the major powers (and some minor ones such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark) engaged in imperialism, building up their overseas empires especially in Africa and Asia. Although there were numerous insurrections, historians count only a few wars, and they were small-scale: [[Boer Wars|two Anglo-Boer Wars]] (1880\u20131881 and 1899\u20131902), [[Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895)|the Sino-Japanese War]] (1894\u20131895), [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]] (1895\u201396), [[Spanish\u2013American War]] (1898),  and [[Italo-Turkish War|Italo-Ottoman war]] (1911). The largest was the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1905, the only in which two major powers fought each other.<ref>Raymond F. Betts, ''Europe Overseas: Phases of Imperialism'' (1968) [https://www.questia.com/library/99891256/europe-overseas-phases-of-imperialism online]</ref>\n\nAmong the main empires from 1875 to 1914, historians assess a mixed record in terms of profitability. The assumption was that colonies would provide an excellent captive market for manufactured items. Apart from India, this was seldom true. By the 1890s, imperialists gained economic benefit primarily in the production of inexpensive raw materials to feed the domestic manufacturing sector. Overall, Great Britain profited well from India, but not from most of the rest of its empire. The Netherlands did very well in the East Indies. Germany and Italy got very little trade or raw materials from their empires. France did slightly better. The Belgian Congo was notoriously profitable when it was a capitalistic rubber plantation owned and operated by King Leopold II as a private enterprise. However, scandal after scandal regarding badly mistreated labour led the international community to force the government of Belgium to take it over in 1908, and it became much less profitable. The Philippines cost the United States much more than expected.<ref>Oron J.

Spain and Britain soon withdrew after realizing that Napoleon III intended to overthrow the Mexican government under elected president [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and establish a [[Second Mexican Empire]]. Napoleon had the support of the remnants of the Conservative elements that Juarez and his Liberals had defeated in the [[Reform War]], a civil war from 1857\u201361. In the [[French intervention in Mexico]] in 1862. Napoleon installed Austrian archduke [[Maximilian of Habsburg]] as emperor of Mexico. Ju\u00e1rez rallied opposition to the French; Washington supported Ju\u00e1rez and refused to recognize the new government because it violated the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. After its victory over the Confederacy in 1865, the U.S. sent 50,000 experienced combat troops to the Mexican border to make clear its position. Napoleon was stretched very thin; he had committed 40,000 troops to Mexico, 20,000 to Rome to guard the Pope against the Italians, and another 80,000 in restive Algeria. Furthermore, Prussia, having just defeated Austria, was an imminent threat. Napoleon realized his predicament and withdrew all his forces from Mexico in 1866. Juarez regained control and executed the hapless emperor.<ref>{{cite book|author=Don H.

By 1850 [[European exploration of Africa|European explorers]] had begun mapping the interior. Three developments encouraged European interest in East Africa.  First was the emergence of the island of [[Zanzibar]], located off the east coast. It became a base from which trade and exploration of the African mainland could be mounted.<ref>Robin Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875: A Modern History,'' (1974) p. 560.</ref>\n\nBy 1840, to protect the interests of the various nationals doing business in Zanzibar, consul offices had been opened by the British, French, Germans and Americans. In 1859, the tonnage of foreign shipping calling at Zanzibar had reached 19,000 tons. By 1879, the tonnage of this shipping had reached 89,000 tons. The second development spurring European interest in Africa was the growing European demand for products of Africa including ivory and cloves. Thirdly, British interest in East Africa was first stimulated by their desire to abolish the slave trade.<ref>Hallett, ''Africa to 1875'', pp. 560\u201361</ref> Later in the century, British interest in East Africa was stimulated by German competition, and in 1887 the Imperial British East Africa Company, a private concern, leased from Seyyid Said his mainland holdings, a 10-mile (16-km)-wide strip of land along the coast.\n\nGermany set up a protectorate over the [[Sultan of Zanzibar]]'s coastal possessions in 1885.  It traded its coastal holdings to Britain in 1890, in exchange for German control over the coast of [[Tanganyika]].\n\nIn 1895 the British government claimed the interior as far west as Lake Naivasha; it set up the '''[[East Africa Protectorate]]'''. The border was extended to Uganda in 1902, and in 1920 most of the enlarged protectorate became a crown colony. With the beginning of colonial rule in 1895, the Rift Valley and the surrounding Highlands became the enclave of white immigrants engaged in large-scale coffee farming dependent on mostly Kikuyu labour. There were no significant mineral resources\u2014none of the gold or diamonds that attracted so many to South Africa.  In the initial stage of colonial rule, the administration relied on traditional communicators, usually chiefs. When colonial rule was established and efficiency was sought, partly because of settler pressure, newly educated younger men were associated with old chiefs in local Native Councils.<ref>R. Mugo Gatheru, ''Kenya: From Colonization to Independence, 1888\u20131970'' (2005)</ref>\n\nFollowing severe financial difficulties of the [[British East Africa Company]], the British government on 1 July 1895 established direct rule through the [[British East Africa|East African Protectorate]], subsequently opening (1902) the fertile highlands to white settlers. A key to the development of Kenya's interior was the construction, started in 1895, of a railway from Mombasa to [[Kisumu]], on [[Lake Victoria]], completed in 1901.  Some 32,000 workers were imported from British India to do the manual labour. Many stayed, as did most of the Indian traders and small businessmen who saw opportunity in the opening up of the interior of Kenya.<ref>John M.

Portugal also established trading stations open to all nations off the coasts of Africa, South Asia, and East Asia. Portugal had imported slaves as domestic servants and farm workers in Portugal itself, and used its experience to make slave trading a major economic activity.  Portuguese businessmen set up slave plantations on the nearby islands of Madeira, Cape Verde, and the Azores, focusing on sugar production. In 1770, the enlightened despot [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Pombal]] declared trade to be a noble and necessary profession, allowing businessmen to enter the Portuguese nobility.

In the Scramble for Africa of the 1880s, leaders of the new nation of Italy were enthusiastic about acquiring colonies in Africa, expecting it would legitimize their status as a power and help unify the people. In North Africa Italy first turned to Tunis, under nominal Ottoman control, where many Italian farmers had settled. Weak and diplomatically isolated, Italy was helpless and angered when France assumed a protectorate over Tunis in 1881.  Turning to East Africa, Italy tried to conquer independent Ethiopia, but was massively defeated at the [[Battle of Adwa]] in 1896.  Public opinion was angered at the national humiliation by an inept government. In 1911 the Italian people supported the seizure of what is now Libya.<ref>Giuseppe Maria Finaldi, ''Italian National Identity in the Scramble for Africa: Italy's African Wars in the Era of Nation-Building, 1870\u20131900'' (2010)</ref>\n\nItalian diplomacy over a twenty-year period succeeded in getting permission to seize Libya, with approval coming from Germany, France, Austria, Britain and Russia.

In the harsh [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] of April 1895, China recognize the independence of Korea, and ceded to Japan Formosa, the Pescatores Islands and the Liaotung Peninsula. China further paid an indemnity of 200 million silver taels, opened five new ports to international trade,  and allowed Japan (and other Western powers) to set up and operate factories in these cities.  However, Russia, France, and Germany saw themselves disadvantaged by the treaty and in the [[Triple Intervention]] forced Japan to return the Liaotung Peninsula in return for a larger indemnity.  The only positive result for China came when those factories led the industrialization of urban China, spinning off a local class of entrepreneurs and skilled mechanics.<ref>{{cite book|author=William T.

The [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) built [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]]. They soon began to rule the natives. China took control in the 1660s, and sent in settlers. By the 1890s there were about 2.3 million Han Chinese and 200,000 members of indigenous tribes. After its victory in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1894\u201395, the peace treaty ceded the island to Japan. It was Japan's first colony.<ref>Jonathan Manthorpe, ''Forbidden Nation: A History of Taiwan'' (2008) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0230614248/ excerpt and text search], Ch. 10\u201312</ref>\n\nJapan expected far more benefits from the occupation of Taiwan than the limited benefits it actually received. Japan realized that its home islands could only support a limited resource base, and it hoped that Taiwan, with its fertile farmlands, would make up the shortage.  By 1905, Taiwan was producing rice and sugar and paying for itself with a small surplus. Perhaps more important, Japan gained Asia-wide prestige by being the first non-European country to operate a modern colony.  It learned how to adjust its German-based bureaucratic standards to actual conditions, and how to deal with frequent insurrections. The ultimate goal was to promote Japanese language and culture, but the administrators realized they first had to adjust to the Chinese culture of the people.  Japan had a civilizing mission, and it opened schools so that the peasants could become productive and patriotic manual workers.  Medical facilities were modernized, and the death rate plunged.  To maintain order, Japan installed a police state that closely monitored everyone. In 1945, Japan was stripped of its empire and Taiwan was returned to China.<ref>Manthorpe, ''Forbidden Nation: A History of Taiwan''  (2008)  ch 13</ref>\n\n====Japan defeats Russia, 1904\u20131905====\n{{Main|Russo-Japanese War}}\nJapan felt humiliated when the spoils from its decisive victory over China were partly reversed by the Western Powers (including Russia), which revised the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]]. The [[Boxer Rebellion]] of 1899\u20131901 saw Japan and Russia as allies who fought together against the Chinese, with Russians playing the leading role on the battlefield.<ref>Petr E.

Japan offered to recognize Russian dominance in [[Manchuria]] in exchange for recognition of Korea as being within the Japanese sphere of influence. Russia refused and demanded Korea north of the [[39th parallel north|39th parallel]] to be a neutral buffer zone between Russia and Japan. The Japanese government decided on war to stop the perceived Russian threat to its plans for expansion into Asia.<ref>Ian Hill Nish, ''The Origins of the Russo\u2013Japanese War'' (1985). </ref> The Japanese Navy opened hostilities by a surprise attacks on the Russian Eastern Fleet at [[L\u00fcshunkou District|Port Arthur]], China. Russia suffered multiple defeats but [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] fought on with the expectation that Russia would win decisive naval battles. When that proved illusory he fought to preserve the dignity of Russia by averting a \"humiliating peace\".  The complete victory of the Japanese military surprised world observers. The consequences transformed the balance of power in East Asia, resulting in a reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. It was the first major military victory in the modern era of an Asian power over a European one.<ref> Geoffrey Jukes, ''The Russo-Japanese War 1904\u20131905'' (2002) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1841764469/ excerpt]</ref> \n====Korea====\nIn 1905, the Empire of Japan and the Korean Empire signed the [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1905|Eulsa Treaty]], which brought Korea into the Japanese sphere of influence as a protectorate. The Treaty was a result of the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War and Japan wanting to increase its hold over the Korean Peninsula. The Eulsa Treaty led to the signing of the [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1907|1907 Treaty]] two years later. The 1907 Treaty ensured that Korea would act under the guidance of a Japanese resident general and Korean internal affairs would be under Japanese control. Korean Emperor [[Gojong of Korea|Gojong]] was forced to abdicate in favour of his son, [[Sunjong of Korea|Sunjong]], as he protested Japanese actions in the Hague Conference.

The [[Second Boer War]] (1899 \u2013 1902) was fought by Britain against and the two independent [[Boer]] republics of the [[Orange Free State]] and the [[South African Republic]] (called the Transvaal by the British).

There was a high risk this would lead to major confrontations between Austria-Hungary and Russia, and between Russian and Great Britain. Russia especially wanted control of Constantinople in the straits connecting the Black Sea with the Mediterranean. British policy had long been to support the Ottoman Empire against Russian expansion. However, In 1876 William Gladstone added a new dimension  escalated the conflict by emphasizing Ottoman atrocities against Christians in Bulgaria. The atrocities - plus Ottoman attacks on Armenians, and Russian attacks on Jews -, attracted public attention across Europe and lessen the chances of quiet compromises.<ref>Matthew Smith Anderson, ''The Eastern question, 1774-1923: A study in international relations'' (1966).</ref><ref>Nevill Forbes, et al.

After 1900, the large Arab population would also grow nationalistic. The threat of disintegration was real. Egypt for example although still nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, have been independent for century. Turkish nationalists were emerging, and the [[Young Turk]] movement indeed took over the Empire. While the previous rulers had been pluralistic, the Young Turks were hostile to all other nationalities and to non-Muslims. Wars were usually defeats, in which another slice of territory was sliced off and became semi-independent, including Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Romania, Bosnia, and Albania.<ref> Justin McCarthy, ''The Ottoman Turks: An Introductory History to 1923'' (1997) pp 306-7.

It was operated by and for the Habsburg family, who demanded loyalty to the throne, but not to the nation. Nationalistic movements were growing rapidly. The most powerful were the Hungarians, who preserved their separate status within the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and with the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the creation of the Dual Monarchy they were getting practical equality. Other minorities, were highly frustrated, although some \u2013 especially the Jews \u2013 felt protected by the Empire. German nationalists, especially in the Sudetenland (part of Bohemia) however, looked to Berlin in the new German Empire.<ref>Solomon Wank and Barbara Jelavich, \"The Impact of the Dual Alliance on the Germans in Austria and Vice-Versa,\" ''East Central Europe'' (1980) 7#2 pp 288-309</ref>   There was a small German-speaking Austrian element located around Vienna, but it did not display much sense of Austrian nationalism. That is it did not demand an independent state, rather it flourished by holding most of the high military and diplomatic offices in the Empire. Russia was the main enemy, As well as Slavic and nationalist groups inside the Empire (especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina) and in nearby Serbia. Although Austria, Germany, and Italy had a defensive military alliance \u2013 the Triple Alliance \u2013 Italy was dissatisfied and wanted a slice of territory controlled by Vienna. \n\n[[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]] after serving as Hungarian prime minister became Foreign Minister of Austria-Hungary (1871\u20131879). Andr\u00e1ssy was a conservative; his foreign policies looked to expanding the Empire into Southeast Europe, preferably with British and German support, and without alienating Turkey. He saw Russia as the main adversary, because of its own expansionist policies toward Slavic and Orthodox areas. He distrusted Slavic nationalist movements as a threat to his multi-ethnic empire.<ref>Macmillan, ''The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914'' (2013) pp 212-44.</ref><ref>Solomon Wank, \"Foreign Policy and the Nationality Problem in Austria-Hungary, 1867\u20131914.\" ''Austrian History Yearbook'' 3.3 (1967): 37-56.</ref>  As tensions escalated in the early 20th century Austria Foreign-policy was set in 1906\u20131912 by its powerful foreign minister [[Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal|Count Aehrenthal]]. He was thoroughly convinced that the Slavic minorities could never come together, and the Balkan League would never accomplish any damage to Austria. 1912 he rejected an Ottoman proposal for an alliance that would include Austria, Turkey and Romania. His policies alienated the Bulgarians, who turned instead to Russia and Serbia. Although Austria had no intention to embark on additional expansion to the south, Aehrenthal encouraged speculation to that effect, expecting it would paralyze the Balkan states. Instead, it incited them to feverish activity to create a defensive block to stop Austria. A series of grave miscalculations at the highest level thus significantly strengthened Austria's enemies.<ref>F.R.

To get that it needed control of the Straits, connecting the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, and if possible, control of Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire. Slavic nationalism was strongly on the rise in the Balkans. It gave Russia the opportunity to protect Slavic and Orthodox Christians.

In early January 1878 Turkey asked for an armistice; the British fleet arrived at Constantinople too late.

It rejected tariffs and practiced free trade. After losing power in Britain in 1874, Liberal leader Gladstone returned to center stage in 1876 by calling for a moralistic foreign policy, as opposed to the realism of his great adversary [[Benjamin Disraeli]]. The issue drew the party line between Gladstone's Liberals (who denounced the immoral Ottomans) and Disraeli's Conservatives (who downplayed the atrocities and supported the Ottoman Empire as an offset to Russian power).  Disraeli had threatened war with Russia on the issue and Gladstone argued he was wrong. Liberal opinion was convulsed by atrocities in the Balkans, in particular the massacre of more than 10,000 Christian Bulgars by Turkish irregulars. Gladstone denounced the Turks for committing \"abominable and bestial lusts ... at which Hell itself might almost blush\" and demanded they withdraw from European soil \"bag and baggage\". His pamphlet sold an astonishing 200,000 copies.<ref>Gladstone, '' Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East'' (1876) [https://archive.org/details/bulgarianhorror03gladgoog <!-- quote=inauthor:gladstone inauthor:william. --> online edition]  Disraeli wisecracked that, of all the Bulgarian horrors perhaps the pamphlet was greatest.</ref>\n\nThe climax was his \"[[Midlothian campaign]]\" of 1880 when he charged Disraeli's government with financial incompetence, neglecting domestic legislation, and mismanagement of foreign affairs. Gladstone felt a call from God to aid the Serbians and Bulgarians (who were Eastern Orthodox Christians); he spoke out like an ancient Hebrew prophet denouncing tyranny and oppression. The real audience was not the local electorate but Britain as a whole, especially the evangelical elements.  By appealing to vast audiences denouncing Disraeli's pro-Turkish foreign policy, Gladstone made himself a moral force in Europe, unified his party, and was carried back to power.<ref>M. A.

Bismarck made clear to all that Germany had no wish to add any territory in Europe, and he tried to oppose German colonial expansion. Bismarck feared that a hostile combination of Austria, France and Russia could overwhelm Germany. If two of them were allied, then the third would ally with Germany only if Germany conceded excessive demands. The solution was to ally with two of the three. In 1873 he formed the [[League of the Three Emperors]], an alliance of the kaiser of Germany, the tsar of Russia, and the emperor of Austria-Hungary. It protected Germany against a war with France. The three emperors together could control Eastern Europe, making sure that restive ethnic groups such as the Poles were kept in control. The Balkans posed a more serious issue, and Bismarck's solution was to give Austria predominance in the western areas, and Russia in the eastern areas. The system collapsed in 1887. Kaiser Wilhelm ousted Bismarck in 1890 and developed his own aggressive foreign policy. The Kaiser rejected the Russian alliance, and Russia in turn turned to an alliance with France.<ref>Raymond James Sontag, ''European Diplomatic History: 1871\u20131932'' (1933) pp 3\u201358</ref>\n\n====War in Sight crisis of 1875====\nBetween 1873 and 1877, Germany repeatedly intervened in the internal affairs of France's neighbors.<ref>Lothar Gall, ''Bismarck: The White Revolutionary, Volume 2: 1871\u20131898'' (1986) pp 46\u201348</ref>  In Belgium, Spain, and Italy, Bismarck exerted strong and sustained political pressure to support the election or appointment of liberal, anticlerical governments.

It was sparked by an editorial entitled \"Krieg-in-Sicht\" in an influential Berlin newspaper the ''Post''. It indicated some highly influential Germans, alarmed by France's rapid recovery from defeat in 1871 and its rearmament program, talked of launching a preventive war against France to hold it down. There was a war scare in Germany and France, and Britain and Russia made it clear they would not tolerate a preventive war. Bismarck did not want any war either, but the unexpected crisis forced him to take into account the fear and alarm that his bullying and Germany's fast-growing power was causing among its neighbors. The crisis reinforced Bismarck's determination that Germany had to work in proactive fashion to preserve the peace in Europe, rather than passively let events take their own course and react to them.<ref>Taylor, ''Struggle for Mastery,'' pp 225\u201327</ref><ref>William L.

This became possible in 1890, when Bismarck was dismissed from office, and Germany refused to renew the secret 1887 [[Reinsurance Treaty]] with Russia. That encouraged Russian expansion into Bulgaria and the Straits. It meant that both France and Russia were without major allies; France took the initiative and funding Russian economic development, and in exploring a military alliance.<ref> Norman Rich, ''Great power diplomacy, 1814\u20131914'' (1992) pp 260-62.</ref> Russia had never been friendly with France, and remembered the wars in the Crimea and the Napoleonic invasion; it saw republican France as a dangerous font of subversion to Russia's style of absolute monarchy. France, which had been shut out of the entire alliance system by Bismarck, decided to improve relations with Russia. It lent money to the Russians, expanded trade, and began selling warships after 1890. Meanwhile, after Bismarck lost office in 1890, there was no renewal of the Reinsurance treaty between Russia and Germany. The German bankers stopped lending to Russia, which increasingly depended on Paris banks.<ref>Barbara Jelavich, ''St. Petersburg and Moscow: Tsarist and Soviet Foreign Policy, 1814\u20131974'' (1974) pp 213\u2013220</ref>\n\nIn 1894 a secret treaty stipulated that Russia would come to the aid of France if France was attacked by Germany. Another stipulation was that in a war against Germany, France would immediately mobilize 1.3 million men, while Russia would mobilize 700,000 to 800,000. It provided that if any of the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria, Italy) mobilized its reserves in preparation for war, then both Russia and France would mobilize theirs. \"The mobilization is the declaration of war,\" the French chief of staff told Tsar Alexander III in 1892. \"To mobilize is to oblige one's neighbor to do the same.\" This set up the tripwire for July 1914.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jack Beatty|title=The Lost History of 1914: Reconsidering the Year the Great War Began|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsn33stuAdEC&pg=PA59|year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|page=59|accessdate=2016-02-24|isbn=9780802779106}}</ref><ref>For more elaborate detail, see Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848\u20131918''(1954) pp 334\u2013345, and William L.

Russia left Bismarck's Three Emperors' League (with Germany and Austria) and instead took up the French proposal for closer relationships and a military alliance.<ref>George F.

There were three main causes of the [[First Balkan War]]. The Ottoman Empire was unable to reform itself, govern satisfactorily, or deal with the rising ethnic nationalism of its diverse peoples. Secondly, the Great Powers quarreled among themselves and failed to ensure that the Ottomans would carry out the needed reforms. This led the Balkan states to impose their own solution.  Most important, the members of the Balkan League were confident that it could defeat the Turks. Their prediction was accurate, as Constantinople called for terms after six weeks of fighting.<ref>Ernst C. Helmreich, ''The diplomacy of the Balkan wars, 1912\u20131913'' (1938)</ref><ref>Richard C.

After five centuries, the Ottoman Empire lost virtually all of its possessions in the Balkans. The Treaty had been imposed by the Great Powers, and the victorious Balkan states were dissatisfied with it. Bulgaria was dissatisfied over the division of the spoils in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], made in secret by its former allies, Serbia and Greece. Bulgaria attacked to force them out of Macedonia, beginning the [[Second Balkan War]]. The Serbian and Greek armies repulsed the Bulgarian offensive and counter-attacked into Bulgaria, while [[Romania]] and the Ottoman Empire also attacked Bulgaria and gained (or regained) territory. In the resulting [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]], Bulgaria lost most of the territories it had gained in the First Balkan War.\n\nThe long-term result was heightened tension in the Balkans. Relations between Austria and Serbia became increasingly bitter. Russia felt humiliated after Austria and Germany prevented it from helping Serbia.

Militarism, alliances, imperialism, and ethnic nationalism played major roles. However the immediate origins of the war lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during the [[July Crisis|Crisis of 1914]], which was sparked by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the Archduke of Austria Hungary) by a Serbian secret organization, the Black Hand.<ref name=Henig2002>{{Cite book | last=Henig | authorlink=Ruth B.

Britain focused on building up its Royal Navy, already stronger than the next two navies combined. Germany, France, Austria, Italy and Russia, and some smaller countries, set up conscription systems whereby young men would serve from 1 to 3 years in the army, then spend the next 20 years or so in the reserves with annual summer training. Men from higher social statuses became officers.<ref name=\"H. Hinsley 1962 pp 204-42\">F. H. Hinsley, ed.

Every year the plans were updated and expanded in terms of complexity. Each country stockpiled arms and supplies for an army that ran into the millions.<ref name=\"H. Hinsley 1962 pp 204-42\"/>\n\nGermany in 1874 had a regular professional army of 420,000 with an additional 1.3 million reserves. By 1897 the regular army was 545,000 strong and the reserves 3.4 million.  The French in 1897 had 3.4 million reservists,  Austria 2.6 million, and Russia 4.0 million. The various national war plans had been perfected by 1914, albeit with Russia and Austria trailing in effectiveness.  All plans called for a decisive opening and a short war.<ref name=\"H. Hinsley 1962 pp 204-42\"/>\n\n===France===\nFor a few years after its defeat in 1871 France displayed a bitter [[Revanchism]]: a deep sense of bitterness, hatred and demand for revenge against Germany, especially because of the loss of Alsace and Lorraine.<ref>Karine Varley, \"The Taboos of Defeat: Unmentionable Memories of the Franco-Prussian War in France, 1870\u20131914.\" in Jenny Macleod, ed., ''Defeat and Memory: Cultural Histories of Military Defeat in the Modern Era'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2008) pp. 62-80; also Karine Varley, ''Under the Shadow of Defeat: The War of 1870\u201371 in French Memory'' (2008)</ref> Paintings that emphasized the humiliation of the defeat came in high demand, such as those by [[Alphonse de Neuville]].<ref>Robert Jay, \"Alphonse de Neuville's 'The Spy' and the Legacy of the Franco-Prussian War,\" ''Metropolitan Museum Journal'' (1984) 19: pp. 151-162 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1512817 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nFrench policy makers were not fixated on revenge.  However strong public opinion regarding Alsace-Lorraine meant that friendship with Germany was impossible unless the provinces were returned, and public opinion in Germany would not allow a return to happen. So Germany worked to isolate France and France sought allies against Germany, especially Russia and Britain.<ref>Macmillan, ''The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914'' (2013) pp </ref>  Apart perhaps from the German threat, most French citizens ignored foreign affairs and colonial issues. In 1914 the chief pressure group was the ''Parti colonial'', a coalition of 50 organizations with a combined total of 5000 members.<ref>Anthony Adamthwaite, ''Grandeur and Misery: France's Bid for Power in Europe, 1914\u20131940'' (1995) p 6</ref>\n\nFrance had colonies in Asia and looked for alliances and found in Japan a possible ally. At Japan's request Paris sent military missions in [[French Military Mission to Japan (1872-1880)|1872\u20131880]], in [[French Military Mission to Japan (1884-1889)|1884\u20131889]] and in [[French Military Mission to Japan (1918-1919)|1918\u20131919]] to help modernize the Japanese army.  Conflicts with China over Indochina climaxed during the [[Sino-French War]] (1884\u20131885). [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Courbet|Admiral Courbet]] destroyed the Chinese fleet anchored at [[Battle of Foochow|Foochow]]. The treaty ending the war, put France in a protectorate over northern and central Vietnam, which it divided into [[Tonkin]] and [[Annam (French colony)|Annam]].<ref name=wak>Frederic Wakeman, Jr., ''The Fall of Imperial China'' (1975) pp. 189\u2013191.</ref>\n\nBismarck's foreign policies had successfully isolated France from the other great powers. After Bismarck was fired, Kaiser Wilhelm took erratic positions that baffled diplomats. No one could quite figure out his goals. Germany ended its secret treaties with Russia, and rejected close ties with Britain. France saw its opportunity, as Russia was looking for a new partner and French financiers invested heavily in Russian economic development. In 1893 Paris and St. Petersburg signed an alliance. France was no longer isolated \u2013 but Germany was increasingly isolated and distrusted, with only Austria as a serious ally. The Triple Alliance included Germany, Austria, and Italy, but Italy had serious disputes with Austria, and switched sides when the world war erupted. Britain was also moving toward alliances, having abandoned its policy of splendid isolation.  By 1903, France settled its disputes with Britain. After Russia and Britain settled their disputes over Persia in 1907, the way was open for the Triple Entente of France, Britain, and Russia. It formed the basis of the Allies of the First World War.\n==== Franco-Russian Alliance ====\n{{Main|Franco-Russian Alliance}}\nFrance was deeply split between the monarchists on one side, and the Republicans on the other.  The Republicans at first seemed highly unlikely to welcome any military alliance with Russia.  That large nation was poor and not industrialized; it was intensely religious and authoritarian, with no sense of democracy or freedom for its peoples.  It oppressed Poland, and exiled, and even executed political liberals and radicals. At a time when French Republicans were rallying in the [[Dreyfus affair]] against anti-Semitism, Russia was the most notorious center in the world of anti-Semitic outrages, including multiple murderous large-scale pogroms against the Jews.  On the other hand, France was increasingly frustrated by Bismarck's success in isolating it diplomatically.  France had issues with Italy, which was allied with Germany and Austria-Hungary in the Triple Alliance.  Paris made a few overtures to Berlin, but they were rebuffed, and after 1900 there was a threat of war between France and Germany over Germany's attempt to deny French expansion into Morocco. Great Britain was still in its \"splendid isolation\" mode and after a major agreement in 1890 with Germany, it seemed especially favorable toward Berlin.  Colonial conflicts in Africa brought Britain and France to a major crisis The Fashoda crisis of 1898 brought Britain and France almost to the brink of war and ended with a humiliation of France that left it hostile to Britain. By 1892 Russia was the only opportunity for France to break out of its diplomatic isolation.  Russia had been allied with Germany the new Kaiser Wilhelm removed Bismarck in 1890 and in 1892 ended the \"Reinsurance treaty\" with Russia.  Russia was now alone diplomatically and like France, it needed a military alliance to contain the threat of Germany's strong army and military aggressiveness.  The pope, angered by German anti-Catholicism, worked diplomatically to bring Paris and St. Petersburg together.  Russia desperately needed money for our infrastructure of railways and ports facilities.  The German government refused to allow its banks to lend money to Russia, but French banks eagerly did so.  For example, it funded the essential trans-Siberian railway.  Negotiations were increasingly successful, and by 1895.  France and Russia had signed the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]], a strong military alliance to join together in war if Germany attacked either of them.  France had finally escaped its diplomatic isolation.<ref>John B.  Wolf, ''France 1814\u20131919: The rise of a Liberal-Democratic Society'' (1963)</ref><ref>William L. Langer, ''The diplomacy of Imperialism: 1890\u20131902'' (1960), pp 3-66.</ref>\n\nIn its continuing effort to isolate Germany, France went to great pains to woo Great Britain, notably in the 1904 [[Entente Cordiale]] with Great Britain, and finally the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] in 1907, which became the [[Triple Entente]]. Paris and London had a high-level military discussion about coordination in a joint war against Germany.  By 1914, Russia and France worked together, and Britain was hostile enough toward Germany to join them as soon as Germany invaded Belgium.<ref>Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe, 1848\u20131918'' (1954) pp 345, 403-26</ref>\n\n====Anglo-German relations deteriorate: 1880\u20131904====\nIn the 1880s relations between Britain and Germany improved as the key policy-makers, [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Prime Minister Lord Salisbury]] and Chancellor Bismarck were both realistic conservatives and largely in agreement on policies.<ref>J. A. S. Grenville, ''Lord Salisbury and Foreign Policy: The Close of the Nineteenth Century'' (1964).</ref> There were several proposals for a formal treaty relationship between Germany and Britain, but they went nowhere; Britain preferred to stand in what it called \"splendid isolation\".<ref>John Charmley, \"Splendid Isolation to Finest Hour: Britain as a Global Power, 1900\u20131950.\" ''Contemporary British History'' 18.3 (2004): 130-146.</ref> Nevertheless, a series of developments steadily improved their relations down to 1890, when Bismarck was fired by the aggressive new Kaiser Wilhelm II.  In January 1896 he escalated tensions with his [[Kruger telegram]] congratulating Boer President Kruger of the Transvaal for beating off the [[Jameson raid]]. German officials in Berlin had managed to stop the Kaiser from proposing a German protectorate over the Transvaal. In the [[Second Boer War]], Germany sympathised with the Boers.  In 1897 Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] became German Naval Secretary of State and began the transformation of German Navy from small, coastal defence force to a fleet meant to challenge British naval power. Tirpitz calls for ''Riskflotte'' (Risk Fleet) that would make it too risky for Britain to take on Germany as part of wider bid to alter the international balance of power decisively in Germany's favour.<ref>William L. Langer, ''The diplomacy of imperialism: 1890\u20131902'' (1951) pp 433-42.</ref> At the same time German foreign minister [[Bernhard von B\u00fclow]] called for ''[[Weltpolitik]]'' (World politics). It was the new policy of Germany to assert its claim to be a global power. Bismarck's conservativism was abandoned as Germany was intent on challenging and upsetting international order.<ref>Grenville, ''Lord Salisbury,'' pp 368-69.</ref> Thereafter relations deteriorated steadily.  London began to see Berlin as a hostile force and moved to friendlier relationships with France.<ref>Bernadotte Everly Schmitt, ''England and Germany, 1740\u20131914'' (1916)  pp 133-43.</ref>\n\n====Two crises in Morocco====\nMorocco on the northwest coast of Africa, was the last major territory in Africa not controlled by colonial power.  Morocco nominally was ruled by its Sultan. But in 1894 a child took the office, and soon died leaving chaos. By 1900, Morocco was the scene of multiple local wars started by pretenders to the sultanate, by bankruptcy of the treasury, and by multiple tribal revolts. No one was in charge. The French Foreign Minister [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]] saw the opportunity to stabilize the situation and expand the French overseas empire. General [[Hubert Lyautey]] wanted a more aggressive military policy using his French army based in Algeria. France decided to use both diplomacy and military force. With British approval, it would control the Sultan, ruling in his name and extending French control. British approval was received in the [[Entente Cordiale]] of 1904.<ref>Dennis Brogan, ''The Development of modern France, 1870\u20131939'' (1940) 392-95. </ref><ref> Kim Munholland, \"Rival Approaches to Morocco: Delcasse, Lyautey, and the Algerian-Moroccan Border, 1903\u20131905.\" ''French Historical Studies'' 5.3 (1968): 328-343.</ref> Germany did not want Morocco itself, but felt embarrassed that France was making gains while Germany was not.  On 31 March 1905, Germany's Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]  visited Morocco's capital, Tangier, and delivered a sabre-rattling speech demanding an international conference to ensure Morocco's independence, with war the alternative.  Germany's goal in the [[First Moroccan Crisis]] was to enhance its prestige and diminish the ''Entente Cordiale'' linking Britain and France.  Historian Heather Jones argues that Germany's use of warlike rhetoric was a deliberate diplomatic ploy:\n:Another German strategy was to stage dramatic gestures, and dangerously play up the threat of war, in the belief that this would impress upon other European powers the importance of consultation with Germany on imperial issues: the fact that France had not considered it necessary to make a bilateral agreement with Germany over Morocco rankled, especially given Germany was deeply insecure about its newly acquired Great Power status.  Hence Germany opted for an increase in belligerent rhetoric and, theatrically, Kaiser Wilhelm II dramatically interrupted a Mediterranean cruise to visit Tangier, where he declared Germany's support for the Sultan's independence and integrity of his kingdom, turning Morocco overnight into an international 'crisis.'<ref>Heather Jones, \"Algeciras Revisited: European Crisis and Conference Diplomacy, 16 January-7 April 1906.\" (EUI WorkingPaper MWP 2009/1, 2009),\n p 5 [http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/10527/MWP_2009_01.pdf?...1 online]</ref> Germany's plan backfired when Britain made it clear that in the event of a German attack on France, Britain would intervene on France's side. In 1906 the [[Algeciras Conference]] ended the crisis with a stinging diplomatic defeat for Germany as France gained the dominant role in Morocco.  The experience brought London and Paris much closer and set up the presumption they would be allies if Germany attacked either one.<ref>Margaret MacMillan, ''The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914''(2012) pp 378--398.</ref>  The German adventure resulted in failure as Germany was left more isolated and alienated.  A momentous consequence was the heightened sense of frustration and readiness for war in Germany.  It spread beyond the political elite to much of the press and most of the political parties except for the Liberals and Social Democrats on the left.  The Pan-German element grew in strength and denounced their government's retreat as treason, stepping up chauvinistic support for war.<ref>Immanuel Geiss, ''German Foreign Policy 1871 \u2013 1914'' (1976) 133-36.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Agadir Crisis]] of 1911 France used force to seize more control over Morocco. The German Foreign Minister [[Alfred von Kiderlen-Waechter]] was not opposed to these moves, but he felt Germany was entitled to some compensation elsewhere in Africa. He sent a small warship, made saber-rattling threats, and whipped up anger among German nationalists.  France and Germany soon agreed on a compromise.  However, the British cabinet was alarmed at Germany's aggressiveness toward France. David Lloyd George made a dramatic \"Mansion House\" speech that denounced the German move as an intolerable humiliation. There was talk of war, and Germany backed down. Relations between Berlin and London remained sour.<ref>Christopher Clark,  ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914'' (2012) pp 204-13.</ref><ref>Frank Maloy Anderson, and Amos Shartle Hershey, eds.

The British responded with new technology typified by the [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|Dreadnaught revolution]], and remained in the lead.<ref>Margaret Macmillan, ''The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914'' (2013) ch 5</ref><ref>Brandenburg, ''From Bismarck to the World War: A History of German Foreign Policy 1870\u20131914'' (1927) pp 266=99, 394-417.</ref>\n\nGermany's navy was not strong enough to confront the British in World War I; the one great naval Battle of Jutland failed to end Britain's control of the seas or break the stifling blockade. Germany turned to submarine warfare. The laws of war required an effort be made to allow passengers and crew to board lifeboats before sinking a ship. The Germans disregarded the law and in the most dramatic episode sank the Lusitania in 1915 in a few minutes. The U.S. demanded it stop, and Germany did so.  Admiral [[Henning von Holtzendorff]]  (1853\u20131919), chief of the admiralty staff, argued successfully in early 1917 to resume the attacks and thus starve the British. The German high command realized the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare meant war with the United States but calculated that American mobilization would be too slow to stop a German victory on the Western Front.<ref>Dirk Steffen, \"The Holtzendorff Memorandum of 22 December 1916 and Germany's Declaration of Unrestricted U-boat Warfare.\" ''Journal of Military History'' 68.1 (2004): 215-224.

Those fighting alongside the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] are in green, the [[Central Powers]] in orange, and neutral countries in grey.]]\n\nThe First World War was a global conflict that lasted from 1914 to 1918. It saw the Central Powers (Germany and Austria-Hungary, later joined by the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria),  fighting the \"Entente\" or \"Allied\" powers, led by Britain, Russia and France from 1914, who were later joined by Italy in 1915, and other countries such as Romania in 1916.<ref name=\"John Horne 2012\">John Horne, ed. ''A Companion to World War I'' (2012)</ref>  The United States, initially neutral, tried to broker a settlement but in April, 1917, it declared war on Germany. The U.S. cooperated with the Allies but did not formally join them, and it negotiated peace separately. Despite overcoming Romania in 1916 and Russia in March 1918, the Central Powers collapsed in November, 1918; and Germany accepted an \"armistice\" that in practice was a total surrender.<ref name=\"John Horne 2012\"/>  Much of the diplomatic efforts of the major powers was oriented toward pushing neutral countries into the alliance with promises of rich territorial rewards. Britain, the United States and Germany spent large sums funding their allies.  Propaganda campaigns to maintain morale at home and undermine morale in the enemy camp, especially among minorities, were a priority for the major powers.  They also engaged in subversion, by subsidizing political groups that try to overthrow the enemy regime, as the Bolsheviks did in Russia in 1917.<ref>David Stevenson, ''The First World War and International Politics'' (1988).</ref>\nBoth sides made secret agreements with neutrals to entice them into joining the war in return for a slice of enemy territory after victory was achieved.  Some land was promised to several nations, so some promises therefore had to be broken. That left permanent bitter legacies, especially in Italy.<ref>J.A.S.

The international relations of minor countries are covered in their own history articles. This era covers the period from the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315), to the end of the [[Diplomatic history of World War I|First World War]] and the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. For the previous era see [[International relations, 1648\u20131814]]. For the 1920s and 1930s see [[International relations (1919\u20131939)]].\n\nImportant themes include the rapid industrialization and growing power of Britain, France and Prussia/Germany, and, later in the period, the United States and Japan. This led to [[imperialism|imperialist]] and [[colonialism|colonialist]] competitions for influence and power throughout the world, most famously the [[Scramble for Africa]] in the 1880s and 1890s. The reverberations are still widespread and consequential in the 21st century. Britain established an informal economic network that, combined with its colonies and its Royal Navy, made it the hegemonic nation until its power was challenged by the united Germany. It was a largely peaceful century, with no wars between the great powers, apart from the 1854\u20131871 interval, and some small wars between Russia and the Ottoman Empire.

Trade was handled by neutral American and Dutch traders. The colonies set up temporary governments or juntas which were effectively independent from Spain. The division exploded between Spaniards who were born in Spain (called ''peninsulares'') versus those of Spanish descent born in [[New Spain]] (called ''criollos'' in Spanish or \"creoles\" in English). The two groups wrestled for power, with the ''criollos'' leading the call for independence and eventually winning that independence.

Repeated attempts to regain control failed, as Spain had no help from European powers. Indeed, Britain and the United States worked against Spain, enforcing the [[Monroe Doctrine]].

In 1824, the armies of generals [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] of Argentina and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] of Venezuela defeated the last Spanish forces; the final defeat came at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] in southern [[History of Peru|Peru]]. After the loss of its colonies, Spain played a minor role in international affairs. Spain kept Cuba, which repeatedly revolted in three wars of independence, culminating in the [[Cuban War of Independence]]. The United States demanded reforms from Spain, which Spain refused.

The Ottomans, with major aid from Egypt, cruelly crushed the rebellion and harshly punished the Greeks. Humanitarian concerns in Europe were outraged, as typified by English poet [[Lord Byron]].  The context of the three Great Powers' intervention was Russia's long-running expansion at the expense of the decaying Ottoman Empire. However Russia's ambitions in the region were seen as a major geostrategic threat by the other European powers. Austria feared the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire would destabilize its southern borders. Russia gave strong emotional support for the fellow [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christian]] Greeks. The British were motivated by strong public support for the Greeks. Fearing unilateral Russian action in support of the Greeks, Britain and France bound Russia by treaty to a joint intervention which aimed to secure Greek autonomy whilst preserving Ottoman territorial integrity as a check on Russia.<ref>Henry Kissinger.

He had six main goals that he pursued: first he defended British interests whenever they seemed threatened, and upheld Britain's prestige abroad. Second he was a master at using the media to win public support from all ranks of society. Third he promoted the spread of constitutional Liberal governments like in Britain, along the model of the 1832 Reform Act. He therefore welcomed liberal revolutions as in France (1830),  and Greece (1843). Fourth he promoted British nationalism, looking for advantages for his nation as an the Belgian revolt of 1830 and the Italian unification of 1859. He avoided wars, and operated with only a very small British Army. He felt the best way to promote peace was to maintain a balance of power to prevent any nation\u2014especially France or Russia\u2014from dominating Europe.<ref>Norman Lowe, ''Mastering Modern British History'' (3rd ed. 1998) p. 111. </ref><ref>Muriel E.

In Paris he normalized relations with the newly restored Bourbon government and convinced his government they could be trusted. He worked well with top European diplomats such as his friends [[Klemens von Metternich]] in Vienna and [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]] in Paris. He brought Britain into the center of Continental diplomacy on critical issues, such as the local wars in Greece, Portugal and Belgium.

They attempted to overthrow reactionary monarchies. This was the most widespread [[revolutionary wave]] in European history. It reached most of Europe, but much less so in the Americas, Britain and Belgium, where liberalism was recently established. However the reactionary forces prevailed, especially with Russian help, and many rebels went into exile. There were some social reforms.<ref>Peter N. Stearns, ''[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=30508731 The Revolutions of 1848]'' (1974).</ref>\n\nThe revolutions were essentially democratic and liberal in nature, with the aim of removing the old monarchical structures and creating independent nation states. The revolutions spread across Europe after an initial revolution began in [[French Revolution of 1848|France in February]]. Over 50 countries were affected. Liberal ideas had been in the air for a decade and activist from each country drew from the common pool, but they did not form direct links with revolutionaries in nearby countries.<ref>Claus M\u00f8ller J\u00f8rgensen,  \"Transurban interconnectivities: an essay on the interpretation of the revolutions of 1848\". ''European Review of History: Revue europeenne d'histoire'' 19.2 (2012): 201\u201327.</ref>\n\nKey contributing factors were widespread dissatisfaction with old established political leadership, demands for more participation in government and democracy, demands for freedom of the press, other demands made by the working class, the upsurge of nationalism, and the regrouping of established government forces.<ref>R. J. W. Evans and Hartmut Pogge von Strandmann, eds., ''The Revolutions in Europe 1848\u20131849'' (2000) pp. v, 4</ref> Liberalism at this time meant the replacement of autocratic governments by constitutional states under the rule of law. It had become the creed of the bourgeoisie, but they were not in power. It was the main factor in France. The main factor in the German, Italian and Austrian states was nationalism. Stimulated by the Romantic movement, nationalism had aroused numerous ethnic/language groups in their common past. Germans and Italians lived under multiple governments and demanded to be united in their own national state. Regarding the [[Austrian Empire]], the many ethnicities suppressed by foreign rule\u2014especially Hungarians\u2014fought for a revolution.<ref>Melvin Kranzberg, [https://www.questia.com/library/1018368/1848-a-turning-point \"1848: A Turning Point?\"] (1959) pp. viii\u2013xi.</ref>\n\nThe uprisings were led by temporary coalitions of reformers, the middle classes and workers, which did not hold together for long. The start was in France, where large crowds forced king [[Louis Philippe I]] to abdicate. Across Europe came the sudden realization that it was indeed possible to destroy a monarchy. Tens of thousands of people were killed, and many more were forced into exile. Significant lasting reforms included the abolition of [[serfdom]] in Austria and Hungary, the end of [[absolute monarchy]] in Denmark, and the introduction of [[representative democracy]] in the Netherlands. The revolutions were most important in France, the Netherlands, the states of the [[German Confederation]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], and the [[Austrian Empire]].<ref>William L.

The revolutionary surge was sudden and unexpected, catching the traditional forces unprepared. But the revolutionaries were also unprepared \u2013 they had no plans on how to hold power when it was suddenly in their hands, and bickered endlessly. Reaction came much more gradually, but the aristocrats had the advantages of vast wealth, large networks of contacts, many subservient subjects, and the specific goal in mind of returning to the old status quo.<ref> Kurt Weyland. \"Crafting Counterrevolution: How Reactionaries Learned to Combat Change in 1848\".

It was not invited to the Vienna Conference. During this period the Empire steadily weakened militarily, and lost most of its holdings in Europe (starting with Greece) and later in North Africa. Its great enemy was Russia, while its chief supporter was Britain.<ref>Donald Quataert, ''The Ottoman Empire, 1700\u20131922'' (2000).</ref><ref>Rich, ''Great Power Diplomacy: 1814\u20131914'' (1992) pp. 69\u201377.</ref>\n\nAs the 19th century progressed the Ottoman Empire grew weaker and Britain increasingly became its chief ally and protector, even fighting the [[Crimean War]] in the 1850s to help it against Russia. Three British leaders played major roles. [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], who in the 1830\u20131865 era considered the Ottoman Empire an essential component in the balance of power, was the most favourable toward Constantinople. [[William Gladstone]] in the 1870s sought to build a Concert of Europe that would support the survival of the empire. In the 1880s and 1890s [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] contemplated an orderly dismemberment of it, in such a way as to reduce rivalry between the greater powers.<ref>David Steele, \"Three British Prime Ministers and the Survival of the Ottoman Empire, 1855\u20131902\".

Russia denounced this claim, since it claimed to be the protector of all Eastern Orthodox Christians in the Ottoman Empire. France sent its fleet to the Black Sea; Russia responded with its own show of force. In 1851, Russia sent troops into the Ottoman provinces of Moldavia and Wallachia. Britain, now fearing for the security of the Ottoman Empire, sent a fleet to join with the French expecting the Russians would back down. Diplomatic efforts failed. The Sultan declared war against Russia in October 1851. Following an Ottoman naval disaster in November, Britain and France declared war against Russia. Most of the battles took place in the Crimean peninsula, which the Allies finally seized.<ref>Orlando Figes, ''The Crimean War: A History'' (2011) is a standard scholarly history.</ref> \n[[File:Edouard Dubufe Congr\u00e8s de Paris.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Diplomats at the Congress of Paris, 1856, settled the Crimean War; painting by [[Edouard Louis Dubufe]]]]\n\nRussia was defeated and was forced to accept the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], signed on 30 March 1856, ending the war. The Powers promised to respect Ottoman independence and territorial integrity. Russia gave up a little land and relinquished its claim to a protectorate over the Christians in the Ottoman domains. In a major blow to Russian power and prestige, the Black Sea was demilitarized, and an international commission was set up to guarantee freedom of commerce and navigation on the Danube River.

In the long run the war marked a turning point in Russian domestic and foreign policy. Russia's  military demonstrated its weakness, its poor leadership, and its lack of modern weapons and technology. Russia's weak economy was unable to fully support its military adventures, so in the future it redirected its attention to much weaker Muslim areas in central Asia, and left Europe alone. Russian intellectuals used the humiliating defeat to demand fundamental reform of the government and social system. The war weakened both Russia and Austria, so they could no longer promote stability. This opened the way for Napoleon III, [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Cavour]] (in Italy) and [[Otto von Bismarck]] (in Germany) to launch a series of wars in the 1860s that reshaped Europe.<ref>Stephen J.

The Confederates did raise money in Europe, which they used to buy warships and munitions. However Britain had a large surplus of cotton in 1861; stringency did not come until 1862. Most important was the dependence on grain from the U.S. North for a large portion of the British food supply, France would not intervene alone, and in any case was less interested in cotton than in securing its control of Mexico. The Confederacy would allow that if it secured its independence, but the Union never would approve.<ref>Lynn Marshall Case and Warren F.

The British people generally favored the United States. What little cotton was available came from New York City, as the blockade by the U.S. Navy shut down 95% of Southern exports to Britain. In September 1862, during the Confederate invasion of Maryland, Britain (along with France) contemplated stepping in and negotiating a peace settlement, which could only mean war with the United States. But in the same month, US president [[Abraham Lincoln]] announced the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].

To do it, he engaged in a series of short, decisive wars with Denmark, Austria and France. The many smaller German states followed the lead of Prussia, until finally they united together after defeating France in 1871.

The Danish and German duchies of Schleswig-Holstein were, by international agreement, ruled by the king of Denmark but were not legally part of Denmark. An international treaty provided that the two territories were not to be separated from each other, though Holstein was part of the German Confederation. In the late 1840s, with both German and Danish nationalism on the rise, Denmark attempted to incorporate Schleswig into its kingdom. [[First Schleswig War|The first war]] was a Danish victory. The [[Second Schleswig War]] of 1864 was a Danish defeat at the hands of Prussia and Austria.<ref>A. J. P. Taylor, ''Struggle for Mastery of Europe: 1848\u20131918'' pp. 171\u2013219</ref><ref>J. V.

He retained control over Prussia and as well as the foreign and domestic policies of the new German Empire.  Bismarck had built his reputation as a war-maker but changed overnight into a peacemaker. He skillfully used [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]], it was Bismarck who \"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers\".<ref>[[Eric Hobsbawm]], ''The Age of Empire: 1875\u20131914'' (1987),  p. 312.</ref>\n\nBismarck's main mistake was giving in to the Army and to intense public demand in Germany for acquisition of the border provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, thereby turning France into a permanent, deeply-committed enemy (''see'' [[French\u2013German enmity]]).

It concentrated on internal industrial development and political reform, and building up its great international holdings, the [[British Empire]], while maintaining by far the world's strongest [[Royal Navy|Navy]] to protect its island home and its many overseas possessions.  It had come dangerously close to intervening in the American Civil War in 1861\u20131862, and in May 1871 it signed the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]] with the United States that put into arbitration the American claims that the lack of British neutrality had prolong the war; arbitrators eventually awarded the United States $15 million.<ref>Hayes, ''A Generation of Materialism, 1871\u20131900'' (1941),  pp 2-3.</ref>  Russia took advantage of the Franco-Prussian war to renounce the 1856 treaty in which it had been forced to demilitarize the Black Sea.  Repudiation of treaties was unacceptable to the powers, so the solution was a conference in January 1871 at London that formally abrogated key elements of the 1856 treaty and endorsed the new Russian action.  Russia had always wanted control of Constantinople and the straits that connected the Black Sea to the Mediterranean and would nearly achieve that in the First World War.<ref>Hayes, ''A Generation of Materialism, 1871\u20131900'' (1941),  pp 3-4.</ref>  France had long stationed an army in Rome to protect the pope; it recalled the soldiers in 1870, and the Kingdom of Italy moved in, [[Capture of Rome|seized the remaining papal territories]], and made Rome its capital city in 1871 ending the [[risorgimento]].  Italy was finally unified, but at the cost of alienating the pope and the Catholic community for a half century; the unstable situation was resolved in 1929 with the [[Lateran Treaties]].<ref>Hayes, ''A Generation of Materialism, 1871\u20131900'' (1941),  p 4.</ref>\n\n===Conscription===\nA major trend was the move away from a professional army to a Prussian system that combined a core of professional careerists, a rotating base of conscripts, who after a year or two of active duty moved into a decade or more of reserve duty with a required summer training program every year. Training took place in peacetime, and in wartime a much larger, well-trained, fully staffed army could be mobilized very quickly.  Prussia had started in 1814, and the Prussian triumphs of the 1860s made its model irresistible. The key element was universal conscription, with relatively few exemptions.  The upper strata was drafted into the officer corps for one year's training, but was nevertheless required to do its full reserve duty along with everyone else. Austria adopted the system in 1868 (shortly after its defeat by Prussia) and France In 1872 (shortly after its defeat by Prussia and other German states).  Japan followed in 1873, Russia in 1874, and Italy in 1875.  All major countries adopted conscription by 1900, except for Great Britain and the United States.  By then peacetime Germany had an army of 545,000, which could be expanded in a matter of days to 3.4 million by calling up the reserves.  The comparable numbers in France were 1.8 million and 3.5 million; Austria, 1.1 million and 2.6 million; Russia, 1.7 million to 4 million.  The new system was expensive, with a per capita cost of the forces doubling or even tripling between 1870 and 1914.  By then total defense spending averaged about 5% of the national income.  Nevertheless, taxpayers seemed satisfied; parents were especially impressed with the dramatic improvements shown in the immature boys they sent away at age 18, compared to the worldly-wise men who returned two years later.<ref>Hale, ''The Great Illusion: 1900\u20131914'' pp 21-27.</ref>\n\n==Imperialism==\n{{further information|New Imperialism}}\n[[File:Afrikakonferenz.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Berlin Conference (1884)]] chaired by German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] regulated European imperialism in Africa.]]\n\nMost of the major powers (and some minor ones such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark) engaged in imperialism, building up their overseas empires especially in Africa and Asia. Although there were numerous insurrections, historians count only a few wars, and they were small-scale: [[Boer Wars|two Anglo-Boer Wars]] (1880\u20131881 and 1899\u20131902), [[Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895)|the Sino-Japanese War]] (1894\u20131895), [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]] (1895\u201396), [[Spanish\u2013American War]] (1898),  and [[Italo-Turkish War|Italo-Ottoman war]] (1911). The largest was the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1905, the only in which two major powers fought each other.<ref>Raymond F. Betts, ''Europe Overseas: Phases of Imperialism'' (1968) [https://www.questia.com/library/99891256/europe-overseas-phases-of-imperialism online]</ref>\n\nAmong the main empires from 1875 to 1914, historians assess a mixed record in terms of profitability. The assumption was that colonies would provide an excellent captive market for manufactured items. Apart from India, this was seldom true. By the 1890s, imperialists gained economic benefit primarily in the production of inexpensive raw materials to feed the domestic manufacturing sector. Overall, Great Britain profited well from India, but not from most of the rest of its empire. The Netherlands did very well in the East Indies. Germany and Italy got very little trade or raw materials from their empires. France did slightly better. The Belgian Congo was notoriously profitable when it was a capitalistic rubber plantation owned and operated by King Leopold II as a private enterprise. However, scandal after scandal regarding badly mistreated labour led the international community to force the government of Belgium to take it over in 1908, and it became much less profitable. The Philippines cost the United States much more than expected.<ref>Oron J.

Spain and Britain soon withdrew after realizing that Napoleon III intended to overthrow the Mexican government under elected president [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and establish a [[Second Mexican Empire]]. Napoleon had the support of the remnants of the Conservative elements that Juarez and his Liberals had defeated in the [[Reform War]], a civil war from 1857\u201361. In the [[French intervention in Mexico]] in 1862. Napoleon installed Austrian archduke [[Maximilian of Habsburg]] as emperor of Mexico. Ju\u00e1rez rallied opposition to the French; Washington supported Ju\u00e1rez and refused to recognize the new government because it violated the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. After its victory over the Confederacy in 1865, the U.S. sent 50,000 experienced combat troops to the Mexican border to make clear its position. Napoleon was stretched very thin; he had committed 40,000 troops to Mexico, 20,000 to Rome to guard the Pope against the Italians, and another 80,000 in restive Algeria. Furthermore, Prussia, having just defeated Austria, was an imminent threat. Napoleon realized his predicament and withdrew all his forces from Mexico in 1866.

Gladstone's decision came against strained relations with France, and maneuvering by \"men on the spot\" in Egypt. Critics such as Cain and Hopkins have stressed the need to protect large sums invested by British financiers and Egyptian bonds, while downplaying the risk to the viability of the Suez Canal.

By 1850 [[European exploration of Africa|European explorers]] had begun mapping the interior. Three developments encouraged European interest in East Africa.  First was the emergence of the island of [[Zanzibar]], located off the east coast. It became a base from which trade and exploration of the African mainland could be mounted.<ref>Robin Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875: A Modern History,'' (1974) p. 560.</ref>\n\nBy 1840, to protect the interests of the various nationals doing business in Zanzibar, consul offices had been opened by the British, French, Germans and Americans. In 1859, the tonnage of foreign shipping calling at Zanzibar had reached 19,000 tons. By 1879, the tonnage of this shipping had reached 89,000 tons. The second development spurring European interest in Africa was the growing European demand for products of Africa including ivory and cloves. Thirdly, British interest in East Africa was first stimulated by their desire to abolish the slave trade.<ref>Hallett, ''Africa to 1875'', pp. 560\u201361</ref> Later in the century, British interest in East Africa was stimulated by German competition, and in 1887 the Imperial British East Africa Company, a private concern, leased from Seyyid Said his mainland holdings, a 10-mile (16-km)-wide strip of land along the coast.\n\nGermany set up a protectorate over the [[Sultan of Zanzibar]]'s coastal possessions in 1885.  It traded its coastal holdings to Britain in 1890, in exchange for German control over the coast of [[Tanganyika]].\n\nIn 1895 the British government claimed the interior as far west as Lake Naivasha; it set up the '''[[East Africa Protectorate]]'''. The border was extended to Uganda in 1902, and in 1920 most of the enlarged protectorate became a crown colony. With the beginning of colonial rule in 1895, the Rift Valley and the surrounding Highlands became the enclave of white immigrants engaged in large-scale coffee farming dependent on mostly Kikuyu labour. There were no significant mineral resources\u2014none of the gold or diamonds that attracted so many to South Africa.  In the initial stage of colonial rule, the administration relied on traditional communicators, usually chiefs. When colonial rule was established and efficiency was sought, partly because of settler pressure, newly educated younger men were associated with old chiefs in local Native Councils.<ref>R. Mugo Gatheru, ''Kenya: From Colonization to Independence, 1888\u20131970'' (2005)</ref>\n\nFollowing severe financial difficulties of the [[British East Africa Company]], the British government on 1 July 1895 established direct rule through the [[British East Africa|East African Protectorate]], subsequently opening (1902) the fertile highlands to white settlers. A key to the development of Kenya's interior was the construction, started in 1895, of a railway from Mombasa to [[Kisumu]], on [[Lake Victoria]], completed in 1901.  Some 32,000 workers were imported from British India to do the manual labour. Many stayed, as did most of the Indian traders and small businessmen who saw opportunity in the opening up of the interior of Kenya.<ref>John M.

Portugal also established trading stations open to all nations off the coasts of Africa, South Asia, and East Asia. Portugal had imported slaves as domestic servants and farm workers in Portugal itself, and used its experience to make slave trading a major economic activity.  Portuguese businessmen set up slave plantations on the nearby islands of Madeira, Cape Verde, and the Azores, focusing on sugar production. In 1770, the enlightened despot [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Pombal]] declared trade to be a noble and necessary profession, allowing businessmen to enter the Portuguese nobility.  Many settlers moved to Brazil, which became independent in 1822.<ref>A.R.

In India, trade flourished in the colony of [[history of Goa|Goa]], with its subsidiary colonies of [[History of Macau|Macau]], near Hong Kong on the China coast, and [[Portuguese Timor|Timor]], north of Australia.

In the Scramble for Africa of the 1880s, leaders of the new nation of Italy were enthusiastic about acquiring colonies in Africa, expecting it would legitimize their status as a power and help unify the people. In North Africa Italy first turned to Tunis, under nominal Ottoman control, where many Italian farmers had settled. Weak and diplomatically isolated, Italy was helpless and angered when France assumed a protectorate over Tunis in 1881.  Turning to East Africa, Italy tried to conquer independent Ethiopia, but was massively defeated at the [[Battle of Adwa]] in 1896.  Public opinion was angered at the national humiliation by an inept government. In 1911 the Italian people supported the seizure of what is now Libya.<ref>Giuseppe Maria Finaldi, ''Italian National Identity in the Scramble for Africa: Italy's African Wars in the Era of Nation-Building, 1870\u20131900'' (2010)</ref>\n\nItalian diplomacy over a twenty-year period succeeded in getting permission to seize Libya, with approval coming from Germany, France, Austria, Britain and Russia.  A centerpiece of the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911\u201312 came when Italian forces took control of a few coastal cities against stiff resistance by Ottoman troops as well as the local tribesmen.  After the peace treaty gave Italy control it sent in Italian settlers, but suffered extensive casualties in its brutal campaign against the tribes.<ref>William C.

The war with China made Japan the world's first Eastern, modern imperial power, and the war with Russia proved that a Western power could be defeated by an Eastern state.

Japanese soldiers massacred the Chinese after capturing [[Port Arthur, China|Port Arthur]] on the Liaotung Peninsula. In the harsh [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] of April 1895, China recognize the independence of Korea, and ceded to Japan Formosa, the Pescatores Islands and the Liaotung Peninsula. China further paid an indemnity of 200 million silver taels, opened five new ports to international trade,  and allowed Japan (and other Western powers) to set up and operate factories in these cities.  However, Russia, France, and Germany saw themselves disadvantaged by the treaty and in the [[Triple Intervention]] forced Japan to return the Liaotung Peninsula in return for a larger indemnity.  The only positive result for China came when those factories led the industrialization of urban China, spinning off a local class of entrepreneurs and skilled mechanics.<ref>{{cite book|author=William T.

The [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) built [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]]. They soon began to rule the natives. China took control in the 1660s, and sent in settlers. By the 1890s there were about 2.3 million Han Chinese and 200,000 members of indigenous tribes. After its victory in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1894\u201395, the peace treaty ceded the island to Japan. It was Japan's first colony.<ref>Jonathan Manthorpe, ''Forbidden Nation: A History of Taiwan'' (2008) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0230614248/ excerpt and text search], Ch. 10\u201312</ref>\n\nJapan expected far more benefits from the occupation of Taiwan than the limited benefits it actually received. Japan realized that its home islands could only support a limited resource base, and it hoped that Taiwan, with its fertile farmlands, would make up the shortage.  By 1905, Taiwan was producing rice and sugar and paying for itself with a small surplus. Perhaps more important, Japan gained Asia-wide prestige by being the first non-European country to operate a modern colony.  It learned how to adjust its German-based bureaucratic standards to actual conditions, and how to deal with frequent insurrections. The ultimate goal was to promote Japanese language and culture, but the administrators realized they first had to adjust to the Chinese culture of the people.  Japan had a civilizing mission, and it opened schools so that the peasants could become productive and patriotic manual workers.  Medical facilities were modernized, and the death rate plunged.  To maintain order, Japan installed a police state that closely monitored everyone. In 1945, Japan was stripped of its empire and Taiwan was returned to China.<ref>Manthorpe, ''Forbidden Nation: A History of Taiwan''  (2008)  ch 13</ref>\n\n====Japan defeats Russia, 1904\u20131905====\n{{Main|Russo-Japanese War}}\nJapan felt humiliated when the spoils from its decisive victory over China were partly reversed by the Western Powers (including Russia), which revised the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]]. The [[Boxer Rebellion]] of 1899\u20131901 saw Japan and Russia as allies who fought together against the Chinese, with Russians playing the leading role on the battlefield.<ref>Petr E.

Japan offered to recognize Russian dominance in [[Manchuria]] in exchange for recognition of Korea as being within the Japanese sphere of influence. Russia refused and demanded Korea north of the [[39th parallel north|39th parallel]] to be a neutral buffer zone between Russia and Japan. The Japanese government decided on war to stop the perceived Russian threat to its plans for expansion into Asia.<ref>Ian Hill Nish, ''The Origins of the Russo\u2013Japanese War'' (1985). </ref> The Japanese Navy opened hostilities by a surprise attacks on the Russian Eastern Fleet at [[L\u00fcshunkou District|Port Arthur]], China. Russia suffered multiple defeats but [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] fought on with the expectation that Russia would win decisive naval battles. When that proved illusory he fought to preserve the dignity of Russia by averting a \"humiliating peace\".  The complete victory of the Japanese military surprised world observers. The consequences transformed the balance of power in East Asia, resulting in a reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. It was the first major military victory in the modern era of an Asian power over a European one.<ref> Geoffrey Jukes, ''The Russo-Japanese War 1904\u20131905'' (2002) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1841764469/ excerpt]</ref> \n====Korea====\nIn 1905, the Empire of Japan and the Korean Empire signed the [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1905|Eulsa Treaty]], which brought Korea into the Japanese sphere of influence as a protectorate. The Treaty was a result of the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War and Japan wanting to increase its hold over the Korean Peninsula. The Eulsa Treaty led to the signing of the [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1907|1907 Treaty]] two years later. The 1907 Treaty ensured that Korea would act under the guidance of a Japanese resident general and Korean internal affairs would be under Japanese control. Korean Emperor [[Gojong of Korea|Gojong]] was forced to abdicate in favour of his son, [[Sunjong of Korea|Sunjong]], as he protested Japanese actions in the Hague Conference.

There was a high risk this would lead to major confrontations between Austria-Hungary and Russia, and between Russian and Great Britain. Russia especially wanted control of Constantinople in the straits connecting the Black Sea with the Mediterranean. British policy had long been to support the Ottoman Empire against Russian expansion. However, In 1876 William Gladstone added a new dimension  escalated the conflict by emphasizing Ottoman atrocities against Christians in Bulgaria.

After 1900, the large Arab population would also grow nationalistic. The threat of disintegration was real. Egypt for example although still nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, have been independent for century. Turkish nationalists were emerging, and the [[Young Turk]] movement indeed took over the Empire. While the previous rulers had been pluralistic, the Young Turks were hostile to all other nationalities and to non-Muslims. Wars were usually defeats, in which another slice of territory was sliced off and became semi-independent, including Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Romania, Bosnia, and Albania.<ref> Justin McCarthy, ''The Ottoman Turks: An Introductory History to 1923'' (1997) pp 306-7.

It was operated by and for the Habsburg family, who demanded loyalty to the throne, but not to the nation. Nationalistic movements were growing rapidly. The most powerful were the Hungarians, who preserved their separate status within the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and with the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the creation of the Dual Monarchy they were getting practical equality. Other minorities, were highly frustrated, although some \u2013 especially the Jews \u2013 felt protected by the Empire. German nationalists, especially in the Sudetenland (part of Bohemia) however, looked to Berlin in the new German Empire.<ref>Solomon Wank and Barbara Jelavich, \"The Impact of the Dual Alliance on the Germans in Austria and Vice-Versa,\" ''East Central Europe'' (1980) 7#2 pp 288-309</ref>   There was a small German-speaking Austrian element located around Vienna, but it did not display much sense of Austrian nationalism. That is it did not demand an independent state, rather it flourished by holding most of the high military and diplomatic offices in the Empire. Russia was the main enemy, As well as Slavic and nationalist groups inside the Empire (especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina) and in nearby Serbia. Although Austria, Germany, and Italy had a defensive military alliance \u2013 the Triple Alliance \u2013 Italy was dissatisfied and wanted a slice of territory controlled by Vienna. \n\n[[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]] after serving as Hungarian prime minister became Foreign Minister of Austria-Hungary (1871\u20131879). Andr\u00e1ssy was a conservative; his foreign policies looked to expanding the Empire into Southeast Europe, preferably with British and German support, and without alienating Turkey. He saw Russia as the main adversary, because of its own expansionist policies toward Slavic and Orthodox areas. He distrusted Slavic nationalist movements as a threat to his multi-ethnic empire.<ref>Macmillan, ''The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914'' (2013) pp 212-44.</ref><ref>Solomon Wank, \"Foreign Policy and the Nationality Problem in Austria-Hungary, 1867\u20131914.\" ''Austrian History Yearbook'' 3.3 (1967): 37-56.</ref>  As tensions escalated in the early 20th century Austria Foreign-policy was set in 1906\u20131912 by its powerful foreign minister [[Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal|Count Aehrenthal]]. He was thoroughly convinced that the Slavic minorities could never come together, and the Balkan League would never accomplish any damage to Austria. 1912 he rejected an Ottoman proposal for an alliance that would include Austria, Turkey and Romania. His policies alienated the Bulgarians, who turned instead to Russia and Serbia. Although Austria had no intention to embark on additional expansion to the south, Aehrenthal encouraged speculation to that effect, expecting it would paralyze the Balkan states. Instead, it incited them to feverish activity to create a defensive block to stop Austria.

In early January 1878 Turkey asked for an armistice; the British fleet arrived at Constantinople too late.

It rejected tariffs and practiced free trade. After losing power in Britain in 1874, Liberal leader Gladstone returned to center stage in 1876 by calling for a moralistic foreign policy, as opposed to the realism of his great adversary [[Benjamin Disraeli]]. The issue drew the party line between Gladstone's Liberals (who denounced the immoral Ottomans) and Disraeli's Conservatives (who downplayed the atrocities and supported the Ottoman Empire as an offset to Russian power).  Disraeli had threatened war with Russia on the issue and Gladstone argued he was wrong. Liberal opinion was convulsed by atrocities in the Balkans, in particular the massacre of more than 10,000 Christian Bulgars by Turkish irregulars. Gladstone denounced the Turks for committing \"abominable and bestial lusts ... at which Hell itself might almost blush\" and demanded they withdraw from European soil \"bag and baggage\". His pamphlet sold an astonishing 200,000 copies.<ref>Gladstone, '' Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East'' (1876) [https://archive.org/details/bulgarianhorror03gladgoog <!-- quote=inauthor:gladstone inauthor:william. --> online edition]  Disraeli wisecracked that, of all the Bulgarian horrors perhaps the pamphlet was greatest.</ref>\n\nThe climax was his \"[[Midlothian campaign]]\" of 1880 when he charged Disraeli's government with financial incompetence, neglecting domestic legislation, and mismanagement of foreign affairs. Gladstone felt a call from God to aid the Serbians and Bulgarians (who were Eastern Orthodox Christians); he spoke out like an ancient Hebrew prophet denouncing tyranny and oppression. The real audience was not the local electorate but Britain as a whole, especially the evangelical elements.  By appealing to vast audiences denouncing Disraeli's pro-Turkish foreign policy, Gladstone made himself a moral force in Europe, unified his party, and was carried back to power.<ref>M. A.

Bismarck made clear to all that Germany had no wish to add any territory in Europe, and he tried to oppose German colonial expansion. Bismarck feared that a hostile combination of Austria, France and Russia could overwhelm Germany. If two of them were allied, then the third would ally with Germany only if Germany conceded excessive demands. The solution was to ally with two of the three. In 1873 he formed the [[League of the Three Emperors]], an alliance of the kaiser of Germany, the tsar of Russia, and the emperor of Austria-Hungary. It protected Germany against a war with France. The three emperors together could control Eastern Europe, making sure that restive ethnic groups such as the Poles were kept in control. The Balkans posed a more serious issue, and Bismarck's solution was to give Austria predominance in the western areas, and Russia in the eastern areas. The system collapsed in 1887. Kaiser Wilhelm ousted Bismarck in 1890 and developed his own aggressive foreign policy. The Kaiser rejected the Russian alliance, and Russia in turn turned to an alliance with France.<ref>Raymond James Sontag, ''European Diplomatic History: 1871\u20131932'' (1933) pp 3\u201358</ref>\n\n====War in Sight crisis of 1875====\nBetween 1873 and 1877, Germany repeatedly intervened in the internal affairs of France's neighbors.<ref>Lothar Gall, ''Bismarck: The White Revolutionary, Volume 2: 1871\u20131898'' (1986) pp 46\u201348</ref>  In Belgium, Spain, and Italy, Bismarck exerted strong and sustained political pressure to support the election or appointment of liberal, anticlerical governments. This was part of an integrated strategy to promote [[republicanism]] in France by strategically and ideologically isolating the clerical-monarchist regime of President [[Patrice de Mac-Mahon, Duke of Magenta|Patrice de Mac-Mahon]]. It was hoped that by ringing France with a number of liberal states, French republicans could defeat MacMahon and his reactionary supporters. The modern concept of [[containment]] provides a useful model for understanding the dynamics of this policy.<ref>James Stone, \"Bismarck and the Containment of France, 1873\u20131877,\" ''Canadian Journal of History'' (1994) 29#2 pp 281\u2013304 [http://utpjournalsreview.com/index.php/CJOH/article/download/10365/9240 online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214134224/http://utpjournalsreview.com/index.php/CJOH/article/download/10365/9240 |date=14 December 2014 }}</ref>\n\nContainment almost got out of hand in 1875 in the \"War in Sight\" crisis. It was sparked by an editorial entitled \"Krieg-in-Sicht\" in an influential Berlin newspaper the ''Post''. It indicated some highly influential Germans, alarmed by France's rapid recovery from defeat in 1871 and its rearmament program, talked of launching a preventive war against France to hold it down. There was a war scare in Germany and France, and Britain and Russia made it clear they would not tolerate a preventive war. Bismarck did not want any war either, but the unexpected crisis forced him to take into account the fear and alarm that his bullying and Germany's fast-growing power was causing among its neighbors. The crisis reinforced Bismarck's determination that Germany had to work in proactive fashion to preserve the peace in Europe, rather than passively let events take their own course and react to them.<ref>Taylor, ''Struggle for Mastery,'' pp 225\u201327</ref><ref>William L.

This became possible in 1890, when Bismarck was dismissed from office, and Germany refused to renew the secret 1887 [[Reinsurance Treaty]] with Russia. That encouraged Russian expansion into Bulgaria and the Straits. It meant that both France and Russia were without major allies; France took the initiative and funding Russian economic development, and in exploring a military alliance.<ref> Norman Rich, ''Great power diplomacy, 1814\u20131914'' (1992) pp 260-62.</ref> Russia had never been friendly with France, and remembered the wars in the Crimea and the Napoleonic invasion; it saw republican France as a dangerous font of subversion to Russia's style of absolute monarchy. France, which had been shut out of the entire alliance system by Bismarck, decided to improve relations with Russia. It lent money to the Russians, expanded trade, and began selling warships after 1890. Meanwhile, after Bismarck lost office in 1890, there was no renewal of the Reinsurance treaty between Russia and Germany. The German bankers stopped lending to Russia, which increasingly depended on Paris banks.<ref>Barbara Jelavich, ''St. Petersburg and Moscow: Tsarist and Soviet Foreign Policy, 1814\u20131974'' (1974) pp 213\u2013220</ref>\n\nIn 1894 a secret treaty stipulated that Russia would come to the aid of France if France was attacked by Germany. Another stipulation was that in a war against Germany, France would immediately mobilize 1.3 million men, while Russia would mobilize 700,000 to 800,000. It provided that if any of the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria, Italy) mobilized its reserves in preparation for war, then both Russia and France would mobilize theirs. \"The mobilization is the declaration of war,\" the French chief of staff told Tsar Alexander III in 1892. \"To mobilize is to oblige one's neighbor to do the same.\" This set up the tripwire for July 1914.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jack Beatty|title=The Lost History of 1914: Reconsidering the Year the Great War Began|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsn33stuAdEC&pg=PA59|year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|page=59|accessdate=2016-02-24|isbn=9780802779106}}</ref><ref>For more elaborate detail, see Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848\u20131918''(1954) pp 334\u2013345, and William L.

In April 1909 the Treaty of Berlin was amended to reflect the fait accompli and bring the crisis to an end. The crisis permanently damaged relations between Austria-Hungary on one hand and Serbia, Italy and Russia on the other.  At the time it appeared to be a total diplomatic victory for Vienna, but Russia became determined not to back down again and hastened its military build-up.

Secondly, the Great Powers quarreled among themselves and failed to ensure that the Ottomans would carry out the needed reforms. This led the Balkan states to impose their own solution.  Most important, the members of the Balkan League were confident that it could defeat the Turks.

Militarism, alliances, imperialism, and ethnic nationalism played major roles.

Britain focused on building up its Royal Navy, already stronger than the next two navies combined. Germany, France, Austria, Italy and Russia, and some smaller countries, set up conscription systems whereby young men would serve from 1 to 3 years in the army, then spend the next 20 years or so in the reserves with annual summer training.

However strong public opinion regarding Alsace-Lorraine meant that friendship with Germany was impossible unless the provinces were returned, and public opinion in Germany would not allow a return to happen. So Germany worked to isolate France and France sought allies against Germany, especially Russia and Britain.<ref>Macmillan, ''The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914'' (2013) pp </ref>  Apart perhaps from the German threat, most French citizens ignored foreign affairs and colonial issues.

After Bismarck was fired, Kaiser Wilhelm took erratic positions that baffled diplomats. No one could quite figure out his goals. Germany ended its secret treaties with Russia, and rejected close ties with Britain. France saw its opportunity, as Russia was looking for a new partner and French financiers invested heavily in Russian economic development. In 1893 Paris and St. Petersburg signed an alliance. France was no longer isolated \u2013 but Germany was increasingly isolated and distrusted, with only Austria as a serious ally. The Triple Alliance included Germany, Austria, and Italy, but Italy had serious disputes with Austria, and switched sides when the world war erupted. Britain was also moving toward alliances, having abandoned its policy of splendid isolation.  By 1903, France settled its disputes with Britain. After Russia and Britain settled their disputes over Persia in 1907, the way was open for the Triple Entente of France, Britain, and Russia. It formed the basis of the Allies of the First World War.\n==== Franco-Russian Alliance ====\n{{Main|Franco-Russian Alliance}}\nFrance was deeply split between the monarchists on one side, and the Republicans on the other.  The Republicans at first seemed highly unlikely to welcome any military alliance with Russia.  That large nation was poor and not industrialized; it was intensely religious and authoritarian, with no sense of democracy or freedom for its peoples.  It oppressed Poland, and exiled, and even executed political liberals and radicals. At a time when French Republicans were rallying in the [[Dreyfus affair]] against anti-Semitism, Russia was the most notorious center in the world of anti-Semitic outrages, including multiple murderous large-scale pogroms against the Jews.  On the other hand, France was increasingly frustrated by Bismarck's success in isolating it diplomatically.  France had issues with Italy, which was allied with Germany and Austria-Hungary in the Triple Alliance.  Paris made a few overtures to Berlin, but they were rebuffed, and after 1900 there was a threat of war between France and Germany over Germany's attempt to deny French expansion into Morocco. Great Britain was still in its \"splendid isolation\" mode and after a major agreement in 1890 with Germany, it seemed especially favorable toward Berlin.  Colonial conflicts in Africa brought Britain and France to a major crisis The Fashoda crisis of 1898 brought Britain and France almost to the brink of war and ended with a humiliation of France that left it hostile to Britain. By 1892 Russia was the only opportunity for France to break out of its diplomatic isolation.  Russia had been allied with Germany the new Kaiser Wilhelm removed Bismarck in 1890 and in 1892 ended the \"Reinsurance treaty\" with Russia.  Russia was now alone diplomatically and like France, it needed a military alliance to contain the threat of Germany's strong army and military aggressiveness.  The pope, angered by German anti-Catholicism, worked diplomatically to bring Paris and St. Petersburg together.  Russia desperately needed money for our infrastructure of railways and ports facilities.  The German government refused to allow its banks to lend money to Russia, but French banks eagerly did so.  For example, it funded the essential trans-Siberian railway.  Negotiations were increasingly successful, and by 1895.  France and Russia had signed the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]], a strong military alliance to join together in war if Germany attacked either of them.  France had finally escaped its diplomatic isolation.<ref>John B.  Wolf, ''France 1814\u20131919: The rise of a Liberal-Democratic Society'' (1963)</ref><ref>William L. Langer, ''The diplomacy of Imperialism: 1890\u20131902'' (1960), pp 3-66.</ref>\n\nIn its continuing effort to isolate Germany, France went to great pains to woo Great Britain, notably in the 1904 [[Entente Cordiale]] with Great Britain, and finally the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] in 1907, which became the [[Triple Entente]]. Paris and London had a high-level military discussion about coordination in a joint war against Germany.  By 1914, Russia and France worked together, and Britain was hostile enough toward Germany to join them as soon as Germany invaded Belgium.<ref>Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe, 1848\u20131918'' (1954) pp 345, 403-26</ref>\n\n====Anglo-German relations deteriorate: 1880\u20131904====\nIn the 1880s relations between Britain and Germany improved as the key policy-makers, [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Prime Minister Lord Salisbury]] and Chancellor Bismarck were both realistic conservatives and largely in agreement on policies.<ref>J. A. S. Grenville, ''Lord Salisbury and Foreign Policy: The Close of the Nineteenth Century'' (1964).</ref> There were several proposals for a formal treaty relationship between Germany and Britain, but they went nowhere; Britain preferred to stand in what it called \"splendid isolation\".<ref>John Charmley, \"Splendid Isolation to Finest Hour: Britain as a Global Power, 1900\u20131950.\" ''Contemporary British History'' 18.3 (2004): 130-146.</ref> Nevertheless, a series of developments steadily improved their relations down to 1890, when Bismarck was fired by the aggressive new Kaiser Wilhelm II.  In January 1896 he escalated tensions with his [[Kruger telegram]] congratulating Boer President Kruger of the Transvaal for beating off the [[Jameson raid]]. German officials in Berlin had managed to stop the Kaiser from proposing a German protectorate over the Transvaal. In the [[Second Boer War]], Germany sympathised with the Boers.  In 1897 Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] became German Naval Secretary of State and began the transformation of German Navy from small, coastal defence force to a fleet meant to challenge British naval power. Tirpitz calls for ''Riskflotte'' (Risk Fleet) that would make it too risky for Britain to take on Germany as part of wider bid to alter the international balance of power decisively in Germany's favour.<ref>William L. Langer, ''The diplomacy of imperialism: 1890\u20131902'' (1951) pp 433-42.</ref> At the same time German foreign minister [[Bernhard von B\u00fclow]] called for ''[[Weltpolitik]]'' (World politics). It was the new policy of Germany to assert its claim to be a global power. Bismarck's conservativism was abandoned as Germany was intent on challenging and upsetting international order.<ref>Grenville, ''Lord Salisbury,'' pp 368-69.</ref> Thereafter relations deteriorated steadily.  London began to see Berlin as a hostile force and moved to friendlier relationships with France.<ref>Bernadotte Everly Schmitt, ''England and Germany, 1740\u20131914'' (1916)  pp 133-43.</ref>\n\n====Two crises in Morocco====\nMorocco on the northwest coast of Africa, was the last major territory in Africa not controlled by colonial power.  Morocco nominally was ruled by its Sultan. But in 1894 a child took the office, and soon died leaving chaos. By 1900, Morocco was the scene of multiple local wars started by pretenders to the sultanate, by bankruptcy of the treasury, and by multiple tribal revolts. No one was in charge. The French Foreign Minister [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]] saw the opportunity to stabilize the situation and expand the French overseas empire. General [[Hubert Lyautey]] wanted a more aggressive military policy using his French army based in Algeria. France decided to use both diplomacy and military force. With British approval, it would control the Sultan, ruling in his name and extending French control. British approval was received in the [[Entente Cordiale]] of 1904.<ref>Dennis Brogan, ''The Development of modern France, 1870\u20131939'' (1940) 392-95. </ref><ref> Kim Munholland, \"Rival Approaches to Morocco: Delcasse, Lyautey, and the Algerian-Moroccan Border, 1903\u20131905.\" ''French Historical Studies'' 5.3 (1968): 328-343.</ref> Germany did not want Morocco itself, but felt embarrassed that France was making gains while Germany was not.  On 31 March 1905, Germany's Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]  visited Morocco's capital, Tangier, and delivered a sabre-rattling speech demanding an international conference to ensure Morocco's independence, with war the alternative.  Germany's goal in the [[First Moroccan Crisis]] was to enhance its prestige and diminish the ''Entente Cordiale'' linking Britain and France.  Historian Heather Jones argues that Germany's use of warlike rhetoric was a deliberate diplomatic ploy:\n:Another German strategy was to stage dramatic gestures, and dangerously play up the threat of war, in the belief that this would impress upon other European powers the importance of consultation with Germany on imperial issues: the fact that France had not considered it necessary to make a bilateral agreement with Germany over Morocco rankled, especially given Germany was deeply insecure about its newly acquired Great Power status.  Hence Germany opted for an increase in belligerent rhetoric and, theatrically, Kaiser Wilhelm II dramatically interrupted a Mediterranean cruise to visit Tangier, where he declared Germany's support for the Sultan's independence and integrity of his kingdom, turning Morocco overnight into an international 'crisis.'<ref>Heather Jones, \"Algeciras Revisited: European Crisis and Conference Diplomacy, 16 January-7 April 1906.\" (EUI WorkingPaper MWP 2009/1, 2009),\n p 5 [http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/10527/MWP_2009_01.pdf?...1 online]</ref> Germany's plan backfired when Britain made it clear that in the event of a German attack on France, Britain would intervene on France's side. In 1906 the [[Algeciras Conference]] ended the crisis with a stinging diplomatic defeat for Germany as France gained the dominant role in Morocco.  The experience brought London and Paris much closer and set up the presumption they would be allies if Germany attacked either one.<ref>Margaret MacMillan, ''The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914''(2012) pp 378--398.</ref>  The German adventure resulted in failure as Germany was left more isolated and alienated.  A momentous consequence was the heightened sense of frustration and readiness for war in Germany.  It spread beyond the political elite to much of the press and most of the political parties except for the Liberals and Social Democrats on the left.  The Pan-German element grew in strength and denounced their government's retreat as treason, stepping up chauvinistic support for war.<ref>Immanuel Geiss, ''German Foreign Policy 1871 \u2013 1914'' (1976) 133-36.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Agadir Crisis]] of 1911 France used force to seize more control over Morocco. The German Foreign Minister [[Alfred von Kiderlen-Waechter]] was not opposed to these moves, but he felt Germany was entitled to some compensation elsewhere in Africa. He sent a small warship, made saber-rattling threats, and whipped up anger among German nationalists.  France and Germany soon agreed on a compromise.  However, the British cabinet was alarmed at Germany's aggressiveness toward France. David Lloyd George made a dramatic \"Mansion House\" speech that denounced the German move as an intolerable humiliation. There was talk of war, and Germany backed down. Relations between Berlin and London remained sour.<ref>Christopher Clark,  ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914'' (2012) pp 204-13.</ref><ref>Frank Maloy Anderson, and Amos Shartle Hershey, eds.

Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] (1849 \u2013 1930) dominated German naval policy from 1897 until 1916.<ref>[[Michael Epkenhans]], ''Tirpitz: Architect of the German High Seas Fleet'' (2008) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1574887327/ excerpt and text search], pp 23-62</ref> Before the German Empire formed in 1871, Prussia never had a real navy, nor did the other German states.  Tirpitz turned the modest little fleet into a world-class force that could threaten the British Royal Navy. The British responded with new technology typified by the [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|Dreadnaught revolution]], and remained in the lead.<ref>Margaret Macmillan, ''The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914'' (2013) ch 5</ref><ref>Brandenburg, ''From Bismarck to the World War: A History of German Foreign Policy 1870\u20131914'' (1927) pp 266=99, 394-417.</ref>\n\nGermany's navy was not strong enough to confront the British in World War I; the one great naval Battle of Jutland failed to end Britain's control of the seas or break the stifling blockade. Germany turned to submarine warfare. The laws of war required an effort be made to allow passengers and crew to board lifeboats before sinking a ship. The Germans disregarded the law and in the most dramatic episode sank the Lusitania in 1915 in a few minutes. The U.S. demanded it stop, and Germany did so.  Admiral [[Henning von Holtzendorff]]  (1853\u20131919), chief of the admiralty staff, argued successfully in early 1917 to resume the attacks and thus starve the British. The German high command realized the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare meant war with the United States but calculated that American mobilization would be too slow to stop a German victory on the Western Front.<ref>Dirk Steffen, \"The Holtzendorff Memorandum of 22 December 1916 and Germany's Declaration of Unrestricted U-boat Warfare.\" ''Journal of Military History'' 68.1 (2004): 215-224.

It saw the Central Powers (Germany and Austria-Hungary, later joined by the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria),  fighting the \"Entente\" or \"Allied\" powers, led by Britain, Russia and France from 1914, who were later joined by Italy in 1915, and other countries such as Romania in 1916.<ref name=\"John Horne 2012\">John Horne, ed. ''A Companion to World War I'' (2012)</ref>  The United States, initially neutral, tried to broker a settlement but in April, 1917, it declared war on Germany. The U.S. cooperated with the Allies but did not formally join them, and it negotiated peace separately. Despite overcoming Romania in 1916 and Russia in March 1918, the Central Powers collapsed in November, 1918; and Germany accepted an \"armistice\" that in practice was a total surrender.<ref name=\"John Horne 2012\"/>  Much of the diplomatic efforts of the major powers was oriented toward pushing neutral countries into the alliance with promises of rich territorial rewards. Britain, the United States and Germany spent large sums funding their allies.  Propaganda campaigns to maintain morale at home and undermine morale in the enemy camp, especially among minorities, were a priority for the major powers.  They also engaged in subversion, by subsidizing political groups that try to overthrow the enemy regime, as the Bolsheviks did in Russia in 1917.<ref>David Stevenson, ''The First World War and International Politics'' (1988).</ref>\nBoth sides made secret agreements with neutrals to entice them into joining the war in return for a slice of enemy territory after victory was achieved.  Some land was promised to several nations, so some promises therefore had to be broken. That left permanent bitter legacies, especially in Italy.<ref>J.A.S.

This article focuses on those '''African American veterans who were lynched after World War I'''.\n\n==Background==\n===WWI===\nWorld War I ended with the signing of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice of November 11, 1918]]. Though the fighting stopped, the war's potential to resume still existed and peace was only reached when representatives of Germany signed the [[Treaty of Versailles]] on June 28, 1919, exactly five years after the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]. The United States entered the war after it had been raging for years. When it did send men to the fronts of Europe, the [[United States Armed Forces]] remained segregated, with all-black and all-white units. Despite the segregation, many African Americans still volunteered to join the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] war effort. By the time of the armistice with Germany, more than 350,000 African Americans had joined the military to serve with the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] (AEF) on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].<ref name=\"Gilmore p.\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Gilmore|2007|p=}}</ref>\n\n===Reaction to returning Vets===\nDuring a homecoming celebration for African-American veterans of World War I in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] a [[1919 Norfolk race riot|race riot]] broke out on July 21, 1919. At least two people were killed and six people were shot. City officials had to call in the Marines and Navy personnel to restore order.\n\nOn August 16, 1917, [[James K. Vardaman|Senator James K. Vardaman]] of Mississippi spoke of his fear of Black veterans returning to the South, as he viewed that it would \u201cinevitably lead to disaster.\"{{sfn|Equal Justice Initiative|2019|p=}} To the American South, the use of black soldiers in the military was a threat, not a virtue. \u201cImpress the negro with the fact that he is defending the flag, inflate his untutored soul with military airs, teach him that it is his duty to keep the emblem of the Nation flying triumphantly in the air,\u201d and, the senator cautioned, \u201cit is but a short step to the conclusion that his political rights must be respected.\"{{sfn|Equal Justice Initiative|2019|p=}}\n\nOften violence broke out between serving members of the military. In both the [[Bisbee Riot|Bisbee Race Riot (July 3, 1919)]] and the [[New London riots of 1919]] active African-American service members were attacked by white mobs or white military units.\n\nMany Black soldiers in the years after the war were threatened with violence if they were caught wearing their uniform.{{sfn|Equal Justice Initiative|2019|p=}} Many others were even physically attacked, sometimes barely escaping with their lives. During an April 5, 1919, market day in [[Sylvester, Georgia]], Black veteran [[Daniel Mack]] was walking through a busy street and brushed against a white man. The white man was offended that Mack didn't show the proper amount of respect and the two got in a scuffle; police came on the scene and promptly arrested Mack for assault. He was sentenced to 30 days in prison. A few days into his sentence, on April 14, a white mob broke into the prison, took him out into the wilderness and lynched Mack; he survived by playing dead.{{sfn|James|2013|p=79}} No arrests were ever made.{{sfn|The Chicago Defender|1919|p=}} [[Newberry 1919 lynching attempt|Elisha Harper]], 25 years old, was the son of the Rev.

On July 24, 1919, while walking the streets of [[Newberry, South Carolina]], he allegedly insulted a 14-year-old girl, who promptly reported him to the authorities. Harper was arrested and thrown in jail. Soon a white mob had gathered and would have lynched Harper if it was not for the local Sheriff who hid him away.{{sfn|The Herald and News|1919|p=1}}\n\n==Lynched African-American veterans ==\nThe following is an incomplete list of African Americans who had served in the military during WWI and were killed by white mobs with no trials for alleged crimes.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!

Attacks on black communities and white oppression spread to more than three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in [[Chicago]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the [[Elaine race riot]] in [[Arkansas]], where an estimated 100 to 240 blacks and 5 whites were killed. Other major events of Red Summer were the [[Chicago race riot of 1919|Chicago race riot]] and [[Washington race riot of 1919|Washington D.C. Race Riot]], which caused 38 and 39 deaths, respectively. Both riots had many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching up into the millions of dollars.{{sfn|The New York Times|1919|p=}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[[Washington race riot of 1919]]\n*[[Mass racial violence in the United States]]\n*[[List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist|20em}}\n'''References'''\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite news |ref=harv|date= July 31, 1919|title= Newberry Negro Sought by Crowd|last=The Bamberg Herald|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86063790/1919-07-31/ed-1/seq-1/#|newspaper=The Bamberg Herald|publisher=Henry S.

This article focuses on those '''African American veterans who were lynched after World War I'''.\n\n==Background==\n===WWI===\nWorld War I ended with the signing of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice of November 11, 1918]]. Though the fighting stopped, the war's potential to resume still existed and peace was only reached when representatives of Germany signed the [[Treaty of Versailles]] on June 28, 1919, exactly five years after the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]. The United States entered the war after it had been raging for years. When it did send men to the fronts of Europe, the [[United States Armed Forces]] remained segregated, with all-black and all-white units. Despite the segregation, many African Americans still volunteered to join the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] war effort. By the time of the armistice with Germany, more than 350,000 African Americans had joined the military to serve with the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] (AEF) on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].<ref name=\"Gilmore p.\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Gilmore|2007|p=}}</ref>\n\n===Reaction to returning Vets===\nDuring a homecoming celebration for African-American veterans of World War I in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] a [[1919 Norfolk race riot|race riot]] broke out on July 21, 1919. At least two people were killed and six people were shot. City officials had to call in the Marines and Navy personnel to restore order.\n\nOn August 16, 1917, [[James K. Vardaman|Senator James K. Vardaman]] of Mississippi spoke of his fear of Black veterans returning to the South, as he viewed that it would \u201cinevitably lead to disaster.\"{{sfn|Equal Justice Initiative|2019|p=}} To the American South, the use of black soldiers in the military was a threat, not a virtue. \u201cImpress the negro with the fact that he is defending the flag, inflate his untutored soul with military airs, teach him that it is his duty to keep the emblem of the Nation flying triumphantly in the air,\u201d and, the senator cautioned, \u201cit is but a short step to the conclusion that his political rights must be respected.\"{{sfn|Equal Justice Initiative|2019|p=}}\n\nOften violence broke out between serving members of the military. In both the [[Bisbee Riot|Bisbee Race Riot (July 3, 1919)]] and the [[New London riots of 1919]] active African-American service members were attacked by white mobs or white military units.\n\nMany Black soldiers in the years after the war were threatened with violence if they were caught wearing their uniform.{{sfn|Equal Justice Initiative|2019|p=}} Many others were even physically attacked, sometimes barely escaping with their lives. During an April 5, 1919, market day in [[Sylvester, Georgia]], Black veteran [[Daniel Mack]] was walking through a busy street and brushed against a white man. The white man was offended that Mack didn't show the proper amount of respect and the two got in a scuffle; police came on the scene and promptly arrested Mack for assault. He was sentenced to 30 days in prison. A few days into his sentence, on April 14, a white mob broke into the prison, took him out into the wilderness and lynched Mack; he survived by playing dead.{{sfn|James|2013|p=79}} No arrests were ever made.{{sfn|The Chicago Defender|1919|p=}} [[Newberry 1919 lynching attempt|Elisha Harper]], 25 years old, was the son of the Rev. T. F. Harper, a respectable and \"well-behaved preacher\" living in Helena.{{sfn|The Bamberg Herald|1919|p=1}} He fought in the army during [[World War I]] and just returned from Europe. On July 24, 1919, while walking the streets of [[Newberry, South Carolina]], he allegedly insulted a 14-year-old girl, who promptly reported him to the authorities. Harper was arrested and thrown in jail. Soon a white mob had gathered and would have lynched Harper if it was not for the local Sheriff who hid him away.{{sfn|The Herald and News|1919|p=1}}\n\n==Lynched African-American veterans ==\nThe following is an incomplete list of African Americans who had served in the military during WWI and were killed by white mobs with no trials for alleged crimes.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!

Attacks on black communities and white oppression spread to more than three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in [[Chicago]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the [[Elaine race riot]] in [[Arkansas]], where an estimated 100 to 240 blacks and 5 whites were killed. Other major events of Red Summer were the [[Chicago race riot of 1919|Chicago race riot]] and [[Washington race riot of 1919|Washington D.C. Race Riot]], which caused 38 and 39 deaths, respectively. Both riots had many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching up into the millions of dollars.{{sfn|The New York Times|1919|p=}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[[Washington race riot of 1919]]\n*[[Mass racial violence in the United States]]\n*[[List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist|20em}}\n'''References'''\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite news |ref=harv|date= July 31, 1919|title= Newberry Negro Sought by Crowd|last=The Bamberg Herald|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86063790/1919-07-31/ed-1/seq-1/#|newspaper=The Bamberg Herald|publisher=Henry S.
