It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

Cheetahs chirp when they are excited, for instance when gathered around a kill. Other uses include summoning of concealed or lost cubs by the mother, as a form of greeting or courtship between adults.<ref name=sh2003/> The cheetah's chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. <ref name=volodina/> A similar but louder call ('yelp') that can be heard from up to {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} away; this call is typically used by mothers to locate lost cubs, or by cubs to find their mothers and siblings.<ref name=wcw/><ref name=\"kingdon\">{{cite book |last1=Kingdon |first1=J. |authorlink=Jonathan Kingdon |title=The Kingdon Field Guide to African Mammals |chapter = Cheetah ''Acinonyx jubatus''|year=2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |isbn=978-1-4729-1236-7 |pages=403\u2013404 |edition=2nd |chapterurl = {{Google Books|id=gcrBDwAAQBAJ|pg=PT975|plainurl=yes}} }}</ref>\n\n* Churring (or churtling): A churr is a shrill, staccato call that can last up to 2 seconds.

Apart from chirping, mothers can use a repeated ''ihn ihn'' is to gather cubs, and a ''prr prr'' is to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still. Bickering cubs can let out a 'whirr'{{snds}}the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=sh2003/>\n\nAnother major means of communication is by [[olfactory communication|scent]]{{snds}}males often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then they will themselves urinate there and sniff at their own scent before leaving; other observing individuals might repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males do. Among females, those in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and their excrement can attract males from far off. Males marking their territory by urination stand close to an elevated spot (such as tree trunks, stumps or rocks) with the tail raised and the penis pointed at the area to be marked. In Botswana, cheetahs are frequently captured by ranchers who set up traps in traditional marking spots; the calls of the trapped cheetah can allure more cheetahs to the place.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/> \n\nTouch and visual cues are other ways of signaling in cheetahs. Social meetings involve mutual sniffing of the oral area, anus and genitals. Individuals will groom one another, lick each other's faces and rub cheeks. However they seldom lean on or rub their flanks against each other. The tear streaks on the face can sharply define expressions at close range. The alternate light and dark rings on the tail of a mother probably serve as a signal to cubs to follow her.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n===Diet and hunting===\n\nThe cheetah is a carnivore that hunts small- to medium-sized prey weighing {{convert|20|to|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but mostly below {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The primary prey are medium-sized ungulates; some ungulates are the major diet in certain areas, such as [[Dama gazelle|Dama]] and [[Dorcas gazelle|Dorcas]] [[gazelle]]s in the Sahara, [[impala]] in the eastern and southern African woodlands, [[springbok]] in the arid savannas to the south and [[Thomson's gazelle]] in the Serengeti; in India cheetahs used to prey mostly on [[blackbuck]]. Smaller antelopes such as the [[common duiker]] are a common prey in the southern Kalahari. Larger ungulates are typically avoided, though [[nyala]], whose males weigh around {{convert|120|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, were found to be the major prey in a study in the Phinda Game Reserve.

Alternatively the cheetah can lay hidden in cover and wait for the prey to come nearer. A stalking cheetah assumes a partially crouched posture, with the head lower than the shoulders; it will move slowly and turn still at times. In areas of minimal cover the cheetah will approach within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the prey and start the chase. The chase typically lasts a minute; in a 2013 study the length of chases averaged {{convert|173|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the longest run measured {{convert|559|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah can give up the chase if it is detected by the prey early or if it can not make a kill quickly.

They typically begin with the hindquarters, and then progress toward the abdomen and the spine. Rib bones are chewed on at the ends, and the limbs are not generally torn apart while eating. Unless the prey is very small, the skeleton is left almost intact after feeding on the meat. Cheetahs might lose 10\u221215% of their kills to large carnivores such as hyenas and lions ([[grey wolf|grey wolves]] in Iran).

In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia until as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].

It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

Cheetahs chirp when they are excited, for instance when gathered around a kill. Other uses include summoning of concealed or lost cubs by the mother, as a form of greeting or courtship between adults.<ref name=sh2003/> The cheetah's chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. <ref name=volodina/> A similar but louder call ('yelp') that can be heard from up to {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} away; this call is typically used by mothers to locate lost cubs, or by cubs to find their mothers and siblings.<ref name=wcw/><ref name=\"kingdon\">{{cite book |last1=Kingdon |first1=J. |authorlink=Jonathan Kingdon |title=The Kingdon Field Guide to African Mammals |chapter = Cheetah ''Acinonyx jubatus''|year=2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |isbn=978-1-4729-1236-7 |pages=403\u2013404 |edition=2nd |chapterurl = {{Google Books|id=gcrBDwAAQBAJ|pg=PT975|plainurl=yes}} }}</ref>\n\n* Churring (or churtling): A churr is a shrill, staccato call that can last up to 2 seconds.

Apart from chirping, mothers can use a repeated ''ihn ihn'' is to gather cubs, and a ''prr prr'' is to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still. Bickering cubs can let out a 'whirr'{{snds}}the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=sh2003/>\n\nAnother major means of communication is by [[olfactory communication|scent]]{{snds}}males often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then they will themselves urinate there and sniff at their own scent before leaving; other observing individuals might repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males do. Among females, those in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and their excrement can attract males from far off. Males marking their territory by urination stand close to an elevated spot (such as tree trunks, stumps or rocks) with the tail raised and the penis pointed at the area to be marked. In Botswana, cheetahs are frequently captured by ranchers who set up traps in traditional marking spots; the calls of the trapped cheetah can allure more cheetahs to the place.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/> \n\nTouch and visual cues are other ways of signaling in cheetahs. Social meetings involve mutual sniffing of the oral area, anus and genitals. Individuals will groom one another, lick each other's faces and rub cheeks. However they seldom lean on or rub their flanks against each other. The tear streaks on the face can sharply define expressions at close range. The alternate light and dark rings on the tail of a mother probably serve as a signal to cubs to follow her.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n===Diet and hunting===\n\nThe cheetah is a carnivore that hunts small- to medium-sized prey weighing {{convert|20|to|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but mostly below {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The primary prey are medium-sized ungulates; some ungulates are the major diet in certain areas, such as [[Dama gazelle|Dama]] and [[Dorcas gazelle|Dorcas]] [[gazelle]]s in the Sahara, [[impala]] in the eastern and southern African woodlands, [[springbok]] in the arid savannas to the south and [[Thomson's gazelle]] in the Serengeti; in India cheetahs used to prey mostly on [[blackbuck]]. Smaller antelopes such as the [[common duiker]] are a common prey in the southern Kalahari.

The cheetah will stalk its prey, trying to conceal itself in cover, and try to approach as close as possible, often within {{convert|60|to|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the prey (or even farther for less alert prey). Alternatively the cheetah can lay hidden in cover and wait for the prey to come nearer. A stalking cheetah assumes a partially crouched posture, with the head lower than the shoulders; it will move slowly and turn still at times. In areas of minimal cover the cheetah will approach within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the prey and start the chase. The chase typically lasts a minute; in a 2013 study the length of chases averaged {{convert|173|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the longest run measured {{convert|559|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah can give up the chase if it is detected by the prey early or if it can not make a kill quickly. Cheetahs kill their prey by tripping it during the chase by hitting its rump with the forepaw or using the strong dewclaw to knock the prey off its balance, bringing it down with much force and sometimes even breaking one of its limbs.<ref name=wcw/><ref name=Estes/> Cheetahs can decelerate extremely fast towards the end of the hunt, slowing down from {{convert|58|mph|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on}} to {{convert|14|mph|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on}} in just three strides, and can easily follow any twists and turns the prey makes as it tries to flee.<ref name=hunterwcw/> To kill medium- to large-sized prey the cheetah bites the prey's throat to suffocate it and lies down, maintaining the bite for around five minutes, within which the prey stops struggling. A bite on the nape of the neck or the snout (and sometimes on the skull) suffices to kill smaller prey.<ref name = wcw/><ref name=Estes/> Cheetahs have an average hunting success rate of 25\u201340%, higher for smaller and more vulnerable prey.<ref name = \"O'Brien\" /><ref name=hunterwcw/>\n\nOnce the hunt is over, the prey is taken near a bush or a tree; the cheetah, highly exhausted after the chase, rests beside the kill and pants heavily for five to 55 minutes.

Groups of cheetah devour the kill peacefully, though minor noises and snapping may be observed.<ref name=wcw/> Cheetahs can consume large quantities of food; a cheetah at the [[Etosha National Park]] was found to consume as much as {{convert|10|kg|lb}} within two hours.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Phillips |first1 = J.

They typically begin with the hindquarters, and then progress toward the abdomen and the spine. Rib bones are chewed on at the ends, and the limbs are not generally torn apart while eating. Unless the prey is very small, the skeleton is left almost intact after feeding on the meat. Cheetahs might lose 10\u221215% of their kills to large carnivores such as hyenas and lions ([[grey wolf|grey wolves]] in Iran). To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls, and hitting the ground with the paws.<ref name=Estes/> Cheetahs have rarely been observed to feed on the kills of other carnivores; this may be due to [[vulture]]s and spotted hyena adroitly capturing and consuming heavy [[carrion|carcasses]] within a short time; male cheetahs often take kills from females.<ref name=hunterwcw/><ref name=wcw/><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Houston |first1 = D.

Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].

The bay is about {{convert|33|mi|km|abbr=on}} long; the lower bay is about {{convert|23|mi|km|abbr=on}} at its greatest width. It is deep enough to accommodate ocean-going vessels in the lower half without dredging; above the mouth of [[Dog River (Alabama)|Dog River]] the water becomes shoal, preventing [[Draft (hull)|deep-draft]] vessels from approaching the city.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe mouth of the bay is marked on the east by a long narrow peninsula of sand, Mobile Point, that separates Bon Secour Bay, where the Bon Secour River enters the larger bay, from the gulf. The point ends at the main channel into Mobile Bay, and here the United States government erected a pre-war fort to shield Mobile from enemy fleets.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAcross the entrance, the line of the peninsula is continued in a series of barrier islands, beginning with Dauphin<ref>Sometimes spelled Dauphine in contemporary accounts.</ref> Island. Northwest of Dauphin Island is Little Dauphin Island, then a series of minor islands that are interrupted by a secondary entrance to the bay, Grant's Pass.<ref>Grant Pass in present-day nomenclature.</ref> A few other small islands and shoals lie to the south of Dauphin Island, defining the main channel for as much as {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of the entrance.<ref>Wise, ''Lifeline of the Confederacy'', p. 20. Kinney, ''Battles and Leaders'', v. 4, p. 384, ''map''.</ref>\n\nRather early in the war, the Confederate government decided not to defend its entire coastline, but rather to concentrate its efforts on a few of its most important ports and harbors.<ref>Luraghi, ''History of the Confederate Navy'', p. 187. ORA I, v. 6, pp. 398, 826, 835.</ref> Following the loss of [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip|New Orleans]] in April 1862, Mobile became the only major port in the eastern Gulf of Mexico that needed to be defended.<ref>The only other remaining port was [[St. Marks, Florida]], which was too small for most steamships, and furthermore lacked rail connections with the interior. See Wise, ''Lifeline of the Confederacy'', pp. 80&ndash;81.</ref>\n\nThe city subsequently became the center for [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade running]] on the gulf. Most of the trade between the Confederacy, Havana, and other Caribbean ports passed through Mobile.<ref>Wise, ''Lifeline of the Confederacy'', pp, 168&ndash;180; appendices 11&ndash;14.</ref> A few attempts were mounted to break the blockade, but they were not large enough to have lasting impact.<ref>Scharf, ''History of the Confederate States Navy'', pp. 537&ndash;549.</ref> Among the most embarrassing episodes of the war for the U.S. Navy was the passage of the raider [[CSS Florida|CSS ''Florida'']] through the blockade into Mobile Bay on September 4, 1862; this was followed by her later escape through the same [[Union blockade|blockade]] on January 15, 1863.<ref>Scharf, ''History of the Confederate States Navy'', pp. 790&ndash;791.</ref>\n\n==Confederate defenses==\n===Land===\nMobile and Mobile Bay were within the Department of Alabama, Mississippi and East Louisiana, led by [[Major General (CSA)|Major General]] [[Dabney H. Maury]]. Although Mobile was the site of the department headquarters, Maury did not exercise immediate command of the forts at the entrance to the bay, and he was not present during the battle and ensuing siege. Local command was entrusted to [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brigadier General]] [[Richard L. Page]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe primary contribution of the Confederate Army to the defense of Mobile Bay was the three forts. [[Fort Morgan (Alabama)|Fort Morgan]] was a masonry structure dating from 1834.<ref>Faust, ''Encyclopedia of the Civil War'', entry for Fort Morgan.</ref> The fort mounted 46 guns, of which 11 were rifled. Its garrison numbered about 600.<ref>ORA I, v. 39/1, pp. 419&ndash;420.</ref>\n\nAcross the main channel from Fort Morgan on Dauphin Island was [[Fort Gaines (Alabama)|Fort Gaines]], containing 26 guns, and with a garrison of about 600. When Page was not present, command of the fort fell to [[Ranks and insignia of the Confederate States|Colonel]] [[Charles DeWitt Anderson|Charles D. Anderson]].<ref>Maury's report, ORA I, v. 39/1, p. 417. Canby asserted in his report (ORA I, v. 39/1, p. 403) that 818 enlisted men and 46 officers were captured with the surrender of Fort Gaines; this number is quoted by Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', p. 156. The discrepancy may be caused by the failure of Maury to include in his accounting reinforcements he rushed to the fort when he thought that the invaders could be repulsed (ORA I, v. 39/1, p. 417). On the other hand, all such numbers in the Civil War are unreliable.</ref>\n\nAt the western end of the bay was Fort Powell, smallest of the three, with 18 guns and about 140 men. It was commanded in Page's absence by [[Ranks and insignia of the Confederate States|Lieutenant Colonel]] James M. Williams.<ref>ORA I, v. 39/1, p. 441.</ref> All three forts were flawed in that their guns were unprotected against fire from the rear; in addition, forts Powell and Gaines lacked adequate traverses.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', pp. 74&ndash;75, 120&ndash;122. ORA I, v. 39/1, pp. 410, 411.</ref>\n\nThe raw numbers of troops available do not indicate how effectively they would fight. The war was already winding down, and assertions were made that the morale of the soldiers was bad. The judgment is hard to quantify, but it would explain at least in part the poor performance of the defenders.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', pp. 57&ndash;58. ORN I, v. 21, p. 364. ORA I, v. 39/1, p. 414.</ref>\n\nThe Confederate Torpedo Bureau, directed by Major General [[Gabriel J. Rains]], contributed a passive weapon to the defense. Men of the bureau had planted 67 \"torpedoes\" ([[naval mine]]s) across the entrance, leaving a gap on the eastern side of the channel so blockade runners and other friendly vessels could enter or leave the harbor.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', pp. 137&ndash;139. ORA I, v. 39/1, p. 433.</ref> The minefield was well marked by buoys, which Farragut knew well.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', pp. 67, 125. ORN I, v. 21, p. 373.</ref> Its purpose was not necessarily to sink enemy vessels trying to enter, but rather to force them to steer close to Fort Morgan and its guns.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Sea===\n[[File:Admiral Franklin Buchanan, Confederate States Navy.jpg|thumb|right|Admiral Franklin Buchanan, CSN]]\n\nThe Confederate Navy likewise used the time they were given to improve the defense. Three small sidewheel gunboats of traditional type were stationed in the bay: [[CSS Selma|CSS ''Selma'']], carrying four guns; [[CSS Morgan|''Morgan'']], with six guns; and [[CSS Gaines|''Gaines'']], also with six guns. In addition to these was the ironclad ram [[CSS Tennessee (1863)|CSS ''Tennessee'']], which, though carrying only six guns, was a far more impressive fighting machine by virtue of her armor.<ref>Opposing forces (Confederate), ''Battles and Leaders'', v. 4, p. 400.</ref>\n\n''Tennessee'' had been built on the [[Alabama River]] near the town of [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]]. Her guns were prepared under the direction of Commander [[Catesby ap Roger Jones]], who had commanded [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] (ex-USS ''Merrimack'') in her famous duel with {{USS|Monitor|1862|6}} on March 9, 1862,  the second day of the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]].<ref>Johnston, ''Battles and Leaders'', v. 4, p. 401. But see Still, ''Iron Afloat'', p. 196.</ref> Jones succ, but the bar had only {{convert|9|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} of water at high tide. To get her across, workers had to build a set of caissons, called \"camels\" by shipbuilders. These were fitted to her sides and pumped out, and barely lifted the ship enough to clear the bar. On May 18, 1864, she finally entered the lower bay.<ref>Still, ''Iron Afloat'', p. 202.</ref>\n\n''Tennessee'' was the only armored vessel that the Confederate Navy put into lower Mobile Bay,<ref>Early in the war, Alabama had acquired steamer ''Baltic'' and converted her into an ironclad ram, to serve in and near Mobile Bay. She was never effective, however, and her armor was removed to be used on another vessel, [[CSS Nashville|CSS ''Nashville'']]: Still, ''Iron Afloat'', pp. 80&ndash;81, 192.</ref> but there were plans for others. Buchanan hoped that he would have as many as eight, including a pair of floating batteries, with which he could challenge the Union blockade, attack Pensacola and perhaps even recapture New Orleans.<ref>Cahore, ''Naval campaigns of the Civil War'', p. 187.</ref> The manufacturing and transportation facilities of the South were not capable of this ambitious program, however. Some of the projected fleet were completed in time to defend Mobile after the lower bay had been lost, but they were not there when most needed. Nevertheless, they imparted some urgency to Farragut's plans to maintain the blockade.<ref>Still, ''Iron Afloat'', pp. 190&ndash;196.</ref>\n\n==The attackers==\n===Union Navy===\n[[File:Admiral David Farragut (1801\u20131870) - collodion, LC-BH82-4054 restored.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Rear Admiral David Glasgow Farragut, USN]]\n\nThe man who led the Union fleet at Mobile Bay was [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[David Farragut|David G. Farragut]], no longer Flag Officer Farragut. The U.S. Navy had undergone an organizational change in the second year of the war, one feature of which was the creation of the rank of Rear Admiral. The new rank implied that the ships of the navy would be employed as members of a fleet, not simply as collections of vessels with a common purpose.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe ships that made up his attacking fleet were of several distinct types, including some that had not even existed when the war began. Of the 18 vessels selected, eight were conventional wooden-hulled ships carrying large numbers of guns that fired broadside. Four of these had been with the [[West Gulf Blockading Squadron]] from the start (flagship {{USS|Hartford|1858|2}}, {{USS|Brooklyn|1858|2}}, {{USS|Richmond|1860|2}}, and {{USS|Oneida|1861|2}}) and had fought in its battles on the Mississippi. Two smaller gunboats had likewise been with Farragut since the capture of New Orleans: {{USS|Kennebec|1861|2}} and {{USS|Itasca|1861|2}}.<ref>''Battles and Leaders'', v. 2, p. 74.</ref>\n\n{{USS|Galena|1862|2}} was now very much like the others, but she had begun life as an experimental ironclad. Her armor had been found to be more hindrance than help, so it was removed.<ref>Tucker, ''Blue and Gray Navies'', p. 37.</ref> Three were double-enders ({{USS|Octorara|1861|2}}, {{USS|Metacomet|1863|2}}, and {{USS|Port Royal|1862|2}}), a type of warship that had been developed during the war to navigate the tortuous channels of the interior rivers. Finally, four were representatives of the New Navy: ironclad monitors. Of these, {{USS|Manhattan|1863|2}} and {{USS|Tecumseh|1863|2}} were improved versions of the original {{USS|Monitor|1862|2}}, featuring two large guns in a single turret. The {{USS|Chickasaw|1864|2}} and {{USS|Winnebago|1863|2}} were twin-turreted river monitors of light draft; each mounted four guns that were smaller than those carried by the other two.<ref>Opposing forces (Union), ''Battles and Leaders'', v. 4, p. 400</ref>\n\n===Union Army===\nArmy cooperation was needed to take and hold the enemy forts. The commander of the Military Division of West Mississippi was Major General [[Edward Richard Sprigg Canby]], a career soldier with whom Farragut worked in planning the attack on Mobile. He calculated that 5,000 soldiers could be taken from other responsibilities in the division, enough to effect a landing behind Fort Morgan and cut it off from communication with Mobile. Their plans were undercut, however, when General-in-Chief [[Ulysses S. Grant]] made an urgent call for troops to be sent to the Virginia theater, then entering its critical phase.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nCd their skirmish line less than a half mile away.<ref>Parker, ''The Battle of Mobile Bay'', pp. 17-18.</ref>\n\n==Opposing forces==\n===Union===\n{{further|Mobile Bay order of battle#Union|l1=Union order of battle}}\n\n===Confederate===\n{{further|Mobile Bay order of battle#Confederate|l1=Confederate order of battle}}\n\n==Battle and siege==\n[[Image:Battle of Mobile Bay.jpg|thumb|305px|Sketch of the battle, August 5, 1864.]]\n\nThe army landing force under Granger was ready to launch the attack on August 3, but Farragut wanted to wait for his fourth monitor [[USS Tecumseh (1863)|USS ''Tecumseh'']], expected at any moment but delayed at Pensacola. The admiral almost decided to proceed with only three monitors, and the army went ashore on Dauphin Island, acting under a misapprehension of naval intentions. The fleet was not ready to move yet, so the defenders were able to rush additional forces to Fort Gaines. After the battle, Farragut concluded that the delay had actually worked to the advantage of the Federal forces, as the reinforcements were not great enough to have any effect on the battle, but they were included in the surrender.<ref>ORN I, v. 21, p. 416.</ref>\n\nWhile the army was going ashore, ''Tecumseh'' made her belated appearance and Farragut made his final dispositions for the fleet. The 14 wooden-hulled vessels would be lashed together in pairs, in a reprise of a tactic that the admiral had used earlier at the [[Battle of Port Hudson]] at [[Port Hudson, Louisiana]].<ref>Farragut had tried to pass the Confederate works at Port Hudson on March 14, 1863, in support of the [[Vicksburg campaign]]. Only two of his seven ships got through, but the attempt was regarded as a success nonetheless. See Anderson, ''By Sea and by River'', p. 145.</ref> The intent was that, if a ship were to be disabled by battle damage to her engines, her partner would be able to keep her moving.\n\nThe monitors would form a column and lead the way into the bay, moving in close to Fort Morgan on the right side of the channel as they went in. The other ships would form a separate double column and pass on the port side of the monitors, so that the armored ships would shield their wooden sisters from the guns of the fort. When the Confederate fleet made its expected appearance, the monitors would move to attack the armored ''Tennessee'', while the rest of the fleet would fight the faster gunboats.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', p. 154. ORN I, v. 21, pp. 416&ndash;417.</ref>\n\n===Passing the forts===\n[[File:Mobile Bay Navy Memorial.jpg|thumb|Plaque commemorating the battle at the [[United States Navy Memorial]] in Washington, D.C.]]\n\nAt dawn on August 5, conditions were nearly ideal for the attack. The tide was running in, so Farragut had his ships reduce steam pressure in order to minimize damage if their boilers were hit; he relied on the current to give them speed. The southwest breeze that ady for the attack, and they moved into position to intercept the Union fleet just beyond the minefield. At 6:47&nbsp;a.m., ''Tecumseh'' fired the first shot, the forts replied, and the action became general.e damage in the middle of the bay, but Buchanan instead decided to take on the entire Federal fleet single-handed. Possibly he hoped to repeat the ramming tactics that had been so successful at Hampton Roads two years earlier; Buchanan did not explain his reasoning.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThis time, the ships that hehe shutters on her gun ports were jammed, rendering the guns behind them useless. ''Chickasaw'' took up position at her stern, and ''Manhattan'' began to pummel the ram with her {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns. The heavy shot bent in the iron shield and shattered its oak backing.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n[[File:CSSTennessee.jpg|thum\n===Forts Powell and Gaines===\n{{see also|Siege of Fort Gaines}}\nWith the fleet no longer facing opposition from the Confederate Navy, Farragut could pay some attention to the forts. He dispatched monitor ''Chickasaw'' to throw a few shells at Fort Powell and then to assist the troops ashore at Fort Gaines. Although neither fort suffered significant casualties or damage, the bombardment was sufficient to reveal the vulnerability of each to fire from the rear.\n\nAt Fort Powell, Lt. Col. Williams asked for instructions from Brig. Gen. Page. Page responded with ambiguous orders that may have been appropriate for spirited troops, but were disastrous when issued to men as seemingly demoralized as those at Fort Powell: \"When no longer tenable, save your garrison. Hold out as long as you can.\" Williams was convinced that resistance was futile, so he [[Touch hole|spiked his guns]] and blew up his magazines; then he and his garrison waded to the mainland and made their way to Mobile.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', pp. 228&ndash;229. ORA I, v. 39/1, p. 436.</ref>row strip of mainland behind Fort Morgan, where they were landed without opposition about {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}} away, well out of range of its guns. The fort was thus immediately invested, cut off from all communication with Mobile.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nGranger set about taking the fort by regular approaches &mdash; that is, establishing a sequence of trenches or other protective lines drawn ever closer to the objective, until finally its walls could be breached and it could be taken by assault. His first line was a gift, a line of trenches {{convert|1,400|yd|m|abbr=on}} from the fort that had been prepared by the garrison of the fort and then for some reason abandoned. It was a little farther than he would have liked, but it served quite well. Additional parallels were built with little interference, as the laborers could work behind the sand dunes.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nWhile this was going on, monitors ''Winnebago'', ''Chickasaw'', and ''Manhattan'' were engaging in occasional bombardment. They were later joined by the former CSS ''Tennessee'', captured on August 5, since repaired, and now renamed USS ''Tennessee''. The most serious hindrance to the advance in this period was the weather; a storm on August 20 halted work for a while, and left standing water in low places. The fort was subjected to a day-long bombardment on August 22 from 16 siege mortars, 18 guns of various sizes, and the fleet, the monitors and ''Tennessee'' at short range and the rest of the ships at long range.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', p. 239. ORA I, v. 39/1, pp. 411&ndash;414.</ref>\n\n[[File:Fort Morgan.jpg|thumb|right|Fort Morgan as it appeared in 2008. The citadel was razed rather than rebuilt, and portions of it are now occupied by the Endicott Batteries.]]\nInside the fort, Brig. Gen. Page feared that the bombardment would endanger his magazines, which contained {{convert|80,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of powder. To avoid the risk, he had the powder brrigging. Still concerned for his safety, Captain Drayton had Flag Lieutenant [[J. Crittenden Watson]] tie him to the rigging again.<ref>Watson, ''Battles and Leaders'', v. 4, p. 407.</ref> Thus, the admiral had been tied to the rigging twice in the course of the battle.\n\n===Damn the torpedoes===\n[[File:David Farragut WWI poste\n\n===Army signals===\nPrior to the battle, army and navy used completely different signals. The navy used a cumbersome system of colored flags that would impart messages that had to be decoded, whereas the army was experimenting with a far simpler [[Wigwag (flag signals)|wigwag]]<ref>Akin to but not the same as semaphore</ref> system, recently developed by Col. [[Albert J. Myer]]. In order to communicate with army forces ashore after the fleet was safely inside Mobile Bay, several members of the fledgling Signal Corps were put on the major ships of Farragut's fleet.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', pp. 124, 178. ORN I, v. 21, p. 525.</ref> They were expected to stay out of the way until they were needed; those on ''Hartford'', for example, were assigned to assist the surgeon, so they were stationed below decks.\n\nWhen ''Brooklyn'' encountered her difficulties with ''Tecumseh'' and the minefield, Captain Avery of ''Brooklyn'' wanted clarification of his orders more rapidly than could be done with navy signals, so he asked his army representatives to relay his question to the flagship. In order to read the message, the signal corpsmen on ''Hartford'' were brought up from below, and they stayed up through the rest of the fight.<ref>Kinney, ''Battles and Leaders'', v. 4, pp. 379&ndash;400. Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', pp. 123&ndash;124, 170, 217&ndash;218.</ref> Their contribution was acknowledged by Farragut.<ref>ORN I, v. 21, p. 518.</ref>\n\n===Court martial of Brig. Gen. Page===\nAfter General Page surrendered Fort Morgan, the victors found that all of the fort's guns had been spiked, and gun carriages and other supplies destroyed. Some believed that much of the damage had been done while the white flag was flying, in violation of the rules of war as they were then understood. The belief was so strong that Canby made a formal accusation, and Page was tried in New Orleans by a three-man council of war to consider the charges. After reviewing the evidence, the court found him not guilty of the charges.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', p. 251.

It was only marginally, if at all, less bloody than the [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip]] and the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]].

Farragut]], assisted by a contingent of soldiers, attacked a smaller Confederate fleet led by [[Admiral]] [[Franklin Buchanan]] and three forts that guarded the entrance to [[Mobile Bay]]. A paraphrase of his order, \"Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!\" became famous. Farragut's actual order was \"Damn the torpedoes! Four bells. Captain Drayton, go ahead! Jouett, full speed!\".\n\nThe battle was marked by Farragut's seemingly rash but successful run through a minefield that had just claimed one of his [[ironclad warship|ironclad]] [[monitor (warship)|monitors]], enabling his fleet to get beyond the range of the shore-based guns. This was followed by a reduction of the Confederate fleet to a single vessel, ironclad [[CSS Tennessee (1863)|CSS ''Tennessee'']].\n\n''Tennessee'' did not then retire, but engaged the entire Northern fleet. ''Tennessee''{{'}}s armor enabled her to inflict more injury than she received, but she could not overcome the imbalance in numbers.  She was eventually reduced to a motionless hulk and surrendered, ending the battle. With no Navy to support them, the three forts also surrendered within days. Complete control of lower Mobile Bay thus passed to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces.\n\nMobile had been the last important port on the Gulf of Mexico east of the Mississippi River remaining in Confederate possession, so its closure was the final step in completing the blockade in that region.\n\nThis Union victory, together with the [[Atlanta Campaign|capture of Atlanta]], was extensively covered by Union newspapers and was a significant boost for [[1864 United States presidential election|Abraham Lincoln's bid for re-election]] three months after the battle.\n\n==Mobile and Mobile Bay==\n[[Image:Battle of Mobile Bay map.jpg|thumb|305px<!--meant to match infobox width-->|Map of Mobile Bay, 1861: shows [[Fort Gaines (Alabama)|Fort Gaines]] (lower center) on Dauphin Island, west of [[Fort Morgan (Alabama)|Fort Morgan]], across the bay entrance.]] The city of Mobile is situated near the head of Mobile Bay, where a natural harbor is formed by the meeting of the [[Mobile River|Mobile]] and [[Tensaw River|Tensaw]] rivers. The bay is about {{convert|33|mi|km|abbr=on}} long; the lower bay is about {{convert|23|mi|km|abbr=on}} at its greatest width. It is deep enough to accommodate ocean-going vessels in the lower half without dredging; above the mouth of [[Dog River (Alabama)|Dog River]] the water becomes shoal, preventing [[Draft (hull)|deep-draft]] vessels from approaching the city.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe mouth of the bay is marked on the east by a long narrow peninsula of sand, Mobile Point, that separates Bon Secour Bay, where the Bon Secour River enters the larger bay, from the gulf. The point ends at the main channel into Mobile Bay, and here the United States government erected a pre-war fort to shield Mobile from enemy fleets.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAcross the entrance, the line of the peninsula is continued in a series of barrier islands, beginning with Dauphin<ref>Sometimes spelled Dauphine in contemporary accounts.</ref> Island. Northwest of Dauphin Island is Little Dauphin Island, then a series of minor islands that are interrupted by a secondary entrance to the bay, Grant's Pass.<ref>Grant Pass in present-day nomenclature.</ref> A few other small islands and shoals lie to the south of Dauphin Island, defining the main channel for as much as {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of the entrance.<ref>Wise, ''Lifeline of the Confederacy'', p. 20. Kinney, ''Battles and Leaders'', v. 4, p. 384, ''map''.</ref>\n\nRather early in the war, the Confederate government decided not to defend its entire coastline, but rather to concentrate its efforts on a few of its most important ports and harbors.<ref>Luraghi, ''History of the Confederate Navy'', p. 187. ORA I, v. 6, pp. 398, 826, 835.</ref> Following the loss of [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip|New Orleans]] in April 1862, Mobile became the only major port in the eastern Gulf of Mexico that needed to be defended.<ref>The only other remaining port was [[St. Marks, Florida]], which was too small for most steamships, and furthermore lacked rail connections with the interior. See Wise, ''Lifeline of the Confederacy'', pp. 80&ndash;81.</ref>\n\nThe city subsequently became the center for [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade running]] on the gulf. Most of the trade between the Confederacy, Havana, and other Caribbean ports passed through Mobile.<ref>Wise, ''Lifeline of the Confederacy'', pp, 168&ndash;180; appendices 11&ndash;14.</ref> A few attempts were mounted to break the blockade, but they were not large enough to have lasting impact.<ref>Scharf, ''History of the Confederate States Navy'', pp. 537&ndash;549.</ref> Among the most embarrassing episodes of the war for the U.S. Navy was the passage of the raider [[CSS Florida|CSS ''Florida'']] through the blockade into Mobile Bay on September 4, 1862; this was followed by her later escape through the same [[Union blockade|blockade]] on January 15, 1863.<ref>Scharf, ''History of the Confederate States Navy'', pp. 790&ndash;791.</ref>\n\nAlthough the orders given to Flag Officer [[David Farragut|David G. Farragut]] when he was assigned to command of the [[West Gulf Blockading Squadron]] had included instructions to capture Mobile as well as New Orleans, the early diversion of the squadron into the campaign for the lower Mississippi meant that the city and its harbor would not receive full attention until after the fall of [[Vicksburg Campaign|Vicksburg]] in July 1863.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nGiven respite by the Union strategy, the Confederate Army improved the defenses of Mobile Bay by strengthening Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines at the entrance to the bay. In addition, they set up Fort Powell, a smaller work that guarded the Grant's Pass channel.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', p. 51. Kinney, ''Battles and Leaders'', v. 4, p. 385.</ref> Grant's Pass was also obstructed by a set of piles and other impediments, which had the effect of diverting the tidal flow to Heron Pass.<ref>ORN I, v. 21, p. 528. The piles also thwarted early CS Navy plans for cooperation between the defenses of Mobile and New Orleans. See Still, ''Iron Afloat'', p. 189.</ref>\n\n==Confederate defenses==\n===Land===\nMobile and Mobile Bay were within the Department of Alabama, Mississippi and East Louisiana, led by [[Major General (CSA)|Major General]] [[Dabney H. Maury]]. Although Mobile was the site of the department headquarters, Maury did not exercise immediate command of the forts at the entrance to the bay, and he was not present during the battle and ensuing siege. Local command was entrusted to [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brigadier General]] [[Richard L. Page]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe primary contribution of the Confederate Army to the defense of Mobile Bay was the three forts. [[Fort Morgan (Alabama)|Fort Morgan]] was a masonry structure dating from 1834.<ref>Faust, ''Encyclopedia of the Civil War'', entry for Fort Morgan.</ref> The fort mounted 46 guns, of which 11 were rifled. Its garrison numbered about 600.<ref>ORA I, v. 39/1, pp. 419&ndash;420.</ref>\n\nAcross the main channel from Fort Morgan on Dauphin Island was [[Fort Gaines (Alabama)|Fort Gaines]], containing 26 guns, and with a garrison of about 600. When Page was not present, command of the fort fell to [[Ranks and insignia of the Confederate States|Colonel]] [[Charles DeWitt Anderson|Charles D. Anderson]].<ref>Maury's report, ORA I, v. 39/1, p. 417. Canby asserted in his report (ORA I, v. 39/1, p. 403) that 818 enlisted men and 46 officers were captured with the surrender of Fort Gaines; this number is quoted by Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', p. 156. The discrepancy may be caused by the failure of Maury to include in his accounting reinforcements he rushed to the fort when he thought that the invaders could be repulsed (ORA I, v. 39/1, p. 417). On the other hand, all such numbers in the Civil War are unreliable.</ref>\n\nAt the western end of the bay was Fort Powell, smallest of the three, with 18 guns and about 140 men. It was commanded in Page's absence by [[Ranks and insignia of the Confederate States|Lieutenant Colonel]] James M. Williams.<ref>ORA I, v. 39/1, p. 441.</ref> All three forts were flawed in that their guns were unprotected against fire from the rear; in addition, forts Powell and Gaines lacked adequate traverses.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', pp. 74&ndash;75, 120&ndash;122. ORA I, v. 39/1, pp. 410, 411.</ref>\n\nThe raw numbers of troops available do not indicate how effectively they would fight. The war was already winding down, and assertions were made that the morale of the soldiers was bad. The judgment is hard to quantify, but it would explain at least in part the poor performance of the defenders.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', pp. 57&ndash;58. ORN I, v. 21, p. 364. ORA I, v. 39/1, p. 414.</ref>\n\nThe Confederate Torpedo Bureau, directed by Major General [[Gabriel J. Rains]], contributed a passive weapon to the defense. Men of the bureau had planted 67 \"torpedoes\" ([[naval mine]]s) across the entrance, leaving a gap on the eastern side of the channel so blockade runners and other friendly vessels could enter or leave the harbor.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', pp. 137&ndash;139. ORA I, v. 39/1, p. 433.</ref> The minefield was well marked by buoys, which Farragut knew well.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', pp. 67, 125. ORN I, v. 21, p. 373.</ref> Its purpose was not necessarily to sink enemy vessels trying to enter, but rather to force them to steer close to Fort Morgan and its guns.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Sea===\n[[File:Admiral Franklin Buchanan, Confederate States Navy.jpg|thumb|right|Admiral Franklin Buchanan, CSN]]\n\nThe Confederate Navy likewise used the time they were given to improve the defense. Three small sidewheel gunboats of traditional type were stationed in the bay: [[CSS Selma|CSS ''Selma'']], carrying four guns; [[CSS Morgan|''Morgan'']], with six guns; and [[CSS Gaines|''Gaines'']], also with six guns. In addition to these was the ironclad ram [[CSS Tennessee (1863)|CSS ''Tennessee'']], which, though carrying only six guns, was a far more impressive fighting machine by virtue of her armor.<ref>Opposing forces (Confederate), ''Battles and Leaders'', v. 4, p. 400.</ref>\n\n''Tennessee'' had been built on the [[Alabama River]] near the town of [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]]. Her guns were prepared under the direction of Commander [[Catesby ap Roger Jones]], who had commanded [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] (ex-USS ''Merrimack'') in her famous duel with {{USS|Monitor|1862|6}} on March 9, 1862,  the second day of the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]].<ref>Johnston, ''Battles and Leaders'', v. 4, p. 401. But see Still, ''Iron Afloat'', p. 196.</ref> Jones succeeded to command of ''Virginia'' after her original commander, [[Franklin Buchanan]], was wounded the previous day. Buchanan had been promoted to the rank of admiral for his exploits that day, the first admiral in the Confederacy. Admiral Buchanan was now in command of the small Confederate flotilla at Mobile.<ref>Still, ''Iron Afloat,'', p. 190. Chief Naval Constructor [[John L. Porter]] was active in the design of both ''Tennessee'' and ''Virginia''. This is not surprising, as most Confederate ironclads were prepared from Porter's basic designs. See Still, p. 94.</ref>\n\nLaunched before her machinery and guns were in place, ''Tennessee'' was towed down to Mobile Bay for completion. Once that was done she had to cross the Dog River Bar to get into the lower bay. ''Tennessee'' drew {{convert|13|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}, but the bar had only {{convert|9|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} of water at high tide. To get her across, workers had to build a set of caissons, called \"camels\" by shipbuilders. These were fitted to her sides and pumped out, and barely lifted the ship enough to clear the bar. On May 18, 1864, she finally entered the lower bay.<ref>Still, ''Iron Afloat'', p. 202.</ref>\n\n''Tennessee'' was the only armored vessel that the Confederate Navy put into lower Mobile Bay,<ref>Early in the war, Alabama had acquired steamer ''Baltic'' and converted her into an ironclad ram, to serve in and near Mobile Bay. She was never effective, however, and her armor was removed to be used on another vessel, [[CSS Nashville|CSS ''Nashville'']]: Still, ''Iron Afloat'', pp. 80&ndash;81, 192.</ref> but there were plans for others. Buchanan hoped that he would have as many as eight, including a pair of floating batteries, with which he could challenge the Union blockade, attack Pensacola and perhaps even recapture New Orleans.<ref>Cahore, ''Naval campaigns of the Civil War'', p. 187.</ref> The manufacturing and transportation facilities of the South were not capable of this ambitious program, however. Some of the projected fleet were completed in time to defend Mobile after the lower bay had been lost, but they were not there when most needed. Nevertheless, they imparted some urgency to Farragut's plans to maintain the blockade.<ref>Still, ''Iron Afloat'', pp. 190&ndash;196.</ref>\n\n==The attackers==\n===Union Navy===\n[[File:Admiral David Farragut (1801\u20131870) - collodion, LC-BH82-4054 restored.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Rear Admiral David Glasgow Farragut, USN]]\n\nThe man who led the Union fleet at Mobile Bay was [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[David Farragut|David G. Farragut]], no longer Flag Officer Farragut. The U.S. Navy had undergone an organizational change in the second year of the war, one feature of which was the creation of the rank of Rear Admiral. The new rank implied that the ships of the navy would be employed as members of a fleet, not simply as collections of vessels with a common purpose.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe ships that made up his attacking fleet were of several distinct types, including some that had not even existed when the war began. Of the 18 vessels selected, eight were conventional wooden-hulled ships carrying large numbers of guns that fired broadside. Four of these had been with the [[West Gulf Blockading Squadron]] from the start (flagship {{USS|Hartford|1858|2}}, {{USS|Brooklyn|1858|2}}, {{USS|Richmond|1860|2}}, and {{USS|Oneida|1861|2}}) and had fought in its battles on the Mississippi. Two smaller gunboats had likewise been with Farragut since the capture of New Orleans: {{USS|Kennebec|1861|2}} and {{USS|Itasca|1861|2}}.<ref>''Battles and Leaders'', v. 2, p. 74.</ref>\n\n{{USS|Galena|1862|2}} was now very much like the others, but she had begun life as an experimental ironclad. Her armor had been found to be more hindrance than help, so it was removed.<ref>Tucker, ''Blue and Gray Navies'', p. 37.</ref> Three were double-enders ({{USS|Octorara|1861|2}}, {{USS|Metacomet|1863|2}}, and {{USS|Port Royal|1862|2}}), a type of warship that had been developed during the war to navigate the tortuous channels of the interior rivers. Finally, four were representatives of the New Navy: ironclad monitors. Of these, {{USS|Manhattan|1863|2}} and {{USS|Tecumseh|1863|2}} were improved versions of the original {{USS|Monitor|1862|2}}, featuring two large guns in a single turret. The {{USS|Chickasaw|1864|2}} and {{USS|Winnebago|1863|2}} were twin-turreted river monitors of light draft; each mounted four guns that were smaller than those carried by the other two.<ref>Opposing forces (Union), ''Battles and Leaders'', v. 4, p. 400</ref>\n\n===Union Army===\nArmy cooperation was needed to take and hold the enemy forts. The commander of the Military Division of West Mississippi was Major General [[Edward Richard Sprigg Canby]], a career soldier with whom Farragut worked in planning the attack on Mobile. He calculated that 5,000 soldiers could be taken from other responsibilities in the division, enough to effect a landing behind Fort Morgan and cut it off from communication with Mobile. Their plans were undercut, however, when General-in-Chief [[Ulysses S. Grant]] made an urgent call for troops to be sent to the Virginia theater, then entering its critical phase.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nCanby then believed that he could spare no more than 2,000, not enough to invest the largest fort but enough to take Dauphin Island and thereby secure contact between the fleet inside the bay and their support in the gulf. Canby and Farragut recognized that they would not be able to threaten Mobile, but possession of the lower bay would be of great enough use to the blockading fleet that the projected attack should not be canceled.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', p. 76. ORN I, v. 21, pp. 380, 388.</ref>\n\nCommunication would be necessary between the fleet and the landing force, so Canby suggested that a contingent of his signal corpsmen be distributed among the major ships of Farragut's attacking force. Farragut accepted the offer. This almost casual mingling of the services was found quite useful during the battle.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', p. 76. Kinney, ''Battles and Leaders'', v. 4, p. 381.</ref>\n\nOn August 3, 1864, 1,500 men were landed approximately 15 miles west of the fort in preparation for the [[Siege of Fort Gaines]], while under protection from one of Farragut's flotillas. The troops consisted of infantry detachments from the [[77th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], [[34th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], [[96th Ohio Infantry]], and 3rd Maryland Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, with General [[Gordon Granger]] as commander. The troops then marched toward Fort Gaines. On the evening of August 4, they entrenched and formed their skirmish line less than a half mile away.<ref>Parker, ''The Battle of Mobile Bay'', pp. 17-18.</ref>\n\n==Opposing forces==\n===Union===\n{{further|Mobile Bay order of battle#Union|l1=Union order of battle}}\n\n===Confederate===\n{{further|Mobile Bay order of battle#Confederate|l1=Confederate order of battle}}\n\n==Battle and siege==\n[[Image:Battle of Mobile Bay.jpg|thumb|305px|Sketch of the battle, August 5, 1864.]]\n\nThe army landing force under Granger was ready to launch the attack on August 3, but Farragut wanted to wait for his fourth monitor [[USS Tecumseh (1863)|USS ''Tecumseh'']], expected at any moment but delayed at Pensacola. The admiral almost decided to proceed with only three monitors, and the army went ashore on Dauphin Island, acting under a misapprehension of naval intentions. The fleet was not ready to move yet, so the defenders were able to rush additional forces to Fort Gaines. After the battle, Farragut concluded that the delay had actually worked to the advantage of the Federal forces, as the reinforcements were not great enough to have any effect on the battle, but they were included in the surrender.<ref>ORN I, v. 21, p. 416.</ref>\n\nWhile the army was going ashore, ''Tecumseh'' made her belated appearance and Farragut made his final dispositions for the fleet. The 14 wooden-hulled vessels would be lashed together in pairs, in a reprise of a tactic that the admiral had used earlier at the [[Battle of Port Hudson]] at [[Port Hudson, Louisiana]].<ref>Farragut had tried to pass the Confederate works at Port Hudson on March 14, 1863, in support of the [[Vicksburg campaign]]. Only two of his seven ships got through, but the attempt was regarded as a success nonetheless. See Anderson, ''By Sea and by River'', p. 145.</ref> The intent was that, if a ship were to be disabled by battle damage to her engines, her partner would be able to keep her moving.\n\nThe monitors would form a column and lead the way into the bay, moving in close to Fort Morgan on the right side of the channel as they went in. The other ships would form a separate double column and pass on the port side of the monitors, so that the armored ships would shield their wooden sisters from the guns of the fort. When the Confederate fleet made its expected appearance, the monitors would move to attack the armored ''Tennessee'', while the rest of the fleet would fight the faster gunboats.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', p. 154. ORN I, v. 21, pp. 416&ndash;417.</ref>\n\n===Passing the forts===\n[[File:Mobile Bay Navy Memorial.jpg|thumb|Plaque commemorating the battle at the [[United States Navy Memorial]] in Washington, D.C.]]\n\nAt dawn on August 5, conditions were nearly ideal for the attack. The tide was running in, so Farragut had his ships reduce steam pressure in order to minimize damage if their boilers were hit; he relied on the current to give them speed. The southwest breeze that sprang up would carry smoke from the guns away from the fleet and into the faces of the artillerymen in Fort Morgan.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe fleet approached the fort with ''Tecumseh'',  ''Manhattan'', ''Winnebago'', and ''Chickasaw'' in order leading the way. The second column was led by ''Brooklyn'' lashed to ''Octorara''. ''Brooklyn'' had the lead because she carried four chase guns that could fire forward, while the other large ships had only two. She was also fitted with a device for removing mines, referred to as a \"cowcatcher\" by Farragut in his reports.<ref>ORN I, v. 21, p. 403.</ref> Following were ''Hartford'' and ''Metacomet'', ''Richmond'' and ''Port Royal'', [[USS Lackawanna (1862)|''Lackawanna'']] and [[USS Seminole (1859)|''Seminole'']], [[USS Monongahela (1862)|''Monongahela'']] and ''Kennebec'', [[USS Ossipee (1861)|''Ossipee'']] and ''Itasca'', and ''Oneida'' and ''Galena''.<ref>Calore, ''Naval Campaigns of the Civil War'', p. 189.</ref>\n\nThe Confederate ships were ready for the attack, and they moved into position to intercept the Union fleet just beyond the minefield. At 6:47&nbsp;a.m., ''Tecumseh'' fired the first shot, the forts replied, and the action became general.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', p. 166. ORN I, v. 21, p. 415&ndash;418.</ref> The ships in the second column (except for ''Brooklyn'') could not reply to the guns of the Confederate vessels, so they had to concentrate on the fort. Much of the damage done to the Federal fleet was caused by the enemy ships, perhaps because the fire from the fort was suppressed.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', p. 168. ORN I, v. 21, p. 418. The disposition of the Confederate ships was in what came to be known as \"crossing the T.\"</ref>\n\n[[Image:USS Tecumseh (1863).jpg|thumb|left|The sinking of the ''Tecumseh''.]]\nShortly after the start of the action, monitor ''Tecumseh'' moved past the fort and toward ''Tennessee'', apparently in obedience to that part of her orders. [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] [[Tunis A. M. Craven]] either disregarded or forgot the instruction to stay to the east of the minefield, so he took his ship directly across. Almost immediately, a torpedo went off under her hull, and she filled with water and sank in two or three minutes. Only 21 of her crew of 114 were saved. Craven was among those lost, so he could not explain his decisions.<ref>In an early account of the battle, Rear Admiral Foxhall A. Parker speculated that the poor steering of his monitor forced Craven's hand; see Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', p. 178.</ref>\n\nCaptain [[James Alden]] of ''Brooklyn'' was apparently confused by conflicting orders, to stay on the port side of the monitors and to stay to the right of the minefield, so he stopped his ship and signaled Farragut for instructions. Farragut would not stop the flagship; he ordered Captain [[Percival Drayton]] to send ''Hartford'' around ''Brooklyn'' and into the lead of the column. This took the ship into the torpedoes that had just sunk ''Tecumseh'', but Farragut was confident that most of them had been submerged too long to be effective. His gamble paid off, and the entire column of 14 warships passed through unharmed.<ref>Duffy, ''Lincoln's Admiral'', pp. 240&ndash;248.</ref>\n\n''Tennessee'' lacked the speed needed to ram the Union vessels as they passed, allowing Farragut to order some of his small, faster gunboats to attack the three Confederate gunboats. ''Metacomet'', unleashed from ''Hartford'', captured ''Selma''. Fire from the gunboats holed ''Gaines'', and she would have sunk had she not been beached; she was then burned by her crew. ''Morgan'' put up no resistance, but fled to the protection of the guns of Fort Morgan; next night she crept through the anchored Union fleet and escaped to Mobile.<ref>Anderson, ''By Sea and by River'', pp. 242&ndash;243.</ref>\n\n===Clash with CSS ''Tennessee''===\n[[File:Our navy in time of war (1861-1898) (1899) (14780685394).jpg|thumb|CSS ''Tennessee'' fights the Union fleet]]\n\nFarragut expected ''Tennessee'' to take shelter under the guns of Fort Morgan while he rested his ships and assessed battle damage in the middle of the bay, but Buchanan instead decided to take on the entire Federal fleet single-handed. Possibly he hoped to repeat the ramming tactics that had been so successful at Hampton Roads two years earlier; Buchanan did not explain his reasoning.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThis time, the ships that he was facing were in motion, and he had to contend with three monitors, not one. ''Tennessee'' was so slow that she became the target of ramming rather than her opponents. Several of the Federal sloops managed to ram, including ''Monongahela'', which had been fitted with an iron shield on her bow just for this purpose. None of the collisions harmed the ironclad; in every case, the ramming vessel suffered more. Shots from Farragut's fleet bounced off ''Tennessee''{{'}}s armor, but ''Tennessee''{{'}}s fire was ineffective due to inferior powder and multiple misfires.<ref>ORN I, v. 21, p. 418.</ref>\n\nThe balance was tilted finally when two monitors arrived. ''Tennessee'' was already almost motionless, her smokestack shot away and so unable to build up boiler pressure. Her rudder chains were parted so that she could not steer. Furthermore, some of the shutters on her gun ports were jammed, rendering the guns behind them useless. ''Chickasaw'' took up position at her stern, and ''Manhattan'' began to pummel the ram with her {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns. The heavy shot bent in the iron shield and shattered its oak backing.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n[[File:CSSTennessee.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|The Confederate [[ironclad]] CSS ''Tennessee'' taken after her capture by Federal forces.]]\nFragments killed or wounded some of the crew; one of the casualties was Admiral Buchanan himself, who suffered a badly broken leg. No longer able to fight, Commander [[James D. Johnston]], captain of ''Tennessee'', requested and received permission from the wounded admiral to surrender.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', p. 219&ndash;221. ORN I, v. 21, p. 419.</ref> A little more than three hours had elapsed since ''Tecumseh'' had fired the first shot.\n\n===Forts Powell and Gaines===\n{{see also|Siege of Fort Gaines}}\nWith the fleet no longer facing opposition from the Confederate Navy, Farragut could pay some attention to the forts. He dispatched monitor ''Chickasaw'' to throw a few shells at Fort Powell and then to assist the troops ashore at Fort Gaines. Although neither fort suffered significant casualties or damage, the bombardment was sufficient to reveal the vulnerability of each to fire from the rear.\n\nAt Fort Powell, Lt. Col. Williams asked for instructions from Brig. Gen. Page. Page responded with ambiguous orders that may have been appropriate for spirited troops, but were disastrous when issued to men as seemingly demoralized as those at Fort Powell: \"When no longer tenable, save your garrison. Hold out as long as you can.\" Williams was convinced that resistance was futile, so he [[Touch hole|spiked his guns]] and blew up his magazines; then he and his garrison waded to the mainland and made their way to Mobile.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', pp. 228&ndash;229. ORA I, v. 39/1, p. 436.</ref>\n\nCol. Anderson at Fort Gaines held out longer, although he faced a more formidable foe. Granger's soldiers vastly outnumbered his own, no matter whose figures for the garrison are accepted. The Union troops could bring their artillery up to close range with impunity, being shielded behind the sand dunes of Dauphin Island. In position, they were able to take in reverse two guns that fired on Farragut's fleet when it was entering the bay.\n\nIn the judgment of an engineering officer who inspected the fort after the Union army had taken possession, \"It was utterly weak and inefficient against our attack (land and naval), which would have taken all its fronts in front, enfilade, and reverse.\"<ref>ORA I, v. 39/1, p. 410.</ref> Recognizing that his situation was hopeless, Anderson opened communication with Granger and Farragut under a flag of truce; ignoring orders from Page forbidding him to do so (and eventually removing him from command), he surrendered the fort on August 8.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', p. 236. ORA I, v. 39/1, pp. 417&ndash;418.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Fort Morgan===\n{{see also|Siege of Fort Morgan}}\n[[File:Fort morgan alabama.jpg|thumb|left|The citadel at Fort Morgan as it appeared after its surrender following the Battle of Mobile Bay.]]\n\nAs soon as the surrender of Fort Gaines was completed, Granger moved his force from Dauphin Island to the narrow strip of mainland behind Fort Morgan, where they were landed without opposition about {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}} away, well out of range of its guns. The fort was thus immediately invested, cut off from all communication with Mobile.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nGranger set about taking the fort by regular approaches &mdash; that is, establishing a sequence of trenches or other protective lines drawn ever closer to the objective, until finally its walls could be breached and it could be taken by assault. His first line was a gift, a line of trenches {{convert|1,400|yd|m|abbr=on}} from the fort that had been prepared by the garrison of the fort and then for some reason abandoned. It was a little farther than he would have liked, but it served quite well. Additional parallels were built with little interference, as the laborers could work behind the sand dunes.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nWhile this was going on, monitors ''Winnebago'', ''Chickasaw'', and ''Manhattan'' were engaging in occasional bombardment. They were later joined by the former CSS ''Tennessee'', captured on August 5, since repaired, and now renamed USS ''Tennessee''. The most serious hindrance to the advance in this period was the weather; a storm on August 20 halted work for a while, and left standing water in low places. The fort was subjected to a day-long bombardment on August 22 from 16 siege mortars, 18 guns of various sizes, and the fleet, the monitors and ''Tennessee'' at short range and the rest of the ships at long range.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', p. 239. ORA I, v. 39/1, pp. 411&ndash;414.</ref>\n\n[[File:Fort Morgan.jpg|thumb|right|Fort Morgan as it appeared in 2008. The citadel was razed rather than rebuilt, and portions of it are now occupied by the Endicott Batteries.]]\nInside the fort, Brig. Gen. Page feared that the bombardment would endanger his magazines, which contained {{convert|80,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of powder. To avoid the risk, he had the powder brought out and flooded. That night, the magazines were indeed threatened when the woodwork of the citadel caught fire. The fire brought an increase in the rate of bombardment, and was extinguished only with great effort.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nFeeling now that further resistance was useless, on August 23 Page ordered his remaining guns spiked or otherwise destroyed as far as possible. At 6 AM, he ordered the white flag raised, and the siege was over.<ref>Page, ''Battles and Leaders'', v. 4, pp. 408&ndash;410. Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', pp. 239&ndash;240.</ref>\n\n==Incidents of the battle==\n===Farragut lashed to the rigging===\nAn anecdote of the battle that has some dramatic interest has it that Farragut was lashed to the mast during the passage of Fort Morgan. The image that it brings to mind is of absolute resolve: if his ship were to be sunk in the battle, he would go down with her. The truth, however, is more prosaic. He was indeed lashed to the rigging of the mainmast, but it was a precautionary move rather than an act of defiance. It came about after the battle had opened and smoke from the guns had clouded the air. In order to get a better view of the action, Farragut climbed into ''Hartford''{{'}}s rigging and soon was high enough that a fall would certainly incapacitate him and could have killed him. Seeing this, Captain Drayton sent a seaman aloft with a piece of line to secure the admiral. He demurred, saying, \"Never mind, I am all right,\" but the sailor obeyed his captain's orders, tying one end of the line to a forward shroud, then around the admiral and to the after shroud.<ref>Duffy, ''Lincoln's Admiral'', p. 243.</ref>\n\nLater, when CSS ''Tennessee'' made her unsupported attack on the Federal fleet, Farragut climbed into the mizzen rigging. Still concerned for his safety, Captain Drayton had Flag Lieutenant [[J. Crittenden Watson]] tie him to the rigging again.<ref>Watson, ''Battles and Leaders'', v. 4, p. 407.</ref> Thus, the admiral had been tied to the rigging twice in the course of the battle.\n\n===Damn the torpedoes===\n[[File:David Farragut WWI poster.jpg|upright|right|thumb|A [[World War I]] recruitment poster featuring David Farragut at Mobile Bay]]\nMost popular accounts of the battle relate that ''Brooklyn'' slowed when ''Tecumseh'' crossed her path, and Farragut asked why she was not moving ahead. The reply came back that [[Naval mine#19th century|naval mines]] (then called \"torpedoes\") were in her path\u2014to which he allegedly replied, \"Damn the torpedoes.\" The story did not appear in print until several years later, and some historians question whether it happened at all.<ref>Anderson, ''By Sea and by River,'', p. 242.</ref>\n\nSome forms of the story are highly unlikely; the most widespread is that he shouted to ''Brooklyn'', \"Damn the torpedoes! Go ahead!\" Men present at the battle doubted that any such verbal communication could be heard above the din of the guns. More likely, if it happened, is that he said to the captain of ''Hartford'', \"Damn the torpedoes. Four bells,<ref>\"Four bells\" was a signal to the engine room calling for full power. Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', p. 187.</ref> Captain Drayton.\" Then he shouted to the commander of ''Metacomet'', lashed to ''Hartford''{{'}}s side, \"Go ahead, [[James Edward Jouett|Jouett]], full speed.\" The words have been altered in time to the more familiar, \"Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!\"<ref>Duffy, ''Lincoln's admiral'', pp. 247&ndash;248.</ref>\n\n===Army signals===\nPrior to the battle, army and navy used completely different signals. The navy used a cumbersome system of colored flags that would impart messages that had to be decoded, whereas the army was experimenting with a far simpler [[Wigwag (flag signals)|wigwag]]<ref>Akin to but not the same as semaphore</ref> system, recently developed by Col. [[Albert J. Myer]]. In order to communicate with army forces ashore after the fleet was safely inside Mobile Bay, several members of the fledgling Signal Corps were put on the major ships of Farragut's fleet.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', pp. 124, 178. ORN I, v. 21, p. 525.</ref> They were expected to stay out of the way until they were needed; those on ''Hartford'', for example, were assigned to assist the surgeon, so they were stationed below decks.\n\nWhen ''Brooklyn'' encountered her difficulties with ''Tecumseh'' and the minefield, Captain Avery of ''Brooklyn'' wanted clarification of his orders more rapidly than could be done with navy signals, so he asked his army representatives to relay his question to the flagship. In order to read the message, the signal corpsmen on ''Hartford'' were brought up from below, and they stayed up through the rest of the fight.<ref>Kinney, ''Battles and Leaders'', v. 4, pp. 379&ndash;400. Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', pp. 123&ndash;124, 170, 217&ndash;218.</ref> Their contribution was acknowledged by Farragut.<ref>ORN I, v. 21, p. 518.</ref>\n\n===Court martial of Brig. Gen. Page===\nAfter General Page surrendered Fort Morgan, the victors found that all of the fort's guns had been spiked, and gun carriages and other supplies destroyed. Some believed that much of the damage had been done while the white flag was flying, in violation of the rules of war as they were then understood. The belief was so strong that Canby made a formal accusation, and Page was tried in New Orleans by a three-man council of war to consider the charges. After reviewing the evidence, the court found him not guilty of the charges.<ref>Friend, ''West Wind, Flood Tide'', p. 251. ORA I, v. 39/1, p. 405.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Battle of Mobile Bay was not bloody by standards set by the armies of the Civil War, but it was by naval standards. It was only marginally, if at all, less bloody than the [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip]] and the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]]. The Federal fleet had lost 150 men killed and 170 wounded; on the Confederate ships, only 12 were dead and 19 wounded.<ref>Musicant, ''Divided Waters'', p. 324.</ref> Union Army losses were very light; in the siege of Fort Morgan, only one man was killed and seven wounded.<ref>ORA I, v. 39/1, p. 404.</ref> Confederate losses, though not stated explicitly, seem to have been only slightly greater.<ref>Page, ''Battles and Leaders'', v. 4, p. 410.</ref>\n\nThe continued presence of a Union Army force near Mobile constrained the Confederate Army in its last desperate campaigns. Maury realized that the numbers opposite him were inadequate for an attack, but the loss of Mobile would have been such a severe blow to the public mood that he would not send his guns or spare troops to support other missions.<ref>ORA I, v. 39/1, p. 428.</ref>\n\nThis was particularly important to Maj. Gen. [[William T. Sherman]], who was at that time engaged in the [[Atlanta campaign]]. Because Mobile remained unconquered the significance of Farragut's victory initially had little effect on Northern public opinion. As time passed and a sequence of other Union victories seemed to show that the war was winding down, the battle began to loom larger.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nWhen Atlanta fell, in the words of historian [[James M. McPherson]], \"In retrospect the victory at Mobile Bay suddenly took on new importance as the first blow of a lethal one-two punch.\"<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry of Freedom'', p. 775.</ref> The dispersal of Northern gloom assured President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s re-election in what was regarded as a referendum on continuation of the war.\n\nWith the capture of Fort Morgan, the campaign for the lower Mobile Bay was complete. Canby and Farragut had already decided before the first landings on Dauphin Island that the army could not provide enough men to attack Mobile itself; furthermore, the Dog River Bar that had impeded bringing ''Tennessee'' down now prevented Farragut's fleet from going up. Mobile did come under combined army-navy attack, but only in March and April 1865, after Farragut had been replaced by Rear Adm. [[Henry K. Thatcher]]. The city finally fell in the last days of the war.<ref>Faust, ''Encyclopedia of the Civil War'', entry \"Mobile, Siege of.\"</ref>\n\nA number of Civil War-era shipwrecks from the battle and its aftermath remain in the bay into the present, including ''[[American Diver]]'', [[CSS Gaines|CSS ''Gaines'']], [[CSS Huntsville|CSS ''Huntsville'']], [[USS Philippi (1863)|USS ''Philippi'']], [[CSS Phoenix|CSS ''Phoenix'']], [[USS Rodolph (1863)|USS ''Rodolph'']], [[USS Tecumseh (1863)|USS ''Tecumseh'']], and [[CSS Tuscaloosa (ironclad)|CSS ''Tuscaloosa'']].<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Civil War Shipwrecks |last=Gaines |first=W.

''Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey''. New York: Warner Books, 1999.</ref> The chimps would also take twigs from trees and strip off the leaves to make the twig more effective, a form of object modification that is the rudimentary beginnings of toolmaking.<ref name=\"Chimp\" /> Humans had long distinguished ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom as \"Man the Toolmaker\". In response to Goodall's revolutionary findings, Louis Leakey wrote, \"We must now redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as human!\".<ref name=\"Chimp\" /><ref>[http://www.janegoodall.org/study-corner-tool-use Tool Use]</ref><ref name=\"Goodall\">The Jane Goodall Institute: [http://www.janegoodall.org/chimp_central/default.asp \"Chimpanzee Central\"], 2008.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the peaceful and affectionate behaviours she observed, Goodall also found an aggressive side of chimpanzee nature at Gombe Stream. She discovered that chimps will systematically hunt and eat smaller primates such as [[colobus]] monkeys.<ref name=\"PBS\" /> Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a colobus monkey high in a tree, block all possible exits, then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus.<ref name=\"Goodall\" /> The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing with other members of the troop in response to begging behaviours.<ref name=\"Goodall\" /> The chimps at Gombe kill and eat as much as one-third of the colobus population in the park each year.<ref name=\"PBS\" /> This alone was a major scientific find that challenged previous conceptions of chimpanzee diet and behaviour.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nBut perhaps more startling, and disturbing, was the tendency for aggression and violence within chimpanzee troops. Goodall observed dominant females deliberately killing the young of other females in the troop to maintain their dominance,<ref name=\"PBS\" /> sometimes going as far as [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]].<ref name=\"Chimp\" /> She says of this revelation, \"During the first ten years of the study I had believed [\u2026] that the Gombe chimpanzees were, for the most part, rather nicer than human beings. [\u2026] Then suddenly we found that chimpanzees could be brutal\u2014that they, like us, had a darker side to their nature.\"<ref name=\"Chimp\" /> She described the 1974\u20131978 [[Gombe Chimpanzee War]] in her memoir, ''Through a Window: My Thirty Years with the Chimpanzees of Gombe''. Her findings revolutionised contemporary knowledge of chimpanzee behaviour, and were further evidence of the social similarities between humans and chimpanzees, albeit in a much darker manner.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nGoodall also set herself apart from the traditional conventions of the time by naming the animals in her studies of primates, instead of assigning each a number. Numbering was a nearly universal practice at the time, and thought to be important in the removal of one's self from the potential for emotional attachment to the subject being studied. Setting herself apart from other researchers also led her to develop a close bond with the chimpanzees and to become, to this day, the only human ever accepted into chimpanzee society.  She was the lowest ranking member of a troop for a period of 22 months.

''Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey''. New York: Warner Books, 1999.</ref> The chimps would also take twigs from trees and strip off the leaves to make the twig more effective, a form of object modification that is the rudimentary beginnings of toolmaking.<ref name=\"Chimp\" /> Humans had long distinguished ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom as \"Man the Toolmaker\". In response to Goodall's revolutionary findings, Louis Leakey wrote, \"We must now redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as human!\".<ref name=\"Chimp\" /><ref>[http://www.janegoodall.org/study-corner-tool-use Tool Use]</ref><ref name=\"Goodall\">The Jane Goodall Institute: [http://www.janegoodall.org/chimp_central/default.asp \"Chimpanzee Central\"], 2008.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the peaceful and affectionate behaviours she observed, Goodall also found an aggressive side of chimpanzee nature at Gombe Stream. She discovered that chimps will systematically hunt and eat smaller primates such as [[colobus]] monkeys.<ref name=\"PBS\" /> Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a colobus monkey high in a tree, block all possible exits, then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus.<ref name=\"Goodall\" /> The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing with other members of the troop in response to begging behaviours.<ref name=\"Goodall\" /> The chimps at Gombe kill and eat as much as one-third of the colobus population in the park each year.<ref name=\"PBS\" /> This alone was a major scientific find that challenged previous conceptions of chimpanzee diet and behaviour.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nBut perhaps more startling, and disturbing, was the tendency for aggression and violence within chimpanzee troops. Goodall observed dominant females deliberately killing the young of other females in the troop to maintain their dominance,<ref name=\"PBS\" /> sometimes going as far as [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]].<ref name=\"Chimp\" /> She says of this revelation, \"During the first ten years of the study I had believed [\u2026] that the Gombe chimpanzees were, for the most part, rather nicer than human beings. [\u2026] Then suddenly we found that chimpanzees could be brutal\u2014that they, like us, had a darker side to their nature.\"<ref name=\"Chimp\" /> She described the 1974\u20131978 [[Gombe Chimpanzee War]] in her memoir, ''Through a Window: My Thirty Years with the Chimpanzees of Gombe''. Her findings revolutionised contemporary knowledge of chimpanzee behaviour, and were further evidence of the social similarities between humans and chimpanzees, albeit in a much darker manner.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nGoodall also set herself apart from the traditional conventions of the time by naming the animals in her studies of primates, instead of assigning each a number. Numbering was a nearly universal practice at the time, and thought to be important in the removal of one's self from the potential for emotional attachment to the subject being studied. Setting herself apart from other researchers also led her to develop a close bond with the chimpanzees and to become, to this day, the only human ever accepted into chimpanzee society.  She was the lowest ranking member of a troop for a period of 22 months.

[[Keenen Ivory Wayans]] created, wrote and starred in the program. The show was produced by Ivory Way Productions in association with [[20th Century Fox Television]] and was taped at stage 7 at the [[Metromedia Square|Fox Television Center]] on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]].\n\nThe title of the series was inspired by the [[NBC]] announcement of broadcasts being presented \"[[Logo_of_NBC#Introduction_of_the_Peacock_.281956.E2.80.931960.29|in living color]]\" during the 1960s, prior to mainstream [[color television]]. It also refers to the fact that most of the show's cast was [[Black people|black]], unlike other sketch comedy shows such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', whose casts are mostly [[White people|white]]. It was controversial due to the Wayans' decision to portray black humor from the [[ghetto]] in a time when mainstream American tastes regarding black comedy had been set by more upscale shows such as ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', causing an eventual feud for control between Fox executives and the Wayans.\n\nOther members of the [[Wayans family]]\u2014[[Damon Wayans|Damon]], [[Kim Wayans|Kim]], [[Shawn Wayans|Shawn]], and [[Marlon Wayans|Marlon]]\u2014had regular roles, while brother [[Dwayne Wayans|Dwayne]] frequently appeared as an extra. The show also starred several previously unknown comedians and actors, including [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Tommy Davidson]], [[David Alan Grier]], and [[T'Keyah Crystal Keym\u00e1h]]. The show introduced [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] as members of ''In Living Color''<nowiki/>'s dance troupe The Fly Girls, with actress [[Rosie Perez]] serving as choreographer. The show was immensely popular in its first two seasons, capturing more than a 10-point [[Nielsen rating]]; in the third and fourth seasons, ratings faltered as the Wayans brothers fell out with Fox network leadership over creative control and rights.\n\nThe series won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series]] in 1990. The series gained international prominence for its bold move and its all-time high ratings gained by airing a live, special episode as a [[Counterprogramming (television)|counterprogram]] for the halftime show of U.S. leader [[CBS]]'s live telecast of [[Super Bowl XXVI]], prompting the [[National Football League]] to book A-list acts for future game entertainment, starting with [[Michael Jackson]] the following year.<ref name=trib-goalofspectacle>{{cite news|title=Goal of spectacle colors NFL's thinking about Super Bowl halftime show|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-02-06/business/ct-biz-0206-rosenthal--20110206_1_super-halftime-party-doritos-zaptime-halftime-show|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=30 January 2013|date=6 February 2011}}</ref> In 2018, a history of the show, ''Homey Don't Play That!'' by David Peisner, was released by [[37 INK]], an imprint of [[Simon & Schuster]].\n\n== Description and history ==\n\n=== Early history ===\nFollowing Keenen Ivory Wayans' success with ''[[Hollywood Shuffle]]'' and ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka]]'', [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] approached Wayans to offer him his own show.<ref name= pokes>{{cite news |title= New Fox Show Pokes Fun at Black Stereotypes |publisher= Greensboro News & Record |location= Greensboro, North Carolina |work= Associated Press |page= B6 |date= April 12, 1990 |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=0EB191E9F73E3517&p_docnum=837&p_queryname=3 }}</ref> Wayans wanted to produce a variety show similar to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', but with a cast of people of color that took chances with its content.<ref name= ready>{{cite news |title= Is prime time ready for rudeness?

It became renowned for [[parody]], especially of race relations in the [[United States]]. For instance, Carrey was frequently used to ridicule white musicians such as [[Snow (musician)|Snow]] and [[Vanilla Ice]], who performed in genres more commonly associated with black people. The Wayans themselves often played exaggerated black ghetto stereotypes for humor and effect. A sketch parodying ''[[Soul Train]]'' mocked the show as ''Old Train'', suggesting the show (along with its host, [[Don Cornelius]]) was out of touch and only appealed to the elderly and the dead. When asked about the show's use of stereotypes of black culture for comedy, Wayans said, \"Half of comedy is making fun of stereotypes. They only get critical when I do it. [[Woody Allen]] has been having fun with his culture for years, and no one says anything about it. [[Martin Scorsese]], his films basically deal with the Italian community, and no one ever says anything to him. [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]], all of his films parody upscale white suburban life. Nobody says anything to him. When I do it, then all of a sudden it becomes a racial issue. You know what I mean? It's my culture, and I'm entitled to poke fun at the stereotypes that I didn't create in the first place. I don't even concern myself with that type of criticism, because it's racist in itself.\"<ref>{{cite news |title= Humor is in 'Living Color': Writers Plan to Capitalize on Funny Cultural Stereotypes |work= Daily News of Los Angeles |date= April 15, 1990 |first= Yardena |last= Arar |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=0EF5BB34E44340CF&p_docnum=863&p_queryname=3 |page= L25 }}</ref>\n\nProminent skits:\n*  \"The Homeboy Shopping Network\", featuring Damon and Keenan as streetwise criminals operating an unlicensed, [[Home Shopping Network]]-style shopping network out of the back of their van to sell stolen goods.\n*  \"Fire Marshal Bill\", featuring Carrey as an incompetent, dangerously inept [[fire marshal]].\n*  \"[[Men on...|Men on Film]]\", featuring Damon and Grier as [[effeminate]] black film critics with exaggerated physical motions, such as \"two snaps up\".\n*  \"Homey D.

However, after the band [[Living Colour]] claimed in a lawsuit that the show stole the band's logo and name,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-08/entertainment/ca-455_1_group-living-colour |title=Living Colour band sues Fox |work=Los Angeles Times |date=May 8, 1990 |accessdate=September 3, 2010}}</ref> the logo was changed to one with rather plain-type letters of three colors.  The show title itself is a homage to the [[Logo_of_NBC#Introduction_of_the_Peacock_.281956.E2.80.931960.29|NBC Peacock]] tag line, \"The following program is brought to you in living color\" from the 1960s when television was transitioning from black & white to color TV.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnvDVaiHXjM NBC Peacock clips] (posted to YouTube on Nov 4, 2011)</ref>\n\nIn the first two seasons, the opening sequence was set in a room covered with painters' tarps. Each cast member, wearing black-and-white, played with brightly colored paint in a different way (throwing paintballs at the camera by hand, [[spray painting]] the lens, using a roller to cover the camera lens, etc.). The sequence ended with a segue to a set built to resemble the rooftop of an apartment building, where the show's dancers performed a routine and opened a door to let Keenen Ivory Wayans greet a live audience.\n\nFor the third and fourth seasons, an animated sequence and different logo were used. Cast members were superimposed over pictures hanging in an art gallery and interacted with them in different ways (spinning the canvas to put it right-side up, swinging the frame out as if it were a door, etc.). The final image was of the logo on a black canvas, which shattered to begin the show. The fifth season retained the logo, but depicted the cast members on various signs and billboards around a city (either New York or Chicago), ending with the logo displayed on a theater marquee.\n\nThe [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] group [[Heavy D & the Boyz]] performed two different versions of the opening theme. One version was used for the first two seasons and remixed for the fifth, while the other was featured in the third and fourth seasons.\n\n=== Live musical performances ===\n''In Living Color'' was known for its live music performances, which started in Season 2 with [[Queen Latifah]] as their first performer (appearing again in the third season). Additional musical acts who appeared were [[Heavy D]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Kris Kross]], [[En Vogue]], [[Eazy-E]], [[Da Youngsta's]], [[Monie Love]], [[Onyx (hip hop group)|Onyx]], [[3rd Bass]], [[MC Lyte]], [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]], [[Jodeci]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Tupac Shakur]], [[Father MC]], [[Gang Starr]], [[The Pharcyde]], [[Simple E]], [[Us3]], [[Digable Planets]], [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]], [[Nice & Smooth]], [[Wreckx-n-Effect]], [[A.D.O.R.]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[Showbiz and A.G.]], [[Patra (singer)|Patra]], [[Naughty By Nature]], [[Lords of the Underground]], [[Prince Markie Dee]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], and [[Leaders of the New School]].\n\n=== The Fly Girls ===\nThe show employed an in-house dance troupe known as the \"Fly Girls\". The original lineup consisted of [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] (who became a choreographer and judge on ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''), Cari French, Deidre Lang, Lisa Marie Todd, Barbara Lumpkin and Michelle Whitney-Morrison. [[Rosie Perez]] was the choreographer for the first four seasons. The most notable former Fly Girl was future actress/singer [[Jennifer Lopez]], who joined the show in its third season.\n\nThroughout the show's run, the Fly Girls frequently performed a dance routine to lead into commercial breaks and/or during the closing credits. In the first two seasons, they also performed a routine that immediately followed the opening sequence. Music was provided by an in-house DJ - [[Shawn Wayans]] (credited as SW-1) in the first two seasons, then [[Leroy \"Twist\" Casey|DJ Twist]] from season 3 onward.\n\nThe Fly Girls would sometimes be used as extras in sketches, or as part of an opening gag. In one sketch, they were shown performing open-heart surgery (in the sketch, the girls are dancing in order to pay their way through medical school). Another routine featured the three original female cast members dancing off-beat during the introduction of the show, when it was revealed that the regular Fly Girls were all bound and gagged and breaking through the door where Keenan Ivory Wayans enters.\n\nThree of the Fly Girls also appeared in the eleventh episode of ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'''s second season in 1997.\n\n==Controversies==\nKeenen Ivory Wayans stopped appearing in sketches in 1992 after the end of the third season, over disputes with Fox about the network [[censorship|censoring]] the show's content and rerunning early episodes without his consultation. Wayans feared that Fox would ultimately decrease the [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] value of ''In Living Color''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Tim |author2=Marsh, Earle F.|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946\u2013Present |publisher=Ballantine Books|date=2007-10-17|edition=9|page=661|isbn=0-345-49773-2}}</ref> \n\nDamon went on to pursue a movie career around the same time, though he made occasional return appearances in the fourth season.

In the early years of ''In Living Color'', Rock was parodied as being the only African American cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (despite ''SNL'' also having [[Tim Meadows]] at the time). In an ''SNL'' episode honoring [[Mother's Day]], Rock's mother states that she is disappointed in him for not trying out for ''In Living Color'', to which Rock states he is happy with his job on ''SNL''.\n\nOther recurring guest stars in the fifth season include [[Nick Bakay]] (for ''The Dirty Dozens'' sketches) and [[Peter Marshall (game show host)|Peter Marshall]] (for several editions of ''East [[Hollywood Squares]]''). Rapper [[Biz Markie]] also appeared in various roles as a guest star in the fifth season, such as being in drag as Wanda the Ugly Woman's sister or as \"Dirty Dozens\" contestant Damian \"Foosball\" Franklin. [[Ed O'Neill]] made a cameo appearance as [[Al Bundy]] in a \"Dirty Dozens\" segment.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{Main|List of In Living Color episodes}}\n\n==Syndication==\nOriginally produced by [[20th Century Fox Television]] on Fox, the series was in reruns on local affiliates for a few years, but has since become a longstanding mainstay on Fox's sister cable networks [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] and [[FXX]]. In syndication, the series is distributed by Twentieth Television.\n\nReruns of the show also aired on BET from 2005\u20132008, and returned in 2010. Reruns have also aired on [[MTV2]], [[VH1]], [[nuvoTV]], and on BET-owned [[BET Her|Centric]].\n\nUnlike past runs on FX and the [[Viacom Media Networks]], the FXX cut of episodes are mostly uncut and censored. The music video parodies and spoken references to licensed songs have been reinstated, but the \"Bolt 45\" sketch, the \"drop the soap\" line, and the \"Men on Football\" sketch with the adlibbed lines about Richard Gere's and Carl Lewis's alleged homosexuality are still edited (though the facial ejaculation shot on \"Men on Fitness\" was reinstated), along with a line from the season five sketch \"Fire Marshall Bill at the Magic Show\" that makes reference to the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] (the missing line is, \"That's what they said about the World Trade Center, son. But me and my friend Abdul and a couple of pounds of plastique explosives showed them different.\" Bill's laugh and his catchphrase \"Lemme show ya somethin'\" was also cut abruptly), due to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]].\n\n''The Best of In Living Color'' aired on [[MyNetworkTV]] from April 16 to June 18, 2008. Hosted by David Alan Grier, it was a retrospective featuring classic sketches, along with cast interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. The show aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm Eastern/7:30 pm Central, after MyNetworkTV's sitcom ''[[Under One Roof (2008 TV series)|Under One Roof]]''.\n\nIn 2017, the show began airing reruns on [[Fusion TV|Fusion]] and Aspire.\n\n==Nielsen ratings==\n*1990\u201391: #58 (10.31 rating)\n*1991\u201392: #49 (10.37 rating)\n*1992\u201393: #62 (9.67 rating)\n*1993\u201394: #71 (7.98 rating)\nNote: Ratings data courtesy of TVTango.com\n\n== Crossovers ==\n*At the 2006 [[BET Awards]] when the show returned from one of its commercial breaks, the show's host Damon Wayans played a character very reminiscent to \"Men on ...\" critic Blaine Edwards.\n*''In Living Color'' alums Damon Wayans, Jim Carrey, and David Alan Grier reprised some of their ''In Living Color'' characters on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'':\n**Damon Wayans, a featured player during that show's [[Saturday Night Live (season 11)|eleventh season]], hosted an episode from ''SNL'''s 20th season in 1995, where he brought on two of his famous ''In Living Color'' characters: homeless wino Anton Jackson and gay film critic Blaine Edwards.\n**Jim Carrey auditioned to be one of the repertory members on ''SNL'' 's ill-fated [[Saturday Night Live (Season 6)|1980\u20131981 season]], but was dropped in favor of [[Charles Rocket]] (who later appeared in the [[1988 in film|1988]] film ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]'' and the [[1994 in film|1994]] film ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' with Carrey). Carrey also auditioned for the 1985\u20131986 season (season eleven), but backed out after seeing a man threatening to jump from 30 Rockefeller Center, believing that the stress of working on ''Saturday Night Live'' would drive Carrey to suicide. Carrey hosted the season finale of ''SNL'''s 21st season in 1996, where he impersonated [[Fire Marshal Bill]] during the monologue. Carrey's most recent hosting stint, in October 2014, involved a Carrey family reunion sketch in which [[Cecily Strong]] plays Carrey's aunt, who is modeled after Fire Marshal Bill.<ref>{{cite web |title= Did You Get Every Jim Carrey Reference In 'SNL's 'Family Reunion' Sketch? |first= Josh |last= Kurp |date= October 26, 2014 |work= Uproxx |url= http://uproxx.com/tv/2014/10/did-you-get-every-jim-carrey-reference-in-snls-family-reunion-sketch/ }}</ref>\n**David Alan Grier first hosted ''SNL'' during season 21 and reprised his ''In Living Color'' role as \"[[Men on...]]\" critic Antoine Merriweather, which the end of the sketch included a surprise on-set appearance from Damon Wayans as Blaine. Grier hosted ''SNL'' on December 9, 1995 (season 21) and March 18, 1997 (season 22).\n*Jamie Foxx reprised his role as Wanda in a short segment at the 2009 BET Awards.\n* In 1997, three of the Fly Girls also appeared in the eleventh episode of ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'''s second season.\n*In the 1997 film ''[[Liar Liar]]'', Jim Carrey reprised his \"Fire Marshal Bill\" character (albeit with no lines) in the background of one of the closing scenes.\n*The February 10, 2001 episode of ''Saturday Night Live'' hosted by Jennifer Lopez included a sketch where Lopez \"reunited\" with the Fly Girls (played by [[Rachel Dratch]], [[Jerry Minor]] and [[Tracy Morgan]]).\n\n==Home media==\n[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] has released all five seasons of ''In Living Color'' on DVD in Region 1. Due to music licensing issues, some sketches have been edited to remove any and all mention of licensed songs, from characters waxing lyrical to entire performances (including the music video parodies and some of the Fly Girl dancing [[Interstitial program|interstitials]]). Additionally, the \"Bolt 45\" sketch (which aired one-time only on May 5, 1990) was omitted, and the \"soap\" portion of the \"drop the soap\" line in the second \"Men on Film\" sketch has been muted.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!DVD Name\n!Ep #\n!Release Date\n|-\n| Season 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|13\n| April 6, 2004\n|-\n| Season 2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| September 28, 2004\n|-\n| Season 3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|28\n| May 10, 2005\n|-\n| Season 4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|33\n| October 25, 2005\n|-\n| Season 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| April 11, 2006\n|}\n\n==Attempted revival==\n[[Image:In Living Color 2012 Logo.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''In Living Color'' 2012 logo.|alt=In Living Color 2012 logo.]]\nIn 2011, there were plans to make a revival of the original series that featured a new cast, characters, and [[Sketch comedy|sketches]].<ref>{{cite web|work=Deadline.com|date=October 28, 2011|title=Fox to Reboot 'In Living Color' with Keenan Ivory Wayans|url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/10/fox-to-reboot-in-living-color-with-keenan-ivory-wayans|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fox44.com/news/hollywood-hookup/new-in-living-color-fly-girls|work=Fox44.com|date=February 29, 2012|title=New 'In Living Color' |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name=official>{{cite web|work=Fox.com|url=http://www.fox.com/programming/shows/?sh=in-living-color|title='In Living Color'|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref> The [[Television pilot|pilot episodes]] were hosted and executive produced by original series creator and cast member [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]].

[[Keenen Ivory Wayans]] created, wrote and starred in the program. The show was produced by Ivory Way Productions in association with [[20th Century Fox Television]] and was taped at stage 7 at the [[Metromedia Square|Fox Television Center]] on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]].\n\nThe title of the series was inspired by the [[NBC]] announcement of broadcasts being presented \"[[Logo_of_NBC#Introduction_of_the_Peacock_.281956.E2.80.931960.29|in living color]]\" during the 1960s, prior to mainstream [[color television]]. It also refers to the fact that most of the show's cast was [[Black people|black]], unlike other sketch comedy shows such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', whose casts are mostly [[White people|white]]. It was controversial due to the Wayans' decision to portray black humor from the [[ghetto]] in a time when mainstream American tastes regarding black comedy had been set by more upscale shows such as ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', causing an eventual feud for control between Fox executives and the Wayans.\n\nOther members of the [[Wayans family]]\u2014[[Damon Wayans|Damon]], [[Kim Wayans|Kim]], [[Shawn Wayans|Shawn]], and [[Marlon Wayans|Marlon]]\u2014had regular roles, while brother [[Dwayne Wayans|Dwayne]] frequently appeared as an extra. The show also starred several previously unknown comedians and actors, including [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Tommy Davidson]], [[David Alan Grier]], and [[T'Keyah Crystal Keym\u00e1h]]. The show introduced [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] as members of ''In Living Color''<nowiki/>'s dance troupe The Fly Girls, with actress [[Rosie Perez]] serving as choreographer. The show was immensely popular in its first two seasons, capturing more than a 10-point [[Nielsen rating]]; in the third and fourth seasons, ratings faltered as the Wayans brothers fell out with Fox network leadership over creative control and rights.\n\nThe series won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series]] in 1990. The series gained international prominence for its bold move and its all-time high ratings gained by airing a live, special episode as a [[Counterprogramming (television)|counterprogram]] for the halftime show of U.S. leader [[CBS]]'s live telecast of [[Super Bowl XXVI]], prompting the [[National Football League]] to book A-list acts for future game entertainment, starting with [[Michael Jackson]] the following year.<ref name=trib-goalofspectacle>{{cite news|title=Goal of spectacle colors NFL's thinking about Super Bowl halftime show|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-02-06/business/ct-biz-0206-rosenthal--20110206_1_super-halftime-party-doritos-zaptime-halftime-show|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=30 January 2013|date=6 February 2011}}</ref> In 2018, a history of the show, ''Homey Don't Play That!'' by David Peisner, was released by [[37 INK]], an imprint of [[Simon & Schuster]].\n\n== Description and history ==\n\n=== Early history ===\nFollowing Keenen Ivory Wayans' success with ''[[Hollywood Shuffle]]'' and ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka]]'', [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] approached Wayans to offer him his own show.<ref name= pokes>{{cite news |title= New Fox Show Pokes Fun at Black Stereotypes |publisher= Greensboro News & Record |location= Greensboro, North Carolina |work= Associated Press |page= B6 |date= April 12, 1990 |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=0EB191E9F73E3517&p_docnum=837&p_queryname=3 }}</ref> Wayans wanted to produce a variety show similar to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', but with a cast of people of color that took chances with its content.<ref name= ready>{{cite news |title= Is prime time ready for rudeness?

It became renowned for [[parody]], especially of race relations in the [[United States]]. For instance, Carrey was frequently used to ridicule white musicians such as [[Snow (musician)|Snow]] and [[Vanilla Ice]], who performed in genres more commonly associated with black people. The Wayans themselves often played exaggerated black ghetto stereotypes for humor and effect. A sketch parodying ''[[Soul Train]]'' mocked the show as ''Old Train'', suggesting the show (along with its host, [[Don Cornelius]]) was out of touch and only appealed to the elderly and the dead. When asked about the show's use of stereotypes of black culture for comedy, Wayans said, \"Half of comedy is making fun of stereotypes. They only get critical when I do it. [[Woody Allen]] has been having fun with his culture for years, and no one says anything about it. [[Martin Scorsese]], his films basically deal with the Italian community, and no one ever says anything to him. [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]], all of his films parody upscale white suburban life. Nobody says anything to him. When I do it, then all of a sudden it becomes a racial issue. You know what I mean? It's my culture, and I'm entitled to poke fun at the stereotypes that I didn't create in the first place.

However, after the band [[Living Colour]] claimed in a lawsuit that the show stole the band's logo and name,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-08/entertainment/ca-455_1_group-living-colour |title=Living Colour band sues Fox |work=Los Angeles Times |date=May 8, 1990 |accessdate=September 3, 2010}}</ref> the logo was changed to one with rather plain-type letters of three colors.  The show title itself is a homage to the [[Logo_of_NBC#Introduction_of_the_Peacock_.281956.E2.80.931960.29|NBC Peacock]] tag line, \"The following program is brought to you in living color\" from the 1960s when television was transitioning from black & white to color TV.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnvDVaiHXjM NBC Peacock clips] (posted to YouTube on Nov 4, 2011)</ref>\n\nIn the first two seasons, the opening sequence was set in a room covered with painters' tarps. Each cast member, wearing black-and-white, played with brightly colored paint in a different way (throwing paintballs at the camera by hand, [[spray painting]] the lens, using a roller to cover the camera lens, etc.). The sequence ended with a segue to a set built to resemble the rooftop of an apartment building, where the show's dancers performed a routine and opened a door to let Keenen Ivory Wayans greet a live audience.\n\nFor the third and fourth seasons, an animated sequence and different logo were used. Cast members were superimposed over pictures hanging in an art gallery and interacted with them in different ways (spinning the canvas to put it right-side up, swinging the frame out as if it were a door, etc.). The final image was of the logo on a black canvas, which shattered to begin the show. The fifth season retained the logo, but depicted the cast members on various signs and billboards around a city (either New York or Chicago), ending with the logo displayed on a theater marquee.\n\nThe [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] group [[Heavy D & the Boyz]] performed two different versions of the opening theme. One version was used for the first two seasons and remixed for the fifth, while the other was featured in the third and fourth seasons.\n\n=== Live musical performances ===\n''In Living Color'' was known for its live music performances, which started in Season 2 with [[Queen Latifah]] as their first performer (appearing again in the third season). Additional musical acts who appeared were [[Heavy D]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Kris Kross]], [[En Vogue]], [[Eazy-E]], [[Da Youngsta's]], [[Monie Love]], [[Onyx (hip hop group)|Onyx]], [[3rd Bass]], [[MC Lyte]], [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]], [[Jodeci]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Tupac Shakur]], [[Father MC]], [[Gang Starr]], [[The Pharcyde]], [[Simple E]], [[Us3]], [[Digable Planets]], [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]], [[Nice & Smooth]], [[Wreckx-n-Effect]], [[A.D.O.R.]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[Showbiz and A.G.]], [[Patra (singer)|Patra]], [[Naughty By Nature]], [[Lords of the Underground]], [[Prince Markie Dee]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], and [[Leaders of the New School]].\n\n=== The Fly Girls ===\nThe show employed an in-house dance troupe known as the \"Fly Girls\". The original lineup consisted of [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] (who became a choreographer and judge on ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''), Cari French, Deidre Lang, Lisa Marie Todd, Barbara Lumpkin and Michelle Whitney-Morrison. [[Rosie Perez]] was the choreographer for the first four seasons. The most notable former Fly Girl was future actress/singer [[Jennifer Lopez]], who joined the show in its third season.\n\nThroughout the show's run, the Fly Girls frequently performed a dance routine to lead into commercial breaks and/or during the closing credits. In the first two seasons, they also performed a routine that immediately followed the opening sequence. Music was provided by an in-house DJ - [[Shawn Wayans]] (credited as SW-1) in the first two seasons, then [[Leroy \"Twist\" Casey|DJ Twist]] from season 3 onward.\n\nThe Fly Girls would sometimes be used as extras in sketches, or as part of an opening gag. In one sketch, they were shown performing open-heart surgery (in the sketch, the girls are dancing in order to pay their way through medical school). Another routine featured the three original female cast members dancing off-beat during the introduction of the show, when it was revealed that the regular Fly Girls were all bound and gagged and breaking through the door where Keenan Ivory Wayans enters.\n\nThree of the Fly Girls also appeared in the eleventh episode of ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'''s second season in 1997.\n\n==Controversies==\nKeenen Ivory Wayans stopped appearing in sketches in 1992 after the end of the third season, over disputes with Fox about the network [[censorship|censoring]] the show's content and rerunning early episodes without his consultation. Wayans feared that Fox would ultimately decrease the [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] value of ''In Living Color''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Tim |author2=Marsh, Earle F.|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946\u2013Present |publisher=Ballantine Books|date=2007-10-17|edition=9|page=661|isbn=0-345-49773-2}}</ref> \n\nDamon went on to pursue a movie career around the same time, though he made occasional return appearances in the fourth season.

In the early years of ''In Living Color'', Rock was parodied as being the only African American cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (despite ''SNL'' also having [[Tim Meadows]] at the time). In an ''SNL'' episode honoring [[Mother's Day]], Rock's mother states that she is disappointed in him for not trying out for ''In Living Color'', to which Rock states he is happy with his job on ''SNL''.\n\nOther recurring guest stars in the fifth season include [[Nick Bakay]] (for ''The Dirty Dozens'' sketches) and [[Peter Marshall (game show host)|Peter Marshall]] (for several editions of ''East [[Hollywood Squares]]''). Rapper [[Biz Markie]] also appeared in various roles as a guest star in the fifth season, such as being in drag as Wanda the Ugly Woman's sister or as \"Dirty Dozens\" contestant Damian \"Foosball\" Franklin. [[Ed O'Neill]] made a cameo appearance as [[Al Bundy]] in a \"Dirty Dozens\" segment.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{Main|List of In Living Color episodes}}\n\n==Syndication==\nOriginally produced by [[20th Century Fox Television]] on Fox, the series was in reruns on local affiliates for a few years, but has since become a longstanding mainstay on Fox's sister cable networks [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] and [[FXX]]. In syndication, the series is distributed by Twentieth Television.\n\nReruns of the show also aired on BET from 2005\u20132008, and returned in 2010. Reruns have also aired on [[MTV2]], [[VH1]], [[nuvoTV]], and on BET-owned [[BET Her|Centric]].\n\nUnlike past runs on FX and the [[Viacom Media Networks]], the FXX cut of episodes are mostly uncut and censored. The music video parodies and spoken references to licensed songs have been reinstated, but the \"Bolt 45\" sketch, the \"drop the soap\" line, and the \"Men on Football\" sketch with the adlibbed lines about Richard Gere's and Carl Lewis's alleged homosexuality are still edited (though the facial ejaculation shot on \"Men on Fitness\" was reinstated), along with a line from the season five sketch \"Fire Marshall Bill at the Magic Show\" that makes reference to the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] (the missing line is, \"That's what they said about the World Trade Center, son. But me and my friend Abdul and a couple of pounds of plastique explosives showed them different.\" Bill's laugh and his catchphrase \"Lemme show ya somethin'\" was also cut abruptly), due to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]].\n\n''The Best of In Living Color'' aired on [[MyNetworkTV]] from April 16 to June 18, 2008. Hosted by David Alan Grier, it was a retrospective featuring classic sketches, along with cast interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. The show aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm Eastern/7:30 pm Central, after MyNetworkTV's sitcom ''[[Under One Roof (2008 TV series)|Under One Roof]]''.\n\nIn 2017, the show began airing reruns on [[Fusion TV|Fusion]] and Aspire.\n\n==Nielsen ratings==\n*1990\u201391: #58 (10.31 rating)\n*1991\u201392: #49 (10.37 rating)\n*1992\u201393: #62 (9.67 rating)\n*1993\u201394: #71 (7.98 rating)\nNote: Ratings data courtesy of TVTango.com\n\n== Crossovers ==\n*At the 2006 [[BET Awards]] when the show returned from one of its commercial breaks, the show's host Damon Wayans played a character very reminiscent to \"Men on ...\" critic Blaine Edwards.\n*''In Living Color'' alums Damon Wayans, Jim Carrey, and David Alan Grier reprised some of their ''In Living Color'' characters on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'':\n**Damon Wayans, a featured player during that show's [[Saturday Night Live (season 11)|eleventh season]], hosted an episode from ''SNL'''s 20th season in 1995, where he brought on two of his famous ''In Living Color'' characters: homeless wino Anton Jackson and gay film critic Blaine Edwards.\n**Jim Carrey auditioned to be one of the repertory members on ''SNL'' 's ill-fated [[Saturday Night Live (Season 6)|1980\u20131981 season]], but was dropped in favor of [[Charles Rocket]] (who later appeared in the [[1988 in film|1988]] film ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]'' and the [[1994 in film|1994]] film ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' with Carrey). Carrey also auditioned for the 1985\u20131986 season (season eleven), but backed out after seeing a man threatening to jump from 30 Rockefeller Center, believing that the stress of working on ''Saturday Night Live'' would drive Carrey to suicide. Carrey hosted the season finale of ''SNL'''s 21st season in 1996, where he impersonated [[Fire Marshal Bill]] during the monologue. Carrey's most recent hosting stint, in October 2014, involved a Carrey family reunion sketch in which [[Cecily Strong]] plays Carrey's aunt, who is modeled after Fire Marshal Bill.<ref>{{cite web |title= Did You Get Every Jim Carrey Reference In 'SNL's 'Family Reunion' Sketch? |first= Josh |last= Kurp |date= October 26, 2014 |work= Uproxx |url= http://uproxx.com/tv/2014/10/did-you-get-every-jim-carrey-reference-in-snls-family-reunion-sketch/ }}</ref>\n**David Alan Grier first hosted ''SNL'' during season 21 and reprised his ''In Living Color'' role as \"[[Men on...]]\" critic Antoine Merriweather, which the end of the sketch included a surprise on-set appearance from Damon Wayans as Blaine. Grier hosted ''SNL'' on December 9, 1995 (season 21) and March 18, 1997 (season 22).\n*Jamie Foxx reprised his role as Wanda in a short segment at the 2009 BET Awards.\n* In 1997, three of the Fly Girls also appeared in the eleventh episode of ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'''s second season.\n*In the 1997 film ''[[Liar Liar]]'', Jim Carrey reprised his \"Fire Marshal Bill\" character (albeit with no lines) in the background of one of the closing scenes.\n*The February 10, 2001 episode of ''Saturday Night Live'' hosted by Jennifer Lopez included a sketch where Lopez \"reunited\" with the Fly Girls (played by [[Rachel Dratch]], [[Jerry Minor]] and [[Tracy Morgan]]).\n\n==Home media==\n[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] has released all five seasons of ''In Living Color'' on DVD in Region 1. Due to music licensing issues, some sketches have been edited to remove any and all mention of licensed songs, from characters waxing lyrical to entire performances (including the music video parodies and some of the Fly Girl dancing [[Interstitial program|interstitials]]). Additionally, the \"Bolt 45\" sketch (which aired one-time only on May 5, 1990) was omitted, and the \"soap\" portion of the \"drop the soap\" line in the second \"Men on Film\" sketch has been muted.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!DVD Name\n!Ep #\n!Release Date\n|-\n| Season 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|13\n| April 6, 2004\n|-\n| Season 2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| September 28, 2004\n|-\n| Season 3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|28\n| May 10, 2005\n|-\n| Season 4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|33\n| October 25, 2005\n|-\n| Season 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| April 11, 2006\n|}\n\n==Attempted revival==\n[[Image:In Living Color 2012 Logo.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''In Living Color'' 2012 logo.|alt=In Living Color 2012 logo.]]\nIn 2011, there were plans to make a revival of the original series that featured a new cast, characters, and [[Sketch comedy|sketches]].<ref>{{cite web|work=Deadline.com|date=October 28, 2011|title=Fox to Reboot 'In Living Color' with Keenan Ivory Wayans|url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/10/fox-to-reboot-in-living-color-with-keenan-ivory-wayans|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fox44.com/news/hollywood-hookup/new-in-living-color-fly-girls|work=Fox44.com|date=February 29, 2012|title=New 'In Living Color' |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name=official>{{cite web|work=Fox.com|url=http://www.fox.com/programming/shows/?sh=in-living-color|title='In Living Color'|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref> The [[Television pilot|pilot episodes]] were hosted and executive produced by original series creator and cast member [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]].
