In 2003, guitarist Rory Clewlow joined the band to complete its current lineup, and it adopted its current name. In 2006, they performed to a growing fanbase at [[Download Festival]] as well as a sold-out concert at the [[London Astoria]]. Their debut studio album, ''[[Take to the Skies]]'', was released in 2007 and reached number 4 in the [[UK Albums Chart|Official UK Album Chart]], and has since been certified gold in the UK. Their second, ''[[Common Dreads]]'', was released in 2009 and debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number 16;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/albums.shtml |title=Radio 1 \u2013 The Official Chart with Reggie Yates \u2013 The Official UK Top 40 Albums Chart |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref> while their third, ''[[A Flash Flood of Colour]]'', was released in 2012 and debuted on the chart at number 4. Both have since been certified silver in the UK. The band spent a considerable amount of time supporting the latter release through the [[A Flash Flood of Colour World Tour]], before beginning work on a fourth studio album, ''[[The Mindsweep]]'', which was released in 2015. Their fifth studio album ''[[The Spark (album)|The Spark]]'' was released in 2017. Their sixth album ''[[Nothing Is True & Everything Is Possible]]'' was released in April 2020.\n\nEnter Shikari have their own record label, Ambush Reality. However, they have also signed distribution deals with several major labels to help with worldwide distribution. Their eclectic musical style combines influences from rock music genres with those from various [[electronic music]] genres.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Beginnings (1999\u20132006) ===\n\nIn 1999 a band named Hybryd formed, consisting of Rou Reynolds on guitar and vocals, Chris Batten on bass guitar, and Rob Rolfe on drums. They released an EP called ''[[Commit No Nuisance]]'', which featured the tracks \"Perfect Pygmalion\", \"Look Inside\", \"Torch Song\", \"Honesty Box\" and \"Fake\". In 2003, with the addition of guitarist Rory Clewlow, Hybryd became Enter Shikari. The band was named after ''Shikari'', a boat belonging to vocalist Rou Reynolds' uncle. \"Shikari is a [[Hindi]] word for hunter.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Access All Areas.net.au |url=http://www.accessallareas.net.au/artists/Enter_Shikari.php |title=Enter Shikari &#124; Artist Interviews |publisher=Access All Areas |accessdate=12 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304025238/http://www.accessallareas.net.au/artists/Enter_Shikari.php |archivedate=4 March 2011 }}</ref> After the band's lineup and name change, Reynolds focused his musical efforts on vocals and electronics instead of guitar.<ref>{{cite web|title=Enter Shikari: Unplugged & Personal|url=https://headlinermagazine.net/headliners/enter-shikari-unplugged-and-personal.html|website=Headliner Magazine|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring 2003 and 2004, the band released three demo EPs (''[[Nodding Acquaintance]]'', ''[[Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour EP|Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour]]'' and ''[[Sorry You're Not a Winner EP|Sorry You're Not a Winner]]'') that were available from their gigs and their website, featuring original versions of some songs that were eventually rerecorded for their debut album, ''[[Take to the Skies]]''. They had another demo EP planned for release in 2005 (no such EP materialized, although recordings surfaced online). For this the first versions of \"Return To Energiser\" and \"Labyrinth\" were recorded. Early versions of \"OK Time for Plan B\" and \"We Can Breathe in Space\" were also recorded around this time but it's unclear if these were destined for the EP. It was at this time that Kerrang! Radio's Alex Baker picked up on the band, and as he didn't have a physical release to play, he streamed \"OK Time For Plan B\" off the band's Myspace page, straight onto the airwaves.\n\nIn August 2006 they released a video of the single \"[[Mothership (song)|Mothership]]\" which became the single of the week on the [[iTunes Store]]. Their 1st physical single featured re-recorded versions of \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\", which had previously been featured on one of the demo EPs. It was released on 30 October 2006. It was limited to 1000 copies of each format and sold out within the first week of release. In mid January 2007, Enter Shikari's first single, \"[[Mothership (song)|Mothership]]\", entered the UK singles chart for one week at number 151, on Downloads only (despite its physical formats not being eligible for charts [at the band's request]). This was followed a week later by \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\", which charted at number 182 on the singles chart (despite its physical formats being ineligible for charts [at the band's request]) and number 146 in the Download Chart. In addition \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\" featured on the [[EA Sports]] video game titles [[NHL 08]] and [[Madden 08]]. Enter Shikari secured a spot on the Gibson/Myspace stage at 2006's [[Download Festival#Download 2006|Download Festival]].\n\nThey also had interviews with popular music press such as ''[[Kerrang!]]'' and ''[[Rock Sound]]''. On 4 November 2006, they became only the second unsigned band to ever sell out [[London Astoria]] (the first being [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]]).\n\nThey also made the ''[[NME]]'''s \"New Noise 2007\", a list of the bands it considers most likely to achieve success in the coming year (previous years lists have included the likes of [[Arcade Fire]], [[Hot Chip]] and [[Bloc Party]]).\n\nThe next single released was \"[[Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour]]\", on 5 March 2007. This was the band's second single to be released from their forthcoming debut album. It contained a re-recorded version of the song \"Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour\". It reached 27 in the Official UK chart.\n\nThe band released a compilation album titled ''[[The Zone (Enter Shikari)|The Zone]]'' just before the debut album, this contained various demo tracks and previously released singles.\n\n=== ''Take to the Skies'' (2007\u201308) ===\n{{main|Take to the Skies}}\n\nThe band's debut album, ''[[Take to the Skies]]'', was released on 19 March 2007 and on 25 March it reached number 4 in the UK Official Album Charts.

So much happened over those two years [since the release of their previous album], globally and in my personal life, so before. I was kind of comfortable.

They had another demo EP planned for release in 2005 (no such EP materialized, although recordings surfaced online). For this the first versions of \"Return To Energiser\" and \"Labyrinth\" were recorded. Early versions of \"OK Time for Plan B\" and \"We Can Breathe in Space\" were also recorded around this time but it's unclear if these were destined for the EP. It was at this time that Kerrang! Radio's Alex Baker picked up on the band, and as he didn't have a physical release to play, he streamed \"OK Time For Plan B\" off the band's Myspace page, straight onto the airwaves.\n\nIn August 2006 they released a video of the single \"[[Mothership (song)|Mothership]]\" which became the single of the week on the [[iTunes Store]]. Their 1st physical single featured re-recorded versions of \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\", which had previously been featured on one of the demo EPs. It was released on 30 October 2006. It was limited to 1000 copies of each format and sold out within the first week of release. In mid January 2007, Enter Shikari's first single, \"[[Mothership (song)|Mothership]]\", entered the UK singles chart for one week at number 151, on Downloads only (despite its physical formats not being eligible for charts [at the band's request]). This was followed a week later by \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\", which charted at number 182 on the singles chart (despite its physical formats being ineligible for charts [at the band's request]) and number 146 in the Download Chart. In addition \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\" featured on the [[EA Sports]] video game titles [[NHL 08]] and [[Madden 08]]. Enter Shikari secured a spot on the Gibson/Myspace stage at 2006's [[Download Festival#Download 2006|Download Festival]].\n\nThey also had interviews with popular music press such as ''[[Kerrang!]]'' and ''[[Rock Sound]]''.

This was the band's second single to be released from their forthcoming debut album. It contained a re-recorded version of the song \"Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour\". It reached 27 in the Official UK chart.\n\nThe band released a compilation album titled ''[[The Zone (Enter Shikari)|The Zone]]'' just before the debut album, this contained various demo tracks and previously released singles.\n\n=== ''Take to the Skies'' (2007\u201308) ===\n{{main|Take to the Skies}}\n\nThe band's debut album, ''[[Take to the Skies]]'', was released on 19 March 2007 and on 25 March it reached number 4 in the UK Official Album Charts.

So much happened over those two years [since the release of their previous album], globally and in my personal life, so before. I was kind of comfortable. I have a very finely attuned cringe muscle, I don\u2019t like writing about things that have been written about a thousand times.

It is the highest peak of the [[Massif des \u00c9crins]] and the [[Dauphin\u00e9 Alps]] and the most southerly alpine peak in Europe that is higher than 4,000 m. It is the only 4,000 m mountain in France that lies outside the [[Mont Blanc Massif]]. Before the annexation of [[Savoy]] in 1860 it was the highest mountain in France.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Barre des \u00c9crins - South face.jpg|thumb|left|The south face of Barre des \u00c9crins]]\n\n===Location===\nThe Barre des \u00c9crins is the highest peak in the [[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]] region including all of [[Occitania]] and the Southern Alps. It is located in the commune of [[Pelvoux]] and is situated near the [[Drainage divide]] between the [[Durance]] and the ''V\u00e9n\u00e9on''. This divide passes 250 metres west of the summit, along the [[ridge]] that leads to the summit of the sub-peak ''D\u00f4me des \u00c9crins'' (4088 metres). The south face of the mountain is rocky while the north face is ice as it is the starting point of the [[Glacier Blanc]].\n\nThe mountain is surrounded by four glaciers: to the north-west is the ''Bonne Pierre glacier'', to the north-east the ''Glacier Blanc'', to the south-west the ''Glacier du Vallon de la Pilatte'', and finally in the south-east the [[Glacier Noir]]. It is separated from the ''Snow Dome of \u00c9crins'' (4015 m) by the ''Lory Gap'' (3974 m) to the west, the ''Barre Noir'' (3751 m) by the ''\u00c9crins Gap'' (3661 m) to the north-east and by ''Fifre'' (3699 m) via the ''Col des Avalanches'' (3499 m) to the south.\n\n===Geology===\nThe mountain consists of [[Migmatite|migmatized]] [[gneiss]], an acidic rock composed of [[quartz]]-[[feldspar]]. On the upper slopes there is an [[Amphibole|amphibolic]] face over the top of the migmatized gneiss forming the top. These formations overlap a large [[granite]] [[Pluton]] that forms the summit of Pelvoux.<ref>Geological Map of France at 1:50000 consulted on InfoTerre (Saint-Christophe-en-Oisans page). {{in lang|fr}}</ref><ref>J.-C.

W Moore]], [[Horace Walker]], and [[Edward Whymper]], guided by [[Michel Croz]] from [[Chamonix]] and [[Christian Almer]] from [[Switzerland]], made the first ascent of the Barre des \u00c9crins on 25 June 1864. They cut steps on the north face of the Barre until they reached the top of the eastern edge via the ''Whymper corridor''. They then reached the top of this high ridge which was composed of very unstable rocks.

It starts from the Refuge des \u00c9crins and climbs the north face almost up to the Lory saddle (3,974&nbsp;m), where the routes to the D\u00f4me and the Barre divide. The ascent of the Barre continues by a rocky [[Arete (landform)|ar\u00eate]] all the way to the summit.

The quality of the rock on the mountain ranges from poor to average and especially on the South Face of the mountain the risk of [[rockfall]] is significant.\n\nIt is possible to climb the ''Direct Coolidge'' in late spring directly to the summit with crampons and an ice axe. Depending on snow conditions, this route can also be done on skis.\n\nThe south-north traverse of the Barre des \u00c9crins bar is also one of the classic routes of the massif.\n\nIn summer it is possible to climb a steep path on the south face with the ''Pilier Sud'' being the most traveled route.\n\nThe record for an ascent on foot is 1 hour 55 minutes by Math\u00e9o Jacquemoud in June 2012, starting from Pr\u00e9 de Madame Carle (1874 m) by the normal route of the D\u00f4me and the Whymper corridor.

It is the highest peak of the [[Massif des \u00c9crins]] and the [[Dauphin\u00e9 Alps]] and the most southerly alpine peak in Europe that is higher than 4,000 m. It is the only 4,000 m mountain in France that lies outside the [[Mont Blanc Massif]].

Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h calls it one of two \"Most Great Festivals\" and describes the first day as \"the Day of supreme felicity\" and he then describes the Garden of Ridvan as \"the Spot from which He shed upon the whole of creation the splendours of his Name, the All-Merciful\".<ref name =\"aqdas_notes\" /><ref name=\"aqdas\">{{cite book |author = Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h |authorlink = Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h |origyear = 1873 |year = 1992 |title = The Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas: The Most Holy Book |publisher = Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-85398-999-0 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-6.html.iso8859-1#gr110 | page = 59}}</ref>\n\nThe festival is significant because of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's private declaration to a few followers that he was \"Him Whom God shall make manifest\" and a [[Manifestation of God]], and thus it forms the beginning point of the [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith]], as distinct from the Babi religion.  It is also significant because Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h left his [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed pilgrimage#House of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, Baghdad|house in Baghdad]], which he designated the \"Most Great House\", to enter the Garden of Ridv\u00e1n. Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h compares this move from the Most Great House to the Garden of Ridv\u00e1n to [[Muhammad]]'s [[Hijra (Islam)|travel from]] [[Mecca]] to [[Medina]].\n\nFurthermore, during Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's first day in the garden, he made three further announcements: (1) abrogating [[religious war]], which was permitted under certain conditions in [[Islam]] and the B\u00e1b\u00ed faith; (2) that there would not be [[Bah\u00e1{{hamza}}\u00ed prophecies#The next Manifestation of God|another Manifestation of God]] for another 1,000 years; and (3) that all the [[Names of God#Bah\u00e1{{hamza}}\u00ed Faith|names of God]] were fully manifest in all things.<ref name=\"walbridge\" /> These statements appear in a text written some years after 1863, which has been included in the compilation ''[[Days of Remembrance]]'' (section 9).
