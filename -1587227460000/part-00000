Rajendra Babu]]. This film stars [[V. Ravichandran|Ravichandran]], [[Madhoo]], [[Aruna Irani]], [[Srinath]], [[Dheerendra Gopal]], Kashi and Ashalatha, amongst others. The music was composed by Naada Brahma [[Hamsalekha]]. The film was produced by M. Chandrashekar.\n\nThe movie is a remake of the 1987 Tamil movie ''[[Enga Chinna Rasa]]'', whose story was inspired by the Kannada novel ''Mallammana Pavada'', by [[B. Puttaswamayya]], which incidentally went on to be adapted into a 1969 Kannada movie ''[[Mallammana Pavaada]]''. The screenplay of the Kannada movie was written by Telugu director [[P. Pullaiah]], based on his 1955 Telugu movie with a similar story, titled ''[[Ardhangi]]'', which itself was based on Maddipatla Suri's Telugu translation of the Bengali novel ''Swayamsidda'', written by Manilal Banerjee. ''Swayamsiddha'' went on to be made into a 1975 Bengali movie of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/ardhangi-1955/article6086551.ece|title=Ardhangi (1955)|first=M. l|last=Narasimham|date=6 June 2014|publisher=|via=www.thehindu.com}}</ref>  ''[[Ardhangi]]'' was remade in Tamil as ''[[Pennin Perumai]]'', in Hindi twice as ''[[Bahurani (1963 film)|Bahurani]]'' in 1963 and as ''[[Jyoti (1981 film)|Jyoti]]'' in 1981. ''[[Enga Chinna Rasa]]'' also went on to be remade in  [[Hindi]] as ''[[Beta (film)|Beta]]'', in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''[[Abbaigaru]]'' and in [[Odia language|Odia]] as ''Santana'' (1998).<ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/kannada/movies/photo-features/top-ten-kannada-films-to-have-been-remade/photostory/27974911.cms</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAnnayya is a story of a person named \"Annayya\" ([[V. Ravichandran|Ravichandran]]), who is the only child of a rich Landlord ([[Srinath]]) and had lost his mother at the time of his birth. Annayya's father can provide him anything he wants, but Annayys's only desire is to get a mother's love. In order to fulfill his son's desire, Sreenath marries Nagamani ([[Aruna Irani]]), thinking that she could take care of him more than his real mother would. As the day passes, Nagamani's brother [[Dheerendra Gopal]] enters into Annayya's house by convincing Sreenath that he has lost all his properties due to some loss. Then Dheerendra Gopal asks her sister Nagamani to get the property of Annayya's to be  transferred into her name so as to think of her child, which is about to enter into the outside world. Then Nagamani makes Annayya to follow each and every step that her mother says and not to take even a single decision without her permission. He even stops going to school and becomes a slave to his mother.\n\nAs the time passes, Annayya grows up and marries Saraswati ([[Madhoo]]). Saraswati discovers that Nagamani's motherly love is fake and all that Nagamani wants is to capture Annayya's wealth. Then the battle begins within the household between daughter-in-law and mother-in-law which involves Saraswati trying to outdo Nagamani. This involves Saraswati voicing her concerns to Annayya about his mother, resulting in Saraswati being slapped once by her husband, and alienating him. This humiliation does not worry Saraswati, who eventually wins the battle once Nagamani realizes the importance of loving her stepson back as much as he loves her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[V.
