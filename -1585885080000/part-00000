In [[Madrid]] he did some translations of [[Jos\u00e9 Maria de E\u00e7a de Queir\u00f3s]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], [[Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly]], [[Paul Alexis]] and [[Matilde Serao]]. In spite of his economic difficulties, he started to have a name in the ''tertulias'' (literary gatherings) of many culturally significant coffeehouses in [[Madrid]], such as [[Caf\u00e9 Gij\u00f3n]], and to be noticed for his dandy attitude and his eccentric looks. \nHis hot temper got him involved in various affrays. Because one of those, at Caf\u00e9 de la Monta\u00f1a in 1899, an unfortunate stick wound by writer Manuel Bueno caused one of his cufflinks to inlay in his arm. The wound produced gangrene, and Valle-Incl\u00e1n had his arm amputated. That same year of 1899, he met [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]], and both of them became good friends. At that time, he published his first theater play, ''Cenizas (Ashes)'', and he started a very prolific literary period.\n\nIn 1907 he married the actress Josefina Blanco Tejerina.\n\nIn 1910 he traveled for six months to various Latin American countries ([[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Bolivia]]) escorting his wife on an acting tour.\n\nIn 1913 he returned to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and set his residence in Cambados. Then, after the death of his second son, he moved to La Puebla del Carabi\u00f1al.\n\nIn 1916 he published in the Cuban magazine Labor Gallega a poem in [[Galician language]] with the title of ''Cantiga de vellas (Son of old women)'', which is his most valuable contribution to Galician literature.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], he supported the allied army, visiting the front in various occasions as a war correspondent for ''El Imparcial''.\n\nIn 1921 he traveled to [[M\u00e9xico]] again, invited by the President of the Republic, [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]]. There he participated in many literary and cultural events, and got conquered by the [[Mexican Revolution]]. On his way back to [[Spain]], he spent two weeks in [[Havana]], and two weeks in [[New York City]]. That same year, 1921, he was appointed President of the International Federation of Latin American Intellectuals.\n\nHe returned to [[Spain]] at the end of 1921, and there he started to write ''Tirano Banderas (Tyrant Banderas)''. He went back to [[Madrid]] in 1922, still inflamed by the spirit of the [[Mexican Revolution]].\n\nSince 1924 he showed his opposition to [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]\u2019s dictatorship.\n\nWith the arrival of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], he run in the elections with the Partido Radical of [[Alejandro Lerroux]], but he did not get a seat.\n\nIn 1932 he divorced his wife, and he was appointed Director of the Museum of [[Aranjuez]] <ref>[http://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE/1932/029/A00732-00732.pdf MINISTERIO DE INSTRUCCI\u00d3N P\u00daBLICA Y BELLAS ARTES. \u00abDecreto, de 27 de enero de 1932, encargando al Conservador general del Tesoro Art\u00edstico Nacional la organizaci\u00f3n, como Museo, del que fue Real Sitio de Aranjuez\u00bb.

He despised literary realism and openly disregarded [[Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s]], its most prominent Spanish representative.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Stephen |last=Gilman |title=La palabra hablada y \"Fortunata y Jacinta\" |journal=Nueva Revista de Filolog\u00eda Hisp\u00e1nica |year=1961 |volume=15 |issue=3/4 |pages=542\u2013560 |doi=10.24201/nrfh.v15i3/4.391 |jstor=40297550 }}</ref> His political views, accordingly, changed from traditional absolutism (in Spain known as [[Carlismo]]) towards [[anarchism]]. This also caused him problems.\n\nAll his life he struggled to live up to his bohemian ideals, and stayed loyal to his [[Aestheticism|aestheticist]] beliefs. However, he had to write undercover for serialised popular novels. During a row with a fellow writer his wrist was wounded and became infected, and he lost his arm.\n\nValle-Incl\u00e1n's work, for example, ''Divine Words'' (''[[Divinas palabras (play)|Divinas palabras]]'') and ''[[Bohemian Lights]] (Luces de Bohemia)'' attacks what he saw as the [[hypocrisy]], [[moralism|moralising]] and [[sentimentality]] of the [[bourgeois]] playwrights, [[satire|satirises]] the views of the ruling classes and targets in particular concepts such as [[masculinity|masculine honour]], [[militarism]], [[patriotism]] and attitudes to the Crown and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. His drama also featured irreverent portrayal of figures from Spain's political past and deployed crude, obscene language and vulgar imagery in a mocking attack on theatrical blandness.\n\nIn addition to being politically subversive, though, Valle-Incl\u00e1n's plays often required staging and direction that went far beyond the abilities of many companies working in the commercial theatre, often featuring complex supernatural [[special effects]] and rapid, drastic changes of scene. For this reason, some of his works are regarded as [[closet drama]]s.\n\nValle-Incl\u00e1n also wrote major novels including the ''Tyrant Banderas'' (''[[Tirano Banderas]]''), which was influential on the Latin American [[Dictator novel|'dictator' novel]] (for example, ''[[I, the Supreme]]'' by [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]), although it was received with disdain by many Spanish American authors, [[Rufino Blanco Fombona]] for example, pokes fun of \"the America of tambourine\" (\"la Am\u00e9rica de pandereta\") of that novel where you could be in the jungle one day and the Andes the next. Some critics view him as being the Spanish equivalent to [[James Joyce]]; however, due to a lack of translations his work is still largely unknown in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world, although his reputation is slowly growing as translations are produced.\n\n===Plays===\n*''Cenizas.

In [[Madrid]] he did some translations of [[Jos\u00e9 Maria de E\u00e7a de Queir\u00f3s]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], [[Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly]], [[Paul Alexis]] and [[Matilde Serao]]. In spite of his economic difficulties, he started to have a name in the ''tertulias'' (literary gatherings) of many culturally significant coffeehouses in [[Madrid]], such as [[Caf\u00e9 Gij\u00f3n]], and to be noticed for his dandy attitude and his eccentric looks. \nHis hot temper got him involved in various affrays. Because one of those, at Caf\u00e9 de la Monta\u00f1a in 1899, an unfortunate stick wound by writer Manuel Bueno caused one of his cufflinks to inlay in his arm. The wound produced gangrene, and Valle-Incl\u00e1n had his arm amputated. That same year of 1899, he met [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]], and both of them became good friends. At that time, he published his first theater play, ''Cenizas (Ashes)'', and he started a very prolific literary period.\n\nIn 1907 he married the actress Josefina Blanco Tejerina.\n\nIn 1910 he traveled for six months to various Latin American countries ([[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Bolivia]]) escorting his wife on an acting tour.\n\nIn 1913 he returned to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and set his residence in Cambados. Then, after the death of his second son, he moved to La Puebla del Carabi\u00f1al.\n\nIn 1916 he published in the Cuban magazine Labor Gallega a poem in [[Galician language]] with the title of ''Cantiga de vellas (Son of old women)'', which is his most valuable contribution to Galician literature.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], he supported the allied army, visiting the front in various occasions as a war correspondent for ''El Imparcial''.\n\nIn 1921 he traveled to [[M\u00e9xico]] again, invited by the President of the Republic, [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]]. There he participated in many literary and cultural events, and got conquered by the [[Mexican Revolution]]. On his way back to [[Spain]], he spent two weeks in [[Havana]], and two weeks in [[New York City]]. That same year, 1921, he was appointed President of the International Federation of Latin American Intellectuals.\n\nHe returned to [[Spain]] at the end of 1921, and there he started to write ''Tirano Banderas (Tyrant Banderas)''. He went back to [[Madrid]] in 1922, still inflamed by the spirit of the [[Mexican Revolution]].\n\nSince 1924 he showed his opposition to [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]\u2019s dictatorship.\n\nWith the arrival of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], he run in the elections with the Partido Radical of [[Alejandro Lerroux]], but he did not get a seat.\n\nIn 1932 he divorced his wife, and he was appointed Director of the Museum of [[Aranjuez]] <ref>[http://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE/1932/029/A00732-00732.pdf MINISTERIO DE INSTRUCCI\u00d3N P\u00daBLICA Y BELLAS ARTES. \u00abDecreto, de 27 de enero de 1932, encargando al Conservador general del Tesoro Art\u00edstico Nacional la organizaci\u00f3n, como Museo, del que fue Real Sitio de Aranjuez\u00bb.

Ref. 1931/07313.]</ref>, but his confrontations with the Ministry because of the bad state of the palaces and museums under his direction forced his resigning.\n\nIn 1933 he was the director of the Spanish Academy of Fine Arts in [[Rome]], [[Italy]] <ref>[http://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE/1933/070/A01898-01898.pdf MINISTERIO DE ESTADO. \u00abDecreto, de 8 de marzo de 1933, nombrando Director de la Academia Espa\u00f1ola de Bellas Artes de Roma a D.

He despised literary realism and openly disregarded [[Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s]], its most prominent Spanish representative.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Stephen |last=Gilman |title=La palabra hablada y \"Fortunata y Jacinta\" |journal=Nueva Revista de Filolog\u00eda Hisp\u00e1nica |year=1961 |volume=15 |issue=3/4 |pages=542\u2013560 |doi=10.24201/nrfh.v15i3/4.391 |jstor=40297550 }}</ref> His political views, accordingly, changed from traditional absolutism (in Spain known as [[Carlismo]]) towards [[anarchism]]. This also caused him problems.\n\nAll his life he struggled to live up to his bohemian ideals, and stayed loyal to his [[Aestheticism|aestheticist]] beliefs. However, he had to write undercover for serialised popular novels. During a row with a fellow writer his wrist was wounded and became infected, and he lost his arm.\n\nValle-Incl\u00e1n's work, for example, ''Divine Words'' (''[[Divinas palabras (play)|Divinas palabras]]'') and ''[[Bohemian Lights]] (Luces de Bohemia)'' attacks what he saw as the [[hypocrisy]], [[moralism|moralising]] and [[sentimentality]] of the [[bourgeois]] playwrights, [[satire|satirises]] the views of the ruling classes and targets in particular concepts such as [[masculinity|masculine honour]], [[militarism]], [[patriotism]] and attitudes to the Crown and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. His drama also featured irreverent portrayal of figures from Spain's political past and deployed crude, obscene language and vulgar imagery in a mocking attack on theatrical blandness.\n\nIn addition to being politically subversive, though, Valle-Incl\u00e1n's plays often required staging and direction that went far beyond the abilities of many companies working in the commercial theatre, often featuring complex supernatural [[special effects]] and rapid, drastic changes of scene. For this reason, some of his works are regarded as [[closet drama]]s.\n\nValle-Incl\u00e1n also wrote major novels including the ''Tyrant Banderas'' (''[[Tirano Banderas]]''), which was influential on the Latin American [[Dictator novel|'dictator' novel]] (for example, ''[[I, the Supreme]]'' by [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]), although it was received with disdain by many Spanish American authors, [[Rufino Blanco Fombona]] for example, pokes fun of \"the America of tambourine\" (\"la Am\u00e9rica de pandereta\") of that novel where you could be in the jungle one day and the Andes the next. Some critics view him as being the Spanish equivalent to [[James Joyce]]; however, due to a lack of translations his work is still largely unknown in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world, although his reputation is slowly growing as translations are produced.\n\n===Plays===\n*''Cenizas.

He is particularly known as a writer of [[libretto|libretti]], primarily for [[zarzuela]]s. Although he was born in [[Oviedo]] and lived at times in both [[Zaragoza]] and [[Madrid]], he considered himself a son of Spain's [[La Mancha]] region, where his family had lived from the early 20th century in the small town of [[La Solana]] ([[Ciudad Real]]). The zarzuela ''La rosa del azafr\u00e1n'', composed by [[Jacinto Guerrero]] to a libretto by Romero, is considered emblematic of the region.<ref>Fern\u00e1ndez \u00c1lvarez (2007). The composer, Jacinto Guerrero was also from La Mancha.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nRomero was born in [[Oviedo]] to a well-to-do family. His father was an official with the [[Bank of Spain|Banco de Espa\u00f1a]], and his aunt owned a large [[hacienda]] in La Mancha.<ref>Garc\u00eda-Cervig\u00f3n (4 March 2009)</ref> He originally trained and worked as a [[mining engineering|mining engineer]].<ref name=\"Manzanares and Webber 2001\">Manzanares and Webber (2001)</ref> After suffering from health problems caused by his years in the mines, he took up a post with the [[Correos|Spanish Post Office]] in Madrid where he worked as a [[telegraphist]] from 1907 until 1917.<ref>Sadie (1992) Vol IV, p. 33. See also Oliv\u00e9 (2009) pp. 183 and Manzanares and Webber (2001)</ref> During that time he also began his writing career, and in 1911, published a long poem, ''Nochebuena en la Central'' in the magazine ''El Telegrafista Espa\u00f1ol''. Romero had been a close friend of the Spanish writer [[Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez-Shaw]], and after his death formed a writing partnership with his son, [[Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez-Shaw]], which was to produce over 70 libretti including those for two of the best-known zarzuelas of the 20th century, ''[[Do\u00f1a Francisquita]]'' by [[Amadeo Vives]] and ''[[Luisa Fernanda (zarzuela)|Luisa Fernanda]]'' by [[Federico Moreno Torroba]].<ref>''La Vanguardia'' (18 August 1965) p. 5</ref> The first libretto they wrote together was for the 1916 zarzuela, ''[[La canci\u00f3n del olvido]]'' by [[Jos\u00e9 Serrano (composer)|Jos\u00e9 Serrano]]. A year after its triumphal premiere, Romero gave up his job as a telegraphist to become a full-time writer. However, he continued to maintain ties with his former colleagues, contributing articles and poems to their magazines, ''El Tel\u00e9grafo Espa\u00f1ol'' and ''El Electricista'', into the 1930s. In 1943, he performed at the celebrations for the 88th anniversary of the Spanish Telegraph Service with two other telegraphists who also became zarzuela librettists, Pedro Llabr\u00e9s and Francisco Prada.<ref>Oliv\u00e9 (2009) p. 185. The Spanish Telegraph Service was established on 22 April 1855.</ref>\n\nIn the course of their 30-year collaboration, Romero and Fern\u00e1ndez-Shaw wrote libretti for virtually every Spanish lyric composer of the day. Although most of their libretti were original stories, several of them were based on works by Spanish playwrights such as [[Lope de Vega]], [[Manuel Machado (poet and playwright)|Manuel Machado]], and [[Jacinto Benavente]]. They also produced Spanish versions of stage plays by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], and [[Edmond Rostand|Rostand]]. Romero's partnership with Fern\u00e1ndez-Shaw ended in the late 1940s following a personal feud, after which Romero wrote libretti on his own, while Fern\u00e1ndez-Shaw began a new partnership with his brother Rafael.<ref name=\"Manzanares and Webber 2001\"/>\n\nRomero was one of the founders of the [[Sociedad General de Autores y Editores]] (SGAE) and served as a counselor to the organization.<ref>Hennessey (6 November 1976) p. 46.</ref> He was also a founding member of the Instituto de Estudios Madrile\u00f1os and published several monographs on the history of Madrid including ''Por la calle de Alcal\u00e1 '' (1953), ''Prehistoria de la gran v\u00eda'' (1966), and ''[[Ram\u00f3n de Mesonero Romanos|Mesonero Romanos]], activista del madrile\u00f1ismo'' (1968).

He is particularly known as a writer of [[libretto|libretti]], primarily for [[zarzuela]]s. Although he was born in [[Oviedo]] and lived at times in both [[Zaragoza]] and [[Madrid]], he considered himself a son of Spain's [[La Mancha]] region, where his family had lived from the early 20th century in the small town of [[La Solana]] ([[Ciudad Real]]). The zarzuela ''La rosa del azafr\u00e1n'', composed by [[Jacinto Guerrero]] to a libretto by Romero, is considered emblematic of the region.<ref>Fern\u00e1ndez \u00c1lvarez (2007). The composer, Jacinto Guerrero was also from La Mancha.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nRomero was born in [[Oviedo]] to a well-to-do family. His father was an official with the [[Bank of Spain|Banco de Espa\u00f1a]], and his aunt owned a large [[hacienda]] in La Mancha.<ref>Garc\u00eda-Cervig\u00f3n (4 March 2009)</ref> He originally trained and worked as a [[mining engineering|mining engineer]].<ref name=\"Manzanares and Webber 2001\">Manzanares and Webber (2001)</ref> After suffering from health problems caused by his years in the mines, he took up a post with the [[Correos|Spanish Post Office]] in Madrid where he worked as a [[telegraphist]] from 1907 until 1917.<ref>Sadie (1992) Vol IV, p. 33. See also Oliv\u00e9 (2009) pp. 183 and Manzanares and Webber (2001)</ref> During that time he also began his writing career, and in 1911, published a long poem, ''Nochebuena en la Central'' in the magazine ''El Telegrafista Espa\u00f1ol''. Romero had been a close friend of the Spanish writer [[Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez-Shaw]], and after his death formed a writing partnership with his son, [[Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez-Shaw]], which was to produce over 70 libretti including those for two of the best-known zarzuelas of the 20th century, ''[[Do\u00f1a Francisquita]]'' by [[Amadeo Vives]] and ''[[Luisa Fernanda (zarzuela)|Luisa Fernanda]]'' by [[Federico Moreno Torroba]].<ref>''La Vanguardia'' (18 August 1965) p. 5</ref> The first libretto they wrote together was for the 1916 zarzuela, ''[[La canci\u00f3n del olvido]]'' by [[Jos\u00e9 Serrano (composer)|Jos\u00e9 Serrano]]. A year after its triumphal premiere, Romero gave up his job as a telegraphist to become a full-time writer. However, he continued to maintain ties with his former colleagues, contributing articles and poems to their magazines, ''El Tel\u00e9grafo Espa\u00f1ol'' and ''El Electricista'', into the 1930s. In 1943, he performed at the celebrations for the 88th anniversary of the Spanish Telegraph Service with two other telegraphists who also became zarzuela librettists, Pedro Llabr\u00e9s and Francisco Prada.<ref>Oliv\u00e9 (2009) p. 185. The Spanish Telegraph Service was established on 22 April 1855.</ref>\n\nIn the course of their 30-year collaboration, Romero and Fern\u00e1ndez-Shaw wrote libretti for virtually every Spanish lyric composer of the day. Although most of their libretti were original stories, several of them were based on works by Spanish playwrights such as [[Lope de Vega]], [[Manuel Machado (poet and playwright)|Manuel Machado]], and [[Jacinto Benavente]]. They also produced Spanish versions of stage plays by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], and [[Edmond Rostand|Rostand]]. Romero's partnership with Fern\u00e1ndez-Shaw ended in the late 1940s following a personal feud, after which Romero wrote libretti on his own, while Fern\u00e1ndez-Shaw began a new partnership with his brother Rafael.<ref name=\"Manzanares and Webber 2001\"/>\n\nRomero was one of the founders of the [[Sociedad General de Autores y Editores]] (SGAE) and served as a counselor to the organization.<ref>Hennessey (6 November 1976) p. 46.</ref> He was also a founding member of the Instituto de Estudios Madrile\u00f1os and published several monographs on the history of Madrid including ''Por la calle de Alcal\u00e1 '' (1953), ''Prehistoria de la gran v\u00eda'' (1966), and ''[[Ram\u00f3n de Mesonero Romanos|Mesonero Romanos]], activista del madrile\u00f1ismo'' (1968).

He also wrote several libretti on his own, including those for [[Ernesto Rosillo]]'s 1922 [[revue]], ''La rubia del Far-West'', and [[Juan Dotras Vila]]'s 1952 zarzuela, ''Aquella canci\u00f3n Antigua''.<ref name=\"Manzanares and Webber 2001\"/> The libretti written with Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez-Shaw include:\n* 1916.

In contemporary globalization, migrations to Europe have accelerated in speed and scale.

A number also went to other European countries (notably France, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium). As living standards in these countries have risen, the trend has reversed and they were a magnet for immigration (most notably from Morocco, Somalia, Egypt to Italy and Greece; from Morocco, Algeria and Latin America to Spain and Portugal; and from Ireland, India, Pakistan, Germany, the United States, Bangladesh, and Jamaica to the United Kingdom).\n\n==Migration within Europe after the 1985 Schengen Agreement==\nAs a result of the 1985 [[Schengen Agreement]], there is free travel within Europe. Citizens of [[Member State of the European Union|European Union member states]] and their families have the right to live and work anywhere within the EU because of [[Citizenship of the european union|EU citizenship]] but citizens of non-EU or non-EEA states do not have those rights unless they possess the EU Long Term Residence Permit or are family members of EU citizens. Nevertheless, all holders of valid residence permits of a Schengen State have the unrestricted right to travel within the [[Schengen Area]] for tourist purposes only, and for up to three months.\n\nA large proportion of immigrants in western European states have come from former eastern bloc states in the 1990s, especially in Spain, Greece, Germany, Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom. There are frequently specific migration patterns, with geography, language and culture playing a role. For example, there are large numbers of [[Poles]] who have moved to the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] and [[Iceland]], while [[Romanians]] and also [[Bulgarians]] have chosen [[Spain]] and [[Italy]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5385958.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Europe diary: Romanian emigration|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 May 2016|date=2006-09-28}}</ref> In fact, with the earlier of the two recent enlargements of the EU, although most countries restricted free movement by nationals of the acceding countries, the United Kingdom did not restrict for the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union]] and received Polish, Latvian and other citizens of the new EU states. Spain was not restricted for the [[2007 enlargement of the European Union]] and received many Romanians and Bulgarians as well other citizens of the new EU states.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nMany of these Polish immigrants to the UK have since returned to Poland, after the serious economic crisis in the UK. Nevertheless, free movement of EU nationals is now an important aspect of migration within the EU, since there are now 27 member states, and has resulted in serious political tensions between Italy and Romania, since Italy has expressed the intention of restricting free movement of EU nationals (contrary to Treaty obligations and the clear jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice).\n\nAnother migration trend has been that of [[Northern Europe]]ans moving toward [[Southern Europe]]. Citizens from the European Union make up a growing proportion of immigrants in Spain, coming chiefly from the United Kingdom and Germany, but also from Italy, France, Portugal, The Netherlands, Belgium, etc. British authorities estimate that the population of UK citizens living in Spain is much larger than Spanish official figures suggest, establishing them at about 1,000,000, with 800,000 being permanent residents. According to the ''Financial Times'', Spain is the most favoured destination for Western Europeans considering to move from their own country and seek jobs elsewhere in the EU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/in_depth/brits_abroad/html/europe.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Special Reports - Brits Abroad|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6161705.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Brits Abroad: Country-by-country|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 May 2016|date=2006-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/spain/article/0,,1830838,00.html|title=Spain attracts record levels of immigrants seeking jobs and sun|author=Giles Tremlett|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=13 May 2016|date=2006-07-26}}</ref><ref>[http://www.byebyeblighty.com/1/british-immigrants-swamping-spanish-villages/ Bye Bye Blighty article: British Immigrants Swamping Spanish Villages?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223102348/http://www.byebyeblighty.com/1/british-immigrants-swamping-spanish-villages/ |date=December 23, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/spain/article/0,,1588156,00.html|title=An Englishman's home is his casa as thousands go south|author=Jason Burke|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=13 May 2016|date=2005-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6210358.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - 5.5m Britons 'opt to live abroad'|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 May 2016|date=2006-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5237236.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - More Britons consider move abroad|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 May 2016|date=2006-08-02}}</ref>\n\n==Immigration from outside Europe since the 1980s==\n{{See also|European migrant crisis}}\n{{cleanup rewrite|reason=this should give a coherent picture of immigration to Europe since 1980, it shouldn't degenerate into a \"one section per country\" dump.

For the former colonial powers France, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, and Portugal, most immigrants, and their descendants have ties to former colonies in Africa, the Americas, and Asia. In addition, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Belgium recruited Turkish and Moroccan guest workers beginning in the 1960s, and many current immigrants in those countries today have ties to such recruitment programs. \n\nMoroccan immigrants also began migrating substantially to Spain and Italy for work opportunities in the 1980s. In the Scandinavian countries of Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland, the bulk of non-Western immigrants are refugees and asylum seekers from the Middle East, East Africa, and other regions of the world arriving since the 1980s and 1990s. Increasing globalization has brought a population of students, professionals, and workers from all over the world into major European cities, most notably London, Paris, and Frankfurt. The introduction of the [[Blue Card (European Union)|EU Blue Card]] in May 2009 has further increased the number of skilled professional immigrants from outside of the continent. \n\nIllegal immigration and asylum-seeking in Europe from outside the continent have been occurring since at least the 1990s. While the number of migrants was relatively small for years, it began to rise in 2013. In 2015, the number of asylum seekers arriving from outside Europe increased substantially during the [[European migrant crisis]] (see [[Timeline of the European migrant crisis|timeline]]). However, the EU-Turkey deal enacted in March 2016 dramatically reduced this number, and anti-immigrant measures starting in 2017 by the Italian government further cut illegal immigration from the Mediterranean route.\n\nSome scholars claim that the increase in immigration flows from the 1980s is due to [[globalization|global inequalities]] between poor and rich countries.<ref name=\"Calefato94p80\">Calefato (1994) pp.80-1 quote: {{quotation|La presenza di questi immigrati in Europa non e' semplicemente finalizzata alla ricerca di un lavoro, (per lo piu' come camerieri, venditori ambulanti, braccianti stagionali, ecc.).

One of the reasons was that second-generation immigrants from non-Western countries marry someone from their country of origin and so Danish is not spoken at home which disadvantages children in school.

Since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[enlargement of the European Union]], the increased movement of people out of countries such as [[Poland]], [[Romania]] and [[Lithuania]] has shifted much of this attention towards migrants from [[Eastern Europe]]. While working-class migrants tend to be the focus of anti-immigration sentiment, there is also some discontent about [[Russia]]n, [[China|Chinese]], [[Singapore]]an and [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf Arab]] multimillionaires resident in the UK, particularly in [[London]] and [[South East England]]. These residents often invest in property and business, and are perceived as living extravagant \"jet-set\" lifestyles marked by conspicuous consumption while simultaneously taking advantage of tax loopholes connected to [[Taxation in the United Kingdom#Residence and domicile|non-dom status]].\n\nPolicies of reduced immigration, particularly from the European Union, are central to the manifestos of parties such as the [[UK Independence Party]]. Such policies have also been discussed by some members of the largest parties in Parliament, most significantly the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]].\n\n==Statistics==\n\n===By host country===\n\n==== 2013 data ====\nThis is a list of European countries by [[immigration|immigrant population]], based on the [[United Nations]] report ''Trends in International Migrant Stock: The 2013 Revision''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unmigration/migrantstocks2013.htm?mtotals|title=International Migration and Development|website=Esa.un.org|accessdate=13 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Country !!

A number also went to other European countries (notably France, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium). As living standards in these countries have risen, the trend has reversed and they were a magnet for immigration (most notably from Morocco, Somalia, Egypt to Italy and Greece; from Morocco, Algeria and Latin America to Spain and Portugal; and from Ireland, India, Pakistan, Germany, the United States, Bangladesh, and Jamaica to the United Kingdom).\n\n==Migration within Europe after the 1985 Schengen Agreement==\nAs a result of the 1985 [[Schengen Agreement]], there is free travel within Europe. Citizens of [[Member State of the European Union|European Union member states]] and their families have the right to live and work anywhere within the EU because of [[Citizenship of the european union|EU citizenship]] but citizens of non-EU or non-EEA states do not have those rights unless they possess the EU Long Term Residence Permit or are family members of EU citizens. Nevertheless, all holders of valid residence permits of a Schengen State have the unrestricted right to travel within the [[Schengen Area]] for tourist purposes only, and for up to three months.\n\nA large proportion of immigrants in western European states have come from former eastern bloc states in the 1990s, especially in Spain, Greece, Germany, Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom. There are frequently specific migration patterns, with geography, language and culture playing a role. For example, there are large numbers of [[Poles]] who have moved to the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] and [[Iceland]], while [[Romanians]] and also [[Bulgarians]] have chosen [[Spain]] and [[Italy]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5385958.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Europe diary: Romanian emigration|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 May 2016|date=2006-09-28}}</ref> In fact, with the earlier of the two recent enlargements of the EU, although most countries restricted free movement by nationals of the acceding countries, the United Kingdom did not restrict for the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union]] and received Polish, Latvian and other citizens of the new EU states. Spain was not restricted for the [[2007 enlargement of the European Union]] and received many Romanians and Bulgarians as well other citizens of the new EU states.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nMany of these Polish immigrants to the UK have since returned to Poland, after the serious economic crisis in the UK. Nevertheless, free movement of EU nationals is now an important aspect of migration within the EU, since there are now 28 member states, and has resulted in serious political tensions between Italy and Romania, since Italy has expressed the intention of restricting free movement of EU nationals (contrary to Treaty obligations and the clear jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice).\n\nAnother migration trend has been that of [[Northern Europe]]ans moving toward [[Southern Europe]]. Citizens from the European Union make up a growing proportion of immigrants in Spain, coming chiefly from the United Kingdom and Germany, but also from Italy, France, Portugal, The Netherlands, Belgium, etc. British authorities estimate that the population of UK citizens living in Spain is much larger than Spanish official figures suggest, establishing them at about 1,000,000, with 800,000 being permanent residents. According to the ''Financial Times'', Spain is the most favoured destination for Western Europeans considering to move from their own country and seek jobs elsewhere in the EU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/in_depth/brits_abroad/html/europe.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Special Reports - Brits Abroad|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6161705.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Brits Abroad: Country-by-country|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 May 2016|date=2006-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/spain/article/0,,1830838,00.html|title=Spain attracts record levels of immigrants seeking jobs and sun|author=Giles Tremlett|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=13 May 2016|date=2006-07-26}}</ref><ref>[http://www.byebyeblighty.com/1/british-immigrants-swamping-spanish-villages/ Bye Bye Blighty article: British Immigrants Swamping Spanish Villages?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223102348/http://www.byebyeblighty.com/1/british-immigrants-swamping-spanish-villages/ |date=December 23, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/spain/article/0,,1588156,00.html|title=An Englishman's home is his casa as thousands go south|author=Jason Burke|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=13 May 2016|date=2005-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6210358.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - 5.5m Britons 'opt to live abroad'|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 May 2016|date=2006-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5237236.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - More Britons consider move abroad|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 May 2016|date=2006-08-02}}</ref>\n\n==Immigration from outside Europe since the 1980s==\n{{See also|European migrant crisis}}\n{{cleanup rewrite|reason=this should give a coherent picture of immigration to Europe since 1980, it shouldn't degenerate into a \"one section per country\" dump. There can be standalone articles by country, but there is no need to rehash their content here, a link is enough|date=November 2014}}\n\nWhile most immigrant populations in European countries are dominated by other Europeans, many immigrants and their descendants have ancestral origins outside the continent. For the former colonial powers France, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, and Portugal, most immigrants, and their descendants have ties to former colonies in Africa, the Americas, and Asia. In addition, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Belgium recruited Turkish and Moroccan guest workers beginning in the 1960s, and many current immigrants in those countries today have ties to such recruitment programs. \n\nMoroccan immigrants also began migrating substantially to Spain and Italy for work opportunities in the 1980s. In the Scandinavian countries of Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland, the bulk of non-Western immigrants are refugees and asylum seekers from the Middle East, East Africa, and other regions of the world arriving since the 1980s and 1990s. Increasing globalization has brought a population of students, professionals, and workers from all over the world into major European cities, most notably London, Paris, and Frankfurt. The introduction of the [[Blue Card (European Union)|EU Blue Card]] in May 2009 has further increased the number of skilled professional immigrants from outside of the continent. \n\nIllegal immigration and asylum-seeking in Europe from outside the continent have been occurring since at least the 1990s. While the number of migrants was relatively small for years, it began to rise in 2013. In 2015, the number of asylum seekers arriving from outside Europe increased substantially during the [[European migrant crisis]] (see [[Timeline of the European migrant crisis|timeline]]). However, the EU-Turkey deal enacted in March 2016 dramatically reduced this number, and anti-immigrant measures starting in 2017 by the Italian government further cut illegal immigration from the Mediterranean route.\n\nSome scholars claim that the increase in immigration flows from the 1980s is due to [[globalization|global inequalities]] between poor and rich countries.<ref name=\"Calefato94p80\">Calefato (1994) pp.80-1 quote: {{quotation|La presenza di questi immigrati in Europa non e' semplicemente finalizzata alla ricerca di un lavoro, (per lo piu' come camerieri, venditori ambulanti, braccianti stagionali, ecc.).

This assumption was disproved by a 2019 study by the [[Danish Immigration Service]] and the [[Ministry of Education (Denmark)|Ministry of Education]], while the second generation non-Western immigrants do better than the first generation, the third generation of immigrants with non-Western background do no better education and employment wise than the second generation. One of the reasons was that second-generation immigrants from non-Western countries marry someone from their country of origin and so Danish is not spoken at home which disadvantages children in school. Thereby the process of integration has to start from the beginning for each generation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.berlingske.dk/content/item/1329273|title=Opr\u00e5b fra ministre: Problemer med integration af b\u00f8rn af ikkevestlige indvandrere|date=2018-12-16|website=Berlingske.dk|language=da|access-date=2019-01-29}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Ministry of Finance (Denmark)|Danish Ministry of Finance]], non-Western immigration will cost the public expenses 33 billion [[Danish krone|DKK]] annually (about 4.4 billion euro) for the foreseeable future due to the low levels of employment.

While working-class migrants tend to be the focus of anti-immigration sentiment, there is also some discontent about [[Russia]]n, [[China|Chinese]], [[Singapore]]an and [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf Arab]] multimillionaires resident in the UK, particularly in [[London]] and [[South East England]]. These residents often invest in property and business, and are perceived as living extravagant \"jet-set\" lifestyles marked by conspicuous consumption while simultaneously taking advantage of tax loopholes connected to [[Taxation in the United Kingdom#Residence and domicile|non-dom status]].\n\nPolicies of reduced immigration, particularly from the European Union, are central to the manifestos of parties such as the [[UK Independence Party]]. Such policies have also been discussed by some members of the largest parties in Parliament, most significantly the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]].\n\n==Statistics==\n\n===By host country===\n\n==== 2013 data ====\nThis is a list of European countries by [[immigration|immigrant population]], based on the [[United Nations]] report ''Trends in International Migrant Stock: The 2013 Revision''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unmigration/migrantstocks2013.htm?mtotals|title=International Migration and Development|website=Esa.un.org|accessdate=13 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Country !!
