Starting on December 22, 2008, \"Xplosion Xclusive\" matches were also streamed on the TNA website and TNA's [[YouTube]] page.\n\n===2010\u20132014===\nThe show was revamped at the June 14, 2010, tapings of the 300th episode of ''Xplosion'', featuring more original matches instead of a highlight show, with [[Jeremy Borash]] and [[Mike Tenay]] on commentary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TNA_News_1/article_41951.shtml|title=TNA News: TNA revamping Xplosion show with new format and lead announcer|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2010-06-14|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref> In addition to the format changes, ''Xplosion'' received a new logo, graphics and theme music performed by [[Taproot (band)|Taproot]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnawrestling.com/news/item/2010-tna-relaunches-xplosion-program|title=TNA Relaunches \"Xplosion\" Program|accessdate=2010-06-21|publisher=TNAwrestling.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624015444/http://www.tnawrestling.com/news/item/2010-tna-relaunches-xplosion-program|archivedate=2010-06-24}}</ref>\n\nXplosion also features the Spin Cycle, where Borash had a Q&A session with various TNA stars in front of a live crowd. In 2013, TNA started including matches from the early years of TNA and matches prior to the upcoming TNA PPV.\n\nBeginning in December 2013, [[Rockstar Spud]] replaced long term color commentator Mike Tenay, who thereafter stood in for Spud in 2014 from time to time when Spud could not make the tapings.\n\n=== 2014\u20132016 ===\n''Xplosion'' was again reformatted beginning with the May 31, 2014, episode. The show was reformatted with families in mind, as it aired on Saturday mornings in the UK. It was still hosted by Jeremy Borash and features a mix of new and classic matches. The Spin Cycle segment also returned for a time.\n\n=== 2017\u2013present ===\nIn early 2017, TNA changed its name to Impact Wrestling, and to reflect this change, the show gradually became known as simply ''Xplosion'' instead of ''TNA Xplosion'' - with the TNA logo rarely featuring in archived footage. It later was renamed ''Impact Xplosion''. On October 10, 2017, Impact Wrestling launched its streaming service, the Global Wrestling Network (now [[Impact Plus]]), with ''Xplosion'' as one of its programs. This made the program available in the US for the first time since 2006. Xplosion is taped along with Impact and is streamed on Wednesday\u2019s 7PM ET on Impact\u2019s [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] Channel as well as being uploaded to Impact Plus the same day.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Impact Wrestling tournaments#Xplosion Championship Challenge|TNA Xplosion Championship Challenge]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://globalwrestlingnetwork.com/}}\n*{{tv.com show|tna-xplosion}}\n*{{IMDb title|tt10701822}}\n\n{{TNA Wrestling}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Xplosion}}\n[[Category:2000s American television series]]\n[[Category:2002 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States]]\n[[Category:Impact Wrestling television programs|Xplosion]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n", "name_user": "AussieLegend", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(No FUR or licensing information)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact!_Xplosion"}

Wigwam means \"house\" in the Abenaki tribe and wetu means \"house\" in the Wampanoag tribe.\" ''A Historical Look at American Indians''. [books.google.com/books?id=iavZMkdjp0MC]</ref> or '''wiigiiwaam''' in the [[Ojibwe language]], is a semi-permanent domed dwelling formerly used by certain [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] tribes, and still used for ceremonial purposes. The term ''wickiup'' is generally used to label these kinds of dwellings in the [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Western United States]], while ''wigwam''  is usually applied to these structures in the [[Northeastern United States]] and Canada. ''[[Wetu]]'' is the [[Wampanoag]] term for a wigwam dwelling. These terms can refer to many distinct types of Native American structures regardless of location or cultural group. The wigwam is not to be confused with the Native Plains [[teepee]], which has a very different construction, structure, and use.\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Nu-nu-shi-unt, the dreamer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Paiute]] wickiup]]\nThe domed, round shelter was used by numerous Native American cultures. The curved surfaces  make it an ideal shelter for all kinds of conditions.\nThese structures are formed with a frame of arched poles, most often wooden, which are covered with some sort of bark roofing material. Details of construction vary with the culture and local availability of materials. Some of the roofing materials used include grass, brush, bark, rushes, mats, reeds, hides or cloth.\n\n[[File:Ojibwe wiigiwaam and Dakota-style tipis, White Earth 1928.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Sioux|Dakota]]-style tipis and [[Ojibwe]] wigwam, [[White Earth, Minnesota]], 1928]]\n[[File:Ojibwa wigwam.jpg|thumb|200px|Ojibwe wigwam, from an 1846 painting by [[Paul Kane]]]]\nWigwams were most often seasonal structures although the term is applied to rounded and conical structures built by Native American groups that were more permanent. Wigwams usually take longer to put up than [[tipi]]s and their frames are usually not portable like a tipi.\n\nA typical wigwam in the Northeast had a curved surface which can hold up against the worst weather. Young green tree saplings of just about any type of wood, ten to fifteen feet long, were cut down and bent. While the saplings were being bent, a circle was drawn on the ground. The diameter of the circle varied from ten to sixteen feet. The bent saplings were then placed over the drawn circle, using the tallest saplings in the middle and the shorter ones on the outside. The saplings formed arches all in one direction on the circle. The next set of saplings were used to wrap around the wigwam to give the shelter support. When the two sets of saplings were finally tied together, the sides and roof were placed on it. The sides of the wigwam were usually bark stripped from trees. The male of the family was responsible for the framing of the wigwam.\n\n[[Mary Rowlandson]] uses the term Wigwam in reference to the dwelling places of the Native Americans that she stayed with while in their captivity during [[King Philip's War]] in 1675. The term wigwam has remained in common English usage as a synonym for any \"Indian house\"; however this usage is incorrect as there are known differences between the wigwam and the tipi within the Native American community.\n\nDuring the American revolution the term ''wigwam'' was used by British soldiers to describe a wide variety of makeshift structures.<ref>For a complete description, see \"We are now ... properly ... enwigwamed.\" ''British Soldiers and Brush Huts, 1776\u20131781'', John U. Rees, 2003 (originally published in the ''Military Collector & Historian'', volume 55, number 2 (Summer 2003), 89-96.</ref>\n\n===Wickiups of the west===\nWickiups were used by different [[indigenous peoples of the Great Basin]], Southwest, and Pacific Coast. They were single room, dome-shaped dwellings, with a great deal of variation in size, shape, and materials.\n\nThe [[Acjachemen]], an [[indigenous people of California]], built cone-shaped huts made of [[willow]] branches covered with brush or mats made of [[tule]] leaves. Known as ''Kiichas'', the temporary shelters were utilized for sleeping or as refuge in cases of inclement weather. When a dwelling reached the end of its practical life it was simply burned, and a replacement erected in its place in about a day's time.\n\nBelow is a description of [[Chiricahua]] wickiups recorded by anthropologist Morris Opler:\n\nThe home in which the family lives is made by the men and is ordinarily a circular, dome-shaped brush dwelling, with the floor at ground level. It is eight feet high at the center and approximately seven feet in diameter. To build it, long fresh poles of oak or willow are driven into the ground or placed in holes made with a digging stick. These poles, which form the framework, are arranged at one-foot intervals and are bound together at the top with yucca-leaf strands. Over them a thatching of bundles of big bluestem grass or bear grass is tied, shingle style, with yucca strings. A smoke hole opens above a central fireplace. A hide, suspended at the entrance, is fixed on a cross-beam so that it may be swung forward or backward. The doorway may face in any direction. For waterproofing, pieces of hide are thrown over the outer hatching, and in rainy weather, if a fire is not needed, even the smoke hole is covered. In warm, dry weather much of the outer roofing is stripped off. It takes approximately three days to erect a sturdy dwelling of this type. These houses are \"warm and comfortable even though there is a big snow.\" The interior is lined with brush and grass beds over which robes are spread....<ref>Opler: 22\u201323</ref>\n\n{{quote|The woman not only makes the furnishings of the home but is responsible for the construction, maintenance, and repair of the dwelling itself and for the arrangement of everything in it. She provides the grass and brush beds and replaces them when they become too old and dry....

He had to leave the country after [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|the failed Hungarian Communist Revolution of 1919]] because of his socialist activism. He acted in several films in [[Weimar Germany]] before arriving in the United States as a seaman on a merchant ship.\n\nIn 1927, he appeared as Count Dracula in a Broadway adaptation of [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[Dracula|novel]]. He later appeared in the 1931 film ''Dracula'' directed by [[Tod Browning]] and produced by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]. Through the 1930s, he occupied an important niche in horror films, with their East European setting, but his Hungarian accent limited his potential casting, and he unsuccessfully tried to avoid [[typecasting]].\n\nMeanwhile, he was often paired with [[Boris Karloff]], who was able to demand top billing. To his frustration, Lugosi, a charter member of the American [[Screen Actors Guild]], was increasingly restricted to minor parts, kept employed by the studio principally so that they could put his name on the posters. Among his pairings with Karloff, he performed major roles only in ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1934), ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]'' (1935), and ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939); even in ''The Raven'', Karloff received top billing despite Lugosi performing the lead role. By this time, Lugosi had been receiving regular medication for [[sciatica|sciatic neuritis]], and he became addicted to [[morphine]] and [[methadone]]. This drug dependence was known to producers, and the offers eventually dwindled to a few parts in [[Ed Wood]]'s low-budget films\u2014including a brief appearance in ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959). Lugosi was married five times and had one son, [[Bela G. Lugosi|Bela George]]. He died of a heart attack on 16 August 1956.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Bela Lugosi 18.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Lugosi at age 18]]\nLugosi, the youngest of four children,<ref name=monsters-universal-studios>{{cite book |author1=Osborn, Jennifer (editor) |author2=Milano, Roy (photo captions) |year=2006 |title=Monsters: A Celebration of the Classics from Universal Studios |publisher=Del Ray Books, imprint of Random House, Inc. |location=New York, NY |page=38 |isbn=0-345-48685-4}} Referenced information is from an essay in the book written by his son Bela G.

Lugosi was proscribed from acting due to his participation in the formation of an actors' [[labor union|union]]. Exiled in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]]-era Germany, he began appearing in a small number of well-received films, among them adaptations of the [[Karl May]] novels ''[[On the Brink of Paradise]]'' (''Auf den Tr\u00fcmmern des Paradieses'', 1920) and ''[[Caravan of Death (film)|Caravan of Death]]'' (''Die Todeskarawane'', also 1920) with [[Dora Gerson]] (Gerson, who was Jewish, died in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]).\n\nLugosi left Germany in October 1920, intending to emigrate to the United States, and entered the country at [[New Orleans]] in December 1920.

His accent, while a part of his image, limited the roles he could play.\n\nLugosi did attempt to break type by auditioning for other roles. He lost out to [[Lionel Barrymore]] for the role of [[Grigori Rasputin]] in ''[[Rasputin and the Empress]]'' (also 1932); [[C. Henry Gordon]] for the role of Surat Khan in ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936 film)|Charge of the Light Brigade]]'' (1936), and [[Basil Rathbone]] for the role of Commissar Dimitri Gorotchenko in ''[[Tovarich (film)|Tovarich]]'' (1937) a role Lugosi had played on stage).<ref name=\"Bela Lugosi In Person\">{{cite book |last1=Kaffenberger |first1=Bill |last2=Rhodes |first2=Gary |title=Bela Lugosi In Person |date=2015 |publisher=BearManor Media |isbn=978-1593938055 }}</ref> He played the elegant, somewhat hot-tempered General Nicholas Strenovsky-Petronovich in ''[[International House (1933 film)|International House]]'' (1933).\n\nRegardless of controversy, five films at Universal \u2014 ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1934), ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]'' (1935), ''[[The Invisible Ray (1936 film)|The Invisible Ray]]'' (1936), ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939), ''[[Black Friday (1940 film)|Black Friday]]'' (1940), plus minor cameo performances in ''[[Gift of Gab (1934 film)|Gift of Gab]]'' (1934) and two at [[RKO Pictures]], ''[[You'll Find Out]]'' (1940) and ''[[The Body Snatcher (film)|The Body Snatcher]]'' (1945) \u2014 paired Lugosi with [[Boris Karloff]]. Despite the relative size of their roles, Lugosi inevitably received second billing, below Karloff. There are contradictory reports of Lugosi's attitude toward Karloff, some claiming that he was openly resentful of Karloff's long-term success and ability to gain good roles beyond the horror arena, while others suggested the two actors were \u2014 for a time, at least \u2014 good friends. Karloff himself in interviews suggested that Lugosi was initially mistrustful of him when they acted together, believing that the Englishman would attempt to upstage him. When this proved not to be the case, according to Karloff, Lugosi settled down and they worked together amicably (though some have further commented that the English Karloff's on-set demand to break from filming for mid-afternoon tea annoyed Lugosi).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mank |first1=Gregory William |title=Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff : the expanded story of a haunting collaboration, with a complete filmography of their films together |date=2009 |publisher=McFarland & Co., Publishers |location=Jefferson, N.C. |isbn=978-0786434800 |pages=237\u2013238}}</ref> Karloff also insinuated that his rival could not act, claiming Lugosi had \"never learned his trade\". A small percentage of critics cited his \"dull and slow performance\" in ''Dracula'' as a great example of minimal dialogue with no real acting prowess needed. Lugosi did get a few heroic leads, as in Universal's ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' after Karloff had been accorded the more colorful role of the villain, ''[[The Invisible Ray (1936 film)|The Invisible Ray]]'', and a romantic role in producer [[Sol Lesser]]'s adventure serial ''[[The Return of Chandu]]'' (1934), but his typecasting problem appears to have been too entrenched to be alleviated by those films.\n[[File:B\u00e9la Lugosi-Angelo Rossitto in Scared to Death.jpg|thumb|With [[Angelo Rossitto]] in ''[[Scared to Death]]'' (1947)]]\nLugosi addressed his plea to be cast in non-horror roles directly to casting directors through his listing in the 1937 ''Players Directory'', published by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], in which he (or his agent) calls the idea that he is only fit for horror films \"an error.\"<ref>Michael Mallory. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Universal_Studios_Monsters.html?id=ZHhOPgAACAAJ ''Universal Studios Monsters: A Legacy of Horror''], 2009, Universe, p. 63. {{ISBN|978-0-7893-1896-1}}.</ref>\n\n===Career decline===\n[[File:LugosiDevilBat1.jpg|thumb|right|Lugosi in ''[[The Devil Bat]]'' (1940)]]\nA number of factors began to work against Lugosi's career in the mid-1930s. Universal changed management in 1936, and because of a British ban on horror films, dropped them from their production schedule; Lugosi found himself consigned to Universal's non-horror [[B-movie|B-film]] unit, at times in small roles where he was obviously used for \"name value\" only. Throughout the 1930s, Lugosi, experiencing a severe career decline despite popularity with audiences (Universal executives always preferred his rival Karloff), accepted many leading roles from independent producers like [[Nat Levine]], [[Sol Lesser]], and [[Sam Katzman]]. These low-budget thrillers indicate that Lugosi was less discriminating than Karloff in selecting screen vehicles, but the exposure helped Lugosi financially if not artistically. Lugosi tried to keep busy with stage work, but had to borrow money from the [[Actors Fund of America]] to pay hospital bills when his only child, Bela George Lugosi, was born in 1938.\n\nHistorian John McElwee reports, in his 2013 book ''Showmen, Sell It Hot!'', that Bela Lugosi's popularity received a much-needed boost in August 1938, when California theater owner Emil Umann revived ''Dracula'' and ''Frankenstein'' as a special double feature. The combination was so successful that Umann scheduled extra shows to accommodate the capacity crowds, and invited Lugosi to appear in person, which thrilled new audiences that had never seen Lugosi's classic performance. \"I owe it all to that little man at the Regina Theatre,\" said Lugosi of exhibitor Umann. \"I was dead, and he brought me back to life.\" Universal took notice of the tremendous business and launched its own national re-release of the same two horror favorites. The studio then rehired Lugosi to star in new films.\n\nThe first was Universal's ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939), when he played the character role of Ygor, a mad blacksmith with a broken neck, in heavy makeup and beard. The same year saw Lugosi making a rare appearance in an A-list motion picture: he was a stern commissar in [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s romantic comedy ''[[Ninotchka]]'', starring [[Greta Garbo]] and directed by [[Ernst Lubitsch]]. Lugosi was effective in this small but prestigious character role, and it could have been a turning point for the actor, but within the year, he was back on Hollywood's Poverty Row, playing leads for Sam Katzman. These horror, comedy and [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] B-films were released by [[Monogram Pictures]]. At Universal, he often received star billing for what amounted to a supporting part. ''[[The Gorilla (1939 film)|The Gorilla]]'' (1939) had him playing straight man to [[Patsy Kelly]] and the [[Ritz Brothers]].\n[[File:Invisible Ghost (1941) 1.jpg|thumb|left|Lugosi (center) with [[Polly Ann Young]] and [[Clarence Muse]] in ''[[The Invisible Ghost]]'' (1941)]]\n\nOstensibly due to injuries received during military service, Lugosi developed severe, chronic [[sciatica]]. Though at first he was treated with pain remedies such as [[asparagus]] juice, doctors increased the medication to [[opiate]]s. The growth of his dependence on [[analgesic]] drugs, particularly [[morphine]] and, after 1947 when it became available in America, [[methadone]], was directly proportional to the dwindling of screen offers. He was finally cast in the role of [[Frankenstein's monster]] for Universal's ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' (1943), but Lugosi had no dialogue.

For the remainder of his life he appeared \u2014 less and less frequently \u2014 in obscure, low-budget features. From 1947 to 1950, he performed in [[summer stock]], often in productions of ''Dracula'' or ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'', and during the other parts of the year made personal appearances in a touring \"spook show\", and on early commercial television.\n\nIn September 1949 [[Milton Berle]] invited Lugosi to appear in a sketch on ''[[Texaco Star Theatre]]''.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/9-27-1949/episode/670241/summary.htmlTexaco Star Theater Episode Guide], tv.com; accessed 1 November 2015.</ref> Lugosi memorized the script for the skit, but became confused on the air when Berle began to ad lib.<ref>{{cite book |last=Weaver |first=Tom |title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Film Flashbacks: Conversations with 24 Actors, Writers, Producers and Directors from the Golden Age |publisher=McFarland |year=2004 |page=160 |isbn=0-7864-2070-7}}</ref> His only television dramatic role was on the anthology series ''[[Suspense (U.S. TV series)|Suspense]]'' on October 11, 1949, in an adaptation of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[The Cask of Amontillado]]''.<ref>''The Complete Actors' Television Credits, 1948\u20131988, James Robert Parrish and Vincent Terrace''<!--publishing info, ISSN/ISBN, year needed--></ref>\n\nIn 1951, while in [[England]] to play a six-month tour of ''Dracula'', Lugosi co-starred in a [[Low culture|lowbrow]] film comedy, ''[[Mother Riley Meets the Vampire]]'' (also known as ''Vampire over London'' and ''My Son, the Vampire''), released the following year. Following his return to the United States, he was interviewed for television, and reflected wistfully on his typecasting in horror parts: \"Now I am the [[Bogeyman|boogie man]]\". In the same interview he expressed a desire to play more comedy, as he had in the ''Mother Riley'' [[farce]]. Independent producer Jack Broder took Lugosi at his word, casting him in a jungle-themed comedy, ''[[Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla]]'' (1952), co-starring nightclub comedians [[Duke Mitchell]] and [[Sammy Petrillo]], whose act closely resembled that of [[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]].\n\n===Stage and personal appearances===\nLugosi enjoyed a lively career on stage. with plenty of personal appearances. As film offers declined, he became more and more dependent on live venues to support his family. Bela took over the role of Jonathan Brewster from Boris Karloff for ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]''. Bela had also expressed interest in playing Elwood P.

During [[post-production]] of the latter, Lugosi decided to seek treatment for his [[drug addiction]], and the premiere of the film was said to be intended to help pay for his hospital expenses. According to [[Kitty Kelley]]'s biography of [[Frank Sinatra]], when the entertainer heard of Lugosi's problems, he helped with expenses and visited Lugosi at the hospital. Sinatra would recall Lugosi's amazement at his visit, since the two men had never met before.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kelley |first=Kitty |title=His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra |publisher=Bantam Books |year=1987 |page=[https://archive.org/details/hiswayunauthoriz00kell_0/page/248 248] |isbn=0-553-26515-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hiswayunauthoriz00kell_0/page/248 }}</ref>\n\nDuring an impromptu interview upon his exit from the treatment center in 1955, Lugosi stated that he was about to go to work on a new Ed Wood film, ''The Ghoul Goes West''. This was one of several projects proposed by Wood, including ''The Phantom Ghoul'' and ''Dr. Acula''. With Lugosi in his Dracula cape, Wood shot impromptu test footage, with no storyline in mind, in front of [[Tor Johnson]]'s home, a suburban graveyard, and in front of Lugosi's apartment building on Carlton Way. This footage ended up in ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959), which was mostly filmed after Lugosi died.

He had to leave the country after [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|the failed Hungarian Communist Revolution of 1919]] because of his socialist activism. He acted in several films in [[Weimar Germany]] before arriving in the United States as a seaman on a merchant ship.\n\nIn 1927, he appeared as Count Dracula in a Broadway adaptation of [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[Dracula|novel]]. He later appeared in the 1931 film ''Dracula'' directed by [[Tod Browning]] and produced by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]. Through the 1930s, he occupied an important niche in horror films, with their East European setting, but his Hungarian accent limited his potential casting, and he unsuccessfully tried to avoid [[typecasting]].\n\nMeanwhile, he was often paired with [[Boris Karloff]], who was able to demand top billing. To his frustration, Lugosi, a charter member of the American [[Screen Actors Guild]], was increasingly restricted to minor parts, kept employed by the studio principally so that they could put his name on the posters. Among his pairings with Karloff, he performed major roles only in ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1934), ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]'' (1935), and ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939); even in ''The Raven'', Karloff received top billing despite Lugosi performing the lead role. By this time, Lugosi had been receiving regular medication for [[sciatica|sciatic neuritis]], and he became addicted to [[morphine]] and [[methadone]]. This drug dependence was known to producers, and the offers eventually dwindled to a few parts in [[Ed Wood]]'s low-budget films\u2014including a brief appearance in ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959). Lugosi was married five times and had one son, [[Bela G. Lugosi|Bela George]].

His accent, while a part of his image, limited the roles he could play.\n\nLugosi did attempt to break type by auditioning for other roles. He lost out to [[Lionel Barrymore]] for the role of [[Grigori Rasputin]] in ''[[Rasputin and the Empress]]'' (also 1932); [[C.

Despite the relative size of their roles, Lugosi inevitably received second billing, below Karloff. There are contradictory reports of Lugosi's attitude toward Karloff, some claiming that he was openly resentful of Karloff's long-term success and ability to gain good roles beyond the horror arena, while others suggested the two actors were \u2014 for a time, at least \u2014 good friends. Karloff himself in interviews suggested that Lugosi was initially mistrustful of him when they acted together, believing that the Englishman would attempt to upstage him. When this proved not to be the case, according to Karloff, Lugosi settled down and they worked together amicably (though some have further commented that the English Karloff's on-set demand to break from filming for mid-afternoon tea annoyed Lugosi).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mank |first1=Gregory William |title=Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff : the expanded story of a haunting collaboration, with a complete filmography of their films together |date=2009 |publisher=McFarland & Co., Publishers |location=Jefferson, N.C. |isbn=978-0786434800 |pages=237\u2013238}}</ref> Karloff also insinuated that his rival could not act, claiming Lugosi had \"never learned his trade\". A small percentage of critics cited his \"dull and slow performance\" in ''Dracula'' as a great example of minimal dialogue with no real acting prowess needed. Lugosi did get a few heroic leads, as in Universal's ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' after Karloff had been accorded the more colorful role of the villain, ''[[The Invisible Ray (1936 film)|The Invisible Ray]]'', and a romantic role in producer [[Sol Lesser]]'s adventure serial ''[[The Return of Chandu]]'' (1934), but his typecasting problem appears to have been too entrenched to be alleviated by those films.\n[[File:B\u00e9la Lugosi-Angelo Rossitto in Scared to Death.jpg|thumb|With [[Angelo Rossitto]] in ''[[Scared to Death]]'' (1947)]]\nLugosi addressed his plea to be cast in non-horror roles directly to casting directors through his listing in the 1937 ''Players Directory'', published by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], in which he (or his agent) calls the idea that he is only fit for horror films \"an error.\"<ref>Michael Mallory.

Universal changed management in 1936, and because of a British ban on horror films, dropped them from their production schedule; Lugosi found himself consigned to Universal's non-horror [[B-movie|B-film]] unit, at times in small roles where he was obviously used for \"name value\" only. Throughout the 1930s, Lugosi, experiencing a severe career decline despite popularity with audiences (Universal executives always preferred his rival Karloff), accepted many leading roles from independent producers like [[Nat Levine]], [[Sol Lesser]], and [[Sam Katzman]]. These low-budget thrillers indicate that Lugosi was less discriminating than Karloff in selecting screen vehicles, but the exposure helped Lugosi financially if not artistically. Lugosi tried to keep busy with stage work, but had to borrow money from the [[Actors Fund of America]] to pay hospital bills when his only child, Bela George Lugosi, was born in 1938.\n\nHistorian John McElwee reports, in his 2013 book ''Showmen, Sell It Hot!'', that Bela Lugosi's popularity received a much-needed boost in August 1938, when California theater owner Emil Umann revived ''Dracula'' and ''Frankenstein'' as a special double feature. The combination was so successful that Umann scheduled extra shows to accommodate the capacity crowds, and invited Lugosi to appear in person, which thrilled new audiences that had never seen Lugosi's classic performance. \"I owe it all to that little man at the Regina Theatre,\" said Lugosi of exhibitor Umann. \"I was dead, and he brought me back to life.\" Universal took notice of the tremendous business and launched its own national re-release of the same two horror favorites. The studio then rehired Lugosi to star in new films.\n\nThe first was Universal's ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939), when he played the character role of Ygor, a mad blacksmith with a broken neck, in heavy makeup and beard. The same year saw Lugosi making a rare appearance in an A-list motion picture: he was a stern commissar in [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s romantic comedy ''[[Ninotchka]]'', starring [[Greta Garbo]] and directed by [[Ernst Lubitsch]]. Lugosi was effective in this small but prestigious character role, and it could have been a turning point for the actor, but within the year, he was back on Hollywood's Poverty Row, playing leads for Sam Katzman. These horror, comedy and [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] B-films were released by [[Monogram Pictures]]. At Universal, he often received star billing for what amounted to a supporting part. ''[[The Gorilla (1939 film)|The Gorilla]]'' (1939) had him playing straight man to [[Patsy Kelly]] and the [[Ritz Brothers]].\n[[File:Invisible Ghost (1941) 1.jpg|thumb|left|Lugosi (center) with [[Polly Ann Young]] and [[Clarence Muse]] in ''[[The Invisible Ghost]]'' (1941)]]\n\nOstensibly due to injuries received during military service, Lugosi developed severe, chronic [[sciatica]]. Though at first he was treated with pain remedies such as [[asparagus]] juice, doctors increased the medication to [[opiate]]s. The growth of his dependence on [[analgesic]] drugs, particularly [[morphine]] and, after 1947 when it became available in America, [[methadone]], was directly proportional to the dwindling of screen offers. He was finally cast in the role of [[Frankenstein's monster]] for Universal's ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' (1943), but Lugosi had no dialogue. Lugosi's voice had been dubbed over that of [[Lon Chaney Jr.]], from line readings at the end of ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942).<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bela-Lugosi |title=Bela Lugosi {{!}} Hungarian-American actor|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en}}</ref> Lugosi played Dracula for a second and last time on film in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948).\n\n''Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein'' was Bela Lugosi's last \"A\" movie. For the remainder of his life he appeared \u2014 less and less frequently \u2014 in obscure, low-budget features. From 1947 to 1950, he performed in [[summer stock]], often in productions of ''Dracula'' or ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'', and during the other parts of the year made personal appearances in a touring \"spook show\", and on early commercial television.\n\nIn September 1949 [[Milton Berle]] invited Lugosi to appear in a sketch on ''[[Texaco Star Theatre]]''.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/9-27-1949/episode/670241/summary.htmlTexaco Star Theater Episode Guide], tv.com; accessed 1 November 2015.</ref> Lugosi memorized the script for the skit, but became confused on the air when Berle began to ad lib.<ref>{{cite book |last=Weaver |first=Tom |title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Film Flashbacks: Conversations with 24 Actors, Writers, Producers and Directors from the Golden Age |publisher=McFarland |year=2004 |page=160 |isbn=0-7864-2070-7}}</ref> His only television dramatic role was on the anthology series ''[[Suspense (U.S. TV series)|Suspense]]'' on October 11, 1949, in an adaptation of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[The Cask of Amontillado]]''.<ref>''The Complete Actors' Television Credits, 1948\u20131988, James Robert Parrish and Vincent Terrace''<!--publishing info, ISSN/ISBN, year needed--></ref>\n\nIn 1951, while in [[England]] to play a six-month tour of ''Dracula'', Lugosi co-starred in a [[Low culture|lowbrow]] film comedy, ''[[Mother Riley Meets the Vampire]]'' (also known as ''Vampire over London'' and ''My Son, the Vampire''), released the following year. Following his return to the United States, he was interviewed for television, and reflected wistfully on his typecasting in horror parts: \"Now I am the [[Bogeyman|boogie man]]\". In the same interview he expressed a desire to play more comedy, as he had in the ''Mother Riley'' [[farce]]. Independent producer Jack Broder took Lugosi at his word, casting him in a jungle-themed comedy, ''[[Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla]]'' (1952), co-starring nightclub comedians [[Duke Mitchell]] and [[Sammy Petrillo]], whose act closely resembled that of [[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]].\n\n===Stage and personal appearances===\nLugosi enjoyed a lively career on stage. with plenty of personal appearances. As film offers declined, he became more and more dependent on live venues to support his family. Bela took over the role of Jonathan Brewster from Boris Karloff for ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]''. Bela had also expressed interest in playing Elwood P. Dowd in ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'' to help himself professionally.

During [[post-production]] of the latter, Lugosi decided to seek treatment for his [[drug addiction]], and the premiere of the film was said to be intended to help pay for his hospital expenses. According to [[Kitty Kelley]]'s biography of [[Frank Sinatra]], when the entertainer heard of Lugosi's problems, he helped with expenses and visited Lugosi at the hospital. Sinatra would recall Lugosi's amazement at his visit, since the two men had never met before.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kelley |first=Kitty |title=His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra |publisher=Bantam Books |year=1987 |page=[https://archive.org/details/hiswayunauthoriz00kell_0/page/248 248] |isbn=0-553-26515-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hiswayunauthoriz00kell_0/page/248 }}</ref>\n\nDuring an impromptu interview upon his exit from the treatment center in 1955, Lugosi stated that he was about to go to work on a new Ed Wood film, ''The Ghoul Goes West''. This was one of several projects proposed by Wood, including ''The Phantom Ghoul'' and ''Dr. Acula''. With Lugosi in his Dracula cape, Wood shot impromptu test footage, with no storyline in mind, in front of [[Tor Johnson]]'s home, a suburban graveyard, and in front of Lugosi's apartment building on Carlton Way. This footage ended up in ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959), which was mostly filmed after Lugosi died.
