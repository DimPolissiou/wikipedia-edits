The University of Chicago Press, 1937, p. 212.</ref>  The call letters assigned (sequentially, they had no meaning) were WIAO. Since December 1, 1921, radio stations had been assigned two wavelengths: 360 meters (833&nbsp;kHz) for \"broadcasting news, concerts and such matter\", and 485 meters (619&nbsp;kHz) for \"broadcasting crop reports and weather forecasts\". As such, WIAO was licensed to broadcast on a [[wavelength]] of 360 meters (833.3&nbsp;kHz). Although its license called for \"unlimited\" time at a power of 500 Watts, the fact that the three other Milwaukee stations: WAAK (Gimbel Brothers department store), WCAY (Kesselman O'Driscol Music Co.) and WHAD ([[Marquette University]]), were also licensed for the 360 meter band, meant that WIAO had to share time with them.\n\nAt 10:15&nbsp;a.m. on October 23 of that year, WIAO went on the air from the school's Marshall Street building with 100 watts of power, using a student-built transmitter.<ref>\"New Station to Be Opened for Radio Fans\". ''The Wisconsin News/The Milwaukee Telegram'', October 22, 1922, Part II, p. 2.</ref>  That power level was formalized on January 9, 1923 when a new license was issued.<ref name=\"Frost, p. 212\">Frost, p. 212.</ref>\n\nOn July 23, 1923, another new license was issued \u2014 this time solely to the School of Engineering \u2014 specifying a power level of 200 Watts. The power level was reduced to 100 watts on October 9.<ref name=\"Frost, p. 212\"/>\n\nIn January 1924, ''The Wisconsin News'', began programming the station on a part-time basis.<ref>\"Fight News to be Broadcast by Radio\". ''The Wisconsin News'', January 24, 1924, p. 6.</ref>  On May 31, 1924, the station was authorized to shift its frequency to 246 meters (1220&nbsp;kHz).<ref name=\"Frost, p. 212\"/>  The station did so at 5:30&nbsp;p.m. on Monday, June 9.<ref>\"Wave Length is Changed by WIAO\". ''The Wisconsin News & The Evening Sentinel'', June 9, 1924, p. 10.</ref>   On August 18 of that year, WIAO changed its call letters to WSOE.<ref>\"WIAO Changes to New Call Letters: WSOE to Designate Lake Front Station; More Power Added\". ''The Milwaukee Sentinel and Milwaukee Telegram'', August 17, 1924, Part I, p. 14.</ref>   On December 31, the school announced that it had purchased all of the equipment of WCBD in Zion, Illinois  (one of the first religious stations, which also preached \"[[flat earth]]\" information). The purchase included a new, more powerful (500 Watt) transmitter and twin towers, which were mounted atop the school's Oneida (now Wells) Street building.<ref>Grignon, Gaston, W., \"Close Big Deal for WCBD: School of Engineering Announces Purchase of Powerful Outfit\".

That year, the School of Engineering reorganized itself as a non-profit corporation, and changed its name to the [[Milwaukee School of Engineering]] (MSOE). It moved from the Oneida Street building after purchasing the German-English Academy on North Broadway Street. Hearst also owned the morning newspaper, ''The Milwaukee Sentinel'', and the WISN station offices and studios were relocated to its building on Michigan Avenue. The transmitter and tower were relocated to the top of the Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Co.'s Public Service Building, and the newspaper took over operational responsibility for WISN.\n\n===WSOE, WMSE===\n\nIn 1968, MSOE students signed on another station using the call letters '''WSOE''' (which were not officially assigned). This time, it was an unlicensed [[carrier current]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] station.  Transmitters were installed in each of the two dormitories, and carried via a low power wireless microphone type transmitter operating on 91.7&nbsp;MHz from the studio two blocks away.  Although intended as a \"studio-transmitter link\", the FM signal could be picked up on campus by anyone with an FM radio.  In July 1978, MSOE students applied for an FM construction permit for an educational station on 91.7&nbsp;MHz\u2014although the application was in the name of the school's board of regents. The school received a construction permit on December 12, 1979.\n\nThe call letters \"[[WSOE]]\" had been given to the newly formed college radio station at [[Elon University]] in 1977.  MSOE's very own 1000-watt [[FM broadcasting|FM]] station, '''WMSE''', applied for its license and officially began programming on March 17, 1981. Programming consisted of an eclectic mix of [[Freeform (radio format)|freeform]] programming from volunteer DJs. Most DJs have three-hour time slots, and program as they wish, mostly within their chosen formats.\n\nIn 1988-89 there was a brief period of controversy for the station as it banned the musical genre [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], arguably WMSE's most well-publicized late night programming. A small backlash was aided by local musician advocates, as well as record producer [[Eric Greif]], which included an organized advertising boycott which was covered by the Wisconsin media.<ref>a sample television news report about the controversy, from Milwaukee's Channel 6, is found in the external links below</ref>\n\nIn 1994, the station upgraded its equipment and increased its power to 3200 watts. In the late 1990s the station expanded its potential audience through its website, wmse.org, which supports live streaming audio as well as downloadable archives. In 1999, the university cut the station's funding, and it is now entirely listener and sponsor supported, with most money being raised by twice-yearly on-air fund drives.\n\nSince 2003, WMSE has released a series of CD compilations featuring performances recorded live in the station's studio.\n\n==Fund Raising Activities==\nUp until 1997, fund raising events were limited to underwriting from local businesses.  In exchange for financial support, businesses received mention on the air at the beginning and end of certain programming hours.  While on-air underwriting remains, in 1997 WMSE held it first on-air pledge drive and also introduced the Club Card for purchase which offered discounts at area business.\n\nAfter funding from the college was cut, WMSE became even more dependent on listener support. The station allots two weeks out of the year, one in the fall and one in the spring in which listeners can pledge. These pledge drive typically include numerous on-air live performances from both local and national artists. Though there are designated times for donation, WMSE accepts any donations at any time in the year.\n\nThey also hold an annual Rockabilly Chili Contest and a Food Slam Competition that many local businesses participate in.\n\nFor their 25th anniversary on March 17, 2006, they made available several limited edition prints of works donated by local artists for individuals who donated above a certain level.\n\n==Projects==\nIn 2004, WMSE launched the Milwaukee Sound Environment (M.S.E.) Project, a music resource for Milwaukee area artists and listeners. Established with a grant from the [[Milwaukee Arts Board]] and the [[Wisconsin Arts Board]],The M.S.E. Project web site includes music news, Mp3's from local artists, and FAQs for bands interested in getting their music heard on the station. The project also established a dedicated time-slot for live in-studio performances.\n\n==Schedule, Current Content==\nThe broadcast day is divided into eight three-hour programs for a total of 56 programs during a week. Like much of college radio, DJs are not required to play  song lists and a great deal of diversity exists between the 56 various shows.  With the exception of the Blues Drive (Weekdays from 3pm-6pm), timeslots are not content specific.

The University of Chicago Press, 1937, p. 212.</ref>  The call letters assigned (sequentially, they had no meaning) were WIAO. Since December 1, 1921, radio stations had been assigned two wavelengths: 360 meters (833&nbsp;kHz) for \"broadcasting news, concerts and such matter\", and 485 meters (619&nbsp;kHz) for \"broadcasting crop reports and weather forecasts\". As such, WIAO was licensed to broadcast on a [[wavelength]] of 360 meters (833.3&nbsp;kHz). Although its license called for \"unlimited\" time at a power of 500 Watts, the fact that the three other Milwaukee stations: WAAK (Gimbel Brothers department store), WCAY (Kesselman O'Driscol Music Co.) and WHAD ([[Marquette University]]), were also licensed for the 360 meter band, meant that WIAO had to share time with them.\n\nAt 10:15&nbsp;a.m. on October 23 of that year, WIAO went on the air from the school's Marshall Street building with 100 watts of power, using a student-built transmitter.<ref>\"New Station to Be Opened for Radio Fans\".

Once a week, there is a six-hour block of talk radio, featuring shows and discussions about professional wrestling, politics, sports, and trivia.  Wrestling radio show \"Monday Night Mayhem\" originated on WBNY and after moving to an internet-only broadcast in December 2004, continued to be popular.\n\nThe station has been entirely student run since its inception in 1982. Carrier-current predecessor WSCB General Manager Michael Lesser and Program Director Scott Michaeloff were the directors of the WBNY effort, along with staff such as Tom Connolly. Lesser, who was also a VP of the Student Government, embraced the vision of Connolly and others, successfully petitioning the FCC and secured funding from the United Students Government (USG) to create WBNY. The DJ lounge, WBNY's \"Lesser Lounge\", was named in honor of the founding GM.\n\nLesser elected not to run for General Manager for a third term, and new GM Bob DeAmbra won election through popular vote. DeAmbra and Program Manager Tom Calderone nurtured an alternative format that became nationally recognized{{by whom|date=June 2014}}. DeAmbra's successor, Karen Szczuka was the first woman to become General Manager of WBNY Radio Station. Szczuka had previously held the title of Underwriting Director and was the first woman on the stations Board of Directors. Szczuka went on to work for Archie Comic Publications, Inc. as an Executive Assistant to the Chairman in charge of International Publishing, Copyrighting, Head of Permissions to use the Archie likeness in print and media and wrote several free lance stories for Archie, Betty & Veronica, Betty and the Jughead comic book titles. Calderone became a Senior Executive at [[MTV]]. DeAmbra (American Express) and Lesser (Healthcare Marketing) went on to marketing careers. John Rosso became a senior executive with ABC, then Citadel and now Triton Digital. Engineer Nick Rozanov was General Manager, US of Radio 7 in Moscow, Russia and then moved into telecom. Scott Michaeloff is Senior Vice President and Executive Producer of Synaptic Digital. Many DJs, including Tom Connolly, Rick Walters and Dave McKinley, can be heard regularly on radio and TV in the Buffalo, New York area.\n\nIn the spirit of predecessor WSCB, local bands, regardless of status or talent, were invited to appear on programs like \"Down at Lulu's.\" The station also began bringing in relatively unknown national acts like R.E.M., The Cure, and The Replacements, and then-breakout act [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] for local performances. Some WBNY staffers launched their own bands, among them Tina Peel's \"Intergalactic Burnt Toast,\" Jeff Hastings' \"The ShAnkHeAds,\" Kevin Walsh's \"Leper Gumbies,\" and Jacob Frasier and Anthony Puglisi's \"Animal Magnetism.\"\n\n*The [[WSCB]] callsign is now licensed to the FM station of [[Springfield College]] in [[Springfield, MA|Springfield]], [[Massachusetts]]\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[David Blaustein]] - Entertainment Correspondent, [[ABC News Radio]]\n* [[Howard Simon]]    - Sports Anchor WGR, Buffalo, New York\n* [[Byron Brown]] - Mayor of Buffalo, New York\n* Tom Calderone - President of VH1\n* Lisa Flynn - former news anchor for WIVB-TV Channel 4 in Buffalo, New York\n* Mylous Hairston - former news anchor for WIVB-TV Channel 4 in Buffalo, New York\n* [[Keith White Jr.]] - Children's book author\n* [[Frank Stasio]] - Host, The State of Things, WUNC\n* Lars Lewis - Play-By-Play Broadcaster, Time Warner Cable Sports\n* Kory Reid and Richard Cumpston Jr. - Co-hosts of The Sports Monarchy\n* Joe DiBiase- Sports Anchor WGR, Buffalo, New York \n* Louie DiBiase- Sports Anchor WGR, Buffalo, New York\n* Chris Owen- On-Air Talent WYRK, Buffalo, New York\n* Brayton Wilson- Sports Anchor WGR, Buffalo, New York \n* Nicholas Lippa- Reporter WBFO, Buffalo, New York\n* Derek Kramer- Sports Anchor WGR, Buffalo, New York\n*Chris Gullo- Professional Wrestling Ring Announcer for Empire State Wrestling, Ring Announcer for MMA and Kickboxing and stand up comedian\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://wbny.buffalostate.edu WBNY Web site]\n* [http://www.wbnyalumni.com/ WBNY Alumni Organization]\n* [http://bscvs01.buffalostate.edu/wbny WBNY Live WMA Stream]\n* [http://www.myspace.com/wbny WBNY MySpace Profile]\n{{FM station data|WBNY}}\n\n{{Buffalo Radio}}\n\n{{coord|42.933|N|78.883|W|type:landmark_region:US_source:FCC|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Radio stations in Buffalo, New York|BNY]]\n[[Category:College radio stations in New York (state)|BNY]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1985]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=June 2014}}\n{{Infobox Radio Station\n| name      = WBNY\n| image = WBNYlogo.png\n| image_size = 230px\n| airdate   = [[1982 in radio|1982]]\n| frequency = 91.3 [[megahertz|MHz]]\n| area      = [[Buffalo, New York]]\n| format    = [[Campus radio]]\n| class     = A\n| erp       = 1,150 [[watt]]s (horizontal)<br>1,040 watts (vertical)\n| haat    = 34 meters\n| owner     = [[Buffalo State College]]\n| branding  = ''\"91.3 WBNY\"''\n| slogan    = ''Buffalo's Original Alternative since 1982''\n| website   = [http://wbny.buffalostate.edu/ wbny.buffalostate.edu]\n| webcast   = [http://bscvs01.buffalostate.edu/wbny WMA Live Stream]\n| callsign_meaning = '''W''' '''B'''uffalo '''N'''ew '''Y'''ork\n}}\n[[Image:Djs wbny2005.jpg|thumb|300px|2005-2006 DJ's of WBNY in the Checkerboard Lounge]]\n\n'''WBNY''' is the college radio station of [[Buffalo State College]], located within the city of [[Buffalo, New York]].

Wrestling radio show \"Monday Night Mayhem\" originated on WBNY and after moving to an internet-only broadcast in December 2004, continued to be popular.\n\nThe station has been entirely student run since its inception in 1982. Carrier-current predecessor WSCB General Manager Michael Lesser and Program Director Scott Michaeloff were the directors of the WBNY effort, along with staff such as Tom Connolly. Lesser, who was also a VP of the Student Government, embraced the vision of Connolly and others, successfully petitioning the FCC and secured funding from the United Students Government (USG) to create WBNY. The DJ lounge, WBNY's \"Lesser Lounge\", was named in honor of the founding GM.\n\nLesser elected not to run for General Manager for a third term, and new GM Bob DeAmbra won election through popular vote. DeAmbra and Program Manager Tom Calderone nurtured an alternative format that became nationally recognized{{by whom|date=June 2014}}. DeAmbra's successor, Karen Szczuka was the first woman to become General Manager of WBNY Radio Station. Szczuka had previously held the title of Underwriting Director and was the first woman on the stations Board of Directors. Szczuka went on to work for Archie Comic Publications, Inc. as an Executive Assistant to the Chairman in charge of International Publishing, Copyrighting, Head of Permissions to use the Archie likeness in print and media and wrote several free lance stories for Archie, Betty & Veronica, Betty and the Jughead comic book titles. Calderone became a Senior Executive at [[MTV]]. DeAmbra (American Express) and Lesser (Healthcare Marketing) went on to marketing careers. John Rosso became a senior executive with ABC, then Citadel and now Triton Digital. Engineer Nick Rozanov was General Manager, US of Radio 7 in Moscow, Russia and then moved into telecom. Scott Michaeloff is Senior Vice President and Executive Producer of Synaptic Digital. Many DJ's, including Tom Connolly, Rick Walters and Dave McKinley, can be heard regularly on radio and TV in the Buffalo, New York area.\n\nIn the spirit of predecessor WSCB, local bands, regardless of status or talent, were invited to appear on programs like \"Down at Lulu's.\" The station also began bringing in relatively unknown national acts like R.E.M., The Cure, and The Replacements, and then-breakout act [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] for local performances. Some WBNY staffers launched their own bands, among them Tina Peel's \"Intergalactic Burnt Toast,\" Jeff Hastings' \"The ShAnkHeAds,\" Kevin Walsh's \"Leper Gumbies,\" and Jacob Frasier and Anthony Puglisi's \"Animal Magnetism.\"\n\n*The [[WSCB]] callsign is now licensed to the FM station of [[Springfield College]] in [[Springfield, MA|Springfield]], [[Massachusetts]]\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[David Blaustein]] - Entertainment Correspondent, [[ABC News Radio]]\n* [[Howard Simon]]    - Sports Anchor WGR, Buffalo, New York\n* [[Byron Brown]] - Mayor of Buffalo, New York\n* Tom Calderone - President of VH1\n* Lisa Flynn - former news anchor for WIVB-TV Channel 4 in Buffalo, New York\n* Mylous Hairston - former news anchor for WIVB-TV Channel 4 in Buffalo, New York\n* [[Keith White Jr.]] - Children's book author\n* [[Frank Stasio]] - Host, The State of Things, WUNC\n* Lars Lewis - Play-By-Play Broadcaster, Time Warner Cable Sports\n* Kory Reid and Richard Cumpston Jr. - Co-hosts of The Sports Monarchy\n* Joe DiBiase- Sports Anchor WGR, Buffalo, New York \n* Louie DiBiase- Sports Anchor WGR, Buffalo, New York\n* Chris Owen- On-Air Talent WYRK, Buffalo, New York\n* Brayton Wilson- Sports Anchor WGR, Buffalo, New York \n* Nicholas Lippa- Reporter WBFO, Buffalo, New York\n* Derek Kramer- Sports Anchor WGR, Buffalo, New York\n*Chris Gullo- Professional Wrestling Ring Announcer for Empire State Wrestling, Ring Announcer for MMA and Kickboxing and stand up comedian\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://wbny.buffalostate.edu WBNY Web site]\n* [http://www.wbnyalumni.com/ WBNY Alumni Organization]\n* [http://bscvs01.buffalostate.edu/wbny WBNY Live WMA Stream]\n* [http://www.myspace.com/wbny WBNY MySpace Profile]\n{{FM station data|WBNY}}\n\n{{Buffalo Radio}}\n\n{{coord|42.933|N|78.883|W|type:landmark_region:US_source:FCC|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Radio stations in Buffalo, New York|BNY]]\n[[Category:College radio stations in New York (state)|BNY]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1985]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBNY"}

Though the group never reached a decision on the killing, one of the prisoners decided it was time to take action. According to the prosecution, Officer Robert Vallandingham, who had been taken hostage, was handcuffed and strangled with a dumbbell from the prison weight room. However, testimony by Dr. Richard Fardal, [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]] Deputy [[Coroner]], disputed the claim that Officer Vallandingham was killed by a weight, saying that there was \"no injury to the voice box or the trachea\" and that \"Mr. Vallandingham died solely and exclusively as a result of ligature strangulation.\" Testimonies vary as to which prisoner was responsible for his murder.<ref name=\"Pfeifer\">[[Paul Pfeifer|Pfeifer, Paul]].

The main causes were serious overcrowding and mismanagement of the facility and [[Islam|Muslim]] frustration stemming from mandated [[tuberculosis]] testing.<ref name=\"Pfeifer\"/> In the Netflix documentary series ''[[Captive (2016 TV series)|Captive]]'', inmate Siddique Abdullah Hasan (Carlos Sanders) claims that Muslim prisoners refused the test because it contained [[phenol]], and therefore went against Islamic restrictions concerning the handling and consumption of alcohol.

Though the group never reached a decision on the killing, one of the prisoners decided it was time to take action. According to the prosecution, Officer Robert Vallandingham, who had been taken hostage, was handcuffed and strangled with a dumbbell from the prison weight room. However, testimony by Dr. Richard Fardal, [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]] Deputy [[Coroner]], disputed the claim that Officer Vallandingham was killed by a weight, saying that there was \"no injury to the voice box or the trachea\" and that \"Mr. Vallandingham died solely and exclusively as a result of ligature strangulation.\" Testimonies vary as to which prisoner was responsible for his murder.<ref name=\"Pfeifer\">[[Paul Pfeifer|Pfeifer, Paul]].
