It lacks international recognition but is symbolically important to Argentina for consolidating the country's national unity behind the concept of ''Argentina Grande'', an area that extends out to include the [[Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina|British South Atlantic islands and  a section of the Antarctic continent]].<ref name=\"Morris, 1989\">{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Michael A. |title=The Strait of Magellan |date=1989 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=9780792301813 |pages=159 |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=OS-3VdihoooC&pg=PA50&dq=The+Strait+of+Magellan&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjDo_ujkt_kAhXEjOYKHfuPB48Q6AEIQTAE#v=onepage&q=The%20Strait%20of%20Magellan&f=false |accessdate=20 September 2019}}</ref>  \n\n==Geography==\nThe Argentine Sea is in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] off the southeastern coast of Argentina, extending from the approximate latitude of [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, southward to [[Tierra del Fuego]], and is situated about {{cvt|500|mi|-2}} north of [[Antarctica]]. The Argentine Sea has a surface area of {{cvt|1000000|km2}}<ref name=\"red\">{{cite web|url=http://www.redargentina.com/mipais/regiones/mar/ |title=Mar Argentino |trans-title=Argentine Sea |language=Spanish |publisher=Red Argentina |accessdate=June 10, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004233052/http://www.redargentina.com/mipais/regiones/mar/ |archivedate=October 4, 2012 }}</ref> and is one of the largest seas in the world. The average depth of the sea is {{cvt|3952|ft|m|order=flip}} and the maximum depth is {{cvt|7296|ft|m|order=flip}}. It has a salinity of 3.5%.<ref name=\"red\"/>\n\nThe Argentine Sea progressively widens going southward, in contrast to the narrowing of the continental mass.<ref name=\"red\"/> The sea platform has a series of plateaux which descend to the east as large terraces or steps. Because of its stair-shaped plateaux, the Argentine Sea is similar morphologically to the Extra-[[Andes|Andean]] [[Patagonia]]. The [[Falkland Islands]] are also located within the continental shelf of the Argentine Sea.\n\n===Territorial claims===\nAccording to the law 23968,{{clarify|date=September 2019}} the [[territorial waters]] of Argentina extend {{convert|12|nmi|km mi}} from the line from the gulfs of San Mat\u00edas and San Jorge to the outer limits of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata|River Plate]]. The contiguous zone extends 12 nautical miles after the territorial waters, and the [[exclusive economic zone]] {{convert|200|nmi|km mi}} from it. The continental shelf extends to either the limits of the exclusive economic zone or the shelf slope. Argentina has signed and ratified the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]].\n\nThe exclusive economic zone claimed by Argentina overlap with claims maintained by the [[United Kingdom]] on behalf of the [[Falkland Islands]] and similar claims around [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].

Julie Scott Meisami places Bayhaqi among the historians of the [[Islamic Golden Age]].<ref>''Truths and Lies: Irony and Intrigue in the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i Bayhaq\u012b'', Soheila Amirsoleimani, 244-245.</ref>\n\n== Life ==\n===Youth and early career===\nBayhaqi was born in the village of [[Haresabad, Razavi Khorasan|Harethabad]] in [[Sabzevar|Bayhaq]] in the [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan Province]], then under the rule of the declining [[Samanid Empire|Samanid emirate]]; in 998, the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid]] ruler [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] (r. 998-1030) declared independence from the Samanids, and eventually divided the Samanid state with the [[Karakhanids]], ending the Samanid dynasty.{{sfn|Bosworth|2012}} In his youth Bayhaqi studied in the major cultural center of [[Nishapur]], and later in 1020/1 joined the secretariat (''d\u012bv\u0101n-e res\u0101lat'') of Mahmud, where he worked as an assistant and pupil under the chief secretary [[Abu Nasr Mushkan]] for 19 years.{{sfn|Yusofi|1988|pp=889-894}}\n\nAfter Mushkan's death in 1039/40, [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni|Mas'ud I]] (r. 1030\u20131040) appointed Bayhaqi as minister to [[Abu Sahl Zawzani]], who had succeeded Muskhan as the chief secretary of the empire. Muskhan substantially urged the Sultan that Bayhaqi should be his successor, and the Persian ''[[vizier]]'' [[Ahmad Shirazi]] had also commended Bayhaqi in the Sultan's attendance. Bayhaqi (who was at that time 46 years old) was supposedly told by Mas'ud I that he was too young to be appointed the new chief secretary.{{sfn|Yusofi|1988|pp=889-894}}\n\n===Later career===\nZawzani was not as accomplished in the management of the secretariat as his predecessor had been, and his methods were completely dissimilar. Furthermore, Bayhaqi was often a victim of his bad temper, which made the latter send a secret letter of relinquishment of his responsibility to the Sultan, who, however, heartened Bayhaqi to continue serving in his post, whilst ordering his ''vizier'' to inform that Zawzani should behave properly towards Bayhaqi at the secretariat.{{sfn|Yusofi|1988|pp=889-894}} This he did, however; Mas'ud I died shortly afterwards being deserted by his army after a [[Battle of Dandanaqan|disastrous defeat]] against the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuq Turks]], who then conquered Khorasan. Mas'ud's death made Zawzani resume his bad treatment of Bayhaqi once more. Bayhaqi experienced several problems after Mas'ud I's death, probably partly due to his own failings, which he himself often recognizes.{{sfn|Yusofi|1988|pp=889-894}}\n\nDuring the reign of [[Abd al-Rashid of Ghazna|Abd al-Rashid]] (r. 1049-1052) Bayhaqi was finally selected as the chief secretary. He was, however, after a short period removed from the post. According to [[Ibn Funduq]], he was jailed by the judge (''q\u0101\u017c\u012b'') of [[Ghazni]] on the complaint of having failed to meet the unpaid obligatory fee to a wife, but according to [[Muhammad Aufi|Aufi]], the reason behind his imprisonment was due to the ploys of his enemies. A slave named Tuman (or Nuyan) was afterwards ordered by the Sultan to seize Bayhaqi's possessions.{{sfn|Yusofi|1988|pp=889-894}}\n\nIn 1052, the rebellious slave-soldier (''[[Ghilman|ghulam]]'') [[Toghrul of Ghazna|Toghrul]] seized Ghazni, had Abd al-Rashid killed, and had the sultan's men jailed in a stronghold, where Bayhaqi was also moved. However, Toghrul's reign lasted only 15 days; he was defeated and killed by Ghaznavid loyalists, who put [[Farrukh-Zad of Ghazna|Farrukh-zad]] (r. 1053\u20131059) on the throne. Bayhaqi was then released from imprisonment.{{sfn|Yusofi|1988|pp=889-894}}\n\n===The writing of ''Tarikh-i Bayhaqi'' and death===\n[[File:Farrukh-Zad.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Coin of Sultan [[Farrukh-Zad of Ghazna|Farrukh-zad]] (r. 1053-1059).]]\nAccording to Ibn Funduq, Bayhaqi served as secretary under Farrukh-zad and at the end of the latter's reign withdrew from bureaucratic life and settled in Ghazni, where he started to write the ''[[Tarikh-i Bayhaqi]]''. However, judging from Bayhaqi's few comments in his book on Farrukh-zad's rule, it appears that he did not take part in Farrukh-zad's court. Indeed, he evidently reports that during those years he was occupied on writing his history.\n\nAccording to the ''A\u1e35b\u0101r al-dawla al-salj\u016bq\u012bya'' (Chronicles of the Seljuq state), Bayhaqi formulated the peace treaty between the Seljuqs and Ghaznavids in 1058.{{sfn|Bosworth|1995|p=49}} He accordingly may have been called back to work after his dishonor and imprisonment during the rule of Abd al-Rashid. Anyhow the information of the ''Tarikh-i Bayhaqi'' evidently show that Bayhaqi in his old age, until his death in 1077, had committed himself completely to the writing of the book.{{sfn|Yusofi|1988|pp=889-894}} His tomb is located in his birthplace, Harethabad.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite encyclopedia | last = Bosworth | first  = C.

Thunderstrock is a [[DIY ethic | Do-It-Yourself (DIY)]] concert and its idea is to support and encourage the live bands and [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] music lovers of [[Ranchi]] and the state of [[Jharkhand]] in [[India]]. Simultaneously, the idea is to donate the income generated from the sale of tickets to groups (or [[Non-governmental organization | NGOs]]) working for the welfare of society.\n \n==Beginning in 2008==\nThe idea of Thunderstrock emerged back in the year 2008, the idea was to generate funds for Jharkhand Rock Music Association (JRMA) so that JRMA could further plan concerts for rock bands of Ranchi. The initiative was further taken up by band members from Kaalmantra, Genesis and Sonu Chhetry from the band Sparsh, which were the prominent bands of that time. The first season of Thunderstrock was held in August 2008 at [[Ashok Group | Hotel Ashok]] in Ranchi. As the initiators for the concept of Thunderstrock, Kaalmantra and Genesis took up the stage that year. These bands were already famous with the rock music lovers of Ranchi, hence the footfall for the concert was immense and the show managed to fetch around Rs. 25,000 (around $580, according to exchange rates for 2008) which was later donated to JRMA by Mr. K.C. Shashidhar, the Chief General Manager of NABARD ([[National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development]]).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This season featured three bands namely Hypnotize, Kaos and none other than Sparsh which was the leading rock band of Ranchi back then. The show was a huge success and again it collected Rs. 25,000 ($543, according to the exchange rates of 2010) and a donation was made to [[Yuwa-India]] after the show.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This really affected the footfall of the audience in the festival especially in a city like Ranchi which is a small city and has not much of people listening to rock and metal music. Also, the initiators of the festival got jobs and moved on leaving the festival for a complete break of four years. The gap was witnessed with the rise of other [[DIY ethic | Do-It-Yourself (DIY)]] festivals in the city which followed the same momentum in which this festival was started. But the future of this festival was in no one's hand.\n\n==Start after a gap in 2014 and complete silence till 2017== \nThe fourth season happened on 7th September 2014 and from here on, [[Highway 69 (band) | Highway 69's]] vocalist Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of organizing this festival. For the first time, it was organized in an open-air festival style which experienced a footfall of around 2500. The season featured bands like Death Note (present-day Reciprocal), Destiny (present-day Iris 13), Virus, Error 404, [[Highway 69 (band) | Highway 69]], Genesis and the leading rock band of [[Darjeeling]] named Head Motif. The donations of that year went to Harmu Football Academy. \n\nHaving organized this festival on such a large scale for the first time, the next season in 2015 could not be conducted as there was a shortage of funds as the festival has got no backing from sponsors which is the major barrier to organizing this festival annually. This one year gap in 2015 led to the failure of organizing this festival in 2016 and 2017 as well.

Described as \"the godfather of the modern conservative, austerity movement\",<ref name=\"battling\" /> he supported [[term limit]]s, [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]] and the [[capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]]<ref name=\"Romano\" /> and opposed [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] and [[embryonic stem cell research]].<ref name=\"rock\" /><ref name=\"salon\" /> Democrats have referred to him as \"Dr. No\" for his use of technicalities to block federal spending bills.<ref name=\"Dr. No\" /><ref name=\"mcfadden\" />\n\nAfter leaving Congress, Coburn worked with the [[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]] on its efforts to reform the [[Food and Drug Administration]],<ref name=\"Cunningham\" /> becoming a senior fellow of the institute in December 2016.<ref name=\"MI\" /> Coburn also served as a senior advisor to [[Citizens for Self-Governance]], where he was active in calling for a [[convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution]].<ref name=\"MrphK\" /><ref name=\"I5B34\" /><ref name=\"PdFlb\" />\n\n==Early life, education, and medical career==\nCoburn was born in [[Casper, Wyoming]], the son of Anita Joy (n\u00e9e Allen) and Orin Wesley Coburn.<ref name=\"coburn\" /> Coburn's father was an [[optician]] and founder of Coburn Optical Industries, and a named donor to [[O. W. Coburn School of Law]] at [[Oral Roberts University]].<ref name=\"abundant\" />\n\nCoburn graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in accounting from [[Oklahoma State University]],<ref name=\":0\" /> where he was also a member of [[Sigma Nu]] fraternity. In 1968, he married Carolyn Denton,<ref name=\":0\" /> the 1967 [[Miss Oklahoma]];<ref name=\"wicqT\" /> their three daughters are Callie,<ref name=\"Wj4AR\" /> Katie and [[Sarah Coburn|Sarah]], a leading operatic [[soprano]].<ref name=\"drzGw\" /> One of the top ten seniors in the School of Business, Coburn served as president of the College of Business Student Council.<ref name=\"okstate\" />\n\nFrom 1970 to 1978, Coburn served as a manufacturing manager at the Ophthalmic Division of Coburn Optical Industries in [[Colonial Heights, Virginia]]. While Coburn was manager, the Virginia division of Coburn Optical grew from 13 employees to over 350 and captured 35 percent of the U.S. market.<ref name=\"okstate\" />\n\nAfter recovering from an occurrence of malignant [[melanoma]], Coburn pursued a medical degree and graduated from the [[University of Oklahoma College of Medicine|University of Oklahoma Medical School]] with honors in 1983.<ref name=\":0\" /> He then opened Maternal & Family Practice in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]], and served as a deacon in a [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist Church]]. During his career in [[obstetrics]], he treated over 15,000 patients, delivered 4,000 babies and was subject to one [[malpractice]] lawsuit, which was dismissed without finding Coburn at fault.<ref name=\"legislation\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Together Coburn and his wife were members of First Baptist Church of Muskogee.<ref name=\": United States Senator Tom Coburn :: About Senator Coburn :\" />\n\n===Sterilization controversy===\nA [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] Coburn performed on a 20-year-old woman, Angela Plummer, in 1990, became what was called \"the most incendiary issue\" of his Senate campaign.<ref name=\"american\" /> Coburn performed the sterilization on the woman during an emergency surgery to treat a life-threatening [[ectopic pregnancy]], removing her healthy intact [[fallopian tube]] as well as the one damaged by the surgery. The woman sued Coburn, alleging that he did not have consent to sterilize her, while Coburn claimed he had her oral consent. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed with no finding of liability on Coburn's part.<ref name=\"washington\" />\n\nThe state attorney general claimed that Coburn committed [[Medicaid]] [[fraud]] by not reporting the sterilization when he filed a claim for the emergency surgery. Medicaid did not reimburse doctors for sterilization procedures for patients under 21 and according to the attorney general, Coburn would not have been reimbursed at all had he disclosed this information. Coburn says since he did not file a claim for the sterilization, no fraud was committed. No charges were filed against Coburn for this claim.<ref name=\"salon\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref name=\"Coburn Badgered With Dismissed Suit\" /><ref name=\"conservative\" />\n\n==Political career==\n===House career===\nIn 1994, Coburn ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in [[Oklahoma's 2nd congressional district]], which was based in Muskogee and included 22 counties in northeastern Oklahoma. Coburn initially expected to face eight-term incumbent [[Mike Synar]]. However, Synar was defeated in a runoff for the Democratic nomination by a 71-year-old retired [[principal (school)|principal]], Virgil Cooper. According to Coburn's 2003 book, ''Breach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into Insiders'', Coburn and Cooper got along well, since both were opposed to the more liberal Synar. The general election was cordial since both men knew that Synar would not return to Washington regardless of the outcome. Coburn won by a 52%\u201348% margin, becoming the first Republican to represent the district since 1921.<ref name=\"ohc\" />\n\nCoburn was one of the most [[conservatism|conservative]] members of the House. He supported \"reducing the size of the [[Federal budget (United States)|federal budget]],\" wanted to make [[abortion]] illegal and supported the proposed television [[V-chip]] legislation.<ref name=\"JnuFs\" />\n\nDespite representing a heavily Democratic district and President [[Bill Clinton]]'s electoral dominance therein, Coburn was reelected in 1996 and 1998.<ref name=\"www\" /><ref name=\"www1\" />\n\nIn the House, Coburn earned a reputation as a political maverick due to his frequent battles with [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]].<ref name=\"Political Realities\" /> Most of these stand-offs stemmed from his belief that the Republican caucus was moving toward the [[political center]] and away from the more conservative [[Contract With America]] policy proposals that had brought the Republicans into power in Congress in 1994 for the first time in 40 years.<ref name=\"QKOUD\" />\n\n{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?179037-1/breach-trust ''Booknotes'' interview with Coburn on ''Breach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into Insiders'', November 23, 2003], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n\nCoburn endorsed conservative activist and former diplomat [[Alan Keyes]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 Republican presidential primaries]].<ref name=\"tulsaworld\" /> Coburn retired from Congress in 2001, fulfilling his pledge to serve no more than three terms in the House. His congressional district returned to the Democratic fold, as attorney [[Brad Carson]] defeated Andy Ewing, a Republican endorsed by Coburn. After leaving the House and returning to private medical practice, Coburn wrote ''Breach of Trust'', with [[ghostwriter]] John Hart, about his experiences in Congress. The book detailed Coburn's perspective on the internal Republican Party debates over the Contract With America and displayed his disdain for career politicians. Some of the figures he criticized (such as Gingrich) were already out of office at the time of the book's publishing, but others (such as former House Speaker [[Dennis Hastert]]) remained influential in Congress, which resulted in speculation that some congressional Republicans wanted no part of Coburn's return to politics.<ref name=\"tipping\" />\n\nDuring his tenure in the House, Coburn wrote and passed far-reaching pieces of legislation. These include laws to expand seniors' health care options, to protect access to home health care in rural areas and to allow Americans to access cheaper medications from [[Canada]] and other nations. Coburn also wrote a law intended to prevent the spread of [[AIDS]] to infants. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said about the law, \"In 10 long years of AIDS politics and funding, this is actually the first legislation to pass in this country that will rescue babies.\" He also wrote a law to renew and reform federal AIDS care programs.<ref name=\"mcfadden\" /> In 2002, President [[George W. Bush]] chose Coburn to serve as co-chair of the [[Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS]] (PACHA).<ref name=\"khn\" />\n\nDuring his three terms in the House, Coburn also played an influential role in reforming welfare and other federal entitlement programs.<ref name=\"mcfadden\" />\n\n====''Schindler's List'' TV broadcast====\nAs a congressman in 1997, Coburn protested [[NBC]]'s plan to air the [[MPAA film rating system|R-rated]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning [[Holocaust]] drama ''[[Schindler's List]]'' during [[prime time]].<ref name=\"pqarchiver\" /> Coburn stated that, in airing the movie without editing it for television, TV had been taken \"to an all-time low, with [[full-frontal nudity]], violence and profanity.\"<ref name=\"TV Notes \u2013 TV Notes\" /><ref name=\"google\" /> He also said the TV broadcast should outrage parents and decent-minded individuals everywhere. Coburn described the airing of ''Schindler's List'' on television as \"irresponsible sexual behavior. I cringe when I realize that there were children all across this nation watching this program.\"<ref name=\"Meet the knuckleheads of the U.S. Senate \u2013 U.S. Senate\" />\n\nThis statement met with strong criticism, as the film deals mainly with the Holocaust.<ref name=\"They Got Some 'Splainin' to Do\" /> After heavy criticism, Coburn apologized \"to all those I have offended\" and clarified that he agreed with the movie being aired on television, but stated that it should have been on later in the evening. In apologizing, Coburn said that at that time of the evening there are still large numbers of children watching without parental supervision and stated that he stood by his message of protecting children from violence, but had expressed it poorly. He also said, \"My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone about saying what I wanted to say.\"<ref name=\"jones\" /><ref name=\"highbeam\" /><ref name=\"Losing Sight Of The Big Picture\" />\n\nHe later wrote in ''Breach of Trust'' that he considered this one of the biggest mistakes in his life and that, while he still felt the material was unsuitable for a 7 p.m. television broadcast, he handled the situation poorly.<ref name=\"botcspan\" />\n\n===Senate career===\nAfter three years out of politics, Coburn announced his candidacy for the Senate seat being vacated by four-term incumbent \u00a0[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Don Nickles]]. Former [[Oklahoma City]] Mayor [[Kirk Humphreys]] (the favorite of the state and national Republican establishment) and Corporation Commissioner [[Bob Anthony]] joined the field before Coburn. However, Coburn won the primary by an unexpectedly large margin, taking 61% of the vote to Humphreys's 25%. In the general election, he faced [[Brad Carson]], the Democrat who had succeeded him in the 2nd District and was giving up his seat after only two terms.<ref name=\"martindale\" />\n\nIn the election, Coburn won by a margin of 53% to Carson's 42%. While Carson routed Coburn in the generally heavily Democratic 2nd District, Coburn swamped Carson in the [[Oklahoma City]] metropolitan area and the closer-in [[Tulsa]] suburbs. Coburn won the state's two largest counties, Tulsa and [[Oklahoma County|Oklahoma]], by a combined 86,000 votes, more than half of his overall margin of 166,000 votes cast.<ref name=\"fnlmh\" />\n\nCoburn's Senate voting record was as conservative as his House record.<ref name=\"Dr. No\" />\n\nCoburn was re-elected in 2010. He received 90% of the vote in the Republican primary and 70% in the general election.  While he already planned on not seeking a third term in tbe Senate due to his self-imposed two-term term limit, on January 16, 2014, Coburn announced he would resign his office before his term ended at the end of the year due to his declining health.<ref name=\"mgv41\" />\n\nOn April 29, 2014, Coburn introduced the [[Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act of 2014 (S. 2270; 113th Congress)]] into the Senate and it passed on June 3, 2014.<ref name=\"2270allactions\" />\n\n====Use of Senate hold====\nCoburn used the [[Senate hold]] privilege to prevent several bills from coming to the Senate floor.<ref name=\"politico.com\" /> Coburn earned a reputation for his use of this procedural mechanism.<ref name=\"politico.com\" /> In November 2009 Coburn drew attention for placing a hold on a [[veterans benefits]] bill known as the Veterans' Caregiver and Omnibus Health Benefits Act.<ref name=\"tulsaworld12\" /><ref name=\"armytimes\" /> Coburn also placed a hold on a bill intended to help end hostilities in [[Uganda]] by the [[Lord's Resistance Army]].<ref name=\"uganda\" />\n\nOn May 23, 2007, Coburn blocked two bills honoring the 100th birthday of [[Rachel Carson]]. Coburn called Carson's scientific work \"[[junk science]],\" proclaiming that Carson's landmark book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' was \"the catalyst in the deadly worldwide stigmatization against [[insecticides]], especially [[DDT]].\"<ref name=\"Dr. Coburn Stands for Science:Opposes Congressional efforts to honor debunked author linked to failed global malaria control\" /> Democratic Senator [[Ben Cardin|Benjamin L. Cardin]] of [[Maryland]] had intended to submit a resolution celebrating Carson for her \"legacy of scientific rigor coupled with poetic sensibility,\"<ref name=\"Mf5bX\" /> but Coburn blocked it, saying that \"the junk science and stigma surrounding DDT\u2014the cheapest and most effective insecticide on the planet\u2014have finally been jettisoned.\"<ref name=\"Id7fP\" />\n\nIn response to Coburn's holds, [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] introduced the Advancing America's Priorities Act, {{USBill|110|S|3297}}, in July 2008. S. 3297 combined thirty-five bills which Coburn had blocked into what Democrats called the \"Tomnibus\" bill.<ref name=\"Dr. No\" /><ref name=\"hunter\" /> The bill included health care provisions, new penalties for [[child pornography]], and several natural resources bills.<ref name=\"priorities\" /> The bill failed a [[cloture]] vote.<ref name=\"govtrack\" />\n\nCoburn opposed parts of the legislation creating the Lewis and Clark [[Mount Hood]] Wilderness Area, which would add protections to wildlands in [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Idaho]].<ref name=\"wilderness\" /> Coburn exercised a hold on the legislation in both March and November 2008,<ref name=\"oregonlive\" /><ref name=\"msn13\" /> and decried the required $10 million for surveying and mapping as wasteful.<ref name=\"oregonlive.com\" /> The Mount Hood bill would have been the largest amount of land added to federal protection since 1984.<ref name=\"oregonlive.com\" />\n\nIn March 2009, those [[wilderness areas]] became protected under the [[Omnibus Public Land Management Act]], which passed the Senate 73\u201321.<ref name=\"senate14\" />\n\nAccording to the ''[[Boston Globe]]'', Coburn initially blocked passage of the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] (GINA), objecting to provisions in the bill that allow discrimination based on genetic information from embryos and fetuses. After the embryo loophole was closed, Coburn lifted his hold on the bill.<ref name=\"Tom Coburn's position on the Genetic Discrimination Bill\" />\n\nCoburn had initially blocked passage of the LRA Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act, which would help to disarm the Lord's Resistance Army, a political group accused of human rights abuses. On March 9, 2010, Coburn lifted his hold on the LRA bill freeing it to move to the Senate floor after reaching a compromise regarding the funding of the bill,<ref name=\"Sen. Tom Coburn Blocks Bill Backed by Inhofe\" /> and an eleven-day protest outside of his office.<ref name=\"Coburn Said Yes\" />\n\n====John Ensign scandal====\nCoburn was affiliated with a religious organization called [[The Family (Christian political organization)|The Family]]. Coburn previously lived in one of the Family's [[Washington, D.C.]] dormitories with then-Senator [[John Ensign]], another Family member and longtime resident of the [[C Street Center]] who admitted he had an extramarital affair with a staffer in 2009. The announcement by Ensign of his infidelity brought public scrutiny of the Family and its connection to other high-ranking politicians, including Coburn.<ref name=\"startribune\" />\n\nCoburn, together with senior members of the Family, attempted to intervene to end Ensign's affair in February 2008, before the affair became public, including by meeting with the husband of Ensign's mistress and encouraging Ensign to write a letter to his mistress breaking off the affair.<ref name=\"Excerpt on the Family\" /><ref name=\"wp-2009-06-25\" /><ref name=\"Thrush\" /> Ensign was driven to a branch of [[Federal Express]] from the C Street Center to post the letter, shortly after which Ensign called to tell his mistress to ignore it.<ref name=\"Excerpt on the Family\" /><ref name=\"wp-2009-06-25\" /><ref name=\"Thrush\" />\n\nCoburn refused to speak about his involvement in Ensign's affair or his knowledge of the affair well before it became public, asserting legal privilege due to his separate statuses as a licensed physician in the State of Oklahoma and a deacon.<ref name=\"cbsnews\" />\n\nIn October 2009, Coburn did make a statement to ''[[The New York Times]]'' about Ensign's affair and cover-up: \"John got trapped doing something really stupid and then made a lot of other mistakes afterward. Judgment gets impaired by arrogance and that's what's going on here.\"<ref name=\"Senator's Aid After Affair Raises Flags Over Ethics\" />\n\nIn May 2011, the Senate Ethics Committee identified Coburn in their report on the [[John Ensign scandal|ethics violations]] of Senator John Ensign. The report stated that Coburn knew about Ensign's extramarital affair and was involved in trying to negotiate a financial settlement to cover it up.<ref name=\"senate17\" />\n\n====Whistleblower rights====\nCoburn was involved in the Bush Administration's struggle with Congress over [[whistleblower]] rights. In the case of ''[[Garcetti v. Ceballos]]'', the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that [[Civil service|government employees]] who testify against their employers did not have protection from retaliation by their employers under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[Constitution]].<ref name=\"Item Not Found \u2014 SFGate\" /> The [[free speech]] protections of the First Amendment have long been used to shield whistleblowers from retaliation.<ref name=\"whistleblowers\" />\n\nIn response to the Supreme Court decision, the House passed H.R. 985, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 2007. Bush, citing [[national security]] concerns, promised to [[veto]] the bill should it be enacted into law by Congress. The Senate's version of the Whistleblower Protection Act (S. 274) was approved by the [[Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]] on June 13, 2007. However, that version failed to reach a vote by the Senate, as Coburn placed a hold on the bill; effectively preventing the passage of the bill, which had [[bipartisan]] support in the Senate.<ref name=\"blackwater\" />\n\nCoburn's website features a news item about [[United Nations]] whistleblower Mathieu Credo Koumoin, a former employee for the U.N. Development Program in West Africa, who has asked U.N. ethics chief [[Robert Benson (United Nations ethics chief)|Robert Benson]] for protection under the U.N.'s new whistleblower protection rules.<ref name=\": Senator Tom Coburn's Oversight Action :: Latest News :\" /> The site has a link to the \"United Nations Watch\" of the Republican Office of the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]]' Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information and International Security, of which he was the ranking minority member.<ref name=\": Senator Tom Coburn's Oversight Action :: Issues :\" /> Coburn's website also features a tip line for potential whistleblowers on [[government waste]] and fraud.<ref name=\": Senator Tom Coburn's Oversight Action :: Submit a Tip :\" />\n\n====Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations====\nCoburn joined Congressmen [[Sue Myrick]] (R-[[North Carolina|NC]]), [[Trent Franks]] (R-[[Arizona|AZ]]), [[John Shadegg]] (R-AZ), [[Paul Broun]] (R-[[Georgia (U.S. state)|GA]]) and [[Patrick McHenry]] (R-NC) in a letter to [[IRS Commissioner]] [[Douglas H. Shulman]] on November 16, 2009, asking that the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) be investigated for excessive lobbying and failing to register as a lobbying organization.<ref name=\"talkingpointsmemo\" /> The request came in the wake of the publication of a book, ''[[Muslim Mafia]]'', the foreword of which had been penned by Myrick, that portrayed CAIR as a subversive organization allied with international [[terrorism|terrorists]].<ref name=\"co\" />\n\n====Criticism of the National Science Foundation====\nOn May 26, 2011 Coburn released his 73-page report, \"[[National Science Foundation: Under the Microscope]]\",<ref name=\"senate15\" /><ref name=\"senate16\" /> receiving immediate attention from such media outlets as ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Fox News]] and [[MSNBC]].<ref name=\"Sen. Coburn Sets Sight on Waste, Duplication at Science Agency\" /><ref name=\"Senate Report Finds Billions In Waste On Science Foundation Studies\" /><ref name=\"Cosmic Log \u2013 Funny science sparks serious spat\" />\n\n====STOCK Act====\nCoburn was one of three senators who voted against the [[STOCK Act|Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act]] (STOCK Act).<ref name=\"0ZsdT\" /> On February 3, 2012, Coburn released the following statement regarding the Act:\n\n{{Quote|It's disappointing the Senate spent a week debating a bill that duplicates existing law and fails to address the real problems facing the country. The only way we can restore confidence in Congress is to make hard choices and solve real problems by doing things like reforming our tax code, repairing our safety net and reducing our crushing debt burden. Doing anything less will further alienate the American people and rightfully so.<ref name=\"Yut2Q\" />}}\n\n====Committee assignments====\nCoburn was a member of the following committees:\n* '''[[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]]''' (Ranking Member)\n** [[United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]]\n** [[United States Senate Homeland Security Subcommittee on Financial and Contracting Oversight|Subcommittee on Financial and Contracting Oversight]]\n** [[United States Senate Homeland Security Subcommittee on the Efficiency and Effectiveness of Federal Programs and the Federal Workforce|Subcommittee on the Efficiency and Effectiveness of Federal Programs and the Federal Workforce]]\n** [[United States Senate Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emergency Management, Intergovernmental Affairs, and the District of Columbia|Subcommittee on Emergency Management, Intergovernmental Affairs, and the District of Columbia]]\n* '''[[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Select Committee on Intelligence]]'''\n* '''[[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs]]'''\n** [[United States Senate Banking Subcommittee on Economic Policy|Subcommittee on Economic Policy]]\n** [[United States Senate Banking Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment|Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment]]\n** [[United States Senate Banking Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development|Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development]]\n\n==Political positions==\n===Abortion===\nCoburn opposed [[abortion in the United States|abortion]], with the exception of abortions necessary to save the life of the mother. In 2000, he sponsored a bill to prevent the [[Food and Drug Administration]] from developing, testing, or approving the [[abortifacient]] [[RU-486]]. On July 13, the bill failed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 182 to 187.<ref name=\"RU-486 Abortion Pill: Developments during 1999 & 2000\" /> On the issue, Coburn sparked controversy with his remark, \"I favor the death penalty for abortionists and other people who take life.\"<ref name=\"Romano\" /><ref name=\"Democrats, Abortion and 'Alfie'\" /> He noted that his great-grandmother was [[rape]]d by a sheriff.<ref name=\"Life Begins at Conversation (page 2)\" />\n\nCoburn was one of the original authors of the federal [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] upheld by the United States Supreme Court in ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''.<ref name=\"commerce\" /> The act relied on an expansive view of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]'s [[Commerce Clause]], as it applies to \"any [[physician]] who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a [[partial-birth abortion]].\"<ref name=\"commerce\" /> The [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Act]]'s reliance on such a broad reading of the [[Commerce Clause]] was criticized by [[Independence Institute]] scholar [[David Kopel]] and [[University of Tennessee College of Law|University of Tennessee]] law professor [[Glenn Reynolds]], who noted that \"[u]nless a physician is operating a mobile abortion clinic on the [[Metroliner (Amtrak)|Metroliner]], it is not really possible to perform an abortion 'in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce.'\"<ref name=\"davekopel\" /> When Coburn later called Supreme Court nominee [[Elena Kagan]] \"ignorant\" due to her \"very expansive view\" of the [[Commerce Clause]], his support for the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Act]] was used  by Kagan supporters who charged him with hypocrisy on the issue.<ref name=\"commerce\" />\n\nOn September 14, 2005, during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee [[John G. Roberts]], Coburn began his opening statement with a critique of [[Inside the Beltway (terminology)|Beltway]] [[partisan (political)|partisan politics]] while, according to news reports, \"choking back a sob.\"<ref name=\"WP\" /> Coburn had earlier been completing a [[crossword puzzle]] during the hearings,<ref name=\"WP\" /> and this fact was highlighted by ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' to ridicule Coburn's [[pathos]].<ref name=\"TDS on the Roberts Hearing\" /> Coburn then began his questioning by discussing the various legal terms mentioned during the previous day's hearings. Proceeding to questions regarding both abortion and end-of-life issues, Coburn, who noted that during his tenure as an obstetrician he had delivered some 4,000 babies, asked Roberts whether the judge agreed with the proposition that \"the opposite of being dead is being alive.\"\n\n{{quote|You know I'm going somewhere. One of the problems I have is coming up with just the common sense and logic that if brain wave and heartbeat signifies life, the absence of them signifies death, then the presence of them certainly signifies life.

And that's how I view a lot of the decisions that have come from the Supreme Court on the issue of abortion.<ref name=\"Transcript: Day Three of the Roberts Confirmation Hearings\" />}}\n\n===Fiscal conservatism===\n[[File:Coburn and Obama discuss S. 2590.jpg|thumb|Senators Coburn and [[Barack Obama]] discuss S. 2590 in 2006]]\n[[File:Coburn and Obama greet Bush.jpg|thumb|Senators Coburn and Obama and Congressman [[Jeb Hensarling]] greet President [[George W. Bush]] at the signing ceremony of the [[Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006]]]]\nThe best-known of Coburn's amendments was an amendment to the fiscal 2006 [[appropriations bill]] that funds transportation projects.<ref name=\"loc5\" /> Coburn's amendment would have transferred funding from the [[Gravina Island Bridge|Bridge to Nowhere]] in [[Alaska]] to rebuild [[Louisiana]]'s \"Twin Spans\" bridge, which was devastated by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The amendment was defeated in the Senate, 82\u201314, after [[Ted Stevens]], the senior senator from Alaska, threatened to resign his office if the amendment were passed. Coburn's actions did result in getting the funds made into a more politically feasible [[block grant]] to the State of Alaska, which can use the funds for the bridge or other projects. The renovations for the [[Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania|Elizabethtown]] [[Elizabethtown (Amtrak station)|Amtrak Station]] were cited by Coburn as an example of [[pork barrel]] spending in the stimulus bill.<ref name=\"3I1Le\" />\n\nCoburn was also a member of the [[Fiscal Watch Team]], a group of seven senators led by [[John McCain]], whose stated goal is to combat \"wasteful government spending.\"<ref name=\"McCain calls for spending offsets to ensure fiscal responsibility\" />{{clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}}\n\nOn April 6, 2006, Coburn and Senators [[Barack Obama]], [[Thomas Carper]] and [[John McCain]] introduced the [[Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006]].<ref name=\"s2590introduced\" /> The bill requires the full disclosure of all entities and organizations receiving [[federal funds]] beginning in fiscal year (FY) 2007 on a website maintained by the [[Office of Management and Budget]]. The bill was signed into law on September 26, 2006.<ref name=\"s2590summary\" />\n\nCoburn and McCain noted that the practice of members of Congress adding [[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]] had risen dramatically over the years, from 121 earmarks in 1987 to 15,268 earmarks in 2005, according to the [[Congressional Research Service]].<ref name=\"earmark\" />\n\nIn July 2007, Coburn criticized pork-barrel spending that Nebraska Senator [[Ben Nelson]] had inserted into the 2007 [[defense spending]] bill. Coburn said that the earmarks would benefit Nelson's son Patrick's employer with millions in federal dollars and that the situation violated terms of the Transparency Act, which was passed by the Senate but had not yet been voted on in the House. Nelson's spokesperson said the Senator did nothing wrong.<ref name=\"Omaha Company's Windfall, Hiring of Lawmaker's Son Irks Senator\" /> At that time, newspapers in [[Nebraska]] and Oklahoma noted that Coburn failed to criticize very similar earmarks that had benefited Oklahoma.<ref name=\"editorial\" />\n\nIn 1997, Coburn introduced a bill called the [[HIV Prevention Act of 1997]], which would have amended the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Act]]. The bill would have required confidential notification of [[HIV]] exposure to the sexual partners of those diagnosed with HIV, along with counseling and testing.<ref name=\"loc6\" />\n\nIn 2010, Coburn called for a freeze on defense spending.<ref name=\"senate7\" /> The following year, along with Democratic [[Maryland]] Senator [[Ben Cardin]], he introduced a bill to \"get rid of the most venerable big [[Ethanol fuel|ethanol]] subsidy: the blenders tax credit.\"<ref name=\"washingtonexaminer\" /> Coburn served on the Simpson-Bowles debt reduction commission in 2010 and was one of the only Republicans in Congress open to tax increases as a means of balancing the budget.<ref name=\"cNZwF\" />\n\nIn 2011 Coburn broke with [[Americans for Tax Reform]] with an ethanol amendment that gathered 70 votes in the Senate. He said that anti-tax activist [[Grover Norquist]]'s influence was overstated, and that revenue increases were needed in order to \"fix the country.\"<ref name=\"politico8\" /><ref name=\"msn\" />\n\nIn 2012, Coburn identified less than $7 billion a year in possible defense savings and over half of these savings were to be through the elimination of military personnel involved in [[Military logistics|supply]], [[Military transportation|transportation]], and [[Military communications|communications]] services.<ref name=\"nLFEA\" />\n\nIn May 2013, after [[2013 Moore tornado|tornadoes ripped through his state]], Coburn said that any new funding allocated for disaster relief needed to be offset by cuts to other federal spending.<ref name=\"UicWS\" />\n\nCoburn was a fierce critic of the plan to attempt to defund the [[Affordable Care Act]] by [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|shutting down the federal government]], saying that the strategy was \"doomed to fail\" and that [[Ted Cruz]] and others who supported the plan had a \"short-term goal with lousy tactics\".<ref name=\"battling\" />\n\n===Gun rights===\nIn regards to the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]], Coburn believed that it \"recognizes the right of individual, law-abiding citizens to own and use [[firearm]]s,\" and he opposed \"any and all efforts to mandate [[gun control]] on law-abiding citizens.\"<ref name=\"Issue Statements \u2013 Second Amendment\" /> On the [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]], which aimed \"to establish fair and transparent practices relating to the extension of credit under an open-end consumer credit plan and for other purposes,\"<ref name=\"Read The Bill: H.R. 627\" /> Coburn sponsored an amendment that would allow [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed carry]] of firearms in [[U.S. National Park Service|national parks]]. The Senate passed the amendment 67\u201329.<ref name=\"lillis\" />\n\nCoburn placed a hold on final Senate consideration of a measure passed by the House in the wake of the [[Virginia Tech]] shootings to improve state performance in checking the federal watch list of gun buyers.<ref name=\"Gun Games in the Senate\" /> However, after the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook massacre]] in December 2012, Coburn (who had already announced he would not run for re-election) reversed himself and came out in support of [[universal background checks]].<ref name=\"AmWsr\" /> Coburn partnered with Democratic members of the Senate such as [[Charles Schumer]] and [[Joe Manchin]] (to whose re-election campaign Coburn donated money<ref name=\"OkjsC\" />) to determine what a universal background check measure should look like. However, these talks ultimately broke down, and in April 2013, Coburn was one of 46 senators to vote against the amendment in its final form, defeating its passage.<ref name=\"VomNG\" /><ref name=\"8aFjl\" />\n\n===Health care reform===\n[[File:U.S. Senator Tom Coburn speaking at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland.jpg|thumb|Senator Coburn at the 2014 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC) in Maryland]]\nCoburn voted against the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] in December 2009,<ref name=\"senate\" /> and against the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]].<ref name=\"senate2\" />\n\nCoburn co-authored the Patients Choice Act of 2009<ref name=\"kO326\" /> (S. 1099), a Republican plan for [[health care reform in the United States]],<ref name=\"The GOP's Health-Care Alternative \u2013 WSJ.com\" /> which in part 1) Requires the U.S. [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) to convene an interagency coordinating committee to develop a national strategic plan for prevention. The act provided for health promotion and disease prevention activities consistent with such a plan. Secondly it set forth provisions governing the establishment and operation of state-based health care exchanges to facilitate the individual purchase of private health insurance and the creation of a market where private health plans compete for enrollees based on price and quality. Thirdly it intended to amend the [[Internal Revenue Code]] to allow a refundable tax credit for qualified health care insurance coverage. Fourth it sets forth programs to prevent Medicare fraud and abuse, including ending the use of social security numbers to identify Medicare beneficiaries. Fifth it sought to terminate the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]].<ref name=\"loc\" />\n\n===Presidential nominations to the Judicial and Executive branches of government===\nDuring the [[George W. Bush administration|administration of President George W. Bush]], Coburn spoke out against the threat by some Democrats to [[filibuster]] nominations to judicial and [[Executive Branch]] positions. He took the position that no presidential nomination should ever be filibustered, in light of the wording of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. Coburn said, \"There is a defined charge to the president and the Senate on advice and consent.\"<ref name=\"Coburn, Inhofe ready for end to nominee drama\" />\n\nIn May 2009, Coburn was the only Senator to vote against the confirmation of [[Gil Kerlikowske]] as the [[Director of the National Drug Control Policy]].<ref name=\"senate9\" />\n\n===Same-sex marriage===\nCoburn opposed [[same-sex marriage]]. In 2006, he voted in support of a proposed constitutional amendment to ban it.<ref name=\"AbdAS\" />\n\n===War in Iraq===\nOn May 24, 2007, the U.S. Senate voted 80\u201314 to fund the [[war in Iraq]], which included [[U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007]]. Coburn voted nay.<ref name=\"senate3\" /> On October 1, 2007, the Senate voted 92\u20133 to fund the war in Iraq. Coburn voted nay.<ref name=\"senate4\" /> In February 2008, Coburn said, \"I will tell you personally that I think it was probably a mistake going to [[Iraq]].\"<ref name=\"Coburn declines to elaborate on Iraq War statement\" />\n\nOn December 15, 2014, Coburn stalled the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act aimed at stemming veteran suicides.  The bill would require a report on successful veteran suicide prevention programs and allow the [[United States Veterans Administration]] to pay incentives to hire psychiatrists. Paul Rieckhoff, CEO of [[Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America]], said that despite his reputation as a budget hawk, Coburn should have recognized that the $22 million cost of the bill is worth the lives it would have saved.  \"It's a shame that after two decades of service in Washington, Sen. Coburn will always be remembered for this final, misguided attack on veterans nationwide,\" he said. \"If it takes 90 days for the new Congress to re-pass this bill, the statistics tell us another 1,980 vets will have died by suicide. That should be a heavy burden on the conscience of Sen. Coburn and this Congress.\" Speaking out against the legislation, Coburn said \"I object, not because I don't want to save suicides, but because I don't think this bill will do the first thing to change what's happening,\" arguing that the bill\" \"throws money and doesn't solve the real problem\"<ref name=\"f25Y1\" />\n\n==Post-Senate career==\nAfter resigning from the U.S. Senate, Coburn joined [[Citizens for Self-Governance]] as a senior advisor to the group's Convention of States project, which seeks to convene a [[convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution]].<ref name=\"YfxzN\" /><ref name=\"9gdol\" /> In 2017, he authored a book on the subject titled ''Smashing the DC Monopoly: Using Article V to Restore Freedom and Stop Runaway Government''.<ref name=\"5cFlO\" />\n\nCoburn was affiliated with the [[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]], consulting on the Institute's Project FDA, an effort to promote faster drug approval processes.<ref name=\"Cunningham\" /> In 2016, he became a Manhattan Institute senior fellow.<ref name=\"MI\" />\n\n==Awards==\nIn 2013, Coburn received the [[Heinz Awards|U.S. Senator John Heinz Award]] for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by the [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Awards]].<ref name=\"YmoY4\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nIn spite of their ideological differences, Coburn was a friend of President [[Barack Obama]]. They became friends in 2005 when they both [[United States Senate elections, 2004|arrived in the Senate]] at the same time.<ref name=\"president\" /> They worked together on [[political ethics]] reform legislation,<ref name=\"thehill\" /> to set up an online federal spending database and to crack down on [[no-bid contract]]ing at the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. In April 2011, Coburn spoke to [[Bloomberg TV]] about Obama, saying, \"I love the man. I think he's a neat man. I don't want him to be president, but I still love him. He is our President. He's my President. And I disagree with him adamantly on 95% of the issues, but that doesn't mean I can't have a great relationship. And that's a model people ought to follow.\"<ref name=\"Coburn Talks About Obama\" />\n\nBefore the [[2009 BCS National Championship Game|2009 BCS game]] between the [[2008 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma Sooners]] and the [[2009 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]], Coburn made a bet over the outcome of the game with [[Florida]] Senator [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]]\u2014the loser had to serenade the winner with a song. The Gators defeated the Sooners and Coburn sang [[Elton John]]'s \"[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]\" to Nelson, who had once flown into space.<ref name=\"abcnews\" />\n\n===Health and death ===\nIn November 2013, Coburn made public that he had been diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]]. In 2011, he had had prostate cancer surgery while also surviving [[colon cancer]] and [[melanoma]].<ref name=\"Koplan-Obamacare\" /><ref name=\"Kliff-Obamacare\" /><ref name=\"Fox- Obamacare\" /> \n\nTom Coburn died from prostate cancer at his home in Tulsa on March 28, 2020.<ref name=\"QKOUD\" /><ref name=\"ZSewN\" />\n\n==Electoral history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ;\"\n|+ {{ushr|Oklahoma|2|}}: Results 1994\u20131998<ref name=\"clerkresults\" />\n|-\n!

He upheld his [[campaign promise|campaign pledge]] to serve no more than three consecutive terms and did not run for re-election in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2000|2000]]. In [[United States Senate election in Oklahoma, 2004|2004]], he returned to political life with a successful run for the U.S. Senate.

W. Coburn School of Law]] at [[Oral Roberts University]].<ref name=\"abundant\" />\n\nCoburn graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in accounting from [[Oklahoma State University]],<ref name=\":0\" /> where he was also a member of [[Sigma Nu]] fraternity. In 1968, he married Carolyn Denton,<ref name=\":0\" /> the 1967 [[Miss Oklahoma]];<ref name=\"wicqT\" /> their three daughters are Callie,<ref name=\"Wj4AR\" /> Katie and [[Sarah Coburn|Sarah]], a leading operatic [[soprano]].<ref name=\"drzGw\" /> One of the top ten seniors in the School of Business, Coburn served as president of the College of Business Student Council.<ref name=\"okstate\" />\n\nFrom 1970 to 1978, Coburn served as a manufacturing manager at the Ophthalmic Division of Coburn Optical Industries in [[Colonial Heights, Virginia]]. While Coburn was manager, the Virginia division of Coburn Optical grew from 13 employees to over 350 and captured 35 percent of the U.S. market.<ref name=\"okstate\" />\n\nAfter recovering from an occurrence of malignant [[melanoma]], Coburn pursued a medical degree and graduated from the [[University of Oklahoma College of Medicine|University of Oklahoma Medical School]] with honors in 1983.<ref name=\":0\" /> He then opened Maternal & Family Practice in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]], and served as a deacon in a [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist Church]]. During his career in [[obstetrics]], he treated over 15,000 patients, delivered 4,000 babies and was subject to one [[malpractice]] lawsuit, which was dismissed without finding Coburn at fault.<ref name=\"legislation\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Together Coburn and his wife were members of First Baptist Church of Muskogee.<ref name=\": United States Senator Tom Coburn :: About Senator Coburn :\" />\n\n===Sterilization controversy===\nA [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] Coburn performed on a 20-year-old woman, Angela Plummer, in 1990, became what was called \"the most incendiary issue\" of his Senate campaign.<ref name=\"american\" /> Coburn performed the sterilization on the woman during an emergency surgery to treat a life-threatening [[ectopic pregnancy]], removing her healthy intact [[fallopian tube]] as well as the one damaged by the surgery. The woman sued Coburn, alleging that he did not have consent to sterilize her, while Coburn claimed he had her oral consent. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed with no finding of liability on Coburn's part.<ref name=\"washington\" />\n\nThe state attorney general claimed that Coburn committed [[Medicaid]] [[fraud]] by not reporting the sterilization when he filed a claim for the emergency surgery. Medicaid did not reimburse doctors for sterilization procedures for patients under 21 and according to the attorney general, Coburn would not have been reimbursed at all had he disclosed this information. Coburn says since he did not file a claim for the sterilization, no fraud was committed. No charges were filed against Coburn for this claim.<ref name=\"salon\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref name=\"Coburn Badgered With Dismissed Suit\" /><ref name=\"conservative\" />\n\n==Political career==\n===House career===\nIn 1994, Coburn ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in [[Oklahoma's 2nd congressional district]], which was based in Muskogee and included 22 counties in northeastern Oklahoma. Coburn initially expected to face eight-term incumbent [[Mike Synar]]. However, Synar was defeated in a runoff for the Democratic nomination by a 71-year-old retired [[principal (school)|principal]], Virgil Cooper. According to Coburn's 2003 book, ''Breach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into Insiders'', Coburn and Cooper got along well, since both were opposed to the more liberal Synar. The general election was cordial since both men knew that Synar would not return to Washington regardless of the outcome. Coburn won by a 52%\u201348% margin, becoming the first Republican to represent the district since 1921.<ref name=\"ohc\" />\n\nCoburn was one of the most [[conservatism|conservative]] members of the House. He supported \"reducing the size of the [[Federal budget (United States)|federal budget]],\" wanted to make [[abortion]] illegal and supported the proposed television [[V-chip]] legislation.<ref name=\"JnuFs\" />\n\nDespite representing a heavily Democratic district and President [[Bill Clinton]]'s electoral dominance therein, Coburn was reelected in 1996 and 1998.<ref name=\"www\" /><ref name=\"www1\" />\n\nIn the House, Coburn earned a reputation as a political maverick due to his frequent battles with [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]].<ref name=\"Political Realities\" /> Most of these stand-offs stemmed from his belief that the Republican caucus was moving toward the [[political center]] and away from the more conservative [[Contract With America]] policy proposals that had brought the Republicans into power in Congress in 1994 for the first time in 40 years.<ref name=\"QKOUD\" />\n\n{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?179037-1/breach-trust ''Booknotes'' interview with Coburn on ''Breach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into Insiders'', November 23, 2003], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n\nCoburn endorsed conservative activist and former diplomat [[Alan Keyes]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 Republican presidential primaries]].<ref name=\"tulsaworld\" /> Coburn retired from Congress in 2001, fulfilling his pledge to serve no more than three terms in the House. His congressional district returned to the Democratic fold, as attorney [[Brad Carson]] defeated Andy Ewing, a Republican endorsed by Coburn. After leaving the House and returning to private medical practice, Coburn wrote ''Breach of Trust'', with [[ghostwriter]] John Hart, about his experiences in Congress. The book detailed Coburn's perspective on the internal Republican Party debates over the Contract With America and displayed his disdain for career politicians. Some of the figures he criticized (such as Gingrich) were already out of office at the time of the book's publishing, but others (such as former House Speaker [[Dennis Hastert]]) remained influential in Congress, which resulted in speculation that some congressional Republicans wanted no part of Coburn's return to politics.<ref name=\"tipping\" />\n\nDuring his tenure in the House, Coburn wrote and passed far-reaching pieces of legislation. These include laws to expand seniors' health care options, to protect access to home health care in rural areas and to allow Americans to access cheaper medications from [[Canada]] and other nations. Coburn also wrote a law intended to prevent the spread of [[AIDS]] to infants. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said about the law, \"In 10 long years of AIDS politics and funding, this is actually the first legislation to pass in this country that will rescue babies.\" He also wrote a law to renew and reform federal AIDS care programs.<ref name=\"mcfadden\" /> In 2002, President [[George W. Bush]] chose Coburn to serve as co-chair of the [[Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS]] (PACHA).<ref name=\"khn\" />\n\nDuring his three terms in the House, Coburn also played an influential role in reforming welfare and other federal entitlement programs.<ref name=\"mcfadden\" />\n\n====''Schindler's List'' TV broadcast====\nAs a congressman in 1997, Coburn protested [[NBC]]'s plan to air the [[MPAA film rating system|R-rated]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning [[Holocaust]] drama ''[[Schindler's List]]'' during [[prime time]].<ref name=\"pqarchiver\" /> Coburn stated that, in airing the movie without editing it for television, TV had been taken \"to an all-time low, with [[full-frontal nudity]], violence and profanity.\"<ref name=\"TV Notes \u2013 TV Notes\" /><ref name=\"google\" /> He also said the TV broadcast should outrage parents and decent-minded individuals everywhere. Coburn described the airing of ''Schindler's List'' on television as \"irresponsible sexual behavior. I cringe when I realize that there were children all across this nation watching this program.\"<ref name=\"Meet the knuckleheads of the U.S. Senate \u2013 U.S. Senate\" />\n\nThis statement met with strong criticism, as the film deals mainly with the Holocaust.<ref name=\"They Got Some 'Splainin' to Do\" /> After heavy criticism, Coburn apologized \"to all those I have offended\" and clarified that he agreed with the movie being aired on television, but stated that it should have been on later in the evening. In apologizing, Coburn said that at that time of the evening there are still large numbers of children watching without parental supervision and stated that he stood by his message of protecting children from violence, but had expressed it poorly. He also said, \"My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone about saying what I wanted to say.\"<ref name=\"jones\" /><ref name=\"highbeam\" /><ref name=\"Losing Sight Of The Big Picture\" />\n\nHe later wrote in ''Breach of Trust'' that he considered this one of the biggest mistakes in his life and that, while he still felt the material was unsuitable for a 7 p.m. television broadcast, he handled the situation poorly.<ref name=\"botcspan\" />\n\n===Senate career===\nAfter three years out of politics, Coburn announced his candidacy for the Senate seat being vacated by four-term incumbent \u00a0[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Don Nickles]]. Former [[Oklahoma City]] Mayor [[Kirk Humphreys]] (the favorite of the state and national Republican establishment) and Corporation Commissioner [[Bob Anthony]] joined the field before Coburn. However, Coburn won the primary by an unexpectedly large margin, taking 61% of the vote to Humphreys's 25%. In the general election, he faced [[Brad Carson]], the Democrat who had succeeded him in the 2nd District and was giving up his seat after only two terms.<ref name=\"martindale\" />\n\nIn the election, Coburn won by a margin of 53% to Carson's 42%. While Carson routed Coburn in the generally heavily Democratic 2nd District, Coburn swamped Carson in the [[Oklahoma City]] metropolitan area and the closer-in [[Tulsa]] suburbs. Coburn won the state's two largest counties, Tulsa and [[Oklahoma County|Oklahoma]], by a combined 86,000 votes, more than half of his overall margin of 166,000 votes cast.<ref name=\"fnlmh\" />\n\nCoburn's Senate voting record was as conservative as his House record.<ref name=\"Dr. No\" />\n\nCoburn was re-elected in 2010. He received 90% of the vote in the Republican primary and 70% in the general election.  While he already planned on not seeking a third term in tbe Senate due to his self-imposed two-term term limit, on January 16, 2014, Coburn announced he would resign his office before his term ended at the end of the year due to his declining health.<ref name=\"mgv41\" />\n\nOn April 29, 2014, Coburn introduced the [[Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act of 2014 (S. 2270; 113th Congress)]] into the Senate and it passed on June 3, 2014.<ref name=\"2270allactions\" />\n\n====Use of Senate hold====\nCoburn used the [[Senate hold]] privilege to prevent several bills from coming to the Senate floor.<ref name=\"politico.com\" /> Coburn earned a reputation for his use of this procedural mechanism.<ref name=\"politico.com\" /> In November 2009 Coburn drew attention for placing a hold on a [[veterans benefits]] bill known as the Veterans' Caregiver and Omnibus Health Benefits Act.<ref name=\"tulsaworld12\" /><ref name=\"armytimes\" /> Coburn also placed a hold on a bill intended to help end hostilities in [[Uganda]] by the [[Lord's Resistance Army]].<ref name=\"uganda\" />\n\nOn May 23, 2007, Coburn blocked two bills honoring the 100th birthday of [[Rachel Carson]]. Coburn called Carson's scientific work \"[[junk science]],\" proclaiming that Carson's landmark book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' was \"the catalyst in the deadly worldwide stigmatization against [[insecticides]], especially [[DDT]].\"<ref name=\"Dr. Coburn Stands for Science:Opposes Congressional efforts to honor debunked author linked to failed global malaria control\" /> Democratic Senator [[Ben Cardin|Benjamin L. Cardin]] of [[Maryland]] had intended to submit a resolution celebrating Carson for her \"legacy of scientific rigor coupled with poetic sensibility,\"<ref name=\"Mf5bX\" /> but Coburn blocked it, saying that \"the junk science and stigma surrounding DDT\u2014the cheapest and most effective insecticide on the planet\u2014have finally been jettisoned.\"<ref name=\"Id7fP\" />\n\nIn response to Coburn's holds, [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] introduced the Advancing America's Priorities Act, {{USBill|110|S|3297}}, in July 2008. S. 3297 combined thirty-five bills which Coburn had blocked into what Democrats called the \"Tomnibus\" bill.<ref name=\"Dr. No\" /><ref name=\"hunter\" /> The bill included health care provisions, new penalties for [[child pornography]], and several natural resources bills.<ref name=\"priorities\" /> The bill failed a [[cloture]] vote.<ref name=\"govtrack\" />\n\nCoburn opposed parts of the legislation creating the Lewis and Clark [[Mount Hood]] Wilderness Area, which would add protections to wildlands in [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Idaho]].<ref name=\"wilderness\" /> Coburn exercised a hold on the legislation in both March and November 2008,<ref name=\"oregonlive\" /><ref name=\"msn13\" /> and decried the required $10 million for surveying and mapping as wasteful.<ref name=\"oregonlive.com\" /> The Mount Hood bill would have been the largest amount of land added to federal protection since 1984.<ref name=\"oregonlive.com\" />\n\nIn March 2009, those [[wilderness areas]] became protected under the [[Omnibus Public Land Management Act]], which passed the Senate 73\u201321.<ref name=\"senate14\" />\n\nAccording to the ''[[Boston Globe]]'', Coburn initially blocked passage of the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] (GINA), objecting to provisions in the bill that allow discrimination based on genetic information from embryos and fetuses. After the embryo loophole was closed, Coburn lifted his hold on the bill.<ref name=\"Tom Coburn's position on the Genetic Discrimination Bill\" />\n\nCoburn had initially blocked passage of the LRA Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act, which would help to disarm the Lord's Resistance Army, a political group accused of human rights abuses. On March 9, 2010, Coburn lifted his hold on the LRA bill freeing it to move to the Senate floor after reaching a compromise regarding the funding of the bill,<ref name=\"Sen. Tom Coburn Blocks Bill Backed by Inhofe\" /> and an eleven-day protest outside of his office.<ref name=\"Coburn Said Yes\" />\n\n====John Ensign scandal====\nCoburn was affiliated with a religious organization called [[The Family (Christian political organization)|The Family]]. Coburn previously lived in one of the Family's [[Washington, D.C.]] dormitories with then-Senator [[John Ensign]], another Family member and longtime resident of the [[C Street Center]] who admitted he had an extramarital affair with a staffer in 2009. The announcement by Ensign of his infidelity brought public scrutiny of the Family and its connection to other high-ranking politicians, including Coburn.<ref name=\"startribune\" />\n\nCoburn, together with senior members of the Family, attempted to intervene to end Ensign's affair in February 2008, before the affair became public, including by meeting with the husband of Ensign's mistress and encouraging Ensign to write a letter to his mistress breaking off the affair.<ref name=\"Excerpt on the Family\" /><ref name=\"wp-2009-06-25\" /><ref name=\"Thrush\" /> Ensign was driven to a branch of [[Federal Express]] from the C Street Center to post the letter, shortly after which Ensign called to tell his mistress to ignore it.<ref name=\"Excerpt on the Family\" /><ref name=\"wp-2009-06-25\" /><ref name=\"Thrush\" />\n\nCoburn refused to speak about his involvement in Ensign's affair or his knowledge of the affair well before it became public, asserting legal privilege due to his separate statuses as a licensed physician in the State of Oklahoma and a deacon.<ref name=\"cbsnews\" />\n\nIn October 2009, Coburn did make a statement to ''[[The New York Times]]'' about Ensign's affair and cover-up: \"John got trapped doing something really stupid and then made a lot of other mistakes afterward. Judgment gets impaired by arrogance and that's what's going on here.\"<ref name=\"Senator's Aid After Affair Raises Flags Over Ethics\" />\n\nIn May 2011, the Senate Ethics Committee identified Coburn in their report on the [[John Ensign scandal|ethics violations]] of Senator John Ensign. The report stated that Coburn knew about Ensign's extramarital affair and was involved in trying to negotiate a financial settlement to cover it up.<ref name=\"senate17\" />\n\n====Whistleblower rights====\nCoburn was involved in the Bush Administration's struggle with Congress over [[whistleblower]] rights. In the case of ''[[Garcetti v. Ceballos]]'', the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that [[Civil service|government employees]] who testify against their employers did not have protection from retaliation by their employers under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[Constitution]].<ref name=\"Item Not Found \u2014 SFGate\" /> The [[free speech]] protections of the First Amendment have long been used to shield whistleblowers from retaliation.<ref name=\"whistleblowers\" />\n\nIn response to the Supreme Court decision, the House passed H.R. 985, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 2007. Bush, citing [[national security]] concerns, promised to [[veto]] the bill should it be enacted into law by Congress. The Senate's version of the Whistleblower Protection Act (S. 274) was approved by the [[Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]] on June 13, 2007. However, that version failed to reach a vote by the Senate, as Coburn placed a hold on the bill; effectively preventing the passage of the bill, which had [[bipartisan]] support in the Senate.<ref name=\"blackwater\" />\n\nCoburn's website features a news item about [[United Nations]] whistleblower Mathieu Credo Koumoin, a former employee for the U.N. Development Program in West Africa, who has asked U.N. ethics chief [[Robert Benson (United Nations ethics chief)|Robert Benson]] for protection under the U.N.'s new whistleblower protection rules.<ref name=\": Senator Tom Coburn's Oversight Action :: Latest News :\" /> The site has a link to the \"United Nations Watch\" of the Republican Office of the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]]' Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information and International Security, of which he was the ranking minority member.<ref name=\": Senator Tom Coburn's Oversight Action :: Issues :\" /> Coburn's website also features a tip line for potential whistleblowers on [[government waste]] and fraud.<ref name=\": Senator Tom Coburn's Oversight Action :: Submit a Tip :\" />\n\n====Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations====\nCoburn joined Congressmen [[Sue Myrick]] (R-[[North Carolina|NC]]), [[Trent Franks]] (R-[[Arizona|AZ]]), [[John Shadegg]] (R-AZ), [[Paul Broun]] (R-[[Georgia (U.S. state)|GA]]) and [[Patrick McHenry]] (R-NC) in a letter to [[IRS Commissioner]] [[Douglas H. Shulman]] on November 16, 2009, asking that the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) be investigated for excessive lobbying and failing to register as a lobbying organization.<ref name=\"talkingpointsmemo\" /> The request came in the wake of the publication of a book, ''[[Muslim Mafia]]'', the foreword of which had been penned by Myrick, that portrayed CAIR as a subversive organization allied with international [[terrorism|terrorists]].<ref name=\"co\" />\n\n====Criticism of the National Science Foundation====\nOn May 26, 2011 Coburn released his 73-page report, \"[[National Science Foundation: Under the Microscope]]\",<ref name=\"senate15\" /><ref name=\"senate16\" /> receiving immediate attention from such media outlets as ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Fox News]] and [[MSNBC]].<ref name=\"Sen.

The only way we can restore confidence in Congress is to make hard choices and solve real problems by doing things like reforming our tax code, repairing our safety net and reducing our crushing debt burden. Doing anything less will further alienate the American people and rightfully so.<ref name=\"Yut2Q\" />}}\n\n====Committee assignments====\nCoburn was a member of the following committees:\n* '''[[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]]''' (Ranking Member)\n** [[United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]]\n** [[United States Senate Homeland Security Subcommittee on Financial and Contracting Oversight|Subcommittee on Financial and Contracting Oversight]]\n** [[United States Senate Homeland Security Subcommittee on the Efficiency and Effectiveness of Federal Programs and the Federal Workforce|Subcommittee on the Efficiency and Effectiveness of Federal Programs and the Federal Workforce]]\n** [[United States Senate Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emergency Management, Intergovernmental Affairs, and the District of Columbia|Subcommittee on Emergency Management, Intergovernmental Affairs, and the District of Columbia]]\n* '''[[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Select Committee on Intelligence]]'''\n* '''[[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs]]'''\n** [[United States Senate Banking Subcommittee on Economic Policy|Subcommittee on Economic Policy]]\n** [[United States Senate Banking Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment|Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment]]\n** [[United States Senate Banking Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development|Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development]]\n\n==Political positions==\n===Abortion===\nCoburn opposed [[abortion in the United States|abortion]], with the exception of abortions necessary to save the life of the mother. In 2000, he sponsored a bill to prevent the [[Food and Drug Administration]] from developing, testing, or approving the [[abortifacient]] [[RU-486]]. On July 13, the bill failed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 182 to 187.<ref name=\"RU-486 Abortion Pill: Developments during 1999 & 2000\" /> On the issue, Coburn sparked controversy with his remark, \"I favor the death penalty for abortionists and other people who take life.\"<ref name=\"Romano\" /><ref name=\"Democrats, Abortion and 'Alfie'\" /> He noted that his great-grandmother was [[rape]]d by a sheriff.<ref name=\"Life Begins at Conversation (page 2)\" />\n\nCoburn was one of the original authors of the federal [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] upheld by the United States Supreme Court in ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''.<ref name=\"commerce\" /> The act relied on an expansive view of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]'s [[Commerce Clause]], as it applies to \"any [[physician]] who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a [[partial-birth abortion]].\"<ref name=\"commerce\" /> The [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Act]]'s reliance on such a broad reading of the [[Commerce Clause]] was criticized by [[Independence Institute]] scholar [[David Kopel]] and [[University of Tennessee College of Law|University of Tennessee]] law professor [[Glenn Reynolds]], who noted that \"[u]nless a physician is operating a mobile abortion clinic on the [[Metroliner (Amtrak)|Metroliner]], it is not really possible to perform an abortion 'in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce.'\"<ref name=\"davekopel\" /> When Coburn later called Supreme Court nominee [[Elena Kagan]] \"ignorant\" due to her \"very expansive view\" of the [[Commerce Clause]], his support for the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Act]] was used  by Kagan supporters who charged him with hypocrisy on the issue.<ref name=\"commerce\" />\n\nOn September 14, 2005, during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee [[John G. Roberts]], Coburn began his opening statement with a critique of [[Inside the Beltway (terminology)|Beltway]] [[partisan (political)|partisan politics]] while, according to news reports, \"choking back a sob.\"<ref name=\"WP\" /> Coburn had earlier been completing a [[crossword puzzle]] during the hearings,<ref name=\"WP\" /> and this fact was highlighted by ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' to ridicule Coburn's [[pathos]].<ref name=\"TDS on the Roberts Hearing\" /> Coburn then began his questioning by discussing the various legal terms mentioned during the previous day's hearings. Proceeding to questions regarding both abortion and end-of-life issues, Coburn, who noted that during his tenure as an obstetrician he had delivered some 4,000 babies, asked Roberts whether the judge agreed with the proposition that \"the opposite of being dead is being alive.\"\n\n{{quote|You know I'm going somewhere. One of the problems I have is coming up with just the common sense and logic that if brain wave and heartbeat signifies life, the absence of them signifies death, then the presence of them certainly signifies life. And to say it otherwise, logically is schizophrenic. And that's how I view a lot of the decisions that have come from the Supreme Court on the issue of abortion.<ref name=\"Transcript: Day Three of the Roberts Confirmation Hearings\" />}}\n\n===Fiscal conservatism===\n[[File:Coburn and Obama discuss S. 2590.jpg|thumb|Senators Coburn and [[Barack Obama]] discuss S. 2590 in 2006]]\n[[File:Coburn and Obama greet Bush.jpg|thumb|Senators Coburn and Obama and Congressman [[Jeb Hensarling]] greet President [[George W. Bush]] at the signing ceremony of the [[Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006]]]]\nThe best-known of Coburn's amendments was an amendment to the fiscal 2006 [[appropriations bill]] that funds transportation projects.<ref name=\"loc5\" /> Coburn's amendment would have transferred funding from the [[Gravina Island Bridge|Bridge to Nowhere]] in [[Alaska]] to rebuild [[Louisiana]]'s \"Twin Spans\" bridge, which was devastated by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The amendment was defeated in the Senate, 82\u201314, after [[Ted Stevens]], the senior senator from Alaska, threatened to resign his office if the amendment were passed. Coburn's actions did result in getting the funds made into a more politically feasible [[block grant]] to the State of Alaska, which can use the funds for the bridge or other projects. The renovations for the [[Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania|Elizabethtown]] [[Elizabethtown (Amtrak station)|Amtrak Station]] were cited by Coburn as an example of [[pork barrel]] spending in the stimulus bill.<ref name=\"3I1Le\" />\n\nCoburn was also a member of the [[Fiscal Watch Team]], a group of seven senators led by [[John McCain]], whose stated goal is to combat \"wasteful government spending.\"<ref name=\"McCain calls for spending offsets to ensure fiscal responsibility\" />{{clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}}\n\nOn April 6, 2006, Coburn and Senators [[Barack Obama]], [[Thomas Carper]] and [[John McCain]] introduced the [[Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006]].<ref name=\"s2590introduced\" /> The bill requires the full disclosure of all entities and organizations receiving [[federal funds]] beginning in fiscal year (FY) 2007 on a website maintained by the [[Office of Management and Budget]]. The bill was signed into law on September 26, 2006.<ref name=\"s2590summary\" />\n\nCoburn and McCain noted that the practice of members of Congress adding [[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]] had risen dramatically over the years, from 121 earmarks in 1987 to 15,268 earmarks in 2005, according to the [[Congressional Research Service]].<ref name=\"earmark\" />\n\nIn July 2007, Coburn criticized pork-barrel spending that Nebraska Senator [[Ben Nelson]] had inserted into the 2007 [[defense spending]] bill. Coburn said that the earmarks would benefit Nelson's son Patrick's employer with millions in federal dollars and that the situation violated terms of the Transparency Act, which was passed by the Senate but had not yet been voted on in the House. Nelson's spokesperson said the Senator did nothing wrong.<ref name=\"Omaha Company's Windfall, Hiring of Lawmaker's Son Irks Senator\" /> At that time, newspapers in [[Nebraska]] and Oklahoma noted that Coburn failed to criticize very similar earmarks that had benefited Oklahoma.<ref name=\"editorial\" />\n\nIn 1997, Coburn introduced a bill called the [[HIV Prevention Act of 1997]], which would have amended the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Act]]. The bill would have required confidential notification of [[HIV]] exposure to the sexual partners of those diagnosed with HIV, along with counseling and testing.<ref name=\"loc6\" />\n\nIn 2010, Coburn called for a freeze on defense spending.<ref name=\"senate7\" /> The following year, along with Democratic [[Maryland]] Senator [[Ben Cardin]], he introduced a bill to \"get rid of the most venerable big [[Ethanol fuel|ethanol]] subsidy: the blenders tax credit.\"<ref name=\"washingtonexaminer\" /> Coburn served on the Simpson-Bowles debt reduction commission in 2010 and was one of the only Republicans in Congress open to tax increases as a means of balancing the budget.<ref name=\"cNZwF\" />\n\nIn 2011 Coburn broke with [[Americans for Tax Reform]] with an ethanol amendment that gathered 70 votes in the Senate. He said that anti-tax activist [[Grover Norquist]]'s influence was overstated, and that revenue increases were needed in order to \"fix the country.\"<ref name=\"politico8\" /><ref name=\"msn\" />\n\nIn 2012, Coburn identified less than $7 billion a year in possible defense savings and over half of these savings were to be through the elimination of military personnel involved in [[Military logistics|supply]], [[Military transportation|transportation]], and [[Military communications|communications]] services.<ref name=\"nLFEA\" />\n\nIn May 2013, after [[2013 Moore tornado|tornadoes ripped through his state]], Coburn said that any new funding allocated for disaster relief needed to be offset by cuts to other federal spending.<ref name=\"UicWS\" />\n\nCoburn was a fierce critic of the plan to attempt to defund the [[Affordable Care Act]] by [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|shutting down the federal government]], saying that the strategy was \"doomed to fail\" and that [[Ted Cruz]] and others who supported the plan had a \"short-term goal with lousy tactics\".<ref name=\"battling\" />\n\n===Gun rights===\nIn regards to the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]], Coburn believed that it \"recognizes the right of individual, law-abiding citizens to own and use [[firearm]]s,\" and he opposed \"any and all efforts to mandate [[gun control]] on law-abiding citizens.\"<ref name=\"Issue Statements \u2013 Second Amendment\" /> On the [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]], which aimed \"to establish fair and transparent practices relating to the extension of credit under an open-end consumer credit plan and for other purposes,\"<ref name=\"Read The Bill: H.R. 627\" /> Coburn sponsored an amendment that would allow [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed carry]] of firearms in [[U.S. National Park Service|national parks]].

However, these talks ultimately broke down, and in April 2013, Coburn was one of 46 senators to vote against the amendment in its final form, defeating its passage.<ref name=\"VomNG\" /><ref name=\"8aFjl\" />\n\n===Health care reform===\n[[File:U.S. Senator Tom Coburn speaking at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland.jpg|thumb|Senator Coburn at the 2014 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC) in Maryland]]\nCoburn voted against the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] in December 2009,<ref name=\"senate\" /> and against the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]].<ref name=\"senate2\" />\n\nCoburn co-authored the Patients Choice Act of 2009<ref name=\"kO326\" /> (S. 1099), a Republican plan for [[health care reform in the United States]],<ref name=\"The GOP's Health-Care Alternative \u2013 WSJ.com\" /> which in part 1) Requires the U.S. [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) to convene an interagency coordinating committee to develop a national strategic plan for prevention. The act provided for health promotion and disease prevention activities consistent with such a plan. Secondly it set forth provisions governing the establishment and operation of state-based health care exchanges to facilitate the individual purchase of private health insurance and the creation of a market where private health plans compete for enrollees based on price and quality. Thirdly it intended to amend the [[Internal Revenue Code]] to allow a refundable tax credit for qualified health care insurance coverage. Fourth it sets forth programs to prevent Medicare fraud and abuse, including ending the use of social security numbers to identify Medicare beneficiaries. Fifth it sought to terminate the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]].<ref name=\"loc\" />\n\n===Presidential nominations to the Judicial and Executive branches of government===\nDuring the [[George W. Bush administration|administration of President George W. Bush]], Coburn spoke out against the threat by some Democrats to [[filibuster]] nominations to judicial and [[Executive Branch]] positions. He took the position that no presidential nomination should ever be filibustered, in light of the wording of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. Coburn said, \"There is a defined charge to the president and the Senate on advice and consent.\"<ref name=\"Coburn, Inhofe ready for end to nominee drama\" />\n\nIn May 2009, Coburn was the only Senator to vote against the confirmation of [[Gil Kerlikowske]] as the [[Director of the National Drug Control Policy]].<ref name=\"senate9\" />\n\n===Same-sex marriage===\nCoburn opposed [[same-sex marriage]]. In 2006, he voted in support of a proposed constitutional amendment to ban it.<ref name=\"AbdAS\" />\n\n===War in Iraq===\nOn May 24, 2007, the U.S. Senate voted 80\u201314 to fund the [[war in Iraq]], which included [[U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007]]. Coburn voted nay.<ref name=\"senate3\" /> On October 1, 2007, the Senate voted 92\u20133 to fund the war in Iraq.

The bill would require a report on successful veteran suicide prevention programs and allow the [[United States Veterans Administration]] to pay incentives to hire psychiatrists. Paul Rieckhoff, CEO of [[Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America]], said that despite his reputation as a budget hawk, Coburn should have recognized that the $22 million cost of the bill is worth the lives it would have saved.  \"It's a shame that after two decades of service in Washington, Sen. Coburn will always be remembered for this final, misguided attack on veterans nationwide,\" he said. \"If it takes 90 days for the new Congress to re-pass this bill, the statistics tell us another 1,980 vets will have died by suicide. That should be a heavy burden on the conscience of Sen. Coburn and this Congress.\" Speaking out against the legislation, Coburn said \"I object, not because I don't want to save suicides, but because I don't think this bill will do the first thing to change what's happening,\" arguing that the bill\" \"throws money and doesn't solve the real problem\"<ref name=\"f25Y1\" />\n\n==Post-Senate career==\nAfter resigning from the U.S. Senate, Coburn joined [[Citizens for Self-Governance]] as a senior advisor to the group's Convention of States project, which seeks to convene a [[convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution]].<ref name=\"YfxzN\" /><ref name=\"9gdol\" /> In 2017, he authored a book on the subject titled ''Smashing the DC Monopoly: Using Article V to Restore Freedom and Stop Runaway Government''.<ref name=\"5cFlO\" />\n\nCoburn was affiliated with the [[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]], consulting on the Institute's Project FDA, an effort to promote faster drug approval processes.<ref name=\"Cunningham\" /> In 2016, he became a Manhattan Institute senior fellow.<ref name=\"MI\" />\n\n==Awards==\nIn 2013, Coburn received the [[Heinz Awards|U.S. Senator John Heinz Award]] for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by the [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Awards]].<ref name=\"YmoY4\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nIn spite of their ideological differences, Coburn was a friend of President [[Barack Obama]]. They became friends in 2005 when they both [[United States Senate elections, 2004|arrived in the Senate]] at the same time.<ref name=\"president\" /> They worked together on [[political ethics]] reform legislation,<ref name=\"thehill\" /> to set up an online federal spending database and to crack down on [[no-bid contract]]ing at the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. In April 2011, Coburn spoke to [[Bloomberg TV]] about Obama, saying, \"I love the man. I think he's a neat man. I don't want him to be president, but I still love him. He is our President. He's my President. And I disagree with him adamantly on 95% of the issues, but that doesn't mean I can't have a great relationship.

White begins the fight for the {{chessgloss|centre}} by staking a claim to the d5-square from the wing, in [[Hypermodernism (chess)|hypermodern]] style. Although many lines of the English have a distinct character, the opening is often used as a [[transposition (chess)|transpositional]] device in much the same way as 1.Nf3 \u2013 to avoid such highly regarded responses to 1.d4 as the [[Nimzo-Indian Defence|Nimzo-Indian]] and [[Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence|Gr\u00fcnfeld]] Defences, and is considered reliable and flexible.<ref>{{cite book |year=2004 |title=Chess Life |edition=1\u20137 |publisher=[[United States Chess Federation]] |volume=59 |page=303 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWNLAAAAYAAJ&q=%22The+English+opening+is+a%22}}</ref>\n\nThe English derives its name from the English (unofficial) [[World Chess Champion|world champion]] [[Howard Staunton]], who played it during his 1843 match with [[Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant|Saint-Amant]] and at [[London 1851 chess tournament|London 1851]], the first international tournament.<ref name=\"De Firmian 2008 675\">{{cite book |last=de Firmian |first=Nick |authorlink=Nick de Firmian |year=2008 |title=[[Modern Chess Openings]]: MCO-15 |publisher=David McKay Co. |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8129-3682-7 |pages=675}}</ref> It did not inspire Staunton's contemporaries and caught on only in the twentieth century.<ref name=\"De Firmian 2008 675\"/> It is now recognised as a {{chessgloss|solid}} opening that may be used to reach both classical and hypermodern positions. [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], [[Tigran Petrosian]], [[Anatoly Karpov]], [[Garry Kasparov]], and [[Magnus Carlsen]] employed it during their world championship matches. [[Bobby Fischer]] created a stir when he switched to it from his customary [[King's Pawn Game|1.e4]] late in his career, employing it against [[Lev Polugaevsky]] and [[Oscar Panno]] at the [[Palma de Mallorca]] [[Interzonal]] in 1970, and in his [[World Chess Championship 1972|world championship match]] against [[Boris Spassky]].\n{{AN chess|pos=toc}}\n\n==Taxonomy==\nOpening theoreticians who write on the English Opening divide it into three broad categories, generally determined by Black's choice of defensive setup.\n\n===Symmetrical Defence: 1...c5 {{anchor|Symmetrical Defence}}===\nThe Symmetrical Defence (classified A30\u201339 in ''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings|ECO]]'')is 1...c5, and is so named because both of the c-pawns are advanced two squares, maintaining symmetry. Note that Black can reach the Symmetrical Defence through many move orders by deferring ...c5, and often does. For example, 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 (or 2.Nf3) c5 is a Symmetrical Defence even though Black played ...Nf6 before ...c5.\n\nThere are several types of positions that can arise from the Symmetrical Defence. Among the ideas are:<ref>{{cite book |last=Cummings |first=David |date=October 1, 2001 |title=Symmetrical English |publisher=Everyman Chess |isbn=978-1-85744-292-2}}</ref>\n*The [[Hedgehog (chess)|Hedgehog system]]<ref>{{cite book |last=de Firmian |first=Nick |authorlink=Nick de Firmian |year=1999 |title=[[Modern Chess Openings]]: MCO-14 |publisher=David McKay Co. |location=New York |isbn=0-8129-3084-3 |pages=661\u201365}}</ref> involves a solid but flexible defence in which Black develops by b6, e6, Bb7, and Be7, before controlling the fifth rank with moves such as a6 and d6. The game typically involves extended maneuvering, but both players need to be on the lookout for favourable pawn advances and {{chessgloss|pawn breaks}}.\n*The double fianchetto defence involves Black developing both bishops by [[fianchetto]] to g7 and b7. The line is fairly solid and difficult to defeat at the grandmaster level. Some lines are considered highly drawish, for instance if White's bishops are also fianchettoed to g2 and b2 there may be many simplifications leading to a simplified and equal position.\nEither player may make an early break in the centre with the d-pawn.\n*An early d2\u2013d4 for White can arise in 1.c4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.d4. Since this position is often reached after the transposition 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.Nf3, where White avoided the [[Benoni Defense]] that would arise after 3.d5, this line is often called the Anti-Benoni. The games can give a large variety of positional and tactical ideas. Games usually continue with 3...cxd4 4.Nxd4 when Black can choose between the sharp 4...e5 or more sedate moves like the Hedgehog-like 4...b6 or the more common 4...e6.\n*A typical line of play where Black plays an early d5 is 1.c4 c5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Nf3 d5, when White usually trades off in the centre 4.cxd5 Nxd5. White can either challenge the centre with 5.d4 or 5.e4 or allow Black a {{chessgloss|space}} advantage in the centre with 5.g3. In the latter case, Black can play 5...Nc6 6.Bg2 Nc7 followed by 7...e5, reaching a reversed [[Mar\u00f3czy Bind]] position called the Rubinstein System.\n\n===Reversed Sicilian: 1...e5 {{anchor|Reversed Sicilian}}===\nThe Reversed Sicilian (classified A20\u201329 in {{italics correction|''ECO''}}) is another broad category of defence, introduced by the response 1...e5. Note again, that Black can delay playing ...e5, for example 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Nf3 e5 whereupon even though ...e5 has been delayed, once it is played the defence is classified as a Reversed Sicilian.\n\nAfter 1...e5, White has Black's position in the Sicilian but with an extra [[Tempo (chess)|tempo]]. This is often called the Reversed [[Sicilian Defence|Sicilian]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Weeks |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Weeks |title=Chess Opening Tutorial : English \u2013 1...e5 |publisher=About, Inc. |url=http://chess.about.com/od/improveyouropenings/ss/aa05i17_2.htm |accessdate=2008-01-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203113232/http://chess.about.com/od/improveyouropenings/ss/aa05i17_2.htm |archivedate=December 3, 2007}}</ref> though others call it the King's English.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kasparov |first1=Gary |author-link1=Garry Kasparov |last2=Keene |first2=Raymond |author-link2=Raymond Keene |date=1982 |title=Batsford Chess Openings |publisher=B.T.Batsford Ltd |isbn=0-7134-2114-2}}</ref> Bruce Leverett, writing the English chapter in ''[[Modern Chess Openings|MCO-14]]'', stated, \"It is natural to treat the English as a Sicilian reversed, but the results are often surprising\u2014main lines in the Sicilian Defence correspond to obscure side variations in the English, and vice versa.\"\n\n===Other lines===\nThe third broad category are the non-...e5 and non-...c5 responses, classified A10\u201319 in ''ECO''. Most often these defences consist of ...Nf6, ...e6, and ...d5 or ...Bb4 systemic responses by Black, or a [[Slav Defense|Slav]]-like system consisting of ...c6 and ...d5, a direct [[King's Indian Defence]] setup with ...Nf6, ...g6, ...Bg7, ...0-0, after which ...c5 and ...e5 are eschewed, or 1...f5, which usually transposes to a [[Dutch Defence]] once White plays d4. All irregular responses such as 1...b6 and 1...g5 are also lumped into this third broad category.\n\nCommon responses include:<ref name=\"shredder_opening\"/>\n*'''1...Nf6''' <br />The most common response to 1.c4, often played to arrive at an [[Indian Defence]]. However, more than half the time, Black subsequently elects to transpose into either a Symmetrical Defence with ...c5, or a Reversed Sicilian with ...e5.\n*'''1...e6''' <br />Can lead to a [[Queen's Gambit Declined]] after 2.Nc3 d5 3.d4, but White often prefers 2.Nf3, which may lead to a variety of openings.\n*'''1...f5''' <br />Leads to a [[Dutch Defence]] when White follows up with d4. Other choices for White are 2.Nc3, 2.Nf3, and 2.g3, where Black usually plays ...Nf6.\n*'''1...g6''' <br />May lead to a [[Modern Defense]] or after Nf6 and d6 or d5 to the [[King's Indian Defence]] or the [[Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence]], respectively, or stay within English lines. Often dubbed the Great Snake variation.\n*'''1...c6''' <br />Can lead to a [[Slav Defense]] after 2.d4 d5, but White will often prefer a [[Caro\u2013Kann Defence]] with 2.e4 d5, or a [[R\u00e9ti Opening]] after 2.Nf3 d5 3.b3.\n*'''1...b6''' <br />The [[English Defence]]. This setup involves the fianchetto of the queenside bishop and 2...e6. Often Black will defer the move ....Nf6, choosing to attack the centre with ...f5 and/or ...Qh4. The English [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmasters]] [[Tony Miles]] and [[Jonathan Speelman]] have successfully used this opening.\n*'''1...d5''' <br />The Anglo-Scandinavian Defense.<ref>https://www.chess.com/openings/A10-English-Opening-Anglo-Scandinavian-Defense</ref> Thought of as inferior to the Scandinavian defense due to exchanging the c pawn for a center pawn, in addition to the Scandinavian already having a somewhat suspect reputation. \n*'''1...g5''' <br />An eccentric response known as '''Myers' Defense''' after [[Hugh Myers]]' advocacy of it in print and actual play.<ref name=\"ChessBaseobit\">[[ChessBase.com]], [http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=5113 Hugh Myers (1930\u20132008), opening theoretician] (2008-12-25).

White begins the fight for the {{chessgloss|centre}} by staking a claim to the d5-square from the wing, in [[Hypermodernism (chess)|hypermodern]] style. Although many lines of the English have a distinct character, the opening is often used as a [[transposition (chess)|transpositional]] device in much the same way as 1.Nf3 \u2013 to avoid such highly regarded responses to 1.d4 as the [[Nimzo-Indian Defence|Nimzo-Indian]] and [[Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence|Gr\u00fcnfeld]] Defences, and is considered reliable and flexible.<ref>{{cite book |year=2004 |title=Chess Life |edition=1\u20137 |publisher=[[United States Chess Federation]] |volume=59 |page=303 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWNLAAAAYAAJ&q=%22The+English+opening+is+a%22}}</ref>\n\nThe English derives its name from the English (unofficial) [[World Chess Champion|world champion]] [[Howard Staunton]], who played it during his 1843 match with [[Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant|Saint-Amant]] and at [[London 1851 chess tournament|London 1851]], the first international tournament.<ref name=\"De Firmian 2008 675\">{{cite book |last=de Firmian |first=Nick |authorlink=Nick de Firmian |year=2008 |title=[[Modern Chess Openings]]: MCO-15 |publisher=David McKay Co. |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8129-3682-7 |pages=675}}</ref> It did not inspire Staunton's contemporaries and caught on only in the twentieth century.<ref name=\"De Firmian 2008 675\"/> It is now recognised as a {{chessgloss|solid}} opening that may be used to reach both classical and hypermodern positions. [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], [[Tigran Petrosian]], [[Anatoly Karpov]], [[Garry Kasparov]], and [[Magnus Carlsen]] employed it during their world championship matches. [[Bobby Fischer]] created a stir when he switched to it from his customary [[King's Pawn Game|1.e4]] late in his career, employing it against [[Lev Polugaevsky]] and [[Oscar Panno]] at the [[Palma de Mallorca]] [[Interzonal]] in 1970, and in his [[World Chess Championship 1972|world championship match]] against [[Boris Spassky]].\n{{AN chess|pos=toc}}\n\n==Taxonomy==\nOpening theoreticians who write on the English Opening divide it into three broad categories, generally determined by Black's choice of defensive setup.\n\n===Symmetrical Defence: 1...c5 {{anchor|Symmetrical Defence}}===\nThe Symmetrical Defence (classified A30\u201339 in ''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings|ECO]]''), which is 1...c5, and is so named because both of the c-pawns are advanced two squares, maintaining symmetry. Note that Black can reach the Symmetrical Defence through many move orders by deferring ...c5, and often does. For example, 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 (or 2.Nf3) c5 is a Symmetrical Defence even though Black played ...Nf6 before ...c5.\n\nThere are several types of positions that can arise from the Symmetrical Defence. Among the ideas are:<ref>{{cite book |last=Cummings |first=David |date=October 1, 2001 |title=Symmetrical English |publisher=Everyman Chess |isbn=978-1-85744-292-2}}</ref>\n*The [[Hedgehog (chess)|Hedgehog system]]<ref>{{cite book |last=de Firmian |first=Nick |authorlink=Nick de Firmian |year=1999 |title=[[Modern Chess Openings]]: MCO-14 |publisher=David McKay Co. |location=New York |isbn=0-8129-3084-3 |pages=661\u201365}}</ref> involves a solid but flexible defence in which Black develops by b6, e6, Bb7, and Be7, before controlling the fifth rank with moves such as a6 and d6. The game typically involves extended maneuvering, but both players need to be on the lookout for favourable pawn advances and {{chessgloss|pawn breaks}}.\n*The double fianchetto defence involves Black developing both bishops by [[fianchetto]] to g7 and b7. The line is fairly solid and difficult to defeat at the grandmaster level. Some lines are considered highly drawish, for instance if White's bishops are also fianchettoed to g2 and b2 there may be many simplifications leading to a simplified and equal position.\nEither player may make an early break in the centre with the d-pawn.\n*An early d2\u2013d4 for White can arise in 1.c4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.d4. Since this position is often reached after the transposition 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.Nf3, where White avoided the [[Benoni Defense]] that would arise after 3.d5, this line is often called the Anti-Benoni. The games can give a large variety of positional and tactical ideas. Games usually continue with 3...cxd4 4.Nxd4 when Black can choose between the sharp 4...e5 or more sedate moves like the Hedgehog-like 4...b6 or the more common 4...e6.\n*A typical line of play where Black plays an early d5 is 1.c4 c5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Nf3 d5, when White usually trades off in the centre 4.cxd5 Nxd5. White can either challenge the centre with 5.d4 or 5.e4 or allow Black a {{chessgloss|space}} advantage in the centre with 5.g3. In the latter case, Black can play 5...Nc6 6.Bg2 Nc7 followed by 7...e5, reaching a reversed [[Mar\u00f3czy Bind]] position called the Rubinstein System.\n\n===Reversed Sicilian: 1...e5 {{anchor|Reversed Sicilian}}===\nThe Reversed Sicilian (classified A20\u201329 in {{italics correction|''ECO''}}) is another broad category of defence, introduced by the response 1...e5. Note again, that Black can delay playing ...e5, for example 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Nf3 e5 whereupon even though ...e5 has been delayed, once it is played the defence is classified as a Reversed Sicilian.\n\nAfter 1...e5, White has Black's position in the Sicilian but with an extra [[Tempo (chess)|tempo]]. This is often called the Reversed [[Sicilian Defence|Sicilian]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Weeks |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Weeks |title=Chess Opening Tutorial : English \u2013 1...e5 |publisher=About, Inc. |url=http://chess.about.com/od/improveyouropenings/ss/aa05i17_2.htm |accessdate=2008-01-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203113232/http://chess.about.com/od/improveyouropenings/ss/aa05i17_2.htm |archivedate=December 3, 2007}}</ref> though others call it the King's English.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kasparov |first1=Gary |author-link1=Garry Kasparov |last2=Keene |first2=Raymond |author-link2=Raymond Keene |date=1982 |title=Batsford Chess Openings |publisher=B.T.Batsford Ltd |isbn=0-7134-2114-2}}</ref> Bruce Leverett, writing the English chapter in ''[[Modern Chess Openings|MCO-14]]'', stated, \"It is natural to treat the English as a Sicilian reversed, but the results are often surprising\u2014main lines in the Sicilian Defence correspond to obscure side variations in the English, and vice versa.\"\n\n===Other lines===\nThe third broad category are the non-...e5 and non-...c5 responses, classified A10\u201319 in ''ECO''. Most often these defences consist of ...Nf6, ...e6, and ...d5 or ...Bb4 systemic responses by Black, or a [[Slav Defense|Slav]]-like system consisting of ...c6 and ...d5, a direct [[King's Indian Defence]] setup with ...Nf6, ...g6, ...Bg7, ...0-0, after which ...c5 and ...e5 are eschewed, or 1...f5, which usually transposes to a [[Dutch Defence]] once White plays d4. All irregular responses such as 1...b6 and 1...g5 are also lumped into this third broad category.\n\nCommon responses include:<ref name=\"shredder_opening\"/>\n*'''1...Nf6''' <br />The most common response to 1.c4, often played to arrive at an [[Indian Defence]].

Other choices for White are 2.Nc3, 2.Nf3, and 2.g3, where Black usually plays ...Nf6.\n*'''1...g6''' <br />May lead to a [[Modern Defense]] or after Nf6 and d6 or d5 to the [[King's Indian Defence]] or the [[Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence]], respectively, or stay within English lines. Often dubbed the Great Snake variation.\n*'''1...c6''' <br />Can lead to a [[Slav Defense]] after 2.d4 d5, but White will often prefer a [[Caro\u2013Kann Defence]] with 2.e4 d5, or a [[R\u00e9ti Opening]] after 2.Nf3 d5 3.b3.\n*'''1...b6''' <br />The [[English Defence]]. This setup involves the fianchetto of the queenside bishop and 2...e6. Often Black will defer the move ....Nf6, choosing to attack the centre with ...f5 and/or ...Qh4.

If Black plays instead 1...Nf6 2.Nc3 e6, White can avoid the QGD by playing 3.e4, the '''Flohr\u2013Mikenas Attack'''.\n\n==''ECO''==\nThe ''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings]]'' has classified the English Opening under the codes A10 through A39:\n*A10 1.c4\n*A11 1.c4 c6\n*A12 1.c4 c6 2.Nf3 d5 3.b3\n*A13 1.c4 e6\n*A14 1.c4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.g3 Nf6 4.Bg2 Be7 5.0-0\n*A15 1.c4 Nf6\n*A16 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3\n*A17 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 e6\n*A18 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 e6 3.e4 ([[Mikenas\u2013Carls Variation]])\n*A19 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 e6 3.e4 c5\n*A20 1.c4 e5\n*A21 1.c4 e5 2.Nc3\n*A22 1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6\n*A23 1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.g3 c6 ([[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] System, [[Paul Keres|Keres]] Variation)\n*A24 1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.g3 g6 (Bremen System with ...g6)\n*A25 1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6\n*A26 1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.d3 d6\n*A27 1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. c4/1...e5/2.

Both Holmes and Moriarty eventually play the final moves [[Blindfold chess|blindfolded]] by citing out the last moves in [[descriptive notation]] (rather than [[Algebraic notation (chess)|algebraic]], as the former was contemporary in the late 19th century), ending in Holmes checkmating Moriarty, just as [[Dr. Watson|Watson]] foils Moriarty's plans.\n\n1.c4 is also used in ''[[Pawn Sacrifice]]'' by [[Bobby Fischer]] in the climactic [[1972 World Chess Championship#Game 6|game six]] of the [[1972 World Chess Championship]] versus [[Boris Spassky]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of chess openings]]\n* [[List of chess openings named after places]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book\n | last1=Kallai |first1=Gabor |authorlink1=Gabor Kallai\n | last2=Ribli |first2=Zolt\u00e1n |authorlink2=Zolt\u00e1n Ribli\n | year=1993\n | title=Winning With the English\n | publisher=Henry Holt\n | isbn=978-0-8050-2642-9}}\n*{{cite book\n | last=Kosten |first=Tony |authorlink=Anthony Kosten\n | year=1999\n | title=The Dynamic English\n | publisher=Gambit Publications\n | isbn=978-1-901983-14-2}}\n*{{cite book\n | last=Hansen |first=Carsten |authorlink=Carsten Hansen (chess player)\n | year=2001\n | title=The Symmetrical English\n | publisher=Gambit\n | isbn=978-1-901983-40-1}}\n*{{cite book\n | last=Pritchett |first=Craig |authorlink=Craig Pritchett\n | year=2008\n | title=Play the English\n | publisher=Everyman Chess\n | isbn=978-1-85744-545-9}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikibooks|Chess Opening Theory|1. c4|English Opening}}\n*[http://www.chessvideos.tv/chess-opening-database/search/english-opening Database Of English Opening Variations]\n\n{{Chess|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Chess openings]]\n[[Category:1843 in chess]]\n[[Category:Chess in England]]\n", "name_user": "Ricklaman", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSymmetrical Defence: 1...c5 {{anchor|Symmetrical Defence}}", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Opening"}
