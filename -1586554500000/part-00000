Retrieved 3 February 2013</ref> The film received mixed reviews and grossed $321.7 million against its $200 million budget, thus being considered a box office disappointment.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Anchor|Premise}}\nIn the year 1199, [[Robin Hood|Robin Longstride]] serves as a common [[archery|archer]] in the army of [[Richard I of England|King Richard the Lionheart]]. A veteran of [[Third Crusade|Richard's crusade]], he now takes part in the siege of [[Ch\u00e2teau de Ch\u00e2lus-Chabrol|Chalus Castle]]. Disillusioned and war-weary, he gives a frank but unflattering appraisal of the King's conduct when the King asks his opinion, and Robin and his comrades\u2014archers [[Alan-a-Dale|Allan A'Dayle]] and [[Will Scarlett]] and soldier [[Little John]]\u2014find themselves in the [[stocks]].\n\nWhen the King is slain during an attack on the castle, Robin and his men decide to free themselves and desert. They come across an ambush of the English royal guard by Godfrey, an English knight who has conspired with [[Philip II of France|King Philip of France]] to assassinate King Richard. After chasing Godfrey away, Robin decides to take advantage of the situation by having his men impersonate the dead English knights to return to England. Before they depart to sail across the Channel, Robin promises one of the dying knights, Sir Robert Loxley, to return his sword to his father in [[Nottingham]].\n\nAwaking to find his party in the Thames estuary, Robin must continue to assume the identity of Loxley to inform the royal family of King Richard's death. He witnesses the coronation of [[John, King of England|King John]], who orders the collection of harsh new taxes and dispatches Godfrey to the [[Northern England|North]] to do so\u2014unaware that Godfrey will instead use French troops to stir up unrest and to prepare for King Philip to invade England.\n\nRobin and his companions head to Nottingham, where Loxley's elderly and blind father, Sir Walter, asks him to continue impersonating his son to prevent the Crown from seizing the Loxley family lands. Loxley's widow, [[Maid Marian|Lady Marian]], is initially cold toward Robin, but warms to him when he and his men merrily recover [[tithe]]d grain for the townsfolk to plant.\n\nGodfrey's actions incite the northern barons, who march to meet King John. Speaking now for Sir Walter, Robin proposes that King John agree to a [[Charter of the Forest|charter of rights]] to ensure the rights of every Englishman and to unite his country. Having realised Godfrey's deception, and knowing he must meet the French invasion with an army, the King agrees. Meanwhile, French marauders plunder Nottingham. Robin and the northern barons arrive to stop Godfrey's men, but not before Godfrey has slain the blind Sir Walter.\n\nAs the main French expeditionary force begins its invasion of England on a beach below the [[cliffs of Dover]], Robin leads the now united English army against them. In the midst of the battle, Robin duels with Godfrey, who attempts to kill Marian and flees until Robin finally kills him with an arrow from afar. King Philip realises that his plan to divide England has failed and calls off his invasion. When King John sees the French surrendering to Robin instead of to himself, he senses a threat to his power. In London, King John reneges on his promise to sign the charter and declares Robin an [[outlaw]] to be hunted throughout the kingdom. The [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] announces the decree, and Robin and his men flee to [[Sherwood Forest]] with the orphans of Nottingham. Marian narrates their new life in the greenwood, noting that they live in equality as they right the many wrongs in the kingdom of King John. \"And so the legend begins.\"\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as [[Robin Hood|Robin Longstride]]\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Maid Marian|Marian Loxley]]\n* [[William Hurt]] as [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshal]]<ref>{{cite news|author=Borys Kit |title=William Hurt jousting for Robin Hood role |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=12 April 2009 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3iddc0608768893d1e82e7cae7eec09ccd |accessdate=13 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414080023/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3iddc0608768893d1e82e7cae7eec09ccd |archivedate=14 April 2009 }}</ref>\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Sir Godfrey, Prince John's henchman\n* [[Mark Addy]] as [[Friar Tuck]]\n* [[Oscar Isaac]] as [[John, King of England|Prince John]], the younger brother of King Richard\n* [[Danny Huston]] as [[Richard I of England|King Richard the Lionheart]]\n* [[Eileen Atkins]] as [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], King Richard and Prince John's mother\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as Sir Walter Loxley of Peper Harow\n* [[Kevin Durand]] as [[Little John]]<ref name=\"trio\">{{cite journal|first=Borys |last=Kit |title=Trio join Ridley Scott's Robin Hood film |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=9 March 2009 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ia82652ffac56b32e4e4fe4b83a847fe8 |accessdate=10 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311043113/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ia82652ffac56b32e4e4fe4b83a847fe8 |archivedate=11 March 2009 }}</ref>\n* [[Scott Grimes]] as [[Will Scarlet]]\n* [[Matthew Macfadyen]] as the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]]<ref>{{cite news | author = Peter Sciretta | title = Ridley Scott Casts Matthew Macfadyen as The Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood | work = SlashFilm | date = 24 April 2009 | url = http://www.slashfilm.com/2009/04/24/ridley-scott-casts-matthew-macfadyen-as-the-sheriff-of-nottingham-in-robin-hood/ | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120911055743/http://www.slashfilm.com/2009/04/24/ridley-scott-casts-matthew-macfadyen-as-the-sheriff-of-nottingham-in-robin-hood/ | url-status=dead | archive-date = 11 September 2012 | accessdate = 24 April 2009 }}</ref>\n* [[Alan Doyle]] as [[Alan-a-Dale|Allan A'Dayle]]<ref name=\"trio\" />\n* [[L\u00e9a Seydoux]] as [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame]], wife of Prince John and the French king's niece\n* [[Jonathan Zacca\u00ef]] as [[Philip II of France|King Philip of France]]\n* [[Douglas Hodge]] as Sir Robert Loxley\n* [[Robert Pugh]] as Baron Baldwin\n* [[Gerard McSorley]] as [[Walter Fitz Robert|Baron FitzRobert]]\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as Father Tancred \n* [[Mark Lewis Jones]] as Thomas Longstride, Robin's father\n* [[Denis Menochet]] as Adhemar, the aide to the French King\n* [[Jessica Raine]] as [[Isabel, Countess of Gloucester|Isabel of Gloucester]], John's first wife\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn January 2007, [[Universal Studios]] and [[Brian Grazer]]'s [[Imagine Entertainment]] acquired a [[spec script]] written by Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris, creators of the TV series ''[[Sleeper Cell (TV series)|Sleeper Cell]]''.

a 2010 [[Epic film|epic]] [[Historical film|historical drama film]] based on the [[Robin Hood]] legend, directed by [[Ridley Scott]] and starring [[Russell Crowe]], [[Cate Blanchett]], [[William Hurt]], [[Mark Strong]], [[Mark Addy]], [[Oscar Isaac]], [[Danny Huston]], [[Eileen Atkins]], and [[Max von Sydow]]. It was released in 12 countries on 12 May 2010, including the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] and was also the opening film at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]] the same day. It was released in a further 23 countries the following day, among them [[Australia]], and an additional 17 countries on 14 May 2010, among them the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].<ref name=IMDbReleaseDates>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0955308/releaseinfo IMDb: ''Release dates for Robin Hood'']. Retrieved 3 February 2013</ref> The film received mixed reviews and grossed $321.7 million against its $200 million budget, thus being considered a box office disappointment.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Anchor|Premise}}\nIn the year 1199, [[Robin Hood|Robin Longstride]] serves as a common [[archery|archer]] in the army of [[Richard I of England|King Richard the Lionheart]]. A veteran of [[Third Crusade|Richard's crusade]], he now takes part in the siege of [[Ch\u00e2teau de Ch\u00e2lus-Chabrol|Chalus Castle]]. Disillusioned and war-weary, he gives a frank but unflattering appraisal of the King's conduct when the King asks his opinion, and Robin and his comrades\u2014archers [[Alan-a-Dale|Allan A'Dayle]] and [[Will Scarlett]] and soldier [[Little John]]\u2014find themselves in the [[stocks]].\n\nWhen the King is slain during an attack on the castle, Robin and his men decide to free themselves and desert. They come across an ambush of the English royal guard by Godfrey, an English knight who has conspired with [[Philip II of France|King Philip of France]] to assassinate King Richard. After chasing Godfrey away, Robin decides to take advantage of the situation by having his men impersonate the dead English knights to return to England. Before they depart to sail across the Channel, Robin promises one of the dying knights, Sir Robert Loxley, to return his sword to his father in [[Nottingham]].\n\nAwaking to find his party in the Thames estuary, Robin must continue to assume the identity of Loxley to inform the royal family of King Richard's death. He witnesses the coronation of [[John, King of England|King John]], who orders the collection of harsh new taxes and dispatches Godfrey to the [[Northern England|North]] to do so\u2014unaware that Godfrey will instead use French troops to stir up unrest and to prepare for King Philip to invade England.\n\nRobin and his companions head to Nottingham, where Loxley's elderly and blind father, Sir Walter, asks him to continue impersonating his son to prevent the Crown from seizing the Loxley family lands. Loxley's widow, [[Maid Marian|Lady Marian]], is initially cold toward Robin, but warms to him when he and his men merrily recover [[tithe]]d grain for the townsfolk to plant.\n\nGodfrey's actions incite the northern barons, who march to meet King John. Speaking now for Sir Walter, Robin proposes that King John agree to a [[Charter of the Forest|charter of rights]] to ensure the rights of every Englishman and to unite his country. Having realised Godfrey's deception, and knowing he must meet the French invasion with an army, the King agrees. Meanwhile, French marauders plunder Nottingham. Robin and the northern barons arrive to stop Godfrey's men, but not before Godfrey has slain the blind Sir Walter.\n\nAs the main French expeditionary force begins its invasion of England on a beach below the [[cliffs of Dover]], Robin leads the now united English army against them. In the midst of the battle, Robin duels with Godfrey, who attempts to kill Marian and flees until Robin finally kills him with an arrow from afar. King Philip realises that his plan to divide England has failed and calls off his invasion. When King John sees the French surrendering to Robin instead of to himself, he senses a threat to his power. In London, King John reneges on his promise to sign the charter and declares Robin an [[outlaw]] to be hunted throughout the kingdom. The [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] announces the decree, and Robin and his men flee to [[Sherwood Forest]] with the orphans of Nottingham. Marian narrates their new life in the greenwood, noting that they live in equality as they right the many wrongs in the kingdom of King John. \"And so the legend begins.\"\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as [[Robin Hood|Robin Longstride]]\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Maid Marian|Marian Loxley]]\n* [[William Hurt]] as [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshal]]<ref>{{cite news|author=Borys Kit |title=William Hurt jousting for Robin Hood role |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=12 April 2009 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3iddc0608768893d1e82e7cae7eec09ccd |accessdate=13 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414080023/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3iddc0608768893d1e82e7cae7eec09ccd |archivedate=14 April 2009 }}</ref>\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Sir Godfrey, Prince John's henchman\n* [[Mark Addy]] as [[Friar Tuck]]\n* [[Oscar Isaac]] as [[John, King of England|Prince John]], the younger brother of King Richard\n* [[Danny Huston]] as [[Richard I of England|King Richard the Lionheart]]\n* [[Eileen Atkins]] as [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], King Richard and Prince John's mother\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as Sir Walter Loxley of Peper Harow\n* [[Kevin Durand]] as [[Little John]]<ref name=\"trio\">{{cite journal|first=Borys |last=Kit |title=Trio join Ridley Scott's Robin Hood film |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=9 March 2009 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ia82652ffac56b32e4e4fe4b83a847fe8 |accessdate=10 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311043113/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ia82652ffac56b32e4e4fe4b83a847fe8 |archivedate=11 March 2009 }}</ref>\n* [[Scott Grimes]] as [[Will Scarlet]]\n* [[Matthew Macfadyen]] as the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]]<ref>{{cite news | author = Peter Sciretta | title = Ridley Scott Casts Matthew Macfadyen as The Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood | work = SlashFilm | date = 24 April 2009 | url = http://www.slashfilm.com/2009/04/24/ridley-scott-casts-matthew-macfadyen-as-the-sheriff-of-nottingham-in-robin-hood/ | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120911055743/http://www.slashfilm.com/2009/04/24/ridley-scott-casts-matthew-macfadyen-as-the-sheriff-of-nottingham-in-robin-hood/ | url-status=dead | archive-date = 11 September 2012 | accessdate = 24 April 2009 }}</ref>\n* [[Alan Doyle]] as [[Alan-a-Dale|Allan A'Dayle]]<ref name=\"trio\" />\n* [[L\u00e9a Seydoux]] as [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame]], wife of Prince John and the French king's niece\n* [[Jonathan Zacca\u00ef]] as [[Philip II of France|King Philip of France]]\n* [[Douglas Hodge]] as Sir Robert Loxley\n* [[Robert Pugh]] as Baron Baldwin\n* [[Gerard McSorley]] as [[Walter Fitz Robert|Baron FitzRobert]]\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as Father Tancred \n* [[Mark Lewis Jones]] as Thomas Longstride, Robin's father\n* [[Denis Menochet]] as Adhemar, the aide to the French King\n* [[Jessica Raine]] as [[Isabel, Countess of Gloucester|Isabel of Gloucester]], John's first wife\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn January 2007, [[Universal Studios]] and [[Brian Grazer]]'s [[Imagine Entertainment]] acquired a [[spec script]] written by Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris, creators of the TV series ''[[Sleeper Cell (TV series)|Sleeper Cell]]''.
