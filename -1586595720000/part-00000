Founded in 1924, the club was elected to [[the Football League]] in 1972, and spent 31 seasons in the League in two spells, 25 of them in the fourth tier. The club reached the [[Football League Second Division|old Second Division]] in [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976]], its best league performance, but was relegated after only one season at that level.\n\nHereford achieved national prominence in 1972 when, as a Southern League club, they [[Hereford United v Newcastle United 1972|knocked top-flight Newcastle United out of the FA Cup]].<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2008/01/05/sfnher105.xml Ronnie Radford Rocket Stunned Norwich City] Daily Telegraph, 5 January 2008.

They were nicknamed 'The Whites' or 'The Lilywhites', after their predominantly white kit, or 'The Bulls' after the [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford cattle breed]]. The club's motto was \"Our greatest glory lies not in never having fallen, but in rising when we fall\". The club was affiliated to the [[Herefordshire County FA]].

Hereford joined the [[Birmingham Combination]] and lost its first match 2\u20133 to [[Atherstone United F.C.|Atherstone United]]. The club's second ever match was an [[FA Cup|FA Cup Preliminary Round]] tie against future rivals [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] which they lost 2\u20137.\n\nHereford progressed to the [[West Midlands (Regional) League|Birmingham & District League]] in 1928 where the club spent 11 seasons, with a best position of 4th. By the late 1930s the number of clubs in the league had decreased and Hereford successfully applied to join the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]&nbsp;\u2013  but played only a few games in this league before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]]. At the same time the club became a limited company.\n\nWhen football resumed after the war, Hereford finished 1st in their first full season in the league only to be demoted to 2nd behind [[Chelmsford City F.C.|Chelmsford City]], which was awarded points for unplayed matches.<ref>[http://www.herefordunited.co.uk/article/624451/1924-1949 Hereford United&nbsp;\u2013 1924\u20131949] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703195516/http://www.herefordunited.co.uk/article/624451/1924-1949 |date=3 July 2008 }} Hereford United Official Website.

When the league was regionalised for one season in 1958\u201359, Hereford also won their regional division to add to their third League Cup win.\n\nIn 1966 Hereford signed [[John Charles]], the former [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and [[Wales national football team|Welsh international]], boosting the support of the club.<ref>[http://www.herefordunited.co.uk/article/624524/1960-1970 Hereford United&nbsp;\u2013 1960\u20131970] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720145655/http://www.herefordunited.co.uk/article/624524/1960-1970 |date=20 July 2008 }} Hereford United Official Website.

With the club becoming one of the best-supported non-league clubs in the country Charles used his standing within the game to canvass votes from member clubs for election to the Football League.\n\nThe [[1971\u201372 in English football|1971\u20131972 season]] saw the club finish second in the Southern League and gain national prominence due to its exploits in the FA Cup. Charles had departed the club in October 1971 and his successor [[Colin Addison]] inherited a side that [[Hereford United v Newcastle United 1972|defeated top-flight Newcastle United in the FA Cup]]. The star player was [[Dudley Tyler]]; [[Ronnie Radford]] and [[Ricky George]]'s goals earned the club a Fourth Round tie against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] where they were defeated in a replay at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]]. The Cup run played a part in the club's successful election to the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]], replacing [[Barrow F.C.|Barrow]].\n\nThe club rose rapidly to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] after finishing runners-up in their first season in the Fourth Division and winning the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] title in 1976. [[Dixie McNeil]] was the leading goalscorer in the top four divisions of English football in the same season, but Hereford would only spend one season in the second tier before dropping back into the Fourth Division. The club's peak was in October 1976 when they were in sixth position before playing [[Brian Clough]]'s [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], losing 4\u20133 at the [[City Ground]].\n\nAfter this period of success the club spent 19 years in the bottom division, suffering financial problems in the early 1980s which resurfaced in the mid-1990s. The club enjoyed brief glimpses of their past success in the Cup competitions, holding [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] to a 1\u20131 draw in the FA Cup of 1985 and narrowly losing 1\u20130 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the FA Cup of 1990. The club's first trophy for 14 years was the [[Welsh Cup]] won in the same season. In the league the club usually finished in the bottom half as it went through a succession of managers, finishing 17th in 4 consecutive seasons.\n\n[[Graham Turner]] was appointed manager for the beginning of the [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396 season]] and managed to lead the team to sixth place and the play-offs, despite the club being in 17th position two months previously. This resurgence was in part thanks to the goals of [[Steve White (footballer)|Steve White]] who emulated Dixie McNeil by being the leading goalscorer in the top four divisions. Hereford lost to [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]] in the play-offs and, with financial problems worsening, the club lost key players for the following [[1996\u201397 in English football|1996\u20131997 season]]. After a terrible run of form Hereford were ultimately relegated after a relegation-decider at [[Edgar Street]] with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]].\n\nIn 1998 Turner purchased a majority shareholding from Peter Hill and Robin Fry. The club was in serious financial difficulties, with debts of \u00a31million owed to a property development company which also controlled the leases on the stadium.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19971017/ai_n14138094 Financial crisis threatens Hereford] The Independent, 17 October 1997.

A depiction of a [[Hereford (cattle)|Herefordshire bull]] was introduced for the 1971\u201372 season with ''H.U.F.C.'' lettering underneath. A supporters' club crest was also used during the 1970s.

The current crest was introduced in the early 1990s but was not featured on the shirts until 2003.\n\nHereford's shirt sponsors were Sun Valley Poultry between 1991 and 2009, the biggest employer in Hereford.

The support fell during the 1980s with the average home attendance under 3,000, the exception being the 1984\u201385 season when the club finished fifth.\n\nIt was not until the latter Conference years that attendances improved, with the 2003\u201304 season seeing the average home attendance rise to 3,704. The following season saw the figure drop to just over 3,000 while in the 2005\u201306 season, despite the club successfully gaining promotion, the figure was 2,791. For the 2006\u201307 season the club had an average home league attendance of 3,327. With the exception of 2003\u201304, this is the highest average attendance since the 1984\u201385 season (3,881).\n\nThe club rarely enjoyed capacity crowds at Edgar Street in its later years, last seeing a five-figure home attendance in 1990.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}  After the reduction of the Edgar Street capacity in line with the [[Taylor Report]] the highest home attendance was 8,953 in 1994&nbsp;\u2013 a [[Football League Cup|Coca-Cola Cup Second Round]] match against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. The highest league home attendance was 8,532, which was the relegation decider against [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] in 1997.\n\nFollowing the takeover by Tommy Agombar, following the conclusion of the 2013\u20132014 season, Hereford's Supporters Trust voted to boycott United's fixtures and subsequently attendances dropped from around 2000 in the 2013\u20132014 season, to around 200\u2013400 during the opening exchanges of the 2014\u20132015 Southern League.\n\n===Club anthem===\nThe club's official anthem was ''Hereford United (We All Love You)'' which was written and performed by Danny Lee, a notable supporter of the club.<ref>[http://archive.herefordtimes.com/2007/8/16/87786.html Danny Has Booked His Place In Heaven For All The Things He's Done] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124222048/http://archive.herefordtimes.com/2007/8/16/87786.html |date=24 January 2009 }} Hereford Times, 16 August 2007.

The club's second ever match was an [[FA Cup|FA Cup Preliminary Round]] tie against future rivals [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] which they lost 2\u20137.\n\nHereford progressed to the [[West Midlands (Regional) League|Birmingham & District League]] in 1928 where the club spent 11 seasons, with a best position of 4th. By the late 1930s the number of clubs in the league had decreased and Hereford successfully applied to join the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]&nbsp;\u2013  but played only a few games in this league before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]]. At the same time the club became a limited company.\n\nWhen football resumed after the war, Hereford finished 1st in their first full season in the league only to be demoted to 2nd behind [[Chelmsford City F.C.|Chelmsford City]], which was awarded points for unplayed matches.<ref>[http://www.herefordunited.co.uk/article/624451/1924-1949 Hereford United&nbsp;\u2013 1924\u20131949] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703195516/http://www.herefordunited.co.uk/article/624451/1924-1949 |date=3 July 2008 }} Hereford United Official Website.

With the club becoming one of the best-supported non-league clubs in the country Charles used his standing within the game to canvass votes from member clubs for election to the Football League.\n\nThe [[1971\u201372 in English football|1971\u20131972 season]] saw the club finish second in the Southern League and gain national prominence due to its exploits in the FA Cup. Charles had departed the club in October 1971 and his successor [[Colin Addison]] inherited a side that [[Hereford United v Newcastle United 1972|defeated top-flight Newcastle United in the FA Cup]]. The star player was [[Dudley Tyler]]; [[Ronnie Radford]] and [[Ricky George]]'s goals earned the club a Fourth Round tie against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] where they were defeated in a replay at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]]. The Cup run played a part in the club's successful election to the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]], replacing [[Barrow F.C.|Barrow]].\n\nThe club rose rapidly to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] after finishing runners-up in their first season in the Fourth Division and winning the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] title in 1976. [[Dixie McNeil]] was the leading goalscorer in the top four divisions of English football in the same season, but Hereford would only spend one season in the second tier before dropping back into the Fourth Division. The club's peak was in October 1976 when they were in sixth position before playing [[Brian Clough]]'s [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], losing 4\u20133 at the [[City Ground]].\n\nAfter this period of success the club spent 19 years in the bottom division, suffering financial problems in the early 1980s which resurfaced in the mid-1990s. The club enjoyed brief glimpses of their past success in the Cup competitions, holding [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] to a 1\u20131 draw in the FA Cup of 1985 and narrowly losing 1\u20130 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the FA Cup of 1990. The club's first trophy for 14 years was the [[Welsh Cup]] won in the same season. In the league the club usually finished in the bottom half as it went through a succession of managers, finishing 17th in 4 consecutive seasons.\n\n[[Graham Turner]] was appointed manager for the beginning of the [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396 season]] and managed to lead the team to sixth place and the play-offs, despite the club being in 17th position two months previously. This resurgence was in part thanks to the goals of [[Steve White (footballer)|Steve White]] who emulated Dixie McNeil by being the leading goalscorer in the top four divisions.

District Muzaffarnagar has 8 sugar mills. More than 40% of the region's population is engaged in agriculture. According to Economic Research firm ''Indicus Analytics'', Muzaffarnagar has the highest agricultural GDP in Uttar Pradesh, as well as UP's largest granary.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Healthcare ===\nMuzaffaranagar has both public and private healthcare system. The [[District hospital]] is the major government hospital in the city along with several general practitioners in the city. The city is also catered by a private medical college ([[Muzaffarnagar Medical College]]) on the outskirts of the city.\n\n==Transportation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\nMuzaffarnagar is well connected by road and railway networks. The [[Ghaziabad, India|Ghaziabad]] - [[Saharanpur]] line passes through the city thus forming the backbone of the long-distance and best possible travel from the city. [[Indian_Railways|Indian Railways]] provides connections to [[New Delhi]],  [[Western_Uttar_Pradesh|Western Uttar Pradesh]], [[Jammu & Kashmir]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[South_India|South India]], and other parts of the country. [[Dehradun Shatabdi Express]] and [[Dehradun Jan Shatabdi Express]] trains pass through and halt at the [[Muzaffarnagar railway station|Muzaffarnagar station]]. The Meerut - Shaharanpur section of this railway route is now being developed as a part of the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor. The corridor extends from [[Ludhiana]] in Punjab to Dankuni in West Bengal.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n[[File:National Highway 58 (India).png|thumb|alt= NH-58 passing through Muzaffarnagar|NH-58 passing through M.Nagar]]\nThe National Highway - 58 (NH-58) passes through Muzaffarnagar city. This highway provides connections towards Delhi on the southern direction and upper reaches of the Himalayas in the [[Uttarakhand]] state in the northern direction. The highway is the backbone of road transportation for the Muzaffarnagar city as well as the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand. Cities and areas of Hardwar, Rishikesh, Dehradun as well as Badrinath and Kedarnath are served by this highway.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nCity transportation mostly consists of tricycles and 3-wheeled vehicles, rickshaws. An international airport, Muzaffarnagar International Airport, was proposed in the city in order to reduce the traffic at the [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]], however, the same was transferred to the Jewar Airport.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Environmental concerns===\nMuzaffarnagar lies approximately halfway on the road from Delhi to [[Rishikesh]] (the [[National_highways_in_India|NH]]-58). As a result, many roadside resorts and eateries have sprung up on the highway near the city. Especially, the town of [[Khatauli]] is famed for its canal side forest park named \"Cheetal\". Once visited for the sight of [[deer]] and [[rabbits]] and other wild animals, the Cheetal is now encroached by privately owned dhabas and resorts thus sidelining the animals.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Notable People of Muzaffarnagar==\n{{famous|date=January 2017}}\n*[[Raj Roop Singh Verma]],Resident of village Lacchera, Who started The first newspaper \"DEHAT\" of Muzaffarnagar.

It supports [[IPv6]] and, for those on IPv4 networks, [[Hole punching (networking)|NAT punching]] and relaying are offered.

Private relays can also be set up and configured, with or without public relays, if desired.

Oakley and [[Josh Weinstein]] became best friends and writing partners at [[St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.)|high school]]; Oakley then attended [[Harvard University]] and was Vice President of the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]''. He worked on several short-term media projects, including writing for the variety show ''Sunday Best'', but was then unemployed for a long period.\n\nOakley and Weinstein eventually penned a [[spec script]] for ''[[Seinfeld]]'', after which they wrote \"[[Marge Gets a Job]]\", an episode of ''The Simpsons''. Subsequently, the two were hired to write for the show on a permanent basis in 1992. After they wrote episodes such as \"[[$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)]]\", \"[[Bart vs. Australia]]\" and \"[[Who Shot Mr. Burns?]]\", the two were appointed [[executive producer]]s and [[showrunner]]s for the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh]] and [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth]] seasons of the show. They attempted to include several emotional episodes focusing on the [[Simpson family]], as well as several high-concept episodes such as \"[[Homer's Enemy]]\", \"[[Two Bad Neighbors]]\" and \"[[The Principal and the Pauper]]\", winning three [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for their work.\n\nAfter they left ''The Simpsons'', Oakley and Weinstein created ''[[Mission Hill (TV series)|Mission Hill]]''. The show was plagued by promotional issues and was swiftly canceled. They worked as [[consultants|consulting producers]] on ''[[Futurama]]'', then created ''[[The Mullets (TV series)|The Mullets]]'' in 2003. The two wrote several unsuccessful TV pilots, and were due to serve as showrunners on ''[[Sit Down, Shut Up (U.S. TV series)|Sit Down, Shut Up]]'' in 2009. Oakley left the project over a contract dispute. He has since written for ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' and ''[[Portlandia (TV series)|Portlandia]]'', without Weinstein. He also served as co-executive producer and writer on ''Portlandia'', sharing a [[Writers Guild of America Award]] with his fellow writers in 2013. In 2018, Oakley reunited with Weinstein as co-executive producer on ''[[Disenchantment (TV series)|Disenchantment]]'', [[Matt Groening]]'s animated series for [[Netflix]].

The episode \"[[Homer's Phobia]]\" drew the censor's objections. Its script came back with two pages of notes about almost every single line. The censors stated that they did not like the use of the word \"[[gay]]\", or the discussion of homosexuality at all, and closed with a paragraph which stated that \"the topic and substance of this episode are unacceptable for [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]\". The censor problems ultimately came to nothing; when the episode came back from animation in South Korea, the then-Fox president had just been fired and replaced, with the censors being replaced as well. The new censors sent back merely one line: \"acceptable for broadcast\".<ref>{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"Homer's Phobia\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\n====Leaving the show====\nOakley and Weinstein stood down as showrunners after season eight because they \"didn't want to break [the show].\" Oakley said: \"We always said we'd never do a joke that we'd done before.\"<ref name=mh/> They felt the showrunner should not stay for more than two seasons.<ref name=simp/> Due to the pressures of having to work on two seasons at once (writing season eight, while doing post-production of season seven), Oakley said that at least two episodes from season eight would ideally have been rewritten, had there been sufficient time,<ref name=nohomers2/> and that towards the end, they were \"treading water\".<ref name=port/> As they were working on [[post-production]] of season eight, they were credited as consulting producers for [[The Simpsons|season nine]], which was in its initial writing stages.<ref name=\"NoHomers\"/> Oakley stated that they contributed \"somewhere between 0 and .0001%\" of the season, only attending the table readings of the scripts.<ref name=\"NoHomers\"/>\n\nThey produced three episodes held over from season eight, which aired as part of season nine: \"[[The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson]]\",<ref>{{cite video|people=Oakley, Bill|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Ninth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson\"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> \"[[The Principal and the Pauper]]\" and \"[[Lisa the Simpson]]\". \"The Principal and the Pauper\" was negatively received due the sudden revelation that long-time character [[Seymour Skinner]] was actually an imposter. For example, in his book ''[[Planet Simpson]]'', [[Chris Turner (author)|Chris Turner]] describes \"The Principal and the Pauper\" as the \"broadcast that marked [the] abrupt plunge\" from ''The Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> \"Golden Age\", which he says began in the middle of the show's [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]]. He calls the episode \"[one of] the weakest episodes in ''Simpsons'' history\".{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=41-42}} As such, Oakley considers it the most controversial episode from his tenure as executive producer. He and Weinstein advise viewers to treat \"The Principal and the Pauper\" as an \"experiment\". They surmise that the negative reception was partly due to the fact that it was not immediately apparent to viewers that this was such an episode (as opposed to, for example, \"[[The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase]]\"). They describe the ending of the episode as an attempt to reset the continuity and allow fans to consider the episode on its own.<ref>Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh. (2006).

A badly edited two-minute promotional video for the show, sent to advertisers in April 1999 for the annual [[Upfront (advertising)|upfronts]], was poorly received. Oakley and Weinstein had been informed that the upfronts did not matter.<ref name=mh/> Similarly, because no episodes were finished in time, journalists were not able to see anything of the show at the network's schedule presentation in July. Subsequently, as Weinstein commented to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', \"for seven months, the only impression people had of the show was based on a two-minute tape that looked terrible. Six major publications panned it before they even saw it.\" The pilot garnered largely negative reviews from publications such as ''[[The Deseret News]]''; and earned a positive write-up in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.<ref name=mh/> Furthermore, the show was forced to change from its originally planned title of ''The Downtowners'' due to its closeness to an [[MTV]] show.<ref name=mh/> All of these factors combined to ensure the show received little attention, and the WB ran only a few commercials for it.

Oakley and [[Josh Weinstein]] became best friends and writing partners at [[St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.)|high school]]; Oakley then attended [[Harvard University]] and was Vice President of the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]''. He worked on several short-term media projects, including writing for the variety show ''Sunday Best'', but was then unemployed for a long period.\n\nOakley and Weinstein eventually penned a [[spec script]] for ''[[Seinfeld]]'', after which they wrote \"[[Marge Gets a Job]]\", an episode of ''The Simpsons''. Subsequently, the two were hired to write for the show on a permanent basis in 1992. After they wrote episodes such as \"[[$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)]]\", \"[[Bart vs. Australia]]\" and \"[[Who Shot Mr. Burns?]]\", the two were appointed [[executive producer]]s and [[showrunner]]s for the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh]] and [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth]] seasons of the show. They attempted to include several emotional episodes focusing on the [[Simpson family]], as well as several high-concept episodes such as \"[[Homer's Enemy]]\", \"[[Two Bad Neighbors]]\" and \"[[The Principal and the Pauper]]\", winning three [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for their work.\n\nAfter they left ''The Simpsons'', Oakley and Weinstein created ''[[Mission Hill (TV series)|Mission Hill]]''. The show was plagued by promotional issues and was swiftly canceled. They worked as [[consultants|consulting producers]] on ''[[Futurama]]'', then created ''[[The Mullets (TV series)|The Mullets]]'' in 2003. The two wrote several unsuccessful TV pilots, and were due to serve as showrunners on ''[[Sit Down, Shut Up (U.S. TV series)|Sit Down, Shut Up]]'' in 2009. Oakley left the project over a contract dispute. He has since written for ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' and ''[[Portlandia (TV series)|Portlandia]]'', without Weinstein. He also served as co-executive producer and writer on ''Portlandia'', sharing a [[Writers Guild of America Award]] with his fellow writers in 2013. In 2018, Oakley reunited with Weinstein as co-executive producer on ''[[Disenchantment (TV series)|Disenchantment]]'', [[Matt Groening]]'s series for [[Netflix]]. Oakley is married to fellow writer Rachel Pulido.\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam Lloyd Oakley was born on February 27, 1966 in [[Westminster, Maryland]] and raised on a farm in [[Union Bridge, Maryland]].<ref name=mh/><ref name=port/><ref>[http://theboar.org/2011/10/13/bill-oakley-interview/#.VEtN6aNwaM8 Bill Oakley Interview \u00ab The Boar The Boar] Retrieved 2014-10-25.</ref> He was a fan of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine from an early age, which helped shape his comic sensibility.<ref name=port/> He attended [[St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.)|St. Albans School]] in [[Washington D.C.]], where he met and became best friends with [[Josh Weinstein]] in the eighth grade.

They were chosen partly because they had been with the show since the third season and understood many of its dynamics.<ref name=simp/> The showrunner is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the show's production. Each episode takes ten months to produce, so the showrunner must \"oversee many different episodes in different stages of production all at the same time\", with roles including head writer, making notes on the [[storyboard]]s and working with the voice actors, animators, editors and composers.

This was exemplified in \"[[Mother Simpson]]\", \"[[Lisa the Iconoclast]]\", \"[[Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily|Diddly-Dum-Doodly]]\", and a couple others.

This evolved into the concept of a \"real world\" co-worker who would either love or hate Homer. The writers chose the latter as they thought it would have funnier results.<ref name=\"Weinstein\"/> The result was the character of Frank Grimes, a man who has had to work hard all his life with nothing to show for it and is dismayed and embittered by Homer's success and comfort in spite of his inherent laziness and ignorance.<ref name=\"Weinstein\"/> \"Homer's Enemy\" explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong [[work ethic]] placed alongside Homer in a work environment.

The episode \"[[Homer's Phobia]]\" drew the censor's objections. Its script came back with two pages of notes about almost every single line. The censors stated that they did not like the use of the word \"[[gay]]\", or the discussion of homosexuality at all, and closed with a paragraph which stated that \"the topic and substance of this episode are unacceptable for [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]\". The censor problems ultimately came to nothing; when the episode came back from animation in South Korea, the then-Fox president had just been fired and replaced, with the censors being replaced as well. The new censors sent back merely one line: \"acceptable for broadcast\".<ref>{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"Homer's Phobia\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\n====Leaving the show====\nOakley and Weinstein stood down as showrunners after season eight because they \"didn't want to break [the show].\" Oakley said: \"We always said we'd never do a joke that we'd done before.\"<ref name=mh/> They felt the showrunner should not stay for more than two seasons.<ref name=simp/> Due to the pressures of having to work on two seasons at once (writing season eight, while doing post-production of season seven), Oakley said that at least two episodes from season eight would ideally have been rewritten, had there been sufficient time,<ref name=nohomers2/> and that towards the end, they were \"treading water\".<ref name=port/> As they were working on [[post-production]] of season eight, they were credited as consulting producers for [[The Simpsons|season nine]], which was in its initial writing stages.<ref name=\"NoHomers\"/> Oakley stated that they contributed \"somewhere between 0 and .0001%\" of the season, only attending the table readings of the scripts.<ref name=\"NoHomers\"/>\n\nThey produced three episodes held over from season eight, which aired as part of season nine: \"[[The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson]]\",<ref>{{cite video|people=Oakley, Bill|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Ninth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson\"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> \"[[The Principal and the Pauper]]\" and \"[[Lisa the Simpson]]\". \"The Principal and the Pauper\" was negatively received due the sudden revelation that long-time character [[Seymour Skinner]] was actually an imposter. For example, in his book ''[[Planet Simpson]]'', [[Chris Turner (author)|Chris Turner]] describes \"The Principal and the Pauper\" as the \"broadcast that marked [the] abrupt plunge\" from ''The Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> \"Golden Age\", which he says began in the middle of the show's [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]]. He calls the episode \"[one of] the weakest episodes in ''Simpsons'' history\".{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=41-42}} As such, Oakley considers it the most controversial episode from his tenure as executive producer. He and Weinstein advise viewers to treat \"The Principal and the Pauper\" as an \"experiment\". They surmise that the negative reception was partly due to the fact that it was not immediately apparent to viewers that this was such an episode (as opposed to, for example, \"[[The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase]]\"). They describe the ending of the episode as an attempt to reset the continuity and allow fans to consider the episode on its own.<ref>Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh. (2006).

A badly edited two-minute promotional video for the show, sent to advertisers in April 1999 for the annual [[Upfront (advertising)|upfronts]], was poorly received. Oakley and Weinstein had been informed that the upfronts did not matter.<ref name=mh/> Similarly, because no episodes were finished in time, journalists were not able to see anything of the show at the network's schedule presentation in July. Subsequently, as Weinstein commented to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', \"for seven months, the only impression people had of the show was based on a two-minute tape that looked terrible. Six major publications panned it before they even saw it.\" The pilot garnered largely negative reviews from publications such as ''[[The Deseret News]]''; and earned a positive write-up in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.<ref name=mh/> Furthermore, the show was forced to change from its originally planned title of ''The Downtowners'' due to its closeness to an [[MTV]] show.<ref name=mh/> All of these factors combined to ensure the show received little attention, and the WB ran only a few commercials for it.

The Finnish parliament appointed [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]] to lead the newly-independent grand duchy's [[interregnum]] government. In January 1918, a Military committee was charged with bolstering the Finnish army, then not much more than some locally organised [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]]. Mannerheim was appointed to the committee, but soon resigned to protest its indecision. On 13 January he was given command of the army.{{hsp}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Screen |first1=J. E.

The Finnish red guard had 30,000 men and there were 70,000 Russian troops in Finland. His army was financed by a fifteen million mark line of credit provided by the bankers. His raw recruits had few arms. Nonetheless he marched them to [[Vaasa]], which was garrisoned by 42,500 Russians.{{hsp}}<ref>Mannerheim 1954, p. 138.</ref> He surrounded the Russian garrison with a mass of men; the defenders could not see that only the front rank was armed, so they surrendered, providing badly needed arms. Further weapons were purchased from Germany. Eighty-four Swedish officers and 200 Swedish NCOs served in the [[Finnish Civil War]] (or War of Liberty, as it was known among the \"Whites\"). Other officers were Finns who had been trained by the Germans as a J\u00e4ger Battalion. In March 1918 they were aided by German troops landing in Finland and occupying [[Helsinki]].\n\nAfter the Whites' victory in the bitterly fought [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]], during which both sides employed ruthless terror tactics, Mannerheim resigned as commander-in-chief.

Mannerheim's rapport with the Allies was recognized in October 1918 when the Finnish government sent him to Britain and France to attempt to gain Britain's and the United States's recognition of Finland's independence. In December, he was summoned back to Finland; Frederick Charles had renounced the throne, and in his stead, Mannerheim had been elected [[Regent]] of the nascent kingdom. As Regent, Mannerheim often signed official documents using ''Kustaa'', the Finnish form of his Christian name, to emphasize his Finnishness to those who were suspicious of his background in the Russian armed forces, and his difficulties with the Finnish language{{hsp}}{{sfnp|Jagerskiold|1986}} Mannerheim disliked his last Christian name, Emil, and wrote his signature as C.G.

In July 1919, after he had confirmed a new, [[Republicanism|republican]] constitution, Mannerheim stood as a candidate in [[1919 Finnish presidential election|the first presidential election]], with parliament as the electors. He was supported by the [[National Coalition Party]] and the [[Swedish People's Party (Finland)|Swedish People's Party]]. He finished second to [[Kaarlo Juho St\u00e5hlberg]], and withdrew from public life.{{hsp}}<ref name=\"Putensen\"/>\n\n===Interwar period===\nIn the interwar years, Mannerheim held no public office. This was largely due to his being seen by many politicians of the centre and left as a controversial figure for his ruthless battle with the [[Bolshevik]]s, his supposed desire for Finnish intervention on the side of the [[White Army|Whites]] during the [[Russian Civil War]], and the Finnish socialists' antipathy toward him. They saw him as the [[bourgeois]] \"White General\". Mannerheim doubted that modern party-based politics would produce principled and high-quality leaders in Finland or elsewhere. In his gloomy opinion, the fatherland's interests were too often sacrificed by the democratic politicians for partisan benefit.{{hsp}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Virkkunen |first1=Sakari |title=Mannerheimin k\u00e4\u00e4nt\u00f6puoli |date=1992 |publisher=Otava |location=Helsingiss\u00e4}}</ref>{{hsp}}{{sfnp|J\u00e4gerski\u00f6ld|1983}}\n\nHe kept busy heading the Finnish [[Red Cross]] (Chairman 1919\u20131951), was a member of the board of the International Red Cross, and founded the Mannerheim League for Child Welfare.

In 1933, Mannerheim received the rank of [[Field Marshal (Finland)|Field Marshal]] (''sotamarsalkka'', ''f\u00e4ltmarskalk''). By this time, Mannerheim had come to be seen by the public, including some former socialists, less as a \"White General\" and more as a nonpartisan figure, enhanced by his public statements urging reconciliation between the opposing sides in the Civil War and the need to focus on national unity and defence: \"we need not ask where a man stood fifteen years ago\".{{hsp}}<ref>Screen 2000, p. 112.</ref> Mannerheim supported Finland's military industry and sought in vain to obtain a military defence union with [[Sweden]]. However, rearming the Finnish army did not occur as swiftly or as well as he hoped, and he was not enthusiastic about a war. He had many disagreements with various Cabinets, and signed many letters of resignation.{{hsp}}<ref name=Virkkunen >Sakari Virkkunen, \"Presidents of Finland II\" ''(Suomen presidentit II)'', published in Finland in 1994</ref>{{hsp}}{{sfnp|Turtola|1994}}\n\n===Commander-in-Chief===\n{{See also|Winter War|Continuation War|Lapland War}}\n[[File:Talvisoda marski-2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Field Marshal (Finland)|Field Marshal]] [[Baron]] Mannerheim in 1940]]\n\nWhen negotiations with the Soviet Union failed in 1939, Mannerheim withdrew his resignation on 17 October.

Hitler visited Mannerheim on his 75th birthday.]]\n\nMannerheim's 75th birthday, 4 June 1942, was a national celebration. The government granted him the unique title of [[Marshal of Finland]] (''Suomen Marsalkka'' in Finnish, ''Marskalk av Finland'' in Swedish). So far he is the only person to receive the title. A surprise birthday visit by Hitler occurred on the day as he wished to visit the \"brave Finns (''die tapferen Finnen'')\" and their leader Mannerheim.{{hsp}}<ref name=\"Virkkunen\" />{{sfnp|Turtola|1994}} Mannerheim did not want to meet him at his headquarters or in Helsinki, as then it would seem like an official state visit. The meeting took place near [[Imatra]], in south-eastern Finland, and was arranged in secrecy.{{hsp}}<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/> From [[Immola Airfield]], Hitler, accompanied by President Ryti, was driven to where [[Baron]] Mannerheim was waiting at a railway siding. A speech from Hitler was followed by a birthday meal and negotiations between him and Mannerheim. Overall, Hitler spent about five hours in Finland; he reportedly asked the Finns to step up military operations against the Soviets, but apparently made no specific demands.{{hsp}}<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/>\n\nDuring the visit, an engineer of the Finnish broadcasting company [[YLE]], Thor Damen, succeeded in recording the first eleven minutes of [[Hitler and Mannerheim recording|Hitler's and Mannerheim's private conversation]]. This had to be done secretly, as Hitler never allowed off-guard recordings. Damen was assigned to record the official birthday speeches and Mannerheim's response and therefore placed microphones in some of the railway cars. However, Mannerheim and his guests chose to go to a car that did not have a microphone in it. Damen acted quickly, pushing a microphone through one of the car windows onto a net shelf just above where Hitler and Mannerheim were sitting. After eleven minutes of Hitler's and Mannerheim's private conversation, Hitler's [[Begleitkommando-SS|SS bodyguards]] spotted the cords coming out of the window and realized that the Finnish engineer was recording the conversation. They gestured to him to stop recording immediately, and he complied. The SS bodyguards demanded that the tape be destroyed, but YLE was allowed to keep the reel after promising to keep it in a sealed container. It was given to [[Kustaa Vilkuna]], head of the state censors' office, and in 1957 returned to [[Yle|YLE]]. It was released to the public a few years later. It is the only known recording of Hitler conversing.{{hsp}}<ref>[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/1076153999513 Helsingin Sanomat International Web-Edition] \u2013 \"Conversation secretly recorded in Finland helped a German actor prepare for Hitler role\" Helsingin Sanomat / First published in print 15 September 2004 in Finnish.</ref><ref>Recording available [[YLE]]'s [http://www.yle.fi/elavaarkisto/?s=s&g=1&ag=3&t=22&a=376 web-archive]</ref>\n\nThere is an unsubstantiated story that while conversing with Hitler, Mannerheim lit a cigar. Mannerheim expected that Hitler would ask Finland for more help against the [[Soviet Union]], which Mannerheim was unwilling to give. When Mannerheim lit up, all in attendance gasped, for [[Anti-tobacco movement in Nazi Germany|Hitler's aversion to smoking]] was well known. Nevertheless, Hitler continued the conversation calmly, with no comment. By this test, Mannerheim could judge if Hitler was speaking from a position of strength or weakness. He refused Hitler, knowing that Hitler was in a weak position, and could not dictate to him.{{hsp}}<ref name=Virkkunen />{{sfnp|Turtola|1994}}\n\nShortly thereafter, Mannerheim returned the visit, traveling to Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia.{{hsp}}<ref>Mannerheim 1954, pp. 454\u2013455.</ref>\n\n===End of war and presidency===\n[[File:Mannerheim Leaving Presidents Residence.png|thumb|left|[[Marshal of Finland|Marshal]] [[Baron]] Mannerheim leaves the [[Presidential Palace, Helsinki|Presidential Palace]] in [[Helsinki]] on 4 March 1946 after his short presidency]]\n\nIn June 1944, Baron Gustaf Mannerheim, to ensure German support while a major Soviet offensive was threatening Finland, thought it necessary to agree to the pact the German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] demanded. But even then Mannerheim distanced himself from the pact, and it fell to President [[Risto Ryti]] to sign it, so it came to be known as the [[Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement]]. This allowed Mannerheim to revoke the agreement upon the resignation of President Ryti at the start of August 1944. Mannerheim succeeded Ryti as president.<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/><ref name=Zetterberg>Seppo Zetterberg et al., eds., \"A Small Giant of Finnish History\" ''(Suomen historian pikkuj\u00e4ttil\u00e4inen),'' 2003</ref>\n\nWhen Germany was deemed sufficiently weakened, and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s summer offensive was fought to a standstill (see [[Battle of Tali-Ihantala]]) thanks to the June agreement with the Germans, Finland's leaders saw a chance to reach a peace with the Soviet Union.{{hsp}}<ref>Screen 2000, p. 205.</ref> At first, attempts were made to persuade Mannerheim to become prime minister, but he rejected them because of his age and lack of experience running a civil government. The next suggestion was to elect him [[Head of State]]. Risto Ryti would resign as President, and parliament would appoint Mannerheim as Regent. The use of the title \"Regent\" would have reflected the exceptional circumstances of Mannerheim's election. Mannerheim and Ryti both agreed, and Ryti submitted a notice of resignation on 1 August. The [[Parliament of Finland]] passed a special act conferring the presidency on Mannerheim on 4 August 1944. He took the oath of office the same day.<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/><ref name=\"Zetterberg\"/>\n\nA month after Mannerheim took office, the [[Continuation War]] was concluded on harsh terms, but ultimately far less harsh than those imposed on the other states bordering the [[Soviet Union]]. Finland retained its sovereignty, its parliamentary democracy, and its market economy. Territorial losses were considerable; all [[Karelia]] and [[Petsamo Province|Petsamo]] were lost. Numerous [[Karelia]]n refugees needed to be relocated. The war reparations were very heavy. Finland also had to fight the [[Lapland War]] against withdrawing German troops in the north, and at the same time demobilize its own army, making it harder to expel the Germans.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C68xN5lTN6EC&pg=PA87 | author=Kinnunen et al, eds.| title=Finland in World War II: History, Memory, Interpretations |year=2011 | page=87 | accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref> It is widely agreed that only Mannerheim could have guided Finland through these difficult times, when the Finnish people had to come to terms with the severe conditions of the armistice, their implementation by a Soviet-dominated [[Allied Control Commission]], and the task of post-war reconstruction.<ref name=\"Zetterberg\"/>\n\nBefore deciding to accept the Soviet demands, Mannerheim wrote a missive directly to Hitler:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nenye|first1=Vesa|last2=Munter|first2=Peter|last3=Wirtanen|first3=Toni|last4=Birks|first4=Chris|title=Finland at War: the Continuation and Lapland Wars 1941\u201345|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zb6gCwAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1472815262}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Our German brothers-in-arms will forever remain in our hearts.

Although he was elected for a full six-year term, he was 77 years old in 1944 and had accepted the office reluctantly after being urged to do so. The situation was exacerbated by frequent periods of ill-health, the demands of the Allied Control Commission, and the [[War-responsibility trials in Finland|war responsibility trials]]. He was afraid throughout most of his presidency that the commission would request that he be prosecuted for [[crimes against peace]]. This never happened. One of the reasons for this was Stalin's respect for and admiration of the Marshal. Stalin told a Finnish delegation in Moscow in 1947 that the Finns owe much to their old Marshal. Due to Mannerheim, Finland was not occupied.{{sfnp|Meri|1990|page=397}} Despite Mannerheim's criticisms of some of the demands of the Control Commission, he worked hard to carry out Finland's armistice obligations. He also emphasised the necessity of further work on reconstruction in Finland after the war.<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/><ref name=\"Zetterberg\"/>\n\nMannerheim was troubled by recurring health problems during 1945, and was absent on medical leave from his duties as president from November until February 1946. He spent six weeks in Portugal to restore his health. After the announcement of the verdicts in the war crimes trials in February, Mannerheim decided to resign. He believed that he had accomplished the duties he had been elected to carry out: The war was ended, the armistice obligations carried out, and war responsibility trials finished.\n\nMannerheim resigned as president on 11 March 1946, giving as his reason his declining health and his view that the tasks he had been selected to carry out had been accomplished. Even the Finnish communists, his enemies in 1918, appreciated his efforts and his role in maintaining the unity of the country during a difficult period.{{citation needed|April 2020}} He was succeeded as president by the conservative Prime Minister [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi]].{{hsp}}<ref name=\"Zetterberg\"/>\n\n==Final days and death==\n[[File:Mannerheims funeral parade Helsinki.png|thumb|Mannerheim's funeral parade in Helsinki [[Helsinki Senate Square|Senate Square]] on 4 February 1951.]]\nAfter his resignation, [[Marshal of Finland|Marshal]] [[Baron]] Mannerheim bought Kirkniemi Manor in [[Lohja]], intending to spend his retirement there. In June 1946, he underwent an operation for a perforated [[peptic ulcer]], and in October of that year he was diagnosed with a [[duodenal ulcer]]. In early 1947, it was recommended that he should travel to the Valmont Sanatorium in [[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]], to recuperate and write his memoirs. Valmont was to be Mannerheim's main residence for the remainder of his life, although he regularly returned to Finland, and also visited Sweden, France and Italy.<ref>Screen 2000, p. 245.</ref>\n\nBecause Mannerheim was old and sickly, he personally wrote only certain passages of his memoirs. Some other parts he dictated. The remaining parts were written from his recollections by Mannerheim's various assistants, such as Colonel Alad\u00e1r Paasonen; General Erik Heinrichs; Generals Grandell, Olenius and Martola; and Colonel Viljanen, a war historian. As long as Mannerheim was able to read, he proofread the typewritten drafts of his memoirs. He was almost totally silent about his private life, and focused instead on Finland's history, especially between 1917 and 1944. When Mannerheim suffered a fatal [[bowel obstruction]] in January 1951,{{hsp}}<ref>Screen 2000, p. 252.</ref> his memoirs were not yet in their finished form.

This may be partly due to his refusal to enter partisan politics (although his sympathies were more right-wing than left-wing), his claim always to serve the fatherland without selfish motives, his personal courage in visiting the frontlines, his ability to work diligently into his late seventies, and his foreign political farsightedness in preparing for the Soviet invasion of Finland years before it occurred.<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/>\n\nMannerheim's birthday, 4 June, is celebrated as Flag Day by the [[Finnish Defence Forces]].

The Finnish parliament appointed [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]] to lead the newly-independent grand duchy's [[interregnum]] government. In January 1918, a Military committee was charged with bolstering the Finnish army, then not much more than some locally organised [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]].

His raw recruits had few arms. Nonetheless he marched them to [[Vaasa]], which was garrisoned by 42,500 Russians.{{hsp}}<ref>Mannerheim 1954, p. 138.</ref> He surrounded the Russian garrison with a mass of men; the defenders could not see that only the front rank was armed, so they surrendered, providing badly needed arms.

Other officers were Finns who had been trained by the Germans as a J\u00e4ger Battalion. In March 1918 they were aided by German troops landing in Finland and occupying [[Helsinki]].\n\nAfter the Whites' victory in the bitterly fought [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]], during which both sides employed ruthless terror tactics, Mannerheim resigned as commander-in-chief.

Mannerheim's rapport with the Allies was recognized in October 1918 when the Finnish government sent him to Britain and France to attempt to gain Britain's and the United States's recognition of Finland's independence. In December, he was summoned back to Finland; Frederick Charles had renounced the throne, and in his stead, Mannerheim had been elected [[Regent]] of the nascent kingdom.

During his travels and hunting expeditions, he visited [[Madras]], [[Delhi]] and [[Nepal]], where he was invited by the [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|King]] to join a [[tiger]] hunt.\n\nIn 1929, Mannerheim refused the [[Far right|right-wing radicals]]' plea to become a ''de facto'' military dictator, although he did express some support for the right-wing [[Lapua Movement]].<ref>Screen 2000, p.104.</ref> After President [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]] was elected in 1931, he appointed Mannerheim as chairman of Finland's Defence Council and gave him a written promise that in the event of war he would become the Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Army. (Svinhufvud's successor [[Ky\u00f6sti Kallio]] renewed this promise in 1937). In 1933, Mannerheim received the rank of [[Field Marshal (Finland)|Field Marshal]] (''sotamarsalkka'', ''f\u00e4ltmarskalk''). By this time, Mannerheim had come to be seen by the public, including some former socialists, less as a \"White General\" and more as a nonpartisan figure, enhanced by his public statements urging reconciliation between the opposing sides in the Civil War and the need to focus on national unity and defence: \"we need not ask where a man stood fifteen years ago\".{{hsp}}<ref>Screen 2000, p. 112.</ref> Mannerheim supported Finland's military industry and sought in vain to obtain a military defence union with [[Sweden]]. However, rearming the Finnish army did not occur as swiftly or as well as he hoped, and he was not enthusiastic about a war. He had many disagreements with various Cabinets, and signed many letters of resignation.{{hsp}}<ref name=Virkkunen >Sakari Virkkunen, \"Presidents of Finland II\" ''(Suomen presidentit II)'', published in Finland in 1994</ref>{{hsp}}{{sfnp|Turtola|1994}}\n\n===Commander-in-Chief===\n{{See also|Winter War|Continuation War|Lapland War}}\n[[File:Talvisoda marski-2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Field Marshal (Finland)|Field Marshal]] [[Baron]] Mannerheim in 1940]]\n\nWhen negotiations with the Soviet Union failed in 1939, Mannerheim withdrew his resignation on 17 October. At age 72, he became commander-in-chief of the Finnish armed forces after the Soviet attack on 30 November. In a letter to his daughter Sophie, he stated, \"I had not wanted to undertake the responsibility of commander-in-chief, as my age and my health entitled me, but I had to yield to appeals from the President of the Republic and the government, and now for the fourth time I am at war.\"{{hsp}}{{sfnp|Jagerskiold|1986}}\n\nHe addressed the first of his often controversial orders of the day to the Defence Forces on the day the war began:\n\n{{quote|The President of the Republic has appointed me on 30 November 1939 as Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces of the country.

We are fighting for our homes, our faith, and our country.{{sfnp|Jagerskiold|1986}}}} The defensive field fortifications they manned became known as the [[Mannerheim Line]].\n\n[[Field Marshal (Finland)|Field Marshal]] Mannerheim quickly organised his headquarters in [[Mikkeli]]. His chief of staff was Lieutenant General [[Aksel Airo]], while his close friend, General [[Rudolf Walden]], was sent as a representative of the headquarters to the cabinet from 3 December 1939 until 27 March 1940, after which he became defence minister.<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/>{{sfnp|Turtola|1994}}\n\nMannerheim spent most of the [[Winter War]] and [[Continuation War]] in his Mikkeli headquarters but made many visits to the front. Between the wars, he remained commander-in-chief.{{sfnp|Turtola|1994}}\n\nMannerheim kept relations with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s government as formal as possible. Before the Continuation War, the Germans offered Mannerheim command over 80,000 German troops in Finland. Mannerheim declined so as to not tie himself and Finland to [[Nazi]] war aims.{{sfnp|Jacobsson|1999}} In July 1941 the Finnish [[Army of Karelia]] was strengthened by the German [[163rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|163rd Infantry Division]].

Hitler visited Mannerheim on his 75th birthday.]]\n\nMannerheim's 75th birthday, 4 June 1942, was a national celebration. The government granted him the unique title of [[Marshal of Finland]] (''Suomen Marsalkka'' in Finnish, ''Marskalk av Finland'' in Swedish). So far he is the only person to receive the title. A surprise birthday visit by Hitler occurred on the day as he wished to visit the \"brave Finns (''die tapferen Finnen'')\" and their leader Mannerheim.{{hsp}}<ref name=\"Virkkunen\" />{{sfnp|Turtola|1994}} Mannerheim did not want to meet him at his headquarters or in Helsinki, as then it would seem like an official state visit. The meeting took place near [[Imatra]], in south-eastern Finland, and was arranged in secrecy.{{hsp}}<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/> From [[Immola Airfield]], Hitler, accompanied by President Ryti, was driven to where [[Baron]] Mannerheim was waiting at a railway siding. A speech from Hitler was followed by a birthday meal and negotiations between him and Mannerheim. Overall, Hitler spent about five hours in Finland; he reportedly asked the Finns to step up military operations against the Soviets, but apparently made no specific demands.{{hsp}}<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/>\n\nDuring the visit, an engineer of the Finnish broadcasting company [[YLE]], Thor Damen, succeeded in recording the first eleven minutes of [[Hitler and Mannerheim recording|Hitler's and Mannerheim's private conversation]]. This had to be done secretly, as Hitler never allowed off-guard recordings. Damen was assigned to record the official birthday speeches and Mannerheim's response and therefore placed microphones in some of the railway cars. However, Mannerheim and his guests chose to go to a car that did not have a microphone in it. Damen acted quickly, pushing a microphone through one of the car windows onto a net shelf just above where Hitler and Mannerheim were sitting. After eleven minutes of Hitler's and Mannerheim's private conversation, Hitler's [[Begleitkommando-SS|SS bodyguards]] spotted the cords coming out of the window and realized that the Finnish engineer was recording the conversation. They gestured to him to stop recording immediately, and he complied. The SS bodyguards demanded that the tape be destroyed, but YLE was allowed to keep the reel after promising to keep it in a sealed container. It was given to [[Kustaa Vilkuna]], head of the state censors' office, and in 1957 returned to [[Yle|YLE]]. It was released to the public a few years later. It is the only known recording of Hitler conversing.{{hsp}}<ref>[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/1076153999513 Helsingin Sanomat International Web-Edition] \u2013 \"Conversation secretly recorded in Finland helped a German actor prepare for Hitler role\" Helsingin Sanomat / First published in print 15 September 2004 in Finnish.</ref><ref>Recording available [[YLE]]'s [http://www.yle.fi/elavaarkisto/?s=s&g=1&ag=3&t=22&a=376 web-archive]</ref>\n\nThere is an unsubstantiated story that while conversing with Hitler, Mannerheim lit a cigar. Mannerheim expected that Hitler would ask Finland for more help against the [[Soviet Union]], which Mannerheim was unwilling to give. When Mannerheim lit up, all in attendance gasped, for [[Anti-tobacco movement in Nazi Germany|Hitler's aversion to smoking]] was well known. Nevertheless, Hitler continued the conversation calmly, with no comment. By this test, Mannerheim could judge if Hitler was speaking from a position of strength or weakness. He refused Hitler, knowing that Hitler was in a weak position, and could not dictate to him.{{hsp}}<ref name=Virkkunen />{{sfnp|Turtola|1994}}\n\nShortly thereafter, Mannerheim returned the visit, traveling to Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia.{{hsp}}<ref>Mannerheim 1954, pp. 454\u2013455.</ref>\n\n===End of war and presidency===\n[[File:Mannerheim Leaving Presidents Residence.png|thumb|left|[[Marshal of Finland|Marshal]] [[Baron]] Mannerheim leaves the [[Presidential Palace, Helsinki|Presidential Palace]] in [[Helsinki]] on 4 March 1946 after his short presidency]]\n\nIn June 1944, Baron Gustaf Mannerheim, to ensure German support while a major Soviet offensive was threatening Finland, thought it necessary to agree to the pact the German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] demanded. But even then Mannerheim distanced himself from the pact, and it fell to President [[Risto Ryti]] to sign it, so it came to be known as the [[Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement]]. This allowed Mannerheim to revoke the agreement upon the resignation of President Ryti at the start of August 1944. Mannerheim succeeded Ryti as president.<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/><ref name=Zetterberg>Seppo Zetterberg et al., eds., \"A Small Giant of Finnish History\" ''(Suomen historian pikkuj\u00e4ttil\u00e4inen),'' 2003</ref>\n\nWhen Germany was deemed sufficiently weakened, and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s summer offensive was fought to a standstill (see [[Battle of Tali-Ihantala]]) thanks to the June agreement with the Germans, Finland's leaders saw a chance to reach a peace with the Soviet Union.{{hsp}}<ref>Screen 2000, p. 205.</ref> At first, attempts were made to persuade Mannerheim to become prime minister, but he rejected them because of his age and lack of experience running a civil government. The next suggestion was to elect him [[Head of State]]. Risto Ryti would resign as President, and parliament would appoint Mannerheim as Regent. The use of the title \"Regent\" would have reflected the exceptional circumstances of Mannerheim's election. Mannerheim and Ryti both agreed, and Ryti submitted a notice of resignation on 1 August. The [[Parliament of Finland]] passed a special act conferring the presidency on Mannerheim on 4 August 1944. He took the oath of office the same day.<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/><ref name=\"Zetterberg\"/>\n\nA month after Mannerheim took office, the [[Continuation War]] was concluded on harsh terms, but ultimately far less harsh than those imposed on the other states bordering the [[Soviet Union]]. Finland retained its sovereignty, its parliamentary democracy, and its market economy. Territorial losses were considerable; all [[Karelia]] and [[Petsamo Province|Petsamo]] were lost. Numerous [[Karelia]]n refugees needed to be relocated. The war reparations were very heavy. Finland also had to fight the [[Lapland War]] against withdrawing German troops in the north, and at the same time demobilize its own army, making it harder to expel the Germans.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C68xN5lTN6EC&pg=PA87 | author=Kinnunen et al, eds.| title=Finland in World War II: History, Memory, Interpretations |year=2011 | page=87 | accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref> It is widely agreed that only Mannerheim could have guided Finland through these difficult times, when the Finnish people had to come to terms with the severe conditions of the armistice, their implementation by a Soviet-dominated [[Allied Control Commission]], and the task of post-war reconstruction.<ref name=\"Zetterberg\"/>\n\nBefore deciding to accept the Soviet demands, Mannerheim wrote a missive directly to Hitler:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nenye|first1=Vesa|last2=Munter|first2=Peter|last3=Wirtanen|first3=Toni|last4=Birks|first4=Chris|title=Finland at War: the Continuation and Lapland Wars 1941\u201345|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zb6gCwAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1472815262}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Our German brothers-in-arms will forever remain in our hearts.

I believe that the attitude of the German Army in northern Finland towards the local population and authorities will enter our history as a unique example of a correct and cordial relationship ... I deem it my duty to lead my people out of the war. I cannot and I will not turn the arms which you have so liberally supplied us against Germans.

Although he was elected for a full six-year term, he was 77 years old in 1944 and had accepted the office reluctantly after being urged to do so. The situation was exacerbated by frequent periods of ill-health, the demands of the Allied Control Commission, and the [[War-responsibility trials in Finland|war responsibility trials]]. He was afraid throughout most of his presidency that the commission would request that he be prosecuted for [[crimes against peace]]. This never happened. One of the reasons for this was Stalin's respect for and admiration of the Marshal. Stalin told a Finnish delegation in Moscow in 1947 that the Finns owe much to their old Marshal. Due to Mannerheim, Finland was not occupied.{{sfnp|Meri|1990|page=397}} Despite Mannerheim's criticisms of some of the demands of the Control Commission, he worked hard to carry out Finland's armistice obligations. He also emphasised the necessity of further work on reconstruction in Finland after the war.<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/><ref name=\"Zetterberg\"/>\n\nMannerheim was troubled by recurring health problems during 1945, and was absent on medical leave from his duties as president from November until February 1946. He spent six weeks in Portugal to restore his health. After the announcement of the verdicts in the war crimes trials in February, Mannerheim decided to resign. He believed that he had accomplished the duties he had been elected to carry out: The war was ended, the armistice obligations carried out, and war responsibility trials finished.\n\nMannerheim resigned as president on 11 March 1946, giving as his reason his declining health and his view that the tasks he had been selected to carry out had been accomplished. Even the Finnish communists, his enemies in 1918, appreciated his efforts and his role in maintaining the unity of the country during a difficult period. He was succeeded as president by the conservative Prime Minister [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi]].{{hsp}}<ref name=\"Zetterberg\"/>\n\n==Final days and death==\n[[File:Mannerheims funeral parade Helsinki.png|thumb|Mannerheim's funeral parade in Helsinki [[Helsinki Senate Square|Senate Square]] on 4 February 1951.]]\nAfter his resignation, [[Marshal of Finland|Marshal]] [[Baron]] Mannerheim bought Kirkniemi Manor in [[Lohja]], intending to spend his retirement there. In June 1946, he underwent an operation for a perforated [[peptic ulcer]], and in October of that year he was diagnosed with a [[duodenal ulcer]]. In early 1947, it was recommended that he should travel to the Valmont Sanatorium in [[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]], to recuperate and write his memoirs. Valmont was to be Mannerheim's main residence for the remainder of his life, although he regularly returned to Finland, and also visited Sweden, France and Italy.<ref>Screen 2000, p. 245.</ref>\n\nBecause Mannerheim was old and sickly, he personally wrote only certain passages of his memoirs. Some other parts he dictated. The remaining parts were written from his recollections by Mannerheim's various assistants, such as Colonel Alad\u00e1r Paasonen; General Erik Heinrichs; Generals Grandell, Olenius and Martola; and Colonel Viljanen, a war historian. As long as Mannerheim was able to read, he proofread the typewritten drafts of his memoirs. He was almost totally silent about his private life, and focused instead on Finland's history, especially between 1917 and 1944. When Mannerheim suffered a fatal [[bowel obstruction]] in January 1951,{{hsp}}<ref>Screen 2000, p. 252.</ref> his memoirs were not yet in their finished form. They were published after his death.{{hsp}}{{sfnp|J\u00e4gerski\u00f6ld|1983}}\n\nMannerheim died on 27 January 1951 (28 January Finland time), in the Cantonal Hospital in [[Lausanne]] ({{Lang-fr|L'H\u00f4pital cantonal \u00e0 Lausanne}}; modern [[Lausanne University Hospital]]{{hsp}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chuv.ch/fr/chuv-home/en-bref/historique/|title=Historique|website=Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois|access-date=2018-02-24}}</ref>), Switzerland.

This may be partly due to his refusal to enter partisan politics (although his sympathies were more right-wing than left-wing), his claim always to serve the fatherland without selfish motives, his personal courage in visiting the frontlines, his ability to work diligently into his late seventies, and his foreign political farsightedness in preparing for the Soviet invasion of Finland years before it occurred.<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/>\n\nMannerheim's birthday, 4 June, is celebrated as Flag Day by the [[Finnish Defence Forces]]. This decision was made by the Finnish government on the occasion of his 75th birthday in 1942, when he was also granted the title of [[Field marshal (Finland)|Marshal of Finland]]. Flag Day is celebrated with a national parade, and rewards and promotions for members of the defence forces. The life and times of Mannerheim are memorialized in the [[Mannerheim Museum]].<ref name=Museum/> The most prominent boulevard in the Finnish capital was renamed [[Mannerheimintie]] (Mannerheim Road) in the Marshal's honour during his lifetime.\n\nVarious landmarks across Finland honor Mannerheim, including most famously the [[Equestrian statue of Marshal Mannerheim|Equestrian statue]] located on Helsinki's Mannerheimintie in front of the later-built [[Kiasma]] museum of modern art. Turku's Mannerheim Park includes a statue of him. Tampere's Mannerheim statue depicting the victorious Civil War general of the Whites was eventually placed in the forest some kilometres outside the city (in part due to lingering controversy over Mannerheim's Civil War role).
