A largely [[Internet activism|online phenomenon]], the alt-right originated in the U.S. during the 2010s, although it has since established a presence in various other countries. The term is ill-defined, having been used in different ways by various self-described \"alt-rightists\", media commentators, and academics. Groups which have been identified as alt-right also espouse [[white supremacism]], [[white separatism]], [[anti-immigration|severe immigration restrictions]], and [[antisemitism]].\n\nIn 2010, the American white nationalist [[Richard B. Spencer]] launched ''The Alternative Right'' [[webzine]]. Spencer's \"alternative right\" was influenced by earlier forms of American white nationalism, as well as [[paleoconservatism]], the [[Dark Enlightenment]], and the [[Nouvelle Droite]]. His term was shortened to \"alt-right\" and popularised by far-right participants of [[/pol/]], the politics board of web forum [[4chan]]. It came to be associated with other white nationalist websites and groups, including Andrew Anglin's ''[[Daily Stormer]]'', Brad Griffin's ''Occidental Dissent'', and Matthew Heimbach's [[Traditionalist Worker Party]]. Following the 2014 [[Gamergate controversy]], the alt-right made increasing use of [[trolling]] and [[online harassment]] to raise its profile. In 2015, it attracted broader attention\u2014particularly through coverage on [[Steve Bannon]]'s [[Breitbart News]]\u2014due to alt-right support for [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]]. On [[2016 United States presidential election|being elected]], Trump renounced the movement. Attempting to move from a web-based to a street-based movement, Spencer and other alt-rightists organised the 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], Virginia, which faced significant [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] opposition. After this, the movement began to decline.\n\nThe alt-right is a [[Scientific racism|biologically racist]] movement promoting a form of far-right [[identity politics]] for [[European Americans]]. Part of its membership supports [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrationist]] policies to ensure a continued white majority in the United States. Others call for the breakup of the country to form a [[white separatism|white separatist]] [[ethno-state]] in [[North America]]. Some alt-rightists seek to make white nationalism socially respectable in the U.S., while others\u2014known as the \"[[Fourteen Words|1488]]\" scene\u2014adopt openly [[white supremacism|white supremacist]] and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] stances. Some alt-rightists are [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]], promoting a [[conspiracy theory]] that there is [[Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory|a Jewish plot]] to bring about [[White genocide conspiracy theory|white genocide]]; other alt-rightists view most Jews as members of the white race. The alt-right is [[anti-feminism|anti-feminist]], advocates for a more [[Patriarchy|patriarchal society]], and intersects with the [[men's rights movement]] and other sectors of the online [[manosphere]]. Alt-rightists generally support [[Anti-interventionism|anti-interventionist]] and [[Isolationism|isolationist]] [[Foreign policy|foreign policies]] alongside [[Protectionism|economic protectionism]]. Individuals aligned with many of the alt-right's ideas but not its white nationalism have been termed \"[[alt-lite]]\".\n\nThe alt-right distinguished itself from earlier forms of white nationalism through its largely online presence and its heavy use of irony and humor, particularly through the promotion of [[Internet memes]] like [[Pepe the Frog]]. Membership was overwhelmingly white and male, with academic and anti-fascist observers linking its growth to deteriorating living standards and prospects, anxieties about the place of white masculinity, and anger at increasingly visible [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] movements such as [[Black Lives Matter]]. Groups using the \"alt-right\" label have been characterised as [[hate group]]s,<ref name=\"ADL\">{{cite web |url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/alt-right-a-primer-about-the-new-white-supremacy |title=Alt Right: A Primer about the New White Supremacy |website=Anti-Defamation League |accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/alt-right |title=Alt-Right |work=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref> while alt-right material has contributed to the radicalization of white men responsible for various far-right murders and [[Right-wing terrorism|terrorist]] attacks in the U.S. since 2014.<ref name=\"SPLC\">{{cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/20180205/alt-right-killing-people|title=The Alt-Right is Killing People|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=February 5, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite news |url=https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/adl-report-white-supremacist-murders-more-than-doubled-in-2017/ |title=ADL Report: White Supremacist Murders More Than Doubled in 2017 |accessdate=January 26, 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"DefenseOne\">{{cite news|accessdate=March 2, 2018|title=White Supremacists Killed More Americans Last Year Than Any Other Domestic-Extremist Group|url=http://www.defenseone.com/threats/2018/01/resurgent-threat-white-supremacist-violence/145243/|newspaper=Defense One}}</ref> Opposition to the alt-right has come from many areas of the political spectrum including [[Socialism in the United States|socialists]], [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]].

At that point, he argued, the government would deport all undocumented migrants from the country and then introduce measures to encourage all other non-whites to emigrate from the country.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=16}} Other alt-rightists are critical of the idea of breaking up the United States into ethno-states, arguing that this would mean breaking up the country that their Euro-American ancestors fought to build.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=224}} They instead argue for restrictive immigration policies to ensure that the U.S. continues to be a white-majority state.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=226}}\n\nRather than seeking independent white ethno-states, some alt-rightists promote a pan-white empire spanning Europe and North America.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=172}} Spencer noted that he did not want his proposed white ethno-state to be small, and that he wanted it to eventually form part of \"a global empire... something on a very large scale. And that is a homeland for all white people, whether you're German or Celtic or Slavic or English.\"{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=24\u201325}} He described this as \"one big [[Roman Empire]]\" and suggested that it should engage in imperial expansion into the [[Near East]], focusing on conquering [[Istanbul]]; in Spencer's words, Istanbul was \"such a profoundly symbolic city. Retaking it, that would be a statement to the world.\"{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=25}} He added that its present [[Turkish people|Turkish]] inhabitants would be made to leave, for they could go to \"the Middle East or something.

Heimbach for instance has addressed meetings of the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] in Greece and the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]].{{sfn|Michael|2019|p=74}} Various U.S.-based alt-rightists used social media to encourage support for the [[Alternative for Germany]] party in that country's [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]].{{sfn|Morstatter|Galstyan|Shao|Karunasekera|2018|p=621}}\n\n== Tactics ==\nAlt-rightists often make reference to [[freedom of speech]] when calling for their views to be heard in public discourse.{{sfn|Hofmann-Kuroda|2017|p=369}} A recurrent tactic of alt-rightists is to present themselves\u2014as white men\u2014as victims of oppression and prejudice; this subverts many leftist arguments about other social groupings being victims and is designed to infuriate leftist opponents.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=73}}\n\nThe alt-right also make heavy use of imagery drawn from popular culture for its own purposes.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|pp=256\u2013257}} For instance, the American singer [[Taylor Swift]] is often held up as an idealised example of \"Aryan\" beauty.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=257}} When describing their own conversion to the movement, alt-rightists refer to themselves as having been \"getting red pilled\", a reference to a scene in the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]'' in which Neo, the protagonist, chooses to discover the truth behind reality by consuming a red pill.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=83|2a1=Kelly|2y=2017|2p=74|3a1=Niewert|3y=2017|3p=257}} On alt-right blogs and message boards, members often discuss how they were \"red-pilled\" originally.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=83\u201384}} Alt-rightists have also adopted [[milk]] as a symbol of their views; various members have used the words \"Heil Milk\" in their online posts while Spencer included an [[emoji]] of a glass of milk on his Twitter profile along with the statement that he was \"very tolerant... lactose tolerant!\"{{sfn|St\u0103nescu|2018|p=104}} The [[animal studies]] scholar Vasile St\u0103nescu suggested that this notion drew upon the 19th century pseudoscientific idea that Northern Europeans had become biologically superior to many other human populations because they consumed high quantities of milk and meat products.{{sfn|St\u0103nescu|2018|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\n=== Use of humor and irony ===\n\nThe alt-right makes strong use of humor and irony in its rhetoric.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=20|2a1=Niewert|2y=2017|2p=256}} As noted by Nagle, the alt-right's use of humor renders it difficult to tell \"what political views were genuinely held and what were merely, as they used to say, for the lulz.\"{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=2}} The alt-right presented an image which was much less threatening than that of earlier white nationalist groups, and thus was able to attract people who would be willing to visit alt-right websites who would not have considered attending neo-Nazi or KKK events.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=25}} As noted by Hawley, \"whereas older white nationalists came across as bitter, reactionary, and antisocial, much of the Alt-Right comes across as youthful, light-hearted, and jovial\u2014even as it says the most abhorrent things about racial and religious minorities.\"{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=20}} Members of the alt-right sometimes made fun of the earnestness and seriousness of earlier white nationalists such as William Pierce.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=76}}\n\nAnother of the tactics employed online by alt-rightists is to parody their leftist opponents. One teenaged American alt-rightist for instance created a Twitter account for a fictional individual whom they described as an \"LGBTQ+ pansexual nonbinary POC transwoman\" who was a \"Journalist for BLM. Always stayin [[woke]]\".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=49\u201350}} Alt-rightists also orchestrated pranks, again to cause alarm among opponents. For instance, during the 2016 presidential campaign alt-rightists presented claims that they were plotting to send representatives posing as officials to voting booths where they would suppress ethnic minority turnout. There was no such plot, but press sources like ''[[Politico]]'' picked up on the claims and presented them as fact.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=75\u201376}} Such incidents reflected the alt-right's willingness to lie to advance their interests.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=75}} This tendency toward trolling renders it difficult for journalists to learn more about the alt-right because those members they talked to were willing to deceive them for their amusement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=74}}\n\nNagle suggested that the alt-right's use of such tactics made it strongly transgressive and thus part of a tradition that she traced back to the work of the [[Marquis de Sade]] in the 18th century.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|pp=28\u201329}} She argued that it was with the alt-right that \"the transgressive anti-moral style\" reached \"its final detachment from any egalitarian philosophy of the left or Christian morality of the right\".{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=39}}\n\n===Use of memes===\n[[File:Feels good

In contrast, he thought, older white nationalists were keener to retain links to patriotic American imagery because they nostalgically recalled a period of U.S. history when segregation and overt white dominance were a part of life and believed that this system could be reinstated.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nWendling believed that a large portion of the alt-right were university students or recent graduates, many bearing a particular grudge against political correctness.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=8}} The alt-right ideologue Greg Johnson suggested that the alt-right was drawing in better educated people than previous white nationalist movements because the career prospects for college-educated European Americans had declined by the late 2000s. Whereas a college degree was previously perceived as a guaranteed ticket to a middle-class lifestyle, he noted that this was no longer the case and that many college and university educated people felt resentful and, due to unemployment or underemployment, had growing amounts of time on their hands which they could spend on the Internet.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nYiannopoulos claimed that some \"young rebels\" are drawn to the alt-right not for deeply political reasons, but \"because it promises fun, transgression, and a challenge to social norms\". According to ''The New Yorker'', \"testing the strength of the speech taboos that revolve around conventional politics-of what can be said, and how directly\" is a major component of alt-right identity. The beliefs that make the alt-right perceptible as a movement \"are in their essence not matters of substance but of style\" and the alt-right's tone may just be concealing \"a more familiar politics\".<ref>{{cite article |last=Wallace-Wells |first=Benjamin |date=May 5, 2016 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/benjamin-wallace-wells/is-the-alt-right-for-real |title=Is the Alt-Right for Real? |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=April 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA research study of 447 self-identified alt-right members found higher levels of [[Dark triad|dark triad]] traits compared to the general population; and that members of the alt-right were more likely to express prejudice against black people and admit to engaging in aggressive behavior. Alt-right members also had significantly high levels of dehumanization, with the mean alt-right scores comparable to how the general public views the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].

In her view, much of the \"groundwork\" for this discourse was set forth by the conservative movement in the years following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.{{sfn|Kelly|2017|p=69}} Hawley concurred that American conservatism was \"at least somewhat responsible for the rise of the Alt-Right\" because some individuals within the conservative movement, such as [[Ann Coulter]], had \"effectively delegitimized complaints about hate speech and racism\" as part of their attacks on political correctness in the years before the alt-right's appearance.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=44}} This is something acknowledged by some conservatives, like columnist [[Matt K. Lewis]].{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nCommentator [[Angela Nagle]] said that a mainstream \"alt-light\" more interested in performance than political goals helped the alt-right in its rise, saying that should the alt-right grow to generate great violence, those on the right who helped to make the alt-right look attractive, such as Yiannopoulos, \"will have to take responsibility for having played their role\" in enabling its growth.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=9}} She also suggested that \"the hysterical liberal call-out\" culture of the 2010s, in which \"everyone from saccharine pop stars to [[Justin Trudeau]] [was called] a 'white supremacist' and everyone who wasn't [[2016 United States presidential election#Notable expressions, phrases, and statements|With Her]] a sexist\" made it more difficult for people to recognize when a far-right movement really emerged online; she compared the situation with the tale of [[The Boy Who Cried Wolf]].{{sfn|Nagle|2017|pp=8\u20139}} Disagreeing with Nagle's view that the alt-right was primarily a \"response to the stupidity of marginal Internet liberalism\", the anti-fascist reporter Jay Firestone\u2014who had spent three months undercover in New York's alt-right community\u2014instead argued that it was a \"response to decades of decline in standards of living for working people, amid the proliferation of unemployment and meaningless, dead-end jobs.\"<ref>{{cite article |last=Firestone |first=Jay |title=Three Months Inside Alt-Right New York |website=Commune |date=Spring 2019 |url=https://communemag.com/alt-right-new-york/ |accessdate=March 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Philip W. Gray cited several reasons for the emergence of the alt-right. In his analysis, new online media had reduced the conservative movement's ability to enforce its boundaries against the far right, while the growing distance of the [[Second World War]] meant that pride in the U.S. victory over [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922-1943)|Fascist Italy]] provided less of a barrier to the American far-right than it had when there were still large numbers of people who remembered the conflict.{{sfn|Gray|2018|pp=151\u2013152}} Gray also argued that the alt-right was a reaction against the left-wing racial and social agitation of the 2010s, in particular the Black Lives Matter movement and the popularisation of concepts like [[white privilege]] and [[male privilege]], as well as events like the racial unrest in [[2015 Baltimore protests|Baltimore]] and [[Ferguson unrest|Ferguson]] and the shooting of police officers in [[2016 shooting of Dallas police officers|Dallas]] and [[2016 shooting of Baton Rouge police officers|Baton Rouge]].{{sfn|Gray|2018|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\n== Links to violence and terrorism ==\n{{quote box\n|quote=The sprawling networks the alt-right has built around its poisonous, racist ideology have violence at its core in its pursuit of a white ethnostate.

He noted that if the left wanted to continue using identity politics as the basis of much of its mobilization, it would have to accept [[white identity politics]] as a permanent fixture of the political landscape.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=160}} Similarly, in highlighting the commonalities between alt-right and \"left-identitarian\" forms of identity politics, Gray suggested the alt-right's presence might encourage \"the intersectional Left and its allies\" to increasingly critique the theoretical basis on which their own identity politics is built.{{sfn|Gray|2018|p=153}} Other commentators, like the conservative [[David Frum]], have suggested that if issues like immigration policy were discussed more openly in public discourse, then the alt-right would no longer be able to monopolize them.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=164}}\n\nSome opponents sought to undermine the alt-right's stereotype of leftists as being devoid of humor and joy by using its own tactics of humor and irony against it. For instance, when alt-rightists became angry or upset, some of their opponents described them as \"snowflakes\" who were being \"triggered\".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=221\u2013222}} Anti-fascist activists also adopted the alt-right's use of pranks; on several occasions they publicized events in which they were purportedly meeting to destroy Confederate monuments or gravestones. Alt-rightists mobilized to publicly defend these sites, only to find that no such anti-fascist event was happening at all.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=221}} Within feminist circles, the alt-right's desired future was repeatedly compared to the [[Republic of Gilead]], the fictional dystopia in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' (1985) and its [[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|2017 television adaptation]].{{sfn|Marghitu|Johnson|2018|p=184}}\n\n[[File:Charlottesville \"Unite the Right\" Rally (35780272084).jpg|thumb|left|Counter-protesters at the 2017 Unite the Right rally.]]\n\nVarious opponents have also employed doxing, publicly revealing the identities and addresses of alt-rightists, many of whom had previously acted anonymously.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=166}} This tactic discourages individuals from involving themselves in alt-right activities to begin with, as they fear that should they be outed as alt-rightists they might face repercussions such as job loss, social ostracization, or violence.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=168}} From 2016 onward, some anti-fascist opponents of the alt-right also resorted to physical confrontation and violence against the movement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=169}} On Trump's inauguration day, for example, a masked anti-fascist punched Spencer in the face when he was talking to reporters; the footage was widely shared online.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=169|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2pp=2\u20133}} Hawley noted that this tactic could be counter-productive to the anti-alt-right case, as it reinforces the narrative that alt-rightists peacefully engaging in their constitutionally-protected right to free speech were being victimized.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\nOther commentators have called for more vigorous policing of the web by governments and companies to deal with the alt-right.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=161}} If denied access to mainstream social media outlets, the alt-right would be restricted to far-right online venues like Stormfront, where it would be isolated and ignored from those not already committed to its cause.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=163}} Many in the alt-right concur that denying it access to social media would have a devastating effect on its ability to proselytize.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=161}} It has however been suggested that such censorship could backfire, as it would play into the alt-right narrative that those campaigning for white interests were being marginalized by the establishment, thus aiding the movement's recruitment.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=164}} Suppressing the alt-right in this manner would also set a precedent which could be repeated for other groups in future, including leftist ones.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=165}} Phillips and Yi argued that such leftist attempts to prevent alt-right speech reflected an \"authoritarian shift\" which was becoming \"increasingly hegemonic\" within the American Left and that endorsed the view that \"limiting or preventing the public speech of historically privileged groups (typically, whites, males) is acceptable until power relations are equalized.\"{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=226}}\n\n== \"Alt-left\" ==\n{{anchor|Alt-left}}\nAfter the murder of a counter-protester at the Unite the Right Rally, in a press conference Trump stated that there was \"blame on both sides\" for the violence, stating that some of the counter-protesters were part of the \"very, very violent ... alt-left\".{{refn|<ref>Shear, Michael D. and Haberman, Maggie (August 15, 2017).

Pepe the Frog is an [[Internet meme]] which has been appropriated by the alt-right as a symbol of the movement.</ref>).]]\n\nThe '''alt-right''', an abbreviation of '''alternative right''', is a loosely connected [[Far-right politics|far-right]], [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] movement based in the United States. A largely [[Internet activism|online phenomenon]], the alt-right originated in the U.S. during the 2010s, although it has since established a presence in various other countries. The term is ill-defined, having been used in different ways by various self-described \"alt-rightists\", media commentators, and academics. Groups which have been identified as alt-right also espouse [[white supremacism]], [[white separatism]], [[anti-immigration|severe immigration restrictions]], and [[antisemitism]].\n\nIn 2010, the American white nationalist [[Richard B. Spencer]] launched ''The Alternative Right'' [[webzine]]. Spencer's \"alternative right\" was influenced by earlier forms of American white nationalism, as well as [[paleoconservatism]], the [[Dark Enlightenment]], and the [[Nouvelle Droite]]. His term was shortened to \"alt-right\" and popularised by far-right participants of [[/pol/]], the politics board of web forum [[4chan]]. It came to be associated with other white nationalist websites and groups, including Andrew Anglin's ''[[Daily Stormer]]'', Brad Griffin's ''Occidental Dissent'', and Matthew Heimbach's [[Traditionalist Worker Party]]. Following the 2014 [[Gamergate controversy]], the alt-right made increasing use of [[trolling]] and [[online harassment]] to raise its profile. In 2015, it attracted broader attention\u2014particularly through coverage on [[Steve Bannon]]'s [[Breitbart News]]\u2014due to alt-right support for [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]]. On [[2016 United States presidential election|being elected]], Trump renounced the movement. Attempting to move from a web-based to a street-based movement, Spencer and other alt-rightists organised the 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], Virginia, which faced significant [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] opposition. After this, the movement began to decline.\n\nThe alt-right is a [[Scientific racism|biologically racist]] movement promoting a form of far-right [[identity politics]] for [[European Americans]]. Part of its membership supports [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrationist]] policies to ensure a continued white majority in the United States. Others call for the breakup of the country to form a [[white separatism|white separatist]] [[ethno-state]] in [[North America]]. Some alt-rightists seek to make white nationalism socially respectable in the U.S., while others\u2014known as the \"[[Fourteen Words|1488]]\" scene\u2014adopt openly [[white supremacism|white supremacist]] and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] stances. Some alt-rightists are [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]], promoting a [[conspiracy theory]] that there is [[Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory|a Jewish plot]] to bring about [[White genocide conspiracy theory|white genocide]]; other alt-rightists view most Jews as members of the white race. The alt-right is [[anti-feminism|anti-feminist]], advocates for a more [[Patriarchy|patriarchal society]], and intersects with the [[men's rights movement]] and other sectors of the online [[manosphere]]. Alt-rightists generally support [[Anti-interventionism|anti-interventionist]] and [[Isolationism|isolationist]] [[Foreign policy|foreign policies]] alongside [[Protectionism|economic protectionism]]. Individuals aligned with many of the alt-right's ideas but not its white nationalism have been termed \"[[alt-lite]]\".\n\nThe alt-right distinguished itself from earlier forms of white nationalism through its largely online presence and its heavy use of irony and humor, particularly through the promotion of [[Internet memes]] like [[Pepe the Frog]]. Membership was overwhelmingly white and male, with academic and anti-fascist observers linking its growth to deteriorating living standards and prospects, anxieties about the place of white masculinity, and anger at increasingly visible [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] movements such as [[Black Lives Matter]].

At that point, he argued, the government would deport all undocumented migrants from the country and then introduce measures to encourage all other non-whites to emigrate from the country.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=16}} Other alt-rightists are critical of the idea of breaking up the United States into ethno-states, arguing that this would mean breaking up the country that their Euro-American ancestors fought to build.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=224}} They instead argue for restrictive immigration policies to ensure that the U.S. continues to be a white-majority state.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=226}}\n\nRather than seeking independent white ethno-states, some alt-rightists promote a pan-white empire spanning Europe and North America.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=172}} Spencer noted that he did not want his proposed white ethno-state to be small, and that he wanted it to eventually form part of \"a global empire... something on a very large scale. And that is a homeland for all white people, whether you're German or Celtic or Slavic or English.\"{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=24\u201325}} He described this as \"one big [[Roman Empire]]\" and suggested that it should engage in imperial expansion into the [[Near East]], focusing on conquering [[Istanbul]]; in Spencer's words, Istanbul was \"such a profoundly symbolic city. Retaking it, that would be a statement to the world.\"{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=25}} He added that its present [[Turkish people|Turkish]] inhabitants would be made to leave, for they could go to \"the Middle East or something.

Heimbach for instance has addressed meetings of the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] in Greece and the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]].{{sfn|Michael|2019|p=74}} Various U.S.-based alt-rightists used social media to encourage support for the [[Alternative for Germany]] party in that country's [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]].{{sfn|Morstatter|Galstyan|Shao|Karunasekera|2018|p=621}}\n\n== Tactics ==\nAlt-rightists often make reference to [[freedom of speech]] when calling for their views to be heard in public discourse.{{sfn|Hofmann-Kuroda|2017|p=369}} A recurrent tactic of alt-rightists is to present themselves\u2014as white men\u2014as victims of oppression and prejudice; this subverts many leftist arguments about other social groupings being victims and is designed to infuriate leftist opponents.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=73}}\n\nThe alt-right also make heavy use of imagery drawn from popular culture for its own purposes.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|pp=256\u2013257}} For instance, the American singer [[Taylor Swift]] is often held up as an idealised example of \"Aryan\" beauty.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=257}} When describing their own conversion to the movement, alt-rightists refer to themselves as having been \"getting red pilled\", a reference to a scene in the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]'' in which Neo, the protagonist, chooses to discover the truth behind reality by consuming a red pill.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=83|2a1=Kelly|2y=2017|2p=74|3a1=Niewert|3y=2017|3p=257}} On alt-right blogs and message boards, members often discuss how they were \"red-pilled\" originally.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=83\u201384}} Alt-rightists have also adopted [[milk]] as a symbol of their views; various members have used the words \"Heil Milk\" in their online posts while Spencer included an [[emoji]] of a glass of milk on his Twitter profile along with the statement that he was \"very tolerant... lactose tolerant!\"{{sfn|St\u0103nescu|2018|p=104}} The [[animal studies]] scholar Vasile St\u0103nescu suggested that this notion drew upon the 19th century pseudoscientific idea that Northern Europeans had become biologically superior to many other human populations because they consumed high quantities of milk and meat products.{{sfn|St\u0103nescu|2018|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\n=== Use of humor and irony ===\n\nThe alt-right makes strong use of humor and irony in its rhetoric.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=20|2a1=Niewert|2y=2017|2p=256}} As noted by Nagle, the alt-right's use of humor renders it difficult to tell \"what political views were genuinely held and what were merely, as they used to say, for the lulz.\"{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=2}} The alt-right presented an image which was much less threatening than that of earlier white nationalist groups, and thus was able to attract people who would be willing to visit alt-right websites who would not have considered attending neo-Nazi or KKK events.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=25}} As noted by Hawley, \"whereas older white nationalists came across as bitter, reactionary, and antisocial, much of the Alt-Right comes across as youthful, light-hearted, and jovial\u2014even as it says the most abhorrent things about racial and religious minorities.\"{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=20}} Members of the alt-right sometimes made fun of the earnestness and seriousness of earlier white nationalists such as William Pierce.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=76}}\n\nAnother of the tactics employed online by alt-rightists is to parody their leftist opponents. One teenaged American alt-rightist for instance created a Twitter account for a fictional individual whom they described as an \"LGBTQ+ pansexual nonbinary POC transwoman\" who was a \"Journalist for BLM. Always stayin [[woke]]\".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=49\u201350}} Alt-rightists also orchestrated pranks, again to cause alarm among opponents. For instance, during the 2016 presidential campaign alt-rightists presented claims that they were plotting to send representatives posing as officials to voting booths where they would suppress ethnic minority turnout. There was no such plot, but press sources like ''[[Politico]]'' picked up on the claims and presented them as fact.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=75\u201376}} Such incidents reflected the alt-right's willingness to lie to advance their interests.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=75}} This tendency toward trolling renders it difficult for journalists to learn more about the alt-right because those members they talked to were willing to deceive them for their amusement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=74}}\n\nNagle suggested that the alt-right's use of such tactics made it strongly transgressive and thus part of a tradition that she traced back to the work of the [[Marquis de Sade]] in the 18th century.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|pp=28\u201329}} She argued that it was with the alt-right that \"the transgressive anti-moral style\" reached \"its final detachment from any egalitarian philosophy of the left or Christian morality of the right\".{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=39}}\n\n===Use of memes===\n[[File:Feels good

In contrast, he thought, older white nationalists were keener to retain links to patriotic American imagery because they nostalgically recalled a period of U.S. history when segregation and overt white dominance were a part of life and believed that this system could be reinstated.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nWendling believed that a large portion of the alt-right were university students or recent graduates, many bearing a particular grudge against political correctness.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=8}} The alt-right ideologue Greg Johnson suggested that the alt-right was drawing in better educated people than previous white nationalist movements because the career prospects for college-educated European Americans had declined by the late 2000s. Whereas a college degree was previously perceived as a guaranteed ticket to a middle-class lifestyle, he noted that this was no longer the case and that many college and university educated people felt resentful and, due to unemployment or underemployment, had growing amounts of time on their hands which they could spend on the Internet.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nYiannopoulos claimed that some \"young rebels\" are drawn to the alt-right not for deeply political reasons, but \"because it promises fun, transgression, and a challenge to social norms\". According to ''The New Yorker'', \"testing the strength of the speech taboos that revolve around conventional politics-of what can be said, and how directly\" is a major component of alt-right identity. The beliefs that make the alt-right perceptible as a movement \"are in their essence not matters of substance but of style\" and the alt-right's tone may just be concealing \"a more familiar politics\".<ref>{{cite article |last=Wallace-Wells |first=Benjamin |date=May 5, 2016 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/benjamin-wallace-wells/is-the-alt-right-for-real |title=Is the Alt-Right for Real? |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=April 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA research study of 447 self-identified alt-right members found higher levels of [[Dark triad|dark triad]] traits compared to the general population; and that members of the alt-right were more likely to express prejudice against black people and admit to engaging in aggressive behavior. Alt-right members also had significantly high levels of dehumanization, with the mean alt-right scores comparable to how the general public views the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].

In her view, much of the \"groundwork\" for this discourse was set forth by the conservative movement in the years following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.{{sfn|Kelly|2017|p=69}} Hawley concurred that American conservatism was \"at least somewhat responsible for the rise of the Alt-Right\" because some individuals within the conservative movement, such as [[Ann Coulter]], had \"effectively delegitimized complaints about hate speech and racism\" as part of their attacks on political correctness in the years before the alt-right's appearance.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=44}} This is something acknowledged by some conservatives, like columnist [[Matt K. Lewis]].{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nCommentator [[Angela Nagle]] said that a mainstream \"alt-light\" more interested in performance than political goals helped the alt-right in its rise, saying that should the alt-right grow to generate great violence, those on the right who helped to make the alt-right look attractive, such as Yiannopoulos, \"will have to take responsibility for having played their role\" in enabling its growth.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=9}} She also suggested that \"the hysterical liberal call-out\" culture of the 2010s, in which \"everyone from saccharine pop stars to [[Justin Trudeau]] [was called] a 'white supremacist' and everyone who wasn't [[2016 United States presidential election#Notable expressions, phrases, and statements|With Her]] a sexist\" made it more difficult for people to recognize when a far-right movement really emerged online; she compared the situation with the tale of [[The Boy Who Cried Wolf]].{{sfn|Nagle|2017|pp=8\u20139}} Disagreeing with Nagle's view that the alt-right was primarily a \"response to the stupidity of marginal Internet liberalism\", the anti-fascist reporter Jay Firestone\u2014who had spent three months undercover in New York's alt-right community\u2014instead argued that it was a \"response to decades of decline in standards of living for working people, amid the proliferation of unemployment and meaningless, dead-end jobs.\"<ref>{{cite article |last=Firestone |first=Jay |title=Three Months Inside Alt-Right New York |website=Commune |date=Spring 2019 |url=https://communemag.com/alt-right-new-york/ |accessdate=March 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Philip W. Gray cited several reasons for the emergence of the alt-right. In his analysis, new online media had reduced the conservative movement's ability to enforce its boundaries against the far right, while the growing distance of the [[Second World War]] meant that pride in the U.S. victory over [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922-1943)|Fascist Italy]] provided less of a barrier to the American far-right than it had when there were still large numbers of people who remembered the conflict.{{sfn|Gray|2018|pp=151\u2013152}} Gray also argued that the alt-right was a reaction against the left-wing racial and social agitation of the 2010s, in particular the Black Lives Matter movement and the popularisation of concepts like [[white privilege]] and [[male privilege]], as well as events like the racial unrest in [[2015 Baltimore protests|Baltimore]] and [[Ferguson unrest|Ferguson]] and the shooting of police officers in [[2016 shooting of Dallas police officers|Dallas]] and [[2016 shooting of Baton Rouge police officers|Baton Rouge]].{{sfn|Gray|2018|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\n== Links to violence and terrorism ==\n{{quote box\n|quote=The sprawling networks the alt-right has built around its poisonous, racist ideology have violence at its core in its pursuit of a white ethnostate.

He noted that if the left wanted to continue using identity politics as the basis of much of its mobilization, it would have to accept [[white identity politics]] as a permanent fixture of the political landscape.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=160}} Similarly, in highlighting the commonalities between alt-right and \"left-identitarian\" forms of identity politics, Gray suggested the alt-right's presence might encourage \"the intersectional Left and its allies\" to increasingly critique the theoretical basis on which their own identity politics is built.{{sfn|Gray|2018|p=153}} Other commentators, like the conservative [[David Frum]], have suggested that if issues like immigration policy were discussed more openly in public discourse, then the alt-right would no longer be able to monopolize them.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=164}}\n\nSome opponents sought to undermine the alt-right's stereotype of leftists as being devoid of humor and joy by using its own tactics of humor and irony against it. For instance, when alt-rightists became angry or upset, some of their opponents described them as \"snowflakes\" who were being \"triggered\".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=221\u2013222}} Anti-fascist activists also adopted the alt-right's use of pranks; on several occasions they publicized events in which they were purportedly meeting to destroy Confederate monuments or gravestones. Alt-rightists mobilized to publicly defend these sites, only to find that no such anti-fascist event was happening at all.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=221}} Within feminist circles, the alt-right's desired future was repeatedly compared to the [[Republic of Gilead]], the fictional dystopia in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' (1985) and its [[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|2017 television adaptation]].{{sfn|Marghitu|Johnson|2018|p=184}}\n\n[[File:Charlottesville \"Unite the Right\" Rally (35780272084).jpg|thumb|left|Counter-protesters at the 2017 Unite the Right rally.]]\n\nVarious opponents have also employed doxing, publicly revealing the identities and addresses of alt-rightists, many of whom had previously acted anonymously.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=166}} This tactic discourages individuals from involving themselves in alt-right activities to begin with, as they fear that should they be outed as alt-rightists they might face repercussions such as job loss, social ostracization, or violence.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=168}} From 2016 onward, some anti-fascist opponents of the alt-right also resorted to physical confrontation and violence against the movement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=169}} On Trump's inauguration day, for example, a masked anti-fascist punched Spencer in the face when he was talking to reporters; the footage was widely shared online.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=169|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2pp=2\u20133}} Hawley noted that this tactic could be counter-productive to the anti-alt-right case, as it reinforces the narrative that alt-rightists peacefully engaging in their constitutionally-protected right to free speech were being victimized.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\nOther commentators have called for more vigorous policing of the web by governments and companies to deal with the alt-right.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=161}} If denied access to mainstream social media outlets, the alt-right would be restricted to far-right online venues like Stormfront, where it would be isolated and ignored from those not already committed to its cause.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=163}} Many in the alt-right concur that denying it access to social media would have a devastating effect on its ability to proselytize.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=161}} It has however been suggested that such censorship could backfire, as it would play into the alt-right narrative that those campaigning for white interests were being marginalized by the establishment, thus aiding the movement's recruitment.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=164}} Suppressing the alt-right in this manner would also set a precedent which could be repeated for other groups in future, including leftist ones.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=165}} Phillips and Yi argued that such leftist attempts to prevent alt-right speech reflected an \"authoritarian shift\" which was becoming \"increasingly hegemonic\" within the American Left and that endorsed the view that \"limiting or preventing the public speech of historically privileged groups (typically, whites, males) is acceptable until power relations are equalized.\"{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=226}}\n\n== \"Alt-left\" ==\n{{anchor|Alt-left}}\nAfter the murder of a counter-protester at the Unite the Right Rally, in a press conference Trump stated that there was \"blame on both sides\" for the violence, stating that some of the counter-protesters were part of the \"very, very violent ... alt-left\".{{refn|<ref>Shear, Michael D. and Haberman, Maggie (August 15, 2017).

It was programmed by [[Newgrounds]] founder Tom Fulp, with artwork by Newgrounds staff member Jeff \"JohnnyUtah\" Bandelin, and music by animator Chris O'Neill. The game was designed in the style of 16-bit graphics, much like similar games based on the films ''[[Tremors (film)|Tremors]]'' and ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]'' for Newgrounds' own 2010 and 2012 [[April Fools' Day|April Fools]] jokes.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''The Room Tribute'' is a [[graphic adventure game]] with a [[point and click]] interface. The player assumes the role of Johnny, a banker in San Francisco, as he goes about his daily life \u2014 showering, going to work and pleasing his future wife Lisa. The game is divided up into several levels, each of which takes the form of a new day. Each level begins with Johnny being required to bathe and ends with him going to bed; in between, Johnny is tasked with various missions, which usually involve him engaging in mundane activities such as meeting friends for coffee, buying new clothes and playing catch. When not on a mission, the player is given free roam over a small area of San Francisco, which includes a park, several stores and the homes of Johnny's friends Mark and Denny. There are several [[side quest]]s that the player can engage in when not on missions, such as reading Denny's daily diary entries or finding ten hidden spoons, which unlocks an extended ending to the game.\n\n==Plot==\nFor the most part, the game follows the plot of the movie: amiable banker Johnny helps his friends with their day-to-day problems while preparing for his wedding to his future wife, Lisa. When he discovers that Lisa is cheating on him with his best friend Mark, Johnny is outraged and ultimately kills himself. The game diverges from the film by only showing the events from Johnny's point of view. The player controls Johnny as he engages in activities that were only referred to in the film, such as his taking on a mystery client at his bank and his turning over drug dealer Chris-R to the police. The game also contains several in-jokes that attempt to provide backstories and account for idiosyncrasies in the film and its story. For example, a scene in the game's final level attempts to explain the inexplicable disappearance of supporting character Peter from the final act by revealing that an escaped Chris-R, in an act of revenge for his arrest, stole Johnny's car during the party and killed Peter in a [[hit and run]].\n\nThe game begins with a prologue, showing Lisa and Denny at Johnny's grave (a statue of Tommy Wiseau) and then segueing into a level that occurs a day before the main action of the movie begins, in which Johnny learns that an earthquake has sealed San Francisco off from the rest of the state. The final level of the game permits players to \"tie up\" loose plot threads left hanging at the end of the film, such as the fate of Chris-R and Johnny's contentious relationship with his superiors at the bank. The game also includes an epilogue revealing that Johnny was, in fact, an alien being inhabiting a human body; after Johnny's \"suicide\", he returns to his [[mother ship]], a giant mechanical spoon orbiting the Earth, and laments how he and his fellow extraterrestrials may never understand human life. Johnny and two of his fellow aliens then assume forms resembling a naked Tommy Wiseau and begin dancing, ending the game.\n\nShould the player collect each of the hidden spoons throughout the game, rather than simply dance during the climax the aliens fire a ray gun at Earth that reshapes the planet into a giant spoon.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the flash game \"as addictive as scotchka!\".<ref>{{cite web|title='The Room: The Game': Good Idea|url=https://ew.com/article/2010/09/06/the-room-video-game/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last1=Ward|first1=Kate|accessdate=September 8, 2010|date=September 6, 2010}}</ref> The game has also received positive reviews from [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'']],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/09/08/the-room-game-will-tear-you-apart-lisa/|title=The Room Game Will Tear You Apart, Lisa!|last1=Jones|first1=Nate|date=September 9, 2010|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|accessdate=December 15, 2010}}</ref> [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/09/the-room-newgrounds/|last1=Mastrapa|first1=Gus|title=Cult Flick The Room Inspires Point-and-Click Adventure|date=September 7, 2010|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=December 15, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Destructoid]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.destructoid.com/oh-hai-the-room-tribute-you-are-my-favorite-flash-game--183329.phtml|title=Oh hai The Room tribute!

It was programmed by [[Newgrounds]] founder Tom Fulp, with artwork by Newgrounds staff member Jeff \"JohnnyUtah\" Bandelin, and music by animator Chris O'Neill. The game was designed in the style of 16-bit graphics, much like similar games based on the films ''[[Tremors (film)|Tremors]]'' and ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]'' for Newgrounds' own 2010 and 2012 [[April Fools' Day|April Fools]] jokes.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''The Room Tribute'' is a [[graphic adventure game]] with a [[point and click]] interface. The player assumes the role of Johnny, a banker in San Francisco, as he goes about his daily life \u2014 showering, going to work and pleasing his future wife Lisa. The game is divided up into several levels, each of which takes the form of a new day. Each level begins with Johnny being required to bathe and ends with him going to bed; in between, Johnny is tasked with various missions, which usually involve him engaging in mundane activities such as meeting friends for coffee, buying new clothes and playing catch. When not on a mission, the player is given free roam over a small area of San Francisco, which includes a park, several stores and the homes of Johnny's friends Mark and Denny. There are several [[side quest]]s that the player can engage in when not on missions, such as reading Denny's daily diary entries or finding ten hidden spoons, which unlocks an extended ending to the game.\n\n==Plot==\nFor the most part, the game follows the plot of the movie: amiable banker Johnny helps his friends with their day-to-day problems while preparing for his wedding to his future wife, Lisa. When he discovers that Lisa is cheating on him with his best friend Mark, Johnny is outraged and ultimately kills himself. The game diverges from the film by only showing the events from Johnny's point of view. The player controls Johnny as he engages in activities that were only referred to in the film, such as his taking on a mystery client at his bank and his turning over drug dealer Chris-R to the police. The game also contains several in-jokes that attempt to provide backstories and account for idiosyncrasies in the film and its story. For example, a scene in the game's final level attempts to explain the inexplicable disappearance of supporting character Peter from the final act by revealing that an escaped Chris-R, in an act of revenge for his arrest, stole Johnny's car during the party and killed Peter in a [[hit and run]].\n\nThe game begins with a prologue, showing Lisa and Denny at Johnny's grave (a statue of Tommy Wiseau) and then segueing into a level that occurs a day before the main action of the movie begins, in which Johnny learns that an earthquake has sealed San Francisco off from the rest of the state. The final level of the game permits players to \"tie up\" loose plot threads left hanging at the end of the film, such as the fate of Chris-R and Johnny's contentious relationship with his superiors at the bank. The game also includes an epilogue revealing that Johnny was, in fact, an alien being inhabiting a human body; after Johnny's \"suicide\", he returns to his [[mother ship]], a giant mechanical spoon orbiting the Earth, and laments how he and his fellow extraterrestrials may never understand human life. Johnny and two of his fellow aliens then assume forms resembling a naked Tommy Wiseau and begin dancing, ending the game.\n\nShould the player collect each of the hidden spoons throughout the game, rather than simply dance during the climax the aliens fire a ray gun at Earth that reshapes the planet into a giant spoon.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the flash game \"as addictive as scotchka!\".<ref>{{cite web|title='The Room: The Game': Good Idea|url=https://ew.com/article/2010/09/06/the-room-video-game/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last1=Ward|first1=Kate|accessdate=September 8, 2010|date=September 6, 2010}}</ref> The game has also received positive reviews from [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'']],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/09/08/the-room-game-will-tear-you-apart-lisa/|title=The Room Game Will Tear You Apart, Lisa!|last1=Jones|first1=Nate|date=September 9, 2010|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|accessdate=December 15, 2010}}</ref> [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/09/the-room-newgrounds/|last1=Mastrapa|first1=Gus|title=Cult Flick The Room Inspires Point-and-Click Adventure|date=September 7, 2010|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=December 15, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Destructoid]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.destructoid.com/oh-hai-the-room-tribute-you-are-my-favorite-flash-game--183329.phtml|title=Oh hai The Room tribute!

This frees up the space for additional developments in Seletar.\n\nToday only [[Singapore Combat Engineers#Headquarters Army Combat Engineers Group (HQ ARMCEG)|HQ Army Combat Engineers Group]] (HQ ARMCEG) stands at the other side of the camp.\n\n==References==\n<References/>\n\n{{coord missing|Singapore}}\n\n[[Category:Singapore Army]]\n[[Category:Military installations of Singapore]]\n[[Category:Military installations established in 1928]]\n[[Category:1928 establishments in Singapore]]\n[[Category:World War II prisoner of war camps in Singapore]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "it's \u2192 its", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seletar_Camp"}
