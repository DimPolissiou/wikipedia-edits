A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he is most notable for his long service as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]].\n\nA native of [[Chicago]], Yates graduated from [[Lake View High School (Chicago)|Lake View High School]] in 1928.  He received bachelor's (1931) and law (1933) degrees from the [[University of Chicago]], was admitted to the bar, and practiced law in Chicago.  In addition to working as an attorney, in the 1930s Yates also played semiprofessional basketball.  He gained his initial experience in government as an attorney for the state bank receiver (1935-1937), and an assistant state attorney general specializing in [[Railway electric traction|traction railroads]] for the Illinois Commerce Commission (1937-1940).  During [[World War II]], Yates served in the [[United States Navy]] for two years (1944-1946) as an attorney based in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nIn 1948, Yates was elected to Congress, and he served from 1949 to 1963.  After an unsuccessful run against [[Everett Dirksen]] for the United States Senate in [[1962 United States Senate election in Illinois|1962]], in 1964 Yates was again elected to Congress.  he served from 1965 to 1999, and did not run for reelection in 1998.  He was a longtime member of the House [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]], where he became known for staunch U.S. support of [[Israel]], and federal funding for parks, historical conservation, and the arts.  Yates was also an advocate for several liberal causes, including opposition to discrimination based on age.  At the time he concluded his service, he was the oldest person to ever serve in the House (age 89), and one of the longest-tenured members in the history of Congress (total House service of 48 years).\n\nYates died in Washington in 2000.

In addition to working as an attorney, in the 1930s Yates also played semiprofessional basketball.  He gained his initial experience in government as an attorney for the state bank receiver (1935-1937), and an assistant state attorney general specializing in [[Railway electric traction|traction railroads]] for the Illinois Commerce Commission (1937-1940).  During [[World War II]], Yates served in the [[United States Navy]] for two years (1944-1946) as an attorney based in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nIn 1948, Yates was elected to Congress, and he served from 1949 to 1963.
