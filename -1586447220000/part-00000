Micromobility devices include [[Bicycle|bicycles]], [[Ebike]]s, [[Motorized_scooter#Electric|electric scooters]], [[Electric skateboard|electric skateboards]], [[Bicycle-sharing system|shared bicycles]], and electric pedal assisted ([[pedelec]]) bicycles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ITDP_The-Electric-Assist_-Leveraging-E-bikes-and-E-scooters-for-More-Livable-Cities.pdf|title=The Electric Assist: Leveraging E-bikes and E-scooters for More Livable Cities|last=Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|first=|date=2019|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\nInitial definitions set the primary condition for inclusion in the category of micromobility to be a [[Gross vehicle weight rating|gross vehicle weight]] of less than {{convert|500|kg}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dediu |first1=Horace |title=The Micromobility Definition |url=https://micromobility.io/blog/2019/2/23/the-micromobility-definition |website=micromobility.io |accessdate=23 October 2019}}</ref>. However, the definition has evolved to exclude devices with [[Internal combustion engine|internal combustion engines]] and those with top speeds above {{convert|45|km}}/h.\n\nThe term evokes a transition similar to that of [[Microcomputer|microcomputing]] where the miniaturization of transport modes for short journeys parallels the miniaturization of microcomputers for personal use. The term was coined by business and technology analyst [[Horace Dediu]], in a speech he delivered in 2017 at the Micromobility Summit in the Techfestival event in Copenhagen<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techfestival.co/event/micromobility-summit/|title=Micromobility Summit}}</ref>.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n[[File:Kaposv\u00e1ri Tekerg\u0151 2.JPG|thumb|right|A dock of shared bicycles and an electric scooter]]\n\nMicromobility devices can be human-powered or electric, and can be privately-owned or available through a [[Bicycle-sharing system|shared fleet]]. Most micromobility devices are considered to be low-speed (top speed of {{convert|25|km}}/h), but devices can have speeds up to {{convert|45km}}/h and still be considered micromobility. Some speed pedelec and electric kick scooter models fall into this moderate speed subcategory.\n\nAny vehicle with an internal combustion engine cannot be defined as micromobility. Devices with top speeds above 45km/h can also not be defined as micromobility.\n\n== The rise of micromobility ==\nOriginal forms of micromobility, like bicycles and skateboards, have been around for centuries, however their use as a utilitarian [[Utility cycling|urban transport]] mode (as opposed to for recreation or sport) has been relatively low in comparison to trips made by private vehicles outside of a handful of cities in China, [[Cycling in the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], and [[Cycling in Denmark|Denmark]].\n\nWhile micromobility vehicles have long been available for users to purchase, it was the [[Servitization of products business model|servitization]] of these modes of transportation--enabling users to use the nearest micromobility vehicle without having to purchase or store it, and facilitating the flexibility of one-way trips--that led to unprecedented growth<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/11/lime-bird-spin-why-scooter-start-ups-are-suddenly-worth-billions.html|title=Lime, Bird, Spin: Why scooter start-ups are suddenly worth billions|date=2018-07-13}}</ref> in areas where it was available. The rise of the sharing economy resulted in a massive increase in access to micromobility in many cities, first with the introduction of public bikeshare systems, and then with privately funded and operated [[Bicycle-sharing system#Dockless%20bikes|dockless]] bikeshare and electric kick scooter (e-scooter) fleets. \u00a0Most early bikeshare services specified locations, or [[Bicycle-sharing system|docks]], where vehicles needed to be picked up and left. \n\nThe fourth generation of [[Bicycle-sharing system#Dockless%20bikes|bicycle sharing services]] employed a [[Bicycle-sharing system#Dockless%20bikes|dockless]] model which allows users to end their trip and leave the shared micromobility device anywhere or within a [[Geo-fence|geo-fenced]] area. Dockless bikeshare first took off in Chinese megacities<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/5218323/china-bicycles-sharing-economy/|title=China's Bike-Sharing Fever Has Reached Saturation Point}}</ref>, and although it began with traditional, non-electric bicycles, it served as the template for what would be possible with electric-poweredally-powered and motorized bicycles, scooters, and other form factors. The availability of relatively inexpensive batteries, displays and GPS receivers, enabled by the smartphone supply chains, provided easily accessible components to facilitate for dockless services worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Belton|first1=Padraig|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44066083|title=How cheap dockless hire bikes are flooding the world|date=2018-05-15|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> Outside of Chinese cities, non-electric dockless bikeshare has largely disappeared, with many companies pivoting from bicycles to electric kick scooters in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bicycling.com/news/a26623484/lime-bikes-scooters/|title=Why Are Bike Share Companies Pivoting to E-Scooters?|last=Vuocolo|first=Alex|date=2019-03-04|website=Bicycling|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nShared electric kick scooters are considered to have one of the most rapid adoption rates in transport, nearly 4% in one year.

However, the definition has evolved to exclude devices with [[Internal combustion engine|internal combustion engines]] and those with top speeds above {{convert|45|km}}/h.\n\nThe term evokes a transition similar to that of [[Microcomputer|microcomputing]] where the miniaturization of transport modes for short journeys parallels the miniaturization of microcomputers for personal use. The term was coined by business and technology analyst [[Horace Dediu]], in a speech he delivered in 2017 at the Micromobility Summit in the Techfestival event in Copenhagen<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techfestival.co/event/micromobility-summit/|title=Micromobility Summit}}</ref>.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n[[File:Kaposv\u00e1ri Tekerg\u0151 2.JPG|thumb|right|A dock of shared bicycles and an electric scooter]]\n\nMicromobility devices can be human-powered or electric, and can be privately-owned or available through a [[Bicycle-sharing system|shared fleet]]. Most micromobility devices are considered to be low-speed (top speed of {{convert|25|km}}/h), but devices can have speeds up to {{convert|45km]]/h and still be considered micromobility. Some speed pedelec and electric kick scooter models fall into this moderate speed subcategory.\n\nAny vehicle with an internal combustion engine cannot be defined as micromobility. Devices with top speeds above 45km/h can also not be defined as micromobility.\n\n== The rise of micromobility ==\nOriginal forms of micromobility, like bicycles and skateboards, have been around for centuries, however their use as a utilitarian [[Utility cycling|urban transport]] mode (as opposed to for recreation or sport) has been relatively low in comparison to trips made by private vehicles outside of a handful of cities in China, [[Cycling in the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], and [[Cycling in Denmark|Denmark]].\n\nWhile micromobility vehicles have long been available for users to purchase, it was the [[Servitization of products business model|servitization]] of these modes of transportation--enabling users to use the nearest micromobility vehicle without having to purchase or store it, and facilitating the flexibility of one-way trips--that led to unprecedented growth<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/11/lime-bird-spin-why-scooter-start-ups-are-suddenly-worth-billions.html|title=Lime, Bird, Spin: Why scooter start-ups are suddenly worth billions|date=2018-07-13}}</ref> in areas where it was available. The rise of the sharing economy resulted in a massive increase in access to micromobility in many cities, first with the introduction of public bikeshare systems, and then with privately funded and operated [[Bicycle-sharing system#Dockless%20bikes|dockless]] bikeshare and electric kick scooter (e-scooter) fleets. \u00a0Most early bikeshare services specified locations, or [[Bicycle-sharing system|docks]], where vehicles needed to be picked up and left. \n\nThe fourth generation of [[Bicycle-sharing system#Dockless%20bikes|bicycle sharing services]] employed a [[Bicycle-sharing system#Dockless%20bikes|dockless]] model which allows users to end their trip and leave the shared micromobility device anywhere or within a [[Geo-fence|geo-fenced]] area. Dockless bikeshare first took off in Chinese megacities<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/5218323/china-bicycles-sharing-economy/|title=China's Bike-Sharing Fever Has Reached Saturation Point}}</ref>, and although it began with traditional, non-electric bicycles, it served as the template for what would be possible with electric-poweredally-powered and motorized bicycles, scooters, and other form factors. The availability of relatively inexpensive batteries, displays and GPS receivers, enabled by the smartphone supply chains, provided easily accessible components to facilitate for dockless services worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Belton|first1=Padraig|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44066083|title=How cheap dockless hire bikes are flooding the world|date=2018-05-15|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> Outside of Chinese cities, non-electric dockless bikeshare has largely disappeared, with many companies pivoting from bicycles to electric kick scooters in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bicycling.com/news/a26623484/lime-bikes-scooters/|title=Why Are Bike Share Companies Pivoting to E-Scooters?|last=Vuocolo|first=Alex|date=2019-03-04|website=Bicycling|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nShared electric kick scooters are considered to have one of the most rapid adoption rates in transport, nearly 4% in one year.
