After going through Isaac's display of pictures, Michael takes an interest on one particular picture of a woman. We come to know that the name of the girl in the picture is Christina. Michael takes an interest to get the backstory on Christina.\n\nMichael's intern Andy, sets up meeting with Mae, who is daughter of Christina. We come to know from Mae that Christina did recently due to cancer.\n\nIsaac and Christina, in flashback, are shown very much in love. But her mother dislikes Isaac. Back in present day, Mae meets Louis who used to be Christina's significant other. We realize that Mae always felt abandoned due to distant relationship with her mother.\n\nMichael accidentally meets Mae at French movie screening and they show attraction for one another. They both flirt and go on their first date to know each other more and end with their first kiss.\n\nFlashback, Christina gets ready to go to New Orleans on a double date with Isaac. It doesn't go well with her mother due to her dislike for Isaac. Christina leaves her mother and home and drives away with Isaac and friends. Isaac proposes to Christina but Christina let's him know that she isn't ready yet. Isaac understands her decision. Eventually, Christina and Isaac begin to live together but Christina is bored of her life. She gets on a bus leaving for New York City. Christina gets a job as a professional photographer after living in NYC for 3 months. She calls Denise to give her the good news who tells Christina that her mother has passed away. Christina realizes that this must be the reason why her mother made her leave home. At the funeral, she meets Isaac and is shocked to know that he has gotten married in just 3 months.\n\nLater, we see a young Mae with Christina in NYC. We come to know that Mae is daughter of Isaac and when Christina met Isaac at the funeral, she was already pregnant with his baby.\n\nPresent day, Mae completes reading a letter left by her mother with instruction to give Isaac a sealed envelope. Mae meets Isaac and hands him the envelope. She also let's him know that he is her father to which he nods knowingly. He admits knowing it since the first time he saw Mae but was too afraid to hear the truth.\n\nMichael comes to meet Isaac and is surprised to see Mae there. They both go out to a jazz club and have good time. After Mae, tells him that they should meet again, Michael let's her know that he got job in London and will be leaving soon but would like to continue the relationship. Mae wants to say something but stops herself.\n\nLater we see Michael becoming more successful and one day gets a mail from Mae with invitation to Kendrick Lamar at a local venue. Mae and Michael meet each other where Mae finally tells him about her feelings. Both embrace with a kiss.\n== Cast ==\n* [[Issa Rae]] as Mae Morton\n** Dakota Paradise as Young Mae Morton\n* [[Lakeith Stanfield]] as Michael Block\n* [[Chelsea Peretti]] as Sara Rodgers\n* [[Kelvin Harrison Jr.]] as Andy Morrison\n*[[Chant\u00e9 Adams]] as Christina Eames\n* [[Jasmine Cephas Jones]] as Rachel Miller\n* [[Lil Rel Howery]] as Kyle\n* [[Teyonah Parris]] as Asia\n* [[Rob Morgan (actor)|Rob Morgan]] as Isaac Jefferson\n** [[Y'lan Noel]] as Young Issac Jefferson\n* [[Courtney B.

Influenced by [[Impressionism]] and the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] masters from a young age, he became increasingly attracted to [[Cubism]] and avant-garde movements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/feature-2005-03.html |title=Phelan, Joseph; The Salvador Dal\u00ed Show |publisher=Artcyclopedia.com |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=Dali>Dal\u00ed, Salvador.

His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Don Salvador Dal\u00ed y Cusi strongly disapproved of his son's romance with Gala, and saw his connection to the Surrealists as a bad influence on his morals.

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again. The following summer, Dal\u00ed and Gala rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at [[Port Lligat]].

The earlier exhibition included sixteen paintings of which ''The Persistence of Memory'' attracted the most attention.

Dal\u00ed continued to paint her as they both aged, producing sympathetic and adoring images of her.

Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting.

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Wokers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist group grew, Dal\u00ed soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the group.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist group.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959. He had official meetings with General Franco in June 1956, October 1968 and May 1974.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 486, 543, 553</ref> In 1968 Dal\u00ed stated that on Franco's death there should be no return to democracy and Spain should become an absolute monarchy.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 525-27</ref> In September 1975 Dal\u00ed publicly supported Franco's decision to execute three alleged Basque terrorists and repeated his support for an absolute monarchy, adding: \"Personally, I'm against freedom; I'm for the Holy Inquisition.\"  In the following days he fled to New York after his home in Port Lligat was stoned and he had received numerous death threats.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 560-62</ref> When King Juan Carlos visited the ailing Dal\u00ed in August 1981, the painter told him: \"I have always been an anarchist and a monarchist.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 587</ref>\n\nDal\u00ed espoused a mystical view of Catholicism and In his later years he claimed to be a Catholic and an agnostic.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Descharnes, Gilles N\u00e9ret|url=https://archive.org/details/salvadordali190400robe/page/166|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed, 1904-1989|publisher=Benedikt Taschen|year=1994|isbn=978-3-8228-0298-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/salvadordali190400robe/page/166 166]|quote=Dal\u00ed, dualist as ever in his approach, was now claiming to be both an agnostic and a Roman Catholic.}}</ref>  He was interested in the writings of the Jesuit priest and philosopher [[Teilhard de Chardin]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=McNeese|first=Tim|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed|publisher=Chelsea House|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7910-8837-1|location=|page=102}}</ref> and his [[Omega Point]] theory.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career. In 1941 the Director of Exhibitions and Publications at MoMA wrote: \"The fame of Salvador Dal\u00ed has been an issue of particular controversy for more than a decade...Dal\u00ed's conduct may have been undignified, but the greater part of his art is a matter of dead earnest.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 413-14</ref> When Dal\u00ed was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts|French Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1979 one of his fellow academicians stated that he hoped Dal\u00ed would now abandon his \"clowneries\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 569</ref>\n\nIn 1936, at the premiere screening of [[Joseph Cornell]]'s film ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' at Julien Levy's gallery in New York City, Dal\u00ed knocked over the projector in a rage and is said to have shouted:  \"He stole it [the film] from my subconscious!

His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Don Salvador Dal\u00ed y Cusi strongly disapproved of his son's romance with Gala, and saw his connection to the Surrealists as a bad influence on his morals.

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again. The following summer, Dal\u00ed and Gala rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at [[Port Lligat]].

Dal\u00ed continued to paint her as they both aged, producing sympathetic and adoring images of her.

Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting.

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Wokers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist group grew, Dal\u00ed soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the group.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist group.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959. He had official meetings with General Franco in June 1956, October 1968 and May 1974.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 486, 543, 553</ref> In 1968 Dal\u00ed stated that on Franco's death there should be no return to democracy and Spain should become an absolute monarchy,<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 525-27</ref> In September 1975 Dal\u00ed publicly supported Franco's decision to execute three alleged Basque terrorists and repeated his support for an absolute monarchy, adding: \"Personally, I'm against freedom; I'm for the Holy Inquisition.\"  In the following days he fled to New York after his home in Port Lligat was stoned and he had received numerous death threats.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 560-62</ref> When King Juan Carlos visited the ailing Dal\u00ed in August 1981, the painter told him: \"I have always been an anarchist and a monarchist.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 587</ref>\n\nDal\u00ed espoused a mystical view of Catholicism and In his later years he claimed to be a Catholic and an agnostic.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Descharnes, Gilles N\u00e9ret|url=https://archive.org/details/salvadordali190400robe/page/166|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed, 1904-1989|publisher=Benedikt Taschen|year=1994|isbn=978-3-8228-0298-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/salvadordali190400robe/page/166 166]|quote=Dal\u00ed, dualist as ever in his approach, was now claiming to be both an agnostic and a Roman Catholic.}}</ref>  He was interested in the writings of the Jesuit priest and philosopher [[Teilhard de Chardin]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=McNeese|first=Tim|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed|publisher=Chelsea House|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7910-8837-1|location=|page=102}}</ref> and his [[Omega Point]] theory, Dal\u00ed's painting ''[[Tuna Fishing (painting)|Tuna Fishing (Homage to Meissonier)]]'' (1967) was inspired by his reading of Chardin.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 525</ref>\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nDal\u00ed's sexuality had a profound influence on his work. He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career. In 1941 the Director of Exhibitions and Publications at MoMA wrote: \"The fame of Salvador Dal\u00ed has been an issue of particular controversy for more than a decade...Dal\u00ed's conduct may have been undignified, but the greater part of his art is a matter of dead earnest.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 413-14</ref> When Dal\u00ed was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts|French Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1979 one of his fellow academicians stated that he hoped Dal\u00ed would now abandon his \"clowneries\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 569</ref>\n\nIn 1936, at the premiere screening of [[Joseph Cornell]]'s film ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' at Julien Levy's gallery in New York City, Dal\u00ed knocked over the projector in a rage and is said to have shouted:  \"He stole it [the film] from my subconscious!
