The assassination set in motion two of the bloodiest events of the late 20th century: the [[Rwandan genocide]] and the [[First Congo War]].\n\nResponsibility for the attack is disputed, with most theories proposing as suspects either the [[Tutsi]] rebel [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) or government-aligned [[Hutu Power]] followers opposed to negotiation with the RPF. Within hours of the attack, the mass slaughter of Tutsi people began, resulting in the genocide of hundreds of thousands of Tutsi in the following three months.\n\n== Background  ==\nIn 1990, the [[Rwandan Civil War]] began when the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]], dominated by the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group, invaded northern Rwanda from [[Uganda]]. Most of the RPF fighters were either [[refugee]]s or the sons of refugees who had fled ethnic purges by the Hutu government in the middle of the century. The attempt to overthrow the government failed, though the RPF was able to maintain control of a border region.<ref>Mamdani, p. 186</ref> As it became clear that the war had reached a stalemate, the sides began peace negotiations in May 1992, which resulted in the signing in August 1993 of the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]] to create a power-sharing government.<ref>Melvern, pp. 36\u201337</ref>\n\nThe war radicalized the internal opposition. The RPF's show of force intensified support for the so-called \"[[Hutu Power]]\" ideology. Hutu Power portrayed the RPF as an alien force intent on reinstating the [[Kingdom of Rwanda|Tutsi monarchy]] and enslaving the Hutus:  a prospect which must be resisted at all costs.<ref>Mamdani, pp. 189\u2013191</ref> This ideology was embraced most wholeheartedly by the [[Coalition for the Defense of the Republic]] (CDR) who advocated racist principles known as the [[Hutu Ten Commandments]]. This political force led to the collapse of the first Habyarimana government in July 1993, when Prime Minister [[Dismas Nsengiyaremye]] criticized the president in writing for delaying a peace agreement. Habyarimana, a member of the [[Mouvement r\u00e9publicain national pour la d\u00e9mocratie et le d\u00e9veloppement|MRND]] political party, dismissed Nsengiyarmye and appointed [[Agathe Uwilingiyimana]], who was perceived to be less sympathetic to the RPF, in his stead. The main opposition parties refused to support Madame Agathe's appointment, each splitting into two factions: one calling for the unwavering defense of Hutu Power and the other, labeled \"moderate\", that sought a negotiated settlement to the war. As Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana was unable to form a coalition government, ratification of the Arusha Accords was impossible. The most extreme of the Hutu parties, the CDR, which openly called for [[ethnic cleansing]] of the Tutsi, was entirely unrepresented in the Accords.<ref>Mamdani, pp. 211\u2013212</ref>\n\n[[File:Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana (1980).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rwandan President [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] in 1980]]\n\nThe security situation deteriorated throughout 1993. Armed Hutu militias attacked Tutsis throughout the country, while high-ranking adherents of Hutu Power began to consider how the security forces might be turned to [[genocide]].<ref>Melvern, pp. 45\u201346</ref> In February 1994, [[Rom\u00e9o Dallaire]], the head of the military force attached to the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]] (UNAMIR), which had been sent to observe the implementation of the Arusha Accords, informed his superiors, \"Time does seem to be running out for political discussions, as any spark on the security side could have catastrophic consequences.\"<ref name=independent>[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/documents/RwandaReport3.htm#January%20Cable \"Report of the Independent Inquiry into the Actions of the UN during the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060416080402/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/documents/RwandaReport3.htm#January%20Cable |date=16 April 2006 }}, [[United Nations]] (hosted by ess.uwe.ac.uk).

Despite a classified February [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) analysis predicting half a million deaths if the Arusha process failed,<ref>Melvern, p. 128</ref> the U.S. was attempting to reduce its international commitments in the wake of the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Somalia debacle]] and lobbied to end the mission. A compromise extending UNAMIR's mandate for three more months was finally reached on the evening of Tuesday, the fifth of April. Meanwhile, Habyarimana was finishing regional travel. On 4 April, he had flown to [[Zaire]] to meet with president [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] and on the sixth flew to [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]] for a one-day regional summit for heads of state convened by Tanzania's President.<ref>Melvern, pp. 128\u2013131</ref> On the return trip that evening he was joined by Burundian president [[Cyprien Ntaryamira]], and a couple of his ministers, who preferred the faster [[Dassault Falcon 50]] that the French government had given to Habyarimana over Ntaryamira's own presidential plane.<ref>Melvern, p. 142</ref>\n\nAccording to interim Prime Minister [[Jean Kambanda]]'s testimony to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR), President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] of neighboring [[Zaire]] (now DRC) had warned Habyarimana not to go to Dar es Salaam on 6 April. Mobutu reportedly said this warning had come from a very senior official in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris. There was a link between this warning, said Mobutu, and the subsequent suicide in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e of [[Fran\u00e7ois de Grossouvre]], a senior high-ranking official who was working for President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] and who killed himself on 7 April after learning about the downing of the Falcon.<ref>Melvern, Linda: \"[http://www.lindamelvern.com/articles/120-expert-refutes-bruguiere-claims-that-rpf-shot-down-rwandan-presidents-aircraft-in-1994 Expert Refutes Brugui\u00e8re Claims that RPF Shot Down Rwandan President's Aircraft in 1994.]\" ''The New Times.'' 27 November 2006.</ref>\n\n== Missile attack ==\n\nShortly before 8:20&nbsp;pm local time (18:20&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), the presidential jet circled once around [[Kigali International Airport]] before coming in for [[Final approach (aviation)|final approach]] in clear skies.<ref name=Melvern133>Melvern, p. 133</ref> A weekly flight by a Belgian [[C-130 Hercules]] carrying UNAMIR troops returning from leave had been scheduled to land before the presidential jet, but was waved off to give the president priority.<ref name=Dallaire228>Dallaire & Beardsley, pp. 228</ref>\n\nA [[surface-to-air missile]] struck one of the wings of the Dassault Falcon, then a second missile hit its tail.

One of two Belgian officers in the garden of a house in [[Kicukiro District#Sectors|Kanombe]], the district in which the airport is located, saw and heard the first missile climb into the sky, saw a red flash in the sky and heard an aircraft engine stopping, followed by another missile. He immediately called Major de Saint-Quentin, part of the French team attached to the Rwandan para-commando battalion [[Commando Parachute Group|Commandos de recherche et d'action en profondeur]], who advised him to organize protection for his Belgian comrades. Similarly, another Belgian officer stationed in an unused airport [[control tower]] saw the lights of an approaching aircraft, a light traveling upward from the ground and the aircraft lights going out. This was followed by a second light rising from the same place as the first and the plane turning into a falling ball of fire. This officer immediately radioed his company commander, who confirmed with the operational control tower that the plane was the presidential aircraft.<ref>Melvern, pp. 133\u2013134</ref>\n\nA Rwandan soldier in the military camp in Kanombe recalled,\n<blockquote>You know, its engine sound was different from other planes; that is, the president's engine's sound ... We were looking towards where the plane was coming from, and we saw a projectile and we saw a ball of flame or flash and we saw the plane go down; and I saw it. I was the leader of the bloc so I asked the soldiers to get up and I told them \"Get up because Kinani ''[a [[Kinyarwanda]] nickname for Habyarimana meaning \"famous\" or \"invincible\"]'' has been shot down.' They told me, \"You are lying.\" I said, \"It's true.\" So I opened my wardrobe, I put on my uniform and I heard the bugle sound.<ref name=Melvern135>Melvern, p. 135</ref></blockquote>\n\nA Rwandan officer cadet at the airport who was listening to the [[Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des Mille Collines]] heard the announcer state that the presidential jet was coming in to land. The spoken broadcast stopped suddenly in favor of a selection of [[classical music]].<ref name=Melvern134>Melvern, p. 134</ref>\n\n=== Victims ===\nAll twelve aboard the Falcon were killed.

Presidential Guards, who had been waiting to escort the president home from the airport, threatened people with their weapons. Twenty Belgian peacekeepers who had been stationed along the perimeter of the airport were surrounded by the Presidential Guard and some were disarmed.<ref name=Melvern134/> The airport was closed and the circling Belgian Hercules was diverted to [[Nairobi]].<ref name=Dallaire228/>\n\nIn Camp Kanombe, the bugle call immediately after the crash was taken by soldiers to mean that the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] had attacked the camp. The soldiers rushed to their units' armories to equip themselves. Soldiers of the paracommando brigade [[Commando Parachute Group|Commandos de recherche et d'action en profondeur]] assembled on the parade ground at around 9:00&nbsp;pm while members of other units gathered elsewhere in the camp.<ref name=\"Melvern, pp. 135-136\">Melvern, pp. 135\u2013136</ref> At least one witness stated that about an hour after the crash there was the sound of gunfire in Kanombe. Munitions explosions at Camp Kanombe were also initially reported.<ref name=Melvern134/>\n\nThe senior officer for the Kigali operational zone called the Ministry of Defence with the news. Defence Minister [[Augustin Bizimana]] was out of the country, and the officer who took the call failed to reach Col. [[Th\u00e9oneste Bagosora]], the director of the office of the minister of defence, who was apparently at a reception given by UNAMIR's [[Bangladesh]]i officers.<ref name=Melvern134/>\n\nThe news of the crash, initially reported as an explosion of UNAMIR's ammunition dump, was quickly relayed to UNAMIR Force Commander Dallaire. He ordered UNAMIR Kigali sector commander [[Luc Marchal]] to send a patrol to the crash site.<ref name=Dallaire221>Dallaire & Beardsley, p. 221</ref> Numerous people began calling UNAMIR seeking information, including Prime Minister [[Agathe Uwilingiyimana]] and [[Lando Ndasingwa]]. Uwilingiyimana informed Dallaire that she was trying to gather her cabinet but many ministers were afraid to leave their families. She also reported that all of the hardline ministers had disappeared. Dallaire asked the prime minister if she could confirm that it was the president's plane that had crashed, and called UNAMIR political head [[Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh]] to inform him of developments. Uwilingiyimana called back to confirm that it was the president's jet and he was presumed to be on board. She also asked for UNAMIR help in regaining control of the political situation, as she was legally next in the line of succession, but some moderate ministers allied to her had already begun fleeing their homes, fearing for their safety.<ref>Dallaire & Beardsley, pp. 221\u2013222</ref>\n\nAt 9:18&nbsp;pm, Presidential Guards whom a UNAMIR report described as \"nervous and dangerous\" established a roadblock near the Hotel M\u00e9ridien. Several other roadblocks had been set up prior to the attack as part of security preparations for Habyarimana's arrival.<ref>Melvern, pp. 134\u2013135</ref> The patrol of UNAMIR Belgian soldiers sent to investigate the crash site was stopped at a Presidential Guards roadblock at 9:35&nbsp;pm, disarmed and sent to the airport.<ref name=Melvern135/>\n\nThe para-commando brigade was ordered to collect bodies from the crash site and UN peacekeepers were prevented from accessing the site.<ref name=\"Melvern\">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/10/rwanda-at-last-we-know-truth?newsfeed=true | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Linda | last=Melvern | title=Rwanda: at last we know the truth | date=10 January 2012}}</ref> Later, two French soldiers arrived at the crash and asked to be given the [[flight data recorder]] once it was recovered.<ref name=\"Melvern, pp. 135-136\"/> The whereabouts of the flight data recorder were later unknown. French military contacted Dallaire and offered to investigate the crash, which Dallaire refused immediately.<ref name=\"Melvern\"/>\n\nA Rwandan colonel who called the army command about 40 minutes after the crash was told that there was no confirmation that the president was dead. About half an hour later, roughly 9:30, the situation was still confused at army command, though it appeared clear that the presidential aircraft had exploded and that it had probably been hit by a missile. News arrived that Major-General [[D\u00e9ogratias Nsabimana]], the army chief of staff, had been on the plane. The officers present realized that they would have to appoint a new chief of staff in order to clarify the [[chain of command]] and began a meeting to decide whom to appoint. Col. Bagosora joined them soon afterward.<ref>Melvern, p. 136</ref> At about 10:00&nbsp;pm, Ephrem Rwabalinda, the government liaison officer to UNAMIR, called Dallaire to inform him that a crisis committee was about to meet. After informing his superiors in [[New York City]] of the situation, Dallaire went to attend the meeting, where he found Bagosora in charge.<ref>Dallaire & Beardsley, p. 222</ref>\n\n=== Aftermath ===\n\nAt some point following the 6 April assassination, Juvenal Habyarimana's remains were obtained by Zairian President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] and stored in a private mausoleum in [[Gbadolite]], [[Zaire]] (now [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]). Mobutu promised Habyarimana's family that his body would eventually be given a proper burial in Rwanda. On 12 May 1997, as [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]]'s [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo|ADFL]] rebels were advancing on Gbadolite, Mobutu had the remains flown by cargo plane to [[Kinshasa]] where they waited on the tarmac of [[N'djili Airport]] for three days. On 16 May, the day before Mobutu fled Zaire, Habyarimana's remains were cremated under the supervision of an Indian [[Hindu]] leader.<ref>\"[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/16/world/ending-a-chapter-mobutu-cremates-rwanda-ally.html Ending a Chapter, Mobutu Cremates Rwanda Ally] by Howard W.

The assassination set in motion two of the bloodiest events of the late 20th century: the [[Rwandan genocide]] and the [[First Congo War]].\n\nResponsibility for the attack is disputed, with most theories proposing as suspects either the [[Tutsi]] rebel [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) or government-aligned [[Hutu Power]] followers opposed to negotiation with the RPF. Within hours of the attack, the mass slaughter of Tutsi people began, resulting in the genocide of hundreds of thousands of Tutsi in the following three months.\n\n== Background  ==\nIn 1990, the [[Rwandan Civil War]] began when the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]], dominated by the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group, invaded northern Rwanda from [[Uganda]]. Most of the RPF fighters were either [[refugee]]s or the sons of refugees who had fled ethnic purges by the Hutu government in the middle of the century. The attempt to overthrow the government failed, though the RPF was able to maintain control of a border region.<ref>Mamdani, p. 186</ref> As it became clear that the war had reached a stalemate, the sides began peace negotiations in May 1992, which resulted in the signing in August 1993 of the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]] to create a power-sharing government.<ref>Melvern, pp. 36\u201337</ref>\n\nThe war radicalized the internal opposition. The RPF's show of force intensified support for the so-called \"[[Hutu Power]]\" ideology. Hutu Power portrayed the RPF as an alien force intent on reinstating the [[Kingdom of Rwanda|Tutsi monarchy]] and enslaving the Hutus:  a prospect which must be resisted at all costs.<ref>Mamdani, pp. 189\u2013191</ref> This ideology was embraced most wholeheartedly by the [[Coalition for the Defense of the Republic]] (CDR) who advocated racist principles known as the [[Hutu Ten Commandments]]. This political force led to the collapse of the first Habyarimana government in July 1993, when Prime Minister [[Dismas Nsengiyaremye]] criticized the president in writing for delaying a peace agreement. Habyarimana, a member of the [[Mouvement r\u00e9publicain national pour la d\u00e9mocratie et le d\u00e9veloppement|MRND]] political party, dismissed Nsengiyarmye and appointed [[Agathe Uwilingiyimana]], who was perceived to be less sympathetic to the RPF, in his stead. The main opposition parties refused to support Madame Agathe's appointment, each splitting into two factions: one calling for the unwavering defense of Hutu Power and the other, labeled \"moderate\", that sought a negotiated settlement to the war. As Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana was unable to form a coalition government, ratification of the Arusha Accords was impossible. The most extreme of the Hutu parties, the CDR, which openly called for [[ethnic cleansing]] of the Tutsi, was entirely unrepresented in the Accords.<ref>Mamdani, pp. 211\u2013212</ref>\n\n[[File:Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana (1980).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rwandan President [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] in 1980]]\n\nThe security situation deteriorated throughout 1993.

A compromise extending UNAMIR's mandate for three more months was finally reached on the evening of Tuesday, the fifth of April. Meanwhile, Habyarimana was finishing regional travel. On 4 April, he had flown to [[Zaire]] to meet with president [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] and on the sixth flew to [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]] for a one-day regional summit for heads of state convened by Tanzania's President.<ref>Melvern, pp. 128\u2013131</ref> On the return trip that evening he was joined by Burundian president [[Cyprien Ntaryamira]], and a couple of his ministers, who preferred the faster [[Dassault Falcon 50]] that the French government had given to Habyarimana over Ntaryamira's own presidential plane.<ref>Melvern, p. 142</ref>\n\nAccording to interim Prime Minister [[Jean Kambanda]]'s testimony to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR), President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] of neighboring [[Zaire]] (now DRC) had warned Habyarimana not to go to Dar es Salaam on 6 April. Mobutu reportedly said this warning had come from a very senior official in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris. There was a link between this warning, said Mobutu, and the subsequent suicide in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e of [[Fran\u00e7ois de Grossouvre]], a senior high-ranking official who was working for President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] and who killed himself on 7 April after learning about the downing of the Falcon.<ref>Melvern, Linda: \"[http://www.lindamelvern.com/articles/120-expert-refutes-bruguiere-claims-that-rpf-shot-down-rwandan-presidents-aircraft-in-1994 Expert Refutes Brugui\u00e8re Claims that RPF Shot Down Rwandan President's Aircraft in 1994.]\" ''The New Times.'' 27 November 2006.</ref>\n\n== Missile attack ==\n\nShortly before 8:20&nbsp;pm local time (18:20&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), the presidential jet circled once around [[Kigali International Airport]] before coming in for [[Final approach (aviation)|final approach]] in clear skies.<ref name=Melvern133>Melvern, p. 133</ref> A weekly flight by a Belgian [[C-130 Hercules]] carrying UNAMIR troops returning from leave had been scheduled to land before the presidential jet, but was waved off to give the president priority.<ref name=Dallaire228>Dallaire & Beardsley, pp. 228</ref>\n\nA [[surface-to-air missile]] struck one of the wings of the Dassault Falcon, then a second missile hit its tail.

One of two Belgian officers in the garden of a house in [[Kicukiro District#Sectors|Kanombe]], the district in which the airport is located, saw and heard the first missile climb into the sky, saw a red flash in the sky and heard an aircraft engine stopping, followed by another missile. He immediately called Major de Saint-Quentin, part of the French team attached to the Rwandan para-commando battalion [[Commando Parachute Group|Commandos de recherche et d'action en profondeur]], who advised him to organize protection for his Belgian comrades. Similarly, another Belgian officer stationed in an unused airport [[control tower]] saw the lights of an approaching aircraft, a light traveling upward from the ground and the aircraft lights going out. This was followed by a second light rising from the same place as the first and the plane turning into a falling ball of fire. This officer immediately radioed his company commander, who confirmed with the operational control tower that the plane was the presidential aircraft.<ref>Melvern, pp. 133\u2013134</ref>\n\nA Rwandan soldier in the military camp in Kanombe recalled,\n<blockquote>You know, its engine sound was different from other planes; that is, the president's engine's sound ... We were looking towards where the plane was coming from, and we saw a projectile and we saw a ball of flame or flash and we saw the plane go down; and I saw it. I was the leader of the bloc so I asked the soldiers to get up and I told them \"Get up because Kinani ''[a [[Kinyarwanda]] nickname for Habyarimana meaning \"famous\" or \"invincible\"]'' has been shot down.' They told me, \"You are lying.\" I said, \"It's true.\" So I opened my wardrobe, I put on my uniform and I heard the bugle sound.<ref name=Melvern135>Melvern, p. 135</ref></blockquote>\n\nA Rwandan officer cadet at the airport who was listening to the [[Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des Mille Collines]] heard the announcer state that the presidential jet was coming in to land.

Presidential Guards, who had been waiting to escort the president home from the airport, threatened people with their weapons. Twenty Belgian peacekeepers who had been stationed along the perimeter of the airport were surrounded by the Presidential Guard and some were disarmed.<ref name=Melvern134/> The airport was closed and the circling Belgian Hercules was diverted to [[Nairobi]].<ref name=Dallaire228/>\n\nIn Camp Kanombe, the bugle call immediately after the crash was taken by soldiers to mean that the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] had attacked the camp. The soldiers rushed to their units' armories to equip themselves. Soldiers of the paracommando brigade [[Commando Parachute Group|Commandos de recherche et d'action en profondeur]] assembled on the parade ground at around 9:00&nbsp;pm while members of other units gathered elsewhere in the camp.<ref name=\"Melvern, pp. 135-136\">Melvern, pp. 135\u2013136</ref> At least one witness stated that about an hour after the crash there was the sound of gunfire in Kanombe. Munitions explosions at Camp Kanombe were also initially reported.<ref name=Melvern134/>\n\nThe senior officer for the Kigali operational zone called the Ministry of Defence with the news. Defence Minister [[Augustin Bizimana]] was out of the country, and the officer who took the call failed to reach Col. [[Th\u00e9oneste Bagosora]], the director of the office of the minister of defence, who was apparently at a reception given by UNAMIR's [[Bangladesh]]i officers.<ref name=Melvern134/>\n\nThe news of the crash, initially reported as an explosion of UNAMIR's ammunition dump, was quickly relayed to UNAMIR Force Commander Dallaire. He ordered UNAMIR Kigali sector commander [[Luc Marchal]] to send a patrol to the crash site.<ref name=Dallaire221>Dallaire & Beardsley, p. 221</ref> Numerous people began calling UNAMIR seeking information, including Prime Minister [[Agathe Uwilingiyimana]] and [[Lando Ndasingwa]]. Uwilingiyimana informed Dallaire that she was trying to gather her cabinet but many ministers were afraid to leave their families. She also reported that all of the hardline ministers had disappeared. Dallaire asked the prime minister if she could confirm that it was the president's plane that had crashed, and called UNAMIR political head [[Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh]] to inform him of developments. Uwilingiyimana called back to confirm that it was the president's jet and he was presumed to be on board. She also asked for UNAMIR help in regaining control of the political situation, as she was legally next in the line of succession, but some moderate ministers allied to her had already begun fleeing their homes, fearing for their safety.<ref>Dallaire & Beardsley, pp. 221\u2013222</ref>\n\nAt 9:18&nbsp;pm, Presidential Guards whom a UNAMIR report described as \"nervous and dangerous\" established a roadblock near the Hotel M\u00e9ridien. Several other roadblocks had been set up prior to the attack as part of security preparations for Habyarimana's arrival.<ref>Melvern, pp. 134\u2013135</ref> The patrol of UNAMIR Belgian soldiers sent to investigate the crash site was stopped at a Presidential Guards roadblock at 9:35&nbsp;pm, disarmed and sent to the airport.<ref name=Melvern135/>\n\nThe para-commando brigade was ordered to collect bodies from the crash site and UN peacekeepers were prevented from accessing the site.<ref name=\"Melvern\">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/10/rwanda-at-last-we-know-truth?newsfeed=true | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Linda | last=Melvern | title=Rwanda: at last we know the truth | date=10 January 2012}}</ref> Later, two French soldiers arrived at the crash and asked to be given the [[flight data recorder]] once it was recovered.<ref name=\"Melvern, pp. 135-136\"/> The whereabouts of the flight data recorder were later unknown. French military contacted Dallaire and offered to investigate the crash, which Dallaire refused immediately.<ref name=\"Melvern\"/>\n\nA Rwandan colonel who called the army command about 40 minutes after the crash was told that there was no confirmation that the president was dead. About half an hour later, roughly 9:30, the situation was still confused at army command, though it appeared clear that the presidential aircraft had exploded and that it had probably been hit by a missile. News arrived that Major-General [[D\u00e9ogratias Nsabimana]], the army chief of staff, had been on the plane. The officers present realized that they would have to appoint a new chief of staff in order to clarify the [[chain of command]] and began a meeting to decide whom to appoint. Col. Bagosora joined them soon afterward.<ref>Melvern, p. 136</ref> At about 10:00&nbsp;pm, Ephrem Rwabalinda, the government liaison officer to UNAMIR, called Dallaire to inform him that a crisis committee was about to meet. After informing his superiors in [[New York City]] of the situation, Dallaire went to attend the meeting, where he found Bagosora in charge.<ref>Dallaire & Beardsley, p. 222</ref>\n\n=== Aftermath ===\n\nAt some point following the 6 April assassination, Juvenal Habyarimana's remains were obtained by Zairian President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] and stored in a private mausoleum in [[Gbadolite]], [[Zaire]] (now [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]). Mobutu promised Habyarimana's family that his body would eventually be given a proper burial in Rwanda. On 12 May 1997, as [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]]'s [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo|ADFL]] rebels were advancing on Gbadolite, Mobutu had the remains flown by cargo plane to [[Kinshasa]] where they waited on the tarmac of [[N'djili Airport]] for three days. On 16 May, the day before Mobutu fled Zaire, Habyarimana's remains were cremated under the supervision of an Indian [[Hindu]] leader.<ref>\"[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/16/world/ending-a-chapter-mobutu-cremates-rwanda-ally.html Ending a Chapter, Mobutu Cremates Rwanda Ally] by Howard W.

All such evidence is heavily disputed and many academics, as well as the [[United Nations]], have refrained from issuing a definitive finding.

{"title_page": "Vowel harmony", "text_new": "{{Short description|Sound change in vowels}}{{For|the poetic device|Vowel harmony (poetry)}}\n{{more footnotes|date=June 2009}}\n\n{{Sound change}}\n\nIn [[phonology]]''', vowel harmony''' is an [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilatory]] process in which the vowels of a word have to be members of the same class (thus \"in harmony\"). In languages with vowel harmony, there are constraints on which vowels may be found near each other. Vowel harmony is found in many [[Agglutination|agglutinative]] languages. [[Suffix|Suffixes]] and [[Prefix|prefixes]] will usually follow vowel harmony rules.\n\n==Terminology==\n{{See also|Germanic umlaut|I-mutation|Metaphony}}\nThe term ''vowel harmony'' is used in two different senses.\n\nIn the first sense, it refers to any type of long distance assimilatory process of vowels, either ''progressive'' or ''regressive''. When used in this sense, the term ''vowel harmony'' is synonymous with the term ''[[metaphony]]''.\n\nIn the second sense, ''vowel harmony'' refers only to ''progressive'' vowel harmony (beginning-to-end). For ''regressive'' harmony, the term ''umlaut'' is used. In this sense, ''metaphony'' is the general term while ''vowel harmony'' and ''umlaut'' are both sub-types of metaphony. The term ''umlaut'' is also used in a different sense to refer to a type of [[vowel gradation]]. This article will use \"vowel harmony\" for both progressive and regressive harmony.\n\n==\"Long-distance\"==\n\nHarmony processes are \"long-distance\" in the sense that the assimilation involves sounds that are separated by intervening [[segment (linguistics)|segment]]s (usually consonant segments). In other words, ''harmony'' refers to the assimilation of sounds that are ''not'' adjacent to each other. For example, a vowel at the beginning of a word can trigger assimilation in a vowel at the end of a word. The assimilation occurs across the entire word in many languages. This is represented schematically in the following diagram:\n\n:{| cellspacing=\"5\" style=\"font-size: 110%;\"\n! <span style=\"line-height: 1.2em;\">before<br>assimilation</span>\n| &nbsp;\n! <span style=\"line-height: 1.2em;\">after<br>assimilation</span>\n|\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:#800000\">'''V<sub>a</sub>'''</span>C<span style=\"color:#008000\">''V<sub>b</sub>''</span>C<span style=\"color:#008000\">''V<sub>b</sub>''</span>C\n| '''\u2192'''\n| <span style=\"color:#800000\">'''V<sub>a</sub>'''</span>C<span style=\"color:#800000\">''V<sub>a</sub>''</span>C<span style=\"color:#800000\">''V<sub>a</sub>''</span>C\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(<span style=\"color:#800000\">V<sub>a</sub></span> = type-a vowel, <span style=\"color:#008000\">V<sub>b</sub></span> = type-b vowel, C = consonant)</small>\n|}\n\nIn the diagram above, the <span style=\"color:#800000\">V<sub>a</sub></span> (type-a vowel) causes the following <span style=\"color:#008000\">V<sub>b</sub></span> (type-b vowel) to assimilate and become the same type of vowel (and thus they become, metaphorically, \"in harmony\").\n\nThe vowel that causes the vowel assimilation is frequently termed the ''trigger'' while the vowels that assimilate (or ''harmonize'') are termed ''targets''. When the vowel triggers lie within the [[root (linguistics)|root]] or [[word stem|stem]] of a word and the [[affix]]es contain the targets, this is called ''stem-controlled'' vowel harmony (the opposite situation is called ''dominant'').<ref name=\"van der Hulst1995\">van der Hulst, H., & van de Weijer, J.

Some languages have more than one system of harmony. For instance, [[Altaic languages]] are proposed to have a rounding harmony superimposed over a backness harmony.\n\nEven among languages with vowel harmony, not all vowels need to participate in the vowel conversions; these vowels are termed ''neutral''. Neutral vowels may be ''opaque'' and block harmonic processes or they may be ''transparent'' and not affect them.<ref name=\"van der Hulst1995\" /> Intervening consonants are also often transparent.\n\nFinally, languages that do have vowel harmony often allow for lexical ''disharmony'', or words with mixed sets of vowels even when an opaque neutral vowel is not involved. Van der Hulst & van de Weijer (1995) point to two such situations: polysyllabic trigger morphemes may contain non-neutral vowels from opposite harmonic sets and certain target morphemes simply fail to harmonize.<ref name=\"van der Hulst1995\" /> Many [[loanword]]s exhibit disharmony. For example, Turkish {{lang|tr|vakit}}, ('time' [from Arabic {{transl|ar|waqt}}]); *{{lang|tr|vak'''\u0131'''t}} would have been expected.\n\n==Languages with vowel harmony==\n\n===Korean===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px;\"\n|+ Korean Vowel Harmony\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Positive/\"light\" (Yang {{lang|ko-Hani|\u967d}})/Plus Vowels\n{{lang|ko|\uc591\uc131\ubaa8\uc74c}} (Yangseong moeum)\n| {{lang|ko|\u314f}} ({{transl|ko|a}}, {{IPA-ko|a|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u3151}} ({{transl|ko|ya}}, {{IPA-ko|ja|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u3157}} ({{transl|ko|o}}, {{IPA-ko|o|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u3158}} ({{transl|ko|wa}}, {{IPA-ko|wa|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u315b}} ({{transl|ko|yo}}, {{IPA-ko|jo|}}) || ({{lang|ko|\u318d}} {{IPA-ko|\u028c|}})\n|-\n| {{lang|ko|\u3150}} ({{transl|ko|ae}}, {{IPA-ko|\u025b|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u3152}} ({{transl|ko|yae}}, {{IPA-ko|j\u025b|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u315a}} ({{transl|ko|oe}}, {{IPA-ko|\u00f8|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u3159}} ({{transl|ko|wae}}, {{IPA-ko|w\u025b|}}) || ({{lang|ko|\u3189}} {{IPA-ko|joj|}}) || ({{lang|ko|\u318e}} {{IPA-ko|\u028cj|}})\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Negative/\"dark\" (Eum {{lang|ko-Hani|\u9670}})/Minus Vowels\n{{lang|ko|\uc74c\uc131\ubaa8\uc74c}} (eumseong moeum)\n| {{lang|ko|\u3153}} ({{transl|ko|eo}}, {{IPA-ko|\u028c,\u0259|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u3155}} ({{transl|ko|yeo}}, {{IPA-ko|j\u028c,j\u0259|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u315c}} ({{transl|ko|u}}, {{IPA-ko|u|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u315d}} ({{transl|ko|wo}}, {{IPA-ko|w\u028c,w\u0259|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u3160}} ({{transl|ko|yu}}, {{IPA-ko|ju|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u3161}} ({{transl|ko|eu}}, {{IPA-ko|\u026f|}})\n|-\n| {{lang|ko|\u3154}} ({{transl|ko|e}}, {{IPA-ko|e|}})) || {{lang|ko|\u3156}} ({{transl|ko|ye}}, {{IPA-ko|je|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u315f}} ({{transl|ko|wi}}, {{IPA-ko|y|}}, {{IPA-ko|wi|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u315e}} ({{transl|ko|we}}, {{IPA-ko|we|}}) || ({{lang|ko|\u318c}} {{IPA-ko|juj|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u3162}} ({{transl|ko|ui}}, {{IPA-ko|\u0270i|}})\n|-\n! |Neutral (Jung {{lang|ko-Hani|\u4e2d}})/Centre Vowels\n{{lang|ko|\uc911\uc131\ubaa8\uc74c}} (jungseong moeum)\n| colspan=\"6\" | {{lang|ko|\u3163}} ({{transl|ko|i}}, {{IPA-ko|i|}})\n|}\n\nThere are three classes of vowels in [[Korean language|Korean]]: positive, negative, and neutral. These categories loosely follow the front (positive) and mid (negative) vowels. Traditionally, Korean had strong vowel harmony; however, this rule is no longer observed strictly in modern Korean. In modern Korean, it is only applied in certain cases such as [[onomatopoeia]], [[adjectives]], [[adverbs]], [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]], and [[interjection]]s. The vowel {{lang|ko|\u3161}} ({{transl|ko|eu}}) is considered a partially neutral and a partially negative vowel. There are other traces of vowel harmony in modern Korean: many native Korean words tend to follow vowel harmony such as {{lang|ko|\uc0ac\ub78c}} ({{transl|ko|saram}}, 'person'), and {{lang|ko|\ubd80\uc5cc}} ({{transl|ko|bu-eok}}, 'kitchen').\n\n===Mongolian===\n{| align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em\"\n|-\n! -RTR\n| \u044d[{{IPA|e}}] || \u04af[{{IPA|u}}] || \u04e9[{{IPA|o}}] || \u0438[{{IPA|i}}]\n|-\n! +RTR\n| \u0430[{{IPA|a}}] || \u0443[{{IPA|\u028a}}] || \u043e[{{IPA|\u0254}}]\n|-\n|}\n\n[[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] exhibits both a [[Advanced and retracted tongue root|tongue root harmony]] and a rounding harmony. In particular, the tongue root harmony involves the vowels: {{IPA|/a, \u028a, \u0254/}} (+RTR) and {{IPA|/i, u, e, o/}} (-RTR). The vowel {{IPA|/i/}} is phonetically similar to the -RTR vowels, however, it is largely transparent to vowel harmony. Rounding harmony only affects the open vowels, {{IPA|/e, o, a, \u0254/}}. Some sources refer to the primary harmonization dimension as pharyngealization or patalalness (among others), but neither of these is technically correct. Likewise, referring to \u00b1RTR as the sole defining feature of vowel categories in Mongolian is not fully accurate either. In any case, the two vowel categories differ primarily with regards to tongue root position, and \u00b1RTR is a convenient and fairly accurate descriptor for the articulatory parameters involved. <ref>Svantesson, J.-O., Tsendina, A., Karlsson, A., & Franz\u00e9n, V.

There are two sets of vocal harmony systems: a simple one and a complex one. The simple one is concerned with the '''low vowels e, a''' and has only the [\u00b1front] feature (''e'' front vs ''a'' back). The complex one is concerned with the '''high vowels i, \u00fc, \u0131, u''' and has both [\u00b1front] and [\u00b1rounded] features (''i'' front unrounded vs ''\u00fc'' front rounded and ''\u0131'' back unrounded vs ''u'' back rounded). The close-mid vowels ''\u00f6, o'' are not involved in vowel harmony processes.\n\n=====Front/back harmony=====\n[[Turkish language|Turkish]] has two classes of vowels{{spaced ndash}}''front'' and ''back''. Vowel harmony states that words may not contain both front and back vowels. Therefore, most grammatical suffixes come in front and back forms, e.g. ''T\u00fcrkiye''''de''''' \"in Turkey\" but ''Almanya''''da''''' \"in Germany\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+Turkish vowel harmony<ref>Examples from {{Harvcoltxt|Roca|Johnson|1999|p=150}}</ref>\n|-\n!

This gives constructions such as ''T\u00fcrkiye''''dir''''' \"it is Turkey\", ''kap\u0131'''d\u0131r''''' \"it is the door\", but ''g\u00fcn'''d\u00fcr''''' \"it is day\", ''palto'''dur''''' \"it is the coat\".\n\n=====Exceptions=====\nNot all suffixes obey vowel harmony perfectly.\n\nIn the suffix ''-(i)yor'', the ''o'' is invariant, while the ''i'' changes according to the preceding vowel; for example ''s\u00f6n'''\u00fc'''y'''o'''r'' \u2013 \"he/she/it fades\". Likewise, in the suffix ''-(y)ken'',  the ''e'' is invariant: ''Roma'dayk'''e'''n'' \u2013 \"When in Rome\"; and so is the ''i'' in the suffix ''-(y)ebil'': ''inan\u0131l'''a'''b'''i'''lir'' \u2013 \"credible\". The suffix ''-ki'' exhibits partial harmony, never taking a back vowel but allowing only the front-voweled variant ''-k\u00fc'': ''d\u00fcnk'''\u00fc''''' \u2013 \"belonging to yesterday\"; ''yar\u0131nk'''i''''' \u2013 \"belonging to tomorrow\".\n\nMost Turkish words do not only have vowel harmony for suffixes, but also internally. However, there are many exceptions.\n\nCompound words are considered separate words with respect to vowel harmony: vowels do not have to harmonize between members of the compound (thus forms like {{italics correction|''bu''}}|''g\u00fcn'' \"this|day\" = \"today\" are permissible). Vowel harmony does not apply for [[loanword]]s, as in ''otob\u00fcs'' \u2013 from French \"autobus\". There are also a few native modern Turkish words that do not follow the rule (such as ''anne'' \"mother\" or ''karde\u015f'' \"sibling\" which used to obey vowel harmony in their older forms, ''ana'' and ''kar\u0131nda\u015f'', respectively). However, in such words, suffixes nevertheless harmonize with the final vowel; thus ''annes'''i''''' \u2013 \"his/her mother\", and ''voleybolc'''u''''' \u2013 \"volleyball player\".\n\nIn some loanwords the final vowel is an ''a'', ''o'' or ''u'' and thus looks like a back vowel, but is phonetically actually a front vowel, and governs vowel harmony accordingly. An example is the word ''saat'', meaning \"hour\" or \"clock\", a loanword from Arabic. Its plural is ''sa'''a'''tl'''e'''r''. This is not truly an exception to vowel harmony itself; rather, it is an exception to the rule that ''a'' denotes a front vowel.\n\nDisharmony tends to disappear through analogy, especially within loanwords; e.g. ''H\u00fcsn\u00fc'' (a man's name) < earlier ''H\u00fcsni'', from Arabic ''husn\u00ee''; ''M\u00fcsl\u00fcman'' \"Moslem, Muslim (adj. and n.)\" < Ottoman Turkish ''m\u00fcslim\u00e2n'', from Persian ''mosalm\u00e2n'').\n\n===Uralic languages===\nMany, though not all, Uralic languages show vowel harmony between front and back vowels. Vowel harmony is often hypothesized to have existed in [[Proto-Uralic]], though its original scope remains a matter of discussion.\n\n====Samoyedic====\nVowel harmony is found in [[Nganasan language|Nganasan]] and is reconstructed also for [[Proto-Samoyedic]].\n\n====Hungarian====\n\n=====Vowel types=====\n\n{| align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em\"\n|-\n!

One vowel words including only the neutral vowels ''i'', ''\u00ed'' or ''\u00e9'' are unpredictable (not in case of ''e'' which surely gets front vowel suffix).\n\nOne essential difference in classification between Hungarian and Finnish is that standard Hungarian (along with 3 out of 10 local dialects) does not observe the difference between Finnish '\u00e4' {{IPA|[\u00e6]}} and 'e' {{IPA|[e]}}{{spaced ndash}}the Hungarian front vowel 'e' {{IPA|[\u025b]}} is closely pronounced as the Finnish front vowel '\u00e4' {{IPA|[\u00e6]}}. 7 out of the 10 local dialects have the vowel \u00eb {{IPA|[e]}} which has never been part of the Hungarian alphabet, and thus is not used in practice.\n\n=====Behaviour of neutral vowels=====\n{| align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em\"\n|-\n|colspan=2 align=right| ||open||middle||closed\n|-\n|colspan=2 align=center| '''Back''' (\"low\")\n| a \u00e1 || o \u00f3 || u \u00fa\n|-\n|rowspan=2 align=center| '''Front'''<br>(\"high\")||'''unrounded'''<br>(neutral)\n|&nbsp; || e \u00e9 || i \u00ed\n|-\n|'''rounded'''\n| &nbsp; || \u00f6 \u0151 || \u00fc \u0171\n|-\n|}\n''Unrounded front vowels'' (or ''Intermediate'' or ''neutral'' vowels) can occur together with either ''back vowels'' (e.g. ''r'''\u00e9'''p'''a''''' carrot, ''k'''o'''cs'''i''''' car) or ''rounded front vowels'' (e.g. ''tet\u0151'', ''t\u00fcnd\u00e9r''), but ''rounded front vowels'' and ''back vowels'' can occur together only in words of foreign origins (e.g. ''sof\u0151r'' = chauffeur, French word for driver). The basic rule is that words including at least one back vowel take back vowel suffixes (e.g. ''r\u00e9p\u00e1|ban'' in a carrot, ''kocsi|ban'' in a car), while words excluding back vowels usually take front vowel suffixes (except for words including only the vowels ''i'' or ''\u00ed'', for which there is no general rule, e.g. ''liszt|et'', ''hid|at'').\n\nSome other rules and guidelines to consider:\n* Compound words get suffix according to the last word, e.g.: ''\u00e1rt\u00e9r'' (floodplain) compound of ''\u00e1r'' + ''t\u00e9r'' gets front vowel suffix just as the word ''t\u00e9r'' when stands alone (''t\u00e9r|en'', ''\u00e1rt\u00e9r|en'')\n* In case of words of obvious foreign origins: only the last vowel counts (if it is not ''i'' or ''\u00ed''): ''sof'''\u0151'''r|h'''\u00f6'''z, n\u00fc'''a'''nsz|sz'''a'''l, gener'''\u00e1'''l|'''\u00e1'''s, okt\u00f3b'''e'''r|b'''e'''n, parlam'''e'''nt|b'''e'''n, szoftv'''e'''r|r'''e'''l''\n** If the last vowel of the foreign word is ''i'' or ''\u00ed'', then the last but one vowel will be taken into consideration, e.g. ''p'''a'''p\u00edr|h'''o'''z'', ''R'''a'''shid|d'''a'''l''. If the foreign word includes only the vowels ''i'' or ''\u00ed'' then it gets front vowel suffix, e.g.: ''Mitch-nek'' ( = ''for Mitch'')\n** There are some non-Hungarian geographical names that have no vowels at all (e.g. the Croatian island of ''Krk''), in which case as the word does not include back vowel, it gets front vowel suffix (e.g. ''Krk-re'' = to Krk)\n* For acronyms: the last vowel counts (just as in case of foreign words), e.g.: ''HR'' (pronounced: ''h\u00e1-er'') gets front vowel suffix as the last pronounced vowel is front vowel (''HR-rel'' = with HR)\n* Some 1-syllable Hungarian words with '''i''', '''\u00ed''' or '''\u00e9''' are strictly using front suffixes (''g'''\u00e9'''p|r'''e''', m'''\u00e9'''ly|r'''\u0151'''l, v'''\u00ed'''z'' > ''v'''i'''z|'''e'''t'', ''h'''\u00ed'''r|'''e'''k''), while some others can take back suffixes only (''h'''\u00e9'''j|'''a'''k, sz'''\u00ed'''j|r'''\u00f3'''l'', ''ny'''\u00ed'''l'' > ''ny'''i'''l|'''a'''t'', ''zs'''\u00ed'''r|b'''a'''n'', '''''\u00ed'''r|'''\u00e1'''s'')\n* Some foreign words that have fit to the Hungarian language and start with back vowel and end with front vowel can take either front or back suffixes (so can be optionally considered foreign word or Hungarian word): ''f'''a'''rmer|b'''a'''n'' or ''farm'''e'''r|b'''e'''n''\n<!-- Source in Hungarian: http://www.mancs.hu/index.php?gcPage=/public/hirek/hir.php&id=12241 -->\n\n=====Suffixes with multiple forms=====\nGrammatical suffixes in Hungarian can have one, two, three, or four forms:\n* ''one form'': every word gets the same suffix regardless of the included vowels (e.g. ''-kor'')\n* ''two forms'' (most common): words get either back vowel or front vowel suffix (as mentioned above) (e.g. ''-ban/-ben'')\n* ''three forms'': there is one back vowel form and two front vowel forms; one for words of which last vowel is rounded front vowel and one for words of which last vowel is not rounded front vowel (e.g. ''-hoz/-hez/-h\u00f6z'')\n* ''four forms'': there are two back vowel forms and two front vowel forms (e.g. -''ot/-at/-et/-\u00f6t'' or simply ''-t'', if the last sound is a vowel)\nAn example on basic numerals:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em\"\n|-\n|colspan=3|\n|align=\"middle\"| '''-kor'''<br>(''at'', for time)\n|align=\"middle\"| '''-ban/-ben'''<br>(''in'')\n|align=\"middle\"| '''-hoz/-hez/-h\u00f6z'''<br>(''to'')\n|'''-ot/-at/-et/-\u00f6t'''\n(accusative)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |'''Back'''\n|(regular stem)\n|h'''a'''t (6)\n| rowspan=\"4\" |hat'''kor'''<br>nyolc'''kor'''<br>h\u00e1rom'''kor'''<br>egy'''kor'''<br>n\u00e9gy'''kor'''<br>kilenc'''kor'''<br>\u00f6t'''kor'''<br>kett\u0151'''kor'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |hat'''ban'''<br>nyolc'''ban'''<br>h\u00e1rom'''ban'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |hat'''hoz'''<br>nyolc'''hoz'''<br>h\u00e1rom'''hoz'''\n|hat'''ot'''\n|-\n|(vowel-opening stem)|| ny'''o'''lc (8)<br>h'''\u00e1'''r'''o'''m (3)\n|nyolc'''at'''\nh\u00e1rm'''at'''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"middle\" |'''Front'''\n|'''unrounded'''<br>(neutral) || '''e'''gy (1)<br>n'''\u00e9'''gy (4)<br>k'''i'''l'''e'''nc (9)\n| rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"middle\" align=\"middle\" | egy'''ben'''<br>n\u00e9gy'''ben'''<br>kilenc'''ben'''<br>\u00f6t'''ben'''<br>kett\u0151'''ben'''\n| align=\"middle\" |egy'''hez'''<br>n\u00e9gy'''hez'''<br>kilenc'''hez'''\n|egy'''et'''\nn\u00e9gy'''et'''\n\nkilenc'''et'''\n|-\n|'''rounded''' || '''\u00f6'''t (5)<br>kett'''\u0151''' (2)\n| align=\"middle\" | \u00f6t'''h\u00f6z'''<br>kett\u0151'''h\u00f6z'''\n|\u00f6t'''\u00f6t'''\nkett\u0151'''t'''\n|}\n\n====Mansi====\nVowel harmony occurred in [[Southern Mansi]].\n\n====Khanty====\nIn the [[Khanty language]], vowel harmony occurs in the Eastern dialects, and affects both inflectional and derivational suffixes. The Vakh-Vasyugan dialect has a particularly extensive system of vowel harmony, with seven different front-back pairs:<ref>{{cite book|title=Eastern Ostyak chrestomathy|first=J\u00e1nos|last=Gulya|year=1966|series=Indiana University Publications, Uralic and Altaic series|volume=51|pp=37\u201339}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It has been lost in [[Livonian language|Livonian]] and in Standard [[Estonian language|Estonian]], where the front vowels ''\u00fc'' ''\u00e4'' ''\u00f6'' occur only in the first (stressed) syllable. [[South Estonian language|South Estonian]] [[V\u00f5ro language|V\u00f5ro]] (and [[Seto language|Seto]]) language as well as some Estonian dialects, however retain vowel harmony.\n\n=====Finnish=====\n[[File:Finnish vowel harmony Venn diagram.svg|thumb|A diagram illustrating vowel harmony in Finnish.]]\n[[File:Finnish vowel harmony.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Finnish vowel harmony and case agreement exemplified by ''mahdollisissa yll\u00e4tt\u00e4viss\u00e4 tilanteissa'' (\"in possible unexpected situations\"): ''mahdollinen'' takes ''-ssa'', ''yll\u00e4tt\u00e4v\u00e4'' takes ''-ss\u00e4'' and ''tilanne'', with a neutral vowel first but a back vowel second, takes ''-ssa''.]]\n\nIn the [[Finnish language]], there are three classes of vowels{{spaced ndash}}''front'', ''back'', and ''neutral'', where each front vowel has a back vowel pairing. Grammatical endings such as case and derivational endings{{spaced ndash}}but not [[enclitic]]s{{spaced ndash}}have only archiphonemic vowels U, O, A, which are realized as either back {{IPA|[u, o, \u0251]}} or front {{IPA|[y, \u00f8, \u00e6]}} inside a single word. From vowel harmony it follows that the initial syllable of each single (non-compound) word controls the frontness or backness of the entire word. Non-initially, the neutral vowels are transparent to and unaffected by vowel harmony. In the initial syllable:\n# a back vowel causes all non-initial syllables to be realized with back (or neutral) vowels, e.g. ''pos+ahta+(t)a'' \u2192 ''posahtaa''\n# a front vowel causes all non-initial syllables to be realized with front (or neutral) vowels, e.g. ''r\u00e4j+ahta+(t)a'' \u2192 ''r\u00e4j\u00e4ht\u00e4\u00e4''.\n# a neutral vowel acts like a front vowel, but does not control the frontness or backness of the word: if there are back vowels in non-initial syllables, the word acts like it began with back vowels, even if they come from derivational endings, e.g. ''sih+ahta+(t)a'' \u2192 ''sihahtaa'' cf. ''sih+ise+(t)a'' \u2192 ''sihist\u00e4''\n\nFor example:\n* ''kaura'' begins with back vowel \u2192 ''kauralla''\n* ''kuori'' begins with back vowel \u2192 ''kuorella''\n* ''sieni'' begins without back vowels \u2192 ''sienell\u00e4'' (not *''sienella'')\n* ''k\u00e4yr\u00e4'' begins without back vowels \u2192 ''k\u00e4yr\u00e4ll\u00e4''\n* ''tuote'' begins with back vowels \u2192 ''tuotteessa''\n* ''ker\u00e4'' begins with a neutral vowel \u2192 ''ker\u00e4ll\u00e4''\n* ''kera'' begins with a neutral vowel, but has a noninitial back vowel \u2192 ''keralla''\n\nSome dialects that have a sound change opening diphthong codas also permit archiphonemic vowels in the initial syllable. For example, standard 'ie' is reflected as 'ia' or 'i\u00e4', controlled by noninitial syllables, in the Tampere dialect, e.g. ''ti\u00e4'' \u2190 ''tie'' but ''miakka'' \u2190 ''miekka''.\n\n... as evidenced by ''tuotteessa'' (not *''tuotteess\u00e4''). Even if [[phonology|phonologically]] front vowels precede the suffix ''-nsa'', grammatically it is preceded by a word controlled by a back vowel. As shown in the examples, neutral vowels make the system unsymmetrical, as they are front vowels phonologically, but leave the front/back control to any grammatical front or back vowels. There is little or no change in the actual vowel quality of the neutral vowels.\n\nAs a consequence, Finnish speakers often have problems with pronouncing foreign words which do not obey vowel harmony. For example, ''olympia'' is often pronounced ''olumpia''. The position of some loans is unstandardized (e.g. ''chattailla''/''ch\u00e4tt\u00e4ill\u00e4'' ) or ill-standardized (e.g. ''polymeeri'', sometimes pronounced ''polumeeri'', and ''autorit\u00e4\u00e4rinen'', which violate vowel harmony). Where a foreign word violates vowel harmony by not using front vowels because it begins with a neutral vowel, then last syllable generally counts, although this rule is irregularly followed.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ringen | first1 = Catherine O. | last2 = Hein\u00e4m\u00e4ki | first2 = Orvokki | title = Variation in Finnish Vowel Harmony: An OT Account | url = | journal = Natural Language & Linguistic Theory | volume = 17 | issue = 2| year = 1999 | doi = 10.1023/A:1006158818498 }}</ref> Experiments indicate that e.g. ''miljon\u00e4\u00e4ri'' always becomes (front) ''miljon\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4'', but ''marttyyri'' becomes equally frequently both ''marttyyria'' (back) and ''marttyyri\u00e4'' (front), even by the same speaker.\n\nWith respect to vowel harmony, compound words can be considered separate words. For example, ''syyskuu'' (\"autumn month\" i.e. September) has both ''u'' and ''y'', but it consists of two words ''syys'' and ''kuu'', and declines ''syys\u00b7kuu\u00b7ta'' (not *''syyskuut\u00e4''). The same goes for enclitics, e.g. ''taaksep\u00e4in'' \"backwards\" consists of the word ''taakse'' \"to back\" and ''-p\u00e4in'' \"-wards\", which gives e.g. ''taaksep\u00e4ink\u00e4\u00e4n'' (not *''taaksep\u00e4inkaan'' or *''taaksepainkaan''). If fusion takes place, the vowel is harmonized by some speakers, e.g. ''t\u00e4ll\u00e4inen'' pro ''t\u00e4llainen'' \u2190 ''t\u00e4m\u00e4n lainen''.\n\nSome Finnish words whose stems contain only neutral vowels exhibit an alternating pattern in terms of vowel harmony when inflected or forming new words through derivation. Examples include ''meri'' \"sea\", ''meress\u00e4'' \"in the sea\" ([[inessive]]), but ''merta'' ([[partitive]]), not *''mert\u00e4''; ''veri'' \"blood\", ''verest\u00e4'' \"from the blood\" ([[elative case|elative]]), but ''verta'' (partitive), not *''vert\u00e4''; ''pel\u00e4t\u00e4'' \"to be afraid\", but ''pelko'' \"fear\", not *''pelk\u00f6''; ''kipu'' \"pain\", but ''kipe\u00e4'' \"sore\", not *''kipea''.\n\n[[Helsinki slang]] has slang words that have roots violating vowel harmony, e.g. ''S\u00f6rkka''. This can be interpreted as Swedish influence.\n\n===Yokuts===\n\nVowel harmony is present in all [[Yokutsan languages]] and dialects. For instance, [[Yawelmani language|Yawelmani]] has 4 vowels (which additionally may be either [[Vowel length|long]] or short). These can be grouped as in the table below.\n\n{| align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em\"\n|-\n! || Unrounded || Rounded\n|-\n! High\n| {{IPA|i}} || {{IPA|u}}\n|-\n! Low\n| {{IPA|a}} || {{IPA|\u0254}}\n|-\n|}\n\nVowels in suffixes must harmonize with either {{IPA|/u/}} or its non-{{IPA|/u/}} counterparts or with {{IPA|/\u0254/}} or non-{{IPA|/\u0254/}} counterparts. For example, the vowel in the [[aorist]] suffix appears as {{IPA|/u/}} when it follows a {{IPA|/u/}} in the root, but when it follows all other vowels it appears as {{IPA|/i/}}. Similarly, the vowel in the nondirective gerundial suffix appears as {{IPA|/\u0254/}} when it follows a {{IPA|/\u0254/}} in the root; otherwise it appears as {{IPA|/a/}}.\n\n{|\n| ''-hun''/''-hin'' || &nbsp; || (aorist suffix)\n|-\n| ''mu\u1e6dhun'' || {{IPA|[mu\u0288hun]}} || 'swear (aorist)'\n|-\n| ''giy\u0313hin'' || {{IPA|[\u0261ij\u02c0hin]}} || 'touch (aorist)'\n|-\n| ''gophin'' || {{IPA|[\u0261\u0254phin]}} || 'take of infant (aorist)'\n|-\n| ''xathin'' || {{IPA|[xathin]}} || 'eat (aorist)'\n|-\n| ''-tow''/''-taw'' || &nbsp; || (nondirective gerundial suffix)\n|-\n| ''goptow'' || {{IPA|[\u0261\u0254pt\u0254w]}} || 'take care of infant (nondir. ger.)'\n|-\n| ''giy\u0313taw'' || {{IPA|[\u0261ij\u02c0taw]}} || 'touch (nondir. ger.)'\n|-\n| ''mu\u1e6dtaw'' || {{IPA|[mu\u0288taw]}} || 'swear (nondir. ger.)'\n|-\n| ''xattaw'' || {{IPA|[xat\u02d0aw]}} || 'eat (nondir. ger.)'\n|}\n\nIn addition to the harmony found in suffixes, there is a harmony restriction on word stems where in stems with more than one syllable all vowels are required to be of the same lip rounding and tongue height dimensions. For example, a stem must contain all high rounded vowels or all low rounded vowels, etc. This restriction is further complicated by (i) long high vowels being lowered and (ii) an [[epenthetic vowel]] {{IPA|[i]}} which does not harmonize with stem vowels.\n\n===Sumerian===\nThere is some evidence for vowel harmony according to [[vowel height]] or [[Advanced tongue root|ATR]] in the prefix i<sub>3</sub>/e- in  inscriptions from pre-[[Sargon the Great|Sargonic]] [[Lagash]] (the specifics of the pattern have led a handful of scholars to postulate not only an {{IPA|/o/}} phoneme, but even an {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and, most recently, an {{IPA|/\u0254/}})<ref>{{cite journal| last=Smith| first=Eric J M| year=2007| title=Harmony and the Vowel Inventory of Sumerian| journal=Journal of Cuneiform Studies| volume=57}}</ref> Many cases of partial or complete [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of the vowel of certain prefixes and suffixes to one in the adjacent syllable are reflected in writing in some of the later periods, and there is a noticeable though not absolute tendency for disyllabic stems to have the same vowel in both syllables.<ref>{{cite book| author1-last=Michalowski| author1-first=Piotr| year=2008| chapter=Sumerian| editor1-last=Woodard| editor1-first=Roger D| title=The Ancient Languages of Mesopotamia, Egypt and Aksum| publisher=Cambridge University Press| page=17}}</ref> What appears to be [[Contraction (phonology)|vowel contraction]] in [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] (*/aa/, */ia/, */ua/ > a, */ae/ > a, */ue/ > u, etc.) is also very common.\n\n===Other languages===\nVowel harmony occurs to some degree in many other languages, such as\n* [[Akan languages]] (tongue root position)\n* [[Australian Aboriginal languages]]\n** [[Jingulu language|Jingulu]] \n** [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]]\n* [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] (vowel harmony of one particular timbre across all vowels of a word)<ref name=\"Khan2016\">{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Khan|title=The Neo-Aramaic Dialect of the Assyrian Christians of Urmi (4 vols)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_C5RDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA138|date=16 June 2016|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-31393-4|pages=138\u2013}}</ref>\n* Several [[Bantu languages]] such as:\n** Standard [[Lingala language|Lingala]] (height)\n** [[Kgalagadi language|Kgalagadi]] (height)<ref name=\"bantu-languages\">Derek Nurse, G\u00e9rard Philippson, ''The Bantu languages'', Routledge, 2003. {{ISBN|0-7007-1134-1}}</ref>\n** [[Malila language|Malila]] (height)<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Lojenga, Constance Kutsch| title=Two types of vowel harmony in Malila (M.24)| url=http://www.fflch.usp.br/dl/wocal6special/downloads/Lojenga.pdf| publisher=[[SIL International|SIL]], [[Leiden University]]| access-date=22 November 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719051129/http://www.fflch.usp.br/dl/wocal6special/downloads/Lojenga.pdf| archive-date=19 July 2011| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n** [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]] (right-to-left and left-to-right)<ref name=\"bantu-languages\"/>\n** [[Southern Sotho]] (right-to-left and left-to-right)<ref name=\"bantu-languages\"/>\n** [[Northern Sotho]] (right-to-left and left-to-right)<ref name=\"bantu-languages\"/>\n** [[Tswana language|Tswana]] (right-to-left and left-to-right)<ref name=\"bantu-languages\"/>\n* [[Bezhta language|Bezhta]]\n* Some [[Chadic languages]], such as [[Buwal language|Buwal]]\n* [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]]\n* [[Coeur d'Alene language|Coeur d'Alene]] (tongue root position and height)\n* [[Coosan languages]]\n* [[Dusun]] languages\n* <!-- Modern -->[[Languages of Iberia|Iberian languages]]\n** [[Astur-Leonese]]<ref name=AAC>[http://personales.uniovi.es/web/ariasal/ \u00c1lvaro Arias. \u00abLa armonizaci\u00f3n voc\u00e1lica en fonolog\u00eda funcional (de lo sintagm\u00e1tico en fonolog\u00eda a prop\u00f3sito de dos casos de metafon\u00eda hisp\u00e1nica)\u00bb, ''Moenia'' 11 (2006): 111-139.]</ref>\n** [[Galician language|Galician]]<ref name=AAC /> and [[Portuguese dialects]]\n** [[Catalan language|Catalan]]/[[Valencian language|Valencian]]<ref name=\"lloret\"/>\n** Eastern [[Andalusian Spanish]]<ref name=\"lloret\">{{Harvcoltxt|Lloret|2007}}</ref>\n** [[Murcian Spanish]]<ref name=\"lloret\"/>\n* [[Igbo language|Igbo]] (tongue root position)\n*Italo-[[Italo-Romance|Romance]] languages: several [[Swiss Italian]] dialects (including total vowel harmony systems).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fonetica e fonologia dell'armonia vocalica.

For example, [[Chilcotin language|Chilcotin]] has a phonological process known as ''vowel flattening'' (i.e. post-velar harmony) where vowels must harmonize with [[uvular]] and [[pharyngealisation|pharyngealized]] consonants.\n\nChilcotin has two classes of vowels:\n\n* \"flat\" vowels {{IPA|[\u1d4ai, e, \u1d4a\u026a, o, \u0254, \u0259, a]}}\n* non-\"flat\" vowels {{IPA|[i, \u026a, u, \u028a, \u00e6, \u025b]}}\n\nAdditionally, Chilcotin has a class of pharyngealized \"flat\" consonants {{IPA|[ts\u02e4, ts\u02b0\u02e4, ts\u02bc\u02e4, s\u02e4, z\u02e4]}}. Whenever a consonant of this class occurs in a word, all preceding vowels must be flat vowels.\n\n{| style=\"margin-left: 1em;\"\n| {{IPA|[j\u0259t\u02b0e\u026cts\u02e4\u02b0os\u02e4]}} || 'he's holding it (fabric)'\n|-\n| {{IPA|[\u0294ap\u0259l\u0259s\u02e4]}} || 'apples'\n|-\n| {{IPA|[nat\u02b0\u00e1k\u02bc\u0259\u0303s\u02e4]}} || 'he'll stretch himself'\n|}\n\nIf flat consonants do not occur in a word, then all vowels will be of the non-flat class:\n\n{| style=\"margin-left: 1em;\"\n| {{IPA|[n\u00e6n\u025bnt\u02b0\u01fds\u028a\u00e7]}} || 'I'll comb hair'\n|-\n| {{IPA|[tet\u02b0\u01fdsk\u02bc\u025bn]}} || 'I'll burn it'\n|-\n| {{IPA|[t\u02b0\u025bt\u026c\u028a\u00e7]}} || 'he laughs'\n|}\n\nOther languages of this region of North America (the Plateau culture area), such as [[St'at'imcets language#Phonological processes|St'\u00e1t'imcets]], have similar vowel-consonant harmonic processes.\n\n===Syllabic synharmony===\nSyllabic synharmony was a process in the [[Proto-Slavic language]] ancestral to all modern [[Slavic languages]]. It refers to the tendency of frontness (palatality) to be generalised across an entire syllable. It was therefore a form of consonant\u2013vowel harmony in which the property 'palatal' or 'non-palatal' applied to an entire syllable at once rather than to each sound individually.\n\nThe result was that back vowels were fronted after ''j'' or a palatal consonant, and consonants were palatalised before ''j'' or a front vowel. Diphthongs were harmonized as well, although they were soon monophthongized because of a tendency to end syllables with a vowel (syllables were or became open). This rule remained in place for a long time, and ensured that a syllable containing a front vowel always began with a palatal consonant, and a syllable containing ''j'' was always preceded by a palatal consonant and followed by a front vowel.\n\nA similar process occurs in [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]], where palatalization of consonants and fronting of vowels is a [[Skolt Sami language#Suprasegmentals|suprasegmental]] process applying to a whole syllable. Suprasegmental palatalization is marked with the letter ''\u02b9'', which is a freestanding [[acute accent]], for example in the word ''v\u00e4\u00e4\u02b9rr'' 'mountain, hill'.\n\n==See also==\n* [[A-mutation]]\n* [[Apophony]]\n* [[Consonant harmony]]\n* [[Consonant mutation]]\n* [[Germanic umlaut]]\n* [[I-mutation]]\n* [[Metaphony]]\n* [[U-mutation (disambiguation)|U-mutation]]<!--intentional link to DAB page-->\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* [http://personales.uniovi.es/web/ariasal/ Arias, \u00c1lvaro (2006): \u00abLa armonizaci\u00f3n voc\u00e1lica en fonolog\u00eda funcional (de lo sintagm\u00e1tico en fonolog\u00eda a prop\u00f3sito de dos casos de metafon\u00eda hisp\u00e1nica)\u00bb, ''Moenia'' 11: 111-139.]\n* {{citation\n|last=Delucchi\n|first=Rachele\n|year=2016\n|title=Fonetica e fonologia dell'armonia vocalica.

In languages with vowel harmony, there are constraints on which vowels may be found near each other. Vowel harmony is found in many [[Agglutination|agglutinative]] languages. [[Suffix|Suffixes]] and [[Prefix|prefixes]] will usually follow vowel harmony rules.\n\n==Terminology==\n{{See also|Germanic umlaut|I-mutation|Metaphony}}\nThe term ''vowel harmony'' is used in two different senses.\n\nIn the first sense, it refers to any type of long distance assimilatory process of vowels, either ''progressive'' or ''regressive''. When used in this sense, the term ''vowel harmony'' is synonymous with the term ''[[metaphony]]''.\n\nIn the second sense, ''vowel harmony'' refers only to ''progressive'' vowel harmony (beginning-to-end). For ''regressive'' harmony, the term ''umlaut'' is used. In this sense, ''metaphony'' is the general term while ''vowel harmony'' and ''umlaut'' are both sub-types of metaphony. The term ''umlaut'' is also used in a different sense to refer to a type of [[vowel gradation]]. This article will use \"vowel harmony\" for both progressive and regressive harmony.\n\n==\"Long-distance\"==\n\nHarmony processes are \"long-distance\" in the sense that the assimilation involves sounds that are separated by intervening [[segment (linguistics)|segment]]s (usually consonant segments). In other words, ''harmony'' refers to the assimilation of sounds that are ''not'' adjacent to each other. For example, a vowel at the beginning of a word can trigger assimilation in a vowel at the end of a word. The assimilation occurs across the entire word in many languages. This is represented schematically in the following diagram:\n\n:{| cellspacing=\"5\" style=\"font-size: 110%;\"\n! <span style=\"line-height: 1.2em;\">before<br>assimilation</span>\n| &nbsp;\n! <span style=\"line-height: 1.2em;\">after<br>assimilation</span>\n|\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:#800000\">'''V<sub>a</sub>'''</span>C<span style=\"color:#008000\">''V<sub>b</sub>''</span>C<span style=\"color:#008000\">''V<sub>b</sub>''</span>C\n| '''\u2192'''\n| <span style=\"color:#800000\">'''V<sub>a</sub>'''</span>C<span style=\"color:#800000\">''V<sub>a</sub>''</span>C<span style=\"color:#800000\">''V<sub>a</sub>''</span>C\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(<span style=\"color:#800000\">V<sub>a</sub></span> = type-a vowel, <span style=\"color:#008000\">V<sub>b</sub></span> = type-b vowel, C = consonant)</small>\n|}\n\nIn the diagram above, the <span style=\"color:#800000\">V<sub>a</sub></span> (type-a vowel) causes the following <span style=\"color:#008000\">V<sub>b</sub></span> (type-b vowel) to assimilate and become the same type of vowel (and thus they become, metaphorically, \"in harmony\").\n\nThe vowel that causes the vowel assimilation is frequently termed the ''trigger'' while the vowels that assimilate (or ''harmonize'') are termed ''targets''. When the vowel triggers lie within the [[root (linguistics)|root]] or [[word stem|stem]] of a word and the [[affix]]es contain the targets, this is called ''stem-controlled'' vowel harmony (the opposite situation is called ''dominant'').<ref name=\"van der Hulst1995\">van der Hulst, H., & van de Weijer, J.

Some languages have more than one system of harmony. For instance, [[Altaic languages]] are proposed to have a rounding harmony superimposed over a backness harmony.\n\nEven among languages with vowel harmony, not all vowels need to participate in the vowel conversions; these vowels are termed ''neutral''. Neutral vowels may be ''opaque'' and block harmonic processes or they may be ''transparent'' and not affect them.<ref name=\"van der Hulst1995\" /> Intervening consonants are also often transparent.\n\nFinally, languages that do have vowel harmony often allow for lexical ''disharmony'', or words with mixed sets of vowels even when an opaque neutral vowel is not involved. Van der Hulst & van de Weijer (1995) point to two such situations: polysyllabic trigger morphemes may contain non-neutral vowels from opposite harmonic sets and certain target morphemes simply fail to harmonize.<ref name=\"van der Hulst1995\" /> Many [[loanword]]s exhibit disharmony. For example, Turkish {{lang|tr|vakit}}, ('time' [from Arabic {{transl|ar|waqt}}]); *{{lang|tr|vak'''\u0131'''t}} would have been expected.\n\n==Languages with vowel harmony==\n\n===Korean===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px;\"\n|+ Korean Vowel Harmony\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Positive/\"light\" (Yang {{lang|ko-Hani|\u967d}})/Plus Vowels\n{{lang|ko|\uc591\uc131\ubaa8\uc74c}} (Yangseong moeum)\n| {{lang|ko|\u314f}} ({{transl|ko|a}}, {{IPA-ko|a|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u3151}} ({{transl|ko|ya}}, {{IPA-ko|ja|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u3157}} ({{transl|ko|o}}, {{IPA-ko|o|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u3158}} ({{transl|ko|wa}}, {{IPA-ko|wa|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u315b}} ({{transl|ko|yo}}, {{IPA-ko|jo|}}) || ({{lang|ko|\u318d}} {{IPA-ko|\u028c|}})\n|-\n| {{lang|ko|\u3150}} ({{transl|ko|ae}}, {{IPA-ko|\u025b|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u3152}} ({{transl|ko|yae}}, {{IPA-ko|j\u025b|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u315a}} ({{transl|ko|oe}}, {{IPA-ko|\u00f8|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u3159}} ({{transl|ko|wae}}, {{IPA-ko|w\u025b|}}) || ({{lang|ko|\u3189}} {{IPA-ko|joj|}}) || ({{lang|ko|\u318e}} {{IPA-ko|\u028cj|}})\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Negative/\"dark\" (Eum {{lang|ko-Hani|\u9670}})/Minus Vowels\n{{lang|ko|\uc74c\uc131\ubaa8\uc74c}} (eumseong moeum)\n| {{lang|ko|\u3153}} ({{transl|ko|eo}}, {{IPA-ko|\u028c,\u0259|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u3155}} ({{transl|ko|yeo}}, {{IPA-ko|j\u028c,j\u0259|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u315c}} ({{transl|ko|u}}, {{IPA-ko|u|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u315d}} ({{transl|ko|wo}}, {{IPA-ko|w\u028c,w\u0259|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u3160}} ({{transl|ko|yu}}, {{IPA-ko|ju|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u3161}} ({{transl|ko|eu}}, {{IPA-ko|\u026f|}})\n|-\n| {{lang|ko|\u3154}} ({{transl|ko|e}}, {{IPA-ko|e|}})) || {{lang|ko|\u3156}} ({{transl|ko|ye}}, {{IPA-ko|je|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u315f}} ({{transl|ko|wi}}, {{IPA-ko|y|}}, {{IPA-ko|wi|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u315e}} ({{transl|ko|we}}, {{IPA-ko|we|}}) || ({{lang|ko|\u318c}} {{IPA-ko|juj|}}) || {{lang|ko|\u3162}} ({{transl|ko|ui}}, {{IPA-ko|\u0270i|}})\n|-\n! |Neutral (Jung {{lang|ko-Hani|\u4e2d}})/Centre Vowels\n{{lang|ko|\uc911\uc131\ubaa8\uc74c}} (jungseong moeum)\n| colspan=\"6\" | {{lang|ko|\u3163}} ({{transl|ko|i}}, {{IPA-ko|i|}})\n|}\n\nThere are three classes of vowels in [[Korean language|Korean]]: positive, negative, and neutral. These categories loosely follow the front (positive) and mid (negative) vowels. Traditionally, Korean had strong vowel harmony; however, this rule is no longer observed strictly in modern Korean. In modern Korean, it is only applied in certain cases such as [[onomatopoeia]], [[adjectives]], [[adverbs]], [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]], and [[interjection]]s. The vowel {{lang|ko|\u3161}} ({{transl|ko|eu}}) is considered a partially neutral and a partially negative vowel. There are other traces of vowel harmony in modern Korean: many native Korean words tend to follow vowel harmony such as {{lang|ko|\uc0ac\ub78c}} ({{transl|ko|saram}}, 'person'), and {{lang|ko|\ubd80\uc5cc}} ({{transl|ko|bu-eok}}, 'kitchen').\n\n===Mongolian===\n{| align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em\"\n|-\n! -RTR\n| \u044d[{{IPA|e}}] || \u04af[{{IPA|u}}] || \u04e9[{{IPA|o}}] || \u0438[{{IPA|i}}]\n|-\n! +RTR\n| \u0430[{{IPA|a}}] || \u0443[{{IPA|\u028a}}] || \u043e[{{IPA|\u0254}}]\n|-\n|}\n\n[[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] exhibits both a [[Advanced and retracted tongue root|tongue root harmony]] and a rounding harmony. In particular, the tongue root harmony involves the vowels: {{IPA|/a, \u028a, \u0254/}} (+RTR) and {{IPA|/i, u, e, o/}} (-RTR). The vowel {{IPA|/i/}} is phonetically similar to the -RTR vowels, however, it is largely transparent to vowel harmony. Rounding harmony only affects the open vowels, {{IPA|/e, o, a, \u0254/}}. Some sources refer to the primary harmonization dimension as pharyngealization or patalalness (among others), but neither of these is technically correct. Likewise, referring to \u00b1RTR as the sole defining feature of vowel categories in Mongolian is not fully accurate either. In any case, the two vowel categories differ primarily with regards to tongue root position, and \u00b1RTR is a convenient and fairly accurate descriptor for the articulatory parameters involved. <ref>Svantesson, J.-O., Tsendina, A., Karlsson, A., & Franz\u00e9n, V.

There are two sets of vocal harmony systems: a simple one and a complex one. The simple one is concerned with the '''low vowels e, a''' and has only the [\u00b1front] feature (''e'' front vs ''a'' back). The complex one is concerned with the '''high vowels i, \u00fc, \u0131, u''' and has both [\u00b1front] and [\u00b1rounded] features (''i'' front unrounded vs ''\u00fc'' front rounded and ''\u0131'' back unrounded vs ''u'' back rounded). The close-mid vowels ''\u00f6, o'' are not involved in vowel harmony processes.\n\n=====Front/back harmony=====\n[[Turkish language|Turkish]] has two classes of vowels{{spaced ndash}}''front'' and ''back''. Vowel harmony states that words may not contain both front and back vowels. Therefore, most grammatical suffixes come in front and back forms, e.g. ''T\u00fcrkiye''''de''''' \"in Turkey\" but ''Almanya''''da''''' \"in Germany\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+Turkish vowel harmony<ref>Examples from {{Harvcoltxt|Roca|Johnson|1999|p=150}}</ref>\n|-\n!

This gives constructions such as ''T\u00fcrkiye''''dir''''' \"it is Turkey\", ''kap\u0131'''d\u0131r''''' \"it is the door\", but ''g\u00fcn'''d\u00fcr''''' \"it is day\", ''palto'''dur''''' \"it is the coat\".\n\n=====Exceptions=====\nNot all suffixes obey vowel harmony perfectly.\n\nIn the suffix ''-(i)yor'', the ''o'' is invariant, while the ''i'' changes according to the preceding vowel; for example ''s\u00f6n'''\u00fc'''y'''o'''r'' \u2013 \"he/she/it fades\". Likewise, in the suffix ''-(y)ken'',  the ''e'' is invariant: ''Roma'dayk'''e'''n'' \u2013 \"When in Rome\"; and so is the ''i'' in the suffix ''-(y)ebil'': ''inan\u0131l'''a'''b'''i'''lir'' \u2013 \"credible\". The suffix ''-ki'' exhibits partial harmony, never taking a back vowel but allowing only the front-voweled variant ''-k\u00fc'': ''d\u00fcnk'''\u00fc''''' \u2013 \"belonging to yesterday\"; ''yar\u0131nk'''i''''' \u2013 \"belonging to tomorrow\".\n\nMost Turkish words do not only have vowel harmony for suffixes, but also internally. However, there are many exceptions.\n\nCompound words are considered separate words with respect to vowel harmony: vowels do not have to harmonize between members of the compound (thus forms like {{italics correction|''bu''}}|''g\u00fcn'' \"this|day\" = \"today\" are permissible). Vowel harmony does not apply for [[loanword]]s, as in ''otob\u00fcs'' \u2013 from French \"autobus\". There are also a few native modern Turkish words that do not follow the rule (such as ''anne'' \"mother\" or ''karde\u015f'' \"sibling\" which used to obey vowel harmony in their older forms, ''ana'' and ''kar\u0131nda\u015f'', respectively). However, in such words, suffixes nevertheless harmonize with the final vowel; thus ''annes'''i''''' \u2013 \"his/her mother\", and ''voleybolc'''u''''' \u2013 \"volleyball player\".\n\nIn some loanwords the final vowel is an ''a'', ''o'' or ''u'' and thus looks like a back vowel, but is phonetically actually a front vowel, and governs vowel harmony accordingly. An example is the word ''saat'', meaning \"hour\" or \"clock\", a loanword from Arabic. Its plural is ''sa'''a'''tl'''e'''r''. This is not truly an exception to vowel harmony itself; rather, it is an exception to the rule that ''a'' denotes a front vowel.\n\nDisharmony tends to disappear through analogy, especially within loanwords; e.g. ''H\u00fcsn\u00fc'' (a man's name) < earlier ''H\u00fcsni'', from Arabic ''husn\u00ee''; ''M\u00fcsl\u00fcman'' \"Moslem, Muslim (adj. and n.)\" < Ottoman Turkish ''m\u00fcslim\u00e2n'', from Persian ''mosalm\u00e2n'').\n\n===Uralic languages===\nMany, though not all, Uralic languages show vowel harmony between front and back vowels. Vowel harmony is often hypothesized to have existed in [[Proto-Uralic]], though its original scope remains a matter of discussion.\n\n====Samoyedic====\nVowel harmony is found in [[Nganasan language|Nganasan]] and is reconstructed also for [[Proto-Samoyedic]].\n\n====Hungarian====\n\n=====Vowel types=====\n\n{| align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em\"\n|-\n!

The basic rule is that words including at least one back vowel get back vowel suffixes (''kar'''ba''''' \u2013 in(to) the arm), while words excluding back vowels get front vowel suffixes (''k\u00e9z'''be''''' \u2013 in(to) the hand). One vowel words including only the neutral vowels ''i'', ''\u00ed'' or ''\u00e9'' are unpredictable (not in case of ''e'' which surely gets front vowel suffix).\n\nOne essential difference in classification between Hungarian and Finnish is that standard Hungarian (along with 3 out of 10 local dialects) does not observe the difference between Finnish '\u00e4' {{IPA|[\u00e6]}} and 'e' {{IPA|[e]}}{{spaced ndash}}the Hungarian front vowel 'e' {{IPA|[\u025b]}} is closely pronounced as the Finnish front vowel '\u00e4' {{IPA|[\u00e6]}}. 7 out of the 10 local dialects have the vowel \u00eb {{IPA|[e]}} which has never been part of the Hungarian alphabet, and thus is not used in practice.\n\n=====Behaviour of neutral vowels=====\n{| align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em\"\n|-\n|colspan=2 align=right| ||open||middle||closed\n|-\n|colspan=2 align=center| '''Back''' (\"low\")\n| a \u00e1 || o \u00f3 || u \u00fa\n|-\n|rowspan=2 align=center| '''Front'''<br>(\"high\")||'''unrounded'''<br>(neutral)\n|&nbsp; || e \u00e9 || i \u00ed\n|-\n|'''rounded'''\n| &nbsp; || \u00f6 \u0151 || \u00fc \u0171\n|-\n|}\n''Unrounded front vowels'' (or ''Intermediate'' or ''neutral'' vowels) can occur together with either ''back vowels'' (e.g. ''r'''\u00e9'''p'''a''''' carrot, ''k'''o'''cs'''i''''' car) or ''rounded front vowels'' (e.g. ''tet\u0151'', ''t\u00fcnd\u00e9r''), but ''rounded front vowels'' and ''back vowels'' can occur together only in words of foreign origins (e.g. ''sof\u0151r'' = chauffeur, French word for driver). The basic rule is that words including at least one back vowel take back vowel suffixes (e.g. ''r\u00e9p\u00e1|ban'' in a carrot, ''kocsi|ban'' in a car), while words excluding back vowels usually take front vowel suffixes (except for words including only the vowels ''i'' or ''\u00ed'', for which there is no general rule, e.g. ''liszt|et'', ''hid|at'').\n\nSome other rules and guidelines to consider:\n* Compound words get suffix according to the last word, e.g.: ''\u00e1rt\u00e9r'' (floodplain) compound of ''\u00e1r'' + ''t\u00e9r'' gets front vowel suffix just as the word ''t\u00e9r'' when stands alone (''t\u00e9r|en'', ''\u00e1rt\u00e9r|en'')\n* In case of words of obvious foreign origins: only the last vowel counts (if it is not ''i'' or ''\u00ed''): ''sof'''\u0151'''r|h'''\u00f6'''z, n\u00fc'''a'''nsz|sz'''a'''l, gener'''\u00e1'''l|'''\u00e1'''s, okt\u00f3b'''e'''r|b'''e'''n, parlam'''e'''nt|b'''e'''n, szoftv'''e'''r|r'''e'''l''\n** If the last vowel of the foreign word is ''i'' or ''\u00ed'', then the last but one vowel will be taken into consideration, e.g. ''p'''a'''p\u00edr|h'''o'''z'', ''R'''a'''shid|d'''a'''l''. If the foreign word includes only the vowels ''i'' or ''\u00ed'' then it gets front vowel suffix, e.g.: ''Mitch-nek'' ( = ''for Mitch'')\n** There are some non-Hungarian geographical names that have no vowels at all (e.g. the Croatian island of ''Krk''), in which case as the word does not include back vowel, it gets front vowel suffix (e.g. ''Krk-re'' = to Krk)\n* For acronyms: the last vowel counts (just as in case of foreign words), e.g.: ''HR'' (pronounced: ''h\u00e1-er'') gets front vowel suffix as the last pronounced vowel is front vowel (''HR-rel'' = with HR)\n* Some 1-syllable Hungarian words with '''i''', '''\u00ed''' or '''\u00e9''' are strictly using front suffixes (''g'''\u00e9'''p|r'''e''', m'''\u00e9'''ly|r'''\u0151'''l, v'''\u00ed'''z'' > ''v'''i'''z|'''e'''t'', ''h'''\u00ed'''r|'''e'''k''), while some others can take back suffixes only (''h'''\u00e9'''j|'''a'''k, sz'''\u00ed'''j|r'''\u00f3'''l'', ''ny'''\u00ed'''l'' > ''ny'''i'''l|'''a'''t'', ''zs'''\u00ed'''r|b'''a'''n'', '''''\u00ed'''r|'''\u00e1'''s'')\n* Some foreign words that have fit to the Hungarian language and start with back vowel and end with front vowel can take either front or back suffixes (so can be optionally considered foreign word or Hungarian word): ''f'''a'''rmer|b'''a'''n'' or ''farm'''e'''r|b'''e'''n''\n<!-- Source in Hungarian: http://www.mancs.hu/index.php?gcPage=/public/hirek/hir.php&id=12241 -->\n\n=====Suffixes with multiple forms=====\nGrammatical suffixes in Hungarian can have one, two, three, or four forms:\n* ''one form'': every word gets the same suffix regardless of the included vowels (e.g. ''-kor'')\n* ''two forms'' (most common): words get either back vowel or front vowel suffix (as mentioned above) (e.g. ''-ban/-ben'')\n* ''three forms'': there is one back vowel form and two front vowel forms; one for words of which last vowel is rounded front vowel and one for words of which last vowel is not rounded front vowel (e.g. ''-hoz/-hez/-h\u00f6z'')\n* ''four forms'': there are two back vowel forms and two front vowel forms (e.g. -''ot/-at/-et/-\u00f6t'' or simply ''-t'', if the last sound is a vowel)\nAn example on basic numerals:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em\"\n|-\n|colspan=3|\n|align=\"middle\"| '''-kor'''<br>(''at'', for time)\n|align=\"middle\"| '''-ban/-ben'''<br>(''in'')\n|align=\"middle\"| '''-hoz/-hez/-h\u00f6z'''<br>(''to'')\n|'''-ot/-at/-et/-\u00f6t'''\n(accusative)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |'''Back'''\n|(regular stem)\n|h'''a'''t (6)\n| rowspan=\"4\" |hat'''kor'''<br>nyolc'''kor'''<br>h\u00e1rom'''kor'''<br>egy'''kor'''<br>n\u00e9gy'''kor'''<br>kilenc'''kor'''<br>\u00f6t'''kor'''<br>kett\u0151'''kor'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |hat'''ban'''<br>nyolc'''ban'''<br>h\u00e1rom'''ban'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |hat'''hoz'''<br>nyolc'''hoz'''<br>h\u00e1rom'''hoz'''\n|hat'''ot'''\n|-\n|(vowel-opening stem)|| ny'''o'''lc (8)<br>h'''\u00e1'''r'''o'''m (3)\n|nyolc'''at'''\nh\u00e1rm'''at'''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"middle\" |'''Front'''\n|'''unrounded'''<br>(neutral) || '''e'''gy (1)<br>n'''\u00e9'''gy (4)<br>k'''i'''l'''e'''nc (9)\n| rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"middle\" align=\"middle\" | egy'''ben'''<br>n\u00e9gy'''ben'''<br>kilenc'''ben'''<br>\u00f6t'''ben'''<br>kett\u0151'''ben'''\n| align=\"middle\" |egy'''hez'''<br>n\u00e9gy'''hez'''<br>kilenc'''hez'''\n|egy'''et'''\nn\u00e9gy'''et'''\n\nkilenc'''et'''\n|-\n|'''rounded''' || '''\u00f6'''t (5)<br>kett'''\u0151''' (2)\n| align=\"middle\" | \u00f6t'''h\u00f6z'''<br>kett\u0151'''h\u00f6z'''\n|\u00f6t'''\u00f6t'''\nkett\u0151'''t'''\n|}\n\n====Mansi====\nVowel harmony occurred in [[Southern Mansi]].\n\n====Khanty====\nIn the [[Khanty language]], vowel harmony occurs in the Eastern dialects, and affects both inflectional and derivational suffixes. The Vakh-Vasyugan dialect has a particularly extensive system of vowel harmony, with seven different front-back pairs:<ref>{{cite book|title=Eastern Ostyak chrestomathy|first=J\u00e1nos|last=Gulya|year=1966|series=Indiana University Publications, Uralic and Altaic series|volume=51|pp=37\u201339}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It has been lost in [[Livonian language|Livonian]] and in Standard [[Estonian language|Estonian]], where the front vowels ''\u00fc'' ''\u00e4'' ''\u00f6'' occur only in the first (stressed) syllable. [[South Estonian language|South Estonian]] [[V\u00f5ro language|V\u00f5ro]] (and [[Seto language|Seto]]) language as well as some Estonian dialects, however retain vowel harmony.\n\n=====Finnish=====\n[[File:Finnish vowel harmony Venn diagram.svg|thumb|A diagram illustrating vowel harmony in Finnish.]]\n[[File:Finnish vowel harmony.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Finnish vowel harmony and case agreement exemplified by ''mahdollisissa yll\u00e4tt\u00e4viss\u00e4 tilanteissa'' (\"in possible unexpected situations\"): ''mahdollinen'' takes ''-ssa'', ''yll\u00e4tt\u00e4v\u00e4'' takes ''-ss\u00e4'' and ''tilanne'', with a neutral vowel first but a back vowel second, takes ''-ssa''.]]\n\nIn the [[Finnish language]], there are three classes of vowels{{spaced ndash}}''front'', ''back'', and ''neutral'', where each front vowel has a back vowel pairing. Grammatical endings such as case and derivational endings{{spaced ndash}}but not [[enclitic]]s{{spaced ndash}}have only archiphonemic vowels U, O, A, which are realized as either back {{IPA|[u, o, \u0251]}} or front {{IPA|[y, \u00f8, \u00e6]}} inside a single word. From vowel harmony it follows that the initial syllable of each single (non-compound) word controls the frontness or backness of the entire word. Non-initially, the neutral vowels are transparent to and unaffected by vowel harmony. In the initial syllable:\n# a back vowel causes all non-initial syllables to be realized with back (or neutral) vowels, e.g. ''pos+ahta+(t)a'' \u2192 ''posahtaa''\n# a front vowel causes all non-initial syllables to be realized with front (or neutral) vowels, e.g. ''r\u00e4j+ahta+(t)a'' \u2192 ''r\u00e4j\u00e4ht\u00e4\u00e4''.\n# a neutral vowel acts like a front vowel, but does not control the frontness or backness of the word: if there are back vowels in non-initial syllables, the word acts like it began with back vowels, even if they come from derivational endings, e.g. ''sih+ahta+(t)a'' \u2192 ''sihahtaa'' cf. ''sih+ise+(t)a'' \u2192 ''sihist\u00e4''\n\nFor example:\n* ''kaura'' begins with back vowel \u2192 ''kauralla''\n* ''kuori'' begins with back vowel \u2192 ''kuorella''\n* ''sieni'' begins without back vowels \u2192 ''sienell\u00e4'' (not *''sienella'')\n* ''k\u00e4yr\u00e4'' begins without back vowels \u2192 ''k\u00e4yr\u00e4ll\u00e4''\n* ''tuote'' begins with back vowels \u2192 ''tuotteessa''\n* ''ker\u00e4'' begins with a neutral vowel \u2192 ''ker\u00e4ll\u00e4''\n* ''kera'' begins with a neutral vowel, but has a noninitial back vowel \u2192 ''keralla''\n\nSome dialects that have a sound change opening diphthong codas also permit archiphonemic vowels in the initial syllable. For example, standard 'ie' is reflected as 'ia' or 'i\u00e4', controlled by noninitial syllables, in the Tampere dialect, e.g. ''ti\u00e4'' \u2190 ''tie'' but ''miakka'' \u2190 ''miekka''.\n\n... as evidenced by ''tuotteessa'' (not *''tuotteess\u00e4''). Even if [[phonology|phonologically]] front vowels precede the suffix ''-nsa'', grammatically it is preceded by a word controlled by a back vowel. As shown in the examples, neutral vowels make the system unsymmetrical, as they are front vowels phonologically, but leave the front/back control to any grammatical front or back vowels. There is little or no change in the actual vowel quality of the neutral vowels.\n\nAs a consequence, Finnish speakers often have problems with pronouncing foreign words which do not obey vowel harmony. For example, ''olympia'' is often pronounced ''olumpia''. The position of some loans is unstandardized (e.g. ''chattailla''/''ch\u00e4tt\u00e4ill\u00e4'' ) or ill-standardized (e.g. ''polymeeri'', sometimes pronounced ''polumeeri'', and ''autorit\u00e4\u00e4rinen'', which violate vowel harmony). Where a foreign word violates vowel harmony by not using front vowels because it begins with a neutral vowel, then last syllable generally counts, although this rule is irregularly followed.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ringen | first1 = Catherine O. | last2 = Hein\u00e4m\u00e4ki | first2 = Orvokki | title = Variation in Finnish Vowel Harmony: An OT Account | url = | journal = Natural Language & Linguistic Theory | volume = 17 | issue = 2| year = 1999 | doi = 10.1023/A:1006158818498 }}</ref> Experiments indicate that e.g. ''miljon\u00e4\u00e4ri'' always becomes (front) ''miljon\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4'', but ''marttyyri'' becomes equally frequently both ''marttyyria'' (back) and ''marttyyri\u00e4'' (front), even by the same speaker.\n\nWith respect to vowel harmony, compound words can be considered separate words. For example, ''syyskuu'' (\"autumn month\" i.e. September) has both ''u'' and ''y'', but it consists of two words ''syys'' and ''kuu'', and declines ''syys\u00b7kuu\u00b7ta'' (not *''syyskuut\u00e4''). The same goes for enclitics, e.g. ''taaksep\u00e4in'' \"backwards\" consists of the word ''taakse'' \"to back\" and ''-p\u00e4in'' \"-wards\", which gives e.g. ''taaksep\u00e4ink\u00e4\u00e4n'' (not *''taaksep\u00e4inkaan'' or *''taaksepainkaan''). If fusion takes place, the vowel is harmonized by some speakers, e.g. ''t\u00e4ll\u00e4inen'' pro ''t\u00e4llainen'' \u2190 ''t\u00e4m\u00e4n lainen''.\n\nSome Finnish words whose stems contain only neutral vowels exhibit an alternating pattern in terms of vowel harmony when inflected or forming new words through derivation. Examples include ''meri'' \"sea\", ''meress\u00e4'' \"in the sea\" ([[inessive]]), but ''merta'' ([[partitive]]), not *''mert\u00e4''; ''veri'' \"blood\", ''verest\u00e4'' \"from the blood\" ([[elative case|elative]]), but ''verta'' (partitive), not *''vert\u00e4''; ''pel\u00e4t\u00e4'' \"to be afraid\", but ''pelko'' \"fear\", not *''pelk\u00f6''; ''kipu'' \"pain\", but ''kipe\u00e4'' \"sore\", not *''kipea''.\n\n[[Helsinki slang]] has slang words that have roots violating vowel harmony, e.g. ''S\u00f6rkka''. This can be interpreted as Swedish influence.\n\n===Yokuts===\n\nVowel harmony is present in all [[Yokutsan languages]] and dialects. For instance, [[Yawelmani language|Yawelmani]] has 4 vowels (which additionally may be either [[Vowel length|long]] or short). These can be grouped as in the table below.\n\n{| align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em\"\n|-\n! || Unrounded || Rounded\n|-\n! High\n| {{IPA|i}} || {{IPA|u}}\n|-\n! Low\n| {{IPA|a}} || {{IPA|\u0254}}\n|-\n|}\n\nVowels in suffixes must harmonize with either {{IPA|/u/}} or its non-{{IPA|/u/}} counterparts or with {{IPA|/\u0254/}} or non-{{IPA|/\u0254/}} counterparts. For example, the vowel in the [[aorist]] suffix appears as {{IPA|/u/}} when it follows a {{IPA|/u/}} in the root, but when it follows all other vowels it appears as {{IPA|/i/}}. Similarly, the vowel in the nondirective gerundial suffix appears as {{IPA|/\u0254/}} when it follows a {{IPA|/\u0254/}} in the root; otherwise it appears as {{IPA|/a/}}.\n\n{|\n| ''-hun''/''-hin'' || &nbsp; || (aorist suffix)\n|-\n| ''mu\u1e6dhun'' || {{IPA|[mu\u0288hun]}} || 'swear (aorist)'\n|-\n| ''giy\u0313hin'' || {{IPA|[\u0261ij\u02c0hin]}} || 'touch (aorist)'\n|-\n| ''gophin'' || {{IPA|[\u0261\u0254phin]}} || 'take of infant (aorist)'\n|-\n| ''xathin'' || {{IPA|[xathin]}} || 'eat (aorist)'\n|-\n| ''-tow''/''-taw'' || &nbsp; || (nondirective gerundial suffix)\n|-\n| ''goptow'' || {{IPA|[\u0261\u0254pt\u0254w]}} || 'take care of infant (nondir. ger.)'\n|-\n| ''giy\u0313taw'' || {{IPA|[\u0261ij\u02c0taw]}} || 'touch (nondir. ger.)'\n|-\n| ''mu\u1e6dtaw'' || {{IPA|[mu\u0288taw]}} || 'swear (nondir. ger.)'\n|-\n| ''xattaw'' || {{IPA|[xat\u02d0aw]}} || 'eat (nondir. ger.)'\n|}\n\nIn addition to the harmony found in suffixes, there is a harmony restriction on word stems where in stems with more than one syllable all vowels are required to be of the same lip rounding and tongue height dimensions. For example, a stem must contain all high rounded vowels or all low rounded vowels, etc. This restriction is further complicated by (i) long high vowels being lowered and (ii) an [[epenthetic vowel]] {{IPA|[i]}} which does not harmonize with stem vowels.\n\n===Sumerian===\nThere is some evidence for vowel harmony according to [[vowel height]] or [[Advanced tongue root|ATR]] in the prefix i<sub>3</sub>/e- in  inscriptions from pre-[[Sargon the Great|Sargonic]] [[Lagash]] (the specifics of the pattern have led a handful of scholars to postulate not only an {{IPA|/o/}} phoneme, but even an {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and, most recently, an {{IPA|/\u0254/}})<ref>{{cite journal| last=Smith| first=Eric J M| year=2007| title=Harmony and the Vowel Inventory of Sumerian| journal=Journal of Cuneiform Studies| volume=57}}</ref> Many cases of partial or complete [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of the vowel of certain prefixes and suffixes to one in the adjacent syllable are reflected in writing in some of the later periods, and there is a noticeable though not absolute tendency for disyllabic stems to have the same vowel in both syllables.<ref>{{cite book| author1-last=Michalowski| author1-first=Piotr| year=2008| chapter=Sumerian| editor1-last=Woodard| editor1-first=Roger D| title=The Ancient Languages of Mesopotamia, Egypt and Aksum| publisher=Cambridge University Press| page=17}}</ref> What appears to be [[Contraction (phonology)|vowel contraction]] in [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] (*/aa/, */ia/, */ua/ > a, */ae/ > a, */ue/ > u, etc.) is also very common.\n\n===Other languages===\nVowel harmony occurs to some degree in many other languages, such as\n* [[Akan languages]] (tongue root position)\n* [[Australian Aboriginal languages]]\n** [[Jingulu language|Jingulu]] \n** [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]]\n* [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] (vowel harmony of one particular timbre across all vowels of a word)<ref name=\"Khan2016\">{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Khan|title=The Neo-Aramaic Dialect of the Assyrian Christians of Urmi (4 vols)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_C5RDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA138|date=16 June 2016|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-31393-4|pages=138\u2013}}</ref>\n* Several [[Bantu languages]] such as:\n** Standard [[Lingala language|Lingala]] (height)\n** [[Kgalagadi language|Kgalagadi]] (height)<ref name=\"bantu-languages\">Derek Nurse, G\u00e9rard Philippson, ''The Bantu languages'', Routledge, 2003. {{ISBN|0-7007-1134-1}}</ref>\n** [[Malila language|Malila]] (height)<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Lojenga, Constance Kutsch| title=Two types of vowel harmony in Malila (M.24)| url=http://www.fflch.usp.br/dl/wocal6special/downloads/Lojenga.pdf| publisher=[[SIL International|SIL]], [[Leiden University]]| access-date=22 November 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719051129/http://www.fflch.usp.br/dl/wocal6special/downloads/Lojenga.pdf| archive-date=19 July 2011| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n** [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]] (right-to-left and left-to-right)<ref name=\"bantu-languages\"/>\n** [[Southern Sotho]] (right-to-left and left-to-right)<ref name=\"bantu-languages\"/>\n** [[Northern Sotho]] (right-to-left and left-to-right)<ref name=\"bantu-languages\"/>\n** [[Tswana language|Tswana]] (right-to-left and left-to-right)<ref name=\"bantu-languages\"/>\n* [[Bezhta language|Bezhta]]\n* Some [[Chadic languages]], such as [[Buwal language|Buwal]]\n* [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]]\n* [[Coeur d'Alene language|Coeur d'Alene]] (tongue root position and height)\n* [[Coosan languages]]\n* [[Dusun]] languages\n* <!-- Modern -->[[Languages of Iberia|Iberian languages]]\n** [[Astur-Leonese]]<ref name=AAC>[http://personales.uniovi.es/web/ariasal/ \u00c1lvaro Arias. \u00abLa armonizaci\u00f3n voc\u00e1lica en fonolog\u00eda funcional (de lo sintagm\u00e1tico en fonolog\u00eda a prop\u00f3sito de dos casos de metafon\u00eda hisp\u00e1nica)\u00bb, ''Moenia'' 11 (2006): 111-139.]</ref>\n** [[Galician language|Galician]]<ref name=AAC /> and [[Portuguese dialects]]\n** [[Catalan language|Catalan]]/[[Valencian language|Valencian]]<ref name=\"lloret\"/>\n** Eastern [[Andalusian Spanish]]<ref name=\"lloret\">{{Harvcoltxt|Lloret|2007}}</ref>\n** [[Murcian Spanish]]<ref name=\"lloret\"/>\n* [[Igbo language|Igbo]] (tongue root position)\n*Italo-[[Italo-Romance|Romance]] languages: several [[Swiss Italian]] dialects (including total vowel harmony systems).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fonetica e fonologia dell'armonia vocalica.

Other types of harmony involve consonants (and is known as [[consonant harmony]]). Rarer types of harmony are those that involve [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] or both vowels and consonants (e.g. ''postvelar harmony'').\n\n===Vowel-consonant harmony===\n\nSome languages have harmony processes that involve an interaction between vowels and consonants. For example, [[Chilcotin language|Chilcotin]] has a phonological process known as ''vowel flattening'' (i.e. post-velar harmony) where vowels must harmonize with [[uvular]] and [[pharyngealisation|pharyngealized]] consonants.\n\nChilcotin has two classes of vowels:\n\n* \"flat\" vowels {{IPA|[\u1d4ai, e, \u1d4a\u026a, o, \u0254, \u0259, a]}}\n* non-\"flat\" vowels {{IPA|[i, \u026a, u, \u028a, \u00e6, \u025b]}}\n\nAdditionally, Chilcotin has a class of pharyngealized \"flat\" consonants {{IPA|[ts\u02e4, ts\u02b0\u02e4, ts\u02bc\u02e4, s\u02e4, z\u02e4]}}. Whenever a consonant of this class occurs in a word, all preceding vowels must be flat vowels.\n\n{| style=\"margin-left: 1em;\"\n| {{IPA|[j\u0259t\u02b0e\u026cts\u02e4\u02b0os\u02e4]}} || 'he's holding it (fabric)'\n|-\n| {{IPA|[\u0294ap\u0259l\u0259s\u02e4]}} || 'apples'\n|-\n| {{IPA|[nat\u02b0\u00e1k\u02bc\u0259\u0303s\u02e4]}} || 'he'll stretch himself'\n|}\n\nIf flat consonants do not occur in a word, then all vowels will be of the non-flat class:\n\n{| style=\"margin-left: 1em;\"\n| {{IPA|[n\u00e6n\u025bnt\u02b0\u01fds\u028a\u00e7]}} || 'I'll comb hair'\n|-\n| {{IPA|[tet\u02b0\u01fdsk\u02bc\u025bn]}} || 'I'll burn it'\n|-\n| {{IPA|[t\u02b0\u025bt\u026c\u028a\u00e7]}} || 'he laughs'\n|}\n\nOther languages of this region of North America (the Plateau culture area), such as [[St'at'imcets language#Phonological processes|St'\u00e1t'imcets]], have similar vowel-consonant harmonic processes.\n\n===Syllabic synharmony===\nSyllabic synharmony was a process in the [[Proto-Slavic language]] ancestral to all modern [[Slavic languages]]. It refers to the tendency of frontness (palatality) to be generalised across an entire syllable. It was therefore a form of consonant\u2013vowel harmony in which the property 'palatal' or 'non-palatal' applied to an entire syllable at once rather than to each sound individually.\n\nThe result was that back vowels were fronted after ''j'' or a palatal consonant, and consonants were palatalised before ''j'' or a front vowel. Diphthongs were harmonized as well, although they were soon monophthongized because of a tendency to end syllables with a vowel (syllables were or became open). This rule remained in place for a long time, and ensured that a syllable containing a front vowel always began with a palatal consonant, and a syllable containing ''j'' was always preceded by a palatal consonant and followed by a front vowel.\n\nA similar process occurs in [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]], where palatalization of consonants and fronting of vowels is a [[Skolt Sami language#Suprasegmentals|suprasegmental]] process applying to a whole syllable. Suprasegmental palatalization is marked with the letter ''\u02b9'', which is a freestanding [[acute accent]], for example in the word ''v\u00e4\u00e4\u02b9rr'' 'mountain, hill'.\n\n==See also==\n* [[A-mutation]]\n* [[Apophony]]\n* [[Consonant harmony]]\n* [[Consonant mutation]]\n* [[Germanic umlaut]]\n* [[I-mutation]]\n* [[Metaphony]]\n* [[U-mutation (disambiguation)|U-mutation]]<!--intentional link to DAB page-->\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* [http://personales.uniovi.es/web/ariasal/ Arias, \u00c1lvaro (2006): \u00abLa armonizaci\u00f3n voc\u00e1lica en fonolog\u00eda funcional (de lo sintagm\u00e1tico en fonolog\u00eda a prop\u00f3sito de dos casos de metafon\u00eda hisp\u00e1nica)\u00bb, ''Moenia'' 11: 111-139.]\n* {{citation\n|last=Delucchi\n|first=Rachele\n|year=2016\n|title=Fonetica e fonologia dell'armonia vocalica.

It is based on the novel ''[[Schindler's Ark]]'' by [[Australia]]n novelist [[Thomas Keneally]]. The film follows [[Oskar Schindler]], a [[Sudeten German]] businessman who together with his wife [[Emilie Schindler]] saved more than a thousand mostly [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] refugees from [[the Holocaust]] by employing them in his factories during [[World War II]]. It stars [[Liam Neeson]] as Schindler, [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer [[Amon G\u00f6th]], and [[Ben Kingsley]] as Schindler's Jewish accountant [[Itzhak Stern]].\n\nIdeas for a film about the ''[[Schindlerjuden]]'' (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. [[Poldek Pfefferberg]], one of the ''Schindlerjuden'', made it his life's mission to tell Schindler's story. Spielberg became interested when executive [[Sidney Sheinberg]] sent him a book review of ''Schindler's Ark''. [[Universal Pictures]] bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several directors before deciding to direct it.\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland, over 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot in [[black and white]] and approached the film as a documentary. Cinematographer [[Janusz Kami\u0144ski]] wanted to create a sense of timelessness. [[John Williams]] composed the score, and violinist [[Itzhak Perlman]] performed the main theme.\n\n''Schindler's List'' [[Film premiere|premiered]] on November 30, 1993, in [[Washington, D.C.]] and was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States. Often listed among the [[greatest films ever made]],{{sfn|Corliss|Schickel|2005}}{{sfn|Maltin|1999}}{{sfn|Channel 4|2008}}<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.afi.com/100years/movies10.aspx|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|title=AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies \u2013 10th Anniversary Edition|date=June 20, 2007|accessdate=November 24, 2018}}</ref> it was also a box office success, earning $322 million worldwide on a $22 million budget. It was nominated for twelve [[Academy Awards]], winning seven, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and won numerous other awards, including seven [[BAFTA]]s and three [[Golden Globe]]s. In 2007, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked ''Schindler's List'' 8th on its [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|list of the 100 best American films]] of all time. The [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2004.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Krak\u00f3w]] during [[World War II]], the Germans have forced local [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] into the overcrowded [[Krak\u00f3w Ghetto]]. [[Oskar Schindler]], an [[ethnic German]] from [[Czechoslovakia]], arrives in the city hoping to make his fortune. A member of the [[Nazi Party]], Schindler lavishes bribes on [[Wehrmacht]] (German armed forces) and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officials and acquires [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory|a factory]] to produce [[enamelware]]. To help him run the business, Schindler enlists the aid of [[Itzhak Stern]], a local Jewish official who has contacts with [[black market]]eers and the Jewish business community. Stern helps Schindler arrange financing for the factory. Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys wealth and status as \"Herr Direktor\", and Stern handles administration. Schindler hires Jewish workers because they cost less, while Stern ensures that as many people as possible are deemed essential to the German war effort, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps or killed.\n\nSS-''[[Untersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' (second lieutenant) [[Amon G\u00f6th]] arrives in Krak\u00f3w to oversee construction of [[Krak\u00f3w-P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp|P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp]]. When the camp is completed, he orders the ghetto liquidated. Many people are shot and killed in the process of emptying the ghetto. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat as she hides from the Nazis, and later sees her body among a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with G\u00f6th and, through bribery and lavish gifts, continues to enjoy SS support. G\u00f6th brutally mistreats his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa, and the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes G\u00f6th into allowing him to build a sub-camp.\n\nAs the Germans begin to lose the war, G\u00f6th is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at P\u0142asz\u00f3w to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Schindler asks G\u00f6th to allow him to move his workers to a [[Br\u00fcnnlitz labor camp|new munitions factory]] he plans to build in [[Brn\u011bnec|Br\u00fcnnlitz]] near his home town [[Svitavy|Zwittau]]. G\u00f6th agrees, but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern create \"Schindler's List\" \u2013 a list of about 850 people to be transferred to Brinnlitz and thus saved from transport to Auschwitz.\n\nAs the Jewish workers are transported by train to [[Brn\u011bnec|Br\u00fcnnlitz]], the one carrying the women and girls is accidentally redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss]], the commandant of Auschwitz, with a bag of diamonds to win their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the factory floor without special permission and encourages the Jews to observe the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]]. Over the next seven months, he spends much of his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies; due to Schindler's own machinations, the factory does not produce any usable armaments during this period. Schindler runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders, ending the war in Europe.\n\nAs a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancing [[Red Army]] to avoid capture. The SS guards in Schindler's factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them not to, so that they can \"return to [their] families as men, instead of murderers.\" He bids farewell to his workers and prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give Schindler a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a [[Talmud]]ic quotation: \"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.\" Schindler is touched but also ashamed, as he feels he should have done even more. He breaks down sobbing, and is comforted by the workers. After he and his wife leave, the ''[[Schindlerjuden]]'' spend the night on the factory grounds and are awoken the next morning by a Soviet officer, who announces that they have been liberated. The workers leave the factory and walk to a nearby town, encountering a Red Army cavalryman who stares at them in silence when asked \"are there any Jews left?\"\n\nAn epilogue reveals that Schindler's marriage failed after the war, as did his attempts to start new businesses, while G\u00f6th was arrested, tried, and executed for crimes against humanity. Schindler was later honored by [[Yad Vashem]] for his efforts to save his workers from being put to death. In the present, many of the surviving ''Schindlerjuden'' and the actors portraying them visit Schindler's grave and place stones on its marker, the traditional Jewish sign of respect on visiting a grave. The final visitor is Liam Neeson, who lays two roses on the marker.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Liam Neeson Deauville 2012 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Liam Neeson (seen here in 2012) was cast as Oskar Schindler in the film.]]\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Oskar Schindler]]\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Itzhak Stern]]\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Amon G\u00f6th]]\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as [[Emilie Schindler]]\n* [[Jonathan Sagall]] as [[Poldek Pfefferberg]]\n* [[Embeth Davidtz]] as Helen Hirsch\n* [[Ma\u0142gorzata Gebel]] as Wiktoria Klonowska\n* [[Mark Ivanir]] as Marcel Goldberg\n* [[Beatrice Macola]] as Ingrid\n* [[Andrzej Seweryn]] as [[Julian Scherner]]\n* [[Friedrich von Thun]] as Rolf Czurda\n* [[Jerzy Nowak]] as Investor\n* [[Norbert Weisser]] as Albert Hujar\n* [[Anna Mucha]] as Danka Dresner\n* Adi Nitzan as Mila Pfefferberg\n* [[Piotr Polk]] as [[Leo Rosner]]\n* [[Rami Heuberger]] as [[Joseph Bau]]\n* [[Ezra Dagan]] as Rabbi Menasha Lewartow\n* [[Elina L\u00f6wensohn]] as [[Diana Reiter]]\n* Hans-J\u00f6rg Assmann as [[Julius Madritsch]]\n* [[Hans-Michael Rehberg]] as [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss|Rudolf H\u00f6\u00df]]\n* Daniel Del Ponte as [[Josef Mengele]]\n* [[August Schm\u00f6lzer]] as Dieter Reeder\n* [[Ludger Pistor]] as [[Josef Leipold]]{{efn|The film incorrectly spells Leipold's name as \"Josef Liepold\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/152059321@N07/|title=\"Schindler's List\" credits still| accessdate= August 7, 2018|last=Hughes |first=Katie |publisher=Flickr|date=August 7, 2018}}</ref>}}\n* Oliwia D\u0105browska as [[#The girl in red|the Girl in Red]]\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nPfefferberg, one of the ''Schindlerjuden'', made it his life's mission to tell the story of his savior.

Spielberg, astounded by Schindler's story, jokingly asked if it was true. \"I was drawn to it because of the paradoxical nature of the character,\" he said. \"What would drive a man like this to suddenly take everything he had earned and put it all in the service of saving these lives?\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=424}} Spielberg expressed enough interest for Universal Pictures to buy the rights to the novel.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=424}} At their first meeting in spring 1983, he told Pfefferberg he would start filming in ten years.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} In the end credits of the film, Pfefferberg is credited as a consultant under the name Leopold Page.{{sfn|Freer|2001|p=220}}\n\n[[File:Krakow Ghetto 39066.jpg|thumb|left|The liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto in March 1943 is the subject of a 15-minute segment of the film.]]\n\nSpielberg was unsure if he was mature enough to make a film about the Holocaust, and the project remained \"on [his] guilty conscience\".{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} Spielberg tried to pass the project to director [[Roman Polanski]], who turned it down. Polanski's mother was killed at Auschwitz, and he had lived in and survived the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} Polanski eventually directed his own Holocaust drama ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'' (2002). Spielberg also offered the film to [[Sydney Pollack]] and [[Martin Scorsese]], who was attached to direct ''Schindler's List'' in 1988. However, Spielberg was unsure of letting Scorsese direct the film, as \"I'd given away a chance to do something for my children and family about the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Spielberg offered him the chance to direct the [[Cape Fear (1991 film)|1991 remake of ''Cape Fear'']] instead.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=603}} [[Billy Wilder]] expressed an interest in directing the film as a memorial to his family, most of whom were murdered in the Holocaust.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} [[Brian De Palma]] also turned down an offer to direct.{{sfn|Power|2018}}\n\nSpielberg finally decided to take on the project when he noticed that [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] were being given serious consideration by the media. With the rise of [[neo-Nazism]] after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], he worried that people were too accepting of intolerance, as they were in the 1930s.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} Sid Sheinberg greenlit the film on condition that Spielberg made ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' first. Spielberg later said, \"He knew that once I had directed ''Schindler'' I wouldn't be able to do ''Jurassic Park''.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} The picture was assigned a small budget of $22 million, as Holocaust films are not usually profitable.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=27}}{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} Spielberg forwent a salary for the film, calling it \"[[Blood money (restitution)|blood money]]\",{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} and believed the film would flop.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}}\n\nIn 1983, Keneally was hired to adapt his book, and he turned in a 220-page script. His adaptation focused on Schindler's numerous relationships, and Keneally admitted he did not compress the story enough. Spielberg hired [[Kurt Luedtke]], who had adapted the screenplay of ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'', to write the next draft. Luedtke gave up almost four years later, as he found Schindler's change of heart too unbelievable.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} During his time as director, Scorsese hired [[Steven Zaillian]] to write a script. When he was handed back the project, Spielberg found Zaillian's 115-page draft too short, and asked him to extend it to 195 pages. Spielberg wanted more focus on the Jews in the story, and he wanted Schindler's transition to be gradual and ambiguous, not a sudden breakthrough or epiphany. He extended the ghetto liquidation sequence, as he \"felt very strongly that the sequence had to be almost unwatchable.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nNeeson auditioned as Schindler early on, and was cast in December 1992, after Spielberg saw him perform in ''[[Anna Christie]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].{{sfn|Palowski|1998|pp=86\u201387}} [[Warren Beatty]] participated in a script reading, but Spielberg was concerned that he could not disguise his accent and that he would bring \"movie star baggage\".{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} [[Kevin Costner]] and [[Mel Gibson]] expressed interest in portraying Schindler, but Spielberg preferred to cast the relatively unknown Neeson, so the actor's star quality would not overpower the character.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=86}} Neeson felt Schindler enjoyed outsmarting the Nazis, who regarded him as a bit of a buffoon. \"They don't quite take him seriously, and he used that to full effect.\"{{sfn|''Entertainment Weekly'', January 21, 1994}} To help him prepare for the role, Spielberg showed Neeson film clips of [[Time Warner]] [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Steve Ross (Time Warner CEO)|Steve Ross]], who had a charisma that Spielberg compared to Schindler's.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=429}} He also located a tape of Schindler speaking, which Neeson studied to learn the correct intonations and pitch.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=87}}\n\nFiennes was cast as Amon G\u00f6th after Spielberg viewed his performances in ''[[A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia]]'' and ''[[Emily Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights]]''. Spielberg said of Fiennes' audition that \"I saw sexual evil. It is all about subtlety: there were moments of kindness that would move across his eyes and then instantly run cold.\"{{sfn|Corliss|1994}} Fiennes put on {{convert|28|lb}} to play the role. He watched historic [[newsreel]]s and talked to Holocaust survivors who knew G\u00f6th. In portraying him, Fiennes said \"I got close to his pain. Inside him is a fractured, miserable human being. I feel split about him, sorry for him. He's like some dirty, battered doll I was given and that I came to feel peculiarly attached to.\"{{sfn|Corliss|1994}} Doctors Samuel J.

Thousands of extras were hired during filming.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Spielberg cast Israeli and Polish actors specially chosen for their Eastern European appearance.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=128}} Many of the German actors were reluctant to don the SS uniform, but some of them later thanked Spielberg for the cathartic experience of performing in the movie.{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} Halfway through the shoot, Spielberg conceived the epilogue, where 128 survivors pay their respects at Schindler's grave in Jerusalem. The producers scrambled to find the ''Schindlerjuden'' and fly them in to film the scene.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}}\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 1, 1993 in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]], with a planned schedule of 75 days.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=48}} The crew shot at or near the actual locations, though the P\u0142asz\u00f3w camp had to be reconstructed in a nearby abandoned quarry, as modern high rise apartments were visible from the site of the original camp.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}}{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=14}} Interior shots of the enamelware factory in Krak\u00f3w were filmed at a similar facility in [[Olkusz]], while exterior shots and the scenes on the factory stairs were filmed at the actual factory.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|pp=109, 111}} The production received permission from Polish authorities to film on the grounds of the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]], but objections to filming within the actual death camp were raised by the [[World Jewish Congress]].<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/us/jews-try-to-halt-auschwitz-filming.html | work=The New York Times | agency = Reuters | first= | last= | title=Jews Try To Halt Auschwitz Filming | date=January 17, 1993 |accessdate = April 12, 2020}}</ref> To avoid filming inside the actual death camp, the film crew constructed a replica of a portion of the camp just outside the entrance of Birkenau.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=62}} \n\nThere were some [[antisemitic]] incidents. A woman who encountered Fiennes in his Nazi uniform told him that \"the Germans were charming people. They didn't kill anybody who didn't deserve it\".{{sfn|Corliss|1994}} Antisemitic symbols were scrawled on billboards near shooting locations,{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} while Kingsley nearly entered a brawl with an elderly German-speaking businessman who insulted Israeli actor Michael Schneider.{{sfn|Ansen|Kuflik|1993}} Nonetheless, Spielberg stated that at [[Passover]], \"all the German actors showed up. They put on [[Kippah|yarmulkes]] and opened up [[Haggadah|Haggadas]], and the Israeli actors moved right next to them and began explaining it to them.

He was surprised that he did not cry while visiting Auschwitz; instead he found himself filled with outrage. He was one of many crew members who could not force themselves to watch during shooting of the scene where aging Jews are forced to run naked while being selected by Nazi doctors to go to Auschwitz.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=433}} Spielberg commented that he felt more like a reporter than a film maker \u2013 he would set up scenes and then watch events unfold, almost as though he were witnessing them rather than creating a movie.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}} Several actresses broke down when filming the shower scene, including one who was born in a concentration camp.{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} Spielberg, his wife [[Kate Capshaw]], and their five children rented a house in suburban Krak\u00f3w for the duration of filming.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=44}} He later thanked his wife \"for rescuing me ninety-two days in a row&nbsp;... when things just got too unbearable\".{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=415}} [[Robin Williams]] called Spielberg to cheer him up, given the profound lack of humor on the set.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=415}}\n\nSpielberg spent several hours each evening editing ''Jurassic Park'', which was scheduled to premiere in June 1993.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=45}}\n\nSpielberg occasionally used [[German language|German]] and [[Polish language]] dialogue to create a sense of realism. He initially considered making the film entirely in those languages, but decided \"there's too much safety in reading {{interp|subtitles}}. It would have been an excuse {{interp|for the audience}} to take their eyes off the screen and watch something else.\"{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}}\n\n=== Cinematography ===\nInfluenced by the 1985 documentary film ''[[Shoah (film)|Shoah]]'', Spielberg decided not to plan the film with [[storyboard]]s, and to shoot it like a documentary. Forty percent of the film was shot with handheld cameras, and the modest budget meant the film was shot quickly over seventy-two days.{{sfn|McBride|1997|pp=431\u2013432, 434}} Spielberg felt that this gave the film \"a spontaneity, an edge, and it also serves the subject.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} He filmed without using [[Steadicam]]s, elevated shots, or [[zoom lens]]es, \"everything that for me might be considered a safety net.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} This matured Spielberg, who felt that in the past he had always been paying tribute to directors such as [[Cecil B. DeMille]] or [[David Lean]].{{sfn|Ansen|Kuflik|1993}}\n\nThe decision to shoot the film mainly in [[black and white]] contributed to the documentary style of cinematography, which cinematographer Janusz Kami\u0144ski compared to [[German Expressionism]] and [[Italian neorealism]].{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} Kami\u0144ski said that he wanted to give the impression of timelessness to the film, so the audience would \"not have a sense of when it was made.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}} Spielberg decided to use black and white to match the feel of actual documentary footage of the era.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} Universal chairman Tom Pollock asked him to shoot the film on a color [[Original camera negative|negative]], to allow color VHS copies of the film to later be sold, but Spielberg did not want to accidentally \"beautify events.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Schindler's List (soundtrack)}}\nJohn Williams, who frequently collaborates with Spielberg, composed the score for ''Schindler's List''. The composer was amazed by the film, and felt it would be too challenging. He said to Spielberg, \"You need a better composer than I am for this film.\" Spielberg responded, \"I know. But they're all dead!\"{{sfn|Gangel|2005}} [[Itzhak Perlman]] performs the theme on the violin.{{sfn|Freer|2001|p=220}}\n\nIn the scene where the ghetto is being liquidated by the Nazis, the folk song ''[[Oyfn Pripetshik]]'' ({{lang-yi|\u05d0\u05d5\u05d9\u05e4\u05bf\u05df \u05e4\u05bc\u05e8\u05d9\u05e4\u05bc\u05e2\u05d8\u05e9\u05d9\u05e7}}, 'On the Cooking Stove') is sung by a children's choir. The song was often sung by Spielberg's grandmother, Becky, to her grandchildren.{{sfn|Rubin|2001|pp=73\u201374}} The [[clarinet]] solos heard in the film were recorded by [[Klezmer]] virtuoso [[Giora Feidman]].{{sfn|Medien|2011}} Williams won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] for ''Schindler's List'', his fifth win.{{sfn|66th Academy Awards|1994}} Selections from the score were released on a [[Schindler's List (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]].{{sfn|AllMusic listing}}\n\n== Themes and symbolism ==\nThe film explores the theme of [[good versus evil]], using as its main protagonist a \"good German\", a popular characterization in American cinema.{{sfn|Loshitsky|1997|p=5}}{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} While G\u00f6th is characterized as an almost completely dark and evil person, Schindler gradually evolves from Nazi supporter to rescuer and hero.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=428}} Thus a second theme of redemption is introduced as Schindler, a disreputable schemer on the edges of respectability, becomes a father figure responsible for saving the lives of more than a thousand people.{{sfn|Loshitsky|1997|p=43}}{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=436}}\n\n=== The girl in red ===\n[[File:Schindlers list red dress.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|Schindler sees a girl in red during the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. The red coat is one of the few instances of color used in this predominantly black and white film.]]\nWhile the film is shot primarily in black and white, a red coat is used to distinguish a little girl in the scene depicting the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. Later in the film, Schindler sees her exhumed dead body, recognizable only by the red coat she is still wearing. Spielberg said the scene was intended to symbolize how members of the highest levels of government in the United States knew the Holocaust was occurring, yet did nothing to stop it. \"It was as obvious as a little girl wearing a red coat, walking down the street, and yet nothing was done to bomb the German rail lines. Nothing was being done to slow down&nbsp;... the annihilation of European Jewry,\" he said. \"So that was my message in letting that scene be in color.\"{{sfn|Schickel|2012|pp=161\u2013162}} Andy Patrizio of [[IGN]] notes that the point at which Schindler sees the girl's dead body is the point at which he changes, no longer seeing \"the ash and soot of burning corpses piling up on his car as just an annoyance.\"{{sfn|Patrizio|2004}} Professor [[Andr\u00e9 H. Caron]] of the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] wonders if the red symbolises \"innocence, hope or the red blood of the Jewish people being sacrificed in the horror of the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|Caron|2003}}\n\nThe girl was portrayed by Oliwia D\u0105browska, three years old at the time of filming. Spielberg asked D\u0105browska not to watch the film until she was eighteen, but she watched it when she was eleven, and says she was \"horrified\".{{sfn|Gilman|2013}} Upon seeing the film again as an adult, she was proud of the role she played.{{sfn|Gilman|2013}} Although it was unintentional, the character is similar to [[Roma Ligocka]], who was known in the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto for her red coat. Ligocka, unlike her fictional counterpart, survived the Holocaust. After the film was released, she wrote and published her own story, ''[[The Girl in the Red Coat]]: A Memoir'' (2002, in translation).{{sfn|Ligocka|2002}} The girl in red may have been inspired by Krak\u00f3w resident Genya Gitel Chil, according to a 2014 interview of her family members.{{sfn|Rosner|2014}}\n\n=== Candles ===\nThe opening scene features a family observing [[Shabbat]]. Spielberg said that \"to start the film with the candles being lit&nbsp;... would be a rich bookend, to start the film with a normal Shabbat service before the juggernaut against the Jews begins.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} When the color fades out in the film's opening moments, it gives way to a world in which smoke comes to symbolize bodies being burnt at Auschwitz. Only at the end, when Schindler allows his workers to hold Shabbat services, do the images of candle fire regain their warmth. For Spielberg, they represent \"just a glint of color, and a glimmer of hope.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Sara Horowitz, director of the Koschitzky Centre for Jewish Studies at [[York University]], sees the candles as a symbol for the Jews of Europe, killed and then burned in the [[crematoria]]. The two scenes bracket the Nazi era, marking its beginning and end.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=124}} She points out that normally the woman of the house lights the Sabbath candles. In the film it is men who perform this ritual, demonstrating not only the subservient role of women, but also the subservient position of Jewish men in relation to [[Aryan race|Aryan]] men, especially G\u00f6th and Schindler.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\n=== Other symbolism ===\nTo Spielberg, the black and white presentation of the film came to represent the Holocaust itself: \"The Holocaust was life without light. For me the symbol of life is color. That's why a film about the Holocaust has to be in black-and-white.\"{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=112}} Robert Gellately notes the film in its entirety can be seen as a metaphor for the Holocaust, with early sporadic violence increasing into a crescendo of death and destruction. He also notes a parallel between the situation of the Jews in the film and the debate in [[Nazi Germany]] between making use of the Jews for [[slave labor]] or exterminating them outright.{{sfn|Gellately|1993}} Water is seen as giving deliverance by Alan Mintz, Holocaust Studies professor at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York. He notes its presence in the scene where Schindler arranges for a [[Holocaust train]] loaded with victims awaiting transport to be hosed down, and the scene in Auschwitz, where the women are given an actual shower instead of receiving the expected gassing.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=154}}\n\n== Release ==\nThe film opened on December 15, 1993.

Spielberg's most intense and personal film to date\".{{sfn|Maltin|2013|p=1216}} James Verniere of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' noted the film's restraint and lack of sensationalism, and called it a \"major addition to the body of work about the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|Verniere|1993}} In his review for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', British critic [[John Gross]] said his misgivings that the story would be overly sentimentalized \"were altogether misplaced. Spielberg shows a firm moral and emotional grasp of his material. The film is an outstanding achievement.\"{{sfn|Gross|1994}} Mintz notes that even the film's harshest critics admire the \"visual brilliance\" of the fifteen-minute segment depicting the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. He describes the sequence as \"realistic\" and \"stunning\".{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=147}} He points out that the film has done much to increase Holocaust remembrance and awareness as the remaining survivors pass away, severing the last living links with the catastrophe.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=131}} The film's release in Germany led to widespread discussion about why most Germans did not do more to help.{{sfn|''Houston Post''|1994}}\n\nCriticism of the film also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=134}} Horowitz points out that much of the Jewish activity seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|pp=138\u2013139}} Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=130}} History professor [[Omer Bartov]] of [[Brown University]] notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and G\u00f6th overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened \u2013 a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.{{sfn|Bartov|1997|p=49}}\n\nHorowitz points out that the film's dichotomy of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=137}} Author [[Jason Epstein]] commented that the movie gives the impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case.{{sfn|Epstein|1994}} Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=439}}\n\nBartov wrote that the \"positively repulsive kitsch of the last two scenes seriously undermines much of the film's previous merits\". He describes the humanization of Schindler as \"banal\", and is critical of what he describes as the \"[[Zionist]] closure\" set to the song \"[[Jerusalem of Gold]]\".{{sfn|Bartov|1997|p=45}}\n\n=== Assessment by other filmmakers ===\n''Schindler's List'' was very well received by many of Spielberg's peers. Filmmaker Billy Wilder wrote to Spielberg saying, \"They couldn't have gotten a better man. This movie is absolutely perfection.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} Polanski, who turned down the chance to direct the film, later commented, \"I certainly wouldn't have done as good a job as Spielberg because I couldn't have been as objective as he was.\"{{sfn|Cronin|2005|p=168}} He cited ''Schindler's List'' as an influence on his 1995 film ''[[Death and the Maiden (film)|Death and the Maiden]]''.{{sfn|Cronin|2005|p=167}} The success of ''Schindler's List'' led filmmaker [[Stanley Kubrick]] to abandon his own Holocaust project, ''[[Wartime Lies|Aryan Papers]]'', which would have been about a Jewish boy and his aunt who survive the war by sneaking through Poland while pretending to be Catholic.{{sfn|Goldman|2005}} According to scriptwriter [[Frederic Raphael]], when he suggested to Kubrick that ''Schindler's List'' was a good representation of the Holocaust, Kubrick commented, \"Think that's about the Holocaust? That was about success, wasn't it? The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. ''Schindler's List'' is about 600 who don't.\"{{sfn|Goldman|2005}}{{efn|Schindler is actually credited with saving more than 1,200 Jews.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8578020/Mietek-Pemper.html|title=Mietek Pemper: Obituary|date=June 15, 2011|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=March 16, 2016}}</ref>}}\n\nFilmmaker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] accused Spielberg of using the film to make a profit out of a tragedy while Schindler's wife, [[Emilie Schindler]], lived in poverty in [[Argentina]].{{sfn|Ebert|2002}} Keneally disputed claims that she was never paid for her contributions, \"not least because I had recently sent Emilie a check myself.\"{{sfn|Keneally|2007|p=265}} He also confirmed with Spielberg's office that payment had been sent from there.{{sfn|Keneally|2007|p=265}} Filmmaker [[Michael Haneke]] criticized the sequence in which Schindler's women are accidentally sent off to Auschwitz and herded into showers: \"There's a scene in that film when we don't know if there's gas or water coming out in the showers in the camp. You can only do something like that with a naive audience like in the United States. It's not an appropriate use of the form. Spielberg meant well \u2013 but it was dumb.\"{{sfn|Haneke|2009}}\n\nThe film was criticized by filmmaker and lecturer [[Claude Lanzmann]], director of the nine-hour Holocaust film [[Shoah (film)|''Shoah'']], who called ''Schindler's List'' a \"kitschy melodrama\" and a \"deformation\" of historical truth. \"Fiction is a transgression, I am deeply convinced that there is a ban on depiction [of the Holocaust]\", he said. Lanzmann also criticized Spielberg for viewing the Holocaust through the eyes of a German, saying \"it is the world in reverse.\" He complained, \"I sincerely thought that there was a time before ''Shoah'', and a time after ''Shoah'', and that after ''Shoah'' certain things could no longer be done. Spielberg did them anyway.\"{{sfn|Lanzmann|2007}}\n\n=== Reaction of the Jewish community ===\nAt a 1994 ''[[Village Voice]]'' symposium about the film, historian Annette Insdorf described how her mother, a survivor of three concentration camps, felt gratitude that the Holocaust story was finally being told in a major film that would be widely viewed.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|pp=136\u2013137}} [[Hungarian Jews|Hungarian Jewish]] author [[Imre Kert\u00e9sz]], a Holocaust survivor, feels it is impossible for life in a Nazi concentration camp to be accurately portrayed by anyone who did not experience it first-hand. While commending Spielberg for bringing the story to a wide audience, he found the film's final scene at the graveyard neglected the terrible after-effects of the experience on the survivors and implied that they came through emotionally unscathed.{{sfn|Kert\u00e9sz|2001}} Rabbi [[Uri D. Herscher]] found the film an \"appealing\" and \"uplifting\" demonstration of humanitarianism.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=440}} Norbert Friedman noted that, like many Holocaust survivors, he reacted with a feeling of solidarity towards Spielberg of a sort normally reserved for other survivors.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=136}} [[Albert L. Lewis]], Spielberg's childhood rabbi and teacher, described the movie as \"Steven's gift to his mother, to his people, and in a sense to himself. Now he is a full human being.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=440}}\n\n=== Accolades ===\n''Schindler's List'' featured on a number of \"best of\" lists, including the ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine's Top Hundred as selected by critics [[Richard Corliss]] and [[Richard Schickel]],{{sfn|Corliss|Schickel|2005}} ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine's 100 Greatest Films Centenary Poll conducted in 1995,{{sfn|''Time Out'' Film Guide|1995}} and Leonard Maltin's \"100 Must See Movies of the Century\".{{sfn|Maltin|1999}} The [[Holy See|Vatican]] named ''Schindler's List'' among the most important 45 films ever made.{{sfn|Greydanus|1995}} A [[Channel 4]] poll named ''Schindler's List'' the ninth greatest film of all time,{{sfn|Channel 4|2008}} and it ranked fourth in their 2005 war films poll.{{sfn|Channel 4|2005}} The film was named the best of 1993 by critics such as [[James Berardinelli]],{{sfn|Berardinelli|1993}} Roger Ebert,{{sfn|Ebert|1993b}} and [[Gene Siskel]].{{sfn|Johnson|2011}} Deeming the film \"culturally significant\", the [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2004.{{sfn|Library of Congress|2004}} Spielberg won the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]] for his work,{{sfn|CBC|2013}} and shared the [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]] with co-producers Branko Lustig and Gerald R.

The telecast was the first to receive a TV-M (now [[TV-MA]]) rating under the [[Television content rating systems|TV Parental Guidelines]] that had been established earlier that year.{{sfn|Chuang|1997}} [[Tom Coburn]], then an [[Oklahoma]] congressman, said that in airing the film, NBC had brought television \"to an all-time low, with full-frontal nudity, violence and profanity\", adding that it was an insult to \"decent-minded individuals everywhere\".{{sfn|''Chicago Tribune''|1997}} Under fire from both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], Coburn apologized, saying, \"My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone about saying what I wanted to say.\" He clarified his opinion, stating that the film ought to have been aired later at night when there would not be \"large numbers of children watching without parental supervision\".{{sfn|CNN|1997}}\n\nControversy arose in Germany for the film's television premiere on [[ProSieben]]. Protests among the Jewish community ensued when the station intended to televise it with two commercial breaks of 3\u20134 minutes each. [[Ignatz Bubis]], head of the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]], said: \"It is problematic to interrupt such a movie by commercials\".{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}} Jerzy Kanal, chairman of the Jewish Community of Berlin, added \"It is obvious that the film could have a greater impact [on society] when broadcast unimpeded by commercials. The station has to do everything possible to broadcast the film without interruption.\"{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}} As a compromise, the broadcast included one break consisting of a short news update framed with commercials. [[ProSieben]] was also obliged to broadcast two accompanying documentaries to the film, showing \"The daily lives of the Jews in Hebron and New York\" prior to broadcast and \"The survivors of the Holocaust\" afterwards.{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}}\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], chief censor Henrietta Mendez ordered cuts of three scenes depicting [[sexual intercourse]] and female nudity before the movie could be shown in theaters. Spielberg refused, and pulled the film from screening in Philippine cinemas, which prompted the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] to demand the abolition of the censorship board. [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]] himself intervened, ruling that the movie could be shown uncut to anyone over the age of 15.{{sfn|Branigin|1994}}\n\nAccording to [[Slovak people|Slovak]] filmmaker [[Juraj Herz]], the scene in which a group of women confuse an actual shower with a gas chamber is taken directly, shot by shot, from his film ''Zastihla m\u011b noc'' (''Night Caught Up with Me'', 1986). Herz wanted to sue, but was unable to fund the case.{{sfn|Kosulicova|2002}}\n\nThe song ''Yerushalayim Shel Zahav'' (\"[[Jerusalem of Gold]]\") is featured in the film's soundtrack and plays near the end of the film. This caused some controversy in Israel, as the song (which was written in 1967 by [[Naomi Shemer]]) is widely considered an informal anthem of the Israeli victory in the [[Six-Day War]]. In Israeli prints of the film the song was replaced with ''Halikha LeKesariya'' (\"A Walk to Caesarea\") by [[Hannah Szenes]], a World War II resistance fighter.{{sfn|Bresheeth|1997|p=205}}\n\n== Effect on Krak\u00f3w ==\nDue to the increased interest in Krak\u00f3w created by the film, the city bought [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory]] in 2007 to create a permanent exhibition about the German occupation of the city from 1939 to 1945.

It is based on the novel ''[[Schindler's Ark]]'' by [[Australia]]n novelist [[Thomas Keneally]]. The film follows [[Oskar Schindler]], a [[Sudeten German]] businessman who together with his wife [[Emilie Schindler]] saved more than a thousand mostly [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] refugees from [[the Holocaust]] by employing them in his factories during [[World War II]]. It stars [[Liam Neeson]] as Schindler, [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer [[Amon G\u00f6th]], and [[Ben Kingsley]] as Schindler's Jewish accountant [[Itzhak Stern]].\n\nIdeas for a film about the ''[[Schindlerjuden]]'' (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. [[Poldek Pfefferberg]], one of the ''Schindlerjuden'', made it his life's mission to tell Schindler's story. Spielberg became interested when executive [[Sidney Sheinberg]] sent him a book review of ''Schindler's Ark''. [[Universal Pictures]] bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several directors before deciding to direct it.\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland, over 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot in [[black and white]] and approached the film as a documentary. Cinematographer [[Janusz Kami\u0144ski]] wanted to create a sense of timelessness. [[John Williams]] composed the score, and violinist [[Itzhak Perlman]] performed the main theme.\n\n''Schindler's List'' [[Film premiere|premiered]] on November 30, 1993, in [[Washington, D.C.]] and was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States. Often listed among the [[greatest films ever made]],{{sfn|Corliss|Schickel|2005}}{{sfn|Maltin|1999}}{{sfn|Channel 4|2008}}<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.afi.com/100years/movies10.aspx|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|title=AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies \u2013 10th Anniversary Edition|date=June 20, 2007|accessdate=November 24, 2018}}</ref> it was also a box office success, earning $322 million worldwide on a $22 million budget. It was nominated for twelve [[Academy Awards]], winning seven, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and won numerous other awards, including seven [[BAFTA]]s and three [[Golden Globe]]s. In 2007, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked ''Schindler's List'' 8th on its [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|list of the 100 best American films]] of all time. The [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2004.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Krak\u00f3w]] during [[World War II]], the Germans have forced local [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] into the overcrowded [[Krak\u00f3w Ghetto]]. [[Oskar Schindler]], an [[ethnic German]] from [[Czechoslovakia]], arrives in the city hoping to make his fortune. A member of the [[Nazi Party]], Schindler lavishes bribes on [[Wehrmacht]] (German armed forces) and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officials and acquires [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory|a factory]] to produce [[enamelware]]. To help him run the business, Schindler enlists the aid of [[Itzhak Stern]], a local Jewish official who has contacts with [[black market]]eers and the Jewish business community. Stern helps Schindler arrange financing for the factory. Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys wealth and status as \"Herr Direktor\", and Stern handles administration. Schindler hires Jewish workers because they cost less, while Stern ensures that as many people as possible are deemed essential to the German war effort, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps or killed.\n\nSS-''[[Untersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' (second lieutenant) [[Amon G\u00f6th]] arrives in Krak\u00f3w to oversee construction of [[Krak\u00f3w-P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp|P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp]]. When the camp is completed, he orders the ghetto liquidated. Many people are shot and killed in the process of emptying the ghetto. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat as she hides from the Nazis, and later sees her body among a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with G\u00f6th and, through bribery and lavish gifts, continues to enjoy SS support. G\u00f6th brutally mistreats his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa, and the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes G\u00f6th into allowing him to build a sub-camp.\n\nAs the Germans begin to lose the war, G\u00f6th is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at P\u0142asz\u00f3w to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Schindler asks G\u00f6th to allow him to move his workers to a [[Br\u00fcnnlitz labor camp|new munitions factory]] he plans to build in [[Brn\u011bnec|Br\u00fcnnlitz]] near his home town [[Svitavy|Zwittau]]. G\u00f6th agrees, but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern create \"Schindler's List\" \u2013 a list of about 850 people to be transferred to Brinnlitz and thus saved from transport to Auschwitz.\n\nAs the Jewish workers are transported by train to [[Brn\u011bnec|Br\u00fcnnlitz]], the one carrying the women and girls is accidentally redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss]], the commandant of Auschwitz, with a bag of diamonds to win their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the factory floor without special permission and encourages the Jews to observe the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]]. Over the next seven months, he spends much of his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies; due to Schindler's own machinations, the factory does not produce any usable armaments during this period. Schindler runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders, ending the war in Europe.\n\nAs a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancing [[Red Army]] to avoid capture. The SS guards in Schindler's factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them not to, so that they can \"return to [their] families as men, instead of murderers.\" He bids farewell to his workers and prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give Schindler a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a [[Talmud]]ic quotation: \"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.\" Schindler is touched but also ashamed, as he feels he should have done even more. He breaks down sobbing, and is comforted by the workers. After he and his wife leave, the ''[[Schindlerjuden]]'' spend the night on the factory grounds and are awoken the next morning by a Soviet officer, who announces that they have been liberated. The workers leave the factory and walk to a nearby town, encountering a Red Army cavalryman who stares at them in silence when asked \"are there any Jews left?\"\n\nAn epilogue reveals that Schindler's marriage failed after the war, as did his attempts to start new businesses, while G\u00f6th was arrested, tried, and executed for crimes against humanity. Schindler was later honored by [[Yad Vashem]] for his efforts to save his workers from being put to death. In the present, many of the surviving ''Schindlerjuden'' and the actors portraying them visit Schindler's grave and place stones on its marker, the traditional Jewish sign of respect on visiting a grave. The final visitor is Liam Neeson, who lays two roses on the marker.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Liam Neeson Deauville 2012 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Liam Neeson (seen here in 2012) was cast as Oskar Schindler in the film.]]\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Oskar Schindler]]\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Itzhak Stern]]\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Amon G\u00f6th]]\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as [[Emilie Schindler]]\n* [[Jonathan Sagall]] as [[Poldek Pfefferberg]]\n* [[Embeth Davidtz]] as Helen Hirsch\n* [[Ma\u0142gorzata Gebel]] as Wiktoria Klonowska\n* [[Mark Ivanir]] as Marcel Goldberg\n* [[Beatrice Macola]] as Ingrid\n* [[Andrzej Seweryn]] as [[Julian Scherner]]\n* [[Friedrich von Thun]] as Rolf Czurda\n* [[Jerzy Nowak]] as Investor\n* [[Norbert Weisser]] as Albert Hujar\n* [[Anna Mucha]] as Danka Dresner\n* Adi Nitzan as Mila Pfefferberg\n* [[Piotr Polk]] as [[Leo Rosner]]\n* [[Rami Heuberger]] as [[Joseph Bau]]\n* [[Ezra Dagan]] as Rabbi Menasha Lewartow\n* [[Elina L\u00f6wensohn]] as [[Diana Reiter]]\n* Hans-J\u00f6rg Assmann as [[Julius Madritsch]]\n* [[Hans-Michael Rehberg]] as [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss|Rudolf H\u00f6\u00df]]\n* Daniel Del Ponte as [[Josef Mengele]]\n* [[August Schm\u00f6lzer]] as Dieter Reeder\n* [[Ludger Pistor]] as [[Josef Leipold]]{{efn|The film incorrectly spells Leipold's name as \"Josef Liepold\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/152059321@N07/|title=\"Schindler's List\" credits still| accessdate= August 7, 2018|last=Hughes |first=Katie |publisher=Flickr|date=August 7, 2018}}</ref>}}\n* Oliwia D\u0105browska as [[#The girl in red|the Girl in Red]]\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nPfefferberg, one of the ''Schindlerjuden'', made it his life's mission to tell the story of his savior. Pfefferberg attempted to produce a [[biopic]] of Oskar Schindler with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] in 1963, with [[Howard Koch (screenwriter)|Howard Koch]] writing, but the deal fell through.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=425}}{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=557}} In 1982, Thomas Keneally published his historical novel ''[[Schindler's Ark]]'', which he wrote after a chance meeting with Pfefferberg in Los Angeles in 1980.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=6}} [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] president [[Sidney Sheinberg|Sid Sheinberg]] sent director Steven Spielberg a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review of the book. Spielberg, astounded by Schindler's story, jokingly asked if it was true. \"I was drawn to it because of the paradoxical nature of the character,\" he said. \"What would drive a man like this to suddenly take everything he had earned and put it all in the service of saving these lives?\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=424}} Spielberg expressed enough interest for Universal Pictures to buy the rights to the novel.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=424}} At their first meeting in spring 1983, he told Pfefferberg he would start filming in ten years.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} In the end credits of the film, Pfefferberg is credited as a consultant under the name Leopold Page.{{sfn|Freer|2001|p=220}}\n\n[[File:Krakow Ghetto 39066.jpg|thumb|left|The liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto in March 1943 is the subject of a 15-minute segment of the film.]]\n\nSpielberg was unsure if he was mature enough to make a film about the Holocaust, and the project remained \"on [his] guilty conscience\".{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} Spielberg tried to pass the project to director [[Roman Polanski]], who turned it down. Polanski's mother was killed at Auschwitz, and he had lived in and survived the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} Polanski eventually directed his own Holocaust drama ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'' (2002). Spielberg also offered the film to [[Sydney Pollack]] and [[Martin Scorsese]], who was attached to direct ''Schindler's List'' in 1988. However, Spielberg was unsure of letting Scorsese direct the film, as \"I'd given away a chance to do something for my children and family about the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Spielberg offered him the chance to direct the [[Cape Fear (1991 film)|1991 remake of ''Cape Fear'']] instead.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=603}} [[Billy Wilder]] expressed an interest in directing the film as a memorial to his family, most of whom were murdered in the Holocaust.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} [[Brian De Palma]] also turned down an offer to direct.{{sfn|Power|2018}}\n\nSpielberg finally decided to take on the project when he noticed that [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] were being given serious consideration by the media. With the rise of [[neo-Nazism]] after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], he worried that people were too accepting of intolerance, as they were in the 1930s.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} Sid Sheinberg greenlit the film on condition that Spielberg made ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' first. Spielberg later said, \"He knew that once I had directed ''Schindler'' I wouldn't be able to do ''Jurassic Park''.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} The picture was assigned a small budget of $22 million, as Holocaust films are not usually profitable.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=27}}{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} Spielberg forwent a salary for the film, calling it \"[[Blood money (restitution)|blood money]]\",{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} and believed the film would flop.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}}\n\nIn 1983, Keneally was hired to adapt his book, and he turned in a 220-page script. His adaptation focused on Schindler's numerous relationships, and Keneally admitted he did not compress the story enough. Spielberg hired [[Kurt Luedtke]], who had adapted the screenplay of ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'', to write the next draft. Luedtke gave up almost four years later, as he found Schindler's change of heart too unbelievable.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} During his time as director, Scorsese hired [[Steven Zaillian]] to write a script. When he was handed back the project, Spielberg found Zaillian's 115-page draft too short, and asked him to extend it to 195 pages. Spielberg wanted more focus on the Jews in the story, and he wanted Schindler's transition to be gradual and ambiguous, not a sudden breakthrough or epiphany. He extended the ghetto liquidation sequence, as he \"felt very strongly that the sequence had to be almost unwatchable.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nNeeson auditioned as Schindler early on, and was cast in December 1992, after Spielberg saw him perform in ''[[Anna Christie]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].{{sfn|Palowski|1998|pp=86\u201387}} [[Warren Beatty]] participated in a script reading, but Spielberg was concerned that he could not disguise his accent and that he would bring \"movie star baggage\".{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} [[Kevin Costner]] and [[Mel Gibson]] expressed interest in portraying Schindler, but Spielberg preferred to cast the relatively unknown Neeson, so the actor's star quality would not overpower the character.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=86}} Neeson felt Schindler enjoyed outsmarting the Nazis, who regarded him as a bit of a buffoon. \"They don't quite take him seriously, and he used that to full effect.\"{{sfn|''Entertainment Weekly'', January 21, 1994}} To help him prepare for the role, Spielberg showed Neeson film clips of [[Time Warner]] [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Steve Ross (Time Warner CEO)|Steve Ross]], who had a charisma that Spielberg compared to Schindler's.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=429}} He also located a tape of Schindler speaking, which Neeson studied to learn the correct intonations and pitch.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=87}}\n\nFiennes was cast as Amon G\u00f6th after Spielberg viewed his performances in ''[[A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia]]'' and ''[[Emily Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights]]''. Spielberg said of Fiennes' audition that \"I saw sexual evil. It is all about subtlety: there were moments of kindness that would move across his eyes and then instantly run cold.\"{{sfn|Corliss|1994}} Fiennes put on {{convert|28|lb}} to play the role. He watched historic [[newsreel]]s and talked to Holocaust survivors who knew G\u00f6th. In portraying him, Fiennes said \"I got close to his pain. Inside him is a fractured, miserable human being. I feel split about him, sorry for him. He's like some dirty, battered doll I was given and that I came to feel peculiarly attached to.\"{{sfn|Corliss|1994}} Doctors Samuel J. Leistedt and Paul Linkowski of the [[Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles]] describe G\u00f6th's character in the film as a classic [[psychopath]].{{sfn|Leistedt|Linkowski|2014}} Fiennes looked so much like G\u00f6th in costume that when Mila Pfefferberg met him, she trembled with fear.{{sfn|Corliss|1994}}\n\nThe character of [[Itzhak Stern]] (played by Ben Kingsley) is a composite of the accountant Stern, factory manager [[Abraham Bankier]], and G\u00f6th's personal secretary, [[Mietek Pemper]].{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=102}} The character serves as Schindler's alter ego and conscience.{{sfn|Freer|2001|p=225}} Kingsley is best known for his Academy Award-winning performance as [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] in the [[Gandhi (film)|1982 biographical film]].{{sfn|Palowski|1998|pp=87\u201388}}\n\nOverall, there are 126 speaking parts in the film. Thousands of extras were hired during filming.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Spielberg cast Israeli and Polish actors specially chosen for their Eastern European appearance.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=128}} Many of the German actors were reluctant to don the SS uniform, but some of them later thanked Spielberg for the cathartic experience of performing in the movie.{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} Halfway through the shoot, Spielberg conceived the epilogue, where 128 survivors pay their respects at Schindler's grave in Jerusalem. The producers scrambled to find the ''Schindlerjuden'' and fly them in to film the scene.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}}\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 1, 1993 in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]], with a planned schedule of 75 days.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=48}} The crew shot at or near the actual locations, though the P\u0142asz\u00f3w camp had to be reconstructed in a nearby abandoned quarry, as modern high rise apartments were visible from the site of the original camp.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}}{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=14}} Interior shots of the enamelware factory in Krak\u00f3w were filmed at a similar facility in [[Olkusz]], while exterior shots and the scenes on the factory stairs were filmed at the actual factory.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|pp=109, 111}} The production received permission from Polish authorities to film on the grounds of the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]], but objections to filming within the actual death camp were raised by the [[World Jewish Congress]].<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/us/jews-try-to-halt-auschwitz-filming.html | work=The New York Times | agency = Reuters | first= | last= | title=Jews Try To Halt Auschwitz Filming | date=January 17, 1993 |accessdate = April 12, 2020}}</ref> To avoid filming inside the actual death camp, the film crew constructed a replica of a portion of the camp just outside the entrance of Birkenau.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=62}} \n\nThere were some [[antisemitic]] incidents. A woman who encountered Fiennes in his Nazi uniform told him that \"the Germans were charming people. They didn't kill anybody who didn't deserve it\".{{sfn|Corliss|1994}} Antisemitic symbols were scrawled on billboards near shooting locations,{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} while Kingsley nearly entered a brawl with an elderly German-speaking businessman who insulted Israeli actor Michael Schneider.{{sfn|Ansen|Kuflik|1993}} Nonetheless, Spielberg stated that at [[Passover]], \"all the German actors showed up. They put on [[Kippah|yarmulkes]] and opened up [[Haggadah|Haggadas]], and the Israeli actors moved right next to them and began explaining it to them. And this family of actors sat around and race and culture were just left behind.\"{{sfn|Ansen|Kuflik|1993}}\n\n{{Quote box |width=30% |align=right |quote=I was hit in the face with my personal life.

He was surprised that he did not cry while visiting Auschwitz; instead he found himself filled with outrage. He was one of many crew members who could not force themselves to watch during shooting of the scene where aging Jews are forced to run naked while being selected by Nazi doctors to go to Auschwitz.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=433}} Spielberg commented that he felt more like a reporter than a film maker \u2013 he would set up scenes and then watch events unfold, almost as though he were witnessing them rather than creating a movie.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}} Several actresses broke down when filming the shower scene, including one who was born in a concentration camp.{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} Spielberg, his wife [[Kate Capshaw]], and their five children rented a house in suburban Krak\u00f3w for the duration of filming.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=44}} He later thanked his wife \"for rescuing me ninety-two days in a row&nbsp;... when things just got too unbearable\".{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=415}} [[Robin Williams]] called Spielberg to cheer him up, given the profound lack of humor on the set.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=415}}\n\nSpielberg spent several hours each evening editing ''Jurassic Park'', which was scheduled to premiere in June 1993.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=45}}\n\nSpielberg occasionally used [[German language|German]] and [[Polish language]] dialogue to create a sense of realism. He initially considered making the film entirely in those languages, but decided \"there's too much safety in reading {{interp|subtitles}}. It would have been an excuse {{interp|for the audience}} to take their eyes off the screen and watch something else.\"{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}}\n\n=== Cinematography ===\nInfluenced by the 1985 documentary film ''[[Shoah (film)|Shoah]]'', Spielberg decided not to plan the film with [[storyboard]]s, and to shoot it like a documentary. Forty percent of the film was shot with handheld cameras, and the modest budget meant the film was shot quickly over seventy-two days.{{sfn|McBride|1997|pp=431\u2013432, 434}} Spielberg felt that this gave the film \"a spontaneity, an edge, and it also serves the subject.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} He filmed without using [[Steadicam]]s, elevated shots, or [[zoom lens]]es, \"everything that for me might be considered a safety net.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} This matured Spielberg, who felt that in the past he had always been paying tribute to directors such as [[Cecil B. DeMille]] or [[David Lean]].{{sfn|Ansen|Kuflik|1993}}\n\nThe decision to shoot the film mainly in [[black and white]] contributed to the documentary style of cinematography, which cinematographer Janusz Kami\u0144ski compared to [[German Expressionism]] and [[Italian neorealism]].{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} Kami\u0144ski said that he wanted to give the impression of timelessness to the film, so the audience would \"not have a sense of when it was made.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}} Spielberg decided to use black and white to match the feel of actual documentary footage of the era.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} Universal chairman Tom Pollock asked him to shoot the film on a color [[Original camera negative|negative]], to allow color VHS copies of the film to later be sold, but Spielberg did not want to accidentally \"beautify events.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Schindler's List (soundtrack)}}\nJohn Williams, who frequently collaborates with Spielberg, composed the score for ''Schindler's List''. The composer was amazed by the film, and felt it would be too challenging. He said to Spielberg, \"You need a better composer than I am for this film.\" Spielberg responded, \"I know. But they're all dead!\"{{sfn|Gangel|2005}} [[Itzhak Perlman]] performs the theme on the violin.{{sfn|Freer|2001|p=220}}\n\nIn the scene where the ghetto is being liquidated by the Nazis, the folk song ''[[Oyfn Pripetshik]]'' ({{lang-yi|\u05d0\u05d5\u05d9\u05e4\u05bf\u05df \u05e4\u05bc\u05e8\u05d9\u05e4\u05bc\u05e2\u05d8\u05e9\u05d9\u05e7}}, 'On the Cooking Stove') is sung by a children's choir. The song was often sung by Spielberg's grandmother, Becky, to her grandchildren.{{sfn|Rubin|2001|pp=73\u201374}} The [[clarinet]] solos heard in the film were recorded by [[Klezmer]] virtuoso [[Giora Feidman]].{{sfn|Medien|2011}} Williams won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] for ''Schindler's List'', his fifth win.{{sfn|66th Academy Awards|1994}} Selections from the score were released on a [[Schindler's List (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]].{{sfn|AllMusic listing}}\n\n== Themes and symbolism ==\nThe film explores the theme of [[good versus evil]], using as its main protagonist a \"good German\", a popular characterization in American cinema.{{sfn|Loshitsky|1997|p=5}}{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} While G\u00f6th is characterized as an almost completely dark and evil person, Schindler gradually evolves from Nazi supporter to rescuer and hero.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=428}} Thus a second theme of redemption is introduced as Schindler, a disreputable schemer on the edges of respectability, becomes a father figure responsible for saving the lives of more than a thousand people.{{sfn|Loshitsky|1997|p=43}}{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=436}}\n\n=== The girl in red ===\n[[File:Schindlers list red dress.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|Schindler sees a girl in red during the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. The red coat is one of the few instances of color used in this predominantly black and white film.]]\nWhile the film is shot primarily in black and white, a red coat is used to distinguish a little girl in the scene depicting the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. Later in the film, Schindler sees her exhumed dead body, recognizable only by the red coat she is still wearing. Spielberg said the scene was intended to symbolize how members of the highest levels of government in the United States knew the Holocaust was occurring, yet did nothing to stop it. \"It was as obvious as a little girl wearing a red coat, walking down the street, and yet nothing was done to bomb the German rail lines. Nothing was being done to slow down&nbsp;... the annihilation of European Jewry,\" he said. \"So that was my message in letting that scene be in color.\"{{sfn|Schickel|2012|pp=161\u2013162}} Andy Patrizio of [[IGN]] notes that the point at which Schindler sees the girl's dead body is the point at which he changes, no longer seeing \"the ash and soot of burning corpses piling up on his car as just an annoyance.\"{{sfn|Patrizio|2004}} Professor [[Andr\u00e9 H. Caron]] of the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] wonders if the red symbolises \"innocence, hope or the red blood of the Jewish people being sacrificed in the horror of the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|Caron|2003}}\n\nThe girl was portrayed by Oliwia D\u0105browska, three years old at the time of filming. Spielberg asked D\u0105browska not to watch the film until she was eighteen, but she watched it when she was eleven, and says she was \"horrified\".{{sfn|Gilman|2013}} Upon seeing the film again as an adult, she was proud of the role she played.{{sfn|Gilman|2013}} Although it was unintentional, the character is similar to [[Roma Ligocka]], who was known in the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto for her red coat. Ligocka, unlike her fictional counterpart, survived the Holocaust. After the film was released, she wrote and published her own story, ''[[The Girl in the Red Coat]]: A Memoir'' (2002, in translation).{{sfn|Ligocka|2002}} The girl in red may have been inspired by Krak\u00f3w resident Genya Gitel Chil, according to a 2014 interview of her family members.{{sfn|Rosner|2014}}\n\n=== Candles ===\nThe opening scene features a family observing [[Shabbat]]. Spielberg said that \"to start the film with the candles being lit&nbsp;... would be a rich bookend, to start the film with a normal Shabbat service before the juggernaut against the Jews begins.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} When the color fades out in the film's opening moments, it gives way to a world in which smoke comes to symbolize bodies being burnt at Auschwitz. Only at the end, when Schindler allows his workers to hold Shabbat services, do the images of candle fire regain their warmth. For Spielberg, they represent \"just a glint of color, and a glimmer of hope.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Sara Horowitz, director of the Koschitzky Centre for Jewish Studies at [[York University]], sees the candles as a symbol for the Jews of Europe, killed and then burned in the [[crematoria]]. The two scenes bracket the Nazi era, marking its beginning and end.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=124}} She points out that normally the woman of the house lights the Sabbath candles. In the film it is men who perform this ritual, demonstrating not only the subservient role of women, but also the subservient position of Jewish men in relation to [[Aryan race|Aryan]] men, especially G\u00f6th and Schindler.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\n=== Other symbolism ===\nTo Spielberg, the black and white presentation of the film came to represent the Holocaust itself: \"The Holocaust was life without light. For me the symbol of life is color. That's why a film about the Holocaust has to be in black-and-white.\"{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=112}} Robert Gellately notes the film in its entirety can be seen as a metaphor for the Holocaust, with early sporadic violence increasing into a crescendo of death and destruction. He also notes a parallel between the situation of the Jews in the film and the debate in [[Nazi Germany]] between making use of the Jews for [[slave labor]] or exterminating them outright.{{sfn|Gellately|1993}} Water is seen as giving deliverance by Alan Mintz, Holocaust Studies professor at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York. He notes its presence in the scene where Schindler arranges for a [[Holocaust train]] loaded with victims awaiting transport to be hosed down, and the scene in Auschwitz, where the women are given an actual shower instead of receiving the expected gassing.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=154}}\n\n== Release ==\nThe film opened on December 15, 1993.

Spielberg's most intense and personal film to date\".{{sfn|Maltin|2013|p=1216}} James Verniere of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' noted the film's restraint and lack of sensationalism, and called it a \"major addition to the body of work about the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|Verniere|1993}} In his review for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', British critic [[John Gross]] said his misgivings that the story would be overly sentimentalized \"were altogether misplaced. Spielberg shows a firm moral and emotional grasp of his material. The film is an outstanding achievement.\"{{sfn|Gross|1994}} Mintz notes that even the film's harshest critics admire the \"visual brilliance\" of the fifteen-minute segment depicting the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. He describes the sequence as \"realistic\" and \"stunning\".{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=147}} He points out that the film has done much to increase Holocaust remembrance and awareness as the remaining survivors pass away, severing the last living links with the catastrophe.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=131}} The film's release in Germany led to widespread discussion about why most Germans did not do more to help.{{sfn|''Houston Post''|1994}}\n\nCriticism of the film also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=134}} Horowitz points out that much of the Jewish activity seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|pp=138\u2013139}} Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=130}} History professor [[Omer Bartov]] of [[Brown University]] notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and G\u00f6th overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened \u2013 a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.{{sfn|Bartov|1997|p=49}}\n\nHorowitz points out that the film's dichotomy of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=137}} Author [[Jason Epstein]] commented that the movie gives the impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case.{{sfn|Epstein|1994}} Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=439}}\n\nBartov wrote that the \"positively repulsive kitsch of the last two scenes seriously undermines much of the film's previous merits\".

Filmmaker Billy Wilder wrote to Spielberg saying, \"They couldn't have gotten a better man. This movie is absolutely perfection.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} Polanski, who turned down the chance to direct the film, later commented, \"I certainly wouldn't have done as good a job as Spielberg because I couldn't have been as objective as he was.\"{{sfn|Cronin|2005|p=168}} He cited ''Schindler's List'' as an influence on his 1995 film ''[[Death and the Maiden (film)|Death and the Maiden]]''.{{sfn|Cronin|2005|p=167}} The success of ''Schindler's List'' led filmmaker [[Stanley Kubrick]] to abandon his own Holocaust project, ''[[Wartime Lies|Aryan Papers]]'', which would have been about a Jewish boy and his aunt who survive the war by sneaking through Poland while pretending to be Catholic.{{sfn|Goldman|2005}} According to scriptwriter [[Frederic Raphael]], when he suggested to Kubrick that ''Schindler's List'' was a good representation of the Holocaust, Kubrick commented, \"Think that's about the Holocaust? That was about success, wasn't it? The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. ''Schindler's List'' is about 600 who don't.\"{{sfn|Goldman|2005}}{{efn|Schindler is actually credited with saving more than 1,200 Jews.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8578020/Mietek-Pemper.html|title=Mietek Pemper: Obituary|date=June 15, 2011|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=March 16, 2016}}</ref>}}\n\nFilmmaker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] accused Spielberg of using the film to make a profit out of a tragedy while Schindler's wife, [[Emilie Schindler]], lived in poverty in [[Argentina]].{{sfn|Ebert|2002}} Keneally disputed claims that she was never paid for her contributions, \"not least because I had recently sent Emilie a check myself.\"{{sfn|Keneally|2007|p=265}} He also confirmed with Spielberg's office that payment had been sent from there.{{sfn|Keneally|2007|p=265}} Filmmaker [[Michael Haneke]] criticized the sequence in which Schindler's women are accidentally sent off to Auschwitz and herded into showers: \"There's a scene in that film when we don't know if there's gas or water coming out in the showers in the camp. You can only do something like that with a naive audience like in the United States. It's not an appropriate use of the form. Spielberg meant well \u2013 but it was dumb.\"{{sfn|Haneke|2009}}\n\nThe film was criticized by filmmaker and lecturer [[Claude Lanzmann]], director of the nine-hour Holocaust film [[Shoah (film)|''Shoah'']], who called ''Schindler's List'' a \"kitschy melodrama\" and a \"deformation\" of historical truth. \"Fiction is a transgression, I am deeply convinced that there is a ban on depiction [of the Holocaust]\", he said. Lanzmann also criticized Spielberg for viewing the Holocaust through the eyes of a German, saying \"it is the world in reverse.\" He complained, \"I sincerely thought that there was a time before ''Shoah'', and a time after ''Shoah'', and that after ''Shoah'' certain things could no longer be done. Spielberg did them anyway.\"{{sfn|Lanzmann|2007}}\n\n=== Reaction of the Jewish community ===\nAt a 1994 ''[[Village Voice]]'' symposium about the film, historian Annette Insdorf described how her mother, a survivor of three concentration camps, felt gratitude that the Holocaust story was finally being told in a major film that would be widely viewed.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|pp=136\u2013137}} [[Hungarian Jews|Hungarian Jewish]] author [[Imre Kert\u00e9sz]], a Holocaust survivor, feels it is impossible for life in a Nazi concentration camp to be accurately portrayed by anyone who did not experience it first-hand. While commending Spielberg for bringing the story to a wide audience, he found the film's final scene at the graveyard neglected the terrible after-effects of the experience on the survivors and implied that they came through emotionally unscathed.{{sfn|Kert\u00e9sz|2001}} Rabbi [[Uri D. Herscher]] found the film an \"appealing\" and \"uplifting\" demonstration of humanitarianism.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=440}} Norbert Friedman noted that, like many Holocaust survivors, he reacted with a feeling of solidarity towards Spielberg of a sort normally reserved for other survivors.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=136}} [[Albert L. Lewis]], Spielberg's childhood rabbi and teacher, described the movie as \"Steven's gift to his mother, to his people, and in a sense to himself. Now he is a full human being.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=440}}\n\n=== Accolades ===\n''Schindler's List'' featured on a number of \"best of\" lists, including the ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine's Top Hundred as selected by critics [[Richard Corliss]] and [[Richard Schickel]],{{sfn|Corliss|Schickel|2005}} ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine's 100 Greatest Films Centenary Poll conducted in 1995,{{sfn|''Time Out'' Film Guide|1995}} and Leonard Maltin's \"100 Must See Movies of the Century\".{{sfn|Maltin|1999}} The [[Holy See|Vatican]] named ''Schindler's List'' among the most important 45 films ever made.{{sfn|Greydanus|1995}} A [[Channel 4]] poll named ''Schindler's List'' the ninth greatest film of all time,{{sfn|Channel 4|2008}} and it ranked fourth in their 2005 war films poll.{{sfn|Channel 4|2005}} The film was named the best of 1993 by critics such as [[James Berardinelli]],{{sfn|Berardinelli|1993}} Roger Ebert,{{sfn|Ebert|1993b}} and [[Gene Siskel]].{{sfn|Johnson|2011}} Deeming the film \"culturally significant\", the [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2004.{{sfn|Library of Congress|2004}} Spielberg won the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]] for his work,{{sfn|CBC|2013}} and shared the [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]] with co-producers Branko Lustig and Gerald R.

The telecast was the first to receive a TV-M (now [[TV-MA]]) rating under the [[Television content rating systems|TV Parental Guidelines]] that had been established earlier that year.{{sfn|Chuang|1997}} [[Tom Coburn]], then an [[Oklahoma]] congressman, said that in airing the film, NBC had brought television \"to an all-time low, with full-frontal nudity, violence and profanity\", adding that it was an insult to \"decent-minded individuals everywhere\".{{sfn|''Chicago Tribune''|1997}} Under fire from both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], Coburn apologized, saying, \"My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone about saying what I wanted to say.\" He clarified his opinion, stating that the film ought to have been aired later at night when there would not be \"large numbers of children watching without parental supervision\".{{sfn|CNN|1997}}\n\nControversy arose in Germany for the film's television premiere on [[ProSieben]]. Protests among the Jewish community ensued when the station intended to televise it with two commercial breaks of 3\u20134 minutes each. [[Ignatz Bubis]], head of the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]], said: \"It is problematic to interrupt such a movie by commercials\".{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}} Jerzy Kanal, chairman of the Jewish Community of Berlin, added \"It is obvious that the film could have a greater impact [on society] when broadcast unimpeded by commercials. The station has to do everything possible to broadcast the film without interruption.\"{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}} As a compromise, the broadcast included one break consisting of a short news update framed with commercials. [[ProSieben]] was also obliged to broadcast two accompanying documentaries to the film, showing \"The daily lives of the Jews in Hebron and New York\" prior to broadcast and \"The survivors of the Holocaust\" afterwards.{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}}\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], chief censor Henrietta Mendez ordered cuts of three scenes depicting [[sexual intercourse]] and female nudity before the movie could be shown in theaters. Spielberg refused, and pulled the film from screening in Philippine cinemas, which prompted the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] to demand the abolition of the censorship board. [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]] himself intervened, ruling that the movie could be shown uncut to anyone over the age of 15.{{sfn|Branigin|1994}}\n\nAccording to [[Slovak people|Slovak]] filmmaker [[Juraj Herz]], the scene in which a group of women confuse an actual shower with a gas chamber is taken directly, shot by shot, from his film ''Zastihla m\u011b noc'' (''Night Caught Up with Me'', 1986). Herz wanted to sue, but was unable to fund the case.{{sfn|Kosulicova|2002}}\n\nThe song ''Yerushalayim Shel Zahav'' (\"[[Jerusalem of Gold]]\") is featured in the film's soundtrack and plays near the end of the film. This caused some controversy in Israel, as the song (which was written in 1967 by [[Naomi Shemer]]) is widely considered an informal anthem of the Israeli victory in the [[Six-Day War]]. In Israeli prints of the film the song was replaced with ''Halikha LeKesariya'' (\"A Walk to Caesarea\") by [[Hannah Szenes]], a World War II resistance fighter.{{sfn|Bresheeth|1997|p=205}}\n\n== Effect on Krak\u00f3w ==\nDue to the increased interest in Krak\u00f3w created by the film, the city bought [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory]] in 2007 to create a permanent exhibition about the German occupation of the city from 1939 to 1945. The museum opened in June 2010.{{sfn|Pavo Travel|2014}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[1993 in film]]\n* [[List of Holocaust films]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist\n| notes =\n{{efn\n| name = Score\n| Williams
