One of the oldest records of what may have been an encounter with smallpox in Africa is associated with the [[Year of the Elephant|elephant war]] circa AD 568, when after fighting a siege in Mecca, Ethiopian troops contracted the disease which they carried with them back to Africa. Arab ports in Coastal towns in Africa likely contributed to the importation of smallpox into Africa, as early as the 13th century, though no records exist until the 16th century. Upon invasion of these towns by tribes in the interior of Africa, a severe epidemic affected all African inhabitants while sparing the Portuguese. Densely populated areas of Africa connected to the Mediterranean, Nubia and Ethiopia by caravan route likely were affected by smallpox since the 11th century, though written records do not appear until the introduction of the slave trade in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Fenner1\"/>\n\nThe [[enslavement]] of Africans continued to spread smallpox to the entire continent, with raiders pushing farther inland along caravan routes in search of people to enslave. The effects of smallpox could be seen along caravan routes, and those who were not affected along the routes were still likely to become infected either waiting to be put onboard or on board ships.<ref name=\"Fenner1\" />\n\nSmallpox in Angola was likely introduced shortly after Portuguese settlement of the area in 1484. The 1864 epidemic killed 25,000 inhabitants, one third of the total population in that same area. In 1713, an outbreak occurred in South Africa after a ship from India docked at Cape Town, bringing infected laundry ashore. Many of the settler [[Demographics of Europe|European]] population suffered, and whole clans of the [[Khoisan]] people were wiped out. A second outbreak occurred in 1755, again affecting both the [[white]] population and the Khoisan. The disease spread further, completely eradicating several Khosian clans, all the way to the Kalahari desert. A third outbreak in 1767 similarly affected the Khoisan and Bantu peoples. But the European [[Colony|colonial]] [[settlers]] were not affected nearly to the extent that they were in the first two outbreaks, it has been speculated this is because of [[variolation]]. Continued [[enslavement]] operations brought smallpox to Cape Town again in 1840, taking the lives of 2500 people, and then to Uganda in the 1840s. It is estimated that up to eighty percent of the [[Griqua people|Griqua]] tribe was exterminated by smallpox in 1831, and whole tribes were being wiped out in Kenya up until 1899. Along the Zaire river basin were areas where no one survived the epidemics, leaving the land devoid of human life. In Ethiopia and the Sudan, six epidemics are recorded for the 19th century: 1811\u20131813, 1838\u20131839, 1865\u20131866, 1878\u20131879, 1885\u20131887, and 1889\u20131890.<ref name=\"who\">Fenner, Frank, Donald A.

In populations of railroad and migrant workers who traveled from city to city the disease had reached an endemic low boil.  This fact did not bother the government at the time, nor did it spur them to action.  Despite the general acceptance of the [[germ theory of disease]], pioneered by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] in 1849, smallpox was still thought to be mostly a malady that followed the less-distinct guidelines of a \"filth\" disease, and therefore would only affect the \"lower classes\".<ref>Willrich, Michael (2011).

In response to this belief, the city instructed teams of physicians to vaccinate anyone living in inexpensive housing.\n\nIn an effort to control the outbreak, the [[Boston Public Health Commission|Boston Board of Health]] began voluntary vaccination programs. Individuals could receive free vaccines at their\nwork places or at different stations set up throughout the city. By the end 1901, some 40,000 of the city\u2019s residents had received a smallpox vaccine. However, despite the city's efforts, the epidemic continued to grow. In January 1902, a door-to-door vaccination program was initiated. Health officials were instructed to compel individuals to receive vaccination, pay a $5 fine, or be faced with 15 days in prison. This door-to-door program was met by some resistance as some individuals feared the vaccines to be unsafe and ineffective. Others felt compulsory vaccination in itself was a problem that violated an individual's civil liberties.\n\nThis program of compulsory vaccination eventually led to the famous [[Jacobson v. Massachusetts]] case. The case was the result of a [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] resident's refusal to be vaccinated. Henning Jacobsen, a Swedish immigrant, refused vaccination out of fear it would cause him illness. He claimed a previous smallpox vaccine had made him sick as a child. Rather than pay the five dollar fine, he challenged the state's authority on forcing people to receive vaccination. His case was lost at the state level, but Jacobson appealed the ruling, and so, the case was taken up by the Supreme Court. In 1905 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] upheld the Massachusetts law: it was ruled Jacobson could not refuse the mandatory vaccination.<ref name=\"nejm.org\"/>\n\nIn Canada, between 1702 and 1703, nearly a quarter of the population of Quebec city died due to a smallpox epidemic.<ref name=\"who\" />\n\n==Pacific epidemics==\n\n===Island South East Asia===\nThere is evidence that smallpox reached the [[Philippine islands]] from the 4th century onwards \u2013 linked possibly to [[History of Indian influence on Southeast Asia|contact between South East Asians and Indian traders]].<ref name=\"king\">Victor T.

Thought to have been discovered by accident, it became known that those who contracted smallpox through a break in the skin in which smallpox matter was inserted received a less severe reaction than those who contracted it naturally. This realization led to the practice of purposely infecting people with matter from smallpox scabs in order to protect them later from a more severe reaction. This practice, known today as [[variolation]], was first practiced in China in the 10th century.<ref name=\"who\" /> Methods of carrying out the procedure varied depending upon location. Variolation was the sole method of protection against smallpox other than quarantine until Jenner's discovery of the inoculating abilities of [[cowpox]] against the smallpox virus in 1796. Efforts to protect populations against smallpox by way of vaccination followed for centuries after Jenner's discovery. Smallpox has since been completely eradicated since 1979, because of the mass vaccination efforts of the World Health Organization.\n\n===Variolation===\n{{Main|Variolation}}\nThe word variolation is synonymous with inoculation, insertion, en-grafting, or transplantation. The term is used to define insertion of smallpox matter, and distinguishes this procedure from vaccination, where cowpox matter was used to obtain a much milder reaction among patients.<ref name=\"who\" />\n\n====Asia====\nThe practice of [[variolation]] (also known as [[inoculation]]) first came out of East Asia.<ref name=\"U.S. National Library of Medicine.\">U.S. National Library of Medicine. \"Variolation\".

Scabs from smallpox victims who had the disease in its mild form would be selected, and the powder was kept close to body temperature by means of keeping it close to the chest, killing the majority of the virus and resulting in a more mild case of smallpox.<ref name=\"glynn\" /> Scabs were generally used when a month old, but could be used more quickly in hot weather (15\u201320 days), and slower in winter (50 days). The process was carried out by taking eight smallpox scabs and crushing them in a mortar with two grains of ''[[Uvularia grandiflora]]'' in a mortar.<ref name=\"who\" /> The powder was administered nasally through a silver tube that was curved at its point, through the right nostril for boys and the left nostril for girls.<ref name=\"glynn\" /> A week after the procedure, those variolated would start to produce symptoms of smallpox, and recovery was guaranteed. In India, where the European colonizers came across variolation in the 17th century, a large, sharp needle was dipped into the pus collected from mature smallpox sores. Several punctures with this needle were made either below the deltoid muscle or in the forehead, and then were covered with a paste made from boiled rice.<ref name=\"glynn\" />  Variolation spread farther from India to other countries in south west Asia, and then to the Balkans.<ref name=\"who\" />\n\n====Europe====\n[[File:Lady Mary Wortley Montagu with her son Edward by Jean Baptiste Vanmour.jpg|thumb|[[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] with her son, Edward Wortley Montagu, who was variolated in March, 1718 by Dr. Charles Maitland<ref name=\"killer\" />]]\n\nIn 1713, [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]]'s brother died of smallpox; she too contracted the virus two years later at the age of twenty-six, leaving her badly scarred.<ref name=\"montagu\">{{cite journal |author1=Case Christine L |author2=Chung King Thom | year = 1997 | title = Montagu and Jenner: The Campaign Against Smallpox | url = | journal = SIM News | volume = 47 | issue = 2| pages = 58\u201360 }}</ref> When her husband was made ambassador to [[Ottoman Empire]], she accompanied him to Constantinople.

On average, it took a month to fully recover from the encounter with smallpox combined with weakness from the preceding starvation.<ref name=\"fire\" />\n\nAt the age of thirteen, Jenner was sent to study medicine in [[Chipping Sodbury]] with [[Daniel Ludlow]], a surgeon and apothecary, from 1762 to 1770<ref name=\"montagu\" /><ref name=\"country doctor\" /><ref name=\"UCLA\">The UCLA Louise M.

This research was slow going as Jenner often had to wait months or even years before cases of cowpox would again return to the Gloucestershire area.<ref name=\"fire\" /> During his study, he found that cowpox was actually several diseases that were similar in nature but were distinguishable through slight differences, and that not all versions had the capacity to make one immune from smallpox upon contraction.<ref name=\"montagu\" />\n\nThrough his study, he incorrectly deduced that smallpox and cowpox were all the same disease, simply manifesting themselves differently in different animals, eventually setting back his research and making it difficult to publish his findings. Though Jenner had seen cases of people becoming immune to smallpox after having cowpox, too many exceptions of people still contracting smallpox after having had cowpox were arising. Jenner was missing crucial information which he later discovered in 1796.<ref name=\"fire\" /> Jenner hypothesized that in order to become immune to smallpox using cowpox, the matter from the cowpox pustules must be administered at maximum potency; else it was too weak to be effective in creating immunity to smallpox. He deduced that cowpox was most likely to transfer immunity from smallpox if administered at the eighth day of the disease.<ref name=\"montagu\" />\n\nOn May 14, 1796, he performed an experiment in which he took pus from a sore of a cowpox-infected milkmaid named Sarah Nelmes, and applied it to a few small scratches on the arm of an eight-year-old boy who had never before contracted either smallpox or cowpox, named [[James Phipps]]. Phipps recovered as expected.<ref name=\"montagu\" /> Two months later, Jenner repeated the procedure using matter from smallpox, observing no effect. Phipps became the first person to become immune to smallpox without ever actually having the disease. He was variolated many more times over the course of his life to prove his immunity.<ref name=\"fire\" />\n\nWhen the next cowpox epidemic broke out in 1798, Jenner conducted a series of inoculations using cowpox, all of them successful<ref name=\"montagu\" /> except on his own son Robert.<ref name=\"fire\" /> Because his findings were revolutionary and lacked in evidence, the [[Royal Society]] (of which Jenner was a member) refused to publish his findings.<ref name=\"fire\" /> Jenner then rode to London and had his book ''An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variol\u00e6 Vaccin\u00e6'' published by Sampson Low\u2019s firm<ref name=\"country doctor\" /> in June 1798.<ref name=\"french\">{{cite journal | author = Meynell Elinor | year = 1995 | title = French Reactions to Jenner's Discovery of Smallpox Vaccination: The Primary Sources | doi = 10.1093/shm/8.2.285 | journal = Social History of Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 285\u2013303| pmid=11639810}}</ref> The book was an instant bestseller among the elite in London salons, in the medical establishment and among the ladies and gentlemen of the enlightenment.<ref name=\"fire\" />\n\nKnowledge of the ability of cowpox to provide immunity from smallpox was present in England before Jenner's discovery. In 1774, a cattle dealer named [[Benjamin Jesty]] had successfully inoculated his wife and three sons using cowpox. This was before Jenner discovered the immunization capabilities of cowpox.<ref name=\"macnalty\" /> However, Jesty simply performed the procedure; he did not take the discovery any further by inoculating his family with smallpox matter to see if there would be a reaction or perform any other trials.<ref name=\"glynn\" /> Jenner was the first to prove the effectiveness of vaccination with cowpox using scientific experimentation.<ref name=\"fire\" />\n\n====United States of America====\n[[Benjamin Franklin]], who had lost his own son to smallpox in 1736, made the suggestion to create a pamphlet to distribute to families explaining how to inoculate their children themselves, so as to eliminate cost as the factor in the decision to choose to inoculate children. [[William Heberden]], a friend of Franklin's and an English physician, followed through with Franklin's idea, printing 2000 pamphlets in 1759 which were distributed by Franklin in America.<ref name=\"glynn\" />\n\nAn American physician, [[John Kirkpatrick (physician)|John Kirkpatrick]], upon his visit to London in 1743, told of an instance where variolation stopped an epidemic in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in 1738,<ref name=\"kirkpatrick\">McCandless, Peter. ''Slavery, Disease, and Suffering in the Southern Lowcountry.'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 2011</ref> where 800 people were inoculated and only eight deaths occurred.<ref name=\"glynn\" /> His account of the success of variolation in Charleston helped to play a role in the revival of its practice in London. Kirkpatrick also advocated inoculating patients with matter from the sores of another inoculated person, instead of using matter from the sore of a smallpox victim, a procedure that Maitland had been using since 1722.<ref name=\"killer\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n\n* {{cite book |author=Clendening, Logan|chapter=Chapter XXVII.

One of the oldest records of what may have been an encounter with smallpox in Africa is associated with the [[Year of the Elephant|elephant war]] circa AD 568, when after fighting a siege in Mecca, Ethiopian troops contracted the disease which they carried with them back to Africa. Arab ports in Coastal towns in Africa likely contributed to the importation of smallpox into Africa, as early as the 13th century, though no records exist until the 16th century. Upon invasion of these towns by tribes in the interior of Africa, a severe epidemic affected all African inhabitants while sparing the Portuguese. Densely populated areas of Africa connected to the Mediterranean, Nubia and Ethiopia by caravan route likely were affected by smallpox since the 11th century, though written records do not appear until the introduction of the slave trade in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Fenner1\"/>\n\nThe [[enslavement]] of Africans continued to spread smallpox to the entire continent, with raiders pushing farther inland along caravan routes in search of people to enslave. The effects of smallpox could be seen along caravan routes, and those who were not affected along the routes were still likely to become infected either waiting to be put onboard or on board ships.<ref name=\"Fenner1\" />\n\nSmallpox in Angola was likely introduced shortly after Portuguese settlement of the area in 1484. The 1864 epidemic killed 25,000 inhabitants, one third of the total population in that same area. In 1713, an outbreak occurred in South Africa after a ship from India docked at Cape Town, bringing infected laundry ashore. Many of the settler [[Demographics of Europe|European]] population suffered, and whole clans of the [[Khoisan]] people were wiped out. A second outbreak occurred in 1755, again affecting both the [[white]] population and the Khoisan. The disease spread further, completely eradicating several Khosian clans, all the way to the Kalahari desert. A third outbreak in 1767 similarly affected the Khoisan and Bantu peoples. But the European [[colonial]] [[settlers]] were not affected nearly to the extent that they were in the first two outbreaks, it has been speculated this is because of [[variolation]]. Continued [[enslavement]] operations brought smallpox to Cape Town again in 1840, taking the lives of 2500 people, and then to Uganda in the 1840s. It is estimated that up to eighty percent of the [[Griqua people|Griqua]] tribe was exterminated by smallpox in 1831, and whole tribes were being wiped out in Kenya up until 1899. Along the Zaire river basin were areas where no one survived the epidemics, leaving the land devoid of human life. In Ethiopia and the Sudan, six epidemics are recorded for the 19th century: 1811\u20131813, 1838\u20131839, 1865\u20131866, 1878\u20131879, 1885\u20131887, and 1889\u20131890.<ref name=\"who\">Fenner, Frank, Donald A.

In populations of railroad and migrant workers who traveled from city to city the disease had reached an endemic low boil.  This fact did not bother the government at the time, nor did it spur them to action.  Despite the general acceptance of the [[germ theory of disease]], pioneered by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] in 1849, smallpox was still thought to be mostly a malady that followed the less-distinct guidelines of a \"filth\" disease, and therefore would only affect the \"lower classes\".<ref>Willrich, Michael (2011).

In response to this belief, the city instructed teams of physicians to vaccinate anyone living in inexpensive housing.\n\nIn an effort to control the outbreak, the [[Boston Public Health Commission|Boston Board of Health]] began voluntary vaccination programs. Individuals could receive free vaccines at their\nwork places or at different stations set up throughout the city. By the end 1901, some 40,000 of the city\u2019s residents had received a smallpox vaccine. However, despite the city's efforts, the epidemic continued to grow. In January 1902, a door-to-door vaccination program was initiated. Health officials were instructed to compel individuals to receive vaccination, pay a $5 fine, or be faced with 15 days in prison. This door-to-door program was met by some resistance as some individuals feared the vaccines to be unsafe and ineffective. Others felt compulsory vaccination in itself was a problem that violated an individual's civil liberties.\n\nThis program of compulsory vaccination eventually led to the famous [[Jacobson v. Massachusetts]] case. The case was the result of a [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] resident's refusal to be vaccinated. Henning Jacobsen, a Swedish immigrant, refused vaccination out of fear it would cause him illness. He claimed a previous smallpox vaccine had made him sick as a child. Rather than pay the five dollar fine, he challenged the state's authority on forcing people to receive vaccination. His case was lost at the state level, but Jacobson appealed the ruling, and so, the case was taken up by the Supreme Court.

Thought to have been discovered by accident, it became known that those who contracted smallpox through a break in the skin in which smallpox matter was inserted received a less severe reaction than those who contracted it naturally. This realization led to the practice of purposely infecting people with matter from smallpox scabs in order to protect them later from a more severe reaction. This practice, known today as [[variolation]], was first practiced in China in the 10th century.<ref name=\"who\" /> Methods of carrying out the procedure varied depending upon location. Variolation was the sole method of protection against smallpox other than quarantine until Jenner's discovery of the inoculating abilities of [[cowpox]] against the smallpox virus in 1796. Efforts to protect populations against smallpox by way of vaccination followed for centuries after Jenner's discovery. Smallpox has since been completely eradicated since 1979, because of the mass vaccination efforts of the World Health Organization.\n\n===Variolation===\n{{Main|Variolation}}\nThe word variolation is synonymous with inoculation, insertion, en-grafting, or transplantation.

Scabs from smallpox victims who had the disease in its mild form would be selected, and the powder was kept close to body temperature by means of keeping it close to the chest, killing the majority of the virus and resulting in a more mild case of smallpox.<ref name=\"glynn\" /> Scabs were generally used when a month old, but could be used more quickly in hot weather (15\u201320 days), and slower in winter (50 days). The process was carried out by taking eight smallpox scabs and crushing them in a mortar with two grains of ''[[Uvularia grandiflora]]'' in a mortar.<ref name=\"who\" /> The powder was administered nasally through a silver tube that was curved at its point, through the right nostril for boys and the left nostril for girls.<ref name=\"glynn\" /> A week after the procedure, those variolated would start to produce symptoms of smallpox, and recovery was guaranteed. In India, where the European colonizers came across variolation in the 17th century, a large, sharp needle was dipped into the pus collected from mature smallpox sores. Several punctures with this needle were made either below the deltoid muscle or in the forehead, and then were covered with a paste made from boiled rice.<ref name=\"glynn\" />  Variolation spread farther from India to other countries in south west Asia, and then to the Balkans.<ref name=\"who\" />\n\n====Europe====\n[[File:Lady Mary Wortley Montagu with her son Edward by Jean Baptiste Vanmour.jpg|thumb|[[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] with her son, Edward Wortley Montagu, who was variolated in March, 1718 by Dr. Charles Maitland<ref name=\"killer\" />]]\n\nIn 1713, [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]]'s brother died of smallpox; she too contracted the virus two years later at the age of twenty-six, leaving her badly scarred.<ref name=\"montagu\">{{cite journal |author1=Case Christine L |author2=Chung King Thom | year = 1997 | title = Montagu and Jenner: The Campaign Against Smallpox | url = | journal = SIM News | volume = 47 | issue = 2| pages = 58\u201360 }}</ref> When her husband was made ambassador to [[Ottoman Empire]], she accompanied him to Constantinople.

This research was slow going as Jenner often had to wait months or even years before cases of cowpox would again return to the Gloucestershire area.<ref name=\"fire\" /> During his study, he found that cowpox was actually several diseases that were similar in nature but were distinguishable through slight differences, and that not all versions had the capacity to make one immune from smallpox upon contraction.<ref name=\"montagu\" />\n\nThrough his study, he incorrectly deduced that smallpox and cowpox were all the same disease, simply manifesting themselves differently in different animals, eventually setting back his research and making it difficult to publish his findings. Though Jenner had seen cases of people becoming immune to smallpox after having cowpox, too many exceptions of people still contracting smallpox after having had cowpox were arising. Jenner was missing crucial information which he later discovered in 1796.<ref name=\"fire\" /> Jenner hypothesized that in order to become immune to smallpox using cowpox, the matter from the cowpox pustules must be administered at maximum potency; else it was too weak to be effective in creating immunity to smallpox. He deduced that cowpox was most likely to transfer immunity from smallpox if administered at the eighth day of the disease.<ref name=\"montagu\" />\n\nOn May 14, 1796, he performed an experiment in which he took pus from a sore of a cowpox-infected milkmaid named Sarah Nelmes, and applied it to a few small scratches on the arm of an eight-year-old boy who had never before contracted either smallpox or cowpox, named [[James Phipps]]. Phipps recovered as expected.<ref name=\"montagu\" /> Two months later, Jenner repeated the procedure using matter from smallpox, observing no effect. Phipps became the first person to become immune to smallpox without ever actually having the disease.

[[William Heberden]], a friend of Franklin's and an English physician, followed through with Franklin's idea, printing 2000 pamphlets in 1759 which were distributed by Franklin in America.<ref name=\"glynn\" />\n\nAn American physician, [[John Kirkpatrick (physician)|John Kirkpatrick]], upon his visit to London in 1743, told of an instance where variolation stopped an epidemic in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in 1738,<ref name=\"kirkpatrick\">McCandless, Peter. ''Slavery, Disease, and Suffering in the Southern Lowcountry.'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 2011</ref> where 800 people were inoculated and only eight deaths occurred.<ref name=\"glynn\" /> His account of the success of variolation in Charleston helped to play a role in the revival of its practice in London. Kirkpatrick also advocated inoculating patients with matter from the sores of another inoculated person, instead of using matter from the sore of a smallpox victim, a procedure that Maitland had been using since 1722.<ref name=\"killer\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n\n* {{cite book |author=Clendening, Logan|chapter=Chapter XXVII.

The Milano-Laghi motorway, connecting [[Milan]] to [[Varese]] and now parts of the [[Autostrada A8 (Italy)|A8]] and [[Autostrada A9 (Italy)|A9]] motorways, was devised by Piero Puricelli, a civil engineer and entrepreneur. He received the first authorization to build a public-utility fast road in 1921, and completed the construction between 1924 and 1926. By the end of the 1930s, over 400 kilometers of multi- and dual-single-lane motorways were constructed throughout Italy, linking cities and rural towns. Today there are 668,721&nbsp;km of serviceable roads in Italy, including 6,661&nbsp;km of motorways (mostly [[toll road]]s, national and local roads), state-owned but privately operated mainly by [[Atlantia (company)|Atlantia]] company.\n\nThe railway network is also extensive, especially in the north, totalizing 16,862&nbsp;km of which 69% are electrified and on which 4,937 locomotives and railcars circulate. It is the [[List of countries by rail transport network size|12th largest in the world]], and is operated by state-owned [[Ferrovie dello Stato]], while the [[rail tracks]] and infrastructure are managed by [[Rete Ferroviaria Italiana]]. While a number of private railroads exist and provide mostly [[Commuter rail|commuter-type]] services, the national railway also provides sophisticated [[High-speed rail in Italy|high-speed rail]] service that joins the major cities. The [[Florence\u2013Rome high-speed railway]] was the first high-speed line opened in [[Europe]] when more than half of it opened in 1977. In 1991 the [[Treno Alta Velocit\u00e0|TAV]] was created for the planning and construction of [[high-speed rail]] lines along Italy's most important and saturated transport routes (Milan-Rome-Naples and Turin-Milan-Venice). High-speed trains include [[ElettroTreno|ETR]]-class trains, with the [[Frecciarossa 1000]] reaching 400&nbsp;km/h.\n\nThere are approximately [[List of airports in Italy|130 airports in Italy]], of which 99 have paved runways (including the two [[Airline hub|hubs]] of [[Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport|Leonardo Da Vinci International]] in Rome and [[Malpensa International Airport|Malpensa International]] in Milan), and 43 major seaports including the [[Port of Genoa]], the country's largest and the [[List of busiest ports in Europe|third busiest by cargo tonnage]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

The Milano-Laghi motorway, connecting [[Milan]] to [[Varese]] and now parts of the [[Autostrada A8 (Italy)|A8]] and [[Autostrada A9 (Italy)|A9]] motorways, was devised by Piero Puricelli, a civil engineer and entrepreneur. He received the first authorization to build a public-utility fast road in 1921, and completed the construction between 1924 and 1926. By the end of the 1930s, over 400 kilometers of multi- and dual-single-lane motorways were constructed throughout Italy, linking cities and rural towns. Today there are 668,721&nbsp;km of serviceable roads in Italy, including 6,661&nbsp;km of motorways (mostly [[toll road]]s, national and local roads), state-owned but privately operated mainly by [[Atlantia (company)|Atlantia]] company.\n\nThe railway network is also extensive, especially in the north, totalizing 16,862&nbsp;km of which 69% are electrified and on which 4,937 locomotives and railcars circulate. It is the [[List of countries by rail transport network size|12th largest in the world]], and is operated by state-owned [[Ferrovie dello Stato]], while the [[rail tracks]] and infrastructure are managed by [[Rete Ferroviaria Italiana]]. While a number of private railroads exist and provide mostly [[Commuter rail|commuter-type]] services, the national railway also provides sophisticated [[High-speed rail in Italy|high-speed rail]] service that joins the major cities. The [[Florence\u2013Rome high-speed railway]] was the first high-speed line opened in [[Europe]] when more than half of it opened in 1977. In 1991 the [[Treno Alta Velocit\u00e0|TAV]] was created for the planning and construction of [[high-speed rail]] lines along Italy's most important and saturated transport routes (Milan-Rome-Naples and Turin-Milan-Venice). High-speed trains include [[ElettroTreno|ETR]]-class trains, with the [[Frecciarossa 1000]] reaching 400&nbsp;km/h.\n\nThere are approximately [[List of airports in Italy|130 airports in Italy]], of which 99 have paved runways (including the two [[Airline hub|hubs]] of [[Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport|Leonardo Da Vinci International]] in Rome and [[Malpensa International Airport|Malpensa International]] in Milan), and 43 major seaports including the [[Port of Genoa]], the country's largest and the [[List of busiest ports in Europe|third busiest by cargo tonnage]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

Most of the route is currently used for other lines, such as [[Melbourne tram route 109|Route 109]] between St Vincents Plaza and North Richmond Station and [[Melbourne tram route 57|Route 57]] between Errol Street and Elizabeth Street. Tram tracks currently exist on some sections of Victoria St, but are unused and in disrepair. The Rail Futures Institute proposed similar routes along Victoria Street/Parade in 2018.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== New Port Melbourne to St Kilda route ===\n[[File:Proposed beaconsfield tram route.gif|thumb|right|Proposed Beaconsfield Parade St Kilda-Port Melbourne route]]\nA 5&nbsp;km tram link between St Kilda and Port Melbourne along Beaconsfield Parade was first proposed in 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/13/1097607297345.html?from=storylhs |title=Rattling good vistas guaranteed - National |website=Theage.com.au |date= |accessdate=2017-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/24/1098556292410.html?from=storylhs |title=Cable car option for beachside transport - National |website=Theage.com.au |date= |accessdate=2017-02-27}}</ref> subsequently promoted by the City of Port Phillip in 2005<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/17/1097951553785.html?from=storylhs |title=Hailing a tram by the bayside - Editorial |website=Theage.com.au |date=2004-10-18 |accessdate=2017-02-27}}</ref> and backed by Tourism Victoria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.vic.gov.au/images/stories/Documents/About_Us/concept-proposals-for-tourism-development-in-victoria.pdf |title=TOVI20853-Infrastructure2.indd |website=Tourism.vic.gov.au |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-02-27}}</ref> A 2007 feasibility study<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018071354/http://portphillip.vic.gov.au/default/o22296.pdf|title=Strategy and Policy Review Committee: St Kilda to Port Melbourne Foreshore Transport Link Scoping and Feasibility Study|last=City of Port Philip|date=December 2006|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref> into the route found that the high density population could sustain around 200,000 annual commuter trips and that a \"shuttle tram\" between the two bayside suburbs would be financially viable if patrons were charged $6 per one-way trip.<ref>{{cite news\n| title=Beach tram to sting tourists $6 a ride\n| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/beach-ride-for-6/2006/12/13/1165685725428.html\n| first=Stephen\n| last=Moynihan\n| publisher=The Age\n| date=13 December 2006\n| accessdate=5 March 2007\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Trams in Melbourne]]\n* [[Proposed Melbourne rail extensions]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Transport in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Proposed public transport in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "RTS100", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_Melbourne_tram_extensions"}
