Created by [[\u00c1lex Pina]], the series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. [[Netflix]] acquired the global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, has been released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled ''Money Heist: The Phenomenon''.\n\nThe first two parts revolve around a long-prepared, multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]], in which a group of robbers take hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion. It involves eight robbers, code-named after cities and led by the Professor ([[\u00c1lvaro Morte]]) from an external location. The story is primarily focused on one of the robbers, Tokyo ([[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]]), as they battle with hostages on the inside and the police on the outside. In the third part, the surviving robbers are forced out of hiding, and with the help of new members, they plan and perform an assault on the [[Bank of Spain]].\n\nThe series was filmed in Madrid, Spain. Significant portions of part 3 were also filmed in [[Panama]], [[Thailand]] and [[Florence]], Italy. The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations and an unreliable narrator for complexity. The series subverts the heist genre by being told from the perspective of a woman (Tokyo) and having a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity, where emotional dynamics offset the perfect strategic crime.\n\nThe series received critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song \"[[Bella ciao]]\", which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /> with a particular resonance coming from viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin world.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception and writing ===\n\n{{further|#Themes and analysis}}\n\n{{Quote box |title= |quote=\"We wanted to make a

After a brief outline of the planned heist, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]]. The eight robbers are code-named after cities: Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki and Oslo. Dressed in red jumpsuits with a mask of the Spanish painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], the group of robbers take 67 hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion through a self-built escape tunnel. The Professor heads the heist from an external location. Flashbacks throughout the series show the five months of preparation in an abandoned hunting estate in the [[Province of Toledo|Toledo]] countryside; the robbers are not to share personal information nor engage in personal relationships, and the assault shall be without bloodshed.\n\nThroughout parts 1 and 2, the robbers inside the Mint have difficulties sticking to the pre-defined rules, and face uncooperative hostages, violence, isolation, and mutiny. Tokyo commentates the events through [[voice-over]]s. While Denver pursues a love affair with the hostage M\u00f3nica Gaztambide, inspector Raquel Murillo of the [[National Police Corps]] negotiates with the Professor on the outside and begins an intimate relationship with his alter ego \"Salva\". The Professor's identity is repeatedly close to being uncovered, until Raquel realises his true identity, but is emotionally unable and unwilling to hand him over to the police. At the end of part 2, after 128 hours, the robbers escape successfully from the Mint with \u20ac984 million printed, but at the cost of the lives of Oslo, Moscow and Berlin. One year after the heist, Raquel decodes postcards left by the Professor for a location in [[Palawan]] in the Philippines, where she reunites with him.\n\n=== Season 2: Part 3 (2019) and Part 4 (2020) ===\n\nPart 3 begins two to three years after the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations. However, when [[Europol]] captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the [[Bank of Spain]] to force Europol to hand over Rio to prevent his torture. He and Raquel (going by \"Lisbon\") get the gang, including M\u00f3nica (going by \"Stockholm\"), back together and enlist three new members: Bogot\u00e1, Palermo and Marseille, with Palermo in charge. Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different approaches to love. The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets, while the Professor and Lisbon travel in an [[RV]] and then an ambulance while communicating with the robbers and the police. A breach in the bank is thwarted, forcing the police, led by Colonel Luis Tamayo and pregnant inspector Alicia Sierra, to release Rio to the robbers. Nairobi gets gravely injured by a police-inflicted [[sniper]] shot in the chest, and Lisbon is caught by the police. With another police assault on the bank incoming, and believing Lisbon to have been executed by the police, the Professor radios Palermo and declares [[DEFCON 2]] on the police. Part 3 concludes by showing Lisbon alive and in custody, and Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap and that \"the war had begun.\"\n\nPart 4 begins with the robbers rushing to save Nairobi's life, but after Tokyo stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], the ego-centric Palermo is about to walk out of the bank before he is restrained to a chair by the group. With the help of Tokyo, the Professor realises that the police had staged Lisbon's execution. The Professor and Marseille deduce that Lisbon is being interrogated inside a police tent outside of the bank, and persuade Tamayo's assistant, Anto\u00f1anzas, to do tasks for them. As the group manage to save Nairobi's life, Palermo creates chaos to reestablish his command by colluding with Gand\u00eda, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain; he dislocates his thumbs in order to slip through his handcuffs as verbally aided by Palermo. After Rio is emotionally unable to stop Gand\u00eda from escaping, Gand\u00eda nearly kills both Nairobi and Helsinki. Gand\u00eda begins communications with the police from within a [[panic room]] inside the bank. Gand\u00eda captures Tokyo and restrains her in the panic room. Palermo confirms his collusion with Gand\u00eda to the Professor; the Professor assures he will be punished later, and orders the group to unchain him. but after a shootout ensues, he restrains Nairobi and uses her to escape while the group holds him at gunpoint. As he escapes, he shoots Nairobi in the head, killing her instantly\u2014Denver throws a grenade, which injures Gand\u00eda. Back in the panic room, Gand\u00eda unties Tokyo to remove the shrapnel from his back; she knocks him unconscious and the group frees her. As the police ready an assault on the bank, the Professor exposes the unlawful torture of Rio and holding of Lisbon nationally via video, which deflates their plans. Due to this revelation, Sierra is fired and begins a pursuit of the Professor on her own. The Professor enlists Benjam\u00edn, father of Julia (going by \"Manila\" who poses as a hostage), and Moscow's godchild, and his crew to help him in freeing Lisbon from the Supreme Court's parking garage after the [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Ministry of the Interior]] had brought her there to testify. The group forces Gand\u00eda to request a helicopter from the police to be airlifted out from the roof of the bank, but the Professor intercepts the call and brings in his own helicopter that transports and reunites a disguised Lisbon with the group. Part 4 concludes with Sierra finding the Professor's hideout, holding him at gunpoint.\n\n== Themes and analysis ==\n\nThe series was noted for its subversions of the [[heist genre]]. While heist films are usually told with a rational male Anglo-centric focus, the series reframes the heist story by giving it a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity and telling it from a female perspective through Tokyo.<ref name=lavozdeasturias_190126>{{cite web |last=Vidal |first=Mar\u00eda |url=https://www.lavozdeasturias.es/noticia/cultura/2019/01/26/embarcadero-tenia-presion-casa-papel/0003_201901SY26P14991.htm |title=\u00c1lex Pina: \"Con 'El embarcadero' ten\u00eda m\u00e1s presi\u00f3n que con 'La Casa de Papel'\" |language=es |publisher=lavozdeasturias.es |date=4 February 2019 |access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> The producers regarded the cultural identity as an important part of the personality of the series, as it made the story more relatable for viewers.<ref name=xataka_190705>{{cite web |last=Muela |first=Cesar |url=https://www.xataka.com/cine-y-tv/casa-papel-no-hubiera-estado-netflix-seguiriamos-diciendo-que-no-podemos-competir-series-fuera-alex-pina-creador-serie |title=\"Si 'La Casa de Papel' no hubiera estado en Netflix seguir\u00edamos diciendo que no podemos competir con las series de fuera\", \u00c1lex Pina, creador de la serie |publisher=xataka.com |language=es |date=3 July 2019 |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref> They also avoided adapting the series to international tastes,<ref name=xataka_190705 /> which helped to set it apart from the usual American TV series<ref name=elespanol_190724 /> and raised international awareness of Spanish sensibilities.<ref name=xataka_190705 /> Emotional dynamics like the passion and impulsivity of friendship and love offset the perfect strategic crime for increased tension.<ref name=lavozdeasturias_190126 /><ref name=elcomercio_190808>{{cite web |url=https://elcomercio.pe/tvmas/series/casa-papel-temporada-4-fecha-estreno-netflix-parte-4-trailer-historia-pasara-actores-personajes-money-heist-espana-ficha-tv-nnda-nnlt-noticia-650201 |title=\"La casa de papel\", temporada 4: fecha de estreno en Netflix, qu\u00e9 pasar\u00e1, actores, personajes, misterios y teor\u00edas |language=es |publisher=elcomercio.pe |date=10 August 2019 |access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> Nearly all main characters, including the relationship-opposing Professor, eventually succumb to love,<ref name=elespectador_190718>{{cite web |last=Contreras Fajardo |first=Lilian |url=https://www.elespectador.com/entretenimiento/medios/la-casa-de-papel-3-robar-oro-para-recuperar-el-amor-articulo-871675 |title=\"La Casa de Papel 3\": robar oro para recuperar el amor |publisher=elespectador.com |language=es |date=18 July 2019 |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref> for which the series received comparisons to [[telenovela]]s.<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /><ref name=theglobeandmail /> Comedic elements, which were compared to ''[[Back to the Future]]''<ref name=abc_170628>{{cite web |last=Soage |first=Noelia |url=https://www.abc.es/play/series/noticias/abci-entrevista-alvaro-morte-casa-papel-201706280112_noticia.html |title=\u00c1lvaro Morte: \"La casa de papel va a marcar un antes y un despu\u00e9s en la forma de tratar la ficci\u00f3n en este pa\u00eds\" |publisher=abc.es |language=es |date=28 June 2017 |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref> and [[black comedy]],<ref name=elpais_190614 /> also offset the heist tension.<ref name=variety_190801 /> The heist film formula is subverted by the heist starting straight after the opening credits instead of lingering on how the gang is brought together.<ref name=haaretz_180807>{{cite web |last=Hennigan |first=Adrian |url=https://www.haaretz.com/life/television/.premium-netflix-s-money-heist-will-steal-your-heart-and-your-weekend-1.5977887 |title=Netflix's 'Money Heist' Will Steal Your Heart and Your Weekend |publisher=[[haaretz.com]] |date=7 April 2018 |access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith the series being set after the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], which resulted in severe austerity measures in Spain,<ref name=theglobeandmail /> critics argued that the series was an explicit allegory of rebellion against capitalism,<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /><ref name=lemonde_190313>{{cite web |last=S\u00e9risier |first=Pierre |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/seriestv/2018/03/13/la-casa-de-papel-allegorie-de-la-rebellion/ |title=La Casa de Papel \u2013 All\u00e9gorie de la r\u00e9bellion |language=fr |publisher=lemonde.fr |date=13 March 2018 |access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> including ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', who saw the series as \"subversive in that it's about a heist for the people.

She added that the amount of information and technology that surrounds us is allowing us to verify that \"everyone has a dark side.\"<ref name=huffingtonpost_190628 /> The series leaves it to the audience to decide who is good or bad, as characters are \"relatable and immoral\" at various points in the story.<ref name=dramaquarterly_180629 /> Pina argued that it was this ability to change view

Created by [[\u00c1lex Pina]], the series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. [[Netflix]] acquired the global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, has been released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled ''Money Heist: The Phenomenon''.\n\nThe first two parts revolve around a long-prepared, multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]], in which a group of robbers take hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion. It involves eight robbers, code-named after cities and led by the Professor ([[\u00c1lvaro Morte]]) from an external location. The story is primarily focused on one of the robbers, Tokyo ([[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]]), as they battle with hostages on the inside and the police on the outside. In the third part, the surviving robbers are forced out of hiding, and with the help of new members, they plan and perform an assault on the [[Bank of Spain]].\n\nThe series was filmed in Madrid, Spain. Significant portions of part 3 were also filmed in [[Panama]], [[Thailand]] and [[Florence]], Italy. The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations and an unreliable narrator for complexity. The series subverts the heist genre by being told from the perspective of a woman (Tokyo) and having a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity, where emotional dynamics offset the perfect strategic crime.\n\nThe series received critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song \"[[Bella ciao]]\", which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /> with a particular resonance coming from viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin world.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception and writing ===\n\n{{further|#Themes and analysis}}\n\n{{Quote box |title= |quote=\"We wanted to make a

After a brief outline of the planned heist, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]]. The eight robbers are code-named after cities: Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki and Oslo. Dressed in red jumpsuits with a mask of the Spanish painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], the group of robbers take 67 hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion through a self-built escape tunnel. The Professor heads the heist from an external location. Flashbacks throughout the series show the five months of preparation in an abandoned hunting estate in the [[Province of Toledo|Toledo]] countryside; the robbers are not to share personal information nor engage in personal relationships, and the assault shall be without bloodshed.\n\nThroughout parts 1 and 2, the robbers inside the Mint have difficulties sticking to the pre-defined rules, and face uncooperative hostages, violence, isolation, and mutiny. Tokyo commentates the events through [[voice-over]]s. While Denver pursues a love affair with the hostage M\u00f3nica Gaztambide, inspector Raquel Murillo of the [[National Police Corps]] negotiates with the Professor on the outside and begins an intimate relationship with his alter ego \"Salva\". The Professor's identity is repeatedly close to being uncovered, until Raquel realises his true identity, but is emotionally unable and unwilling to hand him over to the police. At the end of part 2, after 128 hours, the robbers escape successfully from the Mint with \u20ac984 million printed, but at the cost of the lives of Oslo, Moscow and Berlin. One year after the heist, Raquel decodes postcards left by the Professor for a location in [[Palawan]] in the Philippines, where she reunites with him.\n\n=== Season 2: Part 3 (2019) and Part 4 (2020) ===\n\nPart 3 begins two to three years after the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations. However, when [[Europol]] captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the [[Bank of Spain]] to force Europol to hand over Rio to prevent his torture. He and Raquel (going by \"Lisbon\") get the gang, including M\u00f3nica (going by \"Stockholm\"), back together and enlist three new members: Bogot\u00e1, Palermo and Marseille, with Palermo in charge. Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different approaches to love. The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets, while the Professor and Lisbon travel in an [[RV]] and then an ambulance while communicating with the robbers and the police. A breach in the bank is thwarted, forcing the police, led by Colonel Luis Tamayo and pregnant inspector Alicia Sierra, to release Rio to the robbers. Nairobi gets gravely injured by a police-inflicted [[sniper]] shot in the chest, and Lisbon is caught by the police. With another police assault on the bank incoming, and believing Lisbon to have been executed by the police, the Professor radios Palermo and declares [[DEFCON 2]] on the police. Part 3 concludes by showing Lisbon alive and in custody, and Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap and that \"the war had begun.\"\n\nPart 4 begins with the robbers rushing to save Nairobi's life, but after Tokyo stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], the ego-centric Palermo is about to walk out of the bank before he is restrained to a chair by the group. With the help of Tokyo, the Professor realises that the police had staged Lisbon's execution. The Professor and Marseille deduce that Lisbon is being interrogated inside a police tent outside of the bank, and persuade Tamayo's assistant, Anto\u00f1anzas, to do tasks for them. As the group manage to save Nairobi's life, Palermo creates chaos to reestablish his command by colluding with Gand\u00eda, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain; he dislocates his thumbs in order to slip through his handcuffs as verbally aided by Palermo. After Rio is emotionally unable to stop Gand\u00eda from escaping, Gand\u00eda nearly kills both Nairobi and Helsinki. Gand\u00eda begins communications with the police from within a [[panic room]] inside the bank. Gand\u00eda captures Tokyo and restrains her in the panic room. Palermo confirms his collusion with Gand\u00eda to the Professor; the Professor assures he will be punished later, and orders the group to unchain him. but after a shootout ensues, he restrains Nairobi and uses her to escape while the group holds him at gunpoint. As he escapes, he shoots Nairobi in the head, killing her instantly\u2014Denver throws a grenade, which injures Gand\u00eda. Back in the panic room, Gand\u00eda unties Tokyo to remove the shrapnel from his back; she knocks him unconscious and the group frees her. As the police ready an assault on the bank, the Professor exposes the unlawful torture of Rio and holding of Lisbon nationally via video, which deflates their plans. Due to this revelation, Sierra is fired and begins a pursuit of the Professor on her own. The Professor enlists Benjam\u00edn, father of Julia (going by \"Manila\" who poses as a hostage), and Moscow's godchild, and his crew to help him in freeing Lisbon from the Supreme Court's parking garage after the [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Ministry of the Interior]] had brought her there to testify. The group forces Gand\u00eda to request a helicopter from the police to be airlifted out from the roof of the bank, but the Professor intercepts the call and brings in his own helicopter that transports and reunites a disguised Lisbon with the group. Part 4 concludes with Sierra finding the Professor's hideout, holding him at gunpoint.\n\n== Themes and analysis ==\n\nThe series was noted for its subversions of the [[heist genre]]. While heist films are usually told with a rational male Anglo-centric focus, the series reframes the heist story by giving it a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity and telling it from a female perspective through Tokyo.<ref name=lavozdeasturias_190126>{{cite web |last=Vidal |first=Mar\u00eda |url=https://www.lavozdeasturias.es/noticia/cultura/2019/01/26/embarcadero-tenia-presion-casa-papel/0003_201901SY26P14991.htm |title=\u00c1lex Pina: \"Con 'El embarcadero' ten\u00eda m\u00e1s presi\u00f3n que con 'La Casa de Papel'\" |language=es |publisher=lavozdeasturias.es |date=4 February 2019 |access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> The producers regarded the cultural identity as an important part of the personality of the series, as it made the story more relatable for viewers.<ref name=xataka_190705>{{cite web |last=Muela |first=Cesar |url=https://www.xataka.com/cine-y-tv/casa-papel-no-hubiera-estado-netflix-seguiriamos-diciendo-que-no-podemos-competir-series-fuera-alex-pina-creador-serie |title=\"Si 'La Casa de Papel' no hubiera estado en Netflix seguir\u00edamos diciendo que no podemos competir con las series de fuera\", \u00c1lex Pina, creador de la serie |publisher=xataka.com |language=es |date=3 July 2019 |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref> They also avoided adapting the series to international tastes,<ref name=xataka_190705 /> which helped to set it apart from the usual American TV series<ref name=elespanol_190724 /> and raised international awareness of Spanish sensibilities.<ref name=xataka_190705 /> Emotional dynamics like the passion and impulsivity of friendship and love offset the perfect strategic crime for increased tension.<ref name=lavozdeasturias_190126 /><ref name=elcomercio_190808>{{cite web |url=https://elcomercio.pe/tvmas/series/casa-papel-temporada-4-fecha-estreno-netflix-parte-4-trailer-historia-pasara-actores-personajes-money-heist-espana-ficha-tv-nnda-nnlt-noticia-650201 |title=\"La casa de papel\", temporada 4: fecha de estreno en Netflix, qu\u00e9 pasar\u00e1, actores, personajes, misterios y teor\u00edas |language=es |publisher=elcomercio.pe |date=10 August 2019 |access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> Nearly all main characters, including the relationship-opposing Professor, eventually succumb to love,<ref name=elespectador_190718>{{cite web |last=Contreras Fajardo |first=Lilian |url=https://www.elespectador.com/entretenimiento/medios/la-casa-de-papel-3-robar-oro-para-recuperar-el-amor-articulo-871675 |title=\"La Casa de Papel 3\": robar oro para recuperar el amor |publisher=elespectador.com |language=es |date=18 July 2019 |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref> for which the series received comparisons to [[telenovela]]s.<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /><ref name=theglobeandmail /> Comedic elements, which were compared to ''[[Back to the Future]]''<ref name=abc_170628>{{cite web |last=Soage |first=Noelia |url=https://www.abc.es/play/series/noticias/abci-entrevista-alvaro-morte-casa-papel-201706280112_noticia.html |title=\u00c1lvaro Morte: \"La casa de papel va a marcar un antes y un despu\u00e9s en la forma de tratar la ficci\u00f3n en este pa\u00eds\" |publisher=abc.es |language=es |date=28 June 2017 |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref> and [[black comedy]],<ref name=elpais_190614 /> also offset the heist tension.<ref name=variety_190801 /> The heist film formula is subverted by the heist starting straight after the opening credits instead of lingering on how the gang is brought together.<ref name=haaretz_180807>{{cite web |last=Hennigan |first=Adrian |url=https://www.haaretz.com/life/television/.premium-netflix-s-money-heist-will-steal-your-heart-and-your-weekend-1.5977887 |title=Netflix's 'Money Heist' Will Steal Your Heart and Your Weekend |publisher=[[haaretz.com]] |date=7 April 2018 |access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith the series being set after the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], which resulted in severe austerity measures in Spain,<ref name=theglobeandmail /> critics argued that the series was an explicit allegory of rebellion against capitalism,<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /><ref name=lemonde_190313>{{cite web |last=S\u00e9risier |first=Pierre |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/seriestv/2018/03/13/la-casa-de-papel-allegorie-de-la-rebellion/ |title=La Casa de Papel \u2013 All\u00e9gorie de la r\u00e9bellion |language=fr |publisher=lemonde.fr |date=13 March 2018 |access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> including ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', who saw the series as \"subversive in that it's about a heist for the people.

She added that the amount of information and technology that surrounds us is allowing us to verify that \"everyone has a dark side.\"<ref name=huffingtonpost_190628 /> The series leaves it to the audience to decide who is good or bad, as characters are \"relatable and immoral\" at various points in the story.<ref name=dramaquarterly_180629 /> Pina argued that it was this ability to change view

However, this did not deter the owner, Archibald du Boulay, and following a meeting at his house on 17 February 1834 it was decided to try again, and thus the idea of Forest Proprietary Grammar School was launched. The owners of the new school were mainly local dignitaries, their President was [[William Taylor Copeland]], and they recruited Rev. Thomas Dry as the first headmaster. The school opened on 1 October 1834 with 22 pupils.<ref name = \"Gerald Wright\">{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Gerald |date=2004 |title= Forest School 1834-2004|url=https://www.forest.org.uk/old-foresters/archive/ |location=Totton |publisher=Hobbs The Printers Ltd |page=6 |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref>\n\nWalthamstow had a very rural setting at this time before the railway opened in 1870, but the school's location on the Snaresbrook Road and Woodford New Road coaching routes to London gave it good links to the city. The school prospered in its first few years, and before the end of the decade had 80 pupils, the majority being borders.<ref name=\"Guy Deaton\"/> The School Library opened in 1836, making it the longest surviving Forest institution.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/>\n\nThe 1840s were a difficult decade for the school, with pupil numbers falling and rising costs. It is not clear exactly what caused this, but there were complaints of brutality and neglect, and it was decided to close the school in 1844. However the new headmaster Mr J. F. Boyes was determined it should be saved, and he was able to stave off the school's closure during his time in charge (1844-1848).<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/> By the time Mr Boyes came into a fortune in 1848 and therefore moved on from Forest, it is clear his efforts had stabilised the school's position. In 1848, Forest's third headmaster was John Gilderdale, who firmly put the school on its feet and laid the foundations for it to be one of the most successful nineteenth-century schools.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/> It was during Gilderdale's time in charge that \"In Pectore Robur\" became the school's motto. In June 1857 the School Chapel was opened, a fitting way to end his reign at the school.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/>\n\n===Frederick Barlow Guy and the school's Victorian expansion===\nIt was in the summer of 1857 that Frederick Barlow Guy took over from his father-in-law as Forest's headmaster, beginning a period of almost 80 years when a Guy would be in charge of the school. Frederick Guy, who earlier had been [[Bradfield College]]'s first headmaster, was Forest headmaster from 1857-1886.<ref name=\"Guy Deaton\"/>\n\nThe school grew in size to about 100 pupils, and several major building projects were completed which vastly developed and expanded the school's facilities. In 1859 the Sick Cottage (later the Senior Common Room) was built, followed by the first swimming pool in 1865 (it was replaced in 1877), the gymnasium in 1872, the enlarged chapel in 1875 and the Fives Court in 1879. The largest building project was opened at the end of Guy's reign in 1886, when the grand Dining Hall was opened.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/>\n\nAcademically the school also expanded; in 1860 the first Shakespeare Play, in 1865 the first edition of the School Magazine, and in 1883 the Cadets was formed. [[William Morris]], a former private pupil of Frederick Guy, presented a banner to the school in 1879, still held in the dining hall. In 1886, Frederick's son Thomas Edward Barlow \"Ned\" Guy took over as headmaster until in 1894 he left to be the parish priest at Fulford, in Yorkshire.<ref name=\"Guy Deaton\"/>\n\n===Forest's influence on Association Football===\n[[File:Common Forest School Mar 2019 (7).jpg|300px|thumb|right|The Common at the front of the school was the site for all early Forest cricket and football matches.]]Forest had an important role in the development and creation of [[Association Football]], and the Common at the front of the school may well be regarded as a \"cradle of the game\".<ref name = \"P.C.Adams\">{{cite book |last=Adams |first=P.C. |date=1976 |title= From Little Acorns|url=https://www.forest.org.uk/old-foresters/archive/ |location=Windsor |publisher= |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref> In the school's early years there was no sport apart from informal kick-about by the pupils, but by the 1840s cricket was played and hockey was in vogue in the early 1850s. Football began at Forest in 1857 when Frederick Guy took over as headmaster; it was played on The Common, at the front of the school. The Common was a rather uneven playing surface, with the great chestnut trees at the side of the pitch \"in play\" and some famous iron railings marking the north end of the pitch. Tradition records some great battles between [[Charles W. Alcock]] and F.J. Poole, in which the object was to barge the other player over the iron railings!<ref name=\"Guy Deaton\"/> The earliest reported match against another school was in [[Forest School F.C.|Forest's]] first season on 24 February 1858, when Forest beat [[Chigwell School]] 5-4 on The Common.<ref>Bell's Life In London, 7 March 1858</ref> Another early game was on Saturday 16 November 1861, when Forest School, (playing as \"Walthamstow\"), lost to a [[Westminster School]] side (playing as \"Bounding Bricks\") by three goals to nil.<ref>The Sporting Life, 20 November 1861</ref> A return match was played four weeks later, and in 1862 the school played against Old Westminsters (playing as Elizabethan Club).<ref>The Sporting Life, 7 December 1862</ref>\n\nBy 1863, Forest football had a major influence on the development of the game, and it was involved in the formation of the Football Association and also the leading club at the time, [[The Wanderers F.C.|The Forest Club]]. Forest School joined the F.A. for its fifth meeting, on 1 December 1863, when John Bouch and [[David John Morgan]] represented the school on a 15-man committee.<ref name=\"Harvey 2005\">{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=Adrian |date=2005 |title= Football: The First Hundred Years|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6u12cOLsrfsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=football+first+hundred+years+harvey&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwifkLqNktrhAhXCuHEKHf7IDVsQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=football%20first%20hundred%20years%20harvey&f=false/ |location=Abingdon |publisher=Routledge |page= |isbn=0415350182 |author-link= }}</ref> It was at this fifth F.A. meeting that the important amendment was made to the rules that running with the ball and hacking would be removed, and Forest, an opponent of such \"Rugby rules\", would have been influential in voting for this change.<ref name=\" Harvey 2005\"/> Forest School is the second oldest continuous member of the F.A., behind only the [[Civil Service F.C.|Civil Service]]. W.J. Cutbill, a member of the 1863 school team, also served as an early member of the F.A. Committee.<ref name=\"Guy Deaton\"/><ref name=\"P.C.Adams\"/> H. Tubb, captain of Forest in 1868, has been said to have been an F.A. Committee member, but this is not backed up by F.A. records and is probably a mistaken reading of a reference from the 1888 Forest School Magazine of him being part of the school committee.{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\n[[File:Forest School Football 1884.png|300px|thumb|right|Forest football team 1884.]]Although a member of the F.A. from almost the very beginning, the school's own rules, \"The Forest Rules\", were still played up until 1867, with 15 players a side. The Wanderers described the Forest Rules as \"a happy mixture of Rugby, Harrow and Charterhouse rules\". It was essentially a dribbling game, and \"shinning, hacking and tripping\" was not allowed. From the 1867-68 season Forest decided to play all its home matches under the rules of the Football Association, although away games could still be played under the local rules of the host club.<ref>Forest School Magazine archive, 1867</ref> 15 players per side could still be played up until 1869.<ref name=\"P.C.Adams\"/>\n\nForest is the only school to have played in the [[FA Cup|F.A. Cup]], which it did for four seasons 1875-1879. The [[Old Foresters F.C.]], founded in 1876, entered the F.A.Cup in 12 seasons (1877-1889), and reached the quarter-finals in 1882, losing 0-1 to [[Marlow F.C.|Great Marlow]] at Slough in a replay after a 0-0 draw in the first meeting at The Oval. The 1887 campaign ended after a 0-3 defeat to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] at Leyton, in front of 5,000 spectators.<ref>The Preston Herald, 2 February 1887</ref> Preston North End won the first-ever Football League championship two years later. Other F.A.Cup games were played against future Football League clubs [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] and Watford Rovers (later to become [[Watford F.C.]]). Old Foresters [[Percy Fairclough]] and [[Fred Pelly]] played for [[England national football team|England]].<ref name=\"P.C.Adams\"/>\n\n===Ralph Courtenay Guy===\n[[File:Ralph Courtenay Guy.png|150px|thumb|right|R.C. Guy.]]In 1894 Ralph Guy took over from his brother as headmaster, continuing the Guy legacy and starting 41 years at the helm. Ralph Guy had been a pupil at Forest himself. He was a first-class sportsman and he continued the strong sporting culture at the school; one of the first things he did was set up the annual \"Sylvestrians\" Cricket Week.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/> [[Edward L. Atkinson]] was taught at Forest in the 1890s, who went on to be the surgeon on [[Robert Falcon Scott|Scott's]] last, fatal Antarctic Expedition, but had the good fortune to survive himself. The school's pupil numbers and facilities continued to grow: a new Sanatorium in 1902, an extended Junior School, a new Grub Shop and in 1906 the School's Science Laboratory was built at the south end of College Place on the site of the modern Theatre.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/>\n\nThe Great War of 1914-1918 affected Forest greatly as it did for the nation as a whole. There were many reports of the suffering and the heroism which Old Foresters endured during the conflict, and Lieutenant Geary's Victoria Cross and a number of Military Crosses bear testimony to the Old Foresters in battle.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/> The School Magazine reported first-hand accounts of a Zeppelin raid taking place over London, and another occasion of the destruction of an airship by fire. 98 Old Foresters were killed in the Great War, their names are recorded on the south wall of the Chapel.<ref name=\"Guy Deaton\"/> The 1920s saw the formation of the House System: Doctor's after Dr. F. B. Guy, Poole's after Prebendary F. J. Poole, and Johnians after John Gilderdale. Soon after the school celebrated its centenary, Ralph Courtenay Guy sold the school in 1935, and the Guy dynasty of almost 80 years was ended.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/>\n\n===Gerald Miller and post-war growth===\nIn 1936 Gerald Miller became Forest's seventh Headmaster after buying the school from R.C. Guy.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/> Three years later the onset of the [[World War II|Second World War]] brought significant disruption to Forest, which still operated throughout the war. The most significant event was in August 1944 when a flying-bomb scored a direct hit on the Junior School, which it destroyed along with the  cricket pavilion, Grub Shop and Manor cottage.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/> 40 Old Foresters and one school servant lost their lives in the war.<ref name=\"Guy Deaton\"/> In April 1947 Gerald Miller transferred ownership of the school to a newly-formed charitable Association, and Forest school moved from being a privately-owned school to a [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], with about 300 pupils at this time.<ref name=\"Guy Deaton\"/>\n\nPost-war the school underwent a decade of transformation and expansion. The Park was levelled and expanded in 1947, providing an expanse of modern sporting pitches. The Manor cottage, Grub Shop and cricket pavilion were rebuilt and the Junior School was rebuilt in 1950. The new Aston Block was opened in 1953, providing a large, modern classroom block for the expanding pupil numbers, and the new science complex was opened in 1957.<ref name=\"Guy Deaton\"/> Copelands was created as the fifth house to reflect growing pupil numbers; by 1959 there were about 450 pupils including 139 boarders. Gerald Miller retired in 1960.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/>\n\n==Notable former pupils==\n{{see also|Category:People educated at Forest School, Walthamstow}}\nSome notable OFs include:\n\n* '''Academia'''\n** [[Bernard Ashmole]], archaeologist and art historian\n** [[Malcolm Brenner]], founding director of the [[Center for Cell and Gene Therapy]]\n** [[Richard J.

The school opened on 1 October 1834 with 22 pupils.<ref name = \"Gerald Wright\">{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Gerald |date=2004 |title= Forest School 1834-2004|url=https://www.forest.org.uk/old-foresters/archive/ |location=Totton |publisher=Hobbs The Printers Ltd |page=6 |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref>\n\nWalthamstow had a very rural setting at this time before the railway opened in 1870, but the school's location on the Snaresbrook Road and Woodford New Road coaching routes to London gave it good links to the city. The school prospered in its first few years, and before the end of the decade had 80 pupils, the majority being borders.<ref name=\"Guy Deaton\"/> The School Library opened in 1836, making it the longest surviving Forest institution.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/>\n\nThe 1840s were a difficult decade for the school, with pupil numbers falling and rising costs. It is not clear exactly what caused this, but there were complaints of brutality and neglect, and it was decided to close the school in 1844. However the new headmaster Mr J. F. Boyes was determined it should be saved, and he was able to stave off the school's closure during his time in charge (1844-1848).<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/> By the time Mr Boyes came into a fortune in 1848 and therefore moved on from Forest, it is clear his efforts had stabilised the school's position. In 1848, Forest's third headmaster was John Gilderdale, who firmly put the school on its feet and laid the foundations for it to be one of the most successful nineteenth-century schools.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/> It was during Gilderdale's time in charge that \"In Pectore Robur\" became the school's motto. In June 1857 the School Chapel was opened, a fitting way to end his reign at the school.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/>\n\n===Frederick Barlow Guy and the school's Victorian expansion===\nIt was in the summer of 1857 that Frederick Barlow Guy took over from his father-in-law as Forest's headmaster, beginning a period of almost 80 years when a Guy would be in charge of the school. Frederick Guy, who earlier had been [[Bradfield College]]'s first headmaster, was Forest headmaster from 1857-1886.<ref name=\"Guy Deaton\"/>\n\nThe school grew in size to about 100 pupils, and several major building projects were completed which vastly developed and expanded the school's facilities. In 1859 the Sick Cottage (later the Senior Common Room) was built, followed by the first swimming pool in 1865 (it was replaced in 1877), the gymnasium in 1872, the enlarged chapel in 1875 and the Fives Court in 1879. The largest building project was opened at the end of Guy's reign in 1886, when the grand Dining Hall was opened.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/>\n\nAcademically the school also expanded; in 1860 the first Shakespeare Play, in 1865 the first edition of the School Magazine, and in 1883 the Cadets was formed. [[William Morris]], a former private pupil of Frederick Guy, presented a banner to the school in 1879, still held in the dining hall. In 1886, Frederick's son Thomas Edward Barlow \"Ned\" Guy took over as headmaster until in 1894 he left to be the parish priest at Fulford, in Yorkshire.<ref name=\"Guy Deaton\"/>\n\n===Forest's influence on Association Football===\n[[File:Common Forest School Mar 2019 (7).jpg|300px|thumb|right|The Common at the front of the school was the site for all early Forest cricket and football matches.]]Forest had an important role in the development and creation of [[Association Football]], and the Common at the front of the school may well be regarded as a \"cradle of the game\".<ref name = \"P.C.Adams\">{{cite book |last=Adams |first=P.C. |date=1976 |title= From Little Acorns|url=https://www.forest.org.uk/old-foresters/archive/ |location=Windsor |publisher= |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref> In the school's early years there was no sport apart from informal kick-about by the pupils, but by the 1840s cricket was played and hockey was in vogue in the early 1850s. Football began at Forest in 1857 when Frederick Guy took over as headmaster; it was played on The Common, at the front of the school. The Common was a rather uneven playing surface, with the great chestnut trees at the side of the pitch \"in play\" and some famous iron railings marking the north end of the pitch. Tradition records some great battles between [[Charles W. Alcock]] and F.J. Poole, in which the object was to barge the other player over the iron railings!<ref name=\"Guy Deaton\"/> The earliest reported match against another school was in [[Forest School F.C.|Forest's]] first season on 24 February 1858, when Forest beat [[Chigwell School]] 5-4 on The Common.<ref>Bell's Life In London, 7 March 1858</ref> Another early game was on Saturday 16 November 1861, when Forest School, (playing as \"Walthamstow\"), lost to a [[Westminster School]] side (playing as \"Bounding Bricks\") by three goals to nil.<ref>The Sporting Life, 20 November 1861</ref> A return match was played four weeks later, and in 1862 the school played against Old Westminsters (playing as Elizabethan Club).<ref>The Sporting Life, 7 December 1862</ref>\n\nBy 1863, Forest football had a major influence on the development of the game, and it was involved in the formation of the Football Association and also the leading club at the time, [[The Wanderers F.C.|The Forest Club]]. Forest School joined the F.A. for its fifth meeting, on 1 December 1863, when John Bouch and [[David John Morgan]] represented the school on a 15-man committee.<ref name=\"Harvey 2005\">{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=Adrian |date=2005 |title= Football: The First Hundred Years|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6u12cOLsrfsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=football+first+hundred+years+harvey&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwifkLqNktrhAhXCuHEKHf7IDVsQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=football%20first%20hundred%20years%20harvey&f=false/ |location=Abingdon |publisher=Routledge |page= |isbn=0415350182 |author-link= }}</ref> It was at this fifth F.A. meeting that the important amendment was made to the rules that running with the ball and hacking would be removed, and Forest, an opponent of such \"Rugby rules\", would have been influential in voting for this change.<ref name=\" Harvey 2005\"/> Forest School is the second oldest continuous member of the F.A., behind only the [[Civil Service F.C.|Civil Service]]. W.J. Cutbill, a member of the 1863 school team, also served as an early member of the F.A. Committee.<ref name=\"Guy Deaton\"/><ref name=\"P.C.Adams\"/> H. Tubb, captain of Forest in 1868, has been said to have been an F.A. Committee member, but this is not backed up by F.A. records and is probably a mistaken reading of a reference from the 1888 Forest School Magazine of him being part of the school committee.{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\n[[File:Forest School Football 1884.png|300px|thumb|right|Forest football team 1884.]]Although a member of the F.A. from almost the very beginning, the school's own rules, \"The Forest Rules\", were still played up until 1867, with 15 players a side. The Wanderers described the Forest Rules as \"a happy mixture of Rugby, Harrow and Charterhouse rules\". It was essentially a dribbling game, and \"shinning, hacking and tripping\" was not allowed. From the 1867-68 season Forest decided to play all its home matches under the rules of the Football Association, although away games could still be played under the local rules of the host club.<ref>Forest School Magazine archive, 1867</ref> 15 players per side could still be played up until 1869.<ref name=\"P.C.Adams\"/>\n\nForest is the only school to have played in the [[FA Cup|F.A. Cup]], which it did for four seasons 1875-1879. The [[Old Foresters F.C.]], founded in 1876, entered the F.A.Cup in 12 seasons (1877-1889), and reached the quarter-finals in 1882, losing 0-1 to [[Marlow F.C.|Great Marlow]] at Slough in a replay after a 0-0 draw in the first meeting at The Oval. The 1887 campaign ended after a 0-3 defeat to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] at Leyton, in front of 5,000 spectators.<ref>The Preston Herald, 2 February 1887</ref> Preston North End won the first-ever Football League championship two years later. Other F.A.Cup games were played against future Football League clubs [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] and Watford Rovers (later to become [[Watford F.C.]]). Old Foresters [[Percy Fairclough]] and [[Fred Pelly]] played for [[England national football team|England]].<ref name=\"P.C.Adams\"/>\n\n===Ralph Courtenay Guy===\n[[File:Ralph Courtenay Guy.png|150px|thumb|right|R.C. Guy.]]In 1894 Ralph Guy took over from his brother as headmaster, continuing the Guy legacy and starting 41 years at the helm. Ralph Guy had been a pupil at Forest himself. He was a first-class sportsman and he continued the strong sporting culture at the school; one of the first things he did was set up the annual \"Sylvestrians\" Cricket Week.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/> [[Edward L. Atkinson]] was taught at Forest in the 1890s, who went on to be the surgeon on [[Robert Falcon Scott|Scott's]] last, fatal Antarctic Expedition, but had the good fortune to survive himself. The school's pupil numbers and facilities continued to grow: a new Sanatorium in 1902, an extended Junior School, a new Grub Shop and in 1906 the School's Science Laboratory was built at the south end of College Place on the site of the modern Theatre.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/>\n\nThe Great War of 1914-1918 affected Forest greatly as it did for the nation as a whole. There were many reports of the suffering and the heroism which Old Foresters endured during the conflict, and Lieutenant Geary's Victoria Cross and a number of Military Crosses bear testimony to the Old Foresters in battle.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/> The School Magazine reported first-hand accounts of a Zeppelin raid taking place over London, and another occasion of the destruction of an airship by fire. 98 Old Foresters were killed in the Great War, their names are recorded on the south wall of the Chapel.<ref name=\"Guy Deaton\"/> The 1920s saw the formation of the House System: Doctor's after Dr. F. B. Guy, Poole's after Prebendary F. J. Poole, and Johnians after John Gilderdale. Soon after the school celebrated its centenary, Ralph Courtenay Guy sold the school in 1935, and the Guy dynasty of almost 80 years was ended.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/>\n\n===Gerald Miller and post-war growth===\nIn 1936 Gerald Miller became Forest's seventh Headmaster after buying the school from R.C. Guy.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/> Three years later the onset of the [[World War II|Second World War]] brought significant disruption to Forest, which still operated throughout the war. The most significant event was in August 1944 when a flying-bomb scored a direct hit on the Junior School, which it destroyed along with the  cricket pavilion, Grub Shop and Manor cottage.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/> 40 Old Foresters and one school servant lost their lives in the war.<ref name=\"Guy Deaton\"/> In April 1947 Gerald Miller transferred ownership of the school to a newly-formed charitable Association, and Forest school moved from being a privately-owned school to a [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], with about 300 pupils at this time.<ref name=\"Guy Deaton\"/>\n\nPost-war the school underwent a decade of transformation and expansion. The Park was levelled and expanded in 1947, providing an expanse of modern sporting pitches. The Manor cottage, Grub Shop and cricket pavilion were rebuilt and the Junior School was rebuilt in 1950. The new Aston Block was opened in 1953, providing a large, modern classroom block for the expanding pupil numbers, and the new science complex was opened in 1957.<ref name=\"Guy Deaton\"/> Copelands was created as the fifth house to reflect growing pupil numbers; by 1959 there were about 450 pupils including 139 boarders. Gerald Miller retired in 1960.<ref name=\"Gerald Wright\"/>\n\n==Notable former pupils==\n{{see also|Category:People educated at Forest School, Walthamstow}}\nSome notable OFs include:\n\n* '''Academia'''\n** [[Bernard Ashmole]], ''archaeologist and art historian''\n** [[Malcolm Brenner]], ''founding director of the [[Center for Cell and Gene Therapy]]''\n** [[Richard J.
