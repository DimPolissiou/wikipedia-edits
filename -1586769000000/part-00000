December 2016}}</ref> The series is set in and around the fictional 7de Laan (Sewende Laan or 7th Avenue) in the suburb of Hillside, Johannesburg, where the characters live and work.<ref name=\"TVSA-About\" /> The programme's dialogue is primarily in Afrikaans and is subtitled in English with some English and Zulu dialogue in between.<ref name=\"TVSA-About\" /> The street and shopfronts which are featured on the opening visuals, are that of [[7th Street (Johannesburg)|Seventh Street]] in [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]], [[Johannesburg]].\n\n==History==\n\nOdendaal originally conceived of the series when he was a resident of the Melville section of Johannesburg.<ref name=\"7deLaan-History\" /> At the time, Odendaal would watch the people of his community over breakfast and a cup of coffee at his favourite coffee shop.<ref name=\"7deLaan-History\" /> He would make up fictitious characters based on what he saw.<ref name=\"behindscenes\" />\n\nThe working title for the show was ''Die Koffiekan'' (The Coffee Pot).<ref name=\"7deLaan-History\" /> Later it was renamed ''Hoe Meer Dae\u2026'' (The More Days), but the name was considered too similar to the American soap opera, ''[[Days of Our Lives]].''<ref name=\"7deLaan-History\" /> Eventually, the title ''7de Laan'' was chosen because it reflects a place where people live and work and because it is a common street name in South Africa.<ref name=\"7deLaan-History\" />\n\n==Broadcast history==\n\nThe series made its debut on Tuesday, 4 April 2000, on South African public television network [[SABC

Within the suburb, there are many businesses and shops where the characters work and hang out. These are some of the locations featured in the series:<ref name=\"TVSA-About\" />\n\n*'''Hillside Heights'''\nThe Hillside Heights is the centre of Hillside. It is an old residential building that has small apartments where most of the characters reside. The Hillside Heights building is owned by Willem Spies and Zama Mabaso. Many a ''spookstorie'' made its appearance in the building's alleys, and so often somebody gets locked-up in the store room ''by accident''.\n\n*'''Oppiekoffie'''<ref name=\"TVSA-About\" />\nCharmaine Meintjies owns Oppiekoffie, which is a coffee shop located on the ground floor of the Hillside Heights building, directly opposite the Eclectic E boutique. Esti is the manager and the current waiters are Kopano and Gabby. Many of the young characters who worked there as waiters in the past: Amorey, Annelie, Bernard, Clara, Connie, Danielle, Dewaal, Dezi, Diederik, Kabelo, Kim, Liezl, Lucas, Monique, Nozi, Paula, Pieter, Tessa and Zinzi.\n\n*'''Eclectic E Boutique'''<ref name=\"TVSA-About\" />\nEclectic E is the local boutique located opposite Oppiekoffie. It is owned by former model Connie van der Lecq, and was previously owned by Felicity Daniels, a well-known fashion designer. It was closed down for a time when Felicity left, but it has since reopened. Khethiwe is the assistant. Past assistants were Alyce, Pulane, Irma, Paula, Annelie, Clara, Monique, Tessa, Vernon, Emile and Elaine. It is a popular meeting place for many of the females.\n\n'''*The Hillside Deli'''\nThe Deli was owned and managed by Vince Meintjies (one of Neville Meintjies' sons). Jerome, Bart, Vanessa, Matrone, Lukas, Bernard, Pieter, Hilda and Amorey used to work here at different times.\n\n*'''The Hillside Bookshop'''<ref name=\"TVSA-About\" />\nThe bookshop is owned by Ryno Lategan with the assistance of Matrone Netta Nortj\u00e8. The bookshop has featured many real life book-releases on the show with the author guest-starring in the particular episode to sign autographs and to answer questions.\n\n*'''Bruynwaves'''\nBruynwaves is an events organising company, owned by Vanessa Meintjies. Diederik, Justin and Aggie are organisers, and Bonita is the event stylist.\n\n*'''Theron & Terreblanche (T&T)'''\nT&T is the local sporting equipment shop, formerly owned by Madel Terreblanche (the matriarch of the wealthy Terreblanche family and the namesake of the shop), and now owned by Fikani Chauke. The Hillside Gym is located on the first floor of the building. Rickus and Marvin work in T&T as shop assistants. Lukas, Marko and Vanessa were previous shop assistants. \n\n*'''O'Malley's'''\nO'Malley's is the pub where the young crowd like to hang out. Former bartenders included Lucas, Pieter and Bernard.\n\n*'''Stasie Ses'''\nThe after-work recreation and relaxation venue in Hillside. Owned and run by Marko Greyling.\n\n*'''The Welman House'''\nThis is a real, old time mansion, owned by DeWet Basson. It was previously owned by Madel Terreblanche and author Ryno Lategan, then by the Croukamps and the Welmans. It turns out to be a popular venue for house parties, fashion shows, book launches as well as wedding receptions. Evelina (an unseen character) was formerly the residence's cook, famous for her dish ''Evelina se niertjies''. She started working there when it was still Madel's house in early episodes.\n\n*'''Hillside Clinic'''\nWhenever there is a medical emergency, this scene comes into play. \"Patients\" are kept in bed for a short while, visited by the other characters, and then discharged home. Doctors Alexa Welman and Fikani Chauke work here. Romeo Peterson works there as a nurse and Matrone Netta Nortj\u00e8 works there as an administrator.\n\n*'''Beleef'''\nThe cafe' is located above Stasie Ses, and was built by Chris Welman as a replacement for the Hillside Deli. It is jointly owned by Chris' ex-wife Mariaan and former deli owner Vince Meintjies, and Ivy Peterson works in the kitchen. Previous waitresses were Esti, Olivia and Gabby. Ben also previously worked here, but was killed by the co-owner Mariaan Welman.\n\n'''Other places''' (seldom seen on screen):\n\n* Restaurant \"Le Petit Paris\"\n* The Cherry On Top (Restaurant)\n* Mostly Matise (Restaurant)\n* Laura Lee Beauty Salon\n* Felicity Fashions' factory\n* Die slaghuis (butchery)\n* Die apteek (pharmacy)\n* Police station and magistrate's court\n* The Church (mostly for weddings)\n\n==References in popular culture==\n\nThe show was referenced in the first episode of the [[Netflix]] original series, ''[[The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale]]'', in which McHale joked about a scene in an episode where one of the main characters calls one of the child guest stars, and calls the [[Afrikaans]] word for child, which sounds strikingly similar to the English swear word ''\"cunt\"''.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|South Africa}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0375446|title=Sewende Laan}}\n*

work.<ref name=\"TVSA-About\" /> The programme's dialogue is primarily in Afrikaans and is subtitled in English with some English and Zulu dialogue in between.<ref name=\"TVSA-About\" /> The street and shopfronts which are featured on the opening visuals, are that of [[7th Street (Johannesburg)|Seventh Street]] in [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]], [[Johannesburg]].\n\n==History==\n\nOdendaal originally conceived of the series when he was a resident of the Melville section of Johannesburg.<ref name=\"7deLaan-History\" /> At the time, Odendaal would watch the people of his community over breakfast and a cup of coffee at his favourite coffee shop.<ref name=\"7deLaan-History\" /> He would make up fictitious characters based on what he saw.<ref name=\"behindscenes\" />\n\nThe working title for the show was ''Die Koffiekan'' (The Coffee Pot).<ref name=\"7deLaan-History\" /> Later it was renamed ''Hoe Meer Dae\u2026'' (The More Days), but the name was considered too similar to the American soap opera, ''[[Days of Our Lives]].''<ref name=\"7deLaan-History\" /> Eventually, the title ''7de Laan'' was chosen because it reflects a place where people live and work and because it is a common street name in South Africa.<ref name=\"7deLaan-History\" />\n\n==Broadcast history==\n\nThe series made its debut on Tuesday, 4 April 2000, on South African public television network [[SABC

Within the suburb, there are many businesses and shops where the characters work and hang out. These are some of the locations featured in the series:<ref name=\"TVSA-About\" />\n\n*'''Hillside Heights'''\nThe Hillside Heights is the centre of Hillside. It is an old residential building that has small apartments where most of the characters reside. The Hillside Heights building is owned by Willem Spies and Zama Mabaso. Many a ''spookstorie'' made its appearance in the building's alleys, and so often somebody gets locked-up in the store room ''by accident''.\n\n*'''Oppiekoffie'''<ref name=\"TVSA-About\" />\nCharmaine Meintjies owns Oppiekoffie, which is a coffee shop located on the ground floor of the Hillside Heights building, directly opposite the Eclectic E boutique. Esti is the manager and the current waiters are Kopano and Gabby. Many of the young characters who worked there as waiters in the past: Amorey, Annelie, Bernard, Clara, Connie, Danielle, Dewaal, Dezi, Diederik, Kabelo, Kim, Liezl, Lucas, Monique, Nozi, Paula, Pieter, Tessa and Zinzi.\n\n*'''Eclectic E Boutique'''<ref name=\"TVSA-About\" />\nEclectic E is the local boutique located opposite Oppiekoffie. It is owned by former model Connie van der Lecq, and was previously owned by Felicity Daniels, a well-known fashion designer. It was closed down for a time when Felicity left, but it has since reopened. Khethiwe is the assistant. Past assistants were Alyce, Pulane, Irma, Paula, Annelie, Clara, Monique, Tessa, Vernon, Emile and Elaine. It is a popular meeting place for many of the females.\n\n'''*The Hillside Deli'''\nThe Deli was owned and managed by Vince Meintjies (one of Neville Meintjies' sons). Jerome, Bart, Vanessa, Matrone, Lukas, Bernard, Pieter, Hilda and Amorey used to work here at different times.\n\n*'''The Hillside Bookshop'''<ref name=\"TVSA-About\" />\nThe bookshop is owned by Ryno Lategan with the assistance of Matrone Netta Nortj\u00e8. The bookshop has featured many real life book-releases on the show with the author guest-starring in the particular episode to sign autographs and to answer questions.\n\n*'''Bruynwaves'''\nBruynwaves is an events organising company, owned by Vanessa Meintjies. Diederik, Justin and Aggie are organisers, and Bonita is the event stylist.\n\n*'''Theron & Terreblanche (T&T)'''\nT&T is the local sporting equipment shop, formerly owned by Madel Terreblanche (the matriarch of the wealthy Terreblanche family and the namesake of the shop), and now owned by Fikani Chauke. The Hillside Gym is located on the first floor of the building. Rickus and Marvin work in T&T as shop assistants. Lukas, Marko and Vanessa were previous shop assistants. \n\n*'''O'Malley's'''\nO'Malley's is the pub where the young crowd like to hang out. Former bartenders included Lucas, Pieter and Bernard.\n\n*'''Stasie Ses'''\nThe after-work recreation and relaxation venue in Hillside. Owned and run by Marko Greyling.\n\n*'''The Welman House'''\nThis is a real, old time mansion, owned by DeWet Basson. It was previously owned by Madel Terreblanche and author Ryno Lategan, then by the Croukamps and the Welmans. It turns out to be a popular venue for house parties, fashion shows, book launches as well as wedding receptions. Evelina (an unseen character) was formerly the residence's cook, famous for her dish ''Evelina se niertjies''. She started working there when it was still Madel's house in early episodes.\n\n*'''Hillside Clinic'''\nWhenever there is a medical emergency, this scene comes into play. \"Patients\" are kept in bed for a short while, visited by the other characters, and then discharged home. Doctors Alexa Welman and Fikani Chauke work here. Romeo Peterson works there as a nurse and Matrone Netta Nortj\u00e8 works there as an administrator.\n\n*'''Beleef'''\nThe cafe' is located above Stasie Ses, and was built by Chris Welman as a replacement for the Hillside Deli. It is jointly owned by Chris' ex-wife Mariaan and former deli owner Vince Meintjies, and Ivy Peterson works in the kitchen. Previous waitresses were Esti, Olivia and Gabby. Ben also previously worked here, but was killed by the co-owner Mariaan Welman.\n\n'''Other places''' (seldom seen on screen):\n\n* Restaurant \"Le Petit Paris\"\n* The Cherry On Top (Restaurant)\n* Mostly Matise (Restaurant)\n* Laura Lee Beauty Salon\n* Felicity Fashions' factory\n* Die slaghuis (butchery)\n* Die apteek (pharmacy)\n* Police station and magistrate's court\n* The Church (mostly for weddings)\n\n==References in popular culture==\n\nThe show was referenced in the first episode of the [[Netflix]] original series, ''[[The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale]]'', in which McHale joked about a scene in an episode where one of the main characters calls one of the child guest stars, and calls the [[Afrikaans]] word for child, which sounds strikingly similar to the English swear word ''\"cunt\"''.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|South Africa}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0375446|title=Sewende Laan}}\n* [http://www.tvsa.co.za/mastershowinfo.asp?mastershowid=298 TVSA's 7de Laan Mini-Site]\n\n[[Category:SABC 2 programmes]]\n[[Category:South African television soap operas]]\n[[Category:2000 South African television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Afrikaans-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in South Africa]]\n[[Category:2000s South African television series]]\n[[Category:2010s South African television series]]\n", "name_user": "Onlinekorner", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eBroadcast history)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7de_Laan"}
{"title_page": "Root-finding algorithms", "text_new": "{{short description|Algorithms for finding roots of continuous functions}}\nIn [[mathematics]] and [[computing]], a '''root-finding algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] for finding [[Zero of a function|zeroes]], also called \"roots\", of [[continuous function]]s.   A [[zero of a function|zero]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f''}}, from the [[real number]]s to real numbers or from the [[complex number]]s to the complex numbers, is a number {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 0}}. As, generally, the zeroes of a function cannot be computed exactly nor expressed in [[closed form expression|closed form]], root-finding algorithms provide approximations to zeroes, expressed either as [[floating point]] numbers or as small isolating [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]],  or [[disk (mathematics)|disks]] for complex roots (an interval or disk output being equivalent to an approximate output together with an error bound).\n\n[[equation solving|Solving an equation]] {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''g''(''x'')}} is the same as finding the roots of the function {{math|1=''h''(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') \u2013 ''g''(''x'')}}. Thus root-finding algorithms allow solving any [[equation (mathematics)|equation]] defined by continuous functions. However, most root-finding algorithms do not guarantee that they will find all the roots; in particular, if such an algorithm does not find any root, that does not mean that no root exists. \n\nMost numerical root-finding methods use [[iteration]], producing a [[sequence]] of numbers that hopefully converge towards the root as a  [[Limit of a sequence|limit]]. They require one or more ''initial guesses'' of the root as starting values, then each iteration of the algorithm produces a successively more accurate approximation to the root.   Since the iteration must be stopped at some point these methods produce an approximation to the root, not an exact solution.    Many methods compute subsequent values by evaluating an auxiliary function on the preceding values. The limit is thus a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the auxiliary function, which is chosen for having the roots of the original equation as fixed points, and for converging rapidly to these fixed points.\n\nThe behaviour of general root-finding algorithms is studied in [[numerical analysis]]. However, for polynomials, root-finding study belongs generally to [[computer algebra]], since algebraic properties of polynomials are fundamental for the most efficient algorithms. The efficiency of an algorithm may depend dramatically on the characteristics of the given functions. For example, many algorithms use the [[derivative]] of the input function, while others work on every [[continuous function]]. In general, numerical algorithms are not guaranteed to find all the roots of a function, so failing to find a root does not prove that there is no root. However, for [[polynomial]]s, there are specific algorithms that use algebraic properties for certifying that no root is missed, and locating the roots in separate intervals (or [[disk (mathematics)|disks]] for complex roots) that are small enough to ensure the convergence of numerical methods (typically [[Newton's method]]) to the unique root so located.\n\n== Bracketing methods ==\n\nBracketing methods determine successively smaller intervals (brackets) that contain a root. When the interval is small enough, then a root has been found. They generally use the [[intermediate value theorem]], which asserts that if a continuous function has values of opposite signs at the end points of an interval, then the function has at least one root in the interval. Therefore, they require to start with an interval such that the function takes opposite signs at the end points of the interval. However, in the case of [[polynomial]]s there are other methods ([[Descartes' rule of signs]], [[Budan's theorem]] and [[Sturm's theorem]]) for getting information on the number of roots in an interval. They lead to efficient algorithms for [[real-root isolation]] of polynomials, which ensure finding all real roots with a guaranteed accuracy.\n\n=== Bisection method ===\nThe simplest root-finding algorithm is the [[bisection method]]. Let {{math|''f''}} be a [[continuous function]], for which one knows an interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} such that  {{math|''f''(''a'')}} and {{math|''f''(''b'')}} have opposite signs (a bracket). Let {{math|1=''c'' = (''a'' +''b'')/2}} be the middle of the interval (the midpoint or the point that bisects the interval). Then either {{math|''f''(''a'')}} and {{math|''f''(''c'')}}, or {{math|''f''(''c'')}} and {{math|''f''(''b'')}} have opposite signs, and one has divided by two the size of the interval. Although the bisection method is robust, it gains one and only one [[bit]] of accuracy with each iteration. Other methods, under appropriate conditions, can gain accuracy faster.\n\n=== False position (''regula falsi'') ===\nThe [[false position method]], also called the ''regula falsi'' method, is similar to the bisection method, but instead of using bisection search's middle of the interval it uses the [[x-intercept|{{math|''x''}}-intercept]] of the line that connects the plotted function values at the endpoints of the interval, that is \n:<math>c= \\frac{af(b)-bf(a)}{f(b)-f(a)}.</math>\n\nFalse position is similar to the [[secant method]], except that, instead of retaining the last two points, it makes sure to keep one point on either side of the root.  The false position method can be faster than the bisection method and will never diverge like the secant method; however, it may fail to converge in some naive implementations due to roundoff errors that may lead to a wrong sign for {{math|''f''(''c'')}}; typically, this may occur if the [[rate of variation]] of {{mvar|f}} is large in the neighborhood of the root.\n\n[[Ridders' method]] is a variant of the false position method that uses the value of function at the midpoint of the interval, for getting a function with the same root, to which the false position method is applied. This gives a faster convergence with a similar robustness.\n\n== Interpolation ==\n\nMany root-finding processes work by [[interpolation]]. This consists in using the last computed approximate values of the root for approximating the function by a [[polynomial]] of low degree, which takes the same values at these approximate roots. Then the root of the polynomial is computed and used as a new approximate value of the root of the function, and the process is iterated.\n\nTwo values allow interpolating a function by a polynomial of degree one (that is approximating the graph of the function by a line). This is the basis of the [[secant method]]. Three values define a [[quadratic function]], which approximates the graph of the function by a [[parabola]]. This is [[Muller's method]].\n\n''Regula falsi'' is also an interpolation method, which differs secant method by using, for interpolating by a line, two points that are not necessarily the last two computed points.\n\n== Iterative methods ==\nAlthough all root-finding algorithms proceed by [[iteration]], an [[iterative method|iterative]] root-finding method generally uses a specific type of iteration, consisting of defining an auxiliary function, which is applied to the last computed approximations of a root for getting a new approximation. The iteration stops when a [[fixed-point iteration|fixed point]] ([[up to]] the desired precision) of the auxiliary function is reached, that is when the new computed value is sufficiently close to the preceding ones.\n\n=== Newton's method (and similar derivative-based methods) ===\n[[Newton's method]] assumes the function ''f'' to have a continuous [[derivative]]. Newton's method may not converge if started too far away from a root. However, when it does converge, it is faster than the bisection method, and is usually quadratic. Newton's method is also important because it readily generalizes to higher-dimensional problems. Newton-like methods with higher orders of convergence are the [[Householder's method]]s. The first one after Newton's method is [[Halley's method]] with cubic order of convergence.\n\n=== Secant method ===\nReplacing the derivative in Newton's method with a [[finite difference]], we get the [[secant method]]. This method does not require the computation (nor the existence) of a derivative, but the price is slower convergence (the order is approximately 1.6 ([[golden ratio]])). A generalization of the secant method in higher dimensions is [[Broyden's method]].\n\n=== Steffensen's method ===\nIf we use a polynomial fit to remove the quadratic part of the finite difference used in the Secant method, so that it better approximates the derivative, we obtain [[Steffensen's method]], which has quadratic convergence, and whose behavior (both good and bad) is essentially the same as Newton's method but does not require a derivative.\n\n=== Inverse interpolation ===\nThe appearance of complex values in interpolation methods can be avoided by interpolating the [[inverse function|inverse]] of ''f'', resulting in the [[inverse quadratic interpolation]] method. Again, convergence is asymptotically faster than the secant method, but inverse quadratic interpolation often behaves poorly when the iterates are not close to the root.\n\n==Combinations of methods==\n\n=== Brent's method ===\n[[Brent's method]] is a combination of the bisection method, the secant method and [[inverse quadratic interpolation]]. At every iteration, Brent's method decides which method out of these three is likely to do best, and proceeds by doing a step according to that method. This gives a robust and fast method, which therefore enjoys considerable popularity.\n\n== Roots of polynomials ==\n\nFinding roots of [[polynomial]] is a long-standing problem that has been the object of much research throughout history. A testament to this is that up until the 19th century [[algebra]] meant essentially [[theory of equations|theory of polynomial equations]].\n\nFinding the root of a [[linear polynomial]] (degree one) is easy and needs only one division. For [[quadratic polynomial]]s (degree two), the [[quadratic formula]] produces a solution, but its numerical evaluation may require some care for ensuring [[numerical stability]]. For degrees three and four, there are closed-form solutions in terms of [[radical expression|radicals]], which are generally not convenient for numerical evaluation, as being too complicated and involving the computation of several [[nth root|{{mvar|n}}th roots]] whose computation is not easier than the direct computation of the roots of the polynomial (for example the expression of the real roots of a [[cubic polynomial]] may involve non-real [[cube root]]s). For polynomials of degree five or higher [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]] asserts that there is, in general, no radical expression of the roots. \n\nSo, except for very low degrees, root finding of polynomials consists of finding approximations of the roots. By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], one knows that a polynomial of degree {{mvar|n}} has at most {{mvar|n}} real or complex roots, and this number is reached for almost all polynomials. \n\nIt follows that the problem of root finding for polynomials may be split in three different subproblems;\n* Finding one root\n* Finding all roots\n* Finding roots in a specific region of the [[complex plane]], typically the real roots or the real roots in a given interval (for example, when roots represents a physical quantity, only the real positive ones are interesting).\n\nFor finding one root, [[Newton's method]] and other general [[iterative method]]s work generally well.\n\nFor finding all the roots, the oldest method is, when a root {{mvar|r}} has been found, to divide the polynomial by {{math|''x'' \u2013 ''r''}}, and restart iteratively the search of a root of the quotient polynomial. However, except for low degrees, this does not work well because of the [[numerical instability]]: [[Wilkinson's polynomial]] shows that a very small modification of one coefficient may change dramatically not only the value of the roots, but also their nature (real or complex). Also, even with a good approximation, when one evaluates a polynomial at an approximate root, one may get a result that is far to be close to zero. For example, if a polynomial of degree 20 (the degree of Wilkinson's polynomial) has a root close to 10, the derivative of the polynomial at the root may be of the order of <math>10^{20};</math> this implies that an error of <math>10^{-10}</math> on the value of the root may produce a value of the polynomial at the approximate root that is of the order of <math>10^{10}.</math>\n\nFor avoiding these problems, methods have been elaborated, which compute all roots simultaneously, to any desired accuracy. Presently the most efficient method is [[Aberth method]]. A [[free software|free]] implementation is available under the name of [[MPSolve]]. This is a reference implementation, which can find routinely the roots of polynomials of degree larger than 1,000, with more than 1,000 significant decimal digits.\n\nThe methods for computing all roots may be used for computing real roots. However, it may be difficult to decide whether a root with a small imaginary part is real or not. Moreover, as the number of the real roots is, on the average, the logarithm of the degree, it is a waste of computer resources to compute the non-real roots when one is interested in real roots. \n\nThe oldest method for computing the number of real roots, and the number of roots in an interval results from [[Sturm's theorem]], but the methods based on [[Descartes' rule of signs]] and its extensions\u2014[[Budan's theorem|Budan's]] and [[Vincent's theorem]]s\u2014are generally more efficient. For root finding, all proceed by reducing the size of the intervals in which roots are searched until getting intervals containing zero or one root. Then the intervals containing one root may be further reduced for getting a quadratic convergence of [[Newton's method]] to the isolated roots. The main [[computer algebra system]]s ([[Maple (software)|Maple]], [[Mathematica]], [[SageMath]]) have each a variant of this method as the default algorithm for the real roots of a polynomial.  \n\n===Finding one root===\n\nThe most widely used method for computing a root is [[Newton's method]], which consists of the iterations of the computation of \n:<math>x_{n+1}=x_n-\\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)},</math>\nby starting from a well-chosen value <math>x_0.</math>\nIf {{mvar|f}} is a polynomial, the computation is faster when using [[Horner rule]] for computing the polynomial and its derivative. \n\nThe convergence is generally [[quadratic convergence|quadratic]], it may converge much slowly or even not converge at all. In particular, if the polynomial has no real root, and <math>x_0</math> is real, then Newton's method cannot converge. However, if the polynomial has a real root, which is larger than the larger real root of its derivative, then Newton's method converges quadratically to this largest root if <math>x_0</math> is larger that this larger root (there are easy ways for computing an upper bound of the roots, see [[Properties of polynomial roots]]). This is the starting point of [[Horner method]] for computing the roots.\n\nWhen one root {{mvar|r}} has been found, one may use [[Euclidean division of polynomials|Euclidean division]] for removing the factor {{math|''x'' \u2013 ''r''}} from the polynomial. Computing a root of the resulting quotient, and repeating the process provides, in principle, a way for computing all roots. However, this iterative scheme is numerically unstable; the approximation errors accumulate during the successive factorizations, so that the last roots are determined with a polynomial that deviates widely from a factor of the original polynomial. To reduce this error, one may, for each root that is found, restart Newton's method with the original polynomial, and this approximate root as starting value. \n\nHowever, there is no warranty that this will allow finding all roots. In fact, the problem of finding the roots of a polynomial from its coefficients is in general highly [[ill-conditioned]]. This is illustrated by \n[[Wilkinson's polynomial]]: the roots of this polynomial of degree 20 are the 20 first positive integers; changing the last bit of the 32-bit representation of one of its coefficient (equal to \u2013210) produces a polynomial with only 10 real roots and 10 complex roots with imaginary parts larger than 0.6. \n\nClosely related to Newton's method are [[Halley's method]] and [[Laguerre's method]]. Both use the polynomial and its two first derivations for an iterative process that has a [[cubic convergence]]. Combining two consecutive steps of these methods into a single test, one gets a [[rate of convergence]] of 9, at the cost of 6 polynomial evaluations (with Horner rule). On the other hand, combining three steps of Newtons method gives a rate of convergence of 8 at the cost of the same number of polynomial evaluation. This gives a slight advantage to these methods (less clear for Laguerre's method, as a square root has to be computed at each step).\n\nWhen applying these methods to polynomials with real coefficients and real starting points, Newton's and Halley's method stay inside the real number line. One has to choose complex starting points to find complex roots. In contrast, the Laguerre method with a square root in its evaluation will leave the real axis of its own accord.\n\nAnother class of methods is based on converting the problem of finding polynomial roots to the problem of finding eigenvalues of the [[companion matrix]] of the polynomial. In principle, one can use any [[eigenvalue algorithm]] to find the roots of the polynomial. However, for efficiency reasons one prefers methods that employ the structure of the matrix, that is, can be implemented in matrix-free form. Among these methods are the [[power method]], whose application to the transpose of the companion matrix is the classical [[Bernoulli's method]] to find the root of greatest modulus. The [[inverse power method]] with shifts, which finds some smallest root first, is what drives the complex (''cpoly'') variant of the [[Jenkins\u2013Traub algorithm]] and gives it its numerical stability. Additionally, it is insensitive to multiple roots and has fast convergence with order <math>1+\\varphi\\approx 2.6</math> (where <math>\\varphi</math> is the [[golden ratio]]) even in the presence of clustered roots. This fast convergence comes with a cost of three polynomial evaluations per step, resulting in a residual of {{math|''O''({{!}}''f''(''x''){{!}}<sup>2+3''\u03c6''</sup>)}}, that is a slower convergence than with three steps of Newton's method.\n\n===Finding roots in pairs===\nIf the given polynomial only has real coefficients, one may wish to avoid computations with complex numbers. To that effect, one has to find quadratic factors for pairs of conjugate complex roots. The application of the [[multidimensional Newton's method]] to this task results in [[Bairstow's method]].\n\nThe real variant of [[Jenkins\u2013Traub algorithm]] is an improvement of this method.\n\n===Finding all roots at once===\nThe simple [[Durand\u2013Kerner method|Durand\u2013Kerner]] and the slightly more complicated [[Aberth method]] simultaneously find all of the roots using only simple [[complex number]] arithmetic. Accelerated algorithms for multi-point evaluation and interpolation similar to the [[fast Fourier transform]] can help speed them up for large degrees of the polynomial. It is advisable to choose an asymmetric, but evenly distributed set of initial points. The implementation of this method in the [[free software]] [[MPSolve]] is a reference for its efficiency and its accuracy.\n\nAnother method with this style is the [[Graeffe's method|Dandelin\u2013Gr\u00e4ffe method]] (sometimes also ascribed to [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]]), which uses [[polynomial transformations]] to repeatedly and implicitly square the roots. This greatly magnifies variances in the roots. Applying [[Vieta's formulas|Vi\u00e8te's formulas]], one obtains easy approximations for the modulus of the roots, and with some more effort, for the roots themselves.\n\n===Exclusion and enclosure methods===\nSeveral fast tests exist that tell if a segment of the real line or a region of the complex plane contains no roots. By bounding the modulus of the roots and recursively subdividing the initial region indicated by these bounds, one can isolate small regions that may contain roots and then apply other methods to locate them exactly.\n\nAll these methods involve finding the coefficients of shifted and scaled versions of the polynomial. For large degrees, [[fast Fourier transform|FFT]]-based accelerated methods become viable.\n\nFor real roots, see next sections.\n\nThe [[Lehmer\u2013Schur algorithm]] uses the [[Lehmer\u2013Schur algorithm#Schur\u2013Cohn test|Schur\u2013Cohn test]] for circles; a variant, [[Lehmer\u2013Schur algorithm#Wilf's global bisection algorithm|Wilf's global bisection algorithm]] uses a winding number computation for rectangular regions in the complex plane.\n\nThe [[splitting circle method]] uses FFT-based polynomial transformations to find large-degree factors corresponding to clusters of roots. The precision of the factorization is maximized using a Newton-type iteration. This method is useful for finding the roots of polynomials of high degree to arbitrary precision; it has almost optimal complexity in this setting.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Real-root isolation===\n{{main|Real-root isolation}}\n\nFinding the real roots of a polynomial with real coefficients is a problem that has received much attention since the beginning of 19th century, and is still an active domain of research. Most root-finding algorithms can find some real roots, but cannot certify having found all the roots. Methods for finding all complex roots, such as [[Aberth method]] can provide the real roots. However, because of the numerical instability of polynomials (see [[Wilkinson's polynomial]]), they may need [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]] for deciding which roots are real. Moreover, they compute all complex roots when only few are real.\n\nIt follows that the standard way of computing real roots is to compute first disjoint intervals, called ''isolating intervals'', such that each one contains exactly one real root, and together they contain all the roots. This computation is called ''real-root isolation''. Having isolating interval, one may use fast numerical methods, such as [[Newton's method]] for improving the precision of the result.\n\nThe oldest complete algorithm for real-root isolation results from [[Sturm's theorem]]. However, it appears to be much less efficient than the methods based on [[Descartes' rule of signs]] and [[Vincent's theorem]]. These methods divide into two main classes, one using [[continued fraction]]s and the other using bisection. Both method have been dramatically improved since the beginning of 21st century. With these improvements they reach a [[computational complexity]] that is similar to that of the best algorithms for computing all  the roots (even when all roots are real). \n\nThese algorithms have been implemented and are available in [[Mathematica]] (continued fraction method) and [[Maple (software)|Maple]] (bisection method). Both implementations can routinely find the real roots of polynomials of degree higher than 1,000.\n\n===Finding multiple roots of polynomials===\n{{main article|Square-free factorization}}\nMost root-finding algorithms behave badly when there are [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiple roots]] or very close roots. However, for polynomials whose coefficients are exactly given as [[integer]]s or [[rational number]]s, there is an efficient method to factorize them into factors that have only simple roots and whose coefficients are also exactly given. This method, called '''[[square-free factorization]]''', is based on the multiple roots of a polynomial being the roots of the [[polynomial greatest common divisor|greatest common divisor]] of the polynomial and its derivative.\n\nThe square-free factorization of a polynomial ''p'' is a factorization <math>p=p_1p_2^2\\cdots p_k^k </math> where each <math>p_i</math> is either 1 or a polynomial without multiple roots, and two different <math>p_i</math> do not have any common root.\n\nAn efficient method to compute this factorization is [[Square-free factorization#Yun's algorithm|Yun's algorithm]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of root finding algorithms]]\n* {{annotated link|Broyden's method}}\n* {{annotated link|Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator}}\n* [[GNU Scientific Library]]\n* {{annotated link|Graeffe's method}}\n* {{annotated link|Lill's method}}\n* {{annotated link|MPSolve}}\n* {{annotated link|Multiplicity (mathematics)}}\n* [[Nth root algorithm|{{math|''n''}}th root algorithm]]\n* {{annotated link|System of polynomial equations}}\n* {{annotated link|Kantorovich theorem}}\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n'''Sources'''\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book |last1=Press |first1=W.

A [[zero of a function|zero]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f''}}, from the [[real number]]s to real numbers or from the [[complex number]]s to the complex numbers, is a number {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 0}}. As, generally, the zeroes of a function cannot be computed exactly nor expressed in [[closed form expression|closed form]], root-finding algorithms provide approximations to zeroes, expressed either as [[floating point]] numbers or as small isolating [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]],  or [[disk (mathematics)|disks]] for complex roots (an interval or disk output being equivalent to an approximate output together with an error bound).\n\n[[equation solving|Solving an equation]] {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''g''(''x'')}} is the same as finding the roots of the function {{math|1=''h''(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') \u2013 ''g''(''x'')}}. Thus root-finding algorithms allow solving any [[equation (mathematics)|equation]] defined by continuous functions. However, most root-finding algorithms do not guarantee that they will find all the roots; in particular, if such an algorithm does not find any root, that does not mean that no root exists. \n\nMost numerical root-finding methods use [[iteration]], producing a [[sequence]] of numbers that hopefully converge towards the root as a  [[Limit of a sequence|limit]]. They require one or more ''initial guesses'' of the root as starting values, then each iteration of the algorithm produces a successively more accurate approximation to the root.   Since the iteration must be stopped at some point these methods produce an approximation to the root, not an exact solution.    Many methods compute subsequent values by evaluating an auxiliary function on the preceding values. The limit is thus a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the auxiliary function, which is chosen for having the roots of the original equation as fixed points, and for converging rapidly to these fixed points.\n\nThe behaviour of general root-finding algorithms is studied in [[numerical analysis]]. However, for polynomials, root-finding study belongs generally to [[computer algebra]], since algebraic properties of polynomials are fundamental for the most efficient algorithms. The efficiency of an algorithm may depend dramatically on the characteristics of the given functions. For example, many algorithms use the [[derivative]] of the input function, while others work on every [[continuous function]]. In general, numerical algorithms are not guaranteed to find all the roots of a function, so failing to find a root does not prove that there is no root. However, for [[polynomial]]s, there are specific algorithms that use algebraic properties for certifying that no root is missed, and locating the roots in separate intervals (or [[disk (mathematics)|disks]] for complex roots) that are small enough to ensure the convergence of numerical methods (typically [[Newton's method]]) to the unique root so located.\n\n== Bracketing methods ==\n\nBracketing methods determine successively smaller intervals (brackets) that contain a root. When the interval is small enough, then a root has been found. They generally use the [[intermediate value theorem]], which asserts that if a continuous function has values of opposite signs at the end points of an interval, then the function has at least one root in the interval. Therefore, they require to start with an interval such that the function takes opposite signs at the end points of the interval. However, in the case of [[polynomial]]s there are other methods ([[Descartes' rule of signs]], [[Budan's theorem]] and [[Sturm's theorem]]) for getting information on the number of roots in an interval. They lead to efficient algorithms for [[real-root isolation]] of polynomials, which ensure finding all real roots with a guaranteed accuracy.\n\n=== Bisection method ===\nThe simplest root-finding algorithm is the [[bisection method]]. Let {{math|''f''}} be a [[continuous function]], for which one knows an interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} such that  {{math|''f''(''a'')}} and {{math|''f''(''b'')}} have opposite signs (a bracket). Let {{math|1=''c'' = (''a'' +''b'')/2}} be the middle of the interval (the midpoint or the point that bisects the interval). Then either {{math|''f''(''a'')}} and {{math|''f''(''c'')}}, or {{math|''f''(''c'')}} and {{math|''f''(''b'')}} have opposite signs, and one has divided by two the size of the interval. Although the bisection method is robust, it gains one and only one [[bit]] of accuracy with each iteration. Other methods, under appropriate conditions, can gain accuracy faster.\n\n=== False position (''regula falsi'') ===\nThe [[false position method]], also called the ''regula falsi'' method, is similar to the bisection method, but instead of using bisection search's middle of the interval it uses the [[x-intercept|{{math|''x''}}-intercept]] of the line that connects the plotted function values at the endpoints of the interval, that is \n:<math>c= \\frac{af(b)-bf(a)}{f(b)-f(a)}.</math>\n\nFalse position is similar to the [[secant method]], except that, instead of retaining the last two points, it makes sure to keep one point on either side of the root.  The false position method can be faster than the bisection method and will never diverge like the secant method; however, it may fail to converge in some naive implementations due to roundoff errors that may lead to a wrong sign for {{math|''f''(''c'')}}; typically, this may occur if the [[rate of variation]] of {{mvar|f}} is large in the neighborhood of the root.\n\n[[Ridders' method]] is a variant of the false position method that uses the value of function at the midpoint of the interval, for getting a function with the same root, to which the false position method is applied. This gives a faster convergence with a similar robustness.\n\n== Interpolation ==\n\nMany root-finding processes work by [[interpolation]]. This consists in using the last computed approximate values of the root for approximating the function by a [[polynomial]] of low degree, which takes the same values at these approximate roots. Then the root of the polynomial is computed and used as a new approximate value of the root of the function, and the process is iterated.\n\nTwo values allow interpolating a function by a polynomial of degree one (that is approximating the graph of the function by a line). This is the basis of the [[secant method]]. Three values define a [[quadratic function]], which approximates the graph of the function by a [[parabola]]. This is [[Muller's method]].\n\n''Regula falsi'' is also an interpolation method, which differs secant method by using, for interpolating by a line, two points that are not necessarily the last two computed points.\n\n== Iterative methods ==\nAlthough all root-finding algorithms proceed by [[iteration]], an [[iterative method|iterative]] root-finding method generally uses a specific type of iteration, consisting of defining an auxiliary function, which is applied to the last computed approximations of a root for getting a new approximation. The iteration stops when a [[fixed-point iteration|fixed point]] ([[up to]] the desired precision) of the auxiliary function is reached, that is when the new computed value is sufficiently close to the preceding ones.\n\n=== Newton's method (and similar derivative-based methods) ===\n[[Newton's method]] assumes the function ''f'' to have a continuous [[derivative]]. Newton's method may not converge if started too far away from a root. However, when it does converge, it is faster than the bisection method, and is usually quadratic. Newton's method is also important because it readily generalizes to higher-dimensional problems. Newton-like methods with higher orders of convergence are the [[Householder's method]]s.

Again, convergence is asymptotically faster than the secant method, but inverse quadratic interpolation often behaves poorly when the iterates are not close to the root.\n\n==Combinations of methods==\n\n=== Brent's method ===\n[[Brent's method]] is a combination of the bisection method, the secant method and [[inverse quadratic interpolation]]. At every iteration, Brent's method decides which method out of these three is likely to do best, and proceeds by doing a step according to that method. This gives a robust and fast method, which therefore enjoys considerable popularity.\n\n== Roots of polynomials ==\n\nFinding roots of [[polynomial]] is a long-standing problem that has been the object of much research throughout history. A testament to this is that up until the 19th century [[algebra]] meant essentially [[theory of equations|theory of polynomial equations]].\n\nFinding the root of a [[linear polynomial]] (degree one) is easy and needs only one division. For [[quadratic polynomial]]s (degree two), the [[quadratic formula]] produces a solution, but its numerical evaluation may require some care for ensuring [[numerical stability]].

Also, even with a good approximation, when one evaluates a polynomial at an approximate root, one may get a result that is far to be close to zero. For example, if a polynomial of degree 20 (the degree of Wilkinson's polynomial) has a root close to 10, the derivative of the polynomial at the root may be of the order of <math>10^{20};</math> this implies that an error of <math>10^{-10}</math> on the value of the root may produce a value of the polynomial at the approximate root that is of the order of <math>10^{10}.</math>\n\nFor avoiding these problems, methods have been elaborated, which compute all roots simultaneously, to any desired accuracy. Presently the most efficient method is [[Aberth method]]. A [[free software|free]] implementation is available under the name of [[MPSolve]]. This is a reference implementation, which can find routinely the roots of polynomials of degree larger than 1,000, with more than 1,000 significant decimal digits.\n\nThe methods for computing all roots may be used for computing real roots. However, it may be difficult to decide whether a root with a small imaginary part is real or not. Moreover, as the number of the real roots is, on the average, the logarithm of the degree, it is a waste of computer resources to compute the non-real roots when one is interested in real roots. \n\nThe oldest method for computing the number of real roots, and the number of roots in an interval results from [[Sturm's theorem]], but the methods based on [[Descartes' rule of signs]] and its extensions\u2014[[Budan's theorem|Budan's]] and [[Vincent's theorem]]s\u2014are generally more efficient. For root finding, all proceed by reducing the size of the intervals in which roots are searched until getting intervals containing zero or one root. Then the intervals containing one root may be further reduced for getting a quadratic convergence of [[Newton's method]] to the isolated roots. The main [[computer algebra system]]s ([[Maple (software)|Maple]], [[Mathematica]], [[SageMath]]) have each a variant of this method as the default algorithm for the real roots of a polynomial.  \n\n===Finding one root===\n\nThe most widely used method for computing a root is [[Newton's method]], which consists of the iterations of the computation of \n:<math>x_{n+1}=x_n-\\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)},</math>\nby starting from a well-chosen value <math>x_0.</math>\nIf {{mvar|f}} is a polynomial, the computation is faster when using [[Horner rule]] for computing the polynomial and its derivative. \n\nThe convergence is generally [[quadratic convergence|quadratic]], it may converge much slowly or even not converge at all. In particular, if the polynomial has no real root, and <math>x_0</math> is real, then Newton's method cannot converge. However, if the polynomial has a real root, which is larger than the larger real root of its derivative, then Newton's method converges quadratically to this largest root if <math>x_0</math> is larger that this larger root (there are easy ways for computing an upper bound of the roots, see [[Properties of polynomial roots]]). This is the starting point of [[Horner method]] for computing the roots.\n\nWhen one root {{mvar|r}} has been found, one may use [[Euclidean division of polynomials|Euclidean division]] for removing the factor {{math|''x'' \u2013 ''r''}} from the polynomial. Computing a root of the resulting quotient, and repeating the process provides, in principle, a way for computing all roots. However, this iterative scheme is numerically unstable; the approximation errors accumulate during the successive factorizations, so that the last roots are determined with a polynomial that deviates widely from a factor of the original polynomial. To reduce this error, one may, for each root that is found, restart Newton's method with the original polynomial, and this approximate root as starting value. \n\nHowever, there is no warranty that this will allow finding all roots. In fact, the problem of finding the roots of a polynomial from its coefficients is in general highly [[ill-conditioned]]. This is illustrated by \n[[Wilkinson's polynomial]]: the roots of this polynomial of degree 20 are the 20 first positive integers; changing the last bit of the 32-bit representation of one of its coefficient (equal to \u2013210) produces a polynomial with only 10 real roots and 10 complex roots with imaginary parts larger than 0.6. \n\nClosely related to Newton's method are [[Halley's method]] and [[Laguerre's method]]. Both use the polynomial and its two first derivations for an iterative process that has a [[cubic convergence]]. Combining two consecutive steps of these methods into a single test, one gets a [[rate of convergence]] of 9, at the cost of 6 polynomial evaluations (with Horner rule). On the other hand, combining three steps of Newtons method gives a rate of convergence of 8 at the cost of the same number of polynomial evaluation. This gives a slight advantage to these methods (less clear for Laguerre's method, as a square root has to be computed at each step).\n\nWhen applying these methods to polynomials with real coefficients and real starting points, Newton's and Halley's method stay inside the real number line. One has to choose complex starting points to find complex roots. In contrast, the Laguerre method with a square root in its evaluation will leave the real axis of its own accord.\n\nAnother class of methods is based on converting the problem of finding polynomial roots to the problem of finding eigenvalues of the [[companion matrix]] of the polynomial. In principle, one can use any [[eigenvalue algorithm]] to find the roots of the polynomial. However, for efficiency reasons one prefers methods that employ the structure of the matrix, that is, can be implemented in matrix-free form. Among these methods are the [[power method]], whose application to the transpose of the companion matrix is the classical [[Bernoulli's method]] to find the root of greatest modulus. The [[inverse power method]] with shifts, which finds some smallest root first, is what drives the complex (''cpoly'') variant of the [[Jenkins\u2013Traub algorithm]] and gives it its numerical stability. Additionally, it is insensitive to multiple roots and has fast convergence with order <math>1+\\varphi\\approx 2.6</math> (where <math>\\varphi</math> is the [[golden ratio]]) even in the presence of clustered roots. This fast convergence comes with a cost of three polynomial evaluations per step, resulting in a residual of {{math|''O''({{!}}''f''(''x''){{!}}<sup>2+3''\u03c6''</sup>)}}, that is a slower convergence than with three steps of Newton's method.\n\n===Finding roots in pairs===\nIf the given polynomial only has real coefficients, one may wish to avoid computations with complex numbers. To that effect, one has to find quadratic factors for pairs of conjugate complex roots. The application of the [[multidimensional Newton's method]] to this task results in [[Bairstow's method]].\n\nThe real variant of [[Jenkins\u2013Traub algorithm]] is an improvement of this method.\n\n===Finding all roots at once===\nThe simple [[Durand\u2013Kerner method|Durand\u2013Kerner]] and the slightly more complicated [[Aberth method]] simultaneously find all of the roots using only simple [[complex number]] arithmetic. Accelerated algorithms for multi-point evaluation and interpolation similar to the [[fast Fourier transform]] can help speed them up for large degrees of the polynomial. It is advisable to choose an asymmetric, but evenly distributed set of initial points. The implementation of this method in the [[free software]] [[MPSolve]] is a reference for its efficiency and its accuracy.\n\nAnother method with this style is the [[Graeffe's method|Dandelin\u2013Gr\u00e4ffe method]] (sometimes also ascribed to [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]]), which uses [[polynomial transformations]] to repeatedly and implicitly square the roots. This greatly magnifies variances in the roots. Applying [[Vieta's formulas|Vi\u00e8te's formulas]], one obtains easy approximations for the modulus of the roots, and with some more effort, for the roots themselves.\n\n===Exclusion and enclosure methods===\nSeveral fast tests exist that tell if a segment of the real line or a region of the complex plane contains no roots. By bounding the modulus of the roots and recursively subdividing the initial region indicated by these bounds, one can isolate small regions that may contain roots and then apply other methods to locate them exactly.\n\nAll these methods involve finding the coefficients of shifted and scaled versions of the polynomial. For large degrees, [[fast Fourier transform|FFT]]-based accelerated methods become viable.\n\nFor real roots, see next sections.\n\nThe [[Lehmer\u2013Schur algorithm]] uses the [[Lehmer\u2013Schur algorithm#Schur\u2013Cohn test|Schur\u2013Cohn test]] for circles; a variant, [[Lehmer\u2013Schur algorithm#Wilf's global bisection algorithm|Wilf's global bisection algorithm]] uses a winding number computation for rectangular regions in the complex plane.\n\nThe [[splitting circle method]] uses FFT-based polynomial transformations to find large-degree factors corresponding to clusters of roots. The precision of the factorization is maximized using a Newton-type iteration. This method is useful for finding the roots of polynomials of high degree to arbitrary precision; it has almost optimal complexity in this setting.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Real-root isolation===\n{{main|Real-root isolation}}\n\nFinding the real roots of a polynomial with real coefficients is a problem that has received much attention since the beginning of 19th century, and is still an active domain of research. Most root-finding algorithms can find some real roots, but cannot certify having found all the roots. Methods for finding all complex roots, such as [[Aberth method]] can provide the real roots. However, because of the numerical instability of polynomials (see [[Wilkinson's polynomial]]), they may need [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]] for deciding which roots are real. Moreover, they compute all complex roots when only few are real.\n\nIt follows that the standard way of computing real roots is to compute first disjoint intervals, called ''isolating intervals'', such that each one contains exactly one real root, and together they contain all the roots. This computation is called ''real-root isolation''. Having isolating interval, one may use fast numerical methods, such as [[Newton's method]] for improving the precision of the result.\n\nThe oldest complete algorithm for real-root isolation results from [[Sturm's theorem]]. However, it appears to be much less efficient than the methods based on [[Descartes' rule of signs]] and [[Vincent's theorem]]. These methods divide into two main classes, one using [[continued fraction]]s and the other using bisection. Both method have been dramatically improved since the beginning of 21st century. With these improvements they reach a [[computational complexity]] that is similar to that of the best algorithms for computing all  the roots (even when all roots are real). \n\nThese algorithms have been implemented and are available in [[Mathematica]] (continued fraction method) and [[Maple (software)|Maple]] (bisection method). Both implementations can routinely find the real roots of polynomials of degree higher than 1,000.\n\n===Finding multiple roots of polynomials===\n{{main article|Square-free factorization}}\nMost root-finding algorithms behave badly when there are [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiple roots]] or very close roots. However, for polynomials whose coefficients are exactly given as [[integer]]s or [[rational number]]s, there is an efficient method to factorize them into factors that have only simple roots and whose coefficients are also exactly given. This method, called '''[[square-free factorization]]''', is based on the multiple roots of a polynomial being the roots of the [[polynomial greatest common divisor|greatest common divisor]] of the polynomial and its derivative.\n\nThe square-free factorization of a polynomial ''p'' is a factorization <math>p=p_1p_2^2\\cdots p_k^k </math> where each <math>p_i</math> is either 1 or a polynomial without multiple roots, and two different <math>p_i</math> do not have any common root.\n\nAn efficient method to compute this factorization is [[Square-free factorization#Yun's algorithm|Yun's algorithm]].\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* {{annotated link|Broyden's method}}\n* {{annotated link|Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator}}\n* [[GNU Scientific Library]]\n* {{annotated link|Graeffe's method}}\n* {{annotated link|Lill's method}}\n* [[List of root finding algorithms]]\n* {{annotated link|MPSolve}}\n* {{annotated link|Multiplicity (mathematics)}}\n* [[Nth root algorithm|{{math|''n''}}th root algorithm]]\n* {{annotated link|System of polynomial equations}}\n* {{annotated link|Kantorovich theorem}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n'''Sources'''\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book |last1=Press |first1=W.
