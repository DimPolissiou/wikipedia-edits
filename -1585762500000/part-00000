He played [[college football]] at [[Newberry Wolves football|Newberry]]. Bostick was signed by the [[Green Bay Packers]] as an [[undrafted free agent]] in 2012. During the 2014 playoffs, he costed the packers a trip to the super bowl by dropping the ball from an onside kick against the Seahawks. This costed the Packers a trip to the super bowl and probably one of the most exciting Super Bowl match ups between Aaron Rodgers and the Packers vs Tom Brady and the patriots. He has also been a member of the [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Arizona Cardinals]] and [[New York Jets]].\n\n==Early life and college career==\nBostick was born in [[Florence, South Carolina]] and graduated from [[West Florence High School]] in 2007. He then attended [[Newberry College]], a [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] school. After redshirting his freshman year, Bostick played at Newberry as [[wide receiver]] from the 2008 to 2011 seasons. In 39 games, he started 24 and made 136 receptions for 1,935 yards and 19 touchdowns. Bostick also played basketball at Newberry for the second half of his junior season.<ref name=\"Packers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.packers.com/team/roster/Brandon-Bostick/855d5326-2230-4a0b-9f22-20b58a40a56b|title=Brandon Bostick|publisher=Green Bay Packers|accessdate=January 19, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Newberry\">{{cite web|title=Brandon Bostick|url=http://newberryathleticsite.com/profile.asp?playerID=1228|publisher=Newberry College|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118202415/http://newberryathleticsite.com/profile.asp?playerID=1228|archivedate=November 18, 2011}}</ref> He was a [[sports management]] major at Newberry.<ref name=\"Newberry\"/>\n\n==Professional career==\n{{nfl predraft\n|    height ft = 6\n|    height in = 3\n|       weight = 243\n|         dash = 4.59\n|    ten split = 1.67\n| twenty split = 2.73\n|      shuttle = 4.25\n|   cone drill = 7.41\n|     vertical = 36\n|     broad ft = 10\n|     broad in = 1\n|        bench = 19\n|    wonderlic = \n|     arm span = \n|    hand span = \n|         note = All values are from [[Pro Day]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfldraftscout.com/ratings/dsprofile.php?pyid=104009&draftyear=2012&genpos=fb|title=Brandon Bostick - Newberry, FB : 2012 NFL Draft Scout Player Profile|work=NFLDraftScout.com|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Green Bay Packers===\n[[File:Brandon Bostick in 2014.jpg|thumb|Bostick at Packers training camp in 2014.]]\nHe was signed by the Packers as an [[undrafted free agent]] on May 30, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brandon Bostick signs contract with Green Bay Packers|url=http://www.newberrywolves.com/fb/news/2011-12/5278/brandon-bostick-signs-contract-with-green-bay-packers/|publisher=Newberry College|accessdate=January 20, 2015|date=May 30, 2012}}</ref> Bostick spent his entire rookie season in 2012 on the practice squad.<ref name=\"Packers\"/>\n\nPlaying primarily on special teams, Bostick made his NFL debut on September 15, 2013 against [[2013 Washington Redskins season|Washington]].<ref name=\"Packers detailed\">{{citation|title=Brandon Bostick|url=http://prod.static.packers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/docs/2014/2014-packers-83-268.pdf|website=Packers 2014 Media Guide|publisher=Green Bay Packers|pages=92\u201393|date=2014}}</ref> He recorded his first NFL touchdown catch on November 10, 2013 against the [[2013 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], on a 22-yard pass from [[Scott Tolzien]], in a play that was also Tolzien's first career touchdown pass.<ref name=\"Packers\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Reischel|first1=Rob|title=Scott Tolzien shifts from practice squad to starter|url=http://www.jsonline.com/sports/packers/scott-tolzien-shifts-from-practice-squad-to-starter-b99139504z1-231682991.html|website=Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel|accessdate=January 20, 2015|date=November 12, 2013}}</ref> Bostick finished the 2013 season with 7 receptions for 120 yards and a touchdown in 11 games.<ref name=\"Packers\"/> He missed the [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Classic]] due to a concussion suffered during the November 24 game.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings, and a protagonist of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Frodo is a [[hobbit]] of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] who inherits the [[One Ring]] from his cousin [[Bilbo Baggins]] and undertakes the quest to destroy it in the fires of [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]]. He is mentioned in Tolkien's posthumously published works, ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. \n\nFrodo is repeatedly wounded during the quest, and becomes increasingly burdened by the Ring as it nears Mordor. He changes, too, growing in understanding and compassion, and avoiding violence.\n\nFrodo's name comes from the [[Old English]] name ''[[Froda|Fr\u00f3da]]'', meaning \"wise by experience\". Commentators have written that he combines courage, selflessness, and fidelity, and that as a good character, he seems unexciting but grows through his quest, an unheroic person who reaches heroic stature.\n\n==Internal history==\n\n===Background===\n\nIn ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the protagonist [[Bilbo Baggins]] is taken by the Wizard Gandalf and a party of [[Dwarves (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] from his safe home, [[Bag End]], in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] across the [[Misty Mountains]] and the dark forest of [[Mirkwood]] to recapture the Dwarves' ancient home and treasure under the Lonely Mountain. The treasure is guarded by a [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]], [[Smaug]]. Through many adventures, Smaug is killed and Bilbo returns home with a substantial portion of the treasure. He lives the life of a rich eccentric for many years.\n\nFrodo is introduced in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as Bilbo's relative and adoptive heir. The chapter \"A Long-expected Party\" relates that Frodo's parents Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck had been killed in a boating accident when Frodo was 12; Frodo spent the next nine years living with his maternal family, the Brandybucks in Brandy Hall. At the age of 21 he was adopted by his cousin,{{efn|Although Frodo referred to Bilbo as his \"uncle\", they were in fact first ''and'' second cousins, once removed either way (his paternal great-great-uncle's son's son and his maternal great-aunt's son).}} Bilbo, who brought him to live at Bag End. He and Bilbo shared the same birthday, the 22nd of 'September'. Bilbo introduced Frodo to the [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish languages]] , and they often went on long walking trips together.\n\n===''The Fellowship of the Ring''===\n\nFrodo comes of age as Bilbo leaves the Shire for good on his one hundred and eleventh birthday. Frodo inherits Bag End and [[One Ring|Bilbo's ring]]. [[Gandalf]], at this time, is not certain about the origin of the ring, so he warns Frodo to avoid using it and to keep it secret. Frodo keeps the Ring hidden for the next 17 years, and the Ring gives him the same longevity it gave Bilbo. Gandalf returns to prove to him that it is the One Ring of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], who seeks to recover and use it to conquer [[Middle-earth]].\n\nRealizing that he is a danger to the Shire as long as he remains there with the Ring, Frodo decides to take it to [[Rivendell]], home of [[Elrond]], a mighty [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]-lord. He leaves with three companions: his gardener [[Samwise Gamgee]] and his cousins [[Merry Brandybuck]] and [[Pippin Took]]. They escape just in time, for Sauron's most powerful servants, the Nine [[Nazg\u00fbl]], have entered the Shire as Black Riders, looking for Bilbo and the Ring. They follow Frodo's trail across the Shire and nearly intercept him.\n\nThe hobbits escape the Black Riders by travelling through the [[Old Forest]]. They are waylaid by the magic of [[Old Man Willow]], but rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]], who gives them shelter and guides them on their way. They are caught in fog on the Barrow Downs by [[Barrow-wight]]s and are entranced under a spell. Frodo breaks loose from the spell, attacks the barrow-wight and summons Bombadil, who again rescues the hobbits and sets them on their way.\n\nAt the ''Prancing Pony'' inn in the village of [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], Frodo receives a delayed letter from Gandalf, and meets a man who calls himself Strider, a [[Ranger of the North]]; his real name is [[Aragorn]]. The One Ring slips onto Frodo's finger inadvertently in the inn's common room, turning Frodo invisible. This attracts the attention of Sauron's agents, who ransack the hobbits' rooms in the night. The group, under Strider's guidance, flees through the marshes.\n\nWhile encamped on a hill, they are attacked by five Nazg\u00fbl. The chief of the Nazg\u00fbl stabs Frodo with a Morgul-blade; Aragorn routs them with fire. A piece of the blade remains in Frodo's shoulder and, working its way towards his heart, threatens to turn him into a wraith under control of the Nazgul. With the help of his companions and an Elf-lord, [[Glorfindel]], Frodo is able to evade the Nazg\u00fbl and reach Rivendell. Nearly overcome by his wound, he is healed over time by Elrond.\n\nThe [[Council of Elrond]] meets in Rivendell and resolves to destroy the Ring by casting it into [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]], the realm of Sauron. Frodo, realizing that he is destined for this task, steps forward to be the [[Ring-bearer]]. A [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of nine companions]] is formed to guide and protect him: the hobbits, Gandalf, Aragorn, the [[dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarf]] [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]], the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elf]] [[Legolas]], and [[Boromir]], a man of [[Gondor]]. Together they set out from Rivendell. Frodo is armed with [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]], Bilbo's Elvish knife; he wears Bilbo's coat of Dwarf mail made of ''[[mithril]]''. The company, seeking a way through the Misty Mountains, tries the Pass of Caradhras, but abandons it in favour of the [[Moria (Middle-earth)|mines of Moria]]. In Moria Frodo is stabbed by an [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orc]]-spear, but his coat of ''mithril'' armour saves his life. They are led through the mines by Gandalf, until he is killed battling a [[Balrog]]. Aragorn leads them out to [[Lothl\u00f3rien]]. There [[Galadriel]] gives Frodo an Elven cloak and a phial carrying the Light of [[E\u00e4rendil]] to aid him on his dangerous quest.\n\nThe Fellowship travel by boat down the Anduin River and reach the hills of Parth Galen. There, Boromir, succumbing to the lure of the Ring, tries to take the ring by force from Frodo. Frodo escapes by putting on the Ring and becoming invisible. This breaks the Fellowship; the company is scattered by invading Orcs. Frodo chooses to continue the quest alone, but Sam follows his master, joining him on the journey to Mordor.\n\n===''The Two Towers''===\nFrodo and Sam make their way through the wilds, followed by the creature [[Gollum]], who has been tracking the Fellowship since Moria, seeking to reclaim the Ring. Gollum attacks the hobbits, but Frodo subdues him with Sting. He takes pity on Gollum and spares his life, binding him to a promise to guide them through the dead marshes to the Black Gate, which Gollum does. They find the gate impassable, but Gollum says that there is \"another way\" into Mordor, and Frodo, over Sam's objections, allows him to lead them south into [[Ithilien]]. There they meet [[Faramir]], younger brother of Boromir, who takes them to Henneth Ann\u00fbn. Frodo allows Gollum to be captured by Faramir, saving Gollum's life but leaving him feeling betrayed by his \"master\". Faramir provisions the hobbits and allows them to go on their way, but warns Frodo to beware of Gollum's treachery.\n\nThe three of them pass near Minas Morgul, where the pull of the Ring becomes almost unbearable. There they began the long climb up the Endless Stair, and at the top enter a tunnel, not knowing it is the home of the giant spider [[Shelob]]. Gollum hopes to deliver the hobbits to her and retake the Ring after she kills them. Shelob stings Frodo, rendering him unconscious, but Sam drives her off with Sting and the Phial of Galadriel. After attempting unsuccessfully to wake Frodo up, and unable to find any signs of life, Sam concludes that Frodo is dead and decides that his only option is to take the Ring and continue the quest. But he overhears orcs who find Frodo's body and learns that Frodo is not dead. The orcs take Frodo for questioning; Sam tries to follow but finds the door locked against him.\n\n===''The Return of the King''===\nSam rescues Frodo from the Orcs. After a brief confrontation in which Frodo becomes enraged that Sam has taken the Ring, Sam restores the Ring to Frodo. The two of them, dressed in scavenged Orc-armour, set off for Mount Doom, trailed by Gollum. They witness the plains of Mordor empty at the approach of the Armies of the West. As the Ring gets closer to its master, Frodo becomes progressively weaker as its influence grows. When they run out of water, they leave all unnecessary baggage behind to travel light. As they reach Mount Doom, Gollum reappears and attacks Frodo, who beats him back. While Sam fights with Gollum, Frodo enters the chasm in the volcano where Sauron forged the Ring. Here Frodo loses the will to destroy the Ring, and instead puts it on, claiming it for himself. Gollum pushes Sam aside and attacks the invisible Frodo, biting off his finger. As he dances around in elation, Gollum loses his balance and falls with the Ring into the fiery Cracks of Doom. The Ring is destroyed, and with it Sauron's power. Frodo and Sam are rescued by Gandalf and several [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]] as Mount Doom erupts.\n\nAfter reuniting with the Fellowship and attending Aragorn's coronation as King of Gondor, the four hobbits return to the Shire. They find the entire Shire in a state of upheaval. Saruman's agents\u2014both Hobbits and [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]\u2014have taken it over and started a destructive process of industrialization. Saruman governs the Shire in secret under the name of Sharkey until Frodo and his companions [[The Scouring of the Shire|lead a rebellion and defeat the intruders]]. Even after Saruman attempts to stab Frodo, Frodo lets him go.<ref group=T>''The Return of the King'', Book VI, VII, and VIII, pp. 315\u2013317 and 360\u2013363</ref> Frodo and his companions restore the Shire to its prior state of peace and goodwill. Frodo never completely recovers from the physical, emotional, and psychological wounds he suffered during the quest to destroy the ring. Two years after the Ring was destroyed, Frodo and Bilbo as Ring-bearers are granted passage to [[Valinor]], the [[Earthly Paradise|earthly paradise]] where Frodo might find peace.\n\n===\"The Sea-Bell\"===\n\n\"[[The Sea-Bell]]\" was published in Tolkien's 1962 collection of verse ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' with the sub-title ''Frodos Dream''. Tolkien suggests that this enigmatic [[narrative poem]] represents the despairing dreams that visited Frodo in the Shire in the years following the destruction of the Ring. It relates the unnamed speaker's journey to a mysterious land across the sea, where he tries but fails to make contact with the people who dwell there. He descends into despair and near-madness, eventually returning to his own country, to find himself utterly alienated from those he once knew.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n\nFrodo did not appear until the third draft of ''A Long-Expected Party'' (the first chapter of ''The Lord of the Rings''), when he was named Bingo, son of Bilbo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck.<ref group=T>''The Return of the Shadow'', Vol. VI in ''The History of Middle-earth'', p. 28\u201329.</ref> In the fourth draft, he was renamed Bingo Bolger-Baggins, son of Rollo Bolger and Primula Brandybuck.<ref group=T>''The Return of the Shadow'', pp. 36\u201337.</ref> Tolkien did not change the name to Frodo until the third phase of writing, when much of the narrative, as far as the hobbits' arrival in Rivendell, had already taken shape.<ref group=T>''The Return of the Shadow'', p. 309.</ref> Prior to this, the name \"Frodo\" had been used for the character who eventually became Pippin Took.<ref group=T>''The Return of the Shadow'', p. 267.</ref>\n\nIn early drafts of ''The Lord of the Rings'' the principal character is called Bingo Baggins; the name Frodo is given to another hobbit. In drafts of the final chapters of ''The Lord of the Rings'' published as ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'', Gandalf names Frodo ''Bronwe athan Harthad'' (\"Endurance Beyond Hope\"), after the destruction of the Ring. Tolkien states that Frodo's name in [[Westron]] was ''Maura Labingi''.<ref group=T>Tolkien, Christopher. ''The History of Middle-earth'', Volume XII, ''The Peoples of Middle-earth'', \"The Appendix on Languages\", pp. 48, 50.</ref> The [[Sindarin]] version was ''Iorhael'',<ref group=T>The name of Sam's son Frodo appears as ''Iorhael'' in the [[Tengwar]] version of the King's Letter to Sam. Christopher Tolkien, ''The History of Middle-earth'', Volume IX, ''Sauron Defeated'', \"The Epilogue\", pp. 117, 126, 128, 130, 131.</ref> (\"Old and Wise\"). In ''The Return of the King'' he is also called ''Daur'', Sindarin for \"noble\".<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]</ref>\n\n==Interpretations== \n\nFrodo is the only prominent hobbit whose name is not explained in Tolkien's Appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings''.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings, and a protagonist of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Frodo is a [[hobbit]] of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] who inherits the [[One Ring]] from his cousin [[Bilbo Baggins]] and undertakes the quest to destroy it in the fires of [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]]. He is mentioned in Tolkien's posthumously published works, ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. \n\nFrodo is repeatedly wounded during the quest, and becomes increasingly burdened by the Ring as it nears Mordor. He changes, too, growing in understanding and compassion, and avoiding violence.\n\nFrodo's name comes from the [[Old English]] name ''[[Froda|Fr\u00f3da]]'', meaning \"wise by experience\". Commentators have written that he combines courage, selflessness, and fidelity, and that as a good character, he seems unexciting but grows through his quest, an unheroic person who reaches heroic stature.\n\n==Internal history==\n\n===Background===\n\nIn ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the protagonist [[Bilbo Baggins]] is taken by the Wizard Gandalf and a party of [[Dwarves (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] from his safe home, [[Bag End]], in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] across the [[Misty Mountains]] and the dark forest of [[Mirkwood]] to recapture the Dwarves' ancient home and treasure under the Lonely Mountain. The treasure is guarded by a [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]], [[Smaug]]. Through many adventures, Smaug is killed and Bilbo returns home with a substantial portion of the treasure. He lives the life of a rich eccentric for many years.\n\nFrodo is introduced in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as Bilbo's relative and adoptive heir. The chapter \"A Long-expected Party\" relates that Frodo's parents Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck had been killed in a boating accident when Frodo was 12; Frodo spent the next nine years living with his maternal family, the Brandybucks in Brandy Hall. At the age of 21 he was adopted by his cousin,{{efn|Although Frodo referred to Bilbo as his \"uncle\", they were in fact first ''and'' second cousins, once removed either way (his paternal great-great-uncle's son's son and his maternal great-aunt's son).}} Bilbo, who brought him to live at Bag End. He and Bilbo shared the same birthday, the 22nd of 'September'. Bilbo introduced Frodo to the [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish languages]] , and they often went on long walking trips together.\n\n===''The Fellowship of the Ring''===\n\nFrodo comes of age as Bilbo leaves the Shire for good on his one hundred and eleventh birthday. Frodo inherits Bag End and [[One Ring|Bilbo's ring]]. [[Gandalf]], at this time, is not certain about the origin of the ring, so he warns Frodo to avoid using it and to keep it secret. Frodo keeps the Ring hidden for the next 17 years, and the Ring gives him the same longevity it gave Bilbo. Gandalf returns to prove to him that it is the One Ring of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], who seeks to recover and use it to conquer [[Middle-earth]].\n\nRealizing that he is a danger to the Shire as long as he remains there with the Ring, Frodo decides to take it to [[Rivendell]], home of [[Elrond]], a mighty [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]-lord. He leaves with three companions: his gardener [[Samwise Gamgee]] and his cousins [[Merry Brandybuck]] and [[Pippin Took]]. They escape just in time, for Sauron's most powerful servants, the Nine [[Nazg\u00fbl]], have entered the Shire as Black Riders, looking for Bilbo and the Ring. They follow Frodo's trail across the Shire and nearly intercept him.\n\nThe hobbits escape the Black Riders by travelling through the [[Old Forest]]. They are waylaid by the magic of [[Old Man Willow]], but rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]], who gives them shelter and guides them on their way. They are caught in fog on the Barrow Downs by [[Barrow-wight]]s and are entranced under a spell. Frodo breaks loose from the spell, attacks the barrow-wight and summons Bombadil, who again rescues the hobbits and sets them on their way.\n\nAt the ''Prancing Pony'' inn in the village of [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], Frodo receives a delayed letter from Gandalf, and meets a man who calls himself Strider, a [[Ranger of the North]]; his real name is [[Aragorn]]. The One Ring slips onto Frodo's finger inadvertently in the inn's common room, turning Frodo invisible. This attracts the attention of Sauron's agents, who ransack the hobbits' rooms in the night. The group, under Strider's guidance, flees through the marshes.\n\nWhile encamped on a hill, they are attacked by five Nazg\u00fbl. The chief of the Nazg\u00fbl stabs Frodo with a Morgul-blade; Aragorn routs them with fire. A piece of the blade remains in Frodo's shoulder and, working its way towards his heart, threatens to turn him into a wraith under control of the Nazgul. With the help of his companions and an Elf-lord, [[Glorfindel]], Frodo is able to evade the Nazg\u00fbl and reach Rivendell. Nearly overcome by his wound, he is healed over time by Elrond.\n\nThe [[Council of Elrond]] meets in Rivendell and resolves to destroy the Ring by casting it into [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]], the realm of Sauron. Frodo, realizing that he is destined for this task, steps forward to be the [[Ring-bearer]]. A [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of nine companions]] is formed to guide and protect him: the hobbits, Gandalf, Aragorn, the [[dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarf]] [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]], the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elf]] [[Legolas]], and [[Boromir]], a man of [[Gondor]]. Together they set out from Rivendell. Frodo is armed with [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]], Bilbo's Elvish knife; he wears Bilbo's coat of Dwarf mail made of ''[[mithril]]''. The company, seeking a way through the Misty Mountains, tries the Pass of Caradhras, but abandons it in favour of the [[Moria (Middle-earth)|mines of Moria]]. In Moria Frodo is stabbed by an [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orc]]-spear, but his coat of ''mithril'' armour saves his life. They are led through the mines by Gandalf, until he is killed battling a [[Balrog]]. Aragornleads them out to [[Lothl\u00f3rien]]. There [[Galadriel]] gives Frodo an Elven cloak and a phial carrying the Light of [[E\u00e4rendil]] to aid him on his dangerous quest.\n\nThe Fellowship travel by boat down the Anduin River and reach the hills of Parth Galen. There, Boromir, succumbing to the lure of the Ring, tries to take the ring by force from Frodo. Frodo escapes by putting on the Ring and becoming invisible. This breaks the Fellowship; the company is scattered by invading Orcs. Frodo chooses to continue the quest alone, but Sam follows his master, joining him on the journey to Mordor.\n\n===''The Two Towers''===\nFrodo and Sam make their way through the wilds, followed by the creature [[Gollum]], who has been tracking the Fellowship since Moria, seeking to reclaim the Ring. Gollum attacks the hobbits, but Frodo subdues him with Sting. He takes pity on Gollum and spares his life, binding him to a promise to guide them through the dead marshes to the Black Gate, which Gollum does. They find the gate impassable, but Gollum says that there is \"another way\" into Mordor, and Frodo, over Sam's objections, allows him to lead them south into [[Ithilien]]. There they meet [[Faramir]], younger brother of Boromir, who takes them to Henneth Ann\u00fbn. Frodo allows Gollum to be captured by Faramir, saving Gollum's life but leaving him feeling betrayed by his \"master\". Faramir provisions the hobbits and allows them to go on their way, but warns Frodo to beware of Gollum's treachery.\n\nThe three of them pass near Minas Morgul, where the pull of the Ring becomes almost unbearable. There they began the long climb up the Endless Stair, and at the top enter a tunnel, not knowing it is the home of the giant spider [[Shelob]]. Gollum hopes to deliver the hobbits to her and retake the Ring after she kills them. Shelob stings Frodo, rendering him unconscious, but Sam drives her off with Sting and the Phial of Galadriel. After attempting unsuccessfully to wake Frodo up, and unable to find any signs of life, Sam concludes that Frodo is dead and decides that his only option is to take the Ring and continue the quest. But he overhears orcs who find Frodo's body and learns that Frodo is not dead. The orcs take Frodo for questioning; Sam tries to follow but finds the door locked against him.\n\n===''The Return of the King''===\nSam rescues Frodo from the Orcs. After a brief confrontation in which Frodo becomes enraged that Sam has taken the Ring, Sam restores the Ring to Frodo. The two of them, dressed in scavenged Orc-armour, set off for Mount Doom, trailed by Gollum. They witness the plains of Mordor empty at the approach of the Armies of the West. As the Ring gets closer to its master, Frodo becomes progressively weaker as its influence grows. When they run out of water, they leave all unnecessary baggage behind to travel light. As they reach Mount Doom, Gollum reappears and attacks Frodo, who beats him back. While Sam fights with Gollum, Frodo enters the chasm in the volcano where Sauron forged the Ring. Here Frodo loses the will to destroy the Ring, and instead puts it on, claiming it for himself. Gollum pushes Sam aside and attacks the invisible Frodo, biting off his finger. As he dances around in elation, Gollum loses his balance and falls with the Ring into the fiery Cracks of Doom. The Ring is destroyed, and with it Sauron's power. Frodo and Sam are rescued by Gandalf and several [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]] as Mount Doom erupts.\n\nAfter reuniting with the Fellowship and attending Aragorn's coronation as King of Gondor, the four hobbits return to the Shire. They find the entire Shire in a state of upheaval. Saruman's agents\u2014both Hobbits and [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]\u2014have taken it over and started a destructive process of industrialization. Saruman governs the Shire in secret under the name of Sharkey until Frodo and his companions [[The Scouring of the Shire|lead a rebellion and defeat the intruders]]. Even after Saruman attempts to stab Frodo, Frodo lets him go.<ref group=T>''The Return of the King'', Book VI, VII, and VIII, pp. 315\u2013317 and 360\u2013363</ref> Frodo and his companions restore the Shire to its prior state of peace and goodwill. Frodo never completely recovers from the physical, emotional, and psychological wounds he suffered during the quest to destroy the ring. Two years after the Ring was destroyed, Frodo and Bilbo as Ring-bearers are granted passage to [[Valinor]], the [[Earthly Paradise|earthly paradise]] where Frodo might find peace.\n\n===\"The Sea-Bell\"===\n\n\"[[The Sea-Bell]]\" was published in Tolkien's 1962 collection of verse ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' with the sub-title ''Frodos Dream''. Tolkien suggests that this enigmatic [[narrative poem]] represents the despairing dreams that visited Frodo in the Shire in the years following the destruction of the Ring. It relates the unnamed speaker's journey to a mysterious land across the sea, where he tries but fails to make contact with the people who dwell there. He descends into despair and near-madness, eventually returning to his own country, to find himself utterly alienated from those he once knew.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n\nFrodo did not appear until the third draft of ''A Long-Expected Party'' (the first chapter of ''The Lord of the Rings''), when he was named Bingo, son of Bilbo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck.<ref group=T>''The Return of the Shadow'', Vol. VI in ''The History of Middle-earth'', p. 28\u201329.</ref> In the fourth draft, he was renamed Bingo Bolger-Baggins, son of Rollo Bolger and Primula Brandybuck.<ref group=T>''The Return of the Shadow'', pp. 36\u201337.</ref> Tolkien did not change the name to Frodo until the third phase of writing, when much of the narrative, as far as the hobbits' arrival in Rivendell, had already taken shape.<ref group=T>''The Return of the Shadow'', p. 309.</ref> Prior to this, the name \"Frodo\" had been used for the character who eventually became Pippin Took.<ref group=T>''The Return of the Shadow'', p. 267.</ref>\n\nIn early drafts of ''The Lord of the Rings'' the principal character is called Bingo Baggins; the name Frodo is given to another hobbit. In drafts of the final chapters of ''The Lord of the Rings'' published as ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'', Gandalf names Frodo ''Bronwe athan Harthad'' (\"Endurance Beyond Hope\"), after the destruction of the Ring. Tolkien states that Frodo's name in [[Westron]] was ''Maura Labingi''.<ref group=T>Tolkien, Christopher.

In 1764, landowners contacted the civil engineer [[John Smeaton]], who drew up proposals for a drainage scheme. This formed the basis for an [[Act of Parliament]], which the landowners obtained in March 1767. The Act authorised Drainage Commissioners to be appointed, and they asked Smeaton's colleague, [[John Grundy, Jr.]], to act as engineer for the project. David Buffery was the resident engineer and Charles Tate the land surveyor. Grundy made few changes to Smeaton's plans. By July, he had drawn the plans and specifications for the sluice which would connect the main drain to the Trent, and work began on it in August. A contract for the excavation of the main drain was awarded to James Pinkerton and John Dyson in October.<ref name=skempton281>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |p=281}}</ref> This was the first known civil engineering contract for both men, but they went on to work together on a number of schemes, including the [[Driffield Navigation]] and the [[Laneham|Laneham Drainage]] project, and seem to have acted as management contractors, organising and supplying labour to these schemes.<ref>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |pp=200, 526\u2013527}}</ref> By April 1769, all the major elements of the project had been completed, and the project had cost around \u00a37,000. The Commissioners retained Buffery, to ensure that some remaining minor works were completed to a satisfactory standard.<ref name=skempton281/>\n\nOn 13 June 1903 the Commissioners asked J Simmons, an engineer from Doncaster, to estimate the cost of a pumping plant, which would be built at the head of the drain. He produced plans and drawings, liaising with suppliers to obtain costings for the pumps. The engine house would have been {{convert|18.5|by|30|ft|m}} with a boiler house which was {{convert|11|ft|m}} wide. He submitted the scheme to the Commissioners at a meeting in Goole on 30 June, but they decided that it was too costly, and so he produced a revised scheme, which included a {{convert|75|ft|m|adj=on}} chimney at the engine house. The cost was estimated at \u00a31,452, and another meeting at Goole on 15 July asked him to obtain formal tenders for the engine and pump house. However, the scheme was again considered to be too costly, and the Commissioners wrote to Simmons on 29 July to tell him that it had been cancelled. He invoiced them for 2.5 per cent of the estimate cost, plus travelling expenses, which amounted to \u00a337 1s (\u00a337.05).<ref>Doncaster Archive Service, Document DY/SIM/3/2</ref> Following a half-yearly meeting on 10 May 1904, they wrote to say they were willing to pay 10 guineas (\u00a310.50).<ref>Doncaster Archive Service, Document DY/SIM/3/4</ref>\n\n===1927 Upgrade===\n{{Adlingfleet Drain map}}\nAfter periodic flooding in the 1920s, a survey was made, indicating that the fall on the main drain was around 2&nbsp;inches per mile (30&nbsp;mm per km), which was not sufficient for good drainage by gravity. Based on the premise that a pumping scheme had an annual cost for running and maintenance, whereas lowering the cill was essentially a one-time cost, the Commissioners of the Adlingfleet and Whitgift Drainage Board asked for tenders for a new sluice in December 1926. The cill would be {{convert|2.5|ft|m}} lower than the existing one, and the contract was for construction of the sluice and work on the drain itself, to make it wider and deeper. Near the sluice, the channel would be {{convert|75|ft|m}} wide at the top, {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide at the bottom and {{convert|20.5|ft|m}} deep. Decreasing sizes were specified for six sections over its {{convert|4|mi|km|adj=on}} length, with the final section being {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide at the bottom and only {{convert|1.83|ft|m}} deep. Various bridges would need their foundations lowered and other improvements to be made, while Gill's Close bridge was to be dismantled and not replaced.<ref name=simmons>{{harvnb |Simmons |1929}}</ref>\n\nThe previous sluice was {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide, built of masonry, and was in an unstable condition by this time. The new one would be {{convert|16|ft|m}} wide, with wing walls making the entire structure {{convert|61|ft|m}} wide. It would be {{convert|105|ft|m}} long, and the cill would be {{convert|22.5|ft|m}} below the highest tide level. Construction would be of reinforced concrete, and the sluice would be built slightly to the north of the existing one, so that it could be completed without interrupting the discharge from the drain. Eleven quotations were received, and the contract was awarded to H. Arnold and Son of Doncaster on 15 February 1927, whose estimate was for \u00a313,847. Having built the sluice structure, a new channel was excavated by mechanical excavator, to connect it to the existing drain. On the river side, the new channel was dredged by the [[Aire and Calder Navigation]] Company and covered with stone. They had the necessary plant to complete this part of the work. The benefits were expounded by Simmons, the engineers for the work, in an article which appeared in ''The Concrete Way'' in 1929, where he stated that following the work, the water levels in winter were several inches below the normal summer levels.<ref name=simmons/> In August 1932 Simmons produced a specification for sluice doors to be installed at Willowbank bridge,<ref>Doncaster Archive Service, Document DY/SIM/3/16</ref> but they were not installed.\n\n===Current state===\n[[File:Adlingfleet Sluice 2011.jpg|thumb|left|The outlet sluice into the River Trent]]\nA sluice with pumps was eventually built to the north of Cowlane bridge in Adlingfleet.<ref>Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1969</ref> The control building carries the date 1984 on a large stone built into the walls.

Those with pumps were eliminated, but eight waterways were identified as possible candidates for the fitting of eel passes to aid eel migration. On Adlingfleet drain, the entrance sluice acted as a barrier, and there was a second barrier at the sluice and pumping station by Cowlane Bridge. Although rectification was deemed to be difficult, the drain was ranked fourth in a list of tributaries that could support the migration of eels and other migratory fish.{{sfn |Nunn |2011}} By May 2011, an innovative fish-flap had been fitted, which does not compromise the flood protection, but allows fish to pass at certain states of the tide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/news/129992.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120803111202/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/news/129992.aspx |url-status = dead|archive-date=3 August 2012 |title=Release of elvers as barriers come down |publisher=Environment Agency |date=May 2011 |accessdate=31 May 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n  |title=Gazetteer \u2014 A\u2013Z of Towns Villages and Hamlets\n  |year=2006\n  |publisher=East Riding of Yorkshire Council\n  |p=3\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite web\n  |url=http://www2.hull.ac.uk/science/biological_sciences/research/hifi/people/andy_nunn.aspx\n  |title=Humber eel management issues: barriers and stocking\n  |first=Andy\n  |last=Nunn\n  |display-authors=etal\n  |publisher=University of Hull International Fisheries Institute\n  |year=2007\n  |ref=harv\n  |access-date=25 May 2012\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051607/http://www2.hull.ac.uk/science/biological_sciences/research/hifi/people/andy_nunn.aspx\n  |archive-date=4 March 2016\n  |url-status = dead\n  |df=dmy-all\n  }}\n*{{cite web\n  |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273445080_Prioritising_eel-migration_barriers_for_passage_improvements\n  |title=Prioritising eel-migration barriers for passage improvements\n  |first=Andy |last=Nunn |display-authors=etal\n  |publisher=University of Hull International Fisheries Institute\n  |date=November 2011\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal\n  |title=Land Drainage Outfall Sluice, Trent Falls\n  |first=George H. |last=Simmons\n  |journal=The Concrete Way\n  |year=1929\n  |publisher=Copy in Doncaster Archives, ref DY/SIM/3/16\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book\n  |first=Sir Alec |last=Skempton\n  |title=A Biographical Dictionary of Civil Engineers in Great Britain and Ireland: Vol 1: 1500 to 1830 \n  |publisher=Thomas Telford \n  |year=2002 \n  |isbn=978-0-7277-2939-2\n  |ref=harv|display-authors=etal}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category-inline|Adlingfleet}}\n\n{{Portalbar|Yorkshire|England|United Kingdom}}\n{{East Yorkshire|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in the East Riding of Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Land drainage in the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Village in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2014}}\n{{Use British English|date=November 2014}}\n{{Infobox UK place\n|country =                  England\n|coordinates = {{coord|53.679646|-0.723667|display=inline,title}}\n|official_name =            Adlingfleet\n|static_image_name =        Adlingfleet.jpg\n|static_image_caption =     North end of Adlingfleet on a winter day\n|population =               \n|civil_parish =             [[Twin Rivers, East Riding of Yorkshire|Twin Rivers]]\n|unitary_england =          [[East Riding of Yorkshire]]\n|region =                   Yorkshire and the Humber\n|lieutenancy_england =      [[East Riding of Yorkshire]]\n|constituency_westminster = [[Brigg and Goole (UK Parliament constituency)|Brigg and Goole]]\n|post_town =                GOOLE\n|postcode_district =        DN14\n|postcode_area =            DN\n|dial_code =                01724\n|os_grid_reference =        SE844211\n|london_distance_mi =       150<!-- straight line per MOS \u2013 constant and comparable with other place distances -->\n|london_direction =         S\n}}\n[[File:Adlingfleet map.jpg|thumb|Most of the Adlingfleet Drain is in the Twin Rivers Civil Parish.]]\n'''Adlingfleet''' is a village in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], England, that forms part of the [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] of [[Twin Rivers, East Riding of Yorkshire|Twin Rivers]].

In 1764, landowners contacted the civil engineer [[John Smeaton]], who drew up proposals for a drainage scheme. This formed the basis for an [[Act of Parliament]], which the landowners obtained in March 1767. The Act authorised Drainage Commissioners to be appointed, and they asked Smeaton's colleague, [[John Grundy, Jr.]], to act as engineer for the project. David Buffery was the resident engineer and Charles Tate the land surveyor. Grundy made few changes to Smeaton's plans. By July, he had drawn the plans and specifications for the sluice which would connect the main drain to the Trent, and work began on it in August. A contract for the excavation of the main drain was awarded to James Pinkerton and John Dyson in October.<ref name=skempton281>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |p=281}}</ref> This was the first known civil engineering contract for both men, but they went on to work together on a number of schemes, including the [[Driffield Navigation]] and the [[Laneham|Laneham Drainage]] project, and seem to have acted as management contractors, organising and supplying labour to these schemes.<ref>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |pp=200, 526\u2013527}}</ref> By April 1769, all the major elements of the project had been completed, and the project had cost around \u00a37,000. The Commissioners retained Buffery, to ensure that some remaining minor works were completed to a satisfactory standard.<ref name=skempton281/>\n\nOn 13 June 1903 the Commissioners asked J Simmons, an engineer from Doncaster, to estimate the cost of a pumping plant, which would be built at the head of the drain. He produced plans and drawings, liaising with suppliers to obtain costings for the pumps. The engine house would have been {{convert|18.5|by|30|ft|m}} with a boiler house which was {{convert|11|ft|m}} wide. He submitted the scheme to the Commissioners at a meeting in Goole on 30 June, but they decided that it was too costly, and so he produced a revised scheme, which included a {{convert|75|ft|m|adj=on}} chimney at the engine house. The cost was estimated at \u00a31,452, and another meeting at Goole on 15 July asked him to obtain formal tenders for the engine and pump house. However, the scheme was again considered to be too costly, and the Commissioners wrote to Simmons on 29 July to tell him that it had been cancelled. He invoiced them for 2.5 per cent of the estimate cost, plus travelling expenses, which amounted to \u00a337 1s (\u00a337.05).<ref>Doncaster Archive Service, Document DY/SIM/3/2</ref> Following a half-yearly meeting on 10 May 1904, they wrote to say they were willing to pay 10 guineas (\u00a310.50).<ref>Doncaster Archive Service, Document DY/SIM/3/4</ref>\n\n===1927 Upgrade===\n{{Adlingfleet Drain map}}\nAfter periodic flooding in the 1920s, a survey was made, indicating that the fall on the main drain was around 2&nbsp;inches per mile (30&nbsp;mm per km), which was not sufficient for good drainage by gravity. Based on the premise that a pumping scheme had an annual cost for running and maintenance, whereas lowering the cill was essentially a one-time cost, the Commissioners of the Adlingfleet and Whitgift Drainage Board asked for tenders for a new sluice in December 1926. The cill would be {{convert|2.5|ft|m}} lower than the existing one, and the contract was for construction of the sluice and work on the drain itself, to make it wider and deeper. Near the sluice, the channel would be {{convert|75|ft|m}} wide at the top, {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide at the bottom and {{convert|20.5|ft|m}} deep. Decreasing sizes were specified for six sections over its {{convert|4|mi|km|adj=on}} length, with the final section being {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide at the bottom and only {{convert|1.83|ft|m}} deep. Various bridges would need their foundations lowered and other improvements to be made, while Gill's Close bridge was to be dismantled and not replaced.<ref name=simmons>{{harvnb |Simmons |1929}}</ref>\n\nThe previous sluice was {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide, built of masonry, and was in an unstable condition by this time. The new one would be {{convert|16|ft|m}} wide, with wing walls making the entire structure {{convert|61|ft|m}} wide. It would be {{convert|105|ft|m}} long, and the cill would be {{convert|22.5|ft|m}} below the highest tide level. Construction would be of reinforced concrete, and the sluice would be built slightly to the north of the existing one, so that it could be completed without interrupting the discharge from the drain. Eleven quotations were received, and the contract was awarded to H. Arnold and Son of Doncaster on 15 February 1927, whose estimate was for \u00a313,847. Having built the sluice structure, a new channel was excavated by mechanical excavator, to connect it to the existing drain. On the river side, the new channel was dredged by the [[Aire and Calder Navigation]] Company and covered with stone. They had the necessary plant to complete this part of the work. The benefits were expounded by Simmons, the engineers for the work, in an article which appeared in ''The Concrete Way'' in 1929, where he stated that following the work, the water levels in winter were several inches below the normal summer levels.<ref name=simmons/> In August 1932 Simmons produced a specification for sluice doors to be installed at Willowbank bridge,<ref>Doncaster Archive Service, Document DY/SIM/3/16</ref> but they were not installed.\n\n===Current state===\n[[File:Adlingfleet Sluice 2011.jpg|thumb|left|The outlet sluice into the River Trent]]\nA sluice with pumps was eventually built to the north of Cowlane bridge in Adlingfleet.<ref>Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1969</ref> The control building carries the date 1984 on a large stone built into the walls. Construction of a sewage treatment works next to the sluice was well advanced in 2011.

Mains bridge is still a single arched brick structure, while at the end of the drain, Whinsgate bridge consists of the main brick arch under the A161 road, with arches in both wing walls, which enable tracks to cross Dodds Dyke and Eastoft Drain.

Those with pumps were eliminated, but eight waterways were identified as possible candidates for the fitting of eel passes to aid eel migration. On Adlingfleet drain, the entrance sluice acted as a barrier, and there was a second barrier at the sluice and pumping station by Cowlane Bridge. Although rectification was deemed to be difficult, the drain was ranked fourth in a list of tributaries that could support the migration of eels and other migratory fish.{{sfn |Nunn |2011}} By May 2011, an innovative fish-flap had been fitted, which does not compromise the flood protection, but allows fish to pass at certain states of the tide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/news/129992.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120803111202/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/news/129992.aspx |url-status = dead|archive-date=3 August 2012 |title=Release of elvers as barriers come down |publisher=Environment Agency |date=May 2011 |accessdate=31 May 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n  |title=Gazetteer \u2014 A\u2013Z of Towns Villages and Hamlets\n  |year=2006\n  |publisher=East Riding of Yorkshire Council\n  |p=3\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite web\n  |url=http://www2.hull.ac.uk/science/biological_sciences/research/hifi/people/andy_nunn.aspx\n  |title=Humber eel management issues: barriers and stocking\n  |first=Andy\n  |last=Nunn\n  |display-authors=etal\n  |publisher=University of Hull International Fisheries Institute\n  |year=2007\n  |ref=harv\n  |access-date=25 May 2012\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051607/http://www2.hull.ac.uk/science/biological_sciences/research/hifi/people/andy_nunn.aspx\n  |archive-date=4 March 2016\n  |url-status = dead\n  |df=dmy-all\n  }}\n*{{cite web\n  |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273445080_Prioritising_eel-migration_barriers_for_passage_improvements\n  |title=Prioritising eel-migration barriers for passage improvements\n  |first=Andy |last=Nunn |display-authors=etal\n  |publisher=University of Hull International Fisheries Institute\n  |date=November 2011\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal\n  |title=Land Drainage Outfall Sluice, Trent Falls\n  |first=George H. |last=Simmons\n  |journal=The Concrete Way\n  |year=1929\n  |publisher=Copy in Doncaster Archives, ref DY/SIM/3/16\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book\n  |first=Sir Alec |last=Skempton\n  |title=A Biographical Dictionary of Civil Engineers in Great Britain and Ireland: Vol 1: 1500 to 1830 \n  |publisher=Thomas Telford \n  |year=2002 \n  |isbn=978-0-7277-2939-2\n  |ref=harv|display-authors=etal}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category-inline|Adlingfleet}}\n\n{{Portalbar|Yorkshire|England|United Kingdom}}\n{{East Yorkshire|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in the East Riding of Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Land drainage in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Indoreli", "label": "safe", "comment": "formatting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adlingfleet"}

{"title_page": "International Board on Books for Young People", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe '''International Board on Books for Young People''' ('''IBBY''') is a Swiss [[non-profit organization]] committed to bringing books and children together. The headquarters of the IBBY are located in [[Basel]], Switzerland.\n\n==IBBY History==\nIn 1952 [[Jella Lepman]] organized a meeting in [[Munich]], Germany, called ''International Understanding through Children\u2019s Books''. Many authors, publishers, teachers and philosophers of the time attended the meeting and as a result a committee was appointed to create the International Board on Books for Young People \u2013 IBBY.\n\nA year later in 1953, IBBY was registered as a [[non-profit organization]] in [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Switzerland]]. The founding members included: [[Erich K\u00e4stner]], [[Lisa Tetzner]], [[Astrid Lindgren]], Jo Tenfjord, Fritz Brunner, Bettina H\u00fcrlimann and Richard Bamberger.  IBBY established an international award in 1956 and since then the [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]] has continued to be awarded every two years.\n\nIBBY has six key aims:\n* to promote international understanding through children's books \n* to give children everywhere the opportunity to have access to books with high literary and artistic standards \n* to encourage the publication and distribution of quality children's books, especially in developing countries \n* to provide support and training for those involved with children and children's literature \n* to stimulate research and scholarly works in the field of children's literature\n* to protect and uphold the Rights of the Child according to the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]]\n\n==IBBY Organization==\nIBBY was founded in Zurich, Switzerland as a non-profit organization in 1953. Today, it is composed of more than seventy [http://www.ibby.org/ibby-worldwide/national-sections/ National Sections] all over the world. It represents countries with well-developed book publishing and literacy programmes, and other countries with only a few dedicated professionals who are doing pioneer work in children's book publishing and promotion.\n\nIBBY's policies and programmes are determined by its Executive Committee: ten people from different countries and a President, elected biennially by the National Sections at a General Assembly during the [http://www.ibby.org/ibby-worldwide/congresses/ IBBY Congresses], held every two years. They work on a voluntary basis. The daily management of IBBY's affairs is conducted from the IBBY Secretariat in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nThe National Sections are organized in many different ways and operate on national, regional and international levels. In countries that do not have a National Section, individual membership in IBBY is possible. The membership of the National Sections include authors and illustrators, publishers and editors, translators, journalists and critics, teachers, university professors and students, librarians and booksellers, social workers and parents. Annual dues from the National Sections are IBBY's only source of regular income. Independent financing is necessary to support IBBY activities.\n\nAs a non-governmental organization with an official status in [[UNESCO]] and [[UNICEF]], IBBY has a policy-making role as an advocate of children's books. IBBY is committed to the principles of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by the United Nations in 1990. One of its main proclamations is the right of the child to a general education and to direct access to information. Thanks to IBBY's insistence, the resolution includes an appeal to all nations to promote the production and distribution of children's books.\n\nIBBY also cooperates with many international organizations and children's book institutions around the world and exhibits at the [[Bologna Children's Book Fair|International Children's Book Fair in Bologna]] and other international book fairs.\n\n==IBBY Awards and Activities==\nSince its founding in 1953, IBBY has grown in the number of awards and projects it supports and in their geographical spread. All these awards and projects share the goal of encouraging quality children's literature and upholding the right of every child to become a reader.\n\nThe most prestigious award in the field of children's literature, the [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]] is given biennially to an author and an illustrator whose complete works have made a lasting contribution to children's literature. The [[IBBY-Asahi Reading Promotion Award|IBBY-ASAHI Reading Promotion Award]] is given biennially to a group or institution whose activities are judged to be making a lasting contribution to reading promotion programmes. IBBY also compiles an [http://www.ibby.org/index.php?id=270 IBBY Honour List], published biennially, of recommended works for children by outstanding writers, illustrators and translators from its National Sections.\n\nEach year, an IBBY National Section sponsors the [[International Children's Book Day]], held in the first week of April, on or around the anniversary of Hans Christian Andersen's birthday, 2 April. The day is celebrated to inspire a love of reading and to call attention to children's books.\n\nAs part of its belief that every child has the right to become reader, IBBY and its sponsors and donors, provide funding for several reading development projects. The [http://www.ibby.org/index.php?id=794 IBBY-Yamada Fund] supports projects for reading promotion, establishing libraries, teacher, librarian and parent training as well as workshops for writers, illustrators and editors of children's books.\n\nThe [http://www.ibby.org/index.php?id=852 IBBY Children in Crisis Fund] was established in 2005 to help children affected by natural disasters, civil disorder or war. The Fund seeks donations for projects that replace or create libraries/collections of appropriate children's books and provide bibliography, the therapeutic use of books and storytelling. In the region of Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, these activities are funded by the Sharjah/IBBY Fund for Children in Crisis.\n\nIBBY has established several collections of children's books, each with its own emphasis. The largest is the [http://www.ibby.org/index.php?id=271 IBBY Documentation Centre of Books for Young People with Disabilities], located at the Toronto Public Library, Toronto.

The headquarters of the IBBY are located in [[Basel]], Switzerland.\n\n==IBBY History==\nIn 1952 Jella Lepman organized a meeting in [[Munich]], Germany, called ''International Understanding through Children\u2019s Books''. Many authors, publishers, teachers and philosophers of the time attended the meeting and as a result a committee was appointed to create the International Board on Books for Young People \u2013 IBBY.\n\nA year later in 1953, IBBY was registered as a [[non-profit organization]] in Zurich, Switzerland. The founding members included: [[Erich K\u00e4stner]], Lisa Tetzner, [[Astrid Lindgren]], Jo Tenfjord, Fritz Brunner, Bettina H\u00fcrlimann and Richard Bamberger.  IBBY established an international award in 1956 and since then the [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]] has continued to be awarded every two years.\n\nIBBY has six key aims:\n* to promote international understanding through children's books \n* to give children everywhere the opportunity to have access to books with high literary and artistic standards \n* to encourage the publication and distribution of quality children's books, especially in developing countries \n* to provide support and training for those involved with children and children's literature \n* to stimulate research and scholarly works in the field of children's literature\n* to protect and uphold the Rights of the Child according to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child\n\n==IBBY Organization==\nIBBY was founded in Zurich, Switzerland as a non-profit organization in 1953. Today, it is composed of more than seventy [http://www.ibby.org/ibby-worldwide/national-sections/ National Sections] all over the world. It represents countries with well-developed book publishing and literacy programmes, and other countries with only a few dedicated professionals who are doing pioneer work in children's book publishing and promotion.\n\nIBBY's policies and programmes are determined by its Executive Committee: ten people from different countries and a President, elected biennially by the National Sections at a General Assembly during the [http://www.ibby.org/ibby-worldwide/congresses/ IBBY Congresses], held every two years. They work on a voluntary basis. The daily management of IBBY's affairs is conducted from the IBBY Secretariat in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nThe National Sections are organized in many different ways and operate on national, regional and international levels. In countries that do not have a National Section, individual membership in IBBY is possible. The membership of the National Sections include authors and illustrators, publishers and editors, translators, journalists and critics, teachers, university professors and students, librarians and booksellers, social workers and parents. Annual dues from the National Sections are IBBY's only source of regular income. Independent financing is necessary to support IBBY activities.\n\nAs a non-governmental organization with an official status in [[UNESCO]] and [[UNICEF]], IBBY has a policy-making role as an advocate of children's books. IBBY is committed to the principles of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by the United Nations in 1990. One of its main proclamations is the right of the child to a general education and to direct access to information. Thanks to IBBY's insistence, the resolution includes an appeal to all nations to promote the production and distribution of children's books.\n\nIBBY also cooperates with many international organizations and children's book institutions around the world and exhibits at the [[Bologna Children's Book Fair|International Children's Book Fair in Bologna]] and other international book fairs.\n\n==IBBY Awards and Activities==\nSince its founding in 1953, IBBY has grown in the number of awards and projects it supports and in their geographical spread. All these awards and projects share the goal of encouraging quality children's literature and upholding the right of every child to become a reader.\n\nThe most prestigious award in the field of children's literature, the [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]] is given biennially to an author and an illustrator whose complete works have made a lasting contribution to children's literature. The [[IBBY-Asahi Reading Promotion Award|IBBY-ASAHI Reading Promotion Award]] is given biennially to a group or institution whose activities are judged to be making a lasting contribution to reading promotion programmes. IBBY also compiles an [http://www.ibby.org/index.php?id=270 IBBY Honour List], published biennially, of recommended works for children by outstanding writers, illustrators and translators from its National Sections.\n\nEach year, an IBBY National Section sponsors the [[International Children's Book Day]], held in the first week of April, on or around the anniversary of Hans Christian Andersen's birthday, 2 April. The day is celebrated to inspire a love of reading and to call attention to children's books.\n\nAs part of its belief that every child has the right to become reader, IBBY and its sponsors and donors, provide funding for several reading development projects. The [http://www.ibby.org/index.php?id=794 IBBY-Yamada Fund] supports projects for reading promotion, establishing libraries, teacher, librarian and parent training as well as workshops for writers, illustrators and editors of children's books.\n\nThe [http://www.ibby.org/index.php?id=852 IBBY Children in Crisis Fund] was established in 2005 to help children affected by natural disasters, civil disorder or war. The Fund seeks donations for projects that replace or create libraries/collections of appropriate children's books and provide bibliography, the therapeutic use of books and storytelling. In the region of Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, these activities are funded by the Sharjah/IBBY Fund for Children in Crisis.\n\nIBBY has established several collections of children's books, each with its own emphasis. The largest is the [http://www.ibby.org/index.php?id=271 IBBY Documentation Centre of Books for Young People with Disabilities], located at the Toronto Public Library, Toronto.
