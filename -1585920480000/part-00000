Its director was J. C. Boss (1947\u20131950), a mathematician. In the following year, the school was renamed as CVS (''Christelijke Vereniging Scholen'', Christian Association School), and its directorial position was taken over by Dr. Van Der Meer (1950\u20131951).\n\nFollowing the end of [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonization]] in Indonesia in 1945, CVS was handed to THKTKH (''Tiong Hoa Kie Tok Kauw Hwee'', Union of Chinese Christians) and renamed ''SMA Istimewa'' (Special  High School). Lessons were conducted in [[Mandarin Chinese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]].\n\nOn August 1, 1950, SMA Istimewa was taken over by [[BPK PENABUR|BPK Jabar]] Foundation, and the school underwent major revamping. One of these changes was the adjustment of its name to SMAK 1 (Sekolah Menengah Atas Kristen 1) and the usage of [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] as the sole medium of instruction. The addition of the word \"Kristen\" (Christian) was done to emphasize its Christian roots and values.\n\nIn 1956, the school was selected as a model school for the development of other schools in [[Jakarta]]. In the same year, it also set the record-high for Indonesian National Physics and Chemistry Examinations, an achievement held until today.\n\nOn March 1989, BPK Jabar KPS Jakarta changed its name to BPK PENABUR KPS Jakarta.  In the same year SMAK I was moved to its current location of Tanjung Duren Raya Road. The school has a running track,  canteen, sport fields, science laboratories,  library, auditorium, language laboratory, music and dance rooms, drawing rooms, a greenhouse, a student counseling center, students' council room, large assembly hall (for up to 1000 people), twenty eight classrooms, and etc..\n\nThe principal is Dra. Endang Setyowati, which will make way for a new principal in the academic year 2018/2019.\n\n==Academic system and curriculum==\nThe school curriculum adheres to the standard Indonesian high school curriculum. The duration of study is three years. First year curriculum includes basic natural and social sciences subjects ([[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[computer science]], [[history]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[accounting]], [[civics]]), Indonesian, English, tertiary foreign language electives (students can choose [[German language|German]], [[Mandarin Chinese]], or [[Japanese language|Japanese]]), [[physical education]] and Christian theological studies. Students are streamlined in the second year of their study into one of two programs: natural science program or social science program. These specialized curriculas exclude subjects tangential to the programs, allowing students to focus on their specializations. In the final year, students are presented with advanced versions of the subjects they learned in the first two years of their study.\n\nThe school offers preparation courses for several standardized tests, such as [[Education in Indonesia|UN (standardized Indonesian national examination)]], and [[International English Language Testing System|IELTS]].\n\nIn addition to having the standard Indonesian curriculum syllabus, the school curriculum also incorporates advanced subjects. These include university level physics ([[Mechanics|advanced mechanics]], [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], and components of modern [[physics]]), chemistry ([[organic chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]]), mathematics ([[calculus|advanced calculus]] and [[algebra]]) and biology ([[molecular biology]], [[cell biology]] and [[physiology]]).\n\nExtracurricular activities include sports ([[basketball]], [[Association football|soccer]], [[volleyball]], [[badminton]], [[floorball]]), martial arts ([[Capoeira]] and women martial arts), arts ([[photography]], traditional dance, [[Modern Dances|modern dance]], [[orchestra]], music band, choir, [[manga]], [[Chinese calligraphy]]), robotics, video game programming, debate, and foreign languages ([[English language/American English|English]] and [[Korean language|Korean]]).

Maharana Udai Singh II, in the wake of 16th-century emergence of artillery warfare, decided during his exile at [[Kumbhalgarh]] to move his capital to a more secure location. Ayad was flood-prone, hence he chose the ridge east of Pichola Lake to start his new capital city, where he came upon a [[hermit]] while hunting in the foothills of the [[Aravalli Range]]. The hermit blessed the king and guided him to build a palace on the spot, assuring him it would be well protected. Udai Singh II consequently established a residence on the site. In November 1567, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]] laid siege to the venerated fort of [[Chittor]]. To protect Udaipur from external attacks, Maharana Udai Singh built a six kilometre long city wall, with seven gates,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jain|first1=Manishika|title=GIS and Remote Sensing Techniques|publisher=Examrace.com, 2009|isbn=978-81-7906-190-9|page=36|edition=2009|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2-ywPPUdIZUC&dq=seven+gates+in+udaipur|accessdate=17 May 2016|year=2009}}</ref> namely [[Surajpole (Udaipur)|Surajpole]], [[Chandpole (Udaipur)|Chandpole]], [[Udiapole]], [[Hathipole (Udaipur)|Hathipole]], Ambapole, Brahmpole and so on.

Udaipur remained the capital of the state, which became a [[princely state]] of [[British India]] in 1818.

Maharana Udai Singh II, in the wake of 16th-century emergence of artillery warfare, decided during his exile at [[Kumbhalgarh]] to move his capital to a more secure location. Ayad was flood-prone, hence he chose the ridge east of Pichola Lake to start his new capital city, where he came upon a [[hermit]] while hunting in the foothills of the [[Aravalli Range]]. The hermit blessed the king and guided him to build a palace on the spot, assuring him it would be well protected. Udai Singh II consequently established a residence on the site. In November 1567, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]] laid siege to the venerated fort of [[Chittor]]. To protect Udaipur from external attacks, Maharana Udai Singh built a six kilometre long city wall, with seven gates,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jain|first1=Manishika|title=GIS and Remote Sensing Techniques|publisher=Examrace.com, 2009|isbn=978-81-7906-190-9|page=36|edition=2009|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2-ywPPUdIZUC&dq=seven+gates+in+udaipur|accessdate=17 May 2016|year=2009}}</ref> namely [[Surajpole (Udaipur)|Surajpole]], [[Chandpole (Udaipur)|Chandpole]], [[Udiapole]], [[Hathipole (Udaipur)|Hathipole]], Ambapole, Brahmpole and so on.

Udaipur remained the capital of the state, which became a [[princely state]] of [[British India]] in 1818. Being a mountainous region and unsuitable for heavily armoured Mughal horses, Udaipur remained safe from Mughal influence despite much pressure.
