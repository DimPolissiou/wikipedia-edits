He started out as a fast bowler at academy level, but his coach advised him to become a rare [[left-arm unorthodox spin]] bowler considering his build, which was ill-suited for fast bowling. He played for [[India Under-19 cricket team]] in the [[2014 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup]] where he took a [[hat-trick]] against [[Scotland national under-19 cricket team|Scotland]] which brought him into the limelight.\n\nHe became the second Indian other than [[Bhuvneshwar Kumar]] and the third spinner other than [[Imran Tahir]] and [[Ajantha Mendis]] to take 5-wicket hauls in all three formats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.sportskeeda.com/player/kuldeep-yadav|title=Kuldeep Yadav biography|work=Sportskeeda|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref> On 18 December 2019, against the West Indies, he became the first bowler for India to take two hat-tricks in international cricket.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/28324821/stats-rohit-sharma-second-only-sachin-tendulkar |title=Stats - Rohit Sharma second only to Sachin Tendulkar |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=18 December 2019}}</ref> On 17 January 2020, in the second ODI [[Australian cricket team in India in 2019\u201320|against Australia]], Yadav became the fastest [[spin bowling|spin bowler]] for India, in terms of innings, to take 100 wickets in ODI cricket, in his 58th innings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/cricketnext/news/india-vs-australia-kuldeep-yadav-becomes-fastest-indian-spinner-to-get-100-odi-wickets-2462661.html |title=India vs Australia: Kuldeep Yadav Becomes Fastest Indian Spinner to Get 100 ODI Wickets |work=Network18 Media and Investments Ltd |accessdate=17 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Domestic career==\n\nKuldeep Yadav was born and raised in [[Kanpur]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], the son of a brick kiln owner.

Inspired by bowling greats [[Wasim Akram]] and [[Zaheer Khan]], he wanted to become a left-arm seamer. However, given his slight build, his coach insisted on him becoming a wrist-spin bowler as he was impressed with the turn and variations he was providing unknowingly at the trials. Since then, he started following and watching videos of [[Shane Warne]]'s bowling and made him his role model.\n\n{{Quotation|\"I keep watching videos of [[Shane Warne|Warne]].

domestic cricket and for [[Kolkata Knight Riders]] in the [[Indian Premier League|IPL]].  He started out as a fast bowler at academy level, but his coach advised him to become a rare [[left-arm unorthodox spin]] bowler considering his build, which was ill-suited for fast bowling. He played for [[India Under-19 cricket team]] in the [[2014 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup]] where he took a [[hat-trick]] against [[Scotland national under-19 cricket team|Scotland]] which brought him into the limelight.\n\nHe became the second Indian other than [[Bhuvneshwar Kumar]] and the third spinner other than [[Imran Tahir]] and [[Ajantha Mendis]] to take 5-wicket hauls in all three formats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.sportskeeda.com/player/kuldeep-yadav|title=Kuldeep Yadav biography|work=Sportskeeda|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref> On 18 December 2019, against the West Indies, he became the first bowler for India to take two hat-tricks in international cricket.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/28324821/stats-rohit-sharma-second-only-sachin-tendulkar |title=Stats - Rohit Sharma second only to Sachin Tendulkar |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=18 December 2019}}</ref> On 17 January 2020, in the second ODI [[Australian cricket team in India in 2019\u201320|against Australia]], Yadav became the fastest [[spin bowling|spin bowler]] for India, in terms of innings, to take 100 wickets in ODI cricket, in his 58th innings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/cricketnext/news/india-vs-australia-kuldeep-yadav-becomes-fastest-indian-spinner-to-get-100-odi-wickets-2462661.html |title=India vs Australia: Kuldeep Yadav Becomes Fastest Indian Spinner to Get 100 ODI Wickets |work=Network18 Media and Investments Ltd |accessdate=17 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Domestic career==\n\nKuldeep Yadav was born and raised in [[Kanpur]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], the son of a brick kiln owner. In an interview, he revealed that it was his father who wanted him to continue playing cricket and even took him to a coach (Kapil Pandey). Inspired by bowling greats [[Wasim Akram]] and [[Zaheer Khan]], he wanted to become a left-arm seamer. However, given his slight build, his coach insisted on him becoming a wrist-spin bowler as he was impressed with the turn and variations he was providing unknowingly at the trials. Since then, he started following and watching videos of [[Shane Warne]]'s bowling and made him his role model.\n\n{{Quotation|\"I keep watching videos of [[Shane Warne|Warne]].

the [[chancellor of Austria]] since January 2020, he previously held this position from December 2017 to May 2019. In addition, Kurz has been [[List of chairpersons of the Austrian People's Party|chairman]] of the [[Austrian People's Party]] since May 2017.\n\nKurz was born and raised in [[Meidling]], [[Vienna]]. He acquired his [[Maturazeugnis|Matura]] in 2004 at the [[GRG 12 Erlgasse]] and subsequently completed mandatory military service in 2005. Following the same year, Kurz attended the faculty of law (Juridicum) at the [[University of Vienna]], but voluntarily left before graduating to focus on his political career. Kurz entered politics when he joined the [[Young People's Party (Austria)|Young People's Party]] (JVP) in 2003. Five years later he assumed his first political office there as chairman of the JVP for Vienna. In 2010, Kurz successfully ran for the [[Gemeinderat and Landtag of Vienna|Viennese State Diet]] and thereby obtained his first governmental post. Following a reshuffle of the [[First Faymann cabinet]] in 2011, Kurz was nominated and appointed state secretary of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Austria)|Interior Ministry]] for [[social integration]]. After the [[2013 Austrian legislative election|2013 legislative election]], Kurz became [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Austria)|foreign minister of Austria]] and remained the country's head diplomat until December 2017.\n\nFollowing the resignation of [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria|Vice Chancellor]] [[Reinhold Mitterlehner]] as chairman of the People's Party (\u00d6VP) in May 2017, Kurz was named his successor. Mitterlehner's withdrawal from politics led to the end of the [[Kern cabinet]] and triggered a [[2017 Austrian legislative election|legislative snap election in 2017]]; in which Kurz participated as the top candidate of his party. As leader of the largest party after the election, Kurz was charged with forming [[First Kurz government|his first cabinet]] and subsequently formed a [[coalition government|coalition]] with the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] (FP\u00d6). During his chancellorship, Kurz [[Actions of the first Kurz cabinet|passed many changes and reforms]] but suffered multiple scandals. Following the [[Ibiza affair]] and the end of the \u00d6VP\u2013FP\u00d6 majority coalition, Kurz was dismissed by the [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]] through a [[motion of no confidence]] passed by the [[SP\u00d6]], FP\u00d6 and [[JETZT (party)|JETZT]] in May 2019. However, he returned to power after the [[2019 Austrian legislative election|2019 legislative snap elections]], forming another coalition this time with the environmentalist [[The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative|Green Party]].\n\nHis youth and political tenor have been credited with revitalizing the traditional [[Politics of Austria|conservative movement in Austria]], and to a larger extent, in Europe. Opponents have, however, denounced him as uncooperative and hasty, particularly with respect to [[Sebastian Kurz#Political stances|his signature issues]], immigration and social politics. Aged 33, Kurz is the [[Lists of state leaders by age#10 youngest serving state leaders|youngest head of government]] in the world, and first elected to the post aged 31, the [[History of Austria|youngest chancellor in Austrian history]].\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Ancestry ===\nKurz was born in [[Vienna]], the only child<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobil.krone.at/386793|title=Trauen Sie sich alles zu, Herr Kurz?|language=German|date=17 December 2013|publisher=Krone|access-date=2017-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017203941/http://mobil.krone.at/386793|archive-date=2017-10-17|url-status=live}}</ref> of Roman Catholic parents Josef and Elisabeth Kurz (n\u00e9e D\u00f6ller).

While the basic income was initially denoted \"minimum grant\" (''Mindestsicherung''), it will be renamed \"social aid\" (''Sozialhilfe''). The new statute resulting from the changes, will supersede the \"federation-states-agreement on minimum standards of social services\" (which expired in 2016) and federalize the basic income through a framework law \u2013 which will allow for states to keep their autonomy in making decisions on the basic income, but only within that by the law explicitly defined framework.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.profil.at/oesterreich/mindestsicherung-neu-regeln-detail-10102185|website=www.profil.at|title=Die neuen Regeln im Detail|language=de|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dieneuevolkspartei.at/QAs-zur-Mindestsicherung|website=www.dieneuevolkspartei.at|title=Fragen & Antworten zur Mindestsicherung Neu|language=de|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n\nThe new law will grant recipients of the basic income that are singles a maximum of \u20ac863,04 monthly, couples will obtain a maximum of \u20ac1.208,26 monthly. Parents will receive \u20ac215 for their first child, \u20ac129 for their second one and \u20ac43 from the third one onward. Citizens of the [[European Union]], the [[European Economic Area]] and foreign countries, only are eligible to apply for the basic income after a legally registered stay of five years or when having served as an [[employer]]. Immigrants with insufficient German language skills will receive a reduced basic income of only \u20ac563 \u2013 cabinet argued that the difference of \u20ac300 will pay for their German language courses. The full amount of \u20ac863 will be acquirable by immigrants when having achieved German level B1 (being able to understand the basics when a standard vocabulary is applied and when it comes to trusted things like work, school or free time) or English level C1 (being able to comprehend a broad spectrum of long and challenging texts and implicit meanings).

While the prior unemployment insurance was only claimable for one year by the newly unemployed, the new unemployment insurance expands this tenure up to two years. However, when people's eligibility for the old unemployment insurance expired they could claim the constantly-renewable but less awarding emergency aid.

Furthermore, extraordinary students may face discrimination, many teachers do not have the necessary requirements, costs for the implementation are gigantic and all extraordinary students are in the same class regardless of their age, which prevents them from learning efficiently.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://derstandard.at/2000081415792/Innsbruck-will-eigene-Deutschfoerderklassen-nicht-umsetzen|website=derstandard.at|title=Weiter Widerstand gegen separate Deutschklassen|language=de|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://diepresse.com/home/bildung/schule/5588031/Deutschklassen_Die-Bedingungen-sind-ein-Wahnsinn|website=diepresse.com|title=Deutschklassen: \"Die Bedingungen sind ein Wahnsinn\"|language=de|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wien.orf.at/news/stories/2906109/|website=wien.orf.at|title=Wien sagt Nein zu Deutschklassen|language=de|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref>\n\n'''Family subsidy for European foreigners'''<br />\nIn October 2018, the Kurz cabinet amended the family subsidy for European foreigners through legislation, the changes will be in effect as of 1 January 2019.

The cabinet stated that \"centralizing the social insurance system will improve services for the insured\".\n\nFollowing insurance organizations will be merged: \n* the nine health insurances of [[States of Austria|Austria's nine states]] (''Gebietskrankenkassen'') into the federalized \"Austrian Health Insurance\" (\u00d6GK), \n* the Social Insurance for the Commercial Economy with the one of the farmers into the Social Insurance for Independents (SVS), \n* the Insurance for Railways and Mining with the Insurance for Governmental Officials into the \"BVAEB\".\n\nThe Pension Insurance (PVA) and the Insurance for Occupational Risks (AUVA) will remain untouched. In addition the Association of Austrian Social Insurances (''Hauptverband der \u00f6sterreichischen Sozialversicherungstr\u00e4ger''), which comprises all social insurance organisations, will be reduced and disempowered when the amendment is in effect.\n\nThe project will officially begin in April 2019 with the initiation of a parliamentary transitional committee overseeing the fusion. The committee will be abolished at the end of 2019 and starting 2020 the new organisation and structure will be in full effect.\n\nThe opposition (consisting of [[SP\u00d6]], [[NEOS - The New Austria|NEOS]] and [[NOW - List Pilz|NOW]]), the chairman of the Association of Austrian Social Insurances and multiple health economists have condemned these changes, saying that \"they would not centralize but decentralize and impair a perfectly functioning and effective system and thus be a general worsening for the insured\".

the [[chancellor of Austria]] since January 2020, he previously held this position from December 2017 to May 2019. In addition, Kurz has been [[List of chairpersons of the Austrian People's Party|chairman]] of the [[Austrian People's Party]] since May 2017. \n\nKurz was born and raised in [[Meidling]], [[Vienna]]. He acquired his [[Maturazeugnis|Matura]] in 2004 at the [[GRG 12 Erlgasse]] and subsequently completed mandatory military service in 2005. Following the same year, Kurz attended the faculty of law (Juridicum) at the [[University of Vienna]], but voluntarily left before graduating to focus on his political career. Kurz entered politics when he joined the [[Young People's Party (Austria)|Young People's Party]] (JVP) in 2003. Five years later he assumed his first political office there as chairman of the JVP for Vienna. In 2010, Kurz successfully ran for the [[Gemeinderat and Landtag of Vienna|Viennese State Diet]] and thereby obtained his first governmental post. Following a reshuffle of the [[First Faymann cabinet]] in 2011, Kurz was nominated and appointed state secretary of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Austria)|Interior Ministry]] for [[social integration]]. After the [[2013 Austrian legislative election|2013 legislative election]], Kurz became [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Austria)|foreign minister of Austria]] and remained the country's head diplomat until December 2017.\n\nFollowing the resignation of [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria|Vice Chancellor]] [[Reinhold Mitterlehner]] as chairman of the People's Party (\u00d6VP) in May 2017, Kurz was named his successor. Mitterlehner's withdrawal from politics led to the end of the [[Kern cabinet]] and triggered a [[2017 Austrian legislative election|legislative snap election in 2017]]; in which Kurz participated as the top candidate of his party. As leader of the largest party after the election, Kurz was charged with forming [[First Kurz government|his first cabinet]] and subsequently formed a [[coalition government|coalition]] with the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] (FP\u00d6). During his chancellorship, Kurz [[Actions of the first Kurz cabinet|passed many changes and reforms]] but suffered multiple scandals. Following the [[Ibiza affair]] and the end of the \u00d6VP\u2013FP\u00d6 majority coalition, Kurz was dismissed by the [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]] through a [[motion of no confidence]] passed by the [[SP\u00d6]], FP\u00d6 and [[JETZT (party)|JETZT]] in May 2019. However, he returned to power after the [[2019 Austrian legislative election|2019 legislative snap elections]], forming another coalition this time with the environmentalist [[The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative|Green Party]].\n\nHis youth and political tenor have been credited with revitalizing the traditional [[Politics of Austria|conservative movement in Austria]], and to a larger extent, in Europe. Opponents have, however, denounced him as uncooperative and hasty, particularly with respect to [[Sebastian Kurz#Political stances|his signature issues]], immigration and social politics. Aged 33, Kurz is the [[Lists of state leaders by age#10 youngest serving state leaders|youngest head of government]] in the world, and first elected to the post aged 31, the [[History of Austria|youngest chancellor in Austrian history]].\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Ancestry ===\nKurz was born in [[Vienna]], the only child<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobil.krone.at/386793|title=Trauen Sie sich alles zu, Herr Kurz?|language=German|date=17 December 2013|publisher=Krone|access-date=2017-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017203941/http://mobil.krone.at/386793|archive-date=2017-10-17|url-status=live}}</ref> of Roman Catholic parents Josef and Elisabeth Kurz (n\u00e9e D\u00f6ller).

The new statute resulting from the changes, will supersede the \"federation-states-agreement on minimum standards of social services\" (which expired in 2016) and federalize the basic income through a framework law \u2013 which will allow for states to keep their autonomy in making decisions on the basic income, but only within that by the law explicitly defined framework.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.profil.at/oesterreich/mindestsicherung-neu-regeln-detail-10102185|website=www.profil.at|title=Die neuen Regeln im Detail|language=de|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dieneuevolkspartei.at/QAs-zur-Mindestsicherung|website=www.dieneuevolkspartei.at|title=Fragen & Antworten zur Mindestsicherung Neu|language=de|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n\nThe new law will grant recipients of the basic income that are singles a maximum of \u20ac863,04 monthly, couples will obtain a maximum of \u20ac1.208,26 monthly. Parents will receive \u20ac215 for their first child, \u20ac129 for their second one and \u20ac43 from the third one onward. Citizens of the [[European Union]], the [[European Economic Area]] and foreign countries, only are eligible to apply for the basic income after a legally registered stay of five years or when having served as an [[employer]]. Immigrants with insufficient German language skills will receive a reduced basic income of only \u20ac563 \u2013 cabinet argued that the difference of \u20ac300 will pay for their German language courses. The full amount of \u20ac863 will be acquirable by immigrants when having achieved German level B1 (being able to understand the basics when a standard vocabulary is applied and when it comes to trusted things like work, school or free time) or English level C1 (being able to comprehend a broad spectrum of long and challenging texts and implicit meanings).

While the prior unemployment insurance was only claimable for one year by the newly unemployed, the new unemployment insurance expands this tenure up to two years.

The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction.\n}}\n</ref>\nIt is characterized by both physical and biological features.\n\nThe physical factors may include (for example): [[soil]], [[moisture]], range of [[temperature]], and [[light]] intensity. [[Biotic index|Biotic]] factors will include the availability of [[food]] and the presence or absence of [[Predation |predators]]. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of [[moss]]; for a [[Parasitism |parasitic organism]] has as its habitat the body of its [[Host (biology)|host]], part of the host's body (such as the digestive tract), or a [[Cell (biology) |single cell]] within the host's body.\n\nGeographic habitat types include [[Polar regions of Earth|polar]], [[Temperate climate|temperate]], [[Subtropics| subtropical]] and [[Tropics| tropical]]. The terrestrial [[vegetation type]] may be [[forest]], [[steppe]], [[grassland]], semi-arid or [[desert]]. [[Fresh-water]] habitats include [[marsh]]es, [[stream]]s, [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, and [[pond]]s; marine habitats include salt marshes, the coast, the [[intertidal zone]], [[Estuary|estuaries]], [[reef]]s, bays, the open sea, the sea bed, deep water and [[Hydrothermal vent| submarine vents]].\n\nHabitats may change over time. Causes of change may include a violent event (such as the eruption of a [[volcano]], an [[earthquake]], a [[tsunami]], a [[wildfire]] or a change in oceanic currents); or change may occur more gradually over millennia with alterations in the [[climate]], as [[ice sheet]]s and [[glacier]]s advance and retreat, and as different weather patterns bring changes of [[precipitation]] and [[Solar irradiance |solar radiation]]. Other changes come as a direct result of human activities, such as [[deforestation]], the plowing of ancient grasslands, the diversion and damming of rivers, the draining of marshland and the dredging of the seabed. The [[Introduced species| introduction of alien species]] can have a devastating effect on native wildlife, through increased [[predation]], through competition for resources or through the introduction of pests and diseases to which the indigenous species have no immunity.\n\n==Definition and etymology==\nThe word \"habitat\" has been in use since about 1755 and derives from the [[Latin]] ''habit\u0101re'', to inhabit, from ''hab\u0113re'', to have or to hold. Habitat can be defined as the natural environment of an [[organism]], the type of place in which it is natural for it to live and grow.<ref>{{Dictionary.com |habitat |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] |title=Habitat |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habitat|accessdate=4 June 2016}}</ref> It is similar in meaning to a [[biotope]]; an area of uniform environmental conditions associated with a particular community of plants and animals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/biotope |title=Biotope |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=4 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental factors==\nThe chief environmental factors affecting the distribution of living organisms are temperature, humidity, climate, soil and light intensity, and the presence or absence of all the requirements that the organism needs to sustain it.

The laws may be designed to protect a particular species or group of species, or the legislation may prohibit such activities as the collecting of bird eggs, the hunting of animals or the removal of plants. A general law on the protection of habitats may be more difficult to implement than a site specific requirement.

The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction.\n}}\n</ref>\nIt is characterized by both physical and biological features.\n\nThe physical factors may include (for example): [[soil]], [[moisture]], range of [[temperature]], and [[light]] intensity. [[Biotic index|Biotic]] factors will include the availability of [[food]] and the presence or absence of [[Predation |predators]]. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of [[moss]]; for a [[Parasitism |parasitic organism]] has as its habitat the body of its [[Host (biology)|host]], part of the host's body (such as the digestive tract), or a [[Cell (biology) |single cell]] within the host's body.\n\nGeographic habitat types include [[Polar regions of Earth|polar]], [[Temperate climate|temperate]], [[Subtropics| subtropical]] and [[Tropics| tropical]]. The terrestrial [[vegetation type]] may be [[forest]], [[steppe]], [[grassland]], semi-arid or [[desert]]. [[Fresh-water]] habitats include [[marsh]]es, [[stream]]s, [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, and [[pond]]s; marine habitats include salt marshes, the coast, the [[intertidal zone]], [[Estuary|estuaries]], [[reef]]s, bays, the open sea, the sea bed, deep water and [[Hydrothermal vent| submarine vents]].\n\nHabitats may change over time. Causes of change may include a violent event (such as the eruption of a [[volcano]], an [[earthquake]], a [[tsunami]], a [[wildfire]] or a change in oceanic currents); or change may occur more gradually over millennia with alterations in the [[climate]], as [[ice sheet]]s and [[glacier]]s advance and retreat, and as different weather patterns bring changes of [[precipitation]] and [[Solar irradiance |solar radiation]]. Other changes come as a direct result of human activities, such as [[deforestation]], the plowing of ancient grasslands, the diversion and damming of rivers, the draining of marshland and the dredging of the seabed. The [[Introduced species| introduction of alien species]] can have a devastating effect on native wildlife, through increased [[predation]], through competition for resources or through the introduction of pests and diseases to which the indigenous species have no immunity.\n\n==Definition and etymology==\nThe word \"habitat\" has been in use since about 1755 and derives from the [[Latin]] ''habit\u0101re'', to inhabit, from ''hab\u0113re'', to have or to hold. Habitat can be defined as the natural environment of an [[organism]], the type of place in which it is natural for it to live and grow.<ref>{{Dictionary.com |habitat |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] |title=Habitat |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habitat|accessdate=4 June 2016}}</ref> It is similar in meaning to a [[biotope]]; an area of uniform environmental conditions associated with a particular community of plants and animals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/biotope |title=Biotope |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=4 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental factors==\nThe chief environmental factors affecting the distribution of living organisms are temperature, humidity, climate, soil and light intensity, and the presence or absence of all the requirements that the organism needs to sustain it.

If an island on which an endemic organism lives becomes uninhabitable for some reason, the species will become [[Extinction|extinct]]. Any type of habitat surrounded by a different habitat is in a similar situation to an island. If a forest is divided into parts by logging, with strips of cleared land separating woodland blocks, and the distances between the remaining fragments exceeds the distance an individual animal is able to travel, that species becomes especially vulnerable. Small populations generally lack genetic diversity and may be threatened by increased predation, increased competition, disease and unexpected catastrophe.<ref name=Miller/> At the edge of each forest fragment, increased light encourages secondary growth of fast-growing species and old growth trees are more vulnerable to logging as access is improved. The birds that nest in their crevices, the [[epiphyte]]s that hang from their branches and the invertebrates in the leaf litter are all adversely affected and biodiversity is reduced.<ref name=Miller/> Habitat fragmentation can be ameliorated to some extent by the provision of [[wildlife corridor]]s connecting the fragments. These can be a river, ditch, strip of trees, hedgerow or even an underpass to a highway.

Many countries have enacted legislation to protect their wildlife. This may take the form of the setting up of national parks, forest reserves and wildlife reserves, or it may restrict the activities of humans with the objective of benefiting wildlife. The laws may be designed to protect a particular species or group of species, or the legislation may prohibit such activities as the collecting of bird eggs, the hunting of animals or the removal of plants. A general law on the protection of habitats may be more difficult to implement than a site specific requirement. A concept introduced in the United States in 1973 involves protecting the critical habitat of endangered species, and a similar concept has been incorporated into some Australian legislation.<ref name=Klemm>{{cite book|author=de Klemm, Cyrille |title=Comparative Analysis of the Effectiveness of Legislation for the Protection of Wild Flora in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oadPwh_8wqMC&pg=PA65 |year=1997 |publisher=Council of Europe |isbn=978-92-871-3429-5 |pages=65\u201370}}</ref>\n\nInternational treaties may be necessary for such objectives as the setting up of marine reserves. Another international agreement, the [[Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals]], protects animals that migrate across the globe and need protection in more than one country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cms.int/ |title=Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals |publisher=UNEP/CMS Secretariat |accessdate=7 July 2016}}</ref> Even where legislation protects the environment, a lack of enforcement often prevents effective protection. However, the protection of habitats needs to take into account the needs of the local residents for food, fuel and other resources.

This crossing over is known as the [[sensory decussation]].\n\nAt the medulla, the medial lemniscus is orientated perpendicular to the way the fibres travelled in their tracts in the posterior column. For example, in the column, [[lower limb]] is medial, [[upper limb]] is more lateral. At the medial lemniscus, axons from the leg are more ventral, and axons from the arm are more dorsal. Fibres from the [[trigeminal nerve]] (supplying the [[head (anatomy)|head]]) come in dorsal to the arm fibres, and travel up the lemniscus too.\n\nThe medial lemniscus rotates 90 degrees at the [[pons]]. The secondary axons from neurons giving sensation to the head, stay at around the same place, while the leg axons move outwards.\n\nThe axons travel up the rest of the brainstem, and synapse at the [[thalamus]] (at the [[ventral posterolateral nucleus]] for sensation from the neck, trunk, and extremities, and at the [[ventral posteromedial nucleus]] for sensation from the head).\n\n===Third-order neurons===\n====Thalamus to cortex====\nAxons from the third-order neurons in the [[ventral posterior nucleus]] in the thalamus, ascend the posterior limb of the [[internal capsule]]. Those originating from the head and the leg swap their relative positions. The axons synapse in the [[primary somatosensory cortex]], with lower body sensation most medial (e.g., the paracentral lobule) and upper body more lateral.\n\n==Function==\nDiscriminative sensation is well developed in the fingers of [[human]]s and allows the detection of fine textures. It also allows for the ability known as [[stereognosis]], to determine what an unknown object is, using the hands without visual or audio input. This fine sensation is detected by [[mechanoreceptor]]s called [[tactile corpuscle]]s that lie in the [[dermis]] of the [[skin]] close to the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. When these structures are stimulated by slight pressure, an [[action potential]] is started.  Alternatively, proprioceptive [[muscle spindles]] and other skin surface touch [[sensory receptor|receptors]] such as [[Merkel cells]], [[bulbous corpuscle]]s, [[lamellar corpuscle]]s, and hair follicle receptors (peritrichial endings) may involve the first neuron in this pathway.\n\nThe sensory neurons in this pathway are [[pseudounipolar neuron|pseudounipolar]], meaning that they have a single process emanating from the cell body with two distinct branches: one peripheral branch that functions somewhat like a [[dendrite]] of a typical neuron by receiving input (although it should ''not'' be confused with a true dendrite), and one central branch that functions like a typical axon by carrying information to other neurons (again, both branches are actually part of one axon).\n\n==Clinical significance==\nDamage to the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway below the crossing point of its fibers results in loss of vibration and joint sense (proprioception) on the [[ipsilateral|same side]] of the body as the lesion. Damage above the crossing point result a loss of vibration and joint sense on the [[contralateral|opposite side]] of the body to the lesion. The pathway is tested with [[Romberg's test]].\n\nDamage to either of the dorsal column tracts can result in the permanent loss of sensation in the limbs. See [[Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome]].\n\n==Additional information==\nThe cuneate fasciculus, fasciculus cuneatus, cuneate tract, tract of Burdach, was named for [[Karl Friedrich Burdach]]. The gracile fasciculus, the tract of Goll, was named after Swiss neuroanatomist [[Friedrich Goll]] (1829\u20131903).\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url= https://www.ualberta.ca/~neuro/OnlineIntro/SysSensorySomatic.htm#Paths |title= Somatosensory Pathways |work= The Major Systems: Sensory Systems - Somatosensory System |publisher= [[University of Alberta|U Alberta]] |date= Apr 9, 2002 }}\n\n{{Spinal cord}}\n{{Neural tracts}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway}}\n[[Category:Spinal cord tracts]]\n[[Category:Sensory systems]]\n[[Category:Thalamus]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox tract\n| Name      = Dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway\n| Latin     = via columnae posterioris lemniscique medialis\n| Image     = Spinal nerve.svg\n| Caption   = The formation of the spinal nerve from the dorsal and ventral roots.\n| Image2    = Gray759.png\n| Caption2  = Originating in peripheral [[sensory receptor]]s, the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway transmits fine touch and conscious [[proprioception|proprioceptive]] information to the brain.\n| System    = [[Somatosensory system]]\n|Acronym=DCML\n|Function=Transmit sensation of fine touch, vibration and proprioception|From=|To=[[Sensorimotor cortex]]|Decussation=[[Medial lemniscus]]| Precursor = [[Neural tube]] and [[neural crest|crest]]\n}}\nThe '''dorsal column\u2013medial lemniscus pathway''' ('''DCML''') (also known as the '''posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway''', '''PCML''') is a [[sense|sensory]] pathway of the [[central nervous system]] that conveys sensations of [[fine touch]], [[vibration]], [[two-point discrimination]], and [[proprioception]] (position) from the skin and joints.

Its base is at the surface of the spinal cord, and its apex directed toward the posterior gray commissure. The gracile fasciculus increases in size from inferior to superior.\n\nThe cuneate fasciculus is triangular on transverse section, and lies between the gracile fasciculus and the posterior column, its base corresponding with the surface of the spinal cord.\nIts fibers, larger than those of the gracile fasciculus, are mostly derived from the same source, viz., the posterior nerve roots.\nSome ascend for only a short distance in the tract, and, entering the gray matter, come into close relationship with the cells of the dorsal nucleus, while others can be traced as far as the medulla oblongata, where they end in the gracile nucleus and cuneate nucleus.\n\nThe two ascending tracts meet at the T6 level. Ascending tracts typically have three levels of neurons, namely [[first-order neuron|first-order]], [[second-order neuron|second-order]], and [[third-order neuron]]s, that relay information from the physical point of reception to the actual point of interpretation in the brain.\n[[File:1417 Ascending Pathways of Spinal Cord.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Neural connections in the DCML pathway.]]\n\n===First-order neurons===\n====Periphery and spinal cord====\n[[File:Pseudounipolar bipolar neurons.svg|thumb|The first-order neuron is a [[pseudounipolar neuron]] (shown left), with a single [[axon]] originating from the [[soma (biology)|cell body]] then splitting into two branches.

These fasciculi are in an area known as the '''posterior funiculus''' that lies between the [[posterolateral sulcus of spinal cord|posterolateral]] and the [[posterior median sulcus of spinal cord|posterior median sulcus]]. They are separated by a partition of [[neuroglia|glial cells]] which places them on either side of the posterior intermediate sulcus.\n\nThe column reaches the junction between the spinal cord and the [[medulla oblongata]], where lower body axons in the gracile fasciculus connect ([[synapse]]) with neurons in the [[gracile nucleus]], and upper body axons in the cuneate fasciculus synapse with neurons in the [[cuneate nucleus]].<ref name=\"Ganong2016\" />\n\nFirst-order neurons secrete substance P in the dorsal horn as a chemical mediator of pain signaling.

This crossing over is known as the [[sensory decussation]].\n\nAt the medulla, the medial lemniscus is orientated perpendicular to the way the fibres travelled in their tracts in the posterior column. For example, in the column, [[lower limb]] is medial, [[upper limb]] is more lateral. At the medial lemniscus, axons from the leg are more ventral, and axons from the arm are more dorsal. Fibres from the [[trigeminal nerve]] (supplying the [[head (anatomy)|head]]) come in dorsal to the arm fibres, and travel up the lemniscus too.\n\nThe medial lemniscus rotates 90 degrees at the [[pons]]. The secondary axons from neurons giving sensation to the head, stay at around the same place, while the leg axons move outwards.\n\nThe axons travel up the rest of the brainstem, and synapse at the [[thalamus]] (at the [[ventral posterolateral nucleus]] for sensation from the neck, trunk, and extremities, and at the [[ventral posteromedial nucleus]] for sensation from the head).\n\n===Third-order neurons===\n====Thalamus to cortex====\nAxons from the third-order neurons in the [[ventral posterior nucleus]] in the thalamus, ascend the posterior limb of the [[internal capsule]]. Those originating from the head and the leg swap their relative positions. The axons synapse in the [[primary somatosensory cortex]], with lower body sensation most medial (e.g., the paracentral lobule) and upper body more lateral.\n\n==Function==\nDiscriminative sensation is well developed in the fingers of [[human]]s and allows the detection of fine textures. It also allows for the ability known as [[stereognosis]], to determine what an unknown object is, using the hands without visual or audio input. This fine sensation is detected by [[mechanoreceptor]]s called [[tactile corpuscle]]s that lie in the [[dermis]] of the [[skin]] close to the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. When these structures are stimulated by slight pressure, an [[action potential]] is started.  Alternatively, proprioceptive [[muscle spindles]] and other skin surface touch [[sensory receptor|receptors]] such as [[Merkel cells]], [[bulbous corpuscle]]s, [[lamellar corpuscle]]s, and hair follicle receptors (peritrichial endings) may involve the first neuron in this pathway.\n\nThe sensory neurons in this pathway are [[pseudounipolar neuron|pseudounipolar]], meaning that they have a single process emanating from the cell body with two distinct branches: one peripheral branch that functions somewhat like a [[dendrite]] of a typical neuron by receiving input (although it should ''not'' be confused with a true dendrite), and one central branch that functions like a typical axon by carrying information to other neurons (again, both branches are actually part of one axon).\n\n==Clinical significance==\nDamage to the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway below the crossing point of its fibers results in loss of vibration and joint sense (proprioception) on the [[ipsilateral|same side]] of the body as the lesion. Damage above the crossing point result a loss of vibration and joint sense on the [[contralateral|opposite side]] of the body to the lesion. The pathway is tested with [[Romberg's test]].\n\nDamage to either of the dorsal column tracts can result in the permanent loss of sensation in the limbs. See [[Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome]].\n\n==Additional information==\nThe cuneate fasciculus, fasciculus cuneatus, cuneate tract, tract of Burdach, was named for [[Karl Friedrich Burdach]]. The gracile fasciculus, the tract of Goll, was named after Swiss neuroanatomist [[Friedrich Goll]] (1829\u20131903).\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url= https://www.ualberta.ca/~neuro/OnlineIntro/SysSensorySomatic.htm#Paths |title= Somatosensory Pathways |work= The Major Systems: Sensory Systems - Somatosensory System |publisher= [[University of Alberta|U Alberta]] |date= Apr 9, 2002 }}\n\n{{Spinal cord}}\n{{Neural tracts}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway}}\n[[Category:Spinal cord tracts]]\n[[Category:Sensory systems]]\n[[Category:Thalamus]]\n", "name_user": "Iztwoz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePeriphery and spinal cord:link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_column%E2%80%93medial_lemniscus_pathway"}
