Their [[seismic moment]]s can account for a significant fraction of the global seismic moment across century-scale periods. Of all the moment released by earthquakes in the 100 years from 1906 through 2005, roughly one-eighth was due to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. This quake, together with the [[1964 Alaska earthquake|Good Friday earthquake]] ([[Alaska]], 1964) and the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake|Great Chilean earthquake]] (1960), account for almost half of the total moment.\n\nSince 1900, the only earthquakes recorded with a greater magnitude were the 1960 [[1960 Valdivia earthquake|Great Chilean earthquake]] (Magnitude 9.5) and the 1964 Good Friday earthquake in [[Prince William Sound]] (Magnitude 9.2).

Each of these megathrust earthquakes also spawned tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean. In comparison to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the death toll from these earthquakes was significantly lower, primarily because of the lower population density along the coasts near affected areas, the much greater distances to more populated coasts, and the superior infrastructure and warning systems in MEDCs (More Economically Developed Countries) such as Japan.\n\nOther huge megathrust earthquakes occurred in 1868 (Peru, [[Nazca Plate]] and [[South American Plate]]); 1827 (Colombia, Nazca Plate and South American Plate); 1812 (Venezuela, [[Caribbean Plate]] and South American Plate) and [[1700 Cascadia earthquake|1700]] (western North America, [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] and [[North American Plate]]). All of them are believed to be greater than magnitude 9, but no accurate measurements were available at the time.\n\n===Tectonic plates===\n{{Main|Plate tectonics}}\n[[File:Seisme Sumatra CADRE.jpg|thumb|left|Epicenter and associated aftershocks]]\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was unusually large in geographical and geological extent. An estimated {{cvt|1600|km|-2}} of [[Fault (geology)|fault surface]] slipped (or ruptured) about {{cvt|15|m|-1}} along the [[subduction]] zone where the [[Indian Plate]] slides (or subducts) under the overriding Burma Plate. The slip did not happen instantaneously but took place in two phases over several minutes:\nSeismographic and acoustic data indicate that the first phase involved a rupture about {{cvt|400|km|-1}} long and {{cvt|100|km|-1}} wide, {{cvt|30|km}} beneath the sea bed\u2014the largest rupture ever known to have been caused by an earthquake. The rupture proceeded at about {{cvt|2.8|km/s|mi/s km/h mph}}, beginning off the coast of [[Aceh]] and proceeding north-westerly over about 100 seconds.\nAfter a pause of about another 100 seconds, the rupture continued northwards towards the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and [[Nicobar Islands]]. The northern rupture occurred more slowly than in the south, at about {{cvt|2.1|km/s|mi/s km/h mph}}, continuing north for another five minutes to a plate boundary where the fault type changes from subduction to [[Strike-slip fault|strike-slip]] (the two plates slide past one another in opposite directions).\n\nThe Indian Plate is part of the great [[Indo-Australian Plate]], which underlies the Indian Ocean and [[Bay of Bengal]], and is moving north-east at an average of {{convert|60|mm/yr|in/yr|abbr=on}}. The India Plate meets the [[Burma Plate]] (which is considered a portion of the great [[Eurasian Plate]]) at the [[Sunda Trench]]. At this point, the India Plate subducts beneath the Burma Plate, which carries the Nicobar Islands, the Andaman Islands, and northern Sumatra. The India Plate sinks deeper and deeper beneath the Burma Plate until the increasing temperature and pressure drive [[volatiles]] out of the subducting plate. These volatiles rise into the overlying plate, causing partial melting and the formation of magma. The rising magma intrudes into the crust above and exits the Earth's crust through volcanoes in the form of a [[volcanic arc]]. The volcanic activity that results as the Indo-Australian Plate subducts the Eurasian Plate has created the [[Sunda Arc]].\n\nAs well as the sideways movement between the plates, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake resulted in a rise of the seafloor by several metres, displacing an estimated {{cvt|30|km3}} of water and triggering devastating tsunami waves. The waves radiated outwards along the entire {{convert|1600|km|-2|adj=on|abbr=on}} length of the rupture (acting as a [[line source]]). This greatly increased the geographical area over which the waves were observed, reaching as far as Mexico, Chile, and the Arctic. The raising of the seafloor significantly reduced the capacity of the Indian Ocean, producing a permanent rise in the global sea level by an estimated {{cvt|0.1|mm|sigfig=1}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bilham|first1=Roger|title=A Flying Start, Then a Slow Slip|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=20 May 2005|volume=308|issue=5725|pages=1126\u20131127|doi=10.1126/science.1113363|pmid=15905391|bibcode=2005Sci...308.1126B}}</ref>\n\n===Aftershocks and other earthquakes===\n{{see also|List of earthquakes in Indonesia|List of earthquakes in 2004}}\n[[File:Neic slav fig72.gif|thumb|Initial earthquake and aftershocks measuring greater than 4.0 {{M|w}} from 26 December 2004 to 10 January 2005]]\n[[File:2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.svg|thumb|right|Aftershocks of:2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]\nNumerous [[aftershock]]s were reported off the [[Andaman Islands]], the [[Nicobar Islands]] and the region of the original epicentre in the hours and days that followed.

The record section plot displays vertical displacements of the Earth's surface recorded by seismometers from the IRIS/USGS Global Seismographic Network plotted with respect to time (since the earthquake initiation) on the horizontal axis, and vertical displacements of the Earth on the vertical axis (note the 1&nbsp;cm scale bar at the bottom for scale). The seismograms are arranged vertically by distance from the epicentre in degrees. The earliest, lower amplitude signal is that of the compressional [[P-wave|(P) wave]], which takes about 22 minutes to reach the other side of the planet (the [[Antipodes|antipode]]; in this case near Ecuador). The largest amplitude signals are seismic surface waves that reach the antipode after about 100 minutes. The surface waves can be clearly seen to reinforce near the antipode (with the closest seismic stations in Ecuador), and to subsequently encircle the planet to return to the epicentral region after about 200 minutes. A major aftershock (magnitude 7.1) can be seen at the closest stations starting just after the 200-minute mark. The aftershock would be considered a major earthquake under ordinary circumstances but is dwarfed by the mainshock.\n\nThe shift of mass and the massive release of energy slightly altered the Earth's rotation.

Although the extreme western edge of the Ring of Fire extends into the Indian Ocean (the point where the earthquake struck), no warning system exists in that ocean. Tsunamis there are relatively rare despite earthquakes being relatively frequent in Indonesia. The last major tsunami was caused by the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa]]. Not every earthquake produces large tsunamis: on 28 March 2005, a magnitude 8.7 earthquake hit roughly the same area of the Indian Ocean but did not result in a major tsunami.\n\nThe first warning sign of a possible tsunami is the earthquake itself. However, tsunamis can strike thousands of kilometres away where the earthquake is felt only weakly or not at all. Also, in the minutes preceding a tsunami strike, the sea often recedes temporarily from the coast, something which was observed on the eastern side of the rupture zone of the earthquake such as around the coastlines of Aceh, [[Phuket]] island, and [[Khao Lak]] area in Thailand, [[Penang]] island of Malaysia, and the [[Andaman and Nicobar islands]].

The bathymetry of the seafloor favoured the development of large surfing-type tsunami waves. The locals reported 10 to 12 waves, with the second and third waves being the highest and most destructive. Interviews with the local people and fishers revealed that about 10\u201315 minutes after the earthquake, the sea dramatically receded and exposed [[coral reefs]]. In the distant horizon, gigantic vertical black waves about 30&nbsp;m (98.4&nbsp;ft) high made explosion-like sounds as it broke and approached the shore.

However, when the seawalls were made of loose stones, the stones were displaced and carried a few metres inland.<ref name=\"mapsofindia.com\"/><ref name=\"books.google.com.my\"/><ref name=\"academic.evergreen.edu\"/>\n\nThe state of Kerala experienced tsunami-related damage in three southern densely populated districts, [[Ernakulam]], [[Alappuzha]], and Kollam, due to diffraction of the waves around Sri Lanka. The southernmost district of [[Thiruvananthpuram]], however, escaped damage, possibly due to the wide turn of the diffracted waves at the peninsular tip. Major damage occurred in two narrow strips of land bound on the west by the [[Arabian Sea]] and on the east by the [[Kerala backwaters]]. The waves receded before the first tsunami with the highest fatality reported from the densely populated Alappad panchayat (including the villages of Cheriya Azhikkal and Azhikkal) at Kollam district, caused by a {{cvt|4|m}} tsunami.<ref name=\"iitk.ac.in\"/>\n\nThe worst affected area in Tamil Nadu was [[Nagapattinam district]], with 6,051 fatalities reported by a {{cvt|5|m}} tsunami, followed by [[Cuddalore district]], with many villages destroyed.<ref name=\"iitk.ac.in\"/> The {{cvt|13|km}} Marina Beach in [[Chennai]] was battered by the tsunami which swept across the beach taking morning walkers unaware.

Identically to Sri Lanka, survivors reported three waves with the second wave being the most powerful. Being rich in coral reefs, the Maldives provides an opportunity for scientists to assess the impact of a tsunami on coral atolls. The significantly lower tsunami impact on the Maldives compared to Sri Lanka is mostly due to the topography and [[bathymetry]] of the atoll chain with offshore coral reefs, deep channels separating individual atolls and its arrival within low tide which decreased the power of the tsunami. After the tsunami, there was some concern that the country might be submerged entirely and become uninhabitable. However, this was proven untrue.\nThe highest tsunami wave measured was 4&nbsp;m (13.1&nbsp;ft) at [[Vilufushi (Thaa Atoll)|Vilufushi Island]]. The tsunami arrived approximately 2 hours after the earthquake. The greatest tsunami inundation occurred at North Male Atoll, Male island at 250 m (0.155 miles) along the streets.\nThe Maldives tsunami wave analysis:\n* {{cvt|1.3|-|2.4|m}} at North Male Atoll, Male Island\n* {{cvt|2|m}} at North Male Atoll, Huhule Island\n* {{cvt|1.7|-|2.8|m}} at South Male Atoll, Embudhu Finothu\n* {{cvt|2.5|-|3.3|m}} at Laamu Atoll, Fonadhoo Island\n* {{cvt|2.2|-|2.9|m}} at Laamu Atoll, Gan Island\n* {{cvt|2.3|-|3|m}} at North Male Atoll, Dhiffushi Island\n* {{cvt|2.2|-|2.4|m}} at North Male Atoll, Huraa Island\n* more than {{cvt|1.5|m}} at North Male Atoll, Kuda Huraa Island\n\n===Myanmar===\nIn [[Myanmar]], the tsunami caused only moderate damage, which arrived between 2 and 5.5 hours after the earthquake. Although the country's western [[Andaman Sea]] coastline lies at the proximity of the rupture zone, there were smaller tsunamis than the neighbouring Thai coast, probably because the main tsunami source did not extend to the Andaman Islands. Another factor is that some coasts of [[Taninthayi Division]] were protected by offshore islands of the [[Myeik Archipelago]]. Based on scientific surveys from Ayeyarwaddy Delta through Taninthayi Division, it is revealed that tsunami heights along the Myanmar coast were between 0.4\u20132.9 m (1.3\u20139.5&nbsp;ft). Eyewitnesses often compared the December tsunami heights with the \"rainy season high tide\"; although at most locations, the tsunami height was similar or smaller than the \"rainy season high tide\" level.<ref name=\"terrapub.co.jp\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS/pdf/2006/5802/58020243.pdf |first1=Kenji |last1=Satake |first2=Than Tin |last2=Aung |first3=Yuki |last3=Sawai |first4=Yukinobu |last4=Okamura |display-authors=1 |title=Tsunami heights and damage along the Myanmar coast from the December 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake |journal=Earth Planets Space |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=243\u2013252 |year=2006 |access-date=22 December 2018 |doi=10.1186/BF03353384 |bibcode=2006EP&S...58..243S }}</ref>\n\nTsunami survey heights:{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n* {{cvt|0.6|-|2.3|m}} around the Ayeyarwady delta\n* {{cvt|0.9|-|2.9|m}} at [[Dawei]] area\n* {{cvt|0.7|-|2.2|m}} around [[Myeik, Burma|Myeik]]\n* {{cvt|0.4|-|2.6|m}} around [[Kawthaung]]\n\nInterviews with local people indicate that they did not feel the earthquake in [[Taninthayi Division]] or Ayeyarwaddy Delta. The 71 casualties can be attributed to poor housing infrastructure and additionally, the fact that the coastal residents in the surveyed areas live on flat land along the coast, especially in the Ayeyarwaddy Delta, and that there is no higher ground to which to evacuate. The tsunami heights from the 2004 December earthquake\nwere not more than 3&nbsp;m (9.8&nbsp;ft) along the Myanmar coast, the amplitudes are slightly large off the Ayeyarwaddy Delta, probably because the shallow delta cause a concentration in tsunami energy.<ref name=\"terrapub.co.jp\"/>\n\n===Somalia===\nThe tsunami travelled {{cvt|5000|km}} west across the open ocean before striking the East African country of [[Somalia]]. Around 289 fatalities were reported in the [[Horn of Africa]], drowned by four tsunami waves. The hardest-hit was a {{cvt|650|km}} stretch of the Somalia coastline between [[Garacad, Mudug|Garacad]] ([[Mudug]] region) and [[Hafun|Xaafuun]] ([[Bari, Somalia|Bari]] region), which forms part of the [[Puntland]] province.

While local economies were devastated, the overall impact on the national economies was minor. The two main occupations affected by the tsunami were fishing and tourism.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gunatillake|first=Daya|title=The 2004 Tsunami in Sri Lanka: Destruction and recovery|journal=Geography|year=2007|volume=92|issue=3|pages=285\u2013293|jstor=40574342}}</ref> The impact on coastal fishing communities and the people living there, some of the poorest in the region, has been devastating with high losses of income earners as well as boats and fishing gear.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukabc.org/tsunamis.htm|title=Tsunamis Devastate Fisherfolk of Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea|website=www.ukabc.org|access-date=11 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/70B417968D5FCDD0C1256F8400498CE6-fao-souasi-7jan.pdf|title=Impacts of the Tsunami on Fisheries, Aquaculture and Coastal Livelihoods|date=7 January 2005|website=reliefweb|accessdate=10 March 2019}}</ref> In Sri Lanka artisanal fishery, where the use of fish baskets, fishing traps, and spears are commonly used, is an important source of fish for local markets; industrial fishery is the major economic activity, providing direct employment to about 250,000 people. In recent years the fishery industry has emerged as a dynamic export-oriented sector, generating substantial foreign exchange earnings. Preliminary estimates indicate that 66% of the fishing fleet and industrial infrastructure in coastal regions have been destroyed by the wave surges, which will have adverse economic effects both at local and national levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/indonesia/food-supply-and-food-security-situation-countries-affected-asia-tsunami|title=Food supply and food security situation in countries affected by the Asia tsunami \u2013 Indonesia|website=ReliefWeb|access-date=11 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile the tsunami destroyed many of the boats vital to Sri Lanka's fishing industry, it also created a demand for fibreglass reinforced plastic catamarans in boatyards of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Since over 51,000 vessels were lost to the tsunami, the industry boomed. However, the huge demand has led to lower quality in the process, and some important materials were sacrificed to cut prices for those who were impoverished by the tsunami.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bobpigo.org/bbn/sep_06/pages10-12.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tul4D7Pz?url=http://www.bobpigo.org/bbn/sep_06/pages10-12.pdf |archivedate=1 November 2010 |title=Demand for FRP boats rise after tsunami |accessdate=12 August 2010 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nSome economists believe that damage to the affected national economies will be minor because losses in the tourism and fishing industries are a relatively small percentage of the GDP. However, others caution that damage to infrastructure is an overriding factor. In some areas drinking water supplies and farm fields may have been contaminated for years by saltwater from the ocean.<ref>Pearce, Fred. \"[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6840 Tsunami's salt water may leave islands uninhabitable].\" ''[[New Scientist]].'' 5 January 2005. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422084629/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6840 |date=22 April 2008 }}</ref> Even though only coastal regions were directly affected by the waters of the tsunami, the indirect effects have spread to inland provinces as well. Since the media coverage of the event was so extensive, many tourists cancelled vacations and trips to that part of the world, even though their travel destinations may not have been affected. This ripple effect could especially be felt in the inland provinces of Thailand, such as Krabi, which acted as a starting point for many other tourist destinations in Thailand.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rigg|first=Johnathan|author2=Lisa Lawt |author3=May Tan-Mullins |author4=Carl Grundy-Warr|title=The Indian Ocean Tsunami: Socio-Economic Impacts in Thailand.|journal=The Geographical Journal|date=December 2005|volume=171|issue=4|pages=374\u2013379|jstor=3451210|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4959.2005.00175_3.x|url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/1284/1/1284.pdf?DDD14+dgg0cnm}}</ref>\n\nBoth the earthquake and the tsunami may have affected shipping in the [[Malacca Straits]], which separate Malaysia and the Indonesian island of Sumatra, by changing the depth of the seabed and by disturbing navigational buoys and old shipwrecks. In one area of the Strait, water depths were previously up to {{cvt|4000|ft|m|order=flip}}, and are now only {{cvt|100|ft|m|order=flip}} in some areas, making shipping impossible and dangerous. These problems also made the delivery of relief aid more challenging. Compiling new navigational charts may take months or years. However, officials hope that piracy in the region will drop off as a result of the tsunami.<ref>Staff Writer. \"[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6791600 Tsunami redrew ship channels, ocean floor].\" [[NBC News]]/Associated Press. 5 January 2005.</ref>\n\nCountries in the region appealed to tourists to return, pointing out that most tourist infrastructure is undamaged. However, tourists were reluctant to do so for psychological reasons. Even beach resorts in parts of Thailand which were untouched by the tsunami were hit by cancellations.<ref>Chapter 6, \"Thailand\", in Jayasuriya, Sisira and Peter McCawley, [http://www.e-elgar.co.uk/Bookentry_Main.lasso?id=13668 ''The Asian Tsunami: Aid and Reconstruction after a Disaster''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722005138/http://www.e-elgar.co.uk/Bookentry_Main.lasso?id=13668 |date=22 July 2011 }}.

It has been reported that severe damage has been inflicted on [[ecosystem]]s such as mangroves, coral reefs, forests, coastal wetlands, vegetation, sand dunes and rock formations, animal and plant [[biodiversity]] and [[groundwater]]. Also, the spread of solid and liquid waste and industrial chemicals, water pollution and the destruction of [[sewage]] collectors and treatment plants threaten the environment even further, in untold ways. The environmental impact will take a long time and significant resources to assess.<ref>{{cite web|title=Impact of Tsunamis on Ecosystems|work=United Nations Atlas of the Oceans|date=10 March 2005|url=http://www.oceansatlas.org/id/71687|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820112413/http://www.oceansatlas.org/id/71687|url-status = dead|archive-date=20 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to specialists, the main effect is being caused by poisoning of the freshwater supplies and of the soil by saltwater infiltration and a deposit of a salt layer over arable land. It has been reported that in the Maldives, 16 to 17 coral reef atolls that were overcome by sea waves are without fresh water and could be rendered uninhabitable for decades. Uncountable wells that served communities were invaded by sea, sand, and earth; and [[aquifer]]s were invaded through porous rock. Salted-over soil becomes sterile, and it is difficult and costly to restore for agriculture. It also causes the death of plants and important soil micro-organisms. Thousands of rice, mango, and banana plantations in Sri Lanka were destroyed almost entirely and will take years to recover. On the island's east coast, the tsunami contaminated wells on which many villagers relied for drinking water. The Colombo-based [[International Water Management Institute]] monitored the effects of saltwater and concluded that the wells recovered to pre-tsunami drinking water quality one and a half years after the event.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302022712/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%207%20-%20Helping_restore_the_quality_of_drinking_water_after_the_tsunami.pdf Helping restore the quality of drinking water after the tsunami.] [[International Water Management Institute]], 2010.

Their [[seismic moment]]s can account for a significant fraction of the global seismic moment across century-scale periods. Of all the moment released by earthquakes in the 100 years from 1906 through 2005, roughly one-eighth was due to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. This quake, together with the [[1964 Alaska earthquake|Good Friday earthquake]] ([[Alaska]], 1964) and the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake|Great Chilean earthquake]] (1960), account for almost half of the total moment.\n\nSince 1900, the only earthquakes recorded with a greater magnitude were the 1960 [[1960 Valdivia earthquake|Great Chilean earthquake]] (Magnitude 9.5) and the 1964 Good Friday earthquake in [[Prince William Sound]] (Magnitude 9.2).

Each of these megathrust earthquakes also spawned tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean. In comparison to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the death toll from these earthquakes was significantly lower, primarily because of the lower population density along the coasts near affected areas, the much greater distances to more populated coasts, and the superior infrastructure and warning systems in MEDCs (More Economically Developed Countries) such as Japan.\n\nOther huge megathrust earthquakes occurred in 1868 (Peru, [[Nazca Plate]] and [[South American Plate]]); 1827 (Colombia, Nazca Plate and South American Plate); 1812 (Venezuela, [[Caribbean Plate]] and South American Plate) and [[1700 Cascadia earthquake|1700]] (western North America, [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] and [[North American Plate]]). All of them are believed to be greater than magnitude 9, but no accurate measurements were available at the time.\n\n===Tectonic plates===\n{{Main|Plate tectonics}}\n[[File:Seisme Sumatra CADRE.jpg|thumb|left|Epicenter and associated aftershocks]]\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was unusually large in geographical and geological extent. An estimated {{cvt|1600|km|-2}} of [[Fault (geology)|fault surface]] slipped (or ruptured) about {{cvt|15|m|-1}} along the [[subduction]] zone where the [[Indian Plate]] slides (or subducts) under the overriding Burma Plate. The slip did not happen instantaneously but took place in two phases over several minutes:\nSeismographic and acoustic data indicate that the first phase involved a rupture about {{cvt|400|km|-1}} long and {{cvt|100|km|-1}} wide, {{cvt|30|km}} beneath the sea bed\u2014the largest rupture ever known to have been caused by an earthquake. The rupture proceeded at about {{cvt|2.8|km/s|mi/s km/h mph}}, beginning off the coast of [[Aceh]] and proceeding north-westerly over about 100 seconds.\nAfter a pause of about another 100 seconds, the rupture continued northwards towards the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and [[Nicobar Islands]]. The northern rupture occurred more slowly than in the south, at about {{cvt|2.1|km/s|mi/s km/h mph}}, continuing north for another five minutes to a plate boundary where the fault type changes from subduction to [[Strike-slip fault|strike-slip]] (the two plates slide past one another in opposite directions).\n\nThe Indian Plate is part of the great [[Indo-Australian Plate]], which underlies the Indian Ocean and [[Bay of Bengal]], and is moving north-east at an average of {{convert|60|mm/yr|in/yr|abbr=off}}. The India Plate meets the [[Burma Plate]] (which is considered a portion of the great [[Eurasian Plate]]) at the [[Sunda Trench]]. At this point, the India Plate subducts beneath the Burma Plate, which carries the Nicobar Islands, the Andaman Islands, and northern Sumatra. The India Plate sinks deeper and deeper beneath the Burma Plate until the increasing temperature and pressure drive [[volatiles]] out of the subducting plate. These volatiles rise into the overlying plate, causing partial melting and the formation of magma. The rising magma intrudes into the crust above and exits the Earth's crust through volcanoes in the form of a [[volcanic arc]]. The volcanic activity that results as the Indo-Australian Plate subducts the Eurasian Plate has created the [[Sunda Arc]].\n\nAs well as the sideways movement between the plates, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake resulted in a rise of the seafloor by several metres, displacing an estimated {{cvt|30|km3}} of water and triggering devastating tsunami waves. The waves radiated outwards along the entire {{convert|1600|km|-2|adj=on}} length of the rupture (acting as a [[line source]]). This greatly increased the geographical area over which the waves were observed, reaching as far as Mexico, Chile, and the Arctic.

The record section plot displays vertical displacements of the Earth's surface recorded by seismometers from the IRIS/USGS Global Seismographic Network plotted with respect to time (since the earthquake initiation) on the horizontal axis, and vertical displacements of the Earth on the vertical axis (note the 1&nbsp;cm scale bar at the bottom for scale). The seismograms are arranged vertically by distance from the epicentre in degrees. The earliest, lower amplitude signal is that of the compressional [[P-wave|(P) wave]], which takes about 22 minutes to reach the other side of the planet (the [[Antipodes|antipode]]; in this case near Ecuador). The largest amplitude signals are seismic surface waves that reach the antipode after about 100 minutes. The surface waves can be clearly seen to reinforce near the antipode (with the closest seismic stations in Ecuador), and to subsequently encircle the planet to return to the epicentral region after about 200 minutes. A major aftershock (magnitude 7.1) can be seen at the closest stations starting just after the 200-minute mark. The aftershock would be considered a major earthquake under ordinary circumstances but is dwarfed by the mainshock.\n\nThe shift of mass and the massive release of energy slightly altered the Earth's rotation.

Although the extreme western edge of the Ring of Fire extends into the Indian Ocean (the point where the earthquake struck), no warning system exists in that ocean. Tsunamis there are relatively rare despite earthquakes being relatively frequent in Indonesia. The last major tsunami was caused by the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa]]. Not every earthquake produces large tsunamis: on 28 March 2005, a magnitude 8.7 earthquake hit roughly the same area of the Indian Ocean but did not result in a major tsunami.\n\nThe first warning sign of a possible tsunami is the earthquake itself. However, tsunamis can strike thousands of kilometres away where the earthquake is felt only weakly or not at all. Also, in the minutes preceding a tsunami strike, the sea often recedes temporarily from the coast, something which was observed on the eastern side of the rupture zone of the earthquake such as around the coastlines of Aceh, [[Phuket]] island, and [[Khao Lak]] area in Thailand, [[Penang]] island of Malaysia, and the [[Andaman and Nicobar islands]]. Around the Indian Ocean, this rare sight reportedly induced people, especially children, to visit the coast to investigate and collect stranded fish on as much as {{cvt|2.5|km}} of exposed beach, with fatal results.<ref>{{cite web|last=Block|first=Melissa|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4246573|title=Sri Lankans Seek Lost Relatives After Tsunami|work=[[All Things Considered]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=27 December 2004|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref> However, not all tsunamis cause this \"disappearing sea\" effect.

Identically to Sri Lanka, survivors reported three waves with the second wave being the most powerful. Being rich in coral reefs, the Maldives provides an opportunity for scientists to assess the impact of a tsunami on coral atolls. The significantly lower tsunami impact on the Maldives compared to Sri Lanka is mostly due to the topography and [[bathymetry]] of the atoll chain with offshore coral reefs, deep channels separating individual atolls and its arrival within low tide which decreased the power of the tsunami. After the tsunami, there was some concern that the country might be submerged entirely and become uninhabitable. However, this was proven untrue.\nThe highest tsunami wave measured was 4&nbsp;m (13.1&nbsp;ft) at [[Vilufushi (Thaa Atoll)|Vilufushi Island]]. The tsunami arrived approximately 2 hours after the earthquake. The greatest tsunami inundation occurred at North Male Atoll, Male island at 250 m (0.155 miles) along the streets.\nThe Maldives tsunami wave analysis:\n* 1.3\u20132.4 m (4.27\u20137.87&nbsp;ft) at North Male Atoll, Male Island\n* 2&nbsp;m (6.56&nbsp;ft) at North Male Atoll, Huhule Island\n* 1.7\u20132.8 m (5.58\u20139.2&nbsp;ft) at South Male Atoll, Embudhu Finothu\n* 2.5\u20133.3 m (8.2\u201310.8&nbsp;ft) at Laamu Atoll, Fonadhoo Island\n* 2.2\u20132.9 m (7.2\u20139.51&nbsp;ft) at Laamu Atoll, Gan Island\n* 2.3\u20133.0 m (7.5\u20139.8&nbsp;ft) at North Male Atoll, Dhiffushi Island\n* 2.2\u20132.4 m (7.2\u20137.87&nbsp;ft) at North Male Atoll, Huraa Island\n* more than 1.5&nbsp;m (4.92&nbsp;ft) at North Male Atoll, Kuda Huraa Island\n\n===Myanmar===\nIn [[Myanmar]], the tsunami caused only moderate damage, which arrived between 2 and 5.5 hours after the earthquake. Although the country's western [[Andaman Sea]] coastline lies at the proximity of the rupture zone, there were smaller tsunamis than the neighbouring Thai coast, probably because the main tsunami source did not extend to the Andaman Islands. Another factor is that some coasts of [[Taninthayi Division]] were protected by offshore islands of the [[Myeik Archipelago]]. Based on scientific surveys from Ayeyarwaddy Delta through Taninthayi Division, it is revealed that tsunami heights along the Myanmar coast were between 0.4\u20132.9 m (1.3\u20139.5&nbsp;ft). Eyewitnesses often compared the December tsunami heights with the \"rainy season high tide\"; although at most locations, the tsunami height was similar or smaller than the \"rainy season high tide\" level.<ref name=\"terrapub.co.jp\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS/pdf/2006/5802/58020243.pdf |first1=Kenji |last1=Satake |first2=Than Tin |last2=Aung |first3=Yuki |last3=Sawai |first4=Yukinobu |last4=Okamura |display-authors=1 |title=Tsunami heights and damage along the Myanmar coast from the December 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake |journal=Earth Planets Space |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=243\u2013252 |year=2006 |access-date=22 December 2018 |doi=10.1186/BF03353384 |bibcode=2006EP&S...58..243S }}</ref>\n\nTsunami survey heights:{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n* 0.6\u20132.3 m (1.97\u20137.54&nbsp;ft) around the Ayeyarwady delta\n* 0.9\u20132.9 m (2.95\u20139.5&nbsp;ft) at [[Dawei]] area\n* 0.7\u20132.2 m (2.3\u20137.2&nbsp;ft) around [[Myeik, Burma|Myeik]]\n* 0.4\u20132.6 m (1.3\u20138.5&nbsp;ft) around [[Kawthaung]]\n\nInterviews with local people indicate that they did not feel the earthquake in [[Taninthayi Division]] or Ayeyarwaddy Delta. The 71 casualties can be attributed to poor housing infrastructure and additionally, the fact that the coastal residents in the surveyed areas live on flat land along the coast, especially in the Ayeyarwaddy Delta, and that there is no higher ground to which to evacuate. The tsunami heights from the 2004 December earthquake\nwere not more than 3&nbsp;m (9.8&nbsp;ft) along the Myanmar coast, the amplitudes are slightly large off the Ayeyarwaddy Delta, probably because the shallow delta cause a concentration in tsunami energy.<ref name=\"terrapub.co.jp\"/>\n\n===Somalia===\nThe tsunami travelled 5000&nbsp;km (3106.86 miles) west across the open ocean before striking the East African country of [[Somalia]]. Around 289 fatalities were reported in the [[Horn of Africa]], drowned by four tsunami waves. The hardest-hit was a 650&nbsp;km (403.9 miles) stretch of the Somalia coastline between [[Garacad, Mudug|Garacad]] ([[Mudug]] region) and [[Hafun|Xaafuun]] ([[Bari, Somalia|Bari]] region), which forms part of the [[Puntland]] province.

The two main occupations affected by the tsunami were fishing and tourism.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gunatillake|first=Daya|title=The 2004 Tsunami in Sri Lanka: Destruction and recovery|journal=Geography|year=2007|volume=92|issue=3|pages=285\u2013293|jstor=40574342}}</ref> The impact on coastal fishing communities and the people living there, some of the poorest in the region, has been devastating with high losses of income earners as well as boats and fishing gear.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukabc.org/tsunamis.htm|title=Tsunamis Devastate Fisherfolk of Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea|website=www.ukabc.org|access-date=11 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/70B417968D5FCDD0C1256F8400498CE6-fao-souasi-7jan.pdf|title=Impacts of the Tsunami on Fisheries, Aquaculture and Coastal Livelihoods|date=7 January 2005|website=reliefweb|accessdate=10 March 2019}}</ref> In Sri Lanka artisanal fishery, where the use of fish baskets, fishing traps, and spears are commonly used, is an important source of fish for local markets; industrial fishery is the major economic activity, providing direct employment to about 250,000 people. In recent years the fishery industry has emerged as a dynamic export-oriented sector, generating substantial foreign exchange earnings. Preliminary estimates indicate that 66% of the fishing fleet and industrial infrastructure in coastal regions have been destroyed by the wave surges, which will have adverse economic effects both at local and national levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/indonesia/food-supply-and-food-security-situation-countries-affected-asia-tsunami|title=Food supply and food security situation in countries affected by the Asia tsunami \u2013 Indonesia|website=ReliefWeb|access-date=11 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile the tsunami destroyed many of the boats vital to Sri Lanka's fishing industry, it also created a demand for fibreglass reinforced plastic catamarans in boatyards of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Since over 51,000 vessels were lost to the tsunami, the industry boomed. However, the huge demand has led to lower quality in the process, and some important materials were sacrificed to cut prices for those who were impoverished by the tsunami.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bobpigo.org/bbn/sep_06/pages10-12.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tul4D7Pz?url=http://www.bobpigo.org/bbn/sep_06/pages10-12.pdf |archivedate=1 November 2010 |title=Demand for FRP boats rise after tsunami |accessdate=12 August 2010 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nSome economists believe that damage to the affected national economies will be minor because losses in the tourism and fishing industries are a relatively small percentage of the GDP. However, others caution that damage to infrastructure is an overriding factor. In some areas drinking water supplies and farm fields may have been contaminated for years by saltwater from the ocean.<ref>Pearce, Fred. \"[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6840 Tsunami's salt water may leave islands uninhabitable].\" ''[[New Scientist]].'' 5 January 2005. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422084629/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6840 |date=22 April 2008 }}</ref> Even though only coastal regions were directly affected by the waters of the tsunami, the indirect effects have spread to inland provinces as well. Since the media coverage of the event was so extensive, many tourists cancelled vacations and trips to that part of the world, even though their travel destinations may not have been affected. This ripple effect could especially be felt in the inland provinces of Thailand, such as Krabi, which acted as a starting point for many other tourist destinations in Thailand.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rigg|first=Johnathan|author2=Lisa Lawt |author3=May Tan-Mullins |author4=Carl Grundy-Warr|title=The Indian Ocean Tsunami: Socio-Economic Impacts in Thailand.|journal=The Geographical Journal|date=December 2005|volume=171|issue=4|pages=374\u2013379|jstor=3451210|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4959.2005.00175_3.x|url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/1284/1/1284.pdf?DDD14+dgg0cnm}}</ref>\n\nBoth the earthquake and the tsunami may have affected shipping in the [[Malacca Straits]], which separate Malaysia and the Indonesian island of Sumatra, by changing the depth of the seabed and by disturbing navigational buoys and old shipwrecks. In one area of the Strait, water depths were previously up to {{cvt|4000|ft|m|order=flip}}, and are now only {{cvt|100|ft|m|order=flip}} in some areas, making shipping impossible and dangerous. These problems also made the delivery of relief aid more challenging. Compiling new navigational charts may take months or years. However, officials hope that piracy in the region will drop off as a result of the tsunami.<ref>Staff Writer. \"[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6791600 Tsunami redrew ship channels, ocean floor].\" [[NBC News]]/Associated Press. 5 January 2005.</ref>\n\nCountries in the region appealed to tourists to return, pointing out that most tourist infrastructure is undamaged. However, tourists were reluctant to do so for psychological reasons. Even beach resorts in parts of Thailand which were untouched by the tsunami were hit by cancellations.<ref>Chapter 6, \"Thailand\", in Jayasuriya, Sisira and Peter McCawley, [http://www.e-elgar.co.uk/Bookentry_Main.lasso?id=13668 ''The Asian Tsunami: Aid and Reconstruction after a Disaster''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722005138/http://www.e-elgar.co.uk/Bookentry_Main.lasso?id=13668 |date=22 July 2011 }}.

Also, the spread of solid and liquid waste and industrial chemicals, water pollution and the destruction of [[sewage]] collectors and treatment plants threaten the environment even further, in untold ways. The environmental impact will take a long time and significant resources to assess.<ref>{{cite web|title=Impact of Tsunamis on Ecosystems|work=United Nations Atlas of the Oceans|date=10 March 2005|url=http://www.oceansatlas.org/id/71687|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820112413/http://www.oceansatlas.org/id/71687|url-status = dead|archive-date=20 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to specialists, the main effect is being caused by poisoning of the freshwater supplies and of the soil by saltwater infiltration and a deposit of a salt layer over arable land. It has been reported that in the Maldives, 16 to 17 coral reef atolls that were overcome by sea waves are without fresh water and could be rendered uninhabitable for decades. Uncountable wells that served communities were invaded by sea, sand, and earth; and [[aquifer]]s were invaded through porous rock. Salted-over soil becomes sterile, and it is difficult and costly to restore for agriculture. It also causes the death of plants and important soil micro-organisms. Thousands of rice, mango, and banana plantations in Sri Lanka were destroyed almost entirely and will take years to recover. On the island's east coast, the tsunami contaminated wells on which many villagers relied for drinking water. The Colombo-based [[International Water Management Institute]] monitored the effects of saltwater and concluded that the wells recovered to pre-tsunami drinking water quality one and a half years after the event.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302022712/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%207%20-%20Helping_restore_the_quality_of_drinking_water_after_the_tsunami.pdf Helping restore the quality of drinking water after the tsunami.] [[International Water Management Institute]], 2010.

During the [[British Iron Age]], [[Roman Britain]], and the [[Sub-Roman Britain|early Middle Ages]], this was the homeland of the [[Dumnonii]] [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic]] Celts. (The shift from \"M\" to \"V\" is a typical Celtic [[lenition|consonant shift]].) The [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] resulted in the partial assimilation of Dumnonia into the Kingdom of [[Wessex]] during the eighth and ninth centuries. The western boundary with Cornwall was set at the [[River Tamar]] by [[\u00c6thelstan|King \u00c6thelstan]] in 936. Devon was later constituted as a [[shire]] of the [[Kingdom of England]].\n\nThe north and south coasts of Devon each have both cliffs and sandy shores, and the county's [[bay]]s contain [[seaside resort]]s, [[fishing town]]s, and [[port]]s.

The comparatively mild climate, coastline and landscape make Devon a destination for [[tourism in England|recreation and leisure in England]], with visitors particularly attracted to the Dartmoor and Exmoor [[National Parks in England and Wales|national parks]]; its coasts, including the resort towns along the south coast known collectively as the [[English Riviera]]; the [[Jurassic Coast]], and [[North Devon's Biosphere Reserve|North Devon's UNESCO Biosphere Reserve]]; and the countryside including the [[Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Devon}}\n\n===Toponymy===\nThe name ''Devon'' derives from the name of the [[Britons]] who inhabited the southwestern peninsula of Britain at the time of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] known as the [[Dumnonii]], thought to mean \"deep valley dwellers\" from [[Proto-Celtic language|proto Celtic]] ''*dubnos'' 'deep'. In the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]], Devon is known as {{lang-cy|Dyfnaint}}, {{lang-br|Devnent}} and {{lang-kw|Dewnens}}, each meaning \"deep valleys.\" (For an account of Celtic ''[[Dumnonia]]'', see the separate article.) Among the most common Devon placenames is ''-combe'' which derives from Brittonic ''cwm'' meaning 'valley' usually prefixed by the name of the possessor.\n\n[[William Camden]], in his 1607 edition of ''Britannia'', described Devon as being one part of an older, wider country that once included Cornwall:\n{{quote|THAT region which, according to the Geographers, is the first of all Britaine, and, growing straiter still and narrower, shooteth out farthest into the West, [...] was in antient time inhabited by those Britans whom Solinus called Dumnonii, Ptolomee Damnonii [...] For their habitation all over this Countrey is somewhat low and in valleys, which manner of dwelling is called in the British tongue Dan-munith, in which sense also the Province next adjoyning in like respect is at this day named by the Britans Duffneit, that is to say, Low valleys.

One erroneous theory is that the \"shire\" suffix is due to a mistake in the making of the original letters patent for the [[Duke of Devonshire#Earls of Devon|Duke of Devonshire]], resident in [[Derbyshire]].

Dartmoor is thought to have been occupied by [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]] peoples from about 6000 BC. The Romans held the area under military occupation for around 350 years. Later, the area began to experience Saxon incursions from the east around 600 AD, firstly as small bands of settlers along the coasts of [[Lyme Bay]] and southern estuaries and later as more organised bands pushing in from the east. Devon became a frontier between [[Britons (Celtic people)|Brittonic]]  and [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] Wessex, and it was largely absorbed into Wessex by the mid 9th century.

The county's economy followed the declining trend of British seaside resorts since the mid-20th century, but with some recent revival and regeneration of its resorts, particularly focused around camping; sports such as surfing, cycling, sailing and heritage. This revival has been aided by the designation of much of Devon's countryside and coastline as the Dartmoor and Exmoor national parks, and the Jurassic Coast and Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Sites.

Incomes in much of the South Hams and in villages surrounding Exeter and Plymouth are above the national average.  The claimant count of the unemployed and people receiving very low incomes is close to the national average of 4.5% in Torbay, Plymouth and Exeter.

It also shows the proportion of residents in each district reliant upon lowest income and/or joblessness benefits, the national average proportion of which was 4.5% as at August 2012, the year for which latest datasets have been published.  It can be seen that the most populous district of Devon is East Devon but only if excluding [[Torbay]] which has marginally more residents and Plymouth which has approximately double the number of residents of either of these.

Smaller outcrops of younger rocks also exist, such as Cretaceous [[chalk]] cliffs at Beer Head and gravels on Haldon, plus [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]] [[ball clay]] and [[lignite]] deposits in the Bovey Basin, formed around 50 million years ago under tropical forest conditions.\n\n===Climate===\n{{See also|Dartmoor#Climate|climate of south-west England}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}\nDevon generally has a cool oceanic climate, heavily influenced by the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]]. In winter snow is relatively uncommon away from high land, although there are exceptions. The county has mild summers with occasional warm spells and cool rainy periods. Winters are generally cool and the county often experiences some of the mildest winters in the world for its high latitude, with average daily maximum temperatures in January at {{convert|8|C}}.

Sunshine amounts also vary widely: the moors are generally cloudy, but the SE coast from Salcombe to Exmouth is one of the sunniest parts of the UK (a generally cloudy region). With westerly or southwesterly winds and high pressure the area around Torbay and Teignmouth will often be warm, with long sunny spells due to shelter by high ground ([[Foehn wind]]). \n{{Weather box\n|location = Devon\n|metric first=Yes\n|single line=Yes\n|Jan high C = 8\n|Feb high C = 8\n|Mar high C = 10\n|Apr high C = 12\n|May high C = 15\n|Jun high C = 18\n|Jul high C = 19\n|Aug high C = 19\n|Sep high C = 18\n|Oct high C = 15\n|Nov high C = 11\n|Dec high C = 9\n|year high C = 13.5\n|Jan low C = 4\n|Feb low C = 4\n|Mar low C = 5\n|Apr low C = 6\n|May low C = 8\n|Jun low C = 11\n|Jul low C = 13\n|Aug low C = 13\n|Sep low C = 12\n|Oct low C = 9\n|Nov low C = 7\n|Dec low C = 5\n|year low C = 8\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n{{wide image|Devon fields stitch.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Fields in south Devon after a snowfall.}}\n\n===Ecology===\n[[File:Pnies5.jpg|thumb|Ponies grazing on Exmoor near [[Brendon]], [[North Devon]].]]\nThe variety of habitats means that there is a wide range of wildlife (see [[Dartmoor wildlife]], for example).

Many [[list of Cornish saints|Cornish saints]] are commemorated also in Devon in legends, churches and place-names. [[Western Christianity]] came to Devon when it was over a long period incorporated into the [[Wessex|kingdom of Wessex]] and the jurisdiction of the bishop of Wessex. [[Saint Petroc]] is said to have passed through Devon, where ancient dedications to him are even more numerous than in Cornwall: a probable seventeen (plus [[Timberscombe]] just over the border in Somerset), compared to Cornwall's five. The position of churches bearing his name, including one within the old Roman walls of Exeter, are nearly always near the coast, reminding us that in those days travelling was done mainly by sea. The Devonian villages of [[Petrockstowe]] and [[Newton St Petroc]] are also named after Saint Petroc and the [[flag of Devon]] is dedicated to him.\n\nThe history of Christianity in the South West of England remains to some degree obscure. Parts of the historic county of Devon formed part of the diocese of Wessex, while nothing is known of the church organisation of the Celtic areas. About 703 Devon and Cornwall were included in the separate diocese of Sherborne and in 900 this was again divided into two, the Devon bishop having from 905 his seat at Tawton (now [[Bishop's Tawton]]) and from 912 at [[Crediton]], birthplace of St Boniface. [[Lyfing, Abbot of Tavistock|Lyfing]] became [[Bishop of Crediton]] in 1027 and shortly afterwards became [[Bishop of Cornwall]].\n\nThe two dioceses of Crediton and Cornwall, covering Devon and Cornwall, were permanently united under [[Edward the Confessor]] by Lyfing's successor [[Leofric, Bishop of Exeter|Bishop Leofric]], hitherto Bishop of Crediton, who became first Bishop of Exeter under Edward the Confessor, which was established as his cathedral city in 1050. At first, the abbey church of St Mary and St Peter, founded by Athelstan in 932 and rebuilt in 1019, served as the cathedral.\n\n===Later history===\nIn 1549, the Prayer Book Rebellion caused the deaths of thousands of people from Devon and Cornwall. During the [[English Reformation]], churches in Devon officially became affiliated with the [[Church of England]]. From the late sixteenth century onwards, zealous Protestantism \u2013 or 'puritanism' \u2013 became increasingly well-entrenched in some parts of Devon, while other districts of the county remained much more conservative. These divisions would become starkly apparent during the English Civil War of 1642\u201346, when the county split apart along religious and cultural lines.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stoyle|first1=Mark|title=Loyalty and Locality: Popular Allegiance in Devon during the English Civil War|date=1994|publisher=University of Exeter Press|location=Exeter|isbn=0-85989-428-2|page=passim.}}</ref> The [[Methodism]] of [[John Wesley]] proved to be very popular with the working classes in Devon in the 19th century. Methodist chapels became important social centres, with male voice choirs and other church-affiliated groups playing a central role in the social lives of working class Devonians. Methodism still plays a large part in the religious life of Devon today, although the county has shared in the post-World War II decline in British religious feeling.\n\nThe [[Diocese of Exeter]] remains the Anglican diocese including the whole of Devon.

There are 37 state and 23 independent secondary schools. There are three tertiary ([[Further education|FE]]) colleges and an [[agricultural college]] ([[Bicton College]], near [[Budleigh Salterton]]). Torbay has 8 state (with 3 [[grammar school]]s) and 3 independent secondary schools, and Plymouth has 17 state (with 3 grammar schools \u2013 two female and one male) and one independent school, [[Plymouth College]]. East Devon and Teignbridge have the largest school populations, with West Devon the smallest (with only two schools). Only one school in Exeter, Mid Devon, Torridge and North Devon have a [[sixth form]] \u2013 the schools in other districts mostly have sixth forms, with all schools in West Devon and East Devon having a sixth form.\n\nTwo universities are located in Devon, the [[University of Exeter]] (split between the [[Streatham Campus]] and [[St Luke's Campus]], both in Exeter, and a campus in Cornwall); in Plymouth the [[University of Plymouth]] in Britain is present, along with the [[University of St Mark & St John]] to the city's north. The universities of Exeter and Plymouth have together formed the [[Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry]] which has bases in Exeter and Plymouth. There is also [[Schumacher College]].\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{Main|Cuisine of Devon}}\nThe county has given its name to a number of culinary specialities. The Devonshire [[cream tea]], involving [[Scone (bread)|scones]], [[jam]] and [[clotted cream]], is thought to have originated in Devon (though claims have also been made for neighbouring counties); in other countries, such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], it is known as a \"Devonshire tea\".<ref>Mason, Laura; Brown, Catherine (1999) From Bath Chaps to Bara Brith.

As recently as the 19th century, a crowd of 17,000 at Devonport, near Plymouth, attended a match between the champions of Devon and Cornwall. Another Devon sport was [[Cornish hurling|outhurling]] which was played in some regions until the 20th century (e.g. 1922, at [[Great Torrington]]). Other ancient customs which survive include Dartmoor step dancing, and \"[[Crying The Neck]]\".\n\nDevon has three professional football teams, based in each of its most populous towns and cities. As of the [[2018\u201319 in English football|2018\u20132019 football season]], both [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.]] and [[Exeter City F.C.]] compete in [[Football League Two|English Football League Two]] (the fourth tier), whilst [[Torquay United F.C.]] compete in the [[Conference Premier|National League]] (the fifth tier). Plymouth's highest Football League finish was fourth in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], which was achieved twice, in 1932 and 1953. Torquay and Exeter have never progressed beyond the third tier of the league; Torquay finished second on [[goal average]] in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division (S)]] behind Sir [[Alf Ramsey]]'s [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in 1957. Exeter's highest position has been eighth in the Third Division (S).

The western boundary with Cornwall was set at the [[River Tamar]] by [[\u00c6thelstan|King \u00c6thelstan]] in 936. Devon was later constituted as a [[shire]] of the [[Kingdom of England]].\n\nThe north and south coasts of Devon each have both cliffs and sandy shores, and the county's [[bay]]s contain [[seaside resort]]s, [[fishing town]]s, and [[port]]s.

In the valleys and lowlands of south and east Devon the soil is more fertile, drained by rivers including the [[River Exe|Exe]], the [[River Culm|Culm]], the [[River Teign|Teign]], the [[River Dart|Dart]], and the [[River Otter, Devon|Otter]].\n\nAs well as agriculture, much of the [[economy of Devon]] is based on [[tourism]]. The comparatively mild climate, coastline and landscape make Devon a destination for [[tourism in England|recreation and leisure in England]], with visitors particularly attracted to the Dartmoor and Exmoor [[National Parks in England and Wales|national parks]]; its coasts, including the resort towns along the south coast known collectively as the [[English Riviera]]; the [[Jurassic Coast]], and [[North Devon's Biosphere Reserve|North Devon's UNESCO Biosphere Reserve]]; and the countryside including the [[Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Devon}}\n\n===Toponymy===\nThe name ''Devon'' derives from the name of the [[Britons]] who inhabited the southwestern peninsula of Britain at the time of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] known as the [[Dumnonii]], thought to mean \"deep valley dwellers\" from [[Proto-Celtic language|proto Celtic]] ''*dubnos'' 'deep'. In the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]], Devon is known as {{lang-cy|Dyfnaint}}, {{lang-br|Devnent}} and {{lang-kw|Dewnens}}, each meaning \"deep valleys.\" (For an account of Celtic ''[[Dumnonia]]'', see the separate article.) Among the most common Devon placenames is ''-combe'' which derives from Brittonic ''cwm'' meaning 'valley' usually prefixed by the name of the possessor.\n\n[[William Camden]], in his 1607 edition of ''Britannia'', described Devon as being one part of an older, wider country that once included Cornwall:\n{{quote|THAT region which, according to the Geographers, is the first of all Britaine, and, growing straiter still and narrower, shooteth out farthest into the West, [...] was in antient time inhabited by those Britans whom Solinus called Dumnonii, Ptolomee Damnonii [...] For their habitation all over this Countrey is somewhat low and in valleys, which manner of dwelling is called in the British tongue Dan-munith, in which sense also the Province next adjoyning in like respect is at this day named by the Britans Duffneit, that is to say, Low valleys.

One erroneous theory is that the \"shire\" suffix is due to a mistake in the making of the original letters patent for the [[Duke of Devonshire#Earls of Devon|Duke of Devonshire]], resident in [[Derbyshire]].

Dartmoor is thought to have been occupied by [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]] peoples from about 6000 BC. The Romans held the area under military occupation for around 350 years. Later, the area began to experience Saxon incursions from the east around 600 AD, firstly as small bands of settlers along the coasts of [[Lyme Bay]] and southern estuaries and later as more organised bands pushing in from the east. Devon became a frontier between [[Britons (Celtic people)|Brittonic]]  and [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] Wessex, and it was largely absorbed into Wessex by the mid 9th century.

Plymouth hosts the head office and first ever store of [[The Range (retailer)|The Range]], the only major national retail chain headquartered in Devon.\n\nSince the rise of seaside resorts with the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, Devon's economy has been heavily reliant on tourism. The county's economy followed the declining trend of British seaside resorts since the mid-20th century, but with some recent revival and regeneration of its resorts, particularly focused around camping; sports such as surfing, cycling, sailing and heritage. This revival has been aided by the designation of much of Devon's countryside and coastline as the Dartmoor and Exmoor national parks, and the Jurassic Coast and Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Sites. In 2004 the county's tourist revenue was \u00a31.2&nbsp;billion.<!-- Should try to put this in context of total Devon economy \u2013 the GVA is around 9&nbsp;billion, but I don't know enough about economic statistics to know if it's valid to compare the two? --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/tourism_trends_2005.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=18 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326065518/http://www.devon.gov.uk/tourism_trends_2005.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009  }}</ref> More successful visitor attractions are particularly concentrated on food and drink, including sea-view restaurants in North-West Devon (such as one example belonging to [[Damien Hurst]]), walking the [[South West Coast Path]], cycling on the [[Devon Coast to Coast Cycle Route|Devon Coast to Coast cycle route]] and other cycle routes such as the [[Tarka Trail]] and the Stover Trail; watersports; surfing; indoor and outdoor folk music festivals across the county and sailing in the {{convert|5|mi|adj=on}} hill-surrounded inlet ([[ria]]) at Salcombe.\n\nIncomes vary significantly and the average is bolstered by a high proportion of affluent retired people from across Europe's major cities, particularly from the rest of England. Incomes in much of the South Hams and in villages surrounding Exeter and Plymouth are above the national average.  The claimant count of the unemployed and people receiving very low incomes is close to the national average of 4.5% in Torbay, Plymouth and Exeter.

It also shows the proportion of residents in each district reliant upon lowest income and/or joblessness benefits, the national average proportion of which was 4.5% as at August 2012, the year for which latest datasets have been published.  It can be seen that the most populous district of Devon is East Devon but only if excluding [[Torbay]] which has marginally more residents and Plymouth which has approximately double the number of residents of either of these.

Smaller outcrops of younger rocks also exist, such as Cretaceous [[chalk]] cliffs at Beer Head and gravels on Haldon, plus [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]] [[ball clay]] and [[lignite]] deposits in the Bovey Basin, formed around 50 million years ago under tropical forest conditions.\n\n===Climate===\n{{See also|Dartmoor#Climate|climate of south-west England}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}\nDevon generally has a cool oceanic climate, heavily influenced by the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]]. In winter snow is relatively uncommon away from high land, although there are exceptions. The county has mild summers with occasional warm spells and cool rainy periods. Winters are generally cool and the county often experiences some of the mildest winters in the world for its high latitude, with average daily maximum temperatures in January at {{convert|8|C}}.

Sunshine amounts also vary widely: the moors are generally cloudy, but the SE coast from Salcombe to Exmouth is one of the sunniest parts of the UK (a generally cloudy region). With westerly or southwesterly winds and high pressure the area around Torbay and Teignmouth will often be warm, with long sunny spells due to shelter by high ground ([[Foehn wind]]). \n{{Weather box\n|location = Devon\n|metric first=Yes\n|single line=Yes\n|Jan high C = 8\n|Feb high C = 8\n|Mar high C = 10\n|Apr high C = 12\n|May high C = 15\n|Jun high C = 18\n|Jul high C = 19\n|Aug high C = 19\n|Sep high C = 18\n|Oct high C = 15\n|Nov high C = 11\n|Dec high C = 9\n|year high C = 13.5\n|Jan low C = 4\n|Feb low C = 4\n|Mar low C = 5\n|Apr low C = 6\n|May low C = 8\n|Jun low C = 11\n|Jul low C = 13\n|Aug low C = 13\n|Sep low C = 12\n|Oct low C = 9\n|Nov low C = 7\n|Dec low C = 5\n|year low C = 8\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n{{wide image|Devon fields stitch.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Fields in south Devon after a snowfall.}}\n\n===Ecology===\n[[File:Pnies5.jpg|thumb|Ponies grazing on Exmoor near [[Brendon]], [[North Devon]].]]\nThe variety of habitats means that there is a wide range of wildlife (see [[Dartmoor wildlife]], for example).

Many [[list of Cornish saints|Cornish saints]] are commemorated also in Devon in legends, churches and place-names. [[Western Christianity]] came to Devon when it was over a long period incorporated into the [[Wessex|kingdom of Wessex]] and the jurisdiction of the bishop of Wessex. [[Saint Petroc]] is said to have passed through Devon, where ancient dedications to him are even more numerous than in Cornwall: a probable seventeen (plus [[Timberscombe]] just over the border in Somerset), compared to Cornwall's five. The position of churches bearing his name, including one within the old Roman walls of Exeter, are nearly always near the coast, reminding us that in those days travelling was done mainly by sea. The Devonian villages of [[Petrockstowe]] and [[Newton St Petroc]] are also named after Saint Petroc and the [[flag of Devon]] is dedicated to him.\n\nThe history of Christianity in the South West of England remains to some degree obscure. Parts of the historic county of Devon formed part of the diocese of Wessex, while nothing is known of the church organisation of the Celtic areas. About 703 Devon and Cornwall were included in the separate diocese of Sherborne and in 900 this was again divided into two, the Devon bishop having from 905 his seat at Tawton (now [[Bishop's Tawton]]) and from 912 at [[Crediton]], birthplace of St Boniface. [[Lyfing, Abbot of Tavistock|Lyfing]] became [[Bishop of Crediton]] in 1027 and shortly afterwards became [[Bishop of Cornwall]].\n\nThe two dioceses of Crediton and Cornwall, covering Devon and Cornwall, were permanently united under [[Edward the Confessor]] by Lyfing's successor [[Leofric, Bishop of Exeter|Bishop Leofric]], hitherto Bishop of Crediton, who became first Bishop of Exeter under Edward the Confessor, which was established as his cathedral city in 1050. At first, the abbey church of St Mary and St Peter, founded by Athelstan in 932 and rebuilt in 1019, served as the cathedral.\n\n===Later history===\nIn 1549, the Prayer Book Rebellion caused the deaths of thousands of people from Devon and Cornwall. During the [[English Reformation]], churches in Devon officially became affiliated with the [[Church of England]]. From the late sixteenth century onwards, zealous Protestantism \u2013 or 'puritanism' \u2013 became increasingly well-entrenched in some parts of Devon, while other districts of the county remained much more conservative. These divisions would become starkly apparent during the English Civil War of 1642\u201346, when the county split apart along religious and cultural lines.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stoyle|first1=Mark|title=Loyalty and Locality: Popular Allegiance in Devon during the English Civil War|date=1994|publisher=University of Exeter Press|location=Exeter|isbn=0-85989-428-2|page=passim.}}</ref> The [[Methodism]] of [[John Wesley]] proved to be very popular with the working classes in Devon in the 19th century. Methodist chapels became important social centres, with male voice choirs and other church-affiliated groups playing a central role in the social lives of working class Devonians. Methodism still plays a large part in the religious life of Devon today, although the county has shared in the post-World War II decline in British religious feeling.\n\nThe [[Diocese of Exeter]] remains the Anglican diocese including the whole of Devon.

Ruined medieval settlements of [[Dartmoor longhouse]]s indicate that dispersed rural settlement (OE ''tun'', now often -ton) was very similar to that found in Cornish 'tre-' settlements, however these are generally described with the local placename -(a)cott, from the Old English for homestead, cf. [[cottage]]. Saxon endings in -worthy (from Anglo-Saxon ''worthig'') indicate larger settlements.  Several 'Bere's indicate Anglo-Saxon wood groves, as 'leighs' indicate clearings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/DEV/DevonMisc/Nomenclature.html |title=Origins of Devon Place-Names |website=Genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk |date=2 November 2014 |accessdate=13 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114083054/http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/DEV/DevonMisc/Nomenclature.html |archive-date=14 November 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nDevon has a variety of festivals and traditional practices, including the traditional orchard-visiting [[Wassail]] in [[Whimple]] every 17 January, and the carrying of flaming tar barrels in [[Ottery St. Mary]], where people who have lived in Ottery for long enough are called upon to celebrate [[Guy Fawkes Night|Bonfire Night]] by running through the village (and the gathered crowds) with flaming barrels on their backs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/discovering/legends/ottery_tar_barrels.shtml|title=Ottery Tar Barrels|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519081002/http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/discovering/legends/ottery_tar_barrels.shtml|archive-date=19 May 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Berry Pomeroy]] still celebrates \"Queen's Day\" for [[Elizabeth I]].\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|List of schools in Devon}}\nDevon has a mostly [[comprehensive education]] system. There are 37 state and 23 independent secondary schools. There are three tertiary ([[Further education|FE]]) colleges and an [[agricultural college]] ([[Bicton College]], near [[Budleigh Salterton]]). Torbay has 8 state (with 3 [[grammar school]]s) and 3 independent secondary schools, and Plymouth has 17 state (with 3 grammar schools \u2013 two female and one male) and one independent school, [[Plymouth College]]. East Devon and Teignbridge have the largest school populations, with West Devon the smallest (with only two schools). Only one school in Exeter, Mid Devon, Torridge and North Devon have a [[sixth form]] \u2013 the schools in other districts mostly have sixth forms, with all schools in West Devon and East Devon having a sixth form.\n\nTwo universities are located in Devon, the [[University of Exeter]] (split between the [[Streatham Campus]] and [[St Luke's Campus]], both in Exeter, and a campus in Cornwall); in Plymouth the [[University of Plymouth]] in Britain is present, along with the [[University of St Mark & St John]] to the city's north. The universities of Exeter and Plymouth have together formed the [[Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry]] which has bases in Exeter and Plymouth. There is also [[Schumacher College]].\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{Main|Cuisine of Devon}}\nThe county has given its name to a number of culinary specialities. The Devonshire [[cream tea]], involving [[Scone (bread)|scones]], [[jam]] and [[clotted cream]], is thought to have originated in Devon (though claims have also been made for neighbouring counties); in other countries, such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], it is known as a \"Devonshire tea\".<ref>Mason, Laura; Brown, Catherine (1999) From Bath Chaps to Bara Brith.

As recently as the 19th century, a crowd of 17,000 at Devonport, near Plymouth, attended a match between the champions of Devon and Cornwall. Another Devon sport was [[Cornish hurling|outhurling]] which was played in some regions until the 20th century (e.g. 1922, at [[Great Torrington]]). Other ancient customs which survive include Dartmoor step dancing, and \"[[Crying The Neck]]\".\n\nDevon has three professional football teams, based in each of its most populous towns and cities. As of the [[2018\u201319 in English football|2018\u20132019 football season]], both [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.]] and [[Exeter City F.C.]] compete in [[Football League Two|English Football League Two]] (the fourth tier), whilst [[Torquay United F.C.]] compete in the [[Conference Premier|National League]] (the fifth tier). Plymouth's highest Football League finish was fourth in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], which was achieved twice, in 1932 and 1953. Torquay and Exeter have never progressed beyond the third tier of the league; Torquay finished second on [[goal average]] in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division (S)]] behind Sir [[Alf Ramsey]]'s [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in 1957. Exeter's highest position has been eighth in the Third Division (S). The county's biggest non-league clubs are [[Bideford F.C.]] which competes in the [[Southern Football League Premier Division]], and [[Tiverton Town F.C.]] which is in the [[Southern Football League Division One South and West]].\n\n[[Rugby Union]] is popular in Devon with over forty clubs under the banner of the [[Devon Rugby Football Union]], many with various teams at senior, youth and junior levels. One club \u2013 [[Exeter Chiefs]] play in the [[English Premiership (rugby union)|Aviva Premiership]], winning the title in 2017 for the first time in their history after beating [[Wasps RFC]] in the final 23\u201320. [[Plymouth Albion R.F.C.|Plymouth Albion]] who are, {{as of|2017|lc=y}}, in the [[National League 1]] (The 3rd tier of English Professional Rugby Union.\n\nThere are five [[rugby league]] teams in Devon. [[Plymouth R.L.F.C|Plymouth Titans]], [[Exeter Centurions]], [[Torquay|Devon Sharks]] from Torquay, North Devon Raiders from Barnstaple and [[East Devon Eagles]] from [[Exmouth]]. They all play in the [[Rugby League Conference]].\n\nIn basketball, [[Plymouth Raiders]] play in the [[British Basketball League]]. [[Tamar Valley Cannons]], also based in Plymouth, are Devon's only other representatives in the National Leagues. [[Motorcycle speedway]] is also supported in the county, with both the [[Exeter Falcons]] and [[Plymouth Devils]] succeeding in the National Leagues in recent years.\n\nThe [[University of Exeter Hockey Club]] enter teams in both the [[Men's England Hockey League|Men's]] and [[Women's England Hockey League]]s.\n\nHorse Racing is also popular in the county, with two [[National Hunt]] racecourses (Exeter and Newton Abbot), and numerous [[point to point (steeplechase)|point to point]] courses. There are also many successful professional racehorse trainers based in Devon.\n\nThe county is represented in [[cricket]] by [[Devon County Cricket Club]], who play at a [[Minor counties of English and Welsh cricket|Minor counties]] level.\n\n==Devonians==\n\n===Notable people===\n{{Main|Notable people from Devon}}\n[[File:Agatha Christie.png|thumb|upright|[[Agatha Christie]], best selling crime novelist]]\n\nDevon is known for its [[sailor|mariner]]s, such as Sir Francis Drake, Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]], Sir [[Richard Grenville (Elizabethan sailor)|Richard Grenville]], Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], and Sir [[Francis Chichester]].

Madej is a true skeptic of all that is non-scientific and constantly provides comedic relief toward spiritual encounters; however, he sometimes regards [[Bigfoot]] and aliens as somewhat realistic or grounded in reality.<ref name=\":0\" /> Those in support of Bergara have been called the \"Boogaras\" and those supporting Madej's skepticism have been labeled the \"Shaniacs\".\n\nThe similarities and contrasts between the Shaniacs and the Boogaras can be clearly seen in the questions submitted to BUN and the ones read by Ryan and Shane during their ''Postmortem'' episodes where they answer the most pressing questions on the most recent episodes of BuzzFeed Unsolved. \n\nOther important members of the main Unsolved crew include TJ Marchbank, 1st AD, Devon Joralmon, line producer, and cameraman Mark Celestino. Due to the show's growth in popularity, Bergara works with a number of individuals to propose cases and if the show is capable of covering them, while Madej is kept out of the process to give a more fresh perspective.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/54885-buzzfeed-unsolved-true-crime-how-the-hosts-pick-new-crime-cases|title=How Choosing New Crimes Changed 'BuzzFeed Unsolved'|last=Francisco|first=Eric|website=Inverse|language=en|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Style ===\nThe episodes are normally filmed as the two hosts at a desk, with Bergara presenting Madej and the audience with either a True Crime case or a Paranormal case with the use of stock photos and other visuals. In some cases the two hosts and other crew members travel to investigate the locations, although this method is primarily used for the ''Supernatural'' episodes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.michigandaily.com/section/arts/%E2%80%98buzzfeed-unsolved%E2%80%99-spooky-salve-lonely-generation|title='Buzzfeed: Unsolved' a spooky salve for a lonely generation|last=Anantharaman|first=Maitreyi|date=February 5, 2019|website=The Michigan Daily|language=en|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref> Often, the paranormal investigations seek to answer the question \"Are Ghosts Real?\" and collect evidence using video and [[Electronic voice phenomenon|audio devices]]. Other '' Buzzfeed Unsolved: Paranormal'' episodes investigate other supernatural entities/phenomenas such as [[mothman]], [[bigfoot]] and the [[Extraterrestrial life| existence of aliens]]. The two aim to create an \"everyman approach\" in discussing the cases with the use of humor in an effort to balance the tone between dark and goofy.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Guests ===\nIn ''BuzzFeed Unsolved: Supernatural'' Season 4 ''[[Ancient Aliens]]'' contributor [[Giorgio A.

While the character originally emerged as part of a joke, it quickly became more than this and fans are severely worried or Bergara's spiritual health, believing that he may be possessed by a demon. Other fan favorites include C.C Tinsley, a real-life detective whose apparent disappearance (which was fortunately fictional) brought much appeal to Shane's ground-breaking performance. Some fans believe he should have been given an Oscar.\n\nA popular theory, although many fans accept it as fact, is that Shane Madej may be a demon. There have been numerous pieces of evidence that would indicate this to be true. During Postmortem episodes, guest co-hosts are occasionally brought in. \n\n=== North American Land Claims ===\n\nDuring episode 4 of the 3rd season (\"The Demonic Goatman's Bridge) Madej and Bergara claimed the Shane and Ryan Bridge (formerly the [[Old Alton Bridge]]/Goatman's Bridge)<ref>Buzzfeed Unsolved Network [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEZfGlyLQnA&list=PLD8iUdp33PqQuSYl9EljppQERLUlsDtR5&index=53 \"The Demonic Goatman's Bridge\"] Nov. 3, 2017 </ref>. This bridge allegedly is where the Demonic Goatman resides, and the duo challenged the goatman to appear. Upon failing to do so, it forfeited its bridge to Shane Madej and Ryan Bergara. Cowards at wikipedia have protected the page on Old Alton Bridge, and in doing so refuse to realise the fact that the bridge does, in fact, belong to Madej and Bergara.  The area claimed during the investigation is popularly considered a sovereign state, however it remains un-acknowledged by the United Nations.<ref>United Nations [https://www.un.org/en/member-states/ Member States] </ref>\n\n=== Hosts ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!True Crime Presenters\n|\n* Ryan Bergara (2016-present)\n\n* Shane Madej (2016-present)\n\n* Brent Bennett (2016)\n|-\n!Supernatural Presenters\n|\n* Ryan Bergara (2016-present)\n\n* Shane Madej (2016-present)\n|-\n!Sports Conspiracies Presenters\n|\n* Ryan Bergara (2018)\n* Zack Evans (2018)\n|-\n!Buzzfeed Unsolved - Postmortem Presenters\n|\n* Ryan Bergara (2017-present)\n\n* Shane Madej (2017-present)\n|}\n\n==Episodes==\n\n=== BuzzFeed Unsolved \u2013 True Crime ===\n\n==== Season 1 ====\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n!#\n!Episode\n!Published\n|-\n|1\n|The Mysterious Death of the [[Tamam Shud case|Somerton Man]]\n|February 4, 2016\n|-\n|2\n|The Horrifying Unsolved Slaughter at [[Hinterkaifeck murders|Hinterkaifeck Farm]]\n|February 20, 2016\n|-\n|3\n|The Bizarre [[Death of Elisa Lam]]\n|March 18, 2016\n|-\n|4\n|The Chilling Mystery of the [[Black Dahlia]]\n|April 1, 2016\n|-\n|5\n|The Strange Deaths of the 9 Hikers of [[Dyatlov Pass incident|Dyatlov Pass]]\n|April 15, 2016\n|-\n|6\n|The Mysterious Death of [[Tupac Shakur]] - Part 1\n|May 20, 2016\n|-\n|7\n|The Mysterious Death of [[Biggie Smalls]] - Part 2\n|May 27, 2016\n|-\n|8\n|The Horrifying Murders of the [[Zodiac Killer]]\n|June 24, 2016\n|-\n|9\n|The Mysterious [[Sodder children disappearance|Disappearance of the Sodder Children]]\n|December 23, 2016\n|-\n|10\n|The Odd Death of [[Michelle Von Emster case|Michelle Von Emster]]\n|January 27, 2017\n|-\n|11\n|The Shocking Case of [[O.

The first episode of the Hot Daga Saga began at the end of the Postmortem episode \"The Boy in the Box - Q+A\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPfbqY4REL8 |title=The Boy In The Box - Q+A |author=BuzzFeed Multiplayer |via=YouTube}}</ref> Although at the beginning of episodes, Madej jokes that the show is commissioned by his co-host Ryan Bergara, Bergara is infamously not a fan of the series. However, Bergara listens to the show as it is narrated to the audience, though he does not fail to admonish it at any given opportunity. He once wore a T-shirt with a caption stating 'I hate the Hot Daga', although many have claimed this to be untrue.\n\nNotable characters include Pam, the evil hotdog witch, Gene, the french fries, Maizie, a holographic lesbian corn icon, and the Plupples (fruits that are like peaches, but sexier and blue). Another character, Dr. Ernesto Gordon Goondis, is voiced by Bergara through Madej's splicing of many of his dialogues from ''Unsolved'' and connecting them to create the voice of the character.\n\nThe series originated when Madej jokingly wanted a [[skateboarding]] [[hot dog]] at the end of a Q + A episode, and it has grown to multiple mini-episodes and musical numbers which are sung by Madej himself. These are brilliant musical creations which deserve TONY awards, sung with passion and feeling. Since Season 5 of True Crime, the end of some Postmortem episodes have included a \"Roast Mortem\" section where the hosts go through commenters' roasts on the hosts in the episode in question. This segment has replaced the Hot Daga episodes. Fans of the Hot Daga have created many memes in protest of this. Madej has yet to address the backlash, and it remains to be seen whether or not the will of the people will reign victorious.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{YouTube|c=UCKijjvu6bN1c-ZHVwR7-5WA|Buzzfeed Unsolved Network}}\n*{{IMDb title|7194764|Buzzfeed Unsolved: True Crime}}\n*{{IMDb title|6723522|Buzzfeed Unsolved: Supernatural}}\n\n{{BuzzFeed}}\n\n[[Category:2016 web series debuts]]\n[[Category:American web series]]\n[[Category:Documentary web series]]\n[[Category:Mystery web series]]\n[[Category:YouTube series]]\n[[Category:BuzzFeed]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American investigative web series}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = BuzzFeed Unsolved\n| image                    = BuzzfeedUnsolvedLogo.png\n| caption                  = \n| show_name_2              = Unsolved\n| genre                    = [[Factual television]]\n| creator                  = Ryan Bergara\n| based_on                 = <!-- {{based on|work|author}} -->\n| developer                = \n| writer                   = Ryan Bergara, \nShane Madej\n| screenplay               = \n| story                    = \n| director                 = \n| creative_director        = \n| presenter                = \n| starring                 = Ryan Bergara<br />Shane Madej<br />Brent Bennett<br/>Zack Evans\n| judges                   = <!-- Organized by broadcast credit order, with new main cast added to the end of the list -->\n| voices                   = <!-- Organized by broadcast credit order, with new main cast added to the end of the list -->\n| narrated                 = \n| theme_music_composer     = Audio Network<br />[[Warner Chappell Music]]<br />AudioBlocks\n| opentheme                = \n| endtheme                 = \n| composer                 = \n| country                  = [[United States]]\n| language                 = English\n| num_seasons              = ''True Crime'': 6<br />''Supernatural'': 6<br />\n| num_episodes             = ''True Crime'': 53<br />''Supernatural'': 49\n| executive_producer       = Matthew Henick<ref name=JFK>{{cite av media|title=JFK - Q+A (Special Announcement)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PHwBeEwSU&t=422|author=BuzzfeedBlue|date=October 4, 2017|work=YouTube|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}</ref>\n| producer                 = Ryan Bergara, Shane Madej\n| news_editor              = <!-- Content editor or editors of a current affairs/political show such as Newsnight. -->\n| cinematography           = \n| editor                   = Anthony Frederick<br />Steven Castro<br />Mike Reilly<br />Grant Henderson<br />Devlin McClusky<ref name=JFK/>\n| camera                   = \n| runtime                  = <!-- Reliable source required -->\n| company                  = [[BuzzFeed]]<br />BuzzFeed Multiplayer\n| distributor              = \n| budget                   = \n| network                  = [[YouTube]]<br />[[BuzzFeed]]\n| picture_format           = \n| audio_format             = \n| first_run                = <!-- The nation in which the series first aired, if different from country parameter -->\n| first_aired              = {{Start date|2016|2|4}}\n| last_aired               = {{End date|present}}\n| related                  = <!-- To be used only for remakes, spin-offs, and adaptations -->\n| production_website       = \n}}\n\n'''''BuzzFeed Unsolved''''' (also known as simply '''''Unsolved''''') is an American documentary entertainment [[web series]] created and produced by Ryan Bergara.

Madej took over from the original co-host, Brent Bennett, in late 2016.<ref name=\"Gorsek\" /><ref name=\"Medium\">{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@lauren_victoria/hey-demons-its-me-ya-boi-how-buzzfeed-unsolved-is-bringing-out-the-pseudo-sleuths-in-all-of-968cd54b2c18|title=\"Hey Demons, it's me\u2026 ya boi\" \u2013 how Buzzfeed Unsolved is bringing out the pseudo-sleuths in all of us.|last=Entwistle|first=Lauren|date=September 21, 2017|publisher=Medium|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}</ref> The greatest difference between Bennett and Madej lay in their responses to Bergara's theories: unlike Bennett, who would humor Bergara, Madej stands firm as a skeptic; this stark dichotomy proved the missing piece of the puzzle for the show.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/47452-buzzfeed-unsolved-spoilers-interview-ryan-bergara-shane-madej|accessdate=September 11, 2018|title=The Internet's Funniest Ghost Hunters Aren't Going to Solve Anything}}</ref> \n\nThe contrast between Bergara's belief in conspiracies and the paranormal versus Madej's skepticism provides the majority of the dialogue.<ref name=\"Pellock\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/buzzfeed-unsolved-great-show-watch-halloween-season|title=\"BuzzFeed Unsolved\" Is A Great Show To Watch This Halloween Season|last=Pellock|first=Megan|date=October 25, 2017|publisher=The Odyssey|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Medium\" /> Bergara strongly believes in otherworldly spirits like ghosts or poltergeists, and frequently defends the existence of these throughout the series. However, Bergara shows reluctance towards things such as Bigfoot and sometimes aliens. Madej is a true skeptic of all that is non-scientific and constantly provides comedic relief toward spiritual encounters; however, he sometimes regards [[Bigfoot]] and aliens as somewhat realistic or grounded in reality.<ref name=\":0\" /> Those in support of Bergara have been called the \"Boogaras\" and those supporting Madej's skepticism have been labeled the \"Shaniacs\".\n\nThe similarities and contrasts between the Shaniacs and the Boogaras can be clearly seen in the questions submitted to BUN and the ones read by Ryan and Shane during their ''Postmortem'' episodes where they answer the most pressing questions on the most recent episodes of BuzzFeed Unsolved. \n\nOther important members of the main Unsolved crew include TJ Marchbank, 1st AD, Devon Joralmon, line producer, and cameraman Mark Celestino. Due to the show's growth in popularity, Bergara works with a number of individuals to propose cases and if the show is capable of covering them, while Madej is kept out of the process to give a more fresh perspective.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/54885-buzzfeed-unsolved-true-crime-how-the-hosts-pick-new-crime-cases|title=How Choosing New Crimes Changed 'BuzzFeed Unsolved'|last=Francisco|first=Eric|website=Inverse|language=en|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Style ===\nThe episodes are normally filmed as the two hosts at a desk, with Bergara presenting Madej and the audience with either a True Crime case or a Paranormal case with the use of stock photos and other visuals. In some cases the two hosts and other crew members travel to investigate the locations, although this method is primarily used for the ''Supernatural'' episodes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.michigandaily.com/section/arts/%E2%80%98buzzfeed-unsolved%E2%80%99-spooky-salve-lonely-generation|title='Buzzfeed: Unsolved' a spooky salve for a lonely generation|last=Anantharaman|first=Maitreyi|date=February 5, 2019|website=The Michigan Daily|language=en|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref> Often, the paranormal investigations seek to answer the question \"Are Ghosts Real?\" and collect evidence using video and [[Electronic voice phenomenon|audio devices]]. Other '' Buzzfeed Unsolved: Paranormal'' episodes investigate other supernatural entities/phenomenas such as [[mothman]], [[bigfoot]] and the [[Extraterrestrial life| existence of aliens]]. The two aim to create an \"everyman approach\" in discussing the cases with the use of humor in an effort to balance the tone between dark and goofy.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Guests ===\nIn ''BuzzFeed Unsolved: Supernatural'' Season 4 ''[[Ancient Aliens]]'' contributor [[Giorgio A.

While the character originally emerged as part of a joke, it quickly became more than this and fans are severely worried or Bergara's spiritual health, believing that he may be possessed by a demon. Other fan favorites include C.C Tinsley, a real-life detective whose apparent disappearance (which was fortunately fictional) brought much appeal to Shane's ground-breaking performance. Some fans believe he should have been given an Oscar.\n\nA popular theory, although many fans accept it as fact, is that Shane Madej may be a demon. There have been numerous pieces of evidence that would indicate this to be true. During Postmortem episodes, guest co-hosts are occasionally brought in. \n\n=== North American Land Claims ===\n\nDuring episode 4 of the 3rd season (\"The Demonic Goatman's Bridge) Madej and Bergara claimed the Shane and Ryan Bridge (formerly the [[Old Alton Bridge]]/Goatman's Bridge)<ref>Buzzfeed Unsolved Network [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEZfGlyLQnA&list=PLD8iUdp33PqQuSYl9EljppQERLUlsDtR5&index=53 \"The Demonic Goatman's Bridge\"] Nov. 3, 2017 </ref>. This bridge allegedly is where the Demonic Goatman resides, and the duo challenged the goatman to appear. Upon failing to do so, it forfeited its bridge to Shane Madej and Ryan Bergara. Cowards at wikipedia have protected the page on Old Alton Bridge, and in doing so refuse to realise the fact that the bridge does, in fact, belong to Madej and Bergara.  The area claimed during the investigation is popularly considered a sovereign state, however it remains un-acknowledged by the United Nations.<ref>United Nations [https://www.un.org/en/member-states/ Member States] </ref>\n\n=== Hosts ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!True Crime Presenters\n|\n* Ryan Bergara (2016-present)\n\n* Shane Madej (2016-present)\n\n* Brent Bennett (2016)\n|-\n!Supernatural Presenters\n|\n* Ryan Bergara (2016-present)\n\n* Shane Madej (2016-present)\n|-\n!Sports Conspiracies Presenters\n|\n* Ryan Bergara (2018)\n* Zack Evans (2018)\n|-\n!Buzzfeed Unsolved - Postmortem Presenters\n|\n* Ryan Bergara (2017-present)\n\n* Shane Madej (2017-present)\n|}\n\n==Episodes==\n\n=== BuzzFeed Unsolved \u2013 True Crime ===\n\n==== Season 1 ====\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n!#\n!Episode\n!Published\n|-\n|1\n|The Mysterious Death of the [[Tamam Shud case|Somerton Man]]\n|February 4, 2016\n|-\n|2\n|The Horrifying Unsolved Slaughter at [[Hinterkaifeck murders|Hinterkaifeck Farm]]\n|February 20, 2016\n|-\n|3\n|The Bizarre [[Death of Elisa Lam]]\n|March 18, 2016\n|-\n|4\n|The Chilling Mystery of the [[Black Dahlia]]\n|April 1, 2016\n|-\n|5\n|The Strange Deaths of the 9 Hikers of [[Dyatlov Pass incident|Dyatlov Pass]]\n|April 15, 2016\n|-\n|6\n|The Mysterious Death of [[Tupac Shakur]] - Part 1\n|May 20, 2016\n|-\n|7\n|The Mysterious Death of [[Biggie Smalls]] - Part 2\n|May 27, 2016\n|-\n|8\n|The Horrifying Murders of the [[Zodiac Killer]]\n|June 24, 2016\n|-\n|9\n|The Mysterious [[Sodder children disappearance|Disappearance of the Sodder Children]]\n|December 23, 2016\n|-\n|10\n|The Odd Death of [[Michelle Von Emster case|Michelle Von Emster]]\n|January 27, 2017\n|-\n|11\n|The Shocking Case of [[O.

It's the bst story ever and should win an award. The first episode of the Hot Daga Saga began at the end of the Postmortem episode \"The Boy in the Box - Q+A\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPfbqY4REL8 |title=The Boy In The Box - Q+A |author=BuzzFeed Multiplayer |via=YouTube}}</ref> Although at the beginning of episodes, Madej jokes that the show is commissioned by his co-host Ryan Bergara, Bergara is infamously not a fan of the series. However, Bergara listens to the show as it is narrated to the audience, though he does not fail to admonish it at any given opportunity. He once wore a T-shirt with a caption stating 'I hate the Hot Daga', although many have claimed this to be untrue.\n\nNotable characters include Pam, the evil hotdog witch, Gene, the french fries, Maizie, a holographic lesbian corn icon, and the Plupples (fruits that are like peaches, but sexier and blue). Another character, Dr. Ernesto Gordon Goondis, is voiced by Bergara through Madej's splicing of many of his dialogues from ''Unsolved'' and connecting them to create the voice of the character.\n\nThe series originated when Madej jokingly wanted a [[skateboarding]] [[hot dog]] at the end of a Q + A episode, and it has grown to multiple mini-episodes and musical numbers which are sung by Madej himself. These are brilliant musical creations which deserve TONY awards, sung with passion and feeling. Since Season 5 of True Crime, the end of some Postmortem episodes have included a \"Roast Mortem\" section where the hosts go through commenters' roasts on the hosts in the episode in question. This segment has replaced the Hot Daga episodes. Fans of the Hot Daga have created many memes in protest of this. Madej has yet to address the backlash, and it remains to be seen whether or not the will of the people will reign victorious.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{YouTube|c=UCKijjvu6bN1c-ZHVwR7-5WA|Buzzfeed Unsolved Network}}\n*{{IMDb title|7194764|Buzzfeed Unsolved: True Crime}}\n*{{IMDb title|6723522|Buzzfeed Unsolved: Supernatural}}\n\n{{BuzzFeed}}\n\n[[Category:2016 web series debuts]]\n[[Category:American web series]]\n[[Category:Documentary web series]]\n[[Category:Mystery web series]]\n[[Category:YouTube series]]\n[[Category:BuzzFeed]]\n", "name_user": "Brymer514", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe Hot Daga", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuzzFeed_Unsolved"}

Traditionally, a prominent form of such memes consisted of [[image macros]] paired with a concept or catchphrase. In some cases, these memes used words and phrases contain intentional misspellings (such as [[lolcat]]s) or incorrect grammar (such as [[Doge (meme)|doge]] and \"[[All your base are belong to us]]\"). However, in more recent times, memes have evolved from simple image macros with text to more elaborate forms such as challenges, [[GIF]]s and [[Viral phenomenon|viral sensations]]. These small movements tend to spread from person to person via [[social network]]s, [[blog]]s, direct [[email]], or news sources. They may relate to various existing [[Internet culture]]s or [[subculture]]s, often created or spread on various websites. Fads and sensations tend to grow rapidly on the Internet, because the instant communication facilitates [[word of mouth]] transmission. Examples of such fads include posting a photo of people lying down in public places (called \"[[planking (fad)|planking]]\") and uploading a short video of people doing the [[Harlem Shake (meme)|Harlem Shake]]. \u201cDank\u201d memes have emerged as a new form of image-macros, defined by the inclusion of more surreal and nonsensical themes. \n\nThe word ''meme'' was coined by [[Richard Dawkins]] in his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' as an attempt to explain how ideas replicate, mutate and evolve ([[memetics]]).<ref name=\"cream\">{{Citation |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Selfish Gene |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1989 |edition=2 |isbn=978-0-19-286092-7 |page=192 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkHO9HI7koEC&pg=PA192 |quote=We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of ''imitation''. 'Mimeme' comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like 'gene'. I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to ''meme''. If it is any consolation, it could alternatively be thought of as being related to 'memory', or to the French word ''m\u00eame''. It should be pronounced to rhyme with 'cream'. |access-date=June 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316114026/http://books.google.com/books?id=WkHO9HI7koEC&pg=PA192 |archive-date=March 16, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> The concept of the Internet meme was first proposed by [[Mike Godwin]] in the June 1993 issue of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''. In 2013, Dawkins characterized an Internet meme as being a meme deliberately altered by human creativity\u2014distinguished from biological genes and his own pre-Internet concept of a meme, which involved mutation by random change and spreading through accurate replication as in Darwinian selection.<ref name=Wired20130620>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-06/20/richard-dawkins-memes |title=Richard Dawkins on The Internet's hijacking of the word 'meme' |last=Solon |first=Olivia |date=June 20, 2013 |journal=Wired UK |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709152558/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-06/20/richard-dawkins-memes |archivedate=July 9, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Dawkins explained that Internet memes are thus a \"hijacking of the original idea\", the very idea of a meme having mutated and evolved in this new direction.<ref name=Saatchi20130622>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFn-ixX9edg |title=Just for Hits |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |date=June 22, 2013 |website=The Saatchi & Saatchi New Directors' Showcase |access-date=June 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617051511/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFn-ixX9edg |archive-date=June 17, 2015 |url-status=live}} (video of speech)</ref> Furthermore, Internet memes carry an additional property that ordinary memes do not: Internet memes leave a footprint in the media through which they propagate (for example, social networks) that renders them traceable and analyzable.<ref name=CosciaHarvardCID2013>{{Cite arXiv |eprint=1304.1712 |title=Competition and Success in the Meme Pool: a Case Study on Quickmeme.com |last=Coscia |first=Michele |date=April 5, 2013 |class=physics.soc-ph}} Paper explained for laymen by {{Cite web |url=http://qz.com/98677/why-youll-share-this-story-the-new-science-of-memes/ |title=Why you'll share this story: The new science of memes |last=Mims |first=Christopher |date=June 28, 2013 |website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703055640/http://qz.com/98677/why-youll-share-this-story-the-new-science-of-memes/ |archivedate=July 3, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nEarly in the Internet's history, memes were primarily spread via [[email]] or [[Usenet]] discussion communities. [[Internet forum|Messageboards]] and [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroups]] were also popular because they allowed a simple method for people to share information or memes with a diverse population of Internet users in a short period. They encourage communication between people, and thus between meme sets, that do not normally come in contact. Furthermore, they actively promote meme-sharing within the messageboard or newsgroup population by asking for feedback, comments, opinions, etc. This format is what gave rise to early Internet memes, like the [[The Hampsterdance Song|Hampster Dance]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Another factor in the increased meme transmission observed over the Internet is its interactive nature. [[Publishing|Print]] matter, [[radio]], and [[television]] are all essentially passive experiences requiring the reader, listener, or viewer to perform all necessary cognitive processing; in contrast, the social nature of the Internet allows phenomena to propagate more readily. Many phenomena are also spread via [[web search engine]]s, [[Internet forum]]s, [[social networking service]]s, [[Social news website|social news]] sites, and [[video hosting service]]s. Much of the Internet's ability to spread information is assisted from results found through search engines, which can allow users to find memes even with obscure information.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Memes On the Internet |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C004367/ce7.shtml |publisher=[[Oracle Thinkquest]] |access-date=November 30, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511193449/http://library.thinkquest.org/C004367/ce7.shtml |archivedate=May 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Marshall |first=Garry |title=The Internet and Memetics |url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Conf/MemePap/Marshall.html |publisher=School of Computing Science, [[Middlesex University]]|access-date=November 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119134239/http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Conf/MemePap/Marshall.html|archive-date=January 19, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Evolution and propagation ==\n[[File:Typical internet meme image format.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Typical format for image macros.]]\nInternet memes grew as a concept in the mid-1990s. At the time, memes were just short clips that were shared between people in [[Usenet]] forums. As the Internet evolved, so did memes. When [[YouTube]] was released in 2005, video memes became popular. Around this time, [[rickrolling]] became popular and the link to this video was sent around via email or other messaging sites. Video sharing also created memes such as \"[[Turn Down for What]]\" and the \"[[Harlem Shake (meme)|Harlem Shake]]\". As social media websites such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] started appearing, it was now easy to share [[GIF]]s and [[image macro]]s to a large audience. Meme generator websites were created to let users create their own memes out of existing templates. Memes during this time could remain popular for a long time, from a few months to a decade, which contrasts with the fast lifespan of modern memes.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/story/guide-memes/ |title=The WIRED Guide to Memes |journal=WIRED|access-date=November 30, 2018 |first1=Angela |last1=Watercutter |first2=Emma |last2=Grey Ellisby |date=April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190201164321/https://www.wired.com/story/guide-memes/|archive-date=February 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAn Internet meme may stay the same or may evolve over time, by chance or through commentary, imitations, [[parody]], or by incorporating news accounts about itself. Internet memes can evolve and spread extremely rapidly, sometimes reaching worldwide popularity within a few days. Internet memes usually are formed from some social interaction, pop culture reference, or situations people often find themselves in.

The meme features the host Andre shooting his co-host Buress in the first frame and then lamenting that his co-host has been shot in the next, with Andre often depicted blaming someone else for the shot.

So-called \"moth\" memes (often stylized with diacritics on the \"o\": \"m\u00f6th\") came about after a [[Reddit]] user posted a close up picture of a [[moth]] that they had found outside their window onto the r/creepy [[subreddit]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/8ys873/close_up_of_moth_outside_my_window/ |title=Close up of moth outside my window |author=u/No_Reason27 |date=July 2018|access-date=November 30, 2018 |website=[[Reddit]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006145655/https://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/8ys873/close_up_of_moth_outside_my_window/|archive-date=October 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> This image of a moth became popular, and began to be used in memes. These moth memes usually revolved around the moth wanting to find a [[Light fixture|lamp]]. According to Chris Grinter, a [[lepidopterist]] from the [[California Academy of Sciences]], these memes took off because people find moths' attraction to lamps quite strange and this phenomenon is still not completely explained by science.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/the-latest-viral-meme-trend-is-possibly-not-as-stupid-as-you-think/ |website=IFL Science |access-date=November 30, 2018 |title=The Latest Viral Meme Trend Is (Possibly) Not As Stupid As You Think |first=Katie |last=Spalding |date=October 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002222940/https://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/the-latest-viral-meme-trend-is-possibly-not-as-stupid-as-you-think/ |archive-date=October 2, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|They did surgery on a grape}}\nMany modern memes stem from nonsense or otherwise unrelated phrases that are then repeated and placed onto other formats.

The section provides that if a copyrighted work is reproduced for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research, it would not amount to infringement. Notably for memes, the use of the term ''\"such as\"'' in the section denotes that the list is not exhaustive but merely illustrative. Furthermore, the factors mentioned in the section are subjective in nature and the weight of each factor varies on a case to case basis.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal |last1=Patel |first1=Ronak |title=First World Problems:' A Fair Use Analysis of Internet Memes |url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt96h003jt/qt96h003jt.pdf?t=nndf5x&v=lg |journal=UCLA Entertainment Law Review |volume=20 |issue=2}}</ref> All the factors have to be weighed together and an overall assessment is made whether the infringing work would qualify as fair use.\n\nThe four factors are:\n#The purpose or character of use,\n#The nature of the copyrighted work,\n#The amount and substantiality of the portion used, and\n#Effect on the market.\n\nThe purpose and character of the use involve how the original copyrighted work's purpose differs from the meme's purpose, as well as commercial uses of products that use copyrighted material. In [[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]] the court introduced the concept of [[Transformation (law)|transformation]] which goes into the inquiry whether the infringing work altered the original with a new expression, meaning or expression or merely superseded or supplanted the original work. Memes are ''transformative'' in nature as they have no relation to the original work and the motive behind the communication of the meme is personal, in terms of disseminating humour to the public. Such memes being transformative would be covered by fair use.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, copying memes that are made for the sole purpose of being memes would not enjoy this protection as there is no transformation- the copying has the same purpose as original meme which is communicate humorous anecdotes.<ref name=\"barandbench.com\">{{Cite web |url=https://barandbench.com/viewpoint-memes-copyright-got |title=The Viewpoint- Game of Thrones Memes: Potential Copyright Infringement or Fair Use? |last1=Mishra |first1=Meghna |last2=Nigam |first2=Anusuya |website=Bar and Bench|access-date=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPurpose and character of use weighs in against memes which have been used for commercial purposes because then the work has not been created for the communication of humour but for economic gain. For example, [[Grumpy Cat]] won $710,001 in a copyright lawsuit against the beverage company Grenade which used the Grumpy Cat image on its roasted coffee line and t-shirts.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thewrap.com/grumpy-cat-wins-710001-in-copyright-lawsuit-memes-have-rights-too/ |title=Grumpy Cat Wins $710,001 in Copyright Lawsuit: 'Memes Have Rights Too' |last1=Nakamura |first1=Reid |publisher=The Wrap|access-date=May 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422040921/https://www.thewrap.com/grumpy-cat-wins-710001-in-copyright-lawsuit-memes-have-rights-too/|archive-date=April 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe nature of the copyrighted work weighs asks what the differences between the meme and the other material are. This factor applies to many types of memes because the original work is an artistic creation that has been published and thus the latter enjoys protection under copyright which the memes are violating. However, as memes are transformative, this factor does not have a lot of weight.<ref name=\"lawandarts.org\"/>\n\nThe amount and substantiality of the portion used tests not only the quantity of the work copied but the quality that is copied as well.<ref name=\"SCOTUS\">{{Ussc|name=Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises|471|539|1985}}. {{Usgovpd}}</ref> [[Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises]] clarified this position. For cinematograph still, only a small portion of the entire film is copied whereas for rage comics and personal photographs, the entire portion has been used to create the meme. Despite this, all categories of memes would be considered to be falling under fair use because the text that is added to those images adds value, without which it would just be picture.<ref name=\":2\" /> Moreover, the heart of the work is not affected because the still/picture is taken out of context and portrays something entirely different from what the image originally wanted to depict.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=M.

The analysis requires three steps: the amount and substantiality of dealing, the purpose of copying, and the effect on potential markets.\n\nThe amount of sustainability of dealing asks about how much of the original work is used in the meme, or how the meme transforms the original content. A meme makes use to existing copyright work whether it is a cinematograph still, rage comic, personal photograph or a meme made for the purpose of being a meme. However, since a meme is made for comedic purposes, taken out of context of the original work, they are transforming the work and creating a new work.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe purpose of copying factors in the purpose of the meme compared to the purpose of the original work. Under Section 52(1)(a)<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/1367?view_type=browse#collapse14572 |title=The Copyright Act, 1957}}</ref> the purpose is restricted to criticism or review. A meme, as long as it is a parody or a criticism of the original work would be protected under the exception but once an element of commercialization comes in, they would no longer be exempted and because the purpose no longer falls under the those mentioned in the section .<ref name=\":1\" /> When the Indian comedic group, [[All India Bakchod]] (AIB) parodied [[Game of Thrones]] through a series of memes, the primary purpose was to advertise products of companies that have endorsed the group and it would not be fair dealing.<ref name=\"barandbench.com\"/>\n\nMemes generally do not have an effect on the potential market for a work.

Traditionally, a prominent form of such memes consisted of [[image macros]] paired with a concept or catchphrase. In some cases, these memes used words and phrases contain intentional misspellings (such as [[lolcat]]s) or incorrect grammar (such as [[Doge (meme)|doge]] and \"[[All your base are belong to us]]\"). However, in more recent times, memes have evolved from simple image macros with text to more elaborate forms such as challenges, [[GIF]]s and [[Viral phenomenon|viral sensations]]. These small movements tend to spread from person to person via [[social network]]s, [[blog]]s, direct [[email]], or news sources. They may relate to various existing [[Internet culture]]s or [[subculture]]s, often created or spread on various websites. Fads and sensations tend to grow rapidly on the Internet, because the instant communication facilitates [[word of mouth]] transmission. Examples of such fads include posting a photo of people lying down in public places (called \"[[planking (fad)|planking]]\") and uploading a short video of people doing the [[Harlem Shake (meme)|Harlem Shake]]. \u201cDank\u201d memes have emerged as a new form of image-macros, defined by the inclusion of more surreal and nonsensical themes. \n\nThe word ''meme'' was coined by [[Richard Dawkins]] in his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' as an attempt to explain how ideas replicate, mutate and evolve ([[memetics]]).<ref name=\"cream\">{{Citation |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Selfish Gene |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1989 |edition=2 |isbn=978-0-19-286092-7 |page=192 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkHO9HI7koEC&pg=PA192 |quote=We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of ''imitation''.

[[Internet forum|Messageboards]] and [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroups]] were also popular because they allowed a simple method for people to share information or memes with a diverse population of Internet users in a short period. They encourage communication between people, and thus between meme sets, that do not normally come in contact. Furthermore, they actively promote meme-sharing within the messageboard or newsgroup population by asking for feedback, comments, opinions, etc. This format is what gave rise to early Internet memes, like the [[The Hampsterdance Song|Hampster Dance]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Another factor in the increased meme transmission observed over the Internet is its interactive nature. [[Publishing|Print]] matter, [[radio]], and [[television]] are all essentially passive experiences requiring the reader, listener, or viewer to perform all necessary cognitive processing; in contrast, the social nature of the Internet allows phenomena to propagate more readily. Many phenomena are also spread via [[web search engine]]s, [[Internet forum]]s, [[social networking service]]s, [[Social news website|social news]] sites, and [[video hosting service]]s. Much of the Internet's ability to spread information is assisted from results found through search engines, which can allow users to find memes even with obscure information.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Memes On the Internet |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C004367/ce7.shtml |publisher=[[Oracle Thinkquest]] |access-date=November 30, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511193449/http://library.thinkquest.org/C004367/ce7.shtml |archivedate=May 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Marshall |first=Garry |title=The Internet and Memetics |url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Conf/MemePap/Marshall.html |publisher=School of Computing Science, [[Middlesex University]]|access-date=November 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119134239/http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Conf/MemePap/Marshall.html|archive-date=January 19, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Evolution and propagation ==\n[[File:Typical internet meme image format.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Typical format for image macros.]]\nInternet memes grew as a concept in the mid-1990s. At the time, memes were just short clips that were shared between people in [[Usenet]] forums. As the Internet evolved, so did memes. When [[YouTube]] was released in 2005, video memes became popular. Around this time, [[rickrolling]] became popular and the link to this video was sent around via email or other messaging sites. Video sharing also created memes such as \"[[Turn Down For What]]\" and the \"[[Harlem Shake (meme)|Harlem Shake]]\". As social media websites such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] started appearing, it was now easy to share [[GIF]]s and [[image macro]]s to a large audience. Meme generator websites were created to let users create their own memes out of existing templates. Memes during this time could remain popular for a long time, from a few months to a decade, which contrasts with the fast lifespan of modern memes.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/story/guide-memes/ |title=The WIRED Guide to Memes |journal=WIRED|access-date=November 30, 2018 |first1=Angela |last1=Watercutter |first2=Emma |last2=Grey Ellisby |date=April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190201164321/https://www.wired.com/story/guide-memes/|archive-date=February 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAn Internet meme may stay the same or may evolve over time, by chance or through commentary, imitations, [[parody]], or by incorporating news accounts about itself. Internet memes can evolve and spread extremely rapidly, sometimes reaching worldwide popularity within a few days.

The section provides that if a copyrighted work is reproduced for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research, it would not amount to infringement. Notably for memes, the use of the term ''\"such as\"'' in the section denotes that the list is not exhaustive but merely illustrative. Furthermore, the factors mentioned in the section are subjective in nature and the weight of each factor varies on a case to case basis.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal |last1=Patel |first1=Ronak |title=First World Problems:' A Fair Use Analysis of Internet Memes |url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt96h003jt/qt96h003jt.pdf?t=nndf5x&v=lg |journal=UCLA Entertainment Law Review |volume=20 |issue=2}}</ref> All the factors have to be weighed together and an overall assessment is made whether the infringing work would qualify as fair use.\n\nThe four factors are:\n#The purpose or character of use,\n#The nature of the copyrighted work,\n#The amount and substantiality of the portion used, and\n#Effect on the market.\n\nThe purpose and character of the use involve how the original copyrighted work's purpose differs from the meme's purpose, as well as commercial uses of products that use copyrighted material. In [[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]] the court introduced the concept of [[Transformation (law)|transformation]] which goes into the inquiry whether the infringing work altered the original with a new expression, meaning or expression or merely superseded or supplanted the original work. Memes are ''transformative'' in nature as they have no relation to the original work and the motive behind the communication of the meme is personal, in terms of disseminating humour to the public. Such memes being transformative would be covered by fair use.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, copying memes that are made for the sole purpose of being memes would not enjoy this protection as there is no transformation- the copying has the same purpose as original meme which is communicate humorous anecdotes.<ref name=\"barandbench.com\">{{Cite web |url=https://barandbench.com/viewpoint-memes-copyright-got |title=The Viewpoint- Game of Thrones Memes: Potential Copyright Infringement or Fair Use? |last1=Mishra |first1=Meghna |last2=Nigam |first2=Anusuya |website=Bar and Bench|access-date=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPurpose and character of use weighs in against memes which have been used for commercial purposes because then the work has not been created for the communication of humour but for economic gain. For example, [[Grumpy Cat]] won $710,001 in a copyright lawsuit against the beverage company Grenade which used the Grumpy Cat image on its roasted coffee line and t-shirts.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thewrap.com/grumpy-cat-wins-710001-in-copyright-lawsuit-memes-have-rights-too/ |title=Grumpy Cat Wins $710,001 in Copyright Lawsuit: 'Memes Have Rights Too' |last1=Nakamura |first1=Reid |publisher=The Wrap|access-date=May 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422040921/https://www.thewrap.com/grumpy-cat-wins-710001-in-copyright-lawsuit-memes-have-rights-too/|archive-date=April 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe nature of the copyrighted work weighs asks what the differences between the meme and the other material are. This factor applies to many types of memes because the original work is an artistic creation that has been published and thus the latter enjoys protection under copyright which the memes are violating. However, as memes are transformative, this factor does not have a lot of weight.<ref name=\"lawandarts.org\"/>\n\nThe amount and substantiality of the portion used tests not only the quantity of the work copied but the quality that is copied as well.<ref name=\"SCOTUS\">{{Ussc|name=Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises|471|539|1985}}. {{Usgovpd}}</ref> [[Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises]] clarified this position. For cinematograph still, only a small portion of the entire film is copied whereas for rage comics and personal photographs, the entire portion has been used to create the meme. Despite this, all categories of memes would be considered to be falling under fair use because the text that is added to those images adds value, without which it would just be picture.<ref name=\":2\" /> Moreover, the heart of the work is not affected because the still/picture is taken out of context and portrays something entirely different from what the image originally wanted to depict.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=M.

The analysis requires three steps: the amount and substantiality of dealing, the purpose of copying, and the effect on potential markets.\n\nThe amount of sustainability of dealing asks about how much of the original work is used in the meme, or how the meme transforms the original content. A meme makes use to existing copyright work whether it is a cinematograph still, rage comic, personal photograph or a meme made for the purpose of being a meme. However, since a meme is made for comedic purposes, taken out of context of the original work, they are transforming the work and creating a new work.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe purpose of copying factors in the purpose of the meme compared to the purpose of the original work. Under Section 52(1)(a)<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/1367?view_type=browse#collapse14572 |title=The Copyright Act, 1957}}</ref> the purpose is restricted to criticism or review. A meme, as long as it is a parody or a criticism of the original work would be protected under the exception but once an element of commercialization comes in, they would no longer be exempted and because the purpose no longer falls under the those mentioned in the section .<ref name=\":1\" /> When the Indian comedic group, [[All India Bakchod]] (AIB) parodied [[Game of Thrones]] through a series of memes, the primary purpose was to advertise products of companies that have endorsed the group and it would not be fair dealing.<ref name=\"barandbench.com\"/>\n\nMemes generally do not have an effect on the potential market for a work.
