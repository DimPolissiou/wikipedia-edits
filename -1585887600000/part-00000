Inspired by several [[high fantasy]] [[Historical fantasy#Medieval fantasy|medieval]]-themed beat 'em up [[arcade game]]s from [[Capcom]] and [[Sega]], ''Legend'' was conceived as an idea by Perconti and Belaidouni to create their own action-oriented project.<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/>\n\n''Legend'' garnered mixed reception from critics since its initial release on the Super Nintendo. While the graphics received unanimous praise, many of the reviewers felt divided in regards to the sound department and gameplay, which was deemed by some as repetitive. Although it never received a direct sequel, Toka later created a [[Video game remake|remake]] of the game for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] which was also called ''[[Legend (1998 video game)|Legend]]''. In [[2015 in video gaming|2015]], the original game was ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] by independent developer and publisher [[Piko Interactive]]. A [[spiritual successor]], ''Konan'', was also in development and planned for the [[Atari Jaguar]] by both Perconti and Belaidouni but was never finished and released.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:SNES Legend.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot.]]\n''Legend'' is an arcade-style side-scrolling hack and slash beat 'em up game similar to ''[[Golden Axe (video game)|Golden Axe]]'' and ''[[The King of Dragons]]'' where players take control of Kaor and Igor through seven stages in total of varying thematic set in the kingdom of Sellech and battling against an assortment of enemies along the journey, with the main objective being defeating the corrupt son of the land's king, Clovis, before he manages to break free the sealed remnant of Beldor's powers and conquers Sellech.<ref name=\"EGM51\">{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_51/page/n125|title=Fact-Files - Super NES - Legend|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=51|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=October 1993|pages=124-125}}</ref><ref name=\"GP35\">{{cite magazine|last=Lundrigan|first=Jeff|url=https://archive.org/details/Game_Players_Issue_35_December_1993/page/n75|title=Features - Legend|magazine=[[Game Players]]|issue=35|publisher=Signal Research|date=December 1993|pages=72-74}}</ref> The characters have several fighting abilities in their disposal to counterattack such as their swords, kicks and [[Incantation|magic spell]]s.<ref name=\"GP35\"/> Players can also block incoming enemy attacks by using their shields.<ref name=\"GP35\"/> There are also special techniques that can be performed by pressing a combination of buttons such as a jump slash, among others at the cost of health. Defeating certain enemies also drops items that can be picked up such as food, magic bags and extra lives.<ref name=\"GP35\"/> After completing a level, players would be sent to a bonus round where items can be collected for points or picked up for later use in the game.<ref name=\"GP35\"/> Although there are seven stages, one of them can only be accessed if the players are captured by the enemies and imprisoned in a dungeon during a boss fight. In the options menu, players can customize the color of their clothing as well as the ability to change the default difficulty setting or share lives between each other during co-op play.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe story of the game is that the maleficent despot Beldor reigned over the kingdom of Sellech for 1000 years, bringing chaos and destruction to the land. Many knights went on a crusade to overthrow Beldor but none of them ever returned. United, people built energized heroes, managing to seal the soul of Beldor and peace was brought to the land afterwards. Clovis, the corrupt son of the king of Sellech, now seeks to harness the power of Beldor and conquer the kingdom by doing so.<ref name=\"GP35\"/> As such, players assume the role of knight warriors Kaor and Igor in order to defeat Clovis. After travelling across the land, meeting townsfolks who aid them in their quest, while battling against enemies and creatures, both Kaor and Igor reach the [[sanctuary]] where Clovis resides and after finally defeating him, Beldor's soul is vanished from the land and their glorious victory is widespread all over the world.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:SNES-Mod1-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|''Legend'' for the SNES was created under tight conditions in a short development time.]]\nCarlo Perconti worked for several companies such as [[Loriciels]] and [[Titus Interactive]] as a [[freelance]] graphic designer, while Lyes Belaidouni worked under the same area in the latter, who were mainly developing [[racing game]]s for [[Amstrad]] [[home computer]]s and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> Belaidouni preferred action-oriented titles but due to the then-current direction of productions under Titus, who also were not interested in developing for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System outside of publishing with the exception of ''[[Prehistorik Man]]'', he resigned along with Perconti and marketing manager Gabriel Guary to establish their own [[game development company]] called Arcade Zone to create titles for home consoles.<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> Their first idea was to create a game under the beat 'em up genre, which was not widely developed in North American and Europe in the 1990s, and were inspired by several arcade games from Capcom and Sega such as ''[[Knights of the Round (video game)|Knights of the Round]]'', ''Golden Axe'' and ''The King of Dragons'', with Perconti later stating that \"we made the game we wanted to play.\"<ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/>\n\nThe two co-founders were the sole authors of ''Legend'' which was developed as a passion project under turbulent conditions on a quick pace between two and three months, becoming the company's first project, with Perconti serving as its programmer.<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> The game was created from scratch as the team had no financial backing, no access to a software library, nor an official [[Nintendo]] development kit for the Super Nintendo, while Guary was in charge of the business side of the company.<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> Belaidouni made all the artwork for backgrounds and characters in ''[[Deluxe Paint]]'' on [[Amiga]] before being transferred to [[Personal computer|PC]] for Perconti, who handled hardware coordination and other tasks.<ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> After finishing development, the game was first showcased at [[Consumer Electronics Show]], where Capcom was also exhibiting the Super NES conversion of ''The King of Dragons''.<ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/><ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/details/Gamefan_Vol_1_Issue_09/page/n105|title=Summer CES '93|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=1|issue=9|publisher=DieHard Gamers Club|date=August 1993|pages=95-108}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_50/page/n101|title=Next Wave - Seika - Legend|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=50|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=September 1993|page=102}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''Legend'' was first released in North America on April 1994 by Seika Corporation and later in Europe by Sony Electronic Publishing on December 24 of the same year.

Inspired by several [[high fantasy]] [[Historical fantasy#Medieval fantasy|medieval]]-themed beat 'em up [[arcade game]]s from [[Capcom]] and [[Sega]], ''Legend'' was conceived as an idea by Perconti and Belaidouni to create their own action-oriented project.<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/>\n\n''Legend'' garnered mixed reception from critics since its initial release on the Super Nintendo. While the graphics received unanimous praise, many of the reviewers felt divided in regards to the sound department and gameplay, which was deemed by some as repetitive. Although it never received a direct sequel, Toka later created a [[Video game remake|remake]] of the game for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] which was also called ''[[Legend (1998 video game)|Legend]]''. In [[2015 in video gaming|2015]], the original game was ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] by independent developer and publisher [[Piko Interactive]]. A [[spiritual successor]], ''Konan'', was also in development and planned for the [[Atari Jaguar]] by both Perconti and Belaidouni but was never finished and released.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:SNES Legend.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot.]]\n''Legend'' is an arcade-style side-scrolling hack and slash beat 'em up game similar to ''[[Golden Axe (video game)|Golden Axe]]'' and ''[[The King of Dragons]]'' where players take control of Kaor and Igor through seven stages in total of varying thematic set in the kingdom of Sellech and battling against an assortment of enemies along the journey, with the main objective being defeating the corrupt son of the land's king, Clovis, before he manages to break free the sealed remnant of Beldor's powers and conquers Sellech.<ref name=\"EGM51\">{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_51/page/n125|title=Fact-Files - Super NES - Legend|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=51|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=October 1993|pages=124-125}}</ref><ref name=\"GP35\">{{cite magazine|last=Lundrigan|first=Jeff|url=https://archive.org/details/Game_Players_Issue_35_December_1993/page/n75|title=Features - Legend|magazine=[[Game Players]]|issue=35|publisher=Signal Research|date=December 1993|pages=72-74}}</ref> The characters have several fighting abilities in their disposal to counterattack such as their swords, kicks and [[Incantation|magic spell]]s.<ref name=\"GP35\"/> Players can also block incoming enemy attacks by using their shields.<ref name=\"GP35\"/> There are also special techniques that can be performed by pressing a combination of buttons such as a jump slash, among others at the cost of health. Defeating certain enemies also drops items that can be picked up such as food, magic bags and extra lives.<ref name=\"GP35\"/> After completing a level, players would be sent to a bonus round where items can be collected for points or picked up for later use in the game.<ref name=\"GP35\"/> Although there are seven stages, one of them can only be accessed if the players are captured by the enemies and imprisoned in a dungeon during a boss fight. In the options menu, players can customize the color of their clothing as well as the ability to change the default difficulty setting or share lives between each other during co-op play.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe story of the game is that the maleficent despot Beldor reigned over the kingdom of Sellech for 1000 years, bringing chaos and destruction to the land. Many knights went on a crusade to overthrow Beldor but none of them ever returned. United, people built energized heroes, managing to seal the soul of Beldor and peace was brought to the land afterwards. Clovis, the corrupt son of the king of Sellech, now seeks to harness the power of Beldor and conquer the kingdom by doing so.<ref name=\"GP35\"/> As such, players assume the role of knight warriors Kaor and Igor in order to defeat Clovis. After travelling across the land, meeting townsfolks who aid them in their quest, while battling against enemies and creatures, both Kaor and Igor reach the [[sanctuary]] where Clovis resides and after finally defeating him, Beldor's soul is vanished from the land and their glorious victory is widespread all over the world.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:SNES-Mod1-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|''Legend'' for the SNES was created under tight conditions in a short development time.]]\nCarlo Perconti worked for several companies such as [[Loriciels]] and [[Titus Interactive]] as a [[freelance]] graphic designer, while Lyes Belaidouni worked under the same area in the latter, who were mainly developing [[racing game]]s for [[Amstrad]] [[home computer]]s and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> Belaidouni preferred action-oriented titles but due to the then-current direction of productions under Titus, who also were not interested in developing for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System outside of publishing with the exception of ''[[Prehistorik Man]]'', he resigned along with Perconti and marketing manager Gabriel Guary to establish their own [[game development company]] called Arcade Zone to create titles for home consoles.<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> Their first idea was to create a game under the beat 'em up genre, which was not widely developed in North American and Europe in the 1990s, and were inspired by several arcade games from Capcom and Sega such as ''[[Knights of the Round (video game)|Knights of the Round]]'', ''Golden Axe'' and ''The King of Dragons'', with Perconti later stating that \"we made the game we wanted to play.\"<ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/>\n\nThe two co-founders were the sole authors of ''Legend'' which was developed as a passion project under turbulent conditions on a quick pace between two and three months, becoming the company's first project, with Perconti serving as its programmer.<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> The game was created from scratch as the team had no financial backing, no access to a software library, nor an official [[Nintendo]] development kit for the Super Nintendo, while Guary was in charge of the business side of the company.<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> Belaidouni made all the artwork for backgrounds and characters in ''[[Deluxe Paint]]'' on [[Amiga]] before being transferred to [[Personal computer|PC]] for Perconti, who handled hardware coordination and other tasks.<ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> After finishing development, the game was first showcased at [[Consumer Electronics Show]], where Capcom was also exhibiting the Super NES conversion of ''The King of Dragons''.<ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/><ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/details/Gamefan_Vol_1_Issue_09/page/n105|title=Summer CES '93|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=1|issue=9|publisher=DieHard Gamers Club|date=August 1993|pages=95-108}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_50/page/n101|title=Next Wave - Seika - Legend|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=50|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=September 1993|page=102}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''Legend'' was first released in North America on April 1994 by Seika Corporation and later in Europe by Sony Electronic Publishing on December 24 of the same year.
