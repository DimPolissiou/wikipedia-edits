They are sometimes created in specific styles, shapes, or motifs.\n\nThe named 'cosmetic vessel' in [[Ancient Greece]] is the [[pyxis (vessel)|pyxis]]. In [[Ancient Egypt]] artifacts of hieroglyphically inscribed kohl [[tube (fluid conveyance)|tube]]s are found; also [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] vessels, and kohl spoons, which were formed in stylized shapes relevant to Egyptian ideology, including specific hieroglyphs.\n\nThe use of the ''cosmetic vessel'' may extend to trinket items, car-keys, toiletry accessories, for example, a nail clipper; as a non-toiletry storage container, it becomes an 'all-purpose' decorated, special-use vessel.\n\nContainers are known from many societies, ancient and modern. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s of the Americas made small containers woven from basketry materials, including pine needles.\n\n===Ancient Egypt===\nIn [[Ancient Egypt]] toiletry items began in the [[Predynastic Period]] with ivory cosmetic articles; also bone, stone, or pottery. Ivory combs, and [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] spoons were among the first, with many shapes; common themes for shapes became the [[ankh]] symbol, ducks, lotus flowers, etc. In the time of the Predynastic and [[Old Kingdom]], bowls were also [[hand drill (hieroglyph)|mechanically drill]]ed, including miniature sizes, and were used in life and also included as [[grave goods]]. The bowls were either a type of unguent [[jar]], or a toiletry \"kohl cosmetic vessel\". The desert sun or [[Nile]] floodwaters during inundation produced a need for facial-eye protection, using 'eyepaint' or eyeliner when working in the flooded lands; theoretically, it was also used by males. The creation of predynastic [[cosmetic palette]]s with their eyepaint 'mixing circle', may have been the start of the lineage of the kohl cosmetic [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s.  The famed [[Narmer Palette]], which scholars believe to commemorate the unification of upper and lower Egypt, is believed to be such a cosmetic article, perhaps even for the cosmetics of the king.<ref name=\"AHA-Palette of King Narmer\">{{cite web|title=Palette of King Narmer|url=https://www.historians.org/teaching-and-learning/teaching-resources/teaching-and-learning-in-the-digital-age/world-history/images-of-power-art-as-an-historiographic-tool/palette-of-king-narmer|publisher=American Historical Association|accessdate=17 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe term cosmetic packaging includes primary and secondary packaging. Primary packaging, also called cosmetic containers, is housing the cosmetic product. It is in direct contact with the cosmetic product. Secondary packaging is the outer wrapping of one or several cosmetic containers.

National regulations dictate what products are to be regarded as cosmetics. While ISO 22715 is not legally binding, national regulations regarding cosmetic products can be even stricter than those laid out in ISO 22715. The link between [[International standard|standards]] and [[regulation]]s is that a standard often represents the common denominator of [[national law]], as the [[standardization]] committee consists of members of most countries.<ref name=\"Turner-legally binding\" />\n\n==Standards and regulations==\n\nIn addition to cosmetic containers meeting the requirements of ISO, they must also comply with regulations set by the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]]. Cosmetics products marketed in the EU must comply with the [[Regulation (European Union)|EU-Regulation]] (EC) No. 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on cosmetic products. The entity that puts the product on the market, known as the \"responsible person,\" must prepare a product safety report for the EU. [[Manufacturer]]s must notify the EU Cosmetic Products Notification Portal (CPNP) when they plan on putting products on the market.

In the United States, companies must comply with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Although the [[FDA]] does exercise authority over the cosmetic industry, it does not allocate sufficient resources to constantly monitor the industry. ISO defines an ingredient as a material that makes up the final product and not necessarily raw materials used in the production of the product. While the FDA does not have strict requirements for ingredients, they must still be listed on the primary container or secondary package.<ref name=\"FDA-CosmeticsLaw\">{{cite web|title=Cosmetics & U.S. Law |url=https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/LawsRegulations/ucm2005209.htm|publisher=U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA)|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Cosper:AboutFDA\">{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=What you should know when packaging cosmetics compliant to FDA regulations|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/what-you-should-know-when-packaging-cosmetics-compliant-to-fda-regulations|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=17 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental Aspects==\n{{main article|sustainable packaging}}\nThe materials used for cosmetic containers concern for both protective and durable reasons. Containers must protect the product from environmental elements and should also move in the direction of eco-friendly solutions. In other words, the more the container can be recycled, the better for both the environment and cost-efficiency. Some of the factors that affect container durability include how the product substance responds to usage, chemical composition, and biology. It is essential that the container is able to withstand [[mold]] and [[mildew]], as well as [[contaminant]]s.\n\nThe container should be made of material resistant to hot or cold temperatures. It must also protect the product from ultraviolet rays, which could potentially harm the product. The container also cannot absorb the substances in the product. Traditionally, plastic materials or glass have been used for home cosmetics. Aluminum has become a popular type of container due to its lightweight yet sturdy quality, flexibility, durability, and recyclability. A key factor in what type of material can be used for containers is how compatible the material is with the product.<ref name=\"ASI-Sustainability\">{{cite web|title=Aluminium and Sustainability|url=http://aluminium-stewardship.org/about-asi/aluminium-and-sustainability/|publisher=Aluminium Stewardship Initiative|accessdate=17 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020061711/http://aluminium-stewardship.org/about-asi/aluminium-and-sustainability/|archive-date=20 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nPlastic packaging materials are controversially discussed because of their [[plastic pollution|polluting]] effects in particular to the marine environment.

They are sometimes created in specific styles, shapes, or motifs.\n\nThe named 'cosmetic vessel' in [[Ancient Greece]] is the [[pyxis (vessel)|pyxis]]. In [[Ancient Egypt]] artifacts of hieroglyphically inscribed kohl [[tube (fluid conveyance)|tube]]s are found; also [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] vessels, and kohl spoons, which were formed in stylized shapes relevant to Egyptian ideology, including specific hieroglyphs.\n\nThe use of the ''cosmetic vessel'' may extend to trinket items, car-keys, toiletry accessories, for example a nail clipper; as a non-toiletry storage container, it becomes an 'all-purpose' decorated, special-use vessel.\n\nContainers are known from many societies, ancient and modern. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s of the Americas made small containers woven from basketry materials, including pine needles.\n\n===Ancient Egypt===\nIn [[Ancient Egypt]] toiletry items began in the [[Predynastic Period]] with ivory cosmetic articles; also bone, stone, or pottery. Ivory combs, and [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] spoons were among the first, with many shapes; common themes for shapes became the [[ankh]] symbol, ducks, lotus flowers, etc. In the time of the Predynastic and [[Old Kingdom]], bowls were also [[hand drill (hieroglyph)|mechanically drill]]ed, including miniature sizes, and were used in life and also included as [[grave goods]]. The bowls were either a type of unguent [[jar]], or a toiletry \"kohl cosmetic vessel\". The desert sun or [[Nile]] floodwaters during inundation produced a need for facial-eye protection, using 'eyepaint' or eyeliner, when working in the flooded lands; theoretically it was also used by males. The creation of predynastic [[cosmetic palette]]s with their eyepaint 'mixing circle', may have been the start of the lineage of the kohl cosmetic [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s.  The famed [[Narmer Palette]], which scholars believe to commemorate the unification of upper and lower Egypt, is believed to be such a cosmetic article, perhaps even for the cosmetics of the king.<ref name=\"AHA-Palette of King Narmer\">{{cite web|title=Palette of King Narmer|url=https://www.historians.org/teaching-and-learning/teaching-resources/teaching-and-learning-in-the-digital-age/world-history/images-of-power-art-as-an-historiographic-tool/palette-of-king-narmer|publisher=American Historical Association|accessdate=17 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe term cosmetic packaging includes primary and the secondary packaging.

While the FDA does not have many restrictions on ingredients for cosmetic products, it does require that certain chemicals and colorants be listed.<ref name=\"Cosper-PackagingFDA\"/><ref name=\"FDA-CosmeticsLaw\">{{cite web|title=Cosmetics & U.S. Law |url=https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/LawsRegulations/ucm2005209.htm|publisher=U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA)|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs far as [[EU regulation]]s regarding packaging, manufacturers must be compliant with EC No. 1223/2009. One of these requirements involves the manufacturer issuing a safety report before putting the product on the market. The manufacturer must also disclose any serious undesirable effects (SUE) to the EU. Marketers are required to list nano-materials. \nThe EU's definition of \"ingredients\" does not include raw or technical materials used in production that do not end up in the final product. In some cases when durability is an issue, the manufacturer must list an expiration date after the product has been opened. The words \"best used before\" are common for identifying the product expiration date.<ref name=\"EU-Regulation-On-Cosmetics\">{{cite web|title=REGULATION (EC) No 1223/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  of 30 November 2009  on cosmetic products|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32009R1223|publisher=THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Cosper-Packaging-in-EU\">{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=What you should know when packaging cosmetics compliant to EU regulations|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/what-you-should-know-when-packaging-cosmetics-compliant-to-eu-regulations|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"CosmeticsEuropeRegulation\">{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmetics Regulation|url=https://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/cosmetics-industry/understanding-cosmetics-regulation/|publisher=Cosmetics Europe Association|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==ISO-Standard==\nStandard [[ISO 22715]] provides specifications for the packaging and labeling of all cosmetic products that are sold or distributed at no charge; i.e. free samples. National regulations dictate what products are to be regarded as cosmetics. While ISO 22715 is not legally binding, national regulations regarding cosmetic products can be even stricter than those laid out in ISO 22715. The link between [[International standard|standards]] and [[regulation]]s is that a standard often represents the common denominator of [[national law]], as the [[standardization]] committee consists of members of most countries.<ref name=\"Turner-legally binding\" />\n\n==Standards and regulations==\n\nIn addition to cosmetic containers meeting the requirements of ISO, they must also comply with regulations set by the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]]. Cosmetics products marketed in the EU must comply with the [[Regulation (European Union)|EU-Regulation]] (EC) No. 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on cosmetic products. The entity that puts the product on the market, known as the \"responsible person,\" must prepare a product safety report for the EU. [[Manufacturer]]s must notify the EU Cosmetic Products Notification Portal (CPNP) when they plan on putting products on the market. Some of the main EU requirements include identifying [[colorants]] and [[nanomaterial]]s and disclosing serious undesirable effects (SUE) to the EU.<ref name=\"EU-Regulation-On-Cosmetics\">{{cite web|title=REGULATION (EC) No 1223/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  of 30 November 2009  on cosmetic products|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32009R1223|publisher=THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Cosper-Packaging-in-EU\">{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=What you should know when packaging cosmetics compliant to EU regulations|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/what-you-should-know-when-packaging-cosmetics-compliant-to-eu-regulations|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"CosmeticsEuropeRegulation\">{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmetics Regulation|url=https://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/cosmetics-industry/understanding-cosmetics-regulation/|publisher=Cosmetics Europe Association|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe main issues to remember about labels on cosmetic containers is that they provide safety guidance, including instructions for use and proper disposal. In the United States, companies must comply with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Although the [[FDA]] does exercise authority over the cosmetic industry, it does not allocate sufficient resources to constantly monitor the industry. ISO defines an ingredient as a material that makes up the final product and not necessarily raw materials used in the production of the product. While the FDA does not have strict requirements for ingredients, they must still be listed on the primary container or secondary package.<ref name=\"FDA-CosmeticsLaw\">{{cite web|title=Cosmetics & U.S. Law |url=https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/LawsRegulations/ucm2005209.htm|publisher=U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA)|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Cosper:AboutFDA\">{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=What you should know when packaging cosmetics compliant to FDA regulations|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/what-you-should-know-when-packaging-cosmetics-compliant-to-fda-regulations|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=17 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental Aspects==\n{{main article|sustainable packaging}}\nThe materials used for cosmetic containers are of concern for both protective and sustainable reasons. The container must protect the product from environmental elements and it must also move in the direction of eco-friendly solutions. In other words, the more the container can be recycled, the better for both the environment and cost efficiency. Some of the factors that affect container durability include how the product substance responds to usage, chemical composition and biology. It is essential that the container is able to withstand [[mold]] and [[mildew]], as well as [[contaminant]]s.\n\nThe container must be made of materials resistant to hot or cold temperatures. It must also protect the product from ultraviolet rays, which can potentially damage the product. The container also cannot absorb product substances. Traditionally, plastic material or glass have been used to house cosmetics. Aluminum has become a popular type of container due to its lightweight yet sturdy quality, flexibility, durability and recyclability. A key factor in what type of material can be used for containers is how compatible the material is with the product.<ref name=\"ASI-Sustainability\">{{cite web|title=Aluminium and Sustainability|url=http://aluminium-stewardship.org/about-asi/aluminium-and-sustainability/|publisher=Aluminium Stewardship Initiative|accessdate=17 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020061711/http://aluminium-stewardship.org/about-asi/aluminium-and-sustainability/|archive-date=20 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nPlastic packaging materials are controversially discussed because of their [[plastic pollution|polluting]] effects in particular to the marine environment.

In response, Augusto Blasi proposed his self-model{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} that links ideas of moral judgment and action through moral commitment.

With the research they reviewed and their own extension of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]], they conclude that value-attitude-behavior depends on the individual and their moral reasoning. They also pointed out that there are such things as good values and bad values. Good values are those that guide our attitudes and behaviors and allow us to express and define ourselves. It also involves the ability to know when values are appropriate in response to the situation or person that you are dealing with. Bad values on the other hand are those that are relied on so much that it makes you unresponsive to the needs and perspectives of others.\n\nAnother issue that Kristiansen and Hotte discovered through their research was that individuals tended to \"create\" values to justify their reactions to certain situations, which they called the \"value justification hypothesis\".<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d /> The authors use an example from feminist [[Susan Faludi]]'s journal entry of how during the period when women were fighting for their right to vote, a New Rights group appealed to society's ideals of \"traditional family values\" as an argument against the new law in order to mask their own \"anger at women's rising independence.\" Their theory is comparable to Jonathan Haidt's [[Social intuitionism|social intuition theory]], where individuals justify their intuitive emotions and actions through reasoning in a post-hoc fashion.\n\nKristiansen and Hotte also found that independent selves had actions and behaviors that are influenced by their own thoughts and feelings, but [[Interdependent]] selves have actions, behaviors and self-concepts that were based on the thoughts and feelings of others. Westerners have two dimensions of emotions, activation and pleasantness. The Japanese have one more, the range of their interdependent relationships. Markus and Kitayama found that these two different types of values had different motives. Westerners, in their explanations, show self-bettering biases. Easterners, on the other hand, tend to focus on \"other-oriented\" biases.<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d />\n\nPsychologist [[Shalom H. Schwartz|S. H. Schwartz]] defines individual values as \"conceptions of the desirable that guide the way social actors (e.g.organisational leaders, policymakers, individual persons) select actions, evaluate people an events, and explain their actions and evaluations.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=S.

While individual values vary case by case (a result of unique life experience), the average of these values point to widely held cultural beliefs (a result of shared cultural values).\n\n===Moral virtues===\nPiaget and Kohlberg both developed stages of development to understand the timing and meaning of moral decisions. They were interested in placing people into moral categories or stages of development instead of identifying how each individual's views and behaviors are affected by their background and personality. In 2004, D. Lapsley and D. Narvaez outlined how [[social cognition]] explains aspects of moral functioning.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Development, Self, and Identity|last1=Lapsley|first1=Daniel K.|last2=Narvaez|first2=Darcia|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-135-63233-5|location=|pages=189\u2013212|chapter=A social-cognitive approach to the moral personality|ref=harv|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=q054AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189}}</ref> The social cognitive approach to personality has six critical resources of moral personality: cognition, self-processes, affective elements of personality, changing social context, lawful situational variability, and the integration of other literature. Lapsley and Narvaez suggest that moral values and actions stem from more than our virtues and are controlled by a set of self-created [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] (cognitive structures that organize related concepts and integrate past events). They claim that schemas are \"fundamental to our very ability to notice dilemmas as we appraise the moral landscape\" and that over time, people develop greater \"moral expertise\".{{Sfn|Lapsley|Narvaez|2004|p=197}}\n\n==== Triune ethics theory ====\n{{Main|Triune ethics Meta-theory}}\nThe triune ethics meta-theory (TEM) has been proposed by Darcia Narvaez as a [[metatheory]] that highlights the relative contributions to moral development of [[biological inheritance]] (including human evolutionary [[adaptations]]), environmental influences on neurobiology, and the role of culture.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal|last=Narvaez|first=Darcia|date=March 1, 2008|title=Triune ethics: The neurobiological roots of our multiple moralities|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~dnarvaez/TriuneEthicsWord.htm|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|volume=26|issue=1|pages=95\u2013119|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2007.07.008|issn=0732-118X|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.152.4926}}</ref> TET proposes three basic mindsets that shape ethical behavior: self-protectionism (a variety of types), engagement, and imagination (a variety of types that are fueld by protectionism or engagement).

According to this approach, through early interactions with the caregiver, the child acquires an internal representation of a system of rules that determine how right/wrong judgments are to be construed, used, and understood.

The \"cooler\" levels of values, reasoning, and willpower, while still important, are proposed to be secondary to the more affect-intensive processes.\n\nMoral behavior is also studied under the umbrella of [[personality psychology]] where it is described in terms of traits such as [[agreeableness]], [[cooperativeness]] and [[Honesty-humility factor of the HEXACO model of personality|honesty/humility]].<ref name=\"Thielmann2020\">{{cite journal |last1=Thielmann |first1=Isabel |last2=Spadaro |first2=Giuliana |last3=Balliet |first3=Daniel |title=Personality and prosocial behavior: A theoretical framework and meta-analysis. |journal=Psychological Bulletin |date=January 2020 |volume=146 |issue=1 |pages=30\u201390 |doi=10.1037/bul0000217}}</ref>\n\n====Value-behavior consistency====\n{{Also|Moral disengagement}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nIn looking at the relations between moral values, attitudes, and behaviors, previous research asserts that there is no dependable correlation between these three aspects, differing from what we would assume. In fact, it seems to be more common for people to label their behaviors with a justifying value rather than having a value beforehand and then acting on it. There are some people that are more likely to act on their personal values: those low in self-monitoring and high in self-consciousness, due to the fact that they are more aware of themselves and less aware of how others may perceive them. Self-consciousness here means being literally more conscious of yourself, not fearing judgement or feeling anxiety from others. Social situations and the different categories of norms can be telling of when people may act in accordance with their values, but this still isn't concrete either. People will typically act in accordance with social, contextual and personal norms, and there is a likelihood that these norms can also follow one's moral values. Though there are certain assumptions and situations that would suggest a major value-attitude-behavior relation, there is not enough research to confirm this phenomenon.\n\n====Moral willpower====\n{{Main|Ego depletion|Self-control}}\n{{See also|Delayed gratification|Social cognitive theory of morality}}\nBuilding on earlier work by Metcalfe and [[Walter Mischel#Self-control|Mischel]] on delayed gratification,<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=Metcalfe|first1=J.|last2=Mischel|first2=W.|year=1999|title=A hot/cool-system analysis of delay of gratification: Dynamics of willpower|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13101564|journal=Psychological Review|volume=106|issue=1|pages=3\u201319|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.1.3|pmid=10197361|via=}}</ref> Baumeister, Miller, and Delaney explored the notion of willpower by first defining the self as being made up of three parts: reflexive consciousness, or the person's awareness of their environment and of himself as an individual; interpersonal being, which seeks to mold the self into one that will be accepted by others; and executive function.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite book|title=Judeo-Christian Perspectives on Psychology: Human Nature, Motivation, and Change|last=Baumeister|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59147-161-5|editor-last=Miller|editor-first=William|location=Washington, DC|pages=57\u201372|chapter=Self and volition|ref=harv|editor-last2=Delaney|editor-first2=Harold}}</ref> They stated, \"[T]he self can free its actions from being determined by particular influences, especially those of which it is aware\".{{Sfn|Baumeister|2005|p=68}} The three prevalent theories of willpower describe it as a limited supply of energy, as a cognitive process, and as a skill that is developed over time.

Moral intuitions happen immediately, automatically, and [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]], with reasoning largely serving to generate post-hoc rationalizations to justify one's instinctual reactions.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\">{{cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|date=October 2001|title=The Emotional Dog and Its Rational Tail|url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/reasoning_adler_rips.pdf#page=1036|journal=Psychological Review|volume=108|issue=4|pages=814\u2013834|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.4.814|pmid=11699120|ref=harv|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.620.5536}}</ref> He provides four arguments to doubt causal importance of reason. Firstly, Haidt argues that since there is a [[Dual process theory|dual process system]] in the brain when making automatic evaluations or assessments, this same process must be applicable to moral judgement as well. The second argument, based on research on [[motivated reasoning]], claims that people behave like \"intuitive lawyers\", searching primarily for evidence that will serve motives for social relatedness and attitudinal coherence. Thirdly, Haidt found that people have post hoc reasoning when faced with a moral situation, this a posteriori (after the fact) explanation gives the illusion of objective moral judgement but in reality is subjective to one's gut feeling. Lastly, research has shown that moral emotion has a stronger link to moral action than moral reasoning, citing Damasio's research on the [[somatic marker hypothesis]] and Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\" />\n\nIn 2008, Joshua Greene published a compilation which, in contrast to Haidt's model, suggested that fair moral reasoning does take place. A \"[[Deontological ethics|deontologist]]\" is someone who has rule-based morality that is mainly focused on duties and rights; in contrast, a \"[[Consequentialism|consequentialist]]\" is someone who believes that only the best overall consequences ultimately matter.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Psychology|last=Greene|first=Joshua|publisher=MIT Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-262-69355-4|editor-last=Sinnott-Armstrong|editor-first=Walter|volume=3|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=35\u201380|chapter=The secret joke of Kant\u2019s Soul|oclc=750463100}}</ref> Generally speaking, individuals who answer to moral dilemmas in a consequential manner take longer to respond and show [[Frontal lobe|frontal-lobe]] activity (associated with cognitive processing).

These Five Foundations of Morality and their importance vary throughout each culture and construct virtues based on their emphasized foundation. \nThey challenged individuals to question the legitimacy of their moral world and introduced the five psychological foundations of morality:\n* Harm/care, which starts with the sensitivity to signs of suffering in offspring and develops into a general dislike of seeing suffering in others and the potential to feel compassion in response.\n* Fairness/reciprocity, which is developed when someone observes or engages in reciprocal interactions. This foundation is concerned with virtues related to fairness and justice. \n* Ingroup/loyalty, which constitutes recognizing, trusting, and cooperating with members of one's ingroup as well as being wary of members of other groups.\n* Authority/respect, which is how someone navigates in a [[Hierarchical equations of motion|hierarchal]] ingroups and communities.\n* Purity/sanctity, which stems from the emotion of disgust that guards the body by responding to elicitors that are biologically or culturally linked to disease transmission.\nThe five foundations theory are both a [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] and cultural-psychological theory.

Namely, moral mandates derive their motivational force from their perceived universality, perceived objectivity, and strong ties to emotion.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Peace Psychology|last=Morgan|first=G. S.|last2=Skitka|first2=L. J.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-9644-4|editor=Christie|editor-first=Daniel J.|location=|pages=|chapter=Moral conviction}}</ref> Perceived universality refers to the notion that individuals experience moral mandates as transcending persons and cultures; additionally, they are regarded as matters of fact. Regarding association with emotion, ITMC is consistent with Jonathan Haidt's social intuitionist model in stating that moral judgments are accompanied by discrete moral emotions (i.e., disgust, shame, guilt). Importantly, Skitka maintains that moral mandates are not the same thing as moral values. Whether an issue will be associated with moral conviction varies across persons.\n\nOne of the main lines of IMTC research addresses the behavioral implications of moral mandates. Individuals prefer greater social and physical distance from attitudinally dissimilar others when moral conviction was high. This effect of moral conviction could not be explained by traditional measures of attitude strength, extremity, or centrality. Skitka, Bauman, and Sargis placed participants in either attitudinally heterogeneous or homogenous groups to discuss procedures regarding two morally mandated issues, [[abortion]] and [[capital punishment]]. Those in attitudinally heterogeneous groups demonstrated the least amount of goodwill towards other group members, the least amount of cooperation, and the most tension/defensiveness. Furthermore, individuals discussing a morally mandated issue were less likely to reach a consensus compared to those discussing non-moral issues.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skitka|first=L.

With the research they reviewed and their own extension of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]], they conclude that value-attitude-behavior depends on the individual and their moral reasoning. They also pointed out that there are such things as good values and bad values. Good values are those that guide our attitudes and behaviors and allow us to express and define ourselves. It also involves the ability to know when values are appropriate in response to the situation or person that you are dealing with. Bad values on the other hand are those that are relied on so much that it makes you unresponsive to the needs and perspectives of others.\n\nAnother issue that Kristiansen and Hotte discovered through their research was that individuals tended to \"create\" values to justify their reactions to certain situations, which they called the \"value justification hypothesis\".<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d /> The authors use an example from feminist [[Susan Faludi]]'s journal entry of how during the period when women were fighting for their right to vote, a New Rights group appealed to society's ideals of \"traditional family values\" as an argument against the new law in order to mask their own \"anger at women's rising independence.\" Their theory is comparable to Jonathan Haidt's [[Social intuitionism|social intuition theory]], where individuals justify their intuitive emotions and actions through reasoning in a post-hoc fashion.\n\nKristiansen and Hotte also found that independent selves had actions and behaviors that are influenced by their own thoughts and feelings, but [[Interdependent]] selves have actions, behaviors and self-concepts that were based on the thoughts and feelings of others. Westerners have two dimensions of emotions, activation and pleasantness. The Japanese have one more, the range of their interdependent relationships. Markus and Kitayama found that these two different types of values had different motives. Westerners, in their explanations, show self-bettering biases. Easterners, on the other hand, tend to focus on \"other-oriented\" biases.<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d />\n\nPsychologist [[Shalom H. Schwartz|S. H.

They were interested in placing people into moral categories or stages of development instead of identifying how each individual's views and behaviors are affected by their background and personality. In 2004, D. Lapsley and D. Narvaez outlined how [[social cognition]] explains aspects of moral functioning.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Development, Self, and Identity|last1=Lapsley|first1=Daniel K.|last2=Narvaez|first2=Darcia|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-135-63233-5|location=|pages=189\u2013212|chapter=A social-cognitive approach to the moral personality|ref=harv|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=q054AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189}}</ref> The social cognitive approach to personality has six critical resources of moral personality: cognition, self-processes, affective elements of personality, changing social context, lawful situational variability, and the integration of other literature. Lapsley and Narvaez suggest that moral values and actions stem from more than our virtues and are controlled by a set of self-created [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] (cognitive structures that organize related concepts and integrate past events). They claim that schemas are \"fundamental to our very ability to notice dilemmas as we appraise the moral landscape\" and that over time, people develop greater \"moral expertise\".{{Sfn|Lapsley|Narvaez|2004|p=197}}\n\n==== Triune ethics theory ====\n{{Main|Triune ethics Meta-theory}}\nThe triune ethics meta-theory (TEM) has been proposed by Darcia Narvaez as a [[metatheory]] that highlights the relative contributions to moral development of [[biological inheritance]] (including human evolutionary [[adaptations]]), environmental influences on neurobiology, and the role of culture.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal|last=Narvaez|first=Darcia|date=March 1, 2008|title=Triune ethics: The neurobiological roots of our multiple moralities|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~dnarvaez/TriuneEthicsWord.htm|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|volume=26|issue=1|pages=95\u2013119|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2007.07.008|issn=0732-118X|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.152.4926}}</ref> TET proposes three basic mindsets that shape ethical behavior: self-protectionism (a variety of types), engagement, and imagination (a variety of types that are fueld by protectionism or engagement).

He focused on moral development as one's progression in the capacity to reason about justice. Kohlberg's interview method included hypothetical moral dilemmas or conflicts of interest (most notably, the [[Heinz dilemma]]). He proposed six stages and three levels of development (claiming that \"anyone who interviewed children about dilemmas and who followed them longitudinally in time would come to our six stages and no others).<ref>{{cite book|title=The Psychology of Moral Development: The Nature and Validity of Moral Stages|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1984|isbn=978-0-06-064761-2|series=Essays on Moral Developent|volume=2|location=|pages=195}}</ref> At the Preconventional level, the first two stages included the punishment-and-obedience orientation and the instrumental-relativist orientation.

The justice perspective draws attention to inequality and oppression, while striving for reciprocal rights and equal respect for all. The care perspective draws attention to the ideas of detachment and abandonment, while striving for attention and response to people who need it. Care Orientation is relationally based.

According to this approach, through early interactions with the caregiver, the child acquires an internal representation of a system of rules that determine how right/wrong judgments are to be construed, used, and understood.

In fact, it seems to be more common for people to label their behaviors with a justifying value rather than having a value beforehand and then acting on it. There are some people that are more likely to act on their personal values: those low in self-monitoring and high in self-consciousness, due to the fact that they are more aware of themselves and less aware of how others may perceive them. Self-consciousness here means being literally more conscious of yourself, not fearing judgement or feeling anxiety from others. Social situations and the different categories of norms can be telling of when people may act in accordance with their values, but this still isn't concrete either. People will typically act in accordance with social, contextual and personal norms, and there is a likelihood that these norms can also follow one's moral values. Though there are certain assumptions and situations that would suggest a major value-attitude-behavior relation, there is not enough research to confirm this phenomenon.\n\n====Moral willpower====\n{{Main|Ego depletion|Self-control}}\n{{See also|Delayed gratification|Social cognitive theory of morality}}\nBuilding on earlier work by Metcalfe and [[Walter Mischel#Self-control|Mischel]] on delayed gratification,<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=Metcalfe|first1=J.|last2=Mischel|first2=W.|year=1999|title=A hot/cool-system analysis of delay of gratification: Dynamics of willpower|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13101564|journal=Psychological Review|volume=106|issue=1|pages=3\u201319|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.1.3|pmid=10197361|via=}}</ref> Baumeister, Miller, and Delaney explored the notion of willpower by first defining the self as being made up of three parts: reflexive consciousness, or the person's awareness of their environment and of himself as an individual; interpersonal being, which seeks to mold the self into one that will be accepted by others; and executive function.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite book|title=Judeo-Christian Perspectives on Psychology: Human Nature, Motivation, and Change|last=Baumeister|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59147-161-5|editor-last=Miller|editor-first=William|location=Washington, DC|pages=57\u201372|chapter=Self and volition|ref=harv|editor-last2=Delaney|editor-first2=Harold}}</ref> They stated, \"[T]he self can free its actions from being determined by particular influences, especially those of which it is aware\".{{Sfn|Baumeister|2005|p=68}} The three prevalent theories of willpower describe it as a limited supply of energy, as a cognitive process, and as a skill that is developed over time.

Moral intuitions happen immediately, automatically, and [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]], with reasoning largely serving to generate post-hoc rationalizations to justify one's instinctual reactions.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\">{{cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|date=October 2001|title=The Emotional Dog and Its Rational Tail|url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/reasoning_adler_rips.pdf#page=1036|journal=Psychological Review|volume=108|issue=4|pages=814\u2013834|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.4.814|pmid=11699120|ref=harv|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.620.5536}}</ref> He provides four arguments to doubt causal importance of reason. Firstly, Haidt argues that since there is a [[Dual process theory|dual process system]] in the brain when making automatic evaluations or assessments, this same process must be applicable to moral judgement as well. The second argument, based on research on [[motivated reasoning]], claims that people behave like \"intuitive lawyers\", searching primarily for evidence that will serve motives for social relatedness and attitudinal coherence. Thirdly, Haidt found that people have post hoc reasoning when faced with a moral situation, this a posteriori (after the fact) explanation gives the illusion of objective moral judgement but in reality is subjective to one's gut feeling. Lastly, research has shown that moral emotion has a stronger link to moral action than moral reasoning, citing Damasio's research on the [[somatic marker hypothesis]] and Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\" />\n\nIn 2008, Joshua Greene published a compilation which, in contrast to Haidt's model, suggested that fair moral reasoning does take place.

These Five Foundations of Morality and their importance vary throughout each culture and construct virtues based on their emphasized foundation. \nThey challenged individuals to question the legitimacy of their moral world and introduced the five psychological foundations of morality:\n* Harm/care, which starts with the sensitivity to signs of suffering in offspring and develops into a general dislike of seeing suffering in others and the potential to feel compassion in response.\n* Fairness/reciprocity, which is developed when someone observes or engages in reciprocal interactions. This foundation is concerned with virtues related to fairness and justice. \n* Ingroup/loyalty, which constitutes recognizing, trusting, and cooperating with members of one's ingroup as well as being wary of members of other groups.\n* Authority/respect, which is how someone navigates in a [[Hierarchical equations of motion|hierarchal]] ingroups and communities.\n* Purity/sanctity, which stems from the emotion of disgust that guards the body by responding to elicitors that are biologically or culturally linked to disease transmission.\nThe five foundations theory are both a [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] and cultural-psychological theory. Modern moral psychology concedes that \"morality is about protecting individuals\" and focuses primarily on issues of justice (harm/care and fairness/reciprocity).<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\" />{{rp|page=99}} Their research found that \"justice and related virtues\u2026make up half of the moral world for liberals, while justice-related concerns make up only one fifth of the moral world for conservatives\".<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\" />{{rp|page=99}} Liberals value harm/care and fairness/reciprocity significantly more than the other moralities, while conservatives value all five equally.\n\n===Moral emotions===\n{{Main|Moral emotions}}\n{{See also|Social emotions}}\nMoral emotions are a variety of social emotion that are involved in forming and communicating moral judgments and decisions, and in motivating behavioral responses to one's own and others' moral behavior.<ref name=\"Pizarro2007b\">{{cite book |last1=Pizarro |first1=David A. |editor1-last=Baumeister |editor1-first=Roy F |editor2-last=Vohs |editor2-first=Kathleen D |title=Encyclopedia of Social Psychology |date=2007 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |isbn=9781412956253 |pages=588\u2013589 |chapter=Moral Emotions|doi=10.4135/9781412956253.n350 }}</ref><ref name=\"Haidt, J. 2003 p. 855\">{{cite book|title=Handbook of Affective Sciences|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-512601-3|editor-last=Davidson|editor-first=Richard|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofaffect0000unse/page/855 855]|chapter=The Moral Emotions|ref=harv|editor-last2=Scherer|editor-first2=Klaus|editor-last3=Goldsmith|editor-first3=H.|chapter-url=http://www.gruberpeplab.com/teaching/psych3131_spring2015/documents/4.1_Haidt2003_Moralemotions.pdf|url=https://archive.org/details/handbookofaffect0000unse/page/855}}</ref><ref name=\"Tangney2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Tangney |first1=June Price |last2=Stuewig |first2=Jeff |last3=Mashek |first3=Debra J. |title=Moral Emotions and Moral Behavior |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |date=January 2007 |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=345\u2013372 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145 |pmid=16953797 |pmc=3083636 |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~squartz/Tangney.pdf}}</ref>\nWhile moral reasoning has been the focus of most study of morality dating all the way back to Plato and Aristotle, the emotive side of morality has been looked upon with disdain.<ref name=\"Pizarro2007b\" /> However, in the last 30\u201340 years, there has been a rise in a new front of research: moral emotions as the basis for moral behavior.

Namely, moral mandates derive their motivational force from their perceived universality, perceived objectivity, and strong ties to emotion.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Peace Psychology|last=Morgan|first=G. S.|last2=Skitka|first2=L. J.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-9644-4|editor=Christie|editor-first=Daniel J.|location=|pages=|chapter=Moral conviction}}</ref> Perceived universality refers to the notion that individuals experience moral mandates as transcending persons and cultures; additionally, they are regarded as matters of fact. Regarding association with emotion, ITMC is consistent with Jonathan Haidt's social intuitionist model in stating that moral judgments are accompanied by discrete moral emotions (i.e., disgust, shame, guilt). Importantly, Skitka maintains that moral mandates are not the same thing as moral values. Whether an issue will be associated with moral conviction varies across persons.\n\nOne of the main lines of IMTC research addresses the behavioral implications of moral mandates. Individuals prefer greater social and physical distance from attitudinally dissimilar others when moral conviction was high. This effect of moral conviction could not be explained by traditional measures of attitude strength, extremity, or centrality. Skitka, Bauman, and Sargis placed participants in either attitudinally heterogeneous or homogenous groups to discuss procedures regarding two morally mandated issues, [[abortion]] and [[capital punishment]]. Those in attitudinally heterogeneous groups demonstrated the least amount of goodwill towards other group members, the least amount of cooperation, and the most tension/defensiveness. Furthermore, individuals discussing a morally mandated issue were less likely to reach a consensus compared to those discussing non-moral issues.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skitka|first=L.

He was on a train when he witnessed one of his [[tuberculosis]] patients taking a drink of water from a common dipper and water bucket (a publicly shared way of drinking water) in the car.

By being used only once, these products significantly reduce [[food contamination]] and the spread of diseases.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|date=October 5, 2007|title=US FDA/CFSAN FDA Food Code|url=http://www.foodsafety.gov/~dms/foodcode.html |website=FoodSafety.gov|access-date=March 23, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074554/http://www.foodsafety.gov/~dms/foodcode.html |archivedate=March 27, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]\u2019s [[Food code#United States|Food Code]] authoritatively spells out the [[sanitary]] and health advantages of single-use foodservice packaging in specific situations: \"A food establishment without facilities...for cleaning and sanitizing [[kitchenware]] and [[tableware]] shall provide only single-use kitchenware, single-service articles, and single-use articles for use by food employees and single-service articles for use by consumers.\" The Food Code further states \"in situations in which the reuse of multiuse items could result in foodborne illness to consumers, single-service and single-use articles must be used to ensure safety.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n== Materials ==\n[[File:Insulated paper cup cutaway.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Insulated [[paper cup]] for hot drinks, cut away to show air layer]]\n[[File:Oysterpail.jpg|thumb|Rice in a paperboard [[oyster pail]]]]\n[[Image:Yummp hk lunchbox.jpg|thumb|right|[[Siu mei]] with rice in a [[foam food container]]]]\nDisposable foodservice packaging can be made from a number of materials, each with its own uses and benefits.\n\n=== Aluminum ===\n[[Aluminum]] is used to manufacture foils, wraps, bags, containers, and [[aluminium tray|trays]].\n\n=== Plastics ===\n{{see also|Foam food container}}\nMany disposable foodservice products can be made of [[plastic]] or [[plastic-coated paper]]: [[plastic cup|cups]], plates, bowls, trays, food containers and [[disposable cutlery|cutlery]], for example. Plastics are used because the material is lightweight and holds the temperature of hot/cold food and beverages. Foamed [[polystyrene]] (sometimes referred to as Styrofoam) is in one of the most common types of plastics used for foodservice packaging, in the form of the [[foam food container]]. Non-foamed polystyrene is sometimes also used for utensils or plastic plates. [[Polyethylene]] and other plastics are also used.\n\n[[Plastic wrap]] is sometimes used to cover a tray of food.\n\nMany plastics are marked with the [[Society of the Plastics Industry|SPI]] [[recycling code]]s for identification.\n\n=== Paper and paperboard ===\n[[File:The Giant hamburger, fries and soda - Quick.jpg|thumb|Paperboard clamshell for fast food]]\nDisposable food service products made from [[paper]], [[paperboard]], and [[corrugated fiberboard]]:  including cups, plates, bowls, napkins, carryout bags, trays, [[egg carton]]s, doilies and tray liners. Some paper products are [[coated paper|coated]] - mostly with [[plastic-coated paper|plastic]] - or treated to improve wet strength or grease resistance. Paper and paperboard packaging like pizza trays, French fry trays, Chinese noodle soup boxes, hamburger clamshell trays, etc., are developed by printers utilizing paper-converting equipment such as tray formers.\n\n[[Molded pulp]]  products are made from recycled [[newsprint]] and are formed under heat and pressure into plates, bowls, trays, and cup carriers. Molded pulp is readily recyclable.\n\n=== Wood and Bamboo ===\n[[File:Foodstiks Wood Fork.jpg|thumb|Disposable Wood Fork <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0076/6201/0425/files/FoodstiksForkFood_B07JHC182S_1.jpg?v=1542055956|website=cdn.shopify.com|access-date=2018-12-21}}</ref>]]\nIn recent years, manufacturers have been working on developing more sustainable alternatives to traditional plastic products. Among them are plates and cutlery (mostly birch) made of bamboo and wood. Throughout the entire life cycle of wood products, there can be far fewer environmental repercussions than with traditional plastics, and possibly fewer with bioplastics like PLA, which composts into lactic acid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foodstiks.com/blogs/news/how-sustainable-are-plastic-cutlery-alternatives|title=How sustainable are plastic cutlery alternatives?|website=foodstiks|access-date=2018-12-21}}</ref> Wooden products decompose on average in the matter of a few months. Currently, wood and bamboo products are more costly than traditional plastics and not as widely available, which makes it challenging for some restaurants to switch.\n\n=== Alternative materials ===\nA number of manufacturers are now making disposable foodservice products from a combination of natural [[starch]]es, recycled fibers, water, air, and natural minerals.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Foodservice Packaging Institute, \"Single-Use Foodservice Packaging: A Tutorial\", 2007</ref> These composite products include cups, plates, bowls, cutlery, sandwich wraps, food containers, and trays. Ideally, these products are easily [[biodegradable]] and composted after use.\n\nThe material used to make these kinds of disposable foodservice products is primarily PLA or [[polylactic acid]]. Some products are made from a mixture of PLA and pulp fibers that are molded into disposable foodservice items with heat and pressure. Others are made from a composite or mixture of starch and other materials, such as [[limestone]] and recycled [[fibers]], to give them additional strength.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAreca palm plates are made from dry fallen leaves from the [[Areca catechu]] palm (betel tree). These trees shed the old dried leaves along with their sheath. These sheaths are separated from leaves and sent to the factory. The sheaths are then soaked and washed in clean water to remove the dust and sand particles. The sheaths are hot-pressed and made into areca palm plates, bowls, and food containers. Compared to other disposable items, areca palm products are 100% natural, eco-friendly. No synthetic adhesives or binders used in the manufacturing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crozborder.com/areca-palm-leaf-plates-manufacturing-process/|title=How areca palm products are made?|last=|first=|date=2019-11-05|website=CrozBorder|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>\n[[File:500ml areca palm food container .jpg|thumb]]\n<br />\n\n== Cost ==\nBy reducing the need for equipment and additional labor, disposable foodservice packaging is an economical alternative to multiuse items and eliminates the need for dishwashers and other support equipment (racks, carts, dollies, shelving, bins). It can also save money on water and energy used by dishwashers and can eliminate the need to replace reusables that are broken, damaged, stolen or accidentally discarded.<ref>[http://fpi.org/dms/Main.asp Library<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214001303/http://fpi.org/dms/Main.asp |date=February 14, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== Other Economics ==\n[[Disposable tableware]] was a key part of the business strategy of chain [[fast food]] restaurants in the US. In order for the business model to work, fast food chains, notably [[McDonald's]], had to convince consumers<ref name=\"dontbus\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skoozeme.com/issues/dontbus.html|title=Don't Bus Throw-Away Utensils and Tableware|website=www.skoozeme.com|accessdate=21 May 2019}}</ref> through advertising campaigns to carry their own tableware to waste bins, in order to avoid labor expenses incurred in clearing tables. By establishing a custom in which customers are encouraged to carry disposables, some of the internal costs of the disposable tableware can be offset.\n\n== Environmental concerns ==\n[[File:Coffee-cup-sleeve.jpg|thumb|[[Coffee cup sleeve]] on a coffee cup; sleeve makes it easy to hold hot drinks.]]\n{{see|plastic waste|litter}}\n\n=== Comparison with washable foodservice products ===\nAccording to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], paper and plastic foodservice packaging discarded in the country's [[municipal solid waste]] stream accounted 1.3 percent in 2007 (by weight) of municipal solid waste.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/nonhaz/municipal/index.htm|title=Advancing Sustainable Materials Management: Facts and Figures|first=US|last=EPA,OSWER,ORCR|date=2015-09-22|work=EPA.gov|access-date=4 April 2017}}</ref> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also says that an often-cited [[waste prevention]] measure is the use of washable plates, cups, and napkins instead of the disposable variety.\n\nWhile this will reduce solid waste, it will have other environmental effects, such as increased water and [[Energy|energy use]]. Overall, reusable dishware \u2013 even if only offered to customers for on-site use \u2013 is considered to be the best environmental choice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/sustainabilityatwork/article/507465|title=Disposable Cups, Cutlery and Dishware|work=Resource Guide, Sustainability at work|publisher=City of Portland|date=2014|accessdate=2017-08-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Cost of recycling ===\nCollection costs, the value of scrap material, and increased energy expenditures create an additional economic barrier to recycling foodservice packaging. While recycling foodservice packaging is difficult, recycled materials are being used in some foodservice packaging.\n\n=== Environmental footprint ===\nMany people are working on reducing the [[environmental footprint]] of packaging for food service. Often a [[Life-cycle assessment]] is valuable to determine the effects throughout the entire system. Some actions include:\n* Packaging of incoming food and supplies can work towards the broad [[sustainable packaging]] guidelines offered by many organizations. This includes the recycling of packaging generated within the restaurant.\n* Packaging products used by the restaurant can include specified amounts of recycled content in the products.\n* Many packaging products can be [[compostable]], but care is needed to match the needs of  regional composting facilities. Sometimes products can be certified<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpiworld.org|title=Biodegradable Products Institute - Certified Compostable|author=|date=|work=BPIWorld.org|access-date=4 April 2017}}</ref> to meet international standards such as [[ASTM International]] D6400, ASTM D6868, and EN 13432.<ref>{{Citation\n | last = Dietz\n | first = C\n | title = Compostable Products for Food Services\n | publisher = Eco-Cycle\n | date=February 2013\n | url = http://www.ecocycle.org/files/pdfs/compostable_products_for_food_services.pdf\n }}</ref>\n* Some single-use food packaging is recyclable but [[food contamination]] of products is often a problem for recyclers.<ref>{{cite web |author=Raymond J.

By being used only once, these products significantly reduce [[food contamination]] and the spread of diseases.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|date=October 5, 2007|title=US FDA/CFSAN FDA Food Code|url=http://www.foodsafety.gov/~dms/foodcode.html |website=FoodSafety.gov|access-date=March 23, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074554/http://www.foodsafety.gov/~dms/foodcode.html |archivedate=March 27, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]\u2019s [[Food code#United States|Food Code]] authoritatively spells out the [[sanitary]] and health advantages of single-use foodservice packaging in specific situations: \"A food establishment without facilities...for cleaning and sanitizing [[kitchenware]] and [[tableware]] shall provide only single-use kitchenware, single-service articles, and single-use articles for use by food employees and single-service articles for use by consumers.\" The Food Code further states \"in situations in which the reuse of multiuse items could result in foodborne illness to consumers, single-service and single-use articles must be used to ensure safety.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n== Materials ==\n[[File:Insulated paper cup cutaway.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Insulated [[paper cup]] for hot drinks, cut away to show air layer]]\n[[File:Oysterpail.jpg|thumb|Rice in a paperboard [[oyster pail]]]]\n[[Image:Yummp hk lunchbox.jpg|thumb|right|[[Siu mei]] with rice in a [[foam food container]]]]\nDisposable foodservice packaging can be made from a number of materials, each with its own uses and benefits.\n\n=== Aluminum ===\n[[Aluminum]] is used to manufacture foils, wraps, bags, containers, and [[aluminium tray|trays]].\n\n=== Plastics ===\n{{see also|Foam food container}}\nMany disposable foodservice products can be made of [[plastic]] or [[plastic-coated paper]]: [[plastic cup|cups]], plates, bowls, trays, food containers and [[disposable cutlery|cutlery]], for example. Plastics are used because the material is lightweight and holds the temperature of hot/cold food and beverages. Foamed [[polystyrene]] (sometimes referred to as Styrofoam) is in one of the most common types of plastics used for foodservice packaging, in the form of the [[foam food container]]. Non-foamed polystyrene is sometimes also used for utensils or plastic plates. [[Polyethylene]] and other plastics are also used.\n\n[[Plastic wrap]] is sometimes used to cover a tray of food.\n\nMany plastics are marked with the [[Society of the Plastics Industry|SPI]] [[recycling code]]s for identification.\n\n=== Paper and paperboard ===\n[[File:The Giant hamburger, fries and soda - Quick.jpg|thumb|Paperboard clamshell for fast food]]\nDisposable foodservice products made from [[paper]], [[paperboard]], and [[corrugated fiberboard]]:  including cups, plates, bowls, napkins, carryout bags, trays, [[egg carton]]s, doilies and tray liners. Some paper products are [[coated paper|coated]] - mostly with [[plastic-coated paper|plastic]] - or treated to improve wet strength or grease resistance. Paper and paperboard packaging like pizza trays, French fry trays, Chinese noodle soup boxes, hamburger clamshell trays, etc., are developed by printers utilizing paper-converting equipment such as tray formers.\n\n[[Molded pulp]]  products are made from recycled [[newsprint]] and are formed under heat and pressure into plates, bowls, trays and cup carriers. Molded pulp is readily recyclable.\n\n=== Wood and Bamboo ===\n[[File:Foodstiks Wood Fork.jpg|thumb|Disposable Wood Fork <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0076/6201/0425/files/FoodstiksForkFood_B07JHC182S_1.jpg?v=1542055956|website=cdn.shopify.com|access-date=2018-12-21}}</ref>]]\nIn recent years, manufacturers have been working on developing more sustainable alternatives to traditional plastic products. Amongst them are plates and cutlery made from bamboo and wood (mostly birch). Throughout the entire life cycle of wood products, there can be far fewer environmental repercussions than with traditional plastics, and possibly fewer with bioplastics like PLA, which composts into lactic acid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foodstiks.com/blogs/news/how-sustainable-are-plastic-cutlery-alternatives|title=How sustainable are plastic cutlery alternatives?|website=foodstiks|access-date=2018-12-21}}</ref> Wooden  products decompose on average in the matter of a few months. Currently wood and bamboo products are more costly than traditional plastics and not as widely available, which makes it challenging for some restaurants to switch.\n\n=== Alternative materials ===\nA number of manufacturers are now making disposable foodservice products from a combination of natural [[starch]]es, recycled fibers, water, air, and natural minerals.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Foodservice Packaging Institute, \"Single-Use Foodservice Packaging: A Tutorial\", 2007</ref> These composite products include cups, plates, bowls, cutlery, sandwich wraps, food containers and trays. Ideally these products are easily [[biodegradable]] and composted after use.\n\nThe material used to make these kinds of disposable foodservice products is primarily PLA or [[polylactic acid]]. Some products are made from a mixture of PLA and pulp fibers that are molded into disposable foodservice items with heat and pressure. Others are made from a composite or mixture of starch and other materials, such as [[limestone]] and recycled [[fibers]], to give them additional strength.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAreca palm plates are made from dry fallen leaves from the [[Areca catechu]] palm (betel tree). This trees shed the old dried leaves along with their sheath. These sheaths are separated from leaves and sent to the factory. The sheaths are then soaked and washed in clean water to remove the dust and sand particles. The sheaths are hot pressed and made into areca palm plates, bowls and food containers. Compared to other disposable items, areca palm products are 100% natural, eco-friendly. No synthetic adhesives or binders used in the manufacturing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crozborder.com/areca-palm-leaf-plates-manufacturing-process/|title=How areca palm products are made?|last=|first=|date=2019-11-05|website=CrozBorder|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>\n[[File:500ml areca palm food container .jpg|thumb]]\n<br />\n\n== Cost ==\nBy reducing the need for equipment and additional labor, disposable foodservice packaging is an economical alternative to multiuse items and eliminates the need for dishwashers and other support equipment (racks, carts, dollies, shelving, bins). It can also save money on water and energy used by dishwashers and can eliminate the need to replace reusables that are broken, damaged, stolen or accidentally discarded.<ref>[http://fpi.org/dms/Main.asp Library<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214001303/http://fpi.org/dms/Main.asp |date=February 14, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== Other Economics ==\n[[Disposable tableware]] was a key part of the business strategy of chain [[fast food]] restaurants in the US. In order for the business model to work, fast food chains, notably [[McDonald's]], had to convince consumers<ref name=\"dontbus\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skoozeme.com/issues/dontbus.html|title=Don't Bus Throw-Away Utensils and Tableware|website=www.skoozeme.com|accessdate=21 May 2019}}</ref> through advertising campaigns to carry their own tableware to a waste bins, in order to avoid labor expenses incurred in clearing tables. By establishing a custom in which customers are encouraged to carry disposables, some of the internal costs of the disposable tableware can be offset.\n\n== Environmental concerns ==\n[[File:Coffee-cup-sleeve.jpg|thumb|[[Coffee cup sleeve]] on a coffee cup; sleeve makes it easy to hold hot drinks.]]\n{{see|plastic waste|litter}}\n\n=== Comparison with washable foodservice products ===\nAccording to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], paper and plastic foodservice packaging discarded in the country's [[municipal solid waste]] stream accounted 1.3 percent in 2007 (by weight) of municipal solid waste.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/nonhaz/municipal/index.htm|title=Advancing Sustainable Materials Management: Facts and Figures|first=US|last=EPA,OSWER,ORCR|date=2015-09-22|work=EPA.gov|access-date=4 April 2017}}</ref> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also says that an often-cited [[waste prevention]] measure is the use of washable plates, cups, and napkins instead of the disposable variety.\n\nWhile this will reduce solid waste, it will have other environmental effects, such as increased water and [[Energy|energy use]]. Overall, reusable dishware \u2013 even if only offered to customers for on-site use \u2013 is considered to be the best environmental choice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/sustainabilityatwork/article/507465|title=Disposable Cups, Cutlery and Dishware|work=Resource Guide, Sustainability at work|publisher=City of Portland|date=2014|accessdate=2017-08-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Cost of recycling ===\nCollection costs, the value of scrap material, and increased energy expenditures create an additional economic barrier to recycling foodservice packaging. While recycling foodservice packaging is difficult, recycled materials are being used in some foodservice packaging.\n\n=== Environmental footprint ===\nMany people are working on reducing the [[environmental footprint]] of packaging for food service. Often a [[Life-cycle assessment]] is valuable to determine the effects throughout the entire system. Some actions include:\n* Packaging of incoming food and supplies can work towards the broad [[sustainable packaging]] guidelines offered by many organizations. This includes the recycling of packaging generated within the restaurant.\n* Packaging products used by the restaurant can include specified amounts of recycled content in the products.\n* Many packaging products can be [[compostable]], but care is needed to match the needs of  regional composting facilities. Sometimes products can be certified<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpiworld.org|title=Biodegradable Products Institute - Certified Compostable|author=|date=|work=BPIWorld.org|access-date=4 April 2017}}</ref> to meet international standards such as [[ASTM International]] D6400, ASTM D6868, and EN 13432.<ref>{{Citation\n | last = Dietz\n | first = C\n | title = Compostable Products for Food Services\n | publisher = Eco-Cycle\n | date=February 2013\n | url = http://www.ecocycle.org/files/pdfs/compostable_products_for_food_services.pdf\n }}</ref>\n* Some single-use food packaging is recyclable but [[food contamination]] of products is often a problem for recyclers.<ref>{{cite web |author=Raymond J.
