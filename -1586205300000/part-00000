The '''Chicago National League Ball Club''' is the only franchise to play continuously in the same city since the formation of the National League in [[1876 in baseball|1876]]. They are the earliest formed active [[Major North American professional sports teams|professional sports club]] in North America. In their history, they have also been known as the White Stockings, Orphans, and  Colts.\n\n==Chicago White Stockings/Chicago Colts==\n===1870: The Chicago White Stockings Base Ball Club===\n[[File:1870chicagoclub.jpg|thumb|left|1870 Chicago White Stockings (later Cubs): (l-r) [[Ned Cuthbert]], [[Fred Treacey]], [[Charlie Hodes]], [[Levi Meyerle]], [[Ed Pinkham (baseball)|Ed Pinkham]], [[Jimmy Wood]], [[Bub McAtee]], [[Bill Craver]], [[Marshall King]], [[Clipper Flynn]]]]\nThe success and fame won by the [[Brooklyn Atlantics]], organized baseball's first true dynasty, and the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]] (c. 1867\u20131870) baseball's first openly all-[[Major North American professional sports teams|professional team]], led to a minor explosion of other openly professional clubs by the late 1860s, each with the singular goal of defeating the Red Stockings, who had accumulated an unparalleled 89-game winning streak. It was common at the time for sportswriters to refer to teams by their uniform colors, and it happens that Chicago's club, which was officially known as '''The Chicago Base Ball Club,''' adopted white. On April 29, 1870, the '''Chicago White Stockings''' played their first game against the St. Louis Unions, and soundly defeated the Unions 7\u20131.<ref>{{cite news|title=Opening of the Base Ball Campaign at St. Louis|work=Chicago Tribune|date=1870-04-30}}</ref> The White Stockings divided their games between their downtown practice field, [[Ogden Park]], and a larger facility set up at [[Dexter Park (Chicago)|Dexter Park]] where they hosted games expected to draw larger crowds.\n\nAfter some individually arranged contests, using mostly the same roster, Chicago managed to put together a 10-man roster and joined the nation's top organized league, which was now allowing entry to professionals. This league, known as the '''[[National Association of Base Ball Players]]''', had been primarily dominated by the Atlantics and until very recently before the admitting of the Red Stockings and the White Stockings, had consisted of mostly baseball clubs from the New York and Washington, D.C. areas. Despite this East Coast dominance, Chicago won the '''NABBP''' championship that year, although the title was disputed by the opposing club, the [[New York Mutuals]].\n\n===1871&ndash;1875: William Hulbert and the National Association===\n[[Image:Cap Anson WSP 19080422.JPG|thumb|left|West Side Grounds served as the club's home for nearly 30 years]]\n{{main|National Association of Professional Base Ball Players}}\nThe following season, the time was right for the formation of the very first all-professional league, and thus the '''[[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]]''' was born, and the White Stockings, financed by businessman [[William Hulbert]], became charter members of the new league. After their experiment with a race track in 1870, the White Stockings returned to the downtown for 1871, a decision that would prove fateful.\n\nThe club arranged with the city to build a ballpark in the northeast corner of the public park then known as Lake Park, later named [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]]. The venue was dubbed the '''[[Union Base-Ball Grounds]],''' and the club was a close contender for the pennant until late in the season. On Sunday, October 8, the [[Great Chicago Fire]] erupted on the near south side and swept northward through the downtown. The wooden ballpark was right in the firestorm's path, and the grounds and all the team's equipment and uniforms were consumed.\n\nDespite that disaster, the White Stockings played their 1871 season to completion, on the road, in borrowed uniforms. They managed to finish second, just 2 games short of the title that was won by Philadelphia. Despite the strong finish, the club was compelled to drop out of the league during the city's recovery period until ultimately being revived in 1874, and moving into the newly built [[23rd Street Grounds]] on the near south side.\n\nAlthough the original Red Stockings had disbanded after 1870, many of the players became members of a new club by the same name, but now based in [[Boston]]. Over the next four seasons, the [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Red Stockings]] dominated the National Association and hoarded the game's best stars, even those under contract with other teams. Hulbert, the White Stockings club president, was disgusted by the lack of enforceable contracts (the most famous of these \"contract jumpers\" or \"revolvers\" was [[Davy Force]]) as well as the monopoly of the Boston club and the league's inability to enforce a mandatory schedule. Gambling and alcohol were also seen as serious problems, with games too often being suspected of being \"thrown\". As a result, Hulbert spearheaded the formation of a new, stronger, more ethical organization. During the last years of the NA, Hulbert worked behind the scenes, to convince the owners of the [[St. Louis Brown Stockings|St. Louis Browns]], [[Hartford Dark Blues]], [[Philadelphia Athletics]], and a few others to join the White Stockings in his new league, which would be known as the [[National League|National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs]]. The National League's formation meant the end of the NA, as its remaining clubs shut down or reverted to amateur or minor status.\n\n===1876&ndash;1900: The National League===\n[[Image:1876 white stockings.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The 1876 White Stockings won the N.L.'s first pennant]]\n{{main|National League}}\nAfter the 1875 season ended, Hulbert was principal in the acquisition of several key players, including Boston pitcher [[Albert Spalding]] and first baseman [[Cap Anson|Adrian Anson]] of the [[Philadelphia Athletics]]. The club continued to play its home games at 23rd Street.\n\nWith the pieces in place, the '''Chicago National League Ball Club''' quickly established themselves as one of the new National League's top teams. Spalding won 47 games that season, and [[Deacon White|James \"Deacon\" White]] and [[Ross Barnes]], also brought in by Hulbert, were major contributors as well, as Barnes hit .429 that season and White, one of the last great bare-handed catchers, led the league in RBI. The White Stockings cruised through the National League's inaugural season of 1876, winning the league's first championship.\n\nNear the end of the season, Mutual of New York and Athletic of Philadelphia, who were remnants of the NA, dropped out of contention and refused to play the remainder of their respective schedules. Hulbert flexed his executive muscle, expelling both franchises from the league.\n\nDespite Hulbert's attempt to make Chicago the overpowering team that Boston had been during the NA years, the next season found Chicago finishing a disappointing 5th in the 6 team league, behind a resurgent Boston entry (another NA carryover) in the 60-game season. In 1878, the club arranged with the city to build a new [[Union Base-Ball Grounds|Lake Park]] ballpark in essentially the same place as the 1871 ballpark. Chicago improved over the next two seasons as the schedules grew to around 75 or more games.\n\nIn 1880 the White Stockings won 67 and lost 17, for an all-time NL record .798 winning percentage.\n\n====Cap Anson and a Chicago dynasty====\n[[Image:Cap anson studio photo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|right|Cap Anson, who played a record 27 straight seasons, was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1939]]\n\nAdrian Anson, the team's best player and perhaps the greatest ballplayer in the early era of professional baseball, became the club's captain, and was so much identified as the face of the club he became better known as [[Cap Anson]]. After the 1876 pennant, which at the time was the game's top prize, Anson led the team to a great amount of success in the early seasons of the National League, winning pennants in 1880 and 1881 as well. The length of the season and long travel times between games at the time was such that most teams got by with two principal starters, and Chicago had two very good ones in [[Larry Corcoran]] and [[Fred Goldsmith (baseball)|Fred Goldsmith]]. Corcoran, who won 43 games in 1880, threw three no-hitters in the early part of the decade, a record that would stand until being broken by [[Sandy Koufax]] in 1965. Goldsmith is one of two pitchers credited with the invention of the [[curveball]]. The two were baseball's first true \"pitching rotation.\"\n\nIn 1882, Hulbert died suddenly, and Al Spalding, who had retired a few years earlier to start [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] sporting goods, assumed ownership of the club, with Anson acting as first baseman and manager. That season was also the first for the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]], the self-proclaimed \"beer and whiskey league\", which began play as a second \"major league.\" The AA offered alcohol and Sunday games, moves which forced the more traditional NL into changes that likely would not have been made had Hulbert lived. Chicago played an (unauthorized) 2-game post-season series against the AA champions, the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. Each team won 1 game and then the series was ended.\n\nThe White Stockings slipped a bit in 1883, finishing 4 games behind Boston. For 1884, the club made a ground rules change at their home ballpark. Its dimensions, especially right field, were very cozy, perhaps less than 200 feet from home plate. Fly balls hit over the right field fence were previously ruled doubles, but in 1884 they were to be ruled as home runs. The batters began aiming for right field, and set some very dubious home run records that would last for decades until the modern \"lively ball\" era began. This change hurt more than it helped, as the club finished 22 games off the pace.\n\nFor 1885, the city reclaimed its lakefront land, and the club went looking for a new home. They found a lot available on the near west side and began building, finally opening \"[[West Side Park|West Side Park I]]\" in June. The White Stockings, despite being vagabonds for their first two months, played strong and won the NL pennant by 2 games over the New York Giants. Meanwhile, the [[St. Louis Browns (NL)|St. Louis Browns]] easily won the first of what would prove to be four consecutive pennants as they dominated the AA.\n\nChicago appeared ready to return to the top in 1885.  The \"Chicago Stone Wall\", the greatest infield of its day, was in place, anchored by Anson and [[Ned Williamson]], who hit 27 home runs in 1884 (25 at home, 2 on the road), a record which would stand until being broken by [[Babe Ruth]] in 1919. [[King Kelly]] was the best catcher in the league and Corcoran was primary pitcher, but [[John Clarkson]], a product of an Anson scouting trip, would lead Chicago to yet another pennant. Much has been written about [[Old Hoss Radbourn]]'s record 60 victories for the [[Providence Grays]] of 1884, but Clarkson won an amazing 53 games in 1885, despite being second to Corcoran in the rotation. Anson considered the '85-'86 teams the best he managed.\n\nDuring this period, Anson became the first ballplayer credited with achieving 3,000 hits. Anson's actual number of hits varies depending on the source. MLB itself recognizes Anson as having over 3,000 hits.  His run producing prowess led the [[Chicago Tribune]] to propose a new stat, [[RBI|runs-batted-in]]. It would take years to [http://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/section/Top-100 become official], but research would reveal that Anson led the N.L. in RBI eight times, still the major league record. Anson's influence on the team is likely greater than that of any other single player's influence on any professional sports team, perhaps only rivaled by what Ruth would eventually become to the [[New York Yankees]] three decades later. Anson's mark was so deep that by the mid-1890s sportswriters had dropped the White Stockings name in favor of the '''Chicago Colts,''' or more commonly, \"Anson's Colts.\"\n\nAnson is also given the credit, or the blame, for setting the stage for the longest-lasting version<ref>The National Association had in 1868 adopted a rule barring any club with a black player from membership.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}</ref> of the \"[[Baseball color line|color line]]\" barring African-Americans from major league baseball.  In an August 10, 1883, exhibition game against the then-independent Toledo Blue Stockings, who would before the next season join the American Association, Anson refused to field his team as long as Toledo's catcher [[Moses Walker]], who was black, was in the lineup; Anson claimed that Walker was ineligible to play, because the rules then in effect permitted only gentlemen to play, and Walker as a black person was incapable of satisfying the definition of a \"gentlem[a]n.\"  The umpires disagreed and threatened both to grant the Blue Stockings a [[Forfeit (baseball)|victory by forfeit]] and to deprive Anson and his team of their share of the day's ticket sales unless Anson and his team took the field.<ref name=\"capanson.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.capanson.com/chapter4.html|title=Capanson.com|author=|date=|website=www.capanson.com|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref>  Anson relented and the game went on with Walker in the Toledo lineup, but in an 1884 game against Toledo, by now affiliated with the AA and playing as the Mudhens, Anson held his line and insisted that the arrangements for the game include a provision excluding black players from both teams' lineups.  By the 1897 season, the leagues adopted an agreement that neither they nor their minor-league affiliates would admit black players,<ref name=\"capanson.com\"/> establishing a racial barrier in professional baseball for the next half-century.\n\nA post-season \"World's Championship Series\" had been held in 1884 between the champions of the League (Providence) and the Association (Metropolitan), and the White Stockings and the Browns arranged to continue that new tradition in 1885. This was the first meeting between Chicago and a St. Louis franchise which would eventually join the NL and become known as the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. The two clubs remain [[Cardinals\u2013Cubs rivalry|perennial rivals]].\n\nThe 1885 Series ended in dispute and with no clear resolution. Both clubs faced each other again in 1886, and this time around there was no question about the outcome, with the Browns winning the Series 4 games to 2.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7154062/review_of_the_year_1886_in_baseball/ \"They Never Lie: Figures in the Case of the League vs. the Association,\"] ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch,'' Oct. 30, 1886, pg. 10.</ref> This marked the only AA win in the 19th Century World Series contests.\n\nThings changed with time for the White Stockings / Colts. Following Chicago's great run during the 1880s, the on-field fortunes of Anson's Colts dwindled during the mid-1890s, despite the emergence of [[Bill Lange]], who set the club record for steals with 84 in 1897, and was one of the league's best hitters for seven seasons. The club would have to await revival under new leadership, however, for in 1898, Spalding opted not to renew Anson's contract, and a year later Lange retired to become a professional scout.\n<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Gold\n  | first = Eddie\n  | authorlink = \n  |author2=Art Ahrens\n  | title = The Golden Era Cubs: 1876-1940\n  | publisher = Bonus Books\n  | year = 1985\n  | location = \n  | pages = \n  | url = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Transition===\nBaseball's popularity in general faded somewhat during the 1890s. In an apparent effort to boost attendance, in 1891 the Colts began splitting their schedule between West Side Park and the recently built [[South Side Park]]. In 1892 they played their entire schedule on the south side, but decided to move more toward the city center again. Early in the 1893 season they opened \"[[West Side Park|West Side Park II]]\", a wooden structure that would be their home for the next 23 seasons.\n\nAnson's departure led to the team's nickname transitioning through the next few seasons. With the loss of their \"Pop\" as Anson had become known, at times the media referred to the club as the '''Remnants''' or the '''Orphans'''. The \"Colts\" name remained in circulation through the 1905 season, along with Orphans and Remnants, depending on which newspaper or fan one spoke to. The name \"Cubs\" first appeared in print in 1902 and gained popularity over the next four years, before becoming the sole nickname in 1906;<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Ahrens\n  | first = Art\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Chicago Cubs: Tinker to Evers to Chance\n  | publisher = Arcadia\n  | year = 2007\n  | location = \n  | pages = \n  | url = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = }}</ref> the Cub-in-the-C logo first appeared on uniforms in 1908 and the name \"Cubs\" the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/detail_page.asp?fileName=nl_1908_chicago.gif&Entryid=124|title=National Baseball Hall of Fame - Dressed to the Nines - Uniform Database|author=|date=|website=exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref>\nThe old name, Chicago White Stockings, was adopted in 1900 by the new [[American League|American Base Ball League]] entry on Chicago's south side, initially as a minor league entry. The AL turned major in 1901, and the south siders' adopted nickname was soon shortened by the press to [[Chicago White Sox]].\n\n==Early MLB years (dead-ball era)==\n===1901&ndash;1913: A new Cubs Dynasty===\nAfter the formation of the American League, Al Spalding gave up ownership of the club to concentrate on touring the country to promote his sporting goods company, selling the team to John Hart in 1902. Oddly, the team Spalding put together before he left was one of his grandest accomplishments.  [[Joe Tinker]] ([[shortstop]]), [[Johnny Evers]] ([[second baseman]]), and [[Frank Chance]] ([[first baseman]]) were three Hall-of-Fame Cubs [[infielder]]s who played together from 1903 to 1912. They, along with third baseman [[Harry Steinfeldt]] and [[catcher]] [[Johnny Kling]], formed the infield on what would become one of the most dominant baseball teams of all time.\n\nBy 1905 the Cubs were owned by Charles Murphy, who purchased the franchise for $125,000. Chance took over as manager for the ailing [[Frank Selee]] in that year, and the Cubs responded by winning four pennants and two World Series titles over a five-year span. Their record of 116 victories (in a 154-game season) in 1906 has not been broken, though it was tied by the [[Seattle Mariners]] in 2001 in a 162-game season. The 1906 Cubs still hold the record for [[List of best MLB season records|best winning percentage]] of the modern era, with a .763 mark. However, they lost the [[1906 World Series]] to their crosstown rival White Sox.\n\nThe Cubs again relied on dominant pitching during this period, featuring hurlers such as [[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai \"Three-Finger\" Brown]], [[Jack Taylor (20th century baseball player)|Jack Taylor]], [[Ed Reulbach]], [[Jack Pfiester]] and [[Orval Overall]]. The Cubs' pitchers posted a record for lowest staff [[earned run average]] that still stands today. Reulbach threw a one-hitter in the 1906 World Series, one of a small handful of twirlers to pitch low-hit games in the post-season. Brown acquired his unique and indelicate nickname from having lost most of his index finger in farm machinery when he was a youngster. This gave him the ability to put a natural extra spin on his pitches, which often frustrated opposing batters.\n\nIn 1907, the Cubs won 107 games, dominating the National League once again. That year they met [[Ty Cobb]] and the [[Detroit Tigers]] in the World Series, beating them soundly, 4\u20131, for the franchise's first World Series championship. At the time a tie was replayed the next day from the beginning but counted in the series score, so officially the series was not a sweep.\n\nOn September 23, 1908, the Cubs and [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], involved in a tight pennant race, were tied in the bottom of the ninth inning at the [[Polo Grounds]]. The Giants had runners of first and third and two outs when [[Al Bridwell]] hit a single to center field, scoring [[Moose McCormick]] from third with the Giants\u2019 apparent winning run, but the runner on first base, rookie [[Fred Merkle]], went half way to second and then sprinted to the clubhouse after McCormick touched home plate. As fans swarmed the field, Evers retrieved the ball and touched second. Since there were two outs, a forceout was called at second base, ending the inning and the game. The game went down in history as \"[[Merkle's Boner]]\". Because of the tie, the Giants and Cubs ended up tied for first place. The Giants lost the league's first one-game playoff, and the Cubs went on to the World Series, where they defeated the Tigers once again, this time four games to one, for their second consecutive World Series championship. It would be their last World Series victory for 108 years.\n\n====Tinker to Evers to Chance====\nSome experts believe the Cubs could have been in the Series for five straight seasons had Johnny Kling not sat out the entire 1909 season. Kling temporarily retired to play professional [[pocket billiards]], but his primary reason for not playing was most likely a contract dispute. His absence obviously hurt the stability of the pitching staff, as when he returned in 1910 the Cubs won the pennant again, although the veteran club was unable to defeat the young Philadelphia Athletics in the Fall Classic.\n\nDuring that 1910 season, the club's star infielders, Tinkers, Evers, and Chance, gained even more national acclaim after turning a critical [[double play]] against the [[New York Giants]] in a July game. The trio was immortalized in [[Franklin P. Adams]]' poem ''[[Baseball's Sad Lexicon]]'', which first appeared in the July 18, 1910, edition of the ''[[New York Evening Mail]]'':[[File:Chicago Cubs team picture, 1906.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Chicago reached the World Series four times between 1906 and 1910, winning twice.]]\n\n:These are the saddest of possible words:\n:\"Tinker to Evers to Chance.\"\n:Trio of bear cubs, and fleeter than birds,\n:Tinker and Evers and Chance.\n:Ruthlessly pricking our [[gonfalon]] bubble,\n:Making a Giant hit into a double--\n:Words that are heavy with nothing but trouble:\n:\"Tinker to Evers to Chance.\"\n\n\"Gonfalon\" is a poetic way of referring to the [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] that both clubs battled for. The expression \"Tinker to Evers to Chance\" is still used today and means \"well-oiled routine\" or a \"sure thing.\"\n\nTinker and Evers reportedly could not stand each other and rarely spoke off the field. Evers, a high-strung, argumentative man, suffered a nervous breakdown in 1911 and rarely played that year. Chance suffered a near-fatal beaning the same year. The trio played together little after that. In 1913, Chance went to manage the [[New York Yankees]] and Tinker went to Cincinnati to manage the [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds]], and that was the end of one of the most notable infields in baseball. They were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame together in 1946. Tinker and Evers reportedly became amicable in their old age, with the baseball wars far behind them.\n\n===1914&ndash;1924: Lasker, Weeghman, and the double-Bills===\nThe Cubs fell into a lengthy doldrum after the departure of their stars.  In 1916, advertising executive [[Albert Lasker]] and his partner [[Charles Phelps Taft]] obtained a large block of shares and soon acquired majority ownership of the Cubs. In 1916 Taft was bought out by [[Charles Weeghman|Charlie Weeghman]], who had owned the [[Chicago Whales]] of the short-lived [[Federal League]], and was proprietor of a popular chain of lunch counters.[[Image:Max Flack Cubs 1920.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cubs right fielder [[Max Flack]], c. 1920. Note the [[Doublemint]] \"elves\" atop the scoreboard, and the [[Wilson Sporting Goods]] sign on the right field wall.]]\n\nWeeghman and Lasker moved the Cubs to the Whales' old home, [[Weeghman Park]], in 1916.  The club was soon playing competitively again, and won the NL [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] in the war-shortened season of 1918, where they played a part in another team's curse, [[Curse of the Bambino]]. In the [[1918 World Series]], the North Siders, led by pitcher [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]], posted the majors' best record at 84&ndash;45 that year, and faced the [[Boston Red Sox]]. [[Babe Ruth]] won two games in the series, including a 1&ndash;0 complete-game [[shutout]] in the opener to start off what would be a six-game Boston triumph. At the time considered a star pitcher who \"''just happened''\" to hit 29 home runs, Ruth was sold to the Yankees a year later, starting the Red Sox' own tale of futility which lasted for 86 years. The 1918 Series was poorly attended and there were rumblings that it was \"fixed\", but with America's energy focused on World War I, nothing came of these suspicions.\n\nFollowing the 1919 [[Black Sox Scandal]], which led to yet another \"curse\" on the south side of Chicago, baseball in the city fell into very dark times and Lasker worked to create a new governing authority for Major League Baseball that led to Judge [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] becoming the first [[Commissioner of Baseball]]. By then, Weeghman was out of the picture. His lunch counter business fell on hard times after the war, and he was forced to sell more and more stock to Lasker's friend, chewing gum magnate [[William Wrigley, Jr.]] By 1918, Weeghman had sold his remaining stock to Wrigley. In 1921, Wrigley bought Lasker's controlling stake as well.<ref name=\"TBT\">{{cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball |last=Purdy |first=Dennis |year=2006 |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-7611-3943-5 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.laskerfoundation.org/about/albert.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207142152/http://www.laskerfoundation.org/about/albert.html |archive-date=2007-12-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==1925&ndash;1946: Early Wrigley years==\n===Every three years===\nAfter buying the rest of Lasker's shares, Wrigley changed the name of the team's home ballpark to Wrigley Field in 1925 in order to generate more exposure for his brand of chewing gum.  This is one of the earliest examples of corporate sponsorship. Wrigley also acquired the services of astute baseball man [[William Veeck, Sr.]], appointing him as club president. Veeck had been a sportswriter, and had criticized Cubs management. In an unusual move, Wrigley challenged Veeck to see if he could do better. It proved to be a good move.\n\nWith Wrigley's money and Veeck's savvy, the Cubs were soon back in business in the National League, the front office having built a team that would be strong contenders for the next decade. [[Hack Wilson]], [[Gabby Hartnett]], [[Billy Herman]], [[Rogers Hornsby]], and many other stars donned Cub uniforms during that stretch, and they achieved the unusual accomplishment of winning a pennant every three years \u2013 1929, 1932, 1935 and 1938.  Unfortunately, their success did not extend to the post-season, as they fell to their [[American League]] rivals each time, often in humiliating fashion.  One example was in game 4 of the [[1929 World Series]] when the Cubs, leading 8\u20130 at the time, yielded 10 runs to the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] in the seventh inning. A key play in that inning was center fielder Hack Wilson losing a fly ball in the sun, resulting in a 3-run inside-the-park homer.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:hack-wilson.jpg|thumb|right|150px|right|Hack Wilson hit .356 with 56 HR and 191 RBI in 1930.]] -->\n\nIn the [[1932 World Series]], Babe Ruth again torched the North Siders, though this time with his bat, when he led New York in a series in which he hit his famous \"[[Babe Ruth's called shot|called shot]]\" home run in Chicago during Game 3. The Yankees then went on to a four-game sweep of the Northsiders. There were some historic moments for the Cubs as well, as they won the 1935 pennant in thrilling fashion. Billy Herman hit a career best .341 and led the Cubs to 21 straight wins in September, which propelled the club to the [[1935 World Series]] where they fell to [[Hank Greenberg]]'s [[Detroit Tigers]] in a hard-fought, 6 game series.\n\nThe 1938 season saw [[Dizzy Dean]] lead the team's pitching staff and provided an historic moment when they won a crucial, late-season game with a \"walk-off\" home run by player-manager Gabby Hartnett, which became known in baseball [[folklore]] as \"[[The Homer in the Gloamin']].\"  However, Chicago fell to the Yankees again in the [[1938 World Series]]. By this time, the 'double-Bills' had both died, and the front office, now under [[P.K. Wrigley]], was unable to rekindle the success his father had created, and so the team would slip into its first period of mediocrity.\n\n===The Curse===\n{{main|Curse of the Billy Goat}}\nThe Cubs enjoyed one more pennant, at the close of another World War, led by outfielder [[Andy Pafko]] and infielder [[Phil Cavarretta]].  Due to the wartime travel restrictions, the first three games were played in Detroit, where the Cubs won two of them, and the last four were to be played at Wrigley.  The Cubs won Game 1 9-0 and [[Claude Passeau]] tossed a one hitter in Game 3 to give the Northsiders a 2\u20131 advantage as the series shifted to Wrigley Field.\n\nIn Game 4, the [[Curse of the Billy Goat]] was laid upon the Cubs when [[Philip K. Wrigley]] ejected Billy Sianis, who had come to the game with two box seat tickets, one for him and one for his goat.  They paraded around for a few innings, but ultimately Wrigley demanded the goat leave the park due to complaints about its [[unpleasant odor]].  Upon his ejection, an angry Sianis uttered, ''\"the Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more.\"'', and his family said he then sent a telegram to the Cubs owner saying that they would never win another Pennant or World Series.<ref name=\"Selzer2014\">{{cite book|author=Adam Selzer|title=Chronicles of Old Chicago: Exploring the History and Lore of the Windy City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SPEiBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA156|date=1 July 2014|publisher=Museyon Inc|isbn=978-0-9846334-8-7|page=156}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Avila|first=Michael|title=Are the Chicago Cubs Really Cursed?|url=http://www.livescience.com/32802-are-the-chicago-cubs-really-cursed.html|publisher=[[LiveScience]]|date=September 2, 2010|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}</ref> The Cubs lost game 4, and despite a heroic series by Cavarretta, lost the [[1945 World Series]] in seven games. Although the Cubs occasionally appeared in post-season series since divisional play began in 1969, they did not appear in or win a World Series again until 2016.\n\n==Late Wrigley years (1947&ndash;1981)==\n===1947&ndash;1981: The dark ages===\nAfter the [[Curse of the Billy Goat]], a few years into the post-World War II era, astute observers of the game began to suspect that something had gone wrong with the Cubs franchise, and that it might take them a long time to recover. In his 1950 book ''The World Series and Highlights of Baseball'', LaMont Buchanan wrote the following prose next to photos of Wrigley (apparently taken during the [[1945 World Series]]) and of their newly hired manager: \n\n''\"From the sublime to last place!''\n\n''Wrigley Field, the ivy of its walls still whispering of past greatness, ''\n\n''Watches its Cubs grow less ferocious in '47, '48, '49. ''\n \n''New doctor of the cure is smiling Frank Frisch, ''\n\n''Veteran of previous baseball transfusions who thinks, ''\n\n''It's nice to have the fans with you.' ''\n\n''Chicago has a great baseball tradition. ''\n\n''The fans remember glorious yesterdays as they wait for brighter tomorrows. ''\n\n''And eventually their Cubs will bite again!\"''\n\nLittle did anyone realize how long \"eventually\" would turn out to be. After losing the 1945 World Series, the Cubs finished 82\u201371, good for third place in 1946, but did not enter post-season play.  The following year, however, the Cubs slumped to 69-85 and sixth place. \n\nThe Cubs would spend most of the next two decades buried deep in the bottom half of the National League. From 1947 to 1966, the Cubs only managed a .500 record twice. Many of those teams lost over 90 games, and in 1962 and 1966 they lost over 100.  All this futility came despite the excellent play of shortstop [[Ernie Banks]], who became known as ''\"Mr. Cub\"''.  Finding help for Banks, however, turned out to be the team's downfall. Players such as [[Hank Sauer]] and [[Ralph Kiner]] found only temporary homes in Chicago during the early 1950s, and [[Phil Cavarretta]]'s numbers tailed off late in his career. Incidentally, Cavarretta, who played 20 seasons for the Cubs and had been player/manager, was fired during spring training of 1954 after admitting the team was unlikely to finish above 5th place (they finished 7th).\n\nOne of Wrigley's attempts to right the ship actually set the team further back.  In December 1960, he announced the Cubs would no longer have a manager.  Instead, an eight-member \"[[College of Coaches]]\" would run the club.  The eight men would rotate all the way through the Cubs organization, so that every player from Class D (equivalent to today's Rookie Leagues) on up would learn a standard system of play.  Each coach would serve as \"head coach\" of the Cubs during his tenure there.\n\nThis approach could be considered visionary in that it anticipated the coaching specialization that has evolved in the modern game. However, this experiment proved to be poorly executed. There was no real pattern to the rotation, and each coach brought a different playing style.  Some talent finally returned to the North Side during this era, in the form of third baseman [[Ron Santo]] and outfielder [[Billy Williams (left fielder)|Billy Williams]] (the 1961 National League [[MLB Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]]). However, without consistent leadership in the dugout, the Cubs remained buried in the second division.  They only had one winning record during the four-year experiment, never finished higher than 7th, and got no closer than 17 games out of first. This stretch also saw some of the worst teams in Cubs history; the 1962 season, for instance, saw the team lose 103 games &ndash; the most in franchise history. There was also a racial factor in the rotation, as [[Buck O'Neil]] was one of the coaches but was never promoted to the \"head coach\" position. Wrigley finally relented and named one person as sole \"head coach\" in 1963, but did not completely scrap the experiment until [[Leo Durocher]] took over in 1966 and emphatically declared himself manager, with Wrigley's support.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the Cubs began showing signs of life, sparked by Banks, Williams, and Santo and the emergence of ace pitcher [[Ferguson Jenkins]]. In 1967 and 1968 the club put together its first back-to-back winning seasons since 1945\u20131946, making fans hopeful for a spectacular 1969 season.\n\n===Fall of 1969===\n{{main|1969 Chicago Cubs season}}\nIn 1969, the Cubs started out 11&ndash;1, building a substantial lead in the newly created [[National League East]]. Chicago surged through the All-Star break, led by the quartet of eventual Hall of Famers in Banks, Williams, Santo and Jenkins.. Jenkins ultimately won 21 games, [[Bill Hands]] was also a 20-game winner, and [[Ken Holtzman]] won 17, which included a no-hitter on August 19. Chicago led the division by {{frac|8|1|2}} games over St. Louis and by {{frac|9|1|2}} games over the [[New York Mets]] in late August, but the Cubs wilted under pressure, losing key games to the Mets, and finished at 92&ndash;70, eight games out of first. Many superstitious fans attribute this collapse to an incident at [[Shea Stadium]] on September 9, when a fan released a [[black cat]] onto the field, thereby further cursing the club. Others have stated the sheer number of day games that the Cubs had to play contributed to the disaster. Chicago, being near [[Lake Michigan]], boasts summers which are quite humid (85&ndash;90&nbsp;\u00b0F on average), and playing in this heat day after day might have taken its toll. From August 14 through the end of the season, the Mets, who played mostly night games, had an amazing 38&ndash;11 record, finishing with 100 wins while the second place Cubs slumped in September, going only 8&ndash;17.\n\n===1970&ndash;1981 \u2013 Bad teams & the June Swoon===\n[[File:Wrigley Field - Cubs vs. Reds 1970.jpg|thumb|255px|The Cubs play at Wrigley Field, May 1970]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cubs69.gif|thumb|200px|left|Chicago Cubs logo from the 1960s and 1970s]] -->\nIn the decade of the 1970s and through the 1983 season, the Cubs rarely tasted few substantial successes. Following the disastrous 1969 campaign, the Cubs fell into mediocrity, finishing slightly over .500 in 1970, 1971 and 1972, while they still had most of the core players from the 1969 team in uniform, including the \"Old Guard\" of Santo and Williams on the field and Jenkins, Holtzman, and [[Milt Pappas]], who tossed a no-hitter in 1972, on the mound. (No Cub would again pitch a no-hitter until Carlos Zambrano on September 15, 2008.) After 1973, however, the bulk of those core players either retired or were traded, and the Cubs sunk to the bottom of the National League East pecking order. Between 1973 and 1983 they were a combined 165 games under .500.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/roster.php?y=1975&t=CHN|title=1975 Chicago Cubs Roster by Baseball Almanac|work=baseball-almanac.com|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref> It was during this entire decade of poor baseball that the term ''\"Loveable Losers\"'' became a catch phrase, since the fans were still coming out to see the team despite the dreadful quality of the on-field product.\n\nPhil Wrigley died in 1977, leaving the team to his son, [[William Wrigley III]].  This year saw the Cubs' best finish in the 1970s, but even this was a testament to the team's futility during the \"Dark Ages\", as all star [[Bobby Murcer]] led the baby blue pinstriped [[1977 Chicago Cubs season|'77 club]] into first place at 47&ndash;22 by June 28, and the team enjoyed an 8\u00bd game lead in the N.L. East. After entering the all star break at 54\u201335, still an impressive 19 games above .500, the team started to crack as the [[1977 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] picked up steam, cutting the Cubs division lead to only two games. As the summer progressed the Cubs spiraled out of contention, playing poorly in August and ending the season with a streak in which they lost 17 of 22 games, ultimately finishing at 81&ndash;81, a staggering 22 games behind Philadelphia.\n\nAmazingly, the club then had similar, though not as exaggerated, falls in the two subsequent campaigns, despite the acquisition of slugger [[Dave Kingman]]. The Cubs were as many as 11 games over .500 in '78 and peaked at 13 over in '79, but still finished with losing records both seasons. This trait of contending well into the beginning of the summer and then falling in the standings became known as ''\"The June Swoon.\"'' Along with Kingman, Cub rosters in this period featured such players as [[Rick Reuschel]], who won 20 games in the infamous '77 season, as well as [[Bill Madlock]], [[Bill Buckner]], [[Keith Moreland]], [[Jos\u00e9 Cardenal]], and [[Iv\u00e1n DeJes\u00fas]].\n\n==1981-2008: Tribune Company era==\n===1984 and 1989 NL East Champs===\n{{main|1984 Chicago Cubs season|1989 Chicago Cubs season}}\nWilliam Wrigley's mother died within a few months of Phil Wrigley, saddling William with a massive estate tax bill.  With most of his money tied up in either the Wrigley Company or the Cubs, William was forced to put the Cubs up for sale.  In 1981, the [[Chicago Tribune|Tribune Company]] purchased the Cubs from the Wrigley family for $20.5 million\u2014a handsome return on William Wrigley, Jr.'s purchase of a stake in the team 65 years earlier\u2014in the middle of another losing season. In 1982, DeJesus, one of the team's better players, was traded to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] for shortstop [[Larry Bowa]] and infielder [[Ryne Sandberg]].\n\nOn Opening day of 1981 only [http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teams/cubsatte.shtml 10,672] entered the gates. By 1983, thanks to the exposure of the Chicago Tribune and WGN, Rick Reuschel pitched in front of a crowd of 18,268, yet this was all about to change dramatically. In mid-1983, manager [[Lee Elia]] was fired after a profanity-laced tirade against Cub fans and was replaced by [[Charlie Fox]] on an interim basis. In the offseason, the Cubs rebuilt the starting pitching staff through a series of trades by GM [[Dallas Green (baseball)|Dallas Green]], who started by dealing for [[Bobby Dernier]] and [[Gary Matthews|Gary ''\"The Sarge\"'' Matthews]] and inking pitcher [[Scott Sanderson (baseball)|Scott Sanderson]] to complement what was already a good team, boasting players such as third baseman [[Ron Cey]] and catcher [[Jody Davis (baseball)|Jody Davis]]. Green also hired [[Jim Frey]] as their new manager.\n\n====1984 NL East Champs====\nThe Cubs opened up the 1984 season going 12&ndash;8 in April, tied for first place. The race stayed tight through the first half of the season, and Green continued to deal for arms. [[Bill Buckner]] was sent to the [[Boston Red Sox]] for [[Dennis Eckersley]] and [[Mike Brumley (infielder)|Mike Brumley]], and on June 13, [[Mel Hall]] and [[Joe Carter]] were sent to the [[Cleveland Indians]] for starter [[Rick Sutcliffe]]. With the rotation set, the northsiders found themselves 42\u201334 at the end of June, tied with the Phillies and 1.5 games ahead of the Mets. In a game versus St. Louis, Ryne Sandberg captured the attention of the nation with two game-tying home runs off former Cub [[Bruce Sutter]], and eventually was named NL MVP. The second half of the '84 season was all Cubbies, as the northsiders posted a 54&ndash;31 record, and the city of Chicago was in pandemonium.\n\nThe end result was a league-best 96 victories and the NL East Championship, as the team clinched the division in Pittsburgh. In what was the team's first post-season appearance since the '45 pennant, Chicago met the [[San Diego Padres]]. The Cubs' 96 wins earned them home field advantage for the series. However, Wrigley Field did not yet have lights. CBS television, which broadcast the series, pressured the National League to award San Diego a third home game to allow for an additional prime-time broadcast. In the first game of the NLCS the Cubs won 13&ndash;0 behind two Gary Matthews home runs, and then took a 2&ndash;0 series lead with a 4&ndash;2 win in Game 2. With the City of Chicago in an uproar, the series headed west for the final three games, where the Cubs needed only one win to make it to the World Series. After being soundly beaten in Game 3, they lost Game 4 when All-Star closer [[Lee Smith (baseball)|Lee Smith]] allowed a [[walk-off home run]] to [[Steve Garvey]]. Many fans remember Garvey rounding first after his game-winning shot, pumping his fist into the air, as one of the lowest moments in Cubdom. Game 5 was just as bad; the Cubs took a 3&ndash;0 lead to the 6th inning with Sutcliffe, the 1984 NL Cy Young Award winner, on the mound, but a critical error by first baseman [[Leon Durham]] helped the Padres win the clinching game.  The current era of Wrigley Field being a \"hip\" place to be has its roots in the success of the '84 club.\n\n[[Image:Andre dawson.jpg|thumb|left|Andre Dawson meeting a young fan in 1988.]]\nMost publications picked the Cubs to repeat as Division Champs in 1985, especially after adding [[Dennis Eckersley]] to the rotation. The Cubs responded by starting out 35&ndash;19 by June 11, but swooned again, losing 13 in a row as the club's four top pitchers all hit the disabled list, and the Cardinals took the division crown as the North Siders ended up a disappointing 77&ndash;84. [[Shawon Dunston]], the #1 overall pick in the '82 draft came up from the minors for good near the end of the season.\n\nDuring '86 season, Jim Frey was replaced at skipper with former Yankee [[Gene Michael]], but the team went through two more years of poor baseball. Outfielder [[Andre Dawson]] was signed as a free agent prior to the 1987 season. Dallas Green was initially reluctant to sign Dawson, as they planned to start [[Brian Dayett]] in right, but Dawson proved his worth as he hit 49 round-trippers and took home NL MVP honors for a last place Cub team that season, the only player to accomplish that feat in the last 20 seasons.\n\n[[File:President Reagan throws out the First Pitch at a Chicago Cubs Baseball Game on September 30, 1988.webm|thumb|right|200px|[[President Reagan]] throws out the First Pitch at a Chicago Cubs Baseball Game on September 30, 1988]]\nThe 1988 team, under new skipper [[Don Zimmer]] (who was promoted after Frey took the General Manager position), was the first of a new era in Cub history, as lights were installed at Wrigley Field and were first to be used for a night game on August 8. The game was rained out in the early innings, and the first official night game was the next day, as the Cubs beat the Mets 6&ndash;4. The Mets, however, had a 100 win season, and the Cubs, still anchored by Sutcliffe, \"Ryno\" Sandberg, and \"Hawk\" Dawson, finished in a distant fourth place. This was despite having what at the time was a franchise record six All-Stars as Dawson, Dunston, and Sandberg were joined by [[Vance Law]], [[Greg Maddux]], and [[Rafael Palmeiro]].\n\nIn 1989, the club made some noise as they won the NL East once again, finishing up a 93 win season with a six-game lead over the Mets. Some young faces contributed to the '89 success, with 1B [[Mark Grace]] leading the team in hitting and fellow sophomore [[Damon Berryhill]] providing stability behind the plate for Maddux and the other Cub hurlers. Speedy outfielder [[Dwight Smith (baseball)|Dwight Smith]] finished 2nd in the race for NL Rookie of the Year to fellow Cub outfielder [[Jerome Walton]], who set the current club record hitting streak at 30 games. This time, Chicago met the San Francisco Giants in the [[1989 National League Championship Series|NLCS]]. After splitting the first two games at home, the series headed to the Bay Area. The Cubs were heavy underdogs to the star-loaded Giants, who boasted players such as [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]], [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]], and [[Will Clark]]. Despite an MVP caliber series from Grace, and although the team held a lead in each of the three games, they were unable to overcome bullpen letdowns and managerial blunders. This ultimately led to another early exit from the post season as the Giants eliminated the Cubs in five games (the NLCS had expanded from a best-of-five to a best-of-seven series in [[1985 National League Championship Series|1985]]). The Giants went on to lose to the [[Oakland A's]] in the famous \"[[1989 World Series|Earthquake Series]].\"\n\n===1990&ndash;2002: Ryno, Gracie, and Sammy===\n{{see also|1994&ndash;95 Major League Baseball strike}}\n{{main|1998 Chicago Cubs season|2001 Chicago Cubs season}}\nBetween 1990 and 1997, a time-frame which coincided with the 6 championship dynasty of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Chicago Bulls]], Cubs took a back seat in the headlines and also fell back into the doldrums of mediocrity. Most seasons in this period were basically over by the beginning of June. Despite their promise, Walton and Smith never regained the form they displayed as rookies in '89. Rick Sutcliffe retired and Greg Maddux, who won his first [[Cy Young Award]] in a Cub uniform, left for [[Atlanta]] via [[free-agent|free-agency]], which greatly frustrated the fan base. Their replacements came and went as GM [[Larry Himes]] struggled to find a proper mix. Slugger [[George Bell (outfielder)|George Bell]] was signed in 1991 and after a mediocre season was traded to the White Sox for [[Sammy Sosa]]. Pitchers [[Danny Jackson]], [[Jaime Navarro]], [[Randy Myers]] and [[Mike Morgan (baseball)|Mike Morgan]] brought initial hope to the [[Wrigley Field|''Friendly Confines'']] faithful but ultimately spawned no playoff berths.\n\n[[Image:Shawon Dunston.jpg|thumb|right|Shawon Dunston was a Cub for over a decade and inspired the ''Shawon-O-Meter'', with which fans tracked his batting average]]\nHimes was fired and replaced with [[Ed Lynch (baseball)|Ed Lynch]] in 1995, but the club's much beleaguered farm system was unable to help produce any help on the mound as minor league products such as [[Jim Bullinger]], [[Kevin Foster (baseball)|Kevin Foster]], [[Mike Harkey]], [[Jeff Pico]], and [[Frank Castillo]] were unable to establish themselves in any significant fashion in the post-strike years. [[Steve Trachsel]], a career journeyman, was the only pitcher the system produced during this period that had any longevity. On the offensive side, things were a little better. Although much hyped prospects such as [[Gary Scott (baseball)|Gary Scott]] and [[Drew Hall]] eventually did not pan out, there was some success. Mark Grace, known for his glove and his bat, along with rifle-armed SS Shawon Dunston and reliable catcher Joe Girardi became fan-favorites as Dawson and Sandberg solidified themselves as annual starters in the All-Star game with ''Ryno'' eventually becoming the highest paid player in baseball, retiring and then making a [[Michael Jordan|''Jordanesque'']] comeback.\n\n[[Brian McRae]], [[Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez (baseball)|Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez]] and [[Glenallen Hill]] all found temporary homes in Chicago during the mid-1990s, (Hill is the only player to ever hit a home run to the rooftops across Waveland Ave) and Sammy Sosa started to establish himself as a power hitter, slugging 36 homers three times, but the teams themselves were quite poor. During the seven-year period following the '89 season they had just two winning seasons, an 84&ndash;78 mark in 1993 and a 73&ndash;71 mark in the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened 1995 season]]. In 1997, the team signed lefty Terry Mulholland, but still hit rock bottom, losing their first 14 games to start the season and finishing in last place again with 94 losses. Near the end of the season Dunston was traded to [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pittsburgh]] and Sandberg retired (this time for good) at season's end, so most figured 1998 would be another season of tempered expectations on the Windy City's north side.\n \nThe departure of many fan favorites, combined with what would be the sixth and final championship run of the Bulls as well as the death of popular [[WGN-TV|WGN]] broadcaster [[Harry Caray]] just before the season dominated much of the media coverage, so the Cubs on-field expectations were uncharacteristically out of the headlines heading into the season.  This changed with the signing of left fielder [[Henry Rodr\u00edguez (outfielder)|Henry Rodr\u00edguez]] to complement Grace and Sosa in the lineup and inking closer [[Rod Beck]] and starter [[Kevin Tapani]] to bolster the pitching staff. The team also acquired infielders [[Mickey Morandini|Mickey ''\"The Dandy Little Glove Man\"'' Morandini]] and [[Jeff Blauser]]. With the season dedicated to Caray (whose grandson [[Chip Caray]] took over his duties alongside [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] in the Cub's TV booth) the Cubs found themselves involved in an intense Wild Card race with the Giants and Mets.  The Cubs became media-darlings once again, paced by Sosa's amazing 66 HR, MVP season and [[Kerry Wood]]'s dominating Rookie of the Year pitching, which included an MLB record-tying 20 strikeout game versus the [[Houston Astros]]. On the last day of the season, the Cubs fell 4&ndash;3 to Houston after a throwing error by Mulholland, but the team's playoff hopes were saved when Colorado's [[Neifi P\u00e9rez]] hit a walk-off home run to beat San Francisco later that night, and the Giants and Cubs finished tied for the Wild Card. The teams met in a one-game playoff in Chicago, in which [[Gary Gaetti]], claimed off waivers from St. Louis near the end of the season, hit a game-winning home run. Next up was Atlanta and Greg Maddux, but the North Siders played poorly, scoring only four runs as they were swept in 3 games.\n\nMany credit the Sosa&ndash;McGwire home run chase with \"saving baseball\", by both bringing in new, younger fans and bringing back old fans soured by the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike]]. After the season, GM [[Ed Lynch (baseball)|Ed Lynch]] and manager [[Jim Riggleman]] unfortunately opted to keep many of the same players who had career years in '98 for the '99 season. Perhaps the most notable error was the club's failure to tender a contract offer to third baseman [[Robin Ventura]], whose contract with the White Sox had expired and had expressed a desire to remain in Chicago.  The Cubs, however, decided to give the position to Gaetti and Ventura signed with the Mets.  Although the Cubs started well, at one point reaching nine games over .500, the June-swoon reappeared when they were swept by the crosstown rival White Sox in [[Comiskey Park]], which was the genesis of another epic tailspin, resulting in the club finishing in last place. [[Jim Riggleman]] was fired after the disastrous '99 campaign, his fifth season in Chicago, and a few months later Team President [[Andy MacPhail]] cut ties with Lynch as well, taking the reins as general manager and making [[Jim Hendry]] assistant GM.  MacPhail vowed to lead the team to success in the new century.[[Image:Kerry Wood 2008.jpg|240px|thumb|right|Kerry Wood owns a share of the MLB single-game strikeout record]]\nMcPhail sent Hendry to work quickly, and his first move was trading reliever [[Terry Adams (baseball)|Terry Adams]] to Los Angeles for [[Eric Young (baseball)|Eric Young]] and [[Ismael Valdez]], and hiring [[Don Baylor]] to succeed Riggleman as the Chicago skipper. During a forgettable 2000 season, Hendry also sent pitcher [[Scott Downs]] to Montreal and acquired [[Rondell White]]. This laid the groundwork for the 2001 season, which saw the North Siders make another drive for the playoffs. They made a mid-June trade to acquire All-Star 1B [[Fred McGriff]], though McGriff took over a month debating whether or not to approve the deal and leave his hometown [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], ultimately waiving his no-trade clause and allow himself to be dealt to Chicago on July 27. ''\"The Crime Dog\"'' hit a respectable .282 with 12 homers in 49 games with the Cubs, hitting cleanup behind Sammy Sosa, who had perhaps his best season, hitting 64 homers with career highs in batting average (.328) and RBI (160) for [[Don Baylor]]'s club. [[Jon Lieber]] had a 20 win season, and along with Tapani and Wood made up a solid rotation. The Cubs led the eventual Wild Card winning Cardinals by 2.5 games in early September, but [[Preston Wilson]]'s walk-off homer off of closer [[Tom Gordon|Tom \"Flash\" Gordon]] took the wind out of the team's sails, failing to make another serious charge. The Cubs did manage to finish 88&ndash;74, only 5 games behind both St. Louis and Houston, who tied for first, but followed this up with a disastrous 2002 campaign, after which Baylor was fired and replaced by yet another new manager\n\n===2003-2006: The Dusty Baker years===\n[[Image:Aramis Ramirez on July 19, 2007.jpg|thumb|220px|left|3B Aramis Ram\u00edrez was acquired in 2003 in a lopsided deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates]]\n{{main|2003 Chicago Cubs season|2004 Chicago Cubs season}}\nThe Cubs won their first NL Central crown in 2003. The team's success can be attributed mostly to its dominant starting rotation, which featured [[Mark Prior]], [[Kerry Wood]], [[Carlos Zambrano]], and [[Matt Clement]], all of whom won at least 13 games. The pitching staff as a whole led the National League in Strikeouts with 1,404. At mid-season, the Cubs had overcome Sammy Sosa's corked bat incident, and found themselves in the thick of the pennant race, and were looking for a replacement for [[Bill Mueller]], who was traded near the end of the '02 campaign. Initially, there was talk of a deal for Marlin's 3B [[Mike Lowell]], which came very close to fruition. Eventually, the team hit paydirt after trading [[Mark Bellhorn]] for Jose Hernandez and then trading Hernandez and [[Bobby Hill (baseball)|Bobby Hill]] to the Pirates for [[Aramis Ram\u00edrez]] and center fielder [[Kenny Lofton]] in what has proven to be a lopsided deal in the Cubbies favor.\n\nFinishing up August at 69&ndash;66, the Cubs went on a tear in September, riding Sammy Sosa, [[Mois\u00e9s Alou]], and their new teammates as they started the month by taking four of five games in a crucial series against St. Louis, and winning 19 out of 27 by months end. Prior and Wood both had good seasons, but were especially dominant after June, and were dubbed \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070612075134/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/2003/0707.html Chicago Heat]\" by [[Sports Illustrated]], a name that stuck on with the media. The two fireballers and their mates managed to beat out the charging Astros, clinching the division on September 27 against Pittsburgh, just as they had in 1984. The team charged into the playoffs, knocking off Greg Maddux and Atlanta in 5 games in the [[National League Division Series|NLDS]], the club's first post-season series win since 1908, and moved on to face Lowell and the eventual champion [[Florida Marlins]] in the [[2003 National League Championship Series|NLCS]]. After dropping game one, the Cubs proceeded to take a 3 games to 1 lead and it appeared the North Siders would reach the World Series at last. Marlins pitcher [[Josh Beckett]] shut out the Cubs in Game 5, but most fans thought this a blessing, as with pocket aces Prior and Wood slated to start the next two games, victory seemed all but assured, and the team could \"break the curse\" at home.\n\nGame 6, held on October 14, was a scene unlike anything seen before, as some estimated 200,000 screaming fans battled the chilly weather and packed the streets outside Wrigley Field, and thousands more packed into local bars around the park, in anticipation of witnessing a Cubs World Series berth. The Cubs gave Prior a 3&ndash;0 lead that night. The crowd pumped up with even more adrenalin when the 7th inning stretch was sung by comedian [[Bernie Mac]], who instead of replacing \"home team\" with \"Cubbies\", sang \"Root, root, root for ''The Champs''.\" It was the eighth inning when the now-infamous incident took place in which a fan, [[Steve Bartman incident|Steve Bartman]], attempted to catch a foul ball hit by Florida's [[Luis Castillo (baseball)|Luis Castillo]] that Cub left fielder [[Mois\u00e9s Alou]] was also attempting to catch to record the second out. Alou was enraged and Castillo eventually drew a walk. The play was followed up with a booted ground ball by SS [[Alex S. Gonzalez]], which potentially could have ended the inning via a double play. This apparently rattled the team and opened the door to 8 Florida runs and a Marlin victory. Ironically, Gonzalez led the National League in fielding percentage among all shortstops for the regular season. The next night, the Cubs rebounded to gain a lead twice in Game 7, with [[Kerry Wood]] (who homered in the game) on the mound, but lost a close, back and forth game, sealed by a game winning shot by Marlin slugger [[Derrek Lee]], and the North Siders were once again left on the outside of the World Series looking in.\n\nIn 2004, misfortune struck the North Side again. The team welcomed back prodigal son [[Greg Maddux]] to fill the fourth spot in the rotation behind Wood, Prior, and [[Carlos Zambrano]], giving the Cubs what on paper was considered to be the strongest rotation in the league. In late July, GM [[Jim Hendry]] pulled a blockbuster trade with eventual champion [[Boston]] for [[Nomar Garciaparra]], and the Cubs held the Wild Card lead by a game and a half on September 24, but suffered a late inning comeback from the Mets, and then proceeded to drop 7 of their last 9 games, five of them by one run, relinquishing the lead to the [[Houston Astros]]. The season finale was a meaningless victory over the Braves, a game which team captain Sosa requested to sit out, but was then videotaped by security cameras as he left the ballpark in the second inning. When asked about the event by the media, Sosa denied leaving Wrigley early. Already a controversial figure in the clubhouse, Sammy alienated much of his fan base (and the few team members who still were on good terms with him) with this incident, leaving his place in Cubs' lore possibly tarnished for years to come.[[Image:Chicago cubs celebrate 2004.jpg|thumb|260px|Derrek Lee, Mois\u00e9s Alou and Ram\u00edrez led the Chicago Cubs offense in 2005]]\n\nThough [[Dusty Baker]] had led the team to 89 wins in 2004, a one-game improvement over 2003's near-pennant season, the expectations were loftier and the season was deemed a failure. This time, the fallout was decidedly unlovable. Questions were raised as to Baker's ability to handle the pitching staff, his constant juggling of the Cub lineup, and the vast number of costly injuries. Prior to the 2005 campaign, the Cubs finally managed to trade Sosa to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] for [[Jerry Hairston, Jr.]] and [[Mike Fontenot]]. Months later, Sammy was one of a group of players, (including [[Mark McGwire]]) who were asked to testify during an all-day, nationally televised hearing before the House Government Reform Committee about steroid use in baseball.\n\nHendry pulled yet another shrewd move in the offseason, acquiring 2003 villain [[Derrek Lee]] for [[Hee-seop Choi]], and Lee went on to have his best season, hitting .335 with 46 home runs and 107 RBIs. [[Ryan Dempster]] also had a good season, establishing himself as the team's closer with 33 saves in 35 save opportunities, but the team finished a disappointing fourth place at 79&ndash;83. Many key players that were expected to contribute to the team's success missed extended time due to injury, including Ramirez, Prior, Wood, and Garciaparra. Though many felt Baker had done a great job leading the team to what was nearly a .500 season, most of the media and fan base started to call for Baker's head due to what they saw as nonchalance and a failure to hold his players accountable. The crosstown rival White Sox's victory in the World Series over then-divisional rival Houston that year only rubbed salt in the Cubs fans' wounds.\n\nThe Tribune gave Baker one last chance to turn things around, and Jim Hendry retooled the lineup for the 2006 campaign. During the off-season, the Cubs revamped the outfield, acquiring speedy center fielder [[Juan Pierre]] from the Marlins and inked free agent [[Jacque Jones]] to fill the hole in right. Former blue-chip prospect [[Corey Patterson]], who had shown flashes of brilliance but never the ability to play consistently at a high level, was traded. Additionally, veteran relief pitchers [[Bob Howry]] and [[Scott Eyre]] were brought in to shore up the bullpen. The North Siders came out of the gate hot in 2006, sweeping St. Louis en route to a 14&ndash;9 start, but an injury to superstar Derrek Lee sent the team into another tailspin. In early May, the team set a franchise record for offensive futility by scoring only 13 runs in 11 games. [[Rich Hill (pitcher)|Rich Hill]] came up from [[Iowa Cubs|Iowa]] and showed some flashes of brilliance, and Aramis Ram\u00edrez had another great season, but Pierre, though stealing 52 bases, failed to live up to expectations and Jones lashed out at the Wrigley faithful for booing him after his initial poor play. Though Jones righted his ship by slugging 27 homers, the team was repeatedly unable to score runs for its pitching staff and finished the season at a pathetic 66&ndash;96. As rumors of the club's sale dominated the horizon, [[Andy MacPhail]] resigned his position as team President following the season, and the team opted to let Baker, the former \"Messiah's\" contract expire.\n\n===2007&ndash;2008: Back to back===\n[[Image:Sori.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Alfonso Soriano, who signed the richest deal in franchise history in 2007, toys with fans at the Friendly Confines]]\n{{main|2007 Chicago Cubs season|2008 Chicago Cubs season}}\nAfter finishing the '06 campaign in the NL Central cellar, the Boys in Blue went from worst to first in 2007. First, Chicago hired veteran skipper [[Lou Piniella]] after a managerial search that included hometown favorite [[Joe Girardi]]. Soon afterward, the [[Tribune Company]] was sold, but still allowed several important pre-season moves. The team re-signed Aramis Ram\u00edrez, and instead of waiting for Mark Prior to heal, Hendry signed [[Ted Lilly]] and [[Jason Marquis]] to join the rotation. He also inked free agent infielder [[Mark DeRosa]] and gave [[Alfonso Soriano]] the richest contract in Cubs' history. The team started slowly, however, falling behind Milwaukee by as many as eight games. Zambrano and catcher [[Michael Barrett (baseball)|Michael Barrett]] were involved in a dugout brawl, Piniella was suspended for kicking dirt at an umpire, and the season was in jeopardy by June.\n\nThen things started to change. Barrett was traded away, and the club survived injuries and suspensions, sparked by the play of rookie reliever [[Carlos M\u00e1rmol]], and infielder [[Ryan Theriot]]. The Cubs won 19 games in July, and toward the end of the season staff ace Kerry Wood returned from the disabled list as a reliever. In September, the Northsiders won critical series, kicking off a 10&ndash;2 stretch that featured a pair of dramatic, late-inning wins against the Reds. In what some called the [http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070928&content_id=2235627&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb most exciting] Major League Baseball season ever, the Cubs clinched the Central on September 28.\n\nIn the [[2007 NLDS|NLDS]], they met the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. Carlos Zambrano was dominant in Game 1, but was matched by D-Backs ace [[Brandon Webb]] as the game was tied at one after six. In a move that has since come [http://www.suntimes.com/sports/baseball/cubs/588167,CST-SPT-cub04.article under scrutiny], Piniella called in ace reliever [[Carlos M\u00e1rmol]] to start the seventh, who uncharacteristically gave up two runs. Piniella pulled Zambrano because he was planning on bringing him back on short rest for Game 4. The next night, the Cubs jumped out 2&ndash;0 on a home run by rookie catcher [[Geovany Soto]], but Lilly, who was 9&ndash;1 following Cub losses, was touched for six runs. In the finale at home, the offense again squandered numerous opportunities, stranding 12 runners and falling victim to four double plays en route to another abrupt end to a once promising season.\n\n[[Image:GROUP 2 Bleachers.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Lines can become very long outside Gate N, the entrance to the [[Bud Light]] Bleachers. Lines often start forming as early as 9 a.m. for a 1:20 p.m. first pitch.]]\nJust before [[Christmas]] in 2007, Sam Zell closed the sale of the [[Chicago Tribune|Tribune]] and promised the team would be sold prior to the season (which ultimately didn't happen), leading many to question whether the Cubs would be major players in the free-agent market. Those questions were answered when they inked the much-pursued Japanese superstar [[Kosuke Fukudome]] of the [[Chunichi Dragons]]. Rumors of a 9-player deal with [[Baltimore Orioles|Baltimore]] for [[Brian Roberts (baseball)|Brian Roberts]] fizzled after trade talks that had dragged on from January until after Opening Day. Kerry Wood entered the season as closer and Ryan Dempster returned to the rotation.\n\nThe Cubbies started out hot, taking an early division lead, while recording the 10,000th franchise win in April. [[Reed Johnson]] and later [[Jim Edmonds]] were signed to platoon in center after sending prospect [[F\u00e9lix Pie]] back to [[Iowa Cubs|AAA Iowa]]. One highnote of the season came on May 30, after the Boys in Blue fell behind the Rockies 9&ndash;1, they ultimately surged back, winning 10&ndash;9 and by mid-June Chicago boasted their best record in baseball. Chicago set a team record with eight players being named as all stars with Zambrano, Soriano, Ramirez, Wood and Dempster being joined by first timers Fukudome, Geovany Soto, and late addition Carlos M\u00e1rmol. On July 8, [[Sean Gallagher (baseball)|Sean Gallagher]], who had replaced a struggling Rich Hill as the club's fifth starter, was dealt to [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland]] along with outfielders [[Matt Murton]] and [[Eric Patterson]], as the Cubs netted star pitcher [[Rich Harden]], and Chicago entered the break with an NL best 57 wins and a 4.5 game division lead.\n\nThe club overcame a seven-game losing streak to open September, and Carlos Zambrano pitched the clubs first no-hitter in three decades on September 14, against Houston in Milwaukee. That game was moved to [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] after [[Hurricane Ike]] forced the series to be moved from [[Minute Maid Park]] to the domed field in Wisconsin. The Cubs clinched their second straight N.L. Central crown on September 20 at home against rival St. Louis, clinching home field advantage. Unfortunately, the heavily favored Cubs were swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers, leaving a sour taste in the mouths of Cub Nation, as a potential \"Dream Season\" came to an abrupt end.\n\n==2009-present: The Ricketts family era==\n===New Ownership===\n{{Main|2009 Chicago Cubs season}}\nIn July 2008, [[Dallas Mavericks]] owner and businessman [[Mark Cuban]], bid $1.35 billion to purchase the Cubs and Wrigley Field from Tribune Company, the largest of three final bids. The next highest bids were in the $1.1 billion range and were submitted by the Ricketts family, who own [[TD Ameritrade]], and a group led by former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Vice-presidential candidate [[Jack Kemp]] and Hall of Famer [[Hank Aaron]]. MLB Commissioner [[Bud Selig]] supported a fourth potential buyer, John Canning.\n\nZell's Tribunes Company filed for bankruptcy on December 8, 2008.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=atd6jUj9jZJE&refer=us | work=Bloomberg | title=- Bloomberg}}</ref> This filing however did not alter the Cubs' for-sale situation.  In December, 2008 the club announced that it expected a sale to culminate before spring training, and on January 22, 2009, Cubs.com announced that the group led by the Ricketts had their bid accepted by Zell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090122&content_id=3764850&vkey=news_chc&fext=.jsp&c_id=chc|title=Tribune picks winning bidder for Cubs|work=Chicago Cubs|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nApparently handcuffed by Tribune's bankruptcy and the sale of the club to the Ricketts' family, the Cubs quest for a NL Central 3-peat started with notice that there would be less money invested into contracts than in previous years.  Once again, trade speculation dominated the headlines at the winter meetings, this time surrounding Padres' ace [[Jake Peavy]], which, much like the Brian Roberts talks a year earlier, resulted in nothing.  Piniella blamed the '08 post season failure on the lack of left-handed hitters, and a bevy of high caliber outfielders fit the bill.  Ultimately, the club settled on inking oft-troubled switch hitter [[Milton Bradley (baseball)|Milton Bradley]] over [[Adam Dunn]], [[Ra\u00fal Iba\u00f1ez]], and [[Bobby Abreu]].  The bench and bullpen were overhauled in a bevy of money saving moves, and fan favorites Kerry Wood and Mark DeRosa both left for the [[Cleveland Indians]].  [[Kevin Gregg]] was acquired from the Marlins to replace Wood, and [[Mike Fontenot]] was promoted to replace DeRosa.\n\nLed by the strong play of Derrek Lee, [[Ted Lilly]] and rookie pitcher [[Randy Wells]], the club played well early in the season, but fell on hard times as injuries began to take their toll.  Nearly every key player either struggled or suffered injury and the Northsiders went into the All Star break with a disappointing .500 record.  [[Carlos M\u00e1rmol]] replaced Gregg as closer and the team stayed in the race, but they were distracted by Bradley, whose poor hitting and even poorer attitude became a major issue as the season progressed.  Bradley complained about being heckled, booed and \"hated\" by bleacher fans and expressed his overall unhappiness in Chicago, eventually leading to a season ending suspension.  Despite this, the Boys in Blue engaged St. Louis in a see-saw battle for first place thru July, but the Cardinals played to a torrid 20-6 pace in August, designating their rivals to battle in a five-team Wild Card race, from which they were eliminated in the season's final week.  On the bright side, the Cubs finished the season with their third straight winning record (83-78) for the first time since 1967\u20131972, and looked forward to a new era of ownership under the Ricketts' family.\n\nRich Harden, who spent a large amount of his tenure with the Cubs injured, signed with [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas]] and Bradley was traded for [[Carlos Silva]] before the 2010 season.  Silva and Bradley's replacement, [[Marlon Byrd]], were initially nice surprises for what was largely a forgettable season.  Silva started out 8-0 and he and Byrd were both named to the NL All-Star team, and young prospect [[Starlin Castro]] made his major league debut, hitting a three-run home run in his first major league at-bat.  However, as the team fell out of contention Derek Lee, [[Ryan Theriot]], and Ted Lilly were traded away and skipper [[Lou Piniella]] retired near the end of the season, in which the Cubs finished in 5th place at 75\u201387.  [[Mike Quade]] was named interim manager and the Cubs finished the season nicely, at 25\u201313, which earned Quade the nod as manager for 2011.  However, the 2011 club finished 20 games under .500, despite the acquisitions of slugger [[Carlos Pe\u00f1a]] and pitcher [[Matt Garza]].\n\n===Under new management and the 2016 World Series Champions===\n{{Main|2015 Chicago Cubs season|2016 Chicago Cubs season|2016 World Series}}\n\nWeeks after the season 2011 season came to an end, hope returned to the club in the form of a new club philosophy as owner Tom Ricketts fired GM Jim Hendry and signed [[Theo Epstein]] away from the Boston Red Sox, naming him club President and giving him a five-year contract worth over $18 million.  Epstein, a proponent of [[sabremetrics]] and one of the architects of the 2004 and 2007 World Series championships in Boston, brought along [[Jed Hoyer]] to fill the role of GM and hired [[Dale Sveum]] as manager.  Although the team had a dismal 2012 season, losing 101 games (the worst record since 1966) it was largely expected. The record included a 13-game losing streak in mid-May, the team's longest in 15 years. The youth movement ushered in by Epstein and Hoyer began as longtime fan favorite Kerry Wood retired, followed by [[Ryan Dempster]] and [[Geovany Soto]] being traded to Texas at the All-Star break.  The development of Castro, [[Anthony Rizzo (baseball)|Anthony Rizzo]], [[Darwin Barney]], [[Brett Jackson]] and pitcher [[Jeff Samardzija]] as well as the replenishing of the minor-league system became the primary focus of the season, a philosophy which the new management said would carry over at least through the 2013 season. Manager [[Dale Sveum]] was fired on September 30, 2013.  On November 7, 2013, [[Rick Renteria]] was hired as the manager.\n\n[[File:The Cubs celebrate after winning the 2016 World Series.

They defeated the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the [[2015 National League Wild Card Game|National League Wild Card Game]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[2015 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] en route to the [[2015 National League Championship Series]], where they were eliminated by the [[New York Mets]]. The club entered the 2016 season looking to advance deep into the playoffs again. This time, however, the Cubs won the [[National League Central|NL Central]] with the best record in MLB, 103\u201358. It was the club's first divisional title since 2008. The team's fortunes in the playoffs turned around as well. They defeated the [[San Francisco Giants]] in the [[2016 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[2016 National League Championship Series|National League Championship series]], breaking the Curse of the Billy Goat, and securing the franchise's first National League pennant and World Series appearance since 1945. Once there, they fell to a 3\u20131 deficit in the series, but won games five and six to force a game seven. After ten innings, a rain delay, and a blown 5\u20131 lead, the Cubs finally emerged victorious in game seven, 8\u20137. The Cubs' historic win marked the end of the longest championship drought in American sports history, winning the franchise's third World Series trophy and first in 108 years.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Witz|first1=Billy|title=Cubs End 108-Year Wait for World Series Title, After a Little More Torment|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/03/sports/baseball/chicago-cubs-beat-cleveland-indians-world-series-game-7.html?_r=0|accessdate=5 November 2016|agency=The New York Times|date=3 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===2017\u2013present: Post-Championship years===\n{{Main|2017 Chicago Cubs season|2018 Chicago Cubs season}}\n\nAfter winning their first championship in 108 years, the Cubs was trying to become the first team to repeat as World Series champions since the 1998-2000 Yankees. They struggled all of the first half of the season finishing two games under .500 before all star break. The Cubs bounced back in the second half to finish 22 games over .500 and win the NL Central by six games over the Milwaukee Brewers. In the NLDS the Cubs beat the Nationals in five games advancing to their third straight NLCS. In the NLCS they faced the Dodgers for the second time in a row, this time, the Dodgers eliminated the Cubs in five games to end the Cubs quest to repeat.\n\nDuring the offseason, the Cubs made several free agent signings to improve their pitching rotation and bullpen. They signed starting pitcher Yu Darvish, closer Brandon Morrow, and also Tyler Chatwood and Steve Cishek. The Cubs could not stay healthy during the season, Anthony Rizzo was out for most of April, Kris Bryant was injured multiple times the whole season. Yu Darvish only started eight games due to injuries. Morrow was also injured during the season and did not play at all in September. The Cubs still managed to stay in first place in the division throughout the season. Due to all the injuries for the Cubs the Brewers managed to tie the Cubs with the same record to finish the season. The Brewers defeated the Cubs in a tie-breaker game to win the Central Division and to have the top seed in the National League playoffs. The Cubs then played in the Wild Card game versus the Colorado Rockies, the Cubs lost, it was the Cubs earliest playoff exit in three years.\n\nAt the All-Star Break on July 9, 2019, the Cubs were leading the NL Central by a half-game over the [[Milwaukee Brewers]].<ref>[https://www.mccoveychronicles.com/2019/7/10/20689237/2019-mlb-national-league-central-cubs-cardinals-brewers-reds-pirates The NL Central is an outlier: In a season full of standings separation, the NL Central has none], SBNation, Brady Klopfer, July 10, 2019.</ref> On September 25, 2019, an eighth consecutive loss eliminated the Cubs from any possibility of playing in the 2019 playoffs.\n\n==Retired numbers==\nThe Chicago Cubs retired numbers are commemorated on pinstriped flags flying from the foul poles at Wrigley Field, with the exception of Jackie Robinson, the Brooklyn Dodgers player whose number was retired for all clubs:\n{{retired number list|\n{{retired number|image=Cubs 10 Santo.svg|alt=10|name=[[Ron Santo|Ron<br />Santo]]|pos=3B|date=<br />September 28, 2003}}\n{{retired number|image=Cubs 14 Banks.svg|alt=14|name=[[Ernie Banks|Ernie<br />Banks]]|pos=SS, 1B|date=<br />August 22, 1982}}\n{{retired number|image=Cubs 23 Sandberg.svg|alt=23|name=[[Ryne Sandberg|Ryne<br />Sandberg]]|pos=2B|date=<br />August 28, 2005}}\n{{retired number|image=Cubs 26 Williams.svg|alt=26|name=[[Billy Williams (left fielder)|Billy<br />Williams]]|pos=LF|date=<br />August 13, 1987}}\n{{retired number|image=Cubs 31 Jenkins.svg|alt=31|name=[[Ferguson Jenkins|Ferguson<br />Jenkins]]|pos=P|date=<br />May 3, 2009}}\n{{retired number|image=Cubs 31 Maddux.svg|alt=31|name=[[Greg Maddux|Greg<br />Maddux]]|pos=P|date=<br />May 3, 2009}}\n{{retired number|image=Cubs 42 Robinson.svg|alt=42|name=[[Jackie Robinson|Jackie<br />Robinson]]*|pos=2B|honored=April 15, 1997}}\n}}\nThere is a movement to retire the uniform shirt of [[Gabby Hartnett]].

This would be remembered as his \"''Homer in the Gloamin.''\"  It was ranked by ESPN as the 47th greatest home run of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/greatesthomeruns2.html |title=ESPN.com \u2013 Page2 \u2013 100 Greatest Home Runs of All Time |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07}}</ref>\n\n===Rick Monday and the U.S. flag===\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Rick Monday American Flag.jpg|thumb|right|Veteran [[U.S. Marine|Marine]] Rick Monday grabs a [[American flag|U.S. flag]] from protesters.]] -->On April 25, 1976, at Dodger Stadium, father-and-son protestors ran into the outfield and tried to set fire to a [[American flag|U.S. flag]].

When he came up to bat in the next half-inning, he got a standing ovation from the crowd and the stadium titantron flashed the message, \"RICK MONDAY...

Despite this, the Cardinals scored two runs in the top of the tenth. Sandberg came up again facing Sutter with one man on base, and hit yet another game tying home run, and ''Ryno'' became a household name. The Cubs won what has become known as \"''The Sandberg Game''\" in the 11th inning.\n\n===Most home-runs in a month===\nIn June, 1998 Sammy Sosa exploded into the [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|pursuit of Roger Maris' home run record]]. Sosa had 13 home runs entering the month, representing less than half of Mark McGwire's total. Sosa had his first of four multi-home run games that month on June 1, and went on to break [[Rudy York]]'s record with 20 home runs in the month, a record that still stands. By the end of his historic month, the outfielder's 33 home runs tied him with [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] and left him only four behind McGwire's 37.  Sosa finished with 66 and won the NL MVP Award.\n\n===10,000th win===\n[[File:10,000 Commemoration.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Flag commemorating 10,000 wins]]On April&nbsp;23,&nbsp;2008, against the [[Colorado Rockies]], the Cubs recorded the 10,000th regular-season win in their franchise's history<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores108/108114/MLB798321.htm|work=USA Today|date=April 23, 2008|title=Cubs get 10,000th win|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> dating back to the beginning of the National League in 1876. The Cubs reached the milestone with an overall National League record of 10,000-9,465. Chicago was only the second club in Major League Baseball history to attain this milestone, the first having been the [[San Francisco Giants]] in mid-season 2005. The Cubs, however, hold the mark for victories for a team in a single city. The Chicago club's 77\u201377 record in the National Association (1871, 1874\u20131875) is not included in MLB record keeping. Post-season series are also not included in the totals. To honor the milestone, the Cubs flew an extra white flag displaying \"10,000\" in blue, along with the customary \"W\" flag.\n\n===Tape-measure home runs===\nOn May 11, 2000, [[Glenallen Hill]], facing Brewers starter [[Steve Woodard]], became the first, and thus far only player, to hit a pitched ball onto the roof of a five-story residential building across Waveland Ave, beyond Wrigley Field's left field wall.

The White Sox currently lead the regular season series 49\u201341, winning the last 4 seasons in a row. The BP Crosstown Cup was introduced in 2010 and the White Sox have won the trophy each time. There have been seven series sweeps since interleague play began: four by the Cubs in 1998, 2004, 2007, and 2008, and three by the White Sox in 1999, 2008, and 2012.\n\n===Milwaukee Brewers===\n{{Main|Brewers\u2013Cubs rivalry}}\nThe Brewers-Cubs rivalry is due mostly to the fact that the ballparks are located less than {{convert|85|mi}} apart. However, this rivalry did not begin to grow until {{mlby|1998}}, when the Brewers moved from the [[American League Central]] Division to the NL Central. Until then, the Brewers had a rivalry with the [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]], which had become known as ''The I-94 Series'', as both teams are just a short drive from [[Interstate 94]]. Brewers-Cubs games are consistent sellouts or near-sellouts, as fans of both teams take advantage of the relative proximity of [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] and Wrigley Field. The two stadiums are roughly equidistant for Cubs fans living in north-suburban Chicago; hence, fans in this region take advantage of Miller Park's larger seating and parking capacity, more modern amenities, and the certainty that the game will not be weather-delayed (due to Miller Park's roof) to attend Cubs games in Milwaukee in large numbers, enhancing the rivalry's intensity. Due to the close proximity of the ball park, many Cub fans make the drive to Miller Park which coined the nickname \"Wrigley North\".\n\n===St. Louis Cardinals===\n{{main|Cardinals\u2013Cubs rivalry}}\nThe Cardinals\u2013Cubs rivalry refers to games between the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and the Cubs. The Cubs lead the series 1,137&ndash;1,106 through {{mlby|2016}},<ref name=\"h2hresults\">{{cite web|title=Head-to-Head results for Chicago Orphans and Chicago Cubs vs. St. Louis Cardinals from 1901|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/games/head2head-games.cgi?team1=CHC&team2=STL&from=1901|website=BaseballReference.com|publisher=FOX Sports Engage Network|accessdate=20 November 2016}}</ref> while the Cardinals lead in [[National League]] pennants with 19 against the Cubs' 17. The Cubs have won 11 of those pennants in Major League Baseball's Modern Era (1901\u2013present), while all 19 of the Cardinals' have been won since 1901. The Cardinals also have a clear edge when it comes to [[World Series]] successes, having won 11 championships to the Cubs' 3. The Cardinals have enjoyed an overwhelming advantage over their Chicago rivals in the regular season standings. In the 70 seasons from 1946 through 2016, the Cardinals have finished ahead of the Cubs 53 times. In that same span the Cardinals have had 50 seasons in which their winning percentage was over .500, while the Cubs have finished over that mark 21 times (they finished at an even .500 twice). Cardinals-Cubs games see numerous visiting fans in either St. Louis' [[Busch Stadium]] or Chicago's [[Wrigley Field]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nesn.com/2011/01/cubs-cardinals-must-emulate-yankees-red-sox-to-rekindle-rivalry.html|title=Cubs, Cardinals Must Emulate Yankees, Red Sox to Rekindle Rivalry|date=January 12, 2011|accessdate=February 6, 2011|first=Tony|last=Lee|work=NESN}}</ref> When the National League split into two, and then three divisions, the Cardinals and Cubs remained together. This has added excitement to several pennant races over the years, most recently in 1984, {{mlby|1989}}, {{mlby|2003}}, {{mlby|2004}}, 2015, and 2016; the first three times the division title was won by the Cubs, the fourth by the Cardinals, who went on to win the National League pennant as the Cubs faltered in the second half of the 2004 season. However, 2015 and 2016 were special years for the Cubs. In 2015, the Cubs finished in third place in the NL Central Division behind the Cardinals and Pirates, but they made the playoffs as the second National League Wild Card team. After defeating the Pirates 4\u20130 in the Wild Card game, they disposed of the Cardinals in the NLDS in four games (3-1); however, they later lost to the New York Mets in the NLCS (Mets 4- Cubs 0). In 2016, the tide really turned in a positive direction for the Chicago Cubs. They won the NL Central Division crown with a record of 103-58 which was 17.5 games ahead of the second place Cardinals (86-76). The Cubs then defeated the San Francisco Giants in the NLDS (3-1) followed by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS (4-2) to win the NL pennant for the first time since 1945.  In an epic 2016 World Series, the Cubs ended their 108-year World Series Championship drought by defeating the Cleveland Indians in a thrilling seven game series (4-3).\n\n==Ownership==\n===List of Owners===\n*1876: [[William Hulbert]]\n*1882: [[Albert Spalding]]\n*1902: [[Jim Hart (baseball)|James Hart]]\n*1905: [[Charles Murphy (baseball)|Charles Murphy]]\n*1914: [[Charles Phelps Taft|Charles Taft]]\n*1916: [[Charles Weeghman]]/[[Albert Lasker]] (heads of an investment group with seven others including [[William Wrigley Jr.]])\n*1921: [[Wrigley and Company]] (Wrigley family owned Wrigley Chewing Gum)\n*1981: [[Chicago Tribune|Tribune Company]]\n*2007: [[Sam Zell]]\n*2009: Family trust of [[J.

Ricketts|Tom Ricketts]] (the elder Ricketts is the founder of [[TD Ameritrade]])\n\n===Ownership History===\nAl Spalding, who also owned [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] sporting goods, played for the team for two seasons under club founder William Hulbert. After Hulbert's death Spalding owned the club for 21 years, after which the Cubs were purchased by Albert Lasker and Charles Weeghman. That pair were followed by the Wrigley family, owners of [[The Wrigley Company|Wrigley's]] chewing gum. In 1981, after 6 decades under the Wrigley family, the Cubs were purchased by [[Tribune Company]] for $20.5 million. Tribune, which also owned the ''Chicago Tribune'', ''Los Angeles Times'', ''WGN Television'', ''WGN Radio'' and many other media outlets, controlled the club until December 2007, when [[Sam Zell]] completed his purchase of the entire Tribune organization and announced his intention to sell the baseball team.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=ESPN.com|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=2821964&type=story|title=Prominent names mentioned as possible Cubs' buyers|accessdate=April 2, 2007|date=April 3, 2007|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 Zell began what was basically a competition for a buyer. In late July, a long list was narrowed down to ten, and those ten prospective investors were then narrowed to three, all of whom offered over $1 billion for both the Cubs and Wrigley Field, with the presumptive fan favorites being outspoken [[Dallas Mavericks]] owner [[Mark Cuban]] and a group led by former announcer [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] and Hall-of-Famer [[Hank Aaron]]. However, the list inflated back to five by August as private equity investor and Brewers minority owner [[John Canning, Jr.]] and Tom Ricketts, the son of [[Ameritrade]] founder [[J. Joseph Ricketts|Joe Ricketts]] were added to the \"contest.\" The Canning move was highly scrutinized, because when Zell originally trimmed the candidates down, Canning Jr. had been eliminated, but commissioner [[Bud Selig]] had apparently picked him as a favorite of the fraternity of MLB owners. During a [[Chicago Bulls]]-Dallas Mavericks telecast on October 9, 2008, Cuban, in a courtside interview with Comcast Sports Net, claimed he had made the highest bid, and although he did not know where he stood, noted that the state of the economy would likely affect the time frame of the eventual sale. Nonetheless, on January 8, 2009, the Chicago Tribune reported that a new group of three finalists, [[Thomas S. Ricketts|Tom Ricketts]] advised by [https://web.archive.org/web/20120830014149/http://www.gspcap.com/GSPWeb/OurTeam.jsp?1 Salvatore Galatioto] of [https://web.archive.org/web/20130603004002/http://www.gspcap.com/GSPWeb/Home.jsp?1 Galatioto Sports Partners], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120525132845/http://www.klaffrealty.com/management.cfm?bio=4 Hersch Klaff] advised by [https://web.archive.org/web/20120112025822/http://www.paragoncp.com/partners.php#levy Michael Levy] of [http://www.paragoncp.com/ Paragon Capital Partners],<ref>Chicago Tribune article: \"Working on Cubs Bid ...\" http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-02-03/news/0902020582_1_ricketts-family-real-estate-cubs-bid</ref> and a partnership of [[private equity]] investors Marc Utay and [[Leo Hindery Jr.]], were expected to submit polished offers \"within days\", after which the winning bid would be accepted and, pending the winning bidders approval by \u2154 of the current MLB owners, \"would be final\", with Zell holding on to a minor share of the team.<ref>{{cite news|title='Moving parts' cloud Peavy deal|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=January 8, 2009|page=3|first=Fred|last=Mitchell}}</ref> The Ricketts family won that bidding process as the 2009 season came to a close. Ultimately, the sale was unanimously approved by MLB owners and the Ricketts family took control on October 27, 2009.\n\n==Media==\n===Radio===\nThe Cubs' [[flagship]] [[radio station]] is [[WSCR (AM)|WSCR]] 670 AM. The [[Chicago Cubs Radio Network]] consists of 45 stations and covers at least 11 states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneradio.com/cubsaffilliates.htm|title=WGN Radio - 720 AM|author=|date=|website=WGN Radio - 720 AM|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> \n[[Pat Hughes (sportscaster)|Pat Hughes]], who did play by play for the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] prior to coming to Chicago, hosts the program along with [[Ron Coomer]], a member of the 2001 Cubs, who became Hughes's color man in January 2014.

The show featured Santo as the \"single biggest Cubs fan of all time\", who was known for his emotional highs and lows during games.  One example of a \"low\" was his \"Noooo! Noooo!\" when [[Brant Brown]] dropped a fly ball in a key game in 1998. A \"high\" for Santo was upon the retirement of his number on the last day of the 2003 season, in which he declared his #10 flag to be \"my Hall of Fame.\" Because Santo was a [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetic]] who had lost both his legs to the disease, most sponsors of the radio program centered their promotions around the [[Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation]] and other diabetes-based charities.\n\n===Print===\nThe club also produced its own print media; the Cubs' official magazine, VineLine, which spotlighted players and events involving the club. [http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/chc/fan_forum/vineline.jsp ''Vineline'']. VineLine, which began its run in 1986, had 12 annual issues. After a three decade run, the magazine's last issue was December 2018. VineLine continues to have a presence online with a VineLine Blog and VineLine Twitter. The club also publishes a traditional [[media guide]].\n\n===Television===\n{{Main| List of Chicago Cubs broadcasters}}\nCubs telecasts are locally aired on three different outlets: Over broadcast television via the WGN television outlets (both the [[WGN-TV|local station on Channel 9]] and the [[WGN America|superstation]] nationally, produced through the station's [[WGN Sports]] department), [[Weigel Broadcasting]]'s [[WCIU-TV]] (Channel 26.1) and on [[cable television]] over [[Comcast SportsNet Chicago|CSN Chicago]] (of which the Ricketts family owns a 20% interest), with some games, mainly on Wednesday evenings, airing over the supplemental CSN+ channel. WCIU came into the fold in the early 2000s due to demands by [[The WB Television Network]] for WGN to devote more time to the network's programming, and later on the same has been expected by [[The CW Television Network|The CW]], though WGN still does push back CW primetime programming to accommodate game broadcasts.\n\n[[Len Kasper]] has been the Cubs' television [[play-by-play]] announcer since 2005.  [[Bob Brenly]], a former major league catcher and [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] manager, was the Cubs' [[color commentator]] from 2004 through the 2012 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/team/broadcasters.jsp?c_id=chc |title=Broadcasters &#124; cubs.com: Team |publisher=Chicago.cubs.mlb.com |accessdate=2013-03-27}}</ref>  In October 2012, Brenly announced that he would not return to the Cubs' broadcast booth for another season.  The Cubs did not announce Brenly's replacement until December 5, 2012.  [[Jim Deshaies]] will become the Cubs' color commentator for the 2013\u20132016 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|last=Footer|first=Aylson|title=Deshaies takes position as Cubs' TV color analyst|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121203&content_id=40500590&vkey=news_chc&c_id=chc|website=MLB.com|accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/8517366/bob-brenly-return-chicago-cubs-booth |title=Bob Brenly won't return to Chicago Cubs booth |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2012-10-17 |accessdate=2013-03-27}}</ref>  WGN also produces the games shown on WCIU; for those games, the score bug changes the \"WGN\" logo to \"WGN Sports on The U\" (previously \"CubsNet\").  WCIU games additionally air over [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[WMYS-LD]] (Channel 69) in the [[South Bend, Indiana]] market. WGN and CSN Chicago generally show an even number of Cubs games, while WCIU averages about 8 games per season.\n\nIn 2009, the Chicago Cubs expressed interest in creating their own regional cable network. Crane Kenney, the Cubs' president, said that a regional network owned by the Cubs would create additional revenue streams. The hope was that this would be similar to other successful regional sports networks such as the [[Yes network|YES Network]] and [[NESN]]. The only difference would be that the Cubs could not immediately broadcast Cubs games due to the existing contracts and/or ownership stakes in CSN Chicago, WGN-TV and WCIU-TV. According to Kenney, the new Cubs network would be like the [[MLB Network]], but showing Cubs-only programming. Classic Cubs games from the past could be scheduled as well as in-depth specials. Live telecasts of the minor league affiliate [[Iowa Cubs]] games were also being considered (when there are no Cubs games scheduled or available due to contract agreements).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/sports/Cubs-Could-Have-Own-Television-Network-Soon.html|title=Cubs Could Have Own Television Network Soon|work=NBC Chicago|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref> In the past, [[Wayne Larrivee]], [[Chip Caray]], [[Thom Brennaman]], [[Joe Carter]], and [[Dave Otto]], among others, have announced the team's games on television.\n\n===Jack Brickhouse and Harry Caray===\nTwo broadcasters in particular have made their mark on the team. [[Jack Brickhouse]] manned the Cubs radio and especially the TV booth for parts of five decades, the 34-season span from 1948 to 1981. He covered the games with a level of enthusiasm that often seemed unjustified by the team's poor performance on the field for many of those years. His trademark call ''\"Hey Hey!\"'' always followed a home run. That expression is spelled out in large letters vertically on both foul pole screens at Wrigley Field. \"Whoo-boy!\" and \"Wheeee!\" and \"Oh, brother!\" were among his other pet expressions. When he approached retirement age, he personally recommended his successor.\n\n[[Harry Caray]]'s stamp on the team is perhaps even deeper than that of Brickhouse, although his 17-year tenure, from 1982 to 1997, was half as long. First, Caray had already become a well-known Chicago figure by broadcasting White Sox games for a decade, after having been a St Louis Cardinals icon for 25 years. Caray also had the benefit of being in the booth during the NL East title run in 1984, which was widely seen due to WGN's status as a cable-TV superstation. His trademark call of ''\"Holy Cow!\"'' and his enthusiastic singing of \"''Take me out to the ballgame''\" during the 7th inning stretch (as he had done with the White Sox) made Caray a fan favorite both locally and nationally. Harry occasionally had problems pronouncing names, to comic effect, such as his attempt at saying \"[[H\u00e9ctor Villanueva]]\" which was captured on WGN's memorial CD to Harry. He also continued his long-standing bit (dating back to the Cardinals years) of pronouncing names backwards. Caray had lively discussions with commentator [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]], who was hand-picked by Harry himself, and producer [[Arne Harris]]. Caray often playfully quarreled with Stone over Stone's cigar and why Stone was single, while Stone would counter with poking fun at Harry being \"under the influence.\" Stone disclosed in his book \"''Where's Harry''\" that most of this \"arguing\" was staged, and usually a ploy developed by Harry himself to add flavor to the broadcast. Additionally, Harry once did a commercial for [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], dressed as a \"Blues Brother\" and parodying \"Soul Man\", singing \"I'm a Cub fan, I'm a Bud man\", while dancing with models dressed as Cubs [[ball boy|ball girls]].\n\nThe Cubs still have a \"guest conductor\", usually a celebrity, lead the crowd in singing \"Take me out to the ballgame\" during the 7th inning stretch to honor Caray's memory. The quality of their renditions and ability to sing in tune vary widely. Chicago icons often return annually, such as former [[Chicago Bears]] coach [[Mike Ditka]], who tends to sing the song very fast and worse than awful. Caray is also honored with a statue located at the corner of Sheffield and Addison street. During the 1998 season, a permanent window with Caray's caricature was installed in the Wrigley Field broadcast booth, and a patch with the same caricature along with Brickhouse's trademark ''\"Hey Hey\"'' were worn on the players sleeves to honor the passing of both commentators within a span of a few months. Harry's popularity also led to his grandson [[Chip Caray]] joining the broadcast team in winter of 1997, shortly before Harry's death. Chip Caray worked the Cubs games alongside Stone until events that unfolded in 2004, when Stone became increasingly critical of management and players toward season's end. At one point, reliever [[Kent Mercker]] phoned the booth during a game and told Stone to \"keep out of team business.\" Stone left the team, taking a position with Chicago-based [[WSCR]], and is now an announcer for the south side team, the Chicago White Sox. Chip Caray also left, joining his father [[Skip Caray]] (who would die in 2008) on [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]], providing play-by-play for the [[Atlanta Braves]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{MLBHistory}}\n{{Chicago Cubs}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chicago Cubs Franchise History}}\n[[Category:Chicago Cubs]]\n[[Category:History of Major League Baseball by team]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=May 2013}}\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 150\n\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Chicago Cubs logo 1903 to 1905.png\n| width1    = \n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = Cubs logo, 1903\u201305\n\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Chicago Cubs logo 1906.png\n| width2    = \n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = Cubs logo, 1906\n\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    = Chicago Cubs logo 1907.png\n| width3    = \n| alt3      = \n| caption3  = Cubs logo, 1907\n\n| image4    =\n| caption4  = Cubs logo, 1908\u20131914\n\n| image5    = Chicago Cubs alternate logo 1909 to 1910.png\n| caption5   = Cubs alternate logo, 1909\u20131910\n\n| image6    = Chicago Cubs logo 1919 to 1926.png\n| caption6  = Cubs logo, 1919\u20131926\n\n| image7    = 1920 cub logo.svg\n| caption7  = Cubs logo, 1927\u20131936\n\n| image8    = Chicago Cubs logo 1937 to 1940.png\n| caption8  = Cubs logo, 1937\u20131940\n\n| image9    = Chicago Cubs logo 1941 to 1956.png\n| caption9  = Cubs logo, 1941\u20131956\n\n| image10   = Chicago Cubs logo 1957 to 1978.png\n| caption10 = Cubs logo, 1957\u20131978\n\n| image11   = Chicago Cubs logo.svg\n| caption11 = Cubs logo, 1979\u2013present\n}}\n\nThe following is a [[North American professional sports league organization|franchise]] history of the [[Chicago Cubs]] of [[Major League Baseball]], a charter member of the [[National League]] who started play in the [[National Association of Base Ball Players|National Association]] in [[1870 in baseball|1870]] as the Chicago White Stockings. The '''Chicago National League Ball Club''' is the only franchise to play continuously in the same city since the formation of the National League in [[1876 in baseball|1876]]. They are the earliest formed active [[Major North American professional sports teams|professional sports club]] in North America. In their history, they have also been known as the White Stockings, Orphans, and  Colts.\n\n==Chicago White Stockings/Chicago Colts==\n===1870: The Chicago White Stockings Base Ball Club===\n[[File:1870chicagoclub.jpg|thumb|left|1870 Chicago White Stockings (later Cubs): (l-r) [[Ned Cuthbert]], [[Fred Treacey]], [[Charlie Hodes]], [[Levi Meyerle]], [[Ed Pinkham (baseball)|Ed Pinkham]], [[Jimmy Wood]], [[Bub McAtee]], [[Bill Craver]], [[Marshall King]], [[Clipper Flynn]]]]\nThe success and fame won by the [[Brooklyn Atlantics]], organized baseball's first true dynasty, and the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]] (c. 1867\u20131870) baseball's first openly all-[[Major North American professional sports teams|professional team]], led to a minor explosion of other openly professional clubs by the late 1860s, each with the singular goal of defeating the Red Stockings, who had accumulated an unparalleled 89-game winning streak. It was common at the time for sportswriters to refer to teams by their uniform colors, and it happens that Chicago's club, which was officially known as '''The Chicago Base Ball Club,''' adopted white. On April 29, 1870, the '''Chicago White Stockings''' played their first game against the St. Louis Unions, and soundly defeated the Unions 7-1.<ref>{{cite news|title=Opening of the Base Ball Campaign at St. Louis|work=Chicago Tribune|date=1870-04-30}}</ref> The White Stockings divided their games between their downtown practice field, [[Ogden Park]], and a larger facility set up at [[Dexter Park (Chicago)|Dexter Park]] where they hosted games expected to draw larger crowds.\n\nAfter some individually arranged contests, using mostly the same roster, Chicago managed to put together a 10-man roster and joined the nation's top organized league, which was now allowing entry to professionals. This league, known as the '''[[National Association of Base Ball Players]]''', had been primarily dominated by the Atlantics and until very recently before the admitting of the Red Stockings and the White Stockings, had consisted of mostly baseball clubs from the New York and Washington, D.C. areas. Despite this East Coast dominance, Chicago won the '''NABBP''' championship that year, although the title was disputed by the opposing club, the [[New York Mutuals]].\n\n===1871&ndash;1875: William Hulbert and the National Association===\n[[Image:Cap Anson WSP 19080422.JPG|thumb|left|West Side Grounds served as the club's home for nearly 30 years]]\n{{main|National Association of Professional Base Ball Players}}\nThe following season, the time was right for the formation of the very first all-professional league, and thus the '''[[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]]''' was born, and the White Stockings, financed by businessman [[William Hulbert]], became charter members of the new league. After their experiment with a race track in 1870, the White Stockings returned to the downtown for 1871, a decision that would prove fateful.\n\nThe club arranged with the city to build a ballpark in the northeast corner of the public park then known as Lake Park, later named [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]]. The venue was dubbed the '''[[Union Base-Ball Grounds]],''' and the club was a close contender for the pennant until late in the season. On Sunday, October 8, the [[Great Chicago Fire]] erupted on the near south side and swept northward through the downtown. The wooden ballpark was right in the firestorm's path, and the grounds and all the team's equipment and uniforms were consumed.\n\nDespite that disaster, the White Stockings played their 1871 season to completion, on the road, in borrowed uniforms. They managed to finish second, just 2 games short of the title that was won by Philadelphia. Despite the strong finish, the club was compelled to drop out of the league during the city's recovery period until ultimately being revived in 1874, and moving into the newly built [[23rd Street Grounds]] on the near south side.\n\nAlthough the original Red Stockings had disbanded after 1870, many of the players became members of a new club by the same name, but now based in [[Boston]]. Over the next four seasons, the [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Red Stockings]] dominated the National Association and hoarded the game's best stars, even those under contract with other teams. Hulbert, the White Stockings club president, was disgusted by the lack of enforceable contracts (the most famous of these \"contract jumpers\" or \"revolvers\" was [[Davy Force]]) as well as the monopoly of the Boston club and the league's inability to enforce a mandatory schedule. Gambling and alcohol were also seen as serious problems, with games too often being suspected of being \"thrown\". As a result, Hulbert spearheaded the formation of a new, stronger, more ethical organization. During the last years of the NA, Hulbert worked behind the scenes, to convince the owners of the [[St. Louis Brown Stockings|St. Louis Browns]], [[Hartford Dark Blues]], [[Philadelphia Athletics]], and a few others to join the White Stockings in his new league, which would be known as the [[National League|National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs]]. The National League's formation meant the end of the NA, as its remaining clubs shut down or reverted to amateur or minor status.\n\n===1876&ndash;1900: The National League===\n[[Image:1876 white stockings.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The 1876 White Stockings won the N.L.'s first pennant]]\n{{main|National League}}\nAfter the 1875 season ended, Hulbert was principal in the acquisition of several key players, including Boston pitcher [[Albert Spalding]] and first baseman [[Cap Anson|Adrian Anson]] of the [[Philadelphia Athletics]]. The club continued to play its home games at 23rd Street.\n\nWith the pieces in place, the '''Chicago National League Ball Club''' quickly established themselves as one of the new National League's top teams. Spalding won 47 games that season, and [[Deacon White|James \"Deacon\" White]] and [[Ross Barnes]], also brought in by Hulbert, were major contributors as well, as Barnes hit .429 that season and White, one of the last great bare-handed catchers, led the league in RBI. The White Stockings cruised through the National League's inaugural season of 1876, winning the league's first championship.\n\nNear the end of the season, Mutual of New York and Athletic of Philadelphia, who were remnants of the NA, dropped out of contention and refused to play the remainder of their respective schedules. Hulbert flexed his executive muscle, expelling both franchises from the league.\n\nDespite Hulbert's attempt to make Chicago the overpowering team that Boston had been during the NA years, the next season found Chicago finishing a disappointing 5th in the 6 team league, behind a resurgent Boston entry (another NA carryover) in the 60-game season. In 1878, the club arranged with the city to build a new [[Union Base-Ball Grounds|Lake Park]] ballpark in essentially the same place as the 1871 ballpark. Chicago improved over the next two seasons as the schedules grew to around 75 or more games.\n\nIn 1880 the White Stockings won 67 and lost 17, for an all-time NL record .798 winning percentage.\n\n====Cap Anson and a Chicago dynasty====\n[[Image:Cap anson studio photo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|right|Cap Anson, who played a record 27 straight seasons, was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1939]]\n\nAdrian Anson, the team's best player and perhaps the greatest ballplayer in the early era of professional baseball, became the club's captain, and was so much identified as the face of the club he became better known as [[Cap Anson]]. After the 1876 pennant, which at the time was the game's top prize, Anson led the team to a great amount of success in the early seasons of the National League, winning pennants in 1880 and 1881 as well. The length of the season and long travel times between games at the time was such that most teams got by with two principal starters, and Chicago had two very good ones in [[Larry Corcoran]] and [[Fred Goldsmith (baseball)|Fred Goldsmith]]. Corcoran, who won 43 games in 1880, threw three no-hitters in the early part of the decade, a record that would stand until being broken by [[Sandy Koufax]] in 1965. Goldsmith is one of two pitchers credited with the invention of the [[curveball]]. The two were baseball's first true \"pitching rotation.\"\n\nIn 1882, Hulbert died suddenly, and Al Spalding, who had retired a few years earlier to start [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] sporting goods, assumed ownership of the club, with Anson acting as first baseman and manager. That season was also the first for the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]], the self-proclaimed \"beer and whiskey league\", which began play as a second \"major league.\" The AA offered alcohol and Sunday games, moves which forced the more traditional NL into changes that likely would not have been made had Hulbert lived. Chicago played an (unauthorized) 2-game post-season series against the AA champions, the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. Each team won 1 game and then the series was ended.\n\nThe White Stockings slipped a bit in 1883, finishing 4 games behind Boston. For 1884, the club made a ground rules change at their home ballpark. Its dimensions, especially right field, were very cozy, perhaps less than 200 feet from home plate. Fly balls hit over the right field fence were previously ruled doubles, but in 1884 they were to be ruled as home runs. The batters began aiming for right field, and set some very dubious home run records that would last for decades until the modern \"lively ball\" era began. This change hurt more than it helped, as the club finished 22 games off the pace.\n\nFor 1885, the city reclaimed its lakefront land, and the club went looking for a new home. They found a lot available on the near west side and began building, finally opening \"[[West Side Park|West Side Park I]]\" in June. The White Stockings, despite being vagabonds for their first two months, played strong and won the NL pennant by 2 games over the New York Giants. Meanwhile, the [[St. Louis Browns (NL)|St. Louis Browns]] easily won the first of what would prove to be four consecutive pennants as they dominated the AA.\n\nChicago appeared ready to return to the top in 1885.  The \"Chicago Stone Wall\", the greatest infield of its day, was in place, anchored by Anson and [[Ned Williamson]], who hit 27 home runs in 1884 (25 at home, 2 on the road), a record which would stand until being broken by [[Babe Ruth]] in 1919. [[King Kelly]] was the best catcher in the league and Corcoran was primary pitcher, but [[John Clarkson]], a product of an Anson scouting trip, would lead Chicago to yet another pennant. Much has been written about [[Old Hoss Radbourn]]'s record 60 victories for the [[Providence Grays]] of 1884, but Clarkson won an amazing 53 games in 1885, despite being second to Corcoran in the rotation. Anson considered the '85-'86 teams the best he managed.\n\nDuring this period, Anson became the first ballplayer credited with achieving 3,000 hits. Anson's actual number of hits varies depending on the source. MLB itself recognizes Anson as having over 3,000 hits.  His run producing prowess led the [[Chicago Tribune]] to propose a new stat, [[RBI|runs-batted-in]]. It would take years to [http://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/section/Top-100 become official], but research would reveal that Anson led the N.L. in RBI eight times, still the major league record. Anson's influence on the team is likely greater than that of any other single player's influence on any professional sports team, perhaps only rivaled by what Ruth would eventually become to the [[New York Yankees]] three decades later. Anson's mark was so deep that by the mid-1890s sportswriters had dropped the White Stockings name in favor of the '''Chicago Colts,''' or more commonly, \"Anson's Colts.\"\n\nAnson is also given the credit, or the blame, for setting the stage for the longest-lasting version<ref>The National Association had in 1868 adopted a rule barring any club with a black player from membership.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}</ref> of the \"[[Baseball color line|color line]]\" barring African-Americans from major league baseball.  In an August 10, 1883, exhibition game against the then-independent Toledo Blue Stockings, who would before the next season join the American Association, Anson refused to field his team as long as Toledo's catcher [[Moses Walker]], who was black, was in the lineup; Anson claimed that Walker was ineligible to play, because the rules then in effect permitted only gentlemen to play, and Walker as a black person was incapable of satisfying the definition of a \"gentlem[a]n.\"  The umpires disagreed and threatened both to grant the Blue Stockings a [[Forfeit (baseball)|victory by forfeit]] and to deprive Anson and his team of their share of the day's ticket sales unless Anson and his team took the field.<ref name=\"capanson.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.capanson.com/chapter4.html|title=Capanson.com|author=|date=|website=www.capanson.com|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref>  Anson relented and the game went on with Walker in the Toledo lineup, but in an 1884 game against Toledo, by now affiliated with the AA and playing as the Mudhens, Anson held his line and insisted that the arrangements for the game include a provision excluding black players from both teams' lineups.  By the 1897 season, the leagues adopted an agreement that neither they nor their minor-league affiliates would admit black players,<ref name=\"capanson.com\"/> establishing a racial barrier in professional baseball for the next half-century.\n\nA post-season \"World's Championship Series\" had been held in 1884 between the champions of the League (Providence) and the Association (Metropolitan), and the White Stockings and the Browns arranged to continue that new tradition in 1885. This was the first meeting between Chicago and a St. Louis franchise which would eventually join the NL and become known as the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. The two clubs remain [[Cardinals\u2013Cubs rivalry|perennial rivals]].\n\nThe 1885 Series ended in dispute and with no clear resolution. Both clubs faced each other again in 1886, and this time around there was no question about the outcome, with the Browns winning the Series 4 games to 2.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7154062/review_of_the_year_1886_in_baseball/ \"They Never Lie: Figures in the Case of the League vs. the Association,\"] ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch,'' Oct. 30, 1886, pg. 10.</ref> This marked the only AA win in the 19th Century World Series contests.\n\nThings changed with time for the White Stockings / Colts. Following Chicago's great run during the 1880s, the on-field fortunes of Anson's Colts dwindled during the mid-1890s, despite the emergence of [[Bill Lange]], who set the club record for steals with 84 in 1897, and was one of the league's best hitters for seven seasons. The club would have to await revival under new leadership, however, for in 1898, Spalding opted not to renew Anson's contract, and a year later Lange retired to become a professional scout.\n<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Gold\n  | first = Eddie\n  | authorlink = \n  |author2=Art Ahrens\n  | title = The Golden Era Cubs: 1876-1940\n  | publisher = Bonus Books\n  | year = 1985\n  | location = \n  | pages = \n  | url = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Transition===\nBaseball's popularity in general faded somewhat during the 1890s. In an apparent effort to boost attendance, in 1891 the Colts began splitting their schedule between West Side Park and the recently built [[South Side Park]]. In 1892 they played their entire schedule on the south side, but decided to move more toward the city center again. Early in the 1893 season they opened \"[[West Side Park|West Side Park II]]\", a wooden structure that would be their home for the next 23 seasons.\n\nAnson's departure led to the team's nickname transitioning through the next few seasons. With the loss of their \"Pop\" as Anson had become known, at times the media referred to the club as the '''Remnants''' or the '''Orphans'''. The \"Colts\" name remained in circulation through the 1905 season, along with Orphans and Remnants, depending on which newspaper or fan one spoke to. The name \"Cubs\" first appeared in print in 1902 and gained popularity over the next four years, before becoming the sole nickname in 1906;<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Ahrens\n  | first = Art\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Chicago Cubs: Tinker to Evers to Chance\n  | publisher = Arcadia\n  | year = 2007\n  | location = \n  | pages = \n  | url = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = }}</ref> the Cub-in-the-C logo first appeared on uniforms in 1908 and the name \"Cubs\" the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/detail_page.asp?fileName=nl_1908_chicago.gif&Entryid=124|title=National Baseball Hall of Fame - Dressed to the Nines - Uniform Database|author=|date=|website=exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref>\nThe old name, Chicago White Stockings, was adopted in 1900 by the new [[American League|American Base Ball League]] entry on Chicago's south side, initially as a minor league entry. The AL turned major in 1901, and the south siders' adopted nickname was soon shortened by the press to [[Chicago White Sox]].\n\n==Early MLB years (dead-ball era)==\n===1901&ndash;1913: A new Cubs Dynasty===\nAfter the formation of the American League, Al Spalding gave up ownership of the club to concentrate on touring the country to promote his sporting goods company, selling the team to John Hart in 1902. Oddly, the team Spalding put together before he left was one of his grandest accomplishments.  [[Joe Tinker]] ([[shortstop]]), [[Johnny Evers]] ([[second baseman]]), and [[Frank Chance]] ([[first baseman]]) were three Hall-of-Fame Cubs [[infielder]]s who played together from 1903 to 1912. They, along with third baseman [[Harry Steinfeldt]] and [[catcher]] [[Johnny Kling]], formed the infield on what would become one of the most dominant baseball teams of all time.\n\nBy 1905 the Cubs were owned by Charles Murphy, who purchased the franchise for $125,000. Chance took over as manager for the ailing [[Frank Selee]] in that year, and the Cubs responded by winning four pennants and two World Series titles over a five-year span. Their record of 116 victories (in a 154-game season) in 1906 has not been broken, though it was tied by the [[Seattle Mariners]] in 2001 in a 162-game season. The 1906 Cubs still hold the record for [[List of best MLB season records|best winning percentage]] of the modern era, with a .763 mark. However, they lost the [[1906 World Series]] to their crosstown rival White Sox.\n\nThe Cubs again relied on dominant pitching during this period, featuring hurlers such as [[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai \"Three-Finger\" Brown]], [[Jack Taylor (20th century baseball player)|Jack Taylor]], [[Ed Reulbach]], [[Jack Pfiester]] and [[Orval Overall]]. The Cubs' pitchers posted a record for lowest staff [[earned run average]] that still stands today. Reulbach threw a one-hitter in the 1906 World Series, one of a small handful of twirlers to pitch low-hit games in the post-season. Brown acquired his unique and indelicate nickname from having lost most of his index finger in farm machinery when he was a youngster. This gave him the ability to put a natural extra spin on his pitches, which often frustrated opposing batters.\n\nIn 1907, the Cubs won 107 games, dominating the National League once again. That year they met [[Ty Cobb]] and the [[Detroit Tigers]] in the World Series, beating them soundly, 4-1, for the franchise's first World Series championship. At the time a tie was replayed the next day from the beginning but counted in the series score, so officially the series was not a sweep.\n\nOn September 23, 1908, the Cubs and [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], involved in a tight pennant race, were tied in the bottom of the ninth inning at the [[Polo Grounds]]. The Giants had runners of first and third and two outs when [[Al Bridwell]] hit a single to center field, scoring [[Moose McCormick]] from third with the Giants\u2019 apparent winning run, but the runner on first base, rookie [[Fred Merkle]], went half way to second and then sprinted to the clubhouse after McCormick touched home plate. As fans swarmed the field, Evers retrieved the ball and touched second. Since there were two outs, a forceout was called at second base, ending the inning and the game. The game went down in history as \"[[Merkle's Boner]]\". Because of the tie, the Giants and Cubs ended up tied for first place. The Giants lost the league's first one-game playoff, and the Cubs went on to the World Series, where they defeated the Tigers once again, this time four games to one, for their second consecutive World Series championship. It would be their last World Series victory for 108 years.\n\n====Tinker to Evers to Chance====\nSome experts believe the Cubs could have been in the Series for five straight seasons had Johnny Kling not sat out the entire 1909 season. Kling temporarily retired to play professional [[pocket billiards]], but his primary reason for not playing was most likely a contract dispute. His absence obviously hurt the stability of the pitching staff, as when he returned in 1910 the Cubs won the pennant again, although the veteran club was unable to defeat the young Philadelphia Athletics in the Fall Classic.\n\nDuring that 1910 season, the club's star infielders, Tinkers, Evers, and Chance, gained even more national acclaim after turning a critical [[double play]] against the [[New York Giants]] in a July game. The trio was immortalized in [[Franklin P. Adams]]' poem ''[[Baseball's Sad Lexicon]]'', which first appeared in the July 18, 1910, edition of the ''[[New York Evening Mail]]'':[[File:Chicago Cubs team picture, 1906.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Chicago reached the World Series four times between 1906 and 1910, winning twice.]]\n\n:These are the saddest of possible words:\n:\"Tinker to Evers to Chance.\"\n:Trio of bear cubs, and fleeter than birds,\n:Tinker and Evers and Chance.\n:Ruthlessly pricking our [[gonfalon]] bubble,\n:Making a Giant hit into a double--\n:Words that are heavy with nothing but trouble:\n:\"Tinker to Evers to Chance.\"\n\n\"Gonfalon\" is a poetic way of referring to the [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] that both clubs battled for. The expression \"Tinker to Evers to Chance\" is still used today and means \"well-oiled routine\" or a \"sure thing.\"\n\nTinker and Evers reportedly could not stand each other and rarely spoke off the field. Evers, a high-strung, argumentative man, suffered a nervous breakdown in 1911 and rarely played that year. Chance suffered a near-fatal beaning the same year. The trio played together little after that. In 1913, Chance went to manage the [[New York Yankees]] and Tinker went to Cincinnati to manage the [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds]], and that was the end of one of the most notable infields in baseball. They were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame together in 1946. Tinker and Evers reportedly became amicable in their old age, with the baseball wars far behind them.\n\n===1914&ndash;1924: Lasker, Weeghman, and the double-Bills===\nThe Cubs fell into a lengthy doldrum after the departure of their stars.  In 1916, advertising executive [[Albert Lasker]] and his partner [[Charles Phelps Taft]] obtained a large block of shares and soon acquired majority ownership of the Cubs. In 1916 Taft was bought out by [[Charles Weeghman|Charlie Weeghman]], who had owned the [[Chicago Whales]] of the short-lived [[Federal League]], and was proprietor of a popular chain of lunch counters.[[Image:Max Flack Cubs 1920.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cubs right fielder [[Max Flack]], c. 1920. Note the [[Doublemint]] \"elves\" atop the scoreboard, and the [[Wilson Sporting Goods]] sign on the right field wall.]]\n\nWeeghman and Lasker moved the Cubs to the Whales' old home, [[Weeghman Park]], in 1916.  The club was soon playing competitively again, and won the NL [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] in the war-shortened season of 1918, where they played a part in another team's curse, [[Curse of the Bambino]]. In the [[1918 World Series]], the North Siders, led by pitcher [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]], posted the majors' best record at 84&ndash;45 that year, and faced the [[Boston Red Sox]]. [[Babe Ruth]] won two games in the series, including a 1&ndash;0 complete-game [[shutout]] in the opener to start off what would be a six-game Boston triumph. At the time considered a star pitcher who \"''just happened''\" to hit 29 home runs, Ruth was sold to the Yankees a year later, starting the Red Sox' own tale of futility which lasted for 86 years. The 1918 Series was poorly attended and there were rumblings that it was \"fixed\", but with America's energy focused on World War I, nothing came of these suspicions.\n\nFollowing the 1919 [[Black Sox Scandal]], which led to yet another \"curse\" on the south side of Chicago, baseball in the city fell into very dark times and Lasker worked to create a new governing authority for Major League Baseball that led to Judge [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] becoming the first [[Commissioner of Baseball]]. By then, Weeghman was out of the picture. His lunch counter business fell on hard times after the war, and he was forced to sell more and more stock to Lasker's friend, chewing gum magnate [[William Wrigley, Jr.]] By 1918, Weeghman had sold his remaining stock to Wrigley. In 1921, Wrigley bought Lasker's controlling stake as well.<ref name=\"TBT\">{{cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball |last=Purdy |first=Dennis |year=2006 |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-7611-3943-5 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.laskerfoundation.org/about/albert.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207142152/http://www.laskerfoundation.org/about/albert.html |archive-date=2007-12-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==1925&ndash;1946: Early Wrigley years==\n===Every three years===\nAfter buying the rest of Lasker's shares, Wrigley changed the name of the team's home ballpark to Wrigley Field in 1925 in order to generate more exposure for his brand of chewing gum.  This is one of the earliest examples of corporate sponsorship. Wrigley also acquired the services of astute baseball man [[William Veeck, Sr.]], appointing him as club president. Veeck had been a sportswriter, and had criticized Cubs management. In an unusual move, Wrigley challenged Veeck to see if he could do better. It proved to be a good move.\n\nWith Wrigley's money and Veeck's savvy, the Cubs were soon back in business in the National League, the front office having built a team that would be strong contenders for the next decade. [[Hack Wilson]], [[Gabby Hartnett]], [[Billy Herman]], [[Rogers Hornsby]], and many other stars donned Cub uniforms during that stretch, and they achieved the unusual accomplishment of winning a pennant every three years \u2013 1929, 1932, 1935 and 1938.  Unfortunately, their success did not extend to the post-season, as they fell to their [[American League]] rivals each time, often in humiliating fashion.  One example was in game 4 of the [[1929 World Series]] when the Cubs, leading 8-0 at the time, yielded 10 runs to the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] in the seventh inning. A key play in that inning was center fielder Hack Wilson losing a fly ball in the sun, resulting in a 3-run inside-the-park homer.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:hack-wilson.jpg|thumb|right|150px|right|Hack Wilson hit .356 with 56 HR and 191 RBI in 1930.]] -->\n\nIn the [[1932 World Series]], Babe Ruth again torched the North Siders, though this time with his bat, when he led New York in a series in which he hit his famous \"[[Babe Ruth's called shot|called shot]]\" home run in Chicago during Game 3. The Yankees then went on to a four-game sweep of the Northsiders. There were some historic moments for the Cubs as well, as they won the 1935 pennant in thrilling fashion. Billy Herman hit a career best .341 and led the Cubs to 21 straight wins in September, which propelled the club to the [[1935 World Series]] where they fell to [[Hank Greenberg]]'s [[Detroit Tigers]] in a hard fought, 6 game series.\n\nThe 1938 season saw [[Dizzy Dean]] lead the team's pitching staff and provided an historic moment when they won a crucial, late-season game with a \"walk-off\" home run by player-manager Gabby Hartnett, which became known in baseball [[folklore]] as \"[[The Homer in the Gloamin']].\"  However, Chicago fell to the Yankees again in the [[1938 World Series]]. By this time, the 'double-Bills' had both died, and the front office, now under [[P.K. Wrigley]], was unable to rekindle the success his father had created, and so the team would slip into its first period of mediocrity.\n\n===The Curse===\n{{main|Curse of the Billy Goat}}\nThe Cubs enjoyed one more pennant, at the close of another World War, led by outfielder [[Andy Pafko]] and infielder [[Phil Cavarretta]].  Due to the wartime travel restrictions, the first three games were played in Detroit, where the Cubs won two of them, and the last four were to be played at Wrigley.  The Cubs won Game 1 9-0 and [[Claude Passeau]] tossed a one hitter in Game 3 to give the Northsiders a 2-1 advantage as the series shifted to Wrigley Field.\n\nIn Game 4, the [[Curse of the Billy Goat]] was laid upon the Cubs when [[Philip K. Wrigley]] ejected Billy Sianis, who had come to the game with two box seat tickets, one for him and one for his goat.  They paraded around for a few innings, but ultimately Wrigley demanded the goat leave the park due to complaints about its [[unpleasant odor]].  Upon his ejection, an angry Sianis uttered, ''\"the Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more.\"'', and his family said he then sent a telegram to the Cubs owner saying that they would never win another Pennant or World Series.<ref name=\"Selzer2014\">{{cite book|author=Adam Selzer|title=Chronicles of Old Chicago: Exploring the History and Lore of the Windy City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SPEiBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA156|date=1 July 2014|publisher=Museyon Inc|isbn=978-0-9846334-8-7|page=156}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Avila|first=Michael|title=Are the Chicago Cubs Really Cursed?|url=http://www.livescience.com/32802-are-the-chicago-cubs-really-cursed.html|publisher=[[LiveScience]]|date=September 2, 2010|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}</ref> The Cubs lost game 4, and despite a heroic series by Cavarretta, lost the [[1945 World Series]] in seven games. Although the Cubs occasionally appeared in post-season series since divisional play began in 1969, they did not appear in or win a World Series again until 2016.\n\n==Late Wrigley years (1947&ndash;1981)==\n===1947&ndash;1981: The dark ages===\nAfter the [[Curse of the Billy Goat]], a few years into the post-World War II era, astute observers of the game began to suspect that something had gone wrong with the Cubs franchise, and that it might take them a long time to recover. In his 1950 book ''The World Series and Highlights of Baseball'', LaMont Buchanan wrote the following prose next to photos of Wrigley (apparently taken during the [[1945 World Series]]) and of their newly hired manager: \n\n''\"From the sublime to last place!''\n\n''Wrigley Field, the ivy of its walls still whispering of past greatness, ''\n\n''Watches its Cubs grow less ferocious in '47, '48, '49. ''\n \n''New doctor of the cure is smiling Frank Frisch, ''\n\n''Veteran of previous baseball transfusions who thinks, ''\n\n''It's nice to have the fans with you.' ''\n\n''Chicago has a great baseball tradition. ''\n\n''The fans remember glorious yesterdays as they wait for brighter tomorrows. ''\n\n''And eventually their Cubs will bite again!\"''\n\nLittle did anyone realize how long \"eventually\" would turn out to be. After losing the 1945 World Series, the Cubs finished 82-71, good for third place in 1946, but did not enter post-season play.  The following year, however, the Cubs slumped to 69-85 and sixth place. \n\nThe Cubs would spend most of the next two decades buried deep in the bottom half of the National League. From 1947 to 1966, the Cubs only managed a .500 record twice. Many of those teams lost over 90 games, and in 1962 and 1966 they lost over 100.  All this futility came despite the excellent play of shortstop [[Ernie Banks]], who became known as ''\"Mr. Cub\"''.  Finding help for Banks, however, turned out to be the team's downfall. Players such as [[Hank Sauer]] and [[Ralph Kiner]] found only temporary homes in Chicago during the early 1950s, and [[Phil Cavarretta]]'s numbers tailed off late in his career. Incidentally, Cavarretta, who played 20 seasons for the Cubs and had been player/manager, was fired during spring training of 1954 after admitting the team was unlikely to finish above 5th place (they finished 7th).\n\nOne of Wrigley's attempts to right the ship actually set the team further back.  In December 1960, he announced the Cubs would no longer have a manager.  Instead, an eight-member \"[[College of Coaches]]\" would run the club.  The eight men would rotate all the way through the Cubs organization, so that every player from Class D (equivalent to today's Rookie Leagues) on up would learn a standard system of play.  Each coach would serve as \"head coach\" of the Cubs during his tenure there.\n\nThis approach could be considered visionary in that it anticipated the coaching specialization that has evolved in the modern game. However, this experiment proved to be poorly executed. There was no real pattern to the rotation, and each coach brought a different playing style.  Some talent finally returned to the North Side during this era, in the form of third baseman [[Ron Santo]] and outfielder [[Billy Williams (left fielder)|Billy Williams]] (the 1961 National League [[MLB Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]]). However, without consistent leadership in the dugout, the Cubs remained buried in the second division.  They only had one winning record during the four-year experiment, never finished higher than 7th, and got no closer than 17 games out of first. This stretch also saw some of the worst teams in Cubs history; the 1962 season, for instance, saw the team lose 103 games &ndash; the most in franchise history. There was also a racial factor in the rotation, as [[Buck O'Neil]] was one of the coaches but was never promoted to the \"head coach\" position. Wrigley finally relented and named one person as sole \"head coach\" in 1963, but did not completely scrap the experiment until [[Leo Durocher]] took over in 1966 and emphatically declared himself manager, with Wrigley's support.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the Cubs began showing signs of life, sparked by Banks, Williams, and Santo and the emergence of ace pitcher [[Ferguson Jenkins]]. In 1967 and 1968 the club put together its first back-to-back winning seasons since 1945\u20131946, making fans hopeful for a spectacular 1969 season.\n\n===Fall of 1969===\n{{main|1969 Chicago Cubs season}}\nIn 1969, the Cubs started out 11&ndash;1, building a substantial lead in the newly created [[National League East]]. Chicago surged through the All-Star break, led by the quartet of eventual Hall of Famers in Banks, Williams, Santo and Jenkins.. Jenkins ultimately won 21 games, [[Bill Hands]] was also a 20-game winner, and [[Ken Holtzman]] won 17, which included a no-hitter on August 19. Chicago led the division by {{frac|8|1|2}} games over St. Louis and by {{frac|9|1|2}} games over the [[New York Mets]] in late August, but the Cubs wilted under pressure, losing key games to the Mets, and finished at 92&ndash;70, eight games out of first. Many superstitious fans attribute this collapse to an incident at [[Shea Stadium]] on September 9, when a fan released a [[black cat]] onto the field, thereby further cursing the club. Others have stated the sheer number of day games that the Cubs had to play contributed to the disaster. Chicago, being near [[Lake Michigan]], boasts summers which are quite humid (85&ndash;90&nbsp;\u00b0F on average), and playing in this heat day after day might have taken its toll. From August 14 through the end of the season, the Mets, who played mostly night games, had an amazing 38&ndash;11 record, finishing with 100 wins while the second place Cubs slumped in September, going only 8&ndash;17.\n\n===1970&ndash;1981 \u2013 Bad teams & the June Swoon===\n[[File:Wrigley Field - Cubs vs. Reds 1970.jpg|thumb|255px|The Cubs play at Wrigley Field, May 1970]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cubs69.gif|thumb|200px|left|Chicago Cubs logo from the 1960s and 1970s]] -->\nIn the decade of the 1970s and through the 1983 season, the Cubs rarely tasted few substantial successes. Following the disastrous 1969 campaign, the Cubs fell into mediocrity, finishing slightly over .500 in 1970, 1971 and 1972, while they still had most of the core players from the 1969 team in uniform, including the \"Old Guard\" of Santo and Williams on the field and Jenkins, Holtzman, and [[Milt Pappas]], who tossed a no-hitter in 1972, on the mound. (No Cub would again pitch a no-hitter until Carlos Zambrano on September 15, 2008.) After 1973, however, the bulk of those core players either retired or were traded, and the Cubs sunk to the bottom of the National League East pecking order. Between 1973 and 1983 they were a combined 165 games under .500.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/roster.php?y=1975&t=CHN|title=1975 Chicago Cubs Roster by Baseball Almanac|work=baseball-almanac.com|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref> It was during this entire decade of poor baseball that the term ''\"Loveable Losers\"'' became a catch phrase, since the fans were still coming out to see the team despite the dreadful quality of the on-field product.\n\nPhil Wrigley died in 1977, leaving the team to his son, [[William Wrigley III]].  This year saw the Cubs' best finish in the 1970s, but even this was a testament to the team's futility during the \"Dark Ages\", as all star [[Bobby Murcer]] led the baby blue pinstriped [[1977 Chicago Cubs season|'77 club]] into first place at 47&ndash;22 by June 28, and the team enjoyed an 8\u00bd game lead in the N.L. East. After entering the all star break at 54-35, still an impressive 19 games above .500, the team started to crack as the [[1977 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] picked up steam, cutting the Cubs division lead to only two games. As the summer progressed the Cubs spiraled out of contention, playing poorly in August and ending the season with a streak in which they lost 17 of 22 games, ultimately finishing at 81&ndash;81, a staggering 22 games behind Philadelphia.\n\nAmazingly, the club then had similar, though not as exaggerated, falls in the two subsequent campaigns, despite the acquisition of slugger [[Dave Kingman]]. The Cubs were as many as 11 games over .500 in '78 and peaked at 13 over in '79, but still finished with losing records both seasons. This trait of contending well into the beginning of the summer and then falling in the standings became known as ''\"The June Swoon.\"'' Along with Kingman, Cub rosters in this period featured such players as [[Rick Reuschel]], who won 20 games in the infamous '77 season, as well as [[Bill Madlock]], [[Bill Buckner]], [[Keith Moreland]], [[Jos\u00e9 Cardenal]], and [[Iv\u00e1n DeJes\u00fas]].\n\n==1981-2008: Tribune Company era==\n===1984 and 1989 NL East Champs===\n{{main|1984 Chicago Cubs season|1989 Chicago Cubs season}}\nWilliam Wrigley's mother died within a few months of Phil Wrigley, saddling William with a massive estate tax bill.  With most of his money tied up in either the Wrigley Company or the Cubs, William was forced to put the Cubs up for sale.  In 1981, the [[Chicago Tribune|Tribune Company]] purchased the Cubs from the Wrigley family for $20.5 million\u2014a handsome return on William Wrigley, Jr.'s purchase of a stake in the team 65 years earlier\u2014in the middle of another losing season. In 1982, DeJesus, one of the team's better players, was traded to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] for shortstop [[Larry Bowa]] and infielder [[Ryne Sandberg]].\n\nOn Opening day of 1981 only [http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teams/cubsatte.shtml 10,672] entered the gates. By 1983, thanks to the exposure of the Chicago Tribune and WGN, Rick Reuschel pitched in front of a crowd of 18,268, yet this was all about to change dramatically. In mid-1983, manager [[Lee Elia]] was fired after a profanity-laced tirade against Cub fans and was replaced by [[Charlie Fox]] on an interim basis. In the offseason, the Cubs rebuilt the starting pitching staff through a series of trades by GM [[Dallas Green (baseball)|Dallas Green]], who started by dealing for [[Bobby Dernier]] and [[Gary Matthews|Gary ''\"The Sarge\"'' Matthews]] and inking pitcher [[Scott Sanderson (baseball)|Scott Sanderson]] to complement what was already a good team, boasting players such as third baseman [[Ron Cey]] and catcher [[Jody Davis (baseball)|Jody Davis]]. Green also hired [[Jim Frey]] as their new manager.\n\n====1984 NL East Champs====\nThe Cubs opened up the 1984 season going 12&ndash;8 in April, tied for first place. The race stayed tight through the first half of the season, and Green continued to deal for arms. [[Bill Buckner]] was sent to the [[Boston Red Sox]] for [[Dennis Eckersley]] and [[Mike Brumley (infielder)|Mike Brumley]], and on June 13, [[Mel Hall]] and [[Joe Carter]] were sent to the [[Cleveland Indians]] for starter [[Rick Sutcliffe]]. With the rotation set, the northsiders found themselves 42-34 at the end of June, tied with the Phillies and 1.5 games ahead of the Mets. In a game versus St. Louis, Ryne Sandberg captured the attention of the nation with two game-tying home runs off former Cub [[Bruce Sutter]], and eventually was named NL MVP. The second half of the '84 season was all Cubbies, as the northsiders posted a 54&ndash;31 record, and the city of Chicago was in pandemonium.\n\nThe end result was a league-best 96 victories and the NL East Championship, as the team clinched the division in Pittsburgh. In what was the team's first post-season appearance since the '45 pennant, Chicago met the [[San Diego Padres]]. The Cubs' 96 wins earned them home field advantage for the series. However, Wrigley Field did not yet have lights. CBS television, which broadcast the series, pressured the National League to award San Diego a third home game to allow for an additional prime-time broadcast. In the first game of the NLCS the Cubs won 13&ndash;0 behind two Gary Matthews home runs, and then took a 2&ndash;0 series lead with a 4&ndash;2 win in Game 2. With the City of Chicago in an uproar, the series headed west for the final three games, where the Cubs needed only one win to make it to the World Series. After being soundly beaten in Game 3, they lost Game 4 when All-Star closer [[Lee Smith (baseball)|Lee Smith]] allowed a [[walk-off home run]] to [[Steve Garvey]]. Many fans remember Garvey rounding first after his game-winning shot, pumping his fist into the air, as one of the lowest moments in Cubdom. Game 5 was just as bad; the Cubs took a 3&ndash;0 lead to the 6th inning with Sutcliffe, the 1984 NL Cy Young Award winner, on the mound, but a critical error by first baseman [[Leon Durham]] helped the Padres win the clinching game.  The current era of Wrigley Field being a \"hip\" place to be has its roots in the success of the '84 club.\n\n[[Image:Andre dawson.jpg|thumb|left|Andre Dawson meeting a young fan in 1988.]]\nMost publications picked the Cubs to repeat as Division Champs in 1985, especially after adding [[Dennis Eckersley]] to the rotation. The Cubs responded by starting out 35&ndash;19 by June 11, but swooned again, losing 13 in a row as the club's four top pitchers all hit the disabled list, and the Cardinals took the division crown as the North Siders ended up a disappointing 77&ndash;84. [[Shawon Dunston]], the #1 overall pick in the '82 draft came up from the minors for good near the end of the season.\n\nDuring '86 season, Jim Frey was replaced at skipper with former Yankee [[Gene Michael]], but the team went through two more years of poor baseball. Outfielder [[Andre Dawson]] was signed as a free agent prior to the 1987 season. Dallas Green was initially reluctant to sign Dawson, as they planned to start [[Brian Dayett]] in right, but Dawson proved his worth as he hit 49 round-trippers and took home NL MVP honors for a last place Cub team that season, the only player to accomplish that feat in the last 20 seasons.\n\n[[File:President Reagan throws out the First Pitch at a Chicago Cubs Baseball Game on September 30, 1988.webm|thumb|right|200px|[[President Reagan]] throws out the First Pitch at a Chicago Cubs Baseball Game on September 30, 1988]]\nThe 1988 team, under new skipper [[Don Zimmer]] (who was promoted after Frey took the General Manager position), was the first of a new era in Cub history, as lights were installed at Wrigley Field and were first to be used for a night game on August 8. The game was rained out in the early innings, and the first official night game was the next day, as the Cubs beat the Mets 6&ndash;4. The Mets, however, had a 100 win season, and the Cubs, still anchored by Sutcliffe, \"Ryno\" Sandberg, and \"Hawk\" Dawson, finished in a distant fourth place. This was despite having what at the time was a franchise record six All-Stars as Dawson, Dunston, and Sandberg were joined by [[Vance Law]], [[Greg Maddux]], and [[Rafael Palmeiro]].\n\nIn 1989, the club made some noise as they won the NL East once again, finishing up a 93 win season with a six-game lead over the Mets. Some young faces contributed to the '89 success, with 1B [[Mark Grace]] leading the team in hitting and fellow sophomore [[Damon Berryhill]] providing stability behind the plate for Maddux and the other Cub hurlers. Speedy outfielder [[Dwight Smith (baseball)|Dwight Smith]] finished 2nd in the race for NL Rookie of the Year to fellow Cub outfielder [[Jerome Walton]], who set the current club record hitting streak at 30 games. This time, Chicago met the San Francisco Giants in the [[1989 National League Championship Series|NLCS]]. After splitting the first two games at home, the series headed to the Bay Area. The Cubs were heavy underdogs to the star-loaded Giants, who boasted players such as [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]], [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]], and [[Will Clark]]. Despite an MVP caliber series from Grace, and although the team held a lead in each of the three games, they were unable to overcome bullpen letdowns and managerial blunders. This ultimately led to another early exit from the post season as the Giants eliminated the Cubs in five games (the NLCS had expanded from a best-of-five to a best-of-seven series in [[1985 National League Championship Series|1985]]). The Giants went on to lose to the [[Oakland A's]] in the famous \"[[1989 World Series|Earthquake Series]].\"\n\n===1990&ndash;2002: Ryno, Gracie, and Sammy===\n{{see also|1994&ndash;95 Major League Baseball strike}}\n{{main|1998 Chicago Cubs season|2001 Chicago Cubs season}}\nBetween 1990 and 1997, a time-frame which coincided with the 6 championship dynasty of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Chicago Bulls]], Cubs took a back seat in the headlines and also fell back into the doldrums of mediocrity. Most seasons in this period were basically over by the beginning of June. Despite their promise, Walton and Smith never regained the form they displayed as rookies in '89. Rick Sutcliffe retired and Greg Maddux, who won his first [[Cy Young Award]] in a Cub uniform, left for [[Atlanta]] via [[free-agent|free-agency]], which greatly frustrated the fan base. Their replacements came and went as GM [[Larry Himes]] struggled to find a proper mix. Slugger [[George Bell (outfielder)|George Bell]] was signed in 1991 and after a mediocre season was traded to the White Sox for [[Sammy Sosa]]. Pitchers [[Danny Jackson]], [[Jaime Navarro]], [[Randy Myers]] and [[Mike Morgan (baseball)|Mike Morgan]] brought initial hope to the [[Wrigley Field|''Friendly Confines'']] faithful but ultimately spawned no playoff berths.\n\n[[Image:Shawon Dunston.jpg|thumb|right|Shawon Dunston was a Cub for over a decade and inspired the ''Shawon-O-Meter'', with which fans tracked his batting average]]\nHimes was fired and replaced with [[Ed Lynch (baseball)|Ed Lynch]] in 1995, but the club's much beleaguered farm system was unable to help produce any help on the mound as minor league products such as [[Jim Bullinger]], [[Kevin Foster (baseball)|Kevin Foster]], [[Mike Harkey]], [[Jeff Pico]], and [[Frank Castillo]] were unable to establish themselves in any significant fashion in the post-strike years. [[Steve Trachsel]], a career journeyman, was the only pitcher the system produced during this period that had any longevity. On the offensive side, things were a little better. Although much hyped prospects such as [[Gary Scott (baseball)|Gary Scott]] and [[Drew Hall]] eventually did not pan out, there was some success. Mark Grace, known for his glove and his bat, along with rifle-armed SS Shawon Dunston and reliable catcher Joe Girardi became fan-favorites as Dawson and Sandberg solidified themselves as annual starters in the All-Star game with ''Ryno'' eventually becoming the highest paid player in baseball, retiring and then making a [[Michael Jordan|''Jordanesque'']] comeback.\n\n[[Brian McRae]], [[Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez (baseball)|Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez]] and [[Glenallen Hill]] all found temporary homes in Chicago during the mid-1990s, (Hill is the only player to ever hit a home run to the rooftops across Waveland Ave) and Sammy Sosa started to establish himself as a power hitter, slugging 36 homers three times, but the teams themselves were quite poor. During the seven-year period following the '89 season they had just two winning seasons, an 84&ndash;78 mark in 1993 and a 73&ndash;71 mark in the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened 1995 season]]. In 1997, the team signed lefty Terry Mulholland, but still hit rock bottom, losing their first 14 games to start the season and finishing in last place again with 94 losses. Near the end of the season Dunston was traded to [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pittsburgh]] and Sandberg retired (this time for good) at season's end, so most figured 1998 would be another season of tempered expectations on the Windy City's north side.\n \nThe departure of many fan favorites, combined with what would be the sixth and final championship run of the Bulls as well as the death of popular [[WGN-TV|WGN]] broadcaster [[Harry Caray]] just before the season dominated much of the media coverage, so the Cubs on-field expectations were uncharacteristically out of the headlines heading into the season.  This changed with the signing of left fielder [[Henry Rodr\u00edguez (outfielder)|Henry Rodr\u00edguez]] to complement Grace and Sosa in the lineup and inking closer [[Rod Beck]] and starter [[Kevin Tapani]] to bolster the pitching staff. The team also acquired infielders [[Mickey Morandini|Mickey ''\"The Dandy Little Glove Man\"'' Morandini]] and [[Jeff Blauser]]. With the season dedicated to Caray (whose grandson [[Chip Caray]] took over his duties alongside [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] in the Cub's TV booth) the Cubs found themselves involved in an intense Wild Card race with the Giants and Mets.  The Cubs became media-darlings once again, paced by Sosa's amazing 66 HR, MVP season and [[Kerry Wood]]'s dominating Rookie of the Year pitching, which included an MLB record-tying 20 strikeout game versus the [[Houston Astros]]. On the last day of the season, the Cubs fell 4&ndash;3 to Houston after a throwing error by Mulholland, but the team's playoff hopes were saved when Colorado's [[Neifi P\u00e9rez]] hit a walk-off home run to beat San Francisco later that night, and the Giants and Cubs finished tied for the Wild Card. The teams met in a one-game playoff in Chicago, in which [[Gary Gaetti]], claimed off waivers from St. Louis near the end of the season, hit a game-winning home run. Next up was Atlanta and Greg Maddux, but the North Siders played poorly, scoring only four runs as they were swept in 3 games.\n\nMany credit the Sosa&ndash;McGwire home run chase with \"saving baseball\", by both bringing in new, younger fans and bringing back old fans soured by the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike]]. After the season, GM [[Ed Lynch (baseball)|Ed Lynch]] and manager [[Jim Riggleman]] unfortunately opted to keep many of the same players who had career years in '98 for the '99 season. Perhaps the most notable error was the club's failure to tender a contract offer to third baseman [[Robin Ventura]], whose contract with the White Sox had expired and had expressed a desire to remain in Chicago.  The Cubs, however, decided to give the position to Gaetti and Ventura signed with the Mets.  Although the Cubs started well, at one point reaching nine games over .500, the June-swoon reappeared when they were swept by the crosstown rival White Sox in [[Comiskey Park]], which was the genesis of another epic tailspin, resulting in the club finishing in last place. [[Jim Riggleman]] was fired after the disastrous '99 campaign, his fifth season in Chicago, and a few months later Team President [[Andy MacPhail]] cut ties with Lynch as well, taking the reins as general manager and making [[Jim Hendry]] assistant GM.  MacPhail vowed to lead the team to success in the new century.[[Image:Kerry Wood 2008.jpg|240px|thumb|right|Kerry Wood owns a share of the MLB single-game strikeout record]]\nMcPhail sent Hendry to work quickly, and his first move was trading reliever [[Terry Adams (baseball)|Terry Adams]] to Los Angeles for [[Eric Young (baseball)|Eric Young]] and [[Ismael Valdez]], and hiring [[Don Baylor]] to succeed Riggleman as the Chicago skipper. During a forgettable 2000 season, Hendry also sent pitcher [[Scott Downs]] to Montreal and acquired [[Rondell White]]. This laid the groundwork for the 2001 season, which saw the North Siders make another drive for the playoffs. They made a mid-June trade to acquire All-Star 1B [[Fred McGriff]], though McGriff took over a month debating whether or not to approve the deal and leave his hometown [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], ultimately waiving his no-trade clause and allow himself to be dealt to Chicago on July 27. ''\"The Crime Dog\"'' hit a respectable .282 with 12 homers in 49 games with the Cubs, hitting cleanup behind Sammy Sosa, who had perhaps his best season, hitting 64 homers with career highs in batting average (.328) and RBI (160) for [[Don Baylor]]'s club. [[Jon Lieber]] had a 20 win season, and along with Tapani and Wood made up a solid rotation. The Cubs led the eventual Wild Card winning Cardinals by 2.5 games in early September, but [[Preston Wilson]]'s walk-off homer off of closer [[Tom Gordon|Tom \"Flash\" Gordon]] took the wind out of the team's sails, failing to make another serious charge. The Cubs did manage to finish 88&ndash;74, only 5 games behind both St. Louis and Houston, who tied for first, but followed this up with a disastrous 2002 campaign, after which Baylor was fired and replaced by yet another new manager\n\n===2003-2006: The Dusty Baker years===\n[[Image:Aramis Ramirez on July 19, 2007.jpg|thumb|220px|left|3B Aramis Ram\u00edrez was acquired in 2003 in a lopsided deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates]]\n{{main|2003 Chicago Cubs season|2004 Chicago Cubs season}}\nThe Cubs won their first NL Central crown in 2003. The team's success can be attributed mostly to its dominant starting rotation, which featured [[Mark Prior]], [[Kerry Wood]], [[Carlos Zambrano]], and [[Matt Clement]], all of whom won at least 13 games. The pitching staff as a whole led the National League in Strikeouts with 1,404. At mid-season, the Cubs had overcome Sammy Sosa's corked bat incident, and found themselves in the thick of the pennant race, and were looking for a replacement for [[Bill Mueller]], who was traded near the end of the '02 campaign. Initially, there was talk of a deal for Marlin's 3B [[Mike Lowell]], which came very close to fruition. Eventually, the team hit paydirt after trading [[Mark Bellhorn]] for Jose Hernandez and then trading Hernandez and [[Bobby Hill (baseball)|Bobby Hill]] to the Pirates for [[Aramis Ram\u00edrez]] and center fielder [[Kenny Lofton]] in what has proven to be a lopsided deal in the Cubbies favor.\n\nFinishing up August at 69&ndash;66, the Cubs went on a tear in September, riding Sammy Sosa, [[Mois\u00e9s Alou]], and their new teammates as they started the month by taking four of five games in a crucial series against St. Louis, and winning 19 out of 27 by months end. Prior and Wood both had good seasons, but were especially dominant after June, and were dubbed \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070612075134/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/2003/0707.html Chicago Heat]\" by [[Sports Illustrated]], a name that stuck on with the media. The two fireballers and their mates managed to beat out the charging Astros, clinching the division on September 27 against Pittsburgh, just as they had in 1984. The team charged into the playoffs, knocking off Greg Maddux and Atlanta in 5 games in the [[National League Division Series|NLDS]], the club's first post-season series win since 1908, and moved on to face Lowell and the eventual champion [[Florida Marlins]] in the [[2003 National League Championship Series|NLCS]]. After dropping game one, the Cubs proceeded to take a 3 games to 1 lead and it appeared the North Siders would reach the World Series at last. Marlins pitcher [[Josh Beckett]] shut out the Cubs in Game 5, but most fans thought this a blessing, as with pocket aces Prior and Wood slated to start the next two games, victory seemed all but assured, and the team could \"break the curse\" at home.\n\nGame 6, held on October 14, was a scene unlike anything seen before, as some estimated 200,000 screaming fans battled the chilly weather and packed the streets outside Wrigley Field, and thousands more packed into local bars around the park, in anticipation of witnessing a Cubs World Series berth. The Cubs gave Prior a 3&ndash;0 lead that night. The crowd pumped up with even more adrenalin when the 7th inning stretch was sung by comedian [[Bernie Mac]], who instead of replacing \"home team\" with \"Cubbies\", sang \"Root, root, root for ''The Champs''.\" It was the eighth inning when the now-infamous incident took place in which a fan, [[Steve Bartman incident|Steve Bartman]], attempted to catch a foul ball hit by Florida's [[Luis Castillo (baseball)|Luis Castillo]] that Cub left fielder [[Mois\u00e9s Alou]] was also attempting to catch to record the second out. Alou was enraged and Castillo eventually drew a walk. The play was followed up with a booted ground ball by SS [[Alex S. Gonzalez]], which potentially could have ended the inning via a double play. This apparently rattled the team and opened the door to 8 Florida runs and a Marlin victory. Ironically, Gonzalez led the National League in fielding percentage among all shortstops for the regular season. The next night, the Cubs rebounded to gain a lead twice in Game 7, with [[Kerry Wood]] (who homered in the game) on the mound, but lost a close, back and forth game, sealed by a game winning shot by Marlin slugger [[Derrek Lee]], and the North Siders were once again left on the outside of the World Series looking in.\n\nIn 2004, misfortune struck the North Side again. The team welcomed back prodigal son [[Greg Maddux]] to fill the fourth spot in the rotation behind Wood, Prior, and [[Carlos Zambrano]], giving the Cubs what on paper was considered to be the strongest rotation in the league. In late July, GM [[Jim Hendry]] pulled a blockbuster trade with eventual champion [[Boston]] for [[Nomar Garciaparra]], and the Cubs held the Wild Card lead by a game and a half on September 24, but suffered a late inning comeback from the Mets, and then proceeded to drop 7 of their last 9 games, five of them by one run, relinquishing the lead to the [[Houston Astros]]. The season finale was a meaningless victory over the Braves, a game which team captain Sosa requested to sit out, but was then videotaped by security cameras as he left the ballpark in the second inning. When asked about the event by the media, Sosa denied leaving Wrigley early. Already a controversial figure in the clubhouse, Sammy alienated much of his fan base (and the few team members who still were on good terms with him) with this incident, leaving his place in Cubs' lore possibly tarnished for years to come.[[Image:Chicago cubs celebrate 2004.jpg|thumb|260px|Derrek Lee, Mois\u00e9s Alou and Ram\u00edrez led the Chicago Cubs offense in 2005]]\n\nThough [[Dusty Baker]] had led the team to 89 wins in 2004, a one-game improvement over 2003's near-pennant season, the expectations were loftier and the season was deemed a failure. This time, the fallout was decidedly unlovable. Questions were raised as to Baker's ability to handle the pitching staff, his constant juggling of the Cub lineup, and the vast number of costly injuries. Prior to the 2005 campaign, the Cubs finally managed to trade Sosa to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] for [[Jerry Hairston, Jr.]] and [[Mike Fontenot]]. Months later, Sammy was one of a group of players, (including [[Mark McGwire]]) who were asked to testify during an all-day, nationally televised hearing before the House Government Reform Committee about steroid use in baseball.\n\nHendry pulled yet another shrewd move in the offseason, acquiring 2003 villain [[Derrek Lee]] for [[Hee-seop Choi]], and Lee went on to have his best season, hitting .335 with 46 home runs and 107 RBIs. [[Ryan Dempster]] also had a good season, establishing himself as the team's closer with 33 saves in 35 save opportunities, but the team finished a disappointing fourth place at 79&ndash;83. Many key players that were expected to contribute to the team's success missed extended time due to injury, including Ramirez, Prior, Wood, and Garciaparra. Though many felt Baker had done a great job leading the team to what was nearly a .500 season, most of the media and fan base started to call for Baker's head due to what they saw as nonchalance and a failure to hold his players accountable. The crosstown rival White Sox's victory in the World Series over then-divisional rival Houston that year only rubbed salt in the Cubs fans' wounds.\n\nThe Tribune gave Baker one last chance to turn things around, and Jim Hendry retooled the lineup for the 2006 campaign. During the off-season, the Cubs revamped the outfield, acquiring speedy center fielder [[Juan Pierre]] from the Marlins and inked free agent [[Jacque Jones]] to fill the hole in right. Former blue-chip prospect [[Corey Patterson]], who had shown flashes of brilliance but never the ability to play consistently at a high level, was traded. Additionally, veteran relief pitchers [[Bob Howry]] and [[Scott Eyre]] were brought in to shore up the bullpen. The North Siders came out of the gate hot in 2006, sweeping St. Louis en route to a 14&ndash;9 start, but an injury to superstar Derrek Lee sent the team into another tailspin. In early May, the team set a franchise record for offensive futility by scoring only 13 runs in 11 games. [[Rich Hill (pitcher)|Rich Hill]] came up from [[Iowa Cubs|Iowa]] and showed some flashes of brilliance, and Aramis Ram\u00edrez had another great season, but Pierre, though stealing 52 bases, failed to live up to expectations and Jones lashed out at the Wrigley faithful for booing him after his initial poor play. Though Jones righted his ship by slugging 27 homers, the team was repeatedly unable to score runs for its pitching staff and finished the season at a pathetic 66&ndash;96. As rumors of the club's sale dominated the horizon, [[Andy MacPhail]] resigned his position as team President following the season, and the team opted to let Baker, the former \"Messiah's\" contract expire.\n\n===2007&ndash;2008: Back to back===\n[[Image:Sori.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Alfonso Soriano, who signed the richest deal in franchise history in 2007, toys with fans at the Friendly Confines]]\n{{main|2007 Chicago Cubs season|2008 Chicago Cubs season}}\nAfter finishing the '06 campaign in the NL Central cellar, the Boys in Blue went from worst to first in 2007. First, Chicago hired veteran skipper [[Lou Piniella]] after a managerial search that included hometown favorite [[Joe Girardi]]. Soon afterward, the [[Tribune Company]] was sold, but still allowed several important pre-season moves. The team re-signed Aramis Ram\u00edrez, and instead of waiting for Mark Prior to heal, Hendry signed [[Ted Lilly]] and [[Jason Marquis]] to join the rotation. He also inked free agent infielder [[Mark DeRosa]] and gave [[Alfonso Soriano]] the richest contract in Cubs' history. The team started slowly, however, falling behind Milwaukee by as many as eight games. Zambrano and catcher [[Michael Barrett (baseball)|Michael Barrett]] were involved in a dugout brawl, Piniella was suspended for kicking dirt at an umpire, and the season was in jeopardy by June.\n\nThen things started to change. Barrett was traded away, and the club survived injuries and suspensions, sparked by the play of rookie reliever [[Carlos M\u00e1rmol]], and infielder [[Ryan Theriot]]. The Cubs won 19 games in July, and toward the end of the season staff ace Kerry Wood returned from the disabled list as a reliever. In September, the Northsiders won critical series, kicking off a 10&ndash;2 stretch that featured a pair of dramatic, late-inning wins against the Reds. In what some called the [http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070928&content_id=2235627&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb most exciting] Major League Baseball season ever, the Cubs clinched the Central on September 28.\n\nIn the [[2007 NLDS|NLDS]], they met the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. Carlos Zambrano was dominant in Game 1, but was matched by D-Backs ace [[Brandon Webb]] as the game was tied at one after six. In a move that has since come [http://www.suntimes.com/sports/baseball/cubs/588167,CST-SPT-cub04.article under scrutiny], Piniella called in ace reliever [[Carlos M\u00e1rmol]] to start the seventh, who uncharacteristically gave up two runs. Piniella pulled Zambrano because he was planning on bringing him back on short rest for Game 4. The next night, the Cubs jumped out 2&ndash;0 on a home run by rookie catcher [[Geovany Soto]], but Lilly, who was 9&ndash;1 following Cub losses, was touched for six runs. In the finale at home, the offense again squandered numerous opportunities, stranding 12 runners and falling victim to four double plays en route to another abrupt end to a once promising season.\n\n[[Image:GROUP 2 Bleachers.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Lines can become very long outside Gate N, the entrance to the [[Bud Light]] Bleachers. Lines often start forming as early as 9 a.m. for a 1:20 p.m. first pitch.]]\nJust before [[Christmas]] in 2007, Sam Zell closed the sale of the [[Chicago Tribune|Tribune]] and promised the team would be sold prior to the season (which ultimately didn't happen), leading many to question whether the Cubs would be major players in the free-agent market. Those questions were answered when they inked the much-pursued Japanese superstar [[Kosuke Fukudome]] of the [[Chunichi Dragons]]. Rumors of a 9-player deal with [[Baltimore Orioles|Baltimore]] for [[Brian Roberts (baseball)|Brian Roberts]] fizzled after trade talks that had dragged on from January until after Opening Day. Kerry Wood entered the season as closer and Ryan Dempster returned to the rotation.\n\nThe Cubbies started out hot, taking an early division lead, while recording the 10,000th franchise win in April. [[Reed Johnson]] and later [[Jim Edmonds]] were signed to platoon in center after sending prospect [[F\u00e9lix Pie]] back to [[Iowa Cubs|AAA Iowa]]. One highnote of the season came on May 30, after the Boys in Blue fell behind the Rockies 9&ndash;1, they ultimately surged back, winning 10&ndash;9 and by mid-June Chicago boasted their best record in baseball. Chicago set a team record with eight players being named as all stars with Zambrano, Soriano, Ramirez, Wood and Dempster being joined by first timers Fukudome, Geovany Soto, and late addition Carlos M\u00e1rmol. On July 8, [[Sean Gallagher (baseball)|Sean Gallagher]], who had replaced a struggling Rich Hill as the club's fifth starter, was dealt to [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland]] along with outfielders [[Matt Murton]] and [[Eric Patterson]], as the Cubs netted star pitcher [[Rich Harden]], and Chicago entered the break with an NL best 57 wins and a 4.5 game division lead.\n\nThe club overcame a seven-game losing streak to open September, and Carlos Zambrano pitched the clubs first no-hitter in three decades on September 14, against Houston in Milwaukee. That game was moved to [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] after [[Hurricane Ike]] forced the series to be moved from [[Minute Maid Park]] to the domed field in Wisconsin. The Cubs clinched their second straight N.L. Central crown on September 20 at home against rival St. Louis, clinching home field advantage. Unfortunately, the heavily favored Cubs were swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers, leaving a sour taste in the mouths of Cub Nation, as a potential \"Dream Season\" came to an abrupt end.\n\n==2009-present: The Ricketts family era==\n===New Ownership===\n{{Main|2009 Chicago Cubs season}}\nIn July 2008, [[Dallas Mavericks]] owner and businessman [[Mark Cuban]], bid $1.35 billion to purchase the Cubs and Wrigley Field from Tribune Company, the largest of three final bids. The next highest bids were in the $1.1 billion range and were submitted by the Ricketts family, who own [[TD Ameritrade]], and a group led by former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Vice-presidential candidate [[Jack Kemp]] and Hall of Famer [[Hank Aaron]]. MLB Commissioner [[Bud Selig]] supported a fourth potential buyer, John Canning.\n\nZell's Tribunes Company filed for bankruptcy on December 8, 2008.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=atd6jUj9jZJE&refer=us | work=Bloomberg | title=- Bloomberg}}</ref> This filing however did not alter the Cubs' for-sale situation.  In December, 2008 the club announced that it expected a sale to culminate before spring training, and on January 22, 2009, Cubs.com announced that the group led by the Ricketts had their bid accepted by Zell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090122&content_id=3764850&vkey=news_chc&fext=.jsp&c_id=chc|title=Tribune picks winning bidder for Cubs|work=Chicago Cubs|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nApparently handcuffed by Tribune's bankruptcy and the sale of the club to the Ricketts' family, the Cubs quest for a NL Central 3-peat started with notice that there would be less money invested into contracts than in previous years.  Once again, trade speculation dominated the headlines at the winter meetings, this time surrounding Padres' ace [[Jake Peavy]], which, much like the Brian Roberts talks a year earlier, resulted in nothing.  Piniella blamed the '08 post season failure on the lack of left-handed hitters, and a bevy of high caliber outfielders fit the bill.  Ultimately, the club settled on inking oft-troubled switch hitter [[Milton Bradley (baseball)|Milton Bradley]] over [[Adam Dunn]], [[Ra\u00fal Iba\u00f1ez]], and [[Bobby Abreu]].  The bench and bullpen were overhauled in a bevy of money saving moves, and fan favorites Kerry Wood and Mark DeRosa both left for the [[Cleveland Indians]].  [[Kevin Gregg]] was acquired from the Marlins to replace Wood, and [[Mike Fontenot]] was promoted to replace DeRosa.\n\nLed by the strong play of Derrek Lee, [[Ted Lilly]] and rookie pitcher [[Randy Wells]], the club played well early in the season, but fell on hard times as injuries began to take their toll.  Nearly every key player either struggled or suffered injury and the Northsiders went into the All Star break with a disappointing .500 record.  [[Carlos M\u00e1rmol]] replaced Gregg as closer and the team stayed in the race, but they were distracted by Bradley, whose poor hitting and even poorer attitude became a major issue as the season progressed.  Bradley complained about being heckled, booed and \"hated\" by bleacher fans and expressed his overall unhappiness in Chicago, eventually leading to a season ending suspension.  Despite this, the Boys in Blue engaged St. Louis in a see-saw battle for first place thru July, but the Cardinals played to a torrid 20-6 pace in August, designating their rivals to battle in a five-team Wild Card race, from which they were eliminated in the season's final week.  On the bright side, the Cubs finished the season with their third straight winning record (83-78) for the first time since 1967\u20131972, and looked forward to a new era of ownership under the Ricketts' family.\n\nRich Harden, who spent a large amount of his tenure with the Cubs injured, signed with [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas]] and Bradley was traded for [[Carlos Silva]] before the 2010 season.  Silva and Bradley's replacement, [[Marlon Byrd]], were initially nice surprises for what was largely a forgettable season.  Silva started out 8-0 and he and Byrd were both named to the NL All-Star team, and young prospect [[Starlin Castro]] made his major league debut, hitting a three-run home run in his first major league at-bat.  However, as the team fell out of contention Derek Lee, [[Ryan Theriot]], and Ted Lilly were traded away and skipper [[Lou Piniella]] retired near the end of the season, in which the Cubs finished in 5th place at 75-87.  [[Mike Quade]] was named interim manager and the Cubs finished the season nicely, at 25-13, which earned Quade the nod as manager for 2011.  However, the 2011 club finished 20 games under .500, despite the acquisitions of slugger [[Carlos Pe\u00f1a]] and pitcher [[Matt Garza]].\n\n===Under new management and the 2016 World Series Champions===\n{{Main|2015 Chicago Cubs season|2016 Chicago Cubs season|2016 World Series}}\n\nWeeks after the season 2011 season came to an end, hope returned to the club in the form of a new club philosophy as owner Tom Ricketts fired GM Jim Hendry and signed [[Theo Epstein]] away from the Boston Red Sox, naming him club President and giving him a five-year contract worth over $18 million.  Epstein, a proponent of [[sabremetrics]] and one of the architects of the 2004 and 2007 World Series championships in Boston, brought along [[Jed Hoyer]] to fill the role of GM and hired [[Dale Sveum]] as manager.  Although the team had a dismal 2012 season, losing 101 games (the worst record since 1966) it was largely expected. The record included a 13-game losing streak in mid-May, the team's longest in 15 years. The youth movement ushered in by Epstein and Hoyer began as longtime fan favorite Kerry Wood retired, followed by [[Ryan Dempster]] and [[Geovany Soto]] being traded to Texas at the All-Star break.  The development of Castro, [[Anthony Rizzo (baseball)|Anthony Rizzo]], [[Darwin Barney]], [[Brett Jackson]] and pitcher [[Jeff Samardzija]] as well as the replenishing of the minor-league system became the primary focus of the season, a philosophy which the new management said would carry over at least through the 2013 season. Manager [[Dale Sveum]] was fired on September 30, 2013.  On November 7, 2013, [[Rick Renteria]] was hired as the manager.\n\n[[File:The Cubs celebrate after winning the 2016 World Series.

They defeated the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the [[2015 National League Wild Card Game|National League Wild Card Game]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[2015 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] en route to the [[2015 National League Championship Series]], where they were eliminated by the [[New York Mets]]. The club entered the 2016 season looking to advance deep into the playoffs again. This time, however, the Cubs won the [[National League Central|NL Central]] with the best record in MLB, 103\u201358. It was the club's first divisional title since 2008. The team's fortunes in the playoffs turned around as well. They defeated the [[San Francisco Giants]] in the [[2016 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[2016 National League Championship Series|National League Championship series]], breaking the Curse of the Billy Goat, and securing the franchise's first National League pennant and World Series appearance since 1945. Once there, they fell to a 3\u20131 deficit in the series, but won games five and six to force a game seven. After ten innings, a rain delay, and a blown 5\u20131 lead, the Cubs finally emerged victorious in game seven, 8\u20137. The Cubs' historic win marked the end of the longest championship drought in American sports history, winning the franchise's third World Series trophy and first in 108 years.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Witz|first1=Billy|title=Cubs End 108-Year Wait for World Series Title, After a Little More Torment|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/03/sports/baseball/chicago-cubs-beat-cleveland-indians-world-series-game-7.html?_r=0|accessdate=5 November 2016|agency=The New York Times|date=3 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===2017\u2013present: Post-Championship years===\n{{Main|2017 Chicago Cubs season|2018 Chicago Cubs season}}\n\nAfter winning their first championship in 108 years, the Cubs was trying to become the first team to repeat as World Series champions since the 1998-2000 Yankees. They struggled all of the first half of the season finishing two games under .500 before all star break. The Cubs bounced back in the second half to finish 22 games over .500 and win the NL Central by six games over the Milwaukee Brewers. In the NLDS the Cubs beat the Nationals in five games advancing to their third straight NLCS. In the NLCS they faced the Dodgers for the second time in a row, this time, the Dodgers eliminated the Cubs in five games to end the Cubs quest to repeat.\n\nDuring the offseason, the Cubs made several free agent signings to improve their pitching rotation and bullpen. They signed starting pitcher Yu Darvish, closer Brandon Morrow, and also Tyler Chatwood and Steve Cishek. The Cubs could not stay healthy during the season, Anthony Rizzo was out for most of April, Kris Bryant was injured multiple times the whole season. Yu Darvish only started eight games due to injuries. Morrow was also injured during the season and did not play at all in September. The Cubs still managed to stay in first place in the division throughout the season. Due to all the injuries for the Cubs the Brewers managed to tie the Cubs with the same record to finish the season. The Brewers defeated the Cubs in a tie-breaker game to win the Central Division and to have the top seed in the National League playoffs. The Cubs then played in the Wild Card game versus the Colorado Rockies, the Cubs lost, it was the Cubs earliest playoff exit in three years.\n\nAt the All-Star Break on July 9, 2019, the Cubs were leading the NL Central by a half-game over the [[Milwaukee Brewers]].<ref>[https://www.mccoveychronicles.com/2019/7/10/20689237/2019-mlb-national-league-central-cubs-cardinals-brewers-reds-pirates The NL Central is an outlier: In a season full of standings separation, the NL Central has none], SBNation, Brady Klopfer, July 10, 2019.</ref> On September 25, 2019, an eighth consecutive loss eliminated the Cubs from any possibility of playing in the 2019 playoffs.\n\n==Retired numbers==\nThe Chicago Cubs retired numbers are commemorated on pinstriped flags flying from the foul poles at Wrigley Field, with the exception of Jackie Robinson, the Brooklyn Dodgers player whose number was retired for all clubs:\n{{retired number list|\n{{retired number|image=Cubs 10 Santo.svg|alt=10|name=[[Ron Santo|Ron<br />Santo]]|pos=3B|date=<br />September 28, 2003}}\n{{retired number|image=Cubs 14 Banks.svg|alt=14|name=[[Ernie Banks|Ernie<br />Banks]]|pos=SS, 1B|date=<br />August 22, 1982}}\n{{retired number|image=Cubs 23 Sandberg.svg|alt=23|name=[[Ryne Sandberg|Ryne<br />Sandberg]]|pos=2B|date=<br />August 28, 2005}}\n{{retired number|image=Cubs 26 Williams.svg|alt=26|name=[[Billy Williams (left fielder)|Billy<br />Williams]]|pos=LF|date=<br />August 13, 1987}}\n{{retired number|image=Cubs 31 Jenkins.svg|alt=31|name=[[Ferguson Jenkins|Ferguson<br />Jenkins]]|pos=P|date=<br />May 3, 2009}}\n{{retired number|image=Cubs 31 Maddux.svg|alt=31|name=[[Greg Maddux|Greg<br />Maddux]]|pos=P|date=<br />May 3, 2009}}\n{{retired number|image=Cubs 42 Robinson.svg|alt=42|name=[[Jackie Robinson|Jackie<br />Robinson]]*|pos=2B|honored=April 15, 1997}}\n}}\nThere is a movement to retire the uniform shirt of [[Gabby Hartnett]].

This would be remembered as his \"''Homer in the Gloamin.''\"  It was ranked by ESPN as the 47th greatest home run of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/greatesthomeruns2.html |title=ESPN.com \u2013 Page2 \u2013 100 Greatest Home Runs of All Time |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07}}</ref>\n\n===Rick Monday and the U.S. flag===\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Rick Monday American Flag.jpg|thumb|right|Veteran [[U.S. Marine|Marine]] Rick Monday grabs a [[American flag|U.S. flag]] from protesters.]] -->On April 25, 1976, at Dodger Stadium, father-and-son protestors ran into the outfield and tried to set fire to a [[American flag|U.S. flag]].

Despite this, the Cardinals scored two runs in the top of the tenth. Sandberg came up again facing Sutter with one man on base, and hit yet another game tying home run, and ''Ryno'' became a household name. The Cubs won what has become known as \"''The Sandberg Game''\" in the 11th inning.\n\n===Most home-runs in a month===\nIn June, 1998 Sammy Sosa exploded into the [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|pursuit of Roger Maris' home run record]]. Sosa had 13 home runs entering the month, representing less than half of Mark McGwire's total. Sosa had his first of four multi-home run games that month on June 1, and went on to break [[Rudy York]]'s record with 20 home runs in the month, a record that still stands. By the end of his historic month, the outfielder's 33 home runs tied him with [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] and left him only four behind McGwire's 37.

The Cubs reached the milestone with an overall National League record of 10,000-9,465. Chicago was only the second club in Major League Baseball history to attain this milestone, the first having been the [[San Francisco Giants]] in mid-season 2005. The Cubs, however, hold the mark for victories for a team in a single city. The Chicago club's 77\u201377 record in the National Association (1871, 1874\u20131875) is not included in MLB record keeping. Post-season series are also not included in the totals. To honor the milestone, the Cubs flew an extra white flag displaying \"10,000\" in blue, along with the customary \"W\" flag.\n\n===Tape-measure home runs===\nOn May 11, 2000, [[Glenallen Hill]], facing Brewers starter [[Steve Woodard]], became the first, and thus far only player, to hit a pitched ball onto the roof of a five-story residential building across Waveland Ave, beyond Wrigley Field's left field wall.

The White Sox currently lead the regular season series 49\u201341, winning the last 4 seasons in a row. The BP Crosstown Cup was introduced in 2010 and the White Sox have won the trophy each time. There have been seven series sweeps since interleague play began: four by the Cubs in 1998, 2004, 2007, and 2008, and three by the White Sox in 1999, 2008, and 2012.\n\n===Milwaukee Brewers===\n{{Main|Brewers\u2013Cubs rivalry}}\nThe Brewers-Cubs rivalry is due mostly to the fact that the ballparks are located less than {{convert|85|mi}} apart. However, this rivalry did not begin to grow until {{mlby|1998}}, when the Brewers moved from the [[American League Central]] Division to the NL Central. Until then, the Brewers had a rivalry with the [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]], which had become known as ''The I-94 Series'', as both teams are just a short drive from [[Interstate 94]]. Brewers-Cubs games are consistent sellouts or near-sellouts, as fans of both teams take advantage of the relative proximity of [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] and Wrigley Field. The two stadiums are roughly equidistant for Cubs fans living in north-suburban Chicago; hence, fans in this region take advantage of Miller Park's larger seating and parking capacity, more modern amenities, and the certainty that the game will not be weather-delayed (due to Miller Park's roof) to attend Cubs games in Milwaukee in large numbers, enhancing the rivalry's intensity. Due to the close proximity of the ball park, many Cub fans make the drive to Miller Park which coined the nickname \"Wrigley North\".\n\n===St. Louis Cardinals===\n{{main|Cardinals\u2013Cubs rivalry}}\nThe Cardinals\u2013Cubs rivalry refers to games between the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and the Cubs. The Cubs lead the series 1,137&ndash;1,106 through {{mlby|2016}},<ref name=\"h2hresults\">{{cite web|title=Head-to-Head results for Chicago Orphans and Chicago Cubs vs. St. Louis Cardinals from 1901|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/games/head2head-games.cgi?team1=CHC&team2=STL&from=1901|website=BaseballReference.com|publisher=FOX Sports Engage Network|accessdate=20 November 2016}}</ref> while the Cardinals lead in [[National League]] pennants with 19 against the Cubs' 17. The Cubs have won 11 of those pennants in Major League Baseball's Modern Era (1901\u2013present), while all 19 of the Cardinals' have been won since 1901. The Cardinals also have a clear edge when it comes to [[World Series]] successes, having won 11 championships to the Cubs' 3. The Cardinals have enjoyed an overwhelming advantage over their Chicago rivals in the regular season standings. In the 70 seasons from 1946 through 2016, the Cardinals have finished ahead of the Cubs 53 times. In that same span the Cardinals have had 50 seasons in which their winning percentage was over .500, while the Cubs have finished over that mark 21 times (they finished at an even .500 twice). Cardinals-Cubs games see numerous visiting fans in either St. Louis' [[Busch Stadium]] or Chicago's [[Wrigley Field]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nesn.com/2011/01/cubs-cardinals-must-emulate-yankees-red-sox-to-rekindle-rivalry.html|title=Cubs, Cardinals Must Emulate Yankees, Red Sox to Rekindle Rivalry|date=January 12, 2011|accessdate=February 6, 2011|first=Tony|last=Lee|work=NESN}}</ref> When the National League split into two, and then three divisions, the Cardinals and Cubs remained together. This has added excitement to several pennant races over the years, most recently in 1984, {{mlby|1989}}, {{mlby|2003}}, {{mlby|2004}}, 2015, and 2016; the first three times the division title was won by the Cubs, the fourth by the Cardinals, who went on to win the National League pennant as the Cubs faltered in the second half of the 2004 season. However, 2015 and 2016 were special years for the Cubs. In 2015, the Cubs finished in third place in the NL Central Division behind the Cardinals and Pirates, but they made the playoffs as the second National League Wild Card team. After defeating the Pirates 4-0 in the Wild Card game, they disposed of the Cardinals in the NLDS in four games (3-1); however, they later lost to the New York Mets in the NLCS (Mets 4- Cubs 0). In 2016, the tide really turned in a positive direction for the Chicago Cubs. They won the NL Central Division crown with a record of 103-58 which was 17.5 games ahead of the second place Cardinals (86-76). The Cubs then defeated the San Francisco Giants in the NLDS (3-1) followed by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS (4-2) to win the NL pennant for the first time since 1945.  In an epic 2016 World Series, the Cubs ended their 108-year World Series Championship drought by defeating the Cleveland Indians in a thrilling seven game series (4-3).\n\n==Ownership==\n===List of Owners===\n*1876: [[William Hulbert]]\n*1882: [[Albert Spalding]]\n*1902: [[Jim Hart (baseball)|James Hart]]\n*1905: [[Charles Murphy (baseball)|Charles Murphy]]\n*1914: [[Charles Phelps Taft|Charles Taft]]\n*1916: [[Charles Weeghman]]/[[Albert Lasker]] (heads of an investment group with seven others including [[William Wrigley Jr.]])\n*1921: [[Wrigley and Company]] (Wrigley family owned Wrigley Chewing Gum)\n*1981: [[Chicago Tribune|Tribune Company]]\n*2007: [[Sam Zell]]\n*2009: Family trust of [[J.

Ricketts|Tom Ricketts]] (the elder Ricketts is the founder of [[TD Ameritrade]])\n\n===Ownership History===\nAl Spalding, who also owned [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] sporting goods, played for the team for two seasons under club founder William Hulbert. After Hulbert's death Spalding owned the club for 21 years, after which the Cubs were purchased by Albert Lasker and Charles Weeghman. That pair were followed by the Wrigley family, owners of [[The Wrigley Company|Wrigley's]] chewing gum. In 1981, after 6 decades under the Wrigley family, the Cubs were purchased by [[Tribune Company]] for $20.5 million. Tribune, which also owned the ''Chicago Tribune'', ''Los Angeles Times'', ''WGN Television'', ''WGN Radio'' and many other media outlets, controlled the club until December 2007, when [[Sam Zell]] completed his purchase of the entire Tribune organization and announced his intention to sell the baseball team.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=ESPN.com|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=2821964&type=story|title=Prominent names mentioned as possible Cubs' buyers|accessdate=April 2, 2007|date=April 3, 2007|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 Zell began what was basically a competition for a buyer. In late July, a long list was narrowed down to ten, and those ten prospective investors were then narrowed to three, all of whom offered over $1 billion for both the Cubs and Wrigley Field, with the presumptive fan favorites being outspoken [[Dallas Mavericks]] owner [[Mark Cuban]] and a group led by former announcer [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] and Hall-of-Famer [[Hank Aaron]]. However, the list inflated back to five by August as private equity investor and Brewers minority owner [[John Canning, Jr.]] and Tom Ricketts, the son of [[Ameritrade]] founder [[J. Joseph Ricketts|Joe Ricketts]] were added to the \"contest.\" The Canning move was highly scrutinized, because when Zell originally trimmed the candidates down, Canning Jr. had been eliminated, but commissioner [[Bud Selig]] had apparently picked him as a favorite of the fraternity of MLB owners. During a [[Chicago Bulls]]-Dallas Mavericks telecast on October 9, 2008, Cuban, in a courtside interview with Comcast Sports Net, claimed he had made the highest bid, and although he did not know where he stood, noted that the state of the economy would likely affect the time frame of the eventual sale. Nonetheless, on January 8, 2009, the Chicago Tribune reported that a new group of three finalists, [[Thomas S. Ricketts|Tom Ricketts]] advised by [https://web.archive.org/web/20120830014149/http://www.gspcap.com/GSPWeb/OurTeam.jsp?1 Salvatore Galatioto] of [https://web.archive.org/web/20130603004002/http://www.gspcap.com/GSPWeb/Home.jsp?1 Galatioto Sports Partners], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120525132845/http://www.klaffrealty.com/management.cfm?bio=4 Hersch Klaff] advised by [https://web.archive.org/web/20120112025822/http://www.paragoncp.com/partners.php#levy Michael Levy] of [http://www.paragoncp.com/ Paragon Capital Partners],<ref>Chicago Tribune article: \"Working on Cubs Bid ...\" http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-02-03/news/0902020582_1_ricketts-family-real-estate-cubs-bid</ref> and a partnership of [[private equity]] investors Marc Utay and [[Leo Hindery Jr.]], were expected to submit polished offers \"within days\", after which the winning bid would be accepted and, pending the winning bidders approval by \u2154 of the current MLB owners, \"would be final\", with Zell holding on to a minor share of the team.<ref>{{cite news|title='Moving parts' cloud Peavy deal|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=January 8, 2009|page=3|first=Fred|last=Mitchell}}</ref> The Ricketts family won that bidding process as the 2009 season came to a close. Ultimately, the sale was unanimously approved by MLB owners and the Ricketts family took control on October 27, 2009.\n\n==Media==\n===Radio===\nThe Cubs' [[flagship]] [[radio station]] is [[WSCR (AM)|WSCR]] 670 AM. The [[Chicago Cubs Radio Network]] consists of 45 stations and covers at least 11 states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneradio.com/cubsaffilliates.htm|title=WGN Radio - 720 AM|author=|date=|website=WGN Radio - 720 AM|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> \n[[Pat Hughes (sportscaster)|Pat Hughes]], who did play by play for the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] prior to coming to Chicago, hosts the program along with [[Ron Coomer]], a member of the 2001 Cubs, who became Hughes's color man in January 2014.

The show featured Santo as the \"single biggest Cubs fan of all time\", who was known for his emotional highs and lows during games.  One example of a \"low\" was his \"Noooo! Noooo!\" when [[Brant Brown]] dropped a fly ball in a key game in 1998. A \"high\" for Santo was upon the retirement of his number on the last day of the 2003 season, in which he declared his #10 flag to be \"my Hall of Fame.\" Because Santo was a [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetic]] who had lost both his legs to the disease, most sponsors of the radio program centered their promotions around the [[Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation]] and other diabetes-based charities.\n\n===Print===\nThe club also produced its own print media; the Cubs' official magazine, VineLine, which spotlighted players and events involving the club. [http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/chc/fan_forum/vineline.jsp ''Vineline'']. VineLine, which began its run in 1986, had 12 annual issues. After a three decade run, the magazine's last issue was December 2018. VineLine continues to have a presence online with a VineLine Blog and VineLine Twitter. The club also publishes a traditional [[media guide]].\n\n===Television===\n{{Main| List of Chicago Cubs broadcasters}}\nCubs telecasts are locally aired on three different outlets: Over broadcast television via the WGN television outlets (both the [[WGN-TV|local station on Channel 9]] and the [[WGN America|superstation]] nationally, produced through the station's [[WGN Sports]] department), [[Weigel Broadcasting]]'s [[WCIU-TV]] (Channel 26.1) and on [[cable television]] over [[Comcast SportsNet Chicago|CSN Chicago]] (of which the Ricketts family owns a 20% interest), with some games, mainly on Wednesday evenings, airing over the supplemental CSN+ channel. WCIU came into the fold in the early 2000s due to demands by [[The WB Television Network]] for WGN to devote more time to the network's programming, and later on the same has been expected by [[The CW Television Network|The CW]], though WGN still does push back CW primetime programming to accommodate game broadcasts.\n\n[[Len Kasper]] has been the Cubs' television [[play-by-play]] announcer since 2005.  [[Bob Brenly]], a former major league catcher and [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] manager, was the Cubs' [[color commentator]] from 2004 through the 2012 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/team/broadcasters.jsp?c_id=chc |title=Broadcasters &#124; cubs.com: Team |publisher=Chicago.cubs.mlb.com |accessdate=2013-03-27}}</ref>  In October 2012, Brenly announced that he would not return to the Cubs' broadcast booth for another season.  The Cubs did not announce Brenly's replacement until December 5, 2012.  [[Jim Deshaies]] will become the Cubs' color commentator for the 2013\u20132016 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|last=Footer|first=Aylson|title=Deshaies takes position as Cubs' TV color analyst|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121203&content_id=40500590&vkey=news_chc&c_id=chc|website=MLB.com|accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/8517366/bob-brenly-return-chicago-cubs-booth |title=Bob Brenly won't return to Chicago Cubs booth |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2012-10-17 |accessdate=2013-03-27}}</ref>  WGN also produces the games shown on WCIU; for those games, the score bug changes the \"WGN\" logo to \"WGN Sports on The U\" (previously \"CubsNet\").  WCIU games additionally air over [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[WMYS-LD]] (Channel 69) in the [[South Bend, Indiana]] market. WGN and CSN Chicago generally show an even number of Cubs games, while WCIU averages about 8 games per season.\n\nIn 2009, the Chicago Cubs expressed interest in creating their own regional cable network. Crane Kenney, the Cubs' president, said that a regional network owned by the Cubs would create additional revenue streams. The hope was that this would be similar to other successful regional sports networks such as the [[Yes network|YES Network]] and [[NESN]]. The only difference would be that the Cubs could not immediately broadcast Cubs games due to the existing contracts and/or ownership stakes in CSN Chicago, WGN-TV and WCIU-TV. According to Kenney, the new Cubs network would be like the [[MLB Network]], but showing Cubs-only programming. Classic Cubs games from the past could be scheduled as well as in-depth specials. Live telecasts of the minor league affiliate [[Iowa Cubs]] games were also being considered (when there are no Cubs games scheduled or available due to contract agreements).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/sports/Cubs-Could-Have-Own-Television-Network-Soon.html|title=Cubs Could Have Own Television Network Soon|work=NBC Chicago|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref> In the past, [[Wayne Larrivee]], [[Chip Caray]], [[Thom Brennaman]], [[Joe Carter]], and [[Dave Otto]], among others, have announced the team's games on television.\n\n===Jack Brickhouse and Harry Caray===\nTwo broadcasters in particular have made their mark on the team. [[Jack Brickhouse]] manned the Cubs radio and especially the TV booth for parts of five decades, the 34-season span from 1948 to 1981. He covered the games with a level of enthusiasm that often seemed unjustified by the team's poor performance on the field for many of those years. His trademark call ''\"Hey Hey!\"'' always followed a home run. That expression is spelled out in large letters vertically on both foul pole screens at Wrigley Field. \"Whoo-boy!\" and \"Wheeee!\" and \"Oh, brother!\" were among his other pet expressions. When he approached retirement age, he personally recommended his successor.\n\n[[Harry Caray]]'s stamp on the team is perhaps even deeper than that of Brickhouse, although his 17-year tenure, from 1982 to 1997, was half as long. First, Caray had already become a well-known Chicago figure by broadcasting White Sox games for a decade, after having been a St Louis Cardinals icon for 25 years. Caray also had the benefit of being in the booth during the NL East title run in 1984, which was widely seen due to WGN's status as a cable-TV superstation. His trademark call of ''\"Holy Cow!\"'' and his enthusiastic singing of \"''Take me out to the ballgame''\" during the 7th inning stretch (as he had done with the White Sox) made Caray a fan favorite both locally and nationally. Harry occasionally had problems pronouncing names, to comic effect, such as his attempt at saying \"[[H\u00e9ctor Villanueva]]\" which was captured on WGN's memorial CD to Harry. He also continued his long-standing bit (dating back to the Cardinals years) of pronouncing names backwards. Caray had lively discussions with commentator [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]], who was hand-picked by Harry himself, and producer [[Arne Harris]]. Caray often playfully quarreled with Stone over Stone's cigar and why Stone was single, while Stone would counter with poking fun at Harry being \"under the influence.\" Stone disclosed in his book \"''Where's Harry''\" that most of this \"arguing\" was staged, and usually a ploy developed by Harry himself to add flavor to the broadcast. Additionally, Harry once did a commercial for [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], dressed as a \"Blues Brother\" and parodying \"Soul Man\", singing \"I'm a Cub fan, I'm a Bud man\", while dancing with models dressed as Cubs [[ball boy|ball girls]].\n\nThe Cubs still have a \"guest conductor\", usually a celebrity, lead the crowd in singing \"Take me out to the ballgame\" during the 7th inning stretch to honor Caray's memory. The quality of their renditions and ability to sing in tune vary widely. Chicago icons often return annually, such as former [[Chicago Bears]] coach [[Mike Ditka]], who tends to sing the song very fast and worse than awful. Caray is also honored with a statue located at the corner of Sheffield and Addison street. During the 1998 season, a permanent window with Caray's caricature was installed in the Wrigley Field broadcast booth, and a patch with the same caricature along with Brickhouse's trademark ''\"Hey Hey\"'' were worn on the players sleeves to honor the passing of both commentators within a span of a few months. Harry's popularity also led to his grandson [[Chip Caray]] joining the broadcast team in winter of 1997, shortly before Harry's death. Chip Caray worked the Cubs games alongside Stone until events that unfolded in 2004, when Stone became increasingly critical of management and players toward season's end. At one point, reliever [[Kent Mercker]] phoned the booth during a game and told Stone to \"keep out of team business.\" Stone left the team, taking a position with Chicago-based [[WSCR]], and is now an announcer for the south side team, the Chicago White Sox.

{"title_page": "Complexity class", "text_new": "[[Image:Complexity subsets pspace.svg|thumb|right|A representation of the relation among several important complexity classes]]\nIn [[computational complexity theory]], a '''complexity class''' is a set of [[Computational problem|problems]] of related resource-based complexity. A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\n===Time-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n\n! Model of computation\n! Time constraint ''f''(''n'')\n! Time constraint poly(''n'')\n! Time constraint 2<sup>poly(''n'')</sup>\n|-\n| Deterministic Turing machine\n| '''[[DTIME]]'''\n| '''[[P (complexity)|P]]'''\n| '''[[EXPTIME]]'''\n|-\n| Non-deterministic Turing machine\n| '''[[NTIME]]'''\n| '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]'''\n| '''[[NEXPTIME]]'''\n|}\n\n===Space-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In particular,\n* The classes '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''', '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''', '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''', and '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' are defined using the [[probabilistic Turing machine]]\n* The classes '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' and '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' are defined using the [[interactive proof system]]\n* The class '''[[P/poly]]''' and its subclasses '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]''' are defined using the [[boolean circuit]]\n* The classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''' are defined using the [[quantum Turing machine]]\n\nThese are explained in greater detail below.\n\n====Randomized computation====\n{{Main|Probabilistic Turing machine}}\n\nA number of important complexity classes are defined using the ''[[probabilistic Turing machine]]'', a variant of the [[Turing machine]] that can toss random coins. These classes help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of error that is allowed. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\n[[File:Randomized Complexity Classes.svg|thumb|The relationships between the fundamental probabilistic complexity classes. BQP is a quantum complexity class and is described in the quantum computing section.]]\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability 0. Intuitively, this is the strictest class of probabilistic problems because it demands ''no error whatsoever''. A slightly looser class is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), which maintains no error for strings not in the language but allows bounded error for strings in the language. More formally, a language is in '''RP''' if there is a probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine <math>M</math> such that if a string is not in the language then <math>M</math> always rejects and if a string is in the language then <math>M</math> accepts with a probability at least 1/2. The class '''co-RP''' is similarly defined except the roles are flipped: error is not allowed for strings in the language but is allowed for strings not in the language. Taken together, the classes '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' encompass all of the problems that can be solved by probabilistic Turing machines with [[one-sided error]]. Loosening the error requirements further to allow for [[two-sided error]] yields the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability less than 1/3 (for both strings in the language and not in the language). '''BPP''' is the most practically relevant of the probabilistic complexity classes\u2014most problems of interest in '''BPP''' have efficient probabilistic algorithms that can be run quickly on real computers. '''BPP''' is also at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown. The broadest class of efficiently-solvable probabilistic problems is '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''' (probabilistic polynomial time), the set of languages solvable by a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time with an error probability of less than 1/2 for all strings.\n\n'''ZPP''', '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' are all subsets of '''BPP'''. The reason for this is intuitive: the classes allowing zero error and only one-sided error are all contained within the class that allows for two-sided error. '''BPP''' is a subset of '''PP'''. '''ZPP''' relates to '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' in the following way: '''ZPP'''<math>=</math>'''RP'''<math>\\cap</math>'''co-RP''', that is, '''ZPP''' consists exactly of those problems that are in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP'''. Intuitively, this follows from the fact that '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' allow only one-sided error. A problem in '''RP''' allows error only for strings in the language. But a problem in '''co-RP''' allows error only for strings not in the language, i.e. it disallows error for strings in the language. Hence, if a problem is in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP''', then there must be no error for strings in the language. A similar argument shows that no error is allowed for strings not in the language if the language is in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP'''. Together, this means that no error is allowed whatsoever, which is exactly the definition of '''ZPP'''.\n\n====Interactive  proof systems====\n{{Main|Interactive proof system}}\nA number of complexity classes are defined using ''interactive proof systems''. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and yield insights into [[cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm]]s, and [[formal verification]].\n\n[[File:Interactive proof (complexity).svg|thumb|300px|General representation of an interactive proof protocol.]]\nInteractive proof systems are [[abstract machine]]s that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover <math>P</math> and a verifier <math>V</math>. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover <math>P</math> has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover determine if a string is in a language and then sending a trustworthy \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an \"interrogation\" of the prover by \"asking it\" successive rounds of questions, accepting only if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4|page=144|quote=\"The verifier conducts an interrogation of the prover, repeatedly asking questions and listening to the prover's responses.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic, polynomial-time machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full [[Certificate (complexity)|proof]] to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class '''NP'''\u2014the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is \"YES\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine\u2014is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by the prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. \n\nIt turns out that '''NP''' describes the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because, for any proof systems with deterministic verifiers, it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require ''probabilistic verifiers'', which means that the verifiers' questions to provers are computed using [[probabilistic algorithm]]s. As noted in the section above, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of the error probability. \n\nThe most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system <math>(P,V)</math>, where <math>V</math> is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language <math>L \\in </math> '''IP'''\n# (Completeness) a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>\n# (Soundness) a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\le \\tfrac{1}{3}</math>\n\nAn important feature of '''IP''' is that it equals '''[[PSPACE]]'''.\n\nA modification of the protocol for '''IP''' produces another important complexity class: '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' (Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by '''IP''', the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation\u2014it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called ''private random coins''. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are ''public random coins'', that is the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, '''AM''' is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. '''AM''' can be generalized to '''AM'''[k], where k is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard '''AM''' defined above is '''AM'''[2]). However, it is the case that for all k<math>\\geq</math>2, '''AM'''[k]='''AM'''[2]. It is also the case that '''AM'''[k]<math>\\subseteq</math>'''IP'''[k].\n\nOther complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include '''[[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]]''' (mutliprover interactive polynomial time) and '''[[QIP (complexity)|QIP]]''' (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\n====Boolean circuits====\n{{Main|Circuit complexity}}\nAn alternative model of computation to the [[Turing machine]] is the ''[[Boolean circuit]]'', a simplified model of the [[digital circuit]]s used in modern [[computer]]s. Not only does this model provide a more intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for [[non-uniform computation]] (different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms) that leads to a number of new complexity classes.\n\nFormally, a Boolean circuit <math>C</math> is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which edges represent ''wires'' (which carry the [[bit]] values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by ''source vertices'' (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent ''[[logic gate]]s'' (generally the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate]]s). One logic gate is designated the ''output gate'', and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit <math>C</math> with <math>n</math> input variables is represented by the [[Boolean function]] <math>f_C:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}</math>; for example, on input bits <math>a_1,a_2,...,a_n</math>, the output bit <math>b</math> of the circuit is represented mathematically as <math>b = f_C(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)</math>. The circuit <math>C</math> is said to ''compute'' the Boolean function <math>f_C</math>.\n\nA particular circuit only acts on inputs of fixed size. [[Formal language|Languages]] (the formal representation of [[decision problem]]s), however, contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language <math>L</math> if, for every string <math>w</math>, <math>w</math> is in the language <math>L</math> if and only if <math>C_n(w)=1</math>, where <math>n</math> is the length of <math>w</math>. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.\n\nWhile complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of [[time complexity]], circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size. The size of a circuit is the number of vertices in it. The size complexity of a circuit family <math>(C_0,C_1,...)</math> is the function <math>f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, where <math>f(n)</math> is the circuit size of <math>C_n</math>. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size complexity is one such that the function <math>f</math> is a [[polynomial]].\n\nThis leads directly to the complexity class '''[[P/poly]]''', the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in <math>\\mathsf{TIME}(t(n))</math>, where <math>t</math> is a function <math>t:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, then it has circuit complexity <math>O(t^2(n))</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|page=355}}</ref> It follows directly from this that '''[[P]]'''<math>\\subseteq</math>'''P/poly'''. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper ('''P'''<math>\\subset</math>'''P/poly''') because there are undecidable problems that are in '''P/poly'''.\n\n'''P/poly''' turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to [[P versus NP|'''P''' versus '''NP''']]. For example, if there is any language in '''NP''' that is not in '''P/poly''', then '''P'''<math>\\neq</math>'''NP'''.<ref>Arora and Barak p. 286</ref> '''P/poly''' also helps to investigate properties of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]. For example, if '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' \u2286 '''P/poly''', then '''PH''' collapses to <math>\\Sigma_2^{\\mathsf P}</math>. A full description of the relations between '''P/poly''' and other complexity classes is available at \"[[P/poly#Importance of P/poly|Importance of P/poly]]\". '''P/poly''' also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded [[advice (complexity)|advice function]].\n\nTwo subclasses of '''P/poly''' that have interesting properties in their own right are '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their ''depth''. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest [[directed path]] from an input node to the output node. The class '''NC''' is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having ''polylogarithmic depth''. The class '''AC''' is defined similarly to '''NC''', however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). '''NC''' is an important class because it turns out that it represents the class of languages that have efficient ''[[parallel algorithm]]s''.\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is however less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.  Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of [[computability theory]] but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |\n\n| colspan=4 |\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:lightBlue;

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.

A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\n===Time-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n\n! Model of computation\n!

In particular:\n* The classes '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''', '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''', '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''', and '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' are defined using the [[probabilistic Turing machine]]\n* The classes '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' and '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' are defined using the [[interactive proof system]]\n* The class '''[[P/poly]]''' and its subclasses '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]''' are defined using the [[boolean circuit]]\n* The classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''' are defined using the [[quantum Turing machine]]\n\nThese are explained in greater detail below.\n\n====Randomized computation====\n{{Main|Probabilistic Turing machine}}\n\nA number of important complexity classes are defined using the ''[[probabilistic Turing machine]]'', a variant of the [[Turing machine]] that can toss random coins. These classes help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of error that is allowed. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\n[[File:Randomized Complexity Classes.svg|thumb|The relationships between the fundamental probabilistic complexity classes. BQP is a quantum complexity class and is described in the quantum computing section.]]\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability 0. Intuitively, this is the strictest class of probabilistic problems because it demands ''no error whatsoever''. A slightly looser class is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), which maintains no error for strings not in the language but allows bounded error for strings in the language. More formally, a language is in '''RP''' if there is a probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine <math>M</math> such that if a string is not in the language then <math>M</math> always rejects and if a string is in the language then <math>M</math> accepts with a probability at least 1/2. The class '''co-RP''' is similarly defined except the roles are flipped: error is not allowed for strings in the language but is allowed for strings not in the language. Taken together, the classes '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' encompass all of the problems that can be solved by probabilistic Turing machines with [[one-sided error]]. Loosening the error requirements further to allow for [[two-sided error]] yields the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability less than 1/3 (for both strings in the language and not in the language). '''BPP''' is the most practically relevant of the probabilistic complexity classes\u2014most problems of interest in '''BPP''' have efficient probabilistic algorithms that can be run quickly on real computers. '''BPP''' is also at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown. The broadest class of efficiently-solvable probabilistic problems is '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''' (probabilistic polynomial time), the set of languages solvable by a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time with an error probability of less than 1/2 for all strings.\n\n'''ZPP''', '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' are all subsets of '''BPP'''. The reason for this is intuitive: the classes allowing zero error and only one-sided error are all contained within the class that allows for two-sided error. '''BPP''' is a subset of '''PP'''. '''ZPP''' relates to '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' in the following way: '''ZPP'''<math>=</math>'''RP'''<math>\\cap</math>'''co-RP''', that is, '''ZPP''' consists exactly of those problems that are in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP'''. Intuitively, this follows from the fact that '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' allow only one-sided error. A problem in '''RP''' allows error only for strings in the language. But a problem in '''co-RP''' allows error only for strings not in the language, i.e. it disallows error for strings in the language. Hence, if a problem is in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP''', then there must be no error for strings in the language. A similar argument shows that no error is allowed for strings not in the language if the language is in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP'''. Together, this means that no error is allowed whatsoever, which is exactly the definition of '''ZPP'''.\n\n====Interactive  proof systems====\n{{Main|Interactive proof system}}\nA number of complexity classes are defined using ''interactive proof systems''. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and yield insights into [[cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm]]s, and [[formal verification]].\n\n[[File:Interactive proof (complexity).svg|thumb|300px|General representation of an interactive proof protocol.]]\nInteractive proof systems are [[abstract machine]]s that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover <math>P</math> and a verifier <math>V</math>. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover <math>P</math> has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover determine if a string is in a language and then sending a trustworthy \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an \"interrogation\" of the prover by \"asking it\" successive rounds of questions, accepting only if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4|page=144|quote=\"The verifier conducts an interrogation of the prover, repeatedly asking questions and listening to the prover's responses.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic, polynomial-time machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full [[Certificate (complexity)|proof]] to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class '''NP'''\u2014the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is \"YES\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine\u2014is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by the prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. \n\nIt turns out that '''NP''' describes the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because, for any proof systems with deterministic verifiers, it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require ''probabilistic verifiers'', which means that the verifiers' questions to provers are computed using [[probabilistic algorithm]]s. As noted in the section above, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of the error probability. \n\nThe most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system <math>(P,V)</math>, where <math>V</math> is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language <math>L \\in </math> '''IP'''\n# (Completeness) a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>\n# (Soundness) a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\le \\tfrac{1}{3}</math>\n\nAn important feature of '''IP''' is that it equals '''[[PSPACE]]'''.\n\nA modification of the protocol for '''IP''' produces another important complexity class: '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' (Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by '''IP''', the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation\u2014it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called ''private random coins''. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are ''public random coins'', that is the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, '''AM''' is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. '''AM''' can be generalized to '''AM'''[k], where k is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard '''AM''' defined above is '''AM'''[2]). However, it is the case that for all k<math>\\geq</math>2, '''AM'''[k]='''AM'''[2]. It is also the case that '''AM'''[k]<math>\\subseteq</math>'''IP'''[k].\n\nOther complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include '''[[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]]''' (mutliprover interactive polynomial time) and '''[[QIP (complexity)|QIP]]''' (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\n====Boolean circuits====\n{{Main|Circuit complexity}}\nAn alternative model of computation to the [[Turing machine]] is the ''[[Boolean circuit]]'', a simplified model of the [[digital circuit]]s used in modern [[computer]]s. Not only does this model provide a more intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for [[non-uniform computation]] (different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms) that leads to a number of new complexity classes.\n\nFormally, a Boolean circuit <math>C</math> is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which edges represent ''wires'' (which carry the [[bit]] values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by ''source vertices'' (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent ''[[logic gate]]s'' (generally the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate]]s). One logic gate is designated the ''output gate'', and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit <math>C</math> with <math>n</math> input variables is represented by the [[Boolean function]] <math>f_C:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}</math>; for example, on input bits <math>a_1,a_2,...,a_n</math>, the output bit <math>b</math> of the circuit is represented mathematically as <math>b = f_C(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)</math>. The circuit <math>C</math> is said to ''compute'' the Boolean function <math>f_C</math>.\n\nA particular circuit only acts on inputs of fixed size. [[Formal language|Languages]] (the formal representation of [[decision problem]]s), however, contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language <math>L</math> if, for every string <math>w</math>, <math>w</math> is in the language <math>L</math> if and only if <math>C_n(w)=1</math>, where <math>n</math> is the length of <math>w</math>. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.\n\nWhile complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of [[time complexity]], circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size. The size of a circuit is the number of vertices in it. The size complexity of a circuit family <math>(C_0,C_1,...)</math> is the function <math>f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, where <math>f(n)</math> is the circuit size of <math>C_n</math>. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size complexity is one such that the function <math>f</math> is a [[polynomial]].\n\nThis leads directly to the complexity class '''[[P/poly]]''', the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in <math>\\mathsf{TIME}(t(n))</math>, where <math>t</math> is a function <math>t:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, then it has circuit complexity <math>O(t^2(n))</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|page=355}}</ref> It follows directly from this that '''[[P]]'''<math>\\subseteq</math>'''P/poly'''. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper ('''P'''<math>\\subset</math>'''P/poly''') because there are undecidable problems that are in '''P/poly'''.\n\n'''P/poly''' turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to [[P versus NP|'''P''' versus '''NP''']]. For example, if there is any language in '''NP''' that is not in '''P/poly''', then '''P'''<math>\\neq</math>'''NP'''.<ref>Arora and Barak p. 286</ref> '''P/poly''' also helps to investigate properties of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]. For example, if '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' \u2286 '''P/poly''', then '''PH''' collapses to <math>\\Sigma_2^{\\mathsf P}</math>. A full description of the relations between '''P/poly''' and other complexity classes is available at \"[[P/poly#Importance of P/poly|Importance of P/poly]]\". '''P/poly''' also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded [[advice (complexity)|advice function]].\n\nTwo subclasses of '''P/poly''' that have interesting properties in their own right are '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their ''depth''. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest [[directed path]] from an input node to the output node. The class '''NC''' is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having ''polylogarithmic depth''. The class '''AC''' is defined similarly to '''NC''', however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). '''NC''' is an important class because it turns out that it represents the class of languages that have efficient ''[[parallel algorithm]]s''.\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is however less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.  Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of [[computability theory]] but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |\n\n| colspan=4 |\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:lightBlue;

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.

On October 3, 1920, the Staleys played their first NFL game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/chicago/bears.html |title=Chicago Bears (1920\u2013Present) |publisher=Sportsecyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> Official team and league records cite Halas as the team's founder as he took over the team in 1920 when it became a charter member of the NFL.<ref>{{cite web | title = George Halas: Hall of Fame Member | work = Pro Football Hall of Fame | url = http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=85 | accessdate = May 14, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Decatur Staleys===\n[[File:Decatur staleys 1920.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 1920 Decatur Staleys.]]\n[[George Halas]], then the player-coach of A.E. Staley's Decatur Staleys, was among the driving forces of this meeting, which gave birth to what is now the NFL. In their first season as part of the Association, the Staleys won 10 games, all by shutouts, but lost the first league championship to the [[Akron Pros]], who finished the season unbeaten at 8\u20130\u20133. There was no official scheduling in the 1920 season, which accounted for the difference in the number of games played that season. <!--before pro-football Halas had played for the [[New York Yankees]] in baseball, and was replaced in the outfield by [[Babe Ruth]] in 1920.

In the Cardinals 7\u20136 victory over the Staleys in their first meeting of the season, each team scored a TD on a fumble recovery, with the Staleys failing their XP try. George Halas' 1920 Staleys went on to a 10\u20131\u20132 record overall, 5\u20131\u20132 in league play. The 1920 Akron Pros were the first ever league champions; they finished with an 8\u20130\u20133 record, 6\u20130\u20133 in league play, ending their season in a 0\u20130 tie against the Decatur Staleys. Because the Staleys had lost to the Racine (Chi) Cardinals earlier that year, the Pros could simply play the final game not to lose; they wisely did and became champions. The Staleys loss to the Cardinals began a long-standing rivalry between the franchises.\n\nHad the Staleys won, there would have been a three-way tie among the Staleys, the Buffalo All-Americans (9\u20131\u20131 in 1920, 4\u20131\u20131 in league play) and the Pros, each team having one loss. Each team likely would have played more games (as it was allowed under the rules in those days) to allow teams to settle parity at the top of the standings.\n\n===First years in Chicago===\n[[File:George Halas.jpg|thumb|right|170px|George Halas as player-coach of the Chicago Bears during the 1922 season.]]\nThe Staleys moved to Chicago from [[Decatur, Illinois]] in 1921. Halas, who was given the team and $5000 by Staley to keep the name Staleys for another year, made the move. In the 1921 season, the '''Chicago Staleys''' finished first in the league and captured their [[1921 NFL season|first league championship]].\n\nIn 1922, [[George Halas|Halas]] changed the team name to the '''Bears''' to reflect baseball's [[Chicago Cubs]], the team's host at [[Wrigley Field]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chicagoist.com/2007/01/31/ask_chicagoist_why_are_they_called_the_bears.php |title=Ask Chicagoist: Why Are They Called the Bears? |last=Exoo |first=Thales |publisher=[[Gothamist]] |date=31 January 2007 |website=Chicagoist |access-date=19 December 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510153921/http://chicagoist.com/2007/01/31/ask_chicagoist_why_are_they_called_the_bears.php |archivedate=May 10, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Over the next few years, the Bears were ranked among the elite teams in the [[National Football League|NFL]], but could never capture an NFL Championship because the league did not have a playoff system. Instead it had a somewhat controversial scheduling formula, which led to uneven standings and controversial champions.{{Ref|pottsville}} The highlight of the decade was [[George Halas]]'s unprecedented move to sign [[Red Grange]] for $100,000 in 1925. In 1925, professional football was viewed negatively by Americans, as most Americans loved [[college football]] which they saw as a pure sport. Halas, though, took the Bears on a 17-game road trip across America to highlight Grange. The tour began on Thanksgiving at [[Wrigley Field]] as the [[Chicago Cardinals]] held the Galloping Ghost to just 36 yards in his professional debut, the city rivals battling to a 0\u20130 tie. However, during the tour that continued through January 31, the Bears posted an impressive 11\u20134\u20132 record.\n\nThis road trip impressed many Americans, boosting the prospects of many debt-ridden teams such as the [[New York Giants]]. Grange left the Bears after a contract dispute in 1926 and moved to establish his own league, the first incarnation of the [[American Football League (1926)|American Football League]]. That league folded after one season and Grange's [[New York Yankees (NFL)|New York Yankees]] were admitted into the [[National Football League|NFL]]. Grange injured his knee in his first game against the Bears in 1927 and was forced to sit out the 1928 season. He returned to Chicago in 1929, but the Bears ended the decade with a losing season as Halas retired as player and coach of the Bears and appointed [[Ralph Jones]] as his successor.\n\n===The thirties===\n[[Image:1932Bears.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Team photo of the Bears, 1932 league champions.]]\nThe Bears of the 1930s were remembered for being led by a ferocious tandem of [[Bronko Nagurski]] and [[Red Grange]], playing in the newly established NFL Championship Game four times and claiming the league title twice.\n\nAfter completing the 1930 season with a record of 9\u20134\u20131, the Bears and [[Arizona Cardinals|Cardinals]] played in the first indoor football game on December 15 at [[Chicago Stadium]] in a charity game for those affected by the [[Great Depression]]. Due to the size limitations of the indoor arena, the length of the football field was only 80 yards. The Bears beat their city rivals 9\u20137. In the 1932 season, the Bears and [[Portsmouth Spartans]] tied for first place in the league. The teams played an [[1932 NFL Playoff Game|\"unofficial\" championship playoff game]],{{Ref|1932playoff}} held on December 18 at [[Chicago Stadium]]. The Bears won the game 9\u20130 and captured the NFL Championship before 11,198 fans.\n\nThe popularity of the game prompted the NFL to institute various rule changes for the 1933 season, including the splitting of the league into two geographical divisions and the establishment of an officially scheduled championship game to determine the NFL champion.\n\nIn 1933, George Halas made his return to coaching the Bears. Halas led the Bears to win the first ever Western Division title and the first ever NFL Championship Game. The Bears again captured the championship in a nail biter against the [[New York Giants]], 23\u201321 as Red Grange made the game-winning tackle. In 1934, the Bears dominated the league and finished 13\u20130, but were denied perfection, losing 30\u201313 to the Giants in the [[1934 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship]], what became known as the \"Sneakers Game.\"\n\nThe Bears would play in the Championship game two more times in the decade, losing both of them. In 1935 and 1936, the Bears remained somewhat competitive, but failed to qualify for the Championship Game. In 1937, the Bears made a return trip to the NFL Championship, but fell short as [[Sammy Baugh]] and the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] won, 28\u201321. In 1938, the Bears fell off the NFL map, with a record of 6\u20135. The Bears finished off the 1930s on a down note, losing twice to the [[Green Bay Packers]] in 1939.\n\nDuring the late 1930s George Halas and [[University of Chicago]] football coach [[Clark Shaughnessy]] collaborated on a revolutionary approach to the offense and the quarterback position. The result was the [[T formation|T-formation offense]] and the first evolution of the modern quarterback. A complex scheme that required an athletic player with quick decision skills led Halas to recruit [[Columbia University]] quarterback [[Sid Luckman]]. He turned the position into an engine for a high powered and time-consuming scoring machine.\n\n===Dynasty: Monsters of the Midway===\n[[Image:1946Bears.jpg|thumb|left|1946 Chicago Bears champion team.]]\n[[File:T Formation.svg|thumb|right|The [[T-formation]] that the Bears innovated in their 73\u20130 win over Washington.]]\nFrom 1940 to 1946, the Bears were considered a dynasty. In these years, the nickname [[Monsters of the Midway]] was first attributed to the Bears. In this span, the Bears went to 5 championships and won 4 of them. This is despite George Halas temporarily leaving the organization to serve in World War II, from 1943 to 1945.\n\nIn the 1940 [[NFL Championship]], Halas introduced his T-formation offense, with [[Sid Luckman]] at quarterback.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=135\n|title=Sid Luckman Hall of Fame\n|accessdate=2007-02-08\n}}</ref> This formation shocked and confused the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] all day as the Bears won 73\u20130, an NFL record that stands to this day. The T-formation was soon widely copied at the college and pro levels.\n\nIn 1941, the Bears and [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] battled to a 10\u20131\u20130 tie for 1st place in the Western Division. Since the teams split their two regular season match-ups, which turned out to be each team's only loss of the season, a one-game playoff was set up. The Bears won 33\u201314, moving on to rout the [[New York Giants|Giants]] 37\u20139 in the NFL Championship.\n\nIn 1942, the Bears started the season off well before Halas departed for World War II; 45 Bears players also joined the war effort,<ref>{{cite web|last=Boden|first=Chris|url=http://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/chicago-bears/history-bears-who-served-during-world-war-ii|title=A history of the Bears who served during World War II|publisher=[[Comcast SportsNet Chicago]]|date=May 29, 2017|accessdate=January 7, 2018}}</ref> resulting in a roster shortage that nearly led to the Bears merging with the Cardinals in 1943.<ref>{{cite book|last=Algeo|first=Matthew|date=September 1, 2013|title=Last Team Standing: How the Steelers and the Eagles\u2014\"The Steagles\"\u2014Saved Pro Football During World War II|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]|isbn=1613748884|pages=48\u201349}}</ref> His handpicked successors [[Hunk Anderson]] and [[Luke Johnsos]] ran the team for the next three years until Halas returned. The Bears finished the regular season 11\u20130 and played the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] in the Championship game. The Redskins spoiled the Bears attempt at a perfect season; with a 14\u20136 upset preventing the Bears from [[three-peat]]ing. In the 1943 season, the Bears dominated the Western Division behind the quarterbacking of Luckman, who threw for 433 yards and seven TDs that season in a single game versus the [[New York Giants]]. In the Championship Game, the Redskins were no challenge to the Bears as the crowd of 34,320 at [[Wrigley Field]] watched the Bears win 41\u201321 behind Sid Luckman's five TDs and Nagurski's final TD run.\n\nThe Bears' domination of the NFL took a slight fall in as the Bears posted a mediocre result in 1944 and a losing season in 1945. \"Papa Bear\" Halas made a return to the Bears in 1946. The Bears were able to find their old magic again, with many players returning from service in the war, finishing the regular season 8\u20132\u20131 to claim another Western Division title and a return trip to the Championship game. The Bears won their last Championship of the decade over the [[New York Giants]], 24\u201314, before a then [[NFC Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]] record crowd of 58,346 at the [[Polo Grounds]] in New York. This was the Bears' last Championship for the next 16 years.\n\n==Middle years: The rough years (1947\u20131981)==\nDuring this span of 34 seasons, the Bears had a combined record of 237\u2013224\u20139. Seventeen of those seasons finished with a record of .500 or better. Out of those 17 seasons, they won the NFL Western Division twice. Also, they qualified for the playoffs only five times, while losing the [[1956 NFL Championship Game|1956 NFL Championship]] and then winning the [[1963 NFL Championship Game|1963 NFL Championship]]. Despite these rough years, players like [[Gale Sayers]] and [[Dick Butkus]] thrived in their careers.\n\n===The decline from the top===\nIn 1947, The Bears got off to a slow start by losing their first two games. The team rebounded however and quickly ran off an eight-game winning streak to get back into the race for first place in the Western Division. After losing to the [[Los Angeles Rams]] 17\u201314 in the second to last game of the season, the Bears and [[Chicago Cardinals]] faced off in the final game of the season, with the Western Division title on the line. Despite it being a home game for the Bears at [[Wrigley Field]] the Cardinals came in and would stun the Bears 30\u201321 en route to the [[1947 in sports|1947 NFL Championship]]. In 1948, for the second season in a row, the Bears put together another great regular season but fell short to their inner city rival Cardinals. The Bears posted a 10\u20132 record, but lost a key game against the Cardinals that gave them the Western Division Championship.\n\nIn 1949, The Bears continued to be one of the best teams in the NFL. However, they fell one game short of making the Championship game again. The Bears' success continued into 1950 as they began the new decade in style by finishing 9\u20133, which was good enough to earn them a tie for the Western Division with the [[Los Angeles Rams]] and play in the Conference Playoff against them. However, the Bears were unable to slow down the high-powered Ram offense in a 24\u201314 loss in Los Angeles as the Rams advanced to the NFL Championship Game.\n\nIn 1951, The Bears got off to a streaking start winning five of their first six games. The magic faded in the second half as they collapsed, winning just 2 of their final 6 games as they finished in 4th place in the conference with a mediocre record of 7\u20135. In the 1952 season, the Bears' defense struggled all season as they allowed a wretched 326 points and the team finished below .500 for the first time since 1945, finishing in 5th place with a record of 5\u20137. The team's struggles continued into 1953 as most of their superstars from the 1940s dynasty were now retired the Bears finished 3\u20138\u20131, and, for the first time in team history, the Bears posted back-to-back losing seasons. One notable occurrence in the 1953 season was that the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s first modern era African-American quarterback, [[Willie Thrower]] played in his 1st and only game against the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. Like Thrower's career in the NFL, the Bears troubles were short lived, as they rose up in 1954 to the Bears of old. The team got back into the league playoff picture by posting a solid record of 8\u20134, good enough for 2nd place in the division, but not an appearance in the Championship game.\n\nIn 1955, the team posted a second consecutive 8\u20134 season, 2nd place again, as Head Coach [[George Halas]] called it quits for the third time in his coaching career. Halas replaced himself with former team standout [[Paddy Driscoll]]. Driscoll's success would be highlighted in his first season with the team. In 1956, [[Paddy Driscoll]] led the Bears to put together a solid 9\u20132\u20131 season and to beat out fellow Midwest rival [[Detroit Lions]] by a half a game for the 1956 Western Division Championship. The magical season though ended sourly as the Bears were no match for the [[New York Giants]] in the [[1956 in sports|1956 NFL Championship]], as the Bears were blasted in a 47\u20137 rout in New York City. The magic of the championship season was short lived though as in 1957 the Bears dropped from first to below .500 with a 5\u20137 record. This prompted Halas to quickly fire Driscoll and return to the sidelines.\n\nIn George Halas's return to the sidelines in 1958, the Bears rebounded off the disappointing losing season by challenging for the Western Division Championship all season before faltering at the end and finishing in a second place tie with an 8\u20134 record, one game away from the Championship Game. The Bears closed out the decade in 1959 with yet another 8\u20134 finish that was only good enough for second place in the division.  The 1950s gave way to Bear greats such as Ed \"The Claw\" Sprinkle, [[Bill George (American football player)|Bill George]], [[George Connor (American football)|George Connor]], and Harlon Hill.\n\nThe end of the decade also marked the first time in team history that the Bears did not win an NFL Championship during a decade.  This was a sign of the downfall that the Bears were about to encounter. Halas, always the resilient innovator, found a young assistant in [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]]. A tireless and detail oriented young coach, Allen quickly created innovations such as thick play books for training camps, the first glimpses of deceptive schemes and exhaustive research for the NFL draft. With the support of George Halas, Allen turned the draft into a windfall for future Hall of Fame talent.\n\n===One more championship for Halas===\n[[Image:Dickbutkus.jpg|170px|thumb|right|[[Dick Butkus]] was one of the most dominating of the Bears players.]]\nThe Bears started off the 1960s as the only team in Chicago, as the Cardinals decided to move to St Louis.  As for the 1960 season, the Bears finished a disappointing 5\u20136\u20131 in 5th place in the NFL Western Conference.  In the 1961 season, the Bears rebounded off a losing season to finish in 4th place in the conference with a record of 8\u20136 as rookie tight end [[Mike Ditka]] made an instant impact by collecting 1,076 receiving yards and 12 TDs, and setting a club record for rookies with 56 receptions, while winning the [[NFL Rookie of the Year Award]]. The Bears also made their first trip out of American soil into Canada to take on the [[Canadian Football League|CFL's]] [[Montreal Alouettes]] (the original franchise), with the Bears proving to be the better team, winning 34\u201316.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?STORY_ID=7241 |title=Bears played game in Canada in 1961 |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824145437/http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?STORY_ID=7241 |archive-date=August 24, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The 1962 season brought on for the second straight season a rookie who made an immediate impact with the team. [[Ronnie Bull (American football)|Ron Bull]] won the [[NFL Rookie of the Year Award]] as the Bears finished in 3rd place in the Conference with a solid 9\u20135 record.\n\nThe Bears' rookie success hit a pinnacle in 1963 as the Bears broke the [[Green Bay Packers]]' three-year stranglehold on the Western Division and the NFL by posting an 11\u20131\u20132 record. In the [[NFC Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]] at [[Wrigley Field]], the Bears battled the [[New York Giants]] in front of 45,801 fans on a bone-chilling afternoon. The Bears won their eighth NFL Championship, 14\u201310 as [[Bill Wade]] scored both Bear touchdowns. However, the star of the game was the Bears' dominating defense, which intercepted Giants star QB [[Y. A. Tittle]] a stunning 5 times. The following season the Bears followed up their NFL Championship with an underachieving 5\u20139 season. This poor performance prompted Halas to search for young talent in the upcoming draft. He selected the \"Kansas Comet\" RB [[Gale Sayers]] and LB [[Dick Butkus]] in the first round of the draft to improve both the offense and defense.\n\nThe 1965 season proved to be yet another year where a rookie Bear made an impact as Sayers won the NFL Rookie of the Year Award, while establishing a new NFL record with 22 touchdowns during the season, still a club record. His record season and his entire career would be highlighted by his six-touchdown performance against the San Francisco 49ers at Wrigley Field on December 12. The new element of Sayers helped the Bears to finish in 3rd place with a 9\u20134\u20131 record. Sayers continued his offensive successes in 1966 with a then-NFL record 2,440 all-purpose yards, but his offensive success did not result in wins and the team finished with a 5\u20137\u20132 season. Meanwhile, Mike Ditka abruptly retired from playing at the end of the season, dissatisfied with Halas's unwillingness to spend money on talent. He went to Dallas and became an assistant coach under Tom Landry.\n1967 not only saw the first Super Bowl in the NFL, but also 47 years after his first season, George Halas (now 72) retired for the final time with a then-NFL record 324 coaching wins, which stood until 1993 when Don Shula broke the record. In Papa Bear's final season, the team played respectably with a 7\u20136\u20131 record and a second-place finish in the Central Division. Halas claimed that he didn't retire from coaching because of his age, but because the old hip injury he had sustained as a baseball player made it almost impossible for him to stand on the sidelines during games.\n\nHalas's replacement was [[Jim Dooley]]. In Dooley's first season at the helm of the team, the Bears finished with a 7\u20137 record. The low point of the season, though, was not the mediocre performance but a career threatening knee injury to Gale Sayers, from which he never fully recovered. The decade though was highlighted with the 1969 season. After Sayers's injury, back-up running back [[Brian Piccolo]] did not believe he deserved the job because of the injury. Instead of running away with his opportunity as most athletes would, Piccolo, who was a popular figure in the Chicago area and roomed with Sayers for a few years on road trips, during the entire off-season pushed Sayers to get his knee back into football playing shape. Sayers got back into the lineup, and Piccolo was back on the bench when the season started. Sayers rushed for 1,000 yards and earned the [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award]]. This was the ultimate display of friendship between Piccolo and Sayers, who were friends despite race differences within society during the 1960s. The Bears finished the season, even with Sayers's performance, with a franchise-worst 1\u201313 record. The Bears' hopes worsened due to the fact that they had the No. 2 pick, while the Steelers had the first overall pick (with the Bears defeating them), allowing Pittsburgh to draft future Hall-of-Famer [[Terry Bradshaw]].\n\nThe horror of the season came when [[Brian Piccolo]] started suffering breathing problems. A hospital physical revealed his worst fear: lung cancer. On June 16, 1970 just 7 months after being diagnosed, Piccolo lost his battle with lung cancer at the age of 26. The Bears responded by setting up the Brian Piccolo Cancer Research Fund, which raises money through various annual events for cancer research. In November 1971, ABC premiered the TV Movie entitled \"[[Brian's Song]].\" The film starred [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]] as Piccolo and [[Billy Dee Williams]] as Gale Sayers detailing the friendship between the two Bear running backs. A heartfelt and sad story that evolves would go down as one of the most beloved sports movies of all time.\n\n===After AFL\u2013NFL merger and the move to Soldier Field===\nThe 1970s began with the end of an era for the entire league, especially for the Bears. The sport, which once lagged behind baseball and college football in terms of popularity, was beginning a huge rise since the advent of the Super Bowl. Due to this, bigger venues were needed to support the fan base. The home of the Cubs had been the Bears home field for nearly 50 years; but after the merger the NFL required all stadiums to seat at least 50,000. The Bears finished off their tenure at Wrigley Field on December 13 by winning against the rival Green Bay Packers (35\u201317). In doing so, the Bears finished in 4th place in the NFC Central with a record of 6\u20138.\n\nThe new home of the Bears was another classic stadium in itself; [[Soldier Field]], built in the 1920s as a memorial for World War I veterans and was the host of many great sports events including Jack Dempsey vs. Gene Tunney in 1927 and various college football games such as annual Army-Navy matches.\n\nIn their first home game at Soldier Field, the Bears emerged victorious defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers (17\u201315). The victory was short-lived as the Bears finished 6\u20138 leading to the termination of head coach Jim Dooley. New Coach Abe Gibron did not start his tenure any better with the Bears. The team was last place in the NFC Central division with a record of 4\u20139\u20131. The era under Gibron took a deeper dive during the 1973 season as the team finished in last place again with a record of 3\u201311 as the Bears were limited to just 195 total points during the entire season. Dick Butkus, who had terrorized enemy offensive players for the last eight years, retired early in the season after being hobbled by knee injuries. The 1974 season proved to be Gibron's final one with the Bears as the team finished yet again in last place, this time with a record of 4\u201310. The Gibron era was marked with a combined record of 11\u201330\u20131 and with the only memory was not a play or moment, but Gibron's appearance in an NFL Films production where he was taped singing \"Joy to the World\", not paying attention to the game in front of him.\n\n===Building for a championship===\nIn 1975, the rebuilding of the Bears fell to Hall of Fame GM [[Jim Finks]] who brought in [[Jack Pardee]] to coach. This was the first time in franchise history that the Bears hired a head coach who was not associated with the franchise. The move did not have any initial impact as the team finished 4\u201310. The best move of the year was the drafting of RB [[Walter Payton]] in the first Round. Known as \"Sweetness\", he eventually would become one of the Bears' greatest players ever. The string of losing seasons ended in 1976 with Pardee's coaching and the running of Walter Payton who rushed for 1,390 yards while scoring 13 TDs. The Bears posted a 7\u20137 record, which was good enough for 2nd place. In his 3rd season, Payton had a breakout year, rushing for a team record 1,852 yards highlighted by a single-game performance of 275 yards, which established a single game record that would stand for the next two decades.\n\n[[File:Chicago Bears at St Louis Cardinals 9 25 77.jpg|thumb|left|The Bears in a 1977 game against the [[St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis Cardinals]] at [[Busch Memorial Stadium]]]]\nThat year Payton captured both [[NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award]] and the [[NFL MVP Award]]. Behind the running of Payton, the Bears won their final six games to finish second with a 9\u20135 record, which was good enough for the NFC's Wild Card spot. The Bears though were outpowered and overmatched in their first playoff game since 1963 as the eventual [[Super Bowl XI|Super Bowl Champion]] Cowboys defeated them 37\u20137 in Dallas.  At the end of the season, Pardee left the Bears to take over the coaching reins of the [[Washington Redskins]].  The Bears replaced Pardee with [[Minnesota Vikings]] Defensive coordinator [[Neill Armstrong]]. Armstrong's first season proved to be a step backwards from their playoff appearance with a 7\u20139 showing. The Bears would be more successful in the 1979 season, but tragedy struck the team as the Bears were celebrating their playoff berth.\n\nOn December 16 as the Bears earned that spot on the final day of the season with a 42\u20136 victory over the [[St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis Cardinals]], team president George \"Mugs\" Halas Jr. died of a massive heart attack at the age of 54. \"Mugs\", the son of the legendary Bears founder George Halas, had served as the president since 1953. The Bears had to regroup quickly as they would face the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in the [[1979\u201380 NFL playoffs|Wild Card Game]] at Philadelphia a week later. The Bears held a 17\u201310 lead in the early moments of the second half only to see the Eagles soar back, moving on to the next round with a 27\u201317 victory.  The Bears did not return to the playoffs again under Armstrong and in 1980, they fell below .500 with a 7\u20139 record (despite some seminal moments in Bear lore). On October 6, 1980, Payton broke the Bears all-time franchise all-purpose yardage total previously held by [[Gale Sayers]]'s with 9,462 career yards. On Thanksgiving in Detroit, [[Dave Williams (American football)|Dave Williams]] took the overtime kickoff 95 yards for a TD, setting an NFL record for the fastest end to an OT, and on December 7 the Bears ripped the Green Bay Packers 61\u20137, the biggest margin of victory in the series. Armstrong lasted just one more year with the Bears, finishing with a last place showing and a 6\u201310 record.  He was fired in the off-season.\n\nBy the end of the 1970s the beginnings of a front office brain trust was in place. general manager Jim Finks was building the foundation of a championship team. Scout Bill Tobin had a knack for finding overlooked talent in the NFL draft. Defensive Coordinator Buddy Ryan was beginning to formulate his revolutionary \"46 Defense.\" As with earlier innovations involving the T-formation with Clark Shaughnessy and later creative ideas with George Allen, the pieces began to fit into place for a championship run.\n\nAlso, in [[1976 Chicago Bears season|1976]], the Bears debuted the team's [[National Football League Cheerleading|cheerleading squad]] called the [[Chicago Honey Bears|Honey Bears]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor |first=Roy |url=http://www.bearshistory.com/sidelines/chicagohoneybears.aspx/ |title=The Honey Bears and Chicago Bears Mascots |publisher=Bearshistory.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> Despite the squad's success, Halas's daughter [[Virginia Halas McCaskey]] terminated the group in 1985, after [[Super Bowl XX]], starting claims of a \"Honey Bear Curse\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/296096-come-to-think-of-it-the-curse-of-the-honey-bears |title=Come To Think of It: The Curse of the Honey Bears |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=November 24, 2009 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, the Bears was notable for crushing the Packers 61\u20137 in the most one-sided game in the history of the [[Bears-Packers rivalry]].\n\nEarly in 1982, George Halas summoned [[Mike Ditka]] back from Dallas and offered him the head coaching job, which he accepted.\n\n==The Ditka era: Bears renaissance (1982\u20131992)==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#b0c4de; width:20em;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"Give me three years, and if you walk with me, we'll go to the dance.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" | ~'''''[[Mike Ditka]]'s''''' first words to the team<ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor |first=Roy |url=http://www.bearshistory.com/lore/mikeditka.aspx |title=Mike Ditka Biography |publisher=Bearshistory.com |date=October 18, 1939 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref>\n|}\nFrom 1982 to 1992 under coach [[Mike Ditka]], the Bears recorded a record of 112\u201368.  After George Halas, Ditka became the second Bears coach to record more than 100 wins as coach.  In addition, the Bears won 6 Division titles and made three trips to the NFC Championship game.  The peak of this era was the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Bears season]] where they won [[Super Bowl XX]].\n\nThe 1982 season was Mike Ditka's first season as head coach of the Bears, and he began his rebuilding program by drafting Jim McMahon from Brigham Young University with the intention of his being a franchise QB. The season was interrupted by a players' strike and shortened to nine games. As a result, the NFL held a special playoff tournament involving the top eight teams in both conferences. The Bears did not qualify for the postseason, finishing in 12th place with a 3\u20136 record. In the spring of 1983, George Halas died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 88. He was the last surviving NFL founder. The death of Halas also brought the addition of the initials \"GSH\" on the left sleeve of the Bears uniforms. With Halas's passing, his daughter Virginia McCaskey and her husband Mike McCaskey assumed ownership of the team. In Ditka's second season, the Bears improved and finished with a record of 8\u20138. The 1983 draft was a critical one as it saw the core of the Bears' 1985 championship team arrive.\n\nIn 1984, [[Walter Payton]] broke [[Jim Brown]]'s all-time career rushing record (which pleased Brown, who had threatened to come out of retirement if [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] running back [[Franco Harris]] broke the record\u2014Brown disliked Harris's tendency to run out of bounds to avoid oncoming rushers <ref>{{cite web | title = JIM BROWN'S BAD DREAM | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/21/sports/jim-brown-s-bad-dream.html | accessdate = June 5, 2019 }}</ref>). Payton's record stood for eighteen years until it was broken by [[Emmitt Smith]] in 2002. The Bears finished the season with a 10\u20136 record to win their first [[NFC Central]] Division Championship. Even though the Bears won the division, they struggled toward the end of the season, which cost them a playoff home game. Instead, in the [[1984\u201385 NFL playoffs|Divisional Playoffs]] the Bears played the Washington Redskins at RFK stadium, ending the Redskins' quest for a third straight Super Bowl appearance with a 23\u201319 victory. The Bears advanced to the [[NFC Championship]] to play the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. The 49ers shut the Bears out 23\u20130 on their way to a [[Super Bowl XIX|Super Bowl Championship]], and also humiliated the Bears by sending in guard [[Guy McIntyre]] to play fullback.\n\n===1985: Super Bowl champions===\n1985 is the most celebrated year in Bears history. Through various rankings, the 1985 Bears have been marked as one of the top 5 NFL teams of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/football/teams/greatest.html\n|title=ESPN NFL 10 Greatest All Time Teams\n|accessdate=2008-02-08\n|work=ESPN.com\n}}</ref> The Bears beat the first 12 of their opponents.

The season brought players to the national spotlight such as [[William Perry (American football)|William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry]], [[Mike Singletary]], [[Jim McMahon]], [[Dan Hampton]], and [[Walter Payton]]. During the season, in Week 3, McMahon had back spasms, and when the Bears were trailing the [[Minnesota Vikings]], and eventually, the McMahon-led Bears stunned the Vikings in ''The Viking Miracle''<ref>{{cite web|last=Ditka |first=Mike |url=http://www.windycitygridiron.com/2010/1/28/1274047/hey-lets-check-out-the-viking |title=Hey-Let's check out the Viking Miracle (McMahon owns the Vikings) |publisher=Windy City Gridiron |date=January 28, 2010 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> Eventually, in Week 9, the Bears themselves embarrassed the 49ers 26\u201310, sacking [[Joe Montana]] a then-record 7 times, and the Bears claimed their revenge by sending Perry in, but instead of as a mere blocker like McIntyre, Ditka used him as a runner. The Bears also handed the Cowboys their worst loss in franchise history in Week 11 44\u20130, clinching the division for Chicago. Then, in the Week 12 game on Monday Night Football, the Bears suffered their only defeat, a 38\u201324 loss to the Miami Dolphins, who in doing so retained their status as the lone team to have ever had a perfect season. Chicago afterwards produced a music video called ''[[The Super Bowl Shuffle]]''. The Bears were also divided, as Head Coach [[Mike Ditka]] and Defensive Coordinator [[Buddy Ryan]] did not see eye to eye. In the [[1985\u201386 NFL playoffs|Divisional Playoffs]] the Bears played the [[New York Giants]], shutting them out 21\u20130, on a bitterly cold and windy afternoon. The Bears then faced the [[Los Angeles Rams]] in the [[NFC Championship]] Game. This game too was a shutout, the score being 24\u20130. The \"Monsters of the Midway\" advanced to the Super Bowl.\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 11 - Jim McMahon.jpg|thumb|right|The Bears making a rushing play in the end zone against the Patriots during Super Bowl XX.]]\nIn [[Super Bowl XX]], the Bears were enormously favored to beat their opponents, the New England Patriots. In the week before the game, [[Jim McMahon]] allegedly made some controversial comments about New Orleans women that got him some death threats, with McMahon responding by [[mooning]] a group of reporters because of the injury report stated McMahon had an injury to his buttock.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} At the same time, the NFL was cracking down on his trademark message headbands. However, during the game, McMahon wore a headband that said \"Pete\", in honor of Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]]. The Super Bowl was a circus atmosphere, getting huge TV ratings and reversing a decline in NFL viewership during the previous two years. The Bears started shaky as [[Walter Payton]] fumbled deep in Bears territory.  On the subsequent possession, the Patriots were unable to advance the football and had to settle for a field goal, taking a 3\u20130 lead. However, the Patriots' lead was short-lived as the Bears struck back by scoring the next 44 points in a relentless battering of the Patriots, including a touchdown by \"The Refrigerator\". The Bears won the game 46\u201310, setting then Super Bowl records for points and margin of victory as defensive end [[Richard Dent]] was named the [[Super Bowl MVP|Most Valuable Player of the Super Bowl]].\n\n===1986\u20131992: Post-Super Bowl years===\nIn 1986, the Bears' defense was even stingier coming off the Super Bowl establishing a new NFL record low for 187 points allowed as the Bears finished with another NFC Central title and a 14\u20132 record. The Bears attempt to defend their Super Bowl title took a blow when Jim McMahon suffered an injury as the result of an illegal hit by Packers' defender [[Charles Martin (American football)|Charles Martin]]. McMahon threw an interception and was slammed into the turf by Martin, injuring his shoulder and ending his season, which had already been subpar. [[Doug Flutie]] took over, but proved to be ineffective as the Bears were shocked by the Washington Redskins in the divisional playoffs, 27\u201313. A notable game in '86 was the inaugural [[American Bowl]], being the first Bears game outside of North America, with the Bears defeating the [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]] 17\u20136 in [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-04-13/sports/sp-4589_1_dallas-cowboys | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Bears, Cowboys May Sell Out Wembley for NFL Exhibition | date=April 13, 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.mitchellandness.com/post/This-Day-in-History-The-First-American-Bowl.aspx |title=Mitchell & Ness &#124; This Day in History: The First American Bowl |publisher=Blog.mitchellandness.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623195547/http://blog.mitchellandness.com/post/This-Day-in-History-The-First-American-Bowl.aspx |archive-date=June 23, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 12 - Walter Payton (Walter Payton crop).jpg|thumb|left|Payton set several franchise and NFL records in rushing during his 13-season career with the Bears]]\nAs the 1980s wore on, teams began to gradually figure out the [[46 defense]]. Offensive coordinators learned it was vulnerable to a short passing game, particularly the one devised by [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] (later referred to as the West Coast offense). The Bears also failed to draft proper replacements for aging starters.\n\nThe 1987 season brought a month-long strike that included the use of replacement players for three games. Off-field turmoil resulted when the team drafted QB [[Jim Harbaugh]] in the first round as a possible replacement for the injury-prone Jim McMahon. McMahon was offended by this and quarreled with Mike Ditka. The latter meanwhile unwisely took the side of the league during the strike, hurting relations with his players. Even with the replacements, the Bears continued to dominate the NFC Central, winning their fourth straight NFC Central title and achieving an 11\u20134 record (the strike resulted in a 15-game season), but ended 1987 on an embarrassing note as the team was destroyed in San Francisco 41\u20130. The year however was remembered for an end of an era as the player called \"Sweetness\" by many Bear fans retired after 13 seasons where he only missed one game.\nIn his great career Walter Payton rushed for an all-time career record 16,726 yards. The Bears earned a Divisional Playoff rematch with Redskins at Soldier Field. The Bears jumped out to a 14\u20130 lead early on only to see the Redskins storm back and take a 21\u201317 lead late in the game. As time was winding down on the season and Payton's career, the Bears need to score a touchdown late. The ball was in the hands of Payton who tried to extend his career, but on fourth down he was shoved out of bounds one yard short of the first down marker allowing the Redskins to run the clock out. Payton watched the rest of the game as he sat alone on the bench.\n\nIn the 1988 season the Bears kept on rolling, winning their fifth straight division title with a 12\u20134 record and earning home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. In a Divisional Playoffs game on New Year's Eve, the Bears faced the Philadelphia Eagles, and former defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan in a game that forever would be known as the \"[[Fog Bowl (American football)|Fog Bowl]]\". Late in the 2nd Quarter the fog began to roll in off [[Lake Michigan]], and at the start of the 3rd Quarter, Soldier Field was immersed in thick fog that made viewing the game impossible. The Bears emerged from the fog with a 20\u201312 victory. The victory was short-lived as the Bears lost the NFC Championship game the following week 28\u20133 to the eventual Super Bowl Champion San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe 1989 season started with a deal that sent Jim McMahon to the San Diego Chargers. The move was made as McMahon fell out of favor with Mike Ditka and the Bears front office with his behavior and repeated injuries. This gave the starting job to [[Mike Tomczak]], who had already seen considerable playing time as McMahon regularly missed games due to various injuries. The change at quarterback did not help the Bears as they finished 6\u201310 missing a sixth consecutive division title. The Bears came into the 1990 season bouncing back from a 6\u201310 season to finish in 1st Place with an 11\u20135 record. During the season, Head Coach Mike Ditka earned legendary status when he coached the team again just 10 days after a heart attack. This incident had been referenced and used several times in Bill Swerski's Superfans. However, a change in the playoff system caused the Bears a three seed to play in a wild card game to get to the Divisional Playoffs. In the first ever NFC 3 vs. 6 game the Bears defeated the New Orleans Saints, 16\u20136, to advance to a Divisional Playoff showdown against the New York Giants. The Bears were trounced 31\u20133 by the eventual Super Bowl Champion. The Bears made a return trip to the playoffs in 1991 with an 11\u20135 record in a season that saw Mike Ditka earn his 100th career-coaching win. The Bears did not win the division, but made the playoffs as a Wild Card qualifier. In the wild card round the Bears were defeated by the Dallas Cowboys, 17\u201313, in Chicago. The 1992 season saw the end of an era in Chicago. The Bears suffered their worst record of Mike Ditka's tenure, finishing 5\u201311. As a result, the Mike Ditka era ended as team president [[Mike McCaskey]] fired Ditka and hired [[Dave Wannstedt]]. Another era that ended that season came with the retirement of Hall of Famer Mike Singletary, who was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year.\n\n==1993\u20132003: The Wannstedt/Jauron years==\nFor the next 11 seasons, the Bears had a record of 76\u2013103 and posted three seasons above .500. Twice the Bears qualified for the postseason, with only one playoff win. In this same span, they placed first in their division only once.\n\n===Dave Wannstedt (1993\u20131998)===\nIn Wannstedt's first season, the Bears finished with a record of 7\u20139. During the 1993 season, the Bears played their 1,000th franchise game and won, 6\u20130, against the [[Atlanta Falcons]] at [[Soldier Field]]. The following season, the Bears put together a 9\u20137 season, and they earned a trip to the playoffs as a wild card. In the [[NFL playoffs, 1994\u201395|Wild Card]] round the Bears defeated the NFC Central Division Champion [[Minnesota Vikings]] 35\u201318. The Bears' success did not last long as they were beaten badly by the eventual Super Bowl Champion [[San Francisco 49ers]] 44\u201315 in San Francisco. In the 1995 season, the Bears again finished 9\u20137, but missed the playoffs due to a loss in a tiebreaker with the Atlanta Falcons. In the 1996 season, the Bears took a step backwards under Wannstedt and finished in third place with a record of 7\u20139.\n\nThe Bears declined further in the 1997 season, losing their first seven games toward a 4\u201312 season. One of the few highlights of the 1997 season was the Bears picking up franchise victory number 600 against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], becoming the first franchise to achieve the feat. The Bears had a setback when their October 26 game at the [[Miami Dolphins]] was pushed to the following Monday night after [[Pro Player Stadium]] was needed for game 7 of the [[1997 World Series]], but the Bears managed to come back and beat the Dolphins 36\u201333 in overtime for their first win of the season.\n\nThe 1998 season proved to be the last one for Coach Wannstedt as his Bears again finished 4\u201312. After the season, Wannstedt was fired and McCaskey reassigned by McCaskey's mother [[Virginia Halas McCaskey|Virginia]], the daughter of Halas.\n\n===Dick Jauron (1999\u20132003)===\n[[File:Brian Urlacher 2009.jpg|thumb|right|The Bears drafted [[Brian Urlacher]] in 2000.]]\nThe Bears hired [[Dick Jauron]] as their next head coach. The decade ended with Jauron's first season at 6\u201310. In the same year, [[Walter Payton]] died at the age of 45, one of the Chicago Bears and the league's greatest running backs of all time.\n\nThe Bears began the 2000 season and the new decade on a sour note. After losing their first four games, the Bears finally won their first game of the season on the road against their historic rival, the [[Green Bay Packers]]. Yet the Bears could not build off that win and lost their next three games. After the bye-week, they win against the [[Indianapolis Colts]] in Week 10. For the remaining seven games, they would win 3 games. Though the team ended the season 5\u201311, rookie linebacker [[Brian Urlacher]] was named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year.\n\nThe Bears surprised most with a breakout campaign in 2001. Apparently, this remained as the most successful season for Jauron with the Bears. After they lost their first game of the season to the [[Super Bowl XXXV]] Champion [[Baltimore Ravens]] 17\u20136 on the road, the Bears won their next six games. Two of those games were won in overtime, against the [[San Francisco 49ers]] (37\u201331) and the [[Cleveland Browns]] (27\u201321). In both games, Safety [[Mike Brown (safety)|Mike Brown]] capped remarkable comebacks (the Bears trailed 28\u20139 in the third quarter against San Francisco, and 21\u20137 with seconds remaining against Cleveland) by returning an interception in overtime for a touchdown. Unfortunately, the [[Green Bay Packers]] ended the win streak at home.\n\nFortunately, the Bears would win their next three games. However, the Bears traveled to [[Lambeau Field]] and were swept by the Packers 17\u20137. That would be their last loss of the regular season. The Bears would win their last four games. The Bears ended the regular season with a 13\u20133 record. This qualified for second place in the NFC, and thus earning a first-round bye in the playoffs.\n\nIn the divisional playoff game, the visiting [[Philadelphia Eagles]] won the game with a final score of 33\u201319. Despite their season ending on a sour note, rookie running back [[Anthony Thomas (American football)|Anthony Thomas]] won the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award. Also, coach Dick Jauron was given the Coach of the Year award.\n\nWith [[Soldier Field]] being renovated, the Chicago Bears had to play their 2002 home games at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] in Champaign, Illinois (136 miles outside Chicago). This was also the year when the [[Houston Texans]] joined the NFL and realignments were made. The Bears joined the Lions, the Packers, and the Vikings in the newly formed NFC North. The [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] leave the [[NFC Central]] to join the [[NFC South]]. The Bears even acquired former Steelers Quarterback [[Kordell Stewart|Kordell \"Slash\" Stewart]]. Despite starting the season 2\u20130, the team was plagued by injuries, and they lost their next eight games. The Bears finally got their third win of the year at home against the Lions. The Bears would lose four out of the remaining five games of the season. The Bears ended the season with a 4\u201312 record.\n\n[[File:SoliderFieldAug2004.jpg|thumb|right|[[Soldier Field]] finished reconstruction for the [[2003 Chicago Bears season|2003 campaign]].]]\nFor the 2003 campaign, the Bears were able to move back to their newly renovated Soldier Field (also known as Soldier Field II), and the team also debuted its new mascot [[Staley Da Bear]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/staley/ |title=Staley |publisher=Chicago Bears |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> Nevertheless, mediocrity continued as the Bears ended the season with a 7\u20139 record.\n\nThe Bears began the season with a 1\u20134 record by Week 5. Then Kordell Stewart lost his starting job after the Bears lost their next two road games. [[Chris Chandler]] was named their new quarterback. However, Chandler ended up playing only 4 games; winning the first 2 and losing the second 2. This allowed Kordell Stewart to reclaim his starting job; and played the next three games winning 2.\n\nLooking towards the future, the Bears allowed rookie quarterback [[Rex Grossman]] to start the last three games of the season. Grossman brought the Bears victories in their final two home games. In the end, the late showing of talent was not enough to save Dick Jauron's job. He ended up being dismissed from the Bears.\n\nThis post-Ditka decade saw an uneven effort to bring back the fiery Halas style and forge new ideas. Two coaches and various schemes came and went. Furthermore, this era was marred by a \"quarterback carousel\", where the starting job changed year after year. The hiring of GM [[Jerry Angelo]] in 2001, after 14 years of with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was viewed as a hopeful sign.\n\n==The Lovie Smith era (2004\u20132012)==\n[[File:Smith Lovie Quinnan3.jpg|thumb|Lovie Smith coached the Bears from 2004 to 2012.]]\nWith [[Lovie Smith]] (the former defensive coordinator for the [[St. Louis Rams]]) as their new head coach, the Bears made plans for their 2004 campaign. Since hiring Lovie, all personnel moves made by GM Jerry Angelo have had an overwhelming degree of success. Under Lovie Smith, the Bears have a cumulative record of 63\u201349, including two playoff wins and two playoff losses, one of which was [[Super Bowl XLI]].\n\nAt the beginning of Smith's tenure, he stated three goals:<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/team/coach.asp?coach_id=1\n|title=Hiring Lovie Smith\n|accessdate=2007-02-08\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304013359/http://www.chicagobears.com/team/coach.asp?coach_id=1\n|archive-date=March 4, 2008\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n*End Green Bay's dominance of the division\n*Win the [[NFC North|Division]]\n*Win the [[Super Bowl]]\nBy the end of 2005, the first two goals had been realized.\n\n===The new \"Monsters of the Midway\"===\nIn his inaugural year, the Bears ended their 2004 campaign at 5\u201311. For the first goal, Lovie Smith aimed to defeat their historic rival, the Green Bay Packers at [[Lambeau Field]]. However, by Week 7, the Bears recorded a poor starting record of 1\u20135, with the only win against Green Bay largely due to the Week 3 road game loss to the Minnesota Vikings. There, they lost starting quarterback Rex Grossman from a season-ending knee injury. From then on, they cycled through three different quarterbacks: [[Craig Krenzel]], [[Jonathan Quinn]], and [[Chad Hutchinson]]. After a modest three-game win streak from Week 8 to 10, the Bears capped the streak in their Week 10 (19\u201317) win over the [[Tennessee Titans]] in overtime with a safety. That was the second time in NFL history that a game ended in overtime on a safety. Afterwards, the Bears ended up losing six of the remaining seven games.\n\nIn 2005, after going 3\u20132 in the preseason (with Rex Grossman suffering a broken ankle in their preseason loss to the [[St. Louis Rams]]), the Bears named rookie QB [[Kyle Orton]] their starter, and their regular season started off poorly. The Bears began the season with a 1\u20133 record. Not even a Week 4 Bye could help them, because in Week 5, the Bears lost a hard-fought road game to [[Trent Dilfer]] and the [[Cleveland Browns]] 20\u201310.\n\nAfter the 1\u20133 start, the Bears had an eight-game winning streak, which started with two home games against Minnesota 28\u20133 and the Ravens 10\u20136. On a Week 10 home game, the visiting 49ers attempted a 52-yard field goal as time expired in the first half and the wind blew it to [[Nathan Vasher]] who was in the end zone. He returned that missed field goal 108 yards for a touchdown, the longest touchdown play in NFL history then, only to be repeated by Chicago's own [[Devin Hester]] almost exactly one year later. The eight-game winning streak came to an end on the road in a cold and snowy fight against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (21\u20139).\n\nThe Bears closed out the season with a 2\u20132 record. In Week 15, they won their last regular-season home game against the [[Atlanta Falcons]] with a final score of 16\u20133. During the game, head coach [[Lovie Smith]] replaced Kyle Orton with a fully healed Rex Grossman. In the following week, the Bears clinched the division with a dominant performance at [[Lambeau Field]] on Christmas Day (the first time the Bears ever played on Christmas). For the first time since 1991, they swept the Packers; they also secured the NFC North Division title. The Bears ended the regular season with an 11\u20135 record, enough for 2nd place in the NFC and a first-round bye in the [[2005\u201306 NFL playoffs|playoffs]]. In addition, Lovie Smith received [[NFL Coach of the Year Award|NFL Coach of the Year]] honors.\n\nIn the NFC divisional playoff game the [[Carolina Panthers]] defeated the Bears 29\u201321, ending the Bears' season. Panthers' receiver [[Steve Smith (American football, born 1979)|Steve Smith]] had 12 receptions for 218 yards and two touchdowns. The Panthers' offense dismantled the Bears' top-ranked defense. The Bears had a final chance to force overtime, but Rex Grossman's 4th-and-1 pass intended for Muhsin Muhammad fell incomplete with less than a minute to go in the game.\n\nThe Bears started the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]] by winning their first seven games, marking their best start since the [[1988 Chicago Bears season|1988 season]]. The Bears started the season by establishing a strong offense under the helm of a healthy [[Rex Grossman]]. Grossman, who was inactive for the most of his first three seasons because of injuries, earned a \"[[FedEx]] Offensive Player of the Month Award\", a 100.9 [[passer rating]] during the first month of the season. During one of the games, Grossman threw four touchdowns and earned a passer rating of 148.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/cubicle/cs-060917bearwithus,0,5590465.column |work=Chicago Tribune |title=Bear with Us \u2013 chicagotribune.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318072332/http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/cubicle/cs-060917bearwithus%2C0%2C5590465.column |archivedate=March 18, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Bears\u2019 defense also made headlines, allowing the Bears to outscore their opponents, 221\u201369 during the first two months of the season.\n\nHowever, the Bears showed a glimpse of mortality during this period. After defeating the [[Buffalo Bills]] 40\u20137, the Bears traveled to [[Glendale, Arizona]], to face the [[Arizona Cardinals|Cardinals]], where Grossman committed six turnovers in a seemingly lost effort. With less than twenty minutes remaining, the Bears\u2019 defense and special teams mounted [[2006 Chicago Bears\u2013Arizona Cardinals game|a comeback]] that allowed the team to overcome a 20-point deficit and win the game, 24\u201323.

Sports |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> where the Bears scored 41 points in the first half, tying the record by the 1940 Championship Game victory, Grossman had another turnover ridden performance against the [[Miami Dolphins]] (which reminisced the [[1985 Chicago Bears|1985 season]]), where the Bears lost 31\u201313, the most points the team allowed that season. The team bounced back with a staunch performance against the [[New York Giants]], in which [[Devin Hester]] tied Nathan Vasher's longest missed-field goal return record, and a shutout victory over the [[New York Jets]].\n\nThe Bears then traveled to [[Foxboro, Massachusetts]], where Grossman and the Bears\u2019 defense struggled to defeat the [[New England Patriots]]. Despite earning another chance to win the game, Grossman threw a game-ending interception to [[Asante Samuel]]. The following week, the Bears\u2019 defense and special teams came up big, in the wake of a struggling passing game, against the Vikings 23\u201313. The win clinched their second consecutive NFC North title, and a playoff-berth. The team began to re-establish their clockwork performance during the next three games, including a game where Devin Hester returned two kicks for touchdowns against the [[St. Louis Rams]], and an overtime thriller against the Buccaneers where Grossman threw for over 300 yards. The season ended on a low note, when the Packers defeated the Bears 26\u20137, in the regular season's finale, with Grossman leaving a [[NFL quarterbacks who have posted a passer rating of zero|passer rating of zero]].\n\nThe local media began to criticize Grossman for his inconsistent performances and shortcomings. Many fans called upon Lovie Smith to bench Grossman in favor of veteran quarterback [[Brian Griese]]. Nevertheless, Smith, who had supported Grossman throughout the season, opted to keep Grossman as the team's starter. The Bears prepared to take on the [[Seattle Seahawks]] for a second time, who had returned with a healthy [[Shaun Alexander]]. Prior to the game, Smith announced the creation of the \"Fourth Phase\", which involved using fan support as an advantage. On a dreary day along the lake-front, the Bears defeated the Seahawks, 27\u201324, on an overtime [[Robbie Gould]] field goal. The win marked the first time since [[1994 Chicago Bears season|1994 season]], that the Bears had won a playoff game.\n\n[[Image:Lion Chicago Bears Helmet.jpg|thumb|right|Many Chicago landmarks were decorated to support the Bears during Super Bowl XLI]]\nThe following week, the Bears faced the New Orleans Saints at the [[NFC Championship]], marking the Saints' first Conference Championship appearance. The Bears\u2019 defense shut down the Saints\u2019 top-ranked offense, while running backs [[Thomas Jones (American football)|Thomas Jones]] and [[Cedric Benson]] exploited the Saints\u2019 run defense for nearly 180 yards and three touchdowns. The Bears defeated the Saints, 39\u201314. The win allowed the Bears to claim the [[NFC Championship Game|George Halas Trophy]] and the right to represent the [[National Football Conference]] at [[Super Bowl XLI]] against the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. Also, Lovie Smith became the first African-American coach to lead his team to a Super Bowl. This feat was matched hours later by his mentor and friend, [[Tony Dungy]] of the Colts.\n\nThe Bears entered Super Bowl XLI as seven-point underdogs. Amidst the game's rainy weather, the Bears took the quickest lead in Super Bowl history after [[Devin Hester]] returned the game's opening kick-off for a touchdown return. Though the Bears\u2019 expanded their lead with a touchdown, the Colts struck back to take a halftime lead. The Bears\u2019 hopes for a comeback were almost thwarted when Grossman threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown. Ultimately, the Colts defeated the Bears, 29\u201317. After a productive season, the Bears returned to Chicago in hopes of replicating their success next year.\n\nSuccess was not forthcoming in 2007, which saw the Bears struggle through the season and finish 7\u20139. Legal troubles affected defensive tackle Terry \"Tank\" Johnson during the spring, and he was cut by the Bears on June 25. Defensive coordinator Ron Rivera was dropped as well after his contract with the team expired. After the Bears started the season with a 1\u20133 record, Lovie Smith benched Grossman in favor of Griese. However, injuries ravaged the team's roster, resulting in multiple inconsistent performances on defense and offense. The team finished the  season with a 7\u20139 record, one game behind the [[Detroit Lions]]. On the bright side, the Bears swept the [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] for the first time since [[2005 Chicago Bears season|2005]], including a 35\u20137 victory against the 13\u20132 Packers in Week 17.\n\nIn 2008, Lovie Smith named Kyle Orton as the team's starting quarterback. The team parted with [[Cedric Benson]], who was cut after two alcohol-related arrests. Benson was succeeded by rookie running back [[Matt Forte]], who rushed for 1,238 yards and caught 47 receptions for 438 yards. The team recorded a major victory in Week 1 in a [[Super Bowl XLI]] rematch against the Colts in [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] 29\u201313. The Bears posted a winning record again, with nine wins and seven losses, however Chicago ended up being one game behind the eventual NFC North Champion Minnesota Vikings, and failed to qualify for the playoffs after losing 31\u201324 to the [[Houston Texans]] in Week 17.\n\n===Jay Cutler trade===\n[[File:Jay Cutler - 11-01-2009.jpg|thumb|left|The Bears traded [[Kyle Orton]] and a first round pick to the [[Denver Broncos]] for [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]].]]\nDuring the 2009 off-season, Rex Grossman achieved free-agent status and left the team, signing with the [[Houston Texans]]. The Bears then traded Kyle Orton to the Broncos in exchange for QB Jay Cutler. The regular season began on a not-so-promising note, as Cutler threw 4 picks against the Packers in Week 1. However, the Bears bounced back to go 3\u20131, including a victory in Week 2 over the defending Super Bowl champion Steelers, but things fell apart quickly after the bye week, with the Bears losing eight of the next ten games, including a loss to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] where Cutler threw a career-high five interceptions, including a game-ending pick in the red-zone with less than a minute left in the game. A 31\u20137 loss to the Ravens in Week 15 mathematically eliminated them from the playoffs, but the team managed to close out the year by winning the last two matches against the Vikings (a 36\u201330 overtime win) and Lions (37\u201323) to finish 7\u20139.\n\nIn the following offseason, the Bears signed Pro Bowler [[Julius Peppers]], [[Chester Taylor]], and [[Brandon Manumaleuna]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=6595 |title=Bears ink three free agents on first day |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717080902/http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=6595 |archive-date=July 17, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=6598 |title=Free agents put the Bears closer to title |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=6599 |title=Bears' rich tradition helped lure Peppers |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=6600 |title=Bears swipe runner from division rival |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=6601 |title=Manumaleuna back with Smith, Martz |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=6603 |title=Peppers, Taylor are happy to join forces |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=6604 |title=Martz excited about free-agent signings |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> In Week 1, they hosted the Lions and won 19\u201314 after a controversial call.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jerry Reth |url=http://sports.spreadit.org/calvin-johnson-catch-touchdown-overturned-1597/ |title=Calvin Johnson Catch \u2013 Touchdown Overturned |publisher=Sports.spreadit.org |date=September 13, 2010 |accessdate=2012-08-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114063124/http://sports.spreadit.org/calvin-johnson-catch-touchdown-overturned-1597/ |archive-date=January 14, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Next, the Bears traveled to Dallas and beat the Cowboys 27\u201320. On Monday Night Football in Week 3, the Packers came to town and lost 20\u201317 after a mass of penalties (18 total), putting the Bears up at 3\u20130. However, that ended in Week 4 when the team suffered a 17\u20133 loss to the Giants on the road.  Jay Cutler was sacked multiple times and suffered a concussion. Veteran free agent quarterback [[Todd Collins (quarterback)|Todd Collins]] replaced Cutler, but was also quickly injured. Third-string quarterback [[Caleb Hanie]] played the remainder of the game.\n\nAfter this loss, the Bears had an easy road win over the 0\u20135 Carolina Panthers before another 23\u201320 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Continued difficulties with the offense and O-line led to a second straight home loss when the Redskins won 17\u201314 in Week 7. After the bye week, offensive coordinator Mike Martz worked to revamp the offense to compensate for Jay Cutler's lack of O-line protection. After this, they easily beat the struggling Vikings at home 27\u201313, followed by a 16\u20130 shutout of the Dolphins in Miami, handing Chicago their 700th win, a league first.\n\nIn Week 12, the Bears hosted Philadelphia for the second season in a row and won 31\u201327, while also preserving the franchise's perfect record against Eagles QB Michael Vick (who after the game had a 0\u20135 all-time record playing them). After beating the Lions in Detroit on more questionable officiating, Chicago next suffered a total collapse at home against New England in a blowing snowstorm (the Patriots won 36\u20137).\n\nThe next week saw the Bears drawn into the turmoil of the Vikings' 2010 season. As the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome's inflatable roof had collapsed the week before, the two teams had to play at TCF Bank Stadium at the University of Minnesota campus in frigid winter weather. Despite being a nominal home game for the Vikings, they were not a team prepared for outdoor play and Chicago overwhelmed them 40\u201314. It was here that Brett Favre took his final snap in the NFL after he was knocked into the frozen ground and suffered a concussion, ending a 20-year career that included 297 consecutive starts.\n\nAfterwards, the Bears returned home and beat the Jets 38\u201334 in a shootout<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82002700/article/no-12-bears-outlast-jets-in-wildly-entertaining-showdown?module=HP_cp2 |title=news: No. 12: Bears outlast Jets in wildly entertaining showdown |publisher=Nfl.com |date=May 25, 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> before traveling to the \"Frozen Tundra\" of Lambeau Field for Week 17. Their arch-rival only needed to lose this game to be removed from playoff contention, and so Lovie Smith decided to play Chicago's starters. He also apparently ran generic plays to avoid giving anything away to the Packers for the playoffs, but the offense again sputtered and Green Bay won a 10\u20133 defensive struggle to secure a wild card playoff berth.\n\nThroughout the season, the Bears' offense and O-line were rated in the NFL's bottom ten and the team mainly depended on special teams (especially Devin Hester's duties as a punt returner) and an aging, but still effective defense led by DE Julius Peppers (acquired from Carolina during the off-season) and LB Brian Urlacher.\n\nAlthough the Bears' own playoff chances were unharmed by the loss in Green Bay (they had already gotten the No. 2 NFC seed and a first-round bye with their 11\u20135 regular season record), that game ultimately proved fatal because of their inability to remove the Packers from postseason contention.\n\nAfter the Seahawks gained a surprise division title with a 7\u20139 regular season record and an even more miraculous playoff victory over the defending champion Saints, they headed to Chicago in the divisional round. However, there was no repeat of Week 6 this time. On a gray, fog-shrouded winter afternoon, Jay Cutler threw two TD passes as the Bears overpowered their opponent 35\u201324 to advance to the NFC Championship.\n\nThe Packers meanwhile had beaten the Eagles and Falcons in the playoffs to head to Soldier Field for what was only the second-ever postseason meeting between them and the Bears (the first was in 1941). To everyone's surprise, Green Bay marched out to an early lead as Chicago's offense struggled. During the third quarter, Jay Cutler was pulled with a knee injury and replaced by Todd Collins, who was benched after only two minutes of play. Caleb Hanie came in and tried to rally the team, but hammered by the Packers defense, threw a fatal interception that was caught by nose tackle B.J. Raji and returned for a touchdown. Although Hanie subsequently belted a 35-yard TD pass, Green Bay's defense held on to win the game 21\u201314, advance to [[Super Bowl XLV]], and ultimately win the championship.\n\nJay Cutler was widely blamed for a disastrous end to the Bears' miracle season and after the NFC Championship by fans, as well as players like [[Maurice Jones-Drew]], some fans burned Cutler jerseys.<ref>[http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/dpp/sports/jay-cutler-injury-criticism-jan-24-2011 Jay Cutler Criticism Surge After Leaving NFC Championship Game] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128234527/http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/dpp/sports/jay-cutler-injury-criticism-jan-24-2011 |date=January 28, 2011 }}</ref> Critics argued that he did not show any indication that his knee injury was serious enough to keep him out of the game and that he had been riding an exercise bike during the rest of the game.

In the interest of ticket sales and crowning a yearly champion, they decided to form the American Professional Football Association, which changed its name to [[National Football League]] (NFL) in 1922. On October 3, 1920, the Staleys played their first NFL game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/chicago/bears.html |title=Chicago Bears (1920\u2013Present) |publisher=Sportsecyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> Official team and league records cite Halas as the team's founder as he took over the team in 1920 when it became a charter member of the NFL.<ref>{{cite web | title = George Halas: Hall of Fame Member | work = Pro Football Hall of Fame | url = http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=85 | accessdate = May 14, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Decatur Staleys===\n[[File:Decatur staleys 1920.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 1920 Decatur Staleys.]]\n[[George Halas]], then the player-coach of A.E. Staley's Decatur Staleys, was among the driving forces of this meeting, which gave birth to what is now the NFL. In their first season as part of the Association, the Staleys won 10 games, all by shutouts, but lost the first league championship to the [[Akron Pros]], who finished the season unbeaten at 8\u20130\u20133. There was no official scheduling in the 1920 season, which accounted for the difference in the number of games played that season. <!--before pro-football Halas had played for the [[New York Yankees]] in baseball, and was replaced in the outfield by [[Babe Ruth]] in 1920.

In the Cardinals 7\u20136 victory over the Staleys in their first meeting of the season, each team scored a TD on a fumble recovery, with the Staleys failing their XP try. George Halas' 1920 Staleys went on to a 10\u20131\u20132 record overall, 5\u20131\u20132 in league play. The 1920 Akron Pros were the first ever league champions; they finished with an 8\u20130\u20133 record, 6\u20130\u20133 in league play, ending their season in a 0\u20130 tie against the Decatur Staleys. Because the Staleys had lost to the Racine (Chi) Cardinals earlier that year, the Pros could simply play the final game not to lose; they wisely did and became champions. The Staleys loss to the Cardinals began a long-standing rivalry between the franchises.\n\nHad the Staleys won, there would have been a three-way tie among the Staleys, the Buffalo All-Americans (9\u20131\u20131 in 1920, 4\u20131\u20131 in league play) and the Pros, each team having one loss. Each team likely would have played more games (as it was allowed under the rules in those days) to allow teams to settle parity at the top of the standings.\n\n===First years in Chicago===\n[[File:George Halas.jpg|thumb|right|170px|George Halas as player-coach of the Chicago Bears during the 1922 season.]]\nThe Staleys moved to Chicago from [[Decatur, Illinois]] in 1921. Halas, who was given the team and $5000 by Staley to keep the name Staleys for another year, made the move. In the 1921 season, the '''Chicago Staleys''' finished first in the league and captured their [[1921 NFL season|first league championship]].\n\nIn 1922, [[George Halas|Halas]] changed the team name to the '''Bears''' to reflect baseball's [[Chicago Cubs]], the team's host at [[Wrigley Field]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chicagoist.com/2007/01/31/ask_chicagoist_why_are_they_called_the_bears.php |title=Ask Chicagoist: Why Are They Called the Bears? |last=Exoo |first=Thales |publisher=[[Gothamist]] |date=31 January 2007 |website=Chicagoist |access-date=19 December 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510153921/http://chicagoist.com/2007/01/31/ask_chicagoist_why_are_they_called_the_bears.php |archivedate=May 10, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Over the next few years, the Bears were ranked among the elite teams in the [[National Football League|NFL]], but could never capture an NFL Championship because the league did not have a playoff system. Instead it had a somewhat controversial scheduling formula, which led to uneven standings and controversial champions.{{Ref|pottsville}} The highlight of the decade was [[George Halas]]'s unprecedented move to sign [[Red Grange]] for $100,000 in 1925. In 1925, professional football was viewed negatively by Americans, as most Americans loved [[college football]] which they saw as a pure sport. Halas, though, took the Bears on a 17-game road trip across America to highlight Grange. The tour began on Thanksgiving at [[Wrigley Field]] as the [[Chicago Cardinals]] held the Galloping Ghost to just 36 yards in his professional debut, the city rivals battling to a 0\u20130 tie. However, during the tour that continued through January 31, the Bears posted an impressive 11\u20134\u20132 record.\n\nThis road trip impressed many Americans, boosting the prospects of many debt-ridden teams such as the [[New York Giants]]. Grange left the Bears after a contract dispute in 1926 and moved to establish his own league, the first incarnation of the [[American Football League (1926)|American Football League]]. That league folded after one season and Grange's [[New York Yankees (NFL)|New York Yankees]] were admitted into the [[National Football League|NFL]]. Grange injured his knee in his first game against the Bears in 1927 and was forced to sit out the 1928 season. He returned to Chicago in 1929, but the Bears ended the decade with a losing season as Halas retired as player and coach of the Bears and appointed [[Ralph Jones]] as his successor.\n\n===The thirties===\n[[Image:1932Bears.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Team photo of the Bears, 1932 league champions.]]\nThe Bears of the 1930s were remembered for being led by a ferocious tandem of [[Bronko Nagurski]] and [[Red Grange]], playing in the newly established NFL Championship Game four times and claiming the league title twice.\n\nAfter completing the 1930 season with a record of 9\u20134\u20131, the Bears and [[Arizona Cardinals|Cardinals]] played in the first indoor football game on December 15 at [[Chicago Stadium]] in a charity game for those affected by the [[Great Depression]]. Due to the size limitations of the indoor arena, the length of the football field was only 80 yards. The Bears beat their city rivals 9\u20137. In the 1932 season, the Bears and [[Portsmouth Spartans]] tied for first place in the league. The teams played an [[1932 NFL Playoff Game|\"unofficial\" championship playoff game]],{{Ref|1932playoff}} held on December 18 at [[Chicago Stadium]]. The Bears won the game 9\u20130 and captured the NFL Championship before 11,198 fans.\n\nThe popularity of the game prompted the NFL to institute various rule changes for the 1933 season, including the splitting of the league into two geographical divisions and the establishment of an officially scheduled championship game to determine the NFL champion.\n\nIn 1933, George Halas made his return to coaching the Bears. Halas led the Bears to win the first ever Western Division title and the first ever NFL Championship Game. The Bears again captured the championship in a nail biter against the [[New York Giants]], 23\u201321 as Red Grange made the game-winning tackle. In 1934, the Bears dominated the league and finished 13\u20130, but were denied perfection, losing 30\u201313 to the Giants in the [[1934 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship]], what became known as the \"Sneakers Game.\"\n\nThe Bears would play in the Championship game two more times in the decade, losing both of them. In 1935 and 1936, the Bears remained somewhat competitive, but failed to qualify for the Championship Game. In 1937, the Bears made a return trip to the NFL Championship, but fell short as [[Sammy Baugh]] and the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] won, 28\u201321. In 1938, the Bears fell off the NFL map, with a record of 6\u20135. The Bears finished off the 1930s on a down note, losing twice to the [[Green Bay Packers]] in 1939.\n\nDuring the late 1930s George Halas and [[University of Chicago]] football coach [[Clark Shaughnessy]] collaborated on a revolutionary approach to the offense and the quarterback position. The result was the [[T formation|T-formation offense]] and the first evolution of the modern quarterback. A complex scheme that required an athletic player with quick decision skills led Halas to recruit [[Columbia University]] quarterback [[Sid Luckman]]. He turned the position into an engine for a high powered and time-consuming scoring machine.\n\n===Dynasty: Monsters of the Midway===\n[[Image:1946Bears.jpg|thumb|left|1946 Chicago Bears champion team.]]\n[[File:T Formation.svg|thumb|right|The [[T-formation]] that the Bears innovated in their 73\u20130 win over Washington.]]\nFrom 1940 to 1946, the Bears were considered a dynasty. In these years, the nickname [[Monsters of the Midway]] was first attributed to the Bears. In this span, the Bears went to 5 championships and won 4 of them. This is despite George Halas temporarily leaving the organization to serve in World War II, from 1943 to 1945.\n\nIn the 1940 [[NFL Championship]], Halas introduced his T-formation offense, with [[Sid Luckman]] at quarterback.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=135\n|title=Sid Luckman Hall of Fame\n|accessdate=2007-02-08\n}}</ref> This formation shocked and confused the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] all day as the Bears won 73\u20130, an NFL record that stands to this day. The T-formation was soon widely copied at the college and pro levels.\n\nIn 1941, the Bears and [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] battled to a 10\u20131\u20130 tie for 1st place in the Western Division. Since the teams split their two regular season match-ups, which turned out to be each team's only loss of the season, a one-game playoff was set up. The Bears won 33\u201314, moving on to rout the [[New York Giants|Giants]] 37\u20139 in the NFL Championship.\n\nIn 1942, the Bears started the season off well before Halas departed for World War II; 45 Bears players also joined the war effort,<ref>{{cite web|last=Boden|first=Chris|url=http://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/chicago-bears/history-bears-who-served-during-world-war-ii|title=A history of the Bears who served during World War II|publisher=[[Comcast SportsNet Chicago]]|date=May 29, 2017|accessdate=January 7, 2018}}</ref> resulting in a roster shortage that nearly led to the Bears merging with the Cardinals in 1943.<ref>{{cite book|last=Algeo|first=Matthew|date=September 1, 2013|title=Last Team Standing: How the Steelers and the Eagles\u2014\"The Steagles\"\u2014Saved Pro Football During World War II|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]|isbn=1613748884|pages=48\u201349}}</ref> His handpicked successors [[Hunk Anderson]] and [[Luke Johnsos]] ran the team for the next three years until Halas returned. The Bears finished the regular season 11\u20130 and played the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] in the Championship game. The Redskins spoiled the Bears attempt at a perfect season; with a 14\u20136 upset preventing the Bears from [[three-peat]]ing. In the 1943 season, the Bears dominated the Western Division behind the quarterbacking of Luckman, who threw for 433 yards and seven TDs that season in a single game versus the [[New York Giants]]. In the Championship Game, the Redskins were no challenge to the Bears as the crowd of 34,320 at [[Wrigley Field]] watched the Bears win 41\u201321 behind Sid Luckman's five TDs and Nagurski's final TD run.\n\nThe Bears' domination of the NFL took a slight fall in as the Bears posted a mediocre result in 1944 and a losing season in 1945. \"Papa Bear\" Halas made a return to the Bears in 1946. The Bears were able to find their old magic again, with many players returning from service in the war, finishing the regular season 8\u20132\u20131 to claim another Western Division title and a return trip to the Championship game. The Bears won their last Championship of the decade over the [[New York Giants]], 24\u201314, before a then [[NFC Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]] record crowd of 58,346 at the [[Polo Grounds]] in New York. This was the Bears' last Championship for the next 16 years.\n\n==Middle years: The rough years (1947\u20131981)==\nDuring this span of 34 seasons, the Bears had a combined record of 237\u2013224\u20139. Seventeen of those seasons finished with a record of .500 or better. Out of those 17 seasons, they won the NFL Western Division twice. Also, they qualified for the playoffs only five times, while losing the [[1956 NFL Championship Game|1956 NFL Championship]] and then winning the [[1963 NFL Championship Game|1963 NFL Championship]]. Despite these rough years, players like [[Gale Sayers]] and [[Dick Butkus]] thrived in their careers.\n\n===The decline from the top===\nIn 1947, The Bears got off to a slow start by losing their first two games. The team rebounded however and quickly ran off an eight-game winning streak to get back into the race for first place in the Western Division. After losing to the [[Los Angeles Rams]] 17\u201314 in the second to last game of the season, the Bears and [[Chicago Cardinals]] faced off in the final game of the season, with the Western Division title on the line. Despite it being a home game for the Bears at [[Wrigley Field]] the Cardinals came in and would stun the Bears 30\u201321 en route to the [[1947 in sports|1947 NFL Championship]]. In 1948, for the second season in a row, the Bears put together another great regular season but fell short to their inner city rival Cardinals. The Bears posted a 10\u20132 record, but lost a key game against the Cardinals that gave them the Western Division Championship.\n\nIn 1949, The Bears continued to be one of the best teams in the NFL. However, they fell one game short of making the Championship game again. The Bears' success continued into 1950 as they began the new decade in style by finishing 9\u20133, which was good enough to earn them a tie for the Western Division with the [[Los Angeles Rams]] and play in the Conference Playoff against them. However, the Bears were unable to slow down the high-powered Ram offense in a 24\u201314 loss in Los Angeles as the Rams advanced to the NFL Championship Game.\n\nIn 1951, The Bears got off to a streaking start winning five of their first six games. The magic faded in the second half as they collapsed, winning just 2 of their final 6 games as they finished in 4th place in the conference with a mediocre record of 7\u20135. In the 1952 season, the Bears' defense struggled all season as they allowed a wretched 326 points and the team finished below .500 for the first time since 1945, finishing in 5th place with a record of 5\u20137. The team's struggles continued into 1953 as most of their superstars from the 1940s dynasty were now retired the Bears finished 3\u20138\u20131, and, for the first time in team history, the Bears posted back-to-back losing seasons. One notable occurrence in the 1953 season was that the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s first modern era African-American quarterback, [[Willie Thrower]] played in his 1st and only game against the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. Like Thrower's career in the NFL, the Bears troubles were short lived, as they rose up in 1954 to the Bears of old. The team got back into the league playoff picture by posting a solid record of 8\u20134, good enough for 2nd place in the division, but not an appearance in the Championship game.\n\nIn 1955, the team posted a second consecutive 8\u20134 season, 2nd place again, as Head Coach [[George Halas]] called it quits for the third time in his coaching career. Halas replaced himself with former team standout [[Paddy Driscoll]]. Driscoll's success would be highlighted in his first season with the team. In 1956, [[Paddy Driscoll]] led the Bears to put together a solid 9\u20132\u20131 season and to beat out fellow Midwest rival [[Detroit Lions]] by a half a game for the 1956 Western Division Championship. The magical season though ended sourly as the Bears were no match for the [[New York Giants]] in the [[1956 in sports|1956 NFL Championship]], as the Bears were blasted in a 47\u20137 rout in New York City. The magic of the championship season was short lived though as in 1957 the Bears dropped from first to below .500 with a 5\u20137 record. This prompted Halas to quickly fire Driscoll and return to the sidelines.\n\nIn George Halas's return to the sidelines in 1958, the Bears rebounded off the disappointing losing season by challenging for the Western Division Championship all season before faltering at the end and finishing in a second place tie with an 8\u20134 record, one game away from the Championship Game. The Bears closed out the decade in 1959 with yet another 8\u20134 finish that was only good enough for second place in the division.  The 1950s gave way to Bear greats such as Ed \"The Claw\" Sprinkle, [[Bill George (American football player)|Bill George]], [[George Connor (American football)|George Connor]], and Harlon Hill.\n\nThe end of the decade also marked the first time in team history that the Bears did not win an NFL Championship during a decade.  This was a sign of the downfall that the Bears were about to encounter. Halas, always the resilient innovator, found a young assistant in [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]]. A tireless and detail oriented young coach, Allen quickly created innovations such as thick play books for training camps, the first glimpses of deceptive schemes and exhaustive research for the NFL draft. With the support of George Halas, Allen turned the draft into a windfall for future Hall of Fame talent.\n\n===One more championship for Halas===\n[[Image:Dickbutkus.jpg|170px|thumb|right|[[Dick Butkus]] was one of the most dominating of the Bears players.]]\nThe Bears started off the 1960s as the only team in Chicago, as the Cardinals decided to move to St Louis.  As for the 1960 season, the Bears finished a disappointing 5\u20136\u20131 in 5th place in the NFL Western Conference.  In the 1961 season, the Bears rebounded off a losing season to finish in 4th place in the conference with a record of 8\u20136 as rookie tight end [[Mike Ditka]] made an instant impact by collecting 1,076 receiving yards and 12 TDs, and setting a club record for rookies with 56 receptions, while winning the [[NFL Rookie of the Year Award]]. The Bears also made their first trip out of American soil into Canada to take on the [[Canadian Football League|CFL's]] [[Montreal Alouettes]] (the original franchise), with the Bears proving to be the better team, winning 34\u201316.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?STORY_ID=7241 |title=Bears played game in Canada in 1961 |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824145437/http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?STORY_ID=7241 |archive-date=August 24, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The 1962 season brought on for the second straight season a rookie who made an immediate impact with the team. [[Ronnie Bull (American football)|Ron Bull]] won the [[NFL Rookie of the Year Award]] as the Bears finished in 3rd place in the Conference with a solid 9\u20135 record.\n\nThe Bears' rookie success hit a pinnacle in 1963 as the Bears broke the [[Green Bay Packers]]' three-year stranglehold on the Western Division and the NFL by posting an 11\u20131\u20132 record. In the [[NFC Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]] at [[Wrigley Field]], the Bears battled the [[New York Giants]] in front of 45,801 fans on a bone-chilling afternoon. The Bears won their eighth NFL Championship, 14\u201310 as [[Bill Wade]] scored both Bear touchdowns. However, the star of the game was the Bears' dominating defense, which intercepted Giants star QB [[Y. A. Tittle]] a stunning 5 times. The following season the Bears followed up their NFL Championship with an underachieving 5\u20139 season. This poor performance prompted Halas to search for young talent in the upcoming draft. He selected the \"Kansas Comet\" RB [[Gale Sayers]] and LB [[Dick Butkus]] in the first round of the draft to improve both the offense and defense.\n\nThe 1965 season proved to be yet another year where a rookie Bear made an impact as Sayers won the NFL Rookie of the Year Award, while establishing a new NFL record with 22 touchdowns during the season, still a club record. His record season and his entire career would be highlighted by his six-touchdown performance against the San Francisco 49ers at Wrigley Field on December 12. The new element of Sayers helped the Bears to finish in 3rd place with a 9\u20134\u20131 record. Sayers continued his offensive successes in 1966 with a then-NFL record 2,440 all-purpose yards, but his offensive success did not result in wins and the team finished with a 5\u20137\u20132 season. Meanwhile, Mike Ditka abruptly retired from playing at the end of the season, dissatisfied with Halas's unwillingness to spend money on talent. He went to Dallas and became an assistant coach under Tom Landry.\n1967 not only saw the first Super Bowl in the NFL, but also 47 years after his first season, George Halas (now 72) retired for the final time with a then-NFL record 324 coaching wins, which stood until 1993 when Don Shula broke the record. In Papa Bear's final season, the team played respectably with a 7\u20136\u20131 record and a second-place finish in the Central Division. Halas claimed that he didn't retire from coaching because of his age, but because the old hip injury he had sustained as a baseball player made it almost impossible for him to stand on the sidelines during games.\n\nHalas's replacement was [[Jim Dooley]]. In Dooley's first season at the helm of the team, the Bears finished with a 7\u20137 record. The low point of the season, though, was not the mediocre performance but a career threatening knee injury to Gale Sayers, from which he never fully recovered. The decade though was highlighted with the 1969 season. After Sayers's injury, back-up running back [[Brian Piccolo]] did not believe he deserved the job because of the injury. Instead of running away with his opportunity as most athletes would, Piccolo, who was a popular figure in the Chicago area and roomed with Sayers for a few years on road trips, during the entire off-season pushed Sayers to get his knee back into football playing shape. Sayers got back into the lineup, and Piccolo was back on the bench when the season started. Sayers rushed for 1,000 yards and earned the [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award]]. This was the ultimate display of friendship between Piccolo and Sayers, who were friends despite race differences within society during the 1960s. The Bears finished the season, even with Sayers's performance, with a franchise-worst 1\u201313 record. The Bears' hopes worsened due to the fact that they had the No. 2 pick, while the Steelers had the first overall pick (with the Bears defeating them), allowing Pittsburgh to draft future Hall-of-Famer [[Terry Bradshaw]].\n\nThe horror of the season came when [[Brian Piccolo]] started suffering breathing problems. A hospital physical revealed his worst fear: lung cancer. On June 16, 1970 just 7 months after being diagnosed, Piccolo lost his battle with lung cancer at the age of 26. The Bears responded by setting up the Brian Piccolo Cancer Research Fund, which raises money through various annual events for cancer research. In November 1971, ABC premiered the TV Movie entitled \"[[Brian's Song]].\" The film starred [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]] as Piccolo and [[Billy Dee Williams]] as Gale Sayers detailing the friendship between the two Bear running backs. A heartfelt and sad story that evolves would go down as one of the most beloved sports movies of all time.\n\n===After AFL\u2013NFL merger and the move to Soldier Field===\nThe 1970s began with the end of an era for the entire league, especially for the Bears. The sport, which once lagged behind baseball and college football in terms of popularity, was beginning a huge rise since the advent of the Super Bowl. Due to this, bigger venues were needed to support the fan base. The home of the Cubs had been the Bears home field for nearly 50 years; but after the merger the NFL required all stadiums to seat at least 50,000. The Bears finished off their tenure at Wrigley Field on December 13 by winning against the rival Green Bay Packers (35\u201317). In doing so, the Bears finished in 4th place in the NFC Central with a record of 6\u20138.\n\nThe new home of the Bears was another classic stadium in itself; [[Soldier Field]], built in the 1920s as a memorial for World War I veterans and was the host of many great sports events including Jack Dempsey vs. Gene Tunney in 1927 and various college football games such as annual Army-Navy matches.\n\nIn their first home game at Soldier Field, the Bears emerged victorious defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers (17\u201315). The victory was short-lived as the Bears finished 6\u20138 leading to the termination of head coach Jim Dooley. New Coach Abe Gibron did not start his tenure any better with the Bears. The team was last place in the NFC Central division with a record of 4\u20139\u20131. The era under Gibron took a deeper dive during the 1973 season as the team finished in last place again with a record of 3\u201311 as the Bears were limited to just 195 total points during the entire season. Dick Butkus, who had terrorized enemy offensive players for the last eight years, retired early in the season after being hobbled by knee injuries. The 1974 season proved to be Gibron's final one with the Bears as the team finished yet again in last place, this time with a record of 4\u201310. The Gibron era was marked with a combined record of 11\u201330\u20131 and with the only memory was not a play or moment, but Gibron's appearance in an NFL Films production where he was taped singing \"Joy to the World\", not paying attention to the game in front of him.\n\n===Building for a championship===\nIn 1975, the rebuilding of the Bears fell to Hall of Fame GM [[Jim Finks]] who brought in [[Jack Pardee]] to coach. This was the first time in franchise history that the Bears hired a head coach who was not associated with the franchise. The move did not have any initial impact as the team finished 4\u201310. The best move of the year was the drafting of RB [[Walter Payton]] in the first Round. Known as \"Sweetness\", he eventually would become one of the Bears' greatest players ever. The string of losing seasons ended in 1976 with Pardee's coaching and the running of Walter Payton who rushed for 1,390 yards while scoring 13 TDs. The Bears posted a 7\u20137 record, which was good enough for 2nd place. In his 3rd season, Payton had a breakout year, rushing for a team record 1,852 yards highlighted by a single-game performance of 275 yards, which established a single game record that would stand for the next two decades.\n\n[[File:Chicago Bears at St Louis Cardinals 9 25 77.jpg|thumb|left|The Bears in a 1977 game against the [[St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis Cardinals]] at [[Busch Memorial Stadium]]]]\nThat year Payton captured both [[NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award]] and the [[NFL MVP Award]]. Behind the running of Payton, the Bears won their final six games to finish second with a 9\u20135 record, which was good enough for the NFC's Wild Card spot. The Bears though were outpowered and overmatched in their first playoff game since 1963 as the eventual [[Super Bowl XI|Super Bowl Champion]] Cowboys defeated them 37\u20137 in Dallas.  At the end of the season, Pardee left the Bears to take over the coaching reins of the [[Washington Redskins]].  The Bears replaced Pardee with [[Minnesota Vikings]] Defensive coordinator [[Neill Armstrong]]. Armstrong's first season proved to be a step backwards from their playoff appearance with a 7\u20139 showing. The Bears would be more successful in the 1979 season, but tragedy struck the team as the Bears were celebrating their playoff berth.\n\nOn December 16 as the Bears earned that spot on the final day of the season with a 42\u20136 victory over the [[St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis Cardinals]], team president George \"Mugs\" Halas Jr. died of a massive heart attack at the age of 54. \"Mugs\", the son of the legendary Bears founder George Halas, had served as the president since 1953. The Bears had to regroup quickly as they would face the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in the [[1979\u201380 NFL playoffs|Wild Card Game]] at Philadelphia a week later. The Bears held a 17\u201310 lead in the early moments of the second half only to see the Eagles soar back, moving on to the next round with a 27\u201317 victory.  The Bears did not return to the playoffs again under Armstrong and in 1980, they fell below .500 with a 7\u20139 record (despite some seminal moments in Bear lore). On October 6, 1980, Payton broke the Bears all-time franchise all-purpose yardage total previously held by [[Gale Sayers]]'s with 9,462 career yards. On Thanksgiving in Detroit, [[Dave Williams (American football)|Dave Williams]] took the overtime kickoff 95 yards for a TD, setting an NFL record for the fastest end to an OT, and on December 7 the Bears ripped the Green Bay Packers 61\u20137, the biggest margin of victory in the series. Armstrong lasted just one more year with the Bears, finishing with a last place showing and a 6\u201310 record.  He was fired in the off-season.\n\nBy the end of the 1970s the beginnings of a front office brain trust was in place. general manager Jim Finks was building the foundation of a championship team. Scout Bill Tobin had a knack for finding overlooked talent in the NFL draft. Defensive Coordinator Buddy Ryan was beginning to formulate his revolutionary \"46 Defense.\" As with earlier innovations involving the T-formation with Clark Shaughnessy and later creative ideas with George Allen, the pieces began to fit into place for a championship run.\n\nAlso, in [[1976 Chicago Bears season|1976]], the Bears debuted the team's [[National Football League Cheerleading|cheerleading squad]] called the [[Chicago Honey Bears|Honey Bears]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor |first=Roy |url=http://www.bearshistory.com/sidelines/chicagohoneybears.aspx/ |title=The Honey Bears and Chicago Bears Mascots |publisher=Bearshistory.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> Despite the squad's success, Halas's daughter [[Virginia Halas McCaskey]] terminated the group in 1985, after [[Super Bowl XX]], starting claims of a \"Honey Bear Curse\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/296096-come-to-think-of-it-the-curse-of-the-honey-bears |title=Come To Think of It: The Curse of the Honey Bears |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=November 24, 2009 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, the Bears was notable for crushing the Packers 61\u20137 in the most one-sided game in the history of the [[Bears-Packers rivalry]].\n\nEarly in 1982, George Halas summoned [[Mike Ditka]] back from Dallas and offered him the head coaching job, which he accepted.\n\n==The Ditka era: Bears renaissance (1982\u20131992)==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#b0c4de; width:20em;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"Give me three years, and if you walk with me, we'll go to the dance.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" | ~'''''[[Mike Ditka]]'s''''' first words to the team<ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor |first=Roy |url=http://www.bearshistory.com/lore/mikeditka.aspx |title=Mike Ditka Biography |publisher=Bearshistory.com |date=October 18, 1939 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref>\n|}\nFrom 1982 to 1992 under coach [[Mike Ditka]], the Bears recorded a record of 112-68.  After George Halas, Ditka became the second Bears coach to record more than 100 wins as coach.  In addition, the Bears won 6 Division titles and made three trips to the NFC Championship game.  The peak of this era was the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Bears season]] where they won [[Super Bowl XX]].\n\nThe 1982 season was Mike Ditka's first season as head coach of the Bears, and he began his rebuilding program by drafting Jim McMahon from Brigham Young University with the intention of his being a franchise QB. The season was interrupted by a players' strike and shortened to nine games. As a result, the NFL held a special playoff tournament involving the top eight teams in both conferences. The Bears did not qualify for the postseason, finishing in 12th place with a 3\u20136 record. In the spring of 1983, George Halas died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 88. He was the last surviving NFL founder. The death of Halas also brought the addition of the initials \"GSH\" on the left sleeve of the Bears uniforms. With Halas's passing, his daughter Virginia McCaskey and her husband Mike McCaskey assumed ownership of the team. In Ditka's second season, the Bears improved and finished with a record of 8\u20138. The 1983 draft was a critical one as it saw the core of the Bears' 1985 championship team arrive.\n\nIn 1984, [[Walter Payton]] broke [[Jim Brown]]'s all-time career rushing record (which pleased Brown, who had threatened to come out of retirement if [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] running back [[Franco Harris]] broke the record\u2014Brown disliked Harris's tendency to run out of bounds to avoid oncoming rushers <ref>{{cite web | title = JIM BROWN'S BAD DREAM | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/21/sports/jim-brown-s-bad-dream.html | accessdate = June 5, 2019 }}</ref>). Payton's record stood for eighteen years until it was broken by [[Emmitt Smith]] in 2002. The Bears finished the season with a 10\u20136 record to win their first [[NFC Central]] Division Championship. Even though the Bears won the division, they struggled toward the end of the season, which cost them a playoff home game. Instead, in the [[1984\u201385 NFL playoffs|Divisional Playoffs]] the Bears played the Washington Redskins at RFK stadium, ending the Redskins' quest for a third straight Super Bowl appearance with a 23\u201319 victory. The Bears advanced to the [[NFC Championship]] to play the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. The 49ers shut the Bears out 23\u20130 on their way to a [[Super Bowl XIX|Super Bowl Championship]], and also humiliated the Bears by sending in guard [[Guy McIntyre]] to play fullback.\n\n===1985: Super Bowl champions===\n1985 is the most celebrated year in Bears history. Through various rankings, the 1985 Bears have been marked as one of the top 5 NFL teams of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/football/teams/greatest.html\n|title=ESPN NFL 10 Greatest All Time Teams\n|accessdate=2008-02-08\n|work=ESPN.com\n}}</ref> The Bears beat the first 12 of their opponents.

The season brought players to the national spotlight such as [[William Perry (American football)|William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry]], [[Mike Singletary]], [[Jim McMahon]], [[Dan Hampton]], and [[Walter Payton]]. During the season, in Week 3, McMahon had back spasms, and when the Bears were trailing the [[Minnesota Vikings]], and eventually, the McMahon-led Bears stunned the Vikings in ''The Viking Miracle''<ref>{{cite web|last=Ditka |first=Mike |url=http://www.windycitygridiron.com/2010/1/28/1274047/hey-lets-check-out-the-viking |title=Hey-Let's check out the Viking Miracle (McMahon owns the Vikings) |publisher=Windy City Gridiron |date=January 28, 2010 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> Eventually, in Week 9, the Bears themselves embarrassed the 49ers 26\u201310, sacking [[Joe Montana]] a then-record 7 times, and the Bears claimed their revenge by sending Perry in, but instead of as a mere blocker like McIntyre, Ditka used him as a runner. The Bears also handed the Cowboys their worst loss in franchise history in Week 11 44\u20130, clinching the division for Chicago. Then, in the Week 12 game on Monday Night Football, the Bears suffered their only defeat, a 38\u201324 loss to the Miami Dolphins, who in doing so retained their status as the lone team to have ever had a perfect season. Chicago afterwards produced a music video called ''[[The Super Bowl Shuffle]]''. The Bears were also divided, as Head Coach [[Mike Ditka]] and Defensive Coordinator [[Buddy Ryan]] did not see eye to eye. In the [[1985\u201386 NFL playoffs|Divisional Playoffs]] the Bears played the [[New York Giants]], shutting them out 21\u20130, on a bitterly cold and windy afternoon. The Bears then faced the [[Los Angeles Rams]] in the [[NFC Championship]] Game. This game too was a shutout, the score being 24\u20130. The \"Monsters of the Midway\" advanced to the Super Bowl.\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 11 - Jim McMahon.jpg|thumb|right|The Bears making a rushing play in the end zone against the Patriots during Super Bowl XX.]]\nIn [[Super Bowl XX]], the Bears were enormously favored to beat their opponents, the New England Patriots. In the week before the game, [[Jim McMahon]] allegedly made some controversial comments about New Orleans women that got him some death threats, with McMahon responding by [[mooning]] a group of reporters because of the injury report stated McMahon had an injury to his buttock.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} At the same time, the NFL was cracking down on his trademark message headbands. However, during the game, McMahon wore a headband that said \"Pete\", in honor of Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]]. The Super Bowl was a circus atmosphere, getting huge TV ratings and reversing a decline in NFL viewership during the previous two years. The Bears started shaky as [[Walter Payton]] fumbled deep in Bears territory.  On the subsequent possession, the Patriots were unable to advance the football and had to settle for a field goal, taking a 3\u20130 lead. However, the Patriots' lead was short-lived as the Bears struck back by scoring the next 44 points in a relentless battering of the Patriots, including a touchdown by \"The Refrigerator\". The Bears won the game 46\u201310, setting then Super Bowl records for points and margin of victory as defensive end [[Richard Dent]] was named the [[Super Bowl MVP|Most Valuable Player of the Super Bowl]].\n\n===1986\u20131992: Post-Super Bowl years===\nIn 1986, the Bears' defense was even stingier coming off the Super Bowl establishing a new NFL record low for 187 points allowed as the Bears finished with another NFC Central title and a 14\u20132 record. The Bears attempt to defend their Super Bowl title took a blow when Jim McMahon suffered an injury as the result of an illegal hit by Packers' defender [[Charles Martin (American football)|Charles Martin]]. McMahon threw an interception and was slammed into the turf by Martin, injuring his shoulder and ending his season, which had already been subpar. [[Doug Flutie]] took over, but proved to be ineffective as the Bears were shocked by the Washington Redskins in the divisional playoffs, 27\u201313. A notable game in '86 was the inaugural [[American Bowl]], being the first Bears game outside of North America, with the Bears defeating the [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]] 17\u20136 in [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-04-13/sports/sp-4589_1_dallas-cowboys | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Bears, Cowboys May Sell Out Wembley for NFL Exhibition | date=April 13, 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.mitchellandness.com/post/This-Day-in-History-The-First-American-Bowl.aspx |title=Mitchell & Ness &#124; This Day in History: The First American Bowl |publisher=Blog.mitchellandness.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623195547/http://blog.mitchellandness.com/post/This-Day-in-History-The-First-American-Bowl.aspx |archive-date=June 23, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 12 - Walter Payton (Walter Payton crop).jpg|thumb|left|Payton set several franchise and NFL records in rushing during his 13-season career with the Bears]]\nAs the 1980s wore on, teams began to gradually figure out the [[46 defense]]. Offensive coordinators learned it was vulnerable to a short passing game, particularly the one devised by [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] (later referred to as the West Coast offense). The Bears also failed to draft proper replacements for aging starters.\n\nThe 1987 season brought a month-long strike that included the use of replacement players for three games. Off-field turmoil resulted when the team drafted QB [[Jim Harbaugh]] in the first round as a possible replacement for the injury-prone Jim McMahon. McMahon was offended by this and quarreled with Mike Ditka. The latter meanwhile unwisely took the side of the league during the strike, hurting relations with his players. Even with the replacements, the Bears continued to dominate the NFC Central, winning their fourth straight NFC Central title and achieving an 11\u20134 record (the strike resulted in a 15-game season), but ended 1987 on an embarrassing note as the team was destroyed in San Francisco 41\u20130. The year however was remembered for an end of an era as the player called \"Sweetness\" by many Bear fans retired after 13 seasons where he only missed one game.\nIn his great career Walter Payton rushed for an all-time career record 16,726 yards. The Bears earned a Divisional Playoff rematch with Redskins at Soldier Field. The Bears jumped out to a 14\u20130 lead early on only to see the Redskins storm back and take a 21\u201317 lead late in the game. As time was winding down on the season and Payton's career, the Bears need to score a touchdown late. The ball was in the hands of Payton who tried to extend his career, but on fourth down he was shoved out of bounds one yard short of the first down marker allowing the Redskins to run the clock out. Payton watched the rest of the game as he sat alone on the bench.\n\nIn the 1988 season the Bears kept on rolling, winning their fifth straight division title with a 12\u20134 record and earning home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. In a Divisional Playoffs game on New Year's Eve, the Bears faced the Philadelphia Eagles, and former defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan in a game that forever would be known as the \"[[Fog Bowl (American football)|Fog Bowl]]\". Late in the 2nd Quarter the fog began to roll in off [[Lake Michigan]], and at the start of the 3rd Quarter, Soldier Field was immersed in thick fog that made viewing the game impossible. The Bears emerged from the fog with a 20\u201312 victory. The victory was short-lived as the Bears lost the NFC Championship game the following week 28\u20133 to the eventual Super Bowl Champion San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe 1989 season started with a deal that sent Jim McMahon to the San Diego Chargers. The move was made as McMahon fell out of favor with Mike Ditka and the Bears front office with his behavior and repeated injuries. This gave the starting job to [[Mike Tomczak]], who had already seen considerable playing time as McMahon regularly missed games due to various injuries. The change at quarterback did not help the Bears as they finished 6\u201310 missing a sixth consecutive division title. The Bears came into the 1990 season bouncing back from a 6\u201310 season to finish in 1st Place with an 11\u20135 record. During the season, Head Coach Mike Ditka earned legendary status when he coached the team again just 10 days after a heart attack. This incident had been referenced and used several times in Bill Swerski's Superfans. However, a change in the playoff system caused the Bears a three seed to play in a wild card game to get to the Divisional Playoffs. In the first ever NFC 3 vs. 6 game the Bears defeated the New Orleans Saints, 16\u20136, to advance to a Divisional Playoff showdown against the New York Giants. The Bears were trounced 31\u20133 by the eventual Super Bowl Champion. The Bears made a return trip to the playoffs in 1991 with an 11\u20135 record in a season that saw Mike Ditka earn his 100th career-coaching win. The Bears did not win the division, but made the playoffs as a Wild Card qualifier. In the wild card round the Bears were defeated by the Dallas Cowboys, 17\u201313, in Chicago. The 1992 season saw the end of an era in Chicago. The Bears suffered their worst record of Mike Ditka's tenure, finishing 5\u201311. As a result, the Mike Ditka era ended as team president [[Mike McCaskey]] fired Ditka and hired [[Dave Wannstedt]]. Another era that ended that season came with the retirement of Hall of Famer Mike Singletary, who was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year.\n\n==1993\u20132003: The Wannstedt/Jauron years==\nFor the next 11 seasons, the Bears had a record of 76\u2013103 and posted three seasons above .500. Twice the Bears qualified for the postseason, with only one playoff win. In this same span, they placed first in their division only once.\n\n===Dave Wannstedt (1993\u20131998)===\nIn Wannstedt's first season, the Bears finished with a record of 7\u20139. During the 1993 season, the Bears played their 1,000th franchise game and won, 6\u20130, against the [[Atlanta Falcons]] at [[Soldier Field]]. The following season, the Bears put together a 9\u20137 season, and they earned a trip to the playoffs as a wild card. In the [[NFL playoffs, 1994\u201395|Wild Card]] round the Bears defeated the NFC Central Division Champion [[Minnesota Vikings]] 35\u201318. The Bears' success did not last long as they were beaten badly by the eventual Super Bowl Champion [[San Francisco 49ers]] 44\u201315 in San Francisco. In the 1995 season, the Bears again finished 9\u20137, but missed the playoffs due to a loss in a tiebreaker with the Atlanta Falcons. In the 1996 season, the Bears took a step backwards under Wannstedt and finished in third place with a record of 7\u20139.\n\nThe Bears declined further in the 1997 season, losing their first seven games toward a 4\u201312 season. One of the few highlights of the 1997 season was the Bears picking up franchise victory number 600 against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], becoming the first franchise to achieve the feat. The Bears had a setback when their October 26 game at the [[Miami Dolphins]] was pushed to the following Monday night after [[Pro Player Stadium]] was needed for game 7 of the [[1997 World Series]], but the Bears managed to come back and beat the Dolphins 36\u201333 in overtime for their first win of the season.\n\nThe 1998 season proved to be the last one for Coach Wannstedt as his Bears again finished 4\u201312. After the season, Wannstedt was fired and McCaskey reassigned by McCaskey's mother [[Virginia Halas McCaskey|Virginia]], the daughter of Halas.\n\n===Dick Jauron (1999\u20132003)===\n[[File:Brian Urlacher 2009.jpg|thumb|right|The Bears drafted [[Brian Urlacher]] in 2000.]]\nThe Bears hired [[Dick Jauron]] as their next head coach. The decade ended with Jauron's first season at 6\u201310. In the same year, [[Walter Payton]] died at the age of 45, one of the Chicago Bears and the league's greatest running backs of all time.\n\nThe Bears began the 2000 season and the new decade on a sour note. After losing their first four games, the Bears finally won their first game of the season on the road against their historic rival, the [[Green Bay Packers]]. Yet the Bears could not build off that win and lost their next three games. After the bye-week, they win against the [[Indianapolis Colts]] in Week 10. For the remaining seven games, they would win 3 games. Though the team ended the season 5\u201311, rookie linebacker [[Brian Urlacher]] was named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year.\n\nThe Bears surprised most with a breakout campaign in 2001. Apparently, this remained as the most successful season for Jauron with the Bears. After they lost their first game of the season to the [[Super Bowl XXXV]] Champion [[Baltimore Ravens]] 17\u20136 on the road, the Bears won their next six games. Two of those games were won in overtime, against the [[San Francisco 49ers]] (37\u201331) and the [[Cleveland Browns]] (27\u201321). In both games, Safety [[Mike Brown (safety)|Mike Brown]] capped remarkable comebacks (the Bears trailed 28\u20139 in the third quarter against San Francisco, and 21\u20137 with seconds remaining against Cleveland) by returning an interception in overtime for a touchdown. Unfortunately, the [[Green Bay Packers]] ended the win streak at home.\n\nFortunately, the Bears would win their next three games. However, the Bears traveled to [[Lambeau Field]] and were swept by the Packers 17\u20137. That would be their last loss of the regular season. The Bears would win their last four games. The Bears ended the regular season with a 13\u20133 record. This qualified for second place in the NFC, and thus earning a first-round bye in the playoffs.\n\nIn the divisional playoff game, the visiting [[Philadelphia Eagles]] won the game with a final score of 33\u201319. Despite their season ending on a sour note, rookie running back [[Anthony Thomas (American football)|Anthony Thomas]] won the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award. Also, coach Dick Jauron was given the Coach of the Year award.\n\nWith [[Soldier Field]] being renovated, the Chicago Bears had to play their 2002 home games at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] in Champaign, Illinois (136 miles outside Chicago). This was also the year when the [[Houston Texans]] joined the NFL and realignments were made. The Bears joined the Lions, the Packers, and the Vikings in the newly formed NFC North. The [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] leave the [[NFC Central]] to join the [[NFC South]]. The Bears even acquired former Steelers Quarterback [[Kordell Stewart|Kordell \"Slash\" Stewart]]. Despite starting the season 2\u20130, the team was plagued by injuries, and they lost their next eight games. The Bears finally got their third win of the year at home against the Lions. The Bears would lose four out of the remaining five games of the season. The Bears ended the season with a 4\u201312 record.\n\n[[File:SoliderFieldAug2004.jpg|thumb|right|[[Soldier Field]] finished reconstruction for the [[2003 Chicago Bears season|2003 campaign]].]]\nFor the 2003 campaign, the Bears were able to move back to their newly renovated Soldier Field (also known as Soldier Field II), and the team also debuted its new mascot [[Staley Da Bear]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/staley/ |title=Staley |publisher=Chicago Bears |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> Nevertheless, mediocrity continued as the Bears ended the season with a 7\u20139 record.\n\nThe Bears began the season with a 1\u20134 record by Week 5. Then Kordell Stewart lost his starting job after the Bears lost their next two road games. [[Chris Chandler]] was named their new quarterback. However, Chandler ended up playing only 4 games; winning the first 2 and losing the second 2. This allowed Kordell Stewart to reclaim his starting job; and played the next three games winning 2.\n\nLooking towards the future, the Bears allowed rookie quarterback [[Rex Grossman]] to start the last three games of the season. Grossman brought the Bears victories in their final two home games. In the end, the late showing of talent was not enough to save Dick Jauron's job. He ended up being dismissed from the Bears.\n\nThis post-Ditka decade saw an uneven effort to bring back the fiery Halas style and forge new ideas. Two coaches and various schemes came and went. Furthermore, this era was marred by a \"quarterback carousel\", where the starting job changed year after year. The hiring of GM [[Jerry Angelo]] in 2001, after 14 years of with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was viewed as a hopeful sign.\n\n==The Lovie Smith era (2004\u20132012)==\n[[File:Smith Lovie Quinnan3.jpg|thumb|Lovie Smith coached the Bears from 2004 to 2012.]]\nWith [[Lovie Smith]] (the former defensive coordinator for the [[St. Louis Rams]]) as their new head coach, the Bears made plans for their 2004 campaign. Since hiring Lovie, all personnel moves made by GM Jerry Angelo have had an overwhelming degree of success. Under Lovie Smith, the Bears have a cumulative record of 63-49, including two playoff wins and two playoff losses, one of which was [[Super Bowl XLI]].\n\nAt the beginning of Smith's tenure, he stated three goals:<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/team/coach.asp?coach_id=1\n|title=Hiring Lovie Smith\n|accessdate=2007-02-08\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304013359/http://www.chicagobears.com/team/coach.asp?coach_id=1\n|archive-date=March 4, 2008\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n*End Green Bay's dominance of the division\n*Win the [[NFC North|Division]]\n*Win the [[Super Bowl]]\nBy the end of 2005, the first two goals had been realized.\n\n===The new \"Monsters of the Midway\"===\nIn his inaugural year, the Bears ended their 2004 campaign at 5\u201311. For the first goal, Lovie Smith aimed to defeat their historic rival, the Green Bay Packers at [[Lambeau Field]]. However, by Week 7, the Bears recorded a poor starting record of 1\u20135, with the only win against Green Bay largely due to the Week 3 road game loss to the Minnesota Vikings. There, they lost starting quarterback Rex Grossman from a season-ending knee injury. From then on, they cycled through three different quarterbacks: [[Craig Krenzel]], [[Jonathan Quinn]], and [[Chad Hutchinson]]. After a modest three-game win streak from Week 8 to 10, the Bears capped the streak in their Week 10 (19\u201317) win over the [[Tennessee Titans]] in overtime with a safety. That was the second time in NFL history that a game ended in overtime on a safety. Afterwards, the Bears ended up losing six of the remaining seven games.\n\nIn 2005, after going 3\u20132 in the preseason (with Rex Grossman suffering a broken ankle in their preseason loss to the [[St. Louis Rams]]), the Bears named rookie QB [[Kyle Orton]] their starter, and their regular season started off poorly. The Bears began the season with a 1\u20133 record. Not even a Week 4 Bye could help them, because in Week 5, the Bears lost a hard-fought road game to [[Trent Dilfer]] and the [[Cleveland Browns]] 20\u201310.\n\nAfter the 1\u20133 start, the Bears had an eight-game winning streak, which started with two home games against Minnesota 28\u20133 and the Ravens 10\u20136. On a Week 10 home game, the visiting 49ers attempted a 52-yard field goal as time expired in the first half and the wind blew it to [[Nathan Vasher]] who was in the end zone. He returned that missed field goal 108 yards for a touchdown, the longest touchdown play in NFL history then, only to be repeated by Chicago's own [[Devin Hester]] almost exactly one year later. The eight-game winning streak came to an end on the road in a cold and snowy fight against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (21\u20139).\n\nThe Bears closed out the season with a 2\u20132 record. In Week 15, they won their last regular-season home game against the [[Atlanta Falcons]] with a final score of 16\u20133. During the game, head coach [[Lovie Smith]] replaced Kyle Orton with a fully healed Rex Grossman. In the following week, the Bears clinched the division with a dominant performance at [[Lambeau Field]] on Christmas Day (the first time the Bears ever played on Christmas). For the first time since 1991, they swept the Packers; they also secured the NFC North Division title. The Bears ended the regular season with an 11\u20135 record, enough for 2nd place in the NFC and a first-round bye in the [[2005\u201306 NFL playoffs|playoffs]]. In addition, Lovie Smith received [[NFL Coach of the Year Award|NFL Coach of the Year]] honors.\n\nIn the NFC divisional playoff game the [[Carolina Panthers]] defeated the Bears 29\u201321, ending the Bears' season. Panthers' receiver [[Steve Smith (American football, born 1979)|Steve Smith]] had 12 receptions for 218 yards and two touchdowns. The Panthers' offense dismantled the Bears' top-ranked defense. The Bears had a final chance to force overtime, but Rex Grossman's 4th-and-1 pass intended for Muhsin Muhammad fell incomplete with less than a minute to go in the game.\n\nThe Bears started the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]] by winning their first seven games, marking their best start since the [[1988 Chicago Bears season|1988 season]]. The Bears started the season by establishing a strong offense under the helm of a healthy [[Rex Grossman]]. Grossman, who was inactive for the most of his first three seasons because of injuries, earned a \"[[FedEx]] Offensive Player of the Month Award\", a 100.9 [[passer rating]] during the first month of the season. During one of the games, Grossman threw four touchdowns and earned a passer rating of 148.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/cubicle/cs-060917bearwithus,0,5590465.column |work=Chicago Tribune |title=Bear with Us \u2013 chicagotribune.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318072332/http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/cubicle/cs-060917bearwithus%2C0%2C5590465.column |archivedate=March 18, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Bears\u2019 defense also made headlines, allowing the Bears to outscore their opponents, 221\u201369 during the first two months of the season.\n\nHowever, the Bears showed a glimpse of mortality during this period. After defeating the [[Buffalo Bills]] 40\u20137, the Bears traveled to [[Glendale, Arizona]], to face the [[Arizona Cardinals|Cardinals]], where Grossman committed six turnovers in a seemingly lost effort. With less than twenty minutes remaining, the Bears\u2019 defense and special teams mounted [[2006 Chicago Bears\u2013Arizona Cardinals game|a comeback]] that allowed the team to overcome a 20-point deficit and win the game, 24\u201323. After a decisive 41\u201310 crushing of the 49ers,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/boxscore?gid=20061029003&page=plays |title=NFL \u2013 San Francisco 49ers/Chicago Bears Box Score Sunday October 29, 2006 \u2013 Yahoo! Sports |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> where the Bears scored 41 points in the first half, tying the record by the 1940 Championship Game victory, Grossman had another turnover ridden performance against the [[Miami Dolphins]] (which reminisced the [[1985 Chicago Bears|1985 season]]), where the Bears lost 31\u201313, the most points the team allowed that season. The team bounced back with a staunch performance against the [[New York Giants]], in which [[Devin Hester]] tied Nathan Vasher's longest missed-field goal return record, and a shutout victory over the [[New York Jets]].\n\nThe Bears then traveled to [[Foxboro, Massachusetts]], where Grossman and the Bears\u2019 defense struggled to defeat the [[New England Patriots]]. Despite earning another chance to win the game, Grossman threw a game-ending interception to [[Asante Samuel]]. The following week, the Bears\u2019 defense and special teams came up big, in the wake of a struggling passing game, against the Vikings 23\u201313. The win clinched their second consecutive NFC North title, and a playoff-berth. The team began to re-establish their clockwork performance during the next three games, including a game where Devin Hester returned two kicks for touchdowns against the [[St. Louis Rams]], and an overtime thriller against the Buccaneers where Grossman threw for over 300 yards. The season ended on a low note, when the Packers defeated the Bears 26\u20137, in the regular season's finale, with Grossman leaving a [[NFL quarterbacks who have posted a passer rating of zero|passer rating of zero]].\n\nThe local media began to criticize Grossman for his inconsistent performances and shortcomings. Many fans called upon Lovie Smith to bench Grossman in favor of veteran quarterback [[Brian Griese]]. Nevertheless, Smith, who had supported Grossman throughout the season, opted to keep Grossman as the team's starter. The Bears prepared to take on the [[Seattle Seahawks]] for a second time, who had returned with a healthy [[Shaun Alexander]]. Prior to the game, Smith announced the creation of the \"Fourth Phase\", which involved using fan support as an advantage. On a dreary day along the lake-front, the Bears defeated the Seahawks, 27\u201324, on an overtime [[Robbie Gould]] field goal. The win marked the first time since [[1994 Chicago Bears season|1994 season]], that the Bears had won a playoff game.\n\n[[Image:Lion Chicago Bears Helmet.jpg|thumb|right|Many Chicago landmarks were decorated to support the Bears during Super Bowl XLI]]\nThe following week, the Bears faced the New Orleans Saints at the [[NFC Championship]], marking the Saints' first Conference Championship appearance. The Bears\u2019 defense shut down the Saints\u2019 top-ranked offense, while running backs [[Thomas Jones (American football)|Thomas Jones]] and [[Cedric Benson]] exploited the Saints\u2019 run defense for nearly 180 yards and three touchdowns. The Bears defeated the Saints, 39\u201314. The win allowed the Bears to claim the [[NFC Championship Game|George Halas Trophy]] and the right to represent the [[National Football Conference]] at [[Super Bowl XLI]] against the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. Also, Lovie Smith became the first African-American coach to lead his team to a Super Bowl. This feat was matched hours later by his mentor and friend, [[Tony Dungy]] of the Colts.\n\nThe Bears entered Super Bowl XLI as seven-point underdogs. Amidst the game's rainy weather, the Bears took the quickest lead in Super Bowl history after [[Devin Hester]] returned the game's opening kick-off for a touchdown return. Though the Bears\u2019 expanded their lead with a touchdown, the Colts struck back to take a halftime lead. The Bears\u2019 hopes for a comeback were almost thwarted when Grossman threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown. Ultimately, the Colts defeated the Bears, 29\u201317. After a productive season, the Bears returned to Chicago in hopes of replicating their success next year.\n\nSuccess was not forthcoming in 2007, which saw the Bears struggle through the season and finish 7\u20139. Legal troubles affected defensive tackle Terry \"Tank\" Johnson during the spring, and he was cut by the Bears on June 25. Defensive coordinator Ron Rivera was dropped as well after his contract with the team expired. After the Bears started the season with a 1\u20133 record, Lovie Smith benched Grossman in favor of Griese. However, injuries ravaged the team's roster, resulting in multiple inconsistent performances on defense and offense. The team finished the  season with a 7\u20139 record, one game behind the [[Detroit Lions]]. On the bright side, the Bears swept the [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] for the first time since [[2005 Chicago Bears season|2005]], including a 35\u20137 victory against the 13\u20132 Packers in Week 17.\n\nIn 2008, Lovie Smith named Kyle Orton as the team's starting quarterback. The team parted with [[Cedric Benson]], who was cut after two alcohol-related arrests. Benson was succeeded by rookie running back [[Matt Forte]], who rushed for 1,238 yards and caught 47 receptions for 438 yards. The team recorded a major victory in Week 1 in a [[Super Bowl XLI]] rematch against the Colts in [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] 29\u201313. The Bears posted a winning record again, with nine wins and seven losses, however Chicago ended up being one game behind the eventual NFC North Champion Minnesota Vikings, and failed to qualify for the playoffs after losing 31\u201324 to the [[Houston Texans]] in Week 17.\n\n===Jay Cutler trade===\n[[File:Jay Cutler - 11-01-2009.jpg|thumb|left|The Bears traded [[Kyle Orton]] and a first round pick to the [[Denver Broncos]] for [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]].]]\nDuring the 2009 off-season, Rex Grossman achieved free-agent status and left the team, signing with the [[Houston Texans]]. The Bears then traded Kyle Orton to the Broncos in exchange for QB Jay Cutler. The regular season began on a not-so-promising note, as Cutler threw 4 picks against the Packers in Week 1. However, the Bears bounced back to go 3\u20131, including a victory in Week 2 over the defending Super Bowl champion Steelers, but things fell apart quickly after the bye week, with the Bears losing eight of the next ten games, including a loss to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] where Cutler threw a career-high five interceptions, including a game-ending pick in the red-zone with less than a minute left in the game. A 31\u20137 loss to the Ravens in Week 15 mathematically eliminated them from the playoffs, but the team managed to close out the year by winning the last two matches against the Vikings (a 36\u201330 overtime win) and Lions (37\u201323) to finish 7\u20139.\n\nIn the following offseason, the Bears signed Pro Bowler [[Julius Peppers]], [[Chester Taylor]], and [[Brandon Manumaleuna]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=6595 |title=Bears ink three free agents on first day |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717080902/http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=6595 |archive-date=July 17, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=6598 |title=Free agents put the Bears closer to title |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=6599 |title=Bears' rich tradition helped lure Peppers |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=6600 |title=Bears swipe runner from division rival |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=6601 |title=Manumaleuna back with Smith, Martz |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=6603 |title=Peppers, Taylor are happy to join forces |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=6604 |title=Martz excited about free-agent signings |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> In Week 1, they hosted the Lions and won 19\u201314 after a controversial call.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jerry Reth |url=http://sports.spreadit.org/calvin-johnson-catch-touchdown-overturned-1597/ |title=Calvin Johnson Catch \u2013 Touchdown Overturned |publisher=Sports.spreadit.org |date=September 13, 2010 |accessdate=2012-08-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114063124/http://sports.spreadit.org/calvin-johnson-catch-touchdown-overturned-1597/ |archive-date=January 14, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Next, the Bears traveled to Dallas and beat the Cowboys 27\u201320. On Monday Night Football in Week 3, the Packers came to town and lost 20\u201317 after a mass of penalties (18 total), putting the Bears up at 3\u20130. However, that ended in Week 4 when the team suffered a 17\u20133 loss to the Giants on the road.  Jay Cutler was sacked multiple times and suffered a concussion. Veteran free agent quarterback [[Todd Collins (quarterback)|Todd Collins]] replaced Cutler, but was also quickly injured. Third-string quarterback [[Caleb Hanie]] played the remainder of the game.\n\nAfter this loss, the Bears had an easy road win over the 0\u20135 Carolina Panthers before another 23\u201320 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Continued difficulties with the offense and O-line led to a second straight home loss when the Redskins won 17\u201314 in Week 7. After the bye week, offensive coordinator Mike Martz worked to revamp the offense to compensate for Jay Cutler's lack of O-line protection. After this, they easily beat the struggling Vikings at home 27\u201313, followed by a 16\u20130 shutout of the Dolphins in Miami, handing Chicago their 700th win, a league first.\n\nIn Week 12, the Bears hosted Philadelphia for the second season in a row and won 31\u201327, while also preserving the franchise's perfect record against Eagles QB Michael Vick (who after the game had a 0\u20135 all-time record playing them). After beating the Lions in Detroit on more questionable officiating, Chicago next suffered a total collapse at home against New England in a blowing snowstorm (the Patriots won 36\u20137).\n\nThe next week saw the Bears drawn into the turmoil of the Vikings' 2010 season. As the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome's inflatable roof had collapsed the week before, the two teams had to play at TCF Bank Stadium at the University of Minnesota campus in frigid winter weather. Despite being a nominal home game for the Vikings, they were not a team prepared for outdoor play and Chicago overwhelmed them 40\u201314. It was here that Brett Favre took his final snap in the NFL after he was knocked into the frozen ground and suffered a concussion, ending a 20-year career that included 297 consecutive starts.\n\nAfterwards, the Bears returned home and beat the Jets 38\u201334 in a shootout<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82002700/article/no-12-bears-outlast-jets-in-wildly-entertaining-showdown?module=HP_cp2 |title=news: No. 12: Bears outlast Jets in wildly entertaining showdown |publisher=Nfl.com |date=May 25, 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> before traveling to the \"Frozen Tundra\" of Lambeau Field for Week 17. Their arch-rival only needed to lose this game to be removed from playoff contention, and so Lovie Smith decided to play Chicago's starters. He also apparently ran generic plays to avoid giving anything away to the Packers for the playoffs, but the offense again sputtered and Green Bay won a 10\u20133 defensive struggle to secure a wild card playoff berth.\n\nThroughout the season, the Bears' offense and O-line were rated in the NFL's bottom ten and the team mainly depended on special teams (especially Devin Hester's duties as a punt returner) and an aging, but still effective defense led by DE Julius Peppers (acquired from Carolina during the off-season) and LB Brian Urlacher.\n\nAlthough the Bears' own playoff chances were unharmed by the loss in Green Bay (they had already gotten the No. 2 NFC seed and a first-round bye with their 11\u20135 regular season record), that game ultimately proved fatal because of their inability to remove the Packers from postseason contention.\n\nAfter the Seahawks gained a surprise division title with a 7\u20139 regular season record and an even more miraculous playoff victory over the defending champion Saints, they headed to Chicago in the divisional round. However, there was no repeat of Week 6 this time. On a gray, fog-shrouded winter afternoon, Jay Cutler threw two TD passes as the Bears overpowered their opponent 35\u201324 to advance to the NFC Championship.\n\nThe Packers meanwhile had beaten the Eagles and Falcons in the playoffs to head to Soldier Field for what was only the second-ever postseason meeting between them and the Bears (the first was in 1941). To everyone's surprise, Green Bay marched out to an early lead as Chicago's offense struggled. During the third quarter, Jay Cutler was pulled with a knee injury and replaced by Todd Collins, who was benched after only two minutes of play. Caleb Hanie came in and tried to rally the team, but hammered by the Packers defense, threw a fatal interception that was caught by nose tackle B.J. Raji and returned for a touchdown. Although Hanie subsequently belted a 35-yard TD pass, Green Bay's defense held on to win the game 21\u201314, advance to [[Super Bowl XLV]], and ultimately win the championship.\n\nJay Cutler was widely blamed for a disastrous end to the Bears' miracle season and after the NFC Championship by fans, as well as players like [[Maurice Jones-Drew]], some fans burned Cutler jerseys.<ref>[http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/dpp/sports/jay-cutler-injury-criticism-jan-24-2011 Jay Cutler Criticism Surge After Leaving NFC Championship Game] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128234527/http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/dpp/sports/jay-cutler-injury-criticism-jan-24-2011 |date=January 28, 2011 }}</ref> Critics argued that he did not show any indication that his knee injury was serious enough to keep him out of the game and that he had been riding an exercise bike during the rest of the game.

{"title_page": "History of the Charlotte Hornets", "text_new": "{{short description|Sports team history}}\nThe history of the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Charlotte Hornets]] goes back to 1985, when George Shinn first thought up the idea of bringing professional basketball to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. Since then, the Hornets have recorded ten playoff appearances under two different franchises.\n\n==Early years==\n===1985\u20131988: Birth of the Hornets===\nIn 1985, the NBA, then with 23 teams, was planning to expand by four teams by the 1988\u201389 season. [[George Shinn]], an entrepreneur from [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]], wanted to bring an NBA team to the Charlotte area, and he assembled a group of prominent local businessmen to head the prospective franchise. The Charlotte area had long been a hotbed for [[college basketball]]. The [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]'s four North Carolina teams, as well as local teams [[Charlotte 49ers men's basketball|UNC Charlotte]], [[Davidson Wildcats men's basketball|Davidson]], and [[Johnson C. Smith University|Johnson C. Smith]], had large and loyal fan bases in the city. Charlotte was also one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and was previously one of the three in-state regional homes to the [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Carolina Cougars]], from 1969 to 1974.\n\nSome critics doubted that Charlotte, then a city mostly known for banking, could support an NBA team; one ''[[Sacramento Bee]]'' columnist joked, \"The only franchise Charlotte is going to get is one with [[Golden Arches]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jmu.edu/montpelier/issues/winter02/main/hockey.html |title=Montpelier \u2013 James Madison University Magazine |publisher=Jmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref>  However, Shinn's [[:wikt:ace in the hole|ace in the hole]] was the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], a state-of-the-art arena under construction that would seat almost 24,000 spectators \u2013 the largest basketball-specific arena ever to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. On April 5, 1987, [[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]] called Shinn to tell him his group had been awarded the NBA's 24th franchise, to begin play in [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988]]. Franchises were also granted to [[Miami Heat|Miami]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], and [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]].\n\nOriginally, the new team was going to be called the ''Charlotte Spirit'', but a name-the-team contest yielded \"Hornets\" as the winning choice. The name was derived from the city's fierce resistance to [[British people|British]] occupation during the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]], which prompted the British commander, [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], to refer to it as \"a veritable hornet's nest of rebellion\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Lassiter |first=Emily |title=Charlotte Hornets |url=http://blogs.lib.unc.edu/ncm/index.php/2009/08/24/charlotte-hornets/comment-page-1/ |work=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Libraries |date=August 24, 2009 |accessdate=January 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Posnanski |first=Joe |title=A brief history of the Charlotte Hornets (and other things) |url=http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/05/22/a-brief-history-of-the-charlotte-hornets-and-other-things/ |publisher=[[NBC Sports]] |date=May 22, 2013 |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}</ref> The name had been used for Charlotte sports teams before, including a [[minor league baseball]] team that was located in the city from 1901 to 1972, as well as a [[World Football League]] team that played there from 1974 to 1975. In addition the [[Charlotte 49ers men's basketball|Charlotte 49ers]] and [[Davidson Wildcats men's basketball|Davidson Wildcats]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] play annually for the Hornets' Nest Trophy.\n\nThe team received attention when it chose [[teal (color)|teal]] as its primary color, setting off a sports fashion craze in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with many pro and amateur clubs soon following with teal in their color schemes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} The team's uniforms were designed by international designer and North Carolina native [[Alexander Julian]], and featured a first for NBA uniforms\u2014pinstripes. Similar designs by the [[Orlando Magic]], [[Toronto Raptors]], [[Houston Rockets]], [[Chicago Bulls]], and [[Indiana Pacers]] followed soon after.\n\nShinn hired Carl Scheer, a longtime NBA executive, as the team's first general manager. Scheer preferred a roster of veteran players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as possible, with a goal of making the playoffs in five years. Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant [[Dick Harter]] was also hired, becoming the team's first head coach.\n\nIn 1988, the Hornets and the [[Miami Heat]] were part of the [[1988 NBA Expansion Draft]]. Unlike many expansion franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of young players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several veterans in hopes of putting a competitive lineup on the court right away. The team also had three draft picks at the [[1988 NBA draft]].\n\n===1988\u20131991===\nIn their [[1988\u201389 Charlotte Hornets season|inaugural season]] the Hornets were led by ex-Pistons guard [[Kelly Tripucka]], who provided instant offense and was Charlotte's top scorer for the franchise's first two seasons. Other notable players included sharpshooting rookie and first-ever draft choice [[Rex Chapman]], a long-distance scoring threat, and floor general [[Muggsy Bogues]], the shortest player in NBA history at 5'3\". The Hornets' first NBA game took place on November 4, 1988, at the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], and was a 133\u201393 loss to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811040CHH.html |title=Cleveland Cavaliers 133, Charlotte Hornets 93 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=1988-11-04 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref>  The opening night lineup included Tripucka, [[Kurt Rambis]], [[Dave Hoppen]], [[Robert Reid (basketball)|Robert Reid]], and [[Rickey Green]].

The Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20 wins and 62 losses.\n\nDespite initial concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were a runaway hit in their first season, leading the NBA in attendance, a feat they would achieve seven more times in Charlotte. Eventually, the Hornets would sell out 364 consecutive games\u2014almost nine consecutive seasons.\n\nThe Hornets' [[1989\u201390 Charlotte Hornets season|second season]] was a struggle from start to finish. The team lost their first five games before defeating the [[Orlando Magic]] in the first meeting between the two franchises. Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter's defense-oriented style, and he was replaced mid-season by assistant [[Gene Littles]] following a dismal 8\u201332 start. Despite the change, the team continued to struggle during the second half of the season, suffering through a 3\u201331 stretch from January through March. In the end, the team took a step backwards, finishing the season with a disappointing 19\u201363 record \u2013 one game worse than their previous season.\n\nIn the [[1990 NBA draft]], the Hornets selected guard [[Kendall Gill]] with the 5th overall pick. The team showed improvement during the [[1990\u201391 Charlotte Hornets season|1990\u201391 season]]. They won eight of their first 15 games, including a 120\u2013105 victory over the [[Washington Bullets]]. However, the team went cold, losing their next 11 games and falling to an 8\u201318 record. The Hornets, who hosted the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]], finished their third season with a 26\u201356 record. Despite the team's seven-game improvement over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired at the end of the season and replaced by general manager [[Allan Bristow]].\n\n==Playoffs and success==\n===1991\u20131995===\nWith the first pick in the [[1991 NBA draft]], the Hornets drafted [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] from the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. Johnson had an impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and rebounds, and winning the 1992 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Additionally, Guard [[Kendall Gill]] led the club in scoring, averaging over 20 points per game. The team stayed in contention for a playoff spot until March, but in the end, they finished [[1991\u201392 Charlotte Hornets season|the season]] with a record of 31\u201351. Despite continuing to improve, the Hornets failed to qualify for the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season.\n\n====1992\u20131993: First playoff appearance====\nThe Hornets were in the lottery again in 1992 and won the second overall pick in the draft, using it to select [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] center [[Alonzo Mourning]]. The Hornets now had two 20\u201310 threats in Johnson and Mourning, who with Kendall Gill, formed perhaps the league's top young trio. The team finished [[1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets season|their fifth season]] at 44\u201338, their first-ever winning record and good enough for the first [[1993 NBA Playoffs|playoff berth]] in franchise history. Finishing fifth in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], the Hornets upset the [[Boston Celtics]] in the first round, with Mourning winning the series with a 20-footer in game four.<ref>{{cite web |last=Smith, Jr. |first=Pat |title=ESPN \u2013 The Mourning After \u2013 Classic |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/news/story?page=add_mourning_alonzo |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=June 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> However, the Hornets lacked the experience and depth to defeat the [[New York Knicks]], falling in five games in the second round.\n\nThe Hornets finished the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]] with a 41\u201341 record, narrowly missing the playoffs. Despite injuries to both Johnson and Mourning, the two led the team in points-per-game. The [[1994\u201395 NBA season|following season]], the Hornets finished the regular season with 50 wins and 32 losses, and returned to [[1995 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]]. Johnson and Mourning again led the team in points-per-game, while also leading the club in rebounding. However, Charlotte was bounced from the playoffs in the first round, falling to the [[Chicago Bulls]] in four games. Following the season, the Johnson\u2013Mourning era would come to an end, as the Hornets traded Mourning to the [[Miami Heat]] for forward [[Glen Rice]], center [[Matt Geiger]], and guard [[Khalid Reeves]].\n\n===1995\u20131998===\n[[Glen Rice]] would make an immediate impact after joining the Hornets, leading the team in scoring and points-per-game during the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]]. While Rice and Johnson provided high-powered scoring, Geiger tied with Johnson for the team lead in rebounds, and All-Star guard [[Kenny Anderson (basketball)|Kenny Anderson]] ran the point for the injured [[Muggsy Bogues]]. The Hornets were competitive, but failed to qualify for the playoffs during the season, again finishing with a 41\u201341 record. [[Allan Bristow|Bristow]] resigned at the end of the season, and was replaced by NBA legend [[Dave Cowens]].\n\nThe 1996 off-season was again marked by vast changes: Anderson declined to re-sign, Johnson was shipped to the Knicks for power forward [[Anthony Mason (basketball)|Anthony Mason]], and the team made a trade on [[1996 NBA draft|draft day 1996]]. They acquired center [[Vlade Divac]] from the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] for the rights to [[Kobe Bryant]], who the Hornets picked 13th in the draft. The new-look Hornets were successful, with Divac and Geiger providing the center combination, Mason averaging a double-double, Bogues back at the point, and Rice having the finest season of his career. The team achieved the best season in its history at the time, finishing with 54 victories compared to only 28 losses, and making it [[1997 NBA Playoffs|back to the playoffs]]. Rice finishing third in the league in scoring, earning all-NBA second team honors, and was also the All-Star Game MVP, setting several scoring records. Despite the success during the regular season, the Hornets went down rather meekly to the Knicks in three straight games.\n\nThe [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398]] season was also successful. [[Muggsy Bogues]] was traded two games into the season, and the team picked up point guard [[David Wesley]] and shooting guard [[Bobby Phills]]. With Wesley, Phills, Rice, Mason, and Divac, the Hornets romped through the regular season, finishing with a 51\u201331  record; Rice had another good season, as he finished sixth in league scoring and earned all-NBA third team honors. The Hornets made it to back-to-back playoffs for the first time in franchise history, and advanced to the second round, only to again be stopped by the Bulls.\n\n==End of an era==\n===1998\u20132002: Final years of original Hornets===\nThe [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399]] season was turbulent. The season didn't start until February, as the lockout shortened the regular season to only 50 games. Additionally, [[Glen Rice]] was traded to the Lakers for [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and [[Elden Campbell]], and [[Dave Cowens]] resigned midway through the season. Cowens still holds the highest winning percentage among Hornets head coaches. He was replaced by former Celtics teammate [[Paul Silas]], who became the franchise's fifth head coach. The team finished the season with a 26\u201324 record, but failed to qualify for the playoffs.\n\nThe [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]] saw a return to prominence, with the addition of point guard [[Baron Davis]], the third overall draft pick. The Hornets tore through much of the season, but tragedy struck on January 12, 2000, when fan favorite and top reserve [[Bobby Phills]] was killed in an automobile accident; the Hornets retired his No. 13 on February 9, 2000. After finishing the regular season with a 49\u201333 record, the team was able to return to the playoffs, where they lost to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the first round. The season, however, was overshadowed by events off the court. The team's popularity had begun to sag due to fan discontent with owner George Shinn's personnel moves; he had reportedly traded Mourning and several other stars out of an unwillingness to pay them market value. Additionally, [[Michael Jordan]], a North Carolina native, began negotiations to become part-owner of the team, but talks collapsed when Shinn refused to grant Jordan total control over the basketball side of the operation. Because of this, the team's attendance dropped to eleventh in the league for the season.\n\nIn the [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301]] season, with the additions of [[Jamal Mashburn]] and [[P.J. Brown]], the Hornets managed to return to the playoffs, finishing the season with a 46\u201336 record. While they upset the third-seeded Heat in the first round and made it to the conference semifinals for just the third time in franchise history, they lost to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in seven games. Despite the team continuing to play well, their popularity continued to fall, with the team finishing 21st in the league in attendance for the season.\n\nThe Hornets returned to the playoffs [[2001\u201302 NBA season|the following season]], finishing the regular season at 44\u201338. After defeating the [[Orlando Magic]] in the first round, they were upended by the [[New Jersey Nets]] in five games in the Conference Semifinals. The team finished the season twenty-ninth (last) in the league in attendance, a stark contrast to their earlier years in Charlotte. Before the Hornets were eliminated from the playoffs, the NBA approved a deal for the team to move to New Orleans following the season.\n\n===2002\u20132003: Relocation to New Orleans===\nThe Hornets popularity with the city of Charlotte began to wane during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Many attributed this lapse in popularity to the team's owner, [[George Shinn]], who was slowly becoming despised by the people of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/charhorn/charhornets.html |title=Charlotte Hornets (1988\u20132002) |publisher=SportsECyclopedia.com |date=February 28, 2015 |accessdate=February 28, 2015}}</ref>  In 1997, a Charlotte woman claimed that Shinn had raped her, and the resulting trial severely tarnished his reputation in the city.  The consensus was that while Charlotte was as basketball-crazy as ever, fans took out their anger at Shinn on the team. Shinn had also become discontented with the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], which, although considered state-of-the-art when it opened in 1988, had by then been considered obsolete due to a limited number of luxury boxes. On March 26, 2001, both the Hornets and the [[Vancouver Grizzlies]] applied for relocation to [[Memphis, Tennessee]],<ref>{{cite web|title=CNNSI.com \u2013 NBA Basketball \u2013 Hornets to apply for relocation to Memphis \u2013 Monday March 26, 2001 05:47 PM |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/2001/03/26/hornets_memphis_ap/ |publisher=SportsIllustrated.CNN.com |date=March 26, 2001 |accessdate=December 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020208045826/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/2001/03/26/hornets_memphis_ap/ |archivedate=February 8, 2002 }}</ref> which was ultimately [[Vancouver Grizzlies relocation to Memphis|won by the Grizzlies]]. Shinn issued an ultimatum: unless the city built a new arena at no cost to him, the Hornets would leave town. The city initially refused, leading Shinn to consider moving the team to either [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], or [[St. Louis]]. Of the cities in the running, only St. Louis had an NBA-ready arena (Savvis Center, now known as the [[Enterprise Center]]) already in place and was a larger media market than Charlotte at the time; also, it was the only one of the four to have an previously had hosted an NBA franchise \u2014 the [[St. Louis Hawks]], who moved to [[Atlanta]] in 1968.\n\nFinally, a new arena in [[Charlotte center city|Uptown]], which would eventually become the Charlotte Bobcats Arena (later to become Time Warner Cable Arena and now known as the [[Spectrum Center (arena)|Spectrum Center]]), was included in a non-binding referendum for a larger arts-related package, and Shinn withdrew his application to move the team.  Polls showed the referendum on its way to passage.  However, just days before the referendum, Mayor [[Pat McCrory]] vetoed a [[living wage]] ordinance. The veto prompted many of the city's black ministers to oppose the referendum; they felt it was immoral for the city to build a new arena when city employees weren't paid enough to make a living.<ref>[http://charlotte.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A535&comments=yes World Class City, Third World Paycheck] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113092536/http://charlotte.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A535&comments=yes |date=2009-01-13 }}.

However, in the first round of the playoffs, the Bobcats were swept by the [[Orlando Magic]], quickly ending their season.\n\n===2010\u20132012: Struggles and the worst season in NBA history===\nThe Bobcats began the [[2010\u201311 Charlotte Bobcats season|2010\u201311 season]] with high hopes following their success the previous season. Despite the departures of key players such as [[Raymond Felton]] and [[Tyson Chandler]], the Bobcats started their season hoping to once again make the playoffs. However, the Bobcats struggled early during the season, and on December 22, 2010, following a dismal 9\u201319 start, Michael Jordan announced that [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] had stepped down as the Bobcats Head Coach; that same day, veteran coach [[Paul Silas]] returned to Charlotte for the first time since 2001. On February 24, 2011, the day of the NBA trade deadline, the Bobcats made some moves to clear up some cap space by sending former all-star forward [[Gerald Wallace]] to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] for two first round draft picks, [[Joel Przybilla]], [[Sean Marks]], and [[Dante Cunningham]]. They also sent veteran center [[Nazr Mohammed]] to the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] for [[D. J. White]] and [[Morris Peterson]]. Going down the stretch, the injuries to [[Stephen Jackson]] and [[Tyrus Thomas]] derailed any chances of Charlotte trying to catch the [[Indiana Pacers]], who swept them 4\u20130 in the regular season, for the eighth spot in the east. In the end, the Bobcats finished the season with a 34\u201348 record, finishing 25\u201329 under Paul Silas.\n\nOn June 13, 2011, the Bobcats made some moves to their front office by hiring former Portland Trail Blazers general manager Rich Cho to the same position and promoting Rod Higgins to President of Basketball Operations. On the day of the [[2011 NBA draft]] the Bobcats once again made a major roster move by sending [[Stephen Jackson]], [[Shaun Livingston]], and the 19th overall pick to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]. In return, the Bobcats received former Duke star [[Corey Maggette]] and the 7th overall pick. They used that pick to draft forward [[Bismack Biyombo]] and then drafted [[Kemba Walker]], the [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player]], with the 9th pick in the draft. They also made a few more acquisitions by trading their 2013 second-round draft pick to the Thunder for 7-footer [[Byron Mullens]] and signing sharpshooter [[Reggie Williams (basketball, born 1986)|Reggie Williams]] in free agency. The Bobcats started the [[2011\u201312 Charlotte Bobcats season|2011\u201312 season]] with a close 96\u201395 win against [[Stephen Jackson]] and the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in their home opener but wins would be hard to come by after that. In the lockout-shortened season the Bobcats struggled and posted an NBA-worst record of 7\u201359, losing their last 23 games of the season. In a nationally televised game against the [[New York Knicks]] the Bobcats recorded yet another loss as their win percentage dropped to .106, setting a new record for the worst season by an NBA team in history. (As this season had been shortened by the lockout, the 1972\u201373 [[Philadelphia 76ers]] still hold the record for most losses in a season, with 73.) On April 30, 2012, the Bobcats announced that Silas would not return to the team for the 2012\u201313 season. [[St. John's Red Storm|St. John's]] assistant [[Mike Dunlap]] was named his successor.\n\nDespite having the best odds of winning the draft lottery, the Bobcats did not obtain the first overall pick. In the [[2012 NBA draft]], the Bobcats selected [[Michael Kidd-Gilchrist]] with the second overall pick. They also selected [[Jeffery Taylor]] with the thirty-first pick. They added [[Ben Gordon]], [[Ramon Sessions]] and [[Brendan Haywood]]. The Bobcats' first game was against the [[Indiana Pacers]], and they won the game 90\u201389 in a heated last minute battle, snapping their 23-game losing streak. On November 13, 2012, the Bobcats traded guard [[Matt Carroll (basketball)|Matt Carroll]] to the [[New Orleans Hornets]] for power forward [[Hakim Warrick]]. The team seemed to rebound with a 7\u20135 start to the season in which 6 of the 7 wins were by 4 points or less. However, they promptly went on an 18-game losing streak from which they never recovered, snapping the streak in a victory at Chicago on New Year's Eve. They finished 21\u201361, the second-worst record in the league. On April 23, 2013, Dunlap was fired, reportedly because the players were turned off by his heavy-handed coaching style.

In 2004, Charlotte was granted a new franchise, the Bobcats. After the 2013\u201314 season, the Bobcats changed their name to the Hornets and reclaimed the history and records of the 1988\u20132002 Hornets. As a result, the Hornets are now [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] as having suspended operations from 2002 to 2004, while the Pelicans are now retconned as having joined the league in 2002 as an expansion team.\n\nIn the [[2014 NBA draft]], the Hornets had the No. 9 pick from an earlier trade with the [[Detroit Pistons]], which they used to select [[Noah Vonleh]] from [[Indiana Hoosiers|Indiana]]. In the same draft they acquired [[UConn Huskies men's basketball|UConn Husky]] [[Shabazz Napier]] (24th overall pick), [[Dwight Powell]] from [[Stanford Cardinal men's basketball|Stanford]], and [[Semaj Christon]] from [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier]] in the second round, later trading [[Shabazz Napier|Napier]] to the [[Miami Heat]] for [[P.

The Hornets then traded Hopson to the [[New Orleans Pelicans]] in exchange for cash considerations.\n\nDuring the first year of free agency as the renamed Hornets, the Hornets signed former [[Indiana Pacers]] shooting guard [[Lance Stephenson]] for three years at $27 million with a team option in the third year. The Hornets also signed former [[Utah Jazz]] and [[Atlanta Hawks]] forward [[Marvin Williams]] to a two-year, $14 million contract. They later added former [[New Orleans Pelicans]] guard [[Brian Roberts (basketball)|Brian Roberts]], who became the first player in the modern-day Hornets era to play for both the New Orleans Hornets and the Charlotte Hornets. Charlotte finished with a 33\u201349 record.\n\nAfter the stressful first season as the \"reborn\" Hornets, the Hornets signed and traded for promising young NBA players such as [[Nicolas Batum]], former Knicks star [[Jeremy Lin]], [[Jeremy Lamb]], [[Tyler Hansbrough]], [[Spencer Hawes]] and undrafted rookie [[Aaron Harrison]]. In the [[2015 NBA draft]], the Hornets selected [[University of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]] star [[Frank Kaminsky]] with the 9th pick. \nThrough the first 16 games of the season the Hornets were 9\u20137, including a 7-game home winning streak. This marked first time they were multiple games above .500 since the 2013 season. After Feb. 1, the Hornets went 25\u20139 in the regular season, which became the third-best winning percentage (.736) in that time span, with only the Warriors and Spurs having better marks. On April 2, the Hornets clinched a playoff spot. The Hornets finished 48\u201334, 3rd overall in the division, and obtained the most regular season victories since the 1999\u20132000 season.

Since then, the Hornets have recorded ten playoff appearances under two different franchises.\n\n==Early years==\n===1985\u20131988: Birth of the Hornets===\nIn 1985, the NBA, then with 23 teams, was planning to expand by four teams by the 1988\u201389 season. [[George Shinn]], an entrepreneur from [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]], wanted to bring an NBA team to the Charlotte area, and he assembled a group of prominent local businessmen to head the prospective franchise. The Charlotte area had long been a hotbed for [[college basketball]]. The [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]'s four North Carolina teams, as well as local teams [[Charlotte 49ers men's basketball|UNC Charlotte]], [[Davidson Wildcats men's basketball|Davidson]], and [[Johnson C. Smith University|Johnson C. Smith]], had large and loyal fan bases in the city. Charlotte was also one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and was previously one of the three in-state regional homes to the [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Carolina Cougars]], from 1969 to 1974.\n\nSome critics doubted that Charlotte, then a city mostly known for banking, could support an NBA team; one ''[[Sacramento Bee]]'' columnist joked, \"The only franchise Charlotte is going to get is one with [[Golden Arches]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jmu.edu/montpelier/issues/winter02/main/hockey.html |title=Montpelier \u2013 James Madison University Magazine |publisher=Jmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref>  However, Shinn's [[:wikt:ace in the hole|ace in the hole]] was the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], a state-of-the-art arena under construction that would seat almost 24,000 spectators \u2013 the largest basketball-specific arena ever to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. On April 5, 1987, [[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]] called Shinn to tell him his group had been awarded the NBA's 24th franchise, to begin play in [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988]]. Franchises were also granted to [[Miami Heat|Miami]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], and [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]].\n\nOriginally, the new team was going to be called the ''Charlotte Spirit'', but a name-the-team contest yielded \"Hornets\" as the winning choice. The name was derived from the city's fierce resistance to [[British people|British]] occupation during the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]], which prompted the British commander, [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], to refer to it as \"a veritable hornet's nest of rebellion\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Lassiter |first=Emily |title=Charlotte Hornets |url=http://blogs.lib.unc.edu/ncm/index.php/2009/08/24/charlotte-hornets/comment-page-1/ |work=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Libraries |date=August 24, 2009 |accessdate=January 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Posnanski |first=Joe |title=A brief history of the Charlotte Hornets (and other things) |url=http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/05/22/a-brief-history-of-the-charlotte-hornets-and-other-things/ |publisher=[[NBC Sports]] |date=May 22, 2013 |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}</ref> The name had been used for Charlotte sports teams before, including a [[minor league baseball]] team that was located in the city from 1901 to 1972, as well as a [[World Football League]] team that played there from 1974 to 1975. In addition the [[Charlotte 49ers men's basketball|Charlotte 49ers]] and [[Davidson Wildcats men's basketball|Davidson Wildcats]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] play annually for the Hornets' Nest Trophy.\n\nThe team received attention when it chose [[teal (color)|teal]] as its primary color, setting off a sports fashion craze in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with many pro and amateur clubs soon following with teal in their color schemes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} The team's uniforms were designed by international designer and North Carolina native [[Alexander Julian]], and featured a first for NBA uniforms\u2014pinstripes. Similar designs by the [[Orlando Magic]], [[Toronto Raptors]], [[Houston Rockets]], [[Chicago Bulls]], and [[Indiana Pacers]] followed soon after.\n\nShinn hired Carl Scheer, a longtime NBA executive, as the team's first general manager. Scheer preferred a roster of veteran players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as possible, with a goal of making the playoffs in five years. Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant [[Dick Harter]] was also hired, becoming the team's first head coach.\n\nIn 1988, the Hornets and the [[Miami Heat]] were part of the [[1988 NBA Expansion Draft]]. Unlike many expansion franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of young players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several veterans in hopes of putting a competitive lineup on the court right away. The team also had three draft picks at the [[1988 NBA draft]].\n\n===1988\u20131991===\nIn their [[1988\u201389 Charlotte Hornets season|inaugural season]] the Hornets were led by ex-Pistons guard [[Kelly Tripucka]], who provided instant offense and was Charlotte's top scorer for the franchise's first two seasons. Other notable players included sharpshooting rookie and first-ever draft choice [[Rex Chapman]], a long-distance scoring threat, and floor general [[Muggsy Bogues]], the shortest player in NBA history at 5'3\".

The Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20 wins and 62 losses.\n\nDespite initial concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were a runaway hit in their first season, leading the NBA in attendance, a feat they would achieve seven more times in Charlotte. Eventually, the Hornets would sell out 364 consecutive games\u2014almost nine consecutive seasons.\n\nThe Hornets' [[1989\u201390 Charlotte Hornets season|second season]] was a struggle from start to finish. The team lost their first five games before defeating the [[Orlando Magic]] in the first meeting between the two franchises. Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter's defense-oriented style, and he was replaced mid-season by assistant [[Gene Littles]] following a dismal 8\u201332 start. Despite the change, the team continued to struggle during the second half of the season, suffering through a 3\u201331 stretch from January through March. In the end, the team took a step backwards, finishing the season with a disappointing 19\u201363 record \u2013 one game worse than their previous season.\n\nIn the [[1990 NBA draft]], the Hornets selected guard [[Kendall Gill]] with the 5th overall pick. The team showed improvement during the [[1990\u201391 Charlotte Hornets season|1990\u201391 season]]. They won eight of their first 15 games, including a 120\u2013105 victory over the [[Washington Bullets]]. However, the team went cold, losing their next 11 games and falling to an 8\u201318 record. The Hornets, who hosted the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]], finished their third season with a 26\u201356 record. Despite the team's seven-game improvement over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired at the end of the season and replaced by general manager [[Allan Bristow]].\n\n==Playoffs and success==\n===1991\u20131995===\nWith the first pick in the [[1991 NBA draft]], the Hornets drafted [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] from the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. Johnson had an impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and rebounds, and winning the 1992 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Additionally, Guard [[Kendall Gill]] led the club in scoring, averaging over 20 points per game. The team stayed in contention for a playoff spot until March, but in the end, they finished [[1991\u201392 Charlotte Hornets season|the season]] with a record of 31\u201351. Despite continuing to improve, the Hornets failed to qualify for the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season.\n\n====1992\u20131993: First playoff appearance====\nThe Hornets were in the lottery again in 1992 and won the second overall pick in the draft, using it to select [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] center [[Alonzo Mourning]]. The Hornets now had two 20\u201310 threats in Johnson and Mourning, who with Kendall Gill, formed perhaps the league's top young trio. The team finished [[1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets season|their fifth season]] at 44\u201338, their first-ever winning record and good enough for the first [[1993 NBA Playoffs|playoff berth]] in franchise history. Finishing fifth in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], the Hornets upset the [[Boston Celtics]] in the first round, with Mourning winning the series with a 20-footer in game four.<ref>{{cite web |last=Smith, Jr. |first=Pat |title=ESPN \u2013 The Mourning After \u2013 Classic |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/news/story?page=add_mourning_alonzo |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=June 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> However, the Hornets lacked the experience and depth to defeat the [[New York Knicks]], falling in five games in the second round.\n\nThe Hornets finished the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]] with a 41\u201341 record, narrowly missing the playoffs. Despite injuries to both Johnson and Mourning, the two led the team in points-per-game. The [[1994\u201395 NBA season|following season]], the Hornets finished the regular season with 50 wins and 32 losses, and returned to [[1995 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]]. Johnson and Mourning again led the team in points-per-game, while also leading the club in rebounding. However, Charlotte was bounced from the playoffs in the first round, falling to the [[Chicago Bulls]] in four games. Following the season, the Johnson\u2013Mourning era would come to an end, as the Hornets traded Mourning to the [[Miami Heat]] for forward [[Glen Rice]], center [[Matt Geiger]], and guard [[Khalid Reeves]].\n\n===1995\u20131998===\n[[Glen Rice]] would make an immediate impact after joining the Hornets, leading the team in scoring and points-per-game during the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]]. While Rice and Johnson provided high-powered scoring, Geiger tied with Johnson for the team lead in rebounds, and All-Star guard [[Kenny Anderson (basketball)|Kenny Anderson]] ran the point for the injured [[Muggsy Bogues]]. The Hornets were competitive, but failed to qualify for the playoffs during the season, again finishing with a 41\u201341 record. [[Allan Bristow|Bristow]] resigned at the end of the season, and was replaced by NBA legend [[Dave Cowens]].\n\nThe 1996 off-season was again marked by vast changes: Anderson declined to re-sign, Johnson was shipped to the Knicks for power forward [[Anthony Mason (basketball)|Anthony Mason]], and the team made a trade on [[1996 NBA draft|draft day 1996]]. They acquired center [[Vlade Divac]] from the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] for the rights to [[Kobe Bryant]], who the Hornets picked 13th in the draft. The new-look Hornets were successful, with Divac and Geiger providing the center combination, Mason averaging a double-double, Bogues back at the point, and Rice having the finest season of his career. The team achieved the best season in its history at the time, finishing with 54 victories compared to only 28 losses, and making it [[1997 NBA Playoffs|back to the playoffs]]. Rice finishing third in the league in scoring, earning all-NBA second team honors, and was also the All-Star Game MVP, setting several scoring records. Despite the success during the regular season, the Hornets went down rather meekly to the Knicks in three straight games.\n\nThe [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398]] season was also successful. [[Muggsy Bogues]] was traded two games into the season, and the team picked up point guard [[David Wesley]] and shooting guard [[Bobby Phills]]. With Wesley, Phills, Rice, Mason, and Divac, the Hornets romped through the regular season, finishing with a 51\u201331  record; Rice had another good season, as he finished sixth in league scoring and earned all-NBA third team honors. The Hornets made it to back-to-back playoffs for the first time in franchise history, and advanced to the second round, only to again be stopped by the Bulls.\n\n==End of an era==\n===1998\u20132002: Final years of original Hornets===\nThe [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399]] season was turbulent. The season didn't start until February, as the lockout shortened the regular season to only 50 games. Additionally, [[Glen Rice]] was traded to the Lakers for [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and [[Elden Campbell]], and [[Dave Cowens]] resigned midway through the season. Cowens still holds the highest winning percentage among Hornets head coaches. He was replaced by former Celtics teammate [[Paul Silas]], who became the franchise's fifth head coach. The team finished the season with a 26\u201324 record, but failed to qualify for the playoffs.\n\nThe [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]] saw a return to prominence, with the addition of point guard [[Baron Davis]], the third overall draft pick. The Hornets tore through much of the season, but tragedy struck on January 12, 2000, when fan favorite and top reserve [[Bobby Phills]] was killed in an automobile accident; the Hornets retired his No. 13 on February 9, 2000. After finishing the regular season with a 49\u201333 record, the team was able to return to the playoffs, where they lost to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the first round. The season, however, was overshadowed by events off the court. The team's popularity had begun to sag due to fan discontent with owner George Shinn's personnel moves; he had reportedly traded Mourning and several other stars out of an unwillingness to pay them market value. Additionally, [[Michael Jordan]], a North Carolina native, began negotiations to become part-owner of the team, but talks collapsed when Shinn refused to grant Jordan total control over the basketball side of the operation. Because of this, the team's attendance dropped to eleventh in the league for the season.\n\nIn the [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301]] season, with the additions of [[Jamal Mashburn]] and [[P.J. Brown]], the Hornets managed to return to the playoffs, finishing the season with a 46\u201336 record. While they upset the third-seeded Heat in the first round and made it to the conference semifinals for just the third time in franchise history, they lost to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in seven games. Despite the team continuing to play well, their popularity continued to fall, with the team finishing 21st in the league in attendance for the season.\n\nThe Hornets returned to the playoffs [[2001\u201302 NBA season|the following season]], finishing the regular season at 44\u201338. After defeating the [[Orlando Magic]] in the first round, they were upended by the [[New Jersey Nets]] in five games in the Conference Semifinals. The team finished the season twenty-ninth (last) in the league in attendance, a stark contrast to their earlier years in Charlotte. Before the Hornets were eliminated from the playoffs, the NBA approved a deal for the team to move to New Orleans following the season.\n\n===2002\u20132003: Relocation to New Orleans===\nThe Hornets popularity with the city of Charlotte began to wane during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

The consensus was that while Charlotte was as basketball-crazy as ever, fans took out their anger at Shinn on the team. Shinn had also become discontented with the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], which, although considered state-of-the-art when it opened in 1988, had by then been considered obsolete due to a limited number of luxury boxes.

Shinn issued an ultimatum: unless the city built a new arena at no cost to him, the Hornets would leave town. The city initially refused, leading Shinn to consider moving the team to either [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], or [[St. Louis]]. Of the cities in the running, only St. Louis had an NBA-ready arena (Savvis Center, now known as the [[Enterprise Center]]) already in place and was a larger media market than Charlotte at the time; also, it was the only one of the four to have an previously had hosted an NBA franchise \u2014 the [[St. Louis Hawks]], who moved to [[Atlanta]] in 1968.\n\nFinally, a new arena in [[Charlotte center city|Uptown]], which would eventually become the Charlotte Bobcats Arena (later to become Time Warner Cable Arena and now known as the [[Spectrum Center (arena)|Spectrum Center]]), was included in a non-binding referendum for a larger arts-related package, and Shinn withdrew his application to move the team.  Polls showed the referendum on its way to passage.  However, just days before the referendum, Mayor [[Pat McCrory]] vetoed a [[living wage]] ordinance. The veto prompted many of the city's black ministers to oppose the referendum; they felt it was immoral for the city to build a new arena when city employees weren't paid enough to make a living.<ref>[http://charlotte.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A535&comments=yes World Class City, Third World Paycheck] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113092536/http://charlotte.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A535&comments=yes |date=2009-01-13 }}.

They used that pick to draft forward [[Bismack Biyombo]] and then drafted [[Kemba Walker]], the [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player]], with the 9th pick in the draft. They also made a few more acquisitions by trading their 2013 second-round draft pick to the Thunder for 7-footer [[Byron Mullens]] and signing sharpshooter [[Reggie Williams (basketball, born 1986)|Reggie Williams]] in free agency. The Bobcats started the [[2011\u201312 Charlotte Bobcats season|2011\u201312 season]] with a close 96\u201395 win against [[Stephen Jackson]] and the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in their home opener but wins would be hard to come by after that. In the lockout-shortened season the Bobcats struggled and posted an NBA-worst record of 7\u201359, losing their last 23 games of the season. In a nationally televised game against the [[New York Knicks]] the Bobcats recorded yet another loss as their win percentage dropped to .106, setting a new record for the worst season by an NBA team in history. (As this season had been shortened by the lockout, the 1972\u201373 [[Philadelphia 76ers]] still hold the record for most losses in a season, with 73.) On April 30, 2012, the Bobcats announced that Silas would not return to the team for the 2012\u201313 season. [[St. John's Red Storm|St. John's]] assistant [[Mike Dunlap]] was named his successor.\n\nDespite having the best odds of winning the draft lottery, the Bobcats did not obtain the first overall pick. In the [[2012 NBA draft]], the Bobcats selected [[Michael Kidd-Gilchrist]] with the second overall pick. They also selected [[Jeffery Taylor]] with the thirty-first pick. They added [[Ben Gordon]], [[Ramon Sessions]] and [[Brendan Haywood]]. The Bobcats' first game was against the [[Indiana Pacers]], and they won the game 90\u201389 in a heated last minute battle, snapping their 23-game losing streak. On November 13, 2012, the Bobcats traded guard [[Matt Carroll (basketball)|Matt Carroll]] to the [[New Orleans Hornets]] for power forward [[Hakim Warrick]]. The team seemed to rebound with a 7\u20135 start to the season in which 6 of the 7 wins were by 4 points or less. However, they promptly went on an 18-game losing streak from which they never recovered, snapping the streak in a victory at Chicago on New Year's Eve. They finished 21\u201361, the second-worst record in the league. On April 23, 2013, Dunlap was fired, reportedly because the players were turned off by his heavy-handed coaching style. Dunlap would be replaced by former [[Los Angeles Lakers]] assistant head coach [[Steve Clifford]].\n\n==The Hornets return==\n===2012\u20132014: Final years of the Bobcats===\nOn May 21, 2013, Jordan officially announced the organization had submitted an application to change the name of the franchise to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014\u201315 NBA season, pending a majority vote for approval by the NBA Board of Governors at a meeting in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] on July 18, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/bobcats/bobcats-sports-entertainment-applies-change-teams-name-hornets|title=Bobcats Sports & Entertainment Applies to Change Team's Name to Hornets|date=May 21, 2013|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|accessdate=May 21, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608024248/http://www.nba.com/bobcats/bobcats-sports-entertainment-applies-change-teams-name-hornets|archivedate=June 8, 2013}}</ref> Then Deputy Commissioner and COO [[Adam Silver]] (now NBA Commissioner) previously said it would take about 18 months for the team to change its name, but pointed out the fact that the league owns the rights to the Hornets name could speed up the process.

At a press conference heralding the change, team officials also announced that as part of a deal with the NBA and the Pelicans, the renamed Hornets reclaimed the history and records of the 1988\u20132002 Hornets, while all of the Hornets' records during their time in New Orleans from 2002 to 2013 remained with the Pelicans.<ref name=\"Windhorst\"/> Charlotte had already been using past footage of the original Hornets era as part of the \"Buzz City\" campaign.\n\nTo restate and clarify a confusing series of events: after the 2002 season, the original Hornets moved to New Orleans. In 2004, Charlotte was granted a new franchise, the Bobcats. After the 2013\u201314 season, the Bobcats changed their name to the Hornets and reclaimed the history and records of the 1988\u20132002 Hornets. As a result, the Hornets are now [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] as having suspended operations from 2002 to 2004, while the Pelicans are now retconned as having joined the league in 2002 as an expansion team.\n\nIn the [[2014 NBA draft]], the Hornets had the No. 9 pick from an earlier trade with the [[Detroit Pistons]], which they used to select [[Noah Vonleh]] from [[Indiana Hoosiers|Indiana]]. In the same draft they acquired [[UConn Huskies men's basketball|UConn Husky]] [[Shabazz Napier]] (24th overall pick), [[Dwight Powell]] from [[Stanford Cardinal men's basketball|Stanford]], and [[Semaj Christon]] from [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier]] in the second round, later trading [[Shabazz Napier|Napier]] to the [[Miami Heat]] for [[P.

The Hornets then traded Hopson to the [[New Orleans Pelicans]] in exchange for cash considerations.\n\nDuring the first year of free agency as the renamed Hornets, the Hornets signed former [[Indiana Pacers]] shooting guard [[Lance Stephenson]] for three years at $27 million with a team option in the third year. The Hornets also signed former [[Utah Jazz]] and [[Atlanta Hawks]] forward [[Marvin Williams]] to a two-year, $14 million contract. They later added former [[New Orleans Pelicans]] guard [[Brian Roberts (basketball)|Brian Roberts]], who became the first player in the modern-day Hornets era to play for both the New Orleans Hornets and the Charlotte Hornets. Charlotte finished with a 33-49 record.\n\nAfter the stressful first season as the \"reborn\" Hornets, the Hornets signed and traded for promising young NBA players such as [[Nicolas Batum]], former Knicks star [[Jeremy Lin]], [[Jeremy Lamb]], [[Tyler Hansbrough]], [[Spencer Hawes]] and undrafted rookie [[Aaron Harrison]]. In the [[2015 NBA draft]], the Hornets selected [[University of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]] star [[Frank Kaminsky]] with the 9th pick. \nThrough the first 16 games of the season the Hornets were 9-7, including a 7-game home winning streak.

After Feb. 1, the Hornets went 25-9 in the regular season, which became the third-best winning percentage (.736) in that time span, with only the Warriors and Spurs having better marks. On April 2, the Hornets clinched a playoff spot. The Hornets finished 48-34, 3rd overall in the division, and obtained the most regular season victories since the 1999\u20132000 season.

Catholic nuns and priests took efforts to find shelter and food for the Central American refugees. Due to the political nature of the immigration, many of the immigrants became involved in political activism upon arriving in the US and they protested US government political interventions in Central America.

[[Garifuna language|Garifuna]]-speaking Black Caribs ([[Garifuna Americans]]) from [[Belize]] and [[Honduras]] settled in different areas depending on whether they identified more with their black race or their Hispanic ethnicity. If they identified with the race more they settled with African-Americans. If they identified more with the Hispanic ethnicity they settled with Central Americans.<ref name=RodriguezOct2000p36/> In 1990 the median household income of Central Americans was $17,429 and 6% of those aged 25 or older had a [[bachelor's degree]].<ref name=RodriguezOct2000p37>Rodriguez, Nestor, \"Hispanic and Asian Immigration Waves in Houston,\" p.

In 2015, Mares first introduced his theory of 'mutual contribution' in ''The British Contribution to the Development of Piracy in the Golden Age of Piracy'', supporting his secondary argument that the longer [[periodization]] of this era should be understood as an uninterrupted and continuous process with its points of peaks and regressions.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=xG3DDwAAQBAJ|title=The Golden Age of Piracy and the British Contribution to its Development|last=Mares|first=Martin|date=2019-12-11|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-346-08101-8|language=en}}</ref> From the economical perspective, these ideas were later expanded by Nicol\u00e1s Rodr\u00edguez Arosemena.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rodr\u00edguez Arosemena|first=Nicol\u00e1s|date=2018-12-15|title=The Dominium Mundi Game and the Case for Artificial Intelligence in Economics and the Law|url=https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/pramprapa/90560.htm}}</ref> Later, Mares expanded some of his ideas in ''The Role of Jamaica in Fostering Maritime Piracy In the Atlantic Ocean, 1655-1702,'' presenting pirates as an integral element of British imperial endeavour by an implementation of a complex framework of relations between influential members involved in Jamaican colonial administration and prominent individuals of pirate crews.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mares|first=Martin|title=The Role of Jamaica in Fostering Maritime Piracy In the Atlantic Ocean, 1655-1702|url=https://www.academia.edu/35943697|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Mares has published an academic article about [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]], one of the understudied British proponents of [[Scientific racism|Victorian scientific racism]], presenting Hunt as one of the most influential figures for the later development of [[Racism|racist beliefs]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mares|first=Martin|date=2018|title=James Hunt on the Quest for Awakening Robert Knox'S Ideas and Reterritorialization of His Racial Theories into the Mainstream Scientific Discourse in Mid-Victorian Britain.|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=3242770}}</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\nIn 2014, Mares published his work 'The Art of Creating a Free City: A Philosophical Analysis with Special Focus on Ancient Societies', making the case that modern societies, compared to [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], are driven by the dogmatic beliefs in the [[economics]] as an ultimate governing force, which separates and fragments the civic society into entrenched groups, crippling the [[democracy]] itself. By contrast, Mares uses the examples of [[Polis|Greek city states]], agoras and [[Plato|Plato's]] concept of justice as fairness to propose a different model for thinking about the civic society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/work/best_book/73231450-the-art-of-creating-a-free-city-a-philosophical-analysis-with-special-f|title=The Art of Creating a Free City|website=www.goodreads.com|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref>\n\nIn his 2016 scholarly article \"Kleos, Nostos and Ponos in the Homeric Tradition\", Mares defended the concept of a traditional [[hero]]ism against [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] critiques, arguing that achieving an eternal glory ([[kleos]]) through an ordeal ([[ponos]]) with a successful homecoming ([[nostos]]) should be viewed as a clear manifestation of one's meaningful existence - imprinting of hero's legacy. Mares illustrated this understanding by using examples of [[Achilles]], [[Odysseus]] and [[Diomedes]], presenting them as different avatars of such heroic qualities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mares|first=Martin|title=Kleos, Nostos and Ponos in The Homeric Tradition|url=https://www.academia.edu/30605160|journal=The Classical Review|language=en}}</ref> Brazilian scholar Flavia R.

In 2015, Mares first introduced his theory of 'mutual contribution' in ''The British Contribution to the Development of Piracy in the Golden Age of Piracy'', supporting his secondary argument that the longer [[periodization]] of this era should be understood as an uninterrupted and continuous process with its points of peaks and regressions.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=xG3DDwAAQBAJ|title=The Golden Age of Piracy and the British Contribution to its Development|last=Mares|first=Martin|date=2019-12-11|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-346-08101-8|language=en}}</ref> From the economical perspective, these ideas were later expanded by Nicol\u00e1s Rodr\u00edguez Arosemena.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rodr\u00edguez Arosemena|first=Nicol\u00e1s|date=2018-12-15|title=The Dominium Mundi Game and the Case for Artificial Intelligence in Economics and the Law|url=https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/pramprapa/90560.htm}}</ref> Later, Mares expanded some of his ideas in ''The Role of Jamaica in Fostering Maritime Piracy In the Atlantic Ocean, 1655-1702,'' presenting pirates as an integral element of British imperial endeavour by an implementation of a complex framework of relations between influential members involved in Jamaican colonial administration and prominent individuals of pirate crews.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mares|first=Martin|title=The Role of Jamaica in Fostering Maritime Piracy In the Atlantic Ocean, 1655-1702|url=https://www.academia.edu/35943697|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Mares has published an academic article about [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]], one of the understudied British proponents of [[Scientific racism|Victorian scientific racism]], presenting Hunt as one of the most influential figures for the later development of [[Racism|racist beliefs]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mares|first=Martin|date=2018|title=James Hunt on the Quest for Awakening Robert Knox'S Ideas and Reterritorialization of His Racial Theories into the Mainstream Scientific Discourse in Mid-Victorian Britain.|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=3242770}}</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\nIn 2014, Mares published his work 'The Art of Creating a Free City: A Philosophical Analysis with Special Focus on Ancient Societies', making the case that modern societies, compared to [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], are driven by the dogmatic beliefs in the [[economics]] as an ultimate governing force, which separates and fragments the civic society into entrenched groups, crippling the [[democracy]] itself. By contrast, Mares uses the examples of [[Polis|Greek city states]], agoras and [[Plato|Plato's]] concept of justice as fairness to propose a different model for thinking about the civic society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/work/best_book/73231450-the-art-of-creating-a-free-city-a-philosophical-analysis-with-special-f|title=The Art of Creating a Free City|website=www.goodreads.com|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref>\n\nIn his 2016 scholarly article \"Kleos, Nostos and Ponos in the Homeric Tradition\", Mares defended the concept of a traditional [[Hero|heroism]] against [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] critiques, arguing that achieving an eternal glory ([[kleos]]) through an ordeal ([[ponos]]) with a successful homecoming ([[nostos]]) should be viewed as a clear manifestation of one's meaningful existence - imprinting of hero's legacy. Mares illustrated this understanding by using examples of [[Achilles]], [[Odysseus]] and [[Diomedes]], presenting them as different avatars of such heroic qualities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mares|first=Martin|title=Kleos, Nostos and Ponos in The Homeric Tradition|url=https://www.academia.edu/30605160|journal=The Classical Review|language=en}}</ref> Brazilian scholar Flavia R.

Streams flowing off the then-mighty [[Acadian_orogeny|Acadian Mountains]] deposited [[sediment]] where the river met a sea (now the [[Allegheny Plateau]]. Eventually the Taconics eroded to their present size and the waters dried up, leaving a mostly flat plain.\n\nDuring this time period, a [[meteor]] is believed to have struck the area. '''[[Panther Mountain (New York)|Panther Mountain]]''' is the remains of its [[Impact crater|crater]].\n\nTwo hundred million years ago, as [[continental drift]] pushed up the Appalachians, the delta region rose almost uniformly into a [[plateau]] rather than breaking up into smaller mountains. Streams that formed over time eroded gaps and valleys, leaving today's \"mountains.\"\n\n===The Ice Ages===\n\nThe next great change in the Catskill landscape was caused by the most recent of four periods of [[glaciation]], the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsin]]. Every mountain except Slide (and perhaps [[West Kill Mountain|West Kill]]) was covered. The glaciers left behind lakes when they melted, some of which became [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]] in the 20th century.\n\nSome geologists also believe the glaciers scoured off sedimentary layers that may have contained coal, noting the surfeit of coal to the south in Pennsylvania and that the white [[quartz]] pebbles found atop Slide Mountain are often an indicator that one has reached the bottom of a coal bed in those regions.\n\n==Human history==\n===Prehistory===\n\nWhile the matter has yet to be fully researched, there seems to have been no large-scale long-term Native American presence in the mountains.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The local [[Mohican]] and [[Munsee]] tribes used land and water routes through the mountains to get to the places beyond them, hunted the abundant game and used the mountains in some of their rituals, but in general chose not to live there due to the difficulty of farming the land.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n===Dutch settlement===\n\nRobert Juet, one of [[Henry Hudson]]'s crew, was the first European to take note of the Catskills on the ''[[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]'''s 1609 expedition up the river. Some hardy pioneers, explorers and traders followed over the next several decades, leaving their imprint on the region in placenames, but generally not settling the region to a significantly greater extent than the Indians did.\n\nIn 1667, as a result of the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] which ended the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], England's wartime victory was ratified and the British crown took over colonial administration of what was now New York.\n\nOver the next several decades, regular rumors of gold strikes drew more settlers to the region, though none has ever been found. Trade in [[beaver]] hats spurred more exploration and settlement of the region.\n\n===The Hardenbergh Patent===\n\nThe most important event in the history of the colonial Catskills took place in the first decade of the 18th century during [[Queen Anne's War]]. In 1706 an ambitious speculator, major [[Johannes Hardenbergh]], and his partner, [[Jacob Rutsen]], petitioned the governor, [[Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon|Edward, Viscount Cornbury]], for a land grant in the mountains of Ulster County, attempting to head off another petition by a group of [[Hurley (town), New York|Hurley]] farmers who wanted pasture in the area yet had not properly purchased the land from the local Indian tribes as the law required.\n\nThe lack of a good [[Surveying|survey]] of the area complicated matters somewhat. After years of arguing, haggling and taking advantage of Cornbury's loose ethics, the Patent was granted on April 20, 1708.\n\nSince they had applied as a corporation, Hardenbergh and Rutsen were exempt from laws limiting any such grant to 2,000 acres (8&nbsp;km\u00b2). Yet they wound up, through what some say was a mistake, with title to a thousand times that land, or practically the entire Catskill region as we know it today, in the form of a rough triangle that started west of Kingston and extended, at least on paper, to the west branch of the Delaware.\n\nSettlement was impeded for the next thirty years due to the lack of a survey. Hardenbergh, however, managed to enrich himself by selling shares in the partnership, much to the consternation of colonial governors who wanted a firmer bulwark against French ambitions in North America. There had been no good survey, and no one knew where the boundaries of the patent lay, much less any [[Country subdivision|subdivisions]]. Indian tribes upset that rivals had sold their land out from under them and squatters who had moved into the area before sabotaged the Wooster brothers' attempts at a first real survey of the region in the 1740s.\n\nIn his later years Hardenbergh was helped greatly by [[Robert Livingston (1688-1775)|Robert Livingston]], who saw the region's economic potential and would acquire {{convert|1000000|acre|km2 sqmi}} of the [[Johannes Hardenbergh|Hardenbergh Patent]].<ref>http://livingstonmanor.net/Timeline.htm</ref>  By the time of Hardenbergh's death in 1745 settlement was at last beginning to get underway. Five years later, when the entire Patent was subdivided and accounted for, the Hardenbergh land company was dissolved.\n\nThe unclear early history of land ownership in the days of the Patent, however, would impact the region for generations to come.\n\n===The Bartram expedition===\n[[Image:Catskill Mountain House.jpg|thumb|300px|''View from The Mountain House'', 1836, [[Thomas Cole]]]]\n\nIn 1753 the early American [[natural history|naturalists]] [[John Bartram]] and his son [[William Bartram|William]] went to the Catskills as part of their explorations into the colonies' plant life, focusing particularly on the [[balsam fir]], which was known among the colonists as balm of [[Gilead]] fir and believed by both them and the Indians to have curative powers. While their explorations were not extensive, the elder Bartram's short written account of the adventure, \u201cA Journey to Ye Cat Skill Mountains with Billy,\u201d was widely read and appreciated both in America and abroad. It is the first literary appreciation of the Catskills as a natural environment.\n\nThe Bartrams were the first to document the wide variety of tree species in the mountains. Officially, the trip was a failure as the balsam seeds they managed to collect failed to flourish in England.  But in the course of collecting them they explored the area of the '''Pine Orchard''' near [[North-South Lake|North and South Lakes]] on the Escarpment in Greene County, which would in the next century become the site of the '''[[Catskill Mountain House]]'''.\n\n===The mid-18th century===\n\nRobert Livingston's [[Robert Livingston (1708-1790)|son]] gradually took over managing his interest in the lands he had managed to acquire, and saw their future more in terms of the timber on them than the land itself. Drawing on the family's [[Scotland|Scottish]] roots, he sought to rename them the [[Lothian]] Hills and envisioned a grand scheme in which [[castles]] named after originals in Scotland would be built on the mountaintops and sold to members of the European nobility who wished to have grand manors.\n\nThese plans were put on hold in 1769 when [[John Bradstreet]], a British [[lieutenant colonel]] who had fought with distinction in the recent [[French and Indian War]] filed papers with the crown charging that the Hardenbergh Patent had been improperly granted and could thus be regranted; he claimed a 50,000 acre (200&nbsp;km\u00b2) slice as was his right as a retired officer. Other officers joined in with additional, smaller claims.\n\nThe colonial governor, John Murray Dunmore, found in 1771 a solution that temporarily settled the issue but pleased no one: he awarded Bradstreet 20,000 acres (80&nbsp;km\u00b2) in what is now Delaware County but said nothing about the legality of the original patent. Back in London the [[Privy Council]] urged King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] to block it, and he duly ordered the new governor, [[William Tryon]], not to sign any grant for the land.\n\nBradstreet died in 1774, and his daughters were widely expected to take the fight to court, but very soon that took a backseat to other events.\n\n===The Revolutionary War===\n\nAs tensions increased between the colonies and Britain during the early 1770s over how to pay for the war, the Catskills saw this divide play out rather sharply. The large landowners like Livingston and the Hardenberghs, fearing Parliament would settle the matter with a land tax that would vastly cut into their wealth, increasingly took stands that would lead to independence. Their [[tenant farmers]], on the other hand, were, as Livingston put it, \"resolved to stand by their King,\" despite their landlords' efforts to drum up revolutionary sentiment among them, in the belief that if it came down to war, the Crown would confiscate the holdings of those who had opposed it and distribute smaller parcels back to those who had been loyal.\n\nThis came to a head in 1777, when Lieutenant Jacob Rose raised an army of several hundred of the region's young men to go fight alongside the British in return for 50 acres (0.2&nbsp;km\u00b2) each. Rose's Rangers, as they were called, had to make its way through the strongly Patriot Hudson Valley to rendezvous with British regulars in New York City, however, and was captured in the vicinity of [[Schunemunk Mountain]] in [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] after a skirmish with local [[militia]]. Prisoners were taken to [[Fort Montgomery (Hudson River)|Fort Montgomery]] and tried for treason against the recently established state of New York. Most were pardoned in exchange for committing to serve in the [[Continental Army]]; Rose and a few other holdouts were hanged.\n\nThe failure of Rose's mission and the burning of [[Kingston (city), New York|Kingston]] by British forces that year severely blunted Tory sentiment in the Catskills, and for the remainder of the war the region posed no threat to the Patriot cause.\n\n===Jewish resort destination===\n::''See [[Borscht Belt]]''\n\nThe Catskills became a major resort destination for Jewish New Yorkers in the mid-20th century. [[Borscht Belt]] is an informal term for the summer resorts of the Catskill Mountains in Sullivan and Ulster counties in upstate New York which were frequented by [[Ashkenazic Jews]]. Changes in vacationing patterns have led most of those travelers elsewhere, although there are still bungalow communities in the towns of [[Liberty (town), New York|Liberty]], [[Bethel, New York|Bethel]], [[Thompson, New York|Thompson]] and [[Fallsburg, New York|Fallsburg]] catering to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] populations. The term, which derives from the name of a beet soup popular with people of Eastern European origin, can also refer to the Catskill region itself.\n\n===Woodstock rock festival===\n::''See [[Woodstock Festival]]''\n\nIn August, 1969, the Catskills were the site of a music and art festival in the town of [[Bethel, New York|Bethel]], which had originally been planned for [[Woodstock, New York]]. Thirty-three of the best-known musicians of the era appeared during a sometimes rainy weekend in front of nearly half a million concertgoers. The event, featuring liberal drug use and nudity, exemplified the [[counterculture]] of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.catskillarchive.com The Catskill Archive \u2013 history of the Catskill Mtns.]\n*[http://www.brown.edu/Research/Catskills_Institute/ The Catskills Institute \u2013 the Catskills in American Jewish Life]\n*[http://www.hopefarm.com/sullivny.htm Early Sullivan County History]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080828221155/http://catskill-3500-club.org/about-us.htm Catskill 3500 Club History]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Catskill Mountains}}\n[[Category:Catskills]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2012}}\n[[Image:Catskill Mountain House-Cropsey.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Mountain cabin\n'', 1836, by [[Jasper Francis Cropsey]]]]\n\n==Natural history==\n=== Early geologic history===\n\nThe [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]] began existence as a [[river delta]] 350 million years ago.

Back in London the [[Privy Council]] urged King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] to block it, and he duly ordered the new governor, [[William Tryon]], not to sign any grant for the land.\n\nBradstreet died in 1774, and his daughters were widely expected to take the fight to court, but very soon that took a backseat to other events.\n\n===The Revolutionary War===\n\nAs tensions increased between the colonies and Britain during the early 1770s over how to pay for the war, the Catskills saw this divide play out rather sharply. The large landowners like Livingston and the Hardenberghs, fearing Parliament would settle the matter with a land tax that would vastly cut into their wealth, increasingly took stands that would lead to independence. Their [[tenant farmers]], on the other hand, were, as Livingston put it, \"resolved to stand by their King,\" despite their landlords' efforts to drum up revolutionary sentiment among them, in the belief that if it came down to war, the Crown would confiscate the holdings of those who had opposed it and distribute smaller parcels back to those who had been loyal.\n\nThis came to a head in 1777, when Lieutenant Jacob Rose raised an army of several hundred of the region's young men to go fight alongside the British in return for 50 acres (0.2&nbsp;km\u00b2) each. Rose\u2019s Rangers, as they were called, had to make its way through the strongly Patriot Hudson Valley to rendezvous with British regulars in New York City, however, and was captured in the vicinity of [[Schunemunk Mountain]] in [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] after a skirmish with local [[militia]]. Prisoners were taken to [[Fort Montgomery (Hudson River)|Fort Montgomery]] and tried for treason against the recently established state of New York. Most were pardoned in exchange for committing to serve in the [[Continental Army]]; Rose and a few other holdouts were hanged.\n\nThe failure of Rose's mission and the burning of [[Kingston (city), New York|Kingston]] by British forces that year severely blunted Tory sentiment in the Catskills, and for the remainder of the war the region posed no threat to the Patriot cause.\n\n===Jewish resort destination===\n::''See [[Borscht Belt]]''\n\nThe Catskills became a major resort destination for Jewish New Yorkers in the mid-20th century. [[Borscht Belt]] is an informal term for the summer resorts of the Catskill Mountains in Sullivan and Ulster counties in upstate New York which were frequented by [[Ashkenazic Jews]]. Changes in vacationing patterns have led most of those travelers elsewhere, although there are still bungalow communities in the towns of [[Liberty (town), New York|Liberty]], [[Bethel, New York|Bethel]], [[Thompson, New York|Thompson]] and [[Fallsburg, New York|Fallsburg]] catering to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] populations. The term, which derives from the name of a beet soup popular with people of Eastern European origin, can also refer to the Catskill region itself.\n\n===Woodstock rock festival===\n::''See [[Woodstock Festival]]''\n\nIn August, 1969, the Catskills were the site of a music and art festival in the town of [[Bethel, New York|Bethel]], which had originally been planned for [[Woodstock, New York]]. Thirty-three of the best-known musicians of the era appeared during a sometimes rainy weekend in front of nearly half a million concertgoers. The event, featuring liberal drug use and nudity, exemplified the [[counterculture]] of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.catskillarchive.com The Catskill Archive \u2013 history of the Catskill Mtns.]\n*[http://www.brown.edu/Research/Catskills_Institute/ The Catskills Institute \u2013 the Catskills in American Jewish Life]\n*[http://www.hopefarm.com/sullivny.htm Early Sullivan County History]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080828221155/http://catskill-3500-club.org/about-us.htm Catskill 3500 Club History]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Catskill Mountains}}\n[[Category:Catskills]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Catskill_Mountains"}

From the Browns' first game on September 6, 1946 against the [[Miami Seahawks]].]]\n\nThe '''history of the Cleveland Browns''' [[American football]] team began in 1944  when taxi-cab magnate [[Arthur B. McBride|Arthur B. \"Mickey\" McBride]] secured a [[Cleveland, Ohio]] franchise in the newly formed [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC). [[Paul Brown]], who coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] once called the \"father of modern football\",{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=v}} was the team's namesake and first coach. From the beginning of play in 1946 at [[Cleveland Municipal Stadium]], the Browns were a great success. Cleveland won each of the AAFC's four championship games before the league dissolved in 1949. The team then moved to the more established [[National Football League]] (NFL), where it continued to dominate. Between 1950 and 1955, Cleveland reached the [[History of National Football League Championship|NFL championship game]] every year, winning three times.\n\nMcBride and his partners sold the team to a group of Cleveland businessmen in 1953 for a then-unheard-of $600,000. Eight years later, the team was sold again, this time to a group led by New York advertising executive [[Art Modell]]. Modell fired Brown before the 1963 season, but the team continued to win behind running back [[Jim Brown]]. The Browns won the [[1964 NFL Championship Game|championship]] in 1964 and reached the [[1965 NFL Championship Game|title game]] the following season, losing to the [[Green Bay Packers]]. The team subsequently reached the playoffs three times in the late 1980s, but fell short of playing in the [[Super Bowl]], the inter-league championship game between the NFL and the rival [[American Football League]] (AFL) that started in 1966.\n\nWhen the AFL and NFL [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merged]] before the 1970 season, Cleveland became part of the new [[American Football Conference]] (AFC). While the Browns made it back to the playoffs in 1971 and 1972, they fell into mediocrity through the mid-1970s. A revival of sorts took place in 1979 and 1980, when quarterback [[Brian Sipe]] engineered a series of last-minute wins and the Browns came to be called the \"[[Kardiac Kids]]\". Under Sipe, however, the Browns did not make it past the first round of the playoffs. Quarterback [[Bernie Kosar]], who the Browns drafted in 1985, led the team to three [[AFC Championship game]]s in the late 1980s but lost each time. In 1995, Modell announced he was relocating the Browns to [[Baltimore]], sowing a mix of outrage and bitterness among Cleveland's dedicated fan base. Negotiations and legal battles led to an agreement where Modell was allowed to move the team, but Cleveland kept the Browns' name, colors and history. After three years of suspension while the old municipal stadium was demolished and [[Cleveland Browns Stadium]] took its place, the Browns started play again in 1999 under new owner [[Al Lerner]]. Since resuming operations, the Browns have made the playoffs only once, as a [[Wild card (sports)#National Football League|wild-card team]] in 2002.\n\nThe Browns are only one of 12 NFL franchises to predate the 1960 launch of the [[American Football League]], and are only one of three such teams in the AFC.\n\n==Founding and dominance in the AAFC (1946\u20131949)==\n\n[[File:Paul Brown, American football head coach.png|thumb|right|alt=Cleveland Browns coach Paul Brown stands on the sideline.|Paul Brown, the Browns' namesake and first coach, liked his players \"lean and hungry.\"{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=45}}]]\n\nIn 1944 [[Arch Ward]], the influential sports editor of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', proposed a new professional football league called the All-America Football Conference.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=7}} The AAFC was to challenge the dominant National Football League once it began operations at the end of World War II, which had forced many professional teams to curtail activity, merge or go on hiatus as their players served in the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]].{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=8}} It was a bold proposition, given the failure of three previous NFL competitors and the dominance of college football, which was more popular than the professional game at the time.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=6\u20138}} Ward, who had gained fame and respect for starting all-star games for baseball and college football, lined up deep-pocketed owners for the new league's eight teams in hopes of giving it a better chance against the NFL.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=5\u20139}} One of them was Arthur B. \"Mickey\" McBride, a Cleveland businessman who grew up in Chicago and knew Ward from his involvement in the newspaper business.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=11\u201312}} McBride spent his early career as a circulation manager for the ''[[Cleveland News]]'', and went into business for himself in the 1930s, buying  a pair of Cleveland taxi companies and running a wire service that supplied [[Bookmaker|bookies]] with information about the results of horse races.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=11\u201312}} He had connections to [[organized crime in Chicago]] and Cleveland arising from the wire service.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Schwarz|2010|p=85}}\n\nMcBride developed a passion for football attending games at [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], where his son went to college.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=11}} In the early 1940s he tried to buy the NFL's [[Cleveland Rams]], owned by millionaire supermarket heir [[Dan Reeves (NFL owner)|Dan Reeves]], but was rebuffed.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=11}} Having been awarded the Cleveland franchise in the AAFC, McBride asked ''[[Cleveland Plain Dealer]]'' sportswriter John Dietrich for head coaching suggestions.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=12}} Dietrich recommended Paul Brown, the 36-year-old [[Ohio State Buckeyes]] coach.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=12}} After consulting with Ward, McBride followed Dietrich's advice in early 1945, naming Brown head coach and giving him an ownership stake in the team and full control over player personnel.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=11\u201312}} Brown, who had built an impressive record as coach of a [[Massillon Washington High School|Massillon, Ohio high school]] team and brought the Buckeyes their first national championship, at the time was serving in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and coached the football team at [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes Naval Station]] near [[Chicago]].{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=13\u201317}}\n\nThe name of the team was at first left up to Brown, who rejected calls for it to be christened the Browns.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=10}} McBride then held a contest to name the team in May 1945; \"Cleveland Panthers\" was the most popular choice, but Brown rejected it because it was the name of an [[Cleveland Panthers|earlier failed football team]]. \"That old Panthers team failed\", Brown said. \"I want no part of that name.\"{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=77}} In August, McBride gave in to popular demand and named the team the Browns, despite Paul Brown's objections.{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=76}}\n\nFor several years, Brown he would occasionally cite an alternate history of the team name. He claimed that the second name-the-team contest yielded the name \"Brown Bombers,\" after then-world heavyweight boxing champion [[Joe Louis]], whose nickname was \"The Brown Bomber.\" According to this version, Brown wanted his team to have a nickname befitting a champion, and felt the nickname \"Brown Bombers\" was apropos. The name was reportedly shortened to simply \"Browns.\" This alternate history of the name was even supported by the team as being factual as recently as the mid-1990s,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Name Game: Football, Baseball, Hockey & Basketball How Your Favorite Sports Teams Were Named |last=Donovan |first=Michael Leo |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=Warwick Publishing |location=[[Toronto]] |isbn=1-895629-74-8 |pages= }}</ref> and it continues as an [[urban legend]] to this day. However, Paul Brown never held fast to the Joe Louis story, and later in his life admitted that it was invented in part because of his wariness of having the team being named after him.

A conflict took shape between Paul Brown and Jim Brown; emboldened by his success, the fullback began to question his coach's disciplinarian methods. He called the coach \"Little Caesar\" behind his back. At halftime during a game in 1959, Paul Brown questioned the severity of an injury Jim Brown was sidelined for, which further inflamed tensions between the two.{{sfn|Dyer|2007|p=114}}\n\n===Art Modell takes ownership===\n\n[[Fred \"Curly\" Morrison]], a former Browns running back who worked as an advertising executive for [[CBS]] television, learned in 1960 that Dave Jones was looking to sell the Browns and told the story to [[Art Modell]], a 35-year-old advertising and television executive from [[Brooklyn]].{{sfn|Coughlin|2011|p=212\u2013213}} Modell was intrigued, partly because of the potentially lucrative television rights that one of the NFL's most successful franchises could bring as football began to challenge baseball as America's biggest sport.{{sfn|Coughlin|2011|pp=213\u2013214}} Having borrowed as much money as he could, Modell completed the purchase in March 1961 for $3.925 million. Bob Gries, who had a share in the Browns from the beginning, agreed to buy in again at the new valuation and take a stake of almost 40%, defraying Modell's costs substantially.{{sfn|Coughlin|2011|p=214}} As the previous owners did when they took over, Modell quickly assured Cleveland fans that Brown would \"have a free hand\" in running the organization and awarded him a new eight-year contract.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=37}} \"As far as I'm concerned Paul Brown can send [plays] in by carrier pigeon\", Modell said. \"In my opinion he has no peer as a football coach. His record speaks for itself. I view our relationship as a working partnership.\"{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=43}}\n\nThe 1961 season was typical on the field: Jim Brown led the league in rushing for the fifth straight season and the team ended with an 8\u20135\u20131 record. That left Cleveland two games out of a berth in the championship.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=50}} During that year, however, players began to question Paul Brown's strict and often overbearing demeanor, while many challenged his control over the team's strategy. Milt Plum spoke out against Brown calling all the team's offensive plays, and Jim Brown said on a weekly radio broadcast that the coach's play-calling and handling of Plum were undermining the quarterback's confidence.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=48}}{{sfn|Lebovitz|2006|p=15}} They found a willing listener in Modell, a bachelor who was closer to their age than the coach's.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=43, 47}}\n\nFurther cracks appeared in the \"working partnership\" between Paul Brown and Modell before the 1962 season. Brown made a trade without informing Modell, giving up star halfback [[Bobby Mitchell]] to acquire the rights to Syracuse running back [[Ernie Davis]], the first African-American to win the [[Heisman Trophy]].{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=50}} Davis was chosen by the [[Washington Redskins]] with the first overall pick in the 1962 draft, but while Davis was the first black player ever selected by Washington, team owner [[George Preston Marshall]] made the move only after being given an ultimatum to add an African-American player or risk losing his stadium lease. Davis demanded a trade, leaving the door open to the Browns, who signed him to a three-year contract worth $80,000.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=51}} As Davis was preparing for the [[College All-Star Game]], however, he came down with a mystery illness and was later diagnosed with [[leukemia]]. Brown ruled Davis out for the season, but the running back returned to Cleveland and began a conditioning program after one of his doctors said playing football would not exacerbate his condition.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=52}} Modell thought Davis could be prepared to play, and Davis, who by then knew he was dying, wanted to be part of the team. Brown, however, continued to insist that he sit out, driving a deeper wedge between him and Modell. Davis died the following May.{{sfn|Lebovitz|2006|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nThe rift between Brown and Modell only widened as the 1962 season progressed. [[Frank Ryan (American football)|Frank Ryan]] took Milt Plum's place as the team's starting quarterback by the end of the season, and the Browns finished with a 7\u20136\u20131 record. Jim Brown was not the NFL's leading rusher for the only time in his career.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=57}}\n\n===Paul Brown is fired===\n\nOn January 9, 1963, Art Modell sent a statement to the newswires: \"Paul E.

Opinions were mixed; Modell came in for his share of criticism, but tackle and team captain [[Mike McCormack (American football)|Mike McCormack]] said he did not think the team could win under Brown.{{sfn|Lebovitz|2006|p=13\u201314}} Nonetheless, it was a shocking end to the 17-year Cleveland career of a coach who was already a seminal figure in the city's sports history.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=62\u201363}} Among many innovations, Brown was the first coach to call plays for his quarterback, give players IQ and personality tests and use game film to evaluate opponents.{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=3}} Even Jim Brown lauded his pioneering role in integrating the game:\n\n<blockquote>Paul Brown integrated pro football without uttering a single word about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it.&nbsp;... [I]n his own way, the man integrated football the right way \u2013 and no one was going to stop him.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=49}}</blockquote>\n\nModell named Brown's chief assistant, [[Blanton Collier]], as the team's new head coach.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=64}} Collier was a friendly, studious man who became a player favorite as an assistant on both offense and defense under Brown.{{sfn|Groza|2003|p=52}} He installed an open offense and allowed Ryan to call his own plays.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=67}} In Collier's first season, the Browns finished with a 10\u20134 record but fell short of a division title.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=75, 77}} Jim Brown won the [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|MVP award]] in 1963 with a record 1,863&nbsp;yards rushing.

Most sportswriters predicted an easy win for the Colts, who led the league in scoring behind quarterback [[Johnny Unitas]] and halfback [[Lenny Moore]]. The Browns' defense, moreover, was suspect. The team gave up 20 more first downs than any other in the league.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=122\u2013124}} The teams, however, had not faced each other for three years. Before the game, Collier and Colts coach [[Don Shula]] agreed to give each other full access to video of regular-season games. Ever the student, Collier took full advantage of the opportunity. The Browns had run what was dubbed a \"rubber band\" pass defense, allowing short throws while trying to prevent big plays. The Colts' top receivers, however, [[Raymond Berry]] and [[Jimmy Orr]], were not fast. They tended to pick apart defenses with short, tactical completions, which led Collier to institute a man-to-man pass defense for the game. This, he figured, would buy more time for the defensive line and force Unitas to scramble \u2014 not his forte.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\nThe strategy paid off, and in the wind-whipped Cleveland Municipal Stadium two days after [[Christmas]], the Browns beat the Colts 27\u20130. Neither team scored in the first half, prompting ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist [[Red Smith (sportswriter)|Red Smith]] to quip, \"Never have so many paid so dearly \u2013 $10, $8, and $6 \u2013 and suffered so sorely to see so little.\"{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=148}} In the second half, the Browns' defense held on and the offense kicked into gear. Baltimore's cornerbacks were double-teaming Warfield, which Ryan exploited by throwing three touchdowns to his second wideout, [[Gary Collins (American football)|Gary Collins]]. The Browns scored 10 points in the third quarter and a further 17 in the fourth, clinching the first title since Otto Graham's departure after the 1955 season.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=150\u2013151}} Collins was named the game's MVP.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=158}}  This would be the last time that any professional sports team from Cleveland would win a league title until 2016, when the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] won the [[2016 NBA Finals]].\nTo date, this remains the last time that the Browns have won the NFL title.\n\nThe following year was a strong one as Jim Brown gritted out another league-leading rushing season.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=178}} The Browns ended with an 11\u20133 record and comfortably won the eastern division.<ref name=\"1965 statistics\">{{cite web|title=1965 Cleveland Browns Statistics & Players |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cle/1965.htm |publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68UXOrD2U?url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cle/1965.htm |archivedate=June 17, 2012 |accessdate=June 15, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> That set up a second straight appearance in the [[1965 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship game]] against the Packers on a slippery, mucky [[Lambeau Field]] on January 2, 1966.

Modell was in financial trouble. The origins of Modell's woes dated to 1973, when he worked out a deal to lease Cleveland Municipal Stadium from the city for a pittance: only enough to service the facility's debt and pay property taxes.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|p=137}} Cleveland Browns Stadium Corporation, or Stadium Corp., a company Modell and a business associate created and owned, held the 25-year lease. Stadium Corp. then subleased the stadium to the Browns and the [[Cleveland Indians]], and rented it out for concerts and other events.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|pp=137\u2013138}} While the deal worked fine for the city and Modell early on, the owner was later dogged by excessive borrowing and lawsuits.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|pp=137\u2013145}}\n\n[[File:1980-modell-browns crop.jpg|thumb|right|Cleveland owner Art Modell in 1983.

Modell originally paid $625,000 for the land, but sold it to his own Stadium Corp. for more than $3 million. Then, when the stadium was taking losses in 1981, he sold Stadium Corp. itself to the Browns for $6 million. This led to a fight the following year with Bob Gries, whose family had been part of the Browns' ownership group since its founding and had 43% of the team to Modell's 53%. Gries's complaint was that Modell treated the Browns and Stadium Corp. as his own fiefdom, rarely consulting him about the team's business. The sale of Stadium Corp. to the Browns, he argued, enriched Modell at the team's expense.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|pp=139\u2013140}} Gries's case went to the [[Supreme Court of Ohio|Ohio Supreme Court]], where he won. In 1986, Modell had to reverse the Browns' purchase of Stadium Corp. and pay $1 million in Gries's legal fees. This left Modell in need of financial help, and it came in the form of [[Al Lerner]], a banking and real estate executive who bought half of Stadium Corp. and 5% of the Browns in 1986.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|p=139}}\n\nHis reputation damaged by the lawsuits, Modell was eager to get out of Cleveland. He met with Baltimore officials about selling the Browns to Lerner and buying an expansion team to replace the Colts, who had left for Indianapolis in 1984. He also discussed moving the Browns.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|p=143}} Proposals were made to spend $175 million on a stadium renovation after the Indians and [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] got new facilities in downtown Cleveland, but it was not enough.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|pp=143\u2013145}} As the Browns started the 1995 season with a 4\u20134 record, word leaked that Modell was moving the team.<ref name=\"NYT on Browns move\">{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Timothy W.|title=Baltimore Browns May Be a Done Deal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/04/sports/football-baltimore-browns-may-be-a-done-deal.html?src=pm|accessdate=May 31, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 4, 1995}}</ref> Beset by rising player salaries and political indifference to the team's financial plight, he said he was forced to move.<ref name=\"SI on Browns move\">{{cite journal|last=Munson |first=Lester |title=A Busted Play |journal=Sports Illustrated |date=December 4, 1995 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1007507/index.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68UlqeldI?url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1007507/index.htm |archivedate=June 17, 2012 |accessdate=May 31, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The day after Modell formally announced the move, Cleveland voters overwhelmingly approved the $175 million of stadium renovations.

its successful early years. From the Browns' first game on September 6, 1946 against the [[Miami Seahawks]].]]\n\nThe '''history of the Cleveland Browns''' [[American football]] team began in 1944  when taxi-cab magnate [[Arthur B. McBride|Arthur B. \"Mickey\" McBride]] secured a [[Cleveland, Ohio]] franchise in the newly formed [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC). [[Paul Brown]], who coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] once called the \"father of modern football\",{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=v}} was the team's namesake and first coach. From the beginning of play in 1946 at [[Cleveland Municipal Stadium]], the Browns were a great success. Cleveland won each of the AAFC's four championship games before the league dissolved in 1949. The team then moved to the more established [[National Football League]] (NFL), where it continued to dominate. Between 1950 and 1955, Cleveland reached the [[History of National Football League Championship|NFL championship game]] every year, winning three times.\n\nMcBride and his partners sold the team to a group of Cleveland businessmen in 1953 for a then-unheard-of $600,000. Eight years later, the team was sold again, this time to a group led by New York advertising executive [[Art Modell]]. Modell fired Brown before the 1963 season, but the team continued to win behind running back [[Jim Brown]]. The Browns won the [[1964 NFL Championship Game|championship]] in 1964 and reached the [[1965 NFL Championship Game|title game]] the following season, losing to the [[Green Bay Packers]]. The team subsequently reached the playoffs three times in the late 1980s, but fell short of playing in the [[Super Bowl]], the inter-league championship game between the NFL and the rival [[American Football League]] (AFL) that started in 1966.\n\nWhen the AFL and NFL [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merged]] before the 1970 season, Cleveland became part of the new [[American Football Conference]] (AFC). While the Browns made it back to the playoffs in 1971 and 1972, they fell into mediocrity through the mid-1970s. A revival of sorts took place in 1979 and 1980, when quarterback [[Brian Sipe]] engineered a series of last-minute wins and the Browns came to be called the \"[[Kardiac Kids]]\". Under Sipe, however, the Browns did not make it past the first round of the playoffs. Quarterback [[Bernie Kosar]], who the Browns drafted in 1985, led the team to three [[AFC Championship game]]s in the late 1980s but lost each time. In 1995, Modell announced he was relocating the Browns to [[Baltimore]], sowing a mix of outrage and bitterness among Cleveland's dedicated fan base. Negotiations and legal battles led to an agreement where Modell was allowed to move the team, but Cleveland kept the Browns' name, colors and history. After three years of suspension while the old municipal stadium was demolished and [[Cleveland Browns Stadium]] took its place, the Browns started play again in 1999 under new owner [[Al Lerner]]. Since resuming operations, the Browns have made the playoffs only once, as a [[Wild card (sports)#National Football League|wild-card team]] in 2002.\n\nThe Browns are only one of 12 NFL franchises to predate the 1960 launch of the [[American Football League]], and are only one of three such teams in the AFC.\n\n==Founding and dominance in the AAFC (1946\u20131949)==\n\n[[File:Paul Brown, American football head coach.png|thumb|right|alt=Cleveland Browns coach Paul Brown stands on the sideline.|Paul Brown, the Browns' namesake and first coach, liked his players \"lean and hungry.\"{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=45}}]]\n\nIn 1944 [[Arch Ward]], the influential sports editor of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', proposed a new professional football league called the All-America Football Conference.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=7}} The AAFC was to challenge the dominant National Football League once it began operations at the end of World War II, which had forced many professional teams to curtail activity, merge or go on hiatus as their players served in the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]].{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=8}} It was a bold proposition, given the failure of three previous NFL competitors and the dominance of college football, which was more popular than the professional game at the time.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=6\u20138}} Ward, who had gained fame and respect for starting all-star games for baseball and college football, lined up deep-pocketed owners for the new league's eight teams in hopes of giving it a better chance against the NFL.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=5\u20139}} One of them was Arthur B. \"Mickey\" McBride, a Cleveland businessman who grew up in Chicago and knew Ward from his involvement in the newspaper business.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=11\u201312}} McBride spent his early career as a circulation manager for the ''[[Cleveland News]]'', and went into business for himself in the 1930s, buying  a pair of Cleveland taxi companies and running a wire service that supplied [[Bookmaker|bookies]] with information about the results of horse races.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=11\u201312}} He had connections to [[organized crime in Chicago]] and Cleveland arising from the wire service.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Schwarz|2010|p=85}}\n\nMcBride developed a passion for football attending games at [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], where his son went to college.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=11}} In the early 1940s he tried to buy the NFL's [[Cleveland Rams]], owned by millionaire supermarket heir [[Dan Reeves (NFL owner)|Dan Reeves]], but was rebuffed.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=11}} Having been awarded the Cleveland franchise in the AAFC, McBride asked ''[[Cleveland Plain Dealer]]'' sportswriter John Dietrich for head coaching suggestions.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=12}} Dietrich recommended Paul Brown, the 36-year-old [[Ohio State Buckeyes]] coach.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=12}} After consulting with Ward, McBride followed Dietrich's advice in early 1945, naming Brown head coach and giving him an ownership stake in the team and full control over player personnel.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=11\u201312}} Brown, who had built an impressive record as coach of a [[Massillon Washington High School|Massillon, Ohio high school]] team and brought the Buckeyes their first national championship, at the time was serving in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and coached the football team at [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes Naval Station]] near [[Chicago]].{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=13\u201317}}\n\nThe name of the team was at first left up to Brown, who rejected calls for it to be christened the Browns.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=10}} McBride then held a contest to name the team in May 1945; \"Cleveland Panthers\" was the most popular choice, but Brown rejected it because it was the name of an [[Cleveland Panthers|earlier failed football team]]. \"That old Panthers team failed\", Brown said. \"I want no part of that name.\"{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=77}} In August, McBride gave in to popular demand and named the team the Browns, despite Paul Brown's objections.{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=76}}\n\nFor several years, Brown he would occasionally cite an alternate history of the team name. He claimed that the second name-the-team contest yielded the name \"Brown Bombers,\" after then-world heavyweight boxing champion [[Joe Louis]], whose nickname was \"The Brown Bomber.\" According to this version, Brown wanted his team to have a nickname befitting a champion, and felt the nickname \"Brown Bombers\" was apropos. The name was reportedly shortened to simply \"Browns.\" This alternate history of the name was even supported by the team as being factual as recently as the mid-1990s,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Name Game: Football, Baseball, Hockey & Basketball How Your Favorite Sports Teams Were Named |last=Donovan |first=Michael Leo |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=Warwick Publishing |location=[[Toronto]] |isbn=1-895629-74-8 |pages= }}</ref> and it continues as an [[urban legend]] to this day. However, Paul Brown never held fast to the Joe Louis story, and later in his life admitted that it was invented in part because of his wariness of having the team being named after him.

A conflict took shape between Paul Brown and Jim Brown; emboldened by his success, the fullback began to question his coach's disciplinarian methods. He called the coach \"Little Caesar\" behind his back. At halftime during a game in 1959, Paul Brown questioned the severity of an injury Jim Brown was sidelined for, which further inflamed tensions between the two.{{sfn|Dyer|2007|p=114}}\n\n===Art Modell takes ownership===\n\n[[Fred \"Curly\" Morrison]], a former Browns running back who worked as an advertising executive for [[CBS]] television, learned in 1960 that Dave Jones was looking to sell the Browns and told the story to [[Art Modell]], a 35-year-old advertising and television executive from [[Brooklyn]].{{sfn|Coughlin|2011|p=212\u2013213}} Modell was intrigued, partly because of the potentially lucrative television rights that one of the NFL's most successful franchises could bring as football began to challenge baseball as America's biggest sport.{{sfn|Coughlin|2011|pp=213\u2013214}} Having borrowed as much money as he could, Modell completed the purchase in March 1961 for $3.925 million. Bob Gries, who had a share in the Browns from the beginning, agreed to buy in again at the new valuation and take a stake of almost 40%, defraying Modell's costs substantially.{{sfn|Coughlin|2011|p=214}} As the previous owners did when they took over, Modell quickly assured Cleveland fans that Brown would \"have a free hand\" in running the organization and awarded him a new eight-year contract.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=37}} \"As far as I'm concerned Paul Brown can send [plays] in by carrier pigeon\", Modell said. \"In my opinion he has no peer as a football coach. His record speaks for itself. I view our relationship as a working partnership.\"{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=43}}\n\nThe 1961 season was typical on the field: Jim Brown led the league in rushing for the fifth straight season and the team ended with an 8\u20135\u20131 record. That left Cleveland two games out of a berth in the championship.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=50}} During that year, however, players began to question Paul Brown's strict and often overbearing demeanor, while many challenged his control over the team's strategy. Milt Plum spoke out against Brown calling all the team's offensive plays, and Jim Brown said on a weekly radio broadcast that the coach's play-calling and handling of Plum were undermining the quarterback's confidence.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=48}}{{sfn|Lebovitz|2006|p=15}} They found a willing listener in Modell, a bachelor who was closer to their age than the coach's.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=43, 47}}\n\nFurther cracks appeared in the \"working partnership\" between Paul Brown and Modell before the 1962 season. Brown made a trade without informing Modell, giving up star halfback [[Bobby Mitchell]] to acquire the rights to Syracuse running back [[Ernie Davis]], the first African-American to win the [[Heisman Trophy]].{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=50}} Davis was chosen by the [[Washington Redskins]] with the first overall pick in the 1962 draft, but while Davis was the first black player ever selected by Washington, team owner [[George Preston Marshall]] made the move only after being given an ultimatum to add an African-American player or risk losing his stadium lease. Davis demanded a trade, leaving the door open to the Browns, who signed him to a three-year contract worth $80,000.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=51}} As Davis was preparing for the [[College All-Star Game]], however, he came down with a mystery illness and was later diagnosed with [[leukemia]]. Brown ruled Davis out for the season, but the running back returned to Cleveland and began a conditioning program after one of his doctors said playing football would not exacerbate his condition.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=52}} Modell thought Davis could be prepared to play, and Davis, who by then knew he was dying, wanted to be part of the team. Brown, however, continued to insist that he sit out, driving a deeper wedge between him and Modell. Davis died the following May.{{sfn|Lebovitz|2006|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nThe rift between Brown and Modell only widened as the 1962 season progressed. [[Frank Ryan (American football)|Frank Ryan]] took Milt Plum's place as the team's starting quarterback by the end of the season, and the Browns finished with a 7\u20136\u20131 record.

Opinions were mixed; Modell came in for his share of criticism, but tackle and team captain [[Mike McCormack (American football)|Mike McCormack]] said he did not think the team could win under Brown.{{sfn|Lebovitz|2006|p=13\u201314}} Nonetheless, it was a shocking end to the 17-year Cleveland career of a coach who was already a seminal figure in the city's sports history.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=62\u201363}} Among many innovations, Brown was the first coach to call plays for his quarterback, give players IQ and personality tests and use game film to evaluate opponents.{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=3}} Even Jim Brown lauded his pioneering role in integrating the game:\n\n<blockquote>Paul Brown integrated pro football without uttering a single word about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it.&nbsp;... [I]n his own way, the man integrated football the right way \u2013 and no one was going to stop him.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=49}}</blockquote>\n\nModell named Brown's chief assistant, [[Blanton Collier]], as the team's new head coach.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=64}} Collier was a friendly, studious man who became a player favorite as an assistant on both offense and defense under Brown.{{sfn|Groza|2003|p=52}} He installed an open offense and allowed Ryan to call his own plays.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=67}} In Collier's first season, the Browns finished with a 10\u20134 record but fell short of a division title.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=75, 77}} Jim Brown won the [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|MVP award]] in 1963 with a record 1,863&nbsp;yards rushing.

Most sportswriters predicted an easy win for the Colts, who led the league in scoring behind quarterback [[Johnny Unitas]] and halfback [[Lenny Moore]]. The Browns' defense, moreover, was suspect. The team gave up 20 more first downs than any other in the league.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=122\u2013124}} The teams, however, had not faced each other for three years. Before the game, Collier and Colts coach [[Don Shula]] agreed to give each other full access to video of regular-season games. Ever the student, Collier took full advantage of the opportunity. The Browns had run what was dubbed a \"rubber band\" pass defense, allowing short throws while trying to prevent big plays. The Colts' top receivers, however, [[Raymond Berry]] and [[Jimmy Orr]], were not fast. They tended to pick apart defenses with short, tactical completions, which led Collier to institute a man-to-man pass defense for the game. This, he figured, would buy more time for the defensive line and force Unitas to scramble \u2014 not his forte.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\nThe strategy paid off, and in the wind-whipped Cleveland Municipal Stadium two days after [[Christmas]], the Browns beat the Colts 27\u20130. Neither team scored in the first half, prompting ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist [[Red Smith (sportswriter)|Red Smith]] to quip, \"Never have so many paid so dearly \u2013 $10, $8, and $6 \u2013 and suffered so sorely to see so little.\"{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=148}} In the second half, the Browns' defense held on and the offense kicked into gear. Baltimore's cornerbacks were double-teaming Warfield, which Ryan exploited by throwing three touchdowns to his second wideout, [[Gary Collins (American football)|Gary Collins]]. The Browns scored 10 points in the third quarter and a further 17 in the fourth, clinching the first title since Otto Graham's departure after the 1955 season.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=150\u2013151}} Collins was named the game's MVP.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=158}}  This would be the last time that any professional sports team from Cleveland would win a league title until 2016, when the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] won the [[2016 NBA Finals]].\nTo date, this remains the last time that the Browns have won the NFL title.\n\nThe following year was a strong one as Jim Brown gritted out another league-leading rushing season.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=178}} The Browns ended with an 11\u20133 record and comfortably won the eastern division.<ref name=\"1965 statistics\">{{cite web|title=1965 Cleveland Browns Statistics & Players |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cle/1965.htm |publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68UXOrD2U?url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cle/1965.htm |archivedate=June 17, 2012 |accessdate=June 15, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> That set up a second straight appearance in the [[1965 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship game]] against the Packers on a slippery, mucky [[Lambeau Field]] on January 2, 1966.

Modell was in financial trouble. The origins of Modell's woes dated to 1973, when he worked out a deal to lease Cleveland Municipal Stadium from the city for a pittance: only enough to service the facility's debt and pay property taxes.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|p=137}} Cleveland Browns Stadium Corporation, or Stadium Corp., a company Modell and a business associate created and owned, held the 25-year lease. Stadium Corp. then subleased the stadium to the Browns and the [[Cleveland Indians]], and rented it out for concerts and other events.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|pp=137\u2013138}} While the deal worked fine for the city and Modell early on, the owner was later dogged by excessive borrowing and lawsuits.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|pp=137\u2013145}}\n\n[[File:1980-modell-browns crop.jpg|thumb|right|Cleveland owner Art Modell in 1983. Lawsuits by Browns minority owner Bob Gries and the Indians in the early 1980s exacerbated his financial problems.]]\n\nWhen the stadium was profitable, Modell had used Stadium Corp. to buy land in [[Strongsville, Ohio|Strongsville]] that he had previously acquired as the potential site for a future new stadium. Modell originally paid $625,000 for the land, but sold it to his own Stadium Corp. for more than $3 million. Then, when the stadium was taking losses in 1981, he sold Stadium Corp. itself to the Browns for $6 million. This led to a fight the following year with Bob Gries, whose family had been part of the Browns' ownership group since its founding and had 43% of the team to Modell's 53%. Gries's complaint was that Modell treated the Browns and Stadium Corp. as his own fiefdom, rarely consulting him about the team's business. The sale of Stadium Corp. to the Browns, he argued, enriched Modell at the team's expense.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|pp=139\u2013140}} Gries's case went to the [[Supreme Court of Ohio|Ohio Supreme Court]], where he won. In 1986, Modell had to reverse the Browns' purchase of Stadium Corp. and pay $1 million in Gries's legal fees. This left Modell in need of financial help, and it came in the form of [[Al Lerner]], a banking and real estate executive who bought half of Stadium Corp. and 5% of the Browns in 1986.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|p=139}}\n\nHis reputation damaged by the lawsuits, Modell was eager to get out of Cleveland. He met with Baltimore officials about selling the Browns to Lerner and buying an expansion team to replace the Colts, who had left for Indianapolis in 1984. He also discussed moving the Browns.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|p=143}} Proposals were made to spend $175 million on a stadium renovation after the Indians and [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] got new facilities in downtown Cleveland, but it was not enough.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|pp=143\u2013145}} As the Browns started the 1995 season with a 4\u20134 record, word leaked that Modell was moving the team.<ref name=\"NYT on Browns move\">{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Timothy W.|title=Baltimore Browns May Be a Done Deal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/04/sports/football-baltimore-browns-may-be-a-done-deal.html?src=pm|accessdate=May 31, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 4, 1995}}</ref> Beset by rising player salaries and political indifference to the team's financial plight, he said he was forced to move.<ref name=\"SI on Browns move\">{{cite journal|last=Munson |first=Lester |title=A Busted Play |journal=Sports Illustrated |date=December 4, 1995 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1007507/index.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68UlqeldI?url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1007507/index.htm |archivedate=June 17, 2012 |accessdate=May 31, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The day after Modell formally announced the move, Cleveland voters overwhelmingly approved the $175 million of stadium renovations.
