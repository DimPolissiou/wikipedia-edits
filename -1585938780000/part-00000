It was modified from the [[Penteconter (ship)|penteconter]], a ship that had only one set of oars on each side, the bireme having two sets of oars on each side. The bireme was twice the triaconter's length and height, and thus employed 120 rowers. Biremes were [[galley]]s, [[galleasses]], [[dromons]], and small pleasure crafts [[pamphyles]].\n\nThe next development, the [[trireme]], keeping the length of the bireme, added a tier to the height, the rowers being thus increased to 180.<ref>{{cite book |title= The five great monarchies of the ancient eastern world; or, the history, geography, and antiquities of Chaldaea, Assyria, Babylon, Media, and Persia, collected and illustrated from ancient and modern sources: In 4 Vols, Volume 4|last=Rawlinson|first= George|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1867|publisher= John Murray|location= |isbn= |page= |pages= 143|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HuUGAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA143&dq=bireme#v=onepage&q=bireme&f=false|accessdate=}}</ref> It also had a large square sail.\n\n==Uses==\nThese ships were frequently used by the Romans, as during the second of [[Caesar's invasions of Britain]]. The bireme eventually evolved into the [[trireme]]. A unit commandant (who was given a tent on the open deck) directed a group of marines. The bireme was also recorded in ancient history on the 8th and early 7th-century Assyrian reliefs, where they were used to carry out an amphibious attack on the coast of Elam and the lagoons of the Persian Gulf during the reign of [[Sennacherib]].<ref name=\"Casson 57\u201358\">{{cite book | last = [[Lionel Casson|Casson]]| first = Lionel | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World | publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press | date = December 1, 1995 | location = | pages = 57\u201358 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=https://books.google.com.mt/books?P_e68zoAhUKyKYKHT4ZBXIQ6AEIJzAAsDpMh0gK2OUC&pg=PA3&dq=+bireme+Assyrian+Casson#PPA57,M1 | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-8018-5130-8 }}</ref>\n\nMedieval galleys are also described as \"bireme\" or \"trireme\" depending on the number of their banks of oars. The terminology can lead to confusion, since the terms are also used for rowed warships of the Greco-Roman period built on entirely different design principles.\n\n==Dimensions and development==\nIn 1275, [[Charles I of Anjou|Charles of Anjou]], king of [[Sicily]], issued an order for the construction of several galleys that provide the earliest evidence for the dimensions of the bireme galleys. Because of increased weight and breadth, which brought increased friction through the water, a trireme galley was not dramatically faster than a bireme. But the change to trireme produced more significant developments than a gain in tactical speed over short distances. Early bireme galleys escorted merchant ships but were rarely used to carry goods. A few [[Genoa|Genoese]] freight contracts of the mid-13th century record charters for bireme galleys.<ref>{{cite book |title= Medieval Italy: an encyclopedia, Vol. 2|last= |first= |authorlink= |author1= Christopher Kleinhenz |author2=John W Barker|year= 2004|publisher= Routledge|location= London|isbn= |page= 1029|pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=spKxJeHJgTAC&pg=PA1029&dq=bireme#v=onepage&q=bireme&f=false|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Galley#Biremes and triremes|Galley: Biremes and triremes]]\n* [[Ivlia (ship)|Bireme \"Ivlia\"]]\n* [[Trireme]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Sailing Vessels and Rigs}}\n\n[[Category:Ships of ancient Greece]]\n[[Category:Navy of ancient Rome]]\n[[Category:Galleys]]\n[[Category:Naval warfare of antiquity]]\n", "text_old": "{{Rewrite|date=March 2019}}{{about|the ancient ship with two decks of oars|other similar ships|Galley|the institutional acronym|BIREME|the thoroughbred racehorse|Bireme (horse)}}\n\n[[File:Greek Bireme 500BC.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Greek bireme circa 500 BC, image from a Greek vase in the [[British Museum]], which was found at [[Vulci]] in [[Etruria]].]]\n[[Image:AssyrianWarship.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Assyria]]n warship, a bireme with pointed bow, 700 BC.]]\n\nA '''bireme''' is an ancient oared warship ([[galley]]) with two decks of [[oar]]s.

It was modified from the [[Penteconter (ship)|penteconter]], a ship that had only one set of oars on each side, the bireme having two sets of oars on each side. The bireme was twice the triaconter's length and height, and thus employed 120 rowers. Biremes were [[galley]]s, [[galleasses]], [[dromons]], and small pleasure crafts [[pamphyles]].\n\nThe next development, the [[trireme]], keeping the length of the bireme, added a tier to the height, the rowers being thus increased to 180.<ref>{{cite book |title= The five great monarchies of the ancient eastern world; or, the history, geography, and antiquities of Chaldaea, Assyria, Babylon, Media, and Persia, collected and illustrated from ancient and modern sources: In 4 Vols, Volume 4|last=Rawlinson|first= George|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1867|publisher= John Murray|location= |isbn= |page= |pages= 143|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HuUGAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA143&dq=bireme#v=onepage&q=bireme&f=false|accessdate=}}</ref> It also had a large square sail.\n\n==Uses==\nThese ships were frequently used by the Romans, as during the second of [[Caesar's invasions of Britain]]. The bireme eventually evolved into the [[trireme]]. A unit commandant (who was given a tent on the open deck) directed a group of marines. The bireme was recorded in ancient history on 8th-century Assyrian reliefs.<ref name=\"Casson 57\u201358\">{{cite book | last = [[Lionel Casson|Casson]]| first = Lionel | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World | publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press | date = December 1, 1995 | location = | pages = 57\u201358 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sDpMh0gK2OUC&pg=PA3&dq=+bireme+Assyrian+Casson#PPA57,M1 | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-8018-5130-8 }}</ref>\n\nMedieval galleys are also described as \"bireme\" or \"trireme\" depending on the number of their banks of oars. The terminology can lead to confusion, since the terms are also used for rowed warships of the Greco-Roman period built on entirely different design principles.\n\n==Dimensions and development==\nIn 1275, [[Charles I of Anjou|Charles of Anjou]], king of [[Sicily]], issued an order for the construction of several galleys that provide the earliest evidence for the dimensions of the bireme galleys. Because of increased weight and breadth, which brought increased friction through the water, a trireme galley was not dramatically faster than a bireme. But the change to trireme produced more significant developments than a gain in tactical speed over short distances. Early bireme galleys escorted merchant ships but were rarely used to carry goods. A few [[Genoa|Genoese]] freight contracts of the mid-13th century record charters for bireme galleys.<ref>{{cite book |title= Medieval Italy: an encyclopedia, Vol. 2|last= |first= |authorlink= |author1= Christopher Kleinhenz |author2=John W Barker|year= 2004|publisher= Routledge|location= London|isbn= |page= 1029|pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=spKxJeHJgTAC&pg=PA1029&dq=bireme#v=onepage&q=bireme&f=false|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Galley#Biremes and triremes|Galley: Biremes and triremes]]\n* [[Ivlia (ship)|Bireme \"Ivlia\"]]\n* [[Trireme]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Sailing Vessels and Rigs}}\n\n[[Category:Ships of ancient Greece]]\n[[Category:Navy of ancient Rome]]\n[[Category:Galleys]]\n[[Category:Naval warfare of antiquity]]\n", "name_user": "NotSparta9703", "label": "safe", "comment": "At \"Uses\", at the last paragraph, I have added text describing the use of the Assyrian navy, this time in the 7th century during the reign of Sennacherib.

Lionel receives a letter acknowledging the presence of a [[Bigfoot|Sasquatch]], making a deal with Piggot-Dunceby that would allow him to join the society if he proved that the creature was real.\n\nLionel travels to the Pacific Northwest, eventually stumbling upon the Sasquatch in a forest. After dubbing him \"Mr. Link,\" Lionel is told by the Sasquatch that he was, in fact, the one who sent the letter. Mr. Link requests Lionel's help in finding his relatives, the [[Yeti|Yetis]], in the Himalayas. Lionel agrees to help him but is unaware of the fact that Piggot-Dunceby has hired a bounty hunter named Willard Stenk to track Lionel and kill him, ensuring that the pro-imperialist conservative views of the society remain unchallenged.\n\nLionel's old lover Adelina Fortnight has a map to the Himalayas locked at her house in [[Santa Ana, California]], in a safe that belonged to her late husband, one of Lionel's past partners, so the two visit her mansion to acquire it. However, Adelina harbors resentment for Lionel missing her husband's funeral and kicks him out when he offers to pay her for the map. Lionel and Mr. Link come back later at night and break-in, but Mr. Link's noise-making awakens Adelina, and the safe eventually falls out of the top floor window, cracking open in the aftermath. Mr. Link and Lionel grab the map and escape but are discovered the next day by Adelina, who allows them to search for the Yetis as long as she is there to accompany them. Stenk arrives, and a shootout ensues, but the trio tricks their pursuer into hopping on the train to search for them.\n\nThe trio makes their journey via boat, and Adelina pressures Lionel into reaching out to Mr. Link to prove his sincerity. Lionel enjoys a heartwarming talk with Mr. Link on the boat's deck, where Mr. Link gives himself the name \"Susan\" after a friendly prospector he once encountered. However, they are once again ambushed by Stenk. After various scuffles across different parts of the ship, the trio eventually locks Stenk in the boat's boarding rooms while they make another escape.\n\nThe trio eventually makes their way to the Himalayas and is pointed in the direction of the Yeti temple, and led to their Queen, who reveals their secluded valley to the group. She then reveals their disdain for mankind extends to Susan, who's interacted closely with them. They throw the trio in a pit for them to stay until they die. Susan gives Adelina a boost, and she knocks down a few Yeti guards, allowing them to stack them and escape. They run across the ice bridge, where an armed Piggot-Dunceby and Stenk are waiting at the center of the bridge. Lionel denounces his rival's pride and defends Susan as more human than the society ever will be. As a result, the insane Piggot-Dunceby starts firing his rifle at the ice bridge to kill the trio, until Susan stops Piggot-Dunceby from getting any further, still causing it to crack and break. Piggot-Dunceby and his assistant Mr. Collick fall to their deaths while the trio and Stenk make a run for it. They are too late and are left hanging on the edge of the destroyed ice bridge. Stenk, who has made it all the way across, taunts Lionel, which leads to the two engaging in a slapping fight while hanging on the bridge. The trio works together to rid themselves of Stenk, who falls to his death after an icicle breaks and falls on him. Lionel appoints Susan as his new partner in investigations, who blows a raspberry at the Yeti leader.\n\nAfter arriving home, Adelina tells Lionel that she will be adventuring on her own for a while and departs, but not before the pair share a brief mutual acceptance of their feelings for each other. Susan and Lionel arrive back at the latter's work-space and begin their next case to find [[Atlantis]]. After they leave, the end credits reveal maps and souvenirs of their subsequent adventures.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Zach Galifianakis]] as Mr. Susan Link, a self-conscious, gentle [[Bigfoot]] searching for his relatives.\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Sir]] Lionel Frost, an ambitious and rash but well-meaning myths and monsters investigator.\n* [[Zoe Saldana]] as Adelina Fortnight, a fiercely independent, plucky and conscientious adventurer, and Sir Lionel's former girlfriend.\n* [[Stephen Fry]] as Lord Piggot-Dunceby, the arrogant, snobbish, prideful, insane head of the \"Society of Great Men\", and Sir Lionel's rival.\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as Willard Stenk, a bloodthirsty bounty hunter hired by Lord Piggot-Dunceby to stop Link/Susan and Sir Lionel's quest.\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as the Yeti Elder, the paranoid, secretive leader of the Yetis.\n* [[Amrita Acharia]] as Ama Lahuma, a mountain guide who Link/Susan, Sir Lionel and Adelina meet and leads them to the Yeti temple.\n* [[Matt Lucas]] as Mr. Collick, Lord Piggot-Dunceby's neurotic right-hand man.\n* Ching Valdez-Aran as Gamu, Ama's grandmother and a Yak Herder.\n* [[David Walliams]] as Mr. Lemuel Lint, Sir Lionel's former assistant.\n* [[Humphrey Ker]] as Doorman, General Pugh\n* [[Adam Godley]] as Lord Bilge\n* [[Neil Dickson]] as Mr. Roylott\n* Ian Ruskin as Lord Scrivener\n* Matthew Wolf as Lord Ramsbottom\n* Darren Richardson as Alfie\n* Alan Shearman as Lord Entwhistle\n* [[Jack Blessing]] as McVitie the Conductor.\n**This film is Blessing's final film role, his voice role having been recorded before his death in 2017.\n* Richard Miro as Ricardo\n}}\n\nOld Worlders voiced by [[Leila Birch]], [[Jean Gilpin]], Peter Lavin, [[Jimmy Hibbert]], [[David Holt (voice actor)|David Holt]], [[Christopher Neame]], [[Moira Quirk]], Maebel Rayner, Alexander Rodriguez, [[Julian Stone]], and Nick Toren.\n\nNew Worlders voiced by [[Kirk Baily]], David Beron, William Calvert, David Cowgill, Kerry Gutierrez, [[Bridget Hoffman]], [[Scott Menville]], Erin Myles, Juan Pacheco, [[Paul Pape]], [[Andr\u00e9 Sogliuzzo]], and [[Scott Whyte]].\n\nHimalayan villagers voiced by Phal Tong Lama, Yangchen Dolkar Gakyil, and Tharlam Dolma Wolfe.\n\n==Production==\nOn April 25, 2018, it was announced that [[Laika (company)|Laika]] had begun development on \"Film Five,\" a new animated film written and directed by [[Chris Butler (filmmaker)|Chris Butler]] and starring [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Zoe Saldana]], and [[Zach Galifianakis]].

Lionel receives a letter acknowledging the presence of a [[Bigfoot|Sasquatch]], making a deal with Piggot-Dunceby that would allow him to join the society if he proved that the creature was real.\n\nLionel travels to the Pacific Northwest, eventually stumbling upon the Sasquatch in a forest. After dubbing him \"Mr. Link,\" Lionel is told by the Sasquatch that he was, in fact, the one who sent the letter. Mr. Link requests Lionel's help in finding his relatives, the [[Yeti|Yetis]], in the Himalayas. Lionel agrees to help him but is unaware of the fact that Piggot-Dunceby has hired a bounty hunter named Willard Stenk to track Lionel and kill him, ensuring that the pro-imperialist conservative views of the society remain unchallenged.\n\nLionel's old lover Adelina Fortnight has a map to the Himalayas locked at her house in [[Santa Ana, California]], in a safe that belonged to her late husband, one of Lionel's past partners, so the two visit her mansion to acquire it. However, Adelina harbors resentment for Lionel missing her husband's funeral and kicks him out when he offers to pay her for the map. Lionel and Mr. Link come back later at night and break-in, but Mr. Link's noise-making awakens Adelina, and the safe eventually falls out of the top floor window, cracking open in the aftermath. Mr. Link and Lionel grab the map and escape but are discovered the next day by Adelina, who allows them to search for the Yetis as long as she is there to accompany them. Stenk arrives, and a shootout ensues, but the trio tricks their pursuer into hopping on the train to search for them.\n\nThe trio makes their journey via boat, and Adelina pressures Lionel into reaching out to Mr. Link to prove his sincerity. Lionel enjoys a heartwarming talk with Mr. Link on the boat's deck, where Mr. Link gives himself the name \"Susan\" after a friendly prospector he once encountered. However, they are once again ambushed by Stenk. After various scuffles across different parts of the ship, the trio eventually locks Stenk in the boat's boarding rooms while they make another escape.\n\nThe trio eventually makes their way to the Himalayas and is pointed in the direction of the Yeti temple, and led to their Queen, who reveals their secluded valley to the group. She then reveals their disdain for mankind extends to Susan, who's interacted closely with them. They throw the trio in a pit for them to stay until they die. Susan gives Adelina a boost, and she knocks down a few Yeti guards, allowing them to stack them and escape. They run across the ice bridge, where an armed Piggot-Dunceby and Stenk are waiting at the center of the bridge. Lionel denounces his rival's pride and defends Susan as more human than the society ever will be. As a result, the insane Piggot-Dunceby starts firing his rifle at the ice bridge to kill the trio, until Susan stops Piggot-Dunceby from getting any further, still causing it to crack and break. Piggot-Dunceby and his assistant Mr. Collick fall to their deaths while the trio and Stenk make a run for it. They are too late and are left hanging on the edge of the destroyed ice bridge. Stenk, who has made it all the way across, taunts Lionel, which leads to the two engaging in a slapping fight while hanging on the bridge. The trio works together to rid themselves of Stenk, who falls to his death after an icicle breaks and falls on him. Lionel appoints Susan as his new partner in investigations, who blows a raspberry at the Yeti leader.\n\nAfter arriving home, Adelina tells Lionel that she will be adventuring on her own for a while and departs, but not before the pair share a brief mutual acceptance of their feelings for each other. Susan and Lionel arrive back at the latter's work-space and begin their next case to find [[Atlantis]]. After they leave, the end credits reveal maps and souvenirs of their subsequent adventures.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Zach Galifianakis]] as Mr. Susan Link, a self-conscious, gentle [[Bigfoot]] searching for his relatives.\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Sir]] Lionel Frost, an ambitious and rash but well-meaning myths and monsters investigator.\n* [[Zoe Saldana]] as Adelina Fortnight, a fiercely independent, plucky and conscientious adventurer, and Sir Lionel's former girlfriend.\n* [[Stephen Fry]] as Lord Piggot-Dunceby, the arrogant, snobbish, prideful, insane head of the \"Society of Great Men\", and Sir Lionel's rival.\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as Willard Stenk, a bloodthirsty bounty hunter hired by Lord Piggot-Dunceby to stop Link/Susan and Sir Lionel's quest.\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as the Yeti Elder, the paranoid, secretive leader of the Yetis.\n* [[Amrita Acharia]] as Ama Lahuma, a mountain guide who Link/Susan, Sir Lionel and Adelina meet and leads them to the Yeti temple.\n* [[Matt Lucas]] as Mr. Collick, Lord Piggot-Dunceby's neurotic right-hand man.\n* Ching Valdez-Aran as Gamu, Ama's grandmother and a Yak Herder.\n* [[David Walliams]] as Mr. Lemuel Lint, Sir Lionel's former assistant.\n* [[Humphrey Ker]] as Doorman, General Pugh\n* [[Adam Godley]] as Lord Bilge\n* [[Neil Dickson]] as Mr. Roylott\n* Ian Ruskin as Lord Scrivener\n* Matthew Wolf as Lord Ramsbottom\n* Darren Richardson as Alfie\n* Alan Shearman as Lord Entwhistle\n* [[Jack Blessing]] as McVitie the Conductor.\n**This film is Blessing's final film role, his voice role having been recorded before his death in 2017.\n* Richard Miro as Ricardo\n}}\n\nOld Worlders voiced by [[Leila Birch]], [[Jean Gilpin]], Peter Lavin, [[Jimmy Hibbert]], [[David Holt (voice actor)|David Holt]], [[Christopher Neame]], [[Moira Quirk]], Maebel Rayner, Alexander Rodriguez, [[Julian Stone]], and Nick Toren.\n\nNew Worlders voiced by [[Kirk Baily]], David Beron, William Calvert, David Cowgill, Kerry Gutierrez, [[Bridget Hoffman]], [[Scott Menville]], Erin Myles, Juan Pacheco, [[Paul Pape]], [[Andr\u00e9 Sogliuzzo]], and [[Scott Whyte]].\n\nHimalayan villagers voiced by Phal Tong Lama, Yangchen Dolkar Gakyil, and Tharlam Dolma Wolfe.\n\n==Production==\nOn April 25, 2018, it was announced that [[Laika (company)|Laika]] had begun development on \"Film Five,\" a new animated film written and directed by [[Chris Butler (filmmaker)|Chris Butler]] and starring [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Zoe Saldana]], and [[Zach Galifianakis]].
