When ''Five Finger Exercise'' moved to [[New York City]] in 1959, it was equally well received and landed Shaffer the [[New York Drama Critics' Circle]] Award for Best Foreign Play.\n\nShaffer's next piece was a double bill, ''The Private Ear/The Public Eye'', two plays each containing three characters and concerning aspects of love. They were presented in May 1962 at the [[Gielgud Theatre|Globe Theatre]], and both starred [[Maggie Smith]] and [[Kenneth Williams]]. Smith won the Evening Standard Theatre Award for Best Leading Actress at the age of 27.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] was established in 1963, and virtually all of Shaffer's subsequent work was done in its service.

A journey into the mind of a seventeen-year-old stable-boy who had plunged a spike into the eyes of six horses, ''Equus'' ran for over 1,000 performances on Broadway. It was revived by [[Massachusetts]]' [[Berkshire Theatre Festival]] in the summers of 2005 and 2007, by director [[Thea Sharrock]] at London's [[Gielgud Theatre]] in February 2007, and on Broadway (in the Sharrock staging) in September 2008.

This tells the story of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and court composer [[Antonio Salieri]] who, overcome with jealousy at hearing the \"voice of God\" coming from an \"obscene child\", sets out to destroy his rival. When the show moved to Broadway it won the 1981 Tony Award for Best Play and, like ''Equus'', ran for more than a thousand performances.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nAfter the success of ''Amadeus'', Shaffer wrote the play ''[[Lettice and Lovage]]'' specifically for [[Dame Maggie Smith]] in 1986, for which he was nominated for another Tony Award and [[Dame Maggie Smith]] eventually won the Tony Award for best actress after three nominations in 1990. ''Lettice and Lovage'' also enabled [[Margaret Tyzack]] to win the award for best featured actress, and the production was nominated for best direction of a play, at the 1990 Tony Awards.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n==Screen adaptations==\nSeveral of Shaffer's plays have been adapted to film, including ''[[Five Finger Exercise (film)|Five Finger Exercise]]'' (1962), ''[[The Royal Hunt of the Sun (film)|The Royal Hunt of the Sun]]'' (1969), ''The Public Eye'' (1962), from which he adapted the 1972 film ''[[Follow Me!

Neighbouring peaks are the [[Hoher G\u00f6ll]] in the southeast and Mt. [[Watzmann]] in the south, beyond the Berchtesgaden Basin. In the northwest, the [[Saalach]] Valley with [[Bad Reichenhall]] separates it from the [[Hochstaufen]] massif of the [[Chiemgau Alps]]. About two-thirds of the area, including the Berchtesgaden Hochthron peak, is located in Germany, while the northernmost steep edge above Salzburg belongs to Austria.\n\nThe mountain is a landmark popular with tourists, due to its proximity to the City of Salzburg: less than {{convert|16|km|mi}} south of the city centre and within easy reach, e.g. by bus lines running to the southern suburbs of [[Gr\u00f6dig]] and [[Gro\u00dfgmain]]. \n\nSeveral trails lead to the top, though most people prefer the ''Untersbergbahn'' [[Aerial tramway|cable car]]. Constructed over a period of over two years, and opening in April 1961, the eight and a half minute journey lifts passengers from the lower terminus at the village of Sankt Leonhard at {{convert|456|m|ft|abbr=on}} over {{convert|1320|m|ft|abbr=on}} to the top station on the Geiereck spur at an altitude of {{convert|1776|m|ft|abbr=on}}, transporting them a horizontal distance of almost {{convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} with a maximum height above the ground of {{convert|286|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe first recorded ascent was in the first half of the 12th century, by Eberwein, a member of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monastery at Berchtesgaden. \n\n=== Peaks ===\n[[File:Blick \u00fcber die Untersbergostflanke.jpg|thumb|Eastern slope of the Berchtesgaden Hochthron]]\n* Berchtesgaden Hochthron: {{convert|1973|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n* Rauheck: {{convert|1892|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n* Gamsalpkopf: {{convert|1888|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n* Salzburg Hochthron: {{convert|1853|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n* Mitterberg: {{convert|1840|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n* Geiereck: {{convert|1806|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n\n==Geology==\nThe Untersberg massif is mainly made up of [[limestone]].

Once popular children's toys, these marbles were shipped all over the world. Through Rotterdam and London, marble shipping was directed toward the East and West Indies and exported at the rate of 60,000 to 80,000 (and sometimes as high as 100,000) pounds per year. Marbles were welcome as cargo in sailing ships, as they were suitable as ballast because of their high density. The last marbles went from Untersberg to London in 1921.\n\nAs late as the 1850s, the Almbach valley had 40 ball mills with another 90 in the surrounding region, worked mainly by poor mountain farmers. Today, a single ball mill operates primarily as a tourist attraction.\n\nThe ball mills were driven by the waters of the [[Almbach (Salzach)|Almbach]] river. The lower fixed grinding stones are made of hard sandstone and the upper turntables from beech wood. Grinding of the balls varies from two to eight days according to their size. After course grinding on the sandstone, the marble balls underwent sanding and a polish.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Untersberg Salzburg Austria.jpg|Untersberg\nImage:Untersberg 030704.jpg|View across the \"Mittagsscharte\", in the background on the left the \"Salzburger Hochthron\"\nImage:Untersberg Geiereck.jpg|Geiereck, a peak of the Untersberg\nImage: Salzburg (8).JPG|Untersberg cable car station\nImage: Untersberg (5).JPG|Cable car to Untersberg mountain.\nImage: Untersberg (19).JPG|View of the Salzburg basin from the Untersberg mountain top.

Once popular children's toys, these marbles were shipped all over the world. Through Rotterdam and London, marble shipping was directed toward the East and West Indies and exported at the rate of 60,000 to 80,000 (and sometimes as high as 100,000) pounds per year. Marbles were welcome as cargo in sailing ships, as they were suitable as ballast because of their high density. The last marbles went from Untersberg to London in 1921.\n\nAs late as the 1850s, the Almbach valley had 40 ball mills with another 90 in the surrounding region, worked mainly by poor mountain farmers. Today, a single ball mill operates primarily as a tourist attraction.\n\nThe ball mills were driven by the waters of the [[Almbach (Salzach)|Almbach]] river. The lower fixed grinding stones are made of hard sandstone and the upper turntables from beech wood. Grinding of the balls varies from two to eight days according to their size. After course grinding on the sandstone, the marble balls underwent sanding and a polish.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Untersberg Salzburg Austria.jpg|Untersberg\nImage:Untersberg 030704.jpg|View across the \"Mittagsscharte\", in the background on the left the \"Salzburger Hochthron\"\nImage:Untersberg Geiereck.jpg|Geiereck, a peak of the Untersberg\nImage: Salzburg (8).JPG|Untersberg cable car station\nImage: Untersberg (5).JPG|Cable car to Untersberg mountain.\nImage: Untersberg (19).JPG|View of the Salzburg basin from the Untersberg mountain top.

Fish argued that independence could \"shake up British politics\" to ensure a more \"fair distribution of wealth\" throughout the UK. However, he declined to actively campaign in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]] because he believed it would be \"hypocritical\" as he was planning to leave Scotland for Germany to live

He was accompanied on stage by his four former Marillion bandmates from the classic line-up ([[Mark Kelly (keyboardist)|Mark Kelly]], [[Steve Rothery]], [[Ian Mosley]] and [[Pete Trewavas]]) for one song: '[[Market Square Heroes]]'.

His distinctive clipped gravelly speech, [[Lower East Side]] Manhattan accent, comic language-butchery, jazz-influenced songs, and prominent nose helped make him one of America's most familiar and popular personalities of the 1920s through the 1970s. He often referred to his nose as ''the schnozzola'' ([[Italian language|Italianization]] of the American [[Yiddish]] slang word ''schnoz'' \"big nose\"), and the word became his nickname.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\nDurante was born on the [[Lower East Side]] of New York City. He was the youngest of four children born to Rosa (Lentino) and Bartolomeo Durante, both of whom were immigrants from [[Salerno]], [[Italy]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rRVRi3_gxfwC&pg=PA7&dq=%22Chapter+2+Beginnings+And+Family+Roots+Durante+grew+%22|title=Jimmy Durante: His Show Business Career, with an Annotated Filmography and Discography|first=David|last=Bakish|date=March 7, 2007|publisher=McFarland|via=Google Books|isbn=9780786430222}}</ref> Bartolomeo was a barber.<ref>Fowler, Gene Jr. ''Schnozzola: The Story of Jimmy Durante'' Viking Press, 1951</ref><ref>Bakish, David ''Jimmy Durante: His Show Business Career, with an Annotated Filmography and Discography'' McFarland & Co., 1994 {{ISBN|978-0-89950-968-6}}</ref> Young Jimmy served as an [[Altar server#Altar servers in the Catholic Church|altar boy]] at [[St. Malachy Roman Catholic Church]], known as the Actor's Chapel.<ref>{{cite web|author=Vincenzo |url=http://www.sanctepater.com/2009/10/actors-chapel.html |title=The Actors' Chapel &#124; Sancte Pater |publisher=Sanctepater.blogspot.com |date=October 24, 2009 |access-date=May 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Early career===\nDurante dropped out of school in seventh grade to become a full-time [[ragtime]] pianist. He first played with his cousin, whose name was also Jimmy Durante. It was a family act, but he was too professional for his cousin. He continued working the city's [[piano bar]] circuit and earned the nickname \"ragtime Jimmy\", before he joined one of the first recognizable jazz bands in New York, the [[Original New Orleans Jazz Band]]. Durante was the only member not from [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. His routine of breaking into a song to deliver a joke, with band or orchestra chord punctuation after each line, became a Durante trademark. In 1920 the group was renamed Jimmy Durante's Jazz Band.\n\n==Stardom==\nBy the mid-1920s, Durante had become a [[vaudeville]] star and radio personality in a trio called Clayton, Jackson and Durante. [[Lou Clayton]] and [[Eddie Jackson (vaudeville)|Eddie Jackson]], Durante's closest friends, often reunited with Durante in subsequent years. Jackson and Durante appeared in the [[Cole Porter]] musical ''[[The New Yorkers]]'', which opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on December 8, 1930. Earlier that same year, the team appeared in the movie ''[[Roadhouse Nights]]'', ostensibly based on [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s novel ''[[Red Harvest]]''.\n\nBy 1934, Durante had a major record hit with his own novelty composition, \"[[Inka Dinka Doo]]\", with lyrics by [[Ben Ryan (composer)|Ben Ryan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/search/track/Inka+Dinka+Doo/order:default-asc |title=Track Search: Inka Dinka Doo |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=May 10, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808151814/http://www.allmusic.com/search/track/Inka+Dinka+Doo/order:default-asc |archivedate=August 8, 2011 }}</ref> It became his theme song for the rest of his life. A year later, Durante starred on Broadway in the [[Billy Rose]] stage musical ''[[Jumbo (musical)|Jumbo]]''.  A scene in which a police officer stopped Durante's character\u2014who was leading a live elephant across the stage\u2014to ask, \"what are you doing with that elephant?\", followed by Durante's reply, \"what elfin!?\", was a regular show-stopper. This comedy bit, also reprised in his role in ''[[Billy Rose's Jumbo (film)|Billy Rose's Jumbo]]'', likely contributed to the popularity of the idiom ''[[Elephant in the room#Origins|the elephant in the room]]''. Durante also appeared on Broadway in ''[[Show Girl (1929 musical)|Show Girl]]'' (1929), ''Strike Me Pink'' (1934) and ''[[Red, Hot and Blue]]'' (1936).\n[[File:Speak Easily (1932) 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buster Keaton]], [[Thelma Todd]] and Jimmy Durante in ''[[Speak Easily]]'' (1932)]]\nDuring the early 1930s, Durante alternated between Hollywood and Broadway. His early motion pictures included an original [[Rodgers & Hart]] musical ''[[The Phantom President]]'' (1932), which featured Durante singing the self-referential ''Schnozzola''.  He was initially paired with [[silent film]] legend [[Buster Keaton]] in a series of three popular comedies for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], ''[[Speak Easily]]'' (1932), ''[[The Passionate Plumber]]'' (1932), and ''[[What! No Beer?]]'' (1933), which were financial hits and a career springboard for the distinctive newcomer.  However, Keaton's vociferous dissatisfaction with constraints the studio had placed upon him, his perceived incompatibility with Durante's broad chatty humor, exacerbated by Keaton's alcoholism, led the studio to end the series. Durante went on to appear in ''[[The Wet Parade]]'' (1932), ''[[Broadway to Hollywood (1933 film)|Broadway to Hollywood]]'' (1933), ''[[The Man Who Came to Dinner (1942 film)|The Man Who Came to Dinner]]'' (1942, playing ''Banjo'', a character based on [[Harpo Marx]]), ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' (1946), ''[[Billy Rose's Jumbo (film)|Billy Rose's Jumbo]]'' (1962, based on the 1935 musical), and ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963). In 1934, he starred in ''[[Hollywood Party (1934 film)|Hollywood Party]]'', where he dreams he is 'Schnarzan', a parody of '[[Tarzan]]' who was popular at the time due to the [[Johnny Weissmuller]] films.\n\n==Radio==\n[[File:Jimmy durante 1935.JPG|thumb|upright|Durante on ''The Jumbo Fire Chief Program'', 1935]]\nOn September 10, 1933, Durante appeared on [[Eddie Cantor]]'s NBC radio show, ''[[The Chase and Sanborn Hour]]'', continuing until November 12 of that year. When Cantor left the show, Durante took over as its star from April 22 to September 30, 1934. He then moved on to ''[[The Jumbo Fire Chief Program]]'' (1935\u201336).\n\nDurante teamed with [[Garry Moore]] for ''[[The Durante-Moore Show]]'' in 1943. Durante's comic chemistry with the young, brushcut Moore brought Durante an even larger audience. \"Dat's my boy dat said dat!\" became an instant [[catchphrase]], which would later inspire the cartoon ''[[Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy]]''. The duo was one of the nation's favorites for the rest of the decade. Their [[Armed Forces Radio Network]] ''[[Command Performance (radio series)|Command Performance]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otr.net/?p=cmdp|title=Command Performance at OTR.Network (Old Time Radio)|website=www.otr.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otr.net/r/cmdp/107.ram|title=''Command Performance'' 1947-02-30, Carole Landis, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Durante (Real Audio)}}</ref> with [[Frank Sinatra]] remains a favorite of radio-show collectors today. Moore left the duo in mid-1947, and the program returned October 1, 1947 as ''[[The Jimmy Durante Show (radio program)|The Jimmy Durante Show]]''. Durante continued the show for three more years and featured a reunion of Clayton, Jackson and Durante on his April 21, 1948 broadcast.\n\n==Television==\nAlthough Durante made his television debut on November 1, 1950 (on the ''[[Four Star Revue]]'' - see below) he continued to keep a presence in radio, as a frequent guest on [[Tallulah Bankhead]]'s two-year [[NBC]] comedy-variety show ''[[The Big Show (NBC Radio)|The Big Show]]''. Durante was one of the cast on the show's premiere November 5, 1950, along with humorist [[Fred Allen]], singers Mindy Carson and [[Frankie Laine]], stage musical performer [[Ethel Merman]], actors [[Jose Ferrer]] and [[Paul Lukas]], and comic-singer [[Danny Thomas]] (about to become a major television star in his own right). A highlight of the premiere was Durante and Thomas, whose own nose rivaled Durante's, in a routine in which Durante accused Thomas of stealing his nose. \"Stay outta dis, no-nose!\" Durante barked at Bankhead to a big laugh.\n[[File:jimmy Durante in Broadway to Hollywood trailer.jpg|thumb|right|from the ''[[Broadway to Hollywood (1933 film)|Broadway to Hollywood]]'' trailer (1933)]]\n[[File:Pearl Bailey Jimmy Durante Pearl Bailey Show 1971.JPG|thumb|right|With the hostess on ''[[Pearl Bailey|The Pearl Bailey Show]]''  (1971) ]]\n\nFrom 1950 to 1951, Durante was the host once a month (alternating with Ed Wynn, Danny Thomas and Jack Carson) on Wednesday evenings at 8 p.m, on NBC's comedy-variety series ''[[Four Star Revue]]''. Jimmy continued with the show until 1954. \n\nDurante then had a half-hour variety show - ''[[The Jimmy Durante Show]]'' - on [[NBC]] from October 2, 1954, to June 23, 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046613/ |title=''The Jimmy Durante Show''|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=November 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, Durante teamed with sidekick [[Sonny King (singer)|Sonny King]], a collaboration that would continue until Durante's death.  He was often seen regularly in Las Vegas after Sunday Mass outside of the Guardian Angel Cathedral standing next to the priest and greeting the people as they left Mass.\n\nSeveral times in the 1960s, Durante served as host of ABC's [[Hollywood Palace]] variety show, which were taped live (and consequently include ad-libs by the seasoned vaudevillian).\n\nHis last regular television appearance was co-starring with the [[Lennon Sisters]] on \"[[Jimmy Durante Presents the Lennon Sisters]] Hour\" which lasted for one season on ABC (1969\u20131970).\n\n==Marriages==\nDurante's first wife was Jean \"Jeanne\" Olson, whom he married on June 19, 1921. She was born in Ohio on August 31, 1896. She was 46 years old when she died on [[Valentine's Day]] in 1943, after a lingering heart ailment of about two years, although different newspaper accounts of her death suggest she was 45 or perhaps 52.<ref>See California Death Records - Jeanne Durante</ref> As her death was not immediately expected, Durante was touring in New York at the time and returned to Los Angeles right away to complete the funeral arrangements.\n\n{{anchor|Mrs. Calabash}}\nDurante's radio show was bracketed with two trademarks: \"Inka Dinka Doo\" as his opening theme, and the invariable signoff that became another familiar national catchphrase: \"Good night, Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are.\"  For years no one knew who Mrs. Calabash referred to and Durante preferred to keep the mystery alive. One theory was that it referred to the owner of a restaurant in [[Calabash, North Carolina]], where Durante and his troupe had stopped to eat. He was so taken by the food, the service, and the chitchat he told the owner that he would make her famous. Since he did not know her name, he referred to her as \"Mrs. Calabash\".<ref>{{cite book| first=Tod | last=Benoit | title=Jimmy Durante | date=May 6, 2003 | publisher=[[Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers]] | work =Where Are They Buried? How Did They Die? Fitting Ends and Final Resting Places of the Famous, Infamous, and Noteworthy | pages = | language = | isbn=1579122876 }}</ref> Another idea was that it was a personal salute to his deceased wife, Jeanne...\"Calabash\" might have been a mangle of [[Calabasas, California|Calabasas]], the California city where they made their home during the last years of her life. His friend and co-star, Candy Candido, (in an interview with Chuck Shaden's ''Speaking of Radio'' in 1988),  reported that he met the actual woman in Chicago when traveling with Durante, but was sworn to keep the secret. Alternatively, Jimmy's  friend and radio producer, Phil Cohan revealed to Chuck Shaden's ''Speaking of Radio'' interview in 1988 that it was a fabrication. Needing a closing to his show, the writers tossed around several names, settling on Cohan's calabash pipe as the best-sounding moniker.\n\nAt a [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] meeting in 1966 (broadcast on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Monitor (NBC Radio)|Monitor]]'' program), Durante finally revealed that it was indeed a tribute to his wife. While driving across the country, they stopped in a small town called Calabash, whose name Jean had loved. \"Mrs. Calabash\" became his pet name for her, and he signed off his radio program with \"Good night, Mrs. Calabash.\" He added \"wherever you are\" after the first year.<ref>[http://monitorbeacon.net/sounds/monitor-1975-bw-sat5.mp3 NBC Monitor, January 25, 1975] (sound clip at 48:08) From [http://monitorbeacon.net/ the Monitor Tribute Pages]</ref>\n\nDurante married his second wife, Margaret \"Margie\" Little, at St. Malachy Roman Catholic Church in New York City on December 14, 1960. As a teenager she had been crowned Queen of the New Jersey State Fair. She attended New York University before being hired by the legendary [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] in New York City. She and Durante met there 16 years before their marriage, when he performed there and she was a hatcheck girl. She was 41 and he 67 when they married. With help from their attorney, Mary G. Rogan, the couple were able to adopt a baby, Cecilia Alicia (nicknamed CeCe and now known as CeCe Durante-Bloum), on [[Christmas Day]], 1961. CeCe became a champion horsewoman and then a horse trainer and horseback-riding instructor. Margie died on June 7, 2009, at the age of 89.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/lajollalight/obituary.aspx?n=margaret-durante-margie&pid=131282332 |title=Margaret \"Margie\" Durante Obituary: View Margaret Durante's Obituary by La Jolla Light |publisher=Legacy.com |date= |access-date=May 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Charitable work==\nOn August 15, 1958, for his charitable acts, Durante was awarded a three-foot-high brass loving cup by the Al Bahr Shriners Temple. The inscription reads: \"JIMMY DURANTE THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS COMEDIAN. A loving cup to you Jimmy, it's larger than your nose, but smaller than your heart. Happiness always, Al Bahr Temple, August 15, 1958.\"  Jimmy Durante started out his career with Clayton and Jackson and when he became a big star and they were left behind, he kept them on his payroll for the rest of their lives. \n\nDurante's love for children continued through the [[Fraternal Order of Eagles]], who among many causes raise money for handicapped and abused children. At Durante's first appearance at the Eagles International Convention in 1961, Judge Bob Hansen inquired about his fee for performing. Durante replied, \"Do not even mention money judge or I'll have to mention a figure that'll make ya sorry ya brought it up.\" \"What can we do then?\" asked Hansen. \"Help da kids,\" was Durante's reply. Durante performed for many years at Eagles conventions free of charge, even refusing travel money. The Fraternal Order of Eagles changed the name of their children's fund to the Jimmy Durante Children's Fund in his honor, and in his memory have raised over 20 million dollars to help children. A reporter once remarked of Durante after an interview: \"You could warm your hands on this one.\" One of the projects built using money from the Durante Fund was a heated therapy swimming pool at the Hughen School in [[Port Arthur, Texas]]. Completed in 1968, Durante named the pool the \"Inka Dinka Doo Pool\".\n\n==Politics==\nDurante was an active member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. In 1933, he appeared in an advertisement shown in theaters supporting [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] programs and wrote a musical score titled ''Give a Guy a Job'' to accompany it. He performed at both the inaugural gala for President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1961 and a year later at the famous [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] rally for the Democratic party that featured [[Marilyn Monroe]] [[Happy Birthday, Mr. President|singing \"Happy Birthday\" to JFK]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jiUu8od_I8 |title=Give a Man a Job - 1933 |publisher=YouTube |date=January 30, 2009 |access-date=May 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World Trailer22.jpg|thumb|left|Durante in ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'']]\n\nDurante continued his film appearances through ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' and television appearances through the early 1970s. He narrated the Rankin-Bass animated Christmas special ''[[Frosty the Snowman (TV program)|Frosty the Snowman]]'' (1969), re-run for many years since. The television work also included a series of commercial spots for [[Kellogg's Corn Flakes]] cereals in the mid-1960s, which introduced Durante's gravelly growl and narrow-eyed, large-nosed countenance to millions of children. \"Dis is Jimmy Durante, in puy-son!\" was his introduction to some of the Kellogg's spots. One of his last appearances was in a memorable television commercial for the 1973 Volkswagen Beetle, where he proclaimed that the new, roomier Beetle had \"plenty of breathin' room... for de old schnozzola!\"\n\nIn 1963, Durante recorded the album of [[pop standards]] ''September Song''. The album became a best-seller and provided Durante's re-introduction to yet another generation, almost three decades later. From the ''Jimmy Durante's Way of Life'' album came the gravelly interpretation of the song \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\", which accompanied the opening credits of the romantic comedy hit ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'', while his version of \"[[Make Someone Happy (song)|Make Someone Happy]]\" launched the film's closing credits. Both are included on the film's best-selling [[soundtrack]]. Durante also recorded a cover of the well known song ''[[I'll Be Seeing You (song)|I'll Be Seeing You]]'', which became a trademark song on his 1960s TV show. This song was also featured in the 2004 film ''[[The Notebook (2004 film)|The Notebook]]''.\n\nHe wrote a [[foreword]] for a humorous book compiled by Dick Hyman entitled ''Cockeyed Americana''. In the first paragraph of the ''\"Foreword!'', as Durante called it, he describes meeting Hyman and discussing the book and the contribution that Hyman wanted Durante to make to it. Durante wrote, \"Before I can say gaziggadeegasackeegazobbath, we're at his luxurious office.\" After reading the material Hyman had compiled for the book, Durante commented on it, \"COLOSSAL, GIGANTIC, MAGNANIMOUS, and last but not first, AURORA BOREALIS. ''[Capitalization Durante's]'' Four little words that make a sentence\u2014and a sentence that will eventually get me six months.\"\n\n[[File:Jimmy & Margaret Durante's grave.JPG|thumb|right|Jimmy and Margaret Durante's grave at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City]], California]]\nDurante retired from performing in 1972 after he became wheelchair-bound following a [[stroke]]. He died of [[pneumonia]] in [[Santa Monica, California]] on January 29, 1980, 12 days before he would have turned 87. He received [[Roman Catholic]] funeral rites four days later, with fellow entertainers including [[Desi Arnaz]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Marty Allen (comedian)|Marty Allen]], and [[Jack Carter (comedian)|Jack Carter]] in attendance, and was interred at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]], [[Culver City, California|Culver City]].<ref>\"Durante Family and Friends attend Funeral Rite\", ''The New York Times'', April 2, 1980, p. 13.</ref>\n\nOn June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Jimmy Durante among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name=\"Rosen2\">{{cite news |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Animation==\nJimmy Durante is known to most modern audiences as the character who narrated and sang the 1969 animated special ''[[Frosty the Snowman (TV program)|Frosty the Snowman]]''. He also performed the [[Ron Goodwin]] title song to the 1968 comedy-adventure ''[[Monte Carlo or Bust]]'' (titled ''[[Those Daring Young Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies]]'' in the U.S.) sung over the film's animated opening credits. \n\n===Allusions and references in animation===\nWhile his own career in animation was limited, Durante's distinctive voice, looks and catchphrases earned him numerous depictions and allusions in animation: A character in [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|M-G-M]] cartoons, [[Spike and Tyke (characters)|a bulldog named Spike, whose puppy son]] was always getting caught by accident in the middle of ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'s'' activities, referenced Durante with a raspy voice and an affectionate \"Dat's my boy!\" In another Tom and Jerry short, a starfish lands on Tom's head, giving him a big nose. He then proceeds with Durante's famous \"Ha-cha-cha-cha\" call. The 1943 [[Tex Avery]] cartoon \"[[What's Buzzin' Buzzard]]\" featured a vulture with a voice that sounded like Jimmy Durante. A Durante-like voice (originally by [[Doug Young (voice actor)|Doug Young]]) was also given to the father beagle, Doggie Daddy, in [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy]]'' cartoons, Doggie Daddy invariably addressing the junior beagle with a Durante-like \"Augie, my son, my son\", and with frequent citations of, \"That's my boy who said that!\" The 1945 MGM cartoon [[Jerky Turkey]] featured a turkey which was a caricature of Durante.\n\nMany Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons had characters based on Durante. One [[Harman-Ising]] short from 1933, ''[[Bosko's Picture Show]]'', featured a caricature of [[Adolf Hitler]] chasing Durante with a meat cleaver. Two examples from the 1940s include ''[[A Gruesome Twosome]]'', which features a cat based on Durante, and ''[[Baby Bottleneck]]'', which in unedited versions opens with a Durante-like stork. ''[[Book Revue]]'' shows the well-known (at that time) 1924 [[Edna Ferber]] novel ''[[So Big (novel)|So Big]]'' featuring a Durante caricature on the cover. The \"so big\" refers to his nose, and as a runaway criminal turns the corner by the book, Durante turns sideways using his nose to trip the criminal, allowing his capture. In ''[[Hollywood Daffy]]'', Durante is directly depicted as himself, pronouncing his catchphrase \"Those are the conditions that prevail!\" In ''[[The Mouse-Merized Cat]]'', Catstello (a [[Lou Costello]] mouse) is briefly hypnotized to imitate Jimmy Durante singing ''[[Lullaby of Broadway (song)|Lullaby of Broadway]]''. One of Durante's common catch phrases, \"I got a million of 'em!\", was used as Bugs' final line in ''[[Stage Door Cartoon]]''.\n\nA Durante-like voice was also used for [[Marvel Comics]] superhero [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]] in the [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon ''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]''.

His distinctive clipped gravelly speech, [[Lower East Side]] Manhattan accent, comic language-butchery, jazz-influenced songs, and prominent nose helped make him one of America's most familiar and popular personalities of the 1920s through the 1970s. He often referred to his nose as ''the schnozzola'' ([[Italian language|Italianization]] of the American [[Yiddish]] slang word ''schnoz'' \"big nose\"), and the word became his nickname.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\nDurante was born on the [[Lower East Side]] of New York City. He was the youngest of four children born to Rosa (Lentino) and Bartolomeo Durante, both of whom were immigrants from [[Salerno]], [[Italy]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rRVRi3_gxfwC&pg=PA7&dq=%22Chapter+2+Beginnings+And+Family+Roots+Durante+grew+%22|title=Jimmy Durante: His Show Business Career, with an Annotated Filmography and Discography|first=David|last=Bakish|date=March 7, 2007|publisher=McFarland|via=Google Books|isbn=9780786430222}}</ref> Bartolomeo was a barber.<ref>Fowler, Gene Jr. ''Schnozzola: The Story of Jimmy Durante'' Viking Press, 1951</ref><ref>Bakish, David ''Jimmy Durante: His Show Business Career, with an Annotated Filmography and Discography'' McFarland & Co., 1994 {{ISBN|978-0-89950-968-6}}</ref> Young Jimmy served as an [[Altar server#Altar servers in the Catholic Church|altar boy]] at [[St. Malachy Roman Catholic Church]], known as the Actor's Chapel.<ref>{{cite web|author=Vincenzo |url=http://www.sanctepater.com/2009/10/actors-chapel.html |title=The Actors' Chapel &#124; Sancte Pater |publisher=Sanctepater.blogspot.com |date=October 24, 2009 |access-date=May 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Early career===\nDurante dropped out of school in seventh grade to become a full-time [[ragtime]] pianist. He first played with his cousin, whose name was also Jimmy Durante. It was a family act, but he was too professional for his cousin. He continued working the city's [[piano bar]] circuit and earned the nickname \"ragtime Jimmy\", before he joined one of the first recognizable jazz bands in New York, the [[Original New Orleans Jazz Band]]. Durante was the only member not from [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. His routine of breaking into a song to deliver a joke, with band or orchestra chord punctuation after each line, became a Durante trademark. In 1920 the group was renamed Jimmy Durante's Jazz Band.\n\n==Stardom==\nBy the mid-1920s, Durante had become a [[vaudeville]] star and radio personality in a trio called Clayton, Jackson and Durante. [[Lou Clayton]] and [[Eddie Jackson (vaudeville)|Eddie Jackson]], Durante's closest friends, often reunited with Durante in subsequent years. Jackson and Durante appeared in the [[Cole Porter]] musical ''[[The New Yorkers]]'', which opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on December 8, 1930. Earlier that same year, the team appeared in the movie ''[[Roadhouse Nights]]'', ostensibly based on [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s novel ''[[Red Harvest]]''.\n\nBy 1934, Durante had a major record hit with his own novelty composition, \"[[Inka Dinka Doo]]\", with lyrics by [[Ben Ryan (composer)|Ben Ryan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/search/track/Inka+Dinka+Doo/order:default-asc |title=Track Search: Inka Dinka Doo |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=May 10, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808151814/http://www.allmusic.com/search/track/Inka+Dinka+Doo/order:default-asc |archivedate=August 8, 2011 }}</ref> It became his theme song for the rest of his life. A year later, Durante starred on Broadway in the [[Billy Rose]] stage musical ''[[Jumbo (musical)|Jumbo]]''.  A scene in which a police officer stopped Durante's character\u2014who was leading a live elephant across the stage\u2014to ask, \"what are you doing with that elephant?\", followed by Durante's reply, \"what elfin!?\", was a regular show-stopper. This comedy bit, also reprised in his role in ''[[Billy Rose's Jumbo (film)|Billy Rose's Jumbo]]'', likely contributed to the popularity of the idiom ''[[Elephant in the room#Origins|the elephant in the room]]''. Durante also appeared on Broadway in ''[[Show Girl (1929 musical)|Show Girl]]'' (1929), ''Strike Me Pink'' (1934) and ''[[Red, Hot and Blue]]'' (1936).\n[[File:Speak Easily (1932) 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buster Keaton]], [[Thelma Todd]] and Jimmy Durante in ''[[Speak Easily]]'' (1932)]]\nDuring the early 1930s, Durante alternated between Hollywood and Broadway. His early motion pictures included an original [[Rodgers & Hart]] musical ''[[The Phantom President]]'' (1932), which featured Durante singing the self-referential ''Schnozzola''.  He was initially paired with [[silent film]] legend [[Buster Keaton]] in a series of three popular comedies for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], ''[[Speak Easily]]'' (1932), ''[[The Passionate Plumber]]'' (1932), and ''[[What! No Beer?]]'' (1933), which were financial hits and a career springboard for the distinctive newcomer.  However, Keaton's vociferous dissatisfaction with constraints the studio had placed upon him, his perceived incompatibility with Durante's broad chatty humor, exacerbated by Keaton's alcoholism, led the studio to end the series. Durante went on to appear in ''[[The Wet Parade]]'' (1932), ''[[Broadway to Hollywood (1933 film)|Broadway to Hollywood]]'' (1933), ''[[The Man Who Came to Dinner (1942 film)|The Man Who Came to Dinner]]'' (1942, playing ''Banjo'', a character based on [[Harpo Marx]]), ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' (1946), ''[[Billy Rose's Jumbo (film)|Billy Rose's Jumbo]]'' (1962, based on the 1935 musical), and ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963). In 1934, he starred in ''[[Hollywood Party (1934 film)|Hollywood Party]]'', where he dreams he is 'Schnarzan', a parody of '[[Tarzan]]' who was popular at the time due to the [[Johnny Weissmuller]] films.\n\n==Radio==\n[[File:Jimmy durante 1935.JPG|thumb|upright|Durante on ''The Jumbo Fire Chief Program'', 1935]]\nOn September 10, 1933, Durante appeared on [[Eddie Cantor]]'s NBC radio show, ''[[The Chase and Sanborn Hour]]'', continuing until November 12 of that year. When Cantor left the show, Durante took over as its star from April 22 to September 30, 1934. He then moved on to ''[[The Jumbo Fire Chief Program]]'' (1935\u201336).\n\nDurante teamed with [[Garry Moore]] for ''[[The Durante-Moore Show]]'' in 1943. Durante's comic chemistry with the young, brushcut Moore brought Durante an even larger audience. \"Dat's my boy dat said dat!\" became an instant [[catchphrase]], which would later inspire the cartoon ''[[Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy]]''. The duo was one of the nation's favorites for the rest of the decade. Their [[Armed Forces Radio Network]] ''[[Command Performance (radio series)|Command Performance]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otr.net/?p=cmdp|title=Command Performance at OTR.Network (Old Time Radio)|website=www.otr.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otr.net/r/cmdp/107.ram|title=''Command Performance'' 1947-02-30, Carole Landis, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Durante (Real Audio)}}</ref> with [[Frank Sinatra]] remains a favorite of radio-show collectors today. Moore left the duo in mid-1947, and the program returned October 1, 1947 as ''[[The Jimmy Durante Show (radio program)|The Jimmy Durante Show]]''. Durante continued the show for three more years and featured a reunion of Clayton, Jackson and Durante on his April 21, 1948 broadcast.\n\n==Television==\nAlthough Durante made his television debut on November 1, 1950 (on the ''[[Four Star Revue]]'' - see below) he continued to keep a presence in radio, as a frequent guest on [[Tallulah Bankhead]]'s two-year [[NBC]] comedy-variety show ''[[The Big Show (NBC Radio)|The Big Show]]''. Durante was one of the cast on the show's premiere November 5, 1950, along with humorist [[Fred Allen]], singers Mindy Carson and [[Frankie Laine]], stage musical performer [[Ethel Merman]], actors [[Jose Ferrer]] and [[Paul Lukas]], and comic-singer [[Danny Thomas]] (about to become a major television star in his own right). A highlight of the premiere was Durante and Thomas, whose own nose rivaled Durante's, in a routine in which Durante accused Thomas of stealing his nose. \"Stay outta dis, no-nose!\" Durante barked at Bankhead to a big laugh.\n[[File:jimmy Durante in Broadway to Hollywood trailer.jpg|thumb|right|from the ''[[Broadway to Hollywood (1933 film)|Broadway to Hollywood]]'' trailer (1933)]]\n[[File:Pearl Bailey Jimmy Durante Pearl Bailey Show 1971.JPG|thumb|right|With the hostess on ''[[Pearl Bailey|The Pearl Bailey Show]]''  (1971) ]]\n\nFrom 1950 to 1951, Durante was the host once a month (alternating with Ed Wynn, Danny Thomas and Jack Carson) on Wednesday evenings at 8 p.m, on NBC's comedy-variety series ''[[Four Star Revue]]''. Jimmy continued with the show until 1954. \n\nDurante then had a half-hour variety show - ''[[The Jimmy Durante Show]]'' - on [[NBC]] from October 2, 1954, to June 23, 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046613/ |title=''The Jimmy Durante Show''|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=November 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, Durante teamed with sidekick [[Sonny King (singer)|Sonny King]], a collaboration that would continue until Durante's death.  He was often seen regularly in Las Vegas after Sunday Mass outside of the Guardian Angel Cathedral standing next to the priest and greeting the people as they left Mass.\n\nSeveral times in the 1960s, Durante served as host of ABC's [[Hollywood Palace]] variety show, which were taped live (and consequently include ad-libs by the seasoned vaudevillian).\n\nHis last regular television appearance was co-starring with the [[Lennon Sisters]] on \"[[Jimmy Durante Presents the Lennon Sisters]] Hour\" which lasted for one season on ABC (1969\u20131970).\n\n==Marriages==\nDurante's first wife was Jean \"Jeanne\" Olson, whom he married on June 19, 1921. She was born in Ohio on August 31, 1896. She was 46 years old when she died on [[Valentine's Day]] in 1943, after a lingering heart ailment of about two years, although different newspaper accounts of her death suggest she was 45 or perhaps 52.<ref>See California Death Records - Jeanne Durante</ref> As her death was not immediately expected, Durante was touring in New York at the time and returned to Los Angeles right away to complete the funeral arrangements.\n\n{{anchor|Mrs. Calabash}}\nDurante's radio show was bracketed with two trademarks: \"Inka Dinka Doo\" as his opening theme, and the invariable signoff that became another familiar national catchphrase: \"Good night, Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are.\"  For years no one knew who Mrs. Calabash referred to and Durante preferred to keep the mystery alive. One theory was that it referred to the owner of a restaurant in [[Calabash, North Carolina]], where Durante and his troupe had stopped to eat. He was so taken by the food, the service, and the chitchat he told the owner that he would make her famous. Since he did not know her name, he referred to her as \"Mrs. Calabash\".<ref>{{cite book| first=Tod | last=Benoit | title=Jimmy Durante | date=May 6, 2003 | publisher=[[Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers]] | work =Where Are They Buried?

His friend and co-star, Candy Candido, (in an interview with Chuck Shaden's ''Speaking of Radio'' in 1988),  reported that he met the actual woman in Chicago when traveling with Durante, but was sworn to keep the secret. Alternatively, Jimmy's  friend and radio producer, Phil Cohan revealed to Chuck Shaden's ''Speaking of Radio'' interview in 1988 that it was a fabrication. Needing a closing to his show, the writers tossed around several names, settling on Cohan's calabash pipe as the best-sounding moniker.\n\nAt a [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] meeting in 1966 (broadcast on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Monitor (NBC Radio)|Monitor]]'' program), Durante finally revealed that it was indeed a tribute to his wife. While driving across the country, they stopped in a small town called Calabash, whose name Jean had loved. \"Mrs. Calabash\" became his pet name for her, and he signed off his radio program with \"Good night, Mrs. Calabash.\" He added \"wherever you are\" after the first year.<ref>[http://monitorbeacon.net/sounds/monitor-1975-bw-sat5.mp3 NBC Monitor, January 25, 1975] (sound clip at 48:08) From [http://monitorbeacon.net/ the Monitor Tribute Pages]</ref>\n\nDurante married his second wife, Margaret \"Margie\" Little, at St. Malachy Roman Catholic Church in New York City on December 14, 1960. As a teenager she had been crowned Queen of the New Jersey State Fair. She attended New York University before being hired by the legendary [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] in New York City. She and Durante met there 16 years before their marriage, when he performed there and she was a hatcheck girl. She was 41 and he 67 when they married. With help from their attorney, Mary G. Rogan, the couple were able to adopt a baby, Cecilia Alicia (nicknamed CeCe and now known as CeCe Durante-Bloum), on [[Christmas Day]], 1961. CeCe became a champion horsewoman and then a horse trainer and horseback-riding instructor. Margie died on June 7, 2009, at the age of 89.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/lajollalight/obituary.aspx?n=margaret-durante-margie&pid=131282332 |title=Margaret \"Margie\" Durante Obituary: View Margaret Durante's Obituary by La Jolla Light |publisher=Legacy.com |date= |access-date=May 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Charitable work==\nOn August 15, 1958, for his charitable acts, Durante was awarded a three-foot-high brass loving cup by the Al Bahr Shriners Temple. The inscription reads: \"JIMMY DURANTE THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS COMEDIAN. A loving cup to you Jimmy, it's larger than your nose, but smaller than your heart. Happiness always, Al Bahr Temple, August 15, 1958.\"  Jimmy Durante started out his career with Clayton and Jackson and when he became a big star and they were left behind, he kept them on his payroll for the rest of their lives. \n\nDurante's love for children continued through the [[Fraternal Order of Eagles]], who among many causes raise money for handicapped and abused children. At Durante's first appearance at the Eagles International Convention in 1961, Judge Bob Hansen inquired about his fee for performing. Durante replied, \"Do not even mention money judge or I'll have to mention a figure that'll make ya sorry ya brought it up.\" \"What can we do then?\" asked Hansen. \"Help da kids,\" was Durante's reply. Durante performed for many years at Eagles conventions free of charge, even refusing travel money. The Fraternal Order of Eagles changed the name of their children's fund to the Jimmy Durante Children's Fund in his honor, and in his memory have raised over 20 million dollars to help children. A reporter once remarked of Durante after an interview: \"You could warm your hands on this one.\" One of the projects built using money from the Durante Fund was a heated therapy swimming pool at the Hughen School in [[Port Arthur, Texas]]. Completed in 1968, Durante named the pool the \"Inka Dinka Doo Pool\".\n\n==Politics==\nDurante was an active member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. In 1933, he appeared in an advertisement shown in theaters supporting [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] programs and wrote a musical score titled ''Give a Guy a Job'' to accompany it. He performed at both the inaugural gala for President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1961 and a year later at the famous [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] rally for the Democratic party that featured [[Marilyn Monroe]] [[Happy Birthday, Mr. President|singing \"Happy Birthday\" to JFK]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jiUu8od_I8 |title=Give a Man a Job - 1933 |publisher=YouTube |date=January 30, 2009 |access-date=May 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World Trailer22.jpg|thumb|left|Durante in ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'']]\n\nDurante continued his film appearances through ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' and television appearances through the early 1970s. He narrated the Rankin-Bass animated Christmas special ''[[Frosty the Snowman (TV program)|Frosty the Snowman]]'' (1969), re-run for many years since. The television work also included a series of commercial spots for [[Kellogg's Corn Flakes]] cereals in the mid-1960s, which introduced Durante's gravelly growl and narrow-eyed, large-nosed countenance to millions of children. \"Dis is Jimmy Durante, in puy-son!\" was his introduction to some of the Kellogg's spots. One of his last appearances was in a memorable television commercial for the 1973 Volkswagen Beetle, where he proclaimed that the new, roomier Beetle had \"plenty of breathin' room... for de old schnozzola!\"\n\nIn 1963, Durante recorded the album of [[pop standards]] ''September Song''. The album became a best-seller and provided Durante's re-introduction to yet another generation, almost three decades later. From the ''Jimmy Durante's Way of Life'' album came the gravelly interpretation of the song \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\", which accompanied the opening credits of the romantic comedy hit ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'', while his version of \"[[Make Someone Happy (song)|Make Someone Happy]]\" launched the film's closing credits. Both are included on the film's best-selling [[soundtrack]]. Durante also recorded a cover of the well known song ''[[I'll Be Seeing You (song)|I'll Be Seeing You]]'', which became a trademark song on his 1960s TV show. This song was also featured in the 2004 film ''[[The Notebook (2004 film)|The Notebook]]''.\n\nHe wrote a [[foreword]] for a humorous book compiled by Dick Hyman entitled ''Cockeyed Americana''. In the first paragraph of the ''\"Foreword!'', as Durante called it, he describes meeting Hyman and discussing the book and the contribution that Hyman wanted Durante to make to it. Durante wrote, \"Before I can say gaziggadeegasackeegazobbath, we're at his luxurious office.\" After reading the material Hyman had compiled for the book, Durante commented on it, \"COLOSSAL, GIGANTIC, MAGNANIMOUS, and last but not first, AURORA BOREALIS. ''[Capitalization Durante's]'' Four little words that make a sentence\u2014and a sentence that will eventually get me six months.\"\n\n[[File:Jimmy & Margaret Durante's grave.JPG|thumb|right|Jimmy and Margaret Durante's grave at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City]], California]]\nDurante retired from performing in 1972 after he became wheelchair-bound following a [[stroke]]. He died of [[pneumonia]] in [[Santa Monica, California]] on January 29, 1980, 12 days before he would have turned 87. He received [[Roman Catholic]] funeral rites four days later, with fellow entertainers including [[Desi Arnaz]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Marty Allen (comedian)|Marty Allen]], and [[Jack Carter (comedian)|Jack Carter]] in attendance, and was interred at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]], [[Culver City, California|Culver City]].<ref>\"Durante Family and Friends attend Funeral Rite\", ''The New York Times'', April 2, 1980, p. 13.</ref>\n\nOn June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Jimmy Durante among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name=\"Rosen2\">{{cite news |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Animation==\nJimmy Durante is known to most modern audiences as the character who narrated and sang the 1969 animated special ''[[Frosty the Snowman (TV program)|Frosty the Snowman]]''. He also performed the [[Ron Goodwin]] title song to the 1968 comedy-adventure ''[[Monte Carlo or Bust]]'' (titled ''[[Those Daring Young Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies]]'' in the U.S.) sung over the film's animated opening credits. \n\n===Allusions and references in animation===\nWhile his own career in animation was limited, Durante's distinctive voice, looks and catchphrases earned him numerous depictions and allusions in animation: A character in [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|M-G-M]] cartoons, [[Spike and Tyke (characters)|a bulldog named Spike, whose puppy son]] was always getting caught by accident in the middle of ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'s'' activities, referenced Durante with a raspy voice and an affectionate \"Dat's my boy!\" In another Tom and Jerry short, a starfish lands on Tom's head, giving him a big nose. He then proceeds with Durante's famous \"Ha-cha-cha-cha\" call. The 1943 [[Tex Avery]] cartoon \"[[What's Buzzin' Buzzard]]\" featured a vulture with a voice that sounded like Jimmy Durante. A Durante-like voice (originally by [[Doug Young (voice actor)|Doug Young]]) was also given to the father beagle, Doggie Daddy, in [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy]]'' cartoons, Doggie Daddy invariably addressing the junior beagle with a Durante-like \"Augie, my son, my son\", and with frequent citations of, \"That's my boy who said that!\" The 1945 MGM cartoon [[Jerky Turkey]] featured a turkey which was a caricature of Durante.\n\nMany Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons had characters based on Durante. One [[Harman-Ising]] short from 1933, ''[[Bosko's Picture Show]]'', featured a caricature of [[Adolf Hitler]] chasing Durante with a meat cleaver. Two examples from the 1940s include ''[[A Gruesome Twosome]]'', which features a cat based on Durante, and ''[[Baby Bottleneck]]'', which in unedited versions opens with a Durante-like stork. ''[[Book Revue]]'' shows the well-known (at that time) 1924 [[Edna Ferber]] novel ''[[So Big (novel)|So Big]]'' featuring a Durante caricature on the cover. The \"so big\" refers to his nose, and as a runaway criminal turns the corner by the book, Durante turns sideways using his nose to trip the criminal, allowing his capture. In ''[[Hollywood Daffy]]'', Durante is directly depicted as himself, pronouncing his catchphrase \"Those are the conditions that prevail!\" In ''[[The Mouse-Merized Cat]]'', Catstello (a [[Lou Costello]] mouse) is briefly hypnotized to imitate Jimmy Durante singing ''[[Lullaby of Broadway (song)|Lullaby of Broadway]]''. One of Durante's common catch phrases, \"I got a million of 'em!\", was used as Bugs' final line in ''[[Stage Door Cartoon]]''.\n\nA Durante-like voice was also used for [[Marvel Comics]] superhero [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]] in the [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon ''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]''. The voice and appearance of Crispy, the mascot for [[Crispy Critters]] cereal, was also based on Durante.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.x-entertainment.com/articles/0725/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130209193924/http://www.x-entertainment.com/articles/0725/|archive-date=February 9, 2013|url-status=dead|title=X-Entertainment: Crispy Critters Cereal Tribute}}</ref> In [[Disney's House of Mouse]], a character named Mortimer Mouse (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]) was based on Durante, complete with the \"ha-cha-cha!\". One of the main characters in Terrytoons' Heckle and Jeckle cartoon series also takes to imitating Jimmy in 1948's Taming The Cat (\"Get a couple of song birds today...\").\n\n==Legacy==\nSince Durante's death, his songs have featured in several films. [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[Kim Basinger]] performed impressions of Durante from ''The Man Who Came To Dinner'' singing \"Did You Ever Have the Feeling\" in 1988's ''[[My Stepmother Is an Alien]]''.<ref>{{AFI film|58978|title=My Stepmother Is an Alien}}</ref> His performance of \"[[Young at Heart (Frank Sinatra song)|Young at Heart]]\" was featured in ''[[City Slickers]]'' (1991)<ref>{{AFI film|58801|title=City Slickers}}</ref> and his versions of \"As Time Goes By\" and  \"Make Someone Happy\" played over the opening and closing credits of ''Sleepless in Seattle'' (1993).

College Bowl''''') was a radio, television, and [[student quiz show]]. ''College Bowl'' first aired on US radio stations in 1953. It then moved to US television [[broadcast networks]], airing 1959 to 1963 on [[CBS]] and from 1963 to 1970 on [[NBC]]. In 1977, the game resurfaced as an activity on college campuses through an affiliation with the [[Association of College Unions International]] (ACUI) that lasted for 31 years. In 2008, the College Bowl Company announced its suspension of the College Bowl program, citing increased costs and financial infeasibility of continuing to work with ACUI.\n\n==History==\n''College Bowl'' originated as a [[United Service Organizations|USO]] activity created by [[Canadians|Canadian]] Don Reid for soldiers serving in [[World War II]]. The game was then developed into a radio show by Reid and John Moses. [[Grant Tinker]], later President of [[NBC]] and [[MTM Enterprises]], got his start as an assistant on the show.\n\nTwo four-member teams representing various colleges and universities competed; one member of each team was its captain. The game began with a \"toss-up\" question for ten points. The first player to buzz in got the right to answer, but if s/he was wrong, the other team could try to answer (if a player buzzed in before the host finished reading the question and was wrong, the team was penalized five points). Answering a \"toss-up\" correctly earned the team the right to answer a multi-part \"bonus\" question worth up to thirty points; the team members could collaborate, but only the captain was allowed to actually give the answer.  The game continued in this manner, and was played in halves. During halftime, the players were allowed to show a short promotional film of their school or they might talk about career plans or the like.\n\nThe first ''College Quiz Bowl'' match was played on NBC radio on October 10, 1953, when [[Northwestern University]] defeated [[Columbia University]], 135\u201360. Twenty-six episodes ran in that first season, with winning teams receiving $500 grants for their school. ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' magazine became the sponsor for the 1954\u201355 season, and a short third season in the autumn of 1955 finished the run. The most dominant team was the [[University of Minnesota]], which had teams appear in 23 of the 68 broadcast matches. The 1953\u201355 series had a powerful appeal because it used remote broadcasts; each team was located at their own college where they were cheered on by their wildly enthusiastic classmates. The effect was akin to listening to a [[American football|football]] game, but this type of excitement evaporated in later versions, in which both teams competed in the same room.\n\n==Television==\nThough a pilot was shot in the spring of 1955, the game did not move to television until 1959. As ''G.E. College Bowl'' with [[General Electric]] as the primary sponsor, the show ran on [[CBS]] from 1959 to 1963, and moved back to NBC from 1963 to 1970. [[Allen Ludden]] was the original host, but left to do ''[[Password (TV series)|Password]]'' full-time in 1962. [[Robert Earle]] was moderator for the rest of the run. The norm developed in the Ludden-Earle era of undefeated teams retiring after winning five games. Each winning team earned $1,500 in scholarship grants from [[General Electric]] with runner-up teams receiving $500. A team's fifth victory awarded $3,000 from General Electric plus $1,500 from [[Gimbels]] department stores for a grand total of $10,500.<ref>{{Cite journal | url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/UW/UW-idx?type=div&did=UW.v66i8.i0004&isize=text |title = About the University|journal = Wisconsin Alumni Magazine|volume = 66|issue = 8|date = May 1965}}</ref> On April 16, 1967, ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine matched GE's payouts so that each victory won $3,000 and runners-up earned $1,000.

[[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] was the second college to win five contests and be retired. Colgate later defeated Rutgers in a special one-time playoff contest to become the only six-time winner in a \"five-win-limit\" competition. An upset occurred in 1961, when the small liberal arts colleges of [[Hobart and William Smith]] in Geneva, New York, defeated Baylor University to become the third college to retire undefeated.  In another surprise, [[Lafayette College]] retired undefeated in fall 1962 after beating the [[University of California, Berkeley]] for its fifth victory, a [[Goliath|David and Goliath]] event. Another upset occurred in 1966, when the all-female [[Agnes Scott College]] from Georgia, defeated an all-male team from [[Princeton University]].<ref>https://slate.com/culture/2018/08/agnes-scott-vs-princeton-college-bowl-the-biggest-upset-in-quiz-show-history.html</ref>\n\nThe show licensed and spun off three other academic competitions in the U.S.:\n*''Alumni Fun'', which appeared on all three major TV networks in the 1960s and featured former college students\n*''[[Bible Bowl]]'', which has evolved into at least three separate national competitions and used the [[Bible]] as a source\n*''High School Bowl'', which was broadcast in some local TV markets and featured high school students\n\n==International versions==\n\n===''University Challenge''===\n{{main|University Challenge}}\nA [[United Kingdom|British]] version of the televised College Bowl competition was launched as ''[[University Challenge]]'' in 1962. The program, presented by [[Bamber Gascoigne]], produced by [[Granada Television]] and broadcast across the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, was very popular and ran until it was taken off the air in 1987. In 1994 the show was resurrected by the [[BBC]] with [[Jeremy Paxman]] as the new quizmaster. It remains very popular in Britain. The show, and the catch phrase used by Gascoigne (and later Paxman) before each toss-up question, \"Your starter for 10,\" was the inspiration for the novel ''[[Starter for Ten (novel)|Starter for 10]]'', and the subsequent [[Starter for 10 (film)|film]]. A [[University Challenge (New Zealand)|New Zealand version]] of ''University Challenge'' ran from 1976 to 1989, and was revived in 2014.\n\n===''Challenging Times''===\n{{main|Challenging Times}}\nAn [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] version of the competition called ''[[Challenging Times]]'' ran between 1991 and 2002. It was sponsored by [[The Irish Times]] newspaper, and presented by Kevin Myers, then a columnist with that newspaper. Over the course of the show, [[University College Cork]] had the most wins, with three, while [[National University of Ireland, Galway]] qualified for the most finals, winning twice and placing second twice.\n\n==Later history==\nThe game returned to radio from 1979 to 1982, hosted by [[Art Fleming]] (the host of the original ''[[Jeopardy!]]''), with the 1978 and 1979 national tournament semi-finals and finals appearing on syndicated television. The two champions from those years competed against teams from the UK for the \"College Bowl World Championship,\" which were also televised; in 1978, [[Stanford University]] played a team of UK all-stars under College Bowl rules, and in 1979, [[Davidson College]] played [[Sidney Sussex|Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge University]] under University Challenge rules. (The UK teams won in both years.) There have been two television appearances since then; the 1984 tournament semi-finals and finals aired on [[NBC]], hosted by [[Pat Sajak]] (of ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' fame), and the entire 1987 tournament on [[Disney Channel]], hosted by [[Dick Cavett]]. The [[University of Minnesota]] won both iterations.\n\nIn 1970, modern quiz bowl invitational tournaments began with the Southeastern Invitational Tournament, and the circuit expanded through the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. These tournaments increasingly made various modifications to the College Bowl format, and came to be known as [[quiz bowl]].

College Bowl''''') was a radio, television, and [[student quiz show]]. ''College Bowl'' first aired on US radio stations in 1953. It then moved to US television [[broadcast networks]], airing 1959 to 1963 on [[CBS]] and from 1963 to 1970 on [[NBC]]. In 1977, the game resurfaced as an activity on college campuses through an affiliation with the [[Association of College Unions International]] (ACUI) that lasted for 31 years. In 2008, the College Bowl Company announced its suspension of the College Bowl program, citing increased costs and financial infeasibility of continuing to work with ACUI.\n\n==History==\n''College Bowl'' originated as a [[United Service Organizations|USO]] activity created by [[Canadians|Canadian]] Don Reid for soldiers serving in [[World War II]]. The game was then developed into a radio show by Reid and John Moses. [[Grant Tinker]], later President of [[NBC]] and [[MTM Enterprises]], got his start as an assistant on the show.\n\nTwo four-member teams representing various colleges and universities competed; one member of each team was its captain. The game began with a \"toss-up\" question for ten points. The first player to buzz in got the right to answer, but if s/he was wrong, the other team could try to answer (if a player buzzed in before the host finished reading the question and was wrong, the team was penalized five points). Answering a \"toss-up\" correctly earned the team the right to answer a multi-part \"bonus\" question worth up to thirty points; the team members could collaborate, but only the captain was allowed to actually give the answer.  The game continued in this manner, and was played in halves. During halftime, the players were allowed to show a short promotional film of their school or they might talk about career plans or the like.\n\nThe first ''College Quiz Bowl'' match was played on NBC radio on October 10, 1953, when [[Northwestern University]] defeated [[Columbia University]], 135\u201360. Twenty-six episodes ran in that first season, with winning teams receiving $500 grants for their school. ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' magazine became the sponsor for the 1954\u201355 season, and a short third season in the autumn of 1955 finished the run. The most dominant team was the [[University of Minnesota]], which had teams appear in 23 of the 68 broadcast matches. The 1953\u201355 series had a powerful appeal because it used remote broadcasts; each team was located at their own college where they were cheered on by their wildly enthusiastic classmates. The effect was akin to listening to a [[American football|football]] game, but this type of excitement evaporated in later versions, in which both teams competed in the same room.\n\n==Television==\nThough a pilot was shot in the spring of 1955, the game did not move to television until 1959. As ''G.E. College Bowl'' with [[General Electric]] as the primary sponsor, the show ran on [[CBS]] from 1959 to 1963, and moved back to NBC from 1963 to 1970. [[Allen Ludden]] was the original host, but left to do ''[[Password (TV series)|Password]]'' full-time in 1962. [[Robert Earle]] was moderator for the rest of the run. The norm developed in the Ludden-Earle era of undefeated teams retiring after winning five games. Each winning team earned $1,500 in scholarship grants from [[General Electric]] with runner-up teams receiving $500. A team's fifth victory awarded $3,000 from General Electric plus $1,500 from [[Gimbels]] department stores for a grand total of $10,500.<ref>{{Cite journal | url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/UW/UW-idx?type=div&did=UW.v66i8.i0004&isize=text |title = About the University|journal = Wisconsin Alumni Magazine|volume = 66|issue = 8|date = May 1965}}</ref> On April 16, 1967, ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine matched GE's payouts so that each victory won $3,000 and runners-up earned $1,000. The payouts from Gimbels department stores remained the same so that five-time champions retired with a grand total of $19,500.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&dat=19670808&id=NHMhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qYgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4097,2224806 |title = Schenectady Gazette - Google News Archive Search}}</ref>\n\n[[Colgate University]] was the first team to win five consecutive contests and become \"retired undefeated champions,\" defeating [[New York University]] in Colgate's first appearance in April 1960 when NYU was going for its fifth win. [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] was the second college to win five contests and be retired. Colgate later defeated Rutgers in a special one-time playoff contest to become the only six-time winner in a \"five-win-limit\" competition. An upset occurred in 1961, when the small liberal arts colleges of [[Hobart and William Smith]] in Geneva, New York, defeated Baylor University to become the third college to retire undefeated.  In another surprise, [[Lafayette College]] retired undefeated in fall 1962 after beating the [[University of California, Berkeley]] for its fifth victory, a [[Goliath|David and Goliath]] event. Another upset occurred in 1966, when the all-female [[Agnes Scott College]] from Georgia, defeated an all-male team from [[Princeton University]].<ref>https://slate.com/culture/2018/08/agnes-scott-vs-princeton-college-bowl-the-biggest-upset-in-quiz-show-history.html</ref>\n\nThe show licensed and spun off three other academic competitions in the U.S.:\n*''Alumni Fun'', which appeared on all three major TV networks in the 1960s and featured former college students\n*''[[Bible Bowl]]'', which has evolved into at least three separate national competitions and used the [[Bible]] as a source\n*''High School Bowl'', which was broadcast in some local TV markets and featured high school students\n\n==International versions==\n\n===''University Challenge''===\n{{main|University Challenge}}\nA [[United Kingdom|British]] version of the televised College Bowl competition was launched as ''[[University Challenge]]'' in 1962. The program, presented by [[Bamber Gascoigne]], produced by [[Granada Television]] and broadcast across the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, was very popular and ran until it was taken off the air in 1987. In 1994 the show was resurrected by the [[BBC]] with [[Jeremy Paxman]] as the new quizmaster. It remains very popular in Britain. The show, and the catch phrase used by Gascoigne (and later Paxman) before each toss-up question, \"Your starter for 10,\" was the inspiration for the novel ''[[Starter for Ten (novel)|Starter for 10]]'', and the subsequent [[Starter for 10 (film)|film]]. A [[University Challenge (New Zealand)|New Zealand version]] of ''University Challenge'' ran from 1976 to 1989, and was revived in 2014.\n\n===''Challenging Times''===\n{{main|Challenging Times}}\nAn [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] version of the competition called ''[[Challenging Times]]'' ran between 1991 and 2002. It was sponsored by [[The Irish Times]] newspaper, and presented by Kevin Myers, then a columnist with that newspaper. Over the course of the show, [[University College Cork]] had the most wins, with three, while [[National University of Ireland, Galway]] qualified for the most finals, winning twice and placing second twice.\n\n==Later history==\nThe game returned to radio from 1979 to 1982, hosted by [[Art Fleming]] (the host of the original ''[[Jeopardy!]]''), with the 1978 and 1979 national tournament semi-finals and finals appearing on syndicated television. The two champions from those years competed against teams from the UK for the \"College Bowl World Championship,\" which were also televised; in 1978, [[Stanford University]] played a team of UK all-stars under College Bowl rules, and in 1979, [[Davidson College]] played [[Sidney Sussex|Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge University]] under University Challenge rules. (The UK teams won in both years.) There have been two television appearances since then; the 1984 tournament semi-finals and finals aired on [[NBC]], hosted by [[Pat Sajak]] (of [[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]] fame), and the entire 1987 tournament on [[Disney Channel]], hosted by [[Dick Cavett]]. The [[University of Minnesota]] won both iterations.\n\nIn 1970, modern quiz bowl invitational tournaments began with the Southeastern Invitational Tournament, and the circuit expanded through the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. These tournaments increasingly made various modifications to the College Bowl format, and came to be known as [[quiz bowl]]. Earlier invitational tournaments, such as the ''Syra-quiz'' at [[Syracuse University]], had occurred in the 1950s and 1960s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hendricks Chapel: Seventy-five Years of Service to Syracuse University|page=209|first1=Phillips|last1=Richard L.|last2=Wright|first2=Donald G.}}</ref> {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nIn 1976, the program became affiliated with the Association of College Unions International (ACUI) [http://www.acui.org/Acui/Programs/Collegebowl/index.cfm], which continued to promote the competition as a non-broadcast event after the demise of the radio and television experiments.

In the video the students are heard singing a chant to the tune of \"[[If You're Happy and You Know It]]\". The chant begins with the [[refrain]], \"There will never be a [[nigger]] at [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon|SAE]]\", which is followed by the lyrics, \"You can hang them from a tree, but they'll never sign with me\", followed again by the refrain. The chant also referenced two key elements of the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] era; [[lynching]] ''(You can hang them from a tree)'' and [[racial segregation]] ''(but they'll never sign with me)'', in the form of denial of admission to people of color (African Americans in this case) or any ethnicity other than white into the fraternity.<ref name=dailynews1>{{cite news |title=University of Oklahoma president evicts Sigma Alpha Epsilon brothers from campus frat house after racist video |first=Meg |last=Wagner |date=March 10, 2015 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ou-president-evicts-sigma-alpha-epsilon-frat-house-article-1.2142516|work=New York Daily News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jake |last=New |date=March 8, 2015 |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/03/09/fraternity-caught-video-singing-racist-song|title=Fraternity Caught on Video Singing Racist Song|work=InsideHigherEd.com|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe video of the incident was reported on by ''[[The Oklahoma Daily]]'' on Sunday March 8, and also posted online by student group OU Unheard.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/09/university-oklahoma-fraternity-racism-bigots | title=Oklahoma fraternity's 'racists and bigots' condemned as protests grow |first=Jessica |last=Glenza | newspaper=The Guardian | date=March 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAn additional video emerged showing the fraternity's house mother, Beauton Gilbow, using the same word \"nigger\" while singing along to a rap song at the fraternity in 2013.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/11/us/university-of-oklahoma-sigma-alpha-epsilon-racist-fraternity-video.html |title= As Two Oklahoma Students Are Expelled for Racist Chant, Sigma Alpha Epsilon Vows Wider Inquiry  |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 11, 2015 |accessdate=March 11, 2015 |first1=Manny |last1=Fernandez |first2=Richard |last2=P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a}}</ref> Gilbow later stated that she was singing along at the time to rapper [[Trinidad James]]' song \"[[All Gold Everything]]\", which heavily uses the same racial pejorative, and apologized for any offense.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/beauton-gilbow-statement-rap-video |title=Fraternity 'Mom' Is 'Heartbroken' Over Video That Shows Her Singing N-Word |work=[[Talking Points Memo]] |first=Catherine |last=Thompson |date=March 11, 2015 |accessdate=March 11, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===SAE chapter suspended===\nOn March 8, 2015, the national office of Sigma Alpha Epsilon closed the OU Chapter house, and OU officials gave SAE members until the end of March 10, 2015 to move out.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McLaughlin|first1=Eliott C.|title='Disgraceful' University of Oklahoma fraternity shuttered after racist chant|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/09/us/oklahoma-fraternity-chant/|accessdate=March 13, 2015 |website=cnn.com |publisher=CNN|date=March 10, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news |url=http://www.oudaily.com/news/parker-rice-identified-as-student-expelled-from-ou-after-racist/article_424a63fc-c74c-11e4-8f34-03aacf374cdb.html |title=Parker Rice identified as student expelled from OU after racist chant |work=OU Daily |author=OU Staff |date=March 10, 2015 |accessdate=March 10, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nTwo days later, OU Facilities Management removed the fraternity's Greek letters from the house.

Protesters later gathered outside the Rice family home in Dallas and protested his actions.\n\nIn response to Rice's apology, a member of the chapter who was not with the members on the bus but was present in the chapter house on the day of the incident, confirmed in an interview that the students and members of the chapter were drinking alcohol in the chapter house before the incident. OU president Boren suspected that the chant was learned on the fraternity's leadership cruise but the SAE national headquarters issued a statement that the chant is not one of their sanctioned songs and they would never allow such chant to be sung, stating that any member or chapter who adopts hostile chants are dealt with severe punishment. However, both the national headquarters and Boren state that the chant was informally shared during the leadership cruise by other members.\n\n===Reactions===\nThe SAE-OU chapter's only two African-American alumni, Jonathan Davis and William Bruce James II, defended the house mother, Beauton Gilbow, over her actions and voiced out their support for the chapter's closure. Davis has stated that his co-members and batch mates in the chapter would never allow discriminatory behaviour to take place while James re-echoed Davis' statements and stated that he disowns the people in the videos.\n\nMeanwhile, a student from the rival [[Oklahoma State University]], who also bears the name Parker Rice, became the subject of hate mail and death threats in a case of mistaken identity. Unlike the Parker Rice in the racist chant who was a Dallas native, the other Parker Rice, was a native of Oklahoma and was an Asian Studies student majoring in Japanese. He admits his membership at the Oklahoma State University chapter of [[Alpha Phi Omega]] while condemning the racist chant incident. The Oklahoma-native Rice later posted on social media that he has no connection to SAE and that he was not the Parker Rice in the video.\n\nIn response to the video the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma Sooners]] college football team held arm-in-arm protest vigils instead of attending practice.<ref>{{cite web | website=espn.go.com |publisher=ESPN | url=http://espn.go.com/blog/big12/post/_/id/97130/sae-video-scandal-could-galvanize-oklahoma-sooners | title=SAE video scandal could galvanize Sooners |first=Jake |last=Trotter | date=March 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nSeveral news media reports highlighted the fact that SAE, which was founded before the [[American Civil War]] in the South had a history of [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon#Discriminatory incidents|discriminatory incidents]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/inside_higher_ed/2015/03/behind_the_chant_discrimination_at_oklahoma_s_sae_chapter_goes_deeper_than.html |first=Jake |last=New | title=The Ugly, Racist, Deadly History of Sigma Alpha Epsilon | newspaper=Slate | date=March 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2015/0314/University-of-Oklahoma-fraternity-has-history-of-racist-incidents-elsewhere-video | title=University of Oklahoma fraternity has history of racist incidents elsewhere  | newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |first=Brad |last=Knickerbocker | date=March 14, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/03/11/us/ap-us-sae-profile.html | title=Fraternity in Racist Video Has Roots in Antebellum South | date=March 11, 2015 | newspaper=The New York Times |author=The Associated Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403134300/https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/03/11/us/ap-us-sae-profile.html |archivedate=March 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nRobby Soave of the [[Reason Foundation]] wrote that the OU had failed to expel a freshman football player \"caught on tape punching a female student in the face\" in 2014.
