Went the Strings of My Heart]]\". The first disco track they released was \"Love Epidemic\" in 1973. However, they are best known for their [[21st Grammy Awards|Grammy]] winning song, \"[[Disco Inferno]]\", originally released in 1976, becoming a UK pop hit and US R&B hit.  After inclusion in the ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' [[soundtrack]], the song was re-released in 1978 and became a US pop hit.\n\n==History==\n===From early 1970s to the dissolution in the early 1990s===\nThe history of the Trammps grew from the 1960s group ''The Volcanos'', who later became ''The Moods''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> With a number of line-up changes by the early 1970s, the band membership included gospel-influenced lead singer Jimmy Ellis, drummer and singer (bass voice) [[Earl Young (drummer)|Earl Young]], with brothers Stanley and Harold 'Doc' Wade. Members of the Philadelphia recording band [[MFSB]] played with the group on records and on tour in the 1970s with singer Robert Upchurch joining later. The group was produced by the Philadelphia team of Ronnie Baker, Norman Harris and Young, all MFSB mainstays who played on the recording sessions and contributed songs.\n\nTheir debut [[record chart|chart]] entry came via an upbeat [[cover version]] of the standard \"[[Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart]]\", featuring Young's bass voice, which became a [[Top 40|Top 20]] US [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart [[hit record|hit]] in 1972.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"th120308\">{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Dys |work=[[The Herald (Rock Hill)|The Herald]] |location=[[Rock Hill, SC]] |title='Disco Inferno' singer Jimmy Ellis of Rock Hill dies at 74 |url=http://www.heraldonline.com/2012/03/08/3804499/singer-of-disco-inferno-jimmy.html |date=March 8, 2012 |accessdate=March 9, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nTheir first few recordings were released on [[Buddah Records]], including \"Hold Back The Night\" which was a hit in the UK and on the Billboard R&B chart in 1973, before a re-release saw it climb the U.S. Hot 100 two years later.

During the ceremony, the original band members performed together for the first time in 25 years. Disco Inferno has also had a resurgence and has garnered new fans with the 2016 presidential political campaign of [[Bernie Sanders]] in the USA due to the song's refrain of ''burn, baby, burn'' (slightly altered to \"Bern, baby, Bern\").\n\nTwo versions of the group, with differing line-ups, currently tour the nostalgia circuit.<ref>[http://www.soultracks.com/trammps.htm Biography at Soultracks.com] - accessed February 2011</ref>\n\nOn March 8, 2012, lead singer Jimmy Ellis died at a nursing home in [[Rock Hill, South Carolina]] (where he was born on November 15, 1937), at the age of 74.

Went the Strings of My Heart]]\". The first disco track they released was \"Love Epidemic\" in 1973. However, they are best known for their [[21st Grammy Awards|Grammy]] winning song, \"[[Disco Inferno]]\", originally released in 1976, becoming a UK pop hit and US R&B hit.  After inclusion in the ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' [[soundtrack]], the song was re-released in 1978 and became a US pop hit.\n\n==History==\n===From early 1970s to the dissolution in the early 1990s===\nThe history of the Trammps grew from the 1960s group ''The Volcanos'', who later became ''The Moods''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> With a number of line-up changes by the early 1970s, the band membership included gospel-influenced lead singer Jimmy Ellis, drummer and singer (bass voice) [[Earl Young (drummer)|Earl Young]], with brothers Stanley and Harold 'Doc' Wade. Members of the Philadelphia recording band [[MFSB]] played with the group on records and on tour in the 1970s with singer Robert Upchurch joining later. The group was produced by the Philadelphia team of Ronnie Baker, Norman Harris and Young, all MFSB mainstays who played on the recording sessions and contributed songs.\n\nTheir debut [[record chart|chart]] entry came via an upbeat [[cover version]] of the standard \"[[Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart]]\", featuring Young's bass voice, which became a [[Top 40|Top 20]] US [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart [[hit record|hit]] in 1972.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"th120308\">{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Dys |work=[[The Herald (Rock Hill)|The Herald]] |location=[[Rock Hill, SC]] |title='Disco Inferno' singer Jimmy Ellis of Rock Hill dies at 74 |url=http://www.heraldonline.com/2012/03/08/3804499/singer-of-disco-inferno-jimmy.html |date=March 8, 2012 |accessdate=March 9, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nTheir first few recordings were released on [[Buddah Records]], including \"Hold Back The Night\" which was a hit in the UK and on the Billboard R&B chart in 1973, before a re-release saw it climb the U.S. Hot 100 two years later. Several R&B hits followed during a stay with Philadelphia International subsidiary, Golden Fleece (run by Baker-Harris-Young) before they signed to Atlantic Records. \n \nTheir [[single (music)|single]] \"[[Disco Inferno]]\" (1976), which was included on the [[Grammy Award]] winning ''[[Saturday Night Fever: The Original Movie Sound Track]]'' in 1977,<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-trammps-p5685/charts-awards/grammy-awards Allmusic.com / Grammy Awards]</ref> reached #11 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in May 1978.<ref name=\"Billboard Singles\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-trammps-p5685/charts-awards/billboard-singles |title=Charts & Awards / Billboard Singles|website=Allmusic.com |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"In a time when real soul groups, especially of the uptempo persuasion, have become as rare as [[snail darter]]s, the Trammps fill a gap.\"|source=\u2014 ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981)<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: T|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=T&bk=70|accessdate=March 16, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>|width=21%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}\n\nOther major hits included \"Hold Back the Night\" (1975) ([[UK Singles Chart|UK]] #5<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited \n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| page= 564}}</ref>) and \"That's Where the Happy People Go\" (1976).

The song was part-written by Ron Kersey, a producer-arranger and a member of MFSB, who also played with Trammps in the 1970s for a time. During the ceremony, the original band members performed together for the first time in 25 years. Disco Inferno has also had a resurgence and has garnered new fans with the 2016 presidential political campaign of [[Bernie Sanders]] in the USA due to the song's refrain of ''burn baby burn'' (slightly altered to Bern baby Bern).\n\nTwo versions of the group, with differing line-ups, currently tour the nostalgia circuit.<ref>[http://www.soultracks.com/trammps.htm Biography at Soultracks.com] - accessed February 2011</ref>\n\nOn March 8, 2012, lead singer Jimmy Ellis died at a nursing home in [[Rock Hill, South Carolina]] (where he was born on November 15, 1937) at age 74.
