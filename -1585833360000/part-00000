It has horizontal flowering stems of 5\u20137&nbsp;mm (0.2\u20130.3&nbsp;in) in diameter, flushed reddish, with some soft hairs that may be lost with age. The widely spaced leaves stand at right angles with the stem, lack a [[Petiole (botany)|stalk]] and hairs, lance-shaped with a pointy tip to long oval, sometimes with a heart-shaped foot, 2\u00bd\u20136&nbsp;cm (1\u20132.4&nbsp;in) long and \u00bd\u20131\u00bd cm (0.2\u20130.6&nbsp;in) wide, the tip bony or sometimes with two or three bony teeth.<ref name=Rourke />\n\nThe flower heads are usually individually set, low cone-shaped in the bud but becoming disc-shaped when the flowers open, 9\u201315&nbsp;cm (3.6\u20135&nbsp;in) in diameter on a [[Peduncle (botany)|stalk]] of 2\u20133&nbsp;cm (0.8\u20131.2&nbsp;in) long. The [[Receptacle (botany)|common base]] of the flowers in the same head has a broad cone-shape, 3\u20134&nbsp;cm (1.2\u20131.6&nbsp;in) high and about 4&nbsp;cm wide. The [[Bracts#Involucral bracts|bracts]] that subtend the flower heads are broadly oval to oval with a pointy tip, 10\u201315&nbsp;mm (0.4\u20130.6&nbsp;in) high and 4\u20137&nbsp;mm (0.16\u20130.28&nbsp;in) wide, with two papery wings in the lower half, hairless except for a regular line of straight hairs along the margin, standing out or slightly overlapping. The [[Bracteoles|bract]] subtending the individual flower is broadly oval, about 15&nbsp;mm (0.6&nbsp;in) long and 8&nbsp;mm (0.32&nbsp;in) broad, softly papery and woolly near the base and powdery hairy to hairless higher up, with a pointy tip. The [[Merosity|4-merous]] [[perianth]] is 4\u20134\u00bd cm (1.6\u20131.8&nbsp;in) long and pale pink in colour. The lower part, that remains merged when the flower is open, is about 7&nbsp;mm (0.28&nbsp;in) long, hairless or slightly powdery and somewhat flattened sideways. The middle part (or [[Petal#Shape and size|claws]]), are each about 1&nbsp;mm (0.04&nbsp;in) wide, thinly softly hairy, the one facing the edge of the head free, the other three remaining fused, all strongly curled back. The upper part (or [[Petal#Shape and size|limbs]]), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, are oval to lance-shaped, each about 3&nbsp;mm long and 1\u00bd mm, wide dull carmine to brownish in colour and slightly softly hairy. The four [[Stamen#Morphology and terminology|anthers]] are each almost without a filament attached to the limbs. From the centre of the perianth emerges a straight, slender, yellow [[Stigma (botany)#Style|style]] of approximately 5&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;in) long, initially slightly curved towards the centre of the head, but straightening with age. The thickened part at the tip of the style called [[pollen presenter]] is egg-shaped with a pointy tip, 1\u20131\u00bd mm (0.04-0.06&nbsp;in) long, the side facing the centre of the head oblique, with the groove that functions as the stigma across the very tip.

It has horizontal flowering stems of 5\u20137&nbsp;mm (0.2\u20130.3&nbsp;in) in diameter, flushed reddish, with some soft hairs that may be lost with age. The widely spaced leaves stand at right angles with the stem, lack a [[Petiole (botany)|stalk]] and hairs, lance-shaped with a pointy tip to long oval, sometimes with a heart-shaped foot, 2\u00bd\u20136&nbsp;cm (1\u20132.4&nbsp;in) long and \u00bd\u20131\u00bd cm (0.2\u20130.6&nbsp;in) wide, the tip bony or sometimes with two or three bony teeth.<ref name=Rourke />\n\nThe flower heads are usually individually set, low cone-shaped in the bud but becoming disc-shaped when the flowers open, 9\u201315&nbsp;cm (3.6\u20135&nbsp;in) in diameter on a [[Peduncle (botany)|stalk]] of 2\u20133&nbsp;cm (0.8\u20131.2&nbsp;in) long. The [[Receptacle (botany)|common base]] of the flowers in the same head has a broad cone-shape, 3\u20134&nbsp;cm (1.2\u20131.6&nbsp;in) high and about 4&nbsp;cm wide. The [[Bracts#Involucral bracts|bracts]] that subtend the flower heads are broadly oval to oval with a pointy tip, 10\u201315&nbsp;mm (0.4\u20130.6&nbsp;in) high and 4\u20137&nbsp;mm (0.16\u20130.28&nbsp;in) wide, with two papery wings in the lower half, hairless except for a regular line of straight hairs along the margin, standing out or slightly overlapping. The [[Bracteoles|bract]] subtending the individual flower is broadly oval, about 15&nbsp;mm (0.6&nbsp;in) long and 8&nbsp;mm (0.32&nbsp;in) broad, softly papery and woolly near the base and powdery hairy to hairless higher up, with a pointy tip. The [[Merosity|4-merous]] [[perianth]] is 4\u20134\u00bd cm (1.6\u20131.8&nbsp;in) long and pale pink in colour. The lower part, that remains merged when the flower is open, is about 7&nbsp;mm (0.28&nbsp;in) long, hairless or slightly powdery and somewhat flattened sideways. The middle part (or [[Petal#Shape and size|claws]]), are each about 1&nbsp;mm (0.04&nbsp;in) wide, thinly softly hairy, the one facing the edge of the head free, the other three remaining fused, all strongly curled back. The upper part (or [[Petal#Shape and size|limbs]]), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, are oval to lance-shaped, each about 3&nbsp;mm long and 1\u00bd mm, wide dull camine to brownish in colour and slightly softly hairy. The four [[Stamen#Morphology and terminology|anthers]] are each almost without a filament attached to the limbs. From the centre of the perianth emerges a straight, slender, yellow [[Stigma (botany)#Style|style]] of approximately 5&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;in) long, initially slightly curved towards the centre of the head, but straightening with age. The thickened part at the tip of the style called [[pollen presenter]] is egg-shaped with a pointy tip, 1\u20131\u00bd mm (0.04-0.06&nbsp;in) long, the side facing the centre of the head oblique, with the groove that functions as the stigma across the very tip.

The map in this article, taken from the official [[United States Census Bureau]] site, includes [[Clifton Forge, Virginia|Clifton Forge]] and [[Bedford, Virginia|Bedford]] as independent cities. This reflected the political reality at the time of the 2000 Census. However, both have since chosen to revert to town status.  In Virginia, cities are co-equal levels of government to counties, but towns are part of counties. For some counties, for statistical purposes, the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] combines any independent cities with the county that it was once part of (before the legislation creating independent cities took place in 1871).\n\nMany county seats are politically not a part of the counties they serve; under Virginia law, all municipalities incorporated as cities are [[independent city (United States)|independent cities]] and are not part of any county. Some of the cities in the [[Hampton Roads]] area ([[Virginia Beach]], [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]], [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], and [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]]) were formed from an entire county. These cities are no longer county seats, since the counties ceased to exist once the cities were completely formed, but are functionally equivalent to counties. Also in Virginia, a county seat may be an independent city surrounded by, but not part of, the county of which it is the administrative center; for example, [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax City]] is both the county seat of Fairfax County and is completely surrounded by [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] but the city is politically independent of the county.\n\nThere are 38 independent cities, which are considered [[county-equivalent]]s for census purposes.

These currently include Fairfax, Franklin, Richmond, and Roanoke. In the past they also included Norfolk and Alexandria, whose counties changed their names, ostensibly to end some of the confusion; as well as Bedford, where a city was surrounded by a county of the same name from 1968 until 2013, when the city reverted to town status. A city and county that share a name may be completely unrelated in geography. For example, Richmond County is nowhere near the City of Richmond, and Franklin County is even farther from the City of Franklin.\n\nMore Virginia counties are named for women than in any other state.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kane|first1=Joseph Nathan|last2=Aiken|first2=Charles Curry|title=The American Counties: Origins of County Names, Dates of Creation, and Population Data, 1950-2000|url=https://archive.org/details/americancounties0000kane|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5036-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/americancounties0000kane/page/11 11]}}</ref>\n\nVirginia's postal abbreviation is '''VA''' and its FIPS state code is '''51'''.\n\nList of the 95 [[County (United States)|counties]] in the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] of [[Virginia]] (links shown under '''FIPS County Code''' are for the U.S. Census Bureau Statistics Info Page for that county):\n\n==Clickable map==\n{{Virginia counties imagemap}}\n{{clear}}\n==List of counties==\n\n{{Countytabletop\n| region_width      = 150px\n| fips_ref          = <ref name=\"FIPS\">{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/enviro/html/codes/va.html |title=EPA County FIPS Code Listing |work=EPA.gov |accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref>\n| region_seat_width = 100px\n| region_seat_title = County seat\n| region_seat_ref   = <ref name=\"NACO\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Template.cfm?Section=Find_a_County&Template=/cffiles/counties/state.cfm&state.cfm&statecode=VA|title=NACo - Find a county|author=National Association of Counties|accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref><ref name=\"ComLocGovSeats\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/CommissiononLocalGovernment/PDFs/county.seats.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305013108/http://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/CommissiononLocalGovernment/PDFs/county.seats.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-03-05|title=County Seats|author=Virginia Commission on Local Government|accessdate=2017-05-01}}</ref>\n| data2_width       = 60px\n| data2_title       = {{abbr|Est.|Established}}\n| data2_ref         = <ref name=\"NACO\"/>\n| data3_width       = 150px\n| data3_title       = Origin\n| data3_ref         =\n| data4_width       = 150px\n| data4_unsortable  =\n| data4_title       = Etymology\n| data4_ref         =\n| population_ref    = <ref name=\"Census\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045218|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: United States|website=www.census.gov}}</ref>\n| area_ref          = <ref name=\"NACO\"/>\n}}\n{{Countyrow|N=51|Num=001| Name=Accomack| Seat=Accomac| Data2=1663 |  Data3=[[Accomac Shire]] was established in 1634 as one of the original eight [[shires of Virginia]].

The map in this article, taken from the official [[United States Census Bureau]] site, includes [[Clifton Forge, Virginia|Clifton Forge]] and [[Bedford, Virginia|Bedford]] as independent cities. This reflected the political reality at the time of the 2000 Census. However, both have since chosen to revert to town status.  In Virginia, cities are co-equal levels of government to counties, but towns are part of counties. For some counties, for statistical purposes, the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] combines any independent cities with the county that it was once part of (before the legislation creating independent cities took place in 1871).\n\nMany county seats are politically not a part of the counties they serve; under Virginia law, all municipalities incorporated as cities are [[independent city (United States)|independent cities]] and are not part of any county. Some of the cities in the [[Hampton Roads]] area ([[Virginia Beach]], [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]], [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], and [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]]) were formed from an entire county. These cities are no longer county seats, since the counties ceased to exist once the cities were completely formed, but are functionally equivalent to counties. Also in Virginia, a county seat may be an independent city surrounded by, but not part of, the county of which it is the administrative center; for example, [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax City]] is both the county seat of Fairfax County and is completely surrounded by [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] but the city is politically independent of the county.\n\nThere are 38 independent cities, which are considered [[county-equivalent]]s for census purposes.  Many [[List of towns in Virginia|towns]] are as large as cities, but are not [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] as cities and are situated within a parent [[county (United States)|county]] or counties.  Eight independent cities\u2014including [[Bedford, Virginia|Bedford]], which gave up its city charter in 2013 and became a town\u2014had 2010 populations of less than 10,000 with the smallest, [[Norton, Virginia|Norton]] having a population of only 3,958.<ref name=\"VaPop\">[http://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/CommissiononLocalGovernment/PDFs/Locality-Populations.pdf \"Population and Area of All Virginia Local Governments, 1790-2010\".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525022119/http://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/CommissiononLocalGovernment/PDFs/Locality-Populations.pdf |date=2017-05-25 }} Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development website. 19 April 2012.

These currently include Fairfax, Franklin, Richmond, and Roanoke. In the past they also included Norfolk and Alexandria, whose counties changed their names, ostensibly to end some of the confusion; as well as Bedford, where a city was surrounded by a county of the same name from 1968 until 2013, when the city reverted to town status. A city and county that share a name may be completely unrelated in geography. For example, Richmond County is nowhere near the City of Richmond, and Franklin County is even farther from the City of Franklin.\n\nMore Virginia counties are named for women than in any other state.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kane|first1=Joseph Nathan|last2=Aiken|first2=Charles Curry|title=The American Counties: Origins of County Names, Dates of Creation, and Population Data, 1950-2000|url=https://archive.org/details/americancounties0000kane|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5036-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/americancounties0000kane/page/11 11]}}</ref>\n\nVirginia's postal abbreviation is '''VA''' and its FIPS state code is '''51'''.\n\nList of the 95 [[County (United States)|counties]] in the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] of [[Virginia]] (links shown under '''FIPS County Code''' are for the U.S. Census Bureau Statistics Info Page for that county):\n\n==Clickable map==\n{{Virginia counties imagemap}}\n{{clear}}\n==List of counties==\n\n{{Countytabletop\n| region_width      = 150px\n| fips_ref          = <ref name=\"FIPS\">{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/enviro/html/codes/va.html |title=EPA County FIPS Code Listing |work=EPA.gov |accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref>\n| region_seat_width = 100px\n| region_seat_title = County seat\n| region_seat_ref   = <ref name=\"NACO\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Template.cfm?Section=Find_a_County&Template=/cffiles/counties/state.cfm&state.cfm&statecode=VA|title=NACo - Find a county|author=National Association of Counties|accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref><ref name=\"ComLocGovSeats\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/CommissiononLocalGovernment/PDFs/county.seats.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305013108/http://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/CommissiononLocalGovernment/PDFs/county.seats.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-03-05|title=County Seats|author=Virginia Commission on Local Government|accessdate=2017-05-01}}</ref>\n| data2_width       = 60px\n| data2_title       = {{abbr|Est.|Established}}\n| data2_ref         = <ref name=\"NACO\"/>\n| data3_width       = 150px\n| data3_title       = Origin\n| data3_ref         =\n| data4_width       = 150px\n| data4_unsortable  =\n| data4_title       = Etymology\n| data4_ref         =\n| population_ref    = <ref name=\"Census\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045218|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: United States|website=www.census.gov}}</ref>\n| area_ref          = <ref name=\"NACO\"/>\n}}\n{{Countyrow|N=51|Num=001| Name=Accomack| Seat=Accomac| Data2=1663 |  Data3=[[Accomac Shire]] was established in 1634 as one of the original eight [[shires of Virginia]].

{"title_page": "1928 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "The 1928 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was its 19th. It was a very busy season, with ten representative fixtures including matches against the touring [[England national rugby league team|England]] team. The senior club season featured over 110 matches through various competitions and did not finish until late October when suburban cricket competitions had already begun.\n\n[[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] won the Senior A Championship for the first time under the [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] name, though they had won it twice before as [[North Shore Albions]], prior to the merger with Sunnyside. [[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the Roope Rooster Trophy for the first time. This was their first major rugby league trophy and they also went on to defeat Devonport to win the Stormont Shield. [[Grafton Athletic rugby league team|Grafton]] won the Senior B Grade competition with an undefeated season, though they were beaten in the promotion relegation match with [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. [[Point Chevalier Pirates|Point Chevalier]] defeated [[Grafton Athletic rugby league team|Grafton]] in the Stallard Cup final which was the Senior B knockout competition. The season was notable for the number of teams which played sides from other areas. [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]], [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]], [[Parnell rugby league club|Parnell]], and the [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote and Birkenhead Ramblers]] all played sides from north Auckland and the [[Waikato]].\n\nAt the annual general meeting of [[Auckland Rugby League]] it was noted that out of the 28 playing days during the 1927 season thirteen of them were played in wet weather however crowds were still good and they were happy with the growth of the game.

During the season [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] opened a new field at Stafford Park which is still in existence adjacent to State Highway 1 just north of the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]]. Devonport also had a deputation present at the [[Devonport Borough Council]] meeting on 10 May to ask about the shortage of grounds in the area. The club asked for permission to use some of the spare cricket grounds for matches. The Mayor, Mr. E. Aldridge said there would be a ground available at Stanley Bay.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Devonport Borough/Shortage of Sports Areas\n| page = 12\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXV, Issue 19943\n| date = 1928-05-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280511.2.133\n| accessdate = 2019-10-01}}</ref>\n\n==Rule Changes==\nAfter Round 5 the issue of time keeping in matches at [[Carlaw Park]] was raised at the weekly Management Committee meeting. The bell had been rung in the match between [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] and Devonport at [[Carlaw Park]] before the ball was dead which was against previously arranged rules. Agreement could not be reached on whether the timekeeper or referee should be responsible for calling time.

The round was dedicated to Richard Stack (commonly known as Dick Stack) of the [[Newton Rangers]] who had suffered a broken leg in the Stormont Shield final the previous season and the injury was so bad [[Auckland Hospital]] staff were forced to amputate it. This mean that he was unable to continue in his career and so the league fundraised for him to start him in his own business. \u00a3500 was taken at the gates for him. The day also featured a program of boxing matches with the prizes donated back to Stack. After all the accounts were balanced it was worked out that the fund for Stack totalled \u00a3610 12/3.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Stack Benefit/Sum of \u00a3610 for League Football Player/A Pleasing Effort\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LIX, Issue 152\n| date = 1928-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19280629.2.15\n| accessdate = 2019-09-10}}</ref>\n\nRound 1 saw the newly promoted [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] upset [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]].

This was due to players having difficulty getting to the ground on time as they often worked on Saturdays and had to travel from the outer suburbs. A recent example had been the [[Newton Rangers]] v [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] match where several [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] players had arrived late and the match was so late kicking off that the second half lasted only 25 minutes instead of 40.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Stack Benefit Fund/Next Saturday\u2019s Attraction/Devonport and Richmond\n| page = 16\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXV, Issue 19947\n| date = 1928-05-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280516.2.171.2\n| accessdate = 2019-10-01}}</ref>\n\nThe Round 6 match between [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] was played on the Kings Birthday holiday as part of the celebrations.\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | 1928 First Grade Results\n|-\n|\n!

It was a very busy season, with ten representative fixtures including matches against the touring [[England national rugby league team|England]] team. The senior club season featured over 110 matches through various competitions and did not finish until late October when suburban cricket competitions had already begun.\n\n[[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] won the Senior A Championship for the first time under the [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] name, though they had won it twice before as [[North Shore Albions]], prior to the merger with Sunnyside. [[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the Roope Rooster Trophy for the first time. This was their first major rugby league trophy and they also went on to defeat Devonport to win the Stormont Shield. [[Grafton Athletic rugby league team|Grafton]] won the Senior B Grade competition with an undefeated season, though they were beaten in the promotion relegation match with [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. [[Point Chevalier Pirates|Point Chevalier]] defeated [[Grafton Athletic rugby league team|Grafton]] in the Stallard Cup final which was the Senior B knockout competition. The season was notable for the number of teams which played sides from other areas. [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]], [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]], [[Parnell rugby league club|Parnell]], and the [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote and Birkenhead Ramblers]] all played sides from north Auckland and the [[Waikato]].\n\nAt the annual general meeting of [[Auckland Rugby League]] it was noted that out of the 28 playing days during the 1927 season thirteen of them were played in wet weather however crowds were still good and they were happy with the growth of the game. It was also planned for further developments at [[Carlaw Park]] consisting of \u201cconveniences for ladies\u2026extra accommodation\u2026 for players, and three more dressing rooms\u201d at a cost of \u00a360. There was a lengthy discussion about [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie's]] application to join the A Grade. They had won the B Grade competition and defeated the last placed Grafton from A Grade.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Governing Body/Report on the Past Season\n| page = 17\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXV, Issue 19907\n| date = 1928-03-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280328.2.154\n| accessdate = 2019-09-29}}</ref> The annual general meeting was held at the [[Auckland Chamber of Commerce]] on Swanson Street.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Activities/Mew Officers Elected/Plans for Coming Season\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXV, Issue 19920\n| date = 1928-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280413.2.165.5\n| accessdate = 2019-09-30}}</ref>\n\nThe Management Committee announced at the midway mark of the senior club season that the Thistle Cup would be awarded to the A or B grade team that had scored the most points in the second round of competition.

During the season [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] opened a new field at Stafford Park which is still in existence adjacent to State Highway 1 just north of the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]]. Devonport also had a deputation present at the [[Devonport Borough Council]] meeting on 10 May to ask about the shortage of grounds in the area. The club asked for permission to use some of the spare cricket grounds for matches. The Mayor, Mr. E. Aldridge said there would be a ground available at Stanley Bay.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Devonport Borough/Shortage of Sports Areas\n| page = 12\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXV, Issue 19943\n| date = 1928-05-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280511.2.133\n| accessdate = 2019-10-01}}</ref>\n\n==Rule Changes==\nAfter Round 5 the issue of time keeping in matches at [[Carlaw Park]] was raised at the weekly Management Committee meeting. The bell had been rung in the match between [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] and Devonport at [[Carlaw Park]] before the ball was dead which was against previously arranged rules. Agreement could not be reached on whether the timekeeper or referee should be responsible for calling time. In the end it was decided that official timekeepers should attend the Referees\u2019 Association meeting for instructions.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Management Committee/The Calling of Time/Proposed Match for June 4\n| page = 13\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LIX, Issue 121\n| date = 1928-05-24\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19280524.2.126.3\n| accessdate = 2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nIt was noted that the dead ball area on both fields at [[Carlaw Park]] had been reduced from 12 yards to 8yards in accordance with the laws of Rugby League.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Senior Matches/Individual Scorers\u2019 List/Taylor Leads the Way\n| page = 16\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXV, Issue 19971\n| date = 1928-06-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280613.2.177.2\n| accessdate = 2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nA rule change came into effect during the season after the annual meeting of the [[Rugby Football League|English Rugby League]].

The round was dedicated to Richard Stack (commonly known as Dick Stack) of the [[Newton Rangers]] who had suffered a broken leg in the Stormont Shield final the previous season and the injury was so bad [[Auckland Hospital]] staff were forced to amputate it. This mean that he was unable to continue in his career and so the league fundraised for him to start him in his own business. \u00a3500 was taken at the gates for him. The day also featured a program of boxing matches with the prizes donated back to Stack. After all the accounts were balanced it was worked out that the fund for Stack totalled \u00a3610 12/3.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Stack Benefit/Sum of \u00a3610 for League Football Player/A Pleasing Effort\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LIX, Issue 152\n| date = 1928-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19280629.2.15\n| accessdate = 2019-09-10}}</ref>\n\nRound 1 saw the newly promoted [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] upset [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]]. The season was ceremonially kicked off by Miss Peggy Rhodes, daughter of George Rhodes, the chairman of [[Auckland Rugby League]] Management Committee.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the first ground of Senior A Grade matches ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' published for the first time the individual points tallies of all the point scorers. This was the first time this had been done. Taylor of [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] led the standings with 46 points, L. Scott of [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] had 33, while [[Craddock Dufty|Dufty]] of [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] was third with 26 points.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Senior Matches/Individual Scorers\u2019 List/Taylor Leads the Way\n| page = 16\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXV, Issue 19971\n| date = 1928-06-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280613.2.177.2\n| accessdate = 2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nIt was decided by [[Auckland Rugby League]] after the 3rd round that they would no longer play curtain-raiser matches by Senior A Grade teams at 1:30pm. This was due to players having difficulty getting to the ground on time as they often worked on Saturdays and had to travel from the outer suburbs. A recent example had been the [[Newton Rangers]] v [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] match where several [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] players had arrived late and the match was so late kicking off that the second half lasted only 25 minutes instead of 40.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Stack Benefit Fund/Next Saturday\u2019s Attraction/Devonport and Richmond\n| page = 16\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXV, Issue 19947\n| date = 1928-05-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280516.2.171.2\n| accessdate = 2019-10-01}}</ref>\n\nThe Round 6 match between [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] was played on the Kings Birthday holiday as part of the celebrations.\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | 1928 First Grade Results\n|-\n|\n!

[[Theodor Capidan]] went further, claiming that the structure of Balkan languages could be reduced to a standard language. Many of the earliest reports on this theory were in [[German language|German]], hence the term \"Balkansprachbund\" is often used as well.\n\n==Languages==\nThe languages that share these similarities belong to five distinct branches of the Indo-European languages:\n* [[Albanian language|Albanian]]\n* [[Hellenic languages|Hellenic]] ([[Greek language|Greek]])\n* [[Romance languages|Romance]] ([[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romance]] and [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]])\n* [[Balkan Slavic]] ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and the [[Prizren-Timok dialect]] of Serbian.)\n* [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] ([[Romani language|Romani]])\n\nThe Finnish linguist [[Jouko Lindstedt]] computed in 2000 a \"Balkanization factor\" which gives each Balkan language a score proportional with the number of features shared in the Balkan language area.<ref name=\"langcontact\">{{cite book |last=Lindstedt |first=J. |year=2000 |chapter=Linguistic Balkanization: Contact-induced change by mutual reinforcement |pages=231\u2013246 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqQgBVXp_H4C |editor=D.G.

The grammatical features shared (especially regarding the tense system) were most likely borrowed from Greek.\n\n==Origins==\nThe source of these features as well as the directions have long been debated, and various theories were suggested.\n\n===Thracian, Illyrian or Dacian and Albanian as successive language===\nSince most of these features cannot be found in languages related to those that belong to the language area (such as other Slavic or Romance languages),{{Dubious|date=March 2011}} early researchers, including Kopitar, believed they must have been inherited from the [[Paleo-Balkan languages]] (e.g. [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]], [[Thracian language|Thracian]] and [[Dacian language|Dacian]]) which formed the [[Substratum|substrate]] for modern Balkan languages.  But since very little is known about Paleo-Balkan languages, it cannot be determined whether the features were present. The strongest candidate for a shared Paleo-Balkan feature is the postposed article. The Albanian language originates from one of these languages.\n\n===Greek===\nAnother theory, advanced by Kristian Sandfeld in 1930, was that these features were an entirely Greek influence, under the presumption that since Greece \"always had a superior civilization compared to its neighbours\", Greek could not have borrowed its linguistic features from them. However, no ancient dialects of Greek possessed Balkanisms, so that the features shared with other regional languages appear to be post-classical innovations. Also, Greek appears to be only peripheral to the Balkan language area, lacking some important features, such as the postposed article. Nevertheless, several of the features that Greek does share with the other languages (loss of dative, replacement of infinitive by subjunctive constructions, object clitics, formation of future with auxiliary verb \"to want\") probably originated in [[Medieval Greek]] and spread to the other languages through Byzantine influence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Horrocks|first1=Geoffrey|title=Greek: A History of the Language and its Speakers|date=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester|pages=227\u2013229|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n===Latin and Romance===\nThe Roman Empire ruled all the Balkans, and [[Common Romanian|local variation of Latin]] may have left its mark on all languages there, which were later the substrate to Slavic newcomers. This was proposed by [[Georg Solta]]. The weak point of this theory is that other Romance languages have few of the features, and there is no proof that the Balkan Romans were isolated for enough time to develop them. An argument for this would be the structural borrowings or \"linguistic [[calque]]s\" into Macedonian from Aromanian, which could be explained by Aromanian being a substrate of Macedonian, but this still does not explain the origin of these innovations in Aromanian. The analytic perfect with the auxiliary verb \"to have\" (which some Balkan languages share with Western European languages), is the only feature whose origin can fairly safely be traced to Latin.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Multiple sources===\nThe most commonly accepted theory, advanced by Polish scholar Zbigniew Go\u0142\u0105b, is that the innovations came from different sources and the languages influenced each other: some features can be traced from Latin, Slavic, or Greek languages, whereas others, particularly features that are shared only by Romanian, Albanian, Macedonian and Bulgarian, could be explained by the substratum kept after Romanization (in the case of Romanian) or Slavicization (in the case of Bulgarian). Albanian was influenced by both Latin and Slavic, but it kept many of its original characteristics.\n\nSeveral arguments favour this theory. First, throughout the turbulent [[history of the Balkans]], many groups of people moved to another place, inhabited by people of another ethnicity. These small groups were usually assimilated quickly and sometimes left marks in the new language they acquired. Second, the use of more than one language was common in the Balkans before the modern age, and a [[Drift (linguistics)|drift]] in one language would quickly spread to other languages.  Third, the dialects that have the most \"balkanisms\" are those in regions where people had contact with people of many other languages.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Grammatical features===\n\n====Case system====\nThe number of cases is reduced, several cases being replaced with prepositions, the only exception being Serbo-Croatian. In [[Bulgarian grammar|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian grammar|Macedonian]], on the other hand, this development has actually led to the loss of all cases except the [[vocative case|vocative]].\n\nA common case system of a Balkan language is:\n\n* [[Nominative case|Nominative]]\n* [[Accusative case|Accusative]]\n* [[Dative case|Dative]] / [[Genitive case|Genitive]] ([[Syncretism (linguistics)|merged]])\n* [[Vocative case|Vocative]]\n\n=====Syncretism of genitive and dative=====\nIn the Balkan languages, the [[genitive case|genitive]] and [[dative case|dative]] cases (or corresponding prepositional constructions) undergo [[syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]].\n\n''Example:''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This feature is present to varying degrees in each language.  Decategoralization is less advanced in fossilized literary Romanian ''{{lang|ro|voi}}'' and in Serbo-Croatian ''{{lang|sh|\u0107u, \u0107e\u0161, \u0107e}}'', where the future marker is still an inflected auxiliary. In modern Greek, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Albanian, Aromanian, and spoken Romanian, decategoralization and erosion have given rise to an uninflected tense form, where the frozen third-person singular of the verb has turned into an invariable particle followed by the main verb inflected for person (compare Rom 1.sg. ''{{lang|ro|voi}}'', 2.sg. ''{{lang|ro|vei}}'', 3.sg. ''{{lang|ro|va}}'' > invariable ''{{lang|ro|va}}'' > mod. ''{{lang|ro|o}}'').<ref>Bernd Heine & Tania Kuteva, ''Language Contact and Grammatical Change'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005).</ref> Certain [[Torlakian dialect]]s also have an invariant future tense marker in the form of the proclitic third-person-singular present form of the verb 'to want': ''{{lang|sh|\u0107e vidim}}'' ({{lang|sh|\u045b\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043c}}) 'I will see', ''{{lang|sh|\u0107e vidi\u0161}}'' ({{lang|sh|\u045b\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0448}}) \"you will see\", ''{{lang|sh|\u0107e vidi}}'' ({{lang|sh|\u045b\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438}}) 'he/she/it will see'.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" valign=top\n!

A somewhat less typical case of this is Greek, where the verb \"to have\" is followed by the so-called {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ad\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf}} ('invariant form', historically the aorist infinitive): {{lang|el|\u03ad\u03c7\u03c9 \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b8\u03b5\u03af}}. However, a completely different construction is used in Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian, which have inherited from Common Slavic an analytic perfect formed with the verb \"to be\" and the past ''active'' participle: {{lang|bg|\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0449\u0430\u043b \u0441\u044a\u043c}}, ''{{lang|bg-Latn|obe\u0161tal s\u01cem}}'' (Bul.) / {{lang|sr|\u043e\u0431\u0435\u045b\u0430\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c}}, ''{{lang|sr|obe\u0107ao sam}}'' (Ser.) - \"I have promised\" (lit. \"I am having-promised\"). On the other hand, Macedonian, the third Slavic language in the sprachbund, is like Romanian and Albanian in that it uses quite typical Balkan constructions consisting of the verb ''to have'' and a past passive participle ({{lang|mk|\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e}}, ''{{lang|mk-Latn|imam veteno}}'' = \"I have promised\"). Macedonian also has a perfect formed with the verb \"to be\", like Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian.\n\n=====Renarrative mood=====\nThe so-called [[Inferential mood#Renarrative in the Balkan languages|renarrative mood]] is another shared feature of the Balkan languages, including Turkish. It is used for statements that are not based on direct observation or common knowledge, but repeat what was reported by others. For example, \u041f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0442 '''\u0431\u0438\u043b''' \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d in Macedonian means \"The road was closed (or so I heard)\". A speaker who uses the [[indicative mood]] instead and states \"\u041f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0442 '''\u0431\u0435\u0448\u0435''' \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\" implies thereby that they personally witnessed the road's closure.\n\n=====Avoidance or loss of infinitive=====\nThe use of the infinitive (common in other languages related to some of the Balkan languages, such as Romance and Slavic) is generally replaced with subjunctive constructions, following early Greek innovation.\n\n* in Bulgarian, Macedonian and Tosk Albanian, the loss of the infinitive is complete\n* in [[Demotic Greek|demotic]] (vernacular) Greek, the loss of the infinitive was complete, whereas in literary Greek (''[[Katharevousa]]'', abolished in 1976) it was not; the natural fusion of the vernacular with ''Katharevousa'' resulted in the creation of the contemporary common Greek (Modern Standard Greek), where the infinitive, when used, is principally used as noun (e.g. {{lang|el|\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}} \"speaking, fluency, eloquence\", {{lang|el|\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}} \"writing\", {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9}} \"being\", etc.) deriving directly from the ancient Greek infinitive formation. But its substitution by the subjunctive form when the infinitive would be used as a verb is complete. Most of the times, the subjunctive form substitutes the infinitive also in the cases when it would be used as a noun (e.g. {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03bf \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c2}} / {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03bf \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c2}} \"to go, the act of going\", {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03bf \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2}} / {{lang|el|\u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2}} \"to see/be seeing, the act of seeing\" instead of the infinitive \"{{lang|el|\u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}}\", etc.)\n* in Aromanian and Southern Serbo-Croatian dialects, it is almost complete\n* in Gheg Albanian and Megleno-Romanian, it is used only in a limited number of expressions\n* in standard Romanian (prepositional phrase: ''{{lang|ro|a}}'' + verb stem) and Serbo-Croatian, the infinitive shares many of its functions with the subjunctive. In these two languages, the infinitive will always be found in dictionaries and language textbooks. However, in Romanian, the inherited infinitive form (''{{lang|ro|-are}}'', ''{{lang|ro|-ere}}'', and ''{{lang|ro|-ire}}'') is now used only as a verbal noun.\n* Turkish as spoken in [[Sliven]] and [[Shumen|\u0160umen]] has also almost completely lost the infinitive, but not verbal nouns using the same grammatical form. This is clearly due to the influence of the Balkan sprachbund.\n\nFor example, \"I want to write\" in several Balkan languages:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Language\n! Example\n!

This can be found in Romanian, Greek, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Albanian.  In Albanian and Macedonian, this feature shows fully grammaticalized structures and is obligatory with indirect objects and to some extent with definite direct objects; in Bulgarian, however, it is optional and therefore based on discourse.  In Greek, the construction contrasts with the clitic-less construction and marks the cross-referenced object as a topic. Southwest Macedonia appears to be the location of innovation.{{Dubious|Dubious statement in \"Clitic pronouns\" section|date=April 2020}}\n\nFor example, \"I see George\" in Balkan languages:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Language\n!Example\n|-\n| Albanian\n|\"'''E''' shoh Gjergjin\"\n|-\n|Aromanian\n|\"'''U-''' ved Yioryi\"\n|-\n|Bulgarian\n|\"\u0413\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c '''\u0433\u043e''' \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438.\"\n|-\n|Macedonian\n|\"'''\u0413o''' \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0403\u043e\u0440\u0453\u0438.\"\n|-\n|Greek\n|\"'''\u03a4\u03bf\u03bd''' \u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u0393\u03b9\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\"\n|-\n| Romanian\n| \"'''\u00cel''' v\u0103d pe Gheorghe.\"\n|}\n\nNote: The neutral case in normal ([[subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]]) word order is without a clitic: \"\u0413\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438.\" However, the form with an additional clitic pronoun is also perfectly normal and can be used for emphasis: \"\u0413\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043e \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438.\" And the clitic is obligatory in the case of a topicalized object (with OVS-word order), which serves also as the common colloquial equivalent of a passive construction. \"\u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438 \u0433\u043e \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c.\"\n\n=====Adjectives=====\nThe replacement of synthetic adjectival comparative forms with analytic ones by means of preposed markers is common.  These markers are:\n*Bulgarian: ''\u043f\u043e-''\n* Macedonian: ''\u043f\u043e'' (prepended)\n*Albanian:  ''m\u00eb''\n*Romanian:  ''mai''\n*Modern Greek:  ''\u03c0\u03b9\u03bf'' (pi\u00f3)\n*Aromanian: ''(ca)ma''\n\nMacedonian and Modern Greek have retained some of the earlier synthetic forms. In Bulgarian and Macedonian these have become proper adjectives in their own right without the possibility of [further] comparison. This is more evident in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: ''\u0432\u0438\u0448'' = \"higher, superior\", ''\u043d\u0438\u0436'' = \"lower, inferior\".

Bul. Mac.) \"-ovo\" \"-ica\" that can be found in Albanian, Greek and Romanian.\n\n===Vocabulary===\n\n====Loanwords====\nSeveral hundred words are common to the Balkan union languages; the origin of most of them is either [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] or [[Turkish language|Turkish]], as the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] and later the [[Ottoman Empire]] directly controlled the territory throughout most of its history, strongly influencing its culture and economics.\n\nAlbanian, Aromanian, Bulgarian, Greek, Romanian, Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian also share a large number of words of various origins:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Several features are found across these languages though not all apply to every single language. The languages in question may belong to various separate branches of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] (such as [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Hellenic languages|Greek]], [[Romance languages|Romance]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]) or even outside of Indo-European (such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]]). Some of the languages use these features for their standard language (i.e. those whose homeland lies almost entirely within the region) whilst other populations to whom the land is not a cultural pivot (as they have wider communities outside of it) may still adopt the features for their local register.\n\nWhile some of these languages may share little vocabulary, their grammars have very extensive similarities; for example they have similar case systems, in those that have preserved [[grammatical case]]  and [[verb conjugation]] systems and have all become more [[Analytic language|analytic]], although to differing degrees.

[[Theodor Capidan]] went further, claiming that the structure of Balkan languages could be reduced to a standard language. Many of the earliest reports on this theory were in [[German language|German]], hence the term \"Balkansprachbund\" is often used as well.\n\n==Languages==\nThe languages that share these similarities belong to five distinct branches of the Indo-European languages:\n* [[Albanian language|Albanian]]\n* [[Hellenic languages|Hellenic]] ([[Greek language|Greek]])\n* [[Romance languages|Romance]] ([[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romance]] and [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]])\n* [[Balkan Slavic]] ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and the [[Prizren-Timok dialect]] of Serbian.)\n* [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] ([[Romani language|Romani]])\n\nThe Finnish linguist [[Jouko Lindstedt]] computed in 2000 a \"Balkanization factor\" which gives each Balkan language a score proportional with the number of features shared in the Balkan language area.<ref name=\"langcontact\">{{cite book |last=Lindstedt |first=J. |year=2000 |chapter=Linguistic Balkanization: Contact-induced change by mutual reinforcement |pages=231\u2013246 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqQgBVXp_H4C |editor=D.G.

Score\n|-\n| Balkan Slavic\n| 11.5\n|-\n| Albanian\n| 10.5\n|-\n| Greek, Balkan Romance\n| 9.5\n|-\n| [[Balkan Romani]]\n| 7.5\n|}\n\nAnother language that may have been influenced by the Balkan language union is the [[Judaeo-Spanish]] variant that used to be spoken by [[Sephardi Jews]] living in the Balkans. The grammatical features shared (especially regarding the tense system) were most likely borrowed from Greek.\n\n==Origins==\nThe source of these features as well as the directions have long been debated, and various theories were suggested.\n\n===Thracian, Illyrian or Dacian and Albanian as successive language===\nSince most of these features cannot be found in languages related to those that belong to the language area (such as other Slavic or Romance languages),{{Dubious|date=March 2011}} early researchers, including Kopitar, believed they must have been inherited from the [[Paleo-Balkan languages]] (e.g. [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]], [[Thracian language|Thracian]] and [[Dacian language|Dacian]]) which formed the [[Substratum|substrate]] for modern Balkan languages.  But since very little is known about Paleo-Balkan languages, it cannot be determined whether the features were present. The strongest candidate for a shared Paleo-Balkan feature is the postposed article. The Albanian language originates from one of these languages.\n\n===Greek===\nAnother theory, advanced by Kristian Sandfeld in 1930, was that these features were an entirely Greek influence, under the presumption that since Greece \"always had a superior civilization compared to its neighbours\", Greek could not have borrowed its linguistic features from them. However, no ancient dialects of Greek possessed Balkanisms, so that the features shared with other regional languages appear to be post-classical innovations. Also, Greek appears to be only peripheral to the Balkan language area, lacking some important features, such as the postposed article. Nevertheless, several of the features that Greek does share with the other languages (loss of dative, replacement of infinitive by subjunctive constructions, object clitics, formation of future with auxiliary verb \"to want\") probably originated in [[Medieval Greek]] and spread to the other languages through Byzantine influence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Horrocks|first1=Geoffrey|title=Greek: A History of the Language and its Speakers|date=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester|pages=227\u2013229|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n===Latin and Romance===\nThe Roman Empire ruled all the Balkans, and [[Common Romanian|local variation of Latin]] may have left its mark on all languages there, which were later the substrate to Slavic newcomers. This was proposed by [[Georg Solta]]. The weak point of this theory is that other Romance languages have few of the features, and there is no proof that the Balkan Romans were isolated for enough time to develop them. An argument for this would be the structural borrowings or \"linguistic [[calque]]s\" into Macedonian from Aromanian, which could be explained by Aromanian being a substrate of Macedonian, but this still does not explain the origin of these innovations in Aromanian. The analytic perfect with the auxiliary verb \"to have\" (which some Balkan languages share with Western European languages), is the only feature whose origin can fairly safely be traced to Latin.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Multiple sources===\nThe most commonly accepted theory, advanced by Polish scholar Zbigniew Go\u0142\u0105b, is that the innovations came from different sources and the languages influenced each other: some features can be traced from Latin, Slavic, or Greek languages, whereas others, particularly features that are shared only by Romanian, Albanian, Macedonian and Bulgarian, could be explained by the substratum kept after Romanization (in the case of Romanian) or Slavicization (in the case of Bulgarian). Albanian was influenced by both Latin and Slavic, but it kept many of its original characteristics.\n\nSeveral arguments favour this theory. First, throughout the turbulent [[history of the Balkans]], many groups of people moved to another place, inhabited by people of another ethnicity. These small groups were usually assimilated quickly and sometimes left marks in the new language they acquired. Second, the use of more than one language was common in the Balkans before the modern age, and a [[Drift (linguistics)|drift]] in one language would quickly spread to other languages.  Third, the dialects that have the most \"balkanisms\" are those in regions where people had contact with people of many other languages.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Grammatical features===\n\n====Case system====\nThe number of cases is reduced, several cases being replaced with prepositions, the only exception being Serbo-Croatian. In [[Bulgarian grammar|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian grammar|Macedonian]], on the other hand, this development has actually led to the loss of all cases except the [[vocative case|vocative]].\n\nA common case system of a Balkan language is:\n\n* [[Nominative case|Nominative]]\n* [[Accusative case|Accusative]]\n* [[Dative case|Dative]] / [[Genitive case|Genitive]] ([[Syncretism (linguistics)|merged]])\n* [[Vocative case|Vocative]]\n\n=====Syncretism of genitive and dative=====\nIn the Balkan languages, the [[genitive case|genitive]] and [[dative case|dative]] cases (or corresponding prepositional constructions) undergo [[syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]].\n\n''Example:''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This feature is present to varying degrees in each language.  Decategoralization is less advanced in fossilized literary Romanian ''{{lang|ro|voi}}'' and in Serbo-Croatian ''{{lang|sh|\u0107u, \u0107e\u0161, \u0107e}}'', where the future marker is still an inflected auxiliary. In modern Greek, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Albanian, Aromanian, and spoken Romanian, decategoralization and erosion have given rise to an uninflected tense form, where the frozen third-person singular of the verb has turned into an invariable particle followed by the main verb inflected for person (compare Rom 1.sg. ''{{lang|ro|voi}}'', 2.sg. ''{{lang|ro|vei}}'', 3.sg. ''{{lang|ro|va}}'' > invariable ''{{lang|ro|va}}'' > mod.

Unlike the avoidance of the infinitive, which had already come to encompass all Romani varieties before many of them were brought out of the Balkans into the rest of Europe, the formation of the future tense with a devolitive particle is apparently a later development, since it is only seen in those dialect groups that have not left the Balkans.</ref>\n| ''{{lang|rom|ka}}'' (inv.) + subjunctive\n| ''{{lang|rom|Ka dikhav}}''\n|}\n\n=====Analytic perfect tense=====\nThe analytic perfect tense is formed in the Balkan languages with the verb \"to have\" and, usually, a past passive participle, similarly to the construction found in Germanic and other Romance languages: e.g. Romanian ''{{lang|ro|am promis}}'' \"I have promised\", Albanian ''{{lang|sq|kam premtuar}}'' \"I have promised\". A somewhat less typical case of this is Greek, where the verb \"to have\" is followed by the so-called {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ad\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf}} ('invariant form', historically the aorist infinitive): {{lang|el|\u03ad\u03c7\u03c9 \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b8\u03b5\u03af}}. However, a completely different construction is used in Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian, which have inherited from Common Slavic an analytic perfect formed with the verb \"to be\" and the past ''active'' participle: {{lang|bg|\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0449\u0430\u043b \u0441\u044a\u043c}}, ''{{lang|bg-Latn|obe\u0161tal s\u01cem}}'' (Bul.) / {{lang|sr|\u043e\u0431\u0435\u045b\u0430\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c}}, ''{{lang|sr|obe\u0107ao sam}}'' (Ser.) - \"I have promised\" (lit. \"I am having-promised\"). On the other hand, Macedonian, the third Slavic language in the sprachbund, is like Romanian and Albanian in that it uses quite typical Balkan constructions consisting of the verb ''to have'' and a past passive participle ({{lang|mk|\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e}}, ''{{lang|mk-Latn|imam veteno}}'' = \"I have promised\"). Macedonian also has a perfect formed with the verb \"to be\", like Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian.\n\n=====Renarrative mood=====\nThe so-called [[Inferential mood#Renarrative in the Balkan languages|renarrative mood]] is another shared feature of the Balkan languages, including Turkish. It is used for statements that are not based on direct observation or common knowledge, but repeat what was reported by others. For example, \u041f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0442 '''\u0431\u0438\u043b''' \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d in Macedonian means \"The road was closed (or so I heard)\". A speaker who uses the [[indicative mood]] instead and states \"\u041f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0442 '''\u0431\u0435\u0448\u0435''' \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\" implies thereby that they personally witnessed the road's closure.\n\n=====Avoidance or loss of infinitive=====\nThe use of the infinitive (common in other languages related to some of the Balkan languages, such as Romance and Slavic) is generally replaced with subjunctive constructions, following early Greek innovation.\n\n* in Bulgarian, Macedonian and Tosk Albanian, the loss of the infinitive is complete\n* in [[Demotic Greek|demotic]] (vernacular) Greek, the loss of the infinitive was complete, whereas in literary Greek (''[[Katharevousa]]'', abolished in 1976) it was not; the natural fusion of the vernacular with ''Katharevousa'' resulted in the creation of the contemporary common Greek (Modern Standard Greek), where the infinitive, when used, is principally used as noun (e.g. {{lang|el|\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}} \"speaking, fluency, eloquence\", {{lang|el|\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}} \"writing\", {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9}} \"being\", etc.) deriving directly from the ancient Greek infinitive formation. But its substitution by the subjunctive form when the infinitive would be used as a verb is complete. Most of the times, the subjunctive form substitutes the infinitive also in the cases when it would be used as a noun (e.g. {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03bf \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c2}} / {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03bf \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c2}} \"to go, the act of going\", {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03bf \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2}} / {{lang|el|\u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2}} \"to see/be seeing, the act of seeing\" instead of the infinitive \"{{lang|el|\u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}}\", etc.)\n* in Aromanian and Southern Serbo-Croatian dialects, it is almost complete\n* in Gheg Albanian and Megleno-Romanian, it is used only in a limited number of expressions\n* in standard Romanian (prepositional phrase: ''{{lang|ro|a}}'' + verb stem) and Serbo-Croatian, the infinitive shares many of its functions with the subjunctive. In these two languages, the infinitive will always be found in dictionaries and language textbooks. However, in Romanian, the inherited infinitive form (''{{lang|ro|-are}}'', ''{{lang|ro|-ere}}'', and ''{{lang|ro|-ire}}'') is now used only as a verbal noun.\n* Turkish as spoken in [[Sliven]] and [[Shumen|\u0160umen]] has also almost completely lost the infinitive, but not verbal nouns using the same grammatical form. This is clearly due to the influence of the Balkan sprachbund.\n\nFor example, \"I want to write\" in several Balkan languages:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Language\n! Example\n!

Some varieties outside the Balkans have been influenced by non-Balkan languages and have developed new infinitives by generalizing one of the finite forms (e.g. Slovak Romani varieties may express \"I want to write\" as ''{{lang|rom|kamav '''te irinel/pisinel'''}}'' \u2014 generalized third person singular \u2014 or ''{{lang|rom|kamav '''te irinen/pisinen'''}}'' \u2014 generalized third person plural).\n|}\nBut here is an example of a relict form, preserved in Bulgarian:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This can be found in Romanian, Greek, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Albanian.  In Albanian and Macedonian, this feature shows fully grammaticalized structures and is obligatory with indirect objects and to some extent with definite direct objects; in Bulgarian, however, it is optional and therefore based on discourse.  In Greek, the construction contrasts with the clitic-less construction and marks the cross-referenced object as a topic. Southwest Macedonia appears to be the location of innovation.{{Dubious|Dubious statement in \"Clitic pronouns\" section|date=April 2020}}\n\nFor example, \"I see George\" in Balkan languages:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Language\n!Example\n|-\n| Albanian\n|\"'''E''' shoh Gjergjin\"\n|-\n|Aromanian\n|\"'''U-''' ved Yioryi\"\n|-\n|Bulgarian\n|\"\u0413\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c '''\u0433\u043e''' \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438.\"\n|-\n|Macedonian\n|\"'''\u0413o''' \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0403\u043e\u0440\u0453\u0438.\"\n|-\n|Greek\n|\"'''\u03a4\u03bf\u03bd''' \u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u0393\u03b9\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\"\n|-\n| Romanian\n| \"'''\u00cel''' v\u0103d pe Gheorghe.\"\n|}\n\nNote: The neutral case in normal ([[subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]]) word order is without a clitic: \"\u0413\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438.\" However, the form with an additional clitic pronoun is also perfectly normal and can be used for emphasis: \"\u0413\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043e \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438.\" And the clitic is obligatory in the case of a topicalized object (with OVS-word order), which serves also as the common colloquial equivalent of a passive construction. \"\u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438 \u0433\u043e \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c.\"\n\n=====Adjectives=====\nThe replacement of synthetic adjectival comparative forms with analytic ones by means of preposed markers is common.  These markers are:\n*Bulgarian: ''\u043f\u043e-''\n* Macedonian: ''\u043f\u043e'' (prepended)\n*Albanian:  ''m\u00eb''\n*Romanian:  ''mai''\n*Modern Greek:  ''\u03c0\u03b9\u03bf'' (pi\u00f3)\n*Aromanian: ''(ca)ma''\n\nMacedonian and Modern Greek have retained some of the earlier synthetic forms. In Bulgarian and Macedonian these have become proper adjectives in their own right without the possibility of [further] comparison. This is more evident in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: ''\u0432\u0438\u0448'' = \"higher, superior\", ''\u043d\u0438\u0436'' = \"lower, inferior\". Compare with similar structures in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: ''\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0448(-(\u0438\u044f(\u0442))/\u0430(\u0442\u0430)/\u043e(\u0442\u043e)/\u0438(\u0442\u0435))'' = \"(the) higher, (the) superior\" (''\u043f\u043e-\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0448(-(\u0438\u044f(\u0442))/\u0430(\u0442\u0430)/\u043e(\u0442\u043e)/\u0438(\u0442\u0435))'' = \"(the) [more] higher, (the) [more] superior\"; '\u043d\u0430\u0439-\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0448(-(\u0438\u044f(\u0442))/\u043e(\u0442\u043e)/\u0430(\u0442\u0430)/\u0438(\u0442\u0435))' = \"(the) ([most]) highest, supreme\"; ''\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0448'' (also spelled as ''\u043d\u0438'''\u0437'''\u0448'' sometimes) = \"low, lower, inferior\", it can also possess further comparative or superlative as with '\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0448' above.\n\n=====Suffixes=====\nAlso, some common suffixes can be found in the language area, such as the diminutive suffix of the Slavic languages (Srb. Bul. Mac.) \"-ovo\" \"-ica\" that can be found in Albanian, Greek and Romanian.\n\n===Vocabulary===\n\n====Loanwords====\nSeveral hundred words are common to the Balkan union languages; the origin of most of them is either [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] or [[Turkish language|Turkish]], as the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] and later the [[Ottoman Empire]] directly controlled the territory throughout most of its history, strongly influencing its culture and economics.\n\nAlbanian, Aromanian, Bulgarian, Greek, Romanian, Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian also share a large number of words of various origins:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

As a logistically important place, most of the biggest companies in the country set up branch offices there, creating many employment opportunities for local people. Job opportunities vary from porters and lorry-drivers to mid-level management officers.\nEducation service centers are also getting common in the town for a decade ago. School-cum-hostels host students from nearby villages and towns where the quality of higher education is poor. The University of Agriculture (Yezin) had established a branch in Aungpan. The Seven-hundred bedded military hospital also serves as a teaching hospital for Defence Service Medical Academy's house surgeons from Yangon. Therefore, several students of various age-levels can be seen in the town.\nThe town also plays a strategic role in military works that it has become an army base. The Seven-hundred bedded military hospital started its operation in the 2000s, providing healthcare service not only to military personnel but also to the wider public.\n\nRecent Town Committee's permit to set Aungpan's Pindaya exit road as an entertainment zone let KTVs mushroom along the road, forming as an only red-light district in the region. \nPin-hmi golf range which is located near the southern exit of the town is getting popular among local golfers and always crowded on weekends. Special tournaments are often held by the club, which is commonly sponsored by KBZ bank.\n\nThe Aungpan-Loikaw railroad was constructed in 1992. The condition of motorway from Aungpan to Loikaw was significantly improved over the past few years and local people no longer rely on train services nowadays.\n\nA recent boom in the tourism industry of Kalaw as a popular hiking spot and hill station has brought some impact to Aungpan as well. There are more than five hotels offering hundreds of rooms to visitors.\n\nDespite earning many municipal taxes from local businesses and people, township administrative parties were focusing mainly on Kalaw that the town grew double in size without proper city planning. There are no public amenities for the population and the private business sector starts to take chance by developing swimming pools, playground, football pitches, etc. around the town. \nThere is a small lake, named Mingalar Lake in Bahtoo Park. Once it was a collection of drain water discharged from living quarters. Renovation and restoration work for the park and the lake was carried out by the chairman of KBZ bank and now it becomes a recreational place for the locals.\n\nThe motorway passing through Aungpan is upgraded to four-lane recently. Consequently, buildings fall under motorway's zoning undergone demolition. Captain Ba Htoo's (one of the most famous leaders during Burma's Independence Movement during the colonial period) Memorial Monument was destroyed and to be built back near the original place. Controversial and criticisms arose around the country for complete demolishment without considering for relocation. The construction of the Monument is now under progress and will be opened on March 27th. The town's 100-years-anniversary clock-tower at the Pindaya junction was removed as well.\nUpgrade will be finished by April 2020 and now the town gets a newer look. \nHowever, the common use of motorway for the town's own traffic and speedy expressway vehicles is likely to lead accidents unless proper traffic regulation and enforcement are practiced.\n== Education ==\nThe town is home to:\n* Regional campus [Yezin Agricultural University (YAU)]\n\n== Health care ==\n\n=== Public Hospitals ===\n* Aungpan General Hospital\n* 700-bed military hospital\n\n==Aungchanthar Pagoda==\n[[File:Aung Chan Thar Pagoda1.jpg|thumb|right|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction.

It had been spent about Kyat six billion (about US$6 million) on the pagoda and it's about two-third finished. In 2005, it was estimated to cost about Kyat 7.6 billion. \n\nThe project has been really quite slow in the past ten years but visitors to the region often want to donate after hearing about the project.

Hence the previous definitions continued to be used for surveying in the United States and India for many years, and are denoted '''survey feet''' to distinguish them from the international foot.

Evidence that this unit was in widespread use across southern Britain is available from the [[Folkton Drums]] from  [[Yorkshire]] ([[neolithic]] artifacts, made from chalk, with circumferences that exactly divide as [[integers]] into ten long feet) and a similar object, the [[Lavant drum]], excavated at [[Lavant, West Sussex|Lavant]], Sussex, again with a circumference divisible as a whole number into ten long feet.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Teather |first1=Anne |display-authors=etal|title=Getting the Measure of Stonehenge |journal=[[British Archaeology]] |date=8 February 2019 |issue=165 |pages=48\u201351}}</ref>\n\nThe measures of [[Iron Age Britain]] are uncertain and proposed reconstructions such as the [[Megalithic Yard]] are controversial. Later [[Welsh legend]] credited [[Dyfnwal Moelmud]] with the establishment of [[Welsh units|their units]], including a foot of 9 inches. The Belgic or North German foot of 335&nbsp;mm (13.2&nbsp;inches) was introduced to England either by the [[Belgae|Belgic Celts]] during their invasions prior to the Romans or by the [[Anglo-Saxons]] in the 5th and 6th century.\n\n[[Roman units]] were introduced following [[Roman conquest of England|their invasion]] in {{sc|ad}}&nbsp;43. The [[Roman foot]] had been previously standardized by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] at around 296&nbsp;mm or 11.65&nbsp;inches. Following the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|Roman withdrawal]] and [[Saxon invasion of England|Saxon invasions]], the Roman foot continued to be used in the construction crafts while the Belgic foot was used for land measurement. Both the Welsh and Belgic feet seem to have been based on multiples of the [[barleycorn (unit)|barleycorn]], but by as early as 950 the English kings seem to have (ineffectually) ordered measures to be based upon an iron yardstick at [[Winchester]] and then [[London]].

In some cases, the foot is denoted by a [[Prime (symbol)|prime]], which is often marked by an [[apostrophe]], and the inch by a double prime; for example, 2 feet 4&nbsp;inches is sometimes denoted as 2\u2032\u22124\u2033, 2\u2032 4\u2033 or 2\u20324\u2033.  (See '[[minute]]' for another case where prime and double prime symbols are used to denote first and second cuts in refining measurement.)\n\n=== Pre-1959 ===\nIn the United States, the foot was defined as 12&nbsp;inches, with the inch being defined by the [[Mendenhall Order]] of 1893 by 39.37&nbsp;inches&nbsp;= 1&nbsp;m. In [[Imperial units]], the foot was defined as {{frac|1|3}}&nbsp;yard, with the yard being realized as a physical standard (separate from the standard meter).\n\nThe yard standards of the different [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries were periodically compared with one another.<ref>See, for example, ''Report on the Comparisons of the Parliamentary Copies of the Imperial Standards with the Imperial Standard Yard and the Imperial Standard Pound and with each other during the Years 1947 to 1948'' (H.M.S.O., London, 1950).

The small difference between the survey and the international foot would not be detectable on a survey of a small parcel, but becomes significant for mapping, or when the [[State Plane Coordinate System|state plane coordinate system]] (SPCS) is used in the US, because the origin of the system may be hundreds of thousands of feet (hundreds of miles) from the point of interest. Hence the previous definitions continued to be used for surveying in the United States and India for many years, and are denoted '''survey feet''' to distinguish them from the international foot. The United Kingdom was unaffected by this problem, as the [[retriangulation of Great Britain]] (1936\u201362) had been done in meters.\n\n====US survey foot{{anchor|United States survey foot}}====\nThe United States survey foot is defined as exactly {{frac|1200|3937}}&nbsp;meters, approximately {{val|0.304800609601|u=m}}.<ref>A.
