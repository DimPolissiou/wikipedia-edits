body, but consists of several distinct sections or neighborhoods, such as [[Banksville, Connecticut|Banksville]], [[Byram, Connecticut|Byram]], [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]], [[Glenville, Connecticut|Glenville]], [[Mianus (neighborhood)|Mianus]], [[Old Greenwich, Connecticut|Old Greenwich]], [[Riverside, Connecticut|Riverside]] and [[Greenwich (CDP), Connecticut|Greenwich]] (sometimes referred to as central, or downtown, Greenwich). Of these neighborhoods, three (Cos Cob, Old Greenwich, and Riverside) have separate postal names and [[ZIP codes]].<ref name=\"LOWV\">{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |title=A Guide To Greenwich Government |publisher=League of Women Voters Greenwich |date= |url=http://www.lwvg.org/guidetogreenwichgovernment.pdff |doi= |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nThe town has three [[Board of selectmen|selectmen]] and a [[Town meeting|Representative Town Meeting]] (RTM). The RTM must approve all budgets, and consists of 230 elected representatives. RTM members are not paid.  The three selectmen are elected on a town-wide basis, although each person can only vote for two members. This assures that there will almost always be one [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] and two [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]] or two Democrats and one Republican. While voter registration is skewed in the Republicans' favor, they do not have a lock on the First Selectman's chair, and Democrats have held the seat recently. Many of the other town committees have equal representation between Democrats and Republicans, regardless of the vote breakdown, since each individual can only vote for half as many seats as are available.<ref name=\"LOWV\"/>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n! colspan = 6 | Voter registration and party enrollment as of November 5, 2018<ref>{{cite web|url=https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/SOTS/ElectionServices/Registration_and_Enrollment_Stats/Copy-of-Nov18RE.pdf?la=en|title=Registration and Party Enrollment Statistics as of November 05, 2018|publisher=Connecticut Secretary of State|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230184233/http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/lib/sots/electionservices/registration_and_enrollment_stats/nov12re.pdf|archivedate=2012-12-30|url-status=|accessdate=2011-08-01}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Party\n!

The [[Boston Post Road]] (also known as East or West Putnam Avenue or simply [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|Route 1]]) also goes through town, as does the [[Merritt Parkway]], although the Merritt Parkway is a considerable distance from the downtown area. [[Interstate 684]] passes through Greenwich, but cannot be entered or exited there, and the nearest interchange is at the Westchester County Airport in [[New York State]].\n\n[[Westchester County Airport]] is the closest commercial airport to Greenwich. It takes approximately 15 minutes to drive from the town's center. This is followed by [[LaGuardia Airport]] in Queens, New York, a 35-minute drive approximately. [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in [[Queens|Queens, New York]], is the closest international airport, a one-hour drive approximately. [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] in New Jersey is also easily accessible from Greenwich, taking approximately one hour to drive to.\n\nTwo bridges in Greenwich were among 12 in the state listed in \"critical\" condition by state safety inspectors as of August 2007. The Riversville Road bridge, built in the 1950s, now has a weight limit of 3 tons, but as of August 5, 2007, the bridge had not been inspected in over two years (in March 2005), according to state records obtained by the ''[[Hartford Courant]]'', although a state official said the bridge was inspected in August 2005 and would be inspected again in August 2007. In the March 2005 inspection, the bridge's above-ground structure was deemed to be in critical condition, with other components in poor condition. The Bailiwick Road bridge in town was closed in April 2007 and remained closed as of August 2007 due to storm damage. The ratings for the two bridges were worse than the [[I-35W Mississippi River bridge|Interstate 35W bridge]] in Minneapolis, which collapsed during rush hour on August 1, 2007.<ref>Kaplan, Thomas, Martineau, Kim, and Kauffman, Matthew, \"12 state bridges are judged to be in critical condition\" article in ''[[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]]'' of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Connecticut]], article reprinted from ''[[The Hartford Courant]]'', August 5, 2007, pp1, A6</ref>\n\nAccording to the DataHaven Community Wellbeing Survey, a statewide program funded by various agencies and philanthropies, 4% of adults in Greenwich are \"transportation insecure,\" meaning that they have had to stay at home during the past year due to a lack of adequate transportation. The comparable rate for all adults statewide is 13%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Greenwich Town Profile|url=http://ctdatahaven.org/profiles/greenwich|website=DataHaven|publisher=DataHaven|accessdate=8 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Fire department===\n[[File:Byram Fire Station cloudy jeh.jpg|thumb|The Byram Fire Station, located on Delavan Avenue]]\nThe town of Greenwich is protected by the paid career members of the Greenwich Fire Department (GFD) and eight all-volunteer fire companies, in addition to a [[Fire police|Fire Police]] Patrol. The paid GFD is made up of 106 paid firefighters, who staff 6 Engine Companies and 1 Truck Company, as well as several special units, in 6 Fire Stations (shared with volunteer companies), under the command of a Deputy Chief (Tour Commander) per shift, who in-turn reports to the Chief of Department. The 7 volunteer fire companies are made up of a total of approximately 100 volunteer firefighters, who man 9 volunteer engines, 2 volunteer ladders, 4 tankers, 6 squads, 3 utility units, 3 marine units (fireboats), 1 dive rescue unit, 1 special operations unit, 1 heavy rescue and several other support units. The volunteer fire companies are quartered in 7 of the fire stations, located throughout the town, and respond to emergency calls with the paid GFD Units. The all-volunteer fire companies are each commanded by a District Chief, who in-turn reports to a Deputy Chief of the GFD, who reports to the Chief of Department.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenwichfire.org/about/ |title=Local 1042 GFD :: About the GFD |publisher=Greenwichfire.org |accessdate=2012-11-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110100453/http://www.greenwichfire.org/about/ |archivedate=2012-11-10 }}</ref> There is also the Cos Cob Fire Police Patrol, one of the only remaining Fire Police Patrols in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]].

The RTM must approve all budgets, and consists of 230 elected representatives. RTM members are not paid.  The three selectmen are elected on a town-wide basis, although each person can only vote for two members. This assures that there will almost always be one [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] and two [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]] or two Democrats and one Republican. While voter registration is skewed in the Republicans' favor, they do not have a lock on the First Selectman's chair, and Democrats have held the seat recently. Many of the other town committees have equal representation between Democrats and Republicans, regardless of the vote breakdown, since each individual can only vote for half as many seats as are available.<ref name=\"LOWV\"/>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n! colspan = 6 | Voter registration and party enrollment as of November 5, 2018<ref>{{cite web|url=https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/SOTS/ElectionServices/Registration_and_Enrollment_Stats/Copy-of-Nov18RE.pdf?la=en|title=Registration and Party Enrollment Statistics as of November 05, 2018|publisher=Connecticut Secretary of State|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230184233/http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/lib/sots/electionservices/registration_and_enrollment_stats/nov12re.pdf|archivedate=2012-12-30|url-status=|accessdate=2011-08-01}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Party\n!

In the March 2005 inspection, the bridge's above-ground structure was deemed to be in critical condition, with other components in poor condition. The Bailiwick Road bridge in town was closed in April 2007 and remained closed as of August 2007 due to storm damage.
