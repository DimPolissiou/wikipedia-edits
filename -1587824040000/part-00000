However, by 2014, daily ridership had risen to 700,000 with sections operating at 100% capacity during rush hour. Authorities responded by adding more trains and shortening headway to reduce crowding on the line.<ref name=\"weekday avg\" />\n\n===Phase I===\n[[File:Flashlight map of BJS Line 6, 2013-10-29.jpg|thumb|right|Route map of Line 6 Phase I]]\nIn Phase I, Line 6 runs {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} from Haidian Wuluju in [[Haidian District]] to Caofang in [[Chaoyang District, Beijing|Chaoyang District]] following Linglong Road, Sanlihe Road, Chaoyang North Road, the west bank of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]], and Yunhe East Road. In Phase I, there were 20 stations except the reserved [[Erligou station]]. Construction began in December 2007 and was completed in 2012.

The confrontation lasted for about 3 months from 20 June 645 to 18 September 645. \n\nThe initial phase of combat resulted in the defeat of a Gorguryeo relief force of 150,000 and resulted in the Tang troops laying siege to the fortress. After a siege lasting around 2 months, the Tang forces constructed a rampart with 500,000 troops and laborers. However, the rampart was on the brink of completion, when a section of it collapsed and was taken over by the defenders. This, along with arriving Goguryeo reinforcements and the lack of supplies, forced Tang troops into a retreat. Over 20,000 Goguryeo troops and 180,000 Tang troops were killed during the siege.\n\n==Background==\nIn the year 644, Taizu of Tang decided to invade Goguryeo in the face of opposition inside the Tang Dynasty. The assassination of Yongnu of Goguryeo and other officials by Yeon Gaesomun was used to justify invasion. For the next year, he began preparations for an invasion, preparing troops, ships, and siege engines, and conducting reconnissance. On the 1st of April 645, under the pretext of marching to camp Huaiyuan, Tang forces led by [[Li Shiji]] suddenly turned to invade [[Goguryeo]].<ref name=\"\uc548\uc2dc\uc131\uc804\ud22c2\">{{cite web|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0034848|title=\ubbfc\uc871\ubb38\ud654\ub300\ubc31\uacfc\uc0ac\uc804- \uc548\uc2dc\uc131\uc804\ud22c|website=encykorea|language=Korean|accessdate=November 11, 2016}}</ref> They attacked several castles including [[Fushun|Shin]] and [[Gaizhou|Geonan]], to throw the defense system of Goguryeo into disarray. The plan failed, and [[Li Shiji]] instead arrayed all Tang forces to besiege [[Shenyang|Gaemo]] on 15 April. Gaemo fell on 25 April. Simultaneously, naval forces led by [[Zhang Liang (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Liang]] had landed in [[Liaodong Peninsula]] and went on to capture [[Dalian|Bisa]] on the 2nd of May. Meanwhile, [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] joined the forces and they captured [[Liaoyang|Yodong]] and [[Dengta|Baegam]] one after another.<ref name=\"\u5b89\u5e02\u57ce\" />\n\nAfterwards, the Tang forces decided to attack Ansi Fortress, a fortress-city with a population of around 100,000, invading the fortress on 20 June.

The Tang Dynasty sent [[Li Shiji]] leading 15,000 infantry and cavalry to fight the Goguryeo army directly. But Tang general [[Zhangsun Wuji]] led 11,000 elite cavalry across the canyon from the north of the mountain to hit the rear of Goguryeo forces. In the battle, Taizong personally led 4,000 infantry and cavalry to fight. The Tang army came out victorious in the end, decimating the Goguryeo forces. At least 20,000 Goguryeo soldiers were killed and 36,800 Goguryeo soldiers, including their generals Go Yeonsu and Go Hyezin, surrendered. The Tang army captured 50,000 horses, over 50,000 cattle, and over 10,000 iron armors. After the battle, Tang had succeeded in isolating Ansi fortress from other Goguryeo territory.<ref name=gr02-197>{{cite book|last1=Graff|first1=David|title=Medieval Chinese Warfare 300\u2013900|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134553532|page=197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gpmBAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA197#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=28 October 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Assault on the Ansi fortress===\nThe Tang first attacked Ansi Fortress with several siege weapons including catapults and battering rams. However Goguryeo repelled the attacks and repaired the ramparts each time. As a result, Taizong was furious and Li Shi asked permission to massacre all the men and women if the fortress was captured, which was granted. After Anshi people heard this, they defended the fortress more tenaciously, the Tang army's assaults were repelled several times. When the Ansi fortress attack came to a standstill, Tang was in a hurry so the Tang Army attacked the west side of the fortress as many as six or seven times per day.<ref name=\uc548\uc2dc\uc131\uc804\ud22c>{{cite web|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0034848|title=\ubbfc\uc871\ubb38\ud654\ub300\ubc31\uacfc\uc0ac\uc804- \uc548\uc2dc\uc131\uc804\ud22c|language=Korean|website=encykorea|accessdate=November 11, 2016}}</ref> One night, hundreds of Goguryeo soldiers climbed out of the fortress and attempted to attack the Tang army.

The confrontation lasted for about 3 months from 20 June 645 to 18 September 645. \n\nThe initial phase of combat resulted in the defeat of a Gorguryeo relief force of 150,000 and resulted in the Tang troops laying siege to the fortress. After a siege lasting around 2 months, the Tang forces constructed a rampart with 500,000 troops and laborers. However, the rampart was on the brink of completion, when a section of it collapsed and was taken over by the defenders. This, along with arriving Goguryeo reinforcements and the lack of supplies, forced Tang troops into a retreat. Over 20,000 Goguryeo troops and 180,000 Tang troops were killed during the siege.\n\n==Background==\nIn the year 644, Taizu of Tang decided to invade Goguryeo in the face of opposition inside the Tang Dynasty. The assassination of Yongnu of Goguryeo and other officials by Yeon Gaesomun was used to justify invasion. For the next year, he began preparations for an invasion, preparing troops, ships, and siege engines, and conducting reconnissance. On the 1st of April 645, under the pretext of marching to camp Huaiyuan, Tang forces led by [[Li Shiji]] suddenly turned to invade [[Goguryeo]].<ref name=\"\uc548\uc2dc\uc131\uc804\ud22c2\">{{cite web|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0034848|title=\ubbfc\uc871\ubb38\ud654\ub300\ubc31\uacfc\uc0ac\uc804- \uc548\uc2dc\uc131\uc804\ud22c|website=encykorea|language=Korean|accessdate=November 11, 2016}}</ref> They attacked several castles including [[Fushun|Shin]] and [[Gaizhou|Geonan]], to throw the defense system of Goguryeo into disarray. The plan failed, and [[Li Shiji]] instead arrayed all Tang forces to besiege [[Shenyang|Gaemo]] on 15 April. Gaemo fell on 25 April. Simultaneously, naval forces led by [[Zhang Liang (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Liang]] had landed in [[Liaodong Peninsula]] and went on to capture [[Dalian|Bisa]] on the 2nd of May. Meanwhile, [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] joined the forces and they captured [[Liaoyang|Yodong]] and [[Dengta|Baegam]] one after another.<ref name=\"\u5b89\u5e02\u57ce\" />\n\nAfterwards, the Tang forces decided to attack Ansi Fortress, a fortress-city with a population of around 100,000, invading the fortress on 20 June.

But Tang general [[Zhangsun Wuji]] led 11,000 elite cavalry across the canyon from the north of the mountain to hit the rear of Goguryeo forces. In the battle, Taizong personally led 4,000 infantry and cavalry to fight. The Tang army came out victorious in the end, decimating the Goguryeo forces. At least 20,000 Goguryeo soldiers were killed and 36,800 Goguryeo soldiers, including their generals Go Yeonsu and Go Hyezin, surrendered. The Tang army captured 50,000 horses, over 50,000 cattle, and over 10,000 iron armors.

However Goguryeo repelled the attacks and repaired the ramparts each time. As a result, Taizong was furious and Li Shi asked permission to massacre all the men and women if the fortress was captured, which was granted. After Anshi people heard this, they defended the fortress more tenaciously, the Tang army's assaults were repelled several times.

In 1930 he was promoted to Deputy Prosecutor in a local court in [[Berezhany|Brze\u017cany]]. While Public Prosecutor, Lemkin was also secretary of the Committee on Codification of the Laws of the Republic of Poland, which codified the penal codes of Poland, and taught law at Tachkemoni College in Warsaw. Lemkin, working with [[Duke University]] law professor [[Malcolm McDermott]], translated ''The Polish Penal Code of 1932'' from Polish to English.\n\nIn 1933 Lemkin made a presentation to the Legal Council of the [[League of Nations]] conference on international criminal law in [[Madrid]], for which he prepared an essay on the ''Crime of Barbarity'' as a crime against international law. The concept of the crime, which later evolved into the idea of genocide, was based on the [[Armenian Genocide]]<ref name=aur/><ref name=schab/><ref name=moses/><ref name=ushmm/><ref name=jww/> and prompted by the experience of [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]<ref name=\"europaworld\"/> massacred in [[Iraq]] during the 1933 [[Simele massacre]].<ref>William Korey, \"Raphael Lemkin: 'The Unofficial Man',\" ''Midstream'', June\u2013July 1989, p. 45\u201348</ref> In 1934 Lemkin, under pressure from the Polish Foreign Minister for comments made at the [[Madrid]] conference, resigned his position and became a private solicitor in Warsaw. While in Warsaw, Lemkin attended numerous lectures organized by the [[Wolna Wszechnica Polska|Free Polish University]], including the classes of [[Emil Stanis\u0142aw Rappaport]] and [[Wac\u0142aw Makowski]].\n\nIn 1937, Lemkin was appointed a member of the Polish mission to the 4th Congress on Criminal Law in [[Paris]], where he also introduced the possibility of defending peace through criminal law. Among the most important of his works of that period are a compendium of Polish criminal fiscal law, {{lang|pl|Prawo karne skarbowe}} (1938) and a French-language work, {{lang|fr|La r\u00e9glementation des paiements internationaux}}, regarding international trade law (1939).\n\n===During WWII===\nHe left Warsaw on 6 September 1939 and made his way towards Wolkowysk, north east of Lwow, caught between the Germans in the west, and the Soviets, who now approached from the east, Poland's independence extinguished by [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|the pact between Stalin and Hitler]].<ref>Philippe Sands, East West Street, p. 159</ref> He barely evaded capture by the Germans and traveled through [[Lithuania]] to reach [[Sweden]]<ref name=\"Bartrop\">[[Paul R.

Curious about the manner of imposition of Nazi rule he started to gather Nazi decrees and ordinances, believing official documents often reflected underlying objectives without stating them explicitly. He spent much time in the central library of Stockholm, gathering, translating and analysing the documents he collected, looking for patterns of German behaviour. Lemkin's work led him to see the wholesale destruction of the nations over which Germans took control as an overall aim.

Lemkin did however successfully help his brother and family to emigrate to [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada in 1948.\n\nAfter arriving in the United States, at the invitation of McDermott, Lemkin joined the law faculty at [[Duke University]] in [[North Carolina]] in 1941.<ref>For more information on this period, see {{cite web|last=Bliwise|first=Robert|title=The Man Who Criminalized Genocide|url=http://www.dukemagazine.duke.edu/article/man-who-criminalized-genocide|publisher=Duke Magazine|accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref>  During the Summer of 1942 Lemkin lectured at the School of Military Government at the [[University of Virginia]]. He also wrote ''Military Government in Europe'', which was a preliminary version of his more fully developed publication ''Axis Rule in Occupied Europe''. In 1943 Lemkin was appointed consultant to the US [[Board of Economic Warfare]] and [[Foreign Economic Administration]] and later became a special adviser on foreign affairs to the War Department, largely due to his expertise in [[international law]].\n\nIn November 1944, the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] published Lemkin's most important work, entitled ''Axis Rule in Occupied Europe'', in the United States.

In 1945 to 1946, Lemkin became an advisor to [[Supreme Court of the United States]] Justice and [[Nuremberg Trial]] chief counsel [[Robert H. Jackson]].

Starting in 1948, he gave lectures on criminal law at [[Yale University]]. In 1955, he became a Professor of Law at [[Rutgers School of Law\u2013Newark|Rutgers School of Law]] in Newark. Lemkin also continued his campaign for international laws defining and forbidding genocide, which he had championed ever since the Madrid conference of 1933. He proposed a similar ban on crimes against humanity during the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1945, but his proposal was turned down.\n\nLemkin presented a draft resolution for a Genocide Convention treaty to a number of countries, in an effort to persuade them to sponsor the resolution. With the support of the United States, the resolution was placed before the General Assembly for consideration. The [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] was formally presented and adopted on 9 December 1948.<ref name=cisn>{{cite journal |last=Winter |first=Jay |authorlink= |title=Citation The Genesis Of Genocide |journal=MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History |volume=29 |issue=3 |page= 19 |publisher=History.Net |location=Vienna, Virginia |year=2017 }}</ref> In 1951, Lemkin only partially achieved his goal when the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] came into force, after the 20th nation had ratified the treaty.\n\nLemkin's broader concerns over genocide, as set out in his ''Axis Rule'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.preventgenocide.org/lemkin/AxisRule1944-1.htm|title=''Axis Rule in Occupied Europe,'' Chapter IX: Genocide, by Raphael Lemkin, 1944 \u2013 \u2013 Prevent Genocide International|first=Jim|last=Fussell|accessdate=30 April 2017}}</ref> also embraced what may be considered as non-physical, namely, psychological acts of genocide.

In his autobiography, Lemkin wrote that he had been influenced by the 15 March 1921 [[assassination of Talaat Pasha]]:\n\n<blockquote>Then one day I read in the newspapers that all Turkish war criminals were to be released... The Turkish criminals released from Malta dispersed all over the world. The most frightful among them was [[Talaat Pasha]], the minister of the interior of Turkey, who was identified with the destruction of the Armenian people...

His culture, his temperament, his language, his religion, are all different... to eliminate (Ukrainian) nationalism... the Ukrainian peasantry was sacrificed...a famine was necessary for the Soviet and so they got one to order... if the Soviet program succeeds completely, if the intelligentsia, the priest, and the peasant can be eliminated [then] Ukraine will be as dead as if every Ukrainian were killed, for it will have lost that part of it which has kept and developed its culture, its beliefs, its common ideas, which have guided it and given it a soul, which, in short, made it a nation...

In 1930 he was promoted to Deputy Prosecutor in a local court in [[Berezhany|Brze\u017cany]]. While Public Prosecutor, Lemkin was also secretary of the Committee on Codification of the Laws of the Republic of Poland, which codified the penal codes of Poland, and taught law at Tachkemoni College in Warsaw. Lemkin, working with [[Duke University]] law professor [[Malcolm McDermott]], translated ''The Polish Penal Code of 1932'' from Polish to English.\n\nIn 1933 Lemkin made a presentation to the Legal Council of the [[League of Nations]] conference on international criminal law in [[Madrid]], for which he prepared an essay on the ''Crime of Barbarity'' as a crime against international law. The concept of the crime, which later evolved into the idea of genocide, was based on the [[Armenian Genocide]]<ref name=aur/><ref name=schab/><ref name=moses/><ref name=ushmm/><ref name=jww/> and prompted by the experience of [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]<ref name=\"europaworld\"/> massacred in [[Iraq]] during the 1933 [[Simele massacre]].<ref>William Korey, \"Raphael Lemkin: 'The Unofficial Man',\" ''Midstream'', June\u2013July 1989, p. 45\u201348</ref> In 1934 Lemkin, under pressure from the Polish Foreign Minister for comments made at the [[Madrid]] conference, resigned his position and became a private solicitor in Warsaw. While in Warsaw, Lemkin attended numerous lectures organized by the [[Wolna Wszechnica Polska|Free Polish University]], including the classes of [[Emil Stanis\u0142aw Rappaport]] and [[Wac\u0142aw Makowski]].\n\nIn 1937, Lemkin was appointed a member of the Polish mission to the 4th Congress on Criminal Law in [[Paris]], where he also introduced the possibility of defending peace through criminal law. Among the most important of his works of that period are a compendium of Polish criminal fiscal law, {{lang|pl|Prawo karne skarbowe}} (1938) and a French-language work, {{lang|fr|La r\u00e9glementation des paiements internationaux}}, regarding international trade law (1939).\n\n===During WWII===\nHe left Warsaw on 6 September 1939 and made his way towards Wolkowysk, north east of Lwow, caught between the Germans in the west, and the Soviets, who now approached from the east, Poland's independence extinguished by [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|the pact between Stalin and Hitler]].<ref>Philippe Sands, East West Street, p. 159</ref> He barely evaded capture by the Germans and traveled through [[Lithuania]] to reach [[Sweden]]<ref name=\"Bartrop\">[[Paul R.

Curious about the manner of imposition of Nazi rule he started to gather Nazi decrees and ordinances, believing official documents often reflected underlying objectives without stating them explicitly. He spent much time in the central library of Stockholm, gathering, translating and analysing the documents he collected, looking for patterns of German behaviour. Lemkin's work led him to see the wholesale destruction of the nations over which Germans took control as an overall aim. Some documents Lemkin analysed had been signed by Hitler, implementing ideas of ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' on ''[[Lebensraum]]'', new living space to be inhabited by Germans.<ref>Sands, p.165</ref> With the help of his pre-war associate McDermott, Lemkin received permission to enter<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sands |first1=Philippe |authorlink=Philippe Sands |title=East West Street: On the Origins of \"Genocide\" and \"Crimes Against Humanity\" |chapter=69 |location=New York |publisher=Alfred A.

Lemkin did however successfully help his brother and family to emigrate to [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada in 1948.\n\nAfter arriving in the United States, at the invitation of McDermott, Lemkin joined the law faculty at [[Duke University]] in [[North Carolina]] in 1941.<ref>For more information on this period, see {{cite web|last=Bliwise|first=Robert|title=The Man Who Criminalized Genocide|url=http://www.dukemagazine.duke.edu/article/man-who-criminalized-genocide|publisher=Duke Magazine|accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref>  During the Summer of 1942 Lemkin lectured at the School of Military Government at the [[University of Virginia]]. He also wrote ''Military Government in Europe'', which was a preliminary version of his more fully developed publication ''Axis Rule in Occupied Europe''. In 1943 Lemkin was appointed consultant to the US [[Board of Economic Warfare]] and [[Foreign Economic Administration]] and later became a special adviser on foreign affairs to the War Department, largely due to his expertise in [[international law]].\n\nIn November 1944, the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] published Lemkin's most important work, entitled ''Axis Rule in Occupied Europe'', in the United States. This book included an extensive legal analysis of German rule in countries occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] during the course of [[World War II]], along with the definition of the term ''[[genocide]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0in2wOY-W0C|title=Axis Rule in Occupied Europe: Laws of Occupation \u2013 Analysis of Government \u2013 Proposals for Redress|last=Lemkin|first=Raphael|publisher=[[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] Division of International Law|year=1944|isbn=9781584779018|location=700 Jackson Place, N.

In 1945 to 1946, Lemkin became an advisor to [[Supreme Court of the United States]] Justice and [[Nuremberg Trial]] chief counsel [[Robert H. Jackson]]. The book became one of the foundational texts in Holocaust studies, and the study of totalitarianism, mass violence, and genocide studies.<ref>D.

Starting in 1948, he gave lectures on criminal law at [[Yale University]]. In 1955, he became a Professor of Law at [[Rutgers School of Law\u2013Newark|Rutgers School of Law]] in Newark. Lemkin also continued his campaign for international laws defining and forbidding genocide, which he had championed ever since the Madrid conference of 1933. He proposed a similar ban on crimes against humanity during the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1945, but his proposal was turned down.\n\nLemkin presented a draft resolution for a Genocide Convention treaty to a number of countries, in an effort to persuade them to sponsor the resolution. With the support of the United States, the resolution was placed before the General Assembly for consideration. The [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] was formally presented and adopted on 9 December 1948.<ref name=cisn>{{cite journal |last=Winter |first=Jay |authorlink= |title=Citation The Genesis Of Genocide |journal=MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History |volume=29 |issue=3 |page= 19 |publisher=History.Net |location=Vienna, Virginia |year=2017 }}</ref> In 1951, Lemkin only partially achieved his goal when the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] came into force, after the 20th nation had ratified the treaty.\n\nLemkin's broader concerns over genocide, as set out in his ''Axis Rule'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.preventgenocide.org/lemkin/AxisRule1944-1.htm|title=''Axis Rule in Occupied Europe,'' Chapter IX: Genocide, by Raphael Lemkin, 1944 \u2013 \u2013 Prevent Genocide International|first=Jim|last=Fussell|accessdate=30 April 2017}}</ref> also embraced what may be considered as non-physical, namely, psychological acts of genocide.

In his autobiography, Lemkin wrote that he had been influenced by the 15 March 1921 [[assassination of Talaat Pasha]]:\n\n<blockquote>Then one day I read in the newspapers that all Turkish war criminals were to be released... The Turkish criminals released from Malta dispersed all over the world. The most frightful among them was [[Talaat Pasha]], the minister of the interior of Turkey, who was identified with the destruction of the Armenian people...

His culture, his temperament, his language, his religion, are all different... to eliminate (Ukrainian) nationalism... the Ukrainian peasantry was sacrificed...a famine was necessary for the Soviet and so they got one to order... if the Soviet program succeeds completely, if the intelligentsia, the priest, and the peasant can be eliminated [then] Ukraine will be as dead as if every Ukrainian were killed, for it will have lost that part of it which has kept and developed its culture, its beliefs, its common ideas, which have guided it and given it a soul, which, in short, made it a nation...
