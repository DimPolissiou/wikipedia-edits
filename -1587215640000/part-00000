From there, the highway travels east-northeastward through [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]], [[Midland, Texas|Midland]], and [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]] before turning eastward towards [[Dallas/Fort Worth]]. The [[La Entrada al Pacifico]] corridor runs along I-20 between [[U.S. Route 385]] (US&nbsp;385) and [[Farm to Market Road 1788]] (FM 1788). Between [[Monahans, Texas|Monahans]] and I-10, I-20 has an {{convert|80|mph|km/h}} speed limit.\n\nFrom the highway's opening in the 1960s through 1971, I-20 originally went through the heart of the Metroplex via the [[Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike]]. This old route is now signed [[Interstate 30|I-30]] (Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike), [[U.S. Route 80|US&nbsp;80]] (former stretch between I-635 and [[Terrell, Texas|Terrell]]) and [[Texas State Highway Spur 557|Texas Spur&nbsp;557]] (bypass around Terrell).\n\nIn 1977, I-20 was rerouted to go through the southern sections of Fort Worth, [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]], [[Grand Prairie, Texas|Grand Prairie]], [[Dallas]], and [[Mesquite, Texas|Mesquite]] before rejoining its original route at Terrell. Part of I-20 in Dallas is named the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway and used to be signed as I-635.\n\nI-20 continues eastward from Terrell, bypassing [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]], [[Longview, Texas|Longview]], and [[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]] before crossing the Louisiana border near Waskom.\n\n===Louisiana===\n{{main|Interstate 20 in Louisiana}}\n\nIn [[Louisiana]], I-20 roughly parallels [[U.S. Route 80 in Louisiana|U.S. Route 80]] through the northern part of the state.\n\nEntering the state from near [[Waskom, Texas]], the highway immediately enters the [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]-[[Bossier City, Louisiana|Bossier City]] metropolitan area, intersecting [[Interstate 49 in Louisiana|I-49]] near downtown Shreveport and passing close to [[Barksdale Air Force Base]] in Bossier City.\n\nFrom that area, the highway traverses mainly rural, hilly terrain, bypassing [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]], [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] and [[Grambling, Louisiana|Grambling]] before reaching [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]].\n\nFrom Monroe, I-20 enters flatter terrain as it approaches the [[Mississippi River]]. Before crossing the Mississippi, the highway passes [[Tallulah, Louisiana|Tallulah]]. At the Mississippi River, I-20 leaves Louisiana and enters [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]].\n\n===Mississippi===\n{{main|Interstate 20 in Mississippi}}\n[[File:Welcometomississippi i-20.jpg|right|thumb|A photo of the state welcome sign westbound.]]\nUpon entering Mississippi by crossing the [[Mississippi River]], I-20 immediately enters [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]. Between Edwards and [[Clinton, Mississippi|Clinton]], the highway mostly follows the original two-lane routing of [[U.S. Route 80|US&nbsp;80]]. In Jackson, I-20 sees a short concurrency with both [[Interstate 55|I-55]] and [[U.S. Route 49|US&nbsp;49]]. Also in Jackson is an unusually expansive [[stack interchange]], at the [[Interchange (road)|junction]] of I-20, I-55 North and US&nbsp;49 South. The interchange replaces a former directional interchange at I-55 North and a cloverleaf at Highway&nbsp;49. From the Stack, I-20 continues eastward to [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]], where it begins the nearly {{convert|160|mi|km|sing=on}} overlap with [[Interstate 59|I-59]].\n\nThe route of the Mississippi section of I-20 is defined in Mississippi Code \u00a7 65-3-3.\n\n===Alabama===\n[[File:I20I59Birmingham.JPG|left|thumb|I-20 (co-signed with I-59) approaching I-65 in downtown Birmingham. This is sometimes referred to as Malfunction Junction.]]\n{{main|Interstate 20 in Alabama}}\n\nI-20 (along with I-59) crosses the Alabama state line near York, and it stays conjoined as it passes through western Alabama and [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]]. At [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], the two highways pass through downtown together before splitting at Exit&nbsp;130 just east of the [[Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport|Birmingham airport]]. I-20 continues eastward through [[Oxford, Alabama|Oxford]]/[[Anniston, Alabama]], and the Talladega National Forest, passing by the [[Talladega Superspeedway]] in the process, which is visible from the highway.\n\nAlso in Birmingham, the intersection of I-20&nbsp;/&nbsp;I-59 and [[Interstate 65|I-65]] is known as a [[Malfunction Junction]] because of the interchange's somewhat-confusing design, and the number of traffic accidents that occur there. This section of the Interstate is currently (2018) undergoing construction to reconfigure the interchanges.<ref>https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2017/11/birmingham_malfunction_junctio.html</ref><ref>https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/04/dysfunction_at_malfunction_jun.html</ref>\n\n===Georgia===\n[[File:Augusta Georgia I-20 at I-520 flyover ramp construction.jpg|thumb|I-20 eastbound at I-520 interchange, in Augusta, GA]]\n{{main|Interstate 20 in Georgia}}\n\nI-20 enters Georgia near [[Tallapoosa, Georgia|Tallapoosa]] and after passing through western Georgia, it enters the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]]. On clear days, eastbound motorists get their first view of [[downtown Atlanta]] as they come over the top of the [[Six Flags Hill]]. The [[Six Flags Over Georgia]] amusement park is easily visible off exit&nbsp;46 eastbound. The highway then passes through the center of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], meeting with [[Interstate 75 in Georgia|I-75]] and [[Interstate 85 in Georgia|I-85]], which share a common expressway (the \"[[Downtown Connector]]\"). It continues through Metropolitan Atlanta eastward and through the eastern half of Georgia until it exits the state, crossing the [[Savannah River]] at [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]].\n\nThroughout the state, I-20 is conjoined with unsigned [[Georgia State Route 402|State Route&nbsp;402]] (SR&nbsp;402). Also, I-20 from the Alabama state line to [[Interstate 285 (Georgia)|I-285]] in Atlanta is named the \"Tom Murphy Freeway\", but it is called the \"Ralph David Abernathy Freeway\" within I-285. The Interstate Highway is also named the Purple Heart Highway from I-285 in DeKalb County to [[U.S. 441|US&nbsp;441]] in [[Madison, Georgia]], and it is called the Carl Sanders Highway from US&nbsp;441 to the South Carolina state line.\n\n===South Carolina===\n{{main|Interstate 20 in South Carolina}}\n[[File:Northbound Interstate 95 @ Interstate 20; Florence SC.jpg|right|thumb|Approaching the eastern terminus of I-20 on I-95, Florence, SC]]\n\nUpon leaving Augusta, I-20 crosses the [[Savannah River]] and enters the Palmetto State and heads northeastward, bypassing [[Aiken, South Carolina|Aiken]] and [[Lexington, South Carolina|Lexington]] before reaching the state capital of [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], which can be reached most directly by taking [[Interstate 26|I-26]] east at Exit&nbsp;64 (\"Malfunction Junction\"), then, almost immediately, [[Interstate 126|I-126]]&nbsp;/&nbsp;[[U.S. Route 76|US&nbsp;76]].\n\nAt Columbia, I-20 bypasses the city to the north and again turns northeastward, bypassing [[Fort Jackson, South Carolina|Fort Jackson]] and [[Camden, South Carolina|Camden]]. After crossing the [[Wateree River]], it turns due east, passes by tiny [[Bishopville]], before reaching the [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]] area. It is near Florence where I-20 sees its eastern terminus at [[Interstate 95 in South Carolina|Interstate 95]]. However, for about two miles (3&nbsp;km), the highway continues into Florence as [[Interstate 20 Business (Florence, South Carolina)|Business Spur&nbsp;20]].\n\nI-20 in the Palmetto State is known as either the J. Strom Thurmond Freeway or John C. West Freeway. The first section to be completed was the [[bridge]] over the Savannah River in 1965; the last, the section between [[U.S. Route 401|US&nbsp;401]] and I-95 (including the business spur), opened in August 1975.\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=July 2016}}\nI-20 was built in 1957 connecting Texas to the east coast running through Shreveport La, Ruston La, and Monroe La making it their first interstate.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nI-20's path in Atlanta was designed in the late 1950s, during the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], to separate the city's white and African-American populations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/traffic-atlanta-segregation.html|title=What does a traffic jam in Atlanta have to do with segregation?

From there, the highway travels east-northeastward through [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]], [[Midland, Texas|Midland]], and [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]] before turning eastward towards [[Dallas/Fort Worth]]. The [[La Entrada al Pacifico]] corridor runs along I-20 between [[U.S. Route 385]] (US&nbsp;385) and [[Farm to Market Road 1788]] (FM 1788). Between [[Monahans, Texas|Monahans]] and I-10, I-20 has an {{convert|80|mph|km/h}} speed limit.\n\nFrom the highway's opening in the 1960s through 1971, I-20 originally went through the heart of the Metroplex via the [[Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike]]. This old route is now signed [[Interstate 30|I-30]] (Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike), [[U.S. Route 80|US&nbsp;80]] (former stretch between I-635 and [[Terrell, Texas|Terrell]]) and [[Texas State Highway Spur 557|Texas Spur&nbsp;557]] (bypass around Terrell).\n\nIn 1977, I-20 was rerouted to go through the southern sections of Fort Worth, [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]], [[Grand Prairie, Texas|Grand Prairie]], [[Dallas]], and [[Mesquite, Texas|Mesquite]] before rejoining its original route at Terrell. Part of I-20 in Dallas is named the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway and used to be signed as I-635.\n\nI-20 continues eastward from Terrell, bypassing [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]], [[Longview, Texas|Longview]], and [[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]] before crossing the Louisiana border near Waskom.\n\n===Louisiana===\n{{main|Interstate 20 in Louisiana}}\n\nIn [[Louisiana]], I-20 roughly parallels [[U.S. Route 80 in Louisiana|U.S. Route 80]] through the northern part of the state.\n\nEntering the state from near [[Waskom, Texas]], the highway immediately enters the [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]-[[Bossier City, Louisiana|Bossier City]] metropolitan area, intersecting [[Interstate 49 in Louisiana|I-49]] near downtown Shreveport and passing close to [[Barksdale Air Force Base]] in Bossier City.\n\nFrom that area, the highway traverses mainly rural, hilly terrain, bypassing [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]], [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] and [[Grambling, Louisiana|Grambling]] before reaching [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]].\n\nFrom Monroe, I-20 enters flatter terrain as it approaches the [[Mississippi River]]. Before crossing the Mississippi, the highway passes [[Tallulah, Louisiana|Tallulah]]. At the Mississippi River, I-20 leaves Louisiana and enters [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]].\n\n===Mississippi===\n{{main|Interstate 20 in Mississippi}}\n[[File:Welcometomississippi i-20.jpg|right|thumb|A photo of the state welcome sign westbound.]]\nUpon entering Mississippi by crossing the [[Mississippi River]], I-20 immediately enters [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]. Between Edwards and [[Clinton, Mississippi|Clinton]], the highway mostly follows the original two-lane routing of [[U.S. Route 80|US&nbsp;80]]. In Jackson, I-20 sees a short concurrency with both [[Interstate 55|I-55]] and [[U.S. Route 49|US&nbsp;49]]. Also in Jackson is an unusually expansive [[stack interchange]], at the [[Interchange (road)|junction]] of I-20, I-55 North and US&nbsp;49 South. The interchange replaces a former directional interchange at I-55 North and a cloverleaf at Highway&nbsp;49. From the Stack, I-20 continues eastward to [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]], where it begins the nearly {{convert|160|mi|km|sing=on}} overlap with [[Interstate 59|I-59]].\n\nThe route of the Mississippi section of I-20 is defined in Mississippi Code \u00a7 65-3-3.\n\n===Alabama===\n[[File:I20I59Birmingham.JPG|left|thumb|I-20 (co-signed with I-59) approaching I-65 in downtown Birmingham. This is sometimes referred to as Malfunction Junction.]]\n{{main|Interstate 20 in Alabama}}\n\nI-20 (along with I-59) crosses the Alabama state line near York, and it stays conjoined as it passes through western Alabama and [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]]. At [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], the two highways pass through downtown together before splitting at Exit&nbsp;130 just east of the [[Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport|Birmingham airport]]. I-20 continues eastward through [[Oxford, Alabama|Oxford]]/[[Anniston, Alabama]], and the Talladega National Forest, passing by the [[Talladega Superspeedway]] in the process, which is visible from the highway.\n\nAlso in Birmingham, the intersection of I-20&nbsp;/&nbsp;I-59 and [[Interstate 65|I-65]] is known as a [[Malfunction Junction]] because of the interchange's somewhat-confusing design, and the number of traffic accidents that occur there. This section of the Interstate is currently (2018) undergoing construction to reconfigure the interchanges.<ref>https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2017/11/birmingham_malfunction_junctio.html</ref><ref>https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/04/dysfunction_at_malfunction_jun.html</ref>\n\n===Georgia===\n[[File:Augusta Georgia I-20 at I-520 flyover ramp construction.jpg|thumb|I-20 eastbound at I-520 interchange, in Augusta, GA]]\n{{main|Interstate 20 in Georgia}}\n\nI-20 enters Georgia near [[Tallapoosa, Georgia|Tallapoosa]] and after passing through western Georgia, it enters the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]]. On clear days, eastbound motorists get their first view of [[downtown Atlanta]] as they come over the top of the [[Six Flags Hill]]. The [[Six Flags Over Georgia]] amusement park is easily visible off exit&nbsp;46 eastbound. The highway then passes through the center of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], meeting with [[Interstate 75 in Georgia|I-75]] and [[Interstate 85 in Georgia|I-85]], which share a common expressway (the \"[[Downtown Connector]]\"). It continues through Metropolitan Atlanta eastward and through the eastern half of Georgia until it exits the state, crossing the [[Savannah River]] at [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]].\n\nThroughout the state, I-20 is conjoined with unsigned [[Georgia State Route 402|State Route&nbsp;402]] (SR&nbsp;402). Also, I-20 from the Alabama state line to [[Interstate 285 (Georgia)|I-285]] in Atlanta is named the \"Tom Murphy Freeway\", but it is called the \"Ralph David Abernathy Freeway\" within I-285. The Interstate Highway is also named the Purple Heart Highway from I-285 in DeKalb County to [[U.S. 441|US&nbsp;441]] in [[Madison, Georgia]], and it is called the Carl Sanders Highway from US&nbsp;441 to the South Carolina state line.\n\n===South Carolina===\n{{main|Interstate 20 in South Carolina}}\n[[File:Northbound Interstate 95 @ Interstate 20; Florence SC.jpg|right|thumb|Approaching the eastern terminus of I-20 on I-95, Florence, SC]]\n\nUpon leaving Augusta, I-20 crosses the [[Savannah River]] and enters the Palmetto State and heads northeastward, bypassing [[Aiken, South Carolina|Aiken]] and [[Lexington, South Carolina|Lexington]] before reaching the state capital of [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], which can be reached most directly by taking [[Interstate 26|I-26]] east at Exit&nbsp;64 (\"Malfunction Junction\"), then, almost immediately, [[Interstate 126|I-126]]&nbsp;/&nbsp;[[U.S. Route 76|US&nbsp;76]].\n\nAt Columbia, I-20 bypasses the city to the north and again turns northeastward, bypassing [[Fort Jackson, South Carolina|Fort Jackson]] and [[Camden, South Carolina|Camden]]. After crossing the [[Wateree River]], it turns due east, passes by tiny [[Bishopville]], before reaching the [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]] area. It is near Florence where I-20 sees its eastern terminus at [[Interstate 95 in South Carolina|Interstate 95]]. However, for about two miles (3&nbsp;km), the highway continues into Florence as [[Interstate 20 Business (Florence, South Carolina)|Business Spur&nbsp;20]].\n\nI-20 in the Palmetto State is known as either the J. Strom Thurmond Freeway or John C. West Freeway. The first section to be completed was the [[bridge]] over the Savannah River in 1965; the last, the section between [[U.S. Route 401|US&nbsp;401]] and I-95 (including the business spur), opened in August 1975.\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=July 2016}}\nI-20 was built in 1957 connecting Texas to the east coast running through Shreveport La, Ruston La, and Monroe La making it their first interstate.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nI-20's path in Atlanta was designed in the late 1950s, during the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], to separate the city's white and African-American populations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/traffic-atlanta-segregation.html|title=What does a traffic jam in Atlanta have to do with segregation?

According to epigraphist [[Iravatham Mahadevan]], this was the first datable artefact bearing the Indus script to be found in Tamil Nadu. According to Mahadevan, the find was evidence of the use of the [[Harappan language]], and therefore that the \"Neolithic people of the Tamil country spoke a [[Harappan language]]\". The date of the celt was estimated at between 1500 BCE and 2000 BCE. Though this finding remains contested, like the claim of historian Michel Danino who rubbishes the theory of the latter\u2019s southward migration in a paper he presented at the International Symposium on Indus Civilisation and Tamil Language in 2007. He wrote: \u2018There is no archaeological evidence of a southward migration through the Deccan after the end of the urban phase of the Indus Valley Civilisation The only actual evidence of movements at that period is of Late Harappans migrating towards the Ganges plains and towards Gujarat... Migration apart, there is a complete absence of Harappan artefacts and features south of the Vindhyas: no Harappan designs on pottery, no Harappan seals, crafts and ornaments, no trace of Harappan urbanism\u2026 Cultural continuity from Harappan to historical times has been increasingly documented in North India, but not in the South\u2026 This means, in effect, that the south-bound Late Harappans would have reverted from an advanced urban bronze-age culture to a Neolithic one! Their migration to South would thus constitute a double \u201carchaeological miracle\u201d: apart from being undetectable on the ground, it implies that the migrants experienced a total break with all their traditions. Such a phenomenon is unheard of.\u2019\n<ref>{{cite news |title=Significance of Mayiladuthurai find |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/article3126838.ece |accessdate=2 April 2016 |work=The Hindu |date=1 May 2006 |language=en-IN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101032334/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/article3126838.ece |archive-date=1 January 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=T|first1=Saravanan|title=How a recent archaeological discovery throws light on the history of Tamil script|url=http://www.thehindu.com/society/10th-century-ce-oil-press-discovered-near-andipatti-with-a-tamil-script/article22814589.ece|date=22 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= the eternal harappan script |url= http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/india/the-eternal-harappan-script-tease |access-date= 24 March 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190324134658/http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/india/the-eternal-harappan-script-tease |archive-date= 24 March 2019 |url-status=live |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Sangam period (500 BCE \u2013 300 CE) ===\n{{Main|Sangam period|Tamilakam|Sangam landscape}}\n[[File:KeeladiExcavationCamp8.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Keeladi excavation site|Keeladi]], a Sangam Era Excavation Site, [[Sangam period]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/keezhadi-excavation-the-story-till-now/article18464920.ece|title=Keezhadi excavation leads to ancient civilisation on the banks of Vaigai|date=16 May 2017|via=www.thehindu.com|newspaper=The Hindu|last2=Sundar|first2=S.|last3=Sundar|first3=S.|last4=Jesudasan|first4=Dennis S.|last5=Jesudasan|first5=Dennis S.|last6=Jesudasan|first6=Dennis S.|last7=Jesudasan|first7=Dennis S.|last8=Shrikumar|first8=A.|last9=Shrikumar|first9=A.|last10=S|first10=Mohamed Imranullah|last11=S|first11=Mohamed Imranullah|last14=b. a|first14=Pon Vasanth|last15=b. a|first15=Pon Vasanth|last16=Kolappan|first16=B.|last17=Kolappan|first17=B.|last18=Kolappan|first18=B.|last19=Kolappan|first19=B.|last20=Saravanan|first20=T.|last21=Saravanan|first21=T.|last22=Annamalai|first22=S.|last23=Annamalai|first23=S.|last24=Shrikumar|first24=A.|last25=Shrikumar|first25=A.|last26=Annamalai|first26=S.|last27=Annamalai|first27=S.|last28=Annamalai|first28=S.|last29=Annamalai|first29=S.|last1=Kavitha|first1=S.

These are the earliest specimen of Dravidian temples under the Cholas. His son Aditya I built several temples around the Kanchi and Kumbakonam regions. The Cholas went on to becoming a great power and built some of the most imposing religious structures in their lifetime and they also renovated temples and buildings of the [[Pallavas]], acknowledging their common socio-religious and cultural heritage. The celebrated [[Nataraja]] temple at [[Chidambaram]] and the [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam|Sri Ranganathaswami Temple]] at [[Srirangam]] held special significance for the Cholas which have been mentioned in their inscriptions as their tutelary deities.

The Vijayanagara empire eventually conquered the entire Tamil country by c. 1370 and ruled for almost two centuries until its defeat in the [[Battle of Talikota]] in 1565 by a confederacy of [[Deccan sultanates]]. Subsequently, as the Vijayanagara Empire went into decline after the mid-16th century, many local rulers, called [[Nayak dynasty|Nayaks]], succeeded in gaining the trappings of independence. This eventually resulted in the further weakening of the empire; many Nayaks declared themselves independent, among whom the [[Nayaks of Madurai]] and Tanjore were the first to declare their independence, despite initially maintaining loose links with the Vijayanagara kingdom.{{sfn|Sastri|1970|pp=18\u2013182}} The Nayaks of Madurai and [[Nayaks of Thanjavur]] were the most prominent Nayaks of the 17th century.

The fall of the Vijayanagara empire and the Chandragiri Nayakas gave the [[sultanate of Golconda]] a chance to expand into the Tamil heartland. When the sultanate was incorporated into the Mughal Empire in 1688, the northern part of current-day Tamil Nadu was administrated by the [[nawab of the Carnatic]], who had his seat in [[Arcot]] from 1715 onward. Meanwhile, to the south, the fall of the [[Thanjavur Nayaks]] led to a short-lived [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom]]. The fall of the [[Madurai Nayaks]] brought up many small Nayakars of southern Tamil Nadu, who ruled small parcels of land called Palayams. The chieftains of these Palayams were known as [[Palaiyakkarar]] (or 'polygar' as called by British) and were ruling under the nawabs of the Carnatic.\n\n[[File:Fort Dansborg.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Fort Dansborg]] at [[Tharangambadi]] built by the [[Danes|Danish]]]]\nEuropeans started to establish trade centres during the 17th century in the eastern coastal regions.

Ramasamy|E. V. Ramasamy]] was renamed [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] in 1944. It was a non-political party which demanded the establishment of an independent state called [[Dravida Nadu]]. However, due to the differences between its two leaders E. V. Ramasamy and [[C. N. Annadurai]], the party was split.\n\n=== Post-Independence ===\nC. N. Annadurai left the party Dravida Kazhagam to form the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK). The DMK decided to enter politics in 1956. After the demise of C. N. Annadurai, [[M. Karunanidhi]] became the leader of the party which was supported by majority leaders including then famous actor [[M. G. Ramachandran]]. As a breakaway faction of the DMK. In 1972, M. G.

According to epigraphist [[Iravatham Mahadevan]], this was the first datable artefact bearing the Indus script to be found in Tamil Nadu. According to Mahadevan, the find was evidence of the use of the [[Harappan language]], and therefore that the \"Neolithic people of the Tamil country spoke a [[Harappan language]]\". The date of the celt was estimated at between 1500 BCE and 2000 BCE. Though this finding remains contested, like the claim of historian Michel Danino who rubbishes the theory of the latter\u2019s southward migration in a paper he presented at the International Symposium on Indus Civilisation and Tamil Language in 2007. He wrote: \u2018There is no archaeological evidence of a southward migration through the Deccan after the end of the urban phase of the Indus Valley Civilisation The only actual evidence of movements at that period is of Late Harappans migrating towards the Ganges plains and towards Gujarat... Migration apart, there is a complete absence of Harappan artefacts and features south of the Vindhyas: no Harappan designs on pottery, no Harappan seals, crafts and ornaments, no trace of Harappan urbanism\u2026 Cultural continuity from Harappan to historical times has been increasingly documented in North India, but not in the South\u2026 This means, in effect, that the south-bound Late Harappans would have reverted from an advanced urban bronze-age culture to a Neolithic one! Their migration to South would thus constitute a double \u201carchaeological miracle\u201d: apart from being undetectable on the ground, it implies that the migrants experienced a total break with all their traditions.

The Vijayanagara empire eventually conquered the entire Tamil country by c. 1370 and ruled for almost two centuries until its defeat in the [[Battle of Talikota]] in 1565 by a confederacy of [[Deccan sultanates]]. Subsequently, as the Vijayanagara Empire went into decline after the mid-16th century, many local rulers, called [[Nayak dynasty|Nayaks]], succeeded in gaining the trappings of independence. This eventually resulted in the further weakening of the empire; many Nayaks declared themselves independent, among whom the [[Nayaks of Madurai]] and Tanjore were the first to declare their independence, despite initially maintaining loose links with the Vijayanagara kingdom.{{sfn|Sastri|1970|pp=18\u2013182}} The Nayaks of Madurai and [[Nayaks of Thanjavur]] were the most prominent Nayaks of the 17th century.

The fall of the Vijayanagara empire and the Chandragiri Nayakas gave the [[sultanate of Golconda]] a chance to expand into the Tamil heartland. When the sultanate was incorporated into the Mughal Empire in 1688, the northern part of current-day Tamil Nadu was administrated by the [[nawab of the Carnatic]], who had his seat in [[Arcot]] from 1715 onward. Meanwhile, to the south, the fall of the [[Thanjavur Nayaks]] led to a short-lived [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom]]. The fall of the [[Madurai Nayaks]] brought up many small Nayakars of southern Tamil Nadu, who ruled small parcels of land called Palayams. The chieftains of these Palayams were known as [[Palaiyakkarar]] (or 'polygar' as called by British) and were ruling under the nawabs of the Carnatic.\n\n[[File:Fort Dansborg.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Fort Dansborg]] at [[Tharangambadi]] built by the [[Danes|Danish]]]]\nEuropeans started to establish trade centres during the 17th century in the eastern coastal regions.

In 1969, Madras State was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning \"Tamil country\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Migrant women and urban labour market: concepts and case studies |page=105 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=uMlVGtjbcSIC&pg=PA105&dq=madras+state+became+Tamilnadu#v=onepage&q=madras%20state%20became%20Tamilnadu&f=false|isbn=9788176299664 |last1=Sundari |first1=Dr. S. |year=2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Tamil Nadu topo deutsch mit Gebirgen.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Topographic map of Tamil Nadu]]\n[[File:Western Ghats Gobi.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Western Ghats]] traverse along the western border of Tamil Nadu]]\nTamil Nadu covers an area of {{convert|130058|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and is the tenth largest state in India. The bordering states are [[Kerala]] to the west, [[Karnataka]] to the north west and [[Andhra Pradesh]] to the north. To the east is the [[Bay of Bengal]] and the state encircles the [[union territory]] of [[Puducherry]]. The southernmost tip of the Indian Peninsula is [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]] which is the meeting point of the [[Arabian Sea]], the Bay of Bengal, and the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe western, southern and the northwestern parts are hilly and rich in vegetation. The [[Western Ghats]] and the [[Eastern Ghats]] meet at the [[Nilgiri hills]]. The Western Ghats traverse the entire western border with Kerala, effectively blocking much of the rain bearing clouds of the south west monsoon from entering the state. The eastern parts are fertile coastal plains and the northern parts are a mix of hills and plains. The central and the south central regions are arid plains and receive less rainfall than the other regions.\n\nTamil Nadu has the country's third longest [[Coastline of Tamil Nadu|coastline]] at about {{convert|906.9|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mha1.nic.in/par2013/par2013-pdfs/ls-300413/498.pdf|title=Indian States by Coastline|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828221126/http://mha1.nic.in/par2013/par2013-pdfs/ls-300413/498.pdf|archive-date=28 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Tamil Nadu's coastline bore the brunt of the 2004 [[Indian Ocean tsunami]] when it hit India, which caused 7,793 direct deaths in the state. Tamil Nadu falls mostly in a region of low seismic hazard with the exception of the western border areas that lie in a low to moderate hazard zone; as per the 2002 Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) map, Tamil Nadu falls in zones II and III. Historically, parts of this region have experienced seismic activity in the M5.0 range.{{sfn|Amateur Seismic Centre|2007}}\n\n=== Climate ===\nTamil Nadu is mostly dependent on monsoon rains, and thereby is prone to droughts when the monsoons fail. The climate of the state ranges from dry sub-humid to semi-arid. The state has two distinct periods of rainfall:\n* [[Monsoon|South west monsoon]] from June to September, with strong southwest winds;\n* [[Monsoon#Late in Year|North east monsoon]] from October to December, with dominant northeast winds;\n\nThe annual rainfall of the state is about {{convert|945|mm|in|abbr=on}} of which 48 per cent is through the north east monsoon, and 32 percent through the south west monsoon. Since the state is entirely dependent on rains for recharging its water resources, monsoon failures lead to acute [[water scarcity]] and severe drought.{{sfn|UN, system of organisations|2012}} Tamil Nadu is divided into seven agro-climatic zones: north east, north west, west, southern, high rainfall, high altitude hilly, and [[Kaveri]] Delta (the most fertile agricultural zone).\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n{{Main|Wildlife of Tamil Nadu|List of birds of Tamil Nadu}}\nThere are about 2,000 species of wildlife that are native to Tamil Nadu. Protected areas provide safe habitat for large mammals including [[Indian elephant|elephants]], [[Bengal tiger|tigers]], [[Indian leopard|leopards]], [[Dhole|wild dogs]], [[sloth bear]]s, [[gaur]]s, [[lion-tailed macaque]]s, [[Nilgiri langur]]s, [[Nilgiri tahr]]s, [[grizzled giant squirrel]]s and [[sambar deer]], resident and migratory birds such as [[cormorant]]s, [[darter]]s, [[heron]]s, [[egret]]s, [[Asian openbill stork|open-billed storks]], [[spoonbill]]s and [[black-headed ibis|white ibises]], [[little grebe]]s, [[common moorhen#Eurasian common moorhen|Indian moorhen]], [[black-winged stilt]]s, a few migratory [[duck]]s and occasionally [[Pelecanus philippensis|grey pelicans]], marine species such as the [[dugong]]s, turtles, dolphins, ''[[Balanoglossus]]'' and a wide variety of fish and insects.\n\nIndian [[Angiosperm]] diversity comprises 17,672 species with Tamil Nadu leading all states in the country, with 5640 species accounting for 1/3 of the total flora of India. This includes 1,559 species of [[medicinal plant]]s, 533 [[endemism|endemic]] species, 260 species of wild relatives of cultivated plants and 230 [[red-listed]] species. The [[gymnosperm]] diversity of the country is 64 species of which Tamil Nadu has four indigenous species and about 60 introduced species. The [[Pteridophyte]]s diversity of India includes 1,022 species of which Tamil Nadu has about 184 species. Vast numbers of [[bryophyte]]s, [[lichen]], fungi, [[algae]] and bacteria are among the wild plant diversity of Tamil Nadu.\n\nCommon plant species include the state tree: [[Borassus flabellifer#Cultural symbolism|palmyra palm]], [[eucalyptus]], rubber, [[cinchona]], clumping bamboos (''[[Bambusa]] arundinacea''), [[Tectona grandis|common teak]], ''[[Anogeissus latifolia]]'', [[Terminalia tomentosa|Indian laurel]], [[grewia]], and blooming trees like [[Cassia fistula|Indian labumusum]], [[ardisia]], and [[solanaceae]]. Rare and unique plant life includes ''Combretum ovalifolium'', [[ebony]] (''Diospyros nilagrica''), ''[[Habenaria]] rariflora'' (orchid), ''[[Cyathea sect. Alsophila|Alsophila]]'', ''[[Impatiens]] elegans'', ''[[Ranunculus]] reniformis'', and [[Osmunda regalis|royal fern]].{{sfn|Biodiversity of Tamil Nadu|2012}}\n\n== National and state parks ==\n[[File:Elephants in wild.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve]] has the largest elephant population in India.]]\n{{Main|Protected areas of Tamil Nadu}}\nTamil Nadu has a wide range of [[biomes]] extending east from the [[South Western Ghats montane rain forests]] in the [[Western Ghats]] through the [[South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests]] and [[Deccan thorn scrub forests]] to [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forests]] and then to the beaches, [[estuaries]], [[salt marsh]]es, [[mangrove]]s, [[seagrass]]es and [[coral reef]]s of the [[Bay of Bengal]].\nThe state has a range of flora and fauna with many species and habitats. To protect this diversity of wildlife there are [[Protected areas]] of Tamil Nadu as well as [[Biosphere reserves of India|biospheres]] which protect larger areas of natural habitat often include one or more national parks. The [[Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve]] established in 1986 is a marine ecosystem with seaweed seagrass communities, coral reefs, salt marshes and mangrove forests. The [[Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve]] located in the [[Western Ghats]] and [[Nilgiri Hills]] comprises part of adjoining states of Kerala and Karnataka. The [[Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve]] is in the south west of the state bordering Kerala in the Western Ghats.

The main party in Tamil Nadu at that time was the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC). [[List of political parties in India|Regional parties]] have dominated state politics since 1916. One of the earliest regional parties, the South Indian Welfare Association, a forerunner to [[Dravidian parties]] in Tamil Nadu, was started in 1916. The party was called after its English organ, [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], by its opponents. Later, [[South Indian Liberal Federation]] was adopted as its official name. The reason for victory of the Justice Party in elections was the non-participation of the INC, demanding complete independence of India.\n\nThe Justice Party which was under [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|E. V. Ramasamy]] was renamed [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] in 1944. It was a non-political party which demanded the establishment of an independent state called [[Dravida Nadu]]. However, due to the differences between its two leaders E. V. Ramasamy and [[C. N. Annadurai]], the party was split.\n\n=== Post-Independence ===\nC. N. Annadurai left the party Dravida Kazhagam to form the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK). The DMK decided to enter politics in 1956. After the demise of C. N. Annadurai, [[M. Karunanidhi]] became the leader of the party which was supported by majority leaders including then famous actor [[M. G. Ramachandran]]. As a breakaway faction of the DMK. In 1972, M. G. Ramachandran founded the new dravidan party [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK) named after his political mentor C. N. Annadurai popularly called \"Anna\".\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Historical populations\n| align = right\n| region =collapsed\n| 1951| 30119000\n| 1961| 33687000\n| 1971| 41199000\n| 1981| 48408000\n| 1991| 55859000\n| 2001| 62406000\n| 2011| 72138958\n| footnote=Source:Census of India{{sfn|Census population|2011}}\n}}\n{{Main|Demographics of Tamil Nadu}}\nTamil Nadu is the seventh most populous state in India. 48.4 per cent of the state's population live in urban areas, the third highest percentage among large [[States and union territories of India|states in India]].

Bras are designed for a variety of purposes, including enhancing a woman's breast size, creating [[decolletage|cleavage]] or for other aesthetic, fashion or more practical considerations. [[Swimsuit]]s, [[camisole]]s, and [[backless dress]]es may have built-in breast support with supportive bra cups. [[Nursing bra]]s are designed to facilitate [[breastfeeding]]. Some women have a medical and surgical need for brassieres, but most women wear them for fashion or cultural reasons. There is no evidence that bras really prevent breasts from [[Ptosis (breasts)|sagging]].\n\nBras have gained importance beyond their mere functionality as a garment.  Women's choices about what kind of bra to wear are consciously and unconsciously affected by social perceptions of the ideal [[female body shape]], which changes over time. Bras have become a fashion item and cultural statement that are sometimes purposefully revealed by the wearer or even worn as outerwear. \n\nBras are complex garments made of many parts. Manufacturing standards assume idealized, standard breast shapes and sizes that don't match most women's bodies. Companies use vanity sizes, influencing women to purchase sizes that give the impression they are slimmer or more buxom. In addition, international manufacturing standards and measurement methods vary widely. Due to these challenges, women have a hard time finding a correctly fitting bra. When they do find one that appears to fit, their tendency is continuing wearing the same bra size despite weight gain or loss. All of these factors result in up to 85 percent of those women who wear bras choosing and wearing the wrong size.<ref name=KingJune2005>{{cite news |last=King |first=Stephanie |date=1 June 2005 |title=Doreen: The Bra That Conquered the World |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/doreen-the-bra-that-conquered-the-world-492762.html |work=The Independent |access-date=8 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004084753/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/doreen-the-bra-that-conquered-the-world-492762.html |archive-date=4 October 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{sfn|Wood|Cameron|Fitzgerald|2008}} Due to the difficulty in finding a correctly fitting bra, a majority of women commonly experience discomfort while wearing a bra.\n\nSome women have protested societal expectations and sometimes school and workplace [[dress code]]s that require women to wear support garments. As early as 1873, the author [[Elizabeth Stuart Phelps]] advocated that women burn their corsets. This was echoed in 1968 at the [[Miss America protest|protest during the Miss America pageant]] when women symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a large trash can. A reporter conflated their protest with Vietnam-era men who [[Draft-card burning|burned their draft cards]], creating the [[Trope (philosophy)|trope]] of bra-burning feminists.\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Soutien des seine par une brassiere.jpg|thumb|upright|Bodice ({{lang-fr|brassi\u00e8re}}) from 1900]]\n\nThe term ''brassiere'', from French ''brassi\u00e8re'', was used by the ''Evening Herald'' in Syracuse, New York, in 1893.<ref>{{Cite news|newspaper=Evening Herald |title=Empire Corset |location=Syracuse |date = March 1893|quote=Still of course the short-waisted gowns mean short-waisted corsets and those ladies who wish to be in the real absolute fashion are adopting for evening wear the six-inch straight boned band or ''brassiere'' which Sarah Bernhardt made a necessity with her directoire gowns.}}</ref> It gained wider acceptance in 1904 when the DeBevoise Company used it in their advertising copy\u2014although the word is actually Norman French for a child's undershirt.

{{IPA-fr|b\u0281asj\u025b\u0281|lang}}), is a [[form-fitting]] [[undergarment]] designed to support or cover the wearer's [[breast]]s. Bras are designed for a variety of purposes, including enhancing a woman's breast size, creating [[decolletage|cleavage]] or for other aesthetic, fashion or more practical considerations. [[Swimsuit]]s, [[camisole]]s, and [[backless dress]]es may have built-in breast support with supportive bra cups. [[Nursing bra]]s are designed to facilitate [[breastfeeding]]. Some women have a medical and surgical need for brassieres, but most women wear them for fashion or cultural reasons. There is no evidence that bras really prevent breasts from [[Ptosis (breasts)|sagging]].\n\nBras have gained importance beyond their mere functionality as a garment.  Women's choices about what kind of bra to wear are consciously and unconsciously affected by social perceptions of the ideal [[female body shape]], which changes over time. Bras have become a fashion item and cultural statement that are sometimes purposefully revealed by the wearer or even worn as outerwear. \n\nBras are complex garments made of many parts. Manufacturing standards assume idealized, standard breast shapes and sizes that don't match most women's bodies. Companies use vanity sizes, influencing women to purchase sizes that give the impression they are slimmer or more buxom. In addition, international manufacturing standards and measurement methods vary widely. Due to these challenges, women have a hard time finding a correctly fitting bra. When they do find one that appears to fit, their tendency is continuing wearing the same bra size despite weight gain or loss. All of these factors result in up to 85 percent of those women who wear bras choosing and wearing the wrong size.<ref name=KingJune2005>{{cite news |last=King |first=Stephanie |date=1 June 2005 |title=Doreen: The Bra That Conquered the World |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/doreen-the-bra-that-conquered-the-world-492762.html |work=The Independent |access-date=8 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004084753/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/doreen-the-bra-that-conquered-the-world-492762.html |archive-date=4 October 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{sfn|Wood|Cameron|Fitzgerald|2008}} Due to the difficulty in finding a correctly fitting bra, a majority of women commonly experience discomfort while wearing a bra.\n\nSome women have protested societal expectations and sometimes school and workplace [[dress code]]s that require women to wear support garments. As early as 1873, the author [[Elizabeth Stuart Phelps]] advocated that women burn their corsets. This was echoed in 1968 at the [[Miss America protest|protest during the Miss America pageant]] when women symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a large trash can. A reporter conflated their protest with Vietnam-era men who [[Draft-card burning|burned their draft cards]], creating the [[Trope (philosophy)|trope]] of bra-burning feminists.\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Soutien des seine par une brassiere.jpg|thumb|upright|Bodice ({{lang-fr|brassi\u00e8re}}) from 1900]]\n\nThe term ''brassiere'', from French ''brassi\u00e8re'', was used by the ''Evening Herald'' in Syracuse, New York, in 1893.<ref>{{Cite news|newspaper=Evening Herald |title=Empire Corset |location=Syracuse |date = March 1893|quote=Still of course the short-waisted gowns mean short-waisted corsets and those ladies who wish to be in the real absolute fashion are adopting for evening wear the six-inch straight boned band or ''brassiere'' which Sarah Bernhardt made a necessity with her directoire gowns.}}</ref> It gained wider acceptance in 1904 when the DeBevoise Company used it in their advertising copy\u2014although the word is actually Norman French for a child's undershirt.

Griffiths |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QI0eAQAAMAAJ |page=609 |accessdate=December 29, 2014}}</ref> During the conquest of the Sambians by the [[Teutonic Knights]] in 1255, Twangste was destroyed and replaced with a new fortress named ''K\u00f6nigsberg'' in the honour of [[Bohemia]]n king [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottokar II]]. The declining Old Prussian culture finally became extinct around the 17th century, after the surviving Old Prussians were integrated through assimilation.\n\n===K\u00f6nigsberg===\n{{Main|K\u00f6nigsberg}}\nThe settlement on the site of present-day Kaliningrad was founded as a military fortress in 1255 after the [[Prussian Crusade]] by the [[Teutonic Knights]] against [[Old Prussians|Baltic Prussians]]. The new settlement was named in honour of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]] [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|King Ottokar II]]. The crusade was followed by immigrant settlers from Germany and other regions of Western Europe. The city and surrounding area became predominantly German, with [[Poles|Polish]], [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvians|Latvian]] minorities.\n\nAfter the [[secularization]] of the Teutonic Order in 1525, K\u00f6nigsberg became the capital of the [[Duchy of Prussia]], a fiefdom of the Polish king. As a symbol of its dependence, the black Prussian eagle had a crown thrust around its neck bearing the letter \"S\" from the Latinised name of the king, \"Sigismundus\". In 1618 the Duchy of Prussia passed under the control of the [[Electors of Brandenburg]] and in 1657 it became a sovereign state independent of the Polish king, controlled in personal union with Brandenburg (usually referred to as Brandenberg-Prussia). From 1701, Brandenberg-Prussia became a Kingdom and the entire area was referred to as the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. While the Brandenberg portion was a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and later the [[German Confederation]], Prussia (later called East Prussia) was not included within those territorial boundaries.\n\nIn the ensuing two centuries the city, first as part of the Kingdom of Prussia, then from 1866 as part of the [[North German Confederation]], and then from 1871 as part of the [[German Empire]], continued to flourish and many iconic landmarks of K\u00f6nigsberg were built. The city had around 370,000 inhabitants and was a cultural and administrative center of Prussia and the German Empire. [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], the notable sons of the city, were born during this time.\n\n===World War II===\nIn [[World War II]] the city of [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] was heavily damaged by a [[Bombing of K\u00f6nigsberg in World War II|British bombing attack]] in 1944 and the [[Battle of K\u00f6nigsberg|massive Soviet siege in spring 1945]]. At the end of World War II in 1945, the city became part of the [[Soviet Union]] (as part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]]).\n\n===Soviet Union===\nAt the [[Potsdam Conference]] in 1945 the Allies agreed on the Soviet annexation pending the final determination of territorial questions at the peace settlement:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe Conference has agreed in principle to the proposal of the Soviet Government concerning the ultimate transfer to the Soviet Union of the City of Koenigsberg and the area adjacent to it as described above subject to expert examination of the actual frontier.<ref>\n[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945Berlinv02/d1383 Protocol of the Proceedings of the Berlin Conference]\n</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Harry S.

The surviving German population was [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|forcibly expelled]] in 1946&ndash;1949, and the city was repopulated with Soviet citizens. The city's language of administration was changed from [[German language|German]] to [[Russian language|Russian]].\n\nThe city was rebuilt, and as the westernmost territory of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] became a strategically important area during the [[Cold War]].

The building was rebuilt after the war using earlier plans for the theatre and opened in 1960. The colonnade in front of the entrance was modelled after the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in [[Moscow]].\n\nThe regionally notable [[Kaliningrad Puppet Theatre]] has had its seat since 1975 in the Queen Louise Remembrance Church.

The new city centre is concentrated around [[Victory Square, Kaliningrad|Victory Square]]. The [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Kaliningrad)|Cathedral of Christ the Savior]], consecrated in 2005, is located on that square.\n\nThe oldest building in Kaliningrad is the [[Juditten Church]] (built before 1288). Also worth seeing are the former [[K\u00f6nigsberg Stock Exchange|Stock Exchange]], the surviving churches, and the remaining city gates. In counter-clockwise order these gates are: the [[Sackheim Gate]], [[King's Gate (Kaliningrad)|King's Gate]], [[Rossgarten Gate]], Attack Gate ({{lang-de|Ausfallstor}}, or Sally Port), Railway Gate (''Eisenbahntor''), [[Brandenburg Gate (Kaliningrad)|Brandenburg Gate]], and Friedland Gate (''{{Interlanguage link multi|Friedl\u00e4nder Tor (Kaliningrad)|de}}'').

The statue was destroyed in 1945, but was remoulded in 1992 on the initiative of [[Marion D\u00f6nhoff]], a native East Prussian who became prominent in the West. Also worth seeing is the Cosmonaut monument, which honours the Kaliningrad cosmonauts [[Alexey Leonov|Alexei Leonov]], [[Yuri Romanenko]] and [[Aleksandr Viktorenko]]. Other statues and monuments include the statue for Duke Albert, the statue for [[Friedrich Schiller]], the statue for Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], [[Vladimir Vysotsky]], the \"Mother Russia\" monument, and the Monument for the 1200 Guardsmen, remembering the [[Battle of K\u00f6nigsberg]].\n\n===Parks===\nKaliningrad is a \"green\" city {{citation needed|date=September 2017}} with a large number of parks and areas with lots of trees and lawns. Parks range from tiny city squares to massive parks.\n\nYouth Recreation Park is one of the well known and popular parks in the city. The park was established in the '20s-'30s in the English style.

It is located in the quiet area of the city, in Leningradsky area, and is connected to the Lower Pond. Youth Recreation Park provides entertainment for all age groups. There is also Interpersonal Communications Development Central located in the park. Its beautiful building became a popular backdrop for wedding pictures.\n\nThe [[Kaliningrad Zoo]] was opened as the K\u00f6nigsberg Zoo in 1896. The collection, which extends over 16.5 [[hectare|ha]], comprises 315 species with a total of 2,264 individual animals ({{As of|2005|lc=y}}). The Kaliningrad Zoo is also an [[arboretum]].\n\n===Ponds===\nCentrally located in the city is [[Lower Pond (Kaliningrad)|Lower Pond]], an artificial lake.

Only two of the structures from his era survive.\n\n=== Kaliningrad Arena ===\nIn 2018, a new stadium, Kaliningrad Arena, was built on the [[Oktyabrsky Island]], near the embankment of the Staraya Pregolya River.  The stadium has a seating capacity of 35,000.\n\n==Geography==\nKaliningrad is at the mouth of the navigable [[Pregolya River]], which empties into the [[Vistula Lagoon]], an inlet of the [[Baltic Sea]].\n\nSea vessels can access [[Gda\u0144sk Bay]]/[[Bay of Danzig]] and the [[Baltic Sea]] by way of the Vistula Lagoon and the [[Strait of Baltiysk]].\n\nUntil around 1900, ships drawing more than {{convert|2|m|sp=us}} of water could not pass the bar and come into town;{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} larger vessels had to anchor at Pillau (now [[Baltiysk]]), where cargo was transferred to smaller vessels.

It is the successor to the [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg|Albertina]], which was the old university of K\u00f6nigsberg founded in 1544, and whose faculty included noted scholars as [[Abraomas Kulvietis]], [[Stanislovas Rapalionis]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Jan Mikulicz-Radecki]].\n\n===Music===\nThe modern city of Kaliningrad is home to the [[Kaliningrad Regional Philharmonic and Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Ngelik|Lik]] male [[Choir|chamber choir]] and the [[Garmonika]] [[Music of Russia|Russian music]] ensemble,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kommersant.com/tree.asp?rubric=5&node=386&doc_id=-43 |title=Russia's Daily Online |publisher=Kommersant |accessdate=2009-06-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831131022/http://www.kommersant.com/tree.asp?rubric=5&node=386&doc_id=-43 |archivedate=August 31, 2009 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> as well as the [[Kaliningrad Chamber Orchestra]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.classicstoday.com/review.asp?ReviewNum=1983 |title=Shostakovich & Schnittke Concertos |publisher=Classicstoday.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-31}}</ref>\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Koenigsberger.jpg|thumb|[[K\u00f6nigsberger Klopse]] are a [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]]n specialty of [[meatball]]s in a [[white sauce]] with [[caper]]s that can be found in many restaurants in Kaliningrad.]]\n\nKaliningrad has its own vodka and beer brands, ''Stari K\u00f6nigsberg'' and ''Ostmark'' respectively. Since the early 1990s many new restaurants have opened in the city. These restaurants offer culinary specialities of former [[East Prussia]], like [[K\u00f6nigsberger Klopse]], but also many fish and salad dishes, Italian pizza and sushi, which is as popular in Kaliningrad as in the rest of Russia. K\u00f6nigsberger Fleck, a bovine tripe soup and yet another culinary specialty from former K\u00f6nigsberg, no longer belongs to the culinary culture of Kaliningrad.\n\nThe people of Kaliningrad generally imported their respective culinary traditions to the region when they settled in the area after 1945. [[Borscht]] and [[okroshka]] may be served as in the rest of Russia. Many Italian and Asian restaurants (or fusions of both traditions) are in operation all over the city. Pizza and sushi are among the most popular dishes today. Fast food is widely available from various chains, including those of foreign origin. [[Shawarma]] is also gaining considerable prominence.\n\n==Transportation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Kaliningrad 05-2017 img36 South railway station.jpg|thumb|[[Kaliningrad Railway station]]]]\n[[File:TramKaliningrad.jpg|thumb|Tramway in Kaliningrad]]\n\n[[Khrabrovo Airport]], {{convert|24|km|sp=us}} north of Kaliningrad, has scheduled and charter services to several destinations throughout Europe. There is the smaller [[Kaliningrad Devau Airport]] for general aviation. Kaliningrad is also home to [[Kaliningrad Chkalovsk]] naval air base.\n\nIn [[Baltiysk]], one can take a ferry to [[Saint Petersburg|St.&nbsp;Petersburg]], [[Stockholm]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Riga]], and [[Kiel]].\n\nKaliningrad's international railway station is [[Kaliningrad Railway station|Kaliningrad Juzhnyi]], which in German times was known as K\u00f6nigsberg Hauptbahnhof. Trains depart in the directions of [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Adler Microdistrict|Adler]] and [[Chelyabinsk]]. A unique feature of the Kaliningrad railway is that some tracks in the direction of Poland and Berlin have a [[standard gauge]] track parallel to the Russian [[broad gauge]] of 1520&nbsp;mm, used mostly for strategic reasons during the [[Cold War]] and nowadays for goods traffic. Platform number 6 at the Passazhirsky station can be reached on standard gauge over the former Ostbahn main line from Elbing ([[Elbl\u0105g]]) making passenger traffic from Poland possible, although there are no direct trains as of 2019.\n\n[[File:Kaliningrad_RZD_2019.png|thumb|Rail network in Kaliningrad Oblast]]\n\nRegional trains also depart from [[Kaliningrad North railway station|Kaliningrad-North]], the former K\u00f6nigsberg Nordbahnhof, which is situated on Victory Square, the current city center. Trains depart to [[Zelenogradsk]] and [[Svetlogorsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Svetlogorsk]] several times a day. There are also daily connections to other towns in the region, like [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Sovetsk]], [[Baltijsk]], [[Mamonovo]], [[Chernyakhovsk]]. The lines to the Zelenogradsk and Svetlogorsk have been electrified. Many local pre-war lines have been broken up or are no longer in use, because the new border with Poland disrupted the former traffic flows.\n\nIn 1881, the [[Trams in Kaliningrad|K\u00f6nigsberg tramway system]] was opened, and it still functions to this day. In 1975, a trolleybus system was also introduced.\n<gallery>\nFile:KaliningradBusVictorysquare.jpg|Mercedes-Benz bus.

Manufacturers based there get tax and [[Customs|customs duty]] breaks on the goods they send to other parts of Russia. Although corruption was an early deterrent, that policy means the region is now a manufacturing hub. One in three televisions in Russia are made in Kaliningrad (including Ericsson brand by Telebalt Ltd. and Polar by an eponymous firm located in the city of  [[Chernyakhovsk]]) and it is home to [[Cadillac]] and [[BMW]] related car plants (produced by [[Avtotor]]). Currently, Kaliningrad's major industries are manufacturing, shipping, fishing and amber products. In 2006, Moscow declared it would turn the region into \"the Russian [[Hong Kong]]\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Sheeter |first=Laura |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6048708.stm |title='Kaliningrad erases stains of past' 16 October 2006 |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-10-16 |accessdate=2013-12-21}}</ref>\n\nThe [[European Commission]] provides funds for business projects under its special programme for Kaliningrad.

It was the headquarters of the former Soviet [[Baltic Military District]]. Kaliningrad also functions as the headquarters of Russia's [[Baltic Fleet]], ringed by [[Chernyakhovsk (air base)]], [[Donskoye (air base)]] and [[Kaliningrad Chkalovsk]] (naval air base).\n\n===Soviet era===\nAccess and control to the [[Baltic Sea]] was imperative because of Soviet perceptions that this meant that the hegemonic power had \"influence on European and global affairs\". Russia had replaced [[Sweden]] as the hegemon since the 18th century, but during the late 19th and early 20th century it was increasingly ousted by Germany's growing naval power.<ref>{{cite book |last=Knudsen |first=Olav F. |title=Stability and Security in the Baltic Sea Region |year=1999 |publisher=Frank Cass & Co.

Therefore, the population of the city was fluid and almost always temporary. Many military officers and their families would refer to the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] as \"the West\". The [[Soviet Union]] also kept nuclear weapons for use in case a war occurred.<ref>{{cite book |last=Krickus |first=Richard |title=The Kaliningrad Question |year=2002 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. |location=Lanham, Maryland |page=42}}</ref>\n\n===Russian era===\nAs it is the westernmost geography and a uniquely isolated area of Russia, Kaliningrad is clearly still a militarily strategic stronghold that is politically sensitive as well.

At the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]], Kaliningrad's population was 431,902.<ref name=\"2010Census\"/>\n\nSituated between [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]], both now in the [[European Union]], Kaliningrad was strategically of importance during the [[Cold War]]. Following the ''de facto'' annexation of the territory, Soviet authorities built a new city that erased most historic links to the old city. In some districts, a few pre-war monuments remain.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Timeline of Kaliningrad}}\n\nThe history of the city may be divided into three periods: the [[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]] settlement known as ''Twangste'' before 1255; the [[Germany|German]] city of ''K\u00f6nigsberg'' from 1255 to 1945; the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|Russian city]] from 1945. In 1946 the settlement was renamed ''Kaliningrad'' in honour of the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Kalinin]] and was largely re-populated with ethnic Russians.\n\n===Twangste===\n[[File:Prussian clans 13th century.png|thumb|left|[[Old Prussian]] clans in the 13th century (Sambia - orange)]]\n\nK\u00f6nigsberg was preceded by a [[Sambians|Sambian]] ([[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]] tribe) fort called ''Twangste'' (spelled also as ''Tuwangste'' or ''Tvankste''), meaning Oak Forest.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book |title=The Monthly Review |date=1836 |publisher=R. Griffiths |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QI0eAQAAMAAJ |page=609 |accessdate=December 29, 2014}}</ref> During the conquest of the Sambians by the [[Teutonic Knights]] in 1255, Twangste was destroyed and replaced with a new fortress named ''K\u00f6nigsberg'' in the honour of [[Bohemia]]n king [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottokar II]]. The declining Old Prussian culture finally became extinct around the 17th century, after the surviving Old Prussians were integrated through assimilation.\n\n===K\u00f6nigsberg===\n{{Main|K\u00f6nigsberg}}\nThe settlement on the site of present-day Kaliningrad was founded as a military fortress in 1255 after the [[Prussian Crusade]] by the [[Teutonic Knights]] against [[Old Prussians|Baltic Prussians]]. The new settlement was named in honour of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]] [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|King Ottokar II]]. The crusade was followed by immigrant settlers from Germany and other regions of Western Europe. The city and surrounding area became predominantly German, with [[Poles|Polish]], [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvians|Latvian]] minorities.\n\nAfter the [[secularization]] of the Teutonic Order in 1525, K\u00f6nigsberg became the capital of the [[Duchy of Prussia]], a fiefdom of the Polish king. As a symbol of its dependence, the black Prussian eagle had a crown thrust around its neck bearing the letter \"S\" from the Latinised name of the king, \"Sigismundus\". In 1618 the Duchy of Prussia passed under the control of the [[Electors of Brandenburg]] and in 1657 it became a sovereign state independent of the Polish king, controlled in personal union with Brandenburg (usually referred to as Brandenberg-Prussia). From 1701, Brandenberg-Prussia became a Kingdom and the entire area was referred to as the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. While the Brandenberg portion was a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and later the [[German Confederation]], Prussia (later called East Prussia) was not included within those territorial boundaries.\n\nIn the ensuing two centuries the city, first as part of the Kingdom of Prussia, then from 1866 as part of the [[North German Confederation]], and then from 1871 as part of the [[German Empire]], continued to flourish and many iconic landmarks of K\u00f6nigsberg were built. The city had around 370,000 inhabitants and was a cultural and administrative center of Prussia and the German Empire. [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[E. T. A.

The surviving German population was [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|forcibly expelled]] in 1946&ndash;1949, and the city was repopulated with Soviet citizens. The city's language of administration was changed from [[German language|German]] to [[Russian language|Russian]].\n\nThe city was rebuilt, and as the westernmost territory of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] became a strategically important area during the [[Cold War]].

The building, which has noted acoustics, functions as an organ hall since re-opening in 1980.\n\nThe [[Kaliningrad Regional Drama Theatre]] is located in the former K\u00f6nigsberg Neues Schauspielhaus, which was opened in 1910. The building was rebuilt after the war using earlier plans for the theatre and opened in 1960. The colonnade in front of the entrance was modelled after the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in [[Moscow]].\n\nThe regionally notable [[Kaliningrad Puppet Theatre]] has had its seat since 1975 in the Queen Louise Remembrance Church. This neo-romantic church, designed by architect Fritz Heitmann, was built in 1901.\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Kaliningrad 05-2017 img18 Kings Gate.jpg|thumb|[[King's Gate (Kaliningrad)|King's Gate]]]]\n[[File:Kaliningrad 05-2017 img40 Friedrichsburg Gate.jpg|thumb|[[Friedrichsburg Gate]]]]\n\nThe pre-war city center (Altstadt and Kneiphof) currently consists of parks, broad avenues, a square on the site of the former K\u00f6nigsberg Castle, and two buildings: the [[House of Soviets (Kaliningrad)|House of Soviets]] (\"Dom Sovyetov\"), roughly on the site of the former castle, and the restored [[K\u00f6nigsberg Cathedral]] on the Kneiphof island (now \"Kant island\"). Immanuel Kant's grave is situated next to the cathedral. Many German-era buildings in the historic city centre have been preserved and even rebuilt, including the reconstruction of the [[K\u00f6nigsberg Synagogue]]. The new city centre is concentrated around [[Victory Square, Kaliningrad|Victory Square]]. The [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Kaliningrad)|Cathedral of Christ the Savior]], consecrated in 2005, is located on that square.\n\nThe oldest building in Kaliningrad is the [[Juditten Church]] (built before 1288). Also worth seeing are the former [[K\u00f6nigsberg Stock Exchange|Stock Exchange]], the surviving churches, and the remaining city gates. In counter-clockwise order these gates are: the [[Sackheim Gate]], [[King's Gate (Kaliningrad)|King's Gate]], [[Rossgarten Gate]], Attack Gate ({{lang-de|Ausfallstor}}, or Sally Port), Railway Gate (''Eisenbahntor''), [[Brandenburg Gate (Kaliningrad)|Brandenburg Gate]], and Friedland Gate (''{{Interlanguage link multi|Friedl\u00e4nder Tor (Kaliningrad)|de}}''). Apart from the already mentioned Dohna Tower, which houses the Amber Museum, the Wrangel Tower also remains as a reminder of the former K\u00f6nigsberg city walls. Only the gate of the former [[Fort Friedrichsburg]] remains.\n\n===Monuments===\n[[File:Kant Kaliningrad.jpg|thumb|upright|Recast [[Immanuel Kant]] statue]]\n\nNotable monuments include the statue of [[Immanuel Kant]] in front of the [[Immanuel Kant State University of Russia]]. The statue was made by notable sculptor [[Christian Daniel Rauch]] and unveiled in 1864. The statue was destroyed in 1945, but was remoulded in 1992 on the initiative of [[Marion D\u00f6nhoff]], a native East Prussian who became prominent in the West. Also worth seeing is the Cosmonaut monument, which honours the Kaliningrad cosmonauts [[Alexey Leonov|Alexei Leonov]], [[Yuri Romanenko]] and [[Aleksandr Viktorenko]]. Other statues and monuments include the statue for Duke Albert, the statue for [[Friedrich Schiller]], the statue for Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], [[Vladimir Vysotsky]], the \"Mother Russia\" monument, and the Monument for the 1200 Guardsmen, remembering the [[Battle of K\u00f6nigsberg]].\n\n===Parks===\nKaliningrad is a \"green\" city {{citation needed|date=September 2017}} with a large number of parks and areas with lots of trees and lawns. Parks range from tiny city squares to massive parks.\n\nYouth Recreation Park is one of the well known and popular parks in the city. The park was established in the '20s-'30s in the English style. It reopened its doors post war and was popular among citizens in the '80s-'90s with its beautiful boat house and tennis courts, as well as merry-go-rounds.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.park-unost.ru/park-news |title=\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438! \u0410\u043d\u043e\u043d\u0441\u044b! \u0410\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438! {{!}} \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a \"\u042e\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\", \u0433.\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434|website=www.park-unost.ru|access-date=2017-08-18}}</ref> The park had a massive reconstruction in 2004 adding to the park a cafe, carting, and various modern entertainments. It is located in the quiet area of the city, in Leningradsky area, and is connected to the Lower Pond. Youth Recreation Park provides entertainment for all age groups. There is also Interpersonal Communications Development Central located in the park. Its beautiful building became a popular backdrop for wedding pictures.\n\nThe [[Kaliningrad Zoo]] was opened as the K\u00f6nigsberg Zoo in 1896. The collection, which extends over 16.5 [[hectare|ha]], comprises 315 species with a total of 2,264 individual animals ({{As of|2005|lc=y}}). The Kaliningrad Zoo is also an [[arboretum]].\n\n===Ponds===\nCentrally located in the city is [[Lower Pond (Kaliningrad)|Lower Pond]], an artificial lake. Lower Pond is surrounded by a promenade and is an area for recreation especially in summer. North of the Lower Pond is the larger [[Upper Pond (Kaliningrad)|Upper Pond]] in northern Kaliningrad.\n\n===Bridges===\n[[Leonhard Euler]]'s 1736 paper on the puzzle of the [[Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg]] was a seminal work in the fields of [[graph theory]] and [[topology]]. Only two of the structures from his era survive.\n\n=== Kaliningrad Arena ===\nIn 2018, a new stadium, Kaliningrad Arena, was built on the [[Oktyabrsky Island]], near the embankment of the Staraya Pregolya River.  The stadium has a seating capacity of 35,000.\n\n==Geography==\nKaliningrad is at the mouth of the navigable [[Pregolya River]], which empties into the [[Vistula Lagoon]], an inlet of the [[Baltic Sea]].\n\nSea vessels can access [[Gda\u0144sk Bay]]/[[Bay of Danzig]] and the [[Baltic Sea]] by way of the Vistula Lagoon and the [[Strait of Baltiysk]].\n\nUntil around 1900, ships drawing more than {{convert|2|m|sp=us}} of water could not pass the bar and come into town;{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} larger vessels had to anchor at Pillau (now [[Baltiysk]]), where cargo was transferred to smaller vessels.

Average temperatures range from {{convert|-1.5|to|+18.1|C|F|abbr=on}} and rainfall varies from {{convert|36.0|mm|sp=us}}/month to {{convert|97.0|mm|sp=us}}/month. In general, it has [[oceanic climate|maritime climate]] influences and therefore damp, variable and mild, with vast temperature differences between July and January.\n\nThe seasons are clearly differentiated. Spring starts in March and is initially cold and windy, later becoming pleasantly warm and often very sunny. Summer, which begins in June, is predominantly warm but hot at times (with temperature reaching as high as {{convert|+30|-|+35|C}} at least once per year) with plenty of sunshine interspersed with heavy rain.

It is the successor to the [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg|Albertina]], which was the old university of K\u00f6nigsberg founded in 1544, and whose faculty included noted scholars as [[Abraomas Kulvietis]], [[Stanislovas Rapalionis]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Jan Mikulicz-Radecki]].\n\n===Music===\nThe modern city of Kaliningrad is home to the [[Kaliningrad Regional Philharmonic and Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Ngelik|Lik]] male [[Choir|chamber choir]] and the [[Garmonika]] [[Music of Russia|Russian music]] ensemble,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kommersant.com/tree.asp?rubric=5&node=386&doc_id=-43 |title=Russia's Daily Online |publisher=Kommersant |accessdate=2009-06-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831131022/http://www.kommersant.com/tree.asp?rubric=5&node=386&doc_id=-43 |archivedate=August 31, 2009 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> as well as the [[Kaliningrad Chamber Orchestra]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.classicstoday.com/review.asp?ReviewNum=1983 |title=Shostakovich & Schnittke Concertos |publisher=Classicstoday.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-31}}</ref>\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Koenigsberger.jpg|thumb|[[K\u00f6nigsberger Klopse]] are a [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]]n specialty of [[meatball]]s in a [[white sauce]] with [[caper]]s that can be found in many restaurants in Kaliningrad.]]\n\nKaliningrad has its own vodka and beer brands, ''Stari K\u00f6nigsberg'' and ''Ostmark'' respectively. Since the early 1990s many new restaurants have opened in the city. These restaurants offer culinary specialities of former [[East Prussia]], like [[K\u00f6nigsberger Klopse]], but also many fish and salad dishes, Italian pizza and sushi, which is as popular in Kaliningrad as in the rest of Russia. K\u00f6nigsberger Fleck, a bovine tripe soup and yet another culinary specialty from former K\u00f6nigsberg, no longer belongs to the culinary culture of Kaliningrad.\n\nThe people of Kaliningrad generally imported their respective culinary traditions to the region when they settled in the area after 1945. [[Borscht]] and [[okroshka]] may be served as in the rest of Russia. Many Italian and Asian restaurants (or fusions of both traditions) are in operation all over the city. Pizza and sushi are among the most popular dishes today. Fast food is widely available from various chains, including those of foreign origin. [[Shawarma]] is also gaining considerable prominence.\n\n==Transportation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Kaliningrad 05-2017 img36 South railway station.jpg|thumb|[[Kaliningrad Railway station]]]]\n[[File:TramKaliningrad.jpg|thumb|Tramway in Kaliningrad]]\n\n[[Khrabrovo Airport]], {{convert|24|km|sp=us}} north of Kaliningrad, has scheduled and charter services to several destinations throughout Europe. There is the smaller [[Kaliningrad Devau Airport]] for general aviation. Kaliningrad is also home to [[Kaliningrad Chkalovsk]] naval air base.\n\nIn [[Baltiysk]], one can take a ferry to [[Saint Petersburg|St.&nbsp;Petersburg]], [[Stockholm]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Riga]], and [[Kiel]].\n\nKaliningrad's international railway station is [[Kaliningrad Railway station|Kaliningrad Juzhnyi]], which in German times was known as K\u00f6nigsberg Hauptbahnhof. Trains depart in the directions of [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Adler Microdistrict|Adler]] and [[Chelyabinsk]]. A unique feature of the Kaliningrad railway is that some tracks in the direction of Poland and Berlin have a [[standard gauge]] track parallel to the Russian [[broad gauge]] of 1520&nbsp;mm, used mostly for strategic reasons during the [[Cold War]] and nowadays for goods traffic. Platform number 6 at the Passazhirsky station can be reached on standard gauge over the former Ostbahn main line from Elbing ([[Elbl\u0105g]]) making passenger traffic from Poland possible, although there are no direct trains as of 2019.\n\n[[File:Kaliningrad_RZD_2019.png|thumb|Rail network in Kaliningrad Oblast]]\n\nRegional trains also depart from [[Kaliningrad North railway station|Kaliningrad-North]], the former K\u00f6nigsberg Nordbahnhof, which is situated on Victory Square, the current city center. Trains depart to [[Zelenogradsk]] and [[Svetlogorsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Svetlogorsk]] several times a day. There are also dayly connections to other towns in the region, like [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Sovetsk]], [[Baltijsk]], [[Mamonovo]], [[Chernyakhovsk]]. The lines to the Zelenogradsk and Svetlogorsk have been electrified. Many local pre-war lines have been broken up or are no longer in use, because the new border with Poland disrupted the former traffic flows.\n\nIn 1881, the [[Trams in Kaliningrad|K\u00f6nigsberg tramway system]] was opened, and it still functions to this day. In 1975, a trolleybus system was also introduced.\n<gallery>\nFile:KaliningradBusVictorysquare.jpg|Mercedes-Benz bus.

Manufacturers based there get tax and [[Customs|customs duty]] breaks on the goods they send to other parts of Russia. Although corruption was an early deterrent, that policy means the region is now a manufacturing hub. One in three televisions in Russia are made in Kaliningrad (including Ericsson brand by Telebalt Ltd. and Polar by an eponymous firm located in the city of  [[Chernyakhovsk]]) and it is home to [[Cadillac]] and [[BMW]] related car plants (produced by [[Avtotor]]). Currently, Kaliningrad's major industries are manufacturing, shipping, fishing and amber products. In 2006, Moscow declared it would turn the region into \"the Russian [[Hong Kong]]\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Sheeter |first=Laura |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6048708.stm |title='Kaliningrad erases stains of past' 16 October 2006 |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-10-16 |accessdate=2013-12-21}}</ref>\n\nThe [[European Commission]] provides funds for business projects under its special programme for Kaliningrad.

It was the headquarters of the former Soviet [[Baltic Military District]]. Kaliningrad also functions as the headquarters of Russia's [[Baltic Fleet]], ringed by [[Chernyakhovsk (air base)]], [[Donskoye (air base)]] and [[Kaliningrad Chkalovsk]] (naval air base).\n\n===Soviet era===\nAccess and control to the [[Baltic Sea]] was imperative because of Soviet perceptions that this meant that the hegemonic power had \"influence on European and global affairs\". Russia had replaced [[Sweden]] as the hegemon since the 18th century, but during the late 19th and early 20th century it was increasingly ousted by Germany's growing naval power.<ref>{{cite book |last=Knudsen |first=Olav F. |title=Stability and Security in the Baltic Sea Region |year=1999 |publisher=Frank Cass & Co.

Therefore, the population of the city was fluid and almost always temporary. Many military officers and their families would refer to the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] as \"the West\". The [[Soviet Union]] also kept nuclear weapons for use in case a war occurred.<ref>{{cite book |last=Krickus |first=Richard |title=The Kaliningrad Question |year=2002 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. |location=Lanham, Maryland |page=42}}</ref>\n\n===Russian era===\nAs it is the westernmost geography and a uniquely isolated area of Russia, Kaliningrad is clearly still a militarily strategic stronghold that is politically sensitive as well.

A line from Steely Dan's \"My old school\" refers to Bard College located in Annandale-on-Hudson. Donald Fagen and Walter Becker attended the ritzy liberal arts school Bard College in upstate New York in the '60s, and the pair have been publicly mocking the school ever since. \"My Old School\" is the pair's most overt song about their alma mater, a sarcastically chipper-sounding remembrance of the time Becker and Fagen, along with several dozen other students, found themselves caught up in a trumped-up drug raid during an election cycle. (The local Assistant District Attorney who orchestrated the publicity stunt was a gent named G. Gordon Liddy, who of course got some first-hand experience with the U.S. prison system himself after the Watergate break-in.) Delivered in a giddy schoolboy tone, the chorus is by far the most effective on the entire Countdown to Ecstasy album, but the real meat of the song comes in the extended instrumental passages, where a pair of spiky Jeff Baxter guitar solos (the second of which is downright eccentric in its rhythm and strangled tone) are counterpointed by Fagen's piano and a swinging horn section. The single was a comparative flop, but \"My Old School\" has since become a fan favorite and a centerpiece of the Steely Dan live show\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:GraveHannahArendt..jpg|[[Hannah Arendt]]'s gravestone from the [[Bard College]] cemetery\n</gallery>\n\n{{Commons category|Annandale-on-Hudson, New York}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Great Houses of the Hudson River'', [[Michael Middleton Dwyer]], editor, with preface by [[Mark Rockefeller]], Boston, MA: [[Little, Brown and Company]], published in association with [[Historic Hudson Valley]], 2001. {{ISBN|082122767X}}.\n\n{{Dutchess County, New York}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hamlets in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Red Hook, New York]]\n[[Category:Annandale-on-Hudson, New York| ]]\n[[Category:Poughkeepsie\u2013Newburgh\u2013Middletown metropolitan area]]\n[[Category:Hamlets in Dutchess County, New York]]\n[[Category:Populated places on the Hudson River]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name            = Annandale-on-Hudson, New York\n|settlement_type          = [[Hamlet (New York)|Hamlet]]\n|nickname                 = \n|motto                    = \n<!-- Images -->\n|image_skyline            = \n|imagesize                = \n|image_caption            = \n|image_flag               = \n|image_seal               = \n<!-- Maps -->\n|image_map                = \n|mapsize                  = \n|map_caption              = \n|image_map1               = \n|mapsize1                 = \n|map_caption1             = \n|pushpin_map              = New York\n|pushpin_label            = Annandale-on-Hudson\n|pushpin_map_caption      = Location in New York state\n<!-- Location -->\n|subdivision_type         = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name         = United States\n|subdivision_type1        = [[U.S. state|State]]\n|subdivision_name1        = [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|subdivision_type2        = [[List of counties in New York|County]]\n|subdivision_name2        = [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess]]\n|subdivision_type3        = [[Town (New York)|Town]]\n|subdivision_name3        = [[Red Hook, New York|Red Hook]]\n|government_footnotes     = \n|government_type          = \n|leader_title             = \n|leader_name              = \n|leader_title1            = \n|leader_name1             = \n|established_title        = \n|established_date         = \n<!-- Area -->\n|area_footnotes           = \n|area_magnitude           = \n|area_total_km2           = \n|area_land_km2            = \n|area_water_km2           = \n|area_total_sq_mi         = \n|area_land_sq_mi          = \n|area_water_sq_mi         = \n<!-- Population -->\n|population_as_of         = [[United States Census, 2000|2000]]\n|population_footnotes     = \n|population_total         =\n|population_density_km2   =\n|population_density_sq_mi =\n<!-- General information -->\n|timezone                 = [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern (EST)]]\n|utc_offset               = -5\n|timezone_DST             = EDT\n|utc_offset_DST           = -4\n|elevation_footnotes      = \n|elevation_m              = \n|elevation_ft             = 154\n|coordinates              = {{coord|42|0|46.08|N|73|54|29.52|W|region:US-NY_type:city|display=inline,title}}\n<!-- Area/postal codes & others -->\n|postal_code_type         = [[ZIP code]]\n|postal_code              = 12504\n|area_code                = [[Area code 845|845]]\n|blank_name               = [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS code]]\n|blank_info               = \n|blank1_name              = [[Geographic Names Information System|GNIS]] feature ID\n|blank1_info              = 942492 <ref name=gnis>{{GNIS|942492}}</ref>\n|website                  = \n|footnotes                = \n}}\n\n'''Annandale-on-Hudson''' is a [[Hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] in [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States, in the [[Hudson Valley]] in the town of [[Red Hook, New York|Red Hook]], across the [[Hudson River]] from [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]].\n\nThe hamlet consists almost entirely of the [[Bard College]] campus.\n\n==Municipal services==\n[[Emergency services]] at Annandale-on-Hudson are provided by the municipal Red Hook Police Department, the Dutchess County Sheriff's Office, [[New York State Police]], Red Hook Volunteer Fire Company, and [[Tivoli, New York|Tivoli]] Volunteer Fire Company. Students, faculty, and staff of Bard College also receive on-campus emergency assistance from Bard College Safety and Security and the student-run Bard EMS.\n\n==History==\nThe town takes its name from an estate donated by [[John Bard]] and his wife to [[Columbia University]] so that a college could be formed there. Today, [[Bard College]] stands on the land that John Bard donated. Bard College houses the only post office for Annandale-on-Hudson's [[ZIP code]], 12504. The land comprising Annandale-on-Hudson, sometimes shortened to just \"Annandale\", is primarily owned by Bard College, though there are a few private residences, some small businesses, and undeveloped land controlled by the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]].\n\nDespite its tiny geographic coverage, there is significant history rooted in Annandale-on-Hudson. [[Blithewood]], a mansion originally designed by Francis L. V. Hoppin, an alumnus of the architectural firm of [[McKim, Mead & White|McKim, Mead and White]] for [[Andrew C. Zabriskie]] in 1899, replaced an earlier mansion by the same name remodeled for [[Robert Donaldson Jr.]] by architect [[Alexander Jackson Davis]].<ref name=\"bard\">{{cite web |title=Robert Donaldson (1800\u20131872) {{!}} Cultivating a Taste for Scenery |url=https://omekalib.bard.edu/exhibits/show/scenery/robert-donaldson |website=omekalib.bard.edu |publisher=Stevenson Library Digital Collections |accessdate=3 April 2019}}</ref> The current Blithewood was donated to Bard College in 1951 by the Zabriskie family and, today, houses the [[Levy Economics Institute]] at Bard College.
