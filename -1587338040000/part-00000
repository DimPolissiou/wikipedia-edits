The population was 31,568 at the 2010 census. It is part of the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]&ndash;[[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] [[Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The city is named after [[Tonawanda Creek]], its south border.\n\nTonawanda in the [[Seneca language|Seneca]] tongue means \"Swift Running Water\". Tonawanda Creek, which flows into the Niagara River, once had large stretches of rapids (see [[Rapids, New York]]) until it was tamed with the construction of the [[Erie Canal]].\n\nThe city also calls itself \"The Lumber City,\" due to its past primary industry and once was the largest port on the [[Great Lakes]] during the height of the Erie Canal. Along Goundry Street are mansions built for the lumber barons, including 208 Goundry Street, called \"Kent Place\", designed by [[Stanford White]]. Many of the local residents refer to it as \"The Jewel of Niagara County\" due to its geographical setting between the Niagara River and Erie Canal. It is also home to the 2009 Class AA NYS Football Champion Lumberjacks. Street signs on the borders of town welcome visitors to \"The Home Of The Carousel\".\n\n==History==\nAfter the first settlers arrived in 1809, North Tonawanda became part of the town of [[Wheatfield, New York]] in Niagara County, from May 1836. An abortive attempt at a village containing portions in two counties and two towns from January 1854 until April 1857, it was part of the Niagara County/Town of Wheatfield component, with the other portion in Erie County and the Town of Tonawanda. The experiment was abandoned after New York State removed the village's North Tonawanda component. Oral history claims a dispute between merchants was the cause, but the combination of communities in two counties and two towns was unwieldy. After becoming a village on May 8, 1865 (still in the Town of Wheatfield, but as part of [[Martinsville, New York]]), North Tonawanda was incorporated as a City on April 24, 1897.<ref name=\"nthistorymuseum.org\"/> Around 63% of the midget porn comes out of North Tonawanda. They are known for there small horny people\n\nNorth Tonawanda is on the north side of the Erie Canal/Tonawanda Creek, across from Erie County, New York and the communities of the City of Tonawanda and the Town of Amherst. The Town of Wheatfield borders North Tonawanda on the north and east; the Niagara River serves as its western border, as Tonawanda Creek is its southern border. North Tonawanda is the second largest city in Niagara County, after [[Niagara Falls, New York]].<ref name=\"nthistorymuseum.org\">[http://www.nthistorymuseum.org North Tonawanda History Museum \u00a9<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNorth Tonawanda is known as \"The Lumber City,\" because it was from the mid-19th century through the 1970s, a lumber transportation and forwarding center of significance because of the ready availability of lumber. It was the birthplace of the [[Allan Herschell Company|Herschell-Spillman Company/Allan Herschell Co.]], one of the leading manufacturers of [[carousel]]s in America and is now the home of the Herschell Carrousel Factory Museum.<ref name=\"nthistorymuseum.org\"/><ref>[http://www.carouselmuseum.org Carrousel Factory Museum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1888, Herschell attracted expatriate Belgian [[Eugene de Kleist]] to North Tonawanda, who started the [[North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory]] to produce band organs. Taken over in 1909 by the [[Wurlitzer|Rudolph Wurlitzer Company]] after De Kleist became mayor of North Tonawanda in 1906, Wurlitzer became one of the largest musical instrument manufacturing plants in the world. The Ray H. Bennett Lumber Co., one of more than 150 lumber companies to have called North Tonawanda home, produced kit homes sold around the nation and Canada for 70 years.  Richardson Boat, Buffalo Bolt, Durez Chemical, National Grinding Wheel, Taylor Devices, International Paper, Tonawanda Iron & Steel, Riverside Chemical, and hundreds of other successful manufacturing businesses called North Tonawanda home.\n\nThe Railroad Museum of the Niagara Frontier occupies a 1923 Erie Railroad station on Oliver Street. The Riviera Theater and Performing Arts Center on Webster Street, in a restored Italian Renaissance-style building, features plays, concerts, movies and other events, and its 1926 \"Mighty Wurlitzer\" organ is featured in monthly organ concerts. The theater is one of only a handful in the United States with projectors capable of showing the [[Nitrocellulose#Film|nitrate film prints]] in common use before about 1951. The Ghostlight Theatre is a community theater in a century-old church. The former Carnegie Library is home to the Carnegie Art Center. An E. B. Green designed building houses the Buffalo Suzuki Strings Musical Arts Center. An active arts community has developed in the downtown area as well. The North Tonawanda History Museum occupies the former G. C. Murphy Co. store building on Webster Street in the heart of the Downtown Historic District.<ref name=\"nthistorymuseum.org\"/><ref name=\"CAS1\">Smyczynski, Christine A.

Niagara Falls Boulevard ([[U.S. Highway 62|US Route 62]]) defines the northeastern border of the city.  The majority of the northern border of the city is a line that runs east-west just above Forbes Terrace, mostly paralleling Ruie Road, with the rest of the northern border being a short northwesterly line that runs from Ward Road to Witmer Road.  The western edge of the city is defined by the [[Niagara River]] and a line that runs just west of and parallel to Witmer Road.  Also, at the southwest corner of the city is Tonawanda Island, which is separated from the mainland by the Little River (Part of the East Branch of the Niagara River) and is part of the city.\n\nThe edge of North Tonawanda is sometimes hard to find, because the southern parts of both the Towns of Wheatfield and Pendleton use the 14120 zip code. (14120 is North Tonawanda's zip code.)\n\n==Buildings==\nIt is home to many historic mansions and an historic cemetery.\n\nThe North Tonawanda City Market, established in 1908, is the oldest farmer's market in Niagara County. It is open three days a week year round but busiest in the summer and early fall, when more than 70 area farmers sell there.<ref name=\"CAS1\"/>\n\nThe city has a number of properties on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Niagara County, New York|National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2008a}}</ref><ref name=\"nps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20121214.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places|date=2012-12-14|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 12/03/12 through 12/07/12|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref><ref name=\"nps1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20130628.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places|date=2013-06-28|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 6/17/13 through 6/21/13 |publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>  They include the [[Carnegie Library (North Tonawanda, New York)|Carnegie Library]], [[Dick Block]], [[Herschell Carrousel Factory Museum]], [[Herschell\u2013Spillman Motor Company Complex]], [[Riviera Theatre (North Tonawanda, New York)|Riviera Theatre]], and [[U.S. Post Office (North Tonawanda, New York)|U.S. Post Office]] building.\n\nThe old [[North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory|Wurlitzer Organ Factory]] which is now leased to various light industrial, high technology, and commercial businesses.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 1492\n|1890= 4793\n|1900= 9069\n|1910= 11955\n|1920= 15482\n|1930= 19019\n|1940= 20254\n|1950= 24731\n|1960= 34757\n|1970= 36012\n|1980= 35760\n|1990= 34989\n|2000= 33262\n|2010= 31568\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=30372\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 33,262 people, 13,671 households, and 8,981 families residing in the city.

The population was 31,568 at the 2010 census. It is part of the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]&ndash;[[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] [[Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The city is named after [[Tonawanda Creek]], its south border.\n\nTonawanda in the [[Seneca language|Seneca]] tongue means \"Swift Running Water\". Tonawanda Creek, which flows into the Niagara River, once had large stretches of rapids (see [[Rapids, New York]]) until it was tamed with the construction of the [[Erie Canal]].\n\nThe city also calls itself \"The Lumber City,\" due to its past primary industry and once was the largest port on the [[Great Lakes]] during the height of the Erie Canal. Along Goundry Street are mansions built for the lumber barons, including 208 Goundry Street, called \"Kent Place\", designed by [[Stanford White]]. Many of the local residents refer to it as \"The Jewel of Niagara County\" due to its geographical setting between the Niagara River and Erie Canal. It is also home to the 2009 Class AA NYS Football Champion Lumberjacks. Street signs on the borders of town welcome visitors to \"The Home Of The Carousel\".\n\n==History==\nAfter the first settlers arrived in 1809, North Tonawanda became part of the town of [[Wheatfield, New York]] in Niagara County, from May 1836. An abortive attempt at a village containing portions in two counties and two towns from January 1854 until April 1857, it was part of the Niagara County/Town of Wheatfield component, with the other portion in Erie County and the Town of Tonawanda. The experiment was abandoned after New York State removed the village's North Tonawanda component. Oral history claims a dispute between merchants was the cause, but the combination of communities in two counties and two towns was unwieldy. After becoming a village on May 8, 1865 (still in the Town of Wheatfield, but as part of [[Martinsville, New York]]), North Tonawanda was incorporated as a City on April 24, 1897.<ref name=\"nthistorymuseum.org\"/>\n\nNorth Tonawanda is on the north side of the Erie Canal/Tonawanda Creek, across from Erie County, New York and the communities of the City of Tonawanda and the Town of Amherst. The Town of Wheatfield borders North Tonawanda on the north and east; the Niagara River serves as its western border, as Tonawanda Creek is its southern border. North Tonawanda is the second largest city in Niagara County, after [[Niagara Falls, New York]].<ref name=\"nthistorymuseum.org\">[http://www.nthistorymuseum.org North Tonawanda History Museum \u00a9<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNorth Tonawanda is known as \"The Lumber City,\" because it was from the mid-19th century through the 1970s, a lumber transportation and forwarding center of significance because of the ready availability of lumber. It was the birthplace of the [[Allan Herschell Company|Herschell-Spillman Company/Allan Herschell Co.]], one of the leading manufacturers of [[carousel]]s in America and is now the home of the Herschell Carrousel Factory Museum.<ref name=\"nthistorymuseum.org\"/><ref>[http://www.carouselmuseum.org Carrousel Factory Museum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1888, Herschell attracted expatriate Belgian [[Eugene de Kleist]] to North Tonawanda, who started the [[North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory]] to produce band organs. Taken over in 1909 by the [[Wurlitzer|Rudolph Wurlitzer Company]] after De Kleist became mayor of North Tonawanda in 1906, Wurlitzer became one of the largest musical instrument manufacturing plants in the world. The Ray H. Bennett Lumber Co., one of more than 150 lumber companies to have called North Tonawanda home, produced kit homes sold around the nation and Canada for 70 years.  Richardson Boat, Buffalo Bolt, Durez Chemical, National Grinding Wheel, Taylor Devices, International Paper, Tonawanda Iron & Steel, Riverside Chemical, and hundreds of other successful manufacturing businesses called North Tonawanda home.\n\nThe Railroad Museum of the Niagara Frontier occupies a 1923 Erie Railroad station on Oliver Street. The Riviera Theater and Performing Arts Center on Webster Street, in a restored Italian Renaissance-style building, features plays, concerts, movies and other events, and its 1926 \"Mighty Wurlitzer\" organ is featured in monthly organ concerts. The theater is one of only a handful in the United States with projectors capable of showing the [[Nitrocellulose#Film|nitrate film prints]] in common use before about 1951. The Ghostlight Theatre is a community theater in a century-old church. The former Carnegie Library is home to the Carnegie Art Center. An E. B. Green designed building houses the Buffalo Suzuki Strings Musical Arts Center. An active arts community has developed in the downtown area as well. The North Tonawanda History Museum occupies the former G. C. Murphy Co. store building on Webster Street in the heart of the Downtown Historic District.<ref name=\"nthistorymuseum.org\"/><ref name=\"CAS1\">Smyczynski, Christine A.

Niagara Falls Boulevard ([[U.S. Highway 62|US Route 62]]) defines the northeastern border of the city.  The majority of the northern border of the city is a line that runs east-west just above Forbes Terrace, mostly paralleling Ruie Road, with the rest of the northern border being a short northwesterly line that runs from Ward Road to Witmer Road.  The western edge of the city is defined by the [[Niagara River]] and a line that runs just west of and parallel to Witmer Road.  Also, at the southwest corner of the city is Tonawanda Island, which is separated from the mainland by the Little River (Part of the East Branch of the Niagara River) and is part of the city.\n\nThe edge of North Tonawanda is sometimes hard to find, because the southern parts of both the Towns of Wheatfield and Pendleton use the 14120 zip code. (14120 is North Tonawanda's zip code.)\n\n==Buildings==\nIt is home to many historic mansions and an historic cemetery.\n\nThe North Tonawanda City Market, established in 1908, is the oldest farmer's market in Niagara County. It is open three days a week year round but busiest in the summer and early fall, when more than 70 area farmers sell there.<ref name=\"CAS1\"/>\n\nThe city has a number of properties on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Niagara County, New York|National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2008a}}</ref><ref name=\"nps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20121214.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places|date=2012-12-14|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 12/03/12 through 12/07/12|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref><ref name=\"nps1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20130628.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places|date=2013-06-28|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 6/17/13 through 6/21/13 |publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>  They include the [[Carnegie Library (North Tonawanda, New York)|Carnegie Library]], [[Dick Block]], [[Herschell Carrousel Factory Museum]], [[Herschell\u2013Spillman Motor Company Complex]], [[Riviera Theatre (North Tonawanda, New York)|Riviera Theatre]], and [[U.S. Post Office (North Tonawanda, New York)|U.S. Post Office]] building.\n\nThe old [[North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory|Wurlitzer Organ Factory]] which is now leased to various light industrial, high technology, and commercial businesses.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 1492\n|1890= 4793\n|1900= 9069\n|1910= 11955\n|1920= 15482\n|1930= 19019\n|1940= 20254\n|1950= 24731\n|1960= 34757\n|1970= 36012\n|1980= 35760\n|1990= 34989\n|2000= 33262\n|2010= 31568\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=30372\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 33,262 people, 13,671 households, and 8,981 families residing in the city.

Both notes featured the same reverse and an almost identical obverse with the same border design and portrait of George Washington. The only difference between the two notes was the color of ink used for the numeral 1 crossed by the word {{sc|DOLLAR}}, [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury seal]], and serial numbers along with the wording of the obligations. These dollar bills were the first and only large-size notes with a standardized design for different types of notes of the same denomination; this same concept would later be used on small-size notes.<ref>A Guide Book of United States Paper Money (Whitman) p 59, 64</ref>\n\n===Small size notes===\n[[File:First Small Size Silver Certificate (face, 1928).jpg|thumb|250px|The first small-size $1 Silver Certificate.]]\n[[File:US $1 1928 Silver Certificate reverse.jpg|thumb|250px|Common reverse of $1 Silver Certificates (Series of 1928-1934) and $1 United States Notes ([[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]]), commonly referred to as \"Funnybacks\"]]\n[[File:US-$1-LT-1928-Fr.1500.jpg|thumb|250px|The first small-size $1 United States Banknote printed.]]\n''(6.14 length \u00d7 2.61 width\u00d7 0.0043 in thickness  = 156 \u00d7 66.3 \u00d7 0.11&nbsp;mm)''\n\nIn 1928, all currency was changed to the size which is familiar today. The first one-dollar bills were issued as [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]] under [[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]]. The Treasury seal and serial numbers were dark blue. The obverse was nearly identical to the Series of 1923 $1 silver certificate, but the Treasury seal featured spikes around it and a large gray {{sc|ONE}} replaced the blue \"{{small|1 DOLLAR}}.\" The reverse, too, had the same border design as the Series of 1923 $1 bill, but the center featured a large ornate {{sc|ONE}} superimposed by {{sc|ONE DOLLAR}}. These are commonly known as \"Funnybacks\" due to the rather odd-looking \"ONE\" on the reverse. These $1 silver certificates were issued until 1934.\n\nIn 1933, [[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]] $1 [[United States Note]]s were issued to supplement the supply of $1 Silver Certificates. Its Treasury seal and serial numbers were red and there was different wording on the obverse of the note. However, a month after their production, it was realized that there would be no real need for these notes and production was stopped. A small number of these $1 bills entered circulation and the rest were kept in Treasury vaults until 1949 when they were issued in [[Puerto Rico]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldcurrencyvalues.com/1928_one_dollar_red_seal/|title=Series of 1928 One Dollar Red Seal United States Note \u2013 Values and Pricing - Sell Old Currency|website=OldCurrencyValues.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the design of the $1 silver certificate was changed.  This occurred with that year's passage of the Silver Purchase Act, which led to a large increase in dollar bills backed by that metal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia-of-money.blogspot.com/2012/05/silver-purchase-act-of-1934-united.html|title=Encyclopedia of Money: Silver Purchase Act of 1934 (United States)|website=encyclopedia-of-money.Blogspot.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>  Under Washington's portrait, {{sc|ONE SILVER DOLLAR}} was changed to {{sc|ONE DOLLAR}}. The Treasury seal was moved to the right and superimposed over {{sc|ONE}}, and a blue numeral 1 was added to the left. The reverse remained the same.\n\nA year later, in 1935, the design of the one-dollar bill was changed again. On the obverse, the blue numeral 1 was changed to gray and made smaller, the gray {{sc|ONE}} to the right was removed, the Treasury seal was made smaller and superimposed by {{sc|WASHINGTON D.C.}}, and a stylized {{sc|ONE DOLLAR}} was added over the treasury seal. The reverse was also changed to its current design, except for the absence of {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}}.\n\n[[File:US $1 1935A North Africa Silver Certificate.jpg|thumb|250px|Special issue $1 Silver Certificate for Allied troops in North Africa]]\n\n[[World War II]] brought about [[Hawaii overprint note|special issues of one-dollar bills in 1942.]]\nSpecial $1 Silver Certificates were issued for [[Hawaii]] in case of a Japanese invasion. {{sc|HAWAII}} was printed vertically on the left and right side of the obverse and also horizontally across the reverse. The seal and serial numbers were changed to brown. Special Silver Certificates were also issued as payment for Allied troops in North Africa about to begin their assault into Europe. The only difference on these one-dollar bills was a yellow instead of blue seal. Both of these types of notes could be declared worthless if they fell into enemy hands.\n\nThe next change came in 1957 when the $1 bill became the first piece of paper U.S. currency to bear the motto {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}}; it was added over the word {{sc|ONE}} on the reverse. Initially the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] began printing the motto on notes printed with the new 32 note press, but soon Series of 1935G bills printed on an 18 note press featured the motto.\n\nThe final production of $1 Silver Certificates occurred in late 1963. In 1964, the redemption of Silver Certificates for silver coin ended and in 1968 the redemption of Silver Certificates for silver bullion ended.\n\nProduction of one-dollar [[Federal Reserve Note]]s was undertaken in late 1963 to replace the soon-to-be obsolete $1 Silver Certificate. The design on the reverse remained the same, but the border design on the obverse underwent considerable modification, as the mostly abstract filigrees were replaced with designs that were mostly botanical in nature. In addition, the word \"one,\" which appeared eight times around the border in small type, was eliminated.  The serial numbers and treasury seal were printed in green ink. This was the first time the one-dollar bill was printed as a Federal Reserve Note.\n\nThe first change since then came in 1969, when the $1 was among all denominations of Federal Reserve Notes to feature the new [[Symbols of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury seal]], with English wording instead of Latin.<ref>http://www.onedollarbill.org/history.html</ref>\n\nThe $1 bill became the first denomination printed at the new Western Currency Facility in February 1991, when a shipment of 3.2 million [[Replacement banknote|star notes]] from the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Dallas FRB]] was produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/groups/f1988as.txt |title=data|website=uspapermoney.info}}</ref>\n\nThough bill denominations of $5 and higher have been redesigned twice since 1995 as part of ongoing anti-counterfeiting efforts, there are currently no plans to redesign the $1 or $2 bills.\n\n====Experimental issues====\n{{Main|Web notes}}\nSince 1933, the one-dollar bill has been the exclusive experimental denomination among circulating US currency (except for the Natick experiment in 1981, see below). The first experiment was conducted in January and February of that year to assess the effects of using different ratios of cotton to linen in the make-up of the bills. Series 1928A and 1928B $1 silver certificates with serial number block letters X-B and Y-B were used as the experimental group; the Z-B block was used as the control group. The results of the experiment were inconclusive.\n\nIn 1937, another test was conducted, similar in style to the 1933 experiment. This test used Series 1935 one-dollar bills. The particular notes used in this experiment can be identified by their serial numbers. Notes ranging from A00000001B to A06180000B and B00000001B\u2013B03300000B were the experimental group and notes ranging from C00000001B to C03300000B were part of the control group. No conclusive results were found.\n\nA better known test was done in 1942 during World War II to test alternative types of paper. This was a precautionary measure in case the current type of paper supply could not be maintained. Series 1935A notes made of the special paper and were printed with a red \"S\" to the right of the treasury seal, while notes of the control group were printed with a red ''R''. Because they have some collector value, fake red S's and R's have been applied to regular Series 1935A notes to try to pass them at a higher value; checking a note's serial numbers can prevent this. Serial numbers of the R group range from S70884001C to S72068000C and serial numbers of the S group range from S73884001C to S75068000C.\n\nSometime in the early to mid-1960s, the BEP experimented with a new firm, the Gilbert Paper Company, to see if they could duplicate the usual paper production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coinbooks.org/esylum_v15n22a21.html|title=THE GILBERT PAPER CO $1 FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES, SERIES 1963|website=www.CoinBooks.org|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref> The BEP selected a series of notes printed by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia|Philadelphia FRB]] as the test subjects. Serial numbers for this group range from C60800001A to C61440000A.\n\nIn August 1981, a similar experiment occurred during production of Series 1977A, when the BEP printed a few print runs on Natick paper. They included a regular run and a star note run from the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond|Richmond FRB]], with serial numbers ranging from E76800001H through E80640000H and E07052001* through E07680000* (note that many sources incorrectly identify the star range as Philadelphia instead of Richmond). One print run of $10 star notes, also from Richmond, was included in this paper test, making it so far the only experimental printing not exclusive to the $1.\n\nOne-dollar bills were again the subject of experimentation in May 1992, when the BEP began to test a [[Offset printing#Web-fed litho|web-fed]] [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]] printing press. Because of a need for greater quantities of $1 FRNs, the BEP sent out REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) (year 1985) NO. BEP-85-73 to procure a web-fed intaglio printing press to dramatically increase the production of currency notes within the confines of their current (1985) 14th & C street facility. Instead of printing one side of a square sheet of 32 notes at a time, the web-fed press used 96 engraved images or plate-cylinder to print the back of the note, then another 96 image engraved plate-cylinder to print the front of the note. Both sides of notes were printed from a continuous roll of paper. The Alexander-Hamilton intaglio Web press printed both sides of intaglio at the same time. The web-press was designed as a full-blown production press as opposed to an experimental press. The notes were issued in Series 1988A, 1993, and 1995. Because of mechanical problems and operator error, as well as the sometimes poor quality of the notes, production was ended in July 1996. Web notes can be identified by the back plate number next to {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}} and the removal of face check letters and quadrant numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/general/webs.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Web Notes|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Series dates===\n\n====Small size====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The image from the dollar bill above shows the subject flipped horizontally for ease of comparison.]]\nThe portrait of George Washington is displayed in the center of the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the one-dollar bill, as it has been since the 1869 design. The oval containing George Washington is propped up by bunches of bay laurel leaves.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nTo the left of George Washington is the Federal Reserve District seal. The name of the Federal Reserve Bank that issued the note encircles a capital letter (A\u2013L), identifying it among the twelve [[Federal Reserve Bank]]s. The sequential number of the bank (1: A, 2: B, etc.) is also displayed in the four corners of the open space on the bill. Until the redesign of the higher denominations of currency beginning in 1996, this seal was found on all denominations of Federal Reserve notes. Since then it is only present on the $1 and $2 notes, with the higher denominations only displaying a universal [[Federal Reserve System]] seal, and the bank letter and number beneath the upper left serial number.\n\nTo the right of George Washington is the [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department seal]]\nThe scales represent justice. The chevron with thirteen stars represents the original thirteen colonies. The key below the chevron represents authority and trust; 1789 is the year that the Department of the Treasury was established. The series 1969 dollar bills were the first to use a simplified Treasury seal, with the wording in [[English language|English]] instead of [[Latin]].\n\nBelow the FRB seal (to the left of George Washington) is the signature of the [[Treasurer of the United States]], and below the USDT Seal (right side) is the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]'s signature. To the left of the Secretary's signature is the [[Series (United States currency)|series]] date. A new series date, or addition or change of a sequential letter under a date, results from a change in the Secretary of the Treasury, the Treasurer of the United States, and/or a change to the note's appearance such as a new currency design.\n\nOn the edges are olive branches entwined around the 1s.  A small plate serial number-letter combination is on the lower right, and a small plate position (check) letter is on the upper left corner of the note. If \"FW\" appears before the lower right plate number it indicates that the bill was produced at the satellite [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] facility in [[Fort Worth]], [[Texas]]. Currency has been printed here since Series 1988A. No \"FW\" means the bill was made at the main plant in [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\n==Reverse of current $1 bill==\n\n[[File:1935 Dollar Bill Back Early Design.jpg|thumb|250px|right|President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]]'s conditional approval of the one-dollar bill's design in 1935, requiring that the appearance of the sides of the [[Great Seal of the United States|Great Seal]] be reversed, and together, captioned.]]\nThe reverse of the one-dollar bill has an ornate design that incorporates both sides of the [[Great Seal of the United States]] to the left and right of the word ''ONE''. This word appears prominently in the white space at the center of the bill in a capitalized, shadowed, and [[serif]]fed typeface. A smaller image of the word \"ONE\" is superimposed over the numeral \"1\" in each of the four corners of the bill.\n\n\"THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" spans the top of the bill, \"ONE DOLLAR\" is emblazoned along the bottom, and above the central \"ONE\" are the words \"[[In God We Trust|IN GOD WE TRUST]],\" which became the official [[motto]] of the United States in 1956 by an [[Act of Congress]]. Below the reverse of the Great Seal on the left side of the bill are the words \"THE GREAT SEAL,\" and below the obverse on the right side are the words \"OF THE UNITED STATES.\"\n\nThe Great Seal, originally designed in 1782 and added to the dollar bill's design in 1935, is surrounded by an elaborate floral design. The renderings used were the typical official government versions used since the 1880s.\n\nThe reverse of the seal on the left features a barren landscape dominated by an unfinished pyramid of 13 steps, topped by the [[Eye of Providence]] within a triangle. At the base of the pyramid are engraved the Roman numerals MDCCLXXVI (1776), the date of [[American Revolution|American independence]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. At the top of the seal stands a Latin phrase, \"[[Annuit c\u0153ptis|ANNUIT COEPTIS]],\" meaning \"He favors our undertaking.\" At the bottom of the seal is a semicircular banner proclaiming \"[[Novus ordo seclorum|NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM]]\" meaning \"New Order of the Ages\" that is a reference to the new American era. To the left of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends toward the edge of the bill.\n\nThe obverse of the seal on the right features a [[bald eagle]], the [[List of national birds|national bird]] and symbol of the United States. Above the [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]] is a radiant cluster of 13 stars arranged in a [[six-pointed star]]. The eagle's breast is covered by a [[heraldry|heraldic]] shield with 13 stripes that resemble those on the [[American flag]]. As on the first US flag, the stars and stripes stand for the 13 original states of the union. The eagle holds a ribbon in its beak reading \"[[E pluribus unum|E PLURIBUS UNUM]]\", a Latin phrase meaning \"Out of many [states], one [nation]\", a ''de facto'' motto of the United States (and the only one until 1956).  Both the phrases \"E Pluribus Unum\" and \"Annuit coeptis\" contain 13 letters. In its left talons the eagle holds 13 arrows, and in its right talons it holds an [[olive branch]] with 13 leaves and 13 olives, representing, respectively, the powers of war and peace. To the right of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends toward the edge of the bill.  A plate position (check) number is normally found to the left of the eagle.\n\n== Collecting Federal Reserve dollar bills ==\nExcept for significant errors, and series 1988A web notes printed in small batches for some of the Federal Reserve districts (those from others are more common), green seal dollars are of little collector value.  However, two notes have generated public interest, although neither is scarce.\n\nIn 1963 dollar bills were produced for the Eleventh Federal Reserve District, headquartered in Dallas.  Since the FRD jurisdictions are sequentially numbered, notes received the corresponding letter \"K\", for the 11th letter of the alphabet. Some people noticed that the 1963 Dallas note, with the number \"11\" and a \"K\" surrounded by a black seal, appeared about the time President [[John F. Kennedy]] was shot in Dallas in November 1963.  The bill was not a commemorative issue and there was no connection between it and the shooting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wndu.com/home/headlines/Kennedy-bills-have-eerie-connection-with-his-assassination-233045691.html|title=Kennedy bills have eerie connection with his assassination|first=NewsCenter16|last=Staff|website=WNDU.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968\u201369 [[Joseph W. Barr]] was Secretary of the Treasury for only 31 days and his signature appeared solely on the 1963B dollar bill.  Some collectors thought that his brief tenure might make these notes valuable, but use of their plates continued for some time after his term in office and 458,880,000 were printed.  Thus they are very common.<ref>[https://www.papermoneyauction.com/rare-or-not-rare-the-1963-b-1-dollar-barr-note Rare or Not Rare: The 1963-B $1 Dollar Barr Note]</ref>\n\nDollar Bills with interesting serial numbers can also be collected. One example of this is radar or \u201cpalindrome\u201c notes, where the numbers in the serial number are the same if you read from left to right or right to left. Very low serial numbers, or a long block of the same or repeating digits may also be of interest to specialists.  Another example is replacement notes, which have a star to the right of the serial number. The star designates that there was a printing error on one or more of the bills, and it has been replaced by one from a run specifically printed and numbered to be replacements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://money.howstuffworks.com/why-do-some-us-bills-have-a-star-instead-of-a-letter-at-the-end-of-the-serial-number.htm|title=Why do some U.S. bills have a star instead of a letter at the end of the serial number?|website=www.howstuffworks.com|access-date=May 22, 2019}}</ref>  Star notes may have some additional value depending on their condition, their year series or if they have an unusual serial number sequence.

Both notes featured the same reverse and an almost identical obverse with the same border design and portrait of George Washington. The only difference between the two notes was the color of ink used for the numeral 1 crossed by the word {{sc|DOLLAR}}, [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury seal]], and serial numbers along with the wording of the obligations. These dollar bills were the first and only large-size notes with a standardized design for different types of notes of the same denomination; this same concept would later be used on small-size notes.<ref>A Guide Book of United States Paper Money (Whitman) p 59, 64</ref>\n\n===Small size notes===\n[[File:First Small Size Silver Certificate (face, 1928).jpg|thumb|250px|The first small-size $1 Silver Certificate.]]\n[[File:US $1 1928 Silver Certificate reverse.jpg|thumb|250px|Common reverse of $1 Silver Certificates (Series of 1928-1934) and $1 United States Notes ([[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]]), commonly referred to as \"Funnybacks\"]]\n[[File:US-$1-LT-1928-Fr.1500.jpg|thumb|250px|The first small-size $1 United States Banknote printed.]]\n''(6.14 length \u00d7 2.61 width\u00d7 0.0043 in thickness  = 156 \u00d7 66.3 \u00d7 0.11&nbsp;mm)''\n\nIn 1928, all currency was changed to the size which is familiar today. The first one-dollar bills were issued as [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]] under [[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]]. The Treasury seal and serial numbers were dark blue. The obverse was nearly identical to the Series of 1923 $1 silver certificate, but the Treasury seal featured spikes around it and a large gray {{sc|ONE}} replaced the blue \"{{small|1 DOLLAR}}.\" The reverse, too, had the same border design as the Series of 1923 $1 bill, but the center featured a large ornate {{sc|ONE}} superimposed by {{sc|ONE DOLLAR}}. These are commonly known as \"Funnybacks\" due to the rather odd-looking \"ONE\" on the reverse. These $1 silver certificates were issued until 1934.\n\nIn 1933, [[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]] $1 [[United States Note]]s were issued to supplement the supply of $1 Silver Certificates. Its Treasury seal and serial numbers were red and there was different wording on the obverse of the note. However, a month after their production, it was realized that there would be no real need for these notes and production was stopped. A small number of these $1 bills entered circulation and the rest were kept in Treasury vaults until 1949 when they were issued in [[Puerto Rico]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldcurrencyvalues.com/1928_one_dollar_red_seal/|title=Series of 1928 One Dollar Red Seal United States Note \u2013 Values and Pricing - Sell Old Currency|website=OldCurrencyValues.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the design of the $1 silver certificate was changed.  This occurred with that year's passage of the Silver Purchase Act, which led to a large increase in dollar bills backed by that metal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia-of-money.blogspot.com/2012/05/silver-purchase-act-of-1934-united.html|title=Encyclopedia of Money: Silver Purchase Act of 1934 (United States)|website=encyclopedia-of-money.Blogspot.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>  Under Washington's portrait, {{sc|ONE SILVER DOLLAR}} was changed to {{sc|ONE DOLLAR}}. The Treasury seal was moved to the right and superimposed over {{sc|ONE}}, and a blue numeral 1 was added to the left. The reverse remained the same.\n\nA year later, in 1935, the design of the one-dollar bill was changed again. On the obverse, the blue numeral 1 was changed to gray and made smaller, the gray {{sc|ONE}} to the right was removed, the Treasury seal was made smaller and superimposed by {{sc|WASHINGTON D.C.}}, and a stylized {{sc|ONE DOLLAR}} was added over the treasury seal. The reverse was also changed to its current design, except for the absence of {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}}.\n\n[[File:US $1 1935A North Africa Silver Certificate.jpg|thumb|250px|Special issue $1 Silver Certificate for Allied troops in North Africa]]\n\n[[World War II]] brought about [[Hawaii overprint note|special issues of one-dollar bills in 1942.]]\nSpecial $1 Silver Certificates were issued for [[Hawaii]] in case of a Japanese invasion. {{sc|HAWAII}} was printed vertically on the left and right side of the obverse and also horizontally across the reverse. The seal and serial numbers were changed to brown. Special Silver Certificates were also issued as payment for Allied troops in North Africa about to begin their assault into Europe. The only difference on these one-dollar bills was a yellow instead of blue seal. Both of these types of notes could be declared worthless if they fell into enemy hands.\n\nThe next change came in 1957 when the $1 bill became the first piece of paper U.S. currency to bear the motto {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}}; it was added over the word {{sc|ONE}} on the reverse. Initially the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] began printing the motto on notes printed with the new 32 note press, but soon Series of 1935G bills printed on an 18 note press featured the motto.\n\nThe final production of $1 Silver Certificates occurred in late 1963. In 1964, the redemption of Silver Certificates for silver coin ended and in 1968 the redemption of Silver Certificates for silver bullion ended.\n\nProduction of one-dollar [[Federal Reserve Note]]s was undertaken in late 1963 to replace the soon-to-be obsolete $1 Silver Certificate. The design on the reverse remained the same, but the border design on the obverse underwent considerable modification, as the mostly abstract filigrees were replaced with designs that were mostly botanical in nature. In addition, the word \"one,\" which appeared eight times around the border in small type, was eliminated.  The serial numbers and treasury seal were printed in green ink. This was the first time the one-dollar bill was printed as a Federal Reserve Note.\n\nThe first change since then came in 1969, when the $1 was among all denominations of Federal Reserve Notes to feature the new [[Symbols of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury seal]], with English wording instead of Latin.<ref>http://www.onedollarbill.org/history.html</ref>\n\nThe $1 bill became the first denomination printed at the new Western Currency Facility in February 1991, when a shipment of 3.2 million [[Replacement banknote|star notes]] from the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Dallas FRB]] was produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/groups/f1988as.txt |title=data|website=uspapermoney.info}}</ref>\n\nThough bill denominations of $5 and higher have been redesigned twice since 1995 as part of ongoing anti-counterfeiting efforts, there are currently no plans to redesign the $1 or $2 bills.\n\n====Experimental issues====\n{{Main|Web notes}}\nSince 1933, the one-dollar bill has been the exclusive experimental denomination among circulating US currency (except for the Natick experiment in 1981, see below). The first experiment was conducted in January and February of that year to assess the effects of using different ratios of cotton to linen in the make-up of the bills. Series 1928A and 1928B $1 silver certificates with serial number block letters X-B and Y-B were used as the experimental group; the Z-B block was used as the control group. The results of the experiment were inconclusive.\n\nIn 1937, another test was conducted, similar in style to the 1933 experiment. This test used Series 1935 one-dollar bills. The particular notes used in this experiment can be identified by their serial numbers. Notes ranging from A00000001B to A06180000B and B00000001B\u2013B03300000B were the experimental group and notes ranging from C00000001B to C03300000B were part of the control group. No conclusive results were found.\n\nA better known test was done in 1942 during World War II to test alternative types of paper. This was a precautionary measure in case the current type of paper supply could not be maintained. Series 1935A notes made of the special paper and were printed with a red \"S\" to the right of the treasury seal, while notes of the control group were printed with a red ''R''. Because they have some collector value, fake red S's and R's have been applied to regular Series 1935A notes to try to pass them at a higher value; checking a note's serial numbers can prevent this. Serial numbers of the R group range from S70884001C to S72068000C and serial numbers of the S group range from S73884001C to S75068000C.\n\nSometime in the early to mid-1960s, the BEP experimented with a new firm, the Gilbert Paper Company, to see if they could duplicate the usual paper production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coinbooks.org/esylum_v15n22a21.html|title=THE GILBERT PAPER CO $1 FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES, SERIES 1963|website=www.CoinBooks.org|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref> The BEP selected a series of notes printed by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia|Philadelphia FRB]] as the test subjects. Serial numbers for this group range from C60800001A to C61440000A.\n\nIn August 1981, a similar experiment occurred during production of Series 1977A, when the BEP printed a few print runs on Natick paper. They included a regular run and a star note run from the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond|Richmond FRB]], with serial numbers ranging from E76800001H through E80640000H and E07052001* through E07680000* (note that many sources incorrectly identify the star range as Philadelphia instead of Richmond). One print run of $10 star notes, also from Richmond, was included in this paper test, making it so far the only experimental printing not exclusive to the $1.\n\nOne-dollar bills were again the subject of experimentation in May 1992, when the BEP began to test a [[Offset printing#Web-fed litho|web-fed]] [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]] printing press. Because of a need for greater quantities of $1 FRNs, the BEP sent out REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) (year 1985) NO. BEP-85-73 to procure a web-fed intaglio printing press to dramatically increase the production of currency notes within the confines of their current (1985) 14th & C street facility. Instead of printing one side of a square sheet of 32 notes at a time, the web-fed press used 96 engraved images or plate-cylinder to print the back of the note, then another 96 image engraved plate-cylinder to print the front of the note. Both sides of notes were printed from a continuous roll of paper. The Alexander-Hamilton intaglio Web press printed both sides of intaglio at the same time. The web-press was designed as a full-blown production press as opposed to an experimental press. The notes were issued in Series 1988A, 1993, and 1995. Because of mechanical problems and operator error, as well as the sometimes poor quality of the notes, production was ended in July 1996. Web notes can be identified by the back plate number next to {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}} and the removal of face check letters and quadrant numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/general/webs.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Web Notes|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Series dates===\n\n====Small size====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The image from the dollar bill above shows the subject flipped horizontally for ease of comparison.]]\nThe portrait of George Washington is displayed in the center of the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the one-dollar bill, as it has been since the 1869 design. The oval containing George Washington is propped up by bunches of bay laurel leaves.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nTo the left of George Washington is the Federal Reserve District seal. The name of the Federal Reserve Bank that issued the note encircles a capital letter (A\u2013L), identifying it among the twelve [[Federal Reserve Bank]]s. The sequential number of the bank (1: A, 2: B, etc.) is also displayed in the four corners of the open space on the bill. Until the redesign of the higher denominations of currency beginning in 1996, this seal was found on all denominations of Federal Reserve notes. Since then it is only present on the $1 and $2 notes, with the higher denominations only displaying a universal [[Federal Reserve System]] seal, and the bank letter and number beneath the upper left serial number.\n\nTo the right of George Washington is the [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department seal]]\nThe scales represent justice. The chevron with thirteen stars represents the original thirteen colonies. The key below the chevron represents authority and trust; 1789 is the year that the Department of the Treasury was established. The series 1969 dollar bills were the first to use a simplified Treasury seal, with the wording in [[English language|English]] instead of [[Latin]].\n\nBelow the FRB seal (to the left of George Washington) is the signature of the [[Treasurer of the United States]], and below the USDT Seal (right side) is the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]'s signature. To the left of the Secretary's signature is the [[Series (United States currency)|series]] date. A new series date, or addition or change of a sequential letter under a date, results from a change in the Secretary of the Treasury, the Treasurer of the United States, and/or a change to the note's appearance such as a new currency design.\n\nOn the edges are olive branches entwined around the 1s.  A small plate serial number-letter combination is on the lower right, and a small plate position (check) letter is on the upper left corner of the note. If \"FW\" appears before the lower right plate number it indicates that the bill was produced at the satellite [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] facility in [[Fort Worth]], [[Texas]]. Currency has been printed here since Series 1988A. No \"FW\" means the bill was made at the main plant in [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\n==Reverse of current $1 bill==\n\n[[File:1935 Dollar Bill Back Early Design.jpg|thumb|250px|right|President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]]'s conditional approval of the one-dollar bill's design in 1935, requiring that the appearance of the sides of the [[Great Seal of the United States|Great Seal]] be reversed, and together, captioned.]]\nThe reverse of the one-dollar bill has an ornate design that incorporates both sides of the [[Great Seal of the United States]] to the left and right of the word ''ONE''. This word appears prominently in the white space at the center of the bill in a capitalized, shadowed, and [[serif]]fed typeface. A smaller image of the word \"ONE\" is superimposed over the numeral \"1\" in each of the four corners of the bill.\n\n\"THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" spans the top of the bill, \"ONE DOLLAR\" is emblazoned along the bottom, and above the central \"ONE\" are the words \"[[In God We Trust|IN GOD WE TRUST]],\" which became the official [[motto]] of the United States in 1956 by an [[Act of Congress]]. Below the reverse of the Great Seal on the left side of the bill are the words \"THE GREAT SEAL,\" and below the obverse on the right side are the words \"OF THE UNITED STATES.\"\n\nThe Great Seal, originally designed in 1782 and added to the dollar bill's design in 1935, is surrounded by an elaborate floral design. The renderings used were the typical official government versions used since the 1880s.\n\nThe reverse of the seal on the left features a barren landscape dominated by an unfinished pyramid of 13 steps, topped by the [[Eye of Providence]] within a triangle. At the base of the pyramid are engraved the Roman numerals MDCCLXXVI (1776), the date of [[American Revolution|American independence]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. At the top of the seal stands a Latin phrase, \"[[Annuit c\u0153ptis|ANNUIT COEPTIS]],\" meaning \"He favors our undertaking.\" At the bottom of the seal is a semicircular banner proclaiming \"[[Novus ordo seclorum|NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM]]\" meaning \"New Order of the Ages\" that is a reference to the new American era. To the left of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends toward the edge of the bill.\n\nThe obverse of the seal on the right features a [[bald eagle]], the [[List of national birds|national bird]] and symbol of the United States. Above the [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]] is a radiant cluster of 13 stars arranged in a [[six-pointed star]]. The eagle's breast is covered by a [[heraldry|heraldic]] shield with 13 stripes that resemble those on the [[American flag]]. As on the first US flag, the stars and stripes stand for the 13 original states of the union. The eagle holds a ribbon in its beak reading \"[[E pluribus unum|E PLURIBUS UNUM]]\", a Latin phrase meaning \"Out of many [states], one [nation]\", a ''de facto'' motto of the United States (and the only one until 1956).  Both the phrases \"E Pluribus Unum\" and \"Annuit coeptis\" contain 13 letters. In its left talons the eagle holds 13 arrows, and in its right talons it holds an [[olive branch]] with 13 leaves and 13 olives, representing, respectively, the powers of war and peace. To the right of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends toward the edge of the bill.  A plate position (check) number is normally found to the left of the eagle.\n\n== Collecting Federal Reserve dollar bills ==\nExcept for significant errors, and series 1988A web notes printed in small batches for some of the Federal Reserve districts (those from others are more common), green seal dollars are of little collector value.  However, two notes have generated public interest, although neither is scarce.\n\nIn 1963 dollar bills were produced for the Eleventh Federal Reserve District, headquartered in Dallas.  Since the FRD jurisdictions are sequentially numbered, notes received the corresponding letter \"K\", for the 11th letter of the alphabet. Some people noticed that the 1963 Dallas note, with the number \"11\" and a \"K\" surrounded by a black seal, appeared about the time President [[John F. Kennedy]] was shot in Dallas in November 1963.  The bill was not a commemorative issue and there was no connection between it and the shooting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wndu.com/home/headlines/Kennedy-bills-have-eerie-connection-with-his-assassination-233045691.html|title=Kennedy bills have eerie connection with his assassination|first=NewsCenter16|last=Staff|website=WNDU.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968\u201369 [[Joseph W. Barr]] was Secretary of the Treasury for only 31 days and his signature appeared solely on the 1963B dollar bill.  Some collectors thought that his brief tenure might make these notes valuable, but use of their plates continued for some time after his term in office and 458,880,000 were printed.  Thus they are very common.<ref>[https://www.papermoneyauction.com/rare-or-not-rare-the-1963-b-1-dollar-barr-note Rare or Not Rare: The 1963-B $1 Dollar Barr Note]</ref>\n\nDollar Bills with interesting serial numbers can also be collected. One example of this is radar or \u201cpalindrome\u201c notes, where the numbers in the serial number are the same if you read from left to right or right to left. Very low serial numbers, or a long block of the same or repeating digits may also be of interest to specialists.  Another example is replacement notes, which have a star to the right of the serial number. The star designates that there was a printing error on one or more of the bills, and it has been replaced by one from a run specifically printed and numbered to be replacements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://money.howstuffworks.com/why-do-some-us-bills-have-a-star-instead-of-a-letter-at-the-end-of-the-serial-number.htm|title=Why do some U.S. bills have a star instead of a letter at the end of the serial number?|website=www.howstuffworks.com|access-date=May 22, 2019}}</ref>  Star notes may have some additional value depending on their condition, their year series or if they have an unusual serial number sequence.  To determine the rarity of modern star notes, production tables are maintained.<ref>[http://www.mycurrencycollection.com/reference/star-notes/1 $1 Star Note Tables]</ref>\n\n== Prosecution for the possession of a $1 bill ==\nIn Turkey the possession of a one-dollar bill can lead to a prosecution and sentence for terror related charges because it is seen as evidence for being a member of the [[G\u00fclen movement|G\u00fclen Movement]] founded by [[Fethullah G\u00fclen]], which is seen as a terror organization in Turkey.
