He had an illustrious career spanning almost three decades and had been awarded with many honours until his untimely demise in 1960. He has been called the \"Father of the Indian Air Force\".\n\nBorn in a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] family of repute, he was educated in [[India]] as well as [[England]]. He joined the [[Royal Air Force]] and later was one of the first recruits of the Indian Air Force (IAF) in 1933. He flew with the [[No. 1 Squadron IAF]] from 1933 to 1941. He attended the [[Staff College, Quetta]] in 1941 before returning to command No. 1 Squadron in 1942. \n \nHe had many firsts to his credit, the first Indian to command a [[Flight (military unit)|Flight]], in 1938, the first Indian to command a [[Squadron (aviation)|Squadron]], in 1939, the first to command a [[RAF station|Station]], in 1943, and finally, the Service itself, in 1954.\n\n==Early life and education==\nMukerjee was born in [[Calcutta]] on 5 March 1911 in a well-known [[Bengalis|Bengali]] family, to [[Satish Chandra Mukherjee]], an early Indian [[Indian Civil Service]] officer, and [[Charulata Mukherjee]], a social worker. His paternal grandfather, [[Nibaran Chandra Mukherjee]], a [[Brahmo]], was a pioneer in social and educational reforms in the country and a member of the [[Brahmo Samaj]]. His maternal grandfather, [[Prasanna Kumar Roy]] of the [[Indian Education Service]], was the first Indian Principal of the [[Presidency College, Calcutta]]. His maternal grandmother [[Sarala Roy]], an educationist and social worker, was the founder of the Gokhale Memorial Girls' School. The youngest of four children, Mukherjee was taken to [[England]] when he was three months old. However, he spent his childhood in [[Krishnagar|Krishnanagar]] and [[Chinsura]] in [[Bengal]]. From his very early days, he had shown an aptitude for a military career, probably infused by his uncle, [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[Indra Lal Roy]], who had joined the [[Royal Flying Corps]] during the [[First World War]]. Roy was the first Indian to be awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and was the only [[India]]n [[flying ace]].\n\nMukerjee's elder sister [[Renuka Ray]] was a prominent freedom-fighter. She was a [[Member of parliament, Lok Sabha|member of parliament]], cabinet minister and an ambassador. She attended the [[Cambridge University]] and the [[London School of Economics]].<ref>{{cite web |title=LIFE LIVED IN AN AGE OF EXTREMES |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/life-lived-in-an-age-of-extremes/cid/1023620 |website=www.telegraphindia.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\nMukerjee was educated in a [[Diocese|diocesan]] school in [[Nainital]] (today known as [[Sherwood College]]) and [[Loreto School, Kolkata|Loreto Convent]] in Calcutta and also in a school in [[Hampstead]] in England. He subsequently joined [[Birbhum Zilla School]] and passed the [[matriculation]] examination in 1927. He was also a student of [[Howrah Zilla School]].

He had an illustrious career spanning almost three decades and had been awarded with many honours until his untimely demise in 1960.

He joined the [[Royal Air Force]] and later was one of the first recruits of the Indian Air Force (IAF) in 1933. He flew with the [[No. 1 Squadron IAF]] from 1933 to 1941. He attended the [[Staff College, Quetta]] in 1941 before returning to command No. 1 Squadron in 1942. \n \nHe had many firsts to his credit, the first Indian to command a [[Flight (military unit)|Flight]], in 1938, the first Indian to command a [[Squadron (aviation)|Squadron]], in 1939, the first to command a [[RAF station|Station]], in 1943, and finally, the Service itself, in 1954.\n\n==Early life and education==\nMukerjee was born in [[Calcutta]] on 5 March 1911 in a well-known [[Bengalis|Bengali]] family, to [[Satish Chandra Mukherjee]], an early Indian [[Indian Civil Service]] officer, and [[Charulata Mukherjee]], a social worker. His paternal grandfather, [[Nibaran Chandra Mukherjee]], a [[Brahmo]], was a pioneer in social and educational reforms in the country and a member of the [[Brahmo Samaj]]. His maternal grandfather, [[Prasanna Kumar Roy]] of the [[Indian Education Service]], was the first Indian Principal of the [[Presidency College, Calcutta]]. His maternal grandmother [[Sarala Roy]], an educationist and social worker, was the founder of the Gokhale Memorial Girls' School. The youngest of four children, Mukherjee was taken to [[England]] when he was three months old. However, he spent his childhood in [[Krishnagar|Krishnanagar]] and [[Chinsura]] in [[Bengal]]. From his very early days, he had shown an aptitude for a military career, probably infused by his uncle, [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[Indra Lal Roy]], who had joined the [[Royal Flying Corps]] during the [[First World War]]. Roy was the first Indian to be awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and was the only [[India]]n [[flying ace]].\n\nMukerjee's elder sister [[Renuka Ray]] was a prominent freedom-fighter. She was a [[Member of parliament, Lok Sabha|member of parliament]], cabinet minister and an ambassador.

Mukerjee and [[Air Commodore]] (later [[Air Chief Marshal (India)|ACM]]) [[Pratap Chandra Lal]], then [[General Manager]] of the [[Indian Airlines Corporation]] were passengers on this flight. After landing in Tokyo, on 8 November 1960, Mukerjee was having a meal in a restaurant with a friend, an officer in the [[Indian Navy]]. A piece of food got lodged in his [[windpipe]], [[choking]] him to death. Before a Doctor was called for and could attend, Mukerjee had passed away. The next day, his body was flown to [[Palam Airport]], [[New Delhi]].<ref>{{cite book |title=My years with the IAF |publisher=Lancer Publishers |isbn=978-8170620082 |page=85}}</ref> \n\nMukerjee was cremated with full military honours. From Palam Airport, a hearse carried him to the Air House. On 11 November, numerous visitors offered their respects. As his body was leaving the Air House, a 15-gun salute, at one minute interval, was fired. His body was carried in a gun-carriage to the [[Nigambodh Ghat]], with servicemen lining the whole route. He was paid a final tribute with a fly-past of forty nine aircraft, one for each of his forty nine years.<ref>{{cite book |title=My years with the IAF |publisher=Lancer Publishers |isbn=978-8170620082 |page=85}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=LATE AIR MARSHAL S MUKERJEE |url=http://pibarchive.nic.in/archive/ArchiveSecondPhase/DEFENCE/1960-JULY-DEC-MIN-OF-DEFENCE/PDF/DEF-1960-11-10_169.pdf |website=pibarchive.nic.in |date=10 November 1960}}</ref> The death came as a shock to the nation and to the Indian Air Force.

The ''{{transl|ar|Dajj\u0101l}}'' is an evil being who will seek to impersonate the true Messiah.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nA number of locations are associated with the emergence of the Dajjal, but usually, he emerges from the East. He is usually described as blind in one eye, however, which eye is disputed. Possessing a defective eye is often regarded as giving more powers to achieve evil goals.<ref>David Cook ''Studies in Muslim Apocalyptic'' The Darwin Press, Inc. Princeton, New Jersey {{ISBN|0878501428}} p. 99</ref> As a false Messiah, it is believed that many will be deceived by him and join his ranks, among them Jews, Bedouins, weavers, magicians. Further he is assisted by an army of [[shaitan|demons]]. Nevertheless, the most reliable supporters will be the Jews, to whom he will be the incarnation of God. The notion of Jews comprising the majority of Dajjals' followers is probably a remnant from Christian Antichrist legends.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">David Cook ''Studies in Muslim Apocalyptic'' The Darwin Press, Inc. Princeton, New Jersey {{ISBN|0878501428}} p. 100</ref> The Dajjal will be able to perform miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead (although only when supported by his demonic followers it seems), causing the earth to grow vegetation, causing livestock to prosper and to die and stopping the sun's movement.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> His miracles resemble those performed by Jesus. The relation between the two is obscure. In one tradition, it is known that Jesus circumambulating the [[Kaaba]], the Dajjal following him, depicting the Dajjal as an evil shadowy ''Doppelganger'' of the real Jesus. At the end, the Dajjal will be killed by Jesus. In many versions by Jesus' simply looking at him, indicating, he is indeed merely a shadow of Jesus without any independent existence.<ref>David Cook ''Studies in Muslim Apocalyptic'' The Darwin Press, Inc. Princeton, New Jersey {{ISBN|0878501428}} p. 104</ref> Similar to the ambiguous status of Jesus in the Quran, who is not divine, but nevertheless more than a human and, it seems, more than a usual prophet, the nature of the Dajjal is ambiguous as well. Although the nature of his birth indicates that the first generations of apocalyptists regarded him as human, he is also identified rather as a demon (''shaytan'') in human form in Islamic traditions.<ref>David Cook ''Studies in Muslim Apocalyptic'' The Darwin Press, Inc.

The relation between the two is obscure. In one tradition, it is known that Jesus circumambulating the [[Kaaba]], the Dajjal following him, depicting the Dajjal as an evil shadowy ''Doppelganger'' of the real Jesus.

Fay walked out on the series after the first film, ''[[Spotlight Scandals]]'' (1943), and Katzman replaced him with Gilbert's closest friend, [[Shemp Howard]].\n\n===Serials===\nIn September 1944 Katzman was offered a job producing serials for [[Columbia Pictures]], starring with ''[[Brenda Starr, Reporter (film)|Brenda Starr, Reporter]]'' (1945)<ref>NEWS OF THE SCREEN: New York Times 9 Sep 1944: 12.</ref> He followed this with the serials ''[[Jungle Raiders (serial)|Jungle Raiders]]'' (1945) and ''[[Who's Guilty?]]'' (1945). With typical thrift, he produced them on the side, using Monogram's actors and technicians. \n\nThey were followed by ''[[Hop Harrigan (serial)|Hop Harrigan]]'' (1946), ''[[Chick Carter, Detective]]'' (1946) and ''[[Son of the Guardsman]]'' (1947).\n\n===Final Monogram Movies===\nHe continued to produce features for Monogram through 1948.\n\nKatzman's final East Side Kids movies were ''[[Docks of New York]]'' (1945), ''[[Mr. Muggs Rides Again]]'' (1945) and ''[[Come Out Fighting (1945 film)|Come Out Fighting]]'' (1945). The series came to an abrupt end when its star [[Leo Gorcey]] wanted double the usual salary from Katzman. Katzman reacted by pulling the plug on the series. (Gorcey stayed with Monogram, which retooled the series as [[The Bowery Boys]].)\n\nIn November 1945 Katzman replaced the rowdy East Side Kids with [[The Teen Agers]], a wholesome gang of high-schoolers. These were vehicles for singer [[Freddie Stewart (actor)|Freddie Stewart]].<ref>Detective Will Menace Belita in 'The Hunted'\nSchallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times7 Nov 1945: A3. </ref> It was an early example of Katzman's output aimed specifically at a teenage audience. He produced four in total: ''[[Freddie Steps Out]]'' (1946), ''[[Junior Prom]]'' (1946), ''[[High School Hero (1946 film)|High School Hero]]'' (1946) and ''[[Vacation Days]]'' (1948). \n\n==Columbia Pictures==\n===Musicals===\nIn June 1946 Katzman announced he would make his first feature for Columbia, a remake of ''The Last of the Mohicans'' starring Jon Hall.<ref>'LAST OF MOHICANS' TO BE FILMED AGAIN: Katzman, in Columbia Deal, to Star Jon Hall in Remake-- Two Premieres Here Today\nSpecial to THE NEW YORK TIMES..22 June 1946: 25. </ref> However, the first movies he ended up making at the studio were musicals. In August 1946 he signed [[Jean Porter]] to star in ''[[Betty Co-Ed]]'' (1946), made by Katzman's Monogram director [[Arthur Dreifuss]]. The film received excellent reviews, prompting Columbia to ask for three more. Porter left [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which was downsizing, to sign with Katzman. The three musicals were ''[[Little Miss Broadway (1947 film)|Little Miss Broadway]]'' (1947), ''[[Sweet Genevieve]]'' (1947) and ''[[Two Blondes and a Redhead]]'' (1947).\n\nKatzman and Dreifuss then made two films with singer [[Gloria Jean]], who had been a star at [[Universal Pictures]]. Katzman was so pleased by ''[[I Surrender Dear (1948 film)|I Surrender Dear]]'' (1948) that he devoted more time to it, and economized on her other picture, ''[[Manhattan Angel]]'' (1949).<ref>MacGillivray, Scott and Jan, ''Gloria Jean: A Little Bit of Heaven'', Universe, 2005</ref>  These were budgeted at about $140,000 per film. <ref name=\"drop\">{{cite news|title=Hollywood Survey: Sharp Drop in Production Noted -- Still Another Dumas Exploit -- Other Items|author=Thomas F Brady|work=New York Times|date=11 May 1947|page=X5}}</ref> \n\nHe made some sports-themed features starring [[Gloria Henry]], ''[[Racing Luck (1948 film)|Racing Luck]]'' (1948) and ''[[Triple Threat (1948 film)|Triple Threat]]'' (1948), and the musicals ''[[Mary Lou (1948 film)|Mary Lou]]'' (1948) and ''[[Glamour Girl (1948 film)|Glamour Girl]]'' (1948). Boxoffice on these pictures declined, and Katzman started focusing on action pictures instead.\n\nDuring this time Katzman continued to produce serials for Columbia such as ''[[Jack Armstrong (serial)|Jack Armstrong]]'' (1947), ''[[The Vigilante]]'' (1947), ''[[The Sea Hound (serial)|The Sea Hound]]'' (1947) with [[Buster Crabbe]], ''[[Brick Bradford (serial)|Brick Bradford]]'' (1948), ''[[Congo Bill (serial)|Congo Bill]]'' (1948) and the outstandingly successful ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' (1948). \n\n===Focus on Action Films===\nIn February 1948 Katzman had signed a five-year deal with screen [[Tarzan]] [Johnny Weissmuller]] to make \"jungle movies\" starting with two films a year for two years where the budgets would be at least $350,000.<ref>SELZNICK TO MOVE OFFICES TO COAST: New York Times 16 Feb 1948: 17. </ref> These turned into the ''Jungle Jim'' series starting with ''[[Jungle Jim (film)|Jungle Jim]]'' (1948)\n\nKatzman continued to make musicals such as ''[[Mary Lou (1948 film)|Mary Lou]]'' (1948) and ''[[Glamour Girl (1948 film)|Glamour Girl]]'' (1948) with [[Gene Krupa]]. However the box office performance of Katzman's action movies and serials, particularly ''Superman'' was outstripping those for his musicals and comedies, leading him away from those genres. From 1949 to 1954 he would produce only action fare for Columbia. These were Arabian Nights fantasies (bluntly euphemized by Katzman as \"tits and sand\"), western, action, and prison pictures. He would average ten features a year, producing them in four to ten weeks.<ref name=\"may\"/>\n\nIn October 1948 Katzman signed a seven-year, $4 million contract with Columbia to make four feature films a year through his Kay Pictures corporation, four serials a year via his Esskay Productions, and a ''[[Jungle Jim]]'' [[film series]] starring [[Johnny Weissmuller]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Italian-Made Feature Stars Patricia Medina; Prison Musical Readied|author=Schallert, Edwin|work=Los Angeles Times|date=26 Oct 1948|page=A6}}</ref>. \n\nKatzman allowed a budget of $400,000 for ''[[The Prince of Thieves]]'' (1948), a version of the Robin Hood story starring Hall.<ref name=\"drop\"/> Other action-orientated Katzman product around this time included ''[[The Lost Tribe (1949 film)|The Lost Tribe]]'' (1949), a Jungle Jim movie; the serial ''[[Tex Granger]]'' (1948), ''[[Adventures of Sir Galahad]]'' (1949), ''[[Batman and Robin (serial)|Batman and Robin]]'' (1949) and ''[[Bruce Gentry \u2013 Daredevil of the Skies]]'' (1949); the action thriller ''[[The Mutineers (film)|The Mutineers]]'' (1949) with Hall; the swashbuckler ''[[Barbary Pirate (film)|Barbary Pirate]]'' (1949) and the crime movie ''[[Chinatown at Midnight]]'' (1949).<ref>{{cite news|title=HOLLYWOOD UPSWING: Increased Production Breaks Downward Trend in Employment -- Fox Backs Out|first=Thomas F.|last=Brady|newspaper=New York Times|date=17 April 1949|page= X5}}</ref> \n\n[[Charles Schneer]], who worked for Katzman in the 1940s and 1950s, said the producer:\n<blockquote>Knew everything there was to know about making a movie.  He was a very enterprising fellow, and was enormously intuitive. But, he was a very tough taskmaster and a real skinflint. I managed to get along well with Sam, because I knew what he was and respected what he did. Unfortunately, all his input  was negative. He never contributed anything positive. I would suggest an idea, and he  would knock it down. I would argue with him, but I never got very far. He wouldn't say: 'Do this instead of that.' He would only say: 'Don't do this' \u2014 and I didn't. I certainly learned the value of a dollar from Sam.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Starlog|first=Steve|last=Swires|title=Mentor to the Magicks Part One|issue=150|date=January 1990|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-150/page/n56/mode/1up/search/schneer?q=charles+schneer+starlog|page=59}}</ref></blockquote>\nHis Monogram cameraman Robert Cline later recalled \"we did 106 features in six years, working six days a week - an average of 20 to 22 features a year. Those were \"B\" pictures... There was a clever writer in the unit. Sam would pick up a newspaper and say, \"Oh, here's a story.\" He'd give it to the writer and the writer would turn out a script. We'd go all over.

Berke specialised in Jungle Jim films such as ''[[Mark of the Gorilla]]'' (1950), ''[[Pygmy Island]]'' (1950), ''[[Captive Girl]]'' (1951) and ''[[Fury of the Congo]]'' (1951).

Landers handled the other action films like ''[[State Penitentiary (film)|State Penitentiary]]'' (1950), ''[[Revenue Agent]]'' (1950) with [[Lyle Talbot]], ''[[Last of the Buccaneers]]'' (1950) with [[Paul Henreid]], ''[[Chain Gang (1950 film)|Chain Gang]]'' (1950), ''[[Tyrant of the Sea]]'' (1950) with [[Ron Randell]], ''[[The Magic Carpet (film)|The Magic Carpet]]'' (1951) with [[Lucille Ball]], ''[[Hurricane Island]]'' (1951) and ''[[When the Redskins Rode]]'' (1951) with Hall, ''[[A Yank in Korea]]'' (1951) with [[Lon McAllister]]. \n\n[[Richard Quine]], then under contract to Columbia, made one of his first films as director for Katzman, ''[[Purple Heart Diary]]'' (1951); he later did ''[[Siren of Bagdad]]'' (1953) with Paul Henreid.\n\nLew Landers took over direction of Jungle Jim movies for ''[[Jungle Manhunt]]'' (1951) and ''[[Jungle Jim in the Forbidden Land]]'' (1952), and did ''[[California Conquest]]'' (1952) with [[Cornel Wilde]]. [[Fred F. Sears]] started work for Katzman with ''[[Last Train from Bombay]]'' (1952) starring Hall.

Serials were gradually phased out, with his last ones being ''[[The Adventures of Captain Africa]]'', ''[[Perils of the Wilderness]]'' (1956) and ''[[Blazing the Overland Trail]]'' (1956). Instead Katzman decided to focus on films that would appeal to the 15-25 age group, which meant more sci-fi, horror, and rock musicals.<ref name=\"may\"/>\n\nIn August 1954 Katzman said he had 14 films lined up, with four more to come, and had assigned four writers to projects: [[Curt Siodmak]] to ''The Creature with the Atom Brain'', Berne Giler on ''Dressed to Kill'', Ray Buffum on a juvenile delinquency story, and Robert E. Kent on a Western.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|url=https://archive.org/details/variety195-1954-08/page/n5/mode/1up/search/+%22sam+katzman%22?q=%22loners%22+%22sam+katzman%22|title=Sam Katzman's 4 films|page=6|date=August 4, 1954}}</ref>\n\n''[[Creature with the Atom Brain (film)|Creature with the Atom Brain]]'' (1955) led to a series of science fiction films, such as ''[[It Came from Beneath the Sea]]'' (1955), with effects from [[Ray Harryhausen]]. That was produced by [[Charles H. Schneer]] who had worked with Katzman for a number of years; Schneer and Harryhausen went on to make ''[[Earth vs. the Flying Saucers]]'' (1956) for Katzman before Schneer left to form his own unit at Columbia.\n\nKatzman would still make Westerns such as ''[[The Gun That Won the West]]'' (1955), ''[[Seminole Uprising]]'' (1955), ''[[Blackjack Ketchum, Desperado]]'' (1955) and ''[[Duel on the Mississippi]]'' (1955), swashbucklers like ''[[Pirates of Tripoli]]'' (1955) and crime films such as ''[[New Orleans Uncensored]]'' (1955), ''[[Chicago Syndicate (film)|Chicago Syndicate]]'' (1955), ''[[The Crooked Web]]'' (1955), ''[[The Houston Story]]'' (1956), ''[[Miami Expos\u00e9]]'' (1956) and ''[[Inside Detroit]]'' (1956).  He also did the occasional thriller like ''[[Uranium Boom]]'' (1956).\n\nHowever his work had an increasing teenage focus, such as ''[[Teen-Age Crime Wave]]'' (1955) and ''[[Rumble on the Docks]]'' (1956), which were teen orientated crime films. He also started making musicals again, with rock music. \n\nIn 1955, when Columbia wanted to release the first rock-and-roll musical, Katzman reworked elements from his Gloria Jean musical ''I Surrender Dear'' into one of Columbia's biggest hits, ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' (1956) with [[Bill Haley and His Comets]].<ref>MacGillivray, Scott and Jan, ''Gloria Jean: A Little Bit of Heaven'', iUniverse, 2005</ref> This cost $300,000 and earned over $4 million.<ref name=\"may\"/> This was followed by ''[[Cha-Cha-Cha Boom!]]'' (1956), ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]]'' (1957, again with Bill Haley), ''[[Calypso Heat Wave]]'' (1957) and ''[[Juke Box Rhythm]]'' (1959, scheduled for Bill Haley but ultimately made with singer [[Jack Jones (singer)|Jack Jones]]).  \n\nKatzman also produced horror films for the teenage audience, including ''[[The Werewolf (1956 film)|The Werewolf]]'' (1956), ''[[The Man Who Turned to Stone]]'' (1957), ''[[The Giant Claw]]'' (1957), ''[[Zombies of Mora Tau]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Night the World Exploded]]'' (1957).\n\nIn May 1957 Katzman told ''Variety'' that he felt, \u201cA picture that makes money is a good picture \u2014- whether it is artistically good or bad. I\u2019m in the five and dime business and not in  the Tiffany business. I make pictures for the little theatres around the country.\u201d <ref name=\"may\"/> He added that his movies were normally budgeted between $250,000 and $500,000. He said at Columbia he had made 110 pictures, none of which lost money, and the average gross was $1 million. He said at least 40% of the 110 pictures made were still in release.<ref name=\"may\">{{cite magazine |magazine=Variety |date=1 May 1957 |page=17 |url=https://archive.org/details/variety206-1957-05/page/n16/mode/1up |title=$300,000 Picture's Gross Expectancy Same as $1-Mil Film\u2013Katzman}}</ref>\n\n\u201cEvery picture I make now has a selling gimmick aimed at the young audience,\" he said in 1957, and he made car movies, horror stories, science fiction and music. He said his pictures are the \u201cbread and butter\u201d pictures of the industry. \u201cI don't get ulcers with the type of pictures I make,\u201d he said.<ref name=\"may\"/> \n\nIn 1957 Katzman made seven films for Columbia, including non-teenage fare such as ''[[Utah Blaine]]'' (1957), ''[[Escape from San Quentin]]'' (1957), ''[[The Tijuana Story]]'' (1957) and ''[[The World Was His Jury]]'' (1957). He announced in December of that year he would double this amount over the following twelve months.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/variety209-1958-01/page/n6/mode/1up |date=1 January 1958 |page=7 |title=Katzman's Columbia 7 in '57 to be Doubled |magazine=Variety}}</ref>\n\nKatzman's later films at Columbia included some teen melodramas ''[[Going Steady (1958 film)|Going Steady]]'' (1958) and ''[[Life Begins at 17]]'' (1958);''[[Crash Landing (1958 film)|Crash Landing]]'' (1958), a disaster film based on [[Pan Am Flight 6]]; a pair of war films starring [[Van Johnson]] shot in Europe, ''[[The Last Blitzkrieg]]'' (1959) and ''[[The Enemy General]]'' (1960); and a drama about trapeze artists, ''[[The Flying Fontaines]]'' (1959).\n\n==Later career==\n===20th Century Fox===\nKatzman signed a deal with [[20th Century Fox]] starting with ''[[The Wizard of Baghdad]]'' (1960), an \"Eastern\" with [[Dick Shawn]]. He did this under a verbal agreement with [[Buddy Adler]] then in September 1960 Robert Goldstein signed him to a three picture contract. These were to be ''Gentlemen Pirates'' written by Mel Levy, a film about Mississippi gamblers written by Jesse Lasky Jr. and Pat Silver, and ''Cypress Gardens'' by Lou Morheim.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|url=https://archive.org/details/variety220-1960-09/page/n212/mode/1up/search/%22sam+katzman%22?q=%22sam+katzman%22|title=Sam Katzman on Exhib Vagaries|page=3|date=28 September 1960}}</ref> He said at the time that Hollywood was making too many blockbusters and \"the motion picture business must deal in a saleable product of entertainment at a price the public can afford and not price itself out. of the market.\u201d<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|title=Sam Katzman on Exhib Vagaries|page=30|url=https://archive.org/details/variety220-1960-09/page/n239/mode/1up/search/%22sam+katzman%22?q=%22sam+katzman%22|date=28 September 1960}}</ref>\n\nHe wound up making only one more film at Fox, ''[[Pirates of Tortuga]]'' (1961), a swashbuckler similar to many of the films he made at Columbia. \n\nHe returned to Columbia to make ''[[The Wild Westerners]]'' (1962), a Western, as well as two \"twist\" movies starring [[Chubby Checker]], ''[[Twist Around the Clock]]'' (1961) and ''[[Don't Knock the Twist]]'' (1962). These were scene-for-scene remakes of Katzman's Bill Haley musicals, with almost identical scripts.\n\n===MGM===\nKatzman accepted an offer to move his operation to MGM in 1963. He started with a low budget musical ''[[Hootenanny Hoot]]'' (1963), which led to several more musicals: ''[[Get Yourself a College Girl]]'' (1964) and ''[[When the Boys Meet the Girls]]'' (1965) (a remake of ''[[Girl Crazy (1943 film)|Girl Crazy]]''). MGM also financed three of Katzman's best known movies: two films starring [[Elvis Presley]], ''[[Kissin' Cousins]]'' (1964) and ''[[Harum Scarum (film)|Harum Scarum]]'' (1965), as well as ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), a biopic of [[Hank Williams]] starring George Hamilton. Hamilton later wrote in his memoirs that \"Jungle Sam cracked the whip, whacked the cane and the whole film was in the can right on time. But he gave me free rein creatively and our director... brought in something memorable, and even Sam knew it.\"<ref>George Hamilton & William Stadiem, ''Don't Mind If I Do'', Simon & Schuster 2008 p 182</ref>\n\nIn December 1964 Katzman announced he would make five films that year for MGM in his third year at the studio.<ref>FILMLAND EVENTS: Sam Katzman Begins Busy Year at MGM Los Angeles Times 26 Dec 1964: 19. </ref>\n\nKatzman made the [[Herman's Hermits]] film ''[[Hold On!

Sam Katzman got the call and recruited his 1940s cronies, Arthur Dreifuss and writer [[Hal Collins]], to make ''The Love-Ins'' and ''For Singles Only'' (both 1967)<ref>MacGillivray, Scott and Jan, ''Gloria Jean: A Little Bit of Heaven'', Universe, 2005</ref>\n\n===Final Movies===\nKatzman's final films were produced by his son Jerry.

Fay walked out on the series after the first film, ''[[Spotlight Scandals]]'' (1943), and Katzman replaced him with Gilbert's closest friend, [[Shemp Howard]].\n\n===Serials===\nIn September 1944 Katzman was offered a job producing serials for [[Columbia Pictures]], starring with ''[[Brenda Starr, Reporter (film)|Brenda Starr, Reporter]]'' (1945)<ref>NEWS OF THE SCREEN: New York Times 9 Sep 1944: 12.</ref> He followed this with the serials ''[[Jungle Raiders (serial)|Jungle Raiders]]'' (1945) and ''[[Who's Guilty?]]'' (1945). With typical thrift, he produced them on the side, using Monogram's actors and technicians. \n\nThey were followed by ''[[Hop Harrigan (serial)|Hop Harrigan]]'' (1946), ''[[Chick Carter, Detective]]'' (1946) and ''[[Son of the Guardsman]]'' (1947).\n\n===Final Monogram Movies===\nHe continued to produce features for Monogram through 1948.\n\nKatzman's final East Side Kids movies were ''[[Docks of New York]]'' (1945), ''[[Mr. Muggs Rides Again]]'' (1945) and ''[[Come Out Fighting (1945 film)|Come Out Fighting]]'' (1945). The series came to an abrupt end when its star [[Leo Gorcey]] wanted double the usual salary from Katzman. Katzman reacted by pulling the plug on the series. (Gorcey stayed with Monogram, which retooled the series as [[The Bowery Boys]].)\n\nIn November 1945 Katzman replaced the rowdy East Side Kids with [[The Teen Agers]], a wholesome gang of high-schoolers. These were vehicles for singer [[Freddie Stewart (actor)|Freddie Stewart]].<ref>Detective Will Menace Belita in 'The Hunted'\nSchallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times7 Nov 1945: A3. </ref> It was an early example of Katzman's output aimed specifically at a teenage audience. He produced four in total: ''[[Freddie Steps Out]]'' (1946), ''[[Junior Prom]]'' (1946), ''[[High School Hero (1946 film)|High School Hero]]'' (1946) and ''[[Vacation Days]]'' (1948). \n\n==Columbia Pictures==\n===Musicals===\nIn June 1946 Katzman announced he would make his first feature for Columbia, a remake of ''The Last of the Mohicans'' starring Jon Hall.<ref>'LAST OF MOHICANS' TO BE FILMED AGAIN: Katzman, in Columbia Deal, to Star Jon Hall in Remake-- Two Premieres Here Today\nSpecial to THE NEW YORK TIMES..22 June 1946: 25. </ref> However, the first movies he ended up making at the studio were musicals. In August 1946 he signed [[Jean Porter]] to star in ''[[Betty Co-Ed]]'' (1946), made by Katzman's Monogram director [[Arthur Dreifuss]]. The film received excellent reviews, prompting Columbia to ask for three more. Porter left [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which was downsizing, to sign with Katzman. The three musicals were ''[[Little Miss Broadway (1947 film)|Little Miss Broadway]]'' (1947), ''[[Sweet Genevieve]]'' (1947) and ''[[Two Blondes and a Redhead]]'' (1947).\n\nKatzman and Dreifuss then made two films with singer [[Gloria Jean]], who had been a star at [[Universal Pictures]]. Katzman was so pleased by ''[[I Surrender Dear (1948 film)|I Surrender Dear]]'' (1948) that he devoted more time to it, and economized on her other picture, ''[[Manhattan Angel]]'' (1949).<ref>MacGillivray, Scott and Jan, ''Gloria Jean: A Little Bit of Heaven'', Universe, 2005</ref>  These were budgeted at about $140,000 per film. <ref name=\"drop\">{{cite news|title=Hollywood Survey: Sharp Drop in Production Noted -- Still Another Dumas Exploit -- Other Items|author=Thomas F Brady|work=New York Times|date=11 May 1947|page=X5}}</ref> \n\nHe made some sports-themed features starring [[Gloria Henry]], ''[[Racing Luck (1948 film)|Racing Luck]]'' (1948) and ''[[Triple Threat (1948 film)|Triple Threat]]'' (1948), and the musicals ''[[Mary Lou (1948 film)|Mary Lou]]'' (1948) and ''[[Glamour Girl (1948 film)|Glamour Girl]]'' (1948). Boxoffice on these pictures declined, and Katzman started focusing on action pictures instead.\n\nDuring this time Katzman continued to produce serials for Columbia such as ''[[Jack Armstrong (serial)|Jack Armstrong]]'' (1947), ''[[The Vigilante]]'' (1947), ''[[The Sea Hound (serial)|The Sea Hound]]'' (1947) with [[Buster Crabbe]], ''[[Brick Bradford (serial)|Brick Bradford]]'' (1948), ''[[Congo Bill (serial)|Congo Bill]]'' (1948) and the outstandingly successful ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' (1948). \n\n===Focus on Action Films===\nIn February 1948 Katzman had signed a five-year deal with screen [[Tarzan]] [Johnny Weissmuller]] to make \"jungle movies\" starting with two films a year for two years where the budgets would be at least $350,000.<ref>SELZNICK TO MOVE OFFICES TO COAST: New York Times 16 Feb 1948: 17. </ref> These turned into the ''Jungle Jim'' series starting with ''[[Jungle Jim (film)|Jungle Jim]]'' (1948)\n\nKatzman continued to make musicals such as ''[[Mary Lou (1948 film)|Mary Lou]]'' (1948) and ''[[Glamour Girl (1948 film)|Glamour Girl]]'' (1948) with [[Gene Krupa]]. However the box office performance of Katzman's action movies and serials, particularly ''Superman'' was outstripping those for his musicals and comedies, leading him away from those genres. From 1949 to 1954 he would produce only action fare for Columbia. These were Arabian Nights fantasies (bluntly euphemized by Katzman as \"tits and sand\"), western, action, and prison pictures. He would average ten features a year, producing them in four to ten weeks.<ref name=\"may\"/>\n\nIn October 1948 Katzman signed a seven-year, $4 million contract with Columbia to make four feature films a year through his Kay Pictures corporation, four serials a year via his Esskay Productions, and a ''[[Jungle Jim]]'' [[film series]] starring [[Johnny Weissmuller]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Italian-Made Feature Stars Patricia Medina; Prison Musical Readied|author=Schallert, Edwin|work=Los Angeles Times|date=26 Oct 1948|page=A6}}</ref>. \n\nKatzman allowed a budget of $400,000 for ''[[The Prince of Thieves]]'' (1948), a version of the Robin Hood story starring Hall.<ref name=\"drop\"/> Other action-orientated Katzman product around this time included ''[[The Lost Tribe (1949 film)|The Lost Tribe]]'' (1949), a Jungle Jim movie; the serial ''[[Tex Granger]]'' (1948), ''[[Adventures of Sir Galahad]]'' (1949), ''[[Batman and Robin (serial)|Batman and Robin]]'' (1949) and ''[[Bruce Gentry \u2013 Daredevil of the Skies]]'' (1949); the action thriller ''[[The Mutineers (film)|The Mutineers]]'' (1949) with Hall; the swashbuckler ''[[Barbary Pirate (film)|Barbary Pirate]]'' (1949) and the crime movie ''[[Chinatown at Midnight]]'' (1949).<ref>{{cite news|title=HOLLYWOOD UPSWING: Increased Production Breaks Downward Trend in Employment -- Fox Backs Out|first=Thomas F.|last=Brady|newspaper=New York Times|date=17 April 1949|page= X5}}</ref> \n\n[[Charles Schneer]], who worked for Katzman in the 1940s and 1950s, said the producer:\n<blockquote>Knew everything there was to know about making a movie.  He was a very enterprising fellow, and was enormously intuitive. But, he was a very tough taskmaster and a real skinflint. I managed to get along well with Sam, because I knew what he was and respected what he did. Unfortunately, all his input  was negative. He never contributed anything positive. I would suggest an idea, and he  would knock it down. I would argue with him, but I never got very far. He wouldn't say: 'Do this instead of that.' He would only say: 'Don't do this' \u2014 and I didn't. I certainly learned the value of a dollar from Sam.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Starlog|first=Steve|last=Swires|title=Mentor to the Magicks Part One|issue=150|date=January 1990|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-150/page/n56/mode/1up/search/schneer?q=charles+schneer+starlog|page=59}}</ref></blockquote>\nHis Monogram cameraman Robert Cline later recalled \"we did 106 features in six years, working six days a week - an average of 20 to 22 features a year. Those were \"B\" pictures... There was a clever writer in the unit. Sam would pick up a newspaper and say, \"Oh, here's a story.\" He'd give it to the writer and the writer would turn out a script. We'd go all over.

Berke specialised in Jungle Jim films such as ''[[Mark of the Gorilla]]'' (1950), ''[[Pygmy Island]]'' (1950), ''[[Captive Girl]]'' (1951) and ''[[Fury of the Congo]]'' (1951). Bennett did serials like ''[[Pirates of the High Seas]]'' (1950), ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]'' (1950), ''[[Cody of the Pony Express]]'' (1950), ''[[Mysterious Island (serial)|Mysterious Island]]'' (1951), ''[[Roar of the Iron Horse]]'' (1951) and ''[[Son of Geronimo]]'' (1952). Landers handled the other action films like ''[[State Penitentiary (film)|State Penitentiary]]'' (1950), ''[[Revenue Agent]]'' (1950) with [[Lyle Talbot]], ''[[Last of the Buccaneers]]'' (1950) with [[Paul Henreid]], ''[[Chain Gang (1950 film)|Chain Gang]]'' (1950), ''[[Tyrant of the Sea]]'' (1950) with [[Ron Randell]], ''[[The Magic Carpet (film)|The Magic Carpet]]'' (1951) with [[Lucille Ball]], ''[[Hurricane Island]]'' (1951) and ''[[When the Redskins Rode]]'' (1951) with Hall, ''[[A Yank in Korea]]'' (1951) with [[Lon McAllister]]. \n\n[[Richard Quine]], then under contract to Columbia, made one of his first films as director for Katzman, ''[[Purple Heart Diary]]'' (1951); he later did ''[[Siren of Bagdad]]'' (1953) with Paul Henreid.\n\nLew Landers took over direction of Jungle Jim movies for ''[[Jungle Manhunt]]'' (1951) and ''[[Jungle Jim in the Forbidden Land]]'' (1952), and did ''[[California Conquest]]'' (1952) with [[Cornel Wilde]]. [[Fred F. Sears]] started work for Katzman with ''[[Last Train from Bombay]]'' (1952) starring Hall. [[Wallace Grissell]] directed ''[[A Yank in Indo-China]]'' (1952) and [[Sidney Salkow]] directed ''[[The Golden Hawk]]'' (1952) with [[Sterling Hayden]] and ''[[The Pathfinder (1952 film)|The Pathfinder]]'' (1952) with George Montgomery.\n\nBennett continued to make serials like ''[[Blackhawk]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}'' (1952) and ''[[King of the Congo]]'' (1952), and branched into features such as ''[[Brave Warrior]]'' (1952) with Hall and a Jungle Jim film, ''[[Voodoo Tiger]]'' (1952).

Castle later wrote in his memoirs that Katzman \"was a smallish man with a round cherubic face and twinkling eyes.

The Weissmuller series wound up after ''[[Jungle Moon Men]]'' (1955) and ''[[Devil Goddess]]'' (1955). Serials were gradually phased out, with his last ones being ''[[The Adventures of Captain Africa]]'', ''[[Perils of the Wilderness]]'' (1956) and ''[[Blazing the Overland Trail]]'' (1956). Instead Katzman decided to focus on films that would appeal to the 15-25 age group, which meant more sci-fi, horror, and rock musicals.<ref name=\"may\"/>\n\nIn August 1954 Katzman said he had 14 films lined up, with four more to come, and had assigned four writers to projects: [[Curt Siodmak]] to ''The Creature with the Atom Brain'', Berne Giler on ''Dressed to Kill'', Ray Buffum on a juvenile delinquency story, and Robert E. Kent on a Western.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|url=https://archive.org/details/variety195-1954-08/page/n5/mode/1up/search/+%22sam+katzman%22?q=%22loners%22+%22sam+katzman%22|title=Sam Katzman's 4 films|page=6|date=August 4, 1954}}</ref>\n\n''[[Creature with the Atom Brain (film)|Creature with the Atom Brain]]'' (1955) led to a series of science fiction films, such as ''[[It Came from Beneath the Sea]]'' (1955), with effects from [[Ray Harryhausen]]. That was produced by [[Charles H. Schneer]] who had worked with Katzman for a number of years; Schneer and Harryhausen went on to make ''[[Earth vs. the Flying Saucers]]'' (1956) for Katzman before Schneer left to form his own unit at Columbia.\n\nKatzman would still make Westerns such as ''[[The Gun That Won the West]]'' (1955), ''[[Seminole Uprising]]'' (1955), ''[[Blackjack Ketchum, Desperado]]'' (1955) and ''[[Duel on the Mississippi]]'' (1955), swashbucklers like ''[[Pirates of Tripoli]]'' (1955) and crime films such as ''[[New Orleans Uncensored]]'' (1955), ''[[Chicago Syndicate (film)|Chicago Syndicate]]'' (1955), ''[[The Crooked Web]]'' (1955), ''[[The Houston Story]]'' (1956), ''[[Miami Expos\u00e9]]'' (1956) and ''[[Inside Detroit]]'' (1956).  He also did the occasional thriller like ''[[Uranium Boom]]'' (1956).\n\nHowever his work had an increasing teenage focus, such as ''[[Teen-Age Crime Wave]]'' (1955) and ''[[Rumble on the Docks]]'' (1956), which were teen orientated crime films. He also started making musicals again, with rock music. \n\nIn 1955, when Columbia wanted to release the first rock-and-roll musical, Katzman reworked elements from his Gloria Jean musical ''I Surrender Dear'' into one of Columbia's biggest hits, ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' (1956) with [[Bill Haley and His Comets]].<ref>MacGillivray, Scott and Jan, ''Gloria Jean: A Little Bit of Heaven'', iUniverse, 2005</ref> This cost $300,000 and earned over $4 million.<ref name=\"may\"/> This was followed by ''[[Cha-Cha-Cha Boom!]]'' (1956), ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]]'' (1957, again with Bill Haley), ''[[Calypso Heat Wave]]'' (1957) and ''[[Juke Box Rhythm]]'' (1959, scheduled for Bill Haley but ultimately made with singer [[Jack Jones (singer)|Jack Jones]]).  \n\nKatzman also produced horror films for the teenage audience, including ''[[The Werewolf (1956 film)|The Werewolf]]'' (1956), ''[[The Man Who Turned to Stone]]'' (1957), ''[[The Giant Claw]]'' (1957), ''[[Zombies of Mora Tau]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Night the World Exploded]]'' (1957).\n\nIn May 1957 Katzman told ''Variety'' that he felt, \u201cA picture that makes money is a good picture \u2014- whether it is artistically good or bad. I\u2019m in the five and dime business and not in  the Tiffany business. I make pictures for the little theatres around the country.\u201d <ref name=\"may\"/> He added that his movies were normally budgeted between $250,000 and $500,000. He said at Columbia he had made 110 pictures, none of which lost money, and the average gross was $1 million. He said at least 40% of the 110 pictures made were still in release.<ref name=\"may\">{{cite magazine |magazine=Variety |date=1 May 1957 |page=17 |url=https://archive.org/details/variety206-1957-05/page/n16/mode/1up |title=$300,000 Picture's Gross Expectancy Same as $1-Mil Film\u2013Katzman}}</ref>\n\n\u201cEvery picture I make now has a selling gimmick aimed at the young audience,\" he said in 1957, and he made car movies, horror stories, science fiction and music.

He announced in December of that year he would double this amount over the following twelve months.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/variety209-1958-01/page/n6/mode/1up |date=1 January 1958 |page=7 |title=Katzman's Columbia 7 in '57 to be Doubled |magazine=Variety}}</ref>\n\nKatzman's later films at Columbia included some teen melodramas ''[[Going Steady (1958 film)|Going Steady]]'' (1958) and ''[[Life Begins at 17]]'' (1958);''[[Crash Landing (1958 film)|Crash Landing]]'' (1958), a disaster film based on [[Pan Am Flight 6]]; a pair of war films starring [[Van Johnson]] shot in Europe, ''[[The Last Blitzkrieg]]'' (1959) and ''[[The Enemy General]]'' (1960); and a drama about trapeze artists, ''[[The Flying Fontaines]]'' (1959).\n\n==Later career==\n===20th Century Fox===\nKatzman signed a deal with [[20th Century Fox]] starting with ''[[The Wizard of Baghdad]]'' (1960), an \"Eastern\" with [[Dick Shawn]]. He did this under a verbal agreement with [[Buddy Adler]] then in September 1960 Robert Goldstein signed him to a three picture contract. These were to be ''Gentlemen Pirates'' written by Mel Levy, a film about Mississippi gamblers written by Jesse Lasky Jr. and Pat Silver, and ''Cypress Gardens'' by Lou Morheim.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|url=https://archive.org/details/variety220-1960-09/page/n212/mode/1up/search/%22sam+katzman%22?q=%22sam+katzman%22|title=Sam Katzman on Exhib Vagaries|page=3|date=28 September 1960}}</ref> He said at the time that Hollywood was making too many blockbusters and \"the motion picture business must deal in a saleable product of entertainment at a price the public can afford and not price itself out. of the market.\u201d<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|title=Sam Katzman on Exhib Vagaries|page=30|url=https://archive.org/details/variety220-1960-09/page/n239/mode/1up/search/%22sam+katzman%22?q=%22sam+katzman%22|date=28 September 1960}}</ref>\n\nHe wound up making only one more film at Fox, ''[[Pirates of Tortuga]]'' (1961), a swashbuckler similar to many of the films he made at Columbia. \n\nHe returned to Columbia to make ''[[The Wild Westerners]]'' (1962), a Western, as well as two \"twist\" movies starring [[Chubby Checker]], ''[[Twist Around the Clock]]'' (1961) and ''[[Don't Knock the Twist]]'' (1962). These were scene-for-scene remakes of Katzman's Bill Haley musicals, with almost identical scripts.\n\n===MGM===\nKatzman accepted an offer to move his operation to MGM in 1963. He started with a low budget musical ''[[Hootenanny Hoot]]'' (1963), which led to several more musicals: ''[[Get Yourself a College Girl]]'' (1964) and ''[[When the Boys Meet the Girls]]'' (1965) (a remake of ''[[Girl Crazy (1943 film)|Girl Crazy]]''). MGM also financed three of Katzman's best known movies: two films starring [[Elvis Presley]], ''[[Kissin' Cousins]]'' (1964) and ''[[Harum Scarum (film)|Harum Scarum]]'' (1965), as well as ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), a biopic of [[Hank Williams]] starring George Hamilton. Hamilton later wrote in his memoirs that \"Jungle Sam cracked the whip, whacked the cane and the whole film was in the can right on time. But he gave me free rein creatively and our director... brought in something memorable, and even Sam knew it.\"<ref>George Hamilton & William Stadiem, ''Don't Mind If I Do'', Simon & Schuster 2008 p 182</ref>\n\nIn December 1964 Katzman announced he would make five films that year for MGM in his third year at the studio.<ref>FILMLAND EVENTS: Sam Katzman Begins Busy Year at MGM Los Angeles Times 26 Dec 1964: 19. </ref>\n\nKatzman made the [[Herman's Hermits]] film ''[[Hold On!

Sam Katzman got the call and recruited his 1940s cronies, Arthur Dreifuss and writer [[Hal Collins]], to make ''The Love-Ins'' and ''For Singles Only'' (both 1967)<ref>MacGillivray, Scott and Jan, ''Gloria Jean: A Little Bit of Heaven'', Universe, 2005</ref>\n\n===Final Movies===\nKatzman's final films were produced by his son Jerry.

The third, as-yet-unnamed, Lady Blackhawk debuted in a DC Comics title in 2011. All three characters were [[aviator|aviators]] and soldiers.\n\nReed has not appeared since the 1992 one-shot special; Blake was more recently a regular character in the [[Birds of Prey (comic book)|''Birds of Prey'']] comic book from 2004 to 2009, and from 2010 to 2011. The third Lady Blackhawk appears in the ''[[Blackhawks (DC Comics)|Blackhawks]]'' comic.\n\n==Zinda Blake==\n\n===Character history===\n'''Zinda Blake''', the first published '''Lady Blackhawk''', is a fictional [[DC Comics]] character. She was introduced in [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|''Blackhawk'']] #133 (February, 1959). (Quality's characters having been purchased by DC Comics, DC published Blackhawk from #108.)\n\nHowever, ''Military Comics'' #20 (July, 1943) featured a story about a woman who attempts to become the first woman member of the Blackhawks, who looks, sounds and behaves much like Zinda Blake, although she does not divulge her name, and never calls herself '''Lady Blackhawk'''. In the story, she flies to Blackhawk Island, declares herself part of the team, and helps the Blackhawks on a mission behind German lines. Ultimately, she rescues Blackhawk himself.\n\n====Blackhawks====\nZinda Blake, determined to become the first woman member of the famed World War II unit known as the Blackhawks, trained herself to pilot a wide range of modern aircraft and made herself an expert in various forms of combat and weaponry.\n\nHer first attempt to join the group came when she helped rescue a member from a modern-day pirate called the Scavenger. Despite her able assistance, Zinda was told that the Blackhawk codes forbade a woman from joining the team.\n\nZinda followed this exploit by rescuing the entire Blackhawk team from the Scavenger, and in return was told, by Blackhawk himself, that she could become an honorary member of the team.\n\n[[File:LadyBlackhawk133.jpg|175px|Zinda Blake debuts as Lady Blackhawk in ''Blackhawk'' #133.|thumb|left]]\n\nAfter a number of adventures with the Blackhawks, Zinda became the victim of the villainous Nazi operative [[Killer Shark]], who used a chemical potion to brainwash her, forcing her to take up the identity of the costumed Queen Killer Shark. Zinda battled her former comrades a number of times as Killer Shark's accomplice before she was freed of the effects of the potion.\n\n===Lost in time===\n\nDue to the time-warping effects of ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'', Zinda is now in the present DC continuity, looking as she did in 1959. Her whirl through time involved her assisting in the battle against the villain Extant.<ref>''Guy Gardner: Warrior'' #24 (September 1994)</ref> She has served as a supporting character to [[Guy Gardner (comics)|''Guy Gardner, Warrior'']]. During ''Zero Hour'', Zinda befriends Guy, Steel and an alternate-universe Batgirl. They have several adventures in various time periods, such as the Wild West and far future. Ultimately, the small group is separated by the events of the cross-over. Zinda perceives no time passing before she appears in front of ''Warrior's'', a nightclub that serves as a front of Guy Gardner's latest heroic endeavors. Zinda is instantly accepted by Guy and offered a place to live. Multiple times she assists him and his makeshift team against supervillains, often serving as a pilot. Zinda's companions include, but are not limited to, [[Arisia (comics)|Arisia]], who is a former [[Green Lantern Corps|Green Lantern]], Buck Wargo, a millionaire adventurer and 'Tiger-Man', a half-tiger, half-man. In one incident, Zinda suffers multiple injuries while defending Warriors patrons. She is treated at Wargo's medical facility and told she will make a full recovery.<ref>''Guy Gardner: Warrior'' #38 (January 1996)</ref>\n\n====Birds of Prey====\n\n[[File:BirdsOfPreyCv82.jpg|Cover artwork for ''Birds of Prey'' #82, by Joe Bennett. Zinda is pictured with Black Canary (center), Barbara Gordon (right), and Wildcat (left).|thumb|right]]\n\nIn 2004 Zinda began service as the team's pilot in ''[[Birds of Prey (comic book)|Birds of Prey]]''. [[Barbara Gordon]] recruits Zinda Blake as the team's fourth member. Since Zinda is looking for a change, she gladly accepts. Flashbacks reveal the other Blackhawks have died, Wu Cheng being the last. She has been having trouble fitting back in with the current Blackhawk Inc. an international shipping company (which she owns one-eighth of). Zinda accepts the job with Black Canary's unofficial group on the grounds she is in full control of any flying duties.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 1) #75 (December 2004)</ref> Zinda first suggested the name ''Birds of Prey'' for Barbara's team in ''Birds of Prey'' #86.\n\nBlake resigns from the Birds of Prey in the issue #107 rather than see Barbara Gordon forced to dismiss her under orders from the group's new leader, [[Spy Smasher]]. However, she comes to Barbara's aid in ''Birds of Prey '' #108, and rejoins the team, which is restored to Barbara's command.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nZinda is an ace flyer, able to easily handle any type of aircraft. She is a fine markswoman, skilled in the use of a variety of weapons, and has superior abilities in hand-to-hand combat.\n\n===Costume===\nBlake continues to wear her own version of the Blackhawks uniform in ''Birds of Prey'', which consists of a blue tunic, military cap, frilled miniskirt and boots. In her early appearances she was drawn wearing blue tights.\n\n==Natalie Reed==\n[[File:LadyBlackhawkCover.jpg|Natalie Reed on the cover of ''Blackhawk'' #1 (1988).|thumb]]\n\n'''Natalie Reed''' (born '''Natalie Gurdin'''), the second published woman to be known as '''Lady Blackhawk''', was introduced in the 1988 prestige format mini-series ''Blackhawk'' written and drawn by [[Howard Chaykin]].\n\n===Fictional character history===\nReed was written to have been a part of the [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawk Squadron]] (at the behest of the [[Soviet Union]]) from 1943 onwards. This retcon established her as the first Lady Blackhawk in the DCU timeline. \n\nBrooklyn-born Natalie Gurdin was the child of Benjamin and Lucille Gurdin, card-carrying members of the [[Communist Party USA]]. They raised their daughter to believe as they did. At her parents' urging, Natalie entered and won the \"Miss Young Communist League\" beauty contest in 1937. The title sparked a short-lived modeling career and a role in the low-budget 1938 film ''Gun Molls in Trouble''. Miss Gurdin changed her name to Reed at this time, in honor of [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], the American Communist journalist who lived for long periods (and died) in the Soviet Union. Natalie emigrated to Russia in 1940 to live and study.\n   \nNatalie became an expert in aeronautical engineering, and chief designer at the Valentine-Prendergast Airplane Factory. Due to the state of competition between the Soviets and the West, it is possible that her adopted country may have provided exaggerated accounts of Reed's skills as a pilot and expertise in aircraft design.\n\nReed's connection with the Blackhawks came with her contribution to the design and production of the team's modified [[Grumman]] [[XF5F Skyrocket|XF5F-1 Skyrocket]] planes. Later, while working with Soviet intelligence, she helped defeat Death Mayhew in his plot to destroy [[Manhattan]]. During this period Natalie Reed was dubbed \"Lady Blackhawk\" by the U.S. press.\n   \nAside from several publicity tours and a brief resumption of her modeling career, little is known of Miss Reed's post-war life. She briefly was employed by Blackhawk Airways in [[Singapore]] in 1947, but dropped out of sight shortly thereafter. In 1948 Natalie Reed resurfaced in New York, employed as the writer of licensed [[comic book]] adventures about the Blackhawks. She was accused of working Communist doctrines into her scripts, but she was cleared of this charge.\n   \nLittle is known about the accident that cost her the use of one eye. All files containing information about Natalie Gurdin Reed remain classified, and her current whereabouts are unknown.\n\nReed had a son with a fellow Blackhawk, Ritter Hendricksen. Hendricksen was lost in a helicopter explosion in the spring of 1948 shortly after discovering he was the father of Natalie's child, Jimmy (born in 1945; ''Blackhawk Annual'' # 1). Jimmy joined the Blackhawk Squadron as a young adult, serving first with the ground crew (circa 1963), and eventually as a pilot.\n\nAs a result of internal strife in the 1950s within the ranks of what became the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], which the Blackhawk Squadron was informally allied with, Reed was surgically altered and forced to assume the identity of Constance Darabont, a former paramour of Blackhawk and owner of Darabont Industries, a major defense contractor. She remained in that identity at least until 1968, according to ''Blackhawk Special'' # 1(1992).\n\n==The New 52==\nA new Lady Blackhawk debuted in September 2011's ''Blackhawks'' #1 as part of DC's [[The New 52]] initiative. Little has yet been revealed about her.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://acomicbookblog.com/2011/10/blackhawks-1-review/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003193225/http://acomicbookblog.com/2011/10/blackhawks-1-review/ |archive-date=2011-10-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> She, like Reed, is also seen wearing a patch over her left eye.\n\n==Rebirth==\n[[Kendra Saunders]] took the name of Lady Blackhawk in ''Dark Nights: Metal'' #1, she is the leader of the Blackhawks, an anti apocalyptic team that wants to prevent the Dark Multiverse from rising. Kendra Saunders returns to her original alias Hawkgirl in issue #5 of Dark Nights: Metal.\n\nIt is later revealed that Kendra was the Blackhawk that saved Batman during ''All-Star Batman'' issue 9, she and the Blackhawks were watching him since then.\n\n==Other versions==\nDuring the decades-long publishing history of the Blackhawks, there have been several other female characters who have tried to join the team of aviators. These range from \"Sugar\" in 1943 to Blackhawks member Hendrickson's daughter, Elsa, in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qualitycomics.blogspot.com/2011/11/lady-blackhawks.html|title=Lady Blackhawks|last=Kooiman|first=Mike|date=November 12, 2011|accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n===''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''===\nA team of jetpack-wearing female soldiers known collectively as the Lady Blackhawks appear in issue #21 of the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' tie-in comic.

Later, while working with Soviet intelligence, she helped defeat Death Mayhew in his plot to destroy [[Manhattan]]. During this period Natalie Reed was dubbed \"Lady Blackhawk\" by the U.S. press.\n   \nAside from several publicity tours and a brief resumption of her modeling career, little is known of Miss Reed's post-war life. She briefly was employed by Blackhawk Airways in [[Singapore]] in 1947, but dropped out of sight shortly thereafter. In 1948 Natalie Reed resurfaced in New York, employed as the writer of licensed [[comic book]] adventures about the Blackhawks. She was accused of working Communist doctrines into her scripts, but she was cleared of this charge.\n   \nLittle is known about the accident that cost her the use of one eye. All files containing information about Natalie Gurdin Reed remain classified, and her current whereabouts are unknown.\n\nReed had a son with a fellow Blackhawk, Ritter Hendricksen. Hendricksen was lost in a helicopter explosion in the spring of 1948 shortly after discovering he was the father of Natalie's child, Jimmy (born in 1945; ''Blackhawk Annual'' # 1). Jimmy joined the Blackhawk Squadron as a young adult, serving first with the ground crew (circa 1963), and eventually as a pilot.\n\nAs a result of internal strife in the 1950s within the ranks of what became the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], which the Blackhawk Squadron was informally allied with, Reed was surgically altered and forced to assume the identity of Constance Darabont, a former paramour of Blackhawk and owner of Darabont Industries, a major defense contractor. She remained in that identity at least until 1968, according to ''Blackhawk Special'' # 1(1992).\n\n==The New 52==\nA new Lady Blackhawk debuted in September 2011's ''Blackhawks'' #1 as part of DC's [[The New 52]] initiative. Little has yet been revealed about her.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://acomicbookblog.com/2011/10/blackhawks-1-review/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003193225/http://acomicbookblog.com/2011/10/blackhawks-1-review/ |archive-date=2011-10-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> She, like Reed, is also seen wearing a patch over her left eye.\n\n==Rebirth==\n[[Kendra Saunders]] took the name of Lady Blackhawk in ''Dark Nights: Metal'' #1, she is the leader of the Blackhawks, an anti apocalyptic team that wants to prevent the Dark Multiverse from rising. Kendra Saunders returns to her original alias Hawkgirl in issue #5 of Dark Nights: Metal.\n\nIt is later revealed that Kendra was the Blackhawk that saved Batman during ''All-Star Batman'' issue 9, she and the Blackhawks were watching him since then.\n\n==Other versions==\nDuring the decades-long publishing history of the Blackhawks, there have been several other female characters who have tried to join the team of aviators. These range from \"Sugar\" in 1943 to Blackhawks member Hendrickson's daughter, Elsa, in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qualitycomics.blogspot.com/2011/11/lady-blackhawks.html|title=Lady Blackhawks|last=Kooiman|first=Mike|date=November 12, 2011|accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n===''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''===\nA team of jetpack-wearing female soldiers known collectively as the Lady Blackhawks appear in issue #21 of the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' tie-in comic.
