In 1888 she married [[Amadeo I of Spain|Prince Amadeo, Duke of Aosta]], the former king of Spain and her uncle.<ref>Appleton, p. 447.</ref> Maria Letizia became the '''[[Duchess of Aosta]]''', Duke of Aosta being a title by which Amadeus was known before and after his kingship. Their marriage was instrumental in almost reviving French hopes of reinstating the [[House of Bonaparte|Bonaparte]] dynasty into a position of power, as seen in the days of [[Napoleon III]].\n\n==Family and early life==\nMaria Letizia's father [[Napol\u00e9on Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte|Napol\u00e9on Joseph]] was a nephew of Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] through his brother [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], King of Westphalia. This then made Maria Letizia a great-niece of Emperor Napoleon. Her mother [[Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy|Maria Clotilde]] was a daughter of [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]]. Through this connection, Maria Letizia was a niece of [[Umberto I of Italy|King Umberto I of Italy]] and [[Maria Pia of Savoy|Queen Maria Pia of Portugal]].\n\n[[Image:Napol\u00e9on Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte painting.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Maria Letizia's father Napol\u00e9on Joseph Bonaparte]]\nMaria Letizia was born in the [[Palais Royal]] in Paris on 20 November 1866, during the last few years of the [[Second French Empire]].<ref name=\"Vizetelly, p. 226\">Vizetelly, p. 226.</ref> She grew up living between Paris, Rome and elsewhere in Italy with her two brothers [[Napol\u00e9on Victor Bonaparte|Napol\u00e9on Victor]] and Louis. After the fall of the French Empire in 1870, their family resided in a beautiful estate near [[Lake Geneva]].<ref>Remsen Whitehouse, p. 313.</ref>\n\n===State of parents' marriage===\nTheir parents' marriage was unhappy, however, particularly as Maria Clotilde preferred the quieter, more duty-filled life that she felt they should maintain, while Napol\u00e9on Joseph preferred the faster, more entertainment-filled lifestyle of the French court. Another factor in their unhappy marriage was the circumstances leading up to their espousal. Maria Clotilde had been only 15 when they were married, while he had been over 37 years old.<ref name=V225>Vizetelly, p. 225.</ref> The marriage had also been negotiated out of political reasons during the conference of [[Plombi\u00e8res-les-Bains|Plombi\u00e8res]] (July 1858).<ref name=V225/> As Maria Clotilde was too young at the time for marriage, Napol\u00e9on Joseph had had to wait until the following year; many had disapproved of the speed he undertook collecting his young bride in Turin.<ref name=V225/> Their marriage was often compared to that of an elephant and a gazelle; the bridegroom had strong Napoleonic features (broad, bulky, and ponderous) while the bride appeared frail, short, fair-haired, and with the characteristic nose of the House of Savoy.<ref name=V225/>\n\n[[Image:MariaClothildeSavoye.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Maria Letizia's mother Maria Clotilde of Savoy]]\nThe marriage was also unpopular with both the French and the Italians; the latter in particular felt that the daughter of their king had been sacrificed to an unpopular member of the House of Bonaparte and consequently regarded it as a ''[[m\u00e9salliance]]''.<ref>Vizetelly, pp. 225\u201326.</ref> For France's part, Napol\u00e9on Joseph was ill-regarded and had been known to carry on a number of affairs both before and during his marriage. Their official reception into Paris on 4 February was greeted very coldly by Parisians, not out of disrespect for a daughter of the king of Sardinia, but instead out of dislike for her new husband.<ref name=V225/> Indeed, all her life public sympathy tended to lean in her favour; she was fondly regarded as retiring, charitable, pious, and trapped in an unhappy marriage.<ref name=\"Vizetelly, p. 226\"/>\n\nAfter Maria Clotilde's father Victor Emmanuel died in 1878, she returned to Turin, Italy without her husband. During this period, Maria Letizia mostly resided with her mother in the [[Castle of Moncalieri]], but her two brothers stayed mainly with their father.<ref>Remsen Whitehouse, pp. 313\u2013314.</ref> It was in Italy that their mother withdrew herself from society to dedicate herself to religion and various charities. As a result of her mother's religious devotion, Maria Letizia was raised in a [[convent]]-like atmosphere.<ref name=nyt2/>\n\n===Suitors===\nBy her late teens, Maria Letizia was considered by some contemporaries to be beautiful and to be in appearance a \"real Bonaparte\".<ref name=nyt2/> She was said to have resembled some of the sisters of Napoleon Bonaparte, who were considered quite beautiful in their day.<ref name=wp1/>\n\nIn Florence, Maria Letizia met and almost married her cousin [[Prince Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Aosta|Prince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy]].<ref name=wp1>{{Citation\n  | title = Count of Salemi Atones For Escapades By War Heroism\n  | newspaper = The Washington Post\n  | date = 11 January 1918\n  | accessdate = <!-----23 February 2010----->}}</ref> A change of plans occurred however, and the marriage never took place.

He was her maternal uncle and was formerly the elected king of Spain for a brief period of three years (1870\u20131873).\n\nMaria Letizia was considered very charming, and Amadeus was very dependent on her society when he visited Italy. In 1888, she agreed to marry him. One source attributes the marriage to the fact that Amadeus felt great love for his niece, but states that Maria Letizia's decision was simply a \"strong desire for independence on the part of the Princess because of the heaviness of the maternal yoke\".<ref name=nyt1>{{Citation|title=To Stop Consanguineous Marriages|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 September 1902|accessdate=<!--23 February 2010-->}}</ref> In preparation for the marriage, she received a great number of notable gifts from personages such as [[Empress Eugenie]], the widowed wife of [[Napoleon III]], and Amadeus' three sons.<ref name=nyt5>{{Citation|title=French Midsummer Talk|newspaper=The New York Times|location=Paris, France|date=15 July 1888|accessdate=<!---26 February 2010-->}}</ref>\n\nEugenie sent her some \"great and illustrious\" family jewels, while the boys gave her a necklace with seven rows of pearls that was valued at sixty-thousand dollars.<ref name=nyt5/> The couple planned to marry in Turin with the hopes of turning the city into a \"brilliant centre of attraction in Italy\".<ref name=nyt5/>\n\n===Cause for scandal===\nThe announcement of their marriage caused a great scandal in the Italian court, as he was not only twenty-two years older, but was also her mother's brother. Nevertheless, later that year the necessary Papal dispensation was obtained, giving them permission to marry. Although the Pope gave them permission, the [[consanguinity]] of their marriage, along with those of other royal houses would later lead in 1902 to [[Pope Leo XIII]] declaring that no more dispensations would be given for these types of marriages.<ref name=nyt1/>\n\n===Wedding===\nThey wedded that same year, on 11 September 1888 at the [[Royal Palace of Turin]] in Turin, Italy.<ref name=nyt3>{{Citation|title=In the Palace at Turin|newspaper=The New York Times|location=London, UK|date=12 September 1888|accessdate=<!--23 February 2010-->}}</ref> The ceremony was performed by the [[Archbishop of Turin]], [[Gaetano Alimonda|Cardinal Gaetano Alimonda]], who had been the man responsible for traveling to Rome for their dispensation.<ref name=nyt5/> Their wedding was attended by many members of the houses of Bonaparte and Savoy, including [[Maria Pia of Savoy|Queen Maria Pia of Portugal]], who was Amadeus' sister and Maria Letizia's maternal aunt.<ref name=nyt3/><ref name=\"Remsen Whitehouse, p. 314\">Remsen Whitehouse, p. 314.</ref> Maria Letizia was Amadeus' second wife, as his first spouse [[Maria Vittoria del Pozzo della Cisterna]] had died in 1876. Due to the large age difference, Maria Letizia was only three years older than Amadeus' eldest child. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe wedding was notable for being the first marriage between a Bonaparte and a member of a reigning house of Europe since 1859.<ref name=nyt3/> As it was the first major event since the fall of the [[Second French Republic]], the marriage was instrumental in bringing considerable attention back to the prospects of the Bonapartes among various members of the press, especially pertaining to the establishment of another possible government.<ref name=nyt4>{{Citation|title=French Talk of the Day|newspaper=The New York Times|location=Paris, France|date=10 June 1888|accessdate=<!---23 February 2010-->}}</ref>\n\nOne article stated that at the time of their marriage, a Bonaparte would have had an easy chance of obtaining at least two million votes if a [[plebiscite]] were to occur.<ref name=nyt4/> This likelihood of a Bonaparte resurgence was most likely because there was a certain nostalgia among the French for the days of Maria Letizia's great uncle [[Napoleon I]] and even for the more recent rule of her uncle [[Napoleon III]].<ref name=nyt4/>\n\nThe couple lived in Turin and had one son: [[Prince Umberto, Count of Salemi]] (22 June 1889 \u2013 19 October 1918).<ref name=\"Remsen Whitehouse, p. 314\"/> He died of the Spanish flu during World War I. Maria Letizia became widowed soon after their wedding, as Amadeus died less than two years after their marriage in Turin, on 18 January 1890.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Prince Umberto, Count of Salemi.jpg|upright|thumb|Maria Letizia's only child [[Prince Umberto, Count of Salemi]] in an undated photograph.]]\n\n===Relationship with the Italian court===\nUp to 1902, Umberto and his mother were rarely seen at the Italian court.<ref name=wp4>{{Citation|title=Royal Marriages and the Vatican|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=17 August 1902|accessdate=<!--23 February 2010-->}}</ref> No images of Umberto were ever distributed, unlike other members of the Italian royal family. His absence sparked many rumors, some implying that he was \"mentally afflicted\" or \"misshapen\".<ref name=wp4/> In later years, he would appear more in the press, disproving all of these theories.\n\nAmadeus's first wife had been a wealthy woman; upon her death, she left her vast fortune to him and their three sons. This meant that any wealth Amadeus had accumulated went to his first three children, leaving little to nothing upon his death for Maria Letizia and their son [[Prince Umberto, Count of Salemi|Umberto]].<ref name=wp1/> They thus remained dependent upon the allowance they received from the Italian crown.<ref name=wp1/> This dependency would cause problems later, as Umberto often angered his cousin [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]], the head of the [[House of Savoy]]. After Umberto committed various misdemeanors and pranks in 1911, he was imprisoned in [[Castle of Moncalieri|Moncalieri Castle]].<ref name=wp2>{{Citation|title=King Punishes His Cousin|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=16 July 1911|accessdate=<!--23 February 2010-->}}</ref>\n\nHe had recently been dismissed from the [[Accademia Navale di Livorno|naval academy]] in [[Livorno]] for what was apparently incorrigible behavior and amorous attentions to some young women in the town.<ref name=wp2/> Maria Letizia, worried over what she considered her son's harsh sentence, wrote to [[Elena of Montenegro|Queen Helena]] and asked her to intercede for her son.<ref name=wp2/> The King remained adamant, however, and only reduced the sentence slightly due to the recent death of his aunt [[Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy|Princess Maria Clotilde]], Maria Letizia's mother.<ref name=wp2/>\n\n===Death and inheritance===\nDuring her widowhood, Maria Letizia maintained an open and scandalous relationship with a military man twenty years her junior and later husband to the opera singer Vina Bovy. Upon her death on 25 October 1926, he was revealed to be the sole heir in her will, as her son died in 1918.\n\n==Titles and styles==\n{{unsourced section|date=February 2020}}\n*20 November 1866 \u2013 11 September 1888: ''Her Imperial Highness'' Maria Letizia Bonaparte, Princess Fran\u00e7aise\n*11 September 1888 \u2013 18 January 1890: ''Her Imperial and Royal Highness'' The Duchess of Aosta\n*18 January 1890 \u2013 26 October 1926: ''Her Imperial and Royal Highness'' The Dowager Duchess of Aosta\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

Although the Pope gave them permission, the [[consanguinity]] of their marriage, along with those of other royal houses would later lead in 1902 to [[Pope Leo XIII]] declaring that no more dispensations would be given for these types of marriages.<ref name=nyt1/>\n\n===Wedding===\nThey wedded that same year, on 11 September 1888 at the [[Royal Palace of Turin]] in Turin, Italy.<ref name=nyt3>{{Citation|title=In the Palace at Turin|newspaper=The New York Times|location=London, UK|date=12 September 1888|accessdate=<!--23 February 2010-->}}</ref> The ceremony was performed by the [[Archbishop of Turin]], [[Gaetano Alimonda|Cardinal Gaetano Alimonda]], who had been the man responsible for traveling to Rome for their dispensation.<ref name=nyt5/> Their wedding was attended by many members of the houses of Bonaparte and Savoy, including [[Maria Pia of Savoy|Queen Maria Pia of Portugal]], who was Amadeus' sister and Maria Letizia's maternal aunt.<ref name=nyt3/><ref name=\"Remsen Whitehouse, p. 314\">Remsen Whitehouse, p. 314.</ref> Maria Letizia was Amadeus' second wife, as his first spouse [[Maria Vittoria del Pozzo della Cisterna]] had died in 1876. Due to the large age difference, Maria Letizia was only three years older than Amadeus' eldest child. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe wedding was notable for being the first marriage between a Bonaparte and a member of a reigning house of Europe since 1859.<ref name=nyt3/> As it was the first major event since the fall of the [[Second French Republic]], the marriage was instrumental in bringing considerable attention back to the prospects of the Bonapartes among various members of the press, especially pertaining to the establishment of another possible government.<ref name=nyt4>{{Citation|title=French Talk of the Day|newspaper=The New York Times|location=Paris, France|date=10 June 1888|accessdate=<!---23 February 2010-->}}</ref>\n\nOne article stated that at the time of their marriage, a Bonaparte would have had an easy chance of obtaining at least two million votes if a [[plebiscite]] were to occur.<ref name=nyt4/> This likelihood of a Bonaparte resurgence was most likely because there was a certain nostalgia among the French for the days of Maria Letizia's great uncle [[Napoleon I]] and even for the more recent rule of her uncle [[Napoleon III]].<ref name=nyt4/>\n\nThe couple lived in Turin and had one son: [[Prince Umberto, Count of Salemi]] (22 June 1889 \u2013 19 October 1918).<ref name=\"Remsen Whitehouse, p. 314\"/> He died of the Spanish flu during World War I. Maria Letizia became widowed soon after their wedding, as Amadeus died less than two years after their marriage in Turin, on 18 January 1890.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Prince Umberto, Count of Salemi.jpg|upright|thumb|Maria Letizia's only child [[Prince Umberto, Count of Salemi]] in an undated photograph.]]\n\n===Relationship with the Italian court===\nUp to 1902, Umberto and his mother were rarely seen at the Italian court.<ref name=wp4>{{Citation|title=Royal Marriages and the Vatican|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=17 August 1902|accessdate=<!--23 February 2010-->}}</ref> No images of Umberto were ever distributed, unlike other members of the Italian royal family. His absence sparked many rumors, some implying that he was \"mentally afflicted\" or \"misshapen\".<ref name=wp4/> In later years, he would appear more in the press, disproving all of these theories.\n\nAmadeus's first wife had been a wealthy woman; upon her death, she left her vast fortune to him and their three sons. This meant that any wealth Amadeus had accumulated went to his first three children, leaving little to nothing upon his death for Maria Letizia and their son [[Prince Umberto, Count of Salemi|Umberto]].<ref name=wp1/> They thus remained dependent upon the allowance they received from the Italian crown.<ref name=wp1/> This dependency would cause problems later, as Umberto often angered his cousin [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]], the head of the [[House of Savoy]]. After Umberto committed various misdemeanors and pranks in 1911, he was imprisoned in [[Castle of Moncalieri|Moncalieri Castle]].<ref name=wp2>{{Citation|title=King Punishes His Cousin|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=16 July 1911|accessdate=<!--23 February 2010-->}}</ref>\n\nHe had recently been dismissed from the [[Accademia Navale di Livorno|naval academy]] in [[Livorno]] for what was apparently incorrigible behavior and amorous attentions to some young women in the town.<ref name=wp2/> Maria Letizia, worried over what she considered her son's harsh sentence, wrote to [[Elena of Montenegro|Queen Helena]] and asked her to intercede for her son.<ref name=wp2/> The King remained adamant however, and only reduced the sentence slightly due to the recent death of his aunt [[Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy|Princess Maria Clotilde]], Maria Letizia's mother.<ref name=wp2/>\n\n===Death and inheritance===\nDuring her widowhood, Maria Letizia maintained an open and scandalous relationship with a military man twenty years her junior and later husband to the opera singer Vina Bovy. Upon her death on 25 October 1926, he was revealed to be the sole heir in her will, as her son died in 1918.\n\n==Titles and styles==\n{{unsourced section|date=February 2020}}\n*20 November 1866 \u2013 11 September 1888: ''Her Imperial Highness'' Maria Letizia Bonaparte, Princess Fran\u00e7aise\n*11 September 1888 \u2013 18 January 1890: ''Her Imperial and Royal Highness'' The Duchess of Aosta\n*18 January 1890 \u2013 26 October 1926: ''Her Imperial and Royal Highness'' The Dowager Duchess of Aosta\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

History ==\n===Beginnings (2014\u20132010101)===\nHarlem Spartans started making music in 2014, using a local youth centre as a music studio. Most artists within Harlem Spartans are from [[Kennington]], with many of them going to Tenison\u2019s School in Oval. Musically, like much of UK drill music, their music contains references to their local area, violence, references to beef with other groups, and is often riddled with slang.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\nThe group is known for its beef with Brixton-based group 410.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crackmagazine.net/article/long-reads/them-pretty-new-blocks-drill-music-and-gentrification-in-south-london/|title=Them Pretty New Blocks: Drill Music and Gentrification in South London|website=Crack Magazine|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903022103/https://crackmagazine.net/article/long-reads/them-pretty-new-blocks-drill-music-and-gentrification-in-south-london/|archive-date=2019-09-03|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2018/01/uk-drill-sl-harlem-spartans-67-essay|title=Get Familiar With UK Drill, the New Sound Exploding on the Streets of London|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611131706/https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2018/01/uk-drill-sl-harlem-spartans-67-essay|archive-date=2019-06-11|url-status=live}}</ref> The beef has been expressed through various diss tracks, and has at times escalated to physical violence. 410 member AM released the song \"Attempted 1.0\" in 2018. The song contained many direct references to violence towards Harlem Spartans members. [[Skengdo & AM]], members of 410, were later given a gang injunction from the police that banned them from entering Kennington or mentioning rival gangs in their music.\n\n===Rise to fame and success of Harlem Spartans (2018\u2013present)===\nProminent songs from the group include \"Call Me a Spartan\",<ref name=\"auto5\" /> \"Kennington Where It Started\",<ref name=\"auto5\" /> and Loski's songs \"Cool Kid\", \"Hazards\", and \"Forrest Gump\", the latter of which entered the charts. In April of 2018, Loski released his mixtape ''Call Me Loose.''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/10/loski-interview-the-break/|title=The Break Presents: Loski - XXL|last=Rathod|first=Nikita|website=XXL Mag|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523214845/https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/10/loski-interview-the-break/|archive-date=2019-05-23|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev3y4p/loski-boasy-new-video-track-interview-2019|title=Drill Artist Loski Is Dripping with Flair|last=Bassil|first=Ryan|date=2019-01-11|website=Vice|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212162720/https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev3y4p/loski-boasy-new-video-track-interview-2019|archive-date=2019-12-12|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCanadian artist [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] has publicly stated he is a 'fan' of Harlem Spartans,<ref name=\"auto5\" /> and has posted Harlem Spartan music lyrics onto his social media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://choiceradio.co.uk/blanco-return-of-bourne/|title=Blanco - Return Of Bourne|date=2019-02-01|website=Choice For Music UK Radio|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212034430/https://choiceradio.co.uk/blanco-return-of-bourne/|archive-date=2019-12-12|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2019, Drake appeared on-stage alongside Harlem Spartans member Loski.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.capitalxtra.com/news/loski-arrested-harlem-spartans-rumours/|title=Loski Arrest Rumours: Rapper Appears In Snapchat Video 'Filmed In Prison Cell'|website=Capital XTRA|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212034419/https://www.capitalxtra.com/news/loski-arrested-harlem-spartans-rumours/|archive-date=2019-12-12|url-status=live}}</ref> Drake credited Loski as an influence for his [[Scorpion (Drake album)|Scorpion]] album.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Members ==\nThe list below includes confirmed members of Harlem Spartans.

History ==\n===Beginnings (2014\u20132010101)===\nHarlem Spartans started making music in 2014, using a local youth centre as a music studio. Most artists within Harlem Spartans are from [[Kennington]], with many of them going to Tenison\u2019s School in Oval. Musically, like much of UK drill music, their music contains references to their local area, violence, references to beef with other groups, and is often riddled with slang.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\nThe group is known for its beef with Brixton-based group 410.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crackmagazine.net/article/long-reads/them-pretty-new-blocks-drill-music-and-gentrification-in-south-london/|title=Them Pretty New Blocks: Drill Music and Gentrification in South London|website=Crack Magazine|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903022103/https://crackmagazine.net/article/long-reads/them-pretty-new-blocks-drill-music-and-gentrification-in-south-london/|archive-date=2019-09-03|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2018/01/uk-drill-sl-harlem-spartans-67-essay|title=Get Familiar With UK Drill, the New Sound Exploding on the Streets of London|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611131706/https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2018/01/uk-drill-sl-harlem-spartans-67-essay|archive-date=2019-06-11|url-status=live}}</ref> The beef has been expressed through various diss tracks, and has at times escalated to physical violence. 410 member AM released the song \"Attempted 1.0\" in 2018. The song contained many direct references to violence towards Harlem Spartans members. AM, and 410 member Skengdo, were later given a gang injunction from the police that banned them from entering Kennington or mentioning rival gangs in their music.\n\n===Rise to fame and success of Harlem Spartans (2018\u2013present)===\nProminent songs from the group include \"Call Me a Spartan\",<ref name=\"auto5\" /> \"Kennington Where It Started\",<ref name=\"auto5\" /> and Loski's songs \"Cool Kid\", \"Hazards\", and \"Forrest Gump\", the latter of which entered the charts. In April of 2018, Loski released his mixtape ''Call Me Loose.''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/10/loski-interview-the-break/|title=The Break Presents: Loski - XXL|last=Rathod|first=Nikita|website=XXL Mag|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523214845/https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/10/loski-interview-the-break/|archive-date=2019-05-23|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev3y4p/loski-boasy-new-video-track-interview-2019|title=Drill Artist Loski Is Dripping with Flair|last=Bassil|first=Ryan|date=2019-01-11|website=Vice|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212162720/https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev3y4p/loski-boasy-new-video-track-interview-2019|archive-date=2019-12-12|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCanadian artist [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] has publicly stated he is a 'fan' of Harlem Spartans,<ref name=\"auto5\" /> and has posted Harlem Spartan music lyrics onto his social media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://choiceradio.co.uk/blanco-return-of-bourne/|title=Blanco - Return Of Bourne|date=2019-02-01|website=Choice For Music UK Radio|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212034430/https://choiceradio.co.uk/blanco-return-of-bourne/|archive-date=2019-12-12|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2019, Drake appeared on-stage alongside Harlem Spartans member Loski.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.capitalxtra.com/news/loski-arrested-harlem-spartans-rumours/|title=Loski Arrest Rumours: Rapper Appears In Snapchat Video 'Filmed In Prison Cell'|website=Capital XTRA|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212034419/https://www.capitalxtra.com/news/loski-arrested-harlem-spartans-rumours/|archive-date=2019-12-12|url-status=live}}</ref> Drake credited Loski as an influence for his [[Scorpion (Drake album)|Scorpion]] album.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Members ==\nThe list below includes confirmed members of Harlem Spartans.
