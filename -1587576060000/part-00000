Marlena has several children by several different fathers, including daughters [[Kathleen McQueen|Kathleen]], [[Myra McQueen|Myra]], [[Reenie McQueen|Reenie]] and son Louis. Marlena fell pregnant with Kathleen in her early 20s. She married a man named Reggie soon after. They had one daughter, Myra. Reggie and Marlena divorced after several arguments and affairs. It is unknown who are the fathers of Kathleen, Reenie and Louis.\n\nAt age 14, Myra fell for the charms of Martin Brownlow and they began a relationship. They slept together and Myra fell pregnant by Martin, who left her. Ashamed of this, Marlena forced Myra keep her pregnancy a secret. When the baby arrived, Myra and Marlena left the baby, named [[Niall Rafferty|Matthew]], on the doorstep of a church with only a note as an explanation. The baby was subsequently put into care as Myra promised to return for her son one day. After this, Myra began a relationship with a man named [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2011)#Billy Alexander|Billy Alexander]] and became pregnant with her eldest daughter [[Jacqui McQueen|Jacqui]] one year after she had Matthew; Jacqui had always assumed she was the eldest. Myra chose to keep Jacqui instead of going through the pain of giving up another child. Myra had her second daughter with Billy one year later and named her [[Mercedes McQueen|Mercedes]]. Billy left Myra and his daughters soon after Mercedes was born. At aged 19, Myra gave birth to [[Tina Reilly|Tina]] following a one-night stand with a married man named Marvin Bassman who refused to be involved in his daughter's life. She named her daughter after [[Tina Turner]]. Later that year in 1985, Myra met [[Ricky Bowen]] and began a relationship with him. Myra had [[Carmel McQueen|Carmel]] with Ricky. Two years later, while Ricky and Myra were on a break, she gave birth to a son called [[John Paul McQueen|John Paul]] by a projectionist she met at a Chester cinema called Iain Naismith, however he left her so that he could transition into his female alter-ego, [[Sally St. Claire]]. Myra lied to Ricky and told him John Paul was his son. Finally, Myra had [[Michaela McQueen|Michaela]] in 1991 by Ricky again. Ricky left the family in 1992 and later married and had another son named Richard.\n\nKathleen had one daughter who she named [[Theresa McQueen|Theresa]], Theresa's father was believed to be a man named Don, but it was later revealed that Billy Alexander was her father after Kathleen had a one-night stand with him at a nightclub. It is assumed Kathleen lied to Don about Theresa being his daughter.\n\nLouis went on to join the army and has a son who was also called Louis. Louis Sr. was killed in action, this inspired Louis Jr. to follow in his father's footsteps and enroll in the army too.\n\nReenie was repeatedly raped by Marlena's abusive boyfriend [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2015)#Derek Clough|Derek Clough]], which she kept a secret from the rest of her family; he impregnated her at 15 and she later gave birth to her daughter [[Porsche McQueen|Porsche]] in 1991. Reenie was originally supposed to give Porsche up for adoption but decided against it. For years it was believed by everyone that Porsche's father was a boy named Mickey, who grew up in the same estate as the McQueens. Reenie had another two daughters with Porsche's presumed father Mickey. She gave birth to [[Celine McQueen|Celine]] in 1994 and then finally in 1998, she gave birth to [[Cleo McQueen|Cleo]]. When the girls were young, Mickey was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. Reenie's boyfriend, [[Pete Buchanan]], subjected Porsche, Celine and Cleo to varying levels of abuse, most notably [[Child molestation|sexually abusing]] Porsche and Cleo and damaging Celine's confidence. There was an incident one Christmas where Derek got excessively drunk and punched Marlena, ultimately breaking her jaw.\n\nMarguerite was married to a pig farmer and they had at least three children, [[Breda McQueen|Breda]], Victor and Valene. Marguerite's husband was a violent alcoholic who would beat her and their daughter Breda. He died after drunkenly falling down the stairs and hitting his head. Their son Victor continually shamed and disappointed his family by getting involved in crime and drugs. Victor married a woman named Sarah in the late 1980s. Sarah gave birth to Victor's son [[Bart McQueen|Bart]]. Victor was an unfaithful husband which ruined his marriage. Sarah left when Bart was five. Soon after the breakdown of his marriage, Victor remarried a woman named Joan. Joan immediately took on the responsibility of being Bart's mother and stayed loyal to Victor and his son even though Victor took advantage of her good nature and found it difficult to stay faithful. Joan died in 2010.\n\nBreda became a nanny and was devoted to the children she cared for. She was also a strict Catholic woman, married to a man named Vinnie Bletcher. On Christmas Day 1986, while pregnant with her and Vinnie's daughter, [[Goldie McQueen|Goldie]], Breda brought toys to the home of her charge, three-year-old Peter, who was being raised by an abusive father called Wes after his mother, Harriet, abandoned them. Wes was about to hit Peter before Breda bludgeoned him over the head with an angel ornament. After murdering his father, Breda took Peter in and adopted him, renaming him [[Sylver McQueen|Sylver]]. They lived on a farm but Vinnie became abusive towards his Sylver and Goldie. Adoptive third cousins, Sylver and Mercedes, lost their virginity to each other when they were 14 years old. Soon after, thirteen-year-old Goldie learns she is pregnant to boyfriend [[Shane Sweeney]]. When a drunken Vinnie discovered this, he went flew into a violent rage, threatening Goldie and her unborn baby. During a struggle, Sylver pushed Vinnie down the stairs. Believing he had killed his stepfather, a terrified Sylver called the police. When Breda discovered Vinnie was still alive, she delivered the fatal blow that killed him. Breda allowed Sylver to think he had killed Vinnie and he went to prison for eighteen years. Goldie gave birth to twins, [[Prince McQueen|Prince]] and [[Hunter McQueen|Hunter]]. Marguerite has at least one other son who died in prison after being incarcerated for arson. Valene has not yet been mentioned.\n\n==In ''Hollyoaks''==\nIn 2006, Michaela was the first McQueen to be seen on-screen in ''Hollyoaks''. Michaela's first appearance was [[Retroactive continuity|retconed]] as she had the last name of \"Jones\" and was stated as living in a rough part of the village with her grandmother. Michaela was later seen at her best friend [[Amy Barnes]]' house with her father [[Mike Barnes (Hollyoaks)|Mike]], who was embarrassing his daughter, but made Michaela happy. She pressured Amy into having sex with her short-term boyfriend, [[Ste Hay]], so that her boyfriend, [[List of minor Hollyoaks characters (2005)#Wayne Tunnicliffe|Wayne Tunnicliffe]], would not dump her. Michaela claimed she had had sex with her previous boyfriend, Paul, and that a girl had to put out in order to attract boys. When Ste dumped Amy, Michaela's nasty streak became apparent as she abandoned her friend and teased her, before going off with Wayne and Ste, leaving Amy upset and alone. When Amy stood up to her, they had a fight in the playground. However, the next day Michaela got a taste of her own medicine when she was dumped by Wayne. He dumped her by text message, saying he only went out with her because she was easy. Amy and Michaela reconciled as friends, but Michaela then led her to shoplifting. Michaela was then [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] into being a McQueen with a large family and a mother. The next McQueen to make an appearance was her sister, Mercedes. The pair pulled off a scam at Evissa, in which Mercedes claimed to have been injured during a massage. The only McQueen not to appear was Jacqui, the explanation being that she was in prison for shoplifting. When she finally arrived, she came in tow with an old friend named Davey, who wanted his money from her. Carmel had already found this money and had spent it on [[breast implants]]. Davey left after Jacqui agreed to do him any favour. When he returned, he made Jacqui marry illegal immigrant, [[Aleksander Malota]]. Carmel and Alek fell for one another and began an affair, just as Jacqui fell for [[Tony Hutchinson]]. Being the only male, John Paul appeared to be pressured into \"keeping the family name\". His family had mixed opinions when he came out as gay. He began a relationship with his supposedly straight best friend, [[Craig Dean]]. Their affair began one of the shows' most popular pairings known by fans as [[John Paul McQueen and Craig Dean|McDean]].\n\nMercedes had begun a relationship with [[Russ Owen]] and they became engaged. Tina also got engaged to [[Dom Reilly]]. The pairs eventually settled on a double-marriage, the marriage of Russ and Mercedes was short lived when he discovered she had sex with [[Warren Fox]]. Michaela began smoking [[marijuana]], under the influence of [[Ste Hay]] and [[Nige Foster]]. After their affair was exposed, John Paul and Craig decided to leave for [[Dublin]], however after realising Craig could not face his sexuality, John Paul left him at the airport. Jacqui and Tony had begun trying for a child. When she became pregnant, Jacqui lost the baby and was told she could not have children. Tony became agitated when everyone assumed Alek had been the father of the baby. Carmel decided to run away with Alek, however he could not take her away from her family so left her. Jacqui was shocked to discover Tony had a ten-year-old son named [[List of minor Hollyoaks characters (2007)#Harry Thomson|Harry Thomson]]. She became increasingly frustrated and jealous and told Tony to choose between her and his son. After he chose Harry, Jacqui left him. At this time, a drunken Mercedes comforted Tony and the pair had sex. Mercedes fell pregnant and decided to have an abortion. Jacqui pleaded with her to have the baby for her, not realising it was Tony's. Knowing this, Mercedes went ahead with the abortion leaving Jacqui devastated. Myra offered herself as a surrogate mother for Jacqui; however, realising Myra would have to go through yet another pregnancy, Jacqui refused. Tina then became the surrogate. After being neglected by Dom, Tina had sex with Russ.\n\n[[File:McQueen sisters.JPG|right|thumb|240px|The McQueen sisters (L-R: [[Jacqui McQueen|Jacqui]], [[Michaela McQueen|Michaela]], [[Tina Reilly|Tina]], [[Carmel McQueen|Carmel]] and [[Mercedes McQueen|Mercedes]]).]]\n\nA stranger arrived in Hollyoaks as a new hairstylist at Evissa. [[Niall Rafferty]] was soon revealed as a secret child of Myra, who she had been forced to give up when she was 14. Niall befriended most of the McQueens but fell under suspicion of Jacqui. He soon began putting in a plan of revenge. Local priest, [[Kieron Hobbs]] arrived to stay with The McQueens. Soon after this, he and John Paul began a secret relationship. Tina became pregnant, but soon discovered Russ was the biological father. Niall injected Michaela with [[heroin]] to make her family believe she was an addict. Niall began having feelings for [[Steph Dean]], and was jealous when she engaged to [[Max Cunningham]]. Carmel began a relationship with [[Calvin Valentine]], whom she got engaged to. Niall was distraught on the day of Steph and Max's wedding. He ended up accidentally running over and killing Max as a result of his anger. Tina decided to give her unborn child up for adoption, Niall, overhearing this, ended up pushing her down a flight of stairs. Tina gave birth to [[Max McQueen (Hollyoaks)|Max McQueen]] and as a cause and had to go under an emergency hysterectomy. Due to this, Tina decided to keep Max for herself as she could never have a child of her own. Niall and Steph soon began a relationship. The pair were caught out by John Paul and Kieron, who were also continuing their affair.\n\nMyra decided to track down her first-born son with the help of Kieron. Kieron tracked down the foster mother of Matthew, who then showed him a photograph of Niall. Craig returned to Hollyoaks to win back John Paul, only to find him engaged to Kieron. Kieron approached Niall with the picture. Niall revealed the truth and agreed to confess to Myra. Panicking, Niall laced Kieron's beer with pills. Kieron collapsed and died in his arms. Niall covered up the death by making it look like suicide. Niall was infuriated when John Paul decided to leave for Dublin with Craig. Niall put pills in John Paul's beer and attempted to kill him, however John Paul swapped their drinks after spilling Niall's. Mercedes had begun a relationship with [[Malachy Fisher]], however was shocked to discover he has HIV. Niall discovered [[Jack Osborne]] had been responsible for jailing his birth father Martin. Martin died in prison as a result of his conviction. Niall then attacked Jack and told him who he really was. Niall then took his final revenge on the McQueens by kidnapping them one by one and holding them hostage in the church he had been abandoned at birth. An injured Jack sought the help of [[Darren Osborne]], Tony and Dom to save the McQueens. With the truth revealed, Niall asked Myra 6 questions. For each one she got right, she could choose one of her children to live and each she got wrong, she could choose one to die. Myra ended up getting two questions right. Mercedes told Myra to choose her to die as she may have HIV; she then admitted to Jacqui that she had sex with Tony. John Paul also offered himself to die.

Kathleen later discovers that Sonny is an alcoholic, and she later goes into partnership with Phoebe and Mercedes to get rid of him.

In a bid to get rid of Sonny, Myra concocts a plan with Mercedes and Phoebe to drive him to a lake and handcuff him. When they arrive at the lake, Myra, Mercedes and Phoebe all leave the car, although Myra accidentally leaves the handbrake on and the car rolls into the water with Sonny inside. Later, Mercedes and Phoebe visit Theresa in her hiding place, where Theresa reveals that she is pregnant. Later, the charges against Theresa are dropped after the McQueen's make it look as though Sonny manipulated Theresa in to admitting to Calvin's murder, and she goes on to give birth to [[Dodger Savage]]'s baby daughter, [[#Myra-Pocahontas Savage-McQueen|Myra-Pocahontas Savage-McQueen]]. Theresa eventually realises that somebody is framing her to look like a bad mother, and Carmel becomes prime suspect. It later transpires that Phoebe is framing Theresa, and it is revealed that she is working for Sonny, who is in fact alive and plotting revenge on all the McQueens. Phoebe continues to manipulate the situation for Sonny, which eventually culminates with Theresa and Carmel fighting and Myra throwing Carmel out. Phoebe later manipulates Carmel into leaving with Kati, although when driving through a country lane, Carmel realises she is being followed. When she gets out of her car to see who it is, it transpires to be Sonny, believing that she has brought Kati with her. It emerges that Carmel has in fact brought a doll, and Sonny chases her through the woods. Carmel then goes missing for several days with no explanation.\n\nIn November 2014, Myra's niece [[Porsche McQueen|Porsche]] arrives to announce she is engaged to [[Lockie Campbell]], much to John Paul's disgust. Eventually, Carmel reappears in the village, going to the police and telling them what Sonny did to her. She explains that she can't remember where he took her, and she is delighted to be reunited with Myra, Phoebe, Theresa, Mercedes, Nana, John Paul and Porsche. When planning for Porsche's wedding to Lockie, Carmel sneaks off and calls Sonny, telling him that all the McQueens are going to be on a party train for Porsche and Lockie's wedding reception, implying that they are both planning on abducting Kati. On the day of the wedding, Carmel drives to the location where Sonny is, and explains that she can't go through with stealing Kati for him, and returns to the wedding. Back at the church, John Paul tells Porsche that Lockie has attempted to kiss him, but the pair get married anyway. During the party train, Theresa discovers that Carmel was planning on abducting Kati and tells the rest of the family and they disown her. Unbeknownst to the McQueen family, Sonny is on board the train and when Phoebe notices him, he brutally attacks her and leaves her locked in the toilet. After attacking Phoebe, Sonny grabs Theresa and hangs her outside the train, in an attempt to kill her. Meanwhile, [[Sienna Blake]]'s car is stuck on the railway track after a collision with her father, [[Patrick Blake (Hollyoaks)|Patrick]], and she and [[Maxine Minniver]] are terrified when they notice the McQueen party train come towards them. The two women make it out of the car just in time, as the train hits the car and the train de-rails from the track and turning onto its side.\n\nCarmel is the first person to awaken from unconsciousness, and notices her cousin, [[Celine McQueen|Celine]] trapped underneath a table, and helps her out. She then realizes that Myra has badly injured her leg, while Porsche emerges from the rubble. Mercedes then appears, as does Lockie's brother, [[Cameron Campbell|Cameron]]. Lockie and John Paul, however, are trapped under rubble in a different section of the train, while Dodger has badly injured his head. Carmel then exits the train to try to get help, while Sienna enters the wreckage to retrieve Dodger. Sonny and Theresa are both trapped separately from the rest of the party, and when Theresa regains consciousness, she tries to escape Sonny but he also awakens and keeps her hostage in the wreckage. As Mercedes and Cameron both save Phoebe from the wreckage, the fire brigade arrive and help most of the party out. Lockie and John Paul are then rescued by the fire brigade, which relieves Porsche. Carmel realizes that Sonny has Theresa and dashes back into the wreckage, and after noticing a gas canister leaking, she convinces Sonny that they have a future together in order to manipulate him, which makes him loosen his grip on Theresa who escapes just as the train explodes, sending Theresa and most of the wedding party flying across the railway track. After regaining consciousness, Theresa runs back into the wreckage, where she finds Carmel trapped under heavy debris. Carmel confesses to Theresa that she was going to run away with Kati and Sonny, and Theresa forgives her. They finally make amends over their past feud before Myra, Mercedes and Phoebe all enter the wreckage to say their goodbyes to Carmel, apologising for their harsh words. After telling the family that she forgives them for the horrible things that they said to her, Carmel asks Myra to tell her a story, and she dies with her family around her. John Paul then enters the wreckage and is distraught to find his sister deceased, as he never had chance to apologize for the things that he said to her. At the hospital, John Paul reveals the devastating news of Carmel's death to a distraught Nana, and Mercedes forces Myra to choose between her and Theresa, as Mercedes believes that Theresa ruined the final years of Carmel's life.\n\nThe following week, Myra reveals that she has refused to choose between Mercedes and Theresa, and when Mercedes attacks Myra to choose, both Nana and John Paul ask Mercedes to leave for a few days. When Carmel's body is brought to the McQueen household, Nana notices that the ring on her finger has disappeared, and the entire family immediately blame Mercedes. Mercedes is disgusted and reveals to the McQueens how much she loved Carmel, before leaving the house. On the day of Carmel's funeral, Mercedes spots Freddie and Lindsey kissing in the hospital after Lindsey gives birth to Freddie's brother, Joe's baby son. Mercedes blackmails Freddie into buying her share of The Loft, however, she then visits Grace and offers her her share of The Loft too, in a bid to see who will pay more so she can leave the country for Alicante. Mercedes later gets drunk and arrives at Carmel's funeral, hurling abuse at Myra, Theresa and Phoebe, before Myra reveals that she wished Mercedes had died instead of Carmel. Mercedes then flees the church, devastated. Back at the McQueen household, Mercedes waits for either Freddie or Grace to arrive with the highest amount of money, but an unknown figure enters the house, grabs a knife and stabs Mercedes to death. Mercedes' corpse is then seen being dragged out of the house, and the figure mopping up all of her blood. The figure is later revealed to be Freddie. Meanwhile, at the wake of Carmel's funeral, Porsche reveals that she was the culprit who stole Carmel's ring, and not Mercedes. The entire family then rush home to try and catch Mercedes in time, but when she is not there, they all believe she has left for Alicante. The following day, Phoebe is suspicious of Mercedes' whereabouts and calls the police, with old friend D.S Thorpe questioning Myra. She explains that Phoebe is just being over-dramatic, and when she spills a cup of tea, D.S Thorpe notices blood on the floor, and calls for forensic scientists. He then reveals that he believes that Mercedes has been murdered in the kitchen, much to Myra's despair. Later that day, D.S Thorpe arrests Freddie for killing Mercedes. However, Lindsey's sister [[Kim Butterfield]] provides Freddie with a false alibi, which gets Freddie out of the frame. The police later ask Porsche to perform a reconstruction of Mercedes' last movements, which she reluctantly agrees to in order to find Mercedes' murderer. Grace is suspicious of Freddie and confronts him on The Loft balcony, where he continuously denies killing Mercedes, and after innocently pushing her away, she falls from the balcony and is hospitalised.\n\nWhen Joe is confronting Freddie about the murder of Mercedes, they are unaware that Myra is overhearing everything, until she makes a noise when she leaves. Freddie later tries to convince Myra that he had nothing to do with Mercedes' murder, which Myra refuses to believe. Myra leaves the village once again. Elsewhere, Theresa agrees to be a kidney donor for Sienna's teenage daughter, [[Nico Blake]]. Porsche continuously tries to talk Theresa out of it, as they believe that Sienna caused the train accident that killed Carmel. Theresa explains that Carmel would have wanted her to become a good person, but Porsche reminds Theresa of the risks and if she dies, then who will look after her children. Theresa then tells Nico and Sienna that she cannot be a donor, with Sienna insulting Theresa. Afterwards, Theresa has a change of heart and decides to be Nico's donor, but after the operation, Theresa is given far too much [[morphine]] and has to be examined by [[Dr. Charles S'avage]]. It is later revealed that Sienna gave Theresa the overdose as she does not want Theresa to get too close to her twin brother, Dodger. Celine, meanwhile, has been hired by the local hospital and makes friends with Kim and [[Tegan Lomax]].\n\nIt is then revealed that Mercedes is actually alive, and faked her death as part of a money scam. She returns to the village, however shortly after Phoebe is murdered by serial killer [[Lindsey Butterfield]]. Later, when Porsche and Celine's sister Cleo, mother Reenie and stepfather Pete arrive, Porsche reveals that Pete sexually abused her and Cleo when they were kids and made Celine feel insecure, however the family forgive him. Pete and Cleo secretly embark on a sick affair, and when it is discovered, Celine attempts to kill Pete. Pete then escapes and begins living in a van. Cleo visits him and they continue their affair. Reenie reveals that Nana's ex-boyfriend Derek also abused her when she was younger and as a result of these revelations, Porsche, Reenie and Nana all end up leaving the village with Porsche having split up with Lockie after he embarked on separate affairs with both Mercedes and John Paul. Myra then returns to the village with her new boyfriend, Spanish hunk Diego. Theresa leaves the village a few months later in order to start a new life in Spain.\n\nMercedes reveals that she is pregnant with Joe Roscoe's baby and they begin a relationship however Joe gets back together with his ex-wife Lindsey, realising he still loves her.

Marlena fell pregnant with Kathleen in her early 20s. She married a man named Reggie soon after. They had one daughter, Myra. Reggie and Marlena divorced after several arguments and affairs. It is unknown who are the fathers of Kathleen, Reenie and Louis.\n\nAt age 14, Myra fell for the charms of Martin Brownlow and they began a relationship. They slept together and Myra fell pregnant by Martin, who left her. Ashamed of this, Marlena forced Myra keep her pregnancy a secret. When the baby arrived, Myra and Marlena left the baby, named [[Niall Rafferty|Matthew]], on the doorstep of a church with only a note as an explanation. The baby was subsequently put into care as Myra promised to return for her son one day. After this, Myra began a relationship with a man named [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2011)#Billy Alexander|Billy Alexander]] and became pregnant with her eldest daughter [[Jacqui McQueen|Jacqui]] one year after she had Matthew; Jacqui had always assumed she was the eldest. Myra chose to keep Jacqui instead of going through the pain of giving up another child. Myra had her second daughter with Billy one year later and named her [[Mercedes McQueen|Mercedes]]. Billy left Myra and his daughters soon after Mercedes was born. At aged 19, Myra gave birth to [[Tina Reilly|Tina]] following a one-night stand with a married man named Marvin Bassman who refused to be involved in his daughter's life. She named her daughter after [[Tina Turner]]. Later that year in 1985, Myra met [[Ricky Bowen]] and began a relationship with him. Myra had [[Carmel McQueen|Carmel]] with Ricky. Two years later, while Ricky and Myra were on a break, she gave birth to a son called [[John Paul McQueen|John Paul]] by a projectionist she met at a Chester cinema called Iain Naismith, however he left her so that he could transition into his female alter-ego, [[Sally St. Claire]]. Myra lied to Ricky and told him John Paul was his son. Finally, Myra had [[Michaela McQueen|Michaela]] in 1991 by Ricky again. Ricky left the family in 1992 and later married and had another son named Richard.\n\nKathleen had one daughter who she named [[Theresa McQueen|Theresa]], Theresa's father was believed to be a man named Don, but it was later revealed that Billy Alexander was her father after Kathleen had a one-night stand with him at a nightclub. It is assumed Kathleen lied to Don about Theresa being his daughter.\n\nLouis went on to join the army and has a son who was also called Louis. Louis Sr. was killed in action, this inspired Louis Jr. to follow in his father's footsteps and enroll in the army too.\n\nReenie was repeatedly raped by Marlena's abusive boyfriend [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2015)#Derek Clough|Derek Clough]], which she kept a secret from the rest of her family; he impregnated her at 15 and she later gave birth to her daughter [[Porsche McQueen|Porsche]] in 1991. Reenie was originally supposed to give Porsche up for adoption but decided against it. For years it was believed by everyone that Porsche's father was a boy named Mickey, who grew up in the same estate as the McQueens. Reenie had another two daughters with Porsche's presumed father Mickey. She gave birth to [[Celine McQueen|Celine]] in 1994 and then finally in 1998, she gave birth to [[Cleo McQueen|Cleo]]. When the girls were young, Mickey was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. Reenie's boyfriend, [[Pete Buchanan]], subjected Porsche, Celine and Cleo to varying levels of abuse, most notably [[Child molestation|sexually abusing]] Porsche and Cleo and damaging Celine's confidence. There was an incident one Christmas where Derek got excessively drunk and punched Marlena, ultimately breaking her jaw.\n\nMarguerite was married to a pig farmer and they had at least three children, [[Breda McQueen|Breda]], Victor and Valene. Marguerite's husband was a violent alcoholic who would beat her and their daughter Breda. He died after drunkenly falling down the stairs and hitting his head. Their son Victor continually shamed and disappointed his family by getting involved in crime and drugs. Victor married a woman named Sarah in the late 1980s. Sarah gave birth to Victor's son [[Bart McQueen|Bart]]. Victor was an unfaithful husband which ruined his marriage. Sarah left when Bart was five. Soon after the breakdown of his marriage, Victor remarried a woman named Joan. Joan immediately took on the responsibility of being Bart's mother and stayed loyal to Victor and his son even though Victor took advantage of her good nature and found it difficult to stay faithful. Joan died in 2010.\n\nBreda became a nanny and was devoted to the children she cared for. She was also a strict Catholic woman, married to a man named Vinnie Bletcher. On Christmas Day 1986, while pregnant with her and Vinnie's daughter, [[Goldie McQueen|Goldie]], Breda brought toys to the home of her charge, three-year-old Peter, who was being raised by an abusive father called Wes after his mother, Harriet, abandoned them. Wes was about to hit Peter before Breda bludgeoned him over the head with an angel ornament. After murdering his father, Breda took Peter in and adopted him, renaming him [[Sylver McQueen|Sylver]].

Michaela was later seen at her best friend [[Amy Barnes]]' house with her father [[Mike Barnes (Hollyoaks)|Mike]], who was embarrassing his daughter, but made Michaela happy. She pressured Amy into having sex with her short-term boyfriend, [[Ste Hay]], so that her boyfriend, [[List of minor Hollyoaks characters (2005)#Wayne Tunnicliffe|Wayne Tunnicliffe]], would not dump her. Michaela claimed she had had sex with her previous boyfriend, Paul, and that a girl had to put out in order to attract boys.

Carmel later starts a feud with Theresa and also reunites with Jim, who proposes to her. Later, Carmel exposes Theresa's emails that prove Theresa is pretending to be her boyfriend Dodger's dead ex Texas, ultimately breaking up Dodger and Theresa. This infuriates Theresa, who then gets a drunken Jim to sleep in her bed and makes it look like the pair had sex but Nana soon uncovers the truth. Carmel then gets in contact with Calvin's brother [[Sonny Valentine]], who is now a policeman and reveals to him that Theresa murdered Calvin.

Eventually, Carmel reappears in the village, going to the police and telling them what Sonny did to her. She explains that she can't remember where he took her, and she is delighted to be reunited with Myra, Phoebe, Theresa, Mercedes, Nana, John Paul and Porsche. When planning for Porsche's wedding to Lockie, Carmel sneaks off and calls Sonny, telling him that all the McQueens are going to be on a party train for Porsche and Lockie's wedding reception, implying that they are both planning on abducting Kati. On the day of the wedding, Carmel drives to the location where Sonny is, and explains that she can't go through with stealing Kati for him, and returns to the wedding. Back at the church, John Paul tells Porsche that Lockie has attempted to kiss him, but the pair get married anyway. During the party train, Theresa discovers that Carmel was planning on abducting Kati and tells the rest of the family and they disown her. Unbeknownst to the McQueen family, Sonny is on board the train and when Phoebe notices him, he brutally attacks her and leaves her locked in the toilet. After attacking Phoebe, Sonny grabs Theresa and hangs her outside the train, in an attempt to kill her. Meanwhile, [[Sienna Blake]]'s car is stuck on the railway track after a collision with her father, [[Patrick Blake (Hollyoaks)|Patrick]], and she and [[Maxine Minniver]] are terrified when they notice the McQueen party train come towards them. The two women make it out of the car just in time, as the train hits the car and the train de-rails from the track and turning onto its side.\n\nCarmel is the first person to awaken from unconsciousness, and notices her cousin, [[Celine McQueen|Celine]] trapped underneath a table, and helps her out. She then realizes that Myra has badly injured her leg, while Porsche emerges from the rubble. Mercedes then appears, as does Lockie's brother, [[Cameron Campbell|Cameron]]. Lockie and John Paul, however, are trapped under rubble in a different section of the train, while Dodger has badly injured his head. Carmel then exits the train to try to get help, while Sienna enters the wreckage to retrieve Dodger. Sonny and Theresa are both trapped separately from the rest of the party, and when Theresa regains consciousness, she tries to escape Sonny but he also awakens and keeps her hostage in the wreckage. As Mercedes and Cameron both save Phoebe from the wreckage, the fire brigade arrive and help most of the party out. Lockie and John Paul are then rescued by the fire brigade, which relieves Porsche. Carmel realizes that Sonny has Theresa and dashes back into the wreckage, and after noticing a gas canister leaking, she convinces Sonny that they have a future together in order to manipulate him, which makes him loosen his grip on Theresa who escapes just as the train explodes, sending Theresa and most of the wedding party flying across the railway track. After regaining consciousness, Theresa runs back into the wreckage, where she finds Carmel trapped under heavy debris. Carmel confesses to Theresa that she was going to run away with Kati and Sonny, and Theresa forgives her. They finally make amends over their past feud before Myra, Mercedes and Phoebe all enter the wreckage to say their goodbyes to Carmel, apologising for their harsh words. After telling the family that she forgives them for the horrible things that they said to her, Carmel asks Myra to tell her a story, and she dies with her family around her. John Paul then enters the wreckage and is distraught to find his sister deceased, as he never had chance to apologize for the things that he said to her. At the hospital, John Paul reveals the devastating news of Carmel's death to a distraught Nana, and Mercedes forces Myra to choose between her and Theresa, as Mercedes believes that Theresa ruined the final years of Carmel's life.\n\nThe following week, Myra reveals that she has refused to choose between Mercedes and Theresa, and when Mercedes attacks Myra to choose, both Nana and John Paul ask Mercedes to leave for a few days. When Carmel's body is brought to the McQueen household, Nana notices that the ring on her finger has disappeared, and the entire family immediately blame Mercedes. Mercedes is disgusted and reveals to the McQueens how much she loved Carmel, before leaving the house. On the day of Carmel's funeral, Mercedes spots Freddie and Lindsey kissing in the hospital after Lindsey gives birth to Freddie's brother, Joe's baby son. Mercedes blackmails Freddie into buying her share of The Loft, however, she then visits Grace and offers her her share of The Loft too, in a bid to see who will pay more so she can leave the country for Alicante. Mercedes later gets drunk and arrives at Carmel's funeral, hurling abuse at Myra, Theresa and Phoebe, before Myra reveals that she wished Mercedes had died instead of Carmel. Mercedes then flees the church, devastated. Back at the McQueen household, Mercedes waits for either Freddie or Grace to arrive with the highest amount of money, but an unknown figure enters the house, grabs a knife and stabs Mercedes to death. Mercedes' corpse is then seen being dragged out of the house, and the figure mopping up all of her blood. The figure is later revealed to be Freddie. Meanwhile, at the wake of Carmel's funeral, Porsche reveals that she was the culprit who stole Carmel's ring, and not Mercedes. The entire family then rush home to try and catch Mercedes in time, but when she is not there, they all believe she has left for Alicante. The following day, Phoebe is suspicious of Mercedes' whereabouts and calls the police, with old friend D.S Thorpe questioning Myra. She explains that Phoebe is just being over-dramatic, and when she spills a cup of tea, D.S Thorpe notices blood on the floor, and calls for forensic scientists. He then reveals that he believes that Mercedes has been murdered in the kitchen, much to Myra's despair. Later that day, D.S Thorpe arrests Freddie for killing Mercedes. However, Lindsey's sister [[Kim Butterfield]] provides Freddie with a false alibi, which gets Freddie out of the frame. The police later ask Porsche to perform a reconstruction of Mercedes' last movements, which she reluctantly agrees to in order to find Mercedes' murderer. Grace is suspicious of Freddie and confronts him on The Loft balcony, where he continuously denies killing Mercedes, and after innocently pushing her away, she falls from the balcony and is hospitalised.\n\nWhen Joe is confronting Freddie about the murder of Mercedes, they are unaware that Myra is overhearing everything, until she makes a noise when she leaves. Freddie later tries to convince Myra that he had nothing to do with Mercedes' murder, which Myra refuses to believe. Myra leaves the village once again. Elsewhere, Theresa agrees to be a kidney donor for Sienna's teenage daughter, [[Nico Blake]]. Porsche continuously tries to talk Theresa out of it, as they believe that Sienna caused the train accident that killed Carmel. Theresa explains that Carmel would have wanted her to become a good person, but Porsche reminds Theresa of the risks and if she dies, then who will look after her children. Theresa then tells Nico and Sienna that she cannot be a donor, with Sienna insulting Theresa. Afterwards, Theresa has a change of heart and decides to be Nico's donor, but after the operation, Theresa is given far too much [[morphine]] and has to be examined by [[Dr. Charles S'avage]]. It is later revealed that Sienna gave Theresa the overdose as she does not want Theresa to get too close to her twin brother, Dodger. Celine, meanwhile, has been hired by the local hospital and makes friends with Kim and [[Tegan Lomax]].\n\nIt is then revealed that Mercedes is actually alive, and faked her death as part of a money scam. She returns to the village, however shortly after Phoebe is murdered by serial killer [[Lindsey Butterfield]]. Later, when Porsche and Celine's sister Cleo, mother Reenie and stepfather Pete arrive, Porsche reveals that Pete sexually abused her and Cleo when they were kids and made Celine feel insecure, however the family forgive him. Pete and Cleo secretly embark on a sick affair, and when it is discovered, Celine attempts to kill Pete. Pete then escapes and begins living in a van. Cleo visits him and they continue their affair. Reenie reveals that Nana's ex-boyfriend Derek also abused her when she was younger and as a result of these revelations, Porsche, Reenie and Nana all end up leaving the village with Porsche having split up with Lockie after he embarked on separate affairs with both Mercedes and John Paul. Myra then returns to the village with her new boyfriend, Spanish hunk Diego. Theresa leaves the village a few months later in order to start a new life in Spain.\n\nMercedes reveals that she is pregnant with Joe Roscoe's baby and they begin a relationship however Joe gets back together with his ex-wife Lindsey, realising he still loves her. When Joe discovers that Lindsey is a serial killer, Lindsey escapes and their relationship is over. Bart was murdered by [[Warren Fox]] and, with help from [[Sienna Blake]], his body was hidden in Sally's loft until they could move it into the freshly-dug grave of [[Amy Barnes]].\n\nJohn Paul decides to leave town with Matthew for a teaching position in Singapore. Not that long after the two leave the village, it is revealed that he and Craig have reunited and are raising their son in Singapore.\n\n==Generations==\n{{Tree list}}\n* {{Tree list/final branch}} Queenie McQueen (deceased)\n** [[Nana McQueen|Marlena McQueen]], daughter of Queenie, married Reggie\n*** [[Kathleen McQueen]], daughter of Marlena\n**** {{Tree list/final branch}} [[Theresa McQueen]], daughter of Kathleen and [[Billy Alexander]]\n***** [[Kathleen-Angel McQueen]], daughter of Theresa and [[Calvin Valentine]]\n*****{{Tree list/final branch}} [[Myra-Pocahontas Savage-McQueen]], daughter of Theresa and [[Dodger Savage]]\n*** [[Myra McQueen]], daughter of Marlena and Reggie\n**** [[Niall Rafferty]] (deceased), son of Myra and Martin Brownlow\n**** [[Jacqui McQueen]], daughter of Myra and Billy Alexander, married [[Aleksander Malota]], [[Rhys Ashworth]] (deceased)\n***** {{Tree list/final branch}} [[Phoebe McQueen]] (deceased), adoptive daughter of Jacqui and Rhys\n**** [[Mercedes McQueen]], daughter of Myra and Billy Alexander, married [[Russ Owen]] (deceased), [[Malachy Fisher]] (deceased), [[Doctor Browning|Dr. Paul Browning]] (deceased) and [[Sylver McQueen]]\n***** [[Bobby McQueen|Bobby Costello]], son of Mercedes and [[Riley Costello]] (deceased)\n***** [[Gabriel McQueen]] (deceased), son of Mercedes and [[Joe Roscoe]] (deceased)\n**** [[Tina Reilly]] (deceased), daughter of Myra and Marvin Bassman, married [[Dominic Reilly]]\n*****{{Tree list/final branch}} [[Max McQueen (Hollyoaks)|Max McQueen]], son of Tina and Russ Owen\n**** [[Carmel McQueen]] (deceased), daughter of Myra and [[Ricky Bowen]], married [[Calvin Valentine]] (deceased)\n**** [[John Paul McQueen]], son of Myra and [[Sally St. Claire]], married [[Ste Hay]]\n***** {{Tree list/final branch}} [[Matthew McQueen]], son of John Paul and [[Craig Dean]]; born via a surrogate, [[Chloe (Hollyoaks)|Chloe]]\n**** [[Michaela McQueen]], daughter of Myra and [[Ricky Bowen]]\n**** {{Tree list/final branch}} [[Carmina McQueen]], daughter of Myra and [[Diego Salvador Martinez Hernandez De La Cruz]]\n*** [[Reenie McQueen]], daughter of Marlena and Len Murphy, married [[Pete Buchanan]]\n**** [[Porsche McQueen]], daughter of Reenie and [[Derek Clough]] (deceased), married [[Lockie Campbell]] (deceased)\n**** [[Celine McQueen]] (deceased), daughter of Reenie and Mickey \n**** {{Tree list/final branch}} [[Cleo McQueen]], daughter of Reenie and Mickey\n*** Philomena McQueen, daughter of Marlena, married 1986\n*** Louis McQueen (deceased), son of Marlena\n**** {{Tree list/final branch}} Louis McQueen Jr., son of Louis\n*** Jed McQueen, son of Marlena, married Gwen \n**** {{Tree list/final branch}} Jennifique McQueen, daughter of Jed and Gwen McQueen\n**** Julie-Ann McQueen, daughter of Jed and Gwen McQueen\n*** Elvis McQueen, son of Marlena\n** {{Tree list/final branch}} Marguerite McQueen (deceased), daughter of Queenie\n*** Victor McQueen, son of Marguerite, married Sarah, married Joan (deceased)\n**** {{Tree list/final branch}} [[Bart McQueen]] (deceased), son of Victor and Sarah\n*** [[Breda McQueen]] (deceased), daughter of Marguerite, married Vinnie Bletcher (deceased)\n**** [[Sylver McQueen]], son of Wesley (deceased) and Harriet Leilis, adoptive son of Breda, married to [[Mercedes McQueen]]\n***** [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2020)#Cher|Cher McQueen]], daughter of Sylver\n**** {{Tree list/final branch}}[[Goldie McQueen]], daughter of Breda and Vinnie\n***** [[Prince McQueen]], son of Goldie and [[Shane Sweeney]], married [[Lily Drinkwell]] (deceased)\n***** {{Tree list/final branch}} [[Hunter McQueen]], son of Goldie and Shane Sweeney\n***{{Tree list/final branch}}Valene McQueen, daughter of Marguerite\n***{{Tree list/final branch}}Unnamed McQueen, son of Marguerite\n{{Tree list/end}}\n\n==Reception==\nIntroduced by [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]], the McQueen family has proved popular with fans, being nominated individually for various awards.

Peter, a merchant adventurer, who had migrated from [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] to London about 1670, was also a director of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]]. The family name is taken from the town of [[Sittard]] in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], the [[Netherlands]]. They settled at [[Shottesbrooke]] in Berkshire.\n\nEducated at [[Reading School]] and at [[Winchester College]], Henry Vansittart joined the society of the Franciscans, or the ''[[Hellfire Club]]'', at [[Medmenham]].  His elder brothers, [[Arthur Vansittart|Arthur]] and [[Robert Vansittart (jurist)|Robert]], were also members of this fraternity.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1745, at the age of thirteen, he entered service of the East India Company as a writer and sailed for [[Fort St David]] in [[Madras]].<ref name=\"mason\">{{cite book|last=Mason|first=Philip|title=The Men Who Ruled India|year=1985|chapter=4|isbn=81-7167-361-9}}</ref> Here he showed himself very industrious, made the acquaintance of [[Robert Clive]] and rose rapidly from one position to another, although he spent three years back in England from 1751.\n\nHe returned to India in 1754 and became a member of the Council of Madras in 1757. He helped to defend the city against the French in 1759,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} and was appointed to replace Clive, on Clive's recommendation, as President of the Council and Governor of [[Fort William, India|Fort William]] in [[Bengal]] in November 1760.<ref name=mason />\n\nHe arrived in Bengal in July 1760, finding himself in a difficult political position, including a serious lack of funds.  He deposed the [[Nawab of Bengal]], [[Mir Jafar]], and replaced the Nawab with the Nawab's son-in-law, [[Mir Kasim]], which increased the influence of England in the province. Vansittart was, however, less successful in another direction. Practically all the company's servants were traders in their private capacity, and as they claimed various privileges and exemptions this system was detrimental to the interests of the native princes and gave rise to an enormous amount of corruption. Vansittart sought to check this, and in 1762 he made a treaty with Mir Kasim, but the majority of Vansittart's council were against him and in the following year this was repudiated. Reprisals on the part of the subadar were followed by war and, annoyed at the failure of his pacific schemes, Vansittart resigned on 28 November 1764 and returned to England.<ref name=mason />\n\nTo defend his conduct in Bengal, Vansittart published three volumes of papers as ''A Narrative of the Transactions in Bengal from 1760 to 1764'' (London, 1766).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} His conduct was attacked before the board of directors in London, but events seemed to prove that he was in the right, and in 1769 he became a director of the company. In 1768 he had been elected to a seat in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] for [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]].<ref name=mason />\n\nClive had returned to India and exposed the rampant corruption. Vansittart, [[Luke Scrafton]], and another official, [[Francis Forde (army officer)|Francis Forde]], were sent to India to examine the administrative problems and reform the whole government in India. The mission left England in September 1769, visited [[Cape Town]] where they were last reported, embarking, on 27 December 1769, but the ship in which they sailed, the frigate ''Aurora'', was lost at sea, apparently foundered with all hands.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}<ref name=mason /><ref name=\"Burke1866\">{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Bernard|title=A Genealogical History of the Dormant, Abeyant, Forfeited, and Extinct Peerages of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DEGAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA546|accessdate=3 October 2018|year=1866|publisher=Harrison|page=546}}</ref> The captain had decided to navigate the [[Mozambique Channel]], despite bad weather.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=63538|first=D.

Peter, a merchant adventurer, who had migrated from [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] to London about 1670, was also a director of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]]. The family name is taken from the town of [[Sittard]] in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], the [[Netherlands]]. They settled at [[Shottesbrooke]] in Berkshire.\n\nEducated at [[Reading School]] and at [[Winchester College]], Henry Vansittart joined the society of the Franciscans, or the ''[[Hellfire Club]]'', at [[Medmenham]].  His elder brothers, [[Arthur Vansittart|Arthur]] and [[Robert Vansittart (jurist)|Robert]], were also members of this fraternity.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1745, at the age of thirteen, he entered service of the East India Company as a writer and sailed for [[Fort St David]] in [[Madras]].<ref name=\"mason\">{{cite book|last=Mason|first=Philip|title=The Men Who Ruled India|year=1985|chapter=4|isbn=81-7167-361-9}}</ref> Here he showed himself very industrious, made the acquaintance of [[Robert Clive]] and rose rapidly from one position to another, although he spent three years back in England from 1751.\n\nHe returned to India in 1754 and became a member of the Council of Madras in 1757. He helped to defend the city against the French in 1759,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} and was appointed to replace Clive, on Clive's recommendation, as President of the Council and Governor of [[Fort William, India|Fort William]] in [[Bengal]] in November 1760.<ref name=mason />\n\nHe arrived in Bengal in July 1760, finding himself in a difficult political position, including a serious lack of funds.  He deposed the [[Nawab of Bengal]], [[Mir Jafar]], and replaced the Nawab with the Nawab's son-in-law, [[Mir Kasim]], which increased the influence of England in the province. Vansittart was, however, less successful in another direction. Practically all the company's servants were traders in their private capacity, and as they claimed various privileges and exemptions this system was detrimental to the interests of the native princes and gave rise to an enormous amount of corruption. Vansittart sought to check this, and in 1762 he made a treaty with Mir Kasim, but the majority of Vansittart's council were against him and in the following year this was repudiated. Reprisals on the part of the subadar were followed by war and, annoyed at the failure of his Pacific schemes, Vansittart resigned on 28 November 1764 and returned to England.<ref name=mason />\n\nTo defend his conduct in Bengal, Vansittart published three volumes of papers as ''A Narrative of the Transactions in Bengal from 1760 to 1764'' (London, 1766).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} His conduct was attacked before the board of directors in London, but events seemed to prove that he was in the right, and in 1769 he became a director of the company. In 1768 he had been elected to a seat in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] for [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]].<ref name=mason />\n\nClive had returned to India and exposed the rampant corruption. Vansittart, [[Luke Scrafton]], and another official, [[Francis Forde (army officer)|Francis Forde]], were sent to India to examine the administrative problems and reform the whole government in India. The mission left England in September 1769, visited [[Cape Town]] where they were last reported, embarking, on 27 December 1769, but the ship in which they sailed, the frigate ''Aurora'', was lost at sea, apparently foundered with all hands.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}<ref name=mason /><ref name=\"Burke1866\">{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Bernard|title=A Genealogical History of the Dormant, Abeyant, Forfeited, and Extinct Peerages of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DEGAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA546|accessdate=3 October 2018|year=1866|publisher=Harrison|page=546}}</ref> The captain had decided to navigate the [[Mozambique Channel]], despite bad weather.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=63538|first=D.

In February 2007, Amy gives birth to a baby girl on the kitchen floor, with her father [[Mike Barnes (Hollyoaks)|Mike]] and her sister [[Sarah Barnes]] helping deliver her. Amy names the baby Leah Michaela Barnes. Amy cannot handle motherhood and refuses to even go near Leah, leading her mother [[Kathy Barnes]] to claim she is Leah's mother. This ruse continues for several months, until Michaela sells the story to a tabloid. By this time, Amy has formed a bond with Leah, and claims her as her own. However, Kathy has become obsessed with Leah and, after failing to make Amy look incapable of being Leah's mother, she kidnaps her granddaughter. After being caught, Kathy sectioned and leaves Hollyoaks a few months later.\n\nAmy brings Leah to move in with her boyfriend, [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]). Amy tells her family that Ste is Leah's father. After the couple discover they are in serious money trouble, Ste lies that Leah has [[leukaemia]] in order to get money. The lie quickly spirals out of his control as Ste and Amy begin raking in money as, the truth eventually, does come out. Amy's friend [[Sasha Valentine]] babysits Leah one night. However, [[Nige Foster]] arrives and persuades Sasha to take drugs, despite Leah's presence. Amy and Ste return home to find Leah crying on her own, and close to a syringe. An angry Ste throws both Sasha and Nige out after threatening them. Ste's anger issues grow out of hand, and on various occasions, he attacks Amy, who briefly moves out of the flat with Leah. Amy later discovers she is pregnant and has a son [[Lucas Hay]] (Reuben Thwaites) in April 2009. Amy, however, does not take Ste back. Following Lucas's birth, Amy suffers from [[postpartum depression|postnatal depression]] and moves away, leaving Leah and Lucas with Ste. Amy returns months later. She, Leah and Lucas move back in with Ste, but Amy and Ste do not get back together.\n\nIn November 2010, [[Gabby Sharpe]] pays Amy to babysit her daughter [[Amber Sharpe]]. Amy takes Leah and Lucas to Gabby's flat and on the same night, an arsonist sets fire to Il Gnosh, which is below the flat. Amy falls asleep as the fire spreads, however wakes up and realises she is trapped. She eventually attracts the attention of [[Steph Cunningham]] outside. Steph enters and manages to save them with the help of her husband [[Gilly Roach]], although Steph dies in the fire. In February 2012, Leah bonds with Amy's new boyfriend [[Ally Grogan]] ([[Dan O'Connor (actor)|Daniel O'Connor]]). In August 2012, Amy leaves the village with Leah and Lucas. Leah returns in November 2012 as a bridesmaid for Ste's wedding to [[Doug Carter]]. When Leah is playing outside the wedding venue she runs across the road only to nearly be run over by a minibus driven by [[Maddie Morrison]]. She swerves to avoid Leah, but although Ste manages to save her he is hit by the minibus. In December 2012, Leah is bullied at school for having Doug and Ste as her father and stepfather, but Ste explains to her that it's ok to have him and Doug, as she has Amy as well. Shortly after this, Leah's biological father Billy Parker turns up in the village and vows to Ste that he will get Leah. Ste then tells Leah that Amy must never find out that he and [[Brendan Brady]] ([[Emmett Scanlan]]) are together, and that he is still with Doug. Shortly after, Amy returns to the village in February 2013 after discovering Ste's relationship with Brendan, she then leaves once more with Leah and Lucas, leaving Ste upset.

Leah sees Ste in secret and he gives her a tablet, which Amy and Ryan find out but Leah doesn't tell them that Ste bought it for her. When Leah runs away, Amy finds her but causes Leah to fall on the steps in front of Ste and is rushed to hospital after receiving a broken leg. She is discharged a day later and starts trying to split up Amy and Ryan. When Ryan finds out that Leah has sent Amy a note about his secret, he confronts Leah and angrily tells her about Amy's abuse by Ste in front of Amy. Leah tells Ste about it but Amy lies that Ryan is lying.\n\nIn January 2017, after Amy puts cake in Leah's face and [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2016)#Prince McQueen|Prince]] and [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2016)#Hunter McQueen|Hunter McQueen]] have videoed it, Harry calls social services, devastating Amy, who tells them that she has not hurt Leah. Ryan accuses Ste for calling social services and punches him, which Amy finds out. In March 2017, Amy and Ryan get married but the day after the wedding, Amy dies after being pushed by a mystery person. Mike tells Leah and Lucas about it and they are devastated. Ste is arrested and sent to prison for Amy's murder, which he didn't commit. Leah and Lucas are raised by Ryan, who struggles to cope, resulting in him leaving Lucas at school. Leah is hurt when [[Mercedes McQueen]] says that Ryan had been cheating on Amy. In October 2017, Ryan is revealed to be Amy's killer, which Leah and Lucas are unaware of, and Ste is released from prison.\n\nIn December 2017, Ryan and Ste's half-sister [[Tegan Lomax]] tell Leah and Lucas that they are in a relationship and Leah angrily storms off because she doesn't want Amy to be replaced. Tegan, however, reassures her that she will not replace her mother. In February 2018, Leah wanders off with [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2008)#Ella Richardson|Ella Richardson]] (Erin Palmer) to the abandoned Hollyoaks High School, with [[Kim Butterfield]] ([[Daisy Wood-Davis]]) locked inside in a room by Ryan, but they run off when Kim bangs on the door. The following day, Leah goes back in the abandoned school with [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2006)#Charlie Dean|Charlie Dean]] (Charlie Behan) and she finds a SIM card, which she steals. Ella tells Ste that Charlie and Leah have gone to the school. Ste finds them, but leaves Kim in the abandoned school, unaware that she is in one of the school rooms. Leah gets into the SIM card and finds text messages about Ryan and Ste's relationship and finds out that Ryan and Ste are having an affair. The following day, she tells Ste that she knows he loves Ryan. In March 2018, Leah skips school and fakes being ill so that she can see Ryan. When Ste takes Leah to hospital thinking she is ill, he finds out that Leah has been faking. As he is about to take her home, Ryan returns. Leah prints out Ryan and Ste's love text messages and puts them in a box when Amy's memorial begins. During Amy's memorial, Leela finds the printed text messages and angrily confronts Ste. Leah becomes upset and tells Ste that she has printed out his and Ryan's text messages. In April 2018, when Ste, Harry, Leah and Lucas go camping, Leah and Lucas are found by Ryan, who has escaped from prison, and he scares them. He is confronted by Ste and Harry. Ryan and Harry fight but Ryan falls off the cliff and lands in the lake stream, where he drowns.\n\n== Spike ==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Hollyoaks\n|name=Spike\n|portrayer= [[Tom Vaughan (actor)|Tom Vaughan]]\n|years=2007\u20132008\n|first= 23 March 2007\n|last= 28 November 2008\n|classification=[[List of past Hollyoaks characters#Last appeared in 2008|Former; recurring]]\n}}\n\n'''Spike''' was a character portrayed by actor [[Tom Vaughan (actor)|Tom Vaughan]] from March 2007 to August 2007, with a brief return at the end of November 2008.<ref>{{ cite news | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a132640/spike-to-make-brief-hollyoaks-return.html | title=Spike to make brief 'Hollyoaks' return | author=Kris Green | work=[[Digital Spy]] | date=2008-10-14 | accessdate=2008-10-14 }}</ref>\n\nSpike was first seen DJing at the reception for [[Jacqui Malota]] and [[Aleksander Malota]]. He soon befriended Jacqui's gay brother, [[John Paul McQueen]]. John Paul was still not confident in his sexuality, but Spike was not only openly gay, he said his father was also gay and lived with a man named Simon.\n\nOnce John Paul got up the courage to ask Spike out on a date, they became very close very quickly. Spike was good-natured, but also wasn't afraid to stand his ground, especially when John Paul's ex [[Hannah Ashworth]] interfered with a date. On another occasion, Hannah told Spike about John Paul's feelings for his straight best friend, [[Craig Dean]]. Spike became jealous and when John Paul tried to tell him how much he cared, Spike told him he was being too serious and that he didn't \"do\" serious. Spike was in the middle of a DJing gig at the Dog and tried to tune John Paul out. When John Paul turned the volume on his amp down, Spike warned him to never do that again and passionately kissed him in front of everyone. This seemed to strengthen his relationship with John Paul, and he even managed to charm John Paul's sister Mercedes and mother Myra when he finally went to their house for a visit.\n\nJohn Paul had never slept with a man before and was nervous about taking the next step. One day while the McQueen house was empty, Spike took John Paul to his bedroom and they slept together for the first time. This was the high point of their relationship, as the happier they became, the more upset this made Craig. Craig slept with John Paul and although John Paul tried to continue seeing Spike, he eventually dumped him, not telling Spike the real reason why.\n\nSpike and John Paul remained friends, and when John Paul needed Spike to help him retrieve a poison pen letter he'd written to Craig's mother while Craig was on holiday with his girlfriend (again not telling Spike the truth), Spike did. They sparred with Hannah and her new friend Melissa, and Melissa responded by throwing John Paul's records in the water. Spike and John Paul fished them out and went back to John Paul's place, where they kissed and would have gone further if John Paul hadn't stopped. Spike advised him to sort out what was going on in his head and have some fun.\n\nA few weeks later Spike began bartending at The Dog and quickly realized John Paul and Craig were involved. Spike began teasing Craig, and their increasingly hostile exchanges roused Sarah's suspicions. Craig played on John Paul's sense of chivalry and John Paul convinced Spike to keep quiet.\n\nSpike made a brief return in November 2008. His tensions with Hannah had not gone away. Working as a reporter for the ''Chester Herald'', Spike wanted to do a story on the Dog, or as [[Neville Ashworth]] had renamed it, The Jolly Roger. The nautically-themed opening night, complete with young men wearing sailor suits, led Spike to write an article which sold the pub as a gay bar. When Neville realised what was going on, he was shocked, even more so when Spike jokingly pretended that he believed Neville was gay. Neville barred him from the pub, but he'd already booked Spike as a DJ. Finally, Neville had enough, fired Spike, and decided to change the pub back to The Dog in the Pond.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Tristan Burgess ==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Hollyoaks\n|portrayer= William Rushton\n|name= Tristan Burgess\n|mother= [[Yasmin Burgess]]\n|first= 11 April 2007\n|last= 19 September 2007\n|classification= [[List of past Hollyoaks characters#Last appeared in 2007|Former; recurring]]\n}}\n\n'''Tristan Christopher Anthony Burgess''' was a rival of [[Tom Cunningham]]'s from school.

The affair was discovered by her brother [[John Paul McQueen]] and their mother [[Myra McQueen]].

In late 2015, Langton took an extended break from the soap and Nana made a low-key exit from the village on 20 November 2015. It was later announced in October 2016 that Langton had returned to filming and Nana returned on 24 October 2016. Nana is part of the [[McQueen family]]. She made a few brief appearances in February 2017, October and return full-time on 17 September 2018, moving into the spare room at the Dog in the Pond after Mercedes became the new landlady.\n\nNana is first seen in July 2007 when flirting with [[Russ Owen]] ([[Stuart Manning]]) in [[The Dog in the Pond]]. She enters the McQueen household to find her granddaughters fighting. When the rest of the McQueens get back, she sees Russ and claims he was chatting her up at The Dog. Nana reappears in October 2007 when her grandchildren [[Carmel McQueen]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) and [[John Paul McQueen]] ([[James Sutton (actor)|James Sutton]]) nearly die from [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]. She stirs up trouble by lying to her granddaughter [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) that she has seen Carmel and Russ kissing at the hospital. Nana's daughter, [[Myra McQueen]] ([[Nicole Barber-Lane]]), tries to get along with her, but after she realises Nana has tried to steal the compensation money the family have received for Carmel and John Paul, Myra throws Nana out. Nana reminds Myra that she is her mother, but Myra exclaims that she stopped being her mother at the age of 14. Nana vows to return before leaving. Nana returns for the family's Christmas and Boxing Day celebrations. Neither she nor the rest of the family realise their guest, [[Niall Rafferty]] ([[Barry Sloane]]), is the son Nana forced Myra to give up at birth. During the dinner, Nana toasts her granddaughter [[Tina Reilly|Tina McQueen]] ([[Leah Hackett]]) for being a surrogate mother for her half-sister [[Jacqui McQueen]] ([[Claire Cooper]]) and her boyfriend [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]). Myra gets upset and leaves the table. Nana finds her in the bathroom, weeping over old newspaper clippings of the child she had given up at birth. Myra tells Nana she could never forgive her, or herself. Nana tells her to stop complaining and that she was right to give up the child. Myra slaps Nana for her comment, but Nana slaps Myra right back, leaving as she refused to be treated in such a manner.\n\nIn February 2008, Nana returns after Myra is arrested for benefit fraud. After having an argument with Myra she went to The Dog with Niall where she got drunk and confessed to Niall that she forced Myra to give up her son aged 14. In revenge Niall attacked her and left her for dead. She was later found by her granddaughter Tina, and returned home the next day. Nana and the rest of the McQueens were at that point unaware that it was Niall that attacked her. In September 2008, it was revealed that she was on a cruise so she couldn't attend Carmel and [[Calvin Valentine]]'s ([[Ricky Whittle]]) wedding. She returned in November 2008 for Tina's funeral. She was unimpressed with Jacqui and John Paul because they failed to attend the service. Nana mentioned that her daughter, [[Kathleen McQueen]] (Alison Burrows), is in prison. She also mentions that Kathleen's daughter, [[Theresa McQueen]] ([[Jorgie Porter]]), is living with her as a consequence. After arguing with Myra over Niall, Mercedes, threw her out. She returned later the same month when it emerged that Theresa had slept with Tony, who was unaware she was only 15. Nana revealed she used to pose for a Dutch artist whose house she used to clean. In 2009 it turned out that these pictures were worth quite a lot of money; unfortunately for the McQueens, [[Leila Roy]] ([[Lena Kaur]]) had painted over the canvas. In June 2010 Theresa was sent to stay with Nana but returned after a few weeks, saying she had a miserable time.\n\nIn the summer of 2012, Carmel left Hollyoaks for a few months to live with Nana after having an accident with a self-tanning machine leaving her with a very distinct scar.

She arranges for her to go on a date with [[Barney Harper-McBride]] (Tom Scurr).\n\nNana has three daughters to three different fathers. She was once married to a man named Reggie but the marriage ended after Nana struggled to stay faithful. Although Nana cared for Reggie she said her true love was a man named Billy Bickerstaff who worked in a local chip shop. She has also mentioned having romances with men such as Willy Trotter, Ernie Partridge and Len Murphy. She was in an abusive relationship with a man named [[Derek Clough]] ([[Bruce Montague]]), Derek abused Marlena physically for years, he broke her jaw and put her in hospital more than once. He also raped her youngest daughter [[Reenie McQueen|Reenie]] ([[Z\u00f6e Lucker]]), getting her pregnant aged 15 with daughter [[Porsche McQueen|Porsche]] ([[Twinnie-Lee Moore|Twinnie Lee Moore]]). After Derek dies of heart attack, Reenie tells Nana that Porsche can never learn the truth about her father's identity; Nana agrees to keep the secret.\n\nIn November 2015, after Pete's sexual abuse of Porsche and her younger sister [[Cleo McQueen]] ([[Nadine Rose Mulkerrin]]) is revealed, Nana cannot cope as she feels she could have done something to prevent the line of abuse that followed in the village, back at the McQueen house, after crying her eyes out, she picked a picture Kathleen-Angel had drawn from the wall having a drawing of Nana on and reading \"My perfect Nana who looks after my family\" Nana later put the picture against her and started crying, she later disappeared and Myra and the other McQueens finding a letter from her saying she had gone to Alicante, leaving Myra horrified.\n\nNana returns in October 2016, leaving Myra shocked to find her on the doorstep, she sets out to clean the house and discovers everything that has gone on in her absence and helps Myra find a new man, due to [[Diego Salvador Martinez Hernandez De La Cruz]] (Juan Pablo Yepez) being in prison.

Reluctantly, Jessica went along with him, only to see him arrested for fraud just as the deal was being made. Jessica visited him in prison and told him he'd ruined all her happy memories, as she now had to assume their money had always come from illegal activities.

Through Sarah, Melissa met and grew close to [[Hannah Ashworth]] after discovering she is [[Bulimia|bulimic]], an illness which Melissa also suffered from. Melissa helped Hannah to be subtle and hide her eating disorder, encouraging her to exercise regularly, go without food and to stay away from her family and friends so that she is not 'tempted' by food or alcohol - even persuading Hannah to stay at home when her family went to France.\n\nThis period of the Ashworths being in France, leaving their house to Hannah and Gilly for the duration saw Melissa become a central character in the show's plot. Melissa spent almost the whole of this time living at the Ashworths claiming she didn't want to go home, as her Mum would have forced her to eat. Hannah promised that she and Melissa would get through bulimia together and the girls soon started an extreme work out regime drinking only water and eating very little. Melissa had difficulties with [[Gilly Roach]] who thought she and Hannah were taking drugs because of the change in Hannah's personality, a fear also shared by her friends Sarah, [[Nancy Hayton]] and [[John Paul McQueen]] whose suspicions were reinforced when Sarah overheard Hannah and Melissa in the SU bar's toilets about \"disposing of the evidence\" and later the same evening, Hannah passing out.\n\nUpon the return of the Ashworths from France, Hannah's mother [[Suzanne Ashworth]] was concerned as to how skinny Hannah had become. Melissa sarcastically stated that she had given Hannah drugs, resulting in Melissa being banned from the house. Melissa though continued to visit Hannah, angering Gilly. Hannah and Melissa threatened to say he had raped Hannah if he spoke out against Melissa. In spite of these threats, Gilly alerted [[Rhys Ashworth]] to his concerns about Melissa and she was forcibly ejected from the Ashworth's barbecue. Melissa had complained about a headache during the barbecue and continued to feel unwell as, after being ejected, she and Hannah stood in the rain waiting for a taxi. Melissa collapsed and was admitted to intensive care.\n\nHannah visited Melissa in hospital and told her she was all she had in the world and she was happy they met. Melissa tells her she's a true friend. Hannah applies make-up to Melissa, who was so weak she couldn't open her lip gloss. There was a montage showing the wires, drips, Melissa's bones sticking out and Hannah's family looking for answers back at her home. Hannah cries throughout this entire segment. The song \"My Skin\" by [[Natalie Merchant]] played throughout.\n\nMelissa eventually engineered a plot to escape to Milan with Hannah, through fear that if she stayed in hospital and continued to be force-fed she would have got fat. Hannah agreed to the plan because she was fed up with her family interfering in her life. The two friends successfully escaped the hospital the next day, but had to return to Hannah's home to retrieve her passport; where Rhys and Suzanne grab her to prevent her from going. Melissa argued with Hannah's family before the stress of the situation caused her to collapse from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and despite Suzanne's attempts to revive her, Melissa died shortly after. Hannah then cradled Melissa's body, crying hysterically.\n\nMelissa's death was one of the few episodes to not feature a wrap-up scene following the end credits.\n\nIn the episode following her death, a vision of Melissa reappeared to Hannah, as Hannah struggles to cope with her grief and is terrified that her mother will use Melissa's death to force her to eat. Hannah is seen trying on Melissa's dress (during the scene we see a flashback of Melissa proudly modelling the [[size zero]] dress for Hannah) Hannah however struggles to fit into the outfit, and a vision of Melissa appears and zips it up for Hannah, before vanishing.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Valerie Holden ==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Hollyoaks\n| name= Valerie Holden\n| portrayer=[[Jacqueline Leonard]] (2007)<br />[[Samantha Giles]] (2008\u20132010)\n| years= 2007\u20132010\n| first= 6 September 2007\n| last = 13 August 2010\n| born = 29 May\n| sons=[[Danny Valentine]]\n| daughters= [[Lauren Valentine]]\n| mother=Sybil\n| classification=[[List of past Hollyoaks characters#Last appeared in 2010|Former; recurring]]\n| home = [[London]]\n}}\n\n'''Valerie \"Val\" Holden''' arrived in the village with her two children [[Danny Valentine|Danny]] and [[Lauren Valentine|Lauren]], who are the illegitimate children of [[Leo Valentine]].

On his 18th birthday he discovers that his mother, Tessie, and his godparents Ruth, Kurt, Jambo and Rory cannot attend to his 18th birthday, as he discover that Jambo refused to return to Hollyoaks since the death of Dawn Cunningham in eighteen years. Later that day Ste tells Harry that due to his HIV he now has to go on medication, but Harry accepts it. Ste later breaks up with him that night anyway after being manipulated by Tony who refuses to believe Harry's gay. Harry later sees Cleo holding hands with her step-father Pete and she accidentally lets it slip she was having a relationship with him for years.

After originally going to leave for France, Tony decides to stay behind in Hollyoaks to help Harry get Ste over the addiction. After the first night, Tony decided to hand Ste over to doctors who will be able to give him real help. During Ste's trial for [[Amy Barnes]]' ([[Ashley Slanina-Davies]]) murder, Ste tells him that he knows Harry was the one who really killed her. Harry explains to Ste that he didn't mean to kill Amy and that he thought she was still alive when he left her house, following an argument in which she fell and hurt her head. He assumed her husband [[Ryan Knight (Hollyoaks)|Ryan Knight]] ([[Duncan James]]) would come home and call an ambulance if necessary but, when he discovered she had died, he was too frightened to say anything. Harry attempts to confess but Ste and James stop him and James plans to set someone else up for the murder. James successfully casts doubt over Ste's guilt by suggesting that DI Armstrong killed Amy, resulting in Ste being released however, Ste subsequently breaks up with him because of what he did to Amy. Via flashback, the audience finds out that Harry was not responsible for Amy's murder as, once he left her house, Ryan entered and killed her.\n\nWhen Harry confesses to Tony that he is responsible for Amy's murder, Tony kicks him out of the house and he becomes homeless.

Harry chases after him and after a brief struggle, Ryan accidentally falls into a river screaming for Harry to help him, but Harry walks away leaving Ryan to his death, which Harry later feels guilty for. Ste and Harry later become engaged and plan a Wedding.\n\nSte and Harry later married, however this was cut short when Ste discovered Harry's affair with James and Harry couldn't support Ste at the hospital where his sister was in a critical condition.

He later asked her to give a year 11 student drugs. The student was not there and Michaela threw the drugs at Amy when she saw teacher [[Russ Owen]] ([[Stuart Manning]]) heading their way. Amy got out of trouble, but Nige wanted his money. When Amy protested, Nige threatened her.\n\nNige returned some months later when [[Sasha Valentine]] ([[Nathalie Emmanuel]]) needed heroin. She reluctantly slept with him in order to get the drugs. Fletch, who by that time was also a heroin addict, was repulsed by what she had done, but finally agreed to Nige's demand that he sell drugs to schoolchildren in return for some heroin of his own. She slept with him again while babysitting Leah, who got dangerously close to a syringe.\n\nLater, Nige needed money to pay his suppliers, and he resorted to stealing [[Justin Burton]]'s ([[Chris Fountain]]) laptop and having Sasha assist him in breaking into recently widowed [[Steph Cunningham]]'s ([[Carley Stenson]]) flat.

Nige spotting Calvin, pulled a knife and as Calvin tried to defuse the situation, Nige teased him about sleeping with Sasha, Calvin lost it and attacked Nige. During the scuffle Nige stabbed Calvin and Calvin hit Nige with a blunt object to the head. As Calvin was rushed to hospital, Warren met him the next day and revealed Calvin had killed Nige.

He told Tom's brother [[Max Cunningham]], who panicked as Simon had taken Tom to the park and they weren't answering Max's calls. They broke into Simon's home and found a locked room which was a boy's bedroom. When Max caught up to Tom and Simon at the park, he began beating Simon until he was pulled away. Soon rumours spread around town and when Simon went into the Dog the next day, Gilly and [[Jake Dean]] taunted and jeered him. They followed him down the street, gathering a lynch mob who followed him to his home and smashed bottles and bricks against the doors and windows.\n\nMeanwhile, Simon's ex-wife Gemma, whom he'd mentioned but no one had ever seen, finally showed up, and was horrified by Max's accusations. She told them the swimming photos were for certificates for each of the kids Simon taught, and the bedroom was a reminder of their son Connor, who had drowned, which was the reason Simon had become a lifeguard in the first place. When the police showed up, the mob ran away. Afterwards, Gemma, Max and O.B. raced to Simon's home, but by the time they got inside, they found him unconscious on the kitchen floor from vodka and pills, holding a photo of his son.

He soon befriended Jacqui's gay brother, [[John Paul McQueen]]. John Paul was still not confident in his sexuality, but Spike was not only openly gay, he said his father was also gay and lived with a man named Simon.\n\nOnce John Paul got up the courage to ask Spike out on a date, they became very close very quickly. Spike was good-natured, but also wasn't afraid to stand his ground, especially when John Paul's ex [[Hannah Ashworth]] interfered with a date. On another occasion, Hannah told Spike about John Paul's feelings for his straight best friend, [[Craig Dean]]. Spike became jealous and when John Paul tried to tell him how much he cared, Spike told him he was being too serious and that he didn't \"do\" serious. Spike was in the middle of a DJing gig at the Dog and tried to tune John Paul out. When John Paul turned the volume on his amp down, Spike warned him to never do that again and passionately kissed him in front of everyone. This seemed to strengthen his relationship with John Paul, and he even managed to charm John Paul's sister Mercedes and mother Myra when he finally went to their house for a visit.\n\nJohn Paul had never slept with a man before and was nervous about taking the next step. One day while the McQueen house was empty, Spike took John Paul to his bedroom and they slept together for the first time. This was the high point of their relationship, as the happier they became, the more upset this made Craig. Craig slept with John Paul and although John Paul tried to continue seeing Spike, he eventually dumped him, not telling Spike the real reason why.\n\nSpike and John Paul remained friends, and when John Paul needed Spike to help him retrieve a poison pen letter he'd written to Craig's mother while Craig was on holiday with his girlfriend (again not telling Spike the truth), Spike did. They sparred with Hannah and her new friend Melissa, and Melissa responded by throwing John Paul's records in the water. Spike and John Paul fished them out and went back to John Paul's place, where they kissed and would have gone further if John Paul hadn't stopped. Spike advised him to sort out what was going on in his head and have some fun.\n\nA few weeks later Spike began bartending at The Dog and quickly realized John Paul and Craig were involved. Spike began teasing Craig, and their increasingly hostile exchanges roused Sarah's suspicions. Craig played on John Paul's sense of chivalry and John Paul convinced Spike to keep quiet.\n\nSpike made a brief return in November 2008. His tensions with Hannah had not gone away. Working as a reporter for the ''Chester Herald'', Spike wanted to do a story on the Dog, or as [[Neville Ashworth]] had renamed it, The Jolly Roger. The nautically-themed opening night, complete with young men wearing sailor suits, led Spike to write an article which sold the pub as a gay bar. When Neville realised what was going on, he was shocked, even more so when Spike jokingly pretended that he believed Neville was gay. Neville barred him from the pub, but he'd already booked Spike as a DJ. Finally, Neville had enough, fired Spike, and decided to change the pub back to The Dog in the Pond.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Tristan Burgess ==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Hollyoaks\n|portrayer= William Rushton\n|name= Tristan Burgess\n|mother= [[Yasmin Burgess]]\n|first= 11 April 2007\n|last= 19 September 2007\n|classification= [[List of past Hollyoaks characters#Last appeared in 2007|Former; recurring]]\n}}\n\n'''Tristan Christopher Anthony Burgess''' was a rival of [[Tom Cunningham]]'s from school.

It was later announced in October 2016 that Langton had returned to filming and Nana returned on 24 October 2016. Nana is part of the [[McQueen family]]. She made a few brief appearances in February 2017, October and return full-time on 17 September 2018, moving into the spare room at the Dog in the Pond after Mercedes became the new landlady.\n\nNana is first seen in July 2007 when flirting with [[Russ Owen]] ([[Stuart Manning]]) in [[The Dog in the Pond]]. She enters the McQueen household to find her granddaughters fighting. When the rest of the McQueens get back, she sees Russ and claims he was chatting her up at The Dog. Nana reappears in October 2007 when her grandchildren [[Carmel McQueen]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) and [[John Paul McQueen]] ([[James Sutton (actor)|James Sutton]]) nearly die from [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]. She stirs up trouble by lying to her granddaughter [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) that she has seen Carmel and Russ kissing at the hospital. Nana's daughter, [[Myra McQueen]] ([[Nicole Barber-Lane]]), tries to get along with her, but after she realises Nana has tried to steal the compensation money the family have received for Carmel and John Paul, Myra throws Nana out. Nana reminds Myra that she is her mother, but Myra exclaims that she stopped being her mother at the age of 14. Nana vows to return before leaving. Nana returns for the family's Christmas and Boxing Day celebrations. Neither she nor the rest of the family realise their guest, [[Niall Rafferty]] ([[Barry Sloane]]), is the son Nana forced Myra to give up at birth. During the dinner, Nana toasts her granddaughter [[Tina Reilly|Tina McQueen]] ([[Leah Hackett]]) for being a surrogate mother for her half-sister [[Jacqui McQueen]] ([[Claire Cooper]]) and her boyfriend [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]). Myra gets upset and leaves the table. Nana finds her in the bathroom, weeping over old newspaper clippings of the child she had given up at birth. Myra tells Nana she could never forgive her, or herself. Nana tells her to stop complaining and that she was right to give up the child. Myra slaps Nana for her comment, but Nana slaps Myra right back, leaving as she refused to be treated in such a manner.\n\nIn February 2008, Nana returns after Myra is arrested for benefit fraud. After having an argument with Myra she went to The Dog with Niall where she got drunk and confessed to Niall that she forced Myra to give up her son aged 14. In revenge Niall attacked her and left her for dead. She was later found by her granddaughter Tina, and returned home the next day. Nana and the rest of the McQueens were at that point unaware that it was Niall that attacked her. In September 2008, it was revealed that she was on a cruise so she couldn't attend Carmel and [[Calvin Valentine]]'s ([[Ricky Whittle]]) wedding. She returned in November 2008 for Tina's funeral. She was unimpressed with Jacqui and John Paul because they failed to attend the service. Nana mentioned that her daughter, [[Kathleen McQueen]] (Alison Burrows), is in prison. She also mentions that Kathleen's daughter, [[Theresa McQueen]] ([[Jorgie Porter]]), is living with her as a consequence. After arguing with Myra over Niall, Mercedes, threw her out. She returned later the same month when it emerged that Theresa had slept with Tony, who was unaware she was only 15. Nana revealed she used to pose for a Dutch artist whose house she used to clean. In 2009 it turned out that these pictures were worth quite a lot of money; unfortunately for the McQueens, [[Leila Roy]] ([[Lena Kaur]]) had painted over the canvas. In June 2010 Theresa was sent to stay with Nana but returned after a few weeks, saying she had a miserable time.\n\nIn the summer of 2012, Carmel left Hollyoaks for a few months to live with Nana after having an accident with a self-tanning machine leaving her with a very distinct scar. Nana returned to Hollyoaks in November 2012 to help Carmel with life in the village. She arranges for her to go on a date with [[Barney Harper-McBride]] (Tom Scurr).\n\nNana has three daughters to three different fathers. She was once married to a man named Reggie but the marriage ended after Nana struggled to stay faithful. Although Nana cared for Reggie she said her true love was a man named Billy Bickerstaff who worked in a local chip shop. She has also mentioned having romances with men such as Willy Trotter, Ernie Partridge and Len Murphy. She was in an abusive relationship with a man named [[Derek Clough]] ([[Bruce Montague]]), Derek abused Marlena physically for years, he broke her jaw and put her in hospital more than once. He also raped her youngest daughter [[Reenie McQueen|Reenie]] ([[Z\u00f6e Lucker]]), getting her pregnant aged 15 with daughter [[Porsche McQueen|Porsche]] ([[Twinnie-Lee Moore|Twinnie Lee Moore]]). After Derek dies of heart attack, Reenie tells Nana that Porsche can never learn the truth about her father's identity; Nana agrees to keep the secret.\n\nIn November 2015, after Pete's sexual abuse of Porsche and her younger sister [[Cleo McQueen]] ([[Nadine Rose Mulkerrin]]) is revealed, Nana cannot cope as she feels she could have done something to prevent the line of abuse that followed in the village, back at the McQueen house, after crying her eyes out, she picked a picture Kathleen-Angel had drawn from the wall having a drawing of Nana on and reading \"My perfect Nana who looks after my family\" Nana later put the picture against her and started crying, she later disappeared and Myra and the other McQueens finding a letter from her saying she had gone to Alicante, leaving Myra horrified.\n\nNana returns in October 2016, leaving Myra shocked to find her on the doorstep, she sets out to clean the house and discovers everything that has gone on in her absence and helps Myra find a new man, due to [[Diego Salvador Martinez Hernandez De La Cruz]] (Juan Pablo Yepez) being in prison. In 2017, Nana returns to the village just as Cleo McQueen and Joel Dexter leave to go to  visit Tanzania on holiday and Nana, along with Myra,  are shocked to find out that Cleo is pregnant.\n\n== Bonnie Bevan ==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Hollyoaks\n| name= Bonnie Bevan\n| portrayer=[[Melanie Walters]]\n| years= 2007\u20132009\n| first= 21 August 2007\n| last = 14 August 2009\n| husbands= [[List of minor Hollyoaks characters (2009)#Gareth Bevan|Gareth Bevan]]\n| sons = [[Elliot Bevan]]\n| classification= [[List of past Hollyoaks characters#Last appeared in 2009|Former; recurring]]\n}}\n\n'''Bonnie Bevan''' is [[Elliot Bevan]]'s mother.

He'd been trying to track down his father, who he believed had been taken by a [[UFO]] some years earlier. Bonnie told him that his father had abandoned them and had wanted nothing to do with Elliot, even though she'd kept him up to date on Elliot for years. Elliot told her he wanted nothing more to do with her.\n\nBonnie returned on 14 August 2009 where she confronted her ex-husband [[Gareth Bevan|Gareth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a169109/2625-abi-kisses-ste.html |title=2625: Abi kisses Ste |publisher=Digital Spy |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> She informed Elliot that Gareth had had an affair when she was pregnant with him and he left to be with his mistress, who had also fallen pregnant.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Clive Harris ==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name= Clive Harris\n| series = Hollyoaks\n| portrayer=Andrew Forbes\n| first= August 2007\n| last = August 2007\n| daughters = [[Jessica Harris (Hollyoaks)|Jessica Harris]]\n| classification = [[List of past Hollyoaks characters#Last appeared in 2007|Former; guest]]\n}}\n\n'''Clive Harris''' was the father of [[Jessica Harris (Hollyoaks)|Jessica Harris]].

He told her of a business dinner he had prepared and wanted her to attend. He encouraged her to wear a sexy red dress and flirt with the client. Reluctantly, Jessica went along with him, only to see him arrested for fraud just as the deal was being made. Jessica visited him in prison and told him he'd ruined all her happy memories, as she now had to assume their money had always come from illegal activities. Clive told her they were the same type of person, whether she liked it or not. A few weeks later, he sent her some money. After some temptation to spend on herself, she instead paid back [[Jack Osborne]].\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Melissa Hurst ==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Hollyoaks\n| portrayer         = [[Carla Chases]]\n| name              = Melissa Hurst\n| first             = 7 June 2007\n| last              = 3 September 2007\n| born              = 1985\n| classification  = [[List of past Hollyoaks characters#Last appeared in 2007|Former; regular]]\n| death            = 3 September 2007\n}}\n\n'''Melissa Hurst''' was originally a friend to [[Sarah Barnes]], whom she met when the two worked together on a modelling shoot. Through Sarah, Melissa met and grew close to [[Hannah Ashworth]] after discovering she is [[Bulimia|bulimic]], an illness which Melissa also suffered from. Melissa helped Hannah to be subtle and hide her eating disorder, encouraging her to exercise regularly, go without food and to stay away from her family and friends so that she is not 'tempted' by food or alcohol - even persuading Hannah to stay at home when her family went to France.\n\nThis period of the Ashworths being in France, leaving their house to Hannah and Gilly for the duration saw Melissa become a central character in the show's plot. Melissa spent almost the whole of this time living at the Ashworths claiming she didn't want to go home, as her Mum would have forced her to eat. Hannah promised that she and Melissa would get through bulimia together and the girls soon started an extreme work out regime drinking only water and eating very little. Melissa had difficulties with [[Gilly Roach]] who thought she and Hannah were taking drugs because of the change in Hannah's personality, a fear also shared by her friends Sarah, [[Nancy Hayton]] and [[John Paul McQueen]] whose suspicions were reinforced when Sarah overheard Hannah and Melissa in the SU bar's toilets about \"disposing of the evidence\" and later the same evening, Hannah passing out.\n\nUpon the return of the Ashworths from France, Hannah's mother [[Suzanne Ashworth]] was concerned as to how skinny Hannah had become. Melissa sarcastically stated that she had given Hannah drugs, resulting in Melissa being banned from the house. Melissa though continued to visit Hannah, angering Gilly. Hannah and Melissa threatened to say he had raped Hannah if he spoke out against Melissa. In spite of these threats, Gilly alerted [[Rhys Ashworth]] to his concerns about Melissa and she was forcibly ejected from the Ashworth's barbecue. Melissa had complained about a headache during the barbecue and continued to feel unwell as, after being ejected, she and Hannah stood in the rain waiting for a taxi. Melissa collapsed and was admitted to intensive care.\n\nHannah visited Melissa in hospital and told her she was all she had in the world and she was happy they met. Melissa tells her she's a true friend. Hannah applies make-up to Melissa, who was so weak she couldn't open her lip gloss. There was a montage showing the wires, drips, Melissa's bones sticking out and Hannah's family looking for answers back at her home. Hannah cries throughout this entire segment. The song \"My Skin\" by [[Natalie Merchant]] played throughout.\n\nMelissa eventually engineered a plot to escape to Milan with Hannah, through fear that if she stayed in hospital and continued to be force-fed she would have got fat. Hannah agreed to the plan because she was fed up with her family interfering in her life. The two friends successfully escaped the hospital the next day, but had to return to Hannah's home to retrieve her passport; where Rhys and Suzanne grab her to prevent her from going. Melissa argued with Hannah's family before the stress of the situation caused her to collapse from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and despite Suzanne's attempts to revive her, Melissa died shortly after. Hannah then cradled Melissa's body, crying hysterically.\n\nMelissa's death was one of the few episodes to not feature a wrap-up scene following the end credits.\n\nIn the episode following her death, a vision of Melissa reappeared to Hannah, as Hannah struggles to cope with her grief and is terrified that her mother will use Melissa's death to force her to eat. Hannah is seen trying on Melissa's dress (during the scene we see a flashback of Melissa proudly modelling the [[size zero]] dress for Hannah) Hannah however struggles to fit into the outfit, and a vision of Melissa appears and zips it up for Hannah, before vanishing.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Valerie Holden ==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Hollyoaks\n| name= Valerie Holden\n| portrayer=[[Jacqueline Leonard]] (2007)<br />[[Samantha Giles]] (2008\u20132010)\n| years= 2007\u20132010\n| first= 6 September 2007\n| last = 13 August 2010\n| born = 29 May\n| sons=[[Danny Valentine]]\n| daughters= [[Lauren Valentine]]\n| mother=Sybil\n| classification=[[List of past Hollyoaks characters#Last appeared in 2010|Former; recurring]]\n| home = [[London]]\n}}\n\n'''Valerie \"Val\" Holden''' arrived in the village with her two children [[Danny Valentine|Danny]] and [[Lauren Valentine|Lauren]], who are the illegitimate children of [[Leo Valentine]].

Harry reappears in a dream of Tony when he is also stabbed by Breda for learning she had killed him.\n\n== Nige Foster ==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Hollyoaks\n| name= Nige Foster\n| portrayer=Sam Townend\n| years=2007\u20132009\n| first= 12 October 2007\n| last= 27 February 2009\n| classification = [[List of past Hollyoaks characters#Last appeared in 2009|Former; regular]]\n}}\n\n'''Nigel \"Nige\" Foster''' was an acquaintance of [[Ste Hay]]'s ([[Kieron Richardson]]) who took over the local drug-pushing trade from one of Ste's friends, Tommo. Nige bullied Ste into temporarily letting him move into the flat Ste shared with [[Amy Barnes]] ([[Ashley Slanina-Davies]]) and her baby [[Leah Barnes]]. When [[Michaela McQueen]] ([[Hollie-Jay Bowes]]) met him, it was lust at first sight and they quickly made use of Ste and Amy's bedroom. She forced her bandmates [[Fletch (Hollyoaks)|Jamie \"Fletch\" Fletcher]] ([[Sam Darbyshire]]) and [[Josh Ashworth]] ([[Sonny Flood]]) to let him join, although his abilities were limited to a very poor trumpet. He later asked her to give a year 11 student drugs. The student was not there and Michaela threw the drugs at Amy when she saw teacher [[Russ Owen]] ([[Stuart Manning]]) heading their way. Amy got out of trouble, but Nige wanted his money. When Amy protested, Nige threatened her.\n\nNige returned some months later when [[Sasha Valentine]] ([[Nathalie Emmanuel]]) needed heroin. She reluctantly slept with him in order to get the drugs. Fletch, who by that time was also a heroin addict, was repulsed by what she had done, but finally agreed to Nige's demand that he sell drugs to schoolchildren in return for some heroin of his own. She slept with him again while babysitting Leah, who got dangerously close to a syringe.\n\nLater, Nige needed money to pay his suppliers, and he resorted to stealing [[Justin Burton]]'s ([[Chris Fountain]]) laptop and having Sasha assist him in breaking into recently widowed [[Steph Cunningham]]'s ([[Carley Stenson]]) flat. When [[Danny Valentine]] ([[David Judge (actor)|David Judge]]) caught Sasha in Steph's flat, Danny and his father, [[Leo Valentine]] ([[Brian Bovell]]), tracked down and beat up Nige.\n\nLater, [[Calvin Valentine]] ([[Ricky Whittle]]) spotted Nige dealing drugs and took them Nige and told him to run, Calvin then put the drugs in his pocket, only for them to be uncovered by his partner Eddie later on, which resulted in Calvin nearly losing his job. [[Warren Fox]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]) revealed to Calvin he had the whole transaction between Calvin and Nige on tape, and after a few days of blackmailing Calvin with the tape, Warren asked for Calvin's assistance at The Loft. Calvin went in to find Nige there arguing with Warren. Nige spotting Calvin, pulled a knife and as Calvin tried to defuse the situation, Nige teased him about sleeping with Sasha, Calvin lost it and attacked Nige. During the scuffle Nige stabbed Calvin and Calvin hit Nige with a blunt object to the head. As Calvin was rushed to hospital, Warren met him the next day and revealed Calvin had killed Nige. Warren made plans with Calvin to dispose of the body, but Calvin failed to keep them, resorting in Warren having to dispose of the body himself.\n\nOn 20 November 2008, several months after the murder, the viewers discovered Warren was paying Nige to stay out of sight to continue the illusion Calvin has killed him. Calvin eventually confessed to Sasha that he murdered Nige, and racked with guilt posted his and [[Carmel McQueen]]'s ([[Gemma Merna]]) life savings through the letterbox of Nige's parents' house. On 21 January 2009, Nige showed up at The Loft wanting even more money from Warren and in the process nearly exposed himself to Calvin. Warren snuck Nige outside and said that if he ever saw him again he would kill him. On 27 February, Calvin discovered Nige dealing in a carpark. Nige fled and this was his last appearance.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Pete Webster ==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Hollyoaks\n| name=Pete Webster\n| portrayer=[[Richard Cambridge (British actor)|Richard Cambridge]]\n| years=2007\n| first= 8 October 2007\n| last= 9 December 2007\n| classification= [[List of past Hollyoaks characters#Last appeared in 2007|Former; recurring]]\n| mother= Mrs. Webster\n}}\n\n'''Pete Webster''' was the head of the Careers department at Hollyoaks High School.

During a blackout, Pete tried to force himself on Tina, only to meet a fist belonging to [[Russ Owen]] Tina's brother-in-law; Tina was promptly fired, and Russ suspended. Tina had the last laugh though, as her sister [[Jacqui McQueen]] took over her job and flirted heavily with Pete. Alone in his office, she convinced him to take his clothes off. When he did, she kneed him in the groin, grabbed his clothes and keys, and locked him in the office.

He told Tom's brother [[Max Cunningham]], who panicked as Simon had taken Tom to the park and they weren't answering Max's calls. They broke into Simon's home and found a locked room which was a boy's bedroom. When Max caught up to Tom and Simon at the park, he began beating Simon until he was pulled away. Soon rumours spread around town and when Simon went into the Dog the next day, Gilly and [[Jake Dean]] taunted and jeered him. They followed him down the street, gathering a lynch mob who followed him to his home and smashed bottles and bricks against the doors and windows.\n\nMeanwhile, Simon's ex-wife Gemma, whom he'd mentioned but no one had ever seen, finally showed up, and was horrified by Max's accusations. She told them the swimming photos were for certificates for each of the kids Simon taught, and the bedroom was a reminder of their son Connor, who had drowned, which was the reason Simon had become a lifeguard in the first place. When the police showed up, the mob ran away. Afterwards, Gemma, Max and O.B. raced to Simon's home, but by the time they got inside, they found him unconscious on the kitchen floor from vodka and pills, holding a photo of his son. Simon soon recovered, but with his reputation in tatters, he realised he could no longer stay in Chester. He asked O.B. to join him working at a bar in [[Tenerife]], but O.B. declined.

As none of the locals had ever seen her, when they began to believe Simon was a paedophile, they assumed he had made her up. Gemma arrived in town the day a lynch mob had formed around his home, and she explained to Max and O.B. that her and Simon's son had drowned, which was one of the reasons Simon had become a lifeguard, and that Simon would never harm a child. Gemma, Max, and O.B. found Simon slumped on the kitchen floor after a suicide attempt. Gemma was at Simon's side during his hospital stay, but when he recovered, they again parted.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Other characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Character \n! scope=\"col\" | Date(s) \n! scope=\"col\" | Actor \n! scope=\"col\" | Circumstances\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|'''Freddie'''}}\n| January 2007\n| [[Ben Parr]]\n| When [[Becca Dean]] was sent to prison, her sister [[Nancy Hayton|Nancy]] needed a lodger.

Tina briefly appeared in a flashback on 20 November 2014 when the McQueen family remember her half-sister [[Carmel McQueen|Carmel Valentine]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) at her funeral.\n\n==Character creation==\nThe character of Tina was introduced in August 2006 as one of the McQueen sisters.

So what better way than to be blown up in one of the most shocking plotlines of the autumn? Regardless of who it is, fans are going to be gutted, as the McQueen sisters are some of the most popular characters on the show. All that can be revealed at the moment is that there is plenty of blood and a huge explosion. And one of the McQueen clan is murdered.\"<ref name=\"explosion\"/>\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===Backstory===\nTina was born to [[Myra McQueen]] ([[Nicole Barber-Lane]]) following a one-night stand with a bingo caller called Marvin. Myra fell in love with Marvin, but after telling him she was pregnant with Tina, he gave her money to abort the child. Myra, however, did not use the money for an abortion and told Marvin she was keeping the baby. After this, Myra never heard from him again. She then gave birth to Tina, who she named after [[Tina Turner]]. In order to make Tina believe her father cared for her, Myra sent her birthday cards from Marvin every year, until Tina discovered the truth.\n\n===2006\u201308===\nTina meets [[Dominic Reilly]] ([[John Pickard (British actor)|John Pickard]]). They soon discover that they both share interests in reading and a passive demeanour. Following many failed dates, Tina and Dom finally kiss and lose their virginity to each other. Tina's sisters [[Carmel McQueen|Carmel]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) and [[Michaela McQueen|Michaela]] ([[Hollie-Jay Bowes]]) overhear Dom calling Tina \"Cathy\", a character from her favourite play ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', and assume he is having an affair with [[Kathy Barnes]] ([[Sarah Jane Buckley]]). Michaela and Carmel decide to expose Dom's apparent affair, but end up finding Dom and Tina sleeping together. Dom proposes to Tina, and they begin to plan their wedding. However, Tina and Dom discover their planned wedding clashes with Tina's sister [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) and fianc\u00e9 [[Russ Owen]] ([[Stuart Manning]]), so Myra suggests they have a double wedding and Mercedes and Tina reluctantly agree. During their joint hen night, Tina and Mercedes, along with Carmel and [[Jacqui McQueen]] ([[Claire Cooper]]), find an unconscious [[Clare Devine|Clare Cunningham]] ([[Gemma Bissix]]), after she is pushed from a balcony. On the wedding day, [[Louise Summers]] ([[Roxanne McKee]]) interrupts the ceremony claiming Mercedes slept with [[Warren Fox]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]) on the night Clare was pushed, Mercedes being his only alibi after his arrest for attempted murder. In order for the wedding not to be ruined, Tina tells Russ that Mercedes was with her all night. After marrying Dom, Tina tells Mercedes she will never forgive her for spoiling her wedding day. Due to lack of privacy at the McQueen house, Tina and Dom move in with Jacqui and her boyfriend, also Dom's brother, [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]).\n\nTina begins working as a careers advisor at Hollyoaks High school. Tina's boss [[Pete Webster]] ([[Richard Cambridge (British actor)|Richard Cambridge]]) begins to sexually harass Tina, later playing mind games when she rejects his advances. Tina tries to tell Dom about Pete's harassment but he does not listen and befriends Pete. After finishing work one night, Pete tries to rape Tina but Russ stops him. Dom later takes Pete's side when Tina tells him what happened so she and Russ have a one-night stand for comfort, and the next day, Tina tells Dom that their marriage is over.\n\nTina agrees to be a surrogate for Jacqui and Tony who cannot have children. Myra and Mercedes are not happy with the plan and try to convince her not to go through with being inseminated with Tony's sperm. However, Tina insists but Dom is also unhappy, but the pair reconcile and he agrees to stand by Tina, who is overjoyed to discover she is pregnant. However, she discovers at her 12-week scan that the foetus is 15 weeks and therefore must have been conceived when she slept with Russ. Tina confesses her affair to Jacqui, who is furious, but tells her to keep it a secret or both their relationships will be over. A heavily pregnant Tina confides in [[Niall Rafferty]] ([[Barry Sloane]]), telling him she is considering putting her child up for adoption, unaware Niall is her half-brother who Myra put up for adoption. Tina tells Jacqui her adoption plans during a phone-call. An angry Niall then pushes Tina down a flight of steps, and tells the McQueens he saw [[Fletch (Hollyoaks)|Jamie \"Fletch\" Fletcher]] ([[Sam Darbyshire]]) push her.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/gallery/gallery-specials/7165/1/0/spoiler-alert-hollyoaks--039--tina-mcqueen-gets-pushed-down-the-stairs/1/ |title=SPOILER ALERT Hollyoaks' Tina McQueen gets pushed down the stairs |work=[[NOW (British magazine)|Now magazine]] |publisher=([[IPC Media]]) |year=2008 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref> Tina is rushed to hospital and has a baby son that she names [[Max McQueen (Hollyoaks)|Max]]. Due to injuries sustained in her fall, Tina has an emergency hysterectomy, rendering her unable to have any more children. Jacqui and Tony want to raise Max, but Tina decides to keep him. The truth about Max's paternity is revealed, making Dom and Tina split up. In order to make Max's life as normal as possible, Tina and Russ agree to move in together. However, Tina does not love Russ and soon moves out. As she does, Niall kidnaps her and ties her up in an abandoned church with her sisters. Niall leaves Myra a note from Tina, similar to one she left with him as a baby, so she goes looking for her daughters. When she arrives at the church, Niall makes Myra choose which two children will live, telling her that he will kill the rest. Myra chooses Tina, because of Max, and Michaela, because she is the youngest. Dom, Tony, [[Jack Osborne]] ([[Jimmy McKenna]]) and [[Darren Osborne]] ([[Ashley Taylor Dawson]]) enter the church to save the McQueens from Niall, who detonates explosives.

Since making her first appearance in August 2006 as part of the [[McQueen family]], Tina has been involved in storylines including [[sexual harassment]] and [[surrogacy]]. Tina was killed off in a church explosion on 17 October 2008, shortly after Hackett decided to leave the serial. Tina briefly appeared in a flashback on 20 November 2014 when the McQueen family remember her half-sister [[Carmel McQueen|Carmel Valentine]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) at her funeral.\n\n==Character creation==\nThe character of Tina was introduced in August 2006 as one of the McQueen sisters. During 2008, it was announced that one of the McQueens would be killed off in a church explosion, caused by secret McQueen [[Niall Rafferty]] ([[Barry Sloane]]).<ref name=\"explosion\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a126633/mcqueen-sisters-in-hollyoaks-explosion.html |title=McQueen sisters in Hollyoaks explosion |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Kris |last=Green |date=26 August 2008 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref> The exact details of which character would be killed were due to be kept secret until the episodes aired, however, Hackett revealed she had quit the soap early in 2008 days before her character was killed.\n\nA spokesperson for ''Hollyoaks'' commented on the storyline, \"Sadly, one of the girls decided they had had enough and told producers that they wanted out. So what better way than to be blown up in one of the most shocking plotlines of the autumn? Regardless of who it is, fans are going to be gutted, as the McQueen sisters are some of the most popular characters on the show. All that can be revealed at the moment is that there is plenty of blood and a huge explosion. And one of the McQueen clan is murdered.\"<ref name=\"explosion\"/>\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===Backstory===\nTina was born to [[Myra McQueen]] ([[Nicole Barber-Lane]]) following a one-night stand with a bingo caller called Marvin. Myra fell in love with Marvin, but after telling him she was pregnant with Tina, he gave her money to abort the child. Myra, however, did not use the money for an abortion and told Marvin she was keeping the baby. After this, Myra never heard from him again. She then gave birth to Tina, who she named after [[Tina Turner]]. In order to make Tina believe her father cared for her, Myra sent her birthday cards from Marvin every year, until Tina discovered the truth.\n\n===2006\u201308===\nTina meets [[Dominic Reilly]] ([[John Pickard (British actor)|John Pickard]]). They soon discover that they both share interests in reading and a passive demeanour. Following many failed dates, Tina and Dom finally kiss and lose their virginity to each other. Tina's sisters [[Carmel McQueen|Carmel]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) and [[Michaela McQueen|Michaela]] ([[Hollie-Jay Bowes]]) overhear Dom calling Tina \"Cathy\", a character from her favourite play ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', and assume he is having an affair with [[Kathy Barnes]] ([[Sarah Jane Buckley]]). Michaela and Carmel decide to expose Dom's apparent affair, but end up finding Dom and Tina sleeping together. Dom proposes to Tina, and they begin to plan their wedding. However, Tina and Dom discover their planned wedding clashes with Tina's sister [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) and fianc\u00e9 [[Russ Owen]] ([[Stuart Manning]]), so Myra suggests they have a double wedding and Mercedes and Tina reluctantly agree. During their joint hen night, Tina and Mercedes, along with Carmel and [[Jacqui McQueen]] ([[Claire Cooper]]), find an unconscious [[Clare Devine|Clare Cunningham]] ([[Gemma Bissix]]), after she is pushed from a balcony. On the wedding day, [[Louise Summers]] ([[Roxanne McKee]]) interrupts the ceremony claiming Mercedes slept with [[Warren Fox]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]) on the night Clare was pushed, Mercedes being his only alibi after his arrest for attempted murder. In order for the wedding not to be ruined, Tina tells Russ that Mercedes was with her all night. After marrying Dom, Tina tells Mercedes she will never forgive her for spoiling her wedding day. Due to lack of privacy at the McQueen house, Tina and Dom move in with Jacqui and her boyfriend, also Dom's brother, [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]).\n\nTina begins working as a careers advisor at Hollyoaks High school. Tina's boss [[Pete Webster]] ([[Richard Cambridge (British actor)|Richard Cambridge]]) begins to sexually harass Tina, later playing mind games when she rejects his advances. Tina tries to tell Dom about Pete's harassment but he does not listen and befriends Pete. After finishing work one night, Pete tries to rape Tina but Russ stops him. Dom later takes Pete's side when Tina tells him what happened so she and Russ have a one-night stand for comfort, and the next day, Tina tells Dom that their marriage is over.\n\nTina agrees to be a surrogate for Jacqui and Tony who cannot have children. Myra and Mercedes are not happy with the plan and try to convince her not to go through with being inseminated with Tony's sperm. However, Tina insists but Dom is also unhappy, but the pair reconcile and he agrees to stand by Tina, who is overjoyed to discover she is pregnant. However, she discovers at her 12-week scan that the foetus is 15 weeks and therefore must have been conceived when she slept with Russ. Tina confesses her affair to Jacqui, who is furious, but tells her to keep it a secret or both their relationships will be over. A heavily pregnant Tina confides in [[Niall Rafferty]] ([[Barry Sloane]]), telling him she is considering putting her child up for adoption, unaware Niall is her half-brother who Myra put up for adoption. Tina tells Jacqui her adoption plans during a phone-call. An angry Niall then pushes Tina down a flight of steps, and tells the McQueens he saw [[Fletch (Hollyoaks)|Jamie \"Fletch\" Fletcher]] ([[Sam Darbyshire]]) push her.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/gallery/gallery-specials/7165/1/0/spoiler-alert-hollyoaks--039--tina-mcqueen-gets-pushed-down-the-stairs/1/ |title=SPOILER ALERT Hollyoaks' Tina McQueen gets pushed down the stairs |work=[[NOW (British magazine)|Now magazine]] |publisher=([[IPC Media]]) |year=2008 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref> Tina is rushed to hospital and has a baby son that she names [[Max McQueen (Hollyoaks)|Max]]. Due to injuries sustained in her fall, Tina has an emergency hysterectomy, rendering her unable to have any more children. Jacqui and Tony want to raise Max, but Tina decides to keep him. The truth about Max's paternity is revealed, making Dom and Tina split up. In order to make Max's life as normal as possible, Tina and Russ agree to move in together. However, Tina does not love Russ and soon moves out. As she does, Niall kidnaps her and ties her up in an abandoned church with her sisters. Niall leaves Myra a note from Tina, similar to one she left with him as a baby, so she goes looking for her daughters. When she arrives at the church, Niall makes Myra choose which two children will live, telling her that he will kill the rest. Myra chooses Tina, because of Max, and Michaela, because she is the youngest. Dom, Tony, [[Jack Osborne]] ([[Jimmy McKenna]]) and [[Darren Osborne]] ([[Ashley Taylor Dawson]]) enter the church to save the McQueens from Niall, who detonates explosives. All the McQueens survive and begin to exit the church in the aftermath of the explosion but return when they learn that Niall is holding [[John Paul McQueen]] ([[James Sutton (actor)|James Sutton]]) hostage. The floor collapses and Tina is trapped under the rubble. Dom holds Tina, who is fatally wounded. Tina tells Dom how much she loves him before dying.

He played three seasons of [[college basketball]] for [[Bellarmine University]], becoming the only player in school history to be named to the NABC All-America Team two years in a row. He was also a key member of the [[Bellarmine Knights]]' 2011 championship-winning team, helping the school claim their first NCAA Division II National Championship.\n\nKendle moved to Australia in 2015 and saw immediate success, claiming the [[Queensland Basketball League|QBL]] Most Valuable Player award as a member of the Toowoomba Mountaineers. The following year, he joined the [[Bendigo Braves]] and helped them win the [[South East Australian Basketball League|SEABL]] championship. He was also named league MVP and Grand Final MVP. His impressive season with Bendigo earned him a spot on the [[Brisbane Bullets]] roster late in the [[2016\u201317 NBL season]]. He went on to play in New Zealand with the [[Canterbury Rams]] in 2017 before having a short stint with the [[Sydney Kings]]. He then had return stints with the Braves and the Bullets.\n\nIn November 2019, Kendle was named head coach of the South West Metro Pirates.\n\n==Early life==\nKendle was born and raised in [[Jeffersonville, Indiana]], and grew up playing basketball. As a sophomore at [[Jeffersonville High School]], Kendle was nearly cut from the basketball team due to his small stature; he was five-foot seven inches tall and 140 pounds. He was told he wasn't good enough to make the varsity basketball team. The head coach on the senior varsity team wanted to cut him, but the junior varsity coach knew his father and they had a mutual respect. He kept Kendle on the team, but he rode the bench for the whole season. The next year, he hit a six-inch growth spurt and worked really hard physically. He subsequently started on the varsity team as a junior.<ref name=faith>{{cite web | last=Bourke | first=Adam | url=http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/3920370/bendigo-braves-star-jeremy-kendle-keeps-the-faith/ | title=Bendigo Braves star Jeremy Kendle keeps the faith | work=BendigoAdvertiser.com.au | date=May 20, 2016 | accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs a senior in 2005\u201306 playing for coach Jimmy Just, Kendle averaged 15.1 points and 4.4 rebounds per game. He helped lead the Red Devils to a 23\u20132 record and the Hoosier Hills Conference Championship, and subsequently earned first team All-District, All-Region and All-Area selection.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://athletics.bellarmine.edu/roster.aspx?rp_id=1727 | title=Jeremy Kendle - 2011-12 Men's Basketball | work=Bellarmine.edu | accessdate=December 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring his high school years, Kendle's mother battled [[ovarian cancer]]. Kendle has said of those tough times, \"It all happened for a reason. It made my character stronger.

He returned home to Jeffersonville for the 2007\u201308 season and fully recovered.

After three months out, he came back and broke his right foot again in two different places. While a less driven athlete would have pulled the pin on his basketball career, Kendle had other ideas. He subsequently changed his diet and went through a vigorous therapy program.<ref name=\"faith\" />\n\nHis comeback in 2009 saw him earn a try-out with [[Bellarmine University]], despite his commitment to being a walk-on at the [[University of Southern Indiana]], a rival school of Bellarmine. He played well in the trial at Bellarmine, and a few days later, he was given a full scholarship.<ref name=\"faith\" /> Bellarmine was only a 20-minute drive from his family home which allowed him to spend time with his ill mother and gave his family the chance to watch him play regularly.<ref name=\"faith\" />\n\n===Bellarmine University===\n\n====2009\u201310 season====\nKendle began playing for the [[Bellarmine Knights]] during the 2009\u201310 season.

Kendle''' (born March 15, 1988) is an American professional [[basketball]] player who is currently player/coach of the South West Metro Pirates of the [[NBL1 North]]. He played three seasons of [[college basketball]] for [[Bellarmine University]], becoming the only player in school history to be named to the NABC All-America Team two years in a row. He was also a key member of the [[Bellarmine Knights]]' 2011 championship-winning team, helping the school claim their first NCAA Division II National Championship.\n\nKendle moved to Australia in 2015 and saw immediate success, claiming the [[Queensland Basketball League|QBL]] Most Valuable Player award as a member of the Toowoomba Mountaineers. The following year, he joined the [[Bendigo Braves]] and helped them win the [[South East Australian Basketball League|SEABL]] championship. He was also named league MVP and Grand Final MVP. His impressive season with Bendigo earned him a spot on the [[Brisbane Bullets]] roster late in the [[2016\u201317 NBL season]]. He went on to play in New Zealand with the [[Canterbury Rams]] in 2017 before having a short stint with the [[Sydney Kings]]. He then had return stints with the Braves and the Bullets.\n\nIn November 2019, Kendle was named head coach of the South West Metro Pirates.\n\n==Early life==\nKendle was born and raised in [[Jeffersonville, Indiana]], and grew up playing basketball. As a sophomore at [[Jeffersonville High School]], Kendle was nearly cut from the basketball team due to his small stature; he was five-foot seven inches tall and 140 pounds. He was told he wasn't good enough to make the varsity basketball team.
