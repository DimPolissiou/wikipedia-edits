He rose through the ranks of a family-run business to become [[Marvel Comics]]' primary creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion from a small division of a publishing house to a [[multimedia]] corporation that dominated the comics industry.\n\nIn collaboration with others at Marvel\u2014particularly co-writer/artists [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Steve Ditko]]\u2014he co-created numerous popular fictional characters, including superheroes [[Spider-Man]], the [[X-Men]], [[Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], the [[Hulk]], [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff)|Black Widow]], the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Doctor Strange]], [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Ant-Man]]. In doing so, he pioneered a more naturalistic approach to writing superhero comics in the 1960s, and in the 1970s he challenged the restrictions of the [[Comics Code Authority]], indirectly leading to changes in its policies. In the 1980s he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results. Following his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, he remained a public figurehead for the company, and frequently made [[cameo appearance]]s in films and television shows based on Marvel characters, on which he received an executive producer credit. Meanwhile, he continued independent creative ventures into his 90s, until his death in 2018.\n\nLee was inducted into the comic book industry's [[Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame]] in 1994 and the [[Jack Kirby Hall of Fame]] in 1995. He received the [[National Endowment for the Arts|NEA]]'s [[National Medal of Arts]] in 2008.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Personal life==\n===Early life===\nStanley Martin Lieber was born on December 28, 1922, in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller|first= John Jackson| url=http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays |title=Comics Industry Birthdays|work= [[Comics Buyer's Guide]] |date=June 10, 2005 |location=Iola, Wisconsin|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5trAbNQWw?url=http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays|archivedate=October 30, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> in the apartment of his [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian-born Jewish]] immigrant parents, Celia (''n\u00e9e'' Solomon) and Jack Lieber, at the corner of West 98th Street and [[West End Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]].<ref name=autobio-p5 /><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZzuwrsIil0UC&q=Celia+Solomon+Lieber&dq=Celia+Solomon+Lieber |title=The Celebrity Who's Who&nbsp;\u2013 World Almanac|access-date=August 13, 2013 |isbn=978-0-345-33990-4 |date=September 1986|page=213|last1=Almanac|first1=World}}</ref> Though raised in a Jewish household, in a 2002 interview, he stated when asked if he believed in God, \"Well, let me put it this way...

I didn't even know they published comics. I was fresh out of high school, and I wanted to get into the publishing business, if I could. There was an ad in the paper that said, \"Assistant Wanted in a Publishing House.\" When I found out that they wanted me to assist in comics, I figured, 'Well, I'll stay here for a little while and get some experience, and then I'll get out into the real world.' ...&nbsp;I just wanted to know, 'What do you do in a publishing company?'

They were turning out most of the artwork. Then there was the publisher, Martin Goodman&nbsp;... And that was about the only staff that I was involved with. After a while, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby left. I was about 17 years old [sic], and Martin Goodman said to me, 'Do you think you can hold down the job of editor until I can find a real person?' When you're 17, what do you know? I said, 'Sure! I can do it!'

Lee recorded messages to the newly formed [[Merry Marvel Marching Society]] fan club in 1965.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://209.51.142.186/~dogatco/mmms/mmms65.mp3 |title=Audio of Merry Marvel Marching Society record |access-date=January 30, 2006 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210075130/http://209.51.142.186/~dogatco/mmms/mmms65.mp3 |archivedate=December 10, 2005}}, including voice of Stan Lee</ref> By 1967, the brand was well-enough ensconced in popular culture that a March 3 [[WBAI]] radio program with Lee and Kirby as guests was titled \"Will Success Spoil Spiderman\" [sic].<ref name =nyt03031967>{{cite news |title=Radio |date=March 3, 1967 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B1EF93E5F107B93C1A91788D85F438685F9 |access-date=April 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518225339/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B1EF93E5F107B93C1A91788D85F438685F9 |archive-date=May 18, 2013 |url-status=live }} Abstract only; full article requires payment or subscription</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Lee scripted, art-directed and edited most of Marvel's series, moderated the letters pages, wrote a monthly column called \"[[Stan's Soapbox]]\", and wrote endless promotional copy, often signing off with his trademark motto, \"[[wikt:excelsior|Excelsior]]!\" (which is also the [[List of U.S. state and territory mottos|New York state motto]]). To maintain his workload and meet deadlines, he used a system that was used previously by various comic-book studios, but due to Lee's success with it, became known as the \"[[Marvel Method]]\". Typically, Lee would brainstorm a story with the artist and then prepare a brief synopsis rather than a full script. Based on the synopsis, the artist would fill the allotted number of pages by determining and drawing the panel-to-panel storytelling. After the artist turned in penciled pages, Lee would write the [[word balloon]]s and captions, and then oversee the lettering and coloring. In effect, the artists were co-plotters, whose collaborative first drafts Lee built upon.\n\nFollowing Ditko's departure from Marvel in 1966, [[John Romita Sr.]] became Lee's collaborator on ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. Within a year, it overtook ''Fantastic Four'' to become the company's top seller.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Roy |first2=Peter |last2=Sanderson |title=The Marvel Vault: A Museum-in-a-Book with Rare Collectibles from the World of Marvel |publisher=[[Running Press]] |year=2007 |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |page=98 |isbn=978-0-7624-2844-1}}</ref> Lee and Romita's stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on Spider-Man's adventures.<ref>{{cite book |last=Manning |first=Matthew K. |editor-last=Gilbert |editor-first=Laura |chapter=1960s |title=Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 37|isbn = 978-0-7566-9236-0 |quote=[Stan Lee] knew that most readers tuned in every month for a glimpse of that side of Spider-Man's life as much as they did to see the wall-crawler battle the latest supervillain.}}</ref> The stories became more topical, addressing issues such as the [[Vietnam War]],<ref>Manning \"1960s\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 39: ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #47 (April 1967) \"Kraven's latest rematch with Spidey was set during a going-away party for Flash Thompson, who was facing the very real issue of the Vietnam War draft.\"</ref> political elections,<ref>Manning \"1960s\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 43: ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #1 (July 1968) \"Drawn by Romita and Jim Mooney, the mammoth 52-page lead story focused on corrupt politician Richard Raleigh's plot to terrorize the city.\"</ref> and [[student activism]].<ref>Manning \"1960s\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 46: ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #68 (January 1969) \"Stan Lee tackled the issues of the day again when, with artists John Romita and Jim Mooney, he dealt with social unrest at Empire State University.\"</ref> [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]], introduced in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #51 (August 1967) was one of the first African-American characters in comics to play a serious supporting role.<ref>{{cite book |last=David |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter David |last2=Greenberger |first2=Robert |author2-link=Robert Greenberger |title=The Spider-Man Vault: A Museum-in-a-Book with Rare Collectibles Spun from Marvel's Web |publisher=[[Running Press]] |year=2010 |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |page=[https://archive.org/details/sinatrahollywood0000knig/page/34 34] |isbn=978-0-7624-3772-6 |quote=Joseph 'Robbie' Robertson made his debut in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #51, in a manner that was as quiet and unassuming as the character himself.

{{IPAc-en|\u02c8|l|i\u02d0|b|\u0259r}}; December 28, 1922&nbsp;\u2013 November 12, 2018) was an American [[comic book]] writer, editor, publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run business to become [[Marvel Comics]]' primary creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion from a small division of a publishing house to a [[multimedia]] corporation that dominated the comics industry.\n\nIn collaboration with others at Marvel\u2014particularly co-writer/artists [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Steve Ditko]]\u2014he co-created numerous popular fictional characters, including superheroes [[Spider-Man]], the [[X-Men]], [[Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], the [[Hulk]], [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff)|Black Widow]], the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Doctor Strange]], [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Ant-Man]]. In doing so, he pioneered a more naturalistic approach to writing superhero comics in the 1960s, and in the 1970s he challenged the restrictions of the [[Comics Code Authority]], indirectly leading to changes in its policies. In the 1980s he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results.

To maintain his workload and meet deadlines, he used a system that was used previously by various comic-book studios, but due to Lee's success with it, became known as the \"[[Marvel Method]]\". Typically, Lee would brainstorm a story with the artist and then prepare a brief synopsis rather than a full script. Based on the synopsis, the artist would fill the allotted number of pages by determining and drawing the panel-to-panel storytelling.

Lee stated that POW's CEO Shane Duffy and co-founder Gill Champion had presented him with what they said was a non-exclusive license for POW for him to sign, under Camsing, to use his likeness and other intellectual property; however, this contract turned out to be an exclusive license, which Lee claimed he would never have entered.

In a small portion of northwestern Patagonia, indigenous peoples practiced agriculture, while in the remaining territory, peoples lived as hunter-gatherers, traveling by foot in eastern Patagonia or by [[canoe]] in the [[fjords and channels of Chile|fjords and channels]]. While the interest of the [[Spanish Empire]] had been chiefly to keep other European powers away from Patagonia, independent Chile and Argentina began to slowly colonize the territory over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries. This process brought a decline of the indigenous populations while at the same time thousands of Europeans, Argentines, [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago|Chilotes]] and mainland Chileans settled in Patagonia. [[Territorial dispute|Border disputes]] between Argentina and Chile were recurrent in the 20th century. Nearly all of these disputes have been settled today. \n\nThe contemporary economy of eastern Patagonia revolves around sheep farming and oil and gas extraction, while in western Patagonia [[fishing in Chile|fishing]], [[aquaculture in Chile|salmon aquaculture]] and [[Tourism in Chile|tourism]] dominates. Culturally, Patagonia has a varied heritage including [[Criollo people|Criollo]], [[Mestizo]], [[Indigenous peoples of South America|Indigenous]] and non-[[Iberians|Iberian European]] influences.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Patagonia comes from the word ''[[patagon|patag\u00f3n]]'',<ref name=\"Pigafetta\">[[Antonio Pigafetta]], ''[[:wikisource:it:Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo|Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo]]'', 1524: \"Il capitano generale nomin\u00f2 questi popoli Patagoni.\" [https://archive.org/stream/firstthreeenglis00arberich#page/252/mode/1up/search/Patagoni A Brief Declaration of the Vyage abowte the Worlde by Antonie Pygafetta Vincentine, Rycharde Eden, ''The Decades of the Newe Worlde or West India,'' London, William Powell, 1555.] The original word would probably be in [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]'s native Portuguese (''patag\u00e3o'') or the Spanish of his men (''patag\u00f3n''). It has been interpreted later as \"big foot\", but the etymology refers to a literary character in a Spanish novel of the early 16th century: \"''Patagon'', said to be engendred by a beast in the woods, being the strangest, most misshapen and counterfeite creature in the world. He hath good understanding, is amorous of women, and keepeth company with one of whom, it is said, he was engendred. He hath the face of a Dogge, great eares, which hang down upon his shoulders, his teeth sharp and big, standing out of his mouth very much: his feet are like a Harts, and he runneth wondrous lightly. Such as have seen him, tell marvelous matters of him, because he chaseth ordinarily among the mountains, with two Lyons in a chain like a lease, and a bow in his hand\".[http://eebo.chadwyck.com/search/full_rec?SOURCE=pgimages.cfg&ACTION=ByID&ID=99850463&FILE=&SEARCHSCREEN=param(SEARCHSCREEN)&VID=177262&PAGENO=238&ZOOM=50&VIEWPORT=&SEARCHCONFIG=param(SEARCHCONFIG)&DISPLAY=param(DISPLAY)&HIGHLIGHT_KEYWORD=param(HIGHLIGHT_KEYWORD) Anthony Munday, ''The Famous and Renowned Historie of Primaleon of Greece,'' 1619, cap.XXXIII: \"How Primaleon\u2026 found the Grand Patagon \".]</ref> which was used by Magellan in 1520 to describe the native tribes of the region, whom his expedition thought to be giants.

Both countries have organized their Patagonian territories into nonequivalent administrative subdivisions - [[Provinces of Argentina|provinces]] and [[Departments of Argentina|departments]] in Argentina, and [[Regions of Chile|regions]], [[Provinces of Chile|provinces]], and [[Communes of Chile|communes]] in Chile. As Chile is a [[unitary state]], its first-level administrative divisions\u2014the regions\u2014enjoy far less autonomy than analogous Argentine provinces. Argentine provinces have elected governors and legislatures, while Chilean regions have government-appointed intendants.\n\nThe Patagonian Provinces of Argentina are [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]], [[Neuqu\u00e9n Province|Neuqu\u00e9n]], [[R\u00edo Negro Province|R\u00edo Negro]], [[Chubut Province|Chubut]], [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz]], and [[Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina|Tierra del Fuego]]. The southernmost part of [[Buenos Aires Province]] can also be considered part of Patagonia.\n\nThe two Chilean regions indisputedly located entirely within Patagonia are [[Ays\u00e9n Region|Ays\u00e9n]] and [[Magallanes Region|Magallanes]]. [[Palena Province]], a part of the [[Los Lagos Region]], is also located within Patagonia. By some definitions, Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago, the rest of the Los Lagos Region, and part of the Los R\u00edos Region are also part of Patagonia.\n\n==Climate==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2011}}\n{{See also|Climate of Argentina|Climatic regions of Argentina|Climate of Chile}}\n[[File:Punta Arenas con nieve.jpeg|thumb|left|View of Punta Arenas, Chile, in winter]]\nThe overall climate is cool and dry. The east coast is warmer than the west, especially in summer, as a branch of the southern equatorial current reaches its shores, whereas the west coast is washed by a cold current. However, winters are colder on the inland plateaus east of the slopes and further down the coast on the southeast end of the Patagonian region. For example, at [[Puerto Montt]], on the inlet behind Chilo\u00e9 Island, the mean annual temperature is {{convert|11|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and the average extremes are {{convert|25.5|and|-1.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, whereas at [[Bah\u00eda Blanca]] near the Atlantic coast and just outside the northern confines of Patagonia, the annual temperature is {{convert|15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and the range much greater, as temperatures above 35&nbsp;\u00b0C and below \u22125&nbsp;\u00b0C are recorded every year. At Punta Arenas, in the extreme south, the mean temperature is {{convert|6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and the average extremes are {{convert|24.5|and|-2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The prevailing winds are westerly, and the westward slope has a much heavier precipitation than the eastern in a [[rainshadow]] effect;<ref name=\"Princeton\"/> the western islands close to [[Torres del Paine]] receive an annual precipitation of 4,000 to 7,000&nbsp;mm, whilst the eastern hills are less than 800&nbsp;mm and the plains may be as low as 200&nbsp;mm annual precipitation.<ref name=\"Princeton\"/>\n\nPrecipitation is highly seasonal in northwestern Patagonia. For example, Villa La Angostura in Argentina, close to the border with Chile, receives up to 434&nbsp;mm of rain and snow in May, 297&nbsp;mm in June, and 273 in July, compared to 80 in February and 72 in March. The total for the city is 2074&nbsp;mm, making it one of the rainiest in Argentina. Further west, some areas receive up to 4,000&nbsp;mm and more, especially on the Chilean side. In the northeast, the seasons for rain are reversed; most rain falls from occasional summer thunderstorms, but totals barely reach 500&nbsp;mm in the northeast corner, and rapidly decrease to less than 300&nbsp;mm. The Patagonian west coast, which belongs exclusively to Chile, has a cool oceanic climate, with summer maximum temperatures ranging from 14&nbsp;\u00b0C in the south to 19&nbsp;\u00b0C in the north (and nights between 5 and 11&nbsp;\u00b0C) and very high precipitation, from 2,000 to more than 7,000&nbsp;mm in local microclimates. Snow is uncommon at the coast in the north, but happens more often in the south, and frost is usually not very intense.\n\nImmediately east from the coast are the Andes, cut by deep fjords in the south and by deep lakes in the north, and with varying temperatures according to the altitude. The tree line ranges from close to 2,000 m on the northern side (except for the Andes in northern Neuqu\u00e9n in Argentina, where sunnier and dryer conditions allow trees to grow up to close to 3,000 m), and diminishes southward to only 600\u2013800 m in Tierra del Fuego. Precipitation changes dramatically from one spot to the other, and diminishes very quickly eastward. An example of this is Laguna Fr\u00edas, in Argentina, receives 4,400&nbsp;mm yearly. The city of Bariloche, about 40&nbsp;km further east, receives about 1,000&nbsp;mm, and the airport, another 15&nbsp;km east, receives less than 600&nbsp;mm. The easterly slopes of the Andes are home to several Argentine cities: San Mart\u00edn de los Andes, Bariloche, El Bols\u00f3n, Esquel, and El Calafate. Temperatures there are milder in the summer (in the north, between 20 and 24&nbsp;\u00b0C, with cold nights between 4 and 9&nbsp;\u00b0C; in the south, summers are between 16 and 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, at night temperatures are similar to the north) and much colder in the winter, with frequent snowfall (although snow cover rarely lasts very long). Daytime highs range from 3 to 9&nbsp;\u00b0C in the north, and from 0 to 7&nbsp;\u00b0C in the south, whereas nights range from \u22125 to 2&nbsp;\u00b0C everywhere. Cold waves can bring much colder values; a temperature of -21&nbsp;\u00b0C has been recorded in Bariloche, and most places can often have temperatures between \u221212 and \u221215&nbsp;\u00b0C and highs staying around 0&nbsp;\u00b0C for a few days.\n\n[[File:Lago Buenos Aires Department, Santa Cruz Province, Argentina - panoramio (37).jpg|thumb|Santa Cruz Province]]\nDirectly east of these areas, the weather becomes much harsher; precipitation drops to between 150 and 300&nbsp;mm, the mountains no longer protect the cities from the wind, and temperatures become more extreme. Maquinchao is a few hundred kilometers east of Bariloche, at the same altitude on a plateau, and summer daytime temperatures are usually about 5&nbsp;\u00b0C warmer, rising up to 35&nbsp;\u00b0C sometimes, but winter temperatures are much more extreme: the record is \u221235&nbsp;\u00b0C, and some nights not uncommonly reach 10&nbsp;\u00b0C colder than Bariloche. The plateaus in Santa Cruz province and parts of Chubut usually have snow cover through the winter, and often experience very cold temperatures. In Chile, the city of Balmaceda is known for being situated in this region (which is otherwise almost exclusively in Argentina), and for being the coldest place in Chile, with temperatures below \u221220&nbsp;\u00b0C every once in a while.\n\nThe northern Atlantic coast has warm summers (28 to 32&nbsp;\u00b0C, but with relatively cool nights at 15&nbsp;\u00b0C) and mild winters, with highs around 12&nbsp;\u00b0C and lows about 2\u20133&nbsp;\u00b0C. Occasionally, temperatures reach \u221210 or 40&nbsp;\u00b0C, and rainfall is very scarce. The weather only gets a bit colder further south in Chubut, and the city of Comodoro Rivadavia has summer temperatures of 24 to 28&nbsp;\u00b0C, nights of 12 to 16&nbsp;\u00b0C, and winters with days around 10&nbsp;\u00b0C and nights around 3&nbsp;\u00b0C, and less than 250&nbsp;mm of rain. However, a drastic drop occurs as one moves south to Santa Cruz; Rio Gallegos, in the south of the province, has summer temps of 17 to 21&nbsp;\u00b0C, (nights between 6 and 10&nbsp;\u00b0C) and winter temperatures of 2 to 6&nbsp;\u00b0C, with nights between \u22125 and 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, despite being right on the coast. Snowfall is common despite the dryness, and temperatures are known to fall to under \u221218&nbsp;\u00b0C and to remain below freezing for several days in a row. Rio Gallegos is also among the windiest places on Earth, with winds reaching 100&nbsp;km/h occasionally.\n\nTierra del Fuego is extremely wet in the west, relatively damp in the south, and dry in the north and east. Summers are cool (13 to 18&nbsp;\u00b0C in the north, 12 to 16&nbsp;\u00b0C in the south, with nights generally between 3 and 8&nbsp;\u00b0C), cloudy in the south, and very windy. Winters are dark and cold, but without the extreme temperatures in the south and west ([[Ushuaia]] rarely reaches \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C, but hovers around 0&nbsp;\u00b0C for several months, and snow can be heavy). In the east and north, winters are much more severe, with cold snaps bringing temperatures down to \u221220&nbsp;\u00b0C all the way to Rio Grande on the Atlantic coast. Snow can fall even in the summer in most areas, as well.\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Black-browed Albatross, Beagle Channel.jpg|thumb|[[Black-browed albatross]], near Ushuaia]]\n\nThe [[guanaco]] (''Lama guanicoe''), [[cougar]], the [[South American gray fox|Patagonian fox]] (''Lycalopex griseus''), [[Humboldt's hog-nosed skunk|Patagonian hog-nosed skunk]] (''Conepatus humboldtii''), and [[Magellanic tuco-tuco]] (''Ctenomys magellanicus''; a subterranean [[rodent]]) are the most characteristic mammals of the Patagonian plains.

''[[Bolas]]'' are commonly found and were used to catch guanaco and rhea.<ref name=\"Princeton\"/> A maritime tradition existed along the Pacific coast, whose latest exponents were the [[Yaghan]] (Y\u00e1mana) to the south of Tierra del Fuego, the [[Alacalufe|Kaweshqar]] between [[Taitao Peninsula]] and Tierra del Fuego, and the [[Chono people]] in the [[Chonos Archipelago]].\n\nThe [[indigenous peoples]] of the region included the [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelche]]s, whose numbers and society were reduced to near extinction not long after the first contacts with Europeans. Tehuelches included the [[Gununa'kena]] to the north, [[Mecharnuekenk]] in south central Patagonia, and the [[Tehuelche people|Aonikenk]] or Southern Tehuelche in the far south, north of the Magellan strait. On [[Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego]], the [[Selk'nam]] (Ona) and [[Haush]] (Manek'enk) lived in the north and southeast, respectively.

These groups were encountered in the first periods of European contact with different lifestyles, body decoration and language, although it is unclear when this configuration emerged.\n\nTowards the end of the 16th century, [[Mapuche]]-speaking agriculturalists penetrated the western Andes and from there across into the eastern plains and down to the far south. Through confrontation and technological ability, they came to dominate the other peoples of the region in a short period of time, and are the principal indigenous community today.<ref name=\"Princeton\"/> The Mapuche model of domination through technological superiority and armed confrontation was later repeated as Europeans implemented a succeeding, but conceptually identical cycle, essentially replacing the position of the former dominators with a new, albeit predominately European class.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Early European exploration (1520\u20131669)===\n[[File:NaoVictoria.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Victoria (ship)|''Nao Victoria'']], the replica of [[Museo Nao Victoria|the first ship]] to pass through the [[Strait of Magellan]]]]\n\nThis territory became the Spanish colony of the Governorate of New L\u00e9on, granted in 1529 to Governor [[Sim\u00f3n de Alcazaba y Sotomayor]], part of the [[Governorates of the Spanish Empire]] of the Americas, and redefined territory in 1534, it consisted of the southernmost part of the continent covering the southern tip of the Americas and the islands towards Antarctica.\n\nNavigators such as [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] and [[Amerigo Vespucci]] possibly had reached the area (his own account of 1502 has it that they reached the latitude 52\u00b0S), but Vespucci's failure to accurately describe the main geographical features of the region such as the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] casts doubts on whether they really did so.\n\nThe first or more detailed description of part of the coastline of Patagonia is possibly mentioned in a Portuguese voyage in 1511\u20131512, traditionally attributed to captain Diogo Ribeiro, who after his death was replaced by Estev\u00e3o de Frois, and was guided by the pilot and [[Cosmography|cosmographer]] [[Jo\u00e3o de Lisboa]]).

If the men under his charge had not mutinied, he might have crossed the [[Andes]] to reach the Pacific coast.\n\n[[Pedro de Mendoza]], on whom the country was next bestowed, founded [[Buenos Aires]], but did not venture south. [[Alonzo de Camargo]] (1539), [[Juan Ladrilleros]] (1557), and [[Hurtado de Mendoza]] (1558) helped to make known the Pacific coasts, and while [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]]'s voyage in 1577 down the Atlantic coast, through the [[Strait of Magellan]] and northward along the Pacific coast was memorable, yet the descriptions of the geography of Patagonia owe much more to the Spanish explorer [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa]] (1579\u20131580), who, devoting himself especially to the south-west region, made careful and accurate surveys. The settlements that he founded at [[Nombre de Jes\u00fas (Patagonia)|Nombre de Jes\u00fas]] and San Felipe were neglected by the Spanish government, the latter being abandoned before [[Thomas Cavendish]] visited it in 1587, and so desolate that he called it [[Puerto del Hambre|Port Famine]]. After the discovery of the route around Cape Horn, the Spanish Crown lost interest in southern Patagonia until the 18th century, when the coastal settlements Carmen de Patagones, San Jos\u00e9, Puerto Deseado, and Nueva Colonia Floridablanca were established, although it maintained its claim of a ''[[de jure]]'' sovereignty over area.\n\nIn 1669, the district around [[Puerto Deseado]] was explored by [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]] and was claimed in 1670 by Sir [[John Narborough]] for King [[Charles II of England]], but the English made no attempt to establish settlements or explore the interior.\n\n====Patagonian giants: early European perceptions====\n{{main|Patagon}}\nThe first European explorers of Patagonia observed that the indigenous people in the region were taller than the average Europeans of the time, prompting some of them to believe that Patagonians were giants.\n\nAccording to Antonio Pigafetta,<ref name=\"Pigafetta\"/> one of the Magellan expedition's few survivors and its published chronicler, Magellan bestowed the name ''Patag\u00e3o'' (or ''Patag\u00f3n'') on the inhabitants they encountered there, and the name \"Patagonia\" for the region. Although Pigafetta's account does not describe how this name came about, subsequent popular interpretations gave credence to a derivation meaning \"land of the big feet\". However, this [[etymology]] is questionable. The term is most likely derived from an actual character name, \"Patag\u00f3n\", a savage creature confronted by Primale\u00f3n of Greece, the hero in the homonymous Spanish chivalry novel (or [[Knight-errant|knight-errantry tale]]) by Francisco V\u00e1zquez.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Growth and Development |editor1-first=Stanley J. |editor1-last=Ulijaszek |editor2-first=Francis E. |editor2-last=Johnston |editor3-first=M.

Novelist and travel writer [[Bruce Chatwin]] suggests etymological roots of both Patagon and Patagonia in his book, ''[[In Patagonia]]'',<ref>Chatwin, Bruce. ''In Patagonia'' (1977). ch. 49</ref> noting the similarity between \"Patagon\" and the [[Greek language|Greek]] word \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} which means \"a roaring\" or \"gnashing of teeth\" (in his chronicle, Pigafetta describes the Patagonians as \"roaring like bulls\").\n\n[[File:Urville-Patagonians2.jpg|thumb|An 1840s illustration of indigenous Patagonians from near the [[Straits of Magellan]], from ''Voyage au pole sud et dans l'Oc\u00e9anie'' by French explorer [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]]]]\nThe main interest in the region sparked by Pigafetta's account came from his reports of their meeting with the local inhabitants, whom they claimed to measure some 9 to 12 feet in height \u2013 \"so tall that we reached only to his waist\" \u2013 hence the later idea that Patagonia meant \"big feet\". This supposed race of Patagonian giants or [[Patagon]]es entered into the common European perception of this then little-known and distant area, to be further fueled by subsequent reports of other expeditions and famous travelers such as Sir Francis Drake, which seemed to confirm these accounts. Early charts of the [[New World]] sometimes added the legend ''regio gigantum'' (\"region of the giants\") to the Patagonian area. By 1611, the Patagonian god Setebos (Settaboth in Pigafetta) was familiar to the hearers of ''The Tempest''.\n\nThe concept and general belief persisted for a further 250 years, and was to be sensationally reignited in 1767 when an \"official\" (but anonymous) account was published of [[Commodore (RN)|Commodore]] [[John Byron]]'s recent voyage of global [[circumnavigation]] in [[HMS Dolphin (1751)|HMS ''Dolphin'']]. Byron and crew had spent some time along the coast, and the publication (''Voyage Round the World in His Majesty's Ship the Dolphin'') seemed to give proof positive of their existence; the publication became an overnight bestseller, thousands of extra copies were to be sold to a willing public, and other prior accounts of the region were hastily republished (even those in which giant-like folk were not mentioned at all).\n\nHowever, the Patagonian giant frenzy died down substantially only a few years later, when some more sober and analytical accounts were published. In 1773, [[John Hawkesworth (book editor)|John Hawkesworth]] published on behalf of the [[Admiralty]] a compendium of noted English southern-hemisphere explorers' journals, including that of [[James Cook]] and John Byron. In this publication, drawn from their official logs, the people Byron's expedition had encountered clearly were no taller than {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m|adj=on}}, very tall but by no means giants. Interest soon subsided, although awareness of and belief in the concept persisted in some quarters even into the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web| author=Carolyne Ryan| title=European Travel Writings and the Patagonian giants| work=Lawrence University| url=http://www.lawrence.edu/news/pubs/lt/fall04/giants.shtml| accessdate=24 October 2013| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120805051711/http://www.lawrence.edu/news/pubs/lt/fall04/giants.shtml| archivedate=5 August 2012| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Spanish outposts===\nThe Spanish failure at colonizing the Strait of Magellan made [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago]] assume the role of protecting the area of western Patagonia from foreign intrusions.<ref name=Urbina2013>{{cite journal |last=Urbina C. |first=M.

[[Thomas Falkner]], a Jesuit who resided near forty years in those parts, published his ''Description of Patagonia'' (Hereford, 1774); [[Francisco Viedma]] founded ''El Carmen'', nowadays [[Carmen de Patagones]] and Antonio settled the area of [[San Julian Bay]], where he founded the colony of [[Floridablanca (Patagonia)|Floridablanca]] and advanced inland to the Andes (1782). [[Basilio Villarino]] ascended the Rio Negro (1782).\n[[File:MORENO(1879) p131 UNA FIESTA EN CALEUFU.JPG|thumb|[[Tehuelche people|Tehuelche]] warriors in Patagonia]]\n\nTwo [[hydrography|hydrographic]] surveys of the coasts were of first-rate importance; the first expedition (1826\u20131830) included [[HMS Aid (1809)|HMS ''Adventure'']] and [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']] under [[Phillip Parker King]], and the second (1832\u20131836) was the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|voyage of the ''Beagle'']] under [[Robert FitzRoy]]. The latter expedition is particularly noted for the participation of [[Charles Darwin]], who spent considerable time investigating various areas of Patagonia onshore, including long rides with [[gaucho]]s in [[R\u00edo Negro (Argentina)|R\u00edo Negro]], and who joined FitzRoy in a {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=on}} expedition taking ships' boats up the course of the [[Santa Cruz River (Argentina)|Santa Cruz River]].\n\n===Chilean and Argentine colonization (1843\u20131902)===\nIn the early 19th century, the [[Araucanization of Patagonia|araucanization]] of the natives of northern Patagonia intensified, and many [[Mapuche]]s migrated to Patagonia to live as nomads that raised cattle or pillaged the Argentine countryside. The cattle stolen in the incursions (''[[Mal\u00f3n|malones]]'') were later taken to Chile through the mountain passes and traded for goods, especially alcoholic beverages. The main trail for this trade was called [[Camino de los chilenos]] and runs a length around 1000&nbsp;km from the [[Buenos Aires Province]] to the [[mountain pass]]es of [[Neuqu\u00e9n Province]]. The ''[[lonco]]'' [[Calfucur\u00e1]] crossed the [[Andes]] from Chile to the pampas around 1830, after a call from the governor of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], to fight the [[Boroano people]]. In 1859, he attacked [[Bah\u00eda Blanca]] in Argentina with 3,000 warriors. As in the case of Calfucura, many other bands of Mapuches got involved in the internal conflicts of Argentina until [[Conquest of the Desert]]. To counter the cattle raids, a trench called the [[Zanja de Alsina]] was built by Argentina in the pampas in the 1870s.\n\n[[File:Mapa ARGENTINA frontera.png|thumb|210px|Map of the advance of the Argentina frontier until the establishment of [[zanja de Alsina]]]]\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the newly independent nations of Argentina and Chile began an aggressive phase of expansion into the south, increasing confrontation with the Indians of the region. In 1860, French adventurer [[Orelie-Antoine de Tounens]] proclaimed himself king of the [[Kingdom of Araucan\u00eda and Patagonia]] of the [[Mapuche]].\n\nFollowing the last instructions of [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], the Chilean president [[Manuel Bulnes]] sent an expedition to the Strait of Magellan and founded [[Fuerte Bulnes]] in 1843. Five years later, the Chilean government moved the main settlement to the current location of [[Punta Arenas, Chile|Punta Arenas]], the oldest permanent settlement in Southern Patagonia. The creation of Punta Arenas was instrumental in making Chile's claim of the Strait of Magellan permanent. In the 1860s, sheep from the [[Falkland Islands]] were introduced to the lands around the Straits of Magellan, and throughout the 19th century, sheepfarming grew to be the most important economic sector in southern Patagonia.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[George Chaworth Musters]] in 1869 wandered in company with a band of Tehuelches through the whole length of the country from the strait to the Manzaneros in the northwest, and collected a great deal of information about the people and their mode of life.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=19679|first=John|last=Dickenson|title=Musters, George Chaworth}}</ref>\n\n====Conquest of the desert and the 1881 treaty====\n{{Main|Conquest of the Desert|Boundary Treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina}}\n[[File:Mapa ARGENTINA 1881.png|thumb|170px|left|Under General [[Julio Argentino Roca|Roca]], the [[Conquest of the Desert]] extended Argentine power into Patagonia]]\nArgentine authorities worried that the strong connections araucanized tribes had with Chile would allegedly give Chile certain influence over the pampas.<ref name=\"cite journal|jstor=981291\">{{cite journal|jstor=981291 | volume=36 | issue=3 | pages=347\u2013363|title=Argentina and Chile: The Struggle For Patagonia 1843\u20131881| journal=The Americas | last1=Perry | first1=Richard O. | year=1980 | doi=10.2307/981291 }}</ref> Argentine authorities feared an eventual war with Chile over Patagonia, where the natives would side with the Chileans and that it would therefore be fought in the vicinities of Buenos Aires.<ref name=\"cite journal|jstor=981291\"/>\n \nThe decision of planning and executing the Conquest of the Desert was probably triggered by the 1872 attack of [[Cufulcur\u00e1]] and his 6,000 followers on the cities of [[General Alvear, Mendoza|General Alvear]], [[Veinticinco de Mayo, Buenos Aires|Veinticinco de Mayo]], and [[Nueve de Julio, Buenos Aires Province|Nueve de Julio]], where 300 ''[[Creole peoples|criollos]]'' were killed, and 200,000 heads of cattle taken.\n\nIn the 1870s, the Conquest of the Desert was a controversial campaign by the Argentine government, executed mainly by [[General Julio Argentino Roca]], to subdue or, some claim, to exterminate the native peoples of the south.\n\nIn 1885, a mining expeditionary party under the [[Romania]]n adventurer [[Julius Popper]] landed in southern Patagonia in search of gold, which they found after traveling southwards towards the lands of Tierra del Fuego. This led to the further opening up of the area to prospectors. European missionaries and settlers arrived throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, notably the [[Y Wladfa|Welsh settlement]] of the [[Chubut Valley]].

As [[manual labor]], their social status was below that of the'' [[gaucho]]s'' and the Argentine, Chilean, and European landowners and administrators.\n\nBefore and after 1902, when the boundaries were drawn, many Chilotes were expelled from the Argentine side due to fear of what having a large Chilean population in Argentina could lead into in the future. These workers founded the first inland Chilean settlement in what is now the [[Ays\u00e9n Region]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turistel.cl/v2/secciones/destinos/ciudad_pueblo/sur/undecima/coihaique.htm |title=Coihaique \u2013 Ciudades y Pueblos del sur de Chile |publisher=Turistel.cl |accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=Fuego>Luis Otero, La Huella del Fuego: Historia de los bosques y cambios en el paisaje del sur de Chile (Valdivia, Editorial Pehuen)</ref> [[Balmaceda, Chile|Balmaceda]].

Railways were planned to cover continental Argentine Patagonia to serve the oil, mining, agricultural, and energy industries, and a line was built connecting [[San Carlos de Bariloche]] to Buenos Aires. Portions of other lines were built to the south, but the only lines still in use are [[La Trochita]] in [[Esquel]], the [[Train of the End of the World]] in Ushuaia, both [[heritage line]]s,<ref>[http://www.latrochita.org.ar/TrochiIngles/historia.htm History of the Old Patagonian Express], La Trochita, accessed 2006-08-11</ref>\nand a short run Tren Hist\u00f3rico de [[San Carlos de Bariloche|Bariloche]] to Perito Moreno.\n\nIn the western forest-covered Patagonian Andes and archipelagoes, [[wood logging]] has historically been an important part of the economy; it impelled the colonization of the areas of the [[Nahuel Huapi Lake|Nahuel Huapi]] and [[L\u00e1car Lake|L\u00e1car]] lakes in Argentina and [[Guaitecas Archipelago]] in Chile.\n\n===Livestock===\n{{see also|Patagonian sheep farming boom}}\n[[File:Mustering sheep in Patagonia.jpg|thumb|''Gauchos'' mustering sheep in Patagonia]]\n\nSheep farming introduced in the late 19th century has been a principal economic activity. After reaching its heights during the First World War, the decline in world wool prices affected sheep farming in Argentina. Nowadays, about half of Argentina's 15 million sheep are in Patagonia, a percentage that is growing as sheep farming disappears in the pampas to the north. Chubut (mainly [[Merino]]) is the top wool producer with Santa Cruz (Corriedale and some Merino) second. Sheep farming revived in 2002 with the devaluation of the peso and firmer global demand for wool (led by China and the EU). Still, little investment occurs in new abattoirs (mainly in Comodoro Rivadavia, Trelew, and Rio Gallegos), and often [[Phytosanitary certification|phytosanitary]] restrictions reduce the export of sheep meat. Extensive valleys in the [[Cordilleran range]] have provided sufficient grazing lands, and the low humidity and weather of the southern region make raising Merino and Corriedale sheep common.\n\nLivestock also includes small numbers of cattle, and in lesser numbers, pigs and horses. Sheep farming provides a small but important number of jobs for rural areas with little other employment.\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Ballenas en Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e8s.jpg|thumb|Whale watching off the [[Valdes Peninsula]]]]\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, tourism became an ever more important part of Patagonia's economy. Originally a remote backpacking destination, the region has attracted increasing numbers of upmarket visitors, cruise passengers rounding [[Cape Horn]] or visiting Antarctica, and adventure and activity holiday-makers. Principal tourist attractions include the [[Perito Moreno glacier]], the [[Vald\u00e9s Peninsula]], the [[Argentine Lake District]] and Ushuaia and Tierra del Fuego (the city is also a jumping-off place for travel to Antarctica, bringing in still more visitors). Tourism has created new markets locally and for export for traditional crafts such as Mapuche handicrafts, guanaco textiles, and confectionery and preserves.<ref name=\"time out\"/>\n\nA spin-off from increased tourism has been the buying of often enormous tracts of land by foreigners, often as a prestige purchase rather than for agriculture. Buyers have included [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Ted Turner]], and [[Christopher Lambert]], and most notably [[Luciano Benetton]], Patagonia's largest landowner.<ref name=\"time out\"/> His \"Compa\u00f1ia de Tierras Sud\" has brought new techniques to the ailing sheep-rearing industry and sponsored museums and community facilities, but has been controversial particularly for its treatment of local Mapuche communities.<ref>[http://www.mapuche-nation.org/english/main/benetton/main/info.htm 'The Invisible Colors of Benetton'], [[Mapuche International Link]], accessed 2006-08-11</ref>\n\n===Energy===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}\n<br />\n\n[[File:LaTrochita12EnNahuelPanFormacionEstacionada.jpg|thumb|''[[La Trochita]]'' on its [[Chubut Province]] route: Formerly the sole rapid transport means in the province, ''La Trochita'' is now a tourist attraction.]]\nDue to its sparse rainfall in agricultural areas, Argentine Patagonia already has numerous dams for irrigation, some of which are also used for hydropower. The [[Limay River]] is used to generate hydroelectricity at five dams built on its course: [[Alicur\u00e1 Dam|Alicur\u00e1]], [[Piedra del \u00c1guila Dam|Piedra del \u00c1guila]], [[Pichi Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa Dam|Pichi Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa]], [[El Choc\u00f3n Dam|El Choc\u00f3n]], and [[Arroyito Dam|Arroyito]]. Together with the [[Cerros Colorados Complex]] on the [[Neuqu\u00e9n River]], they contribute ore than one-quarter of the total hydroelectric generation in the country. Coal is mined in the [[Rio Turbio]] area and used for electricity generation. Patagonia's notorious winds have already made the area Argentina's main source of wind power, and plans have been made for major increases in wind power generation.\nPatagonia has always been Argentina's main area, and Chile's only area, of conventional oil and gas production. Oil and gas have played an important role in the rise of Neuqu\u00e9n-Cipolleti as Patagonia's most populous urban area, and in the growth of [[Comodoro Rivadavia]], Punta Arenas, and Rio Grande, as well. The development of the Neuqu\u00e9n basin's enormous [[unconventional oil]] and gas reserves through hydraulic fracturing has just begun, but the [[YPF]]-[[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] Loma Campana field in the Vaca Muerta formation is already the world's largest producing shale oil field outside North America according to former YPF CEO Miguel Gallucio.\n\n==Cuisine==\nArgentine Patagonian cuisine is largely the same as the cuisine of Buenos Aires \u2013 grilled meats and pasta \u2013 with extensive{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} use of local ingredients and less use of those products that have to be imported into the region. Lamb is considered the traditional Patagonian meat, grilled for several hours over an open fire. Some guide books have reported that game, especially guanaco and introduced deer and boar, are popular in restaurant cuisine. However, since the guanaco is a protected animal in both Chile and Argentina, it is unlikely to appear commonly as restaurant fare. Trout and ''[[centolla]]'' ([[king crab]]) are also common, though overfishing of ''centolla'' has made it increasingly scarce. In the area around Bariloche, a noted [[Alpine cuisine]] tradition remains, with chocolate bars and even [[fondue]] restaurants, and [[tea room]]s are a feature of the [[Welsh_people|Welsh]] communities in [[Gaiman, Chubut|Gaiman]] and [[Trevelin]], as well as in the mountains.<ref name=\"time out\"/> Since the mid-1990s, some success with winemaking has occurred in Argentine Patagonia, especially in Neuqu\u00e9n.\n\n==Foreign land buyers issue==\nForeign investors, including Italian multinational [[Benetton Group]], [[Ted Turner]], Joseph Lewis<ref name=\"patagonia-argentina.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.patagonia-argentina.com/i/content/accesoalagosyrios.php |title=''Rivers of blood''from Patagonia-argentina.com}}</ref> and the environmentalist [[Douglas Tompkins]], own major land areas.

In a small portion of northwestern Patagonia indigenous peoples practised agriculture while in the remaining territory peoples lived as hunter-gatherers travelling by foot in eastern Patagonia or by canoe in the [[fjords and channels of Chile|fjords and channels]]. While the interest of the [[Spanish Empire]] had been chiefly to keep other European powers away from Patagonia, once independent Chile and Argentina begun to slowly colonise the territory over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries. This process brought a decline of the indigenous populations while at the same time thousands of Europeans, Argentines, [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago|Chilotes]] and mainland Chileans settled in Patagonia. Border disputes between Argentina and Chile were recurrent in the 20th century. Nearly all of these disputes have been settled today. \n\nThe contemporary economy of Patagonia revolves around sheep farming and oil and gas extraction are important activities for the eastern part while in western Patagonia [[fishing in Chile|fishing]], [[aquaculture in Chile|salmon aquaculture]] and tourism dominates. Culturally Patagonia has a varied heritage including [[Criollo people|Criollo]], [[Mestizo]], [[Indigenous peoples of South America|Indigenous]] and non-Iberian European influences.     \n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Patagonia comes from the word ''[[patagon|patag\u00f3n]]'',<ref name=\"Pigafetta\">[[Antonio Pigafetta]], ''[[:wikisource:it:Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo|Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo]]'', 1524: \"Il capitano generale nomin\u00f2 questi popoli Patagoni.\" [https://archive.org/stream/firstthreeenglis00arberich#page/252/mode/1up/search/Patagoni A Brief Declaration of the Vyage abowte the Worlde by Antonie Pygafetta Vincentine, Rycharde Eden, ''The Decades of the Newe Worlde or West India,'' London, William Powell, 1555.] The original word would probably be in [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]'s native Portuguese (''patag\u00e3o'') or the Spanish of his men (''patag\u00f3n''). It has been interpreted later as \"big foot\", but the etymology refers to a literary character in a Spanish novel of the early 16th century: \"''Patagon'', said to be engendred by a beast in the woods, being the strangest, most misshapen and counterfeite creature in the world. He hath good understanding, is amorous of women, and keepeth company with one of whom, it is said, he was engendred. He hath the face of a Dogge, great eares, which hang down upon his shoulders, his teeth sharp and big, standing out of his mouth very much: his feet are like a Harts, and he runneth wondrous lightly.

Both countries have organized their Patagonian territories into nonequivalent administrative subdivisions - [[Provinces of Argentina|provinces]] and [[Departments of Argentina|departments]] in Argentina, and [[Regions of Chile|regions]], [[Provinces of Chile|provinces]], and [[Communes of Chile|communes]] in Chile. As Chile is a [[unitary state]], its first-level administrative divisions\u2014the regions\u2014enjoy far less autonomy than analogous Argentine provinces. Argentine provinces have elected governors and legislatures, while Chilean regions have government-appointed intendants.\n\nThe Patagonian Provinces of Argentina are [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]], [[Neuqu\u00e9n Province|Neuqu\u00e9n]], [[R\u00edo Negro Province|R\u00edo Negro]], [[Chubut Province|Chubut]], [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz]], and [[Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina|Tierra del Fuego]]. The southernmost part of [[Buenos Aires Province]] can also be considered part of Patagonia.\n\nThe two Chilean regions indisputedly located entirely within Patagonia are [[Ays\u00e9n Region|Ays\u00e9n]] and [[Magallanes Region|Magallanes]]. [[Palena Province]], a part of the [[Los Lagos Region]], is also located within Patagonia. By some definitions, Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago, the rest of the Los Lagos Region, and part of the Los R\u00edos Region are also part of Patagonia.\n\n==Climate==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2011}}\n{{See also|Climate of Argentina|Climatic regions of Argentina|Climate of Chile}}\n[[File:Punta Arenas con nieve.jpeg|thumb|left|View of Punta Arenas, Chile, in winter]]\nThe overall climate is cool and dry. The east coast is warmer than the west, especially in summer, as a branch of the southern equatorial current reaches its shores, whereas the west coast is washed by a cold current. However, winters are colder on the inland plateaus east of the slopes and further down the coast on the southeast end of the Patagonian region. For example, at [[Puerto Montt]], on the inlet behind Chilo\u00e9 Island, the mean annual temperature is {{convert|11|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and the average extremes are {{convert|25.5|and|-1.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, whereas at [[Bah\u00eda Blanca]] near the Atlantic coast and just outside the northern confines of Patagonia, the annual temperature is {{convert|15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and the range much greater, as temperatures above 35&nbsp;\u00b0C and below \u22125&nbsp;\u00b0C are recorded every year. At Punta Arenas, in the extreme south, the mean temperature is {{convert|6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and the average extremes are {{convert|24.5|and|-2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The prevailing winds are westerly, and the westward slope has a much heavier precipitation than the eastern in a [[rainshadow]] effect;<ref name=\"Princeton\"/> the western islands close to [[Torres del Paine]] receive an annual precipitation of 4,000 to 7,000&nbsp;mm, whilst the eastern hills are less than 800&nbsp;mm and the plains may be as low as 200&nbsp;mm annual precipitation.<ref name=\"Princeton\"/>\n\nPrecipitation is highly seasonal in northwestern Patagonia. For example, Villa La Angostura in Argentina, close to the border with Chile, receives up to 434&nbsp;mm of rain and snow in May, 297&nbsp;mm in June, and 273 in July, compared to 80 in February and 72 in March. The total for the city is 2074&nbsp;mm, making it one of the rainiest in Argentina. Further west, some areas receive up to 4,000&nbsp;mm and more, especially on the Chilean side. In the northeast, the seasons for rain are reversed; most rain falls from occasional summer thunderstorms, but totals barely reach 500&nbsp;mm in the northeast corner, and rapidly decrease to less than 300&nbsp;mm. The Patagonian west coast, which belongs exclusively to Chile, has a cool oceanic climate, with summer maximum temperatures ranging from 14&nbsp;\u00b0C in the south to 19&nbsp;\u00b0C in the north (and nights between 5 and 11&nbsp;\u00b0C) and very high precipitation, from 2,000 to more than 7,000&nbsp;mm in local microclimates. Snow is uncommon at the coast in the north, but happens more often in the south, and frost is usually not very intense.\n\nImmediately east from the coast are the Andes, cut by deep fjords in the south and by deep lakes in the north, and with varying temperatures according to the altitude. The tree line ranges from close to 2,000 m on the northern side (except for the Andes in northern Neuqu\u00e9n in Argentina, where sunnier and dryer conditions allow trees to grow up to close to 3,000 m), and diminishes southward to only 600\u2013800 m in Tierra del Fuego. Precipitation changes dramatically from one spot to the other, and diminishes very quickly eastward. An example of this is Laguna Fr\u00edas, in Argentina, receives 4,400&nbsp;mm yearly. The city of Bariloche, about 40&nbsp;km further east, receives about 1,000&nbsp;mm, and the airport, another 15&nbsp;km east, receives less than 600&nbsp;mm. The easterly slopes of the Andes are home to several Argentine cities: San Mart\u00edn de los Andes, Bariloche, El Bols\u00f3n, Esquel, and El Calafate. Temperatures there are milder in the summer (in the north, between 20 and 24&nbsp;\u00b0C, with cold nights between 4 and 9&nbsp;\u00b0C; in the south, summers are between 16 and 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, at night temperatures are similar to the north) and much colder in the winter, with frequent snowfall (although snow cover rarely lasts very long). Daytime highs range from 3 to 9&nbsp;\u00b0C in the north, and from 0 to 7&nbsp;\u00b0C in the south, whereas nights range from \u22125 to 2&nbsp;\u00b0C everywhere. Cold waves can bring much colder values; a temperature of -21&nbsp;\u00b0C has been recorded in Bariloche, and most places can often have temperatures between \u221212 and \u221215&nbsp;\u00b0C and highs staying around 0&nbsp;\u00b0C for a few days.\n\n[[File:Lago Buenos Aires Department, Santa Cruz Province, Argentina - panoramio (37).jpg|thumb|Santa Cruz Province]]\nDirectly east of these areas, the weather becomes much harsher; precipitation drops to between 150 and 300&nbsp;mm, the mountains no longer protect the cities from the wind, and temperatures become more extreme. Maquinchao is a few hundred kilometers east of Bariloche, at the same altitude on a plateau, and summer daytime temperatures are usually about 5&nbsp;\u00b0C warmer, rising up to 35&nbsp;\u00b0C sometimes, but winter temperatures are much more extreme: the record is \u221235&nbsp;\u00b0C, and some nights not uncommonly reach 10&nbsp;\u00b0C colder than Bariloche. The plateaus in Santa Cruz province and parts of Chubut usually have snow cover through the winter, and often experience very cold temperatures. In Chile, the city of Balmaceda is known for being situated in this region (which is otherwise almost exclusively in Argentina), and for being the coldest place in Chile, with temperatures below \u221220&nbsp;\u00b0C every once in a while.\n\nThe northern Atlantic coast has warm summers (28 to 32&nbsp;\u00b0C, but with relatively cool nights at 15&nbsp;\u00b0C) and mild winters, with highs around 12&nbsp;\u00b0C and lows about 2\u20133&nbsp;\u00b0C. Occasionally, temperatures reach \u221210 or 40&nbsp;\u00b0C, and rainfall is very scarce. The weather only gets a bit colder further south in Chubut, and the city of Comodoro Rivadavia has summer temperatures of 24 to 28&nbsp;\u00b0C, nights of 12 to 16&nbsp;\u00b0C, and winters with days around 10&nbsp;\u00b0C and nights around 3&nbsp;\u00b0C, and less than 250&nbsp;mm of rain. However, a drastic drop occurs as one moves south to Santa Cruz; Rio Gallegos, in the south of the province, has summer temps of 17 to 21&nbsp;\u00b0C, (nights between 6 and 10&nbsp;\u00b0C) and winter temperatures of 2 to 6&nbsp;\u00b0C, with nights between \u22125 and 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, despite being right on the coast. Snowfall is common despite the dryness, and temperatures are known to fall to under \u221218&nbsp;\u00b0C and to remain below freezing for several days in a row. Rio Gallegos is also among the windiest places on Earth, with winds reaching 100&nbsp;km/h occasionally.\n\nTierra del Fuego is extremely wet in the west, relatively damp in the south, and dry in the north and east. Summers are cool (13 to 18&nbsp;\u00b0C in the north, 12 to 16&nbsp;\u00b0C in the south, with nights generally between 3 and 8&nbsp;\u00b0C), cloudy in the south, and very windy. Winters are dark and cold, but without the extreme temperatures in the south and west ([[Ushuaia]] rarely reaches \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C, but hovers around 0&nbsp;\u00b0C for several months, and snow can be heavy). In the east and north, winters are much more severe, with cold snaps bringing temperatures down to \u221220&nbsp;\u00b0C all the way to Rio Grande on the Atlantic coast. Snow can fall even in the summer in most areas, as well.\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Black-browed Albatross, Beagle Channel.jpg|thumb|[[Black-browed albatross]], near Ushuaia]]\n\nThe [[guanaco]] (''Lama guanicoe''), [[cougar]], the [[South American gray fox|Patagonian fox]] (''Lycalopex griseus''), [[Humboldt's hog-nosed skunk|Patagonian hog-nosed skunk]] (''Conepatus humboldtii''), and [[Magellanic tuco-tuco]] (''Ctenomys magellanicus''; a subterranean [[rodent]]) are the most characteristic mammals of the Patagonian plains.

Tehuelches included the [[Gununa'kena]] to the north, [[Mecharnuekenk]] in south central Patagonia, and the [[Tehuelche people|Aonikenk]] or Southern Tehuelche in the far south, north of the Magellan strait. On [[Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego]], the [[Selk'nam]] (Ona) and [[Haush]] (Manek'enk) lived in the north and southeast, respectively.

These groups were encountered in the first periods of European contact with different lifestyles, body decoration and language, although it is unclear when this configuration emerged.\n\nTowards the end of the 16th century, [[Mapuche]]-speaking agriculturalists penetrated the western Andes and from there across into the eastern plains and down to the far south. Through confrontation and technological ability, they came to dominate the other peoples of the region in a short period of time, and are the principal indigenous community today.<ref name=\"Princeton\"/> The Mapuche model of domination through technological superiority and armed confrontation was later repeated as Europeans implemented a succeeding, but conceptually identical cycle, essentially replacing the position of the former dominators with a new, albeit predominately European class.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Early European exploration (1520\u20131669)===\n[[File:NaoVictoria.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Victoria (ship)|''Nao Victoria'']], the replica of [[Museo Nao Victoria|the first ship]] to pass through the [[Strait of Magellan]]]]\n\nThis territory became the Spanish colony of the Governorate of New L\u00e9on, granted in 1529 to Governor [[Sim\u00f3n de Alcazaba y Sotomayor]], part of the [[Governorates of the Spanish Empire]] of the Americas, and redefined territory in 1534, it consisted of the southernmost part of the continent covering the southern tip of the Americas and the islands towards Antarctica.\n\nNavigators such as [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] and [[Amerigo Vespucci]] possibly had reached the area (his own account of 1502 has it that they reached the latitude 52\u00b0S), but Vespucci's failure to accurately describe the main geographical features of the region such as the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] casts doubts on whether they really did so.\n\nThe first or more detailed description of part of the coastline of Patagonia is possibly mentioned in a Portuguese voyage in 1511\u20131512, traditionally attributed to captain Diogo Ribeiro, who after his death was replaced by Estev\u00e3o de Frois, and was guided by the pilot and [[Cosmography|cosmographer]] [[Jo\u00e3o de Lisboa]]).

The settlements that he founded at [[Nombre de Jes\u00fas (Patagonia)|Nombre de Jes\u00fas]] and San Felipe were neglected by the Spanish government, the latter being abandoned before [[Thomas Cavendish]] visited it in 1587, and so desolate that he called it [[Puerto del Hambre|Port Famine]]. After the discovery of the route around Cape Horn, the Spanish Crown lost interest in southern Patagonia until the 18th century, when the coastal settlements Carmen de Patagones, San Jos\u00e9, Puerto Deseado, and Nueva Colonia Floridablanca were established, although it maintained its claim of a ''[[de jure]]'' sovereignty over area.\n\nIn 1669, the district around [[Puerto Deseado]] was explored by [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]] and was claimed in 1670 by Sir [[John Narborough]] for King [[Charles II of England]], but the English made no attempt to establish settlements or explore the interior.\n\n====Patagonian giants: early European perceptions====\n{{main|Patagon}}\nThe first European explorers of Patagonia observed that the indigenous people in the region were taller than the average Europeans of the time, prompting some of them to believe that Patagonians were giants.\n\nAccording to Antonio Pigafetta,<ref name=\"Pigafetta\"/> one of the Magellan expedition's few survivors and its published chronicler, Magellan bestowed the name ''Patag\u00e3o'' (or ''Patag\u00f3n'') on the inhabitants they encountered there, and the name \"Patagonia\" for the region. Although Pigafetta's account does not describe how this name came about, subsequent popular interpretations gave credence to a derivation meaning \"land of the big feet\". However, this [[etymology]] is questionable. The term is most likely derived from an actual character name, \"Patag\u00f3n\", a savage creature confronted by Primale\u00f3n of Greece, the hero in the homonymous Spanish chivalry novel (or [[Knight-errant|knight-errantry tale]]) by Francisco V\u00e1zquez.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Growth and Development |editor1-first=Stanley J. |editor1-last=Ulijaszek |editor2-first=Francis E. |editor2-last=Johnston |editor3-first=M.

This supposed race of Patagonian giants or [[Patagon]]es entered into the common European perception of this then little-known and distant area, to be further fueled by subsequent reports of other expeditions and famous travelers such as Sir Francis Drake, which seemed to confirm these accounts. Early charts of the [[New World]] sometimes added the legend ''regio gigantum'' (\"region of the giants\") to the Patagonian area. By 1611, the Patagonian god Setebos (Settaboth in Pigafetta) was familiar to the hearers of ''The Tempest''.\n\nThe concept and general belief persisted for a further 250 years, and was to be sensationally reignited in 1767 when an \"official\" (but anonymous) account was published of [[Commodore (RN)|Commodore]] [[John Byron]]'s recent voyage of global [[circumnavigation]] in [[HMS Dolphin (1751)|HMS ''Dolphin'']]. Byron and crew had spent some time along the coast, and the publication (''Voyage Round the World in His Majesty's Ship the Dolphin'') seemed to give proof positive of their existence; the publication became an overnight bestseller, thousands of extra copies were to be sold to a willing public, and other prior accounts of the region were hastily republished (even those in which giant-like folk were not mentioned at all).\n\nHowever, the Patagonian giant frenzy died down substantially only a few years later, when some more sober and analytical accounts were published. In 1773, [[John Hawkesworth (book editor)|John Hawkesworth]] published on behalf of the [[Admiralty]] a compendium of noted English southern-hemisphere explorers' journals, including that of [[James Cook]] and John Byron. In this publication, drawn from their official logs, the people Byron's expedition had encountered clearly were no taller than {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m|adj=on}}, very tall but by no means giants.

[[Thomas Falkner]], a Jesuit who resided near forty years in those parts, published his ''Description of Patagonia'' (Hereford, 1774); [[Francisco Viedma]] founded ''El Carmen'', nowadays [[Carmen de Patagones]] and Antonio settled the area of [[San Julian Bay]], where he founded the colony of [[Floridablanca (Patagonia)|Floridablanca]] and advanced inland to the Andes (1782).

The latter expedition is particularly noted for the participation of [[Charles Darwin]], who spent considerable time investigating various areas of Patagonia onshore, including long rides with [[gaucho]]s in [[R\u00edo Negro (Argentina)|R\u00edo Negro]], and who joined FitzRoy in a {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=on}} expedition taking ships' boats up the course of the [[Santa Cruz River (Argentina)|Santa Cruz River]].\n\n===Chilean and Argentine colonization (1843\u20131902)===\nIn the early 19th century, the [[Araucanization of Patagonia|araucanization]] of the natives of northern Patagonia intensified, and many [[Mapuche]]s migrated to Patagonia to live as nomads that raised cattle or pillaged the Argentine countryside. The cattle stolen in the incursions (''[[Mal\u00f3n|malones]]'') were later taken to Chile through the mountain passes and traded for goods, especially alcoholic beverages. The main trail for this trade was called [[Camino de los chilenos]] and runs a length around 1000&nbsp;km from the [[Buenos Aires Province]] to the [[mountain pass]]es of [[Neuqu\u00e9n Province]]. The ''[[lonco]]'' [[Calfucur\u00e1]] crossed the [[Andes]] from Chile to the pampas around 1830, after a call from the governor of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], to fight the [[Boroano people]]. In 1859, he attacked [[Bah\u00eda Blanca]] in Argentina with 3,000 warriors. As in the case of Calfucura, many other bands of Mapuches got involved in the internal conflicts of Argentina until [[Conquest of the Desert]]. To counter the cattle raids, a trench called the [[Zanja de Alsina]] was built by Argentina in the pampas in the 1870s.\n\n[[File:Mapa ARGENTINA frontera.png|thumb|210px|Map of the advance of the Argentina frontier until the establishment of [[zanja de Alsina]]]]\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the newly independent nations of Argentina and Chile began an aggressive phase of expansion into the south, increasing confrontation with the Indians of the region. In 1860, French adventurer [[Orelie-Antoine de Tounens]] proclaimed himself king of the [[Kingdom of Araucan\u00eda and Patagonia]] of the [[Mapuche]].\n\nFollowing the last instructions of [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], the Chilean president [[Manuel Bulnes]] sent an expedition to the Strait of Magellan and founded [[Fuerte Bulnes]] in 1843. Five years later, the Chilean government moved the main settlement to the current location of [[Punta Arenas, Chile|Punta Arenas]], the oldest permanent settlement in Southern Patagonia. The creation of Punta Arenas was instrumental in making Chile's claim of the Strait of Magellan permanent. In the 1860s, sheep from the [[Falkland Islands]] were introduced to the lands around the Straits of Magellan, and throughout the 19th century, sheepfarming grew to be the most important economic sector in southern Patagonia.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[George Chaworth Musters]] in 1869 wandered in company with a band of Tehuelches through the whole length of the country from the strait to the Manzaneros in the northwest, and collected a great deal of information about the people and their mode of life.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=19679|first=John|last=Dickenson|title=Musters, George Chaworth}}</ref>\n\n====Conquest of the desert and the 1881 treaty====\n{{Main|Conquest of the Desert|Boundary Treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina}}\n[[File:Mapa ARGENTINA 1881.png|thumb|170px|left|Under General [[Julio Argentino Roca|Roca]], the [[Conquest of the Desert]] extended Argentine power into Patagonia]]\nArgentine authorities worried that the strong connections araucanized tribes had with Chile would allegedly give Chile certain influence over the pampas.<ref name=\"cite journal|jstor=981291\">{{cite journal|jstor=981291 | volume=36 | issue=3 | pages=347\u2013363|title=Argentina and Chile: The Struggle For Patagonia 1843\u20131881| journal=The Americas | last1=Perry | first1=Richard O. | year=1980 | doi=10.2307/981291 }}</ref> Argentine authorities feared an eventual war with Chile over Patagonia, where the natives would side with the Chileans and that it would therefore be fought in the vicinities of Buenos Aires.<ref name=\"cite journal|jstor=981291\"/>\n \nThe decision of planning and executing the Conquest of the Desert was probably triggered by the 1872 attack of [[Cufulcur\u00e1]] and his 6,000 followers on the cities of [[General Alvear, Mendoza|General Alvear]], [[Veinticinco de Mayo, Buenos Aires|Veinticinco de Mayo]], and [[Nueve de Julio, Buenos Aires Province|Nueve de Julio]], where 300 ''[[Creole peoples|criollos]]'' were killed, and 200,000 heads of cattle taken.\n\nIn the 1870s, the Conquest of the Desert was a controversial campaign by the Argentine government, executed mainly by [[General Julio Argentino Roca]], to subdue or, some claim, to exterminate the native peoples of the south.\n\nIn 1885, a mining expeditionary party under the [[Romania]]n adventurer [[Julius Popper]] landed in southern Patagonia in search of gold, which they found after traveling southwards towards the lands of Tierra del Fuego. This led to the further opening up of the area to prospectors.

After reaching its heights during the First World War, the decline in world wool prices affected sheep farming in Argentina. Nowadays, about half of Argentina's 15 million sheep are in Patagonia, a percentage that is growing as sheep farming disappears in the pampas to the north. Chubut (mainly [[Merino]]) is the top wool producer with Santa Cruz (Corriedale and some Merino) second. Sheep farming revived in 2002 with the devaluation of the peso and firmer global demand for wool (led by China and the EU). Still, little investment occurs in new abattoirs (mainly in Comodoro Rivadavia, Trelew, and Rio Gallegos), and often [[Phytosanitary certification|phytosanitary]] restrictions reduce the export of sheep meat. Extensive valleys in the [[Cordilleran range]] have provided sufficient grazing lands, and the low humidity and weather of the southern region make raising Merino and Corriedale sheep common.\n\nLivestock also includes small numbers of cattle, and in lesser numbers, pigs and horses. Sheep farming provides a small but important number of jobs for rural areas with little other employment.\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Ballenas en Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e8s.jpg|thumb|Whale watching off the [[Valdes Peninsula]]]]\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, tourism became an ever more important part of Patagonia's economy. Originally a remote backpacking destination, the region has attracted increasing numbers of upmarket visitors, cruise passengers rounding [[Cape Horn]] or visiting Antarctica, and adventure and activity holiday-makers. Principal tourist attractions include the [[Perito Moreno glacier]], the [[Vald\u00e9s Peninsula]], the [[Argentine Lake District]] and Ushuaia and Tierra del Fuego (the city is also a jumping-off place for travel to Antarctica, bringing in still more visitors). Tourism has created new markets locally and for export for traditional crafts such as Mapuche handicrafts, guanaco textiles, and confectionery and preserves.<ref name=\"time out\"/>\n\nA spin-off from increased tourism has been the buying of often enormous tracts of land by foreigners, often as a prestige purchase rather than for agriculture. Buyers have included [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Ted Turner]], and [[Christopher Lambert]], and most notably [[Luciano Benetton]], Patagonia's largest landowner.<ref name=\"time out\"/> His \"Compa\u00f1ia de Tierras Sud\" has brought new techniques to the ailing sheep-rearing industry and sponsored museums and community facilities, but has been controversial particularly for its treatment of local Mapuche communities.<ref>[http://www.mapuche-nation.org/english/main/benetton/main/info.htm 'The Invisible Colors of Benetton'], [[Mapuche International Link]], accessed 2006-08-11</ref>\n\n===Energy===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}\n<br />\n\n[[File:LaTrochita12EnNahuelPanFormacionEstacionada.jpg|thumb|''[[La Trochita]]'' on its [[Chubut Province]] route: Formerly the sole rapid transport means in the province, ''La Trochita'' is now a tourist attraction.]]\nDue to its sparse rainfall in agricultural areas, Argentine Patagonia already has numerous dams for irrigation, some of which are also used for hydropower. The [[Limay River]] is used to generate hydroelectricity at five dams built on its course: [[Alicur\u00e1 Dam|Alicur\u00e1]], [[Piedra del \u00c1guila Dam|Piedra del \u00c1guila]], [[Pichi Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa Dam|Pichi Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa]], [[El Choc\u00f3n Dam|El Choc\u00f3n]], and [[Arroyito Dam|Arroyito]]. Together with the [[Cerros Colorados Complex]] on the [[Neuqu\u00e9n River]], they contribute ore than one-quarter of the total hydroelectric generation in the country. Coal is mined in the [[Rio Turbio]] area and used for electricity generation. Patagonia's notorious winds have already made the area Argentina's main source of wind power, and plans have been made for major increases in wind power generation.\nPatagonia has always been Argentina's main area, and Chile's only area, of conventional oil and gas production. Oil and gas have played an important role in the rise of Neuqu\u00e9n-Cipolleti as Patagonia's most populous urban area, and in the growth of [[Comodoro Rivadavia]], Punta Arenas, and Rio Grande, as well. The development of the Neuqu\u00e9n basin's enormous [[unconventional oil]] and gas reserves through hydraulic fracturing has just begun, but the [[YPF]]-[[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] Loma Campana field in the Vaca Muerta formation is already the world's largest producing shale oil field outside North America according to former YPF CEO Miguel Gallucio.\n\n==Cuisine==\nArgentine Patagonian cuisine is largely the same as the cuisine of Buenos Aires \u2013 grilled meats and pasta \u2013 with extensive{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} use of local ingredients and less use of those products that have to be imported into the region. Lamb is considered the traditional Patagonian meat, grilled for several hours over an open fire. Some guide books have reported that game, especially guanaco and introduced deer and boar, are popular in restaurant cuisine. However, since the guanaco is a protected animal in both Chile and Argentina, it is unlikely to appear commonly as restaurant fare. Trout and ''[[centolla]]'' ([[king crab]]) are also common, though overfishing of ''centolla'' has made it increasingly scarce. In the area around Bariloche, a noted [[Alpine cuisine]] tradition remains, with chocolate bars and even [[fondue]] restaurants, and [[tea room]]s are a feature of the [[Welsh_people|Welsh]] communities in [[Gaiman, Chubut|Gaiman]] and [[Trevelin]], as well as in the mountains.<ref name=\"time out\"/> Since the mid-1990s, some success with winemaking has occurred in Argentine Patagonia, especially in Neuqu\u00e9n.\n\n==Foreign land buyers issue==\nForeign investors, including Italian multinational [[Benetton Group]], [[Ted Turner]], Joseph Lewis<ref name=\"patagonia-argentina.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.patagonia-argentina.com/i/content/accesoalagosyrios.php |title=''Rivers of blood''from Patagonia-argentina.com}}</ref> and the environmentalist [[Douglas Tompkins]], own major land areas. This situation has caused several conflicts with local inhabitants and the governments of [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]], for example, the opposition by Douglas Tompkins to the planned route for [[Carretera Austral]] in [[Pumal\u00edn Park]]. A scandal is also brewing about two properties owned by Ted Turner: the ''estancia'' La Primavera, located inside [[Nahuel Huapi National Park]], and the ''estancia'' Coll\u00f3n Cura.<ref name=\"patagonia-argentina.com\"/> Benetton has faced criticism from Mapuche organizations, including [[Mapuche International Link]], over its purchase of traditional Mapuche lands in Patagonia. The Curi\u00f1anco-Nahuelquir family was evicted from their land in 2002 following Benetton's claim to it, but the land was restored in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.santarosarecuperada.com.ar/english/index.html|title=Recovered Mapuche territory in Patagonia: Benetton vs. Mapuche|publisher=MAPU Association|accessdate=7 April 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120908191814/http://www.santarosarecuperada.com.ar/english/index.html|archivedate=8 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Llao LLao.jpg|[[Nahuel Huapi Lake]], near [[Bariloche]], Argentina [[Chait\u00e9n (volcano)|Chait\u00e9n volcano]] stretching across Patagonia into [[San Jorge Basin]] in the Atlantic Ocean\nFile:Perito Moreno Glacier - Satelite - NASA - ISS004-E-9707.JPG|Satellite view of the [[Perito Moreno Glacier]] (Santa Cruz Province) and the Andean ice sheet\nFile:Ainsworth bay and Marinelli Glacier.jpg|Ainsworth bay and [[Marinelli Glacier]], Magallanes Region, Chile\nFile:Laguna Huinfuica.jpg|Huinfiuca Lagoon, [[Villarrica National Park]], Los Lagos and Los R\u00edos regions, Chile\nFile:Perito Moreno Glacier Patagonia Argentina Luca Galuzzi 2005.JPG|[[Perito Moreno Glacier]], Santa Cruz Province, Argentina\nFile:Cavalli Al Pascolo Ai Piedi Del Massiccio Del Fitz Roy, Patagonia.jpg|[[Monte Fitz Roy]], Santa Cruz Province\nFile:Trelew-Chubut.jpg|The city of [[Trelew]], Chubut Province, Argentina\nFile:Guanako.jpg|[[Guanaco]]s.\nFile:Welshpeople.jpg|[[Y Wladfa|Welsh]] settlement in Patagonia, Chubut Province\nFile:southern right whale.jpg|[[Southern right whale]] in Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e9s, Chubut Province\nFile:TorredDelPaine2016.jpg|[[Torres del Paine]], Chile\nFile:Glaciar Grey, Torres del Paine.jpg|[[Grey Glacier]], [[Torres del Paine National Park]]\nFile:One of the most beautiful places on earth.

Most of the remainder of the church originates from the 14th century. The nave, aisles, transepts and crossing were all built together, between approximately 1329 and 1361 (based on [[heraldic]] evidence).<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n\n=== Construction materials ===\nThe church is primarily built from [[flint]] and [[rubble]], with rubble and [[ashlar]] dressings. The [[Church porch|porch]] and [[buttress]]es are [[brick]] constructions.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n\n=== Layout ===\nThe church consists of a [[nave]], [[Aisle#Church architecture|aisles]] and a chancel. The chapel is in the North-east of the church, a [[crossing tower]] with a 2-stair [[turret]]. There are north and south porches. Both the chancel and the chapel are at a lower level than the transepts and crossing, with steps leading down to the east.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n\n=== Windows ===\nThe West and North transept windows have a [[curvilinear]] design - as did the former south transept window - of 4 [[Window#Lights|lights]] with [[Tracery|cinquefoil]] over. The North aisle has two 3-light windows in brick while the South aisle has two 3-light windows in curvilinearstyle, all in plain [[chamfer]]ed surrounds. In the North chapel, there are two [[Gothic architecture#Lancet arch|lancets]] to the west, and two paired lancets with quatrefoils over to east, while the chancel  has a 3-light Perpendicular window and a 2-light curvilinear window on the south wall. The chancel east window is a 5-light perpendicular window, while the chapel east window is a 4-light perpendicular window. All of the windows possess the original [[Reveal (carpentry)|reveals]], as do all of the doors. The chancel south wall has two blocked window openings: the westernmost one is blocked by the stair turret while the easterly one is cut through by 14th century curvilinear window.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n\nThe South Transept window is a work of art by Leonie Seliger, commissioned in 2002, which replaced the original windows which was damaged by [[incendiary bomb]]s in the [[Second World War]].<ref name=\"wyebenefice\"/><ref name=\"leonieseliger\"/> The window had been bricked up and concreted over in 1952.<ref name=\"leonieseliger\"/> The money to pay for the new window was raised by the ''[[Stour Music Festival]] Appeal Fund'' in memory of its founder [[Alfred Deller]] and to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Festival.<ref name=\"wyebenefice\"/><ref name=\"leonieseliger\"/>\n\n=== Doors ===\nThe West door is made of 18th century plank in a 14th-century [[Molding (decorative)|roll-moulded]] surround between two large offset buttresses. The North door is a 17th-century plank with door-width plain metal [[hinge]]s. The South door has been [[plaster]]ed over.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n\n=== Bays, Piers, Arches, Reveals ===\nThe nave has 4 [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] with octagonal [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] on moulded bases. The arches are double-chamfered. The crossing piers are a continuation of the nave arcade, although on a slightly larger scale, with crossing arches. All of the piers are made from [[chalk]] blocks. Over the west and the north doors, there are angular 4-centred arches. The [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] to the chancel has 3 round piers, various moulded and undercut [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] and 'water-holding' bases. The arches are similar double-chamfered ones as seen in the nave. The same style of arches are also used in the nave, and in the transept crossing arches.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n\n=== Features and Fittings ===\n* [[Holy water stoup]] by north door.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* 13th century [[sedile]] in chancel, with hollow-chamfered and undercut surround. There are attached shafts of uneven height in the [[door jamb]]s, with drip-mould over the jambs.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* To the east of the church, a [[piscina]] with 14th century leaf [[crocket]]s over a 13th-century trefoil, with a small plain [[aumbry]] over it. There are also piscinas in both the north chapel and the south transept, the latter having an [[ogee]] at the top.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* A 15th-century [[Bracket (architecture)|bracket]] is located above a woman's head in the chancel, while a 15th-century demi-[[angel]] leads to a bracket in the chapel.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* In the North transept, the eastern wall has a 15th-century wall painting of the [[Trinity]], with 2 brackets once supporting a 17th-century monument. This was a dove, representing the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/><ref name=\"kentchurches\"/>\n* In the North chapel, there is a 14th-century [[Rood screen|wooden screen]], with solid lower panels, and 8-light traceried screens on either side of 4-light double door. This is roll moulded with a hollow chamfered beam on top.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/><ref name=\"kentchurches\"/>\n* In the chancel are 17th-century [[altar rails]].<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* Several windows contain mediaeval glass.<ref name=\"wyebenefice\"/> [[Stained glass]] shields of the King and Kentish families associated with him form part of the  East window,<ref name=\"kentchurches\"/> along with the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] and representations of Edward III and Eleanor.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* The nave contains an octagonal [[Baptismal font|font]].<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* There are several monuments in the north (\"Moyle\") chapel:<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n** \"To Amye Clerk (nee Moyle), d.1631\"\n** A marble monument showing a shrouded person lying down, with children at their head and feet.

Every June, the building is used to host the ''[[Stour Music Festival]].''\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Alfred Deller grave All Saints\u2019 Church, Boughton Aluph.JPG|thumb|[[Alfred Deller]]'s grave at All Saints\u2019 Church, Boughton Aluph]]\n\n=== Building history ===\nThe present [[chancel]] and [[chapel]] are from the 13th century, with 15th century East Windows and a 17th-century porch. Most of the remainder of the church originates from the 14th century. The nave, aisles, transepts and crossing were all built together, between approximately 1329 and 1361 (based on [[heraldic]] evidence).<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n\n=== Construction materials ===\nThe church is primarily built from [[flint]] and [[rubble]], with rubble and [[ashlar]] dressings. The [[Church porch|porch]] and [[buttress]]es are [[brick]] constructions.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n\n=== Layout ===\nThe church consists of a [[nave]], [[Aisle#Church architecture|aisles]] and a chancel. The chapel is in the North-east of the church, a [[crossing tower]] with a 2-stair [[turret]]. There are north and south porches. Both the chancel and the chapel are at a lower level than the transepts and crossing, with steps leading down to the east.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n\n=== Windows ===\nThe West and North transept windows have a [[curvilinear]] design - as did the former south transept window - of 4 [[Window#Lights|lights]] with [[Tracery|cinquefoil]] over. The North aisle has two 3-light windows in brick while the South aisle has two 3-light windows in curvilinearstyle, all in plain [[chamfer]]ed surrounds. In the North chapel, there are two [[Gothic architecture#Lancet arch|lancets]] to the west, and two paired lancets with quatrefoils over to east, while the chancel  has a 3-light Perpendicular window and a 2-light curvilinear window on the south wall. The chancel east window is a 5-light perpendicular window, while the chapel east window is a 4-light perpendicular window. All of the windows possess the original [[Reveal (carpentry)|reveals]], as do all of the doors. The chancel south wall has two blocked window openings: the westernmost one is blocked by the stair turret while the easterly one is cut through by 14th century curvilinear window.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n\nThe South Transept window is a work of art by Leonie Seliger, commissioned in 2002, which replaced the original windows which was damaged by [[incendiary bomb]]s in the [[Second World War]].<ref name=\"wyebenefice\"/><ref name=\"leonieseliger\"/> The window had been bricked up and concreted over in 1952.<ref name=\"leonieseliger\"/> The money to pay for the new window was raised by the ''[[Stour Music Festival]] Appeal Fund'' in memory of its founder [[Alfred Deller]] and to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Festival.<ref name=\"wyebenefice\"/><ref name=\"leonieseliger\"/>\n\n=== Doors ===\nThe West door is made of 18th century plank in a 14th-century [[Molding (decorative)|roll-moulded]] surround between two large offset buttresses. The North door is a 17th-century plank with door-width plain metal [[hinge]]s. The South door has been [[plaster]]ed over.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n\n=== Bays, Piers, Arches, Reveals ===\nThe nave has 4 [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] with octagonal [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] on moulded bases. The arches are double-chamfered. The crossing piers are a continuation of the nave arcade, although on a slightly larger scale, with crossing arches. All of the piers are made from [[chalk]] blocks. Over the west and the north doors, there are angular 4-centred arches. The [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] to the chancel has 3 round piers, various moulded and undercut [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] and 'water-holding' bases. The arches are similar double-chamfered ones as seen in the nave. The same style of arches are also used in the nave, and in the transept crossing arches.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n\n=== Features and Fittings ===\n* [[Holy water stoup]] by north door.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* 13th century [[sedile]] in chancel, with hollow-chamfered and undercut surround. There are attached shafts of uneven height in the [[door jamb]]s, with drip-mould over the jambs.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* To the east of the church, a [[piscina]] with 14th century leaf [[crocket]]s over a 13th-century trefoil, with a small plain [[aumbry]] over it. There are also piscinas in both the north chapel and the south transept, the latter having an [[ogee]] at the top.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* A 15th-century [[Bracket (architecture)|bracket]] is located above a woman's head in the chancel, while a 15th-century demi-[[angel]] leads to a bracket in the chapel.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* In the North transept, the eastern wall has a 15th-century wall painting of the [[Trinity]], with 2 brackets once supporting a 17th-century monument. This was a dove, representing the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/><ref name=\"kentchurches\"/>\n* In the North chapel, there is a 14th-century [[Rood screen|wooden screen]], with solid lower panels, and 8-light traceried screens on either side of 4-light double door. This is roll moulded with a hollow chamfered beam on top.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/><ref name=\"kentchurches\"/>\n* In the chancel are 17th century [[altar rails]].<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* Several windows contain mediaeval glass.<ref name=\"wyebenefice\"/> [[Stained glass]] shields of the King and Kentish families associated with him form part of the  East window,<ref name=\"kentchurches\"/> along with the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] and representations of Edward III and Eleanor.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* The nave contains an octagonal [[Baptismal font|font]].<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* There are several monuments in the north (\"Moyle\") chapel:<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n** \"To Amye Clerk (nee Moyle), d.1631\"\n** A marble monument showing a shrouded person lying down, with children at their head and feet.
