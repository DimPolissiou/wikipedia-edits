Although Leeds soon recovered they had lost too much ground in the race for 3rd and 4th place consecutive defeats to Manchester United 3-4 and Tottenham 1-2 all but ended Leeds hopes of finishing in the top 4, United would finish 5th but after spending 100 million in recent years on player signings and with one of the best squads in the Premiership was a disappointment. In June David O'Leary manager since October 1998 who had previously secured 4th 3rd 4th place finishes a Uafer cup semi final and Champions League semi final was sacked by chairman Peter Risdale.    \n\nPlans were unveiled on 5 September for a new 50,000-seat stadium at [[Skelton, West Yorkshire|Skelton]] to replace [[Elland Road]], with Ridsdale hoping to have it ready by the summer of 2004. In fact, Ridsdale was aware that millions of pounds had been staked on Champions League qualification - by not qualifying in successive years, the club was heading for financial meltdown.\n\n==Final

Although Leeds soon recovered they had lost too much ground in the race for 3rd and 4th place consecutive defeats to Manchester United 3-4 and Tottenham 1-2 all but ended Leeds hopes of finishing in the top 4, United would finish 5th but after spending 100 million in recent years on player signings and with one of the best squads in the Premiership was a disappointment. In June David O'Leary manager since October 1998 who had previously secured 4th 3rd 4th place finishes a Uafer cup semi final and Champions League semi final was sacked by chairman Peter Risdale.    \n\nPlans were unveiled on 5 September for a new 50,000-seat stadium at [[Skelton, West Yorkshire|Skelton]] to replace [[Elland Road]], with Ridsdale hoping to have it ready by the summer of 2004. In fact, Ridsdale was aware that millions of pounds had been staked on Champions League qualification - by not qualifying in successive years, the club was heading for financial meltdown.\n\n==Final

Legislatures form important parts of most [[Government|governments]]; in the [[separation of powers]] model, they are often contrasted with the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches of government.\n\nLaws enacted by legislatures are usually known as [[primary legislation]]. In addition, legislatures may observe and steer governing actions, with authority to amend the [[budget]] involved. \n\nThe members of a legislature are called [[legislator]]s. In a [[democracy]], legislators are most commonly popularly [[Election|elected]], although [[indirect election]] and appointment by the executive are also used, particularly for [[bicameralism|bicameral]] legislatures featuring an [[upper chamber]].\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Legislation Terminology Map.png|thumb|upright=1.8|right|Map showing the terminology for each country's national legislature]]\nThe name used to refer to a legislative body varies by country.  \n\nCommon names include:\n\n* Assembly (from ''to assemble'')\n* Congress (from ''to congregate'')\n* Diet\n* Duma (from Russian ''d\u00fama'' 'thought')\n*Parliament (from French ''parlez'' 'to speak')\n\nThough the and specific rules for each legislature differ by location, they all aim to serve the same purpose of appointing officials to represent their citizens to determine appropriate legislation for the country.\n\n== History ==\nAmong the earliest recognised legislatures was the [[Athens|Athenian]] ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]].''<ref name=\":0\" /> In the [[Middle Ages]], European monarchs would host assemblies of the nobility, which would later develop into predecessors of modern legislatures.<ref name=\":0\" /> The oldest surviving legislature is the [[Iceland|Icelandic]] [[Althing]], founded in 930 CE.\n\n== Functions ==\nDemocratic legislatures have six major functions: representation, deliberation, legislation, authorizing expenditure, making governments, and oversight.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|publisher=|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|location=|pages=128\u2013130|oclc=961119208}}</ref>\n\n=== Representation ===\nThere exist five ways that representation can be achieved in a legislature:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Formalistically: how the rules of the legislature ensure representation of constituents;\n* Symbolically: how the constituents perceive their representatives;\n* Descriptively: how well the composition of the legilsature matches the demographics of the wider society;\n* Substantively: how well representatives actually respond to the needs of their constituents;\n* Collectively: how well the representatives represent the interests of the society as a whole.\n\n=== Deliberation ===\nOne of the major functions of a legislature is to discuss and debate issues of major importance to society.<ref name=\":0\" /> This can take place in two forms.

In [[Westminster system|Westminster-style]] legislatures the executive (composed of the cabinet) can essentially pass any laws it wants, as it usually has a majority of legislators behind it, kept in check by the party whip, while committee-based legislatures in [[continental Europe]] and those in [[Presidential system|presidential systems]] of the [[Americas]] have more independence in drafting and amending bills.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|publisher=|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|location=|pages=130\u2013131|oclc=961119208}}</ref>\n\n=== Authorizing expenditure ===\nThe origins of the [[power of the purse]] which legislatures typically have in passing or denying [[Government budget|government budgets]] goes back to the European assemblies of nobility which the [[Monarch|monarchs]] would have to consult before raising taxes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|publisher=|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|location=|pages=131\u2013132|oclc=961119208}}</ref> For this power to be actually effective, the legislature should be able to amend the budget, have an effective committee system, enough time for consideration, as well as access to relevant background information.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Making governments ===\nThe power of the legislature over the government is stronger in [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary systems]], where the former can remove the latter, but weaker in [[Presidential system|presidential systems]], where there is a [[separation of powers]] between the two.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Oversight ===\nThere are several ways in which the legislature can hold the government accountable, including [[Question time|questioning]], [[Interpellation (politics)|interpellations]], and [[Motion of no confidence|votes of confidence]].\n\n=== Function in authoritarian regimes ===\nIn contrast to [[Democracy|democratic]] systems, legislatures under [[authoritarianism]] are used to ensure the stability of the power structure by co-opting potential competing interests within the elites, which they achieve by:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|oclc=961119208}}</ref>\n\n* Providing legitimacy;\n* Incorporating opponents into the system;\n* Providing some representation of outside interests;\n* Offering a way to recruit new members to the ruling clique;\n* Being a channel through which limited grievances and concessions can be passed.\n\n== Internal organization ==\nEach chamber of the legislature consists of a number of legislators who use some form of [[parliamentary procedure]] to debate political issues and vote on proposed legislation. There must be a certain number of legislators present to carry out these activities; this is called a [[quorum]].\n\nSome of the responsibilities of a legislature, such as giving first consideration to newly proposed legislation, are usually delegated to [[committee]]s made up of a few of the members of the chamber(s).\n\nThe members of a legislature usually represent different [[Political party|political parties]]; the members from each party generally meet as a [[caucus]] to organize their internal affairs.\n\n==Relation to other branches of government==\nLegislatures vary widely in the amount of [[Politics|political]] [[Power (social and political)|power]] they wield, compared to other political players such as [[Judiciary|judiciaries]], [[Military|militaries]], and [[Executive (government)|executives]]. In 2009, political scientists [[Steven Fish|M. Steven Fish]] and Matthew Kroenig constructed a Parliamentary Powers Index in an attempt to quantify the different degrees of power among national legislatures. The German [[Bundestag]], the [[Italian Parliament]], and the Mongolian [[State Great Khural]] tied for most powerful, while Myanmar's [[House of Representatives (Myanmar)|House of Representatives]] and Somalia's [[Transitional Federal Parliament|Transitional Federal Assembly]] (since replaced by the [[Federal Parliament of Somalia]]) tied for least powerful.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The handbook of national legislatures: a global survey|last=Fish|first=M.

Such a system renders the legislature more powerful.\n\nIn [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] and [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] systems of [[government]], the [[Executive branch|executive]] is responsible to the legislature, which may remove it with a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]]. On the other hand, according to the [[separation of powers]] doctrine, the legislature in a [[presidential system]] is considered an independent and coequal branch of government along with both the [[Judicial branch|judiciary]] and the executive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Governing Systems and Executive-Legislative Relations (Presidential, Parliamentary and Hybrid Systems) |publisher=United Nations Development Programme |url=http://www.undp.org/governance/docs/Parl-Pub-govern.htm |accessdate=2008-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017164441/http://www.undp.org/governance/docs/Parl-Pub-govern.htm |archivedate=2008-10-17 }}</ref>\n\nLegislatures will sometimes delegate their legislative power to [[Administrative agency|administrative]] or [[Executive agency|executive agencies]].<ref name=\"Schoenbrod\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Schoenbrod |first= David | editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |chapter= Delegation  |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC  |accessdate= |edition= |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n74 |isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages= 117\u201318 |quote=|ref= }} </ref>\n\n==Members==\nLegislatures are made up of individual members, known as [[Legislator|legislators]], who [[Voting|vote]] on proposed laws. A legislature usually contains a fixed number of legislators; because legislatures usually meet in a specific room filled with seats for the legislators, this is often described as the number of \"seats\" it contains. For example, a legislature that has 100 \"seats\" has 100 members. By extension, an [[electoral district]] that elects a single legislator can also be described as a \"seat\", as, for, example, in the phrases \"[[safe seat]]\" and \"[[marginal seat]]\".\n\n==Chambers==\n[[File:Vista panor\u00e1mica del Hemiciclo de sesiones del Congreso del Peru.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Congress of the Republic of Peru]], the country's national legislature, meets in the [[Legislative Palace (Peru)|Legislative Palace]] in 2010]]\n\nA legislature may [[debate]] and [[vote]] upon [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]]s as a single unit, or it may be composed of multiple separate [[Deliberative assembly|assemblies]], called by various names including [[Chambers of parliament|''legislative chambers'']], [[Debate chamber|''debate chambers'']], and ''houses'', which debate and vote separately and have distinct powers. A legislature which operates as a single unit is [[Unicameralism|unicameral]], one divided into two chambers is [[Bicameralism|bicameral]], and one divided into three chambers is [[Tricameralism|tricameral]].\n[[File:House of Commons Chamber 1.png|thumb|left|The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], its lower house]]\nIn bicameral legislatures, one chamber is usually considered the [[upper house]], while the other is considered the [[lower house]]. The two types are not rigidly different, but members of upper houses tend to be indirectly elected or appointed rather than directly elected, tend to be allocated by [[Administrative division|administrative divisions]] rather than by population, and tend to have longer terms than members of the lower house. In some systems, particularly [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary systems]], the upper house has less power and tends to have a more advisory role, but in others, particularly [[Federation|federal]] [[Presidential system|presidential systems]], the upper house has equal or even greater power. \n[[File:Deutscher Bundestag Plenarsaal Seitenansicht.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Germany|German]] [[Bundestag]], its theoretical lower house]]\n\nIn [[federation]]s, the upper house typically represents the federation's component states. This is also the case with the supranational legislature of the [[European Union]]. The upper house may either contain the delegates of state governments{{spaced ndash}}as in the European Union and in [[Germany]] and, [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|before 1913, in the United States]]{{spaced ndash}}or be elected according to a formula that grants equal representation to states with smaller populations, as is the case in [[Australia]] and the United States since 1913.\n[[File:Senate panorama.jpg|right|upright=1.8|thumb|The [[Australian Senate]], its upper house]]\n[[Tricameral]] legislatures are rare; the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council]] still exists, but the most recent national example existed in the waning years of White-minority rule in [[South Africa]]. [[Tetracameralism|Tetracameral]] legislatures no longer exist, but they were previously used in Scandinavia.\n\n==Size==\nLegislatures vary widely in their size.

A legislature usually contains a fixed number of legislators; because legislatures usually meet in a specific room filled with seats for the legislators, this is often described as the number of \"seats\" it contains. For example, a legislature that has 100 \"seats\" has 100 members. By extension, an [[electoral district]] that elects a single legislator can also be described as a \"seat\", as, for, example, in the phrases \"[[safe seat]]\" and \"[[marginal seat]]\".\n\n==Chambers==\n[[File:Vista panor\u00e1mica del Hemiciclo de sesiones del Congreso del Peru.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Congress of the Republic of Peru]], the country's national legislature, meets in the [[Legislative Palace (Peru)|Legislative Palace]] in 2010]]\n\nA legislature may [[debate]] and [[vote]] upon [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]]s as a single unit, or it may be composed of multiple separate [[Deliberative assembly|assemblies]], called by various names including [[Chambers of parliament|''legislative chambers'']], [[Debate chamber|''debate chambers'']], and ''houses'', which debate and vote separately and have distinct powers. A legislature which operates as a single unit is [[Unicameralism|unicameral]], one divided into two chambers is [[Bicameralism|bicameral]], and one divided into three chambers is [[Tricameralism|tricameral]].\n[[File:House of Commons Chamber 1.png|thumb|left|The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], its lower house]]\nIn bicameral legislatures, one chamber is usually considered the [[upper house]], while the other is considered the [[lower house]]. The two types are not rigidly different, but members of upper houses tend to be indirectly elected or appointed rather than directly elected, tend to be allocated by [[Administrative division|administrative divisions]] rather than by population, and tend to have longer terms than members of the lower house. In some systems, particularly [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary systems]], the upper house has less power and tends to have a more advisory role, but in others, particularly [[Federation|federal]] [[Presidential system|presidential systems]], the upper house has equal or even greater power. \n[[File:Deutscher Bundestag Plenarsaal Seitenansicht.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Germany|German]] [[Bundestag]], its theoretical lower house]]\n\nIn [[federation]]s, the upper house typically represents the federation's component states. This is also the case with the supranational legislature of the [[European Union]]. The upper house may either contain the delegates of state governments{{spaced ndash}}as in the European Union and in [[Germany]] and, [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|before 1913, in the United States]]{{spaced ndash}}or be elected according to a formula that grants equal representation to states with smaller populations, as is the case in [[Australia]] and the United States since 1913.\n[[File:Senate panorama.jpg|right|upright=1.8|thumb|The [[Australian Senate]], its upper house]]\n[[Tricameral]] legislatures are rare; the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council]] still exists, but the most recent national example existed in the waning years of White-minority rule in [[South Africa]].

Scharff, ''Fairbairn Then and Now'' (1998), a text by David Celani which is an application of Fairbairn's model  to domestic violence, ''The Illusion of Love:Why The Battered Woman Returns to Her Abuser'' (1994) , and a second text by Celani on the application of  Fairbairn's model to the treatment of severe personality disorders,  ''Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting'', (2010).\n\n===Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality (1952)===\n\n''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'' (1952) is a collection of papers previously published in different psychoanalytic journals. The book is divided into three parts, the first being mostly theoretical, the second one clinical, and the third one concerning more general problems. The first four articles contain most of Fairbairn's innovative concepts.  Fairbairn's work was a direct challenge to Freud's model of psychoanalysis, including his theory of psychological development, the functions and dynamics of personality, the origins of psychopathology, and the treatment of disordered individuals. In short, his goal was to replace Freudian metapsychology with his own model as noted by Greenberg and Mitchell: <blockquote>In a series of dense and fertile papers written during the  early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref>.</blockquote>'''Freud's psychoanalytic model''' is a drive/structure  model  in that it  proposes that  human beings are born with innate, biological drives (sex and aggression) that are contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating)  comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society there is immediate conflict. A new structure has to emerge from the Id to insure that the drives continue to be expressed in a way permitted by society. Thus the unconscious Id, which is Freud's metaphor for the package of the (assumed)  biological  drives, is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of the ego. This second structure has the task of mediating  between the primitive Id and society. Later on  in development (via the Oedipal Conflict) the child internalizes the values of his parents and these internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures: The Id, Ego and Super Ego, mature, and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make the morally correct choices.         \n\n'''Fairbairn's model''' is a relational/structure model in that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, and not from the pressure exerted by the Id (which does not exist in Fairbairn's metapsychology). The human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. Internal ego structures can be understood to be '''packages of memories''' that coalesce and form internal representations of the '''parents''', of the '''child''' himself, and of the child's relationship to them. Fairbairn's structural theory develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's under developed central ego to remember.  Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy his necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In primitive families where punishment is frequent, the child can be overwhelmed by parental aggression and faces the loss of his sense of self, as described by Bromberg in the following quote.     <blockquote>Psychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. ..At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n\n     </blockquote>Over time, these dissociated events, including those where the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process). Thus the human psyche is structured over time based on split off traumas that are unavailable to the individual's central ego. This is a very different structural model when compared to Freud's. In Fairbairn's model the  unconscious is ''developed'' (not inherited) from parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n=== Schizoid Factors in the Personality  (1940) ===\nFairbairn's first paper introduced his observation that many of his patient's appeared to be \"schizoid\" a condition that he defined as being a direct result of having splits in their ego structure. He noted that these patients had three observable characteristics.<blockquote>These are:\n (1) an attitude of omnipotence, \n(2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, \n(3) a preoccupation with inner reality....\nSo as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn,1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref>      </blockquote>He noted that the schizoid condition was due to split off (dissociated) interpersonal experiences which were unknown to the conscious \"central ego\".  The schizoid style of relating (or rather, non-relating) to others originated from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love during his developmental years. The schizoid was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving  emotions,  and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdrew into his inner world which is safer, but ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out in bold and uncompromising manner as the following quote illustrates:<blockquote>Regressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel \n(a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and \n(b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. \nThis is a highly traumatic situation  giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that...he tends to retain his love inside of himself. \n(c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious, (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18)<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>\nThus Fairbairn saw that the lack of love in a young child's life was traumatic, and also caused splits in his ego. Typically, Fairbairn waited until later in his writing to inform the reader how and why certain material was deleted from the child's memory by dissociation, as the first four papers exposed his thought processes as he worked on and developed his full theory.\n\n=== A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941) ===\nFairbairn gradually formed his model in these first four papers. He  challenged Freud drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, this shift in focus was too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian, there were no other options, and Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an interesting intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become more powerful than Libido Theory.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation) from the parent because of the development of a mature, reality based central ego in the child.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized \n(a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and \n(b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" />\n<br /></blockquote>\nThus, the developmental process requires that the individual no longer sees himself as part of his mother, but rather as an independent, fully functioning person. The problem lies in the reality that many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily, as Fairbairn noted in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance \n(a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and \n(b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. \nIt is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nFairbairn's language is a bit overwrought, but in essence he says that the dependent child cannot mature without being sure that his parents love and support him, which gives him enough courage to let them go and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, or nearby,  trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Innovative concepts==\n\n===The object-seeking libido===\nOne of the most important contributions of Fairbairn to the psychoanalytic paradigm is proposing an alternative viewpoint regarding the libido. Whereas [[Freud]] assumed that the [[libido]] is pleasure seeking, Fairbairn thought of the libido as object seeking.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Peter Fuller|last=Fuller|first=Peter | title=Introduction to \"Psychoanalysis and after\" | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fairbairn|first=W.

The first connections a child makes are with his parents. Through diverse forms of contact between the child and his parents, a bond between them is formed. When the bond is formed, the child becomes strongly attached to his parents. This early relationship shapes the emotional life of the child in such a strong way that it determines the emotional experiences that the child will have later on in life, because the early libidinal objects become the prototypes for all later experience of connection with others.\n\n===Internal object relations===\nFairbairn states that the [[object relations]] a child has very early on in life become the child's prototypes for all later experiences regarding connections with others. The internal [[object relations|object relation]] describes a relation which exists in the person's mind. In the normal situation, healthy parenting results in a child with an outward orientation towards real people, who can give real contact and exchange. When the needs of the child are not met by the parents (e.g. [[dependency need]]s and the need for affirmative interactions) a pathological turning away from external reality takes place. Instead of actual exchange with others, fantasised, private presences are established, the so-called internal objects. To these internal objects the child relates in fantasised connections, the internal object relations.\n\n===The splitting of the ego===\n{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}\nFairbairn recognized that  children are  totally and absolutely dependent on their parents. Because of this dependency they cannot tolerate \"knowing\" that their parents are indifferent, abandoning, and perhaps even abusive. They solve the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. The defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn had worked in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>as one of his part-time appointments and his experiences with children separated from their families alerted him to the reality that the child's extreme dependency on their parents makes any abandonment a major trauma. The powerful defense called dissociation was needed to erase the event from their consciousness. The memory of the rejecting parent, along with the  memory of the child's response to that parent, are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the child to continue loving a parent that he sees as completely supportive. Once dissociated, these memories of the child in relationship to the parent become internal ego structures over time. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent must be dissociated for if the child were to \"see\" this reality it would destroy his dependency relationship on the parent and he would face an abandonment crisis. In addition to the memories of the rejecting parent (The Rejecting Object in Fairbairn's model) the child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions. Fairbairn called the ego structure that develops from the dissociated memories of  the child's  self  as he reacted to the parent's rejection of him and his legitimate needs, the Antilibidinal Ego. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized rejecting object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden (2018); \n\n\" Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on.The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable.

In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity  to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating of a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis) perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents. These rare supportive interactions are enhanced by fantasy and become a second unconscious view of the parent as loving and supportive. This potentially loving fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the Exciting Object by Fairbairn, and the child's self  that relates to it was called the Libidinal Ego (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly. the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets- the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it,  while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is  always out of reach. \n\nThese two unconscious pairs (The Antilibidinal Ego that relates to the Rejecting Object, and the Libidinal Ego that relates only to the Exciting Object) are unknown to each other and to the Central Ego. Splitting allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole Object. Thus, the individual  never develops \"object constancy\" which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved and the individual functions at an earlier stage of development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects as if they were two different people. When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  Libidinal Ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage and minutes later says \"I love you Mommy\". There is no memory of the other ego state. Equally importantly, powerful, emotional filled memories are dissociated which impoverishes, and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref>\n\n'''Fairbairn's Structural Model'''\n\nEmotional deprivation and the resulting fear of abandonment leads to splitting of the ego and the split ego eventuates into Fairbairn's s Structural Theory. As just described, the psyche is split into three pairs of selves that relate to three separate objects. The three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are unaware of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however it never develops beyond this steady state. As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious central ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's central ego through  daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop  new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with other who see aspects of himself that his parent's have not discovered. \n\nIn  less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance  is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his central ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time,  his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego is losing sight the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  The ratio of conscious to unconscious structures shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the libidinal ego seeking the key to the love that it assumes (incorrectly) is stored in their parent. This powerful unconscious influences the weakened central ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> When any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior  and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html Structural Model]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fairbairn, Ronald}}\n[[Category:1889 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:British psychoanalysts]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychologists]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychiatrists]]\n[[Category:People educated at Merchiston Castle School]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:People from Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Scottish soldiers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War I]]\n[[Category:Analysands of Sigmund Freud]]\n[[Category:Object relations theorists]]\n[[Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=The Illusion Of Love: Why The Battered Woman Returns To Her Abuser|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0231100373|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n{{psychoanalysis}}\n[[File:The Red House, Cluny Gardens.jpg|thumb|Fairbairn's birthplace - The Red House, Cluny Gardens]]\n[[File:Ronald Fairbairn's grave, Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|235px|Ronald Fairbairn's grave, Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh]]\n'''William Ronald Dodds Fairbairn''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|f|\u025b\u0259r|b|\u025b\u0259r|n}}) [[FRSE]] (11 August 1889 \u2013 31 December 1964) was a Scottish psychiatrist, psychoanalyst and a central figure in the development of the [[object relations theory]] of psychoanalysis.\n\n==Life==\nRonald Fairbairn was born at the Red House, Cluny Gardens,<ref>Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1889-90</ref> in [[Morningside, Edinburgh]] in 1889, the only child of Cecilia Leefe and Thomas Fairbairn, a chartered surveyor, and President of the Edinburgh Architectural Association.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40312|title=Fairbairn, (William) Ronald Dodds (1889\u20131964), psychiatrist and psychoanalyst|last=|first=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/40312}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783\u20132002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref> He was educated at [[Merchiston Castle School]] and at the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he studied for three years in [[divinity]] and [[Hellenic Greek]] studies, graduating MA in 1911.\n\nIn the [[First World War]] he joined the [[Royal Engineers]] and served under [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]] in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestinian campaign]], and then the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]].\n\nOn his return to home he began medical training, probably inspired by his war experience.

The book is divided into three parts, the first being mostly theoretical, the second one clinical, and the third one concerning more general problems. The first four articles contain most of Fairbairn's innovative concepts.  Fairbairn's work was a direct challenge to Freud's model of psychoanalysis, including his theory of psychological development, the functions and dynamics of personality, the origins of psychopathology, and the treatment of disordered individuals. In short, his goal was to replace Freudian metapsychology with his own model as noted by Greenberg and Mitchell: <blockquote>In a series of dense and fertile papers written during the  early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref>.</blockquote>'''Freud's psychoanalytic model''' is a drive/structure  model  in that it  proposes that  human beings are born with innate, biological drives (sex and aggression) that are contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating)  comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society there is immediate conflict. A new structure has to emerge from the Id to insure that the drives continue to be expressed in a way permitted by society. Thus the unconscious Id, which is Freud's metaphor for the package of the (assumed)  biological  drives, is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of the ego. This second structure has the task of mediating  between the primitive Id and society. Later on  in development (via the Oedipal Conflict) the child internalizes the values of his parents and these internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures: The Id, Ego and Super Ego, mature, and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make the morally correct choices.         \n\n'''Fairbairn's model''' is a relational/structure model in that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, and not from the pressure exerted by the Id (which does not exist in Fairbairn's metapsychology). The human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. Internal ego structures can be understood to be '''packages of memories''' that coalesce and form internal representations of the '''parents''', of the '''child''' himself, and of the child's relationship to them. Fairbairn's structural theory develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's under developed central ego to remember.  Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy his necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In primitive families where punishment is frequent, the child can be overwhelmed by parental aggression and faces the loss of his sense of self, as described by Bromberg in the following quote.     <blockquote>Psychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. ..At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n\n     </blockquote>Over time, these dissociated events, including those where the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process). Thus the human psyche is structured over time based on split off traumas that are unavailable to the individual's central ego. This is a very different structural model when compared to Freud's. In Fairbairn's model the  unconscious is ''developed'' (not inherited) from parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n=== Schizoid Factors in the Personality  (1940) ===\nFairbairn's first paper introduced his observation that many of his patient's appeared to be \"schizoid\" a condition that he defined as being a direct result of having splits in their ego structure. He noted that these patients had three observable characteristics.<blockquote>These are:\n # an attitude of omnipotence, #an attitude of isolation and detachment and, #a preoccupation with inner reality....\nSo as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn,1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref>      </blockquote>He noted that the schizoid condition was due to split off (dissociated) interpersonal experiences which were unknown to the conscious \"central ego\".  The schizoid style of relating (or rather, non-relating) to others originated from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love during his developmental years. The schizoid was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving  emotions,  and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdrew into his inner world which is safer, but ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out in bold and uncompromising manner as the following quote illustrates:<blockquote>Regressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel # that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and #that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. \nThis is a highly traumatic situation  giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: #the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, #The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that...he tends to retain his love inside of himself. # The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious, (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18)<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>\nThus Fairbairn saw that the lack of love in a young child's life was traumatic, and also caused splits in his ego. Typically, Fairbairn waited until later in his writing to inform the reader how and why certain material was deleted from the child's memory by dissociation, as the first four papers exposed his thought processes as he worked on and developed his full theory.\n\n=== A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941) ===\nFairbairn gradually formed his model in these first four papers. He  challenged Freud drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless,it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress,the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, this shift in focus was too great for the analytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian, there were no other options, and Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an interesting intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become more powerful than Libido Theory.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation) from the parent because of the development of a mature, reality based central ego in the child.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" />\n<br /></blockquote>\nThus, the developmental process requires that the individual no longer sees himself as part of his mother, but rather as an independent, fully functioning person. The problem lies in the reality that many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily, as Fairbairn noted in one of his most famous quotes.<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nFairbairn's language is a bit overwrought, but in essence he says that the dependent child cannot mature without being sure that his parents love and support him, which gives him enough courage to let them go and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, or nearby,  trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Innovative concepts==\n\n===The object-seeking libido===\nOne of the most important contributions of Fairbairn to the psychoanalytic paradigm is proposing an alternative viewpoint regarding the libido. Whereas [[Freud]] assumed that the [[libido]] is pleasure seeking, Fairbairn thought of the libido as object seeking.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Peter Fuller|last=Fuller|first=Peter | title=Introduction to \"Psychoanalysis and after\" | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fairbairn|first=W.

The first connections a child makes are with his parents. Through diverse forms of contact between the child and his parents, a bond between them is formed. When the bond is formed, the child becomes strongly attached to his parents. This early relationship shapes the emotional life of the child in such a strong way that it determines the emotional experiences that the child will have later on in life, because the early libidinal objects become the prototypes for all later experience of connection with others.\n\n===Internal object relations===\nFairbairn states that the [[object relations]] a child has very early on in life become the child's prototypes for all later experiences regarding connections with others. The internal [[object relations|object relation]] describes a relation which exists in the person's mind. In the normal situation, healthy parenting results in a child with an outward orientation towards real people, who can give real contact and exchange. When the needs of the child are not met by the parents (e.g. [[dependency need]]s and the need for affirmative interactions) a pathological turning away from external reality takes place. Instead of actual exchange with others, fantasised, private presences are established, the so-called internal objects. To these internal objects the child relates in fantasised connections, the internal object relations.\n\n===The splitting of the ego===\n{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}\nFairbairn recognized that  children are  totally and absolutely dependent on their parents. Because of this dependency they cannot tolerate \"knowing\" that their parents are indifferent, abandoning, and perhaps even abusive. They solve the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. The defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn had worked in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>as one of his part-time appointments and his experiences with children separated from their families alerted him to the reality that the child's extreme dependency on their parents makes any abandonment a major trauma. The powerful defense called dissociation was needed to erase the event from their consciousness. The memory of the rejecting parent, along with the  memory of the child's response to that parent, are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the child to continue loving a parent that he sees as completely supportive. Once dissociated, these memories of the child in relationship to the parent become internal ego structures over time. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent must be dissociated for if the child were to \"see\" this reality it would destroy his dependency relationship on the parent and he would face an abandonment crisis. In addition to the memories of the rejecting parent (The Rejecting Object in Fairbairn's model) the child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions. Fairbairn called the ego structure that develops from the dissociated memories of  the child's  self  as he reacted to the parent's rejection of him and his legitimate needs, the Antilibidinal Ego. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized rejecting object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden (2018); \n\n\" Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on.The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable.

In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity  to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating of a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis) perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents. These rare supportive interactions are enhanced by fantasy and become a second unconscious view of the parent as loving and supportive. This potentially loving fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the Exciting Object by Fairbairn, and the child's self  that relates to it was called the Libidinal Ego (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly. the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets- the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it,  while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is  always out of reach. \n\nThese two unconscious pairs (The Antilibidinal Ego that relates to the Rejecting Object, and the Libidinal Ego that relates only to the Exciting Object) are unknown to each other and to the Central Ego. Splitting allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole Object. Thus, the individual  never develops \"object constancy\" which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved and the individual functions at an earlier stage of development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects as if they were two different people. When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  Libidinal Ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage and minutes later says \"I love you Mommy\". There is no memory of the other ego state. Equally importantly, powerful, emotional filled memories are dissociated which impoverishes, and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref>\n\n'''Fairbairn's Structural Model'''\n\nEmotional deprivation and the resulting fear of abandonment leads to splitting of the ego and the split ego eventuates into Fairbairn's s Structural Theory. As just described, the psyche is split into three pairs of selves that relate to three separate objects. The three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are unaware of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however it never develops beyond this steady state. As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious central ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's central ego through  daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop  new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with other who see aspects of himself that his parent's have not discovered. \n\nIn  less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance  is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his central ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time,  his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego is losing sight the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  The ratio of conscious to unconscious structures shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the libidinal ego seeking the key to the love that it assumes (incorrectly) is stored in their parent. This powerful unconscious influences the weakened central ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> When any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior  and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html Structural Model]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fairbairn, Ronald}}\n[[Category:1889 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:British psychoanalysts]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychologists]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychiatrists]]\n[[Category:People educated at Merchiston Castle School]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:People from Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Scottish soldiers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War I]]\n[[Category:Analysands of Sigmund Freud]]\n[[Category:Object relations theorists]]\n[[Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Markewilliams", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWork:formatting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fairbairn"}
