The season officially began on 15&nbsp;November, however, the formation of the first system&mdash;Zone of Disturbed Weather 01&mdash;occurred on 22&nbsp;July 2019, well before the official start of the season. It will end on 30 April 2020, with the exception of [[Mauritius]] and the [[Seychelles]], for which it will end on 15 May 2020. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical and subtropical cyclones form in the basin, which is west of [[longitude|90\u00b0E]] and south of the [[Equator]]. Tropical and subtropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the [[Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre]] in [[R\u00e9union]].\n\nFor the second consecutive year in a row, the first system formed before the official start of the season. Afterwards, two storms formed in the month of December: [[Cyclone Belna]] on 2 December, which brought flooding and strong wind to northwestern [[Madagascar]], as well as Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Ambali, which formed a day later. Ambali was the first very intense tropical cyclone in the basin since [[Cyclone Fantala|Fantala]] in 2016. \n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\nThe season began with one of the strongest positive phases of the [[Indian Ocean Dipole]] (IOD) in the past 40 years. [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France|M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France R\u00e9union]] expects that the positive anomalies will decay slowly throughout austral summer, having a prominent impact on the cyclone season through mid-February. As a result, storm activity was not forecast to begin until December&mdash;the month in which the monsoonal flow becomes established in the western half of the basin (the dry conditions in the central and eastern Indian Ocean induced by the IOD would prevent typical early-season storms). With warm and wet conditions expected in the western Indian Ocean, cyclone formation is expected to be enhanced west of 70\u00b0E.<ref name=\"mfroutlook\">{{cite report |title=Pr\u00e9vision saisonni\u00e8re d\u2019activit\u00e9 cyclonique dans le Sud-Ouest de l'oc\u00e9an Indien : Saison 2019-2020. |url=http://www.meteofrance.re/documents/3714872/28998514/CP_previ_saison_cyclone_2019-2020.pdf |website=PREVISION SAISONNIERE ACTIVITE CYCLONIQUE SWIO 2019-2020 |publisher=M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France La R\u00e9union |accessdate=6 December 2019 |location=Saint-Denis, R\u00e9union |language=French |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nA near-average eight to eleven storms are expected throughout the course of the season, with the possibility of a higher than average number of these attaining Tropical Cyclone strength with winds of {{convert|120|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} or greater as a result of favorable upper-level divergence in the western region of the basin.

The disturbance failed to organise into a tropical depression and dissipated on 25 July. Tropical activity came to a halt until 2 December when Tropical Disturbance 02 formed. A day later, Tropical Depression 03 formed and was later named Ambali. On 5 December, Tropical Storm Ambali rapidly intensified, becoming the first very intense tropical cyclone since [[Cyclone Fantala|Fantala]] in 2016. Tropical Disturbance 02 then became Belna, and Belna continued to intensify into a Severe Tropical Storm. Belna then intensified into a cyclone, equivalent to a category 3 hurricane before making landfall in northwestern Madagascar as a category 2 hurricane-equivalent storm, leaving significant damages and 9 deaths. In late December, tropical storm Calvinia formed. It persisted into 2020. Activity was quiet for three weeks. On 19 January, a tropical depression formed, but soon dissipated without being named. Two tropical storms formed in late January, Diane and Esami. They also both dissipated without reaching tropical cyclone status. In early February, another tropical depression formed. It eventually intensified into a tropical storm and was named Francisco. Francisco degenerated into a remnant low several days after formation. In mid-February, the storm regenerated into a tropical depression. At the same time, another disturbance formed, and would strengthen into Tropical Storm Gabekile. It wasn't long until Gabekile strengthened into a tropical cyclone. However, it quickly weakened. By 19 February, Gabekile had dissipated. Nearly a month later, Moderate Tropical Storm Herold formed. On 14 March, Herold strengthened into a severe tropical storm. Herold then rapidly intensified to become the season's 2nd Intense Tropical Cyclone.  Shortly after, it rapidly weakened as it moved southwards before dissipating. In early April, Moderate tropical storm Irondro formed.\n\n==Systems==\n===Zone of Disturbed Weather 01===\n{{Infobox tropical cyclone small\n|Basin=SWI\n|Image=01R 2019-07-23 0900Z.jpg\n|Track=01R 2019 track.png\n|Formed=22 July\n|Dissipated=25 July\n|10-min winds=25\n|Pressure=1001\n|Type1=ZODW\n}}\n\nIn mid-July, a broad wind circulation developed over the central Indian Ocean, accompanied by deep [[convection (meteorology)|convection]].

Under neutral conditions, it slowly organized as it moved southwards. The system intensified into a Moderate Tropical Storm on 1 April and was named ''Irondro''. As it moved southwestwards, it rapidly intensified. It was upgraded into a Tropical Cyclone on April 2 and the next day, it further strengthened into an Intense Tropical Cyclone. It continued to strenghen, reaching Intense Tropical Cyclone Status by later that day. An [[Eye (cyclone)|Eye]] began to form as it accelerated southwards anad moved into and area of cooler sea surface temperatures and higher [[wind shear]]. Under these unfavorable conditions, system began weakening, with the JTWC downgrading it to a Category-1 equivalent cyone on April 4 and the MFR downgradind it back to a Tropical cyclone soon afterwards. As it continued to lose strength, it began an [[Extratropical transition]]. It weakened to a Tropical storm on April 5 and the next day, the JTWC issued its final warning on the cyclone and declared it extratropical.  As it moved into the Australian basin, the BOM Australia assumed responsability of the system. {{clear}}\n\n== Storm names ==\nWithin the South-West Indian Ocean, tropical depressions and subtropical depressions that are judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of {{convert|65|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} by the [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center|Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre]] on [[R\u00e9union|La R\u00e9union Island]], France (RSMC La R\u00e9union) are usually assigned a name. However, it is the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centers in Mauritius and Madagascar who name the systems. The Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center in Mauritius names a storm should it intensify into a moderate tropical storm between [[55th meridian east|55\u00b0E]] and [[90th meridian east|90\u00b0E]]. If instead, a cyclone intensifies into a moderate tropical storm between [[30th meridian east|30\u00b0E]] and [[55th meridian east|55\u00b0E]] then the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm.\n\nBeginning from the 2016\u201317 season, name lists within the South-West Indian Ocean will be rotated on a triennial basis. Storm names are only used once, so any storm name used this year will be removed from rotation and replaced with a new name for the 2022\u201323 season.

Ocean cyclone season''' is a current event of the annual cycle of [[tropical cyclone]] and [[subtropical cyclone]] formation. The season officially began on 15&nbsp;November, however, the formation of the first system&mdash;Zone of Disturbed Weather 01&mdash;occurred on 22&nbsp;July 2019, well before the official start of the season. It will end on 30 April 2020, with the exception of [[Mauritius]] and the [[Seychelles]], for which it will end on 15 May 2020. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical and subtropical cyclones form in the basin, which is west of [[longitude|90\u00b0E]] and south of the [[Equator]]. Tropical and subtropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the [[Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre]] in [[R\u00e9union]].\n\nFor the second consecutive year in a row, the first system formed before the official start of the season. Afterwards, two storms formed in the month of December: [[Cyclone Belna]] on 2 December, which brought flooding and strong wind to northwestern [[Madagascar]], as well as Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Ambali, which formed a day later. Ambali was the first very intense tropical cyclone in the basin since [[Cyclone Fantala|Fantala]] in 2016. \n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\nThe season began with one of the strongest positive phases of the [[Indian Ocean Dipole]] (IOD) in the past 40 years. [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France|M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France R\u00e9union]] expects that the positive anomalies will decay slowly throughout austral summer, having a prominent impact on the cyclone season through mid-February. As a result, storm activity was not forecast to begin until December&mdash;the month in which the monsoonal flow becomes established in the western half of the basin (the dry conditions in the central and eastern Indian Ocean induced by the IOD would prevent typical early-season storms).

The disturbance failed to organise into a tropical depression and dissipated on 25 July. Tropical activity came to a halt until 2 December when Tropical Disturbance 02 formed. A day later, Tropical Depression 03 formed and was later named Ambali. On 5 December, Tropical Storm Ambali rapidly intensified, becoming the first very intense tropical cyclone since [[Cyclone Fantala|Fantala]] in 2016. Tropical Disturbance 02 then became Belna, and Belna continued to intensify into a Severe Tropical Storm. Belna then intensified into a cyclone, equivalent to a category 3 hurricane before making landfall in northwestern Madagascar as a category 2 hurricane-equivalent storm, leaving significant damages and 9 deaths. In late December, tropical storm Calvinia formed. It persisted into 2020. Activity was quiet for three weeks. On 19 January, a tropical depression formed, but soon dissipated without being named. Two tropical storms formed in late January, Diane and Esami. They also both dissipated without reaching tropical cyclone status. In early February, another tropical depression formed. It eventually intensified into a tropical storm and was named Francisco. Francisco degenerated into a remnant low several days after formation. In mid-February, the storm regenerated into a tropical depression. At the same time, another disturbance formed, and would strengthen into Tropical Storm Gabekile. It wasn't long until Gabekile strengthened into a tropical cyclone. However, it quickly weakened. By 19 February, Gabekile had dissipated. Nearly a month later, Moderate Tropical Storm Herold formed. On 14 March, Herold strengthened into a severe tropical storm. Herold then rapidly intensified to become the season's 2nd Intense Tropical Cyclone.  Shortly after, it rapidly weakened as it moved southwards before dissipating. In early April, Moderate tropical storm Irondro formed.\n\n==Systems==\n===Zone of Disturbed Weather 01===\n{{Infobox tropical cyclone small\n|Basin=SWI\n|Image=01R 2019-07-23 0900Z.jpg\n|Track=01R 2019 track.png\n|Formed=22 July\n|Dissipated=25 July\n|10-min winds=25\n|Pressure=1001\n|Type1=ZODW\n}}\n\nIn mid-July, a broad wind circulation developed over the central Indian Ocean, accompanied by deep [[convection (meteorology)|convection]].

Under neutral conditions, it slowly organized as it moved southwards. The system intensified into a Moderate Tropical Storm on 1 April and was named ''Irondro''. As it moved southwestwards, it rapidly intensified. It was upgraded into a Tropical Cyclone on April 2 and the next day, it further strengthened into an Intense Tropical Cyclone. It continued to strenghen, reaching Intense Tropical Cyclone Status by later that day. An [[Eye (cyclone)|Eye]] began to form as it accelerated southwards anad moved into and area of cooler sea surface temperatures and higher [[wind shear]]. Under these unfavorable conditions, system began weakening, with the JTWC downgrading it to a Category-1 equivalent cyone on April 4 and the MFR downgradind it back to a Tropical cyclone soon afterwards. As it continued to lose strength, it began an [[Extratropical transition]]. It weakened to a Tropical storm on April 5 and the next day, the JTWC issued its final warning on the cyclone and declared it extratropical.  As it moved into the Australian basin, the BOM Australia assumed responsability of the system. {{clear}}\n\n== Storm names ==\nWithin the South-West Indian Ocean, tropical depressions and subtropical depressions that are judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of {{convert|65|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} by the [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center|Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre]] on [[R\u00e9union|La R\u00e9union Island]], France (RSMC La R\u00e9union) are usually assigned a name. However, it is the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centers in Mauritius and Madagascar who name the systems. The Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center in Mauritius names a storm should it intensify into a moderate tropical storm between [[55th meridian east|55\u00b0E]] and [[90th meridian east|90\u00b0E]]. If instead, a cyclone intensifies into a moderate tropical storm between [[30th meridian east|30\u00b0E]] and [[55th meridian east|55\u00b0E]] then the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm.\n\nBeginning from the 2016\u201317 season, name lists within the South-West Indian Ocean will be rotated on a triennial basis. Storm names are only used once, so any storm name used this year will be removed from rotation and replaced with a new name for the 2022\u201323 season.
