He had lived in a decrepit house in the poor section of his town.\n\nWithers recalled to [[SongFacts]] the original inspiration for the song: <blockquote>\"I bought a little piano and I was sitting there just running my fingers up and down the piano. In the course of doing the music, that phrase crossed my mind, so then you go back and say, 'OK, I like the way that phrase, Lean On Me, sounds with this song.'\" <ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/bill_withers/ |title=Songfacts Interview with Bill Withers |website=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-10}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWithers stated in the same interview that he made an effort to keep the lyrics simple. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSeveral members of the [[Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band|Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band]] were used for the recording session in 1972. A string section was also included as well.\n\nWithers' version is noted for its bridge section: (\"Just call on me, brother\"), as well as the coda section, where the words \u201dcall me\u201d are repeated a total of 14 times, before the song ends on a cadenza on the strings. Several radio stations, as well as the single version, fade out during the repeated coda, due to time limits as well as the repetition of the lyrics. Some radio versions cut the number of \"Call Me's\" to six times before the song's end.\n\npinepples are good.Pineapple, .Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple, Pineapple,\n\n==Track listings==\n'''7-inch single'''\n# \"Lean on Me\" \u2013 3:45\n# \"Better Off Dead\" \u2013 2:13\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1972)\n!Peak<br/>position\n|-\n|Australia<ref name=\"Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992\">{{cite book|title=[[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992]]|last=Kent|first=David|authorlink=David Kent (historian)|publisher=Australian Chart Book, St Ives, N.S.W |year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|24\n|-\n|Canada Top Singles (''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'')<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.7662&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=90ugs3f4f7ud02puqd6m8e23b3 |title=Item Display - RPM - Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226032423/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.7662&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=90ugs3f4f7ud02puqd6m8e23b3 |archive-date=February 26, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|20\n|-\n|UK Singles ([[Official Charts Company]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|-\n|US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Soul Singles]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n|US [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19720722.html|title=Cash Box Top 100 7/22/72|author=|date=|website=tropicalglen.com|accessdate=March 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228163555/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19720722.html|archive-date=February 28, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (2020)\n!Peak<br/>position\n|-\n{{single chart|Switzerland|84|artist=Bill Withers|song=Lean on Me|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1972)\n! scope=\"col\"| Rank\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1972.htm|title=Top 100 Hits of 1972/Top 100 Songs of 1972|author=|date=|website=www.musicoutfitters.com|accessdate=March 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427223218/http://musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1972.htm|archive-date=April 27, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|-\n|US ''Cash Box''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/1972YESP.html|title=Cash Box YE Pop Singles - 1972|website=tropicalglen.com|accessdate=March 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928150812/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/1972YESP.html|archive-date=September 28, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|14\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Certifications==\n{{Certification Table Top}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=United Kingdom|type=single|artist=Bill Withers|title=Lean on Me|award=Silver|relyear=1972|certyear=2018|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=United States|type=single|artist=Bill Withers|title=Lean on Me|award=Gold|relyear=1972|certyear=1972|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}\n{{Certification Table Bottom|nosales=true|streaming=true}}\n\n== Club Nouveau version ==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Lean on Me\n| cover      = LeanOnMeCN.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Club Nouveau]]\n| album      = [[Life, Love & Pain]]\n| released   = {{Start date|1987}}\n| format     =\n| recorded   = 1986\n| studio     =\n| genre      = \n*[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]\n*[[Soul music|soul]]\n*[[funk]]\n*[[new jack swing]]\n| length     = \n*{{Duration|m=6|s=1}} (LP version)\n*{{Duration|m=3|s=58}} (radio edit)\n| label      = [[Warner Bros.

He had lived in a decrepit house in the poor section of his town.\n\nWithers recalled to [[SongFacts]] the original inspiration for the song: <blockquote>\"I bought a little piano and I was sitting there just running my fingers up and down the piano.

A string section was also included as well.\n\nWithers' version is noted for its bridge section: (\"Just call on me, brother\"), as well as the coda section, where the words \u201dcall me\u201d are repeated a total of 14 times, before the song ends on a cadenza on the strings. Several radio stations, as well as the single version, fade out during the repeated coda, due to time limits as well as the repetition of the lyrics. Some radio versions cut the number of \"Call Me's\" to six times before the song's end.\n\n==Personnel==\n* [[Bill Withers]] \u2013 piano, vocals\n* Benorce Blackmon \u2013 guitar\n* Raymond Jackson \u2013 [[Wurlitzer electric piano]], string arrangement\n* Melvin Dunlap \u2013 bass\n* [[James Gadson]] \u2013 drums\n\n==Track listings==\n'''7-inch single'''\n# \"Lean on Me\" \u2013 3:45\n# \"Better Off Dead\" \u2013 2:13\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1972)\n!Peak<br/>position\n|-\n|Australia<ref name=\"Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992\">{{cite book|title=[[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992]]|last=Kent|first=David|authorlink=David Kent (historian)|publisher=Australian Chart Book, St Ives, N.S.W |year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|24\n|-\n|Canada Top Singles (''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'')<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.7662&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=90ugs3f4f7ud02puqd6m8e23b3 |title=Item Display - RPM - Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226032423/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.7662&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=90ugs3f4f7ud02puqd6m8e23b3 |archive-date=February 26, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|20\n|-\n|UK Singles ([[Official Charts Company]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|-\n|US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Soul Singles]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n|US [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19720722.html|title=Cash Box Top 100 7/22/72|author=|date=|website=tropicalglen.com|accessdate=March 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228163555/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19720722.html|archive-date=February 28, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (2020)\n!Peak<br/>position\n|-\n{{single chart|Switzerland|84|artist=Bill Withers|song=Lean on Me|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1972)\n! scope=\"col\"| Rank\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1972.htm|title=Top 100 Hits of 1972/Top 100 Songs of 1972|author=|date=|website=www.musicoutfitters.com|accessdate=March 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427223218/http://musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1972.htm|archive-date=April 27, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|-\n|US ''Cash Box''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/1972YESP.html|title=Cash Box YE Pop Singles - 1972|website=tropicalglen.com|accessdate=March 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928150812/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/1972YESP.html|archive-date=September 28, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|14\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Certifications==\n{{Certification Table Top}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=United Kingdom|type=single|artist=Bill Withers|title=Lean on Me|award=Silver|relyear=1972|certyear=2018|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=United States|type=single|artist=Bill Withers|title=Lean on Me|award=Gold|relyear=1972|certyear=1972|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}\n{{Certification Table Bottom|nosales=true|streaming=true}}\n\n== Club Nouveau version ==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Lean on Me\n| cover      = LeanOnMeCN.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Club Nouveau]]\n| album      = [[Life, Love & Pain]]\n| released   = {{Start date|1987}}\n| format     =\n| recorded   = 1986\n| studio     =\n| genre      = \n*[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]\n*[[Soul music|soul]]\n*[[funk]]\n*[[new jack swing]]\n| length     = \n*{{Duration|m=6|s=1}} (LP version)\n*{{Duration|m=3|s=58}} (radio edit)\n| label      = [[Warner Bros.

ACMC, an affiliate of [[Cleveland Clinic]]<ref>http://my.clevelandclinic.org/default.aspx{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> is a 249-licensed bed hospital with over 108 years of caring for the residents of Northeastern Ohio. ACMC\u2019s history is rooted in community needs and support. \nBuilt in 1904 to deliver care to railroad workers, Ashtabula County Medical Center has evolved from a one-room wood framed building into the county\u2019s only full-service hospital.\n\nThe hospital operates the county's only cardiac catheterization lab, skilled nursing unit and behavioral medicine unit, in addition to a [[sleep disorder]]s lab, as well as many specialized services.  '''''The Ashtabula Clinic''''' is a multi-speciality group physician practice connected to the hospital.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Ashtabula River Railroad Disaster]] on December 29, 1876 was one of the greatest train disasters in American history. The Pacific Express number 5 was traveling through Ashtabula, heading west, during a heavy snowstorm. The iron bridge that carried trains over the \u201cgulf\u201d, a gorge formed by the Ashtabula River, fractured in the center and the eleven cars and 159 passengers plunged seventy feet to the bottom of the gorge. There was no hospital in the county at the time. Residents soon realized that there could be future disasters, as well as other illnesses and injuries in the community \u2013 and that a local hospital was needed. The first hospital in Ashtabula was built just a few hundred yards from the bridge that failed the night of the train disaster.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehman|first=Michele|title=Creating a Healthier Community: The Story of Ashtabula County Medical Center|year=1997|publisher=Heritage Publisher, Inc.|isbn=978-0-929690-32-2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ashtabula General Hospital's first board of trustees.jpg|thumb|left|Ashtabula General Hospital's first board of trustees]] ACMC began as a small emergency hospital used to care for injured railroad workers at the end of 19th century. In 1882, the Ladies Railroad Auxiliary was formed to care for the patients in this temporary hospital. In 1892, the Ladies Hospital League was organized and provided the impetus to establish a proper hospital for the people of Ashtabula. The diligent work of the league was rewarded on Feb. 12, 1902, with the organization of the Ashtabula General Hospital Association. This nonprofit corporation raised $22,538 and, on June 20, 1904, Ashtabula General Hospital opened.\n\nShortly after the Ashtabula General Hospital opened in 1904, young women enteres its nursing-training school. With the increase in the number enrolling by the 1920s, the Amelia E.Lewis Nurses' Home (currently known as the Lewis Building) opened on February 27, 1930. [[File:The Amelia Lewis Nurses Home erected in 1930 (Lewis Building).jpg|thumb|right|The Amelia Lewis Nurses Home erected in 1930, currently used for office building (Lewis Building)]]\n\nIn 1952, a new 150-bed hospital opened. A new wing, built in 1963, brought the hospital up to 226 beds. In 1975, the city celebrated the opening of a new two-story south wing.\n\n[[File:Ashtabula General Hospital dedicated on March 21, 1952.jpg|thumb|left|The new Ashtabula General Hospital dedicated on March 21, 1952]]In 1983, the corporate structure of Ashtabula General Hospital was reorganized, resulting in the establishment of a not-for-profit parent corporation known as Ashtabula Community Health Services. The hospital became a parent-subsidiary structure, changing its name to the Ashtabula County Medical Center. In 1987, the ACMC Foundation, a program designed to help the hospital meet the challenges of the changing conditions in the health care arena, was initiated. The foundation committee members chose services that were not previously available anywhere else in the county as their campaign projects. Those projects have included the Emergency Department\u2019s Fast Track area, a new Behavioral Medicine Unit, renovations of the Maternity Suite and the cardiac catheterization lab.\n\nIn December 2008, ACMC invested $3.5 million to bring the gold standard of diagnosing heart disease \u2013 cardiac catheterization \u2013 to the community by building the Cleveland Clinic Cardiac Catheterization Lab at ACMC - the first Cardiac Catheterization Lab (commonly known as the Cath Lab) in Ashtabula County. ACMC provides OB/GYN care and maternity/birthing services in a newly renovated maternity unit.\n\n==Affiliation==\nIn 1994, Ashtabula County Medical Center affiliated with the renowned Cleveland Clinic to provide anesthesia, radiology, pathology and pain management services. Later that year, ACMC acquired Glenbeigh to ensure alcohol and chemical dependency programs would remain in the county. In 1999, ACMC became an affiliate of the Cleveland Clinic Health System (CCHS).

ACMC, an affiliate of [[Cleveland Clinic]]<ref>http://my.clevelandclinic.org/default.aspx{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> is a 249-licensed bed hospital with over 108 years of caring for the residents of Northeastern Ohio. ACMC\u2019s history is rooted in community needs and support. \nBuilt in 1904 to deliver care to railroad workers, Ashtabula County Medical Center has evolved from a one-room wood framed building into the county\u2019s only full-service hospital.\n\nThe hospital operates the county's only cardiac catheterization lab, skilled nursing unit and behavioral medicine unit, in addition to a [[sleep disorder]]s lab, as well as many specialized services.  '''''The Ashtabula Clinic''''' is a multi-speciality group physician practice connected to the hospital.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Ashtabula River Railroad Disaster]] on December 29, 1876 was one of the greatest train disasters in American history. The Pacific Express number 5 was traveling through Ashtabula, heading west, during a heavy snowstorm. The iron bridge that carried trains over the \u201cgulf\u201d, a gorge formed by the Ashtabula River, fractured in the center and the eleven cars and 159 passengers plunged seventy feet to the bottom of the gorge. There was no hospital in the county at the time. Residents soon realized that there could be future disasters, as well as other illnesses and injuries in the community \u2013 and that a local hospital was needed. The first hospital in Ashtabula was built just a few hundred yards from the bridge that failed the night of the train disaster.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehman|first=Michele|title=Creating a Healthier Community: The Story of Ashtabula County Medical Center|year=1997|publisher=Heritage Publisher, Inc.|isbn=978-0-929690-32-2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ashtabula General Hospital's first board of trustees.jpg|thumb|left|Ashtabula General Hospital's first board of trustees]] ACMC began as a small emergency hospital used to care for injured railroad workers at the end of 19th century. In 1882, the Ladies Railroad Auxiliary was formed to care for the patients in this temporary hospital. In 1892, the Ladies Hospital League was organized and provided the impetus to establish a proper hospital for the people of Ashtabula. The diligent work of the league was rewarded on Feb. 12, 1902, with the organization of the Ashtabula General Hospital Association. This nonprofit corporation raised $22,538 and, on June 20, 1904, Ashtabula General Hospital opened.\n\nShortly after the Ashtabula General Hospital opened in 1904, young women enteres its nursing-training school. With the increase in the number enrolling by the 1920s, the Amelia E.Lewis Nurses' Home (currently known as the Lewis Building) opened on February 27, 1930. [[File:The Amelia Lewis Nurses Home erected in 1930 (Lewis Building).jpg|thumb|right|The Amelia Lewis Nurses Home erected in 1930, currently used for office building (Lewis Building)]]\n\nIn 1952, a new 150-bed hospital opened. A new wing, built in 1963, brought the hospital up to 226 beds. In 1975, the city celebrated the opening of a new two-story south wing.\n\n[[File:Ashtabula General Hospital dedicated on March 21, 1952.jpg|thumb|left|The new Ashtabula General Hospital dedicated on March 21, 1952]]In 1983, the corporate structure of Ashtabula General Hospital was reorganized, resulting in the establishment of a not-for-profit parent corporation known as Ashtabula Community Health Services. The hospital became a parent-subsidiary structure, changing its name to the Ashtabula County Medical Center. In 1987, the ACMC Foundation, a program designed to help the hospital meet the challenges of the changing conditions in the health care arena, was initiated. The foundation committee members chose services that were not previously available anywhere else in the county as their campaign projects. Those projects have included the Emergency Department\u2019s Fast Track area, a new Behavioral Medicine Unit, renovations of the Maternity Suite and the cardiac catheterization lab.\n\nIn December 2008, ACMC invested $3.5 million to bring the gold standard of diagnosing heart disease \u2013 cardiac catheterization \u2013 to the community by building the Cleveland Clinic Cardiac Catheterization Lab at ACMC - the first Cardiac Catheterization Lab (commonly known as the Cath Lab) in Ashtabula County. ACMC provides OB/GYN care and maternity/birthing services in a newly renovated maternity unit.\n\n==Affiliation==\nIn 1994, Ashtabula County Medical Center affiliated with the renowned Cleveland Clinic to provide anesthesia, radiology, pathology and pain management services. Later that year, ACMC acquired Glenbeigh to ensure alcohol and chemical dependency programs would remain in the county. In 1999, ACMC became an affiliate of the Cleveland Clinic Health System (CCHS). Since 2001, the President and CEO of Ashtabula County Medical Center, as well as several key executives, became employed by Cleveland Clinic and have dual accountability to the ACMC Board of Trustees and to Cleveland Clinic leadership.\nACMC merged with The Ashtabula Clinic, a multi-specialty physician practice, in 1995, establishing an integrated physician-hospital delivery system in the county.\n\n==Reputation==\nACMC is the only full-service hospital in Ashtabula County.

Retrieved on: 2010-05-19.</ref> Founder Reverend Thomas Nelson Haskell described it as a coeducational liberal arts college in the tradition of [[Oberlin College]]. Like many U.S. colleges and universities that have endured from the 19th century, it now is secular in outlook, and it retains its liberal arts focus.\n\n[[Cutler Hall]], the college's first building, was completed in 1880 and the first degrees were conferred in 1882.\n\n[[William F. Slocum]], president from 1888 to 1917, oversaw the initial building of the campus, expanded the library and recruited top scholars in a number of fields.<ref name=CChistory/>  In 1930, Shove Chapel was erected by Mr. John Gray, to meet the religious needs of the students (though Colorado College is not religiously affiliated).\n\n[[Katharine Lee Bates]] wrote \"[[America the Beautiful]]\" during her summer teaching position at Colorado College in 1893.\n\n==Academics==\n[[File:Russell T Tutt Science Center.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Russell T. Tutt Science Center at Colorado College]]\nThe college offers more than 80 majors, minors, and specialized programs including: Southwest studies, feminist and gender studies, [[Asian studies]], [[biochemistry]], [[environmental science]], [[neuroscience]], [[Latin American studies]], Russian and Eurasian studies, and American cultural studies, as well as an across-the-curriculum writing program. In addition to its undergraduate programs, the college offers a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree. Tutt Library has approximately half a million bound volumes. In 2012, Colorado College yielded a student-to-faculty ratio of 10:1.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.locatecolleges.com/co/colorado-springs/colorado-college |title=Colorado College |website=locatecolleges.com}}</ref>\n\n===Block plan===\nColorado College follows a unique schedule known as the \"block plan\" in which students study one subject intensively for three-and-a-half-week \"blocks\", followed by a 4.5 day break. The intensity stems from the time commitment (classes meet for a minimum of three hours Monday through Friday) as well as the demand for engaging rapidly with complex content. Advocates say this allows for more lab time, field research, and an intensive hands-on learning experience with fewer distractions. Critics say that this approach to learning does not allow adequate time for students to digest complex topics.\n\nThe block plan epitomizes experiential learning. It is common for classes to take short or extended trips to apply classroom concepts in the real world. Because students only take one course for the duration of the block, professors have the flexibility to develop these types of excursions. For example, a renewable energy course might travel to a local wind farm or a geology class may take a week in Moab, Utah to study geological patterns in the region. A satellite campus in [[Crestone, Colorado]] at the base of the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] known as \"Baca Campus\" offers a retreat destination often utilized by language, philosophy, writing, and religion courses. Baca Campus boasts a lodge, conference center, classroom, restaurant, and student townhouse facilities. Some courses will even spend an entire block immersed in an area of interest. These occur both domestically and internationally.\n\nAfter each block, students are rewarded with 4.5 days off. Most students head off campus, often involving some type of outdoor exploration.\n\nEvery student begins the Colorado College journey with a \"First Year Experience\" course, or FYE. This is a back-to-back block spanning 8 weeks and functions as a freshmen seminar course.\n\nStudents can also take blocks during winter and summer breaks. In January, the college offers \"half blocks,\" an intensive 10-day course fulfilling a half credit. Meanwhile, summer blocks are three weeks long, and there are also graduate blocks of differing lengths. In parallel with the students, professors teach only one block at a time. Classes are generally capped at 25 students to encourage a more personalized academic experience.\n\n===Admissions===\nColorado College is considered a \"most selective school\" by ''U.S. News & World Report''.<ref>{{Cite magazine |year=2016 |title=Colorado College |url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/colorado-college-1347 |magazine=U.S. News & World Report}}</ref>\n\nFor the Class of 2023 (enrolled fall 2019), Colorado College received a record 9,454 applications (an increase of nearly 1,000 applicants over the Class of 2022) and admitted 13.5%, the lowest acceptance rate in the school's history, with 547 incoming students.<ref name=\"Welcome2023\" /> Students of color make up 27 percent of the incoming class, 15 percent are Pell Grant recipients, 9 percent first-generation students, and 9 percent international students.

The college offers a unique alternative for students who wish to design their own major. However, standardized cross-cutting requirements still apply, though these criteria are fairly broad compared to those at comparable colleges.<ref>[https://www.coloradocollege.edu/academics/curriculum/requirements/ Requirements \u2022 Colorado College<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Student Life==\n\n===Extracurriculars===\nThe small campus of 2,000 boasts more than one hundred clubs and student groups, ranging from professional groups, interests clubs, and social groups.

A 'work hard, play hard' motto is commonly referenced on campus. However, 'play' for Colorado College students is distinctive. Many students share a thirst for outdoor exploration, and can be found hiking, biking, climbing, and skiing, among other things. Colorado College's proximity to the Rocky Mountains and several mountain resort communities create an ideal environment for these types of activities. Students are also active in community engagement activities to advance social justice and sustainability.\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Cutler Hall.JPG|thumbnail|left|Cutler Hall, located at 912 North Cascade Avenue, on the Colorado College campus, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

In 1944, [[KRCC]] began as a two-room public address system in the basement of Bemis Hall. Professor Woodson \"Chief\" Tyree, Director of Radio and Drama Department at Colorado College was the founder and inspirational force in the program that one day became KRCC-FM. In 1946, KRCC moved to South Hall (where Packard Hall now stands) on campus where two students, Charles \"Bud\" Edmonds '51, and Margaret Merle-Smith '51, were instrumental in securing a war surplus FM transmitter. KRCC began over the air broadcasting in April 1951 as the first non-commercial educational FM radio station in the state of Colorado.\n\nKRCC broadcasts through a series of eleven transmitters and translators throughout southern Colorado and a portion of northern New Mexico.  KRCC's main transmitter, atop [[Cheyenne Mountain]], broadcasts three separate HD multi-cast channels, including a channel run completely by Colorado College students called the SOCC (Sounds of Colorado College).\n\n==Notable people==\n{{see also| List of Colorado College people}}\n\n===Alumni===\nColorado College's alumni include a [[Nobel Prize]] winner, a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner, 2 [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellows]], 14 [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]], 31 [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholars]], and 68 [[Thomas J.

Retrieved on: 2010-05-19.</ref> Founder Reverend Thomas Nelson Haskell described it as a coeducational liberal arts college in the tradition of [[Oberlin College]]. Like many U.S. colleges and universities that have endured from the 19th century, it now is secular in outlook, and it retains its liberal arts focus.\n\n[[Cutler Hall]], the college's first building, was completed in 1880 and the first degrees were conferred in 1882.\n\n[[William F. Slocum]], president from 1888 to 1917, oversaw the initial building of the campus, expanded the library and recruited top scholars in a number of fields.<ref name=CChistory/>  In 1930, Shove Chapel was erected by Mr. John Gray, to meet the religious needs of the students (though Colorado College is not religiously affiliated).\n\n[[Katharine Lee Bates]] wrote \"[[America the Beautiful]]\" during her summer teaching position at Colorado College in 1893.\n\n==Academics==\n[[File:Russell T Tutt Science Center.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Russell T. Tutt Science Center at Colorado College]]\nThe college offers more than 80 majors, minors, and specialized programs including: Southwest studies, feminist and gender studies, [[Asian studies]], [[biochemistry]], [[environmental science]], [[neuroscience]], [[Latin American studies]], Russian and Eurasian studies, and American cultural studies, as well as an across-the-curriculum writing program. In addition to its undergraduate programs, the college offers a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree. Tutt Library has approximately half a million bound volumes. In 2012, Colorado College yielded a student-to-faculty ratio of 10:1.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.locatecolleges.com/co/colorado-springs/colorado-college |title=Colorado College |website=locatecolleges.com}}</ref>\n\n===Block plan===\nColorado College follows a unique schedule known as the \"block plan\" in which students study one subject intensively for three-and-a-half-week \"blocks\", followed by a 4.5 day break. The intensity stems from the time commitment (classes meet for a minimum of three hours Monday through Friday) as well as the demand for engaging rapidly with complex content. Advocates say this allows for more lab time, field research, and an intensive hands-on learning experience with fewer distractions. Critics say that this approach to learning does not allow adequate time for students to digest complex topics.\n\nThe block plan epitomizes experiential learning. It is common for classes to take short or extended trips to apply classroom concepts in the real world. Because students only take one course for the duration of the block, professors have the flexibility to develop these types of excursions. For example, a renewable energy course might travel to a local wind farm or a geology class may take a week in Moab, Utah to study geological patterns in the region. A satellite campus in [[Crestone, Colorado]] at the base of the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] known as \"Baca Campus\" offers a retreat destination often utilized by language, philosophy, writing, and religion courses. Baca Campus boasts a lodge, conference center, classroom, restaurant, and student townhouse facilities. Some courses will even spend an entire block immersed in an area of interest. These occur both domestically and internationally.\n\nAfter each block, students are rewarded with 4.5 days off. Most students head off campus, often involving some type of outdoor exploration.\n\nEvery student begins the Colorado College journey with a \"First Year Experience\" course, or FYE. This is a back-to-back block spanning 8 weeks and functions as a freshmen seminar course.\n\nStudents can also take blocks during winter and summer breaks. In January, the college offers \"half blocks,\" an intensive 10-day course fulfilling a half credit. Meanwhile, summer blocks are three weeks long, and there are also graduate blocks of differing lengths. In parallel with the students, professors teach only one block at a time. Classes are generally capped at 25 students to encourage a more personalized academic experience.\n\n===Admissions===\nColorado College is considered a \"most selective school\" by ''U.S. News & World Report''.<ref>{{Cite magazine |year=2016 |title=Colorado College |url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/colorado-college-1347 |magazine=U.S. News & World Report}}</ref>\n\nFor the Class of 2023 (enrolled fall 2019), Colorado College received a record 9,454 applications (an increase of nearly 1,000 applicants over the Class of 2022) and admitted 13.5%, the lowest acceptance rate in the school's history, with 547 incoming students.<ref name=\"Welcome2023\" /> Students of color make up 27 percent of the incoming class, 15 percent are Pell Grant recipients, 9 percent first-generation students, and 9 percent international students.

The college offers a unique alternative for students who wish to design their own major. However, standardized cross-cutting requirements still apply, though these criteria are fairly broad compared to those at comparable colleges.<ref>[https://www.coloradocollege.edu/academics/curriculum/requirements/ Requirements \u2022 Colorado College<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Student Life==\n\n===Extracurriculars===\nThe small campus of 2,000 boasts more than one hundred clubs and student groups, ranging from professional groups, interests clubs, and social groups.

A 'work hard, play hard' motto is commonly referenced on campus. However, 'play' for Colorado College students is distinctive. Many students share a thirst for outdoor exploration, and can be found hiking, biking, climbing, and skiing, among other things. Colorado College's proximity to the Rocky Mountains and several mountain resort communities create an ideal environment for these types of activities. Students are also active in community engagement activities to advance social justice and sustainability.\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Cutler Hall.JPG|thumbnail|left|Cutler Hall, located at 912 North Cascade Avenue, on the Colorado College campus, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

The face of campus changed again at the beginning of the 21st century with construction of the Western Ridge Housing Complex, which offers apartment-style living for upper-division students and completion of the Russell T. Tutt Science Center. The east campus has been expanded, and is now home to the Greek Quad and several small residence halls known as \"theme houses.\"\n\nSome of the more recent notable buildings include Tutt Library, designed by [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]] and later expanded and renovated by Pfeiffer Partners to be the largest carbon-neutral academic library in the United States, which received the 2019 [[American Institute of Architects|AIA/ALA Library Building Award]] and a 2019 Architizer A+ Award, Packard Hall of Music and Art, designed by [[Edward Larrabee Barnes]], and the Edith Kinney Gaylord Cornerstone Arts Center, which was designed by [[Antoine Predock]] with input from faculty and students.\n\n[[File:EdithKinneyGaylordCornerstoneArtsBldg-TimothyHursley.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Edith Kinney Gaylord Cornerstone Arts Center at Colorado College]]\n\n===Edith Kinney Gaylord Cornerstone Arts Center===\nColorado College's [[Edith Kinney Gaylord]] Cornerstone Arts Center, completed in 2008 and located at the intersection of a performing arts corridor in Colorado Springs, was designed to foster creativity and interdisciplinary collaboration. It is home to the college's film, drama and dance departments and contains a large theater, several smaller performance spaces, a screening room, the I.D.E.A. Space gallery, and classrooms, among other rooms. The building is also LEED certified.\n\n==Athletics==\n{{see also|Colorado College Tigers|Colorado College Tigers men's ice hockey|Colorado College Tigers football}}\n[[File:Colorado College map.svg|right|200px|thumb|Map of CC]]\nThe school's sports teams are nicknamed the \"Tigers.\"  Colorado College competes at the [[NCAA]] [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] level in all sports except men's [[ice hockey|hockey]], in which it participates in the [[NCAA Division I]] [[National Collegiate Hockey Conference]], and women's soccer, where it competes as an NCAA Division I team in the [[Mountain West Conference]].

In 1944, [[KRCC]] began as a two-room public address system in the basement of Bemis Hall. Professor Woodson \"Chief\" Tyree, Director of Radio and Drama Department at Colorado College was the founder and inspirational force in the program that one day became KRCC-FM. In 1946, KRCC moved to South Hall (where Packard Hall now stands) on campus where two students, Charles \"Bud\" Edmonds '51, and Margaret Merle-Smith '51, were instrumental in securing a war surplus FM transmitter. KRCC began over the air broadcasting in April 1951 as the first non-commercial educational FM radio station in the state of Colorado.\n\nKRCC broadcasts through a series of eleven transmitters and translators throughout southern Colorado and a portion of northern New Mexico.  KRCC's main transmitter, atop [[Cheyenne Mountain]], broadcasts three separate HD multi-cast channels, including a channel run completely by Colorado College students called the SOCC (Sounds of Colorado College).\n\n==Notable people==\n{{see also| List of Colorado College people}}\n\n===Alumni===\nColorado College's alumni include a [[Nobel Prize]] winner, a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner, 2 [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellows]], 14 [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]], 31 [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholars]], and 68 [[Thomas J.

The hospital's original mission was to serve miners and their families with its first 20-bed facility located between Pittsburg, Kansas and [[Frontenac, Kansas]]. After expansion in the 1960s, further growth was impeded by under-mining on the then-current hospital site. A community fundraising drive was initiated, and in 1971, the new five-floor, 188-bed facility at Rouse and Centennial was occupied.<ref>Taken from [http://www.via-christi.org/body.cfm?id=822 hospital web site]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Mt.

Carmel Regional Cancer Center, a facility that has since been designated as a [[Community Cancer Center]] by the [[National Cancer Institute]], the only cancer center in the region to receive the designation.\n\nIn that same year the hospital became a part of the newly formed Via Christi Health System as the healing ministries of its sponsoring organization, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Wichita, Kansas and the [[Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother]], also of Wichita, joined forces.<ref>[http://www.via-christi.org/body.cfm?id=82 Formation of Via Christi Health System] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720131252/http://www.via-christi.org/body.cfm?id=82 |date=July 20, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Mt.

Carmel Hospital===\nMt. Carmel Hospital was founded in 1903 by the [[Sisters of St. Joseph#Wichita|Sisters of St. Joseph]] of [[Wichita, Kansas]] under the direction of Mother Mary Bernard Sheridan,<ref>[http://www.via-christi.org/body.cfm?id=822 About Us]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> incidentally the same year as the founding of [[Pittsburg State University]]. The hospital's original mission was to serve miners and their families with its first 20-bed facility located between Pittsburg, Kansas and [[Frontenac, Kansas]]. After expansion in the 1960s, further growth was impeded by under-mining on the then-current hospital site. A community fundraising drive was initiated, and in 1971, the new five-floor, 188-bed facility at Rouse and Centennial was occupied.<ref>Taken from [http://www.via-christi.org/body.cfm?id=822 hospital web site]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Mt. Carmel Medical Center===\nIn 1995 the first major expansion of the Mt. Carmel Medical Center building came in the form of the Mt. Carmel Regional Cancer Center, a facility that has since been designated as a [[Community Cancer Center]] by the [[National Cancer Institute]], the only cancer center in the region to receive the designation.\n\nIn that same year the hospital became a part of the newly formed Via Christi Health System as the healing ministries of its sponsoring organization, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Wichita, Kansas and the [[Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother]], also of Wichita, joined forces.<ref>[http://www.via-christi.org/body.cfm?id=82 Formation of Via Christi Health System] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720131252/http://www.via-christi.org/body.cfm?id=82 |date=July 20, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Mt. Carmel Regional Medical Center===\nThe name of the hospital was changed to Mt. Carmel Regional Medical Center (MCRMC) in 2001 to reflect the facility's increasing presence as a regional health provider.\n\n===Via Christi Hospital: Pittsburg===\nIn October 2009 Via Christi Health Systems, Mt. Carmel's parent company, announced it would be re-branding MCRMC as Via Christi beginning in 2010, while preserving the historic Mt. Carmel name with a new street address of 1 Mt.
