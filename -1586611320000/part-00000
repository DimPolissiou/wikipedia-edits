After an unsuccessful four-year-old campaign he was retired to stud and became [[Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland|champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1876. He sired the St. Leger winners [[Hawthornden]] and [[Wenlock (horse)|Wenlock]], the dual-[[British Classic Races|Classic]] winners [[Petrarch (horse)|Petrarch]] and [[Jannette]], as well as the champion sire [[Hampton (horse)|Hampton]]. Lord Clifden was purchased by Carnegie Robert John Jervis, 3rd Viscount St Vincent, after his first race and was sold to Thomas Gee as a stallion. As the two and three-year-old he was trained by Edwin Parr, with William Bevill training him for his four-year-old season.\n\n==Background==\nLord Clifden was a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[Colt (horse)|colt]] bred by J.

Hind had purchased The Slave as a [[Yearling (horse)|yearling]] in 1853. She raced as a two-year-old, placing once, before being retired to stud. Two years before the birth of Lord Clifden, she foaled Lady Clifden, a [[filly]] by [[Surplice (horse)|Surplice]]. Lady Clifden went on to win the [[Portland Handicap]] and [[Stewards' Cup (Great Britain)|Stewards' Cup]]. Hind placed Lord Clifden in training with Edwin Parr.<ref name=\"tbheritage1\"/>\n\n==Racing career==\n===1862: Two-year-old season===\nLord Clifden's first race was on 4 June 1862 in the [[Woodcote Stakes]] over three-quarters of a mile at [[Epsom Downs Racecourse|Epsom Downs]]. He was ridden by [[George Fordham]] and started as the 6/4 favourite.<ref name=\"woodcote\">{{cite|title=SPORTING INTELLIGENCE |publisher=Morning Post |date=4 June 1862}}</ref> Despite getting a bad start,<ref>{{cite|title=SPORTING INTELLIGENCE |publisher=London Daily News |date=9 June 1862}}</ref> he took the lead as the field entered straight and won easily by a [[Horse length|length]] and a half from The Orphan.<ref name=\"woodcote\"/> After the Woodcote Stakes Lord Clifden was purchased by Captain Christie for \u00a34,000 and then a few weeks later by Carnegie Robert John Jervis, 3rd Viscount St Vincent, for 5,000 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]].<ref name=\"tbheritage1\"/>\n\nHe didn't run again until September, when he contested the [[Champagne Stakes (Great Britain)|Champagne Stakes]] at [[Doncaster Racecourse|Doncaster]] and started as the odds-on favourite. Fordham held him up at the rear of the field, but had to start riding him before they had turned into the finishing straight. As the six-runner field entered the final furlong Lord Clifden had almost caught leaders Armagnac and Early Purl. He then overtook them inside the last furlong and won by half a length from Armagnac, with Early Purl a further three lengths back in third place.<ref name=\"donny\">{{cite|title=SPORTING INTELLIGENCE |publisher=Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser |date=20 September 1862}}</ref> Two days later Lord Clifden raced in a sweepstakes of \u00a310 each with \u00a3100 added. He got off to a bad start, losing several lengths to the rest of the field as Volturno went into the lead. Lord Clifden closed up on the field as they turned into the straight. At the one-furlong pole Fordham asked him for an effort and stride by stride he caught Bohemia, who was then leading, and just overtook him at the line to win by a head. [[Queen Bertha]] finished third, three lengths behind the front two.<ref name=\"donny\"/>\n\n===1863: Three-year-old season===\n====Epsom Downs====\nOn 20 May 1863, Lord Clifden faced 30 rivals in the [[Epsom Derby|Derby Stakes]] at [[Epsom Downs Racecourse|Epsom Downs]]. Ridden again by George Fordham, he started the race as the 4/1 favourite. Also near the front of the betting were Hospender and Gellie at 9/1 and [[Macaroni (horse)|Macaroni]] and Saccharometer at 10/1. There was a delay to the start of almost one hour after the horses were fifteen minutes late going to post and then there were over thirty false starts. When they finally got under way, Lord Clifden was positioned in about tenth place by Fordham, as Bright Cloud led the field. With one mile still to run Bright Cloud faded and left Donnybrook and Lord Clifden in the lead. The Cloud was in third place until the six-furlong pole, where he swerved and brought down Saccharometer. The incident also caused King of the Vale to unseat his rider and almost brought down Fantastic. As the horses rounded Tattenham Corner, Lord Clifden had a slight lead over Donnybrook, with Tom Fool lying in third. As then entered the finishing straight Donnybrook and Lord Clifden's nearest challengers were Tom Fool and Macaroni.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59793405 |title=EPSOM.\u2014WEDNESDAY, MAY 20TH |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date=18 Jul 1863 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}</ref> Inside the final furlong Macaroni closed down the leader and with Lord Clifden stumbling in the last stride got the better and won by a short-head.<ref name=\"epsom\">{{cite |title=Sporting News |publisher=Dorset County Chronicle |date=28 May 1863}}</ref> Rapid Rhone finished in third place, half a length behind Macaroni and Lord Clifden.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> After the race many people thought that the race was either a [[Tie (draw)|dead heat]] or that Lord Clifden had won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=DSC18750501.2.27 |title=SPORTS AND PASTIMES |publisher=Daily Southern Cross |date=1 May 1875 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}</ref> The following day Lord Clifden turned out for the Great Surrey Foal Stakes, where his only rival was the French horse Jarnicoton.

It was a cloudy day in Paris and there was a large crowd, including the [[Napoleon III|Emperor]] and [[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo|Empress]], [[Fernando II of Portugal|King Fernando of Portugal]] and the [[William, Prince of Orange|Prince of Orange]]. [[La Toucques]], who had won the [[Prix de Diane|Oaks]] and [[Prix du Jockey Club|Derby]] at [[Chantilly Racecourse|Chantilly]], was the 2/1 favourite, with Lord Clifden starting as the second favourite at 7/2. Unlike in the Derby, the horses got away to a good start on the first attempt. Lord Clifden was settled at the rear of the field by jockey [[Tom Chaloner]]. Both La Toucques and Lord Clifden made progress through the pack together and when the field turned into the finishing straight the pair were vying for the lead along with [[The Ranger]] and Saccharometer. However, Lord Clifden was the first one to fade and the finish was fought out between La Toucques and The Ranger. The Ranger won the race by one length from La Toucques, who was two lengths in front of Saccharometer.

Fordham held him up at the rear of the field, but had to start riding him before they had turned into the finishing straight. As the six-runner field entered the final furlong Lord Clifden had almost caught leaders Armagnac and Early Purl. He then overtook them inside the last furlong and won by half a length from Armagnac, with Early Purl a further three lengths back in third place.<ref name=\"donny\">{{cite|title=SPORTING INTELLIGENCE |publisher=Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser |date=20 September 1862}}</ref> Two days later Lord Clifden raced in a sweepstakes of \u00a310 each with \u00a3100 added. He got off to a bad start, losing several lengths to the rest of the field as Volturno went into the lead. Lord Clifden closed up on the field as they turned into the straight. At the one-furlong pole Fordham asked him for an effort and stride by stride he caught Bohemia, who was then leading, and just overtook him at the line to win by a head. [[Queen Bertha]] finished third, three lengths behind the front two.<ref name=\"donny\"/>\n\n===1863: Three-year-old season===\n====Epsom Downs====\nOn 20 May 1863, Lord Clifden faced 30 rivals in the [[Epsom Derby|Derby Stakes]] at [[Epsom Downs Racecourse|Epsom Downs]]. Ridden again by George Fordham, he started the race as the 4/1 favourite. Also near the front of the betting were Hospender and Gellie at 9/1 and [[Macaroni (horse)|Macaroni]] and Saccharometer at 10/1. There was a delay to the start of almost one hour after the horses were fifteen minutes late going to post and then there were over thirty false starts. When they finally got under way, Lord Clifden was positioned in about tenth place by Fordham, as Bright Cloud led the field. With one mile still to run Bright Cloud faded and left Donnybrook and Lord Clifden in the lead. The Cloud was in third place until the six-furlong pole, where he swerved and brought down Saccharometer. The incident also caused King of the Vale to unseat his rider and almost brought down Fantastic. As the horses rounded Tattenham Corner, Lord Clifden had a slight lead over Donnybrook, with Tom Fool lying in third. As then entered the finishing straight Donnybrook and Lord Clifden's nearest challengers were Tom Fool and Macaroni.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59793405 |title=EPSOM.\u2014WEDNESDAY, MAY 20TH |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date=18 Jul 1863 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}</ref> Inside the final furlong Macaroni closed down the leader and with Lord Clifden stumbling in the last stride got the better and won by a short-head.<ref name=\"epsom\">{{cite |title=Sporting News |publisher=Dorset County Chronicle |date=28 May 1863}}</ref> Rapid Rhone finished in third place, half a length behind Macaroni and Lord Clifden.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> After the race many people thought that the race was either a [[Tie (draw)|dead heat]] or that Lord Clifden had won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=DSC18750501.2.27 |title=SPORTS AND PASTIMES |publisher=Daily Southern Cross |date=1 May 1875 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}</ref> The following day Lord Clifden turned out for the Great Surrey Foal Stakes, where his only rival was the French horse Jarnicoton.

It was a cloudy day in Paris and there was a large crowd, including the [[Napoleon III|Emperor]] and [[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo|Empress]], [[Fernando II of Portugal|King Fernando of Portugal]] and the [[William, Prince of Orange|Prince of Orange]]. [[La Toucques]], who had won the [[Prix de Diane|Oaks]] and [[Prix du Jockey Club|Derby]] at [[Chantilly Racecourse|Chantilly]], was the 2/1 favourite, with Lord Clifden starting as the second favourite at 7/2. Unlike in the Derby, the horses got away to a good start on the first attempt. Lord Clifden was settled at the rear of the field by jockey [[Tom Chaloner]]. Both La Toucques and Lord Clifden made progress though the pack together and when the field turned into the finishing straight the pair were vying for the lead along with [[The Ranger]] and Saccharometer. However, Lord Clifden was the first one to fade and the finish was fought out between La Toucques and The Ranger. The Ranger won the race by one length from La Toucques, who was two lengths in front of Saccharometer.

{"title_page": "Cell cycle analysis", "text_new": "'''Cell cycle analysis by DNA content measurement''' is a method that most frequently employs [[flow cytometry]] to distinguish cells in different phases of the [[cell cycle]]. Before analysis, the cells are usually [[wiktionary:Permeabilization|permeabilised]] and treated with a [[fluorescent dye]] that stains [[DNA]] quantitatively, such as [[propidium iodide]] (PI) or 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The fluorescence intensity of the stained cells correlates with the amount of DNA they contain. As the DNA content doubles during the [[S phase]], the DNA content (and thereby intensity of fluorescence) of cells in the [[G0 phase|G<sub>0</sub> phase]] and [[G1 phase|G<sub>1</sub> phase]] (before S), in the S phase, and in the [[G2 phase|G<sub>2</sub> phase]] and [[M phase]] (after S) identifies the cell cycle phase position in the major phases (G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> versus S versus G<sub>2</sub>/M phase) of the cell cycle. The cellular DNA content of individual cells is often plotted as their frequency histogram to provide information about relative frequency (percentage) of cells in the major phases of the cell cycle.\n\nCell cycle anomalies revealed on the DNA content frequency histogram are often observed after different types of cell damage, for example such [[DNA damage]] that interrupts the cell cycle progression at certain [[cell cycle checkpoint|checkpoints]]. Such an arrest of the cell cycle progression can lead either to an effective DNA repair, which may prevent transformation of normal into a cancer cell ([[carcinogenesis]]), or to cell death, often by the mode of [[apoptosis]]. An arrest of cells in G<sub>0</sub> or G<sub>1</sub> is often seen as a result of lack of nutrients (growth factors), for example after [[blood serum|serum]] deprivation.\nCell cycle analysis was first described in 1969 at [[Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]] by a group from the [[University of California]] using the [[Feulgen stain]]ing technique.<ref>{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Van Dilla MA, Trujillo TT, Mullaney PF, Coulter JR | date        = 14 March 1969\n| title       = Cell Microfluorometry: A Method for Rapid Fluorescence Measurement\n| journal     = [[Science (journal)|Science]]\n| volume      = 163\n| issue       = 3872\n| pages       = 1213\u20131214\n| pmid        = 5812751\n| doi         = 10.1126/science.163.3872.1213\n}}\n</ref> The first protocol for cell cycle analysis using propidium iodide staining was presented in 1975 by [[Awtar Krishan]] from [[Harvard Medical School]] and is still widely cited today.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| author      = Krishan A.\n| date        = July 1975\n| title       = Rapid flow cytofluorometric analysis of mammalian cell cycle by propidium iodide staining\n| journal     = [[The Journal of Cell Biology]]\n| volume      = 66\n| issue       = 1\n| pages       = 188\u2013193\n| pmid        = 49354\n| doi         = 10.1083/jcb.66.1.188\n| pmc      = 2109516\n}}\n</ref>\n\n'''Multiparameter analysis of the cell cycle''' includes, in addition to measurement of cellular DNA content, other cell cycle related constituents/features.

From {{PDB|1D30}}.]] Unless staining is performed using [[Hoechst 33342]], the first step in preparing cells for cell cycle analysis is permeabilisation of the cells' [[plasma membrane]]s. This is usually done by incubating them in a [[buffer solution]] containing a mild [[detergent]]<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Vindel\u00f8v LL, Christensen IJ, Nissen NI | date        = March 1983\n| title       = A detergent-trypsin method for the preparation of nuclei for flow cytometric DNA analysis\n| journal     = [[Cytometry (journal)|Cytometry]]\n| volume      = 3\n| issue       = 5\n| pages       = 323\u2013327\n| pmid        = 6188586\n| doi         = 10.1002/cyto.990030503\n}}\n</ref> such as [[Triton X-100]] or [[NP-40]], or by [[Fixation (histology)|fixating]] them in [[ethanol]]. Most fluorescent DNA dyes (one of exceptions is [[Hoechst 33342]]) are not plasma membrane permeant, that is, unable to pass through an intact cell membrane. Permeabilisation is therefore crucial for the success of the next step, the staining of the cells.\n\nPrior to (or during the staining step) the cells are often treated with [[RNase A]] to remove [[RNA]]s. This is important because \ncertain dyes that stain DNA will also stain RNA, thus creating [[Artifact (error)|artefact]]s that would distort the results.

Before analysis, the cells are usually [[wiktionary:Permeabilization|permeabilised]] and treated with a [[fluorescent dye]] that stains [[DNA]] quantitatively, such as [[propidium iodide]] (PI) or 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The fluorescence intensity of the stained cells correlates with the amount of DNA they contain. As the DNA content doubles during the [[S phase]], the DNA content (and thereby intensity of fluorescence) of cells in the [[G0 phase|G<sub>0</sub> phase]] and [[G1 phase|G<sub>1</sub> phase]] (before S), in the S phase, and in the [[G2 phase|G<sub>2</sub> phase]] and [[M phase]] (after S) identifies the cell cycle phase position in the major phases (G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> versus S versus G<sub>2</sub>/M phase) of the cell cycle. The cellular DNA content of individual cells is often plotted as their frequency histogram to provide information about relative frequency (percentage) of cells in the major phases of the cell cycle.\n\nCell cycle anomalies revealed on the DNA content frequency histogram are often observed after different types of cell damage, for example such [[DNA damage]] that interrupts the cell cycle progression at certain [[cell cycle checkpoint|checkpoints]]. Such an arrest of the cell cycle progression can lead either to an effective DNA repair, which may prevent transformation of normal into a cancer cell ([[carcinogenesis]]), or to cell death, often by the mode of [[apoptosis]]. An arrest of cells in G<sub>0</sub> or G<sub>1</sub> is often seen as a result of lack of nutrients (growth factors), for example after [[blood serum|serum]] deprivation.\nCell cycle analysis was first described in 1969 at [[Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]] by a group from the [[University of California]] using the [[Feulgen stain]]ing technique.<ref>{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Van Dilla MA, Trujillo TT, Mullaney PF, Coulter JR | date        = 14 March 1969\n| title       = Cell Microfluorometry: A Method for Rapid Fluorescence Measurement\n| journal     = [[Science (journal)|Science]]\n| volume      = 163\n| issue       = 3872\n| pages       = 1213\u20131214\n| pmid        = 5812751\n| doi         = 10.1126/science.163.3872.1213\n}}\n</ref> The first protocol for cell cycle analysis using propidium iodide staining was presented in 1975 by [[Awtar Krishan]] from [[Harvard Medical School]] and is still widely cited today.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| author      = Krishan A.\n| date        = July 1975\n| title       = Rapid flow cytofluorometric analysis of mammalian cell cycle by propidium iodide staining\n| journal     = [[The Journal of Cell Biology]]\n| volume      = 66\n| issue       = 1\n| pages       = 188\u2013193\n| pmid        = 49354\n| doi         = 10.1083/jcb.66.1.188\n| pmc      = 2109516\n}}\n</ref>\n\n'''Multiparameter analysis of the cell cycle''' includes, in addition to measurement of cellular DNA content, other cell cycle related constituents/features.

This is usually done by incubating them in a [[buffer solution]] containing a mild [[detergent]]<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Vindel\u00f8v LL, Christensen IJ, Nissen NI | date        = March 1983\n| title       = A detergent-trypsin method for the preparation of nuclei for flow cytometric DNA analysis\n| journal     = [[Cytometry (journal)|Cytometry]]\n| volume      = 3\n| issue       = 5\n| pages       = 323\u2013327\n| pmid        = 6188586\n| doi         = 10.1002/cyto.990030503\n}}\n</ref> such as [[Triton X-100]] or [[NP-40]], or by [[Fixation (histology)|fixating]] them in [[ethanol]]. Most fluorescent DNA dyes (one of exceptions is [[Hoechst 33342]]) are not plasma membrane permeant, that is, unable to pass through an intact cell membrane.

This is important because \ncertain dyes that stain DNA will also stain RNA, thus creating [[Artifact (error)|artefact]]s that would distort the results.

In 1873 the concession was altered to give the [[Swiss Central Railway]] the commission to build the railway. For financial reasons in 1876 the Swiss Central Railway requested a deadline extension. On 25 November 1879 the Waldenburgerbahn was founded as a separate company and took over the concession for the railway from Liestal to Waldenburg.\n\nAfter only eight months' construction, the railway opened on 30 October 1880. Seats were provided in second- and third-class carriages. In 1881 the railway served eight stations with four journeys in each direction. The fastest journey over the whole 13&nbsp;km line took 56&nbsp;minutes.\n\nIn 1909 a committee made an application for the construction of and operation of an electric narrow-gauge railway from Waldenburg through Langenbruck to Balsthal, with a connection from St.Wolfgang to M\u00fcmliswil. The outbreak of [[World War I]] stopped plans for the extension of the line, and a 1912 proposal to electrify the line and regauge it to {{track gauge|1000mm|lk=on}} gauge.\n\nOn 26 October 1953 electric operation of the railway began, using 1500 [[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]]. New rolling stock was acquired for this.\n\nThe current rolling stock, consisting of seven [[railcar]]s and 10 [[Control car (rail)|control cars]] was acquired between 1986 and 1993, replacing the 1953 stock.\n\nIn late 2015, the government of [[Basel-Landschaft]] canton approved a plan to convert the line from 750 mm gauge to [[meter gauge]] in 2023.<ref name=\"taut-2016apr\">{{cite web| url=https://www.baselland.ch/politik-und-behorden/landrat-parlament/medienmitteilungen/umspurung-der-waldenburgerbahn| title=Medienmitteilung Umspurung der Waldenburgerbahn| website=Basel Landschaft| date=November 26, 2015| language=de}}</ref>.

In 1873 the concession was altered to give the [[Swiss Central Railway]] the commission to build the railway. For financial reasons in 1876 the Swiss Central Railway requested a deadline extension. On 25 November 1879 the Waldenburgerbahn was founded as a separate company and took over the concession for the railway from Liestal to Waldenburg.\n\nAfter only eight months' construction, the railway opened on 30 October 1880. Seats were provided in second- and third-class carriages. In 1881 the railway served eight stations with four journeys in each direction. The fastest journey over the whole 13&nbsp;km line took 56&nbsp;minutes.\n\nIn 1909 a committee made an application for the construction of and operation of an electric narrow-gauge railway from Waldenburg through Langenbruck to Balsthal, with a connection from St.Wolfgang to M\u00fcmliswil. The outbreak of [[World War I]] stopped plans for the extension of the line, and a 1912 proposal to electrify the line and regauge it to {{track gauge|1000mm|lk=on}} gauge.\n\nOn 26 October 1953 electric operation of the railway began, using 1500 [[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]]. New rolling stock was acquired for this.\n\nThe current rolling stock, consisting of seven [[railcar]]s and 10 [[Control car (rail)|control cars]] was acquired between 1986 and 1993, replacing the 1953 stock.\n\nIn late 2015, the government of [[Basel-Landschaft]] canton approved a plan to convert the line from 750 mm gauge to [[meter gauge]] in 2023.<ref name=\"taut-2016apr\">{{cite web| url=https://www.baselland.ch/politik-und-behorden/landrat-parlament/medienmitteilungen/umspurung-der-waldenburgerbahn| title=Medienmitteilung Umspurung der Waldenburgerbahn| website=Basel Landschaft| date=November 26, 2015| language=de}}</ref>.

The following year, she appeared on ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[The Big Valley]]'' and ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]''. (She was also cast as \"Bonnie Braids\" in a [[Dick Tracy#Live-action television pilot|TV pilot]] version of the comic strip [[Dick Tracy]], but does not actually appear in the program itself, only in the opening credits.) In 1968, she appeared on ''[[It Takes a Thief (1968 TV series)|It Takes a Thief]]'' and ''[[Family Affair]]''; in the latter, she played a terminally ill girl on the episode \"Christmas Came A Little Early\". In 1969, she appeared on an episode of ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1974, Plumb appeared as middle sister Jan Brady in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''. Her featured storylines included Jan's embarrassment over not having a boyfriend, concerns about her future appearance, being a middle child, and her insecurity over wearing glasses. Several episodes centered on Jan's jealousy of older sister [[Marcia Brady|Marcia]], resulting in the famous \"Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!\" line that has arguably become the quintessential quote of the series. Plumb also supplied the voice of Jan in the ABC Saturday morning cartoon ''[[The Brady Kids]]'' from 1972 to 1973. After ''The Brady Bunch'' was canceled in 1974, it went on to even greater success in syndicated reruns. The sitcom has never left the television airwaves and eventually spawned numerous [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], reunion specials, feature films, and parodies.\n\nSeveral episodes of the sitcom featured the Brady kids singing and as a result, Plumb and the rest of the younger cast recorded several albums. Plumb would also provide a monologue for the [[Patrick Williams (composer)|Pat Williams]] Orchestra's 1974 recording of \"California Love Story\". The single was co-produced by Plumb's recording executive father, Neely Plumb.\n\n===1975\u20132000: Other projects and ''Brady Bunch'' reunions===\n[[File:Dawn Portrait of a Teenage Runaway Eve Plumb 1976.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|left|Plumb as the title character in ''[[Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway]]'', 1976]]\nAfter ''The Brady Bunch'' ended, Plumb's first notable role was that of a teenage prostitute in the NBC television movie ''[[Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway]]'' (1976).

The single was co-produced by Plumb's recording executive father, Neely Plumb.\n\n===1975\u20132000: Other projects and ''Brady Bunch'' reunions===\n[[File:Dawn Portrait of a Teenage Runaway Eve Plumb 1976.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|left|Plumb as the title character in ''[[Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway]]'', 1976]]\nAfter ''The Brady Bunch'' ended, Plumb's first notable role was that of a teenage prostitute in the NBC television movie ''[[Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway]]'' (1976).

{"title_page": "Recursive acronym", "text_new": "{{short description|Acronym whose expansion includes a copy of itself}}\nA '''recursive acronym''' is an [[acronym]] that [[recursion|refers to itself]]. The term was first used in print in 1979 in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach|G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'', in which Hofstadter invents the acronym GOD, meaning \"GOD Over Djinn\", to help explain infinite series, and describes it as a recursive acronym.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Summer2009/ABjorndahl/extension.html |title = Puzzles and Paradoxes: Infinity in Finite Terms |accessdate=2013-04-23 }}</ref> Other references followed,<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.wordspy.com/words/recursiveacronym.asp |title = WordSpy \u2013 Recursive Acronym |accessdate=2008-12-18 }}</ref> however the concept was used as early as 1968 in [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]''. In the story, the acronym EPT (Education for Particular Task) later morphed into \"Eptification for Particular Task\".\n\nRecursive acronyms typically form [[Backronym|backwardly]]: either an existing ordinary acronym is given a new explanation of what the letters stand for, or a name is turned into an acronym by giving the letters an explanation of what they stand for, in each case with the first letter standing recursively for the whole acronym.\n\n==Early computer-related examples==\nIn [[computing]], an early tradition in the [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]] community (especially at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]) was to choose acronyms and abbreviations that referred humorously to themselves or to other abbreviations. Perhaps the earliest example in this context \u2013 from 1960 \u2013 is the [[backronym]] \"Mash Until No Good\", which was created to describe [[Mung (computer term)|Mung]], and a while later was revised to \"Mung Until No Good\". It lived on as a recursive command in the editing language [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]].<sup>[[Mung (computer term)|[3]]]</sup> In 1977 or 1978 came TINT (\"TINT Is Not [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]]\"), an editor for [[MagicSix]] written (and named) by Ted Anderson. This inspired the two MIT [[Lisp Machine]] editors called [[EINE]] (\"EINE Is Not [[Emacs]]\", German for ''one'') and [[ZWEI]] (\"ZWEI Was EINE Initially\", German for ''two''). These were followed by [[Richard Stallman]]'s [[GNU]] (GNU's Not [[Unix]]). Many others also include negatives, such as denials that the thing defined is or resembles something else (which the thing defined does in fact resemble or is even derived from), to indicate that, despite the similarities, it was distinct from the program on which it was based.<ref>[http://fsfe.org/freesoftware/transcripts/rms-fs-2006-03-09.en.html#the-name-gnu The Free Software Movement and the Future of Freedom: The name \"GNU\"], Richard Stallman, March 9th 2006</ref>\n\nAn earlier example appears in a 1976 textbook on data structures, in which the pseudo-language SPARKS is used to define the algorithms discussed in the text. \"SPARKS\" is claimed to be a non-acronymic name, but \"several cute ideas have been suggested\" as expansions of the name.

The term was first used in print in 1979 in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach|G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'', in which Hofstadter invents the acronym GOD, meaning \"GOD Over Djinn\", to help explain infinite series, and describes it as a recursive acronym.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Summer2009/ABjorndahl/extension.html |title = Puzzles and Paradoxes: Infinity in Finite Terms |accessdate=2013-04-23 }}</ref> Other references followed,<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.wordspy.com/words/recursiveacronym.asp |title = WordSpy \u2013 Recursive Acronym |accessdate=2008-12-18 }}</ref> however the concept was used as early as 1968 in [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]''. In the story, the acronym EPT (Education for Particular Task) later morphed into \"Eptification for Particular Task\".\n\nRecursive acronyms typically form [[Backronym|backwardly]]: either an existing ordinary acronym is given a new explanation of what the letters stand for, or a name is turned into an acronym by giving the letters an explanation of what they stand for, in each case with the first letter standing recursively for the whole acronym.\n\n==Early computer-related examples==\nIn [[computing]], an early tradition in the [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]] community (especially at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]) was to choose acronyms and abbreviations that referred humorously to themselves or to other abbreviations. Perhaps the earliest example in this context \u2013 from 1960 \u2013 is the [[backronym]] \"Mash Until No Good\", which was created to describe [[Mung (computer term)|Mung]], and a while later was revised to \"Mung Until No Good\". It lived on as a recursive command in the editing language [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]].<sup>[[Mung (computer term)|[3]]]</sup> In 1977 or 1978 came TINT (\"TINT Is Not [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]]\"), an editor for [[MagicSix]] written (and named) by Ted Anderson. This inspired the two MIT [[Lisp Machine]] editors called [[EINE]] (\"EINE Is Not [[Emacs]]\", German for ''one'') and [[ZWEI]] (\"ZWEI Was EINE Initially\", German for ''two''). These were followed by [[Richard Stallman]]'s [[GNU]] (GNU's Not [[Unix]]). Many others also include negatives, such as denials that the thing defined is or resembles something else (which the thing defined does in fact resemble or is even derived from), to indicate that, despite the similarities, it was distinct from the program on which it was based.<ref>[http://fsfe.org/freesoftware/transcripts/rms-fs-2006-03-09.en.html#the-name-gnu The Free Software Movement and the Future of Freedom: The name \"GNU\"], Richard Stallman, March 9th 2006</ref>\n\nAn earlier example appears in a 1976 textbook on data structures, in which the pseudo-language SPARKS is used to define the algorithms discussed in the text. \"SPARKS\" is claimed to be a non-acronymic name, but \"several cute ideas have been suggested\" as expansions of the name.

The American branch of London Records released British Decca records in the U.S. since British Decca could not use the \"Decca\" name there. The label was noted for classical albums made in then state-of-the-art [[stereophonic sound]], and such artists as [[Georg Solti]], [[Joan Sutherland]] and [[Luciano Pavarotti]].\n\nThe London name was also used by British Decca in the UK market for releases taken from American labels which British Decca licensed, such as [[Imperial Records|Imperial]], [[Chess Records|Chess]], [[Dot Records|Dot]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], [[Specialty Records|Specialty]], [[Essex Records|Essex]] and [[Sun Records|Sun]], and the first two UK releases from [[Motown]]. By the 1960s more licensing deals had been made with [[Big Top Records|Big Top]], [[Monument Records|Monument]], [[Parrot Records|Parrot]], [[Philles Records|Philles]], and [[Hi Records|Hi]], and subsidiary labels were London Atlantic, London Dot and London Monument (the last featuring [[Roy Orbison]], who remained with London in the UK even after he signed for [[MGM Records]] in the U.S.).\n\nAn unusual feature was the letter code in the numbering system. From the late 1950s until 1973, the label bore the logo \"London American Recordings\", and on [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] it was known as \"London American\". \n[[File:Stones ad 1965.JPG|thumb|right|160px|1965 London Records trade ad for the Rolling Stones]]\nIn America, the label was best known as the American imprint of the pre\u20131971 recordings of [[the Rolling Stones]] (currently owned by [[ABKCO]]). The label also originally issued some early LPs and singles by Texas-based band [[ZZ Top]] (whose catalog went to Warner Brothers when the band moved there).\n\nIn the late 1970s, London signed deals with [[Bomp! Records]] and with Big Sound in Connecticut, U.S. This changed the label in the eyes of many from a backwater into something a little more \"edgy\" compared to the pedestrian contemporary releases from parent company Decca.\n\nThe president of London Records in the 1970s was D. H. Tollerbond.<ref>''Cat People'', Bill Hayward, introduction by Rogers E. M. Whitaker. New York: Dolphin/Doubleday, 1978 (p. 132)</ref>\n\nAfter British Decca was acquired by [[PolyGram]] in 1979, London followed a more independent course with subsidiary labels such as [[Slash Records|Slash]], [[Pete Tong]]'s [[Essential Records (London)|Essential Records]] and [[FFRR Records|FFRR]].\n\n[[Universal Music Group]] (the owner of American Decca) acquired PolyGram in 1998;[http://www.ftc.gov/os/2001/07/tenorscmp.htm] however, by this time, London Records had become a semi-independent label within the [[PolyGram]] group operated by Roger Ames. In the 1990s Tracy Bennet became President and Colin Bell, Managing Director. When Ames moved to the [[Warner Music Group]], he took the label with him, and so almost all of London's recent back catalogue was acquired by Warner, which also acquired the London name and trademark from Decca [http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ohim?ohimnum=E3038437] (which still owns pre-1979 back catalogue). The name is still used, mainly for UK-based artists, and for ex-[[Factory Records]] artists. Notable artists released by that incarnation of London, called London Records 90, include [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Happy Mondays]], [[A (band)|A]], and [[Shakespears Sister]].\n\nAfter PolyGram took over British Decca, classical-music albums recorded by British Decca continued to be released on the London label in the U.S., with a logo similar to the Decca classical label logo, until American Decca owner Universal bought British Decca owner PolyGram in 1998, after which they were all reissued on the original British Decca label in the U.S.\n\nThe London pop music catalogue owned by Universal Music is now managed by [[Polydor Records]], with US distribution handled by [[Mercury Records]].\nDecca Records had a recording studio in Blomfield Road, West London; there may have been another in London's West End. In 2010, Universal Music reclaimed ownership of the London Records trademark.

marketed records in the United States, Canada, and Latin America for [[Decca Records]] from 1947 to 1979 before becoming semi-independent.\n\n==History==\n[[File:LondonRecordsLogo.jpg|left|thumb|158px|[[Gramophone record|Gramophone]] era logo]]\nLondon arose from the split in ownership between the British and American branches of [[Decca Records]]. The American branch of London Records released British Decca records in the U.S. since British Decca could not use the \"Decca\" name there. The label was noted for classical albums made in then state-of-the-art [[stereophonic sound]], and such artists as [[Georg Solti]], [[Joan Sutherland]] and [[Luciano Pavarotti]].\n\nThe London name was also used by British Decca in the UK market for releases taken from American labels which British Decca licensed, such as [[Imperial Records|Imperial]], [[Chess Records|Chess]], [[Dot Records|Dot]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], [[Specialty Records|Specialty]], [[Essex Records|Essex]] and [[Sun Records|Sun]], and the first two UK releases from [[Motown]]. By the 1960s more licensing deals had been made with [[Big Top Records|Big Top]], [[Monument Records|Monument]], [[Parrot Records|Parrot]], [[Philles Records|Philles]], and [[Hi Records|Hi]], and subsidiary labels were London Atlantic, London Dot and London Monument (the last featuring [[Roy Orbison]], who remained with London in the UK even after he signed for [[MGM Records]] in the U.S.).\n\nAn unusual feature was the letter code in the numbering system. From the late 1950s until 1973, the label bore the logo \"London American Recordings\", and on [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] it was known as \"London American\". \n[[File:Stones ad 1965.JPG|thumb|right|160px|1965 London Records trade ad for the Rolling Stones]]\nIn America, the label was best known as the American imprint of the pre\u20131971 recordings of [[the Rolling Stones]] (currently owned by [[ABKCO]]). The label also originally issued some early LPs and singles by Texas-based band [[ZZ Top]] (whose catalog went to Warner Brothers when the band moved there).\n\nIn the late 1970s, London signed deals with [[Bomp! Records]] and with Big Sound in Connecticut, U.S. This changed the label in the eyes of many from a backwater into something a little more \"edgy\" compared to the pedestrian contemporary releases from parent company Decca.\n\nThe president of London Records in the 1970s was D. H. Tollerbond.<ref>''Cat People'', Bill Hayward, introduction by Rogers E. M. Whitaker. New York: Dolphin/Doubleday, 1978 (p. 132)</ref>\n\nAfter British Decca was acquired by [[PolyGram]] in 1979, London followed a more independent course with subsidiary labels such as [[Slash Records|Slash]], [[Pete Tong]]'s [[Essential Records (London)|Essential Records]] and [[FFRR Records|FFRR]].\n\n[[Universal Music Group]] (the owner of American Decca) acquired PolyGram in 1998;[http://www.ftc.gov/os/2001/07/tenorscmp.htm] however, by this time, London Records had become a semi-independent label within the [[PolyGram]] group operated by Roger Ames. In the 90's Tracy Bennet became President and Colin Bell, Managing Director. When Ames moved to the [[Warner Music Group]], he took the label with him, and so almost all of London's recent back catalogue was acquired by Warner, which also acquired the London name and trademark from Decca [http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ohim?ohimnum=E3038437] (which still owns pre-1979 back catalogue). The name is still used, mainly for UK-based artists, and for ex-[[Factory Records]] artists. Notable artists released by that incarnation of London, called London Records 90, include [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Happy Mondays]], [[A (band)|A]], and [[Shakespears Sister]].\n\nAfter PolyGram took over British Decca, classical-music albums recorded by British Decca continued to be released on the London label in the U.S., with a logo similar to the Decca classical label logo, until American Decca owner Universal bought British Decca owner PolyGram in 1998, after which they were all reissued on the original British Decca label in the U.S.\n\nThe London pop music catalogue owned by Universal Music is now managed by [[Polydor Records]], with US distribution handled by [[Mercury Records]].\nDecca Records had a recording studio in Blomfield Road, West London; there may have been another in London's West End. In 2010, Universal Music reclaimed ownership of the London Records trademark. Even Universal Music again owned this trademark, Warner Music Group licensed it to be used on its reissues of London's catalogue controlled by Warner Records 90 company. On 1 July 2011 Universal Music reclaimed the London Records name and relaunched it under the executive team of [[Nick Raphael]] (president) and later [[Jo Charrington]] (senior vice president of A&amp;R) who together previously ran Epic Records for [[Sony Music Entertainment]] since 2001.

The series features performances by established and up-and-coming spoken word poets. Performances also include special appearances by well-known actors and musicians, as well as occasional performances by Mos Def himself. Co-created by [[Bruce George (Genius Is Common)|Bruce George]], [[Danny Simmons]], Cameron Caldwell, Deborah Pointer, [[Stan Lathan]], and [[Russell Simmons]], the show is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the popular ''[[Def Comedy Jam]]'' which began airing on HBO in the 1990s. As with ''Def Comedy'', Simmons appears at the end of every episode to thank the audience.\n\nThe series included historical legendary poets such as, The Last Poets, Nikki Giovanni, [[Amiri Baraka]] and Sonya Sanchez.  It also featured poets, [[Saul Williams]], [[J. Ivy]], Jessica Care-Moore and Lemon. Though technically not a [[poetry slam]], ''Def Poetry'' has become heavily associated with the [[poetry slam]] movement, and utilizes many of [[poetry slam]]'s best known poets, including National Poetry Slam champions such as [[Beau Sia]], [[Taylor Mali]], [[Big Poppa E]], [[Mayda del Valle]], [[Mighty Mike McGee|Mike Mcgee]], [[Alix Olson]] and [[Rives (poet)|Rives]], among others. Even poets who are critical of the [[poetry slam]], such as [[John S. Hall]], have acknowledged slam's influence on the show. In a 2005 interview, Hall was quoted as saying:\n\n{{quote|It's true that I was on ''Def Poetry'' even though I've never slammed. I'm probably the only person to be on there who hasn't slammed. And I think most people on ''Def Poetry'' have won slams or done well in slams. And, all of them, except the special guest stars, the celebrities, are writing slam poems and performing slam poems on ''Def Poetry'', so to me, ''Def Poetry'' is still extremely slam-informed, and I think it will probably always be. What they say about ''Def Poetry'' is that it wants to bring an urban feel. And to me, they don't mean black or Latino, or non-white. What they really mean is, a rhythm of poetry that comes out of the [[Nuyorican Poets Cafe]], that came out of the slams.<ref name=\"wiyf1\">Aptowicz, Cristin O'Keefe. (2008).

[[Soft Skull Press]], 288. {{ISBN|1-933368-82-9}}.</ref>}}\n\nIn a 2005 interview, [[Bob Holman]], who founded the [[Nuyorican Poets Cafe]]'s [[poetry slam]] and appeared on Season 4 of the show, applauded ''Def Poetry'', noting:\n\n{{quote|I'm real happy poetry is on television. My hat is off to Russell Simmons, who has found a way to get poems on HBO in a way that feeds his own business. It gives him the back credentials for his hip-hop label, and at the same time he's magnanimous towards the art of poetry, giving us a place like that. It's a great, great moment, just as ''Def Poetry Jam on Broadway'' was a great moment, too. Not since [[Ntozake Shange]]'s ''[[For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf]]'' has a poem like that been on the stage.<ref name=\"wiyf2\">Aptowicz, Cristin O'Keefe.

Smith decries the intense commercialization of the poetry slam, and refers to Def Poetry as \"an exploitive entertainment [program that] diminished the value and aesthetic of performance poetry.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vocalo.org/explore/content/28448 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718155042/http://vocalo.org/explore/content/28448 |archivedate=2011-07-18 }}</ref>\n\nIn November 2002, a live stage production, ''Russell Simmons Def Poetry Jam'', opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Directed by [[Stan Lathan]], the show featured poets [[Beau Sia]], [[Suheir Hammad]], [[Staceyann Chin]], [[Lemon (poet)|Lemon]], [[Mayda del Valle]], [[Georgia Me]], Black Ice, [[Poetri Smith]], and Steve Coleman. The show ran on Broadway until May 2003, and won a 2003 [[Tony Award]] for Best Special Theatrical Event.<ref name=\"Tonys2003\">[https://www.nytimes.com/ref/arts/theater/12TONY-LIST.html  ''New York Times'' List of 2003 Tony Award Winners].</ref> The show subsequently toured both nationally and internationally.\n\n''Def Poetry'' premiered on HBO in 2002 and the latest season to air (Season 6) premiered in February 2007. As of summer 2008, there has been no word about the possibility of a Season 7. Starting in 2008, producers of ''Def Poetry'' (including Simmons, [[Stan Lathan]], and [[Kamilah Forbes]]) developed and broadcast the HBO poetry show ''[[Brave New Voices]]'', which is stylistically similar to ''Def Poetry'', with teenage poets competing and backstage scenes.<ref>http://www.hbo.com/bravenewvoices/crew/index.html</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Episode index ==\n\n===Season 1 (2002)===\n\n====Episode 1====\n*Steve Colman \u2013 I Wanna Hear a Poem\n*Georgia Me \u2013 Full Figure Potential\n* [[Benjamin Bratt]] \u2013 Lower East Side\n*Lemon \u2013 Shine\n*Nikki Giovanni \u2013 Talk to Me Poem, I Think I've Got the Blues\n*Black Ice \u2013 Bigger Than Mine?\n*Suheir Hammad \u2013 First Writing Since\n\n====Episode 2====\n*Taylor Mali \u2013 What Teachers Make\n*Yellow Rage \u2013 Listen Asshole\n* [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] \u2013 Poem Song\n*Flow Mentalz \u2013 They Call Me Drama\n*Sonia Sanchez \u2013 Poem to Some Women\n*Shihan \u2013 This Type Love\n*Dawn Saylor \u2013 When I Was 14\n*Kayo \u2013 Who Am I?\n\n====Episode 3====\n* [[Cedric the Entertainer]] \u2013 Untitled\n* [[Sarah Jones (stage actress)|Sarah Jones]] \u2013 Your Revolution\n* [[Beau Sia]] \u2013 Give Me a Chance\n* [[Willie Perdomo]] \u2013 How Beautiful We Really Are\n*Abyss \u2013 God Gave Me Grey Skies\n* [[The Last Poets]] \u2013 Take Your Time\n*[[IN-Q]] \u2013 When Hip-Hop Was Fun\n* [[J.

The series features performances by established and up-and-coming spoken word poets. Performances also include special appearances by well-known actors and musicians, as well as occasional performances by Mos Def himself. Co-created by [[Bruce George (Genius Is Common)|Bruce George]], [[Danny Simmons]], Cameron Caldwell, Deborah Pointer, [[Stan Lathan]], and [[Russell Simmons]], the show is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the popular ''[[Def Comedy Jam]]'' which began airing on HBO in the 90's. As with ''Def Comedy'', Simmons appears at the end of every episode to thank the audience.\n\nThe series included historical legendary poets such as, The Last Poets, Nikki Giovanni, [[Amiri Baraka]] and Sonya Sanchez.  It also featured poets, [[Saul Williams]], [[J. Ivy]], Jessica Care-Moore and Lemon. Though technically not a [[poetry slam]], ''Def Poetry'' has become heavily associated with the [[poetry slam]] movement, and utilizes many of [[poetry slam]]'s best known poets, including National Poetry Slam champions such as [[Beau Sia]], [[Taylor Mali]], [[Big Poppa E]], [[Mayda del Valle]], [[Mighty Mike McGee|Mike Mcgee]], [[Alix Olson]] and [[Rives (poet)|Rives]], among others. Even poets who are critical of the [[poetry slam]], such as [[John S. Hall]], have acknowledged slam's influence on the show. In a 2005 interview, Hall was quoted as saying:\n\n{{quote|It's true that I was on ''Def Poetry'' even though I've never slammed. I'm probably the only person to be on there who hasn't slammed. And I think most people on ''Def Poetry'' have won slams or done well in slams. And, all of them, except the special guest stars, the celebrities, are writing slam poems and performing slam poems on ''Def Poetry'', so to me, ''Def Poetry'' is still extremely slam-informed, and I think it will probably always be. What they say about ''Def Poetry'' is that it wants to bring an urban feel. And to me, they don't mean black or Latino, or non-white. What they really mean is, a rhythm of poetry that comes out of the [[Nuyorican Poets Cafe]], that came out of the slams.<ref name=\"wiyf1\">Aptowicz, Cristin O'Keefe. (2008).

Hall Takes on Everything Rights But Mostly Wrong With the Slam. [[Soft Skull Press]], 288. {{ISBN|1-933368-82-9}}.</ref>}}\n\nIn a 2005 interview, [[Bob Holman]], who founded the [[Nuyorican Poets Cafe]]'s [[poetry slam]] and appeared on Season 4 of the show, applauded ''Def Poetry'', noting:\n\n{{quote|I'm real happy poetry is on television. My hat is off to Russell Simmons, who has found a way to get poems on HBO in a way that feeds his own business. It gives him the back credentials for his hip-hop label, and at the same time he's magnanimous towards the art of poetry, giving us a place like that. It's a great, great moment, just as ''Def Poetry Jam on Broadway'' was a great moment, too. Not since [[Ntozake Shange]]'s ''[[For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf]]'' has a poem like that been on the stage.<ref name=\"wiyf2\">Aptowicz, Cristin O'Keefe.

Soft Skull Press, 288. {{ISBN|1-933368-82-9}}.</ref>}}\n\nHowever, [[Marc Smith (American poet)|Marc Smith]], the founder of the Poetry Slam movement, is more critical of the program. Smith decries the intense commercialization of the poetry slam, and refers to Def Poetry as \"an exploitive entertainment [program that] diminished the value and aesthetic of performance poetry.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vocalo.org/explore/content/28448 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718155042/http://vocalo.org/explore/content/28448 |archivedate=2011-07-18 }}</ref>\n\nIn November 2002, a live stage production, ''Russell Simmons Def Poetry Jam'', opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Directed by [[Stan Lathan]], the show featured poets [[Beau Sia]], [[Suheir Hammad]], [[Staceyann Chin]], [[Lemon (poet)|Lemon]], [[Mayda del Valle]], [[Georgia Me]], Black Ice, [[Poetri Smith]], and Steve Coleman. The show ran on Broadway until May 2003, and won a 2003 [[Tony Award]] for Best Special Theatrical Event.<ref name=\"Tonys2003\">[https://www.nytimes.com/ref/arts/theater/12TONY-LIST.html  ''New York Times'' List of 2003 Tony Award Winners].</ref> The show subsequently toured both nationally and internationally.\n\n''Def Poetry'' premiered on HBO in 2002 and the latest season to air (Season 6) premiered in February 2007. As of summer 2008, there has been no word about the possibility of a Season 7. Starting in 2008, producers of ''Def Poetry'' (including Simmons, [[Stan Lathan]], and [[Kamilah Forbes]]) developed and broadcast the HBO poetry show ''[[Brave New Voices]]'', which is stylistically similar to ''Def Poetry'', with teenage poets competing and backstage scenes.<ref>http://www.hbo.com/bravenewvoices/crew/index.html</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Episode index ==\n\n===Season 1 (2002)===\n\n====Episode 1====\n*Steve Colman \u2013 I Wanna Hear a Poem\n*Georgia Me \u2013 Full Figure Potential\n* [[Benjamin Bratt]] \u2013 Lower East Side\n*Lemon \u2013 Shine\n*Nikki Giovanni \u2013 Talk to Me Poem, I Think I've Got the Blues\n*Black Ice \u2013 Bigger Than Mine?\n*Suheir Hammad \u2013 First Writing Since\n\n====Episode 2====\n*Taylor Mali \u2013 What Teachers Make\n*Yellow Rage \u2013 Listen Asshole\n* [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] \u2013 Poem Song\n*Flow Mentalz \u2013 They Call Me Drama\n*Sonia Sanchez \u2013 Poem to Some Women\n*Shihan \u2013 This Type Love\n*Dawn Saylor \u2013 When I Was 14\n*Kayo \u2013 Who Am I?\n\n====Episode 3====\n* [[Cedric the Entertainer]] \u2013 Untitled\n* [[Sarah Jones (stage actress)|Sarah Jones]] \u2013 Your Revolution\n* [[Beau Sia]] \u2013 Give Me a Chance\n* [[Willie Perdomo]] \u2013 How Beautiful We Really Are\n*Abyss \u2013 God Gave Me Grey Skies\n* [[The Last Poets]] \u2013 Take Your Time\n*[[IN-Q]] \u2013 When Hip-Hop Was Fun\n* [[J.

All the songs in this round are themed, so the contestants might need to identify two songs written by the same songwriter, or recall what song was at number two in the charts when another was at number one. The teams must rely on their music memory to answer quickly enough. The first two teams to give five correct answers progress through to round two.\n* '''Round two''' \u2013 The two remaining teams must identify a range of song titles and artists by listening to the very beginning of the songs and recognising them before the time runs out. The teams are given visual clues to help them, such as a map showing where the singer is originally from, or an image of a famous person who is mentioned in the song lyrics. Each team must work against the clock to ensure their time doesn\u2019t run out. The first team to run out of time will be eliminated.\n* '''Round three \u2013 The Final Chart Rundown''' \u2013 This round sees the final team attempting to recognise ten songs and artists before the money runs out. The team will start the round with \u00a310,000 available in their pot of money, but after five seconds of each track that is played, the money starts to drop.

All the songs in this round are themed, so the contestants might need to identify two songs written by the same songwriter, or recall what song was at number two in the charts when another was at number one. The teams must rely on their music memory to answer quickly enough. The first two teams to give five correct answers progress though to round two.\n* '''Round two''' \u2013 The two remaining teams must identify a range of song titles and artists by listening to the very beginning of the songs and recognising them before the time runs out. The teams are given visual clues to help them, such as a map showing where the singer is originally from, or an image of a famous person who is mentioned in the song lyrics. Each team must work against the clock to ensure their time doesn\u2019t run out. The first team to run out of time will be eliminated.\n* '''Round three \u2013 The Final Chart Rundown''' \u2013 This round sees the final team attempting to recognise ten songs and artists before the money runs out. The team will start the round with \u00a310,000 available in their pot of money, but after five seconds of each track that is played, the money starts to drop. If the team can correctly name ten song titles and artists before the money disappears, they will go home with whatever is left in the pot.\n\n==Transmissions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Cook]]. Cook worked in India during the 1920s through the 1940s. After some attempts to begin a Pentecostal work in northern parts of India, Cook realized that there were ancient Christian communities in southern India, especially in [[Kerala]]. After arriving in Kerala, he fell in love with the land and the people. He crossed paths with a man named [[Kalloor Chacko]], of Thrikkannamangal, Kottarakara. While a prominent figure in the [[Brethren Church]] in India, Chacko accepted the teachings of Cook regarding the work of the Holy Spirit. The two joined hands to establish the first registered Pentecostal church in India. It was named the Church of God. Cook, meanwhile, joined the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee). The two built the first church building on land set aside by Chacko.\n\nA number of early leaders, including Rev. K. E. Abraham, worked hand in hand with Cook to establish numerous works in various parts of Kerala. As time went by, disagreements over doctrine and organizational structure led to many of these early leaders parting ways. Disagreement with Chacko also resulted in Cook relocating the headquarters to [[Mulakuzha]]. The founder of the [[Ceylon Pentecostal Mission]] Rev. Ramankutty, later known as Pastor Paul, also worked with Cook for some time before starting off on his own path.\n\nEarly leaders that worked with Cook in building up the Church of God in its early days in Mulakuzha include Rev. T.M. Varghese and Rev. U. Thomas. When laws were passed that forbade foreign missionaries in India, it was T.M. Varghese that served as the Field Secretary. When the church had developed to the point that it was granted its own leadership, Rev. U. Thomas served as the first Overseer.\n\nThe Church was divided into three districts. These included [[Kerala]] State, [[Tamil Nadu]] and Central Region. Kerala State was later divided into two at the request of the brothers of low [[caste]] backgrounds. The new region was named Kerala Division and is now named Kerala Region, with headquarters in Kottayam. The region of [[Andra Pradesh]] was included. The work that was started and run by Rev. Samuel John was incorporated into the Church as the Northern Region. In the 1990s, under the leadership of Rev. K M Thankachan, the Central Region was divided into two regions with [[Bombay|Mumbai]] as the headquarters of the Western Region and [[Kolkata]] as the headquarters of the Eastern Region. There are many departments now under the Church. They provide and undertake many activities for the believers.\n\n=== Kerala ===\nHeadquartered in [[Mulakuzha]], Kerala\n\n=== Tamil Nadu ===\nHeadquartered in [[Chennai]], Tamil Nadu\n\n=== Western Region ===\nHeadquartered in [[Mumbai]], Maharashtra\n\n=== Eastern Region ===\nHeadquartered in [[Kolkata]], West Bengal\n\n=== Northern Region ===\nHead quarters in Chandigarh\nAddress: Church of God in India, Sector 41B, Opp. Krishna Market, Chandigarh - 160 036.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)]]\n* [[Ceylon Pentecostal Mission]]\n* [[Assemblies of God]]\n* [[India Pentecostal Church of God]]\n*\n\n[[Category:Pentecostal denominations in Asia]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=May 2018}}\nThe '''Church of God (Full Gospel)''' in [[India]] is the registered name of the branch in India of the [[Church of God (Cleveland)|Church of God]] (Cleveland, Tennessee, USA).\n\n== Beginnings ==\nThe work of the Church of God was started in India by the American missionary [[Robert F.
