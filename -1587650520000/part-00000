To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore.

Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore. Ruth enters the vacant hotel room and steals part of the $8 million Marty is supposed to launder. Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago. Agent Roy Petty decides to follow Marty to the Ozarks, convinced he is somehow involved.

Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop with Marty as an investor. Roy also convinces Russ to say he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty. Cade tells Ruth not to visit him again unless Marty is dead. After returning home, Charlotte goes for a night swim. Ignoring Marty's advice to stay near the shore, she swims far into the lake.

Roy pressures Rachel for useful information, including pretending to be a Blue Cat bar customer. Rachel has bathroom sex with a bar pickup and calls him Marty to irritate Roy, who is monitoring her transmitter. To deflect Marty's suspicion from her, Rachel suggests the man from the Blue Cat (Roy) might be a police officer. An infuriated Roy threatens her with a violent end if she does not produce evidence. The Byrdes' planned bribe of a state gaming official ends when Wendy correctly suspects a trap. Wendy tries to provide money to Mason, who angrily refuses.

Roy makes Ruth look like an informant, and Helen asks the Byrdes whether she can be trusted. Marty hesitates before saying yes, then races to the Langmores to warn Ruth. Ruth admits she tried to kill Marty, but says she will not try again because circumstances have changed, so he vouches for her to Helen, but Helen's associates subject Ruth to [[waterboarding]] interrogation. Ruth does not crack, and Helen tells Marty she is impressed with Ruth's willpower. Marty reminds Wendy that she cheated on him, and Charlotte overhears and informs Jonah.

Marty and the Snells disinter several Snell ancestors and use their remains to replace the bones the FBI found, throwing off the test results and enabling Jacob to claim authorities desecrated his family's ancient burial places. Roy interrogates Wilkes, who offers to inform on Marty in exchange for Wendy's protection, but she refuses to leave Marty. Ruth agrees to help her father with his illegal activities, deciding that working with Marty will not produce the long term benefits she hoped for.

The API is typically used to interact with a [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU), to achieve [[Hardware acceleration|hardware-accelerated]] [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]].\n\n[[Silicon Graphics, Inc.]] (SGI) began developing OpenGL in 1991 and released it on June 30, 1992;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sgi.com/products/software/opengl/overview.html|title=SGI \u2013 OpenGL Overview|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041031094901/http://www.sgi.com/products/software/opengl/overview.html|archivedate=October 31, 2004|access-date=February 16, 2007|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"g926\">{{cite web|last1=Peddie|first1=Jon|title=Who's the Fairest of Them All?|url=http://www.cgw.com/Publications/CGW/2012/Volume-35-Issue-4-June-July-2012/Who-s-the-Fairest-of-Them-All-.aspx|publisher=Computer Graphics World|accessdate=May 30, 2018|date=July 2012}}</ref> applications use it extensively in the fields of [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), [[virtual reality]], [[scientific visualization]], information visualization, [[Flight simulator|flight simulation]], and [[video game]]s. Since 2006, OpenGL has been managed by the [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] technology [[consortium]] [[Khronos Group]].\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Pipeline OpenGL.svg|thumb|An illustration of the graphics pipeline process]]\nThe OpenGL specification describes an abstract [[application programming interface|API]] for drawing 2D and 3D graphics. Although it is possible for the API to be implemented entirely in software, it is designed to be implemented mostly or entirely [[Hardware acceleration|in hardware]].\n\nThe API is defined as a set of [[Subroutine|functions]] which may be called by the client program, alongside a set of [[Enumerated type|named integer constants]] (for example, the constant GL_TEXTURE_2D, which corresponds to the [[decimal]] number 3553). Although the function definitions are superficially similar to those of the programming language [[C (programming language)|C]], they are language-independent. As such, OpenGL has many [[language binding]]s, some of the most noteworthy being the [[JavaScript]] binding [[WebGL]] (API, based on [[OpenGL ES 2.0]], for 3D rendering from within a [[web browser]]); the C bindings [[WGL (software)|WGL]], [[GLX]] and [[Core OpenGL|CGL]]; the C binding provided by [[iOS]]; and the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and C bindings provided by [[Android (operating system)|Android]].\n\nIn addition to being language-independent, OpenGL is also cross-platform. The specification says nothing on the subject of obtaining, and managing an OpenGL context, leaving this as a detail of the underlying [[windowing system]]. For the same reason, OpenGL is purely concerned with rendering, providing no APIs related to input, audio, or windowing.\n\n===Development===\nOpenGL is an evolving API. New versions of the OpenGL specifications are regularly released by the [[Khronos Group]], each of which extends the API to support various new features. The details of each version are decided by consensus between the Group's members, including graphics card manufacturers, operating system designers, and general technology companies such as [[Mozilla]] and [[Google]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khronos.org/members/ |title=Khronos Membership Overview and FAQ |publisher=Khronos.org |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the features required by the core API, [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU) vendors may provide additional functionality in the form of ''extensions''. Extensions may introduce new functions and new constants, and may relax or remove restrictions on existing OpenGL functions. Vendors can use extensions to expose custom APIs without needing support from other vendors or the Khronos Group as a whole, which greatly increases the flexibility of OpenGL. All extensions are collected in, and defined by, the OpenGL Registry.<ref name=\"OpenGLRegistryRoot\">{{cite web|url=https://khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/index_gl.php |title=Khronos OpenGL Registry |publisher=Khronos Group |accessdate=July 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\nEach extension is associated with a short identifier, based on the name of the company which developed it. For example, [[Nvidia]]'s identifier is NV, which is part of the extension name <code>GL_NV_half_float</code>, the constant <code>GL_HALF_FLOAT_NV</code>, and the function <code>glVertex2hNV()</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/NV/NV_half_float.txt |title=NV_half_float |website=OpenGL Registry |publisher=Khronos Group}}</ref> If multiple vendors agree to implement the same functionality using the same API, a shared extension may be released, using the identifier EXT. In such cases, it could also happen that the Khronos Group's Architecture Review Board gives the extension their explicit approval, in which case the identifier ARB is used.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/docs/rules.html |title=How to Create Khronos API Extensions |publisher=Khronos Group |accessdate=July 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe features introduced by each new version of OpenGL are typically formed from the combined features of several widely implemented extensions, especially extensions of type ARB or EXT.\n\n==Documentation==\nOpenGL's popularity is partially due to the quality of its official documentation.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The OpenGL Architecture Review Board released a series of manuals along with the specification which have been updated to track changes in the API. These are commonly referred to by the colors of their covers:\n\n;The Red Book\n:OpenGL Programming Guide, 9th Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-134-49549-1|}}\n:The Official Guide to Learning OpenGL, Version 4.5 with SPIR-V\n;The Orange Book\n:OpenGL Shading Language, 3rd edition. {{ISBN|0-321-63763-1|}}\n:A tutorial and reference book for [[GLSL]].\n\nHistoric books (pre-OpenGL 2.0):\n\n;The Green Book\n:OpenGL Programming for the X Window System. {{ISBN|978-0-201-48359-8}}\n:A book about X11 interfacing and [[OpenGL Utility Toolkit]] (GLUT).\n;The Blue Book\n:OpenGL Reference manual, 4th edition. {{ISBN|0-321-17383-X}}\n:Essentially a hard-copy printout of the [[Unix manual]] (man) pages for OpenGL.\n:Includes a poster-sized fold-out diagram showing the structure of an idealised OpenGL implementation.\n;The Alpha Book (white cover)\n:OpenGL Programming for Windows 95 and Windows NT. {{ISBN|0-201-40709-4}}\n:A book about interfacing OpenGL with Microsoft Windows.\n\n==Associated libraries==\nThe earliest versions of OpenGL were released with a companion library called the [[OpenGL Utility Library]] (GLU). It provided simple, useful features which were unlikely to be supported in contemporary hardware, such as [[Tessellation (computer graphics)|tessellating]], and generating [[mipmap]]s and [[Geometric primitive|primitive shapes]]. The GLU specification was last updated in 1998 and depends on OpenGL features which are now [[deprecation|deprecated]].\n\n===Context and window toolkits===\nGiven that creating an OpenGL context is quite a complex process, and given that it varies between [[operating system]]s, automatic OpenGL context creation has become a common feature of several game-development and user-interface [[Library (computing)|libraries]], including [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]], [[Allegro (software)|Allegro]], [[SFML]], [[FLTK]], and [[Qt (software)|Qt]]. A few libraries have been designed solely to produce an OpenGL-capable window. The first such library was [[OpenGL Utility Toolkit]] (GLUT), later superseded by [[freeglut]]. [[GLFW]] is a newer alternative.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/windowtoolkits/ |title=A list of GLUT alternatives, maintained by |publisher=Khronos Group |date= |accessdate=May 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n* These toolkits are designed to create and manage OpenGL windows, and manage input, but little beyond that.<ref>{{cite web|title=Related toolkits and APIs|url=https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Related_toolkits_and_APIs#Context.2FWindow_Toolkits|website=www.opengl.org|publisher=OpenGL|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref>\n:* [[GLFW]] \u2013 A cross-platform windowing and keyboard-mouse-joystick handler; is more game-oriented\n:* [[freeglut]] \u2013 A cross-platform windowing and keyboard-mouse handler; its API is a superset of the GLUT API, and it is more stable and up to date than GLUT\n:* [[OpenGL Utility Toolkit]] (GLUT) \u2013 An old windowing handler, no longer maintained.\n* Several \"multimedia libraries\" can create OpenGL windows, in addition to input, sound and other tasks useful for game-like applications\n:* [[Allegro (software)|Allegro 5]] \u2013 A cross-platform multimedia library with a C API focused on game development\n:* [[Simple DirectMedia Layer]] (SDL) \u2013 A cross-platform multimedia library with a C API\n:* [[SFML]] \u2013 A cross-platform multimedia library with a C++ API and multiple other bindings to languages such as C#, Java, Haskell, and Go\n* Widget toolkits\n:* [[FLTK]] \u2013 A small cross-platform C++ widget library\n:* [[Qt (software)|Qt]] \u2013 A cross-platform C++ widget toolkit. It provides many OpenGL helper objects, which even abstract away the difference between desktop GL and OpenGL ES\n:* [[wxWidgets]] \u2013 A cross-platform C++ widget toolkit\n\n===Extension loading libraries===\nGiven the high workload involved in identifying and loading OpenGL extensions, a few libraries have been designed which load all available extensions and functions automatically. Examples include [[OpenGL Easy Extension library|GLEE]], [[OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library|GLEW]] and [[glbinding]]. Extensions are also loaded automatically by most language bindings, such as [[Java OpenGL|JOGL]] and [[PyOpenGL]].\n\n===Implementations===\n[[Mesa (computer graphics)|Mesa 3D]] is an [[Open-source software|open-source]] implementation of OpenGL. It can do pure software rendering, and it may also use hardware acceleration on [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], [[Linux]], and other platforms by taking advantage of the [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure]]. As of version 13.0, it implements version 4.5 of the OpenGL standard.\n\n==History==\nIn the 1980s, developing software that could function with a wide range of graphics hardware was a real challenge. Software developers wrote custom interfaces and drivers for each piece of hardware. This was expensive and resulted in multiplication of effort.\n\nBy the early 1990s, [[Silicon Graphics]] (SGI) was a leader in 3D graphics for workstations. Their [[IRIS GL]] API<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/~wimmer/apis/API_Summary.html|title= IRIS GL, SGI's property}}</ref> was considered state-of-the-art{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} and became the de facto industry standard, overshadowing the open standards-based [[PHIGS]]. This was because IRIS GL was considered easier to use, and because it supported [[Immediate mode (computer graphics)|immediate mode]] rendering. By contrast, PHIGS was considered difficult to use and outdated in functionality.\n\nSGI's competitors (including [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[IBM]]) were also able to bring to market 3D hardware supported by extensions made to the PHIGS standard, which pressured SGI to open source a version of IrisGL as a public standard called '''OpenGL'''.\n\nHowever, SGI had many customers for whom the change from IrisGL to OpenGL would demand significant investment. Moreover, IrisGL had API functions that were irrelevant to 3D graphics. For example, it included a windowing, keyboard and mouse API, in part because it was developed before the [[X Window System]] and Sun's [[NeWS]]. And, IrisGL libraries were unsuitable for opening due to licensing and patent issues{{Elucidate|reason=What patent issues?|date=September 2016}}. These factors required SGI to continue to support the advanced and proprietary [[Open Inventor|Iris Inventor]] and [[Iris Performer]] programming APIs while market support for OpenGL matured.\n\nOne of the restrictions of IrisGL was that it only provided access to features supported by the underlying hardware. If the graphics hardware did not support a feature natively, then the application could not use it. OpenGL overcame this problem by providing software implementations of features unsupported by hardware, allowing applications to use advanced graphics on relatively low-powered systems. OpenGL standardized access to hardware, pushed the development responsibility of hardware interface programs ([[device driver]]s) to hardware manufacturers, and delegated windowing functions to the underlying operating system. With so many different kinds of graphics hardware, getting them all to speak the same language in this way had a remarkable impact by giving software developers a higher level platform for 3D-software development.\n\nIn 1992,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sgi.com/company_info/newsroom/press_releases/2004/august/opengl.html|title=Creation of the OpenGL ARB|access-date=February 16, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222123208/http://www.sgi.com/company_info/newsroom/press_releases/2004/august/opengl.html|archive-date=February 22, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> SGI led the creation of the [[OpenGL Architecture Review Board]] (OpenGL ARB), the group of companies that would maintain and expand the OpenGL specification in the future.\n\nIn 1994, SGI played with the idea of releasing something called \"[[OpenGL++]]\" which included elements such as a scene-graph API (presumably based on their [[Performer (Computer Graphics API)|Performer]] technology). The specification was circulated among a few interested parties \u2013 but never turned into a product.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opengl.org/archives/about/arb/meeting_notes/notes/Meeting1.2/meeting_note_10-03-98.html|title=End of OpenGL++|publisher=Khronos Group}}</ref>\n\n[[Microsoft]] released [[Direct3D]] in 1995, which eventually became the main competitor of OpenGL.

Since then, OpenGL has occasionally been extended by releasing a new version of the specification. Such releases define a baseline set of features which all conforming graphics cards must support, and against which new extensions can more easily be written. Each new version of OpenGL tends to incorporate several extensions which have widespread support among graphics-card vendors, although the details of those extensions may be changed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+OpenGL version history\n!Version\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 10em;\" | Release Date\n!Features\n|-\n|1.1\n|March 4, 1997\n|Texture objects\n|-\n|1.2\n|March 16, 1998\n|3D textures, BGRA and [[packed pixel]] formats,<ref name=\"Gamedev1929\">{{cite news|url=https://www.gamedev.net/articles/programming/graphics/moving-beyond-opengl-11-for-windows-r1929/|title=Moving Beyond OpenGL 1.1 for Windows|last=Astle|first=Dave|date=April 1, 2003|work=gamedev.net|accessdate=November 15, 2007}}</ref> introduction of the ''imaging subset'' useful to image-processing applications\n|-\n|1.2.1\n|October 14, 1998\n|A concept of ARB extensions\n|-\n|1.3\n|August 14, 2001\n|[[Texture mapping|Multitexturing]], multisampling, texture compression\n|-\n|1.4\n|July 24, 2002\n|Depth textures, GLSlang<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=npmdCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA191|title=Simulaci\u00f3n visual de materiales : teor\u00eda, t\u00e9cnicas, an\u00e1lisis de casos|last=Isorna|first=J.M.|publisher=Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya|year=2015|isbn=978-84-9880-564-2|series=UPC Grau.

Most of these were, at the time, rejected by the ARB or otherwise never came to fruition in the form that 3Dlabs proposed. However, their proposal for a C-style shading language was eventually completed, resulting in the current formulation of the OpenGL Shading Language ([[GLSL]] or GLslang). Like the assembly-like shading languages it was replacing, it allowed replacing the fixed-function vertex and fragment pipe with [[shader]]s, though this time written in a C-like high-level language.\n\nThe design of GLSL was notable for making relatively few concessions to the limits of the hardware then available. This hearkened back to the earlier tradition of OpenGL setting an ambitious, forward-looking target for 3D accelerators rather than merely tracking the state of currently available hardware. The final OpenGL 2.0 specification<ref>{{cite web|url=https://khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec20.pdf|title=The OpenGL Graphics System|type=Specification|version=2.0|date=October 22, 2004}}</ref> includes support for GLSL.\n\n===Longs Peak and OpenGL 3.0===\nBefore the release of OpenGL 3.0, the new revision had the codename [[Longs Peak]]. At the time of its original announcement, Longs Peak was presented as the first major API revision in OpenGL's lifetime. It consisted of an overhaul to the way that OpenGL works, calling for fundamental changes to the API.\n\nThe draft introduced a change to object management. The GL 2.1 object model was built upon the state-based design of OpenGL. That is, to modify an object or to use it, one needs to bind the object to the state system, then make modifications to the state or perform function calls that use the bound object.\n\nBecause of OpenGL's use of a state system, objects must be mutable. That is, the basic structure of an object can change at any time, even if the rendering pipeline is asynchronously using that object. A texture object can be redefined from 2D to 3D. This requires any OpenGL implementations to add a degree of complexity to internal object management.\n\nUnder the Longs Peak API, object creation would become [[Linearizability|atomic]], using templates to define the properties of an object which would be created with one function call. The object could then be used immediately across multiple threads. Objects would also be immutable; however, they could have their contents changed and updated. For example, a texture could change its image, but its size and format could not be changed.\n\nTo support backwards compatibility, the old state based API would still be available, but no new functionality would be exposed via the old API in later versions of OpenGL. This would have allowed legacy code bases, such as the majority of [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] products, to continue to run while other software could be written against or ported to the new API.\n\nLongs Peak was initially due to be finalized in September 2007 under the name OpenGL 3.0, but the Khronos Group announced on October 30 that it had run into several issues that it wished to address before releasing the specification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=229374#Post229374|title=OpenGL ARB announces an update on OpenGL 3.0|date=October 30, 2007|accessdate=October 31, 2007}}</ref> As a result, the spec was delayed, and the Khronos Group went into a [[media blackout]] until the release of the final OpenGL 3.0 spec.\n\nThe final specification proved far less revolutionary than the Longs Peak proposal. Instead of removing all immediate mode and fixed functionality (non-shader mode), the spec included them as deprecated features. The proposed object model was not included, and no plans have been announced to include it in any future revisions. As a result, the API remained largely the same with a few existing extensions being promoted to core functionality.\n\nAmong some developer groups this decision caused something of an uproar,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/08/11/2135259 |title=OpenGL 3.0 Released, Developers Furious \u2013 Slashdot |publisher=Tech.slashdot.org |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> with many developers professing that they would switch to [[DirectX]] in protest. Most complaints revolved around the lack of communication by Khronos to the development community and multiple features being discarded that were viewed favorably by many. Other frustrations included the requirement of DirectX 10 level hardware to use OpenGL 3.0 and the absence of geometry shaders and instanced rendering as core features.\n\nOther sources reported that the community reaction was not quite as severe as originally presented,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opengl.org/news/opengl_bof_went_over_well_no_pitch_forks_seen|title=OpenGL BOF went over well, no pitch forks seen}}</ref> with many vendors showing support for the update.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opengl.org/news/nick_haemel_amd_blog_post_opengl_30_a_big_step_in_the_right_direction/ |title=The Industry Standard for High Performance Graphics |publisher=OpenGL |date=August 18, 2008 |accessdate=July 31, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opengl.org/news/nvidia_provides_early_opengl_30_driver_now|title=NVIDIA provides early OpenGL 3.0 driver now}}</ref>\n\n===OpenGL 3.0===\n''Release date'': August 11, 2008\n\nOpenGL 3.0 introduced a deprecation mechanism to simplify future revisions of the API. Certain features, marked as deprecated, could be completely disabled by requesting a ''forward-compatible context'' from the windowing system. OpenGL 3.0 features could still be accessed alongside these deprecated features, however, by requesting a ''full context''.\n\nDeprecated features include:\n*All fixed-function vertex and fragment processing\n*Direct-mode rendering, using glBegin and glEnd\n*Display lists\n*Indexed-color rendering targets\n*[[OpenGL Shading Language]] versions 1.10 and 1.20\n\n===OpenGL 3.1===\n''Release date'': March 24, 2009\n\nOpenGL 3.1 fully removed all of the features which were deprecated in version 3.0, with the exception of wide lines. From this version onwards, it's not possible to access new features using a ''full context'', or to access deprecated features using a ''forward-compatible context''. An exception to the former rule is made if the implementation supports the [https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/ARB_compatibility.txt ARB_compatibility] extension, but this is not guaranteed.\n\n===OpenGL 3.2===\n''Release date'': August 3, 2009\n\nOpenGL 3.2 further built on the deprecation mechanisms introduced by OpenGL 3.0, by dividing the specification into a ''core profile'' and ''compatibility profile''. Compatibility contexts include the previously-removed fixed-function APIs, equivalent to the ARB_compatibility extension released alongside OpenGL 3.1, while core contexts do not. OpenGL 3.2 also included an upgrade to GLSL version 1.50.\n\n===OpenGL 4.0===\n''Release date'': March 11, 2010\n\nOpenGL 4.0 was released alongside version 3.3. It was designed for hardware able to support Direct3D 11.\n\nAs in OpenGL 3.0, this version of OpenGL contains a high number of fairly inconsequential extensions, designed to thoroughly expose the abilities of Direct3D 11-class hardware. Only the most influential extensions are listed below.\n\nHardware support: Nvidia [[GeForce 400 series]] and newer, AMD [[Radeon HD 5000 Series]] and newer (FP64 shaders implemented by emulation on

Since 2006, OpenGL has been managed by the [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] technology [[consortium]] [[Khronos Group]].\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Pipeline OpenGL.svg|thumb|An illustration of the graphics pipeline process]]\nThe OpenGL specification describes an abstract [[application programming interface|API]] for drawing 2D and 3D graphics. Although it is possible for the API to be implemented entirely in software, it is designed to be implemented mostly or entirely [[Hardware acceleration|in hardware]].\n\nThe API is defined as a set of [[Subroutine|functions]] which may be called by the client program, alongside a set of [[Enumerated type|named integer constants]] (for example, the constant GL_TEXTURE_2D, which corresponds to the [[decimal]] number 3553). Although the function definitions are superficially similar to those of the programming language [[C (programming language)|C]], they are language-independent. As such, OpenGL has many [[language binding]]s, some of the most noteworthy being the [[JavaScript]] binding [[WebGL]] (API, based on [[OpenGL ES 2.0]], for 3D rendering from within a [[web browser]]); the C bindings [[WGL (software)|WGL]], [[GLX]] and [[Core OpenGL|CGL]]; the C binding provided by [[iOS]]; and the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and C bindings provided by [[Android (operating system)|Android]].\n\nIn addition to being language-independent, OpenGL is also cross-platform. The specification says nothing on the subject of obtaining, and managing an OpenGL context, leaving this as a detail of the underlying [[windowing system]]. For the same reason, OpenGL is purely concerned with rendering, providing no APIs related to input, audio, or windowing.\n\n===Development===\nOpenGL is an evolving API. New versions of the OpenGL specifications are regularly released by the [[Khronos Group]], each of which extends the API to support various new features. The details of each version are decided by consensus between the Group's members, including graphics card manufacturers, operating system designers, and general technology companies such as [[Mozilla]] and [[Google]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khronos.org/members/ |title=Khronos Membership Overview and FAQ |publisher=Khronos.org |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the features required by the core API, [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU) vendors may provide additional functionality in the form of ''extensions''. Extensions may introduce new functions and new constants, and may relax or remove restrictions on existing OpenGL functions. Vendors can use extensions to expose custom APIs without needing support from other vendors or the Khronos Group as a whole, which greatly increases the flexibility of OpenGL. All extensions are collected in, and defined by, the OpenGL Registry.<ref name=\"OpenGLRegistryRoot\">{{cite web|url=https://khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/index_gl.php |title=Khronos OpenGL Registry |publisher=Khronos Group |accessdate=July 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\nEach extension is associated with a short identifier, based on the name of the company which developed it. For example, [[Nvidia]]'s identifier is NV, which is part of the extension name <code>GL_NV_half_float</code>, the constant <code>GL_HALF_FLOAT_NV</code>, and the function <code>glVertex2hNV()</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/NV/NV_half_float.txt |title=NV_half_float |website=OpenGL Registry |publisher=Khronos Group}}</ref> If multiple vendors agree to implement the same functionality using the same API, a shared extension may be released, using the identifier EXT. In such cases, it could also happen that the Khronos Group's Architecture Review Board gives the extension their explicit approval, in which case the identifier ARB is used.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/docs/rules.html |title=How to Create Khronos API Extensions |publisher=Khronos Group |accessdate=July 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe features introduced by each new version of OpenGL are typically formed from the combined features of several widely implemented extensions, especially extensions of type ARB or EXT.\n\n==Documentation==\nOpenGL's popularity is partially due to the quality of its official documentation.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The OpenGL Architecture Review Board released a series of manuals along with the specification which have been updated to track changes in the API. These are commonly referred to by the colors of their covers:\n\n;The Red Book\n:OpenGL Programming Guide, 9th Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-134-49549-1|}}\n:The Official Guide to Learning OpenGL, Version 4.5 with SPIR-V\n;The Orange Book\n:OpenGL Shading Language, 3rd edition. {{ISBN|0-321-63763-1|}}\n:A tutorial and reference book for [[GLSL]].\n\nHistoric books (pre-OpenGL 2.0):\n\n;The Green Book\n:OpenGL Programming for the X Window System. {{ISBN|978-0-201-48359-8}}\n:A book about X11 interfacing and [[OpenGL Utility Toolkit]] (GLUT).\n;The Blue Book\n:OpenGL Reference manual, 4th edition. {{ISBN|0-321-17383-X}}\n:Essentially a hard-copy printout of the [[Unix manual]] (man) pages for OpenGL.\n:Includes a poster-sized fold-out diagram showing the structure of an idealised OpenGL implementation.\n;The Alpha Book (white cover)\n:OpenGL Programming for Windows 95 and Windows NT. {{ISBN|0-201-40709-4}}\n:A book about interfacing OpenGL with Microsoft Windows.\n\n==Associated libraries==\nThe earliest versions of OpenGL were released with a companion library called the [[OpenGL Utility Library]] (GLU). It provided simple, useful features which were unlikely to be supported in contemporary hardware, such as [[Tessellation (computer graphics)|tessellating]], and generating [[mipmap]]s and [[Geometric primitive|primitive shapes]]. The GLU specification was last updated in 1998 and depends on OpenGL features which are now [[deprecation|deprecated]].\n\n===Context and window toolkits===\nGiven that creating an OpenGL context is quite a complex process, and given that it varies between [[operating system]]s, automatic OpenGL context creation has become a common feature of several game-development and user-interface [[Library (computing)|libraries]], including [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]], [[Allegro (software)|Allegro]], [[SFML]], [[FLTK]], and [[Qt (software)|Qt]]. A few libraries have been designed solely to produce an OpenGL-capable window. The first such library was [[OpenGL Utility Toolkit]] (GLUT), later superseded by [[freeglut]]. [[GLFW]] is a newer alternative.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/windowtoolkits/ |title=A list of GLUT alternatives, maintained by |publisher=Khronos Group |date= |accessdate=May 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n* These toolkits are designed to create and manage OpenGL windows, and manage input, but little beyond that.<ref>{{cite web|title=Related toolkits and APIs|url=https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Related_toolkits_and_APIs#Context.2FWindow_Toolkits|website=www.opengl.org|publisher=OpenGL|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref>\n:* [[GLFW]] \u2013 A cross-platform windowing and keyboard-mouse-joystick handler; is more game-oriented\n:* [[freeglut]] \u2013 A cross-platform windowing and keyboard-mouse handler; its API is a superset of the GLUT API, and it is more stable and up to date than GLUT\n:* [[OpenGL Utility Toolkit]] (GLUT) \u2013 An old windowing handler, no longer maintained.\n* Several \"multimedia libraries\" can create OpenGL windows, in addition to input, sound and other tasks useful for game-like applications\n:* [[Allegro (software)|Allegro 5]] \u2013 A cross-platform multimedia library with a C API focused on game development\n:* [[Simple DirectMedia Layer]] (SDL) \u2013 A cross-platform multimedia library with a C API\n:* [[SFML]] \u2013 A cross-platform multimedia library with a C++ API and multiple other bindings to languages such as C#, Java, Haskell, and Go\n* Widget toolkits\n:* [[FLTK]] \u2013 A small cross-platform C++ widget library\n:* [[Qt (software)|Qt]] \u2013 A cross-platform C++ widget toolkit. It provides many OpenGL helper objects, which even abstract away the difference between desktop GL and OpenGL ES\n:* [[wxWidgets]] \u2013 A cross-platform C++ widget toolkit\n\n===Extension loading libraries===\nGiven the high workload involved in identifying and loading OpenGL extensions, a few libraries have been designed which load all available extensions and functions automatically. Examples include [[OpenGL Easy Extension library|GLEE]], [[OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library|GLEW]] and [[glbinding]]. Extensions are also loaded automatically by most language bindings, such as [[Java OpenGL|JOGL]] and [[PyOpenGL]].\n\n===Implementations===\n[[Mesa (computer graphics)|Mesa 3D]] is an [[Open-source software|open-source]] implementation of OpenGL. It can do pure software rendering, and it may also use hardware acceleration on [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], [[Linux]], and other platforms by taking advantage of the [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure]]. As of version 13.0, it implements version 4.5 of the OpenGL standard.\n\n==History==\nIn the 1980s, developing software that could function with a wide range of graphics hardware was a real challenge. Software developers wrote custom interfaces and drivers for each piece of hardware. This was expensive and resulted in multiplication of effort.\n\nBy the early 1990s, [[Silicon Graphics]] (SGI) was a leader in 3D graphics for workstations. Their [[IRIS GL]] API<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/~wimmer/apis/API_Summary.html|title= IRIS GL, SGI's property}}</ref> was considered state-of-the-art{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} and became the de facto industry standard, overshadowing the open standards-based [[PHIGS]]. This was because IRIS GL was considered easier to use, and because it supported [[Immediate mode (computer graphics)|immediate mode]] rendering. By contrast, PHIGS was considered difficult to use and outdated in functionality.\n\nSGI's competitors (including [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[IBM]]) were also able to bring to market 3D hardware supported by extensions made to the PHIGS standard, which pressured SGI to open source a version of IrisGL as a public standard called '''OpenGL'''.\n\nHowever, SGI had many customers for whom the change from IrisGL to OpenGL would demand significant investment. Moreover, IrisGL had API functions that were irrelevant to 3D graphics. For example, it included a windowing, keyboard and mouse API, in part because it was developed before the [[X Window System]] and Sun's [[NeWS]]. And, IrisGL libraries were unsuitable for opening due to licensing and patent issues{{Elucidate|reason=What patent issues?|date=September 2016}}. These factors required SGI to continue to support the advanced and proprietary [[Open Inventor|Iris Inventor]] and [[Iris Performer]] programming APIs while market support for OpenGL matured.\n\nOne of the restrictions of IrisGL was that it only provided access to features supported by the underlying hardware. If the graphics hardware did not support a feature natively, then the application could not use it. OpenGL overcame this problem by providing software implementations of features unsupported by hardware, allowing applications to use advanced graphics on relatively low-powered systems. OpenGL standardized access to hardware, pushed the development responsibility of hardware interface programs ([[device driver]]s) to hardware manufacturers, and delegated windowing functions to the underlying operating system. With so many different kinds of graphics hardware, getting them all to speak the same language in this way had a remarkable impact by giving software developers a higher level platform for 3D-software development.\n\nIn 1992,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sgi.com/company_info/newsroom/press_releases/2004/august/opengl.html|title=Creation of the OpenGL ARB|access-date=February 16, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222123208/http://www.sgi.com/company_info/newsroom/press_releases/2004/august/opengl.html|archive-date=February 22, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> SGI led the creation of the [[OpenGL Architecture Review Board]] (OpenGL ARB), the group of companies that would maintain and expand the OpenGL specification in the future.\n\nIn 1994, SGI played with the idea of releasing something called \"[[OpenGL++]]\" which included elements such as a scene-graph API (presumably based on their [[Performer (Computer Graphics API)|Performer]] technology). The specification was circulated among a few interested parties \u2013 but never turned into a product.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opengl.org/archives/about/arb/meeting_notes/notes/Meeting1.2/meeting_note_10-03-98.html|title=End of OpenGL++|publisher=Khronos Group}}</ref>\n\n[[Microsoft]] released [[Direct3D]] in 1995, which eventually became the main competitor of OpenGL.

Since then, OpenGL has occasionally been extended by releasing a new version of the specification. Such releases define a baseline set of features which all conforming graphics cards must support, and against which new extensions can more easily be written. Each new version of OpenGL tends to incorporate several extensions which have widespread support among graphics-card vendors, although the details of those extensions may be changed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+OpenGL version history\n!Version\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 10em;\" | Release Date\n!Features\n|-\n|1.1\n|March 4, 1997\n|Texture objects\n|-\n|1.2\n|March 16, 1998\n|3D textures, BGRA and [[packed pixel]] formats,<ref name=\"Gamedev1929\">{{cite news|url=https://www.gamedev.net/articles/programming/graphics/moving-beyond-opengl-11-for-windows-r1929/|title=Moving Beyond OpenGL 1.1 for Windows|last=Astle|first=Dave|date=April 1, 2003|work=gamedev.net|accessdate=November 15, 2007}}</ref> introduction of the ''imaging subset'' useful to image-processing applications\n|-\n|1.2.1\n|October 14, 1998\n|A concept of ARB extensions\n|-\n|1.3\n|August 14, 2001\n|[[Texture mapping|Multitexturing]], multisampling, texture compression\n|-\n|1.4\n|July 24, 2002\n|Depth textures, GLSlang<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=npmdCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA191|title=Simulaci\u00f3n visual de materiales : teor\u00eda, t\u00e9cnicas, an\u00e1lisis de casos|last=Isorna|first=J.M.|publisher=Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya|year=2015|isbn=978-84-9880-564-2|series=UPC Grau.

Most of these were, at the time, rejected by the ARB or otherwise never came to fruition in the form that 3Dlabs proposed. However, their proposal for a C-style shading language was eventually completed, resulting in the current formulation of the OpenGL Shading Language ([[GLSL]] or GLslang). Like the assembly-like shading languages it was replacing, it allowed replacing the fixed-function vertex and fragment pipe with [[shader]]s, though this time written in a C-like high-level language.\n\nThe design of GLSL was notable for making relatively few concessions to the limits of the hardware then available. This hearkened back to the earlier tradition of OpenGL setting an ambitious, forward-looking target for 3D accelerators rather than merely tracking the state of currently available hardware. The final OpenGL 2.0 specification<ref>{{cite web|url=https://khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec20.pdf|title=The OpenGL Graphics System|type=Specification|version=2.0|date=October 22, 2004}}</ref> includes support for GLSL.\n\n===Longs Peak and OpenGL 3.0===\nBefore the release of OpenGL 3.0, the new revision had the codename [[Longs Peak]]. At the time of its original announcement, Longs Peak was presented as the first major API revision in OpenGL's lifetime. It consisted of an overhaul to the way that OpenGL works, calling for fundamental changes to the API.\n\nThe draft introduced a change to object management. The GL 2.1 object model was built upon the state-based design of OpenGL. That is, to modify an object or to use it, one needs to bind the object to the state system, then make modifications to the state or perform function calls that use the bound object.\n\nBecause of OpenGL's use of a state system, objects must be mutable. That is, the basic structure of an object can change at any time, even if the rendering pipeline is asynchronously using that object. A texture object can be redefined from 2D to 3D. This requires any OpenGL implementations to add a degree of complexity to internal object management.\n\nUnder the Longs Peak API, object creation would become [[Linearizability|atomic]], using templates to define the properties of an object which would be created with one function call. The object could then be used immediately across multiple threads. Objects would also be immutable; however, they could have their contents changed and updated. For example, a texture could change its image, but its size and format could not be changed.\n\nTo support backwards compatibility, the old state based API would still be available, but no new functionality would be exposed via the old API in later versions of OpenGL. This would have allowed legacy code bases, such as the majority of [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] products, to continue to run while other software could be written against or ported to the new API.\n\nLongs Peak was initially due to be finalized in September 2007 under the name OpenGL 3.0, but the Khronos Group announced on October 30 that it had run into several issues that it wished to address before releasing the specification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=229374#Post229374|title=OpenGL ARB announces an update on OpenGL 3.0|date=October 30, 2007|accessdate=October 31, 2007}}</ref> As a result, the spec was delayed, and the Khronos Group went into a [[media blackout]] until the release of the final OpenGL 3.0 spec.\n\nThe final specification proved far less revolutionary than the Longs Peak proposal. Instead of removing all immediate mode and fixed functionality (non-shader mode), the spec included them as deprecated features. The proposed object model was not included, and no plans have been announced to include it in any future revisions. As a result, the API remained largely the same with a few existing extensions being promoted to core functionality.\n\nAmong some developer groups this decision caused something of an uproar,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/08/11/2135259 |title=OpenGL 3.0 Released, Developers Furious \u2013 Slashdot |publisher=Tech.slashdot.org |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> with many developers professing that they would switch to [[DirectX]] in protest. Most complaints revolved around the lack of communication by Khronos to the development community and multiple features being discarded that were viewed favorably by many. Other frustrations included the requirement of DirectX 10 level hardware to use OpenGL 3.0 and the absence of geometry shaders and instanced rendering as core features.\n\nOther sources reported that the community reaction was not quite as severe as originally presented,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opengl.org/news/opengl_bof_went_over_well_no_pitch_forks_seen|title=OpenGL BOF went over well, no pitch forks seen}}</ref> with many vendors showing support for the update.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opengl.org/news/nick_haemel_amd_blog_post_opengl_30_a_big_step_in_the_right_direction/ |title=The Industry Standard for High Performance Graphics |publisher=OpenGL |date=August 18, 2008 |accessdate=July 31, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opengl.org/news/nvidia_provides_early_opengl_30_driver_now|title=NVIDIA provides early OpenGL 3.0 driver now}}</ref>\n\n===OpenGL 3.0===\n''Release date'': August 11, 2008\n\nOpenGL 3.0 introduced a deprecation mechanism to simplify future revisions of the API. Certain features, marked as deprecated, could be completely disabled by requesting a ''forward-compatible context'' from the windowing system. OpenGL 3.0 features could still be accessed alongside these deprecated features, however, by requesting a ''full context''.\n\nDeprecated features include:\n*All fixed-function vertex and fragment processing\n*Direct-mode rendering, using glBegin and glEnd\n*Display lists\n*Indexed-color rendering targets\n*[[OpenGL Shading Language]] versions 1.10 and 1.20\n\n===OpenGL 3.1===\n''Release date'': March 24, 2009\n\nOpenGL 3.1 fully removed all of the features which were deprecated in version 3.0, with the exception of wide lines. From this version onwards, it's not possible to access new features using a ''full context'', or to access deprecated features using a ''forward-compatible context''. An exception to the former rule is made if the implementation supports the [https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/ARB_compatibility.txt ARB_compatibility] extension, but this is not guaranteed.\n\n===OpenGL 3.2===\n''Release date'': August 3, 2009\n\nOpenGL 3.2 further built on the deprecation mechanisms introduced by OpenGL 3.0, by dividing the specification into a ''core profile'' and ''compatibility profile''. Compatibility contexts include the previously-removed fixed-function APIs, equivalent to the ARB_compatibility extension released alongside OpenGL 3.1, while core contexts do not. OpenGL 3.2 also included an upgrade to GLSL version 1.50.\n\n===OpenGL 4.0===\n''Release date'': March 11, 2010\n\nOpenGL 4.0 was released alongside version 3.3. It was designed for hardware able to support Direct3D 11.\n\nAs in OpenGL 3.0, this version of OpenGL contains a high number of fairly inconsequential extensions, designed to thoroughly expose the abilities of Direct3D 11-class hardware. Only the most influential extensions are listed below.\n\nHardware support: Nvidia [[GeForce 400 series]] and newer, AMD [[Radeon HD 5000 Series]] and newer (FP64 shaders implemented by emulation on

Shortly after he was born the family moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and then settled in the UK in Hampshire, England in 1974.\nAfter leaving school at 16 he spent two formative years studying art at [[Basingstoke College of Technology]], after which he undertook A Levels at evening classes and eventually found his way to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], reading philosophy and graduating in 1994.\nAfter several years of developing his work in relative isolation he returned to art school and in 2001 he completed an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon School of Art. He has worked for the past twenty years from a rural setting in his studio in Oxfordshire<ref>\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\", p.22.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-12-9}}.</ref> Although characterised by their appearance \u2013 an abstract \u2018accretion of paint, resin and various other fluids\u2019<ref name=\"Arcs\">(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.12. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> - their manufacture was faithful to the rules that govern Butcher's creative process.<ref>Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/ \"statement\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> Butcher has said of his practice that \u2018the application or subtraction of paint as a set of processes is achieved through a variety of continually evolving techniques which draw attention to the physical properties of my materials\u2019,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\">Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/\"statement\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> a result that would be most clearly manifest in his subsequent metal works. The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of his father, Butcher created a series of works from gunpowder residue and clay on burnt paper. These found 'drawings' were from 'spent fireworks cartridges from a beach display [that] had been casually tossed into the sea'<ref name=richnessrightness>(2019).\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\" Carey-Kent, Paul, p.124. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>. 'Eric started to gather them up for more suitable disposal. Then he became interested in how the spent energy had left its marks, especially as those traces were \u2013 in line with the aims of his wider practice \u2013 free from the subjectivity of creative decision making'.<ref name=richnessrightness /> Butcher states how 'the absence of something no longer present coupled with enormous pressure (in the case of the embossed pieces) or heat (in the case of the firework pieces) I find very suggestive and full of implications. On a metaphorical level they speak of loss and spent energy'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.139. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>\n\nIt is also apparent that the artist is re-evaluating his own resources in his use of paper, taking environmental concerns into the work itself. As he says in the Time Trial catalogue, '[in] trying to consume less, tread more lightly on the planet, it would be curiously contradictory not to impose the same logic of questioning on my work. Aluminium production is an energy intensive business, so I am increasingly using recycled and reused materials'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.124.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines),<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref> which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\nThe Devil Finds Work for Idle Hands explored the materiality of paper with work by six contemporary artists (Rana Begum, Michael Brown, Eric Butcher, Sim\u00f3n Granell, Natasha Kidd, John Lavell). It was an exhibition of artists who work with paper; with each artist making work exploiting properties intrinsic to the material.\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of his father, Butcher created a series of works from gunpowder residue and clay on burnt paper. These found 'drawings' were from 'spent fireworks cartridges from a beach display [that] had been casually tossed into the sea'<ref name=richnessrightness>(2019).\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\" Carey-Kent, Paul, p.124. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>. 'Eric started to gather them up for more suitable disposal. Then he became interested in how the spent energy had left its marks, especially as those traces were \u2013 in line with the aims of his wider practice \u2013 free from the subjectivity of creative decision making'.<ref name=richnessrightness /> Butcher states how 'the absence of something no longer present coupled with enormous pressure (in the case of the embossed pieces) or heat (in the case of the firework pieces) I find very suggestive and full of implications. On a metaphorical level they speak of loss and spent energy'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.139. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>\n\nIt is also apparent that the artist is re-evaluating his own resources in his use of paper, taking environmental concerns into the work itself. As he says in the Time Trial catalogue, '[in] trying to consume less, tread more lightly on the planet, it would be curiously contradictory not to impose the same logic of questioning on my work. Aluminium production is an energy intensive business, so I am increasingly using recycled and reused materials'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.124.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines),<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref> which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\nThe Devil Finds Work for Idle Hands explored the materiality of paper with work by six contemporary artists (Rana Begum, Michael Brown, Eric Butcher, Sim\u00f3n Granell, Natasha Kidd, John Lavell). It was an exhibition of artists who work with paper; with each artist making work exploiting properties intrinsic to the material.\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

Tobacco products such as cigars and cigarettes were the only manufactured products among Cuba's leading exports, and even these were produced by a preindustrial process.

To alleviate the economic crisis, the government introduced a few [[market economy|market]]-oriented reforms including opening to [[tourism]], allowing [[Foreign Direct Investment|foreign investment]], legalizing the [[U.S. dollar]] and authorizing self-employment for some 150 occupations. (This policy was later partially reversed, so that while the U.S. dollar is no longer accepted in businesses, it remains legal for Cubans to hold the currency.) These measures resulted in modest [[economic growth]]. The [[free market|liberalized]] [[agriculture|agricultural]] markets introduced in October 1994, at which state and private farmers sell above-quota production at [[free market]] prices, broadened legal consumption alternatives and reduced [[black market]] prices.\n\nGovernment efforts to lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink the money supply caused the semi-official [[exchange rate]] for the [[Cuban peso]] to move from a peak of 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to the dollar by year-end 1999. The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. One of the key reasons given was the failure to notice that sugar production had become uneconomic. Reflecting on the Special period Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]] later admitted that many mistakes had been made, \"The country had many economists and it is not my intention to criticize them, but I would like to ask why we hadn\u2019t discovered earlier that maintaining our levels of sugar production would be impossible.

This situation was exacerbated by the influx of dollars during the 1990s, potentially creating a dual economy based on the dollar (the currency of tourists) on the one hand and the peso on the other. Scarce imported goods \u2013 and even some of local manufacture, such as [[rum]] and [[coffee]] \u2013 could be had at dollar-only stores, but were hard to find or unavailable at peso prices. As a result, Cubans who earned only in the peso economy, outside the tourist sector, were at a disadvantage. Those with dollar incomes based upon the service industry began to live more comfortably.

Foreign investors must form joint ventures with the Cuban government. The sole exception to this rule are Venezuelans, who are allowed to hold 100% ownership in businesses due to an agreement between Cuba and Venezuela. Cuban officials said in early 1998 that 332 [[joint venture]]s had begun. Many of these are loans or contracts for management, supplies, or services normally not considered equity investment in Western economies.

One is sometimes called the \"national currency\" (or CUP) the other is the [[Cuban convertible peso|convertible peso]] (or CUC, often called \"dollar\" in the spoken language). There are currently 25 CUP per CUC.\n\nIn 1994 the possession and use of US dollars was legalised, and by 2004 the US dollar was in widespread use in the country. To capture the hard currency flowing into the island through tourism and [[remittances]] \u2013 estimated at $500\u2013800 million annually \u2013 the government set up state-run \"dollar stores\" throughout Cuba that sold \"luxury\" food, household and clothing items, compared with basic necessities, which could be bought using national pesos. As such, the standard of living diverged between those who had access to dollars and those without. Jobs that could earn dollar salaries or tips from foreign businesses and tourists became highly desirable. It was common to meet doctors, engineers, scientists and other professionals working in restaurants or as taxicab drivers.\n\nHowever, in response to stricter [[United States embargo against Cuba|economic sanctions by the US]] and because the authorities were pleased with Cuba's economic recovery, the Cuban government decided in October 2004 to remove US dollars from circulation. In its place, the convertible peso was created, which although not internationally traded, has a value pegged to the US dollar 1:1. A 10% surcharge is levied for cash conversions from US dollars to the convertible peso, which does not apply to other currencies, so it acts as an encouragement for tourists to bring currencies such as [[Euro]]s, [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]] or [[Canadian dollar]]s into Cuba. An increasing number of tourist zones accept Euros.\n\n===Private businesses===\n\nOwners of small private restaurants (''[[paladar]]es'') originally could seat no more than 12 people<ref name=\"O'Rourke2007\">{{cite book|author=P.

Its overall score was 0.2 point higher than last year, with deteriorations in trade freedom, fiscal freedom, monetary freedom and freedom from corruption counterbalanced by an improvement in business freedom. Cuba ranked least free of 29 countries in the South and Central America\nregion and its overall score was significantly lower than the regional average. Over the 20-year history of the Index, Cuba's economic freedom remained stagnant near the bottom of the \u201crepressed\u201d category. Its overall score improvement was less than 1 point over the past two decades, with score gains in fiscal freedom and freedom from corruption offset by double-digit declines in business freedom and investment freedom.\n\nDespite some progress in restructuring the state sector since 2010, the private sector remained constrained by heavy regulations and tight state controls. [[The Heritage Foundation]] states that open-market policies were not in place to spur growth in trade and investment and the lack of competition continued to stifle dynamic economic expansion.

Sugar had done well from 1985\u201390 and crashed precipitously in 1990\u201391 and did not recover for five years. Cuba had been insulated from world sugar prices by Soviet price guarantees.

To alleviate the economic crisis, the government introduced a few [[market economy|market]]-oriented reforms including opening to [[tourism]], allowing [[Foreign Direct Investment|foreign investment]], legalizing the [[U.S. dollar]] and authorizing self-employment for some 150 occupations. (This policy was later partially reversed, so that while the U.S. dollar is no longer accepted in businesses, it remains legal for Cubans to hold the currency.) These measures resulted in modest [[economic growth]]. The [[free market|liberalized]] [[agriculture|agricultural]] markets introduced in October 1994, at which state and private farmers sell above-quota production at [[free market]] prices, broadened legal consumption alternatives and reduced [[black market]] prices.\n\nGovernment efforts to lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink the money supply caused the semi-official [[exchange rate]] for the [[Cuban peso]] to move from a peak of 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to the dollar by year-end 1999. The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. One of the key reasons given was the failure to notice that sugar production had become uneconomic. Reflecting on the Special period Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]] later admitted that many mistakes had been made, \"The country had many economists and it is not my intention to criticize them, but I would like to ask why we hadn\u2019t discovered earlier that maintaining our levels of sugar production would be impossible.

Havana devotes significant resources to building tourist facilities and renovating historic structures. Cuban officials estimate roughly 1.6 million tourists visited Cuba in 1999 yielding about $1.9 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] in gross revenues. In 2000, 1,773,986 foreign visitors arrived in Cuba.

This situation was exacerbated by the influx of dollars during the 1990s, potentially creating a dual economy based on the dollar (the currency of tourists) on the one hand and the peso on the other. Scarce imported goods \u2013 and even some of local manufacture, such as [[rum]] and [[coffee]] \u2013 could be had at dollar-only stores, but were hard to find or unavailable at peso prices. As a result, Cubans who earned only in the peso economy, outside the tourist sector, were at a disadvantage. Those with dollar incomes based upon the service industry began to live more comfortably. This widened the gap between Cubans' material standards of living, in conflict with the Cuban Government's long term socialist policies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://traveloutward.com/articles/caribbean/6-03_cuba.shtml |title=Lessons From Cuba |date=4 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030628061024/http://www.traveloutward.com/articles/caribbean/6-03_cuba.shtml |archivedate=28 June 2003 |accessdate=21 January 2017}} Travel Outward</ref>\n\n====Retail====\nCuba has a small retail sector.

Currently, this trend can be seen in other colonial Caribbean communities who have direct political ties with the global economy. Cuba's primary import partner is Venezuela. The second largest trade partner is Canada, with a 22% share of the Cuban export market.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/cuba/canada-cuba-trade.html FAQs on Canada-Cuba trade] CBC</ref>\n\nCuba began courting foreign investment in the Special Period. Foreign investors must form joint ventures with the Cuban government. The sole exception to this rule are Venezuelans, who are allowed to hold 100% ownership in businesses due to an agreement between Cuba and Venezuela. Cuban officials said in early 1998 that 332 [[joint venture]]s had begun. Many of these are loans or contracts for management, supplies, or services normally not considered equity investment in Western economies. Investors are constrained by the [[Helms\u2013Burton Act|U.S.-Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act]] that provides sanctions for those who traffic in property expropriated from U.S. citizens.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/cuba/35715.htm|title=Cuba (11/03)|newspaper=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2017-02-22}}</ref>\n\nCuba's average tariff rate is 10 percent.

One is sometimes called the \"national currency\" (or CUP) the other is the [[Cuban convertible peso|convertible peso]] (or CUC, often called \"dollar\" in the spoken language). There are currently 25 CUP per CUC.\n\nIn 1994 the possession and use of US dollars was legalised, and by 2004 the US dollar was in widespread use in the country. To capture the hard currency flowing into the island through tourism and [[remittances]] \u2013 estimated at $500\u2013800 million annually \u2013 the government set up state-run \"dollar stores\" throughout Cuba that sold \"luxury\" food, household and clothing items, compared with basic necessities, which could be bought using national pesos. As such, the standard of living diverged between those who had access to dollars and those without. Jobs that could earn dollar salaries or tips from foreign businesses and tourists became highly desirable. It was common to meet doctors, engineers, scientists and other professionals working in restaurants or as taxicab drivers.\n\nHowever, in response to stricter [[United States embargo against Cuba|economic sanctions by the US]] and because the authorities were pleased with Cuba's economic recovery, the Cuban government decided in October 2004 to remove US dollars from circulation. In its place, the convertible peso was created, which although not internationally traded, has a value pegged to the US dollar 1:1. A 10% surcharge is levied for cash conversions from US dollars to the convertible peso, which does not apply to other currencies, so it acts as an encouragement for tourists to bring currencies such as [[Euro]]s, [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]] or [[Canadian dollar]]s into Cuba. An increasing number of tourist zones accept Euros.\n\n===Private businesses===\n\nOwners of small private restaurants (''[[paladar]]es'') originally could seat no more than 12 people<ref name=\"O'Rourke2007\">{{cite book|author=P.

Its overall score was 0.2 point higher than last year, with deteriorations in trade freedom, fiscal freedom, monetary freedom and freedom from corruption counterbalanced by an improvement in business freedom. Cuba ranked least free of 29 countries in the South and Central America\nregion and its overall score was significantly lower than the regional average. Over the 20-year history of the Index, Cuba's economic freedom remained stagnant near the bottom of the \u201crepressed\u201d category. Its overall score improvement was less than 1 point over the past two decades, with score gains in fiscal freedom and freedom from corruption offset by double-digit declines in business freedom and investment freedom.\n\nDespite some progress in restructuring the state sector since 2010, the private sector remained constrained by heavy regulations and tight state controls. [[The Heritage Foundation]] states that open-market policies were not in place to spur growth in trade and investment and the lack of competition continued to stifle dynamic economic expansion.

An [[External memory algorithm|I/O algorithm]] is one designed to exploit locality and perform efficiently when exchanging data with a secondary storage device, such as a disk drive.\n\n==Interface==\nAn I/O interface is required whenever the I/O device is driven by a processor.  Typically a CPU communicates with devices via a [[bus (computing)|bus]]. The interface must have necessary logic to interpret the device address generated by the processor. [[Handshaking]] should be implemented by the interface using appropriate commands (like BUSY, READY, and WAIT), and the processor can communicate with an I/O device through the interface. If different data formats are being exchanged, the interface must be able to convert serial data to parallel form and vice versa.

For example, most operating systems provide application programs with the concept of [[computer file|file]]s. The [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] programming languages, and operating systems in the [[Unix]] family, traditionally abstract files and devices as [[Stream (computing)|streams]], which can be read or written, or sometimes both. The [[C standard library]] provides [[C file input/output|functions for manipulating streams]] for input and output.\n\nIn the context of the [[ALGOL 68]] programming language, the ''input'' and ''output'' facilities are collectively referred to as ''transput''.  The ''ALGOL 68'' transput library recognizes the following standard files/devices: <code>stand in</code>, <code>stand out</code>, <code>stand errors</code> and <code>stand back</code>.\n\nAn alternative to special primitive functions is the [[I/O monad]], which permits programs to just describe I/O, and the actions are carried out outside the program. This is notable because the {{nowrap|I/O}} functions would introduce [[side-effect (computer science)|side-effect]]s to any programming language, but this allows [[purely functional programming]] to be practical.\n\n== Channel I/O ==\n[[Channel I/O]] requires the use of instructions that are specifically designed to perform I/O operations. The I/O instructions address the channel or the channel and device; the channel asynchronously accesses all other required addressing and control information. This is similar to DMA, but more flexible.\n\n== Port-mapped I/O ==\n[[Memory-mapped I/O|Port-mapped I/O]] also requires the use of special I/O instructions. Typically one or more ports are assigned to the device, each with a special purpose. The port numbers are in a separate address space from that used by normal instructions.\n\n==Direct memory access==\n[[Direct memory access]] (DMA) is a means for devices to transfer large chunks of data to and from memory independently of the CPU.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Asynchronous I/O]]\n* [[I/O bound]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Input output}}\n[[Category:Input/output]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|I/O}}\n{{about||uses of the term input-output in economics|Input-output model}}\n{{Refimprove|date=November 2019}}\nIn [[computing]], '''input/output''' or '''I/O''' (or, informally, '''io''' or '''IO''') is the communication between an information processing system, such as a [[computer]], and the outside world, possibly a human or another information processing system.

Any transfer of information to or from the CPU/memory combo, for example by reading data from a [[disk drive]], is considered I/O.<ref name=\"teco\">{{cite book |title=The Essentials of Computer Organization and Architecture |last=Null |first=Linda |author2=Julia Lobur |year=2006 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning |isbn=0763737690 |page=185 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=QGPHAl9GE-IC |accessdate=11 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220112332/https://books.google.com.au/books?id=QGPHAl9GE-IC |archivedate=20 December 2016 }}</ref>  The CPU and its supporting circuitry may provide [[memory-mapped I/O]] that is used in low-level [[computer programming]], such as in the implementation of [[device driver]]s, or may provide access to [[Channel I/O|I/O channels]].  An [[External memory algorithm|I/O algorithm]] is one designed to exploit locality and perform efficiently when exchanging data with a secondary storage device, such as a disk drive.\n\n==Interface==\nAn I/O interface is required whenever the I/O device is driven by a processor.  Typically a CPU communicates with devices via a [[bus (computing)|bus]]. The interface must have necessary logic to interpret the device address generated by the processor. [[Handshaking]] should be implemented by the interface using appropriate commands (like BUSY, READY, and WAIT), and the processor can communicate with an I/O device through the interface. If different data formats are being exchanged, the interface must be able to convert serial data to parallel form and vice versa.  Because it would be a waste for a processor to be idle while it waits for data from an input device there must be provision for generating [[interrupt]]s<ref name=\"fcoa\"/> and the corresponding type numbers for further processing by the processor if required.{{Clarify|reason=meaning unclear|date=December 2016}}\n\nA computer that uses [[memory-mapped I/O]] accesses hardware by reading and writing to specific memory locations, using the same assembly language instructions that computer would normally use to access memory.  An alternative method is via instruction-based I/O which requires that a CPU have specialised instructions for I/O.<ref name=\"teco\"/>  Both input and output devices have a [[data processing]] rate that can vary greatly.<ref name=\"fcoa\">{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Computer Organization and Architecture |last=Abd-El-Barr |first=Mostafa |author2=Hesham El-Rewini |year=2005 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9780471478331 |page=161-162 |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m6uFlL41TlIC |accessdate=11 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221033042/https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m6uFlL41TlIC |archivedate=21 December 2016 }}</ref>  With some devices able to exchange data at very high speeds [[Direct memory access|direct access]] to memory (DMA) without the continuous aid of a CPU is required.<ref name=\"fcoa\"/>\n\n=== Higher-level implementation ===\nHigher-level [[operating system]] and programming facilities employ separate, more abstract I/O concepts and [[primitive (computer science)|primitive]]s. For example, most operating systems provide application programs with the concept of [[computer file|file]]s. The [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] programming languages, and operating systems in the [[Unix]] family, traditionally abstract files and devices as [[Stream (computing)|streams]], which can be read or written, or sometimes both. The [[C standard library]] provides [[C file input/output|functions for manipulating streams]] for input and output.\n\nIn the context of the [[ALGOL 68]] programming language, the ''input'' and ''output'' facilities are collectively referred to as ''transput''.  The ''ALGOL 68'' transput library recognizes the following standard files/devices: <code>stand in</code>, <code>stand out</code>, <code>stand errors</code> and <code>stand back</code>.\n\nAn alternative to special primitive functions is the [[I/O monad]], which permits programs to just describe I/O, and the actions are carried out outside the program. This is notable because the {{nowrap|I/O}} functions would introduce [[side-effect (computer science)|side-effect]]s to any programming language, but this allows [[purely functional programming]] to be practical.\n\n== Channel I/O ==\n[[Channel I/O]] requires the use of instructions that are specifically designed to perform I/O operations. The I/O instructions address the channel or the channel and device; the channel asynchronously accesses all other required addressing and control information. This is similar to DMA, but more flexible.\n\n== Port-mapped I/O ==\n[[Memory-mapped I/O|Port-mapped I/O]] also requires the use of special I/O instructions. Typically one or more ports are assigned to the device, each with a special purpose. The port numbers are in a separate address space from that used by normal instructions.\n\n==Direct memory access==\n[[Direct memory access]] (DMA) is a means for devices to transfer large chunks of data to and from memory independently of the CPU.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Asynchronous I/O]]\n* [[I/O bound]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Input output}}\n[[Category:Input/output]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4055:593:71d:aebb:d0e1:163c:3c86", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output"}

Individually she is owner of six [[List of Dutch records in swimming|national records]], four in [[Olympic-size swimming pool|long course]], 100 m and 200&nbsp;m freestyle, 100 m backstroke, and 200&nbsp;m individual medley, and two in short course, 200&nbsp;m freestyle and 200&nbsp;m individual medley. She currently represents Energy Standard in the [[International Swimming League]].\n\n==Swimming career==\n===Early career===\nFemke Heemskerk made her international debut at the [[2005 World Aquatics Championships|World LC Championships 2005]] in [[Montreal]] as a relay-swimmer. She only swum in the heats of the [[Swimming at the 2005 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4\u00d7100&nbsp;m freestyle]] and the [[Swimming at the 2005 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 200 metre freestyle relay|4\u00d7200&nbsp;m freestyle events]]. She competed in the [[2006 European Aquatics Championships|European LC Championships 2006]] and the [[European Short Course Swimming Championships]]. But individually she did not advance past the heats in both events.\n\nAt the [[Swimming at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships|World LC Championships 2007]] she won a bronze medal in the [[Swimming at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4\u00d7100&nbsp;m freestyle]] together with [[Inge Dekker]], [[Ranomi Kromowidjojo]] and [[Marleen Veldhuis]]. At the [[2007 European Short Course Swimming Championships]] in [[Debrecen]] she surprisingly finished 6th in her first international final, the 100&nbsp;m freestyle. She also finished 10th in the 200&nbsp;m freestyle.\n\n===Spring 2008===\nIn 2008 she swam at the [[2008 European Aquatics Championships]] on the world record breaking 4\u00d7100 m freestyle team, which also won bronze in the World Championships the year before. With the same team she ended fourth in the 4\u00d7200 m freestyle relay. Individually she did not reach the semi-finals. The next month she competed in [[Manchester]] at the [[2008 FINA Short Course World Championships|World SC Championships 2008]] where she again broke two relay records in the 4\u00d7200&nbsp;m freestyle with the same team as in Eindhoven. In the 4\u00d7100&nbsp;m freestyle [[Hinkelien Schreuder]] replaced [[Ranomi Kromowidjojo]] who suffered from an elbow injury. She won her first individual medal, a silver medal, in the 200&nbsp;m freestyle at the last day of the tournament. During the National Championships in June 2008, Heemskerk lowered three national records on the long course, 200&nbsp;m freestyle, 200&nbsp;m individual medley and 100&nbsp;m backstroke.\n\n===2008 Summer Olympics===\nAt the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]] she won a gold medal with the [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4\u00d7100&nbsp;m freestyle relay]].
