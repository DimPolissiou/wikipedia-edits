He guest-starred in \"The Trouble with Harry\" and \"Fire\", two episodes of ''[[The A-Team]]''. Gleason was known to ''[[Star Wars]]'' fans for his role as Jeremitt Towani in the 1985 made-for-TV film ''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]''. He played the villainous Clarence Beeks, the Duke brothers' inside trader, in the 1983 comedy ''[[Trading Places]]'' starring [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[Eddie Murphy]]. He also played Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson, the blowhard police official, in ''[[Die Hard]]''.\n\nAt 44, Gleason played Richard Vernon, the disciplinarian school assistant principal, in the 1985 film ''[[The Breakfast Club]]''. He played similar characters in the 1988 film ''[[Johnny Be Good]]'' (as a high school football coach) and on several episodes of the TV sitcom ''[[Boy Meets World]]'' (as a university dean). He directly parodied his ''Breakfast Club'' role in the 2000 [[A-Teens]] music video for \"[[Dancing Queen]]\" and in the 2001 comedy film ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]''.\n\nIn 2002, he appeared in episodes of ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' as Larry Newman, the sex-and-violence obsessed chief of a [[B movie]] studio. He appeared as a nonsensical judge in an episode of ''[[Drake & Josh]]''. He also appeared in an episode of ''[[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]]'' as the brother of [[George Lopez|George's]] boss, a crazy old drunk. In 2005, he appeared as the Sheriff in the horror film ''[[Abominable (2006 film)|Abominable]]''.  His final appearance before his death was in an independent film called ''[[The Book of Caleb]]''.\n\nHe also had a short role on the cult TV Show ''[[Friends]]'' as Jack, Phoebe's boss at an investment company, in the season 6 episode \u201cThe One That Could Have Been\".\n\n==Personal life ==\nGleason, in addition to his acting career, participated in many celebrity [[golf]] events each year, and was known to mingle with fans and sign autographs during these golf tournaments.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1978, he was married to actress [[Candy Moore]]; they had one daughter, Shannon. For most of the 1980s, he identified as [[gay]]. From 1995 until his death, he was married to Susan Kehl; they had one daughter, Kaitlin.\n\n==Death==\nGleason died on May 27, 2006 at a [[Burbank, California]] hospital from [[Pleural cavity|pleural]] [[mesothelioma]], a form of lung cancer connected with [[asbestos]], which he is thought to have contracted from asbestos exposure on building sites while working for his father as a teenager. Gleason was 67 years old.<ref name=\"tel\"/> He is buried near the southeast corner of the [[Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park and Mortuary|Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Westwood, Los Angeles]].\n\n== Filmography ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He guest-starred in \"The Trouble with Harry\" and \"Fire\", two episodes of ''[[The A-Team]]''. Gleason was known to ''[[Star Wars]]'' fans for his role as Jeremitt Towani in the 1985 made-for-TV film ''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]''. He played the villainous Clarence Beeks, the Duke brothers' inside trader, in the 1983 comedy ''[[Trading Places]]'' starring [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[Eddie Murphy]]. He also played Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson, the blowhard police official, in ''[[Die Hard]]''.\n\nAt 44, Gleason played Richard Vernon, the disciplinarian school assistant principal, in the 1985 film ''[[The Breakfast Club]]''. He played similar characters in the 1988 film ''[[Johnny Be Good]]'' (as a high school football coach) and on several episodes of the TV sitcom ''[[Boy Meets World]]'' (as a university dean). He directly parodied his ''Breakfast Club'' role in the 2000 [[A-Teens]] music video for \"[[Dancing Queen]]\" and in the 2001 comedy film ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]''.\n\nIn 2002, he appeared in episodes of ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' as Larry Newman, the sex-and-violence obsessed chief of a [[B movie]] studio. He appeared as a nonsensical judge in an episode of ''[[Drake & Josh]]''. He also appeared in an episode of ''[[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]]'' as the brother of [[George Lopez|George's]] boss, a crazy old drunk. In 2005, he appeared as the Sheriff in the horror film ''[[Abominable (2006 film)|Abominable]]''.  His final appearance before his death was in an independent film called ''[[The Book of Caleb]]''.\n\nHe also had a short role on the cult TV Show ''[[Friends]]'' as Jack, Phoebe's boss at an investment company, in the season 6 episode \u201cThe One That Could Have Been\".\n\n==Personal life ==\nGleason, in addition to his acting career, participated in many celebrity [[golf]] events each year, and was known to mingle with fans and sign autographs during these golf tournaments.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1978, he was married to actress [[Candy Moore]]; they had one daughter, Shannon. From 1995 until his death, he was married to Susan Kehl; they had one daughter, Kaitlin.\n\n==Death==\nGleason died on May 27, 2006 at a [[Burbank, California]] hospital from [[Pleural cavity|pleural]] [[mesothelioma]], a form of lung cancer connected with [[asbestos]], which he is thought to have contracted from asbestos exposure on building sites while working for his father as a teenager. Gleason was 67 years old.<ref name=\"tel\"/> He is buried near the southeast corner of the [[Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park and Mortuary|Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Westwood, Los Angeles]].\n\n== Filmography ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, others (e.g. those referenced below) do not restrict the definition of \"lynching\" to exclude those described by other labels like \"massacre\" or \"terrorism\".<ref>{{cite book | title=Rough Justice: Lynching and American Society, 1874\u20131947 | publisher=North Carolina University Press | author=Wood, Amy Louise | year=2009 | isbn=9780807878118|oclc = 701719807}}</ref><ref>[https://www.scpr.org/programs/offramp/2016/10/21/52801/commemorating-la-s-chinese-massacre-possibly-the-w/ \"Commemorating LA's Chinese Massacre, possibly the worst lynching in US history\"], Robert Petersen, Off-Ramp\u00ae, South Carolina Public Radio, 21 October 2016</ref>}}\n\nThe lynching took place the day after the trial of nine of the nineteen men indicted in Hennessy's murder. Six of these defendants were acquitted, and a mistrial was declared for the remaining three because the jury failed to agree on their verdicts. There was widespread suspicion in the city that an Italian network of criminals was responsible for the killing of the police chief, in a period of anti-Italian sentiment and rising crime. Believing the jury had been bribed, a mob broke into the jail where the men were being held and killed eleven of the prisoners, most by shooting. The mob outside the jail numbered in the thousands and included some of the city's most prominent citizens. American press coverage of the event was largely congratulatory, and those responsible for the lynching were never charged.\n\nThe incident had serious national repercussions. The Italian consul Pasquale Corte in New Orleans registered a protest and left the city in May 1891 at his government's direction. The ''[[New York Times]]'' published his lengthy statement charging city politicians with responsibility for the lynching of the Italians.<ref name=\"nyt524\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1891/05/24/103309443.html?pageNumber=1 \"Signor Corte's Farewell/His Story of the Lynching of the Italians\"], ''New York Times'', 24 May 1891; accessed 5 February 2018</ref> Italy cut off diplomatic relations with the United States, sparking rumors of war. Increased [[Anti-Italianism#Anti-Italianism in the United States|anti-Italian]] sentiment led to calls for restrictions on immigration. The word \"[[Mafia]]\" entered the American lexicon, and the stereotype of the [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian mafioso]] became established in the popular imagination.\n\nThe lynchings were the subject of the 1999 [[HBO]] movie ''[[Vendetta (1999 film)|Vendetta]]'', starring [[Christopher Walken]]. The movie is based on a 1977 history book of the same name by [[Richard Gambino]].\n\n==Background==\n===Anti-Italian sentiment in New Orleans===\n\nIn late 19th-century America, there was a growing prejudice against Italians, although they were recruited to satisfy the demand for cheap labor. They were immigrating to the American South, particularly Florida and Louisiana, in large numbers because of poor conditions at home and to fill the shortage of cheap labor created by the end of slavery and the preference of freedmen to work on their own accounts as sharecroppers. Sugar planters, in particular, sought workers who were more compliant than former slaves; they hired immigrant recruiters to bring Italians to southern Louisiana. In the 1890s, thousands of Italians were arriving in New Orleans each year. Many settled in the [[French Quarter]], which by the early 20th century became known as \"Little Sicily.\"{{sfn|Liles|2017}}\n\nIn a letter responding to an inquiry about immigration in New Orleans, Mayor [[Joseph A. Shakspeare]] expressed the common anti-Italian prejudice, complaining that the city had become attractive to \"...the worst classes of Europe: Southern Italians and Sicilians...the most idle, vicious, and worthless people among us.\" He claimed they were \"filthy in their persons and homes\" and blamed them for the spread of disease, concluding that they were \"without courage, honor, truth, pride, religion, or any quality that goes to make a good citizen.\"{{sfn|Liles|2017}}\n\n===Assassination of David Hennessy===\n[[File:HennessySceneOfTheAssassination.jpg|thumb|Artist's conception of Hennessy's murder. \"Scene of the Assassination\", ''The Mascot'', New Orleans, 1890.]]\n\nOn the evening of October 15, 1890, New Orleans police chief David Hennessy was shot by several gunmen as he walked home from work. Hennessy returned fire and chased his attackers before collapsing. When asked who had shot him, Hennessy reportedly whispered to Captain William O'Connor, \"[[wikt:dago|Dagoes]]\" (a derogatory term for Italians and others of Mediterranean heritage). Hennessy was awake in the hospital for several hours after the shooting, and spoke to friends, but did not name the shooters. The next day complications set in and he died.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=4}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xxiv}}\n\nThere had been an ongoing feud between the Provenzano and Mantranga<ref group=note>Also spelled \"Matranga\" in some documents.</ref> families, who were business rivals on the New Orleans waterfront. Hennessy had put several of the Provenzanos in prison, and their appeal trial was coming up. According to some reports, Hennessy had been planning to offer new evidence at the trial that would clear the Provenzanos and implicate the Mantrangas. If true, this would mean that the Mantrangas, and not the Provenzanos, had a motive for the murder.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=264}} A policeman who was a friend of Hennessy's later testified that Hennessy had told him he had no such plans.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=76}} In any case, it was widely believed that Hennessy's killers were Italian. Local papers such as the ''Times-Democrat'' and the ''Daily Picayune'' freely blamed \"Dagoes\" for the murder.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=267}}\n\n===Investigation===\nThe murder was quickly followed by mass arrests of local Italians. Mayor [[Joseph A. Shakspeare]] (according to the ''Picayune'') told the police to \"scour the whole neighborhood. Arrest every Italian you come across.\" Within 24 hours, 45 people had been arrested.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=265}} By some accounts, as many as 250 Italians were rounded up.{{sfn|Maselli|Candeloro|2004|p=35}} Most were eventually released for lack of evidence.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=266}} Local Italians were afraid to leave their homes for several days after the murder, but eventually the furor died down and they returned to work.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=267}}\n\nNineteen men were ultimately charged with the murder or as accessories and held without bail in the Parish Prison. These included Charles Mantranga, who was charged with plotting the murder, and several of the Mantranga's friends and workers. Pietro Monasterio, a shoemaker, was arrested because he lived across the street from where Hennessy was standing when he was shot. Antonio Marchesi, a fruit peddler, was arrested because he was a friend of Monasterio's and \"was known to frequent his shoe shop.\"{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=150, 14}} Emmanuele Polizzi was arrested when a policeman identified him as one of the men he had seen running from the scene of the crime.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=266}}\n\nA few days after Hennessy's death, Mayor Shakspeare gave a speech declaring that Hennessy had been \"the victim of Sicilian vengeance\" and calling upon the citizenry to \"teach these people a lesson they will not forget.\"{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=144}} He appointed a Committee of Fifty to investigate \"the existence of secret societies or bands of oath-bound assassins...and to devise necessary means and the most effectual and speedy measures for the uprooting and total annihilation\" of any such organizations.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=266}} On October 23, the committee published an open letter to the Italian community encouraging them to inform on each other anonymously.\n\nThe letter ended on a menacing note:\n<blockquote>We hope this appeal will be met by you in the same spirit in which we issue it, and that this community will not be driven to harsh and stringent methods outside of the law, which may involve the innocent and guilty alike...Upon you and your willingness to give information depends which of these courses shall be pursued.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=115}}</blockquote>\n\nThe letter was signed by the Committee's chairman, [[Edgar Howard Farrar|Edgar H. Farrar]], who later served as president of the [[American Bar Association]].{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=21\u201322}} Other prominent members of the Committee included General [[Algernon Sidney Badger|Algernon S. Badger]], Judge [[Robert C. Davey]], politician [[Walter C. Flower]], Colonel [[James Lewis (Louisiana politician)|James Lewis]],<!-- Classified by Nussbaum as \"black\" in the binary system of race, Lewis was in fact of mixed race, with a white father and mixed-race mother. He may have been among the [[free people of color]] in Louisiana before the war. --> and architect [[Thomas Sully (architect)|Thomas Sully]].{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=146-147}}\n\nThe Committee of Fifty hired two private detectives to pose as prisoners and try to get the defendants to talk about the murder. Apparently the detectives did not obtain any useful information, because they were not asked to testify at the trial. Only Polizzi, who appeared to be mentally ill, said anything to incriminate himself, and his confession was deemed inadmissible.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=68}}\n\nMeanwhile, the defendants were subject to extremely negative pretrial publicity.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=278}} Across the country, newspapers ran headlines such as \"Vast Mafia in New Orleans\" and \"1,100 Dago Criminals\".{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=66}}\n\nSeveral shotguns were found near the scene of the crime. One was a [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] shotgun, a type which was widely used in New Orleans and throughout the South, but which police claimed was a \"favorite\" of Italians. Another had a hinged [[Stock (firearms)|stock]]. Local newspapers reported that such guns were imported from Italy; in fact they were manufactured by the [[W. Richards Company]].{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=15\u201316}}{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=265}}\n\nSpurred to action by the popular accounts of Hennessy's murder, a 29-year-old newspaper salesman named Thomas Duffy walked into the prison on October 17, 1890, sought out Antonio Scaffidi, whom he had heard was a suspect, and shot him in the neck with a revolver. Scaffidi survived the attack, only to be lynched a few months later. Duffy was eventually convicted of assault and sentenced to six months in prison.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=41\u201343}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xiv}}\n\n===Murder trial===\n\nA trial for nine of the suspects began on February 16, 1891, and concluded on March 13, 1891, with Judge Joshua G. Baker presiding.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xii}} The defendants were represented by Lionel Adams of the law firm Adams and O'Malley, and the state by district attorney Charles A. Luzenberg. Jury selection was a time-consuming process: Hundreds of prospective jurors were rejected before 12 people were found who were not opposed to capital punishment, were not openly prejudiced against Italians, and were not of Italian descent themselves.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=72}}{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=269}}\n\nMuch of the evidence presented at trial was weak or contradictory. The murder had taken place on a poorly lit street on a damp night,{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=129}} in a notoriously corrupt city,{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=264}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=33}} and the eyewitness testimony was unreliable. Suspects were identified by witnesses who had not seen their faces, but only their clothing. Captain Bill O'Connor, the witness who claimed to have heard Hennessy blame \"Dagoes\" for the assassination, was not called to testify. There were numerous other discrepancies and improprieties. At one point, two employees of the defense law firm were arrested for attempting to bribe prospective jurors.{{sfn|Botein|1979|pp=269\u2013270}} Afterward, when federal district attorney William Grant looked into the case, he reported that the evidence against the men was \"exceedingly unsatisfactory\" and inconclusive. He could find no evidence linking any of the lynched men to [[the Mafia]], or to any attempts to bribe the jury.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=114}} The bribery charges were eventually dismissed.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xv}}\n\nMantranga and another man, Bastian Incardona, were found not guilty by directed verdict, as no evidence had been presented against them. The jury declared four of the defendants not guilty, and asked the judge to declare a mistrial for the other three, as they could not agree on a verdict.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=192, 208}} The six who were acquitted were not released, but were held pending an additional charge of \"lying in wait\" with intent to commit murder. Luzenberg admitted that without a murder conviction, he would be forced to drop the \"lying in wait\" charges. But all nine men were returned to the prison\u2014a decision which would prove fatal for some of them.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=77}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=209}}\n\nThe jurors were given the option to leave by a side door, but chose to walk out the front door and face the angry crowd. Several defended their decision to reporters, arguing that they had \"reasonable doubt\" and had done what they thought was right.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=209}} Some were harassed, threatened, fired from their jobs, and otherwise penalized for failing to convict the Italians.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=103, 154}}\n\n===Incitement===\n[[File:Speaker inciting the mob in New Orleans on March 14, 1891.jpg|thumb|William S. Parkerson inciting the mob. ''Harper's Weekly'', March 28, 1891.]]\n\nA group of about 150 people, calling themselves the Committee on Safety (referring to the Revolutionary War era),  met that evening to plan their response. The following morning an ad appeared in local newspapers calling for a mass meeting at the statue of [[Henry Clay]], near the prison. Citizens were told to \"come prepared for action.\"{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=77}}\n\nThe ''Daily States'' editorialized:\n<blockquote>Rise, people of New Orleans! Alien hands of oath-bound assassins have set the blot of a martyr's blood upon your vaunted civilization! Your laws, in the very Temple of Justice, have been bought off, and suborners have caused to be turned loose upon your streets the midnight murderers of David C. Hennessy, in whose premature grave the very majesty of our American law lies buried with his mangled corpse \u2014 the corpse of him who in life was the representative, the conservator of your peace and dignity.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=216}}</blockquote>\n\nAs thousands of demonstrators gathered near the Parish Prison, Pasquale Corte, the Italian consul in New Orleans, sought the help of Louisiana governor [[Francis T. Nicholls]] to prevent an outbreak of violence. The governor declined to take any action without a request from Mayor Shakspeare, who had gone out to breakfast and could not be reached.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=78\u201381}} Meanwhile, at the Clay statue, attorney William S. Parkerson was exhorting the people of New Orleans to \"set aside the verdict of that infamous jury, every one of whom is a perjurer and a scoundrel.\"{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=157}} When the speech was over, the multi-racial crowd {{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=81,83}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=220}}{{sfn|NY Times, March 15, 1891}} marched to the prison, chanting, \"We want the Dagoes.\"{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=272}}\n\n==Lynching==\n\nInside the prison, as the mob was breaking down the door with a battering ram, prison warden Lemuel Davis let the 19 Italian prisoners out of their cells and told them to hide as best they could.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=82}}\n\nAlthough the thousands of demonstrators outside gave the sense that the lynching was a spontaneous outburst, the killings were carried out by a relatively small, disciplined \"execution squad\" led by Parkerson and three other city leaders: Walter Denegre, lawyer; James D. Houston, politician and businessman; and John C. Wickliffe, editor of the ''[[New Delta]]'' newspaper.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xii}}{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=83}} Other members of the lynch mob included [[John M. Parker]], who was elected as Louisiana's 37th governor, and [[Walter C. Flower]], who was elected as the 44th mayor of New Orleans.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=130}}{{sfn|Wall|2013|p=265}}\n\nThe mentally ill Polizzi was hauled outside, hanged from a lamppost, and shot. Antonio Bagnetto, a fruit peddler, was hanged from a tree and shot. Nine others were shot or clubbed to death inside the prison.{{sfn|Maselli|Candeloro|2004|p=35}} The bullet-riddled bodies of Polizzi and Bagnetto were left hanging for hours.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=83\u201386}}{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=272}}\n\n===Victims===\n\nThe following people were lynched:{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=xi\u2013xii}}\n\n* Antonio Bagnetto, fruit peddler: Tried and acquitted.\n* James Caruso, [[stevedore]]: Not tried.\n* Loreto Comitis, tinsmith: Not tried.\n* Rocco Geraci, stevedore: Not tried.\n* Joseph P. Macheca, fruit importer: Tried and acquitted.\n* Antonio Marchesi, fruit peddler: Tried and acquitted.\n* Pietro Monasterio, cobbler: Mistrial.\n* Emmanuele Polizzi, street vendor: Mistrial.\n* Frank Romero, ward politician: Not tried.\n* Antonio Scaffidi, fruit peddler: Mistrial.\n* Charles Traina, rice plantation laborer: Not tried.\n\nThe following people managed to escape lynching by hiding inside the prison:\n\n* John Caruso, stevedore: Not tried.\n* Bastian Incardona, laborer: Tried and acquitted.\n* Gaspare Marchesi, 14, son of Antonio Marchesi: Tried and acquitted.\n* Charles Mantranga, labor manager: Tried and acquitted.\n* Peter Natali, laborer: Not tried.\n* Charles Pietza (or Pietzo), grocer: Not tried.\n* Charles Patorno, merchant: Not tried.\n* Salvatore Sinceri, stevedore: Not tried.\n\nThe court and district attorney set the survivors free after the lynching, and dropped the charges against the men who had not yet been tried.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nOne of the victims, Polizzi, had a police record in the U.S., having reportedly cut a man with a knife in Austin, Texas, several years earlier. Two others had police records in Italy: Geraci had been accused of murder and had fled before he could be tried, and Comitz had been convicted of theft.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=186\u2013193}} Incardona was wanted in Italy as a petty criminal.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=14}}\n\nThree of the men\u2014Comitz, Monasterio, and Traina\u2014had not applied for U.S. citizenship and could still be considered Italian subjects.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=260}}\n\nAll of those lynched were Sicilian immigrants except for Macheca, a Louisiana native of Sicilian descent, and Comitz, who was from the Rome area. Shortly after Hennessy's death, the ''Daily States'' informed readers that the suspects were \"a villainous looking set\" and described their appearance in racist terms, concluding, \"They are not Italians, but Sicilians.\"{{sfn|Baiamonte|1992|p=124}}\n\nMost anti-Italian hostility in the United States was directed at [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]]s, particularly Sicilians. This was especially true in the American South, where Southern Italians were not considered full-fledged members of the \"white race\". The U.S. Bureau of Immigration reinforced this distinction, classifying Northern and Southern Italians as two different races.{{sfn|Puleo|2007|p=81}} Between 1890 and 1910, Sicilians made up less than 4 percent of the white male population, yet were roughly 40 percent of the white victims of southern lynch mobs. Before that, many white victims were ethnic Irish. They often had peripheral positions, working on construction of levees and railroads, and as farm workers.{{sfn|DeLucia|2003|pp=213\u2013215}}\n\nMacheca's personal history complicates this view of Sicilians as victims of white racism. He was born in 1843 to Sicilian parents in Louisiana, and adopted and raised by a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] man named Macheca. During the Civil War, he served in the Confederate army. In 1868, either Macheca or his adoptive father led a group of Sicilians in a violent, anti-black demonstration.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=44-45}} Although not a member of the [[White League]], as a captain of the First Louisiana Infantry Regiment, Macheca fought in the [[Battle of Liberty Place]] on the same side as the [[New Orleans|Crescent City]] [[White League]] in 1874. He was the leader of a group of Sicilians who called themselves \"The Innocents\"; depending on the source, this group was either a murderous gang of white supremacists,{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=45}} a precursor to the Louisiana Mafia, or a security force hired to protect Macheca and his businesses.{{sfn|Margavio|Salamone|2014|p=215}} The racial politics are further complicated by the fact that the 1891 lynch mob included some black residents.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=81}} In addition, Colonel [[James Lewis (Louisiana politician)|James Lewis]], a member of the elite Committee of Fifty, was a [[mixed-race]] African-American man who had been an officer in the Louisiana Native Guard and a leader in the Republican Party.{{sfn|Nussbaum|1977|p=810}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Press coverage===\n[[File:Cartoon that appeared in Puck on March 25, 1891.jpg|thumb|Cartoon that appeared in ''Puck'' on March 25, 1891.]]\nAmerican newspaper accounts at the time were largely sympathetic to the lynchers, and anti-Italian in tone.{{sfn|Wasserman|1998|p=78}}{{sfn|DeLucia|2003|pp=217\u2013218}}{{sfn|Puleo|2007|p=79}} The victims were presumed to have been involved with [[the Mafia]] and therefore deserving of their fate. A ''New York Times'' headline announced, \"Chief Hennessy Avenged...Italian Murderers Shot Down\".{{sfn|NY Times, March 15, 1891}} A ''Times'' editorial the next day vilified Sicilians in general:\n\n<blockquote>These sneaking and cowardly Sicilians, the descendants of bandits and assassins, who have transported to this country the lawless passions, the cut-throat practices, and the oath-bound societies of their native country, are to us a pest without mitigation. Our own rattlesnakes are as good citizens as they...Lynch law was the only course open to the people of New Orleans.{{sfn|NY Times, March 16, 1891}}</blockquote> \n\nMany commentators offered a ''[[wikt:pro forma|pro forma]]'' condemnation of vigilantism before ultimately blaming the victims and defending the lynchers.{{sfn|Puleo|2007|p=79}}{{sfn|Leach|1992|p=28}} Massachusetts representative [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], for example, claimed to deplore the mob's behavior, and then proceeded to justify it while proposing new restrictions on Italian immigration.{{sfn|Lodge|1891}} Even the ''London Times'' expressed approval.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=96}}\n\nNot all editors were convinced of the mob's innocence. The ''Charleston News and Courier'' argued that murder by vigilantes was no more acceptable than any other kind. The ''St. Louis Republic'' wrote that the men were killed \"on proof of being 'dagoes' and on the merest suspicion of being guilty of any other crime.\"{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=96}} Some Northern newspapers also condemned the lynchings. Many others, however, implicitly or explicitly condoned them.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=273}} A ''Boston Globe'' front-page headline read, \"STILETTO RULE: New Orleans Arose to Meet the Curse.\"{{sfn|Globe|1891|p=1}} Boston was another industrial city that had been receiving many immigrants from southern Italy.\n\nFollowing strong protests by the Italian government and the Italian-American community, the press eventually became less supportive of the lynchers.{{sfn|Wasserman|1998|p=78}}{{sfn|DeLucia|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\n===Criminal charges===\n\nA grand jury convened on March 17, 1891, to investigate the lynching. Judge Robert H. Marr, who presided over the jury, was a longtime personal friend of several of the lynch mob participants.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=275}} On May 5, 1891, the grand jury published a report concluding that several jurors in the Hennessy case had been bribed to acquit the Italians. No proof was offered and no criminal charges were pursued.\n\nThe grand jury claimed that it could not identify the participants in the lynching. In the same report, the lynching was described as a \"gathering\" of \"several thousands of the first, best, and even the most law-abiding, of the citizens of this city.\" No one was indicted.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=179}} Only Thomas Duffy, the newspaper salesman who had shot Scaffidi in October, was penalized. Duffy was serving time in the Parish Prison at the time of the lynching.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=229}}\n\nAfter the Hennessy case, at least eight more men of Italian descent were lynched in Louisiana during the 1890s. In each case, as was typical of lynchings, local authorities claimed to be unable to identify anyone involved and never prosecuted anyone for the murders.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=276}}\n\n===Political repercussions===\n\nThe incident strained relations between the U.S. and Italy. The Italian consul Pasquale Corte left New Orleans in late May 1891 and the ''New York Times'' published his statement accusing the city politicians of responsibility for the lynchings.<ref name=\"nyt524\"/> The Italian government demanded that the lynch mob be brought to justice and that reparations be paid to the dead men's families.<!--{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=260}}--> When the U.S. declined to prosecute the mob leaders, Italy recalled its ambassador from Washington in protest.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=95}} The U.S. followed suit, recalling its legation from Rome. Diplomatic relations remained at an impasse for over a year, and there were rumors of a declaration of war on America as a result of the murders. As part of a wider effort to ease tensions with Italy and placate Italian Americans, president [[Benjamin Harrison]] declared the first nationwide celebration of [[Columbus Day]] in 1892, commemorating the 400th anniversary of the Italian explorer's landing in the New World.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/12/opinion/columbus-day-italian-american-racism.html|title=Opinion: How Italians Became 'White'|last=Staples|first=Brent|date=2019-10-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nWhen President Harrison agreed to pay a $25,000 indemnity to the victims' families, Congress tried unsuccessfully to intervene against the reparations, accusing him of \"unconstitutional executive usurpation of Congressional powers\".{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=126\u2013127}} The US paid $2,211.90 to each family of the eleven victims. \n\nThe contrasting American and Italian attitudes toward the lynchings are perhaps best summarized by [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s comment. Roosevelt, then serving on the [[United States Civil Service Commission]], wrote to his sister [[Anna Roosevelt Cowles]] on March 21, 1891:\n<blockquote>Monday we dined at the Camerons; various [[Dago (slur)|dago]] diplomats were present, all much wrought up by the lynching of the Italians in New Orleans. Personally I think it rather a good thing, and said so.{{sfn|Roosevelt|1891|pp=1\u20132}}</blockquote>\n\nThe incident has been mostly forgotten in the U.S., relegated to the footnotes of American history texts. However, it is more widely known in [[Italy]].{{sfn|Donohue|2012}}{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=278}}\n\nMayor Shakspeare was narrowly defeated for reelection in 1892, with the Italian-American vote a decisive factor.{{sfn|Nelli|1981|p=65}} Gaspare Marchesi, the boy who survived by hiding in the prison while his father was lynched, was awarded $5,000 in damages in 1893 after suing the city of New Orleans.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xv}}\n\nThe death of Hennessy became a rallying cry for law enforcement and nativists to halt the immigration of Italians into America.{{sfn|Puleo|2007|pp=78\u201379}} [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] claimed that \"the paupers and criminals of Europe\" were \"pouring into the United States\" and proposed a literacy test to keep out the poorest immigrants.{{sfn|Lodge|1891|pp=611\u2013612}}\n\nThe Hennessy case introduced the word \"Mafia\" to the American public.{{sfn|Maselli|Candeloro|2004|p=36}} It generated the now-familiar stereotype of the Italian-American mafioso. Journalists of the time used the word \"Mafia\" loosely, to sell newspapers, often linking the crimes of individual Italians to organized crime when no evidence of such a connection existed.{{sfn|Botein|1979|pages=263\u2013264, 277, 279}}{{sfn|Kurtz|1983|pp=356\u2013357, 366}}{{sfn|Baiamonte|1992|pp=140\u2013141}}<!--{{sfn|Puleo|2007|p=78}}--> After the lynching, newspapers circulated wild rumors that thousands of Italian Americans were plotting to attack New Orleans, and were wrecking railroads in New York and [[Chicago]].{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=273}} The press reported that the defense lawyers in the Hennessy case were paid by the Mafia, when Italian-language newspapers in cities across the country had raised funds for the men's legal defense.{{sfn|Nelli|1981|p=56}} Soon historians were applying the \"Mafia\" label retroactively to crimes committed by Italians in the past.{{sfn|Baiamonte|1992|pp=143\u2013144}}\n\nFor decades after the lynching, New Orleans children of other ethnicities would taunt Italian Americans with the phrase, \"Who killa de chief?\"{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=285}}\n\n===Books and films===\n\nFor the better part of a century, most historians relied on contemporary newspaper accounts as their primary sources of information about the lynching, seldom questioning the guilt of the lynched men or the popular assumption that Hennessy's murder was a Mafia assassination. In the 1970s, two studies by Italian Americans challenged the prevailing view.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=291}}{{sfn|Baiamonte|1992|p=120}}{{sfn|Kurtz|1983|p=357}}\n\nHumbert Nelli, a professor of history at the [[University of Kentucky]], examines the Hennessy case in a chapter of ''The Business of Crime'' (1976). Nelli demonstrates that the evidence against the men was weak, and argues that the murder was too poorly planned and amateurish to have been a Mafia hit.{{sfn|Nelli|1981|p=59}} In a chapter on crime in New Orleans, he claims that although crime flourished among the city's southern Italians at the time, it could not accurately be attributed to ''mafiosi''.{{sfn|Nelli|1981|pp=36\u201337}}\n\nIn ''Vendetta: The True Story of the Largest Lynching in U.S. History'' (1977),<ref group=note>The original title was ''Vendetta: A True Story of the Worst Lynching in America, the Mass Murder of Italian-Americans in New Orleans in 1891, the Vicious Motivations Behind It, and the Tragic Repercussions that Linger to This Day''.</ref> Richard Gambino, a professor at [[City University of New York]], raises numerous questions about the investigation and trial, and proposes an alternative theory about Hennessy's murder. Among other things, Gambino notes that Hennessy had a \"colorful\" past that provided any number of possible motives to be subject to murder, none of which the police chose to investigate. He also notes that shortly after the lynching, the city passed an ordinance giving control of all New Orleans dock work to the newly formed Louisiana Construction and Improvement Corporation, a business headed by several of the lynch mob leaders. Italian waterfront merchants and workers, who had been making remarkable economic progress up to then, were thus eliminated as competitors.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=103}}\n\nThe 1999 [[HBO]] movie ''[[Vendetta (1999 film)|Vendetta]]'', starring [[Christopher Walken]] and directed by [[Nicholas Meyer]], is based on Gambino's book.{{sfn|Webb|2000|pp=1155\u20131156}} It portrays Macheca and several of the other lynched men as innocent victims. It is narrated by the character of Gaspare Marchesi, the boy who escaped being lynched by hiding in the prison.\n\nReviewers have criticized Gambino's language as sensational and partisan while acknowledging the book's merits.{{sfn|Botein|1978|pp=505\u2013506}}{{sfn|Jackson|1977|pp=628\u2013629}}{{sfn|Wiley|Pozzetta|1978|pp=378\u2013379}} Writing in the ''Journal of American History'' in 1977, Raymond Nussbaum (an alumnus of [[Tulane University]]) suggested that historians looking for a balanced account of the lynching look elsewhere.{{sfn|Nussbaum|1977|p=810}} In a film review that appeared in the same journal in 2000, Clive Webb calls the movie a \"compelling portrait of prejudice\" and recommends that historians consult the book for more information.{{sfn|Webb|2000|pp=1155\u20131156}}\n\nThe lynching is discussed in the 2004 documentary, ''Linciati: Lynchings of Italians in America'', directed by M. Heather Hartley.{{sfn|Donohue|2012}} Lynchings of Italians are also mentioned in various documentaries on the Italian-American experience.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Italians in New Orleans]]\n* [[Anti-Italianism#Anti-Italianism in the United States|Anti-Italianism in the United States]]\n* [[Italian Americans#Discrimination and stereotyping|Italian Americans: Discrimination and stereotyping]]\n* [[Lynching in the United States]]\n* [[Italy\u2013United States relations]]\n* [[Sacco and Vanzetti]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Books===\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Gambino|first1=Richard |authorlink=Richard Gambino |title=Vendetta: The True Story of the Largest Lynching in U.S. History|date=2000|publisher=Guernica|isbn=9781550711035}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Margavio |first1=A.

Six of these defendants were acquitted, and a mistrial was declared for the remaining three because the jury failed to agree on their verdicts. There was widespread suspicion in the city that an Italian network of criminals was responsible for the killing of the police chief, in a period of anti-Italian sentiment and rising crime. Believing the jury had been bribed, a mob broke into the jail where the men were being held and killed eleven of the prisoners, most by shooting. The mob outside the jail numbered in the thousands and included some of the city's most prominent citizens. American press coverage of the event was largely congratulatory, and those responsible for the lynching were never charged.\n\nThe incident had serious national repercussions. The Italian consul Pasquale Corte in New Orleans registered a protest and left the city in May 1891 at his government's direction. The ''[[New York Times]]'' published his lengthy statement charging city politicians with responsibility for the lynching of the Italians.<ref name=\"nyt524\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1891/05/24/103309443.html?pageNumber=1 \"Signor Corte's Farewell/His Story of the Lynching of the Italians\"], ''New York Times'', 24 May 1891; accessed 5 February 2018</ref> Italy cut off diplomatic relations with the United States, sparking rumors of war. Increased [[Anti-Italianism#Anti-Italianism in the United States|anti-Italian]] sentiment led to calls for restrictions on immigration. The word \"[[Mafia]]\" entered the American lexicon, and the stereotype of the [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian mafioso]] became established in the popular imagination.\n\nThe lynchings were the subject of the 1999 [[HBO]] movie ''[[Vendetta (1999 film)|Vendetta]]'', starring [[Christopher Walken]]. The movie is based on a 1977 history book of the same name by [[Richard Gambino]].\n\n==Background==\n===Anti-Italian sentiment in New Orleans===\n\nIn late 19th-century America, there was a growing prejudice against Italians, although they were recruited to satisfy the demand for cheap labor. They were immigrating to the American South, particularly Florida and Louisiana, in large numbers because of poor conditions at home and to fill the shortage of cheap labor created by the end of slavery and the preference of freedmen to work on their own accounts as sharecroppers. Sugar planters, in particular, sought workers who were more compliant than former slaves; they hired immigrant recruiters to bring Italians to southern Louisiana. In the 1890s, thousands of Italians were arriving in New Orleans each year. Many settled in the [[French Quarter]], which by the early 20th century became known as \"Little Sicily.\"{{sfn|Liles|2017}}\n\nIn a letter responding to an inquiry about immigration in New Orleans, Mayor [[Joseph A. Shakspeare]] expressed the common anti-Italian prejudice, complaining that the city had become attractive to \"...the worst classes of Europe: Southern Italians and Sicilians...the most idle, vicious, and worthless people among us.\" He claimed they were \"filthy in their persons and homes\" and blamed them for the spread of disease, concluding that they were \"without courage, honor, truth, pride, religion, or any quality that goes to make a good citizen.\"{{sfn|Liles|2017}}\n\n===Assassination of David Hennessy===\n[[File:HennessySceneOfTheAssassination.jpg|thumb|Artist's conception of Hennessy's murder. \"Scene of the Assassination\", ''The Mascot'', New Orleans, 1890.]]\n\nOn the evening of October 15, 1890, New Orleans police chief David Hennessy was shot by several gunmen as he walked home from work. Hennessy returned fire and chased his attackers before collapsing. When asked who had shot him, Hennessy reportedly whispered to Captain William O'Connor, \"[[wikt:dago|Dagoes]]\" (a derogatory term for Italians and others of Mediterranean heritage). Hennessy was awake in the hospital for several hours after the shooting, and spoke to friends, but did not name the shooters. The next day complications set in and he died.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=4}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xxiv}}\n\nThere had been an ongoing feud between the Provenzano and Mantranga<ref group=note>Also spelled \"Matranga\" in some documents.</ref> families, who were business rivals on the New Orleans waterfront. Hennessy had put several of the Provenzanos in prison, and their appeal trial was coming up. According to some reports, Hennessy had been planning to offer new evidence at the trial that would clear the Provenzanos and implicate the Mantrangas. If true, this would mean that the Mantrangas, and not the Provenzanos, had a motive for the murder.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=264}} A policeman who was a friend of Hennessy's later testified that Hennessy had told him he had no such plans.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=76}} In any case, it was widely believed that Hennessy's killers were Italian. Local papers such as the ''Times-Democrat'' and the ''Daily Picayune'' freely blamed \"Dagoes\" for the murder.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=267}}\n\n===Investigation===\nThe murder was quickly followed by mass arrests of local Italians. Mayor [[Joseph A. Shakspeare]] (according to the ''Picayune'') told the police to \"scour the whole neighborhood. Arrest every Italian you come across.\" Within 24 hours, 45 people had been arrested.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=265}} By some accounts, as many as 250 Italians were rounded up.{{sfn|Maselli|Candeloro|2004|p=35}} Most were eventually released for lack of evidence.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=266}} Local Italians were afraid to leave their homes for several days after the murder, but eventually the furor died down and they returned to work.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=267}}\n\nNineteen men were ultimately charged with the murder or as accessories and held without bail in the Parish Prison. These included Charles Mantranga, who was charged with plotting the murder, and several of the Mantranga's friends and workers. Pietro Monasterio, a shoemaker, was arrested because he lived across the street from where Hennessy was standing when he was shot. Antonio Marchesi, a fruit peddler, was arrested because he was a friend of Monasterio's and \"was known to frequent his shoe shop.\"{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=150, 14}} Emmanuele Polizzi was arrested when a policeman identified him as one of the men he had seen running from the scene of the crime.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=266}}\n\nA few days after Hennessy's death, Mayor Shakspeare gave a speech declaring that Hennessy had been \"the victim of Sicilian vengeance\" and calling upon the citizenry to \"teach these people a lesson they will not forget.\"{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=144}} He appointed a Committee of Fifty to investigate \"the existence of secret societies or bands of oath-bound assassins...and to devise necessary means and the most effectual and speedy measures for the uprooting and total annihilation\" of any such organizations.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=266}} On October 23, the committee published an open letter to the Italian community encouraging them to inform on each other anonymously.\n\nThe letter ended on a menacing note:\n<blockquote>We hope this appeal will be met by you in the same spirit in which we issue it, and that this community will not be driven to harsh and stringent methods outside of the law, which may involve the innocent and guilty alike...Upon you and your willingness to give information depends which of these courses shall be pursued.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=115}}</blockquote>\n\nThe letter was signed by the Committee's chairman, [[Edgar Howard Farrar|Edgar H. Farrar]], who later served as president of the [[American Bar Association]].{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=21\u201322}} Other prominent members of the Committee included General [[Algernon Sidney Badger|Algernon S. Badger]], Judge [[Robert C. Davey]], politician [[Walter C. Flower]], Colonel [[James Lewis (Louisiana politician)|James Lewis]],<!-- Classified by Nussbaum as \"black\" in the binary system of race, Lewis was in fact of mixed race, with a white father and mixed-race mother. He may have been among the [[free people of color]] in Louisiana before the war. --> and architect [[Thomas Sully (architect)|Thomas Sully]].{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=146-147}}\n\nThe Committee of Fifty hired two private detectives to pose as prisoners and try to get the defendants to talk about the murder. Apparently the detectives did not obtain any useful information, because they were not asked to testify at the trial. Only Polizzi, who appeared to be mentally ill, said anything to incriminate himself, and his confession was deemed inadmissible.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=68}}\n\nMeanwhile, the defendants were subject to extremely negative pretrial publicity.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=278}} Across the country, newspapers ran headlines such as \"Vast Mafia in New Orleans\" and \"1,100 Dago Criminals\".{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=66}}\n\nSeveral shotguns were found near the scene of the crime. One was a [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] shotgun, a type which was widely used in New Orleans and throughout the South, but which police claimed was a \"favorite\" of Italians. Another had a hinged [[Stock (firearms)|stock]]. Local newspapers reported that such guns were imported from Italy; in fact they were manufactured by the [[W. Richards Company]].{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=15\u201316}}{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=265}}\n\nSpurred to action by the popular accounts of Hennessy's murder, a 29-year-old newspaper salesman named Thomas Duffy walked into the prison on October 17, 1890, sought out Antonio Scaffidi, whom he had heard was a suspect, and shot him in the neck with a revolver. Scaffidi survived the attack, only to be lynched a few months later. Duffy was eventually convicted of assault and sentenced to six months in prison.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=41\u201343}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xiv}}\n\n===Murder trial===\n\nA trial for nine of the suspects began on February 16, 1891, and concluded on March 13, 1891, with Judge Joshua G. Baker presiding.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xii}} The defendants were represented by Lionel Adams of the law firm Adams and O'Malley, and the state by district attorney Charles A. Luzenberg. Jury selection was a time-consuming process: Hundreds of prospective jurors were rejected before 12 people were found who were not opposed to capital punishment, were not openly prejudiced against Italians, and were not of Italian descent themselves.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=72}}{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=269}}\n\nMuch of the evidence presented at trial was weak or contradictory. The murder had taken place on a poorly lit street on a damp night,{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=129}} in a notoriously corrupt city,{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=264}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=33}} and the eyewitness testimony was unreliable. Suspects were identified by witnesses who had not seen their faces, but only their clothing. Captain Bill O'Connor, the witness who claimed to have heard Hennessy blame \"Dagoes\" for the assassination, was not called to testify. There were numerous other discrepancies and improprieties. At one point, two employees of the defense law firm were arrested for attempting to bribe prospective jurors.{{sfn|Botein|1979|pp=269\u2013270}} Afterward, when federal district attorney William Grant looked into the case, he reported that the evidence against the men was \"exceedingly unsatisfactory\" and inconclusive. He could find no evidence linking any of the lynched men to [[the Mafia]], or to any attempts to bribe the jury.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=114}} The bribery charges were eventually dismissed.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xv}}\n\nMantranga and another man, Bastian Incardona, were found not guilty by directed verdict, as no evidence had been presented against them. The jury declared four of the defendants not guilty, and asked the judge to declare a mistrial for the other three, as they could not agree on a verdict.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=192, 208}} The six who were acquitted were not released, but were held pending an additional charge of \"lying in wait\" with intent to commit murder. Luzenberg admitted that without a murder conviction, he would be forced to drop the \"lying in wait\" charges. But all nine men were returned to the prison\u2014a decision which would prove fatal for some of them.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=77}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=209}}\n\nThe jurors were given the option to leave by a side door, but chose to walk out the front door and face the angry crowd. Several defended their decision to reporters, arguing that they had \"reasonable doubt\" and had done what they thought was right.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=209}} Some were harassed, threatened, fired from their jobs, and otherwise penalized for failing to convict the Italians.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=103, 154}}\n\n===Incitement===\n[[File:Speaker inciting the mob in New Orleans on March 14, 1891.jpg|thumb|William S. Parkerson inciting the mob. ''Harper's Weekly'', March 28, 1891.]]\n\nA group of about 150 people, calling themselves the Committee on Safety (referring to the Revolutionary War era),  met that evening to plan their response. The following morning an ad appeared in local newspapers calling for a mass meeting at the statue of [[Henry Clay]], near the prison. Citizens were told to \"come prepared for action.\"{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=77}}\n\nThe ''Daily States'' editorialized:\n<blockquote>Rise, people of New Orleans! Alien hands of oath-bound assassins have set the blot of a martyr's blood upon your vaunted civilization! Your laws, in the very Temple of Justice, have been bought off, and suborners have caused to be turned loose upon your streets the midnight murderers of David C. Hennessy, in whose premature grave the very majesty of our American law lies buried with his mangled corpse \u2014 the corpse of him who in life was the representative, the conservator of your peace and dignity.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=216}}</blockquote>\n\nAs thousands of demonstrators gathered near the Parish Prison, Pasquale Corte, the Italian consul in New Orleans, sought the help of Louisiana governor [[Francis T. Nicholls]] to prevent an outbreak of violence. The governor declined to take any action without a request from Mayor Shakspeare, who had gone out to breakfast and could not be reached.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=78\u201381}} Meanwhile, at the Clay statue, attorney William S. Parkerson was exhorting the people of New Orleans to \"set aside the verdict of that infamous jury, every one of whom is a perjurer and a scoundrel.\"{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=157}} When the speech was over, the multi-racial crowd {{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=81,83}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=220}}{{sfn|NY Times, March 15, 1891}} marched to the prison, chanting, \"We want the Dagoes.\"{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=272}}\n\n==Lynching==\n\nInside the prison, as the mob was breaking down the door with a battering ram, prison warden Lemuel Davis let the 19 Italian prisoners out of their cells and told them to hide as best they could.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=82}}\n\nAlthough the thousands of demonstrators outside gave the sense that the lynching was a spontaneous outburst, the killings were carried out by a relatively small, disciplined \"execution squad\" led by Parkerson and three other city leaders: Walter Denegre, lawyer; James D. Houston, politician and businessman; and John C. Wickliffe, editor of the ''[[New Delta]]'' newspaper.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xii}}{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=83}} Other members of the lynch mob included [[John M. Parker]], who was elected as Louisiana's 37th governor, and [[Walter C. Flower]], who was elected as the 44th mayor of New Orleans.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=130}}{{sfn|Wall|2013|p=265}}\n\nThe mentally ill Polizzi was hauled outside, hanged from a lamppost, and shot. Antonio Bagnetto, a fruit peddler, was hanged from a tree and shot. Nine others were shot or clubbed to death inside the prison.{{sfn|Maselli|Candeloro|2004|p=35}} The bullet-riddled bodies of Polizzi and Bagnetto were left hanging for hours.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=83\u201386}}{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=272}}\n\n===Victims===\n\nThe following people were lynched:{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=xi\u2013xii}}\n\n* Antonio Bagnetto, fruit peddler: Tried and acquitted.\n* James Caruso, [[stevedore]]: Not tried.\n* Loreto Comitis, tinsmith: Not tried.\n* Rocco Geraci, stevedore: Not tried.\n* Joseph P. Macheca, fruit importer: Tried and acquitted.\n* Antonio Marchesi, fruit peddler: Tried and acquitted.\n* Pietro Monasterio, cobbler: Mistrial.\n* Emmanuele Polizzi, street vendor: Mistrial.\n* Frank Romero, ward politician: Not tried.\n* Antonio Scaffidi, fruit peddler: Mistrial.\n* Charles Traina, rice plantation laborer: Not tried.\n\nThe following people managed to escape lynching by hiding inside the prison:\n\n* John Caruso, stevedore: Not tried.\n* Bastian Incardona, laborer: Tried and acquitted.\n* Gaspare Marchesi, 14, son of Antonio Marchesi: Tried and acquitted.\n* Charles Mantranga, labor manager: Tried and acquitted.\n* Peter Natali, laborer: Not tried.\n* Charles Pietza (or Pietzo), grocer: Not tried.\n* Charles Patorno, merchant: Not tried.\n* Salvatore Sinceri, stevedore: Not tried.\n\nThe court and district attorney set the survivors free after the lynching, and dropped the charges against the men who had not yet been tried.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nOne of the victims, Polizzi, had a police record in the U.S., having reportedly cut a man with a knife in Austin, Texas, several years earlier. Two others had police records in Italy: Geraci had been accused of murder and had fled before he could be tried, and Comitz had been convicted of theft.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=186\u2013193}} Incardona was wanted in Italy as a petty criminal.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=14}}\n\nThree of the men\u2014Comitz, Monasterio, and Traina\u2014had not applied for U.S. citizenship and could still be considered Italian subjects.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=260}}\n\nAll of those lynched were Sicilian immigrants except for Macheca, a Louisiana native of Sicilian descent, and Comitz, who was from the Rome area. Shortly after Hennessy's death, the ''Daily States'' informed readers that the suspects were \"a villainous looking set\" and described their appearance in racist terms, concluding, \"They are not Italians, but Sicilians.\"{{sfn|Baiamonte|1992|p=124}}\n\nMost anti-Italian hostility in the United States was directed at [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]]s, particularly Sicilians. This was especially true in the American South, where Southern Italians were not considered full-fledged members of the \"white race\". The U.S. Bureau of Immigration reinforced this distinction, classifying Northern and Southern Italians as two different races.{{sfn|Puleo|2007|p=81}} Between 1890 and 1910, Sicilians made up less than 4 percent of the white male population, yet were roughly 40 percent of the white victims of southern lynch mobs. Before that, many white victims were ethnic Irish. They often had peripheral positions, working on construction of levees and railroads, and as farm workers.{{sfn|DeLucia|2003|pp=213\u2013215}}\n\nMacheca's personal history complicates this view of Sicilians as victims of white racism. He was born in 1843 to Sicilian parents in Louisiana, and adopted and raised by a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] man named Macheca. During the Civil War, he served in the Confederate army. In 1868, either Macheca or his adoptive father led a group of Sicilians in a violent, anti-black demonstration.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=44-45}} Although not a member of the [[White League]], as a captain of the First Louisiana Infantry Regiment, Macheca fought in the [[Battle of Liberty Place]] on the same side as the [[New Orleans|Crescent City]] [[White League]] in 1874. He was the leader of a group of Sicilians who called themselves \"The Innocents\"; depending on the source, this group was either a murderous gang of white supremacists,{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=45}} a precursor to the Louisiana Mafia, or a security force hired to protect Macheca and his businesses.{{sfn|Margavio|Salamone|2014|p=215}} The racial politics are further complicated by the fact that the 1891 lynch mob included some black residents.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=81}} In addition, Colonel [[James Lewis (Louisiana politician)|James Lewis]], a member of the elite Committee of Fifty, was a [[mixed-race]] African-American man who had been an officer in the Louisiana Native Guard and a leader in the Republican Party.{{sfn|Nussbaum|1977|p=810}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Press coverage===\n[[File:Cartoon that appeared in Puck on March 25, 1891.jpg|thumb|Cartoon that appeared in ''Puck'' on March 25, 1891.]]\nAmerican newspaper accounts at the time were largely sympathetic to the lynchers, and anti-Italian in tone.{{sfn|Wasserman|1998|p=78}}{{sfn|DeLucia|2003|pp=217\u2013218}}{{sfn|Puleo|2007|p=79}} The victims were presumed to have been involved with [[the Mafia]] and therefore deserving of their fate. A ''New York Times'' headline announced, \"Chief Hennessy Avenged...Italian Murderers Shot Down\".{{sfn|NY Times, March 15, 1891}} A ''Times'' editorial the next day vilified Sicilians in general:\n\n<blockquote>These sneaking and cowardly Sicilians, the descendants of bandits and assassins, who have transported to this country the lawless passions, the cut-throat practices, and the oath-bound societies of their native country, are to us a pest without mitigation. Our own rattlesnakes are as good citizens as they...Lynch law was the only course open to the people of New Orleans.{{sfn|NY Times, March 16, 1891}}</blockquote> \n\nMany commentators offered a ''[[wikt:pro forma|pro forma]]'' condemnation of vigilantism before ultimately blaming the victims and defending the lynchers.{{sfn|Puleo|2007|p=79}}{{sfn|Leach|1992|p=28}} Massachusetts representative [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], for example, claimed to deplore the mob's behavior, and then proceeded to justify it while proposing new restrictions on Italian immigration.{{sfn|Lodge|1891}} Even the ''London Times'' expressed approval.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=96}}\n\nNot all editors were convinced of the mob's innocence. The ''Charleston News and Courier'' argued that murder by vigilantes was no more acceptable than any other kind. The ''St. Louis Republic'' wrote that the men were killed \"on proof of being 'dagoes' and on the merest suspicion of being guilty of any other crime.\"{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=96}} Some Northern newspapers also condemned the lynchings. Many others, however, implicitly or explicitly condoned them.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=273}} A ''Boston Globe'' front-page headline read, \"STILETTO RULE: New Orleans Arose to Meet the Curse.\"{{sfn|Globe|1891|p=1}} Boston was another industrial city that had been receiving many immigrants from southern Italy.\n\nFollowing strong protests by the Italian government and the Italian-American community, the press eventually became less supportive of the lynchers.{{sfn|Wasserman|1998|p=78}}{{sfn|DeLucia|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\n===Criminal charges===\n\nA grand jury convened on March 17, 1891, to investigate the lynching. Judge Robert H. Marr, who presided over the jury, was a longtime personal friend of several of the lynch mob participants.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=275}} On May 5, 1891, the grand jury published a report concluding that several jurors in the Hennessy case had been bribed to acquit the Italians. No proof was offered and no criminal charges were pursued.\n\nThe grand jury claimed that it could not identify the participants in the lynching. In the same report, the lynching was described as a \"gathering\" of \"several thousands of the first, best, and even the most law-abiding, of the citizens of this city.\" No one was indicted.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=179}} Only Thomas Duffy, the newspaper salesman who had shot Scaffidi in October, was penalized. Duffy was serving time in the Parish Prison at the time of the lynching.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=229}}\n\nAfter the Hennessy case, at least eight more men of Italian descent were lynched in Louisiana during the 1890s. In each case, as was typical of lynchings, local authorities claimed to be unable to identify anyone involved and never prosecuted anyone for the murders.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=276}}\n\n===Political repercussions===\n\nThe incident strained relations between the U.S. and Italy. The Italian consul Pasquale Corte left New Orleans in late May 1891 and the ''New York Times'' published his statement accusing the city politicians of responsibility for the lynchings.<ref name=\"nyt524\"/> The Italian government demanded that the lynch mob be brought to justice and that reparations be paid to the dead men's families.<!--{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=260}}--> When the U.S. declined to prosecute the mob leaders, Italy recalled its ambassador from Washington in protest.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=95}} The U.S. followed suit, recalling its legation from Rome. Diplomatic relations remained at an impasse for over a year, and there were rumors of a declaration of war on America as a result of the murders. As part of a wider effort to ease tensions with Italy and placate Italian Americans, president [[Benjamin Harrison]] declared the first nationwide celebration of [[Columbus Day]] in 1892, commemorating the 400th anniversary of the Italian explorer's landing in the New World.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/12/opinion/columbus-day-italian-american-racism.html|title=Opinion: How Italians Became 'White'|last=Staples|first=Brent|date=2019-10-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nWhen President Harrison agreed to pay a $25,000 indemnity to the victims' families, Congress tried unsuccessfully to intervene against the reparations, accusing him of \"unconstitutional executive usurpation of Congressional powers\".{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=126\u2013127}} The US paid $2,211.90 to each family of the eleven victims. \n\nThe contrasting American and Italian attitudes toward the lynchings are perhaps best summarized by [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s comment. Roosevelt, then serving on the [[United States Civil Service Commission]], wrote to his sister [[Anna Roosevelt Cowles]] on March 21, 1891:\n<blockquote>Monday we dined at the Camerons; various [[Dago (slur)|dago]] diplomats were present, all much wrought up by the lynching of the Italians in New Orleans. Personally I think it rather a good thing, and said so.{{sfn|Roosevelt|1891|pp=1\u20132}}</blockquote>\n\nThe incident has been mostly forgotten in the U.S., relegated to the footnotes of American history texts. However, it is more widely known in [[Italy]].{{sfn|Donohue|2012}}{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=278}}\n\nMayor Shakspeare was narrowly defeated for reelection in 1892, with the Italian-American vote a decisive factor.{{sfn|Nelli|1981|p=65}} Gaspare Marchesi, the boy who survived by hiding in the prison while his father was lynched, was awarded $5,000 in damages in 1893 after suing the city of New Orleans.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xv}}\n\nThe death of Hennessy became a rallying cry for law enforcement and nativists to halt the immigration of Italians into America.{{sfn|Puleo|2007|pp=78\u201379}} [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] claimed that \"the paupers and criminals of Europe\" were \"pouring into the United States\" and proposed a literacy test to keep out the poorest immigrants.{{sfn|Lodge|1891|pp=611\u2013612}}\n\nThe Hennessy case introduced the word \"Mafia\" to the American public.{{sfn|Maselli|Candeloro|2004|p=36}} It generated the now-familiar stereotype of the Italian-American mafioso. Journalists of the time used the word \"Mafia\" loosely, to sell newspapers, often linking the crimes of individual Italians to organized crime when no evidence of such a connection existed.{{sfn|Botein|1979|pages=263\u2013264, 277, 279}}{{sfn|Kurtz|1983|pp=356\u2013357, 366}}{{sfn|Baiamonte|1992|pp=140\u2013141}}<!--{{sfn|Puleo|2007|p=78}}--> After the lynching, newspapers circulated wild rumors that thousands of Italian Americans were plotting to attack New Orleans, and were wrecking railroads in New York and [[Chicago]].{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=273}} The press reported that the defense lawyers in the Hennessy case were paid by the Mafia, when Italian-language newspapers in cities across the country had raised funds for the men's legal defense.{{sfn|Nelli|1981|p=56}} Soon historians were applying the \"Mafia\" label retroactively to crimes committed by Italians in the past.{{sfn|Baiamonte|1992|pp=143\u2013144}}\n\nFor decades after the lynching, New Orleans children of other ethnicities would taunt Italian Americans with the phrase, \"Who killa de chief?\"{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=285}}\n\n===Books and films===\n\nFor the better part of a century, most historians relied on contemporary newspaper accounts as their primary sources of information about the lynching, seldom questioning the guilt of the lynched men or the popular assumption that Hennessy's murder was a Mafia assassination.

Nelli demonstrates that the evidence against the men was weak, and argues that the murder was too poorly planned and amateurish to have been a Mafia hit.{{sfn|Nelli|1981|p=59}} In a chapter on crime in New Orleans, he claims that although crime flourished among the city's southern Italians at the time, it could not accurately be attributed to ''mafiosi''.{{sfn|Nelli|1981|pp=36\u201337}}\n\nIn ''Vendetta: The True Story of the Largest Lynching in U.S. History'' (1977),<ref group=note>The original title was ''Vendetta: A True Story of the Worst Lynching in America, the Mass Murder of Italian-Americans in New Orleans in 1891, the Vicious Motivations Behind It, and the Tragic Repercussions that Linger to This Day''.</ref> Richard Gambino, a professor at [[City University of New York]], raises numerous questions about the investigation and trial, and proposes an alternative theory about Hennessy's murder. Among other things, Gambino notes that Hennessy had a \"colorful\" past that provided any number of possible motives to be subject to murder, none of which the police chose to investigate. He also notes that shortly after the lynching, the city passed an ordinance giving control of all New Orleans dock work to the newly formed Louisiana Construction and Improvement Corporation, a business headed by several of the lynch mob leaders. Italian waterfront merchants and workers, who had been making remarkable economic progress up to then, were thus eliminated as competitors.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=103}}\n\nThe 1999 [[HBO]] movie ''[[Vendetta (1999 film)|Vendetta]]'', starring [[Christopher Walken]] and directed by [[Nicholas Meyer]], is based on Gambino's book.{{sfn|Webb|2000|pp=1155\u20131156}} It portrays Macheca and several of the other lynched men as innocent victims. It is narrated by the character of Gaspare Marchesi, the boy who escaped being lynched by hiding in the prison.\n\nReviewers have criticized Gambino's language as sensational and partisan while acknowledging the book's merits.{{sfn|Botein|1978|pp=505\u2013506}}{{sfn|Jackson|1977|pp=628\u2013629}}{{sfn|Wiley|Pozzetta|1978|pp=378\u2013379}} Writing in the ''Journal of American History'' in 1977, Raymond Nussbaum (an alumnus of [[Tulane University]]) suggested that historians looking for a balanced account of the lynching look elsewhere.{{sfn|Nussbaum|1977|p=810}} In a film review that appeared in the same journal in 2000, Clive Webb calls the movie a \"compelling portrait of prejudice\" and recommends that historians consult the book for more information.{{sfn|Webb|2000|pp=1155\u20131156}}\n\nThe lynching is discussed in the 2004 documentary, ''Linciati: Lynchings of Italians in America'', directed by M.

Some of the more prominent members of the association were [[George Granville Bradley]], Master of [[University College, Oxford|University College]], [[T. H. Green]], a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of [[Balliol College]], and [[Edward Stuart Talbot]], Warden of [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]]. Talbot insisted on a specifically [[Anglican]] institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group (the \"[[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] camp\") founded [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], which opened its doors for students in 1879, the same year as Somerville did.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}\n\nThus, in 1879, a second committee was formed to create a college \"in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations.\"{{efn|Originally LMH only admitted students who were practicing members of the [[Church of England]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}}}{{sfn |Batson |2008 |pp=22-23}} This committee was called the \"[[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] camp\" and had close ties to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=21}}{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} This second committee included [[Sir Arthur Dyke Acland, 13th Baronet|A.

G. Vernon Harcourt]] and [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mary Ward]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} Other people who assisted in the founding were [[Anna Swanwick]], [[Bertha Johnson]] and [[Owen Roberts (educator)|Owen Roberts]].\n\nThis new effort resulted in the founding of ''Somerville Hall'', named after the then recently deceased Scottish mathematician and renowned scientific writer [[Mary Somerville]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}} It was felt that the name would reflect the virtues of liberalism and academic success which the college wished to embody.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=23}} She was admired by the founders of the college as a scholar, as well as for her religious and political views, including her conviction that women should have equality in terms of suffrage and access to education.\n\n[[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] was chosen as the first principal because, although not a well-known academic at the time, her background was felt to reflect the college's political stance.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=24}} Because of its status as both women's college and non-denominational institution, Somerville was widely regarded within Oxford as \"an eccentric and somewhat alarming institution.\"{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=25}}\n\n[[File:Thomas Phillips - Mary Fairfax, Mrs William Somerville, 1780 - 1872. Writer on science - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Somerville]], 1780\u20131872, after whom the college is named]]\n\n===Women's college===\nWhen opened, Somerville Hall had twelve students, ranging in age between 17 and 36.{{sfn|Batson|2008|p=26}} The first 21 students from Somerville and Lady Margaret Hall attended lectures in rooms above a baker's shop on [[Little Clarendon Street]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=33}} Just two of the original 12 students admitted in 1879 remained in Oxford for three years, the period of residence required for male students to complete a [[bachelor's degree]].{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=28}}\n\nIncreasingly, however, as the college admitted more students, it became more formalized. Somerville appointed its first in-house tutor in 1892 and, by the end of the 1890s, female students were permitted to attend lectures in almost all colleges.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=375; 418}} In 1891 it became the first women's hall to introduce entrance exams and in 1894 the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of college (changing its name to Somerville College),{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=47}} the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, and the first to build [[Somerville College Library|a library]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}} In Oxford legend it soon became known as the \"[[bluestocking]] college\", its excellent examination results refuting the widespread belief that women were incapable of high academic achievement.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}}\n\nIn the 1910s, Somerville became known for its support for the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] campaign.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} In 1920, Oxford University allowed women to matriculate and therefore gain degrees.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=xv}} From the college's inception, all female students had to be chaperoned when in the presence of male students. The practice was abolished in 1925, although male visitors to the college were still subject to a curfew.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=215}} In the same year the college was granted its charter.\n\n===First World War===\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]], Somerville College together with the [[Examination Schools]] and other Oxford buildings were requisitioned by the [[War Office]] to create the Third Southern General Hospital, a facility for the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] to treat military casualties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/war/military_hospitals/|title=Military Hospitals|publisher=Oxford History|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/history/somerville-hospital-then-and-now/ |title=Somerville Hospital \u2013 Then and Now |access-date=27 August 2018 |publisher=Somerville College}}</ref> For the duration of the war, Somerville students relocated to [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} Because many male students had left Oxford to enlist in the military, Somerville was able to rent [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St Mary Hall Quad]] which they bricked off from the rest of the college to segregate it from Oriel's remaining male students.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=89}} Many students and tutors were involved in work in World War I and some of them went to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[France]].\n\nNotable patients who stayed in Somerville include the war poets [[Robert Graves]], [[Siegfried Sassoon]] and [[R. E. Vern\u00e8de]]. Sassoon arrived on 2 August 1916. Graves and Sassoon were both to reminisce of their time at Somerville Hospital: ''How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford'', Sassoon wrote to Graves in 1917, and called it ''very much like Paradise''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sassoon |first=Siegfried |authorlink=Siegfried Sassoon |date=1945 |title=Siegfried's Journey, 1916-1920 |page=5}}</ref> At Somerville College, Graves met his first love, a nurse and professional pianist called Marjorie.

Somerville remained a women's college until 1992, when its statutes were amended to permit male students and fellows; the first male fellows were appointed in 1993, and the first male students admitted in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher-education-blue-stockings-greet-blue-socks-somerville-college-oxford-is-preparing-to-admit-its-1505082.html |title=Higher Education: Blue stockings greet blue socks: Somerville College Oxford is preparing to admit its first men next year |first=Stephen |last=Pritchard |date=18 November 1993 |newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Somerville became the second-to-last college (after [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]]) to become coeducational.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=573}} A 50 per cent male/female gender balance has been maintained to this day, though without formal quotas.<ref name=laddism>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/15/sexist-laddism-abuse-somerville-college-oxford How we are fighting sexist laddism and abuse at Somerville College, Oxford], Alice Prochaska, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 May 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://public.tableau.com/views/UniversityofOxford-StudentStatistics/CollegeBreakdown?%3Aembed=y&%3Adisplay_count=yes&%3AshowTabs=y&%3AshowVizHome=no#3 |title=Student Statistics - Sex |publisher=University of Oxford |date=2017 |access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=In the 1890s Somerville helped fashion the \"New Woman\"; a century later... the college has set itself the perhaps greater challenge of educating the \"New Man.\" |author=Pauline Adams, ''Somerville for Women'' (1996){{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=363}}}}\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - House.JPG|thumb|right|House seen from the Quad]]\nThe college and its main entrance, the Porters' Lodge, are located at the southern end of [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]], with [[Little Clarendon Street]] to the south, [[Walton Street]] to the west and the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] to the north.

Five buildings are [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed.\n\nA 2017 archaeological evaluation of the site shows that in the medieval period the area now occupied by Somerville lay in fields beyond the boundary of Oxford. There is evidence of 17th-century building and earthworks beneath the site, some of which almost certainly relates to the defensive network placed around the city by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Civil War]].

The building was designed by [[Harry Wilkinson Moore]] and built in two stages. The 1885\u20131887 phase saw the construction of rooms for 18 students with their own dining-room, sitting rooms and vice-principal. This was a deliberate policy aimed at replicating the family environment that the women students had left.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}} This arrangement had the effect of turning House and West into rivals.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}} The second building stage (1888\u20131895) created two sets of tutors' rooms, a further 19 rooms and the West Lodge (now Park Lodge).<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> In 2004 it was renamed Park in honour of [[Daphne Park]], the principal from 1980 to 1989.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}}\n\nToday there are over 60 student and fellows' rooms within the building, as well as a music room and a computer room.

Specially for this opening, ''Demeter'' was written by [[Robert Bridges]] and performed for the first time. Somerville Library was the first purpose-built library in the women's colleges of the university. With some foresight it was designed to contain 60,000 volumes, although the college only possessed 6,000 when it was opened.

A fund was raised as a memorial to [[Agnes Catherine Maitland|Miss Maitland]], the principal of Somerville Hall (College from 1894) from 1889 to 1906, and this money was used to pay for the oak panelling in Hall. The panelling of the south wall was specially designed to frame the portrait of [[Mary Somerville]] by [[John Jackson (painter)|John Jackson]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=19}} The buildings were constructed on the site of an adjoining building gifted to Somerville by E.

In 1935, [[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] reconstructed the archway which connected Maitland Hall and the south wing of Walton House, creating the Reading Room off the main hall and, in 1947, [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] gave a lecture which filled not only both of these rooms, but the staircase and the quadrangle outside.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=22}}\n\nSomerville's dining hall is the only Oxford dining hall where all the portraits show women.

In 1920, three houses (29, 31 and 33) were purchased by the college from the vicar of [[St Giles' Church, Oxford]], for the sum of \u00a31,300. The three properties were constructed in 1859 and had been rented by the college prior to their purchase. The adjoining ''Waggon and Horses'' pub was purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]], in 1923. These buildings were demolished between 1932 and 1933 together with the old Gate House.\n\n[[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] was commissioned to build a quadrangle which would fill the space left by the demolished structures, using a loan of \u00a312,000 from [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. The porters' lodge and New Council Room were constructed at the entrance to the quad, which housed undergraduates and fellows.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> The coat of arms of Somerville and those of co-founder [[John Percival (bishop)|John Percival]], first principal [[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] and Helen Darbishire were carved by [https://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/person.php?id=msib2_1208276253/ Edmund Ware] inside the quadrangle. The archway leading to Hall was reconstructed in 1938.\n\nOriginally this was called the East Quadrangle. It was opened in June 1934 by [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], who called it \"a notable addition to buildings of varying styles\" (''varii generis aedificiia additamentum nobile'') in the [[Creweian Oration]] during the [[Encaenia]]. Darbishire was renamed in 1962 in honour of the principal of the college during its construction, [[Helen Darbishire]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=26}}\n\nToday Darbishire contains some 50 student rooms, along with tutors' offices, the college archive and a medical room.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The offices of the [[Global Ocean Commission]], co-chaired by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres]], [[Trevor Manuel]] and [[David Miliband]], were situated in Darbishire as part of a partnership with Somerville from 2012 to 2016, when the organisation completed its work.\n\nDarbishire Quad is described on the opening page of ''[[Gaudy Night]]'' by alumna [[Dorothy L.

Constructed in the same architectural style, with an exterior concrete frame standing away from the walls of the interior edifice, the two buildings sit atop a podium containing shops and an arcaded walkway in Little Clarendon Street.\n\nVaughan is the larger of the two, with eleven rows to its concrete frame compared to the eight of Margery Fry.<ref name=\"manchesterhistory.net\">{{cite web |url=http://manchesterhistory.net/architecture/1960/somerville.html |title=Somerville College 1960s, Oxford, UK |website=manchesterhistory.net}}</ref> It is a Grade II-listed building and contains around 60 undergraduate rooms, which are smaller than those of Margery Fry and house exclusively first-year students, along with the junior deans.<ref name=thetab>{{cite web |url=https://thetab.com/uk/oxford/2016/01/19/somerville-first-choice-25551 |last=Haberfield |first=Catrin |title=Somerville should have been your first choice |publisher=[[The Tab]] |date=2015}}</ref> Vaughan was refurbished in 2013, with new bathroom facilities, including, for the first time, sinks.

Completed in 2011, the ROQ buildings were the first new buildings in the university's [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] and have won four awards for their architect Niall McLaughlin. The project was also awarded Oxford City Council's David Steel Sustainable Building Award, being commended for its balancing of Somerville's collegiate heritage with the need for energy efficiency. Energy-efficiency measures include renewable technologies such as solar thermal energy and ground source heat pumps.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/news/roq-accommodation-wins-sustainable-building-award/ |title=ROQ awards |accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe buildings house 68 students, all in en-suite rooms, and there are a number of rooms and facilities designed to help those with disabilities, including lifts and adjoining carer rooms. The buildings were made possible by donations of over \u00a32.7 million from over 1,000 alumni and friends of the college, and by a significant loan.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> There is now an unimpeded view of the [[Radcliffe Observatory]].\n\n===The Terrace===\nBefore the Catherine Hughes Building, the most recent work in Somerville was the Terrace in 2013, a caf\u00e9 and bar attached to the Vaughan building (replacing the old bar in House). It is housed in a mainly glass structure, with seating in the college colours of red and black. Mainly used by members of the JCR, the Terrace has the usual pool table and bar facilities and also serves the college drink, \"Stone-cold Jane Austen\", which consists of blue [[alcopop|VK]], [[Southern Comfort]], and [[Magners]] cider,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cherwell.org/2007/06/01/drink-the-bar-dry-worcester-st-hughs-sommerville/ |title=Drink the bar dry: Worcester, St Hugh's, Sommerville |author=Cherwell |date=June 1, 2007|author-link=Cherwell (newspaper) }}</ref> as well as the \"Somerville Sunset\" and the \"College Triple\".\n\n===Catherine Hughes Building===\nNamed after Somerville's late principal from 1989 to 1996, the [[Catherine Hughes (civil servant)|Catherine Hughes]] Building was completed in October 2019 and provides 68 additional bedrooms. The new building, designed by [[Niall McLaughlin Architects]], includes en suite bathrooms, kitchens and accessible rooms on every floor and a new communal study area for graduate students.<ref name=hughes />\n\nThe red-brick building has a frontage onto Walton Street and additional access from the college gardens, aligning with key levels on the adjacent Penrose Building. The bedrooms are arranged in clusters with kitchens and circulation spaces forming social focal points.\n\nThe building's construction has given Somerville sufficient accommodation to be one of the three Oxford colleges which can allow all students applying from 2017 to live in college for the entirety of their three or four-year undergraduate degree courses.<ref name=Oxfordwebsite>[https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/colleges/college-listing/somerville-college?wssl=1 Somerville College]</ref><ref name=whychoose />\n\n===Gardens===\n[[File:Park Lawn, Somerville College, Oxford.jpg|thumb|]]\nSomerville is one of the few Oxford colleges where students may walk on the grass.

It was home to a donkey, two cows a pony and a pig.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}} The paddock was soon transformed into tennis courts, where huge tents where erected during World War I. During [[World War II]], large water tanks were dug in the Main Quad and in Darbishire Quad, in case of firebombing, and the lawns were dug up and planted with vegetables.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=35}}\n\nIn the Main Quad there is a cedar planted by [[Harold Macmillan]] in 1976, after an old cedar was victim of a winter storm. Another tree, a ''[[Picea likiangensis]]'', was planted in 2007 on the chapel lawn, providing Somerville with an outdoor Christmas tree.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=35}} The library border of lavender and ''[[Agapanthus]]'' references the [[bluestocking]] reputation of Somerville and the [[tory]] blue ''[[Ceratostigma willmottianum]]'' is planted outside the Margaret Thatcher Centre. [[Beardtongues]], ''[[Begonia]]'' and 1,200 red and black tulips reflect the college's colours.

Some of the more prominent members of the association were [[George Granville Bradley]], Master of [[University College, Oxford|University College]], [[T. H. Green]], a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of [[Balliol College]], and [[Edward Stuart Talbot]], Warden of [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]]. Talbot insisted on a specifically [[Anglican]] institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group (the \"[[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] camp\") founded [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], which opened its doors for students in 1879, the same year as Somerville did.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}\n\nThus, in 1879, a second committee was formed to create a college \"in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations.\"{{efn|Originally LMH only admitted students who were practicing members of the [[Church of England]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}}}{{sfn |Batson |2008 |pp=22-23}} This committee was called the \"[[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] camp\" and had close ties to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=21}}{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} This second committee included [[Sir Arthur Dyke Acland, 13th Baronet|A.

G. Vernon Harcourt]] and [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mary Ward]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} Other people who assisted in the founding were [[Anna Swanwick]], [[Bertha Johnson]] and [[Owen Roberts (educator)|Owen Roberts]].\n\nThis new effort resulted in the founding of ''Somerville Hall'', named after the then recently deceased Scottish mathematician and renowned scientific writer [[Mary Somerville]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}} It was felt that the name would reflect the virtues of liberalism and academic success which the college wished to embody.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=23}} She was admired by the founders of the college as a scholar, as well as for her religious and political views, including her conviction that women should have equality in terms of suffrage and access to education.\n\n[[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] was chosen as the first principal because, although not a well-known academic at the time, her background was felt to reflect the college's political stance.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=24}} Because of its status as both women's college and non-denominational institution, Somerville was widely regarded within Oxford as \"an eccentric and somewhat alarming institution.\"{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=25}}\n\n[[File:Thomas Phillips - Mary Fairfax, Mrs William Somerville, 1780 - 1872.

Somerville appointed its first in-house tutor in 1892 and, by the end of the 1890s, female students were permitted to attend lectures in almost all colleges.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=375; 418}} In 1891 it became the first women's hall to introduce entrance exams and in 1894 the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of college (changing its name to Somerville College),{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=47}} the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, and the first to build [[Somerville College Library|a library]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}} In Oxford legend it soon became known as the \"[[bluestocking]] college\", its excellent examination results refuting the widespread belief that women were incapable of high academic achievement.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}}\n\nIn the 1910s, Somerville became known for its support for the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] campaign.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} In 1920, Oxford University allowed women to matriculate and therefore gain degrees.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=xv}} From the college's inception, all female students had to be chaperoned when in the presence of male students.

Five buildings are [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed.\n\nA 2017 archaeological evaluation of the site shows that in the medieval period the area now occupied by Somerville lay in fields beyond the boundary of Oxford. There is evidence of 17th-century building and earthworks beneath the site, some of which almost certainly relates to the defensive network placed around the city by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Civil War]].

The building was designed by [[Harry Wilkinson Moore]] and built in two stages. The 1885\u20131887 phase saw the construction of rooms for 18 students with their own dining-room, sitting rooms and vice-principal. This was a deliberate policy aimed at replicating the family environment that the women students had left.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}} This arrangement had the effect of turning House and West into rivals.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}} The second building stage (1888\u20131895) created two sets of tutors' rooms, a further 19 rooms and the West Lodge (now Park Lodge).<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> In 2004 it was renamed Park in honour of [[Daphne Park]], the principal from 1980 to 1989.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}}\n\nToday there are over 60 student and fellows' rooms within the building, as well as a music room and a computer room.

Specially for this opening, ''Demeter'' was written by [[Robert Bridges]] and performed for the first time. Somerville Library was the first purpose-built library in the women's colleges of the university. With some foresight it was designed to contain 60,000 volumes, although the college only possessed 6,000 when it was opened.

A. L. Fisher]], the Vice-Chancellor of the University and [[Gilbert Murray]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=22}} Murray, whose translations of Greek drama were performed at Somerville in 1912 and 1946, supported Somerville in many ways, including endowing its first research fellowship. A fund was raised as a memorial to [[Agnes Catherine Maitland|Miss Maitland]], the principal of Somerville Hall (College from 1894) from 1889 to 1906, and this money was used to pay for the oak panelling in Hall. The panelling of the south wall was specially designed to frame the portrait of [[Mary Somerville]] by [[John Jackson (painter)|John Jackson]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=19}} The buildings were constructed on the site of an adjoining building gifted to Somerville by E. J. Forester in 1897 and bought from [[University College, Oxford|University]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] Colleges for \u00a34,000 and \u00a31,400 respectively.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> There was difficulty in the construction of the buildings, which is now thought to have been the result of the outer limit of the Oxford city fortifications running under the site. In 1935, [[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] reconstructed the archway which connected Maitland Hall and the south wing of Walton House, creating the Reading Room off the main hall and, in 1947, [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] gave a lecture which filled not only both of these rooms, but the staircase and the quadrangle outside.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=22}}\n\nSomerville's dining hall is the only Oxford dining hall where all the portraits show women.

In 1920, three houses (29, 31 and 33) were purchased by the college from the vicar of [[St Giles' Church, Oxford]], for the sum of \u00a31,300. The three properties were constructed in 1859 and had been rented by the college prior to their purchase. The adjoining ''Waggon and Horses'' pub was purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]], in 1923. These buildings were demolished between 1932 and 1933 together with the old Gate House.\n\n[[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] was commissioned to build a quadrangle which would fill the space left by the demolished structures, using a loan of \u00a312,000 from [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. The porters' lodge and New Council Room were constructed at the entrance to the quad, which housed undergraduates and fellows.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> The coat of arms of Somerville and those of co-founder [[John Percival (bishop)|John Percival]], first principal [[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] and Helen Darbishire were carved by [https://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/person.php?id=msib2_1208276253/ Edmund Ware] inside the quadrangle. The archway leading to Hall was reconstructed in 1938.\n\nOriginally this was called the East Quadrangle. It was opened in June 1934 by [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], who called it \"a notable addition to buildings of varying styles\" (''varii generis aedificiia additamentum nobile'') in the [[Creweian Oration]] during the [[Encaenia]]. Darbishire was renamed in 1962 in honour of the principal of the college during its construction, [[Helen Darbishire]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=26}}\n\nToday Darbishire contains some 50 student rooms, along with tutors' offices, the college archive and a medical room.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The offices of the [[Global Ocean Commission]], co-chaired by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres]], [[Trevor Manuel]] and [[David Miliband]], were situated in Darbishire as part of a partnership with Somerville from 2012 to 2016, when the organisation completed its work.\n\nDarbishire Quad is described on the opening page of ''[[Gaudy Night]]'' by alumna [[Dorothy L.

publication of the Italian Army's order of battle by the Institute for Disarmament, Development and Peace (Istituto di ricerche per il disarmo, lo sviluppo e la pace (IRDISP) in [[Rome]] (a think thank of the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]]). The published order of battle, down to company level, can be found at the Radical's Radio's website ([https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031533/http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/lesercito-italiano-3-quello-che-i-russi-gia-sanno-e-gli-italiani-non-devono-sapere Link]). The structure was then adapted with information from the Italian Army's website and its units' histories listed there. Additionally the following website was used, which lists every Order of Battle for Italy's armies from 1553 to 1997, [http://xoomer.virgilio.it/ramius//Militaria/L'ESERCITO_DAL_1553_AL_1996.html Link]. Specifically the Order of Battle after the 1986 reform was used, which was then corrected and expanded with the Italian Army's website information.\n\n== Graphic of the Italian Army in 1989 ==\n\n[[File:Italy Army - 1989.png|thumb|center|1200px|Structure of the Italian Army in 1989 (click image to enlarge)]]\n\n== Army General Staff ==\nThe Army General Staff in Rome oversaw all Italian Army units.

The station was founded in 2001 as a Chinese-language broadcaster,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB108190438992282143 |title=Falun Gong Fields Media Weapons |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=14 April 2004}}</ref> but has since expanded its language offerings. The company retains a focus on China in its news broadcasts, and frequently covers topics that are censored in Mainland China. Its mission is to \"promote uncensored information on China; to restore and promote traditional Chinese culture; and to facilitate mutual understanding between the East and West\".<ref>https://ntdtv.org/en/aboutus.html</ref>\n\n==History==\nNTD was founded in 2001 by [[Falun Gong]] practitioners, with its mission being to offer \"uncensored news\" about China that [[state-controlled media]] would not cover. The station has a regular focus on the promotion of traditional [[Chinese culture]], and devotes extensive news coverage to alleged [[Chinese human rights issues]]. It takes a critical stance on what it considers to be abuses of power by the [[Communist Party of China]].<ref>[http://english.ntdtv.com NTD]</ref>\n\nSince its founding, NTD has expanded to include English, Spanish, [[Japanese language|Japanese]], French, Russian, [[Persian language|Farsi]], [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew]] and several other language editions. Its content offerings include news and analysis, arts and culture, travel, entertainment news, health and lifestyle, and children's programming.<ref>[http://english.ntdtv.com NTD]</ref>\n\nThe station's critical reporting on the [[Communist Party of China]] has prompted censorship by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]]. NTD also alleged that the Chinese government interfered with their reporting and business operations.\n\nNTD began broadcasting via satellite in North America in February 2002.
