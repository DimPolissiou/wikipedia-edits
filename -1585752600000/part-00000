Arthur]]'s term.\n\nArthur's [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] was badly defeated, losing its majority to the opposition [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] after a campaign that focused on the resistance of Republican leaders to reforming the [[Spoils system]] under which government jobs were handed to supporters of winning candidates. After the election, Arthur agreed with the Democrats to pass the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]], establishing a professional civil service.  However, his actions were too late, as the image of the Republican Party as corrupt was already engrained in the minds of voters.  This election also saw the decline of the pro-paper money [[Greenback Party]], and the pick up of several Virginian seats by the [[Readjuster Party]] which promoted [[balanced budget|fiscal responsibility]] and shunned elitism, though the Virginia-based Readjuster Party all but disappeared following this election.\n\n==Election summaries==\nFollowing the [[1880 United States Census|1880 Census]], 32 new seats were [[United States congressional apportionment#Reapportionment|apportioned]].<ref>{{USStat|22|5}}</ref> Three States lost 1 seat each, 13 States had no change in apportionment, 14 States gained 1 seat each, 6 States gained 2 seats, 1 State gained 4 seats, and 1 State gained 5 seats. Several States that gained one or more seats did not redistrict immediately, electing the new members [[general ticket|at-large]], while one state ([[#Maine|Maine]]) which lost a member also delayed redistricting, electing all of its members at-large for this Congress only.\n\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center\"\n|+ \u2193\n\n|- style=\"color:white\"\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:60.31%\" | '''196'''\n| style=\"background:{{Other/meta/color}}; width:3.7%\" | '''12'''\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:36.00%\" | '''117'''\n\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Democratic'''</span>\n| {{efn|Readjusters had 4 seats, Independent Democrats had 3, Greenbacks had 2, Independents had 2, and Independent Republicans had 1.}}\n| <span style=\"color:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Republican'''</span>\n\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n\n|- valign=bottom\n! rowspan=2 | State\n! rowspan=2 | Type\n! colspan=2 | Total<br/>seats\n! colspan=2 {{party shading/Democratic}} | [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n! colspan=2 {{party shading/Republican}} | [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n! colspan=2 | Others\n\n|-\n!

Arthur]]'s term.\n\nArthur's [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] was badly defeated, losing its majority to the opposition [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] after a campaign that focused on the resistance of Republican leaders to reforming the [[Spoils system]] under which government jobs were handed to supporters of winning candidates. After the election, Arthur agreed with the Democrats to pass the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]], establishing a professional civil service.  However, his actions were too late, as the image of the Republican Party as corrupt was already engrained in the minds of voters.  This election also saw the decline of the pro-paper money [[Greenback Party]], and the pick up of several Virginian seats by the [[Readjuster Party]] which promoted [[balanced budget|fiscal responsibility]] and shunned elitism, though the Virginia-based Readjuster Party all but disappeared following this election.\n\n==Election summaries==\nFollowing the [[1880 United States Census|1880 Census]], 32 new seats were [[United States congressional apportionment#Reapportionment|apportioned]].<ref>{{USStat|22|5}}</ref> Three States lost 1 seat each, 13 States had no change in apportionment, 14 States gained 1 seat each, 6 States gained 2 seats, 1 State gained 4 seats, and 1 State gained 5 seats.
