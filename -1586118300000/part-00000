Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath and [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]], although cardiac arrest may be the first clinical presentation. Several varieties are identified, with a different potential to cause [[Cardiac arrest|sudden cardiac death]].\n\n== ''Anatomy and physiology of coronary arteries'' ==\n[[Coronary arteries]] (CAs) are vessels supplying blood and nutrients to the heart muscle ([[Cardiac muscle|myocardium]]).\n\nCAs arise from ostia, openings of the [[aorta]] (the largest artery in the human body) at the upper third or middle third of the [[Aortic sinus|sinuses of Valsalva]] (the first part of the big pipe coming off the main pumping chamber). The CAs wall structure consists of three layers: [[Tunica intima|intima]] or inner layer (possible site of lipid deposits and fibrosis, during life), [[Tunica media|media]] (a smooth muscle layer whose tone is modulated by the nervous system, influencing vessel diameter and resistance) and [[adventitia]] (where nervous endings are located). Normally, the initial portion of CAs lies onto the external surface of the heart (epicardium) where fat deposits tend to form during life.\n\nIn normal anatomy, three essential coronary arteries are identified: [[right coronary artery]] (RCA), [[left anterior descending artery]] (LAD) and [[Circumflex branch of left coronary artery|left circumflex artery]] (LCx). LAD and LCx usually originate from the bifurcation of a common vessel known as [[Left coronary artery|left main]] trunk or left coronary artery (LM or LCA). \u00a0\n\nCoronary arteries are identified according to the myocardial territory they feed:\n\n1) \u00a0 the LAD supplies the anterior interventricular septum and anterior left ventricular free wall;\n\n2) \u00a0 the LCx supplies the posterolateral left ventricular free wall;\n\n3) \u00a0 the RCA supplies the right ventricular free wall;\n\nIn fact, despite a certain degree of variability in coronary artery anatomy among individuals, there is greater consistency in the ''regions'' of the heart that are supplied by the different coronary arteries.\n\nThe [[Posterior interventricular artery|posterior descending artery]] (PDA), providing blood flow to the infero-posterior wall of the heart, originates from the RCA in 70-90% of individuals (\u201cright coronary dominance\u201d), whereas in 10-15% cases it originates from the LCx (\u201cleft coronary dominance\u201d).\n\nCoronary vessels diameter progressively decreases proceeding from their origin to the periphery. Besides the LM, LAD, LCx and RCA, arterial vessels that are large enough to be identified by clinical angiography are called \u201cbranches\u201d, while [[Capillary|capillaries]] represent the smallest peripheral vessels of the coronary tree that lack muscular tissue (and capacity to cause [[spasm]]) and are responsible for oxygen and nutrients exchange within the myocardium.\n\n== ''Normal variants, anomalies and epidemiological data'' ==\nRegarding coronary artery anatomy, a distinction must be provided when assessing abnormalities:\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0''normal'': any morphological feature observed in >1% of an unselected population\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0''normal variant'': an alternative, unusual but benign morphological feature identified in >1% of the same population (e.g. left main is absent in 1-2% of the general population with LAD and LCx originating from separate ostia - \u201cabsent left trunk\u201d variant)\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0''coronary artery anomaly (CAA)'': a morphological feature seen in <1% of that population, capable of causing dysfunction\n\nThe prevalence of coronary artery anomalies is inconsistent across the scientific literature, but they are considered to affect <1% of the general population. Specifically, recent data came from [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] screening of a large population (more than 5000 young children) and provided a precise estimate, suggesting that coronary artery anomalies are present in 0.45% of the US population (approximately 1.300.000 people).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Angelini|first=Paolo|last2=Cheong|first2=Benjamin Y.|last3=Lenge De Rosen|first3=Veronica V.|last4=Lopez|first4=Alberto|last5=Uribe|first5=Carlo|last6=Masso|first6=Anthony H.|last7=Ali|first7=Syed W.|last8=Davis|first8=Barry R.|last9=Muthupillai|first9=Raja|last10=Willerson|first10=James T.|date=August 2018|title=High-Risk Cardiovascular Conditions in Sports-Related Sudden Death: Prevalence in 5,169 Schoolchildren Screened via Cardiac Magnetic Resonance|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.14503/thij-18-6645|journal=Texas Heart Institute Journal|volume=45|issue=4|pages=205\u2013213|doi=10.14503/thij-18-6645|issn=0730-2347}}</ref>\n\n== ''Classification and pathophysiology''==\nCAAs include a wide spectrum of entities with different severity. We can schematically distinguish anomalies at the ostium, such as congenital ostial atresia or stenosis [COSA] or anomalous origin of a coronary artery from the opposite sinus [ACAOS] (examples: right coronary artery anomalous origin from the opposite sinus [R-ACAOS] and left coronary artery origin from the opposite sinus [R-ACAOS]); anomalies at the mid segments (such as [[myocardial bridge]] [MB]); anomalies at the termination (such as coronary arteriovenous fistulas [CVAF]).\n\nAnomalous origin of a coronary artery from the opposite sinus are relevant on a clinical level due to a significant association with sudden cardiac death, if they are accompanied by intramural course. Indeed, the main feature responsible for adverse outcomes is the \u201cintramural\u201d course (sometimes improperly referred to as inter-arterial) characterized by an acute ostial angulation (tangential course), \u201cslit-like\u201d ostium (compressed inside the aortic wall), and a proximal or initial section penetrating into the aortic tunica media (coronary arteries normally take off at a 90 degree angle) with subsequent course reaching the \u201ccorrect\u201d side of the heart. As a consequence, lateral compression of the coronary artery leads to coronary luminal (inside opening) narrowing, with reduced supply of blood and oxygen to the depending myocardial tissue, that is phasic (worse in [[systole]], the phase of cardiac contraction, and tachycardia). Furthermore, the intramural segment of the ectopic artery, located inside the aorta, is typically but variably \u201c[[Hypoplasia|hypoplastic]]\u201d, smaller in circumference than the distal, extramural segments (it is unable to grow properly either before or after birth).\n\n[[Autonomic nervous system|Autonomic]] and/or [[endothelial dysfunction]] may occur and induce spasm and/or [[thrombosis]] at anomalous sites (and critical [[ischemia]]), although intracoronary clotting has been rarely observed. Therefore, [[stenosis]] of an intramural proximal segment, lateral compression and spastic hyperreactivity are the mechanisms that have been linked to clinical manifestation. Coronary narrowing is most likely the main process implied in ACAOS, and it may result in symptoms such as chest pain (\u201c[[Angina|angina pectoris]]\u201d), [[Shortness of breath|dyspnea]] (shortness of breath), palpitations, cardiac [[arrhythmia]]s (heart rhythm disorders), [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (fainting). In most cases, however, coronary artery anomalies are silent for many years and the first clinical manifestation of these pathological entities is sudden cardiac death (e.g. due to malignant arrhythmias such as [[ventricular fibrillation]]) typically after strenuous physical exertion (when arterial compression is more severe, and cardiac work is maximal) such as in young athletes or military recruits. Of note, 19-33% (in different studies) of sudden deaths in young athletes are due to coronary artery anomalies. Clinical manifestations can be found in non-athletic, older individuals and are commonly associated with [[hypertension]] and aortic dilatation with worsening degree of compression.\n\n\u00a0''L-ACAOS-IM'' (intramural) is seen in 0.1% of young children and, among coronary anomalies, it has the highest probability of clinical repercussions, being consistently associated with sudden cardiac death following physical exercise.\n\nSeveral more varieties of L-ACAOS are described:\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0''prepulmonic'' (L-ACAOS-PP): origin of the LCA (or only the LAD) from the right sinus of Valsalva (RSV) with an epicardial course (on the surface of the heart) anterior to the pulmonary outlow tract - this does not usually cause stenosis nor requires intervention (benign anomaly, unless spasm occurs);\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0''subpulmonary, infundibular or intraseptal (''L-ACAOS-SP): the LCA (or only the LAD) originates from the RSV, initially runs inter-arterially (outside the aortic wall) then intramyocardially inside in the ventricular septum and finally epicardially in the anterior interventricular groove - this anomaly is considered benign since it is not associated with significant fixed degree of stenosis (but it could cause spasm);\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0''retroaortic'' (L-ACAOS-RA): origin of the LCA or the only LCx from the RSV or from the RCA, running behind the aortic root and at the central fibrous mitro-aortic septum \u2013 this is considered as a benign anomaly (but it could cause spasm);\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0''retrocardiac'' (L-ACAOS-RC) \u2013 LCA originates from the RCA at the atrioventricular groove - or wrap-around the apex (L-ACAOS-WA) \u2013 generally benign, unless spasm occurs.\n[[File:Coronary artery anomalies.tif|thumb|General scheme to identify possible courses of normal and ectopic coronary origin.

Varieties of R-ACAOS such as prepulmonic, retroaortic and intraseptal can occur and are considered generally benign.\n\nThe most frequent symptomatic coronary anomaly in infants and young children is anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the [[pulmonary artery]] (ALCAPA), which may cause acute [[myocardial infarction]] at neonatal age and requires emergent surgery at the time of diagnosis.<ref>Angelini P, ed. Coronary Artery Anomalies: A Comprehensive Approach. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 1999:27-150.</ref>\n\n''Anomalies at the mid segments'' include [[myocardial bridge]]s, affecting >1% of the clinical population, and characterized by an intramyocardial course of coronary arteries within the muscle fibers. This may lead to systolic compression which is usually mild (coronary blood flow is mostly [[Diastole|diastolic]]). Significant ischemia is rare in isolated myocardial bridges, and if present this is generally due to localized endothelial dysfunction with a tendency to spasm. Most myocardial bridges are benign and do not require any intervention.\n\nCoronary artery [[aneurysm]]s are defined as a > 50% increase of the vessel diameter. Some cases are congenital/idiopathic, but most are secondary to atherosclerosis or [[Kawasaki disease]] (an immuno-inflammatory disease especially targeting coronary vessels wall). Potential complications include localized thrombosis, distal embolization, rupture, or late lipid deposits.\n\n''Coronary arteriovenous fistulas (CVAF'') are anomalies at the termination consisting of an anomalous connection of coronary arteries to coronary veins, veins of the pulmonary or systemic circulations, or to any cardiac cavity. Smaller fistulas are usually benign, and only severe cases can be complicated by aneurysmatic dilatation with potential thrombosis and distal embolization, volume overload or \u201cblood steal\u201d from arterial circulation and subsequent ischemia. Treatment is generally not required.\n\n== ''Diagnosis, screening and treatment'' ==\nThere is not enough clarity and consistency among experts in regard to the subject of coronary artery anomalies, their classification, severity and management. Precise, unequivocal recommendations are still lacking and further investigation is required to properly assess the risk associated with such anomalies and offer treatment based on individual severity. Nonetheless, given their often \u201csilent\u201d nature, effective screening of the population in search of these entities is necessary in order to prevent complications such as sudden cardiac death, especially in athletes and young individuals engaging in strenuous physical activity.\n\nCoronary artery anomalies cannot be identified solely on the basis of [[Electrocardiography|EKG]] and [[Medical history|clinical history]]: carriers are often asymptomatic before cardiac arrest may occur, and when symptoms are present, they are nonspecific, especially in young individuals. Diagnosis of such entities is often made incidentally in patients undergoing imaging tests during routine screening.\n\nThere is an open debate about the cost/efficiency of generalized diagnostic [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] in large populations. Carriers of coronary artery anomalies may receive positive results following stress/imaging tests. However, only in a minority of cases ischemia in the context of coronary artery anomalies is reproducible by stress or imaging testing and is mainly associated with particular conditions such as intense (maximal) exercise, which may lead to confusing results and misdiagnosis by techniques such as treadmill test or nuclear testing.\n\nNonetheless, routine screening of high-risk populations (e.g. individuals participating in competitive sports) should be generally encouraged in clinical practice of sports cardiologists.\n[[File:R-ACAOS-IM.tif|thumb|Cross-sectional computed tomography angiogram of RCA (between aorta and pulmonary artery) at the worst intramural site of compression (right anterior oblique projection). Black arrow = compressed intramural RCA.]]\n[[File:Intravascular ultrasound imaging of coronary artery anomalies.tif|thumb|Intravascular ultrasound imaging of intramural RCA during systole (left) and diastole (right) in a patient with mild symptoms.]]\nVarious imaging tests have a potential to identify coronary artery anomalies. [[Echocardiography]] (ultrasound scanning of the heart) is simple, non-invasive and economical. Its use for CAAs screening is limited because its diagnostic sensitivity is highly dependent on the operator's skills and is significantly lower in larger individuals (>40&nbsp;kg). The diagnostic power of echocardiography is generally poor in most cases after infancy. \u00a0Especially if clinical suspicion for CAAs is high (e.g. syncope following exertion and/or history of aborted sudden cardiac death).\n[[Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging|Cardiac magnetic resonance]] (CMR) is an excellent tool to identify coronary artery anomalies with a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than standard echocardiography. Compared to CMR, [[Coronary CT angiography|coronary computed tomographic angiography]] (CCTA) provides more precise assessment of coronary anatomy, course and degree of [[stenosis]], but its clinical use for screening is strongly limited by its cost, the need for ionizing radiation, intravenous contrast and, in many cases, drugs administration. Assessment of severity of stenosis is best achieved by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging and it should be considered in known carriers of ACAOS-IM or that have symptoms or positive stress test results or are involved in competitive exercises. IVUS consists of cross-sectional imaging of coronary arteries in a [[Cath lab|catheterization laboratory]] by advancing a thin probe inside the vascular lumen, obtaining precise in-vivo information about degree of area stenosis in different arterial segments, providing a solid basis for treatment strategies.\n\n\u00a0 Criteria for intervention in ACAOS-IM are:\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0symptoms of effort-related chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope or aborted sudden cardiac death (Class I, Level of Evidence A/B) and/or high-risk professional lifestyle.\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0positive treadmill stress test, ideally by nuclear technology, in the correct dependent myocardial territory, in the presence of intramural course (Class I, Level of Evidence B)\n\nFor special populations, e.g. athletes, treatment may be indicated with specific advice of medical experts, in the absence of the previously mentioned criteria. Cut-off for stenosis severity requiring intervention is not clear, although narrowing >50% in comparison to the distal normal segment is generally accepted as a marker of severity in L-ACAOS-IM. Decisions on treatment should be guided by the patient's individual characteristics such as age, symptoms, profession and level of engagement in physical activity. Pharmacological treatment and observation may be appropriate in selected, low-risk patients. Importantly, untreated carriers of significant ACAOS should not generally engage in competitive sports or strenuous activities.\n\nTreatment options for ACAOS-IM include both catheter-based procedures ([[percutaneous coronary intervention]] [PCI]) and surgical interventions. PCI consists of stent angioplasty of the proximal, intramural segment by placing a thin metal tube (a stent) in order to keep open the narrowed artery. PCI of R-ACAOS-IM is feasible and quite successful, but further experience is needed in L-ACAOS-IM since few cases have been treated percutaneously, while surgery is the recommended treatment in this subpopulation, at this time. Surgery consists of \u201cunroofing\u201d or denudation of the intramural coronary segment from the aortic wall: this approach is currently the gold standard. [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|Coronary artery bypass grafting]] (CABG) and reimplantation of the ectopic artery are obsolete and not indicated, because of competitive flow in mild resting narrowings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Poynter|first=Jeffrey A.|last2=Williams|first2=William G.|last3=McIntyre|first3=Susan|last4=Brothers|first4=Julie A.|last5=Jacobs|first5=Marshall L.|last6=Overman|first6=David|last7=Bondarenko|first7=Igor|last8=Forbess|first8=Joseph|last9=Jacobs|first9=Marshall L.|last10=Lorber|first10=Richard|last11=Chen|first11=Jonathan|date=January 2014|title=Anomalous Aortic Origin of a Coronary Artery|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2150135113516984|journal=World Journal for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery|volume=5|issue=1|pages=22\u201330|doi=10.1177/2150135113516984|issn=2150-1351}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|   DiseasesDB     = 34206\n|   ICD10          = {{ICD10|Q|24|5|q|20}}\n|   ICD9           = {{ICD9|746.85}}\n|   ICDO           = \n|   OMIM           = \n|   MedlinePlus    = \n|   eMedicineSubj  = med\n|   eMedicineTopic = 445\n|   eMedicine_mult = {{eMedicine2|ped|2506}}\n|   MeshID         = D003330\n}}\n{{Congenital heart defects}}\n\n[[Category:Heart diseases]]\n", "text_old": "'''Coronary artery anomalies''' are variations of the [[coronary circulation]], affecting <1% of the general population.

Varieties of R-ACAOS such as prepulmonic, retroaortic and intraseptal can occur and are considered generally benign.\n\nThe most frequent symptomatic coronary anomaly in infants and young children is anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the [[pulmonary artery]] (ALCAPA), which may cause acute [[myocardial infarction]] at neonatal age and requires emergent surgery at the time of diagnosis.<ref>Angelini P, ed. Coronary Artery Anomalies: A Comprehensive Approach. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 1999:27-150.</ref>\n\n''Anomalies at the mid segments'' include [[myocardial bridge]]s, affecting >1% of the clinical population, and characterized by an intramyocardial course of coronary arteries within the muscle fibers. This may lead to systolic compression which is usually mild (coronary blood flow is mostly [[Diastole|diastolic]]). Significant ischemia is rare in isolated myocardial bridges, and if present this is generally due to localized endothelial dysfunction with a tendency to spasm. Most myocardial bridges are benign and do not require any intervention.\n\nCoronary artery [[aneurysm]]s are defined as a > 50% increase of the vessel diameter. Some cases are congenital/idiopathic, but most are secondary to atherosclerosis or [[Kawasaki disease]] (an immuno-inflammatory disease especially targeting coronary vessels wall). Potential complications include localized thrombosis, distal embolization, rupture, or late lipid deposits.\n\n''Coronary arteriovenous fistulas (CVAF'') are anomalies at the termination consisting of an anomalous connection of coronary arteries to coronary veins, veins of the pulmonary or systemic circulations, or to any cardiac cavity. Smaller fistulas are usually benign, and only severe cases can be complicated by aneurysmatic dilatation with potential thrombosis and distal embolization, volume overload or \u201cblood steal\u201d from arterial circulation and subsequent ischemia. Treatment is generally not required.\n\n== ''Diagnosis, screening and treatment'' ==\nThere is not enough clarity and consistency among experts in regard to the subject of coronary artery anomalies, their classification, severity and management. Precise, unequivocal recommendations are still lacking and further investigation is required to properly assess the risk associated with such anomalies and offer treatment based on individual severity. Nonetheless, given their often \u201csilent\u201d nature, effective screening of the population in search of these entities is necessary in order to prevent complications such as sudden cardiac death, especially in athletes and young individuals engaging in strenuous physical activity.\n\nCoronary artery anomalies cannot be identified solely on the basis of [[Electrocardiography|EKG]] and [[Medical history|clinical history]]: carriers are often asymptomatic before cardiac arrest may occur, and when symptoms are present, they are nonspecific, especially in young individuals. Diagnosis of such entities is often made incidentally in patients undergoing imaging tests during routine screening.\n\nThere is an open debate about the cost/efficiency of generalized diagnostic [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] in large populations. Carriers of coronary artery anomalies may receive positive results following stress/imaging tests. However, only in a minority of cases ischemia in the context of coronary artery anomalies is reproducible by stress or imaging testing and is mainly associated with particular conditions such as intense (maximal) exercise, which may lead to confusing results and misdiagnosis by techniques such as treadmill test or nuclear testing.\n\nNonetheless, routine screening of high-risk populations (e.g. individuals participating in competitive sports) should be generally encouraged in clinical practice of sports cardiologists.\n[[File:R-ACAOS-IM.tif|thumb|Cross-sectional computed tomography angiogram of RCA (between aorta and pulmonary artery) at the worst intramural site of compression (right anterior oblique projection). Black arrow = compressed intramural RCA.]]\n[[File:Intravascular ultrasound imaging of coronary artery anomalies.tif|thumb|Intravascular ultrasound imaging of intramural RCA during systole (left) and diastole (right) in a patient with mild symptoms.]]\nVarious imaging tests have a potential to identify coronary artery anomalies. [[Echocardiography]] (ultrasound scanning of the heart) is simple, non-invasive and economical. Its use for CAAs screening is limited because its diagnostic sensitivity is highly dependent on the operator\u2019s skills and is significantly lower in larger individuals (>40&nbsp;kg). The diagnostic power of echocardiography is generally poor in most cases after infancy. \u00a0Especially if clinical suspicion for CAAs is high (e.g. syncope following exertion and/or history of aborted sudden cardiac death).\n[[Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging|Cardiac magnetic resonance]] (CMR) is an excellent tool to identify coronary artery anomalies with a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than standard echocardiography. Compared to CMR, [[Coronary CT angiography|coronary computed tomographic angiography]] (CCTA) provides more precise assessment of coronary anatomy, course and degree of [[stenosis]], but its clinical use for screening is strongly limited by its cost, the need for ionizing radiation, intravenous contrast and, in many cases, drugs administration. Assessment of severity of stenosis is best achieved by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging and it should be considered in known carriers of ACAOS-IM or that have symptoms or positive stress test results or are involved in competitive exercises. IVUS consists of cross-sectional imaging of coronary arteries in a [[Cath lab|catheterization laboratory]] by advancing a thin probe inside the vascular lumen, obtaining precise in-vivo information about degree of area stenosis in different arterial segments, providing a solid basis for treatment strategies.\n\n\u00a0 Criteria for intervention in ACAOS-IM are:\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0symptoms of effort-related chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope or aborted sudden cardiac death (Class I, Level of Evidence A/B) and/or high-risk professional lifestyle.\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0positive treadmill stress test, ideally by nuclear technology, in the correct dependent myocardial territory, in the presence of intramural course (Class I, Level of Evidence B)\n\nFor special populations, e.g. athletes, treatment may be indicated with specific advice of medical experts, in the absence of the previously mentioned criteria. Cut-off for stenosis severity requiring intervention is not clear, although narrowing >50% in comparison to the distal normal segment is generally accepted as a marker of severity in L-ACAOS-IM. Decisions on treatment should be guided by the patient\u2019s individual characteristics such as age, symptoms, profession and level of engagement in physical activity. Pharmacological treatment and observation may be appropriate in selected, low-risk patients. Importantly, untreated carriers of significant ACAOS should not generally engage in competitive sports or strenuous activities.\n\nTreatment options for ACAOS-IM include both catheter-based procedures ([[percutaneous coronary intervention]] [PCI]) and surgical interventions. PCI consists of stent angioplasty of the proximal, intramural segment by placing a thin metal tube (a stent) in order to keep open the narrowed artery. PCI of R-ACAOS-IM is feasible and quite successful, but further experience is needed in L-ACAOS-IM since few cases have been treated percutaneously, while surgery is the recommended treatment in this subpopulation, at this time. Surgery consists of \u201cunroofing\u201d or denudation of the intramural coronary segment from the aortic wall: this approach is currently the gold standard. [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|Coronary artery bypass grafting]] (CABG) and reimplantation of the ectopic artery are obsolete and not indicated, because of competitive flow in mild resting narrowings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Poynter|first=Jeffrey A.|last2=Williams|first2=William G.|last3=McIntyre|first3=Susan|last4=Brothers|first4=Julie A.|last5=Jacobs|first5=Marshall L.|last6=Overman|first6=David|last7=Bondarenko|first7=Igor|last8=Forbess|first8=Joseph|last9=Jacobs|first9=Marshall L.|last10=Lorber|first10=Richard|last11=Chen|first11=Jonathan|date=January 2014|title=Anomalous Aortic Origin of a Coronary Artery|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2150135113516984|journal=World Journal for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery|volume=5|issue=1|pages=22\u201330|doi=10.1177/2150135113516984|issn=2150-1351}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|   DiseasesDB     = 34206\n|   ICD10          = {{ICD10|Q|24|5|q|20}}\n|   ICD9           = {{ICD9|746.85}}\n|   ICDO           = \n|   OMIM           = \n|   MedlinePlus    = \n|   eMedicineSubj  = med\n|   eMedicineTopic = 445\n|   eMedicine_mult = {{eMedicine2|ped|2506}}\n|   MeshID         = D003330\n}}\n{{Congenital heart defects}}\n\n[[Category:Heart diseases]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e''Diagnosis, screening and treatment'':Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_anomaly"}

who came to France after the annexation of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] by the [[German Empire]] during the [[Franco-Prussian War]].\n\nThe new school was an establishment for secondary education<ref name =\"Le Figaro\"/> based on the model of the [[Jean Sturm Gymnasium]], with the ambition of \"producing a type of man who was cultivated, and combines the virtues of the regional soul with the general qualities of the humanist\".<ref name =\"Le Figaro\"/> The two first headmasters of the school, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rieder (from 1874 to 1891) and [[Th\u00e9odore Beck]] (from 1891 to 1922), were both pastors and former students of the Jean-Sturm Gymnasium.\n\nLater, the school was headed by Henri P\u00e9quignat (1922-1936), Jacques Vallette (1936-1945), Jean Neel (1945-1953), Georges Hacquard (1953-1986), Jean-Pierre Hammel (1986-1988), Ren\u00e9 Fuchs (1988-2001), Pierre de Panafieu (since 2001).\n\nThe school rapidly became one of the testing grounds for public education, known as a \"pilot school\".<ref name=\"Gruner\" /> Non-religious since 1874, mixed in 1908,<ref>The history of the education of women in France meant that mixed education was not generally used in the French education system until the 1960s.</ref> it insisted from its inception on the importance of French (rather than Latin) and foreign languages. It opened a gymnasium and science labs in 1881. Audiovisual methods of teaching were introduced in 1963, with the introduction of CCTV.\n\nRunning from [[kindergarten]] to [[final year]], the \u00c9cole alsacienne is one of the most reputable schools in Paris. Students from the \u00c9cole alsacienne often come from amongst the most privileged sectors of society, due to their selection and admission policies, and its geographic location.<ref name=\"GQ\"/> The establishment offers relatively few integrated places, as many students stay there throughout their school life.<ref name =\"Le Figaro\"/> The school considered opening an establishment in [[Argenteuil (Val-d'Oise)|Argenteuil]],<ref name =\"Le Figaro\"/> but the project never took place, due to lack of public investment.<ref name=\"GQ\"/>\n\n== Teaching ==\n=== General ===\n\nThe school uses active methods of teaching. Therefore, the growth of the child is placed at the heart of the education system, even to the detriment of spaces.<ref name =\"Le Figaro\"/> Teaching of sport, plastic arts, and music is central, including in the creation of a [[classe \u00e0 horaires am\u00e9nag\u00e9s musique]] in the college.\n\nIn order to empower students and their families, the school practices education without punishment or reward.\n\nLanguages take an important role in the education. German is taught in the first years in the school, but Chinese has been taught since 1963. English courses are obligatory from the beginning of [[elementary school]], and leads to intensive language courses in [[college]] and [[lyc\u00e9e]], particularly in the European (specifically English) and Oriental (particularly Chinese) sections.\n\nSince the 2000s, the Ecole alsacienne has offered exchange programs with some partner schools which includes [[St. Paul's School (New Hampshire)]], [[Hotchkiss School]], [[The Dalton School]], [[Lakefield College School]], [[Ashbury College]].<ref>http://archives.ecole-alsacienne.org/presentation-des-echanges.html</ref><ref>https://www.dalton.org/dalton-news?pk=776042</ref>\n=== Cost ===\n\nAs the establishment is a [[private school]], education is paid for 1001 euros per trimester; there are also scholarships. Entrance is selective: in 2014, there were 300 applications for entry to the 6th Form, for 60 places.<ref name=\"GQ\">Colombe Schneck, \u00ab \u00c9cole alsacienne, les liens du rang \u00bb, ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'', September 2015, pages 94-98.</ref>\n\n=== Languages studied ===\n* German (LV1 until 6th form)\n* English (from primary, LV1 until 6th form with a class reserved for bilingual students by level, European section from the 4th year.)\n* Chinese (LV2 until 6th form, LV3 from second, Oriental section from the 4th year)\n* Spanish (LV2 from the 5th year, LV3 from the second)\n* Greek (option from the second)\n* Italian (LV2 from the 5th year)\n* Latin (obligatory from the 5th year, optional from the 4th)\n* Russian (LV3 from the 4th year)\n\n== Lyc\u00e9e ranking ==\n\nIn 2015, the lyc\u00e9e was ranked 12th of 109 at departmental level in terms of teaching quality, and 130th at national level.<ref>[http://www.lexpress.fr/palmares/lycees/0/ecole-alsacienne-paris-06_0753647G.html Classement d\u00e9partemental et national du lyc\u00e9e]</ref> The ranking was based on three criteria: baccalaur\u00e9at results, the proportion of students who obtain their baccalaur\u00e9at having studied at the school for their last two years, and \"added value\" (calculated based on the social origin of students, their age, and their diploma results).<ref>[http://www.lexpress.fr/education/palmares-des-lycees-2015-notre-methodologie_1666795.html M\u00e9thodologie du classement national des

2020.<ref>http://www.linternaute.com/ville/lycee/lycee-l-ecole-alsacienne/etablissement-0753647G</ref>\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe school is found at 109, [[rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs]] in [[Paris]], in the [[6th arrondissement of Paris]] (between the Petit Coll\u00e8ge and the Premi\u00e8res/Terminales at 128, [[rue d\u2019Assas]]), not far from the [[abbaye de Port-Royal de Paris|Port-Royal]] and the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]].\n\n== Alumni ==\n\nAs well as those students of the \u00c9cole alsacienne who are known in the cultural, media, political spheres, children of the [[CAC 40]] [[CEO]], the

The process involves combining coronary [[angioplasty]] with stenting, which is the insertion of a permanent wire-meshed tube that is either drug eluting (DES) or composed of bare metal (BMS). The stent delivery balloon from the angioplasty catheter is inflated with media to force contact between the struts of the stent and the vessel wall (stent apposition), thus widening the blood vessel diameter. After accessing the blood stream through the [[femoral artery|femoral]] or [[radial artery]], the procedure uses [[coronary catheterization]] to visualise the blood vessels on X-ray imaging. After this, an [[interventional cardiology|interventional cardiologist]] can perform  a [[angioplasty|coronary angioplasty]], using a [[balloon catheter]] in which a deflated balloon is advanced into the obstructed artery and inflated to relieve the narrowing; certain devices such as [[Coronary stent|stents]] can be deployed to keep the blood vessel open. Various other procedures can also be performed.\n\n'''Primary PCI''' is the urgent use of PCI in people with acute [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], especially where there is evidence of heart damage on the [[electrocardiogram]]. PCI is also used in people after other forms of myocardial infarction or [[unstable angina]] where there is a high risk of further events. Finally, PCI may be used in people with stable [[angina|angina pectoris]], particularly if the symptoms are difficult to control with medication. PCI is an alternative to [[coronary artery bypass grafting]] (CABG, often referred to as \"bypass surgery\"), which bypasses stenotic arteries by grafting vessels from elsewhere in the body. Under certain circumstances (extensive blockages, background of diabetes), CABG may be superior.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Head|first1=SJ|last2=Milojevic|first2=M|last3=Daemen|first3=J|last4=Ahn|first4=JM|last5=Boersma|first5=E|last6=Christiansen|first6=EH|last7=Domanski|first7=MJ|last8=Farkouh|first8=ME|last9=Flather|first9=M|last10=Fuster|first10=V|last11=Hlatky|first11=MA|last12=Holm|first12=NR|last13=Hueb|first13=WA|last14=Kamalesh|first14=M|last15=Kim|first15=YH|last16=M\u00e4kikallio|first16=T|last17=Mohr|first17=FW|last18=Papageorgiou|first18=G|last19=Park|first19=SJ|last20=Rodriguez|first20=AE|last21=Sabik JF|first21=3rd|last22=Stables|first22=RH|last23=Stone|first23=GW|last24=Serruys|first24=PW|last25=Kappetein|first25=AP|title=Mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting versus percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting for coronary artery disease: a pooled analysis of individual patient data.|journal=Lancet|date=10 March 2018|volume=391|issue=10124|pages=939\u2013948|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(18)30423-9|pmid=29478841|url=https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/66412/1/Accepted_manuscript.pdf}}</ref>\n\nCoronary angioplasty was first introduced in 1977 by [[Andreas Gruentzig]] in Switzerland.\n\n==Medical uses==\n[[File:HWI PTCA.jpg|thumb|Coronary angiography and angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction (left: RCA closed, right: RCA successfully dilated)]]\n[[File:Wellens' Warning.gif|thumb|300px|Tight, critical stenosis (95%) of the proximal LAD in a patient with [[Wellens' syndrome|Wellens' warning]]]]\n\nPCI is used primarily to open a blocked coronary artery and restore arterial blood flow to heart tissue, without requiring open-heart surgery. In patients with a restricted or blocked coronary artery, PCI may be the best option to re-establish blood flow as well as prevent angina (chest pain), myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) and death. Today, PCI usually includes the insertion of stents, such as bare-metal stents, drug-eluting stents, and fully resorbable vascular scaffolds (or naturally dissolving stents). The use of stents has been shown to be important during the first three months after PCI; after that the artery can remain open on its own.<ref name=oberhauser2009 /> This is the premise for developing bioresorbable stents that naturally dissolve after they are no longer needed.\n\nThe appropriateness of PCI use depends on many factors. PCI may be appropriate for patients with stable coronary artery disease if they meet certain criteria, such as having any coronary stenosis greater than 50 percent or having angina symptoms that are unresponsive to medical therapy.<ref>{{Citation| title=EFC Guidelines 2014 |url=http://www.sbccv.org.br/medica/imagebank/2014-ESC-EACTS-Guidelines-on-Myocardial-Revascularization.pdf}}</ref> Although PCI may not provide any greater help in preventing death or myocardial infarction over oral medication for patients with stable coronary artery disease, it likely provides better relief of angina.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Pursnani S, Korley F, Gopaul R |year=2012 |title=Percutaneous coronary intervention versus optimal medical therapy in stable coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials |journal=Circ Cardiovasc Interv |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=476\u2013490 |doi=10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.112.970954 |pmid=22872053 |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Fihn S, Gardin J, Abrams J |year=2012 | title=2012 ACCF/AHA/ACP/AATS/PCNA/SCAI/STS guideline for the diagnosis and management of patients with stable ischemic heart disease: executive summary: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines, and the American College of Physicians, American Association for Thoracic Surgery, Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, and Society of Thoracic Surgeons |journal=J Am Coll Cardiol |volume=60 |issue=24 |pages=2564\u20132603 |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2012.07.012 |pmid=23182124 |url=http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1391403 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nIn patients with acute coronary syndromes, PCI may be appropriate; guidelines and best practices are constantly evolving.

While balloon angioplasty is still done as a part of nearly all percutaneous coronary interventions, it is rarely the only procedure performed.\n\nOther procedures done during a percutaneous coronary intervention include:\n* Implantation of [[Coronary stent|stent]]s\n* Rotational or laser [[atherectomy]]\n* [[Brachytherapy]] (use of radioactive source to inhibit [[restenosis]])\n\nThe angioplasty procedure usually consists of most of the following steps and is performed by a team made up of physicians, [[physician assistants]], nurse practitioners, [[nurses]], [[radiographers]], and [[interventional radiology#Vascular|endovascular]] specialists; all of whom have extensive and specialized training in these types of procedures.\n\n#The [[femoral artery]] in the leg or the [[radial artery]] in the arm is punctured with a needle and a small wire is passed into the artery. This procedure is often termed [[percutaneous]] access.\n#Once access into the artery is gained, a \"sheath introducer\" is placed over the wire into the artery to allow catheters to be advanced into the artery and to control bleeding.\n#Through this sheath, a long, flexible, soft plastic tube called a \"guiding catheter\" is pushed. The tip of the guiding catheter is placed at the mouth of the coronary artery. The guiding catheter allows for radio-opaque dyes (usually iodine-based) to be injected into the coronary artery, so that the disease state and location can be readily assessed using real time X-ray visualization.\n#During the X-ray visualization, the cardiologist estimates the size of the coronary artery and selects the type of balloon catheter and coronary guidewire that will be used during the case. [[Heparin]] (a \"blood thinner\" or medicine used to prevent the formation of clots) is given to maintain blood flow. [[Bivalirudin]] when used instead of heparin has a higher rate of myocardial infarction but lower rates of bleeding.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cavender|first1=MA|last2=Sabatine|first2=MS|title=Bivalirudin versus heparin in patients planned for percutaneous coronary intervention: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.|journal=Lancet|date=Aug 16, 2014|volume=384|issue=9943|pages=599\u2013606|pmid=25131979|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61216-2}}</ref>\n#The coronary guidewire, which is an extremely thin wire with a radio-opaque flexible tip, is inserted through the guiding catheter and into the coronary artery. While visualizing again by real-time X-ray imaging, the cardiologist guides the wire through the coronary artery to the site of the stenosis or blockage. The tip of the wire is then passed across the blockage. The cardiologist controls the movement and direction of the guidewire by gently manipulating the end that sits outside the patient through twisting of the guidewire.\n#While the guidewire is in place, it now acts as the pathway to the stenosis. The tip of the angioplasty or balloon catheter is hollow and is then inserted at the back of the guidewire\u2014thus the guidewire is now inside of the angioplasty catheter. The angioplasty catheter is gently pushed forward, until the deflated balloon is inside of the blockage.\n#The balloon is then inflated, and it compresses the [[atheromatous plaque]] and stretches the artery wall to expand.\n#If a stent was on the balloon, then it will be implanted (left behind) to support the new stretched open position of the artery from the inside.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heartsite.com/html/ptca.html|title=Angioplasty|first=Dr. Abdulla M..|last=Abdulla|date=|website=www.heartsite.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Types of stent===\n[[File:Blausen 0034 Angioplasty Stent 01.png|thumb|A [[coronary stent]] placed by percutaneous coronary intervention.]]\nTraditional bare-metal stents (BMS) provide a mechanical framework that holds the artery wall open, preventing stenosis, or narrowing, of coronary arteries.\n\nNewer drug-eluting stents (DES) are traditional stents with a polymer coating containing drugs that prevent cell proliferation. The antiproliferative drugs are released slowly over time to help prevent tissue growth \u2014 which may come in response to the stent \u2014 that can block the artery. These types of stents have been shown to help prevent restenosis of the artery through physiological mechanisms that rely upon the suppression of tissue growth at the stent site and local modulation of the body's inflammatory and immune responses. The first two drug-eluting stents to be utilized were the [[paclitaxel]]-eluting stent and the [[sirolimus]]-eluting stent, both of which have received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Most current FDA-approved drug-eluting stents use sirolimus (also known as rapamycin), [[everolimus]] and [[zotarolimus]].

The process involves combining coronary [[angioplasty]] with stenting, which is the insertion of a permanent wire-meshed tube that is either drug eluting (DES) or composed of bare metal (BMS). The stent delivery balloon from the angioplasty catheter is inflated with media to force contact between the struts of the stent and the vessel wall (stent apposition), thus widening the blood vessel diameter. After accessing the blood stream through the [[femoral artery|femoral]] or [[radial artery]], the procedure uses [[coronary catheterization]] to visualise the blood vessels on X-ray imaging. After this, an [[interventional cardiology|interventional cardiologist]] can perform  a [[angioplasty|coronary angioplasty]], using a [[balloon catheter]] in which a deflated balloon is advanced into the obstructed artery and inflated to relieve the narrowing; certain devices such as [[Coronary stent|stents]] can be deployed to keep the blood vessel open. Various other procedures can also be performed.\n\n'''Primary PCI''' is the urgent use of PCI in people with acute [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], especially where there is evidence of heart damage on the [[electrocardiogram]]. PCI is also used in people after other forms of myocardial infarction or [[unstable angina]] where there is a high risk of further events. Finally, PCI may be used in people with stable [[angina|angina pectoris]], particularly if the symptoms are difficult to control with medication. PCI is an alternative to [[coronary artery bypass grafting]] (CABG, often referred to as \"bypass surgery\"), which bypasses stenotic arteries by grafting vessels from elsewhere in the body. Under certain circumstances (extensive blockages, background of diabetes), CABG may be superior.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Head|first1=SJ|last2=Milojevic|first2=M|last3=Daemen|first3=J|last4=Ahn|first4=JM|last5=Boersma|first5=E|last6=Christiansen|first6=EH|last7=Domanski|first7=MJ|last8=Farkouh|first8=ME|last9=Flather|first9=M|last10=Fuster|first10=V|last11=Hlatky|first11=MA|last12=Holm|first12=NR|last13=Hueb|first13=WA|last14=Kamalesh|first14=M|last15=Kim|first15=YH|last16=M\u00e4kikallio|first16=T|last17=Mohr|first17=FW|last18=Papageorgiou|first18=G|last19=Park|first19=SJ|last20=Rodriguez|first20=AE|last21=Sabik JF|first21=3rd|last22=Stables|first22=RH|last23=Stone|first23=GW|last24=Serruys|first24=PW|last25=Kappetein|first25=AP|title=Mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting versus percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting for coronary artery disease: a pooled analysis of individual patient data.|journal=Lancet|date=10 March 2018|volume=391|issue=10124|pages=939\u2013948|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(18)30423-9|pmid=29478841|url=https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/66412/1/Accepted_manuscript.pdf}}</ref>\n\nCoronary angioplasty was first introduced in 1977 by [[Andreas Gruentzig]] in Switzerland.\n\n==Medical uses==\n[[File:HWI PTCA.jpg|thumb|Coronary angiography and angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction (left: RCA closed, right: RCA successfully dilated)]]\n[[File:Wellens' Warning.gif|thumb|300px|Tight, critical stenosis (95%) of the proximal LAD in a patient with [[Wellens' syndrome|Wellens' warning]]]]\n\nPCI is used primarily to open a blocked coronary artery and restore arterial blood flow to heart tissue, without requiring open-heart surgery. In patients with a restricted or blocked coronary artery, PCI may be the best option to re-establish blood flow as well as prevent angina (chest pain), myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) and death. Today, PCI usually includes the insertion of stents, such as bare-metal stents, drug-eluting stents, and fully resorbable vascular scaffolds (or naturally dissolving stents). The use of stents has been shown to be important during the first three months after PCI; after that the artery can remain open on its own.<ref name=oberhauser2009 /> This is the premise for developing bioresorbable stents that naturally dissolve after they are no longer needed.\n\nThe appropriateness of PCI use depends on many factors. PCI may be appropriate for patients with stable coronary artery disease if they meet certain criteria, such as having any coronary stenosis greater than 50 percent or having angina symptoms that are unresponsive to medical therapy.<ref>{{Citation| title=EFC Guidelines 2014 |url=http://www.sbccv.org.br/medica/imagebank/2014-ESC-EACTS-Guidelines-on-Myocardial-Revascularization.pdf}}</ref> Although PCI may not provide any greater help in preventing death or myocardial infarction over oral medication for patients with stable coronary artery disease, it likely provides better relief of angina.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Pursnani S, Korley F, Gopaul R |year=2012 |title=Percutaneous coronary intervention versus optimal medical therapy in stable coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials |journal=Circ Cardiovasc Interv |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=476\u2013490 |doi=10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.112.970954 |pmid=22872053 |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Fihn S, Gardin J, Abrams J |year=2012 | title=2012 ACCF/AHA/ACP/AATS/PCNA/SCAI/STS guideline for the diagnosis and management of patients with stable ischemic heart disease: executive summary: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines, and the American College of Physicians, American Association for Thoracic Surgery, Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, and Society of Thoracic Surgeons |journal=J Am Coll Cardiol |volume=60 |issue=24 |pages=2564\u20132603 |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2012.07.012 |pmid=23182124 |url=http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1391403 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nIn patients with acute coronary syndromes, PCI may be appropriate; guidelines and best practices are constantly evolving.

The guiding catheter allows for radio-opaque dyes (usually iodine-based) to be injected into the coronary artery, so that the disease state and location can be readily assessed using real time X-ray visualization.\n#During the X-ray visualization, the cardiologist estimates the size of the coronary artery and selects the type of balloon catheter and coronary guidewire that will be used during the case. [[Heparin]] (a \"blood thinner\" or medicine used to prevent the formation of clots) is given to maintain blood flow. [[Bivalirudin]] when used instead of heparin has a higher rate of myocardial infarction but lower rates of bleeding.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cavender|first1=MA|last2=Sabatine|first2=MS|title=Bivalirudin versus heparin in patients planned for percutaneous coronary intervention: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.|journal=Lancet|date=Aug 16, 2014|volume=384|issue=9943|pages=599\u2013606|pmid=25131979|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61216-2}}</ref>\n#The coronary guidewire, which is an extremely thin wire with a radio-opaque flexible tip, is inserted through the guiding catheter and into the coronary artery. While visualizing again by real-time X-ray imaging, the cardiologist guides the wire through the coronary artery to the site of the stenosis or blockage. The tip of the wire is then passed across the blockage. The cardiologist controls the movement and direction of the guidewire by gently manipulating the end that sits outside the patient through twisting of the guidewire.\n#While the guidewire is in place, it now acts as the pathway to the stenosis. The tip of the angioplasty or balloon catheter is hollow and is then inserted at the back of the guidewire\u2014thus the guidewire is now inside of the angioplasty catheter. The angioplasty catheter is gently pushed forward, until the deflated balloon is inside of the blockage.\n#The balloon is then inflated, and it compresses the [[atheromatous plaque]] and stretches the artery wall to expand.\n#If a stent was on the balloon, then it will be implanted (left behind) to support the new stretched open position of the artery from the inside.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heartsite.com/html/ptca.html|title=Angioplasty|first=Dr. Abdulla M..|last=Abdulla|date=|website=www.heartsite.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Types of stent===\n[[File:Blausen 0034 Angioplasty Stent 01.png|thumb|A [[coronary stent]] placed by percutaneous coronary intervention.]]\nTraditional bare-metal stents (BMS) provide a mechanical framework that holds the artery wall open, preventing stenosis, or narrowing, of coronary arteries.\n\nNewer drug-eluting stents (DES) are traditional stents with a polymer coating containing drugs that prevent cell proliferation. The antiproliferative drugs are released slowly over time to help prevent tissue growth \u2014 which may come in response to the stent \u2014 that can block the artery. These types of stents have been shown to help prevent restenosis of the artery through physiological mechanisms that rely upon the suppression of tissue growth at the stent site and local modulation of the body\u2019s inflammatory and immune responses. The first two drug-eluting stents to be utilized were the [[paclitaxel]]-eluting stent and the [[sirolimus]]-eluting stent, both of which have received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Most current FDA-approved drug-eluting stents use sirolimus (also known as rapamycin), [[everolimus]] and [[zotarolimus]].

The novel presented a number of particular difficulties in translation, not the least of which is that there are ten or so pages written in a made-up language that is a mixture of Latin, medieval Italian and other languages (intended to reconstruct how a barely-literate Italian peasant boy of the 12th century would have tried to write in the vernacular).\n\n[[Saint Baudolino]], a historically attested hermit of the eighth century, is the Patron Saint of Alessandria, and thus it would be natural for a boy born there to bear his name. \n\n==Plot summary==\nIn the year of 1204, Baudolino of [[Alessandria]] enters [[Constantinople]], unaware of the [[Fourth Crusade]] that has thrown the city into chaos. In the confusion, he meets [[Niketas Choniates]] and saves his life. Niketas is amazed by his language genius, speaking many languages he has never heard, and on the question: if he is not part of the crusade, who is he? Baudolino begins to recount his life story to Niketas.\n\nHis story begins in 1155, when Baudolino \u2013 a highly talented Italian peasant boy \u2013 is sold to and adopted by the emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]]. At court and on the battlefield, he is educated in reading and writing [[Latin]] and learns about the power struggles and battles of northern [[Italy]] at the time. He is sent to [[Paris]] to become a scholar.\n\nIn Paris, he gains friends (such as the [[Archpoet]], Abdul, [[Robert de Boron]] and [[Kyot]], the purported source of [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s ''[[Parzival]]'') and learns about the legendary kingdom of [[Prester John]]. From this event onward, Baudolino dreams of reaching this fabled land.\n\nThe earlier parts of the story follow the general historical and geographical outlines of 12th-century Europe, with special emphasis on the Emperor Frederick's futile efforts to subdue the increasingly independent and assertive city states of Northern Italy. Baudolino, being both a beloved adopted son to the Emperor and a loyal native of the newly founded and highly rebellious town of [[Alessandria]], plays a key role in effecting reconciliation between the Emperor and the Alessandria townspeople, who are led by Baudolino's biological father; a way is found for the Emperor to recognize Alessandria's independence without losing face. (It is no accident that Alessandria is Umberto Eco's own hometown.) During the siege, Baudolino works on the side of Frederick Barbarossa, but concocts a plan to help win the Alessandrian townspeople some independence. He attempts to convince the emperor's forces that Alessandria is more prepared for a siege than them through stuffing a cow with the last of Alessandria's wheat and sends the cow out to the Emperor's forces. When the cow is cut open, it reveals a full belly of wheat. The emperor's forces are convinced that Alessandria is not worth besieging, and thus leave.\n\nThe  incident of the death of Emperor Frederick, while on the [[Third Crusade]], is a key element of the plot. This part involves an element of [[secret history]] \u2013 the book asserts that Emperor Frederick had not drowned in a river, as history records, but died mysteriously at night while hosted at the castle of a sinister Armenian noble. This part also constitutes a [[Historical mystery|historical detective mystery]] \u2013 specifically, a historical [[locked room mystery]] \u2013 with various suspects suggested, each of whom had a clever means of killing the Emperor, and with Baudolino acting as the detective.\n\nAfter the Emperor's death, Baudolino and his friends set off on a long journey, encompassing 15 years, to find the Kingdom of Prester John. From the moment when they depart eastwards, the book becomes pure fantasy \u2013 the lands which the band travels bearing no resemblance to the continent of Asia at that or any other historical time, being rather derived from the various myths which Europeans had about Asia \u2013 including the aforementioned Christian myth of the Kingdom of Prester John, as well as the Jewish myth of the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] and the River [[Sambation]], and some earlier accounts provided by [[Herodotos]]. Baudolino meets [[eunuch]]s, [[unicorn]]s, [[Blemmyes (legendary creatures)|Blemmyes]], [[Monopod (creature)|skiapods]] and [[Pygmy (Greek mythology)|pygmies]]. At one point, he falls in love with a female [[satyr]]-like creature who recounts to him the full [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] creation myth; [[Gnosticism]] is a pervasive presence in another of Eco's novels, ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]''. Philosophical debates are mixed with comedy, epic adventure and creatures drawn from the strangest medieval bestiaries.\n\nAfter many disastrous adventures, the destruction of Prester John's Kingdom by the [[Hephthalites|White Huns]] followed by a long stint of slavery at the hands of the [[Rashid_ad-Din_Sinan|Old Man of the Mountain]], Baudolino and surviving members of his band of friends return to Constantinople undergoing the agony of the Fourth Crusade \u2013 the book's starting point. The wise and rather cynical Niketas Choniates helps Baudolino to at last discover the truth about how the Emperor Frederick died \u2013 with shattering results for Baudolino and his friends.\n \n===Characters in ''Baudolino''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" width=\"250\"\n| [[Image:Nuremberg chronicles - Strange People - Umbrella Foot (XIIr).jpg|center|125px|Umbrella Foot]]\n| [[Image:Image-Schedel'sche Weltchronik-Devil man.jpg|center|125px|Devil Man]]\n|-\n| [[Image:Nuremberg chronicles - Strange People - Headless (XIIr).jpg|center|125px|Headless]]\n| [[Image:Schedel'sche Weltchronik-Large ears.jpg|center|125px|Large Ears]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Various strange characters figuring in the novel as rendered in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicles]]''.

Women who exhibit this male [[facial hair]] trait have a condition known as [[hirsutism]], or alternately, [[hypertrichosis]]. Hypertrichosis causes people of either sex to develop excess hair over their entire body (including the face), while hirsutism is restricted to females and only causes excessive hair growth on the face. \n\n== Background ==\nA relatively small number of [[woman|women]] are able to grow enough facial hair to have a distinct beard. The condition is called hirsutism. It's usually the result of [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] which causes excess testosterone and an over-sensitivity to testosterone, thus (to a greater or lesser extent) results in male pattern hair growth, among other symptoms. In some cases, female beard growth is the result of a hormonal imbalance (usually [[androgen]] excess), or a rare genetic disorder known as hypertrichosis.<ref name=\"congenitallanuginosa\">{{cite web |url= http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1072987-overview |title= Congenital Hypertrichosis Lanuginosa|last1= Taylor|first1= Sarah K |date= June 18, 2009 |work= Emedicine|publisher= Medscape |accessdate=December 4, 2009}}</ref> In some cases a woman\u2019s ability to grow a beard can be due to hereditary reasons without anything medically being wrong.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Hamlin|first=Kimberly A.|date=2011|title=The \"Case of a Bearded Woman\": Hypertrichosis and the Construction of Gender in the Age of Darwin|journal=American Quarterly|language=en|volume=63|issue=4|pages=955\u2013981|doi=10.1353/aq.2011.0051|issn=1080-6490}}</ref>\n\nThere are numerous references to bearded women throughout the centuries, and Shakespeare also mentioned them in ''[[Macbeth]]'':\n{{quote|\nyou should be Women,<br>\nAnd yet your beards forbid me to interpret,<br>\nThat you are so.\n|138\u201346; 1.3. 37\u201345}}\nHowever, no known productions of ''Macbeth'' included bearded witches.<ref>Shopland, Norena 'A wonder of nature' from Forbidden Lives: LGBT stories from Wales, Seren Books, 2017</ref>\n\nSometimes it is caused by use of [[anabolic steroid]]s.
