{"title_page": "John Thomas Claridge", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=January 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2019}}\n\nSir '''John Thomas Claridge''' (1792\u20131868) was a British barrister who served as [[List of Recorders of Penang, Singapore and Malacca|Recorder]] for the [[Straits Settlements]] in what is now [[Malaysia]] from 1825 to 1829.  Claridge was recalled from his post after a well-publicised bitter quarrel with the East India Company. He was later involved in a public scandal regarding the will for a wealthy estate. \n\n== Early life ==\nJohn Claridge was born in 1792, into a middle-class family in [[Sevenoaks]], [[Kent]] in England.  He was the son of John Fellowes Claridge, a solicitor and partner in a law firm with Francis Austen, a great-uncle of [[Jane Austen]]. His younger brother, [[George Claridge]] (1794\u20131856), a solicitor who practiced in the family firm in Sevenoaks and was a famous amateur [[Cricket|cricketer]] \n\n==Harrow School and Lord Byron==\nClaridge started attending [[Harrow School]] in 1805.  While at Harrow, Claridge became friends with [[Lord Byron]] and his small circle of friends. Although Byron graduated from Harrow in 1805, he continued to visit there regularly, staying with [[Henry Drury (educator)|Henry Drury]] who shared accommodations with Claridge. Over a dozen letters from Claridge to Byron  survive in the [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] Archive and cover a period from 1808 to 1811. The letters strongly hint that Byron exerted a powerful attraction on Claridge, who expresses his love for Byron in unequivocal terms. \n\nClaridge stayed at [[Newstead Abbey|Newstead]] over Easter 1809.  He attended a party in which Byron and his friends [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton|John Hobhouse]], [[Scrope Berdmore Davies]], Charles Skinner Matthews and [[James Wedderburn Webster]] dressed up as monks.  The men drank from a skull and consorted with \"Paphian girls\", played by female servants. Bryon refers to this party in the canto 1 of ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'', stating \"Now Paphian girls were known to sing and smile/And monks might deem their time was come agen\". \n\nAfter returning from Greece in 1811, Byron renewed his friendship with Claridge.  However, after a month of his company, Byron became rapidly bored. Byron wrote in September that year:\n\n{{Quotation|\u2026Jn Claridge is here, improved in person a good deal, & amiable, but not amusing, now here is a good man, a handsome man, an honourable man, a most inoffensive man, a well informed man, and a dull man, & this last damned epithet undoes all the rest; \u2026 my old friend with the soul of honour & the zeal of friendship & a vast variety of insipid virtues, can't keep me or himself awake.<ref name=BLJ>{{cite book|last1=Lord Byron|first1=George Gordon|title=Letter to John Hobhouse, October 1811, Byron's Letters & Journals  \u2018Famous in My Time\u2019: 1810-1812|date=1973|publisher=John Murray, London|pages=103}}</ref>|George Gordon, Lord Byron|Letter to John Hobhouse, October 1811, Byron's Letters & Journals  \u2018Famous in My Time\u2019: 1810-1812}}\n\nIn letters to Hobhouse that fall, Byron execrates Claridge's dullness, fending off a claim of an \"attachment\" to the youth and eventually dismisses him with \"Claridge is gone\".<ref name=\"Byron's Letters and Journals\">{{cite book|title=Letters to Hobhouse, 'Famous in my time'|page= 115 & pp. 124\u2013127}}</ref> Claridge's letters stop and Byron never refers to him again in his  letters or journals.\n\n==Early career==\nClaridge graduated from [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in 1813 and was called to the Bar at the [[Middle Temple]] in 1818. However, there is no evidence of Claridge's work as a barrister.  \n\nIn 1825, the ''[[London Gazette]]'' reported:<blockquote>Windsor Castle, Sept. 30. The King was this day pleased to confer the honour of knighthood on John Thomas Claridge, Esq. of the Middle Temple, Recorder of Prince of Wales' Island.<ref name=\"London Gazette\">{{cite journal|title=The London Gazette|date=8 October 1825}}</ref></blockquote>Claridge was then appointed to the position of recorder, a senior judgeship in the Straits Settlement .  He may have obtained this post due to his friendship with the Duchess of Dorset,  Prime Minister [[Lord Liverpool]]\u2019s stepsister.  The post provided a salary of \u00a34,000 per year with a pension of \u00a3500 a year after five years.  Further promotion seemed a certainty, as three out of four previous Recorders in the region had gained well-paid judgeships in [[India]].\n\nSoon after his appointment as recorder, Claridge married  25-year-old Mary Pinnock Scott, the eldest daughter of Vice-Admiral Scott.  In spring 1827, Claridge, presumably with Lady Claridge, sailed for Prince of Wales\u2019 Island, arriving in [[Penang]] in early August \n\n== Recordership in Penang ==\n\nThe Straits Governor was [[Robert Fullerton]], a Scotsman in his mid fifties who was long-standing employee of the East India Company.  An 1826 Charter gave the Governor and the Residents equal roles with ''\u2018a Recorder appointed in England, who was to be a Barrister of not less than Five Years Standing\u2019''.  \n\nClaridge felt that he ranked over the governor and residents because he was a representative of the British Governmor.  In addition, Claridge wanted to set up a fully separate and funded legal arm of government in Penang that was separate from the East India Company.  However, neither the East India Company or the British Government supported his initiative due to its high cost.  \n\nClaridge's relationship with Fullerton broke down almost immediately. \n\nA 1921 history of the settlement describes the accepted view of the confrontation:<blockquote>\u2026almost immediately there began between him and the Government \u2018those mis<ref name=\"One hundred years of Singapore\">{{cite book|last1=ed. Walter Makepeace, Gilbert E. Brooke and Roland St. J. Braddell|title=One hundred years of Singapore being some account of the capital of the Straits Settlements from its foundation by Sir Stamford Raffles on the 6th February 1819 to the 6th February 1919.|url=https://archive.org/details/onehundredyearso02braduoft|date=1921|publisher=Murray|location=London}}</ref>chievous discussions,\u2019 as the Indian Law Commissioners later termed them, which eventually led to his recall and removal from office</blockquote>Expected to travel from Penang to [[Singapore]] and [[Malacca]] to administer justice, Claridge refused to go.  He blamed Fullerton and the residents for failing to assume their share of judicial work. Claridge also complained about the lack of a \u2018full, efficient and respectable court establishment of clerks, interpreters, etc.\u2019.  In addition, he asked for his staff\u2019s salaries to be raised.  \n\nAnother Claridge demand was [[Steamship|steam ship]] transportation to Singapore and Malacca.  He regarded it as a \u2018direct insult\u2019 when Fullterton refused this request, and \u2018Great irascibility of temper (was) shown on both sides\u2019.<ref name=\"One hundred years of Singapore\" />   Claridge claimed that the President of the Board of Control promised him a steam ship when he was offered the recordership. The East India Company refused to pay for one, calling it a luxury. Claridge in turn refused to fund his transportation costs from his salary or expenses.  \n\nTo break this impasse, Fullerton and the Singapore Resident, Kenneth Murchison, finally held assizes in Singapore themselves in May 1828.  Claridge eventually travelled to Malacca, but by that point the East India Company was petitioning the British government to remove him from office.\n\n== Recall to England ==\nOn 30 September 1828 the First Lord of the Admiralty, [[Robert Dundas, 2nd Viscount Melville|Lord Melville]], wrote to the President of the Board of Control, [[Charles Williams-Wynn (1775\u20131850)|Charles Williams-Wynn]]: the East India Company Court of Directors had asked [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] to remove Claridge from his recordership.  Fullerton was accusing Claridge of \u2018extorting higher salaries for the Officers of his Court than the Government deemed proper, on the threat of refusing to administer justice\u2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=MS. Letter from Melville to Wynne, September 30, 1828, original privately owned, copy on web.}}</ref> An Order in Council letter was signed and sent in February 1829, recalling Claridge to England.\n\nThe letter reached Claridge iin Malacca in August 1829.  Claridge seems to have turned tail immediately and set off for China en route for England.  A [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] newspaper quoted the British Government as saying that Claridge ''\u2018is not, in point of fact, recalled, for no successor is appointed; he is merely directed to return\u2019''.<ref name=\"One hundred years of Singapore\" />   This sentence is key to Claridge\u2019s future: he was never dismissed, but more ambiguously directed to return to England.\n\nBack in England in late 1831, Claridge defended himself against six charges at a hearing of the [[Privy council|Privy Council]].  He was acquitted of all the charges except one.   However, the government would not allow him to return to Penang.\n\n== The case of the \u2018Gloucester Miser\u2019 ==\n\nBy 1835, Claridge was living in Plowden Buildings in the Middle Temple. It is unclear if he was practicing formally as a barrister, but it was at this time that he re-emerges out of the shadows as a player in one of the most notorious legal cases of the era, that of the Gloucester Miser.\n\nJames or more popularly [[Jemmy Wood]] was the proprietor of one of the oldest private banks in the kingdom, probably the first commoner in England to become a millionaire and a noted miser. [[Charles Dickens]] is thought to have modelled [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] on him. The Chancery case following his death and disputed will may form the theme of \u2018Bleak House\u2019. Wood, who lived alone and had no close relatives, died in early 1834 and left an estate valued at \u00a3900,000, (around \u00a340,000,000 today). A will naming Wood\u2019s executors as his beneficiaries was submitted for probate, but then alternative wills appeared and a conspiracy was suspected.  A \u00a31000 reward was offered for information about any earlier will. In 1836, at the height of the will controversy, \u2018Thomas Leighton, Gent\u2019, an attorney from Gloucester working in London, published a fifty-page pamphlet called \u2018Extraordinary facts and circumstances relating to the last will and testament of the late James Wood\u2019.<ref name=\"Leighton\">{{cite book|last1=Leighton|first1=Thomas|title=Extraordinary facts and circumstances relating to the last will and testament  and first codicil of the late James Wood,of Gloucester, Banker, deceased.  Printed and published by the author|date=1837|publisher=Thomas Leighton (self published)|location=London}}</ref>   Leighton had attempted to win the reward and, rebuffed, set out the full and complex case in his pamphlet.\n\nSir John Claridge was a business associate of Leighton\u2019s employer, who advised him to take his case to the barrister. Leighton soon started to feel Claridge himself was part of a conspiracy.  The knight\u2019s behaviour inexplicably changed from rude and dismissive, to civil and agreeable, and back again. Claridge, though only comparatively briefly involved in the case, receives a storm of opprobrium.\n\n''This Sir John Thomas Claridge is a son of an Attorney deceased, who lived at Seven Oaks, in Kent, and who was knighted on being sent out as Recorder of Penang; \u2026 he petitioned the House of Commons, against the appointment of a party proposed by my Lord Glenelg\u2026as he considered himself better entitled.''<ref name=\"Leighton\"/>\n\nClaridge\u2019s troubles, including implicitly his father\u2019s suicide, the Recordership debacle and his Commons petition to regain his post in 1835, were clearly known in legal circles.  Leighton calls him someone capable of \u2018genteel bullying\u2019   and guilty of \u2018dirty conduct\u2019<ref name=\"Leighton\"/>   and even employs poetry by the popular contemporary satirist, Peter Pindar, to characterize Sir John as a sinister eminence cooking \u2018some rare dish of sin\u2019:\n\n''\u2018The devil\u2019s a fellow of such sterling humour/And all so civil in each act and look \u2019''<ref name=\"Leighton\"/>\n\n== Decline and death ==\n\nOn 25 July 1848, Hansard <ref name=\"Hansard\">{{cite journal|title=Case of Sir J T Claridge|journal=Hansard|date=25 July 1848|volume=100|page=812}}</ref>   reports two interesting speakers in a debate on Sir John Claridge\u2019s right to be appointed to another colonial position.  Claridge had spent many years trying to regain his right to a judge\u2019s post and finally to be granted a pension and this was his last petition to Parliament.  The opposing speakers were [[William Gladstone]], Secretary of State for the Colonies in the previous Government, and Sir John Hobhouse.  \u2018Hobby\u2019, Byron\u2019s best friend and flame-bearer and Claridge\u2019s erstwhile fellow guest at Newstead that Easter many years before, was now a member of the Government.  From 1846 to 1852, he was President of the Board of Control, and in this role, played an inexplicably negative part in Claridge\u2019s attempts to gain reparation.\n\nGladstone spoke for the motion, telling the Commons ''\u2018that he had been guilty of no act which should incapacitate him from serving the Crown hereafter in a judicial capacity.\u2019'' <ref name=\"Hansard\"/>   Claridge wished to be appointed now as a judge in India.  Hansard reports a dismissive Hobhouse response:\n\n''The appointment had taken place twenty years ago, and he had nothing to do with it, and had had nothing to do with the matter at all except having been so unfortunate as to have had a long and by no means agreeable correspondence with that gentleman\u2026He had nothing to say against the character of Sir J. T. Claridge, but he would rather not make him a judge\u2026 He wished it was in his power to come to some other conclusion on the subject, and to be able to say that Sir J. T. Claridge was the fittest person to be appointed as judge in India or elsewhere; but he could not give such an answer.''<ref name=\"Hansard\"/>\n\nThe motion was withdrawn.  Why was Hobhouse so openly and cruelly dismissive of his and Byron\u2019s old friend?  Letters to Hobhouse from Sir Frederic Thesiger, ([[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Baron Chelmsford]]) until recently the Attorney General, warmly pleaded his friend Claridge\u2019s case, but they only seemed to rouse Hobhouse\u2019s ire.    Hobhouse, who had once pleaded Claridge\u2019s decency and kindness to a dismissive Byron, (''\u2018he wrote me a very kind letter, kind both to me and to you\u2019''),<ref name=\"Byron's Bulldog\">{{cite book|last1=ed. Graham|first1=Peter|title=Byron's Bulldog|date=1984|publisher=Ohio State University Press|page=83}}</ref> now disowned his former associate in the most public manner possible.\n\nWithout a legal practice or any pension, the Claridge household income declined so far that, in the 1851 census, his wife Mary is recorded as running a \u2018scholastic establishment\u2019 in Sidmouth with two 14-year-old local tradesmen's daughters living in. On 20 June 1868, the Claridges' arrival was reported in the \u2018Leamington Spa Courier\u2019, but he died the very same day.  Claridge\u2019s death certificate states he had died of ''\u2018Apoplexy 10 weeks.  Paralysis right side 3 days\u2019''<ref>{{cite book|title=Copy of Sir John Claridge's death certificate|publisher=HMSO}}</ref> so a stroke is the most likely cause of death.  He was buried at Leamington Priors Parish, All Saints, but there is no sign of his gravestone; it may have vanished due to headstone removals or perhaps Lady Claridge was unable to afford one.  No will was registered and when in 1897 a great nephew applied for probate on the Claridges\u2019 estate, Lady Claridge having died in 1888, it was worth just over \u00a3130.<ref>{{cite book|title=Probate register|date=1897}}</ref>\n\nThere is a Byronic postscript.  In 1857, Claridge,  living from hand to mouth in genteel poverty,  made a gift to his old school of a five volume set of the ''\u2018Arabian Nights\u2019''.  His inscription is roughly written across the frontispiece:\n\n''This copy of the \u2018Arabian Nights\u2019 was given to me when I was at Harrow School, nearly 60 years ago (sic), by George Gordon, Lord Byron, Author of \u2018Childe Harold\u2019''<ref>{{cite book|last1=Claridge|first1=John T|title=Inscription in copy of 'Arabian Nights' (1804 edition)|date=1857|location=Harrow School archive}}</ref>\n\nTenderly, Claridge goes on to recall both his headmaster Butler and master Henry Drury as  ''\u2018friend\u2019'', but there is no such epithet attached to the giver of the gift, the man who had once been ''\u2018my dearest Byron\u2019''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Claridge, John Thomas}}\n[[Category:1792 births]]\n[[Category:1868 deaths]]\n[[Category:People educated at Harrow School]]\n[[Category:English judges]]\n[[Category:English barristers]]\n[[Category:British Malaya lawyers]]\n[[Category:Straits Settlements judges]]\n[[Category:People from Sevenoaks]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=January 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2019}}\n\nSir '''John Thomas Claridge''' (1792\u20131868) was a British barrister who served as [[List of Recorders of Penang, Singapore and Malacca|Recorder]] for the [[Straits Settlements]] in what is now [[Malaysia]] from 1825 to 1829.  Claridge was recalled from his post after a well-publicised bitter quarrel with the East India Company. He was later involved in a public scandal regarding the will for a wealthy estate. \n\n== Early life ==\nJohn Claridge was born in 1792, into a middle-class family in [[Sevenoaks]], [[Kent]] in England.  He was the son of John Fellowes Claridge, a solicitor and partner in a law firm with Francis Austen, a great-uncle of [[Jane Austen]]. His younger brother, [[George Claridge]] (1794\u20131856), a solicitor who practiced in the family firm in Sevenoaks and was a famous amateur [[Cricket|cricketer]] \n\n==Harrow School and Lord Byron==\nClaridge started attending [[Harrow School]] in 1805.  While at Harrow, Claridge became friends with [[Lord Byron]] and his small circle of friends. Although Byron graduated from Harrow in 1805, he continued to visit there regularly, staying with [[Henry Drury (educator)|Henry Drury]] who shared accomodations with Claridge. Over a dozen letters from Claridge to Byron  survive in the [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] Archive and cover a period from 1808 to 1811. The letters strongly hint that Byron exerted a powerful attraction on Claridge, who expresses his love for Byron in unequivocal terms. \n\nClaridge stayed at [[Newstead Abbey|Newstead]] over Easter 1809.  He attended a party in which Byron and his friends [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton|John Hobhouse]], [[Scrope Berdmore Davies]], Charles Skinner Matthews and [[James Wedderburn Webster]] dressed up as monks.  The men drank from a skull and consorted with \"Paphian girls\", played by female servants. Bryon refers to this party in the canto 1 of ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'', stating \"Now Paphian girls were known to sing and smile/And monks might deem their time was come agen\". \n\nAfter returning from Greece in 1811, Byron renewed his friendship with Claridge.  However, after a month of his company, Byron became rapidly bored. Byron wrote in September that year:\n\n{{Quotation|\u2026Jn Claridge is here, improved in person a good deal, & amiable, but not amusing, now here is a good man, a handsome man, an honourable man, a most inoffensive man, a well informed man, and a dull man, & this last damned epithet undoes all the rest; \u2026 my old friend with the soul of honour & the zeal of friendship & a vast variety of insipid virtues, can't keep me or himself awake.<ref name=BLJ>{{cite book|last1=Lord Byron|first1=George Gordon|title=Letter to John Hobhouse, October 1811, Byron's Letters & Journals  \u2018Famous in My Time\u2019: 1810-1812|date=1973|publisher=John Murray, London|pages=103}}</ref>|George Gordon, Lord Byron|Letter to John Hobhouse, October 1811, Byron's Letters & Journals  \u2018Famous in My Time\u2019: 1810-1812}}\n\nIn letters to Hobhouse that fall, Byron execrates Claridge's dullness, fending off a claim of an \"attachment\" to the youth and eventually dismisses him with \"Claridge is gone\".<ref name=\"Byron's Letters and Journals\">{{cite book|title=Letters to Hobhouse, 'Famous in my time'|page= 115 & pp. 124\u2013127}}</ref> Claridge's letters stop and Byron never refers to him again in his  letters or journals.\n\n==Early career==\nClaridge graduated from [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in 1813 and was called to the Bar at the [[Middle Temple]] in 1818. However, there is no evidence of Claridge's work as a barrister.  \n\nIn 1825, the ''[[London Gazette]]'' reported:<blockquote>Windsor Castle, Sept. 30. The King was this day pleased to confer the honour of knighthood on John Thomas Claridge, Esq. of the Middle Temple, Recorder of Prince of Wales' Island.<ref name=\"London Gazette\">{{cite journal|title=The London Gazette|date=8 October 1825}}</ref></blockquote>Claridge was then appointed to the position of recorder, a senior judgeship in the Straits Settlement .  He may have obtained this post due to his friendship with the Duchess of Dorset,  Prime Minister [[Lord Liverpool]]\u2019s stepsister.  The post provided a salary of \u00a34,000 per year with a pension of \u00a3500 a year after five years.  Further promotion seemed a certainty, as three out of four previous Recorders in the region had gained well-paid judgeships in [[India]].\n\nSoon after his appointment as recorder, Claridge married  25-year-old Mary Pinnock Scott, the eldest daughter of Vice-Admiral Scott.  In spring 1827, Claridge, presumably with Lady Claridge, sailed for Prince of Wales\u2019 Island, arriving in [[Penang]] in early August \n\n== Recordership in Penang ==\n\nThe Straits Governor was [[Robert Fullerton]], a Scotsman in his mid fifties who was long-standing employee of the East India Company.  An 1826 Charter gave the Governor and the Residents equal roles with ''\u2018a Recorder appointed in England, who was to be a Barrister of not less than Five Years Standing\u2019''.  \n\nClaridge felt that he ranked over the governor and residents because he was a representative of the British Governmor.  In addition, Claridge wanted to set up a fully separate and funded legal arm of government in Penang that was separate from the East India Company.  However, neither the East India Company or the British Government supported his initiative due to its high cost.  \n\nClaridge's relationship with Fullerton broke down almost immediately. \n\nA 1921 history of the settlement describes the accepted view of the confrontation:<blockquote>\u2026almost immediately there began between him and the Government \u2018those mis<ref name=\"One hundred years of Singapore\">{{cite book|last1=ed. Walter Makepeace, Gilbert E. Brooke and Roland St. J. Braddell|title=One hundred years of Singapore being some account of the capital of the Straits Settlements from its foundation by Sir Stamford Raffles on the 6th February 1819 to the 6th February 1919.|url=https://archive.org/details/onehundredyearso02braduoft|date=1921|publisher=Murray|location=London}}</ref>chievous discussions,\u2019 as the Indian Law Commissioners later termed them, which eventually led to his recall and removal from office</blockquote>Expected to travel from Penang to [[Singapore]] and [[Malacca]] to administer justice, Claridge refused to go.  He blamed Fullerton and the residents for failing to assume their share of judicial work. Claridge also complained about the lack of a \u2018full, efficient and respectable court establishment of clerks, interpreters, etc.\u2019.  In addition, he asked for his staff\u2019s salaries to be raised.  \n\nAnother Claridge demand was [[Steamship|steam ship]] transportation to Singapore and Malacca.  He regarded it as a \u2018direct insult\u2019 when Fullterton refused this request, and \u2018Great irascibility of temper (was) shown on both sides\u2019.<ref name=\"One hundred years of Singapore\" />   Claridge claimed that the President of the Board of Control promised him a steam ship when he was offered the recordership. The East India Company refused to pay for one, calling it a luxury. Claridge in turn refused to fund his transportation costs from his salary or expenses.  \n\nTo break this impasse, Fullerton and the Singapore Resident, Kenneth Murchison, finally held assizes in Singapore themselves in May 1828.  Claridge eventually travelled to Malacca, but by that point the East India Company was petitioning the British government to remove him from office.\n\n== Recall to England ==\nOn 30 September 1828 the First Lord of the Admiralty, [[Robert Dundas, 2nd Viscount Melville|Lord Melville]], wrote to the President of the Board of Control, [[Charles Williams-Wynn (1775\u20131850)|Charles Williams-Wynn]]: the East India Company Court of Directors had asked [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] to remove Claridge from his recordership.  Fullerton was accusing Claridge of \u2018extorting higher salaries for the Officers of his Court than the Government deemed proper, on the threat of refusing to administer justice\u2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=MS. Letter from Melville to Wynne, September 30, 1828, original privately owned, copy on web.}}</ref> An Order in Council letter was signed and sent in February 1829, recalling Claridge to England.\n\nThe letter reached Claridge iin Malacca in August 1829.  Claridge seems to have turned tail immediately and set off for China en route for England.  A [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] newspaper quoted the British Government as saying that Claridge ''\u2018is not, in point of fact, recalled, for no successor is appointed; he is merely directed to return\u2019''.<ref name=\"One hundred years of Singapore\" />   This sentence is key to Claridge\u2019s future: he was never dismissed, but more ambiguously directed to return to England.\n\nBack in England in late 1831, Claridge defended himself against six charges at a hearing of the [[Privy council|Privy Council]].  He was acquitted of all the charges except one.   However, the government would not allow him to return to Penang.\n\n== The case of the \u2018Gloucester Miser\u2019 ==\n\nBy 1835, Claridge was living in Plowden Buildings in the Middle Temple. It is unclear if he was practicing formally as a barrister, but it was at this time that he re-emerges out of the shadows as a player in one of the most notorious legal cases of the era, that of the Gloucester Miser.\n\nJames or more popularly [[Jemmy Wood]] was the proprietor of one of the oldest private banks in the kingdom, probably the first commoner in England to become a millionaire and a noted miser. [[Charles Dickens]] is thought to have modelled [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] on him. The Chancery case following his death and disputed will may form the theme of \u2018Bleak House\u2019. Wood, who lived alone and had no close relatives, died in early 1834 and left an estate valued at \u00a3900,000, (around \u00a340,000,000 today). A will naming Wood\u2019s executors as his beneficiaries was submitted for probate, but then alternative wills appeared and a conspiracy was suspected.  A \u00a31000 reward was offered for information about any earlier will. In 1836, at the height of the will controversy, \u2018Thomas Leighton, Gent\u2019, an attorney from Gloucester working in London, published a fifty-page pamphlet called \u2018Extraordinary facts and circumstances relating to the last will and testament of the late James Wood\u2019.<ref name=\"Leighton\">{{cite book|last1=Leighton|first1=Thomas|title=Extraordinary facts and circumstances relating to the last will and testament  and first codicil of the late James Wood,of Gloucester, Banker, deceased.  Printed and published by the author|date=1837|publisher=Thomas Leighton (self published)|location=London}}</ref>   Leighton had attempted to win the reward and, rebuffed, set out the full and complex case in his pamphlet.\n\nSir John Claridge was a business associate of Leighton\u2019s employer, who advised him to take his case to the barrister. Leighton soon started to feel Claridge himself was part of a conspiracy.  The knight\u2019s behaviour inexplicably changed from rude and dismissive, to civil and agreeable, and back again. Claridge, though only comparatively briefly involved in the case, receives a storm of opprobrium.\n\n''This Sir John Thomas Claridge is a son of an Attorney deceased, who lived at Seven Oaks, in Kent, and who was knighted on being sent out as Recorder of Penang; \u2026 he petitioned the House of Commons, against the appointment of a party proposed by my Lord Glenelg\u2026as he considered himself better entitled.''<ref name=\"Leighton\"/>\n\nClaridge\u2019s troubles, including implicitly his father\u2019s suicide, the Recordership debacle and his Commons petition to regain his post in 1835, were clearly known in legal circles.  Leighton calls him someone capable of \u2018genteel bullying\u2019   and guilty of \u2018dirty conduct\u2019<ref name=\"Leighton\"/>   and even employs poetry by the popular contemporary satirist, Peter Pindar, to characterize Sir John as a sinister eminence cooking \u2018some rare dish of sin\u2019:\n\n''\u2018The devil\u2019s a fellow of such sterling humour/And all so civil in each act and look \u2019''<ref name=\"Leighton\"/>\n\n== Decline and death ==\n\nOn 25 July 1848, Hansard <ref name=\"Hansard\">{{cite journal|title=Case of Sir J T Claridge|journal=Hansard|date=25 July 1848|volume=100|page=812}}</ref>   reports two interesting speakers in a debate on Sir John Claridge\u2019s right to be appointed to another colonial position.  Claridge had spent many years trying to regain his right to a judge\u2019s post and finally to be granted a pension and this was his last petition to Parliament.  The opposing speakers were [[William Gladstone]], Secretary of State for the Colonies in the previous Government, and Sir John Hobhouse.  \u2018Hobby\u2019, Byron\u2019s best friend and flame-bearer and Claridge\u2019s erstwhile fellow guest at Newstead that Easter many years before, was now a member of the Government.

Why was Hobhouse so openly and cruelly dismissive of his and Byron\u2019s old friend?  Letters to Hobhouse from Sir Frederic Thesiger, ([[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Baron Chelmsford]]) until recently the Attorney General, warmly pleaded his friend Claridge\u2019s case, but they only seemed to rouse Hobhouse\u2019s ire.    Hobhouse, who had once pleaded Claridge\u2019s decency and kindness to a dismissive Byron, (''\u2018he wrote me a very kind letter, kind both to me and to you\u2019''),<ref name=\"Byron's Bulldog\">{{cite book|last1=ed.

The name originates about the time of the 1786 land survey. Though the origin or meaning of the name is unknown, one popular story says that Brooke Beall and William Deakins, Jr., friends from Prince George's County, were conducting separate surveys in the area at the time and \"by accident\" Deakins claimed land already surveyed by Beall.<ref name=\"MDManual\"/><ref>\"How did this spot get the name \"[[Accident]]?\"  Mary Strauss in ''Flowery Vale: A History of Accident, Maryland'',(Parson, West Virginia: McClain Printing Col, 1986), p. 1, provides an interesting\nstory of axe marks on a tree, and conflicting claims, {{cite web|url=http://www.whilbr.org/accident/index.aspx|title=A Pictorial History of Accident, Maryland, from the collection of Mary Miller Strauss|publisher=Western Maryland's Historical Society|access-date=2008-03-29|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221222/http://www.whilbr.org/accident/index.aspx|archivedate=2007-09-27}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]] opened up the area, which he called Monocacy Manor, for settlement, in the early 1770s, Brooke Beall secured permission to survey 778 acres (315&nbsp;ha; 1.2 sq mi). It will never be known for certain how Beall came to choose this particular spot, but the surveyor was given clear instructions where to start. He was to begin \"in the center between two bounded white [[oak]] trees, standing on the North Side of the South fork of [[Bear Creek (Maryland)|Bear Creek]]  in or near a glade about one Hundred yards from said Run, about one  or two Miles above a Lick known by the name of the \"[[Cole Mine Lick]]\", about four miles (6 km) above the mouth of [[Broad Creek (Maryland)|Broad Creek]] and about one mile (1.6 km) East of a Ridge of the [[Negro Mountain]].\"  [[John Hanson|John Hanson, Jr.]], later a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]], and President of the United States in Congress Assembled, on April 14, 1774, surveyed the land, finding that it only contained 682 acres (276&nbsp;ha). For the next twelve years, nothing was done with the survey. The [[American Revolutionary War]] intervened, and it was not until February 15, 1786 that the land was granted by means of a patent to [[William Deakins]]. The following year the surrounding countryside was surveyed into military lots by [[Francis Deakins]], lots that were meant as compensation for the soldiers who served from Maryland during the Revolution. Each soldier who served for two years received one lot of 50 acres (20&nbsp;ha), officers received four lots of 50 acres (20&nbsp;ha) each.<ref>Mr. George Deakins was to receive 600 acres of land in Western Maryland as a payment of a debt from King George II of England. Mr. Deakins sent out two corps of engineers, each without knowledge of the other, to survey the best land in this area. Both crews returned and to their surprise, they had both marked the same Oak tree as their starting and returning points. Mr. Deakins chose this plot of ground and had it patented \"The Accident Tract\". Now called, the Town of Accident! Accident was incorporated in 1916.&nbsp;\u2014 Scharf, J. Thomas (1882).

It will never be known for certain how Beall came to choose this particular spot, but the surveyor was given clear instructions where to start. He was to begin \"in the center between two bounded white [[oak]] trees, standing on the North Side of the South fork of [[Bear Creek (Maryland)|Bear Creek]]  in or near a glade about one Hundred yards from said Run, about one  or two Miles above a Lick known by the name of the \"[[Cole Mine Lick]]\", about four miles (6 km) above the mouth of [[Broad Creek (Maryland)|Broad Creek]] and about one mile (1.6 km) East of a Ridge of the [[Negro Mountain]].\"  [[John Hanson|John Hanson, Jr.]], later a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]], and President of the United States in Congress Assembled, on April 14, 1774, surveyed the land, finding that it only contained 682 acres (276&nbsp;ha). For the next twelve years, nothing was done with the survey. The [[American Revolutionary War]] intervened, and it was not until February 15, 1786 that the land was granted by means of a patent to [[William Deakins]]. The following year the surrounding countryside was surveyed into military lots by [[Francis Deakins]], lots that were meant as compensation for the soldiers who served from Maryland during the Revolution. Each soldier who served for two years received one lot of 50 acres (20&nbsp;ha), officers received four lots of 50 acres (20&nbsp;ha) each.<ref>Mr. George Deakins was to receive 600 acres of land in Western Maryland as a payment of a debt from King George II of England. Mr. Deakins sent out two corps of engineers, each without knowledge of the other, to survey the best land in this area. Both crews returned and to their surprise, they had both marked the same Oak tree as their starting and returning points. Mr. Deakins chose this plot of ground and had it patented \"The Accident Tract\". Now called, the Town of Accident! Accident was incorporated in 1916.&nbsp;\u2014 Scharf, J. Thomas (1882).

Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen. One of the molecules is [[2,3-bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)]] and it enhances hemoglobin\u2019s ability to release oxygen.<ref name=\"Gerald 2018\">  {{Cite book | authors= Litwack G| title= Human Biochemistry | year=2018 | chapter=Chapter 8 \u2013 Glycolysis and Glocuneogenesis | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-383864-3}} </ref> 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F. This is because the adult \u03b2 subunit has more positive charges than the fetal \u03b3 subunit, which attract the negative charges from 2,3-BPG. Due to the preference of 2,3-BPG for hemoglobin A, hemoglobin F binds to oxygen with more affinity, in average.<ref name=\"Duane 2016\"> {{cite web |url=https://biosci.mcdb.ucsb.edu/biochemistry/tw-hbn/hbf/hbf-overview.htm\n|title= Comparing the molecular structure differences between HbF and HbA that affect BPG binding|last= Sears|first= Duane|date= 2016|website= https://biosci.mcdb.ucsb.edu/|publisher= Biosci Portal |access-date= 11 March 2020}} </ref>\n\n===Quantification of oxygen binding=== \nTo quantify how strongly a certain type of hemoglobin binds to oxygen (or its affinity for oxygen), a parameter called P50 is often used. In a given situation, P50 can be understood as the minimum concentration of oxygen needed for 50% of the hemoglobin molecules to bind to it.<ref name=\"Vibhu2006\">  {{Cite book | authors= Awasthi V, Goins E and Phillips W| title= Blood Substitutes| year=2006 | chapter=Chapter 43 \u2013 Liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin: history, preparation and evaluation | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-759760-7}} </ref> For example, Hemoglobin F has a lower P50 than hemoglobin A.

Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen.

This is because the adult \u03b2 subunit has more positive charges than the fetal \u03b3 subunit, which attract the negative charges from 2,3-BPG.
