He is an [[infant]] member of the same [[Yoda's species|unnamed alien species]] as the popular ''Star Wars'' character [[Yoda]], with whom he shares a strong ability with [[the Force]]. In the series, the protagonist known as \"[[The Mandalorian (Star Wars character)|The Mandalorian]]\" is hired to track down and capture the Child for a remnant of the fallen [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], but instead becomes his adoptive father and protects him from the Imperials.\n\nThe Child and the Mandalorian are the only characters who have appeared in every episode of the series. He was created by ''The Mandalorian'' creator and [[showrunner]] [[Jon Favreau]] based upon his desire to explore the mystery around Yoda and his species. The character was further developed in early conversations between Favreau and executive producer [[Dave Filoni]], and the character's imagery was defined by concept artist Christian Alzmann. The Child is mostly a work of [[animatronics]] and [[puppetry]], although accentuated with [[computer-generated imagery]].\n\nThe puppet was designed by [[Legacy Effects]] and cost about $5 million to make. It is controlled by two technicians, one who operates the eyes and mouth and another who controls other facial expressions. The character's voice and sounds were created using a combination of adult and infant vocals, as well as recordings of a [[bat-eared fox]] and [[kinkajou]].  The dynamic between the Mandalorian and the Child embody a theme of [[parenting]] and [[Father|fatherhood]] prevalent in ''The Mandalorian'', and the Child character has also raised questions about [[good and evil]] and [[nature versus nurture]] in the show.\n\nThe Child has received a positive reception from fans and reviewers, is widely considered the show's [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]], and quickly became a popular [[Internet meme]]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' called him \"2019's biggest new character\",<ref name=\"Vasquez1203\" /> and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' has said the character \"represents the future of Hollywood\".<ref name=\"Keegan1219\" /> Many writers have described the Child as a key part in the success of Disney+. The Child was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from ''The Mandalorian''{{'}}s prerelease marketing and merchandise plans to avoid leaks before the show aired. As a result, merchandise of the Child was not immediately available after the show debuted, which some analysts say cost Disney $2.7 million in revenue, but [[Bob Iger]], Disney's CEO at the time of ''The Mandalorian'''s premiere, has defended the strategy.\n\n==Appearances==\nThe Child is a member of the same [[Yoda's species|alien species]] as the popular ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Yoda]].<ref name=\"Giardina1205\">{{cite news |last=Giardina |first=Carolyn |title=Why Jon Favreau Chose Baby Yoda: 'We Don't Know a Lot of Details About His Species' |work=[[The Hollywood

That's part of Yoda. It can't just be cute.

While filming one scene, Dave Filoni began to remove the puppet to shoot an alternate take, in case they decided to use a CGI version of the Child in its place. Herzog passionately urged him not to do so and to remain committed to the animatronics and puppetry, saying: \"You are cowards. Leave it.

This occasionally proved challenging for Rosas, who also had to manage the weight of the animatronics in her own costume and face mask, as well as the weight of the Child prop.<ref name=\"Rosas5440\" /> One full day of filming the episode focused upon Kuiil riding the [[blurrg]] creature, a process Rosas described as \"intense\" due to the amount of time she spent on the fake creature and the speeds at which it was made to run. The process was made further challenging because she was carrying the heavy animatronic Child puppet throughout the scenes, and she occasionally needed breaks between takes. Rosas said: \"My legs are not exactly long, so I was squeezing for dear life and holding the baby.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Rosas|Ballance|2020|loc=53:41\u201354:29 Rosas: \"It was Deb's episode, which was very intense.

And, I mean, my legs are not exactly long, so I was squeezing for dear life and holding the baby.

The Mandalorian feels a connection and parental bond with the Child because of his own childhood, when he was orphaned upon the death of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Nevertheless, fatherhood was not a role the Mandalorian was initially seeking, and he makes repeated initial attempts to avoid this responsibility.<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> He first does so in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", when he leaves the Child with the Client,<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> and then again in \"Chapter 4\" Sanctuary\", when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a protective mother on the planet Sorgan who is willing to take the Child into her own family.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> The Mandalorian does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first season finale, \"Chapter 8: Redemption\", when the Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his father figure.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nAnthony Breznican of ''Vanity Fair'' has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the series: \"There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no spit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a parent\u2019s psyche like a dentist\u2019s drill shredding a soft, pink nerve.\"<ref name=\"Breznican1126\" /> Likewise, ''Vulture'' writer Kathryn VanArendonk said the show ignores or does not address many parenting details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what the Child eats, when he goes him to sleep, and whether he wears diapers. She wrote: \"''The Mandalorian'' is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff.\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> VanAnderonk described this as a [[wish fulfillment]] fantasy for parents or prospective parents: \"a vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that\u2019s left are archetypes: the parent, the child\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nThe Child encounters a handful of other protector figures throughout the first season, including Omera, IG-11, and Peli Motto.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Some observers have criticized the series for the fact that the Mandalorian repeatedly leaves the Child alone or in the hands of relative strangers,<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /> as well as for making decisions that place the Child in danger. One example is in \"Chapter 6: The Prisoner\", when he allows a team of dangerous mercenaries to use his ship while the Child is on board, nearly resulting in the Child's death.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /><ref name=\"White1218\">{{cite news |last=White |first=Brett |title=Is Baby Yoda Bad to the Bone?

When the Mandalorian accidentally wakes the child, who had been sleeping in Peli's arms, she chides him: \"Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to sleep?\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> She also condemns the Mandalorian for leaving the child alone on the ship, saying: \"you have an awful lot to learn about raising a young one\".<ref name=\"Keane1207\" /> ''[[ScreenCrush]]'' writer Matt Singer argued the Mandalorian's parenting errors makes the show that much more appealing and relatable because making mistakes is a large part of being a parent.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" />\n\n===Good and evil; nature versus nurture===\nOne scene in \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\" led many fans to reevaluate the Child and question whether he may demonstrate evil tendencies.

He is an [[infant]] member of the same [[Yoda's species|unnamed alien species]] as the popular ''Star Wars'' character [[Yoda]], with whom he shares a strong ability with [[the Force]]. In the series, the protagonist known as \"[[The Mandalorian (Star Wars character)|The Mandalorian]]\" is hired to track down and capture the Child for a remnant of the fallen [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], but instead becomes his adoptive father and protects him from the Imperials.\n\nThe Child and the Mandalorian are the only characters who have appeared in every episode of the series. He was created by ''The Mandalorian'' creator and [[showrunner]] [[Jon Favreau]] based upon his desire to explore the mystery around Yoda and his species. The character was further developed in early conversations between Favreau and executive producer [[Dave Filoni]], and the character's imagery was defined by concept artist Christian Alzmann. The Child is mostly a work of [[animatronics]] and [[puppetry]], although accentuated with [[computer-generated imagery]].\n\nThe puppet was designed by [[Legacy Effects]] and cost about $5 million to make. It is controlled by two technicians, one who operates the eyes and mouth and another who controls other facial expressions. The character's voice and sounds were created using a combination of adult and infant vocals, as well as recordings of a [[bat-eared fox]] and [[kinkajou]].  The dynamic between the Mandalorian and the Child embody a theme of [[parenting]] and [[Father|fatherhood]] prevalent in ''The Mandalorian'', and the Child character has also raised questions about [[good and evil]] and [[nature versus nurture]] in the show.\n\nThe Child has received a positive reception from fans and reviewers, is widely considered the show's [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]], and quickly became a popular [[Internet meme]]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' called him \"2019's biggest new character\",<ref name=\"Vasquez1203\" /> and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' has said the character \"represents the future of Hollywood\".<ref name=\"Keegan1219\" /> Many writers have described the Child as a key part in the success of Disney+. The Child was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from ''The Mandalorian''{{'}}s prerelease marketing and merchandise plans to avoid leaks before the show aired. As a result, merchandise of the Child was not immediately available after the show debuted, which some analysts say cost Disney $2.7 million in revenue, but [[Bob Iger]], Disney's CEO at the time of ''The Mandalorian'''s premiere, has defended the strategy.\n\n==Appearances==\nThe Child is a member of the same [[Yoda's species|alien species]] as the popular ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Yoda]].<ref name=\"Giardina1205\">{{cite news |last=Giardina |first=Carolyn |title=Why Jon Favreau Chose Baby Yoda: 'We Don't Know a Lot of Details About His Species' |work=[[The Hollywood

While filming one scene, Dave Filoni began to remove the puppet to shoot an alternate take, in case they decided to use a CGI version of the Child in its place. Herzog passionately urged him not to do so and to remain committed to the animatronics and puppetry, saying: \"You are cowards. Leave it.

This occasionally proved challenging for Rosas, who also had to manage the weight of the animatronics in her own costume and face mask, as well as the weight of the Child prop.<ref name=\"Rosas5440\" /> One full day of filming the episode focused upon Kuiil riding the [[blurrg]] creature, a process Rosas described as \"intense\" due to the amount of time she spent on the fake creature and the speeds at which it was made to run. The process was made further challenging because she was carrying the heavy animatronic Child puppet throughout the scenes, and she occasionally needed breaks between takes. Rosas said: \"My legs are not exactly long, so I was squeezing for dear life and holding the baby.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Rosas|Ballance|2020|loc=53:41\u201354:29 Rosas: \"It was Deb's episode, which was very intense.

And, I mean, my legs are not exactly long, so I was squeezing for dear life and holding the baby.

During the first take of filming the scene, Pally punched the animatronic Child puppet hard, prompting Favreau to inform the actor that the puppet costs about $5 million to make.

The Mandalorian feels a connection and parental bond with the Child because of his own childhood, when he was orphaned upon the death of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Nevertheless, fatherhood was not a role the Mandalorian was initially seeking, and he makes repeated initial attempts to avoid this responsibility.<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> He first does so in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", when he leaves the Child with the Client,<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> and then again in \"Chapter 4\" Sanctuary\", when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a protective mother on the planet Sorgan who is willing to take the Child into her own family.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> The Mandalorian does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first season finale, \"Chapter 8: Redemption\", when the Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his father figure.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nAnthony Breznican of ''Vanity Fair'' has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the series: \"There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no spit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a parent\u2019s psyche like a dentist\u2019s drill shredding a soft, pink nerve.\"<ref name=\"Breznican1126\" /> Likewise, ''Vulture'' writer Kathryn VanArendonk said the show ignores or does not address many parenting details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what the Child eats, when he goes him to sleep, and whether he wears diapers. She wrote: \"''The Mandalorian'' is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff.\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> VanAnderonk described this as a [[wish fulfillment]] fantasy for parents or prospective parents: \"a vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that\u2019s left are archetypes: the parent, the child\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nThe Child encounters a handful of other protector figures throughout the first season, including Omera, IG-11, and Peli Motto.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Some observers have criticized the series for the fact that the Mandalorian repeatedly leaves the Child alone or in the hands of relative strangers,<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /> as well as for making decisions that place the Child in danger. One example is in \"Chapter 6: The Prisoner\", when he allows a team of dangerous mercenaries to use his ship while the Child is on board, nearly resulting in the Child's death.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /><ref name=\"White1218\">{{cite news |last=White |first=Brett |title=Is Baby Yoda Bad to the Bone?

When the Mandalorian accidentally wakes the child, who had been sleeping in Peli's arms, she chides him: \"Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to sleep?\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> She also condemns the Mandalorian for leaving the child alone on the ship, saying: \"you have an awful lot to learn about raising a young one\".<ref name=\"Keane1207\" /> ''[[ScreenCrush]]'' writer Matt Singer argued the Mandalorian's parenting errors makes the show that much more appealing and relatable because making mistakes is a large part of being a parent.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" />\n\n===Good and evil; nature versus nurture===\nOne scene in \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\" led many fans to reevaluate the Child and question whether he may demonstrate evil tendencies. During a scene on the Mandalorian's spaceship, the Child observes as the Mandalorian and Cara Dune engage in a friendly [[arm wrestling]] match.

Miller suggested the Child could be putting on a similar performance.<ref name=\"Miller1218\" /> One fan theory suggests the Child could be related to a prophecy in a past ''Star Wars'' work that predicted an evil that could consume the galaxy. The prophecy, described in the novel ''[[Star Wars: Master and Apprentice]]'' (2019), says: \"The danger of the past is not past, but sleeps in an egg. When the egg cracks, it will threaten the galaxy entire.\" Fans theorized this could refer to the Child, who sleeps in an egg-like bassinet in ''The Mandalorian''.<ref name=\"Abdulbaki0106\" /> Others have theorized the reason the Imperial remnant wants the Child is to turn him over to the dark side of the Force,<ref name=\"Milner1222\" /> or for use as a weapon.<ref name=\"Foy1221\" /> Moff Gideon in the season finale says: \"You may think you have some idea what you\u2019re in possession of, but you do not.\" Peter Foy of ''Comic Book Resources'' suggested this could allude to the Child's potential to cause mass destruction.<ref name=\"Foy1221\" />\n\nCaitlin Gallagher of ''[[Bustle (website)|Bustle]]'' suggested rather than building toward the Child becoming evil, the show could be suggesting the Mandalorian needs to find a way to raise the Child in a less violent environment.<ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> All season long, the Child has witnessed those around him committing violent acts.<ref name=\"Milner1222\">{{cite news |last=Milner |first=Sarah Bea |title=The Mandalorian: Baby Yoda Learns About Good & Bad In A Powerful Way |work=[[Screen Rant]] |date=December 22, 2019 |url=https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-makes-statement-nature-versus-nurture/ |accessdate=February 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191223125659/https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-makes-statement-nature-versus-nurture/ |archive-date=December 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> For example, ''Vulture'' writer Keith Phipps noticed that when IG-11 kills multiple stormtroopers in front of him, the Child has a \"look of wonder\" in his eyes, which Phipps said \"is hilarious, but also a little chilling\".<ref name=\"Phipps1227\" /> Some writers applied a [[nature versus nurture]] argument to this, contending the Child is becoming violent because of what he is learning based on the actions around him.<ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> This suggests the Child is not inherently good or evil,<ref name=\"Milner1222\" /><ref name=\"Foy1221\" /> but that instead, like all children, he is impressionable and does not fully understand the events occurring around him.

There is no known record that it was ever enforced against homosexual acts that took place between consenting adults in private. In certain cases, defendants were found guilty of \"sodomy\" (which according to Israeli law included [[oral sex]] as well), apparently by way of plea bargains: Those defendants had been indicted for more serious sexual offences. It was also used as \"[[Aggravation (law)|aggravating circumstances]]\" for other sexual offences. There were also several cases of soldiers tried for homosexual acts in military courts. [[Attorney General of Israel|The Attorney General]] decided in the early 1960s, and the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli Supreme Court]] ruled in 1963, that the law should not be applied to acts between consenting adults in private. The ban on consensual same-sex sexual acts was formally repealed by the National Legislative Assembly ([[Knesset]]) in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/law/aeyalgross/Danilowitz.htm |title=Supreme Court of Israel |publisher=Tau.ac.il |accessdate=2011-06-14}}</ref> The [[age of consent]] for both homosexual and heterosexual acts is 16 years of age.\n\n===Recognition of same-sex relationships===\n{{Main|Unregistered cohabitation in Israel|Recognition of same-sex unions in Israel}}\n[[File:Hayovel gay 3.JPG|thumb|Signs supporting same-sex marriage in [[Herzliya]], 2012]]\nBetween 1994 and 2007, numerous rights were granted to Israeli same-sex couples.<ref>[http://www.acri.org.il/en/2009/02/15/protecting-and-promoting-lgbt-rights-in-israel/ Protecting and Promoting LGBT Rights in Israel]</ref>\n\nSame-sex marriage cannot legally be performed in Israel. Israeli law allows same-sex marriages performed elsewhere to be registered, but not recognized based upon a 2006 Israeli Supreme Court decision which stated \"Before we conclude, let us reemphasize what it is that we are deciding today, and what it is that we are not deciding today. We are deciding that within the context of the status of the population registry as a recorder of statistics, the registration official should register in the population register what is implied by the public certificate that is presented to him by the petitioners, according to which the petitioners are married and in view of the role of the registration official as a collector of statistical material for the purpose of managing the registry...We are not deciding that marriage between persons of the same sex is recognized in Israel; we are not recognizing a new status of such marriages; we are not adopting any position with regard to recognition in Israel of marriages between persons of the same sex that take place outside Israel (whether between Israeli residents or between persons who are not Israeli residents)\"<ref name=\"elyon1.court.gov.il\">{{cite web |url=http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/05/450/030/a09/05030450.a09.htm |title=Judgement of the Supreme Court sitting as the High Court of Justice }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> [[Civil marriage]] doesn't exist in Israel for heterosexual couples either (except where both heterosexual spouses do not belong to any of the recognized religious communities in the country),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/136544|title=Civil Marriage for Non-Jews|work=Arutz Sheva}}</ref> and therefore only a marriage sanctioned by the small number of officially recognized religious authorities can take place within Israel. (This restriction forces not only same-sex couples, but also all mixed-religion heterosexual couples and any person who wishes a non-religious marriage, to marry outside the country.)\n\nThe State of Israel allows foreign partners of its homosexual [[citizenry]] to receive residency permits. The Civil Service Commission extends spousal benefits and pensions to the partners of homosexual employees. The Israeli State Attorney's Office has extended the spousal exemption from property-transfer taxes to same-sex couples. Israel's Attorney General has granted legal recognition to same-sex couples in financial and other business matters. [[Attorney General]] [[Meni Mazuz]] said the couples will be treated the same as common-law spouses, recognizing them as legal units for tax, real estate, and financial purposes. Mazuz made his decision by refusing to appeal a district court ruling in an inheritance case that recognized the legality of a same-sex union, his office said in a statement. Mazuz did differentiate, however, between recognizing same-sex unions for financial and practical purposes, as he did, and changing the law to officially sanction the unions, which would be a matter for Parliament, according to the statement.\n\nThe city of [[Tel Aviv]] recognizes unmarried couples, including gays and lesbians, as family units and grants them discounts for [[municipal services]]. Under the bylaw, unmarried couples qualify for the same discounts on daycare and the use of swimming pools, sports facilities, and other city-sponsored activities that married couples enjoy.

On 10 January 2005, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] ruled that a lesbian couple is able to legally [[Adoption|adopt]] each other's children. During the past 15 years that Tal and Avital Jarus-Hakak had lived together, they had a total of three children. The couple petitioned the Tel Aviv Family Court for the right to formally adopt each other's children in 1997, but the request was rejected because Israel's adoption law had no provisions for same-sex couples. The couple appealed. While they failed to get a favorable ruling in the Tel Aviv District Court, the Supreme Court accepted the case. Citing Article 25 of the ''Adoption of Children Law of 1981'' ({{lang-he|\u05d7\u05d5\u05e7 \u05d0\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05e5 \u05d9\u05dc\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd, \u05ea\u05e9\u05de\"\u05d0-1981}}; [[Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|\u0642\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u062a\u0628\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0637\u0641\u0627\u0644 1981}}), the Jarus-Hakaks argued that the law allows for \"special circumstances\" for adoption when it is for the good of the child, even if the child's parents are still alive. The only condition is that the person seeking to adopt be single. The couple argued that since the state does not recognize same-sex marriage, they are single by law. They added that adoption was in the best interest of the children if one of their natural mothers should die. The Supreme Court of Israel agreed, ruling 7\u20132 in favor of the couple. Following the Supreme Court ruling, the couple was allowed to adopt each other's biological children on 12 February 2006. Before that, the gay partner of the parent was granted guardianship over their partner's children. Lesbian couples can also legally gain access to IVF and assisted insemination.\n\nIn February 2008, a court in [[Israel]] ruled that same-sex couples are now permitted to adopt a child even if that child is not biologically related to either parent.<ref name=\"Haaretz\">[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/953097.html AG okays wider adoption rights for same-sex couples], By Yuval Yoaz, 12 February 2008.</ref> This marked a watershed in granting [[Egalitarianism|equal rights]] to all [[gay]] people in Israel.<ref name=\"Haaretz\" /> [[isRealli]], the official blog of the State of Israel, frequently publishes updates on gay adoption news in Israel.

In July 2018, the Knesset passed a bill expending surrogacy rights to single women, but rejected an amendment that would have included same-sex couples. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu supported the amendment, but later voted against it due to objections from Orthodox groups.

Under the proposal, the non-biological parent would have to send a notice to the Interior Ministry. However, the Israeli Government rejected this measure, and insisted that same-sex couples should receive a court order if they wish to register their child(ren) with both their names.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/amp/israel-news/.premium-israel-rejects-compromise-on-legal-requirements-for-lesbian-parents-1.6450803|title=Israel Rejects Court-proposed Compromise to List Both Members of Lesbian Couple as Parents|website=Haaretz|date=4 September 2018}}</ref> In December 2018, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|High Court of Justice]] ruled that same-sex parents have the right to be listed on their child(ren)'s birth certificates.

The ruling came after two gay men adopted a son, then tried to list both their names on his birth certificate, but government officials refused to do so. Supreme Court Justice [[Neal Hendel]] said in the decision: \"The principle of \"the good of the child\" argues for the recording of his entire family unit, and doesn't permit us to limit ourselves to only one of his parents in the birth certificate\u2026. The contrast with the treatment of a child adopted by a heterosexual couple, who has the right to have both adopted parents written in a birth certificate, is a contrast that applies both to the child and to the parents...

The film follows a young Israeli gay man, living and working with his grandparents, who has dreams of making a film and finding true love. Guttman, who died of AIDS in 1993, would write and direct another Israeli gay-themed film titled ''[[Amazing Grace (1992 film)|Amazing Grace]]'' (1992). Both films are considered to be autobiographies of the director. In total, Guttman directed four films and three short films. His portrayal of Israeli gay men was dark, and his films are considered to be targeted at the LGBT community in Israel, and not to the general public.\n\n[[File:Eytan Fox 2012 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|upright|Israeli director [[Eytan Fox]]]]\nAnother notable Israeli director to tackle LGBT themes in films is [[Eytan Fox]]. His first film, ''Time Off'' (1990), was the second film made in Israel to focus on gay people. He has directed and written several other successful LGBT-themed films, including ''[[Ba'al Ba'al Lev]]'' (1997), ''[[Yossi & Jagger]]'' (2002), ''[[Walk on Water (film)|Walk on Water]]'' (2004), and ''[[The Bubble (2006 film)|The Bubble]]'' (2006).<ref>{{cite web |author=Andrejs Visockis |url=http://andysfilmworld.blogspot.com/2008/01/yossi-jagger-israel-2002.html |title=Andy's Film World: ''Yossi & Jagger'' (Israel, 2002) |publisher=Andysfilmworld.blogspot.com |date=27 January 2008 |accessdate=2011-06-14}}</ref> Fox was also involved in the first Israeli prime time TV drama made for a general audience which dealt extensively with [[LGBT]]-themes, ''Florentin'' (1997\u20132000). This was an Israeli television series about a group of post-military service, Israeli twenty-somethings living in [[Florentin (Tel Aviv)|Florentin]]. It was the first Israeli series to have a gay person among its major characters, and was part of a slow trend that had been unfolding in the 1990s with shows such as ''Straight and to the Point'' and ''Siton''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nToday, there is more programming for a [[LGBT]] audience. In 1993, the first commercial TV network in Israel, [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]], went on the air. It regularly dealt with [[LGBT]] social and political topics, and, in particular, helped generate greater visibility and acceptance of transgender celebrities such as [[Dana International]].<ref name=\"Walzer 2000\"/> The LGBT community in Israel was also brought to the media's attention following the winning of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in 1998 by Dana International, an Israeli [[transsexual|transwoman]]. At present, LGBT people in Israel can be seen on television in a variety of shows, mostly as hosts (such as [[Assi Azar]]), contestants in [[reality show]]s or characters on [[soap opera]]s.\n\n==Palestinian issues==\n{{further|LGBT rights in the Palestinian territories}}\nPalestinian society tends to be conservative, with families tending to see homosexuality and [[cross-dressing]] as immoral acts, deserving of condemnation. Some LGBT Palestinians have relocated to Israel, often fleeing harsh intolerance that includes physical abuse, death, or disowning. Significant [[expatriate]] groups exist in [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Netanya]], where many live with their Israeli same-sex partners who help keep their presence in Israel hidden from the police (who would pursue them not for their sexual orientation, but for staying illegally in the country).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid%3D13623 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-07-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051018001739/http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=13623 |archivedate=18 October 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2002/02/21/ezra_selim/ |title=Sleeping with the enemy \u2013 Middle East |work=Salon.com |date=21 February 2002 |accessdate=2011-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.baywindows.com/main.cfm/include/detail/storyid/245628.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20051122220931/http://www.baywindows.com/main.cfm/include/detail/storyid/245628.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 November 2005|title=Where Jews and Arabs find ways to mix peacefully in the Holy Land|work=Bay Windows|date=22 May 2002|last=Cassels|first=Peter}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Aswat was founded, which describes itself as a Palestinian lesbian support group.

There is no known record that it was ever enforced against homosexual acts that took place between consenting adults in private. In certain cases, defendants were found guilty of \"sodomy\" (which according to Israeli law included [[oral sex]] as well), apparently by way of plea bargains: Those defendants had been indicted for more serious sexual offences. It was also used as \"[[Aggravation (law)|aggravating circumstances]]\" for other sexual offences. There were also several cases of soldiers tried for homosexual acts in military courts. [[Attorney General of Israel|The Attorney General]] decided in the early 1960s, and the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli Supreme Court]] ruled in 1963, that the law should not be applied to acts between consenting adults in private. The ban on consensual same-sex sexual acts was formally repealed by the National Legislative Assembly ([[Knesset]]) in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/law/aeyalgross/Danilowitz.htm |title=Supreme Court of Israel |publisher=Tau.ac.il |accessdate=2011-06-14}}</ref> The [[age of consent]] for both homosexual and heterosexual acts is 16 years of age.\n\n===Recognition of same-sex relationships===\n{{Main|Unregistered cohabitation in Israel|Recognition of same-sex unions in Israel}}\n[[File:Hayovel gay 3.JPG|thumb|Signs supporting same-sex marriage in [[Herzliya]], 2012]]\nBetween 1994 and 2007, numerous rights were granted to Israeli same-sex couples.<ref>[http://www.acri.org.il/en/2009/02/15/protecting-and-promoting-lgbt-rights-in-israel/ Protecting and Promoting LGBT Rights in Israel]</ref>\n\nSame-sex marriage cannot legally be performed in Israel. Israeli law allows same-sex marriages performed elsewhere to be registered, but not recognized based upon a 2006 Israeli Supreme Court decision which stated \"Before we conclude, let us reemphasize what it is that we are deciding today, and what it is that we are not deciding today. We are deciding that within the context of the status of the population registry as a recorder of statistics, the registration official should register in the population register what is implied by the public certificate that is presented to him by the petitioners, according to which the petitioners are married and in view of the role of the registration official as a collector of statistical material for the purpose of managing the registry...We are not deciding that marriage between persons of the same sex is recognized in Israel; we are not recognizing a new status of such marriages; we are not adopting any position with regard to recognition in Israel of marriages between persons of the same sex that take place outside Israel (whether between Israeli residents or between persons who are not Israeli residents)\"<ref name=\"elyon1.court.gov.il\">{{cite web |url=http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/05/450/030/a09/05030450.a09.htm |title=Judgement of the Supreme Court sitting as the High Court of Justice }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> [[Civil marriage]] doesn't exist in Israel for heterosexual couples either (except where both heterosexual spouses do not belong to any of the recognized religious communities in the country),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/136544|title=Civil Marriage for Non-Jews|work=Arutz Sheva}}</ref> and therefore only a marriage sanctioned by the small number of officially recognized religious authorities can take place within Israel. (This restriction forces not only same-sex couples, but also all mixed-religion heterosexual couples and any person who wishes a non-religious marriage, to marry outside the country.)\n\nThe State of Israel allows foreign partners of its homosexual [[citizenry]] to receive residency permits. The Civil Service Commission extends spousal benefits and pensions to the partners of homosexual employees. The Israeli State Attorney's Office has extended the spousal exemption from property-transfer taxes to same-sex couples. Israel's Attorney General has granted legal recognition to same-sex couples in financial and other business matters. [[Attorney General]] [[Meni Mazuz]] said the couples will be treated the same as common-law spouses, recognizing them as legal units for tax, real estate, and financial purposes. Mazuz made his decision by refusing to appeal a district court ruling in an inheritance case that recognized the legality of a same-sex union, his office said in a statement. Mazuz did differentiate, however, between recognizing same-sex unions for financial and practical purposes, as he did, and changing the law to officially sanction the unions, which would be a matter for Parliament, according to the statement.\n\nThe city of [[Tel Aviv]] recognizes unmarried couples, including gays and lesbians, as family units and grants them discounts for [[municipal services]].

On 10 January 2005, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] ruled that a lesbian couple is able to legally [[Adoption|adopt]] each other's children. During the past 15 years that Tal and Avital Jarus-Hakak had lived together, they had a total of three children. The couple petitioned the Tel Aviv Family Court for the right to formally adopt each other's children in 1997, but the request was rejected because Israel's adoption law had no provisions for same-sex couples. The couple appealed. While they failed to get a favorable ruling in the Tel Aviv District Court, the Supreme Court accepted the case. Citing Article 25 of the ''Adoption of Children Law of 1981'' ({{lang-he|\u05d7\u05d5\u05e7 \u05d0\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05e5 \u05d9\u05dc\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd, \u05ea\u05e9\u05de\"\u05d0-1981}}; [[Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|\u0642\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u062a\u0628\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0637\u0641\u0627\u0644 1981}}), the Jarus-Hakaks argued that the law allows for \"special circumstances\" for adoption when it is for the good of the child, even if the child's parents are still alive. The only condition is that the person seeking to adopt be single. The couple argued that since the state does not recognize same-sex marriage, they are single by law. They added that adoption was in the best interest of the children if one of their natural mothers should die. The Supreme Court of Israel agreed, ruling 7\u20132 in favor of the couple. Following the Supreme Court ruling, the couple was allowed to adopt each other's biological children on 12 February 2006. Before that, the gay partner of the parent was granted guardianship over their partner's children. Lesbian couples can also legally gain access to IVF and assisted insemination.\n\nIn February 2008, a court in [[Israel]] ruled that same-sex couples are now permitted to adopt a child even if that child is not biologically related to either parent.<ref name=\"Haaretz\">[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/953097.html AG okays wider adoption rights for same-sex couples], By Yuval Yoaz, 12 February 2008.</ref> This marked a watershed in granting [[Egalitarianism|equal rights]] to all [[gay]] people in Israel.<ref name=\"Haaretz\" /> [[isRealli]], the official blog of the State of Israel, frequently publishes updates on gay adoption news in Israel.

In July 2018, the Knesset passed a bill expending surrogacy rights to single women, but rejected an amendment that would have included same-sex couples. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu supported the amendment, but later voted against it due to objections from Orthodox groups. Subsequently, an estimated 100,000 people marched in Tel Aviv in protest.<ref>[https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/179963-180722-thousands-to-protest-strike-over-surrogacy-law-excluding-gay-men 100,000 in Israel protest, strike over surrogacy law excluding gay men]</ref> The protests also received support from multiple companies, including [[Apple Inc.]], [[Microsoft]], [[Israir Airlines]] and many more, and an opinion poll conducted in July 2018 found that 57% of Israelis were in favour of surrogacy for same-sex couples. Despite the passage of the law, several court rulings have protected surrogacy rights for same-sex couples.<ref name=\"surroisrael\"/> In February 2020, the Israeli Supreme Court unanimously ruled that same-sex couples should be given access to surrogacy, holding that the current law harms the \"right to equality\" and gave the state one year to amend the existing legislation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkVSudHEI|title=Supreme Court rules same-sex couples be given access to surrogacy|date=2020-02-27|website=ynetnews|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2018, the Israeli High Court proposed to make it easier for children raised by same-sex couples to be registered on official documents with the names of both their parents. Under the proposal, the non-biological parent would have to send a notice to the Interior Ministry. However, the Israeli Government rejected this measure, and insisted that same-sex couples should receive a court order if they wish to register their child(ren) with both their names.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/amp/israel-news/.premium-israel-rejects-compromise-on-legal-requirements-for-lesbian-parents-1.6450803|title=Israel Rejects Court-proposed Compromise to List Both Members of Lesbian Couple as Parents|website=Haaretz|date=4 September 2018}}</ref> In December 2018, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|High Court of Justice]] ruled that same-sex parents have the right to be listed on their child(ren)'s birth certificates.

The ruling came after two gay men adopted a son, then tried to list both their names on his birth certificate, but government officials refused to do so. Supreme Court Justice [[Neal Hendel]] said in the decision: \"The principle of \"the good of the child\" argues for the recording of his entire family unit, and doesn't permit us to limit ourselves to only one of his parents in the birth certificate\u2026. The contrast with the treatment of a child adopted by a heterosexual couple, who has the right to have both adopted parents written in a birth certificate, is a contrast that applies both to the child and to the parents...

The film follows a young Israeli gay man, living and working with his grandparents, who has dreams of making a film and finding true love. Guttman, who died of AIDS in 1993, would write and direct another Israeli gay-themed film titled ''[[Amazing Grace (1992 film)|Amazing Grace]]'' (1992). Both films are considered to be autobiographies of the director. In total, Guttman directed four films and three short films.

In 1993, the first commercial TV network in Israel, [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]], went on the air.
