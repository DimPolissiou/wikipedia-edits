The bombings, together with the [[Dagestan War]], served as a [[casus belli]] for the [[Second Chechen War]]. [[Vladimir Putin]]\u2019s handling of the crisis boosted his popularity and helped him attain the presidency within a few months.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoffman|2002|pp=461\u2013477}}</ref><ref name=\"strobeTalbott\">{{Harvnb|Talbott|2002|pp=356\u2013357}}</ref>\n\nThe blasts hit Buynaksk on 4 September and in Moscow on 9 and 13 September. On 13 September, [[Russian Duma]] speaker [[Gennadiy Seleznyov]] made an announcement in the Duma about receiving a report that another bombing had just happened in the city of [[Volgodonsk]]. A bombing did indeed happen in Volgodonsk, but only three days later, on 16 September. Chechen militants were blamed for the bombings, but denied responsibility, along with Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]. A suspicious device resembling those used in these bombings was found and defused in an apartment block in the Russian city of [[Ryazan]] on 22 September.<ref name=lentaprosecutors>[http://vip.lenta.ru/doc/2002/05/14/prosecutors/ \u041e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0413\u0435\u043d\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441 \u043e \u0432\u0437\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0445 \u0432 \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0435] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210221753/http://vip.lenta.ru/doc/2002/05/14/prosecutors/ |date=10 February 2012 }} {{in lang|ru}}, [https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&tl=en&u=http://vip.lenta.ru/doc/2002/05/14/prosecutors/ machine translation].</ref> The next day, Vladimir Putin praised the vigilance of the inhabitants of Ryazan and ordered the air bombing of [[Grozny]], which marked the beginning of the Second Chechen War.<ref>{{harvnb|Goldfarb|Litvinenko|2007|pp=190, 196}}</ref> Three [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]] agents who had planted the devices at Ryazan were arrested by the local police.<ref name=\"AmyKnight\" /> On September 24, 1999, head of FSB [[Nikolay Patrushev]] announced that the incident in Ryazan had been an anti-terror drill and the device found there contained only sugar.<ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9909/24/russia.bomb.01/\n| title       = Russian bomb scare turns out to be anti-terror drill\n| publisher   = CNN\n| date        = 24 September 1999\n}}</ref>\n\nParliament member [[Yuri Shchekochikhin]] filed two motions for a parliamentary investigation of the events, but the motions were rejected by the Russian [[Duma]] in March 2000.

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the Federal Security Service Employee Day in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a hunting cartridge that would not be able to detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{in lang|ru}} [http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm Today is the Federal Security Service Employee Day: Satisfied with the year summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |date=31 January 2011 }}, [[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]], 20 December 2001, [https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&tl=en&u=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244%26m=8.htm computer translation]</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei Pinyayev of the 137th Regiment, who guarded a military facility near the city of Ryazan, together with a friend.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

Moral cognitive development centered around justice and guided moral action increase with development, resulting in a postconventional thinker that can \"do no other\" than what is reasoned to be the most moral action. But researchers using the Kohlberg model found a gap between what people said was most moral and actions they took. Today, some psychologists and students{{Where|date=February 2018}} alike rely on Augusto Blasi's self-model{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} that link ideas of moral judgment and action through moral commitment. Those with moral goals central to the self-concept are more likely to take moral action, as they feel a greater obligation to do so.

The intention was to learn more about moral exemplars and to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the Kohlberg measure. They found that the MJI scores were not clustered at the high end of Kohlberg's scale, they ranged from stage 3 to stage 5. Half landed at the conventional level (stages 3, 3/4, and 4) and the other half landed at the postconventional level (stages 4/5 and 5). Compared to the general population, the scores of the moral exemplars may be somewhat higher than those of groups not selected for outstanding moral behaviour. Researchers noted that the \"moral judgement scores are clearly related to subjects' educational attainment in this study\". Among the participants that had attained college education or above, there was no difference in moral judgement scores between genders. The study noted that although the exemplars' scores may have been higher than those of nonexemplars, it is also clear that one is not required to score at Kohlberg's highest stages in order to exhibit high degrees of moral commitment and exemplary behaviour.<ref name=\":2\" /> Apart from their scores, it was found that the 23 participating moral exemplars described three similar themes within all of their moral developments: certainty, positivity, and the unity of self and moral goals. The unity between self and moral goals was highlighted as the most important theme as it is what truly sets the exemplars apart from the 'ordinary' people. It was discovered that the moral exemplars see their morality as a part of their sense of identity and sense of self, not as a conscious choice or chore. Also, the moral exemplars showed a much broader range of moral concern than did the ordinary people and go beyond the normal acts of daily moral engagements.\n\nRather than confirm the existence of a single highest stage, Larry Walker's [[cluster analysis]] of a wide variety of interview and survey variables for moral exemplars found three types: the \"caring\" or \"communal\" cluster was strongly relational and generative, the \"deliberative\" cluster had sophisticated [[epistemic]] and moral reasoning, and the \"brave\" or \"ordinary\" cluster was less distinguished by personality.<ref name=\"Walker2010\">{{cite journal | last=Walker | first=Lawrence J. | last2=Frimer | first2=Jeremy A. | last3=Dunlop | first3=William L. | title=Varieties of moral personality: beyond the banality of heroism | journal=Journal of Personality | volume=78 | year=2010 | pages=907\u2013942 | issue=3| pmid=20573130 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00637.x}}</ref>\n\n===Survey instruments===\nBetween 1910 and 1930, in the United States and Europe, several morality tests were developed to classify subjects as fit or unfit to make moral judgments.<ref name=Wendorf2001/><ref name=\"Verplaetse2008\">{{cite journal | last=Verplaetse | first=Jan | title=Measuring the moral sense: morality tests in continental Europe between 1910 and 1930 | journal= Paedagogica Historica | volume=44 | issue=3 | year=2008 | pages=265\u2013286 | doi=10.1080/00309230701722721}}</ref> Test-takers would classify or rank standardized lists of personality traits, hypothetical actions, or pictures of hypothetical scenes.

Scholars, such as Blasi, began proposing identity as a motivating factor in moral motivation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Augusto|date=1980|title=Bridging moral cognition and moral action: A critical review of the literature.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=88|issue=1|pages=1\u201345|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.88.1.1|issn=0033-2909}}</ref> Blasi proposed the self model of moral functioning, which described the effects of the judgment of responsibility to perform a moral action, one's sense of moral identity, and the desire for self-consistency on moral action. Blasi also elaborates on the structure of identity and its connection to morality.  According to Blasi, there are two aspects that form identity. One of the aspects focuses on the specific contents that make up the self (objective identity content), which include moral ideals. The second refers to the ways in which identity is subjectively experienced (subjective identity experience). As the subjective side of identity matures, the objective side tends to lean towards internal contents like values, beliefs, and goals, rather than external identity contents like physical aspects, behaviors, and relationships. A mature subjective identity yearns for a greater sense of self-consistency. Therefore, identity would serve as a motivation for moral action. \nStudies of moral exemplars have shown that exemplary moral action often results from the intertwining of personal goals and desires with moral goals, and studies on moral behavior also show a correlation between moral identity and action. S. Hardy and G. Carlo raise critical questions about Blasi's model as well, and propose that researchers should seek to better operationalize and measure moral identity and apply findings to moral education and intervention programs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hardy | first1 = S.

This unity of their self and morality is what distinguishes them from non-exemplars and in turn makes them exceptional.<ref>{{cite book|title=Morality in Everyday Life: Developmental Perspectives|last1=Colby|first1=Anne|last2=Damon|first2=William|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-521-66586-5|editor-last=Killen|editor-first=Melanie|location=|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA362 362]|chapter=The Development of Extraordinary Moral Commitment|editor-last2=Hart|editor-first2=Daniel|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA342}}</ref> Colby and Damon studied moral identity through the narratives of civil rights activist [[Virginia Foster Durr]] and Suzie Valadez, who provided services for the poor, whose behavior, actions, and life's works were considered to be morally exemplary by their communities and those with whom they came in contact. Some common characteristics that these moral exemplars possess are certainty, positivity (e.g. enjoyment of work, and optimism), and unity of self and moral goals.{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA361 361\u2013362]}} The research suggests that a \"transformation of goals\" takes place during the evolution of one's moral identity and development and therefore is not an exercise of self-sacrifice but rather one done with great joy; moral exemplars see their personal goals and moral goals as synonymous. This transformation is not always a deliberate process and is most often a gradual process, but can also be rapidly set off by a triggering event.{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=354}} Triggering events can be anything from a powerful moment in a movie to a [[Trauma (psychology)|traumatic life event]], or as in the case of Suzie Valadez, the perception of a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision from God]]. In many of the moral exemplars interviewed, the triggering events and goal transformation did not take place until their 40s. Moral exemplars are said to have the same concerns and commitments as other moral people but to a greater degree, \"extensions in scope, intensity and breadth\".{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA364 364]}} Furthermore, exemplars possess the ability to be open to new ideas and experiences, also known as an \"active receptiveness\"{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=350}} to things exterior to themselves.\n\nDaniel Hart conducted a study to see how adolescents who engaged in exemplary levels of prosocial behavior viewed themselves. To empirically study self-concept, he used four different conceptual models to illustrate the concept of self: Self-Concept as Content, Self-Concept as Semantic Space, Self-Concept as Hierarchy of Selves, and Self-Concept as Theory. The findings suggested that adolescent caring exemplars formulated their self-concept differently from comparable peers. In a hierarchy of selves model, exemplars were shown to incorporate their \"ideal self\" into their \"actual self\". Among the exemplar group there was more incorporation of parental representations with the \"actual self\". Conversely, there was less incorporation of representations of their best friend or the self-expected by the best friend. It is theorized that this is because adolescents are less likely to pick a best friend who is a \"goody-goody\" and deeply involved in service, as well as exemplars possibly having to give up peer expectations in order to engage in service. In a Self-Concept as Theory model, exemplars were most commonly at level 4, a level of self-theory uncommonly reached by adolescents, but common among exemplars. They were also more likely to emphasize academic goals and moral typical activities. There were no significant differences between the exemplars and the control group concerning moral knowledge. On a [[semantic space]] analysis, the moral exemplars tended to view their actual self as more integrated with their ideal and expected self.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=D.|last2=Fegley|first2=S.|year=1995|title=Prosocial behavior and caring in adolescence: Relations to self-understanding and social judgment|url=http://www.uca.edu.ar/uca/common/grupo18/files/hartfegley1995CD.pdf|journal=Child Development|volume=66|issue=5|pages=1346\u20131359|doi=10.2307/1131651|pmid=7555220|via=|jstor=1131651}}</ref>\n\n[[David Wong (philosopher)|David Wong]] proposes that we think of cultures in an analogy to a conversation, there are people with different beliefs, values, and norms that can voice their opinion loudly or quietly, but over the course of time these factors can change. A moral culture can provide other members with a kind of \"language\" where there is plenty of room for different \"dialects\", this allows moral identities to be established and voiced more. Opposing ideas can create conflict between those who are close to us, such as family and friends, and strangers. This can bring a greater risk of trying to decide the best course of action in which either party will be affected by it. In essence the notion of Wong's theory is that in order to define our true morality it ultimately comes down to acceptance and being able to accommodate within and between cultures around the world. He also believes that the concept of culture as conversation will help reduce the problems with boundaries between cultures, reconcile the autonomy with the cultural aspect of moral identity and call into question the understanding of healthy and well developed moral identity.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Narvaez |first1=Darcia |last2=Lapsley |first2=Daniel K. |title=Personality, Identity, and Character: Explorations in Moral Psychology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-521-89507-1 |pages=79\u2013105 |chapter=Chapter 4}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Blasi's theory on [[moral character]], moral character is identified by the person's set of the morality of virtues and vices.

He believed that the \"highest\" and complex of virtues are expressed by willpower while the \"lowest\" and simplistic of virtues are expressed integrity.

With the research they reviewed and their own extension of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]], they conclude that value-attitude-behavior depends on the individual and their moral reasoning. They also pointed out that there are such things as good values and bad values. Good values are those that guide our attitudes and behaviors and allow us to express and define ourselves. It also involves the ability to know when values are appropriate in response to the situation or person that you are dealing with. Bad values on the other hand are those that are relied on so much that it makes you unresponsive to the needs and perspectives of others.\n\nAnother issue that Kristiansen and Hotte discovered through their research was that individuals tended to \"create\" values to justify their reactions to certain situations, which they called the \"value justification hypothesis\".<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d /> The authors use an example from feminist [[Susan Faludi]]'s journal entry of how during the period when women were fighting for their right to vote, a New Rights group appealed to society's ideals of \"traditional family values\" as an argument against the new law in order to mask their own \"anger at women's rising independence.\" Their theory is comparable to Jonathan Haidt's [[Social intuitionism|social intuition theory]], where individuals justify their intuitive emotions and actions through reasoning in a post-hoc fashion.\n\nKristiansen and Hotte also found that independent selves had actions and behaviors that are influenced by their own thoughts and feelings, but [[Interdependent]] selves have actions, behaviors and self-concepts that were based on the thoughts and feelings of others. Westerners have two dimensions of emotions, activation and pleasantness. The Japanese have one more, the range of their interdependent relationships. Markus and Kitayama found that these two different types of values had different motives. Westerners, in their explanations, show self-bettering biases. Easterners, on the other hand, tend to focus on \"other-oriented\" biases.<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d />\n\nPsychologist [[Shalom H. Schwartz|S. H.

They were interested in placing people into moral categories or stages of development instead of identifying how each individual's views and behaviors are affected by their background and personality. In 2004, D. Lapsley and D. Narvaez outlined how [[social cognition]] explains aspects of moral functioning.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Development, Self, and Identity|last1=Lapsley|first1=Daniel K.|last2=Narvaez|first2=Darcia|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-135-63233-5|location=|pages=189\u2013212|chapter=A social-cognitive approach to the moral personality|ref=harv|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=q054AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189}}</ref> The social cognitive approach to personality has six critical resources of moral personality: cognition, self-processes, affective elements of personality, changing social context, lawful situational variability, and the integration of other literature. Lapsley and Narvaez suggest that moral values and actions stem from more than our virtues and are controlled by a set of self-created [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] (cognitive structures that organize related concepts and integrate past events). They claim that schemas are \"fundamental to our very ability to notice dilemmas as we appraise the moral landscape\" and that over time, people develop greater \"moral expertise\".{{Sfn|Lapsley|Narvaez|2004|p=197}}\n\n==== Triune ethics theory ====\n{{Main|Triune ethics Meta-theory}}\nThe triune ethics meta-theory (TEM) has been proposed by Darcia Narvaez as a [[metatheory]] that highlights the relative contributions to moral development of [[biological inheritance]] (including human evolutionary [[adaptations]]), environmental influences on neurobiology, and the role of culture.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal|last=Narvaez|first=Darcia|date=March 1, 2008|title=Triune ethics: The neurobiological roots of our multiple moralities|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~dnarvaez/TriuneEthicsWord.htm|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|volume=26|issue=1|pages=95\u2013119|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2007.07.008|issn=0732-118X|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.152.4926}}</ref> TET proposes three basic mindsets that shape ethical behavior: self-protectionism (a variety of types), engagement, and imagination (a variety of types that are fueld by protectionism or engagement).

He focused on moral development as one's progression in the capacity to reason about justice. Kohlberg's interview method included hypothetical moral dilemmas or conflicts of interest (most notably, the [[Heinz dilemma]]). He proposed six stages and three levels of development (claiming that \"anyone who interviewed children about dilemmas and who followed them longitudinally in time would come to our six stages and no others).<ref>{{cite book|title=The Psychology of Moral Development: The Nature and Validity of Moral Stages|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1984|isbn=978-0-06-064761-2|series=Essays on Moral Developent|volume=2|location=|pages=195}}</ref> At the Preconventional level, the first two stages included the punishment-and-obedience orientation and the instrumental-relativist orientation.

The justice perspective draws attention to inequality and oppression, while striving for reciprocal rights and equal respect for all. The care perspective draws attention to the ideas of detachment and abandonment, while striving for attention and response to people who need it. Care Orientation is relationally based.

According to this approach, through early interactions with the caregiver, the child acquires an internal representation of a system of rules that determine how right/wrong judgments are to be construed, used, and understood.

In fact, it seems to be more common for people to label their behaviors with a justifying value rather than having a value beforehand and then acting on it. There are some people that are more likely to act on their personal values: those low in self-monitoring and high in self-consciousness, due to the fact that they are more aware of themselves and less aware of how others may perceive them. Self-consciousness here means being literally more conscious of yourself, not fearing judgement or feeling anxiety from others. Social situations and the different categories of norms can be telling of when people may act in accordance with their values, but this still isn't concrete either. People will typically act in accordance with social, contextual and personal norms, and there is a likelihood that these norms can also follow one's moral values. Though there are certain assumptions and situations that would suggest a major value-attitude-behavior relation, there is not enough research to confirm this phenomenon.\n\n====Moral willpower====\n{{Main|Ego depletion|Self-control}}\n{{See also|Delayed gratification|Social cognitive theory of morality}}\nBuilding on earlier work by Metcalfe and [[Walter Mischel#Self-control|Mischel]] on delayed gratification,<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=Metcalfe|first1=J.|last2=Mischel|first2=W.|year=1999|title=A hot/cool-system analysis of delay of gratification: Dynamics of willpower|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13101564|journal=Psychological Review|volume=106|issue=1|pages=3\u201319|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.1.3|pmid=10197361|via=}}</ref> Baumeister, Miller, and Delaney explored the notion of willpower by first defining the self as being made up of three parts: reflexive consciousness, or the person's awareness of their environment and of himself as an individual; interpersonal being, which seeks to mold the self into one that will be accepted by others; and executive function.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite book|title=Judeo-Christian Perspectives on Psychology: Human Nature, Motivation, and Change|last=Baumeister|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59147-161-5|editor-last=Miller|editor-first=William|location=Washington, DC|pages=57\u201372|chapter=Self and volition|ref=harv|editor-last2=Delaney|editor-first2=Harold}}</ref> They stated, \"[T]he self can free its actions from being determined by particular influences, especially those of which it is aware\".{{Sfn|Baumeister|2005|p=68}} The three prevalent theories of willpower describe it as a limited supply of energy, as a cognitive process, and as a skill that is developed over time.

Moral intuitions happen immediately, automatically, and [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]], with reasoning largely serving to generate post-hoc rationalizations to justify one's instinctual reactions.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\">{{cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|date=October 2001|title=The Emotional Dog and Its Rational Tail|url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/reasoning_adler_rips.pdf#page=1036|journal=Psychological Review|volume=108|issue=4|pages=814\u2013834|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.4.814|pmid=11699120|ref=harv|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.620.5536}}</ref> He provides four arguments to doubt causal importance of reason. Firstly, Haidt argues that since there is a [[Dual process theory|dual process system]] in the brain when making automatic evaluations or assessments, this same process must be applicable to moral judgement as well. The second argument, based on research on [[motivated reasoning]], claims that people behave like \"intuitive lawyers\", searching primarily for evidence that will serve motives for social relatedness and attitudinal coherence. Thirdly, Haidt found that people have post hoc reasoning when faced with a moral situation, this a posteriori (after the fact) explanation gives the illusion of objective moral judgement but in reality is subjective to one's gut feeling. Lastly, research has shown that moral emotion has a stronger link to moral action than moral reasoning, citing Damasio's research on the [[somatic marker hypothesis]] and Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\" />\n\nIn 2008, Joshua Greene published a compilation which, in contrast to Haidt's model, suggested that fair moral reasoning does take place. A \"[[Deontological ethics|deontologist]]\" is someone who has rule-based morality that is mainly focused on duties and rights; in contrast, a \"[[Consequentialism|consequentialist]]\" is someone who believes that only the best overall consequences ultimately matter.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Psychology|last=Greene|first=Joshua|publisher=MIT Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-262-69355-4|editor-last=Sinnott-Armstrong|editor-first=Walter|volume=3|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=35\u201380|chapter=The secret joke of Kant\u2019s Soul|oclc=750463100}}</ref> Generally speaking, individuals who answer to moral dilemmas in a consequential manner take longer to respond and show [[Frontal lobe|frontal-lobe]] activity (associated with cognitive processing).

These Five Foundations of Morality and their importance vary throughout each culture and construct virtues based on their emphasized foundation. \nThey challenged individuals to question the legitimacy of their moral world and introduced the five psychological foundations of morality:\n* Harm/care, which starts with the sensitivity to signs of suffering in offspring and develops into a general dislike of seeing suffering in others and the potential to feel compassion in response.\n* Fairness/reciprocity, which is developed when someone observes or engages in reciprocal interactions. This foundation is concerned with virtues related to fairness and justice. \n* Ingroup/loyalty, which constitutes recognizing, trusting, and cooperating with members of one's ingroup as well as being wary of members of other groups.\n* Authority/respect, which is how someone navigates in a [[Hierarchical equations of motion|hierarchal]] ingroups and communities.\n* Purity/sanctity, which stems from the emotion of disgust that guards the body by responding to elicitors that are biologically or culturally linked to disease transmission.\nThe five foundations theory are both a [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] and cultural-psychological theory. Modern moral psychology concedes that \"morality is about protecting individuals\" and focuses primarily on issues of justice (harm/care and fairness/reciprocity).<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\" />{{rp|page=99}} Their research found that \"justice and related virtues\u2026make up half of the moral world for liberals, while justice-related concerns make up only one fifth of the moral world for conservatives\".<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\" />{{rp|page=99}} Liberals value harm/care and fairness/reciprocity significantly more than the other moralities, while conservatives value all five equally.\n\n===Moral emotions===\n{{Main|Moral emotions}}\n{{See also|Social emotions}}\nMoral emotions are a variety of social emotion that are involved in forming and communicating moral judgments and decisions, and in motivating behavioral responses to one's own and others' moral behavior.<ref name=\"Pizarro2007b\">{{cite book |last1=Pizarro |first1=David A. |editor1-last=Baumeister |editor1-first=Roy F |editor2-last=Vohs |editor2-first=Kathleen D |title=Encyclopedia of Social Psychology |date=2007 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |isbn=9781412956253 |pages=588\u2013589 |chapter=Moral Emotions|doi=10.4135/9781412956253.n350 }}</ref><ref name=\"Haidt, J. 2003 p. 855\">{{cite book|title=Handbook of Affective Sciences|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-512601-3|editor-last=Davidson|editor-first=Richard|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofaffect0000unse/page/855 855]|chapter=The Moral Emotions|ref=harv|editor-last2=Scherer|editor-first2=Klaus|editor-last3=Goldsmith|editor-first3=H.|chapter-url=http://www.gruberpeplab.com/teaching/psych3131_spring2015/documents/4.1_Haidt2003_Moralemotions.pdf|url=https://archive.org/details/handbookofaffect0000unse/page/855}}</ref><ref name=\"Tangney2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Tangney |first1=June Price |last2=Stuewig |first2=Jeff |last3=Mashek |first3=Debra J. |title=Moral Emotions and Moral Behavior |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |date=January 2007 |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=345\u2013372 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145 |pmid=16953797 |pmc=3083636 |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~squartz/Tangney.pdf}}</ref>\nWhile moral reasoning has been the focus of most study of morality dating all the way back to Plato and Aristotle, the emotive side of morality has been looked upon with disdain.<ref name=\"Pizarro2007b\" /> However, in the last 30\u201340 years, there has been a rise in a new front of research: moral emotions as the basis for moral behavior.

Namely, moral mandates derive their motivational force from their perceived universality, perceived objectivity, and strong ties to emotion.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Peace Psychology|last=Morgan|first=G.

J.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-9644-4|editor=Christie|editor-first=Daniel J.|location=|pages=|chapter=Moral conviction}}</ref> Perceived universality refers to the notion that individuals experience moral mandates as transcending persons and cultures; additionally, they are regarded as matters of fact. Regarding association with emotion, ITMC is consistent with Jonathan Haidt's social intuitionist model in stating that moral judgments are accompanied by discrete moral emotions (i.e., disgust, shame, guilt). Importantly, Skitka maintains that moral mandates are not the same thing as moral values. Whether an issue will be associated with moral conviction varies across persons.\n\nOne of the main lines of IMTC research addresses the behavioral implications of moral mandates. Individuals prefer greater social and physical distance from attitudinally dissimilar others when moral conviction was high. This effect of moral conviction could not be explained by traditional measures of attitude strength, extremity, or centrality. Skitka, Bauman, and Sargis placed participants in either attitudinally heterogeneous or homogenous groups to discuss procedures regarding two morally mandated issues, [[abortion]] and [[capital punishment]]. Those in attitudinally heterogeneous groups demonstrated the least amount of goodwill towards other group members, the least amount of cooperation, and the most tension/defensiveness. Furthermore, individuals discussing a morally mandated issue were less likely to reach a consensus compared to those discussing non-moral issues.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skitka|first=L.

The intention was to learn more about moral exemplars and to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the Kohlberg measure. They found that the MJI scores were not clustered at the high end of Kohlberg's scale, they ranged from stage 3 to stage 5. Half landed at the conventional level (stages 3, 3/4, and 4) and the other half landed at the postconventional level (stages 4/5 and 5). Compared to the general population, the scores of the moral exemplars may be somewhat higher than those of groups not selected for outstanding moral behaviour. Researchers noted that the \"moral judgement scores are clearly related to subjects' educational attainment in this study\". Among the participants that had attained college education or above, there was no difference in moral judgement scores between genders. The study noted that although the exemplars' scores may have been higher than those of nonexemplars, it is also clear that one is not required to score at Kohlberg's highest stages in order to exhibit high degrees of moral commitment and exemplary behaviour.<ref name=\":2\" /> Apart from their scores, it was found that the 23 participating moral exemplars described three similar themes within all of their moral developments: certainty, positivity, and the unity of self and moral goals. The unity between self and moral goals was highlighted as the most important theme as it is what truly sets the exemplars apart from the 'ordinary' people. It was discovered that the moral exemplars see their morality as a part of their sense of identity and sense of self, not as a conscious choice or chore. Also, the moral exemplars showed a much broader range of moral concern than did the ordinary people and go beyond the normal acts of daily moral engagements.\n\nRather than confirm the existence of a single highest stage, Larry Walker's [[cluster analysis]] of a wide variety of interview and survey variables for moral exemplars found three types: the \"caring\" or \"communal\" cluster was strongly relational and generative, the \"deliberative\" cluster had sophisticated [[epistemic]] and moral reasoning, and the \"brave\" or \"ordinary\" cluster was less distinguished by personality.<ref name=\"Walker2010\">{{cite journal | last=Walker | first=Lawrence J. | last2=Frimer | first2=Jeremy A. | last3=Dunlop | first3=William L. | title=Varieties of moral personality: beyond the banality of heroism | journal=Journal of Personality | volume=78 | year=2010 | pages=907\u2013942 | issue=3| pmid=20573130 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00637.x}}</ref>\n\n===Survey instruments===\nBetween 1910 and 1930, in the United States and Europe, several morality tests were developed to classify subjects as fit or unfit to make moral judgments.<ref name=Wendorf2001/><ref name=\"Verplaetse2008\">{{cite journal | last=Verplaetse | first=Jan | title=Measuring the moral sense: morality tests in continental Europe between 1910 and 1930 | journal= Paedagogica Historica | volume=44 | issue=3 | year=2008 | pages=265\u2013286 | doi=10.1080/00309230701722721}}</ref> Test-takers would classify or rank standardized lists of personality traits, hypothetical actions, or pictures of hypothetical scenes.

Scholars, such as Blasi, began proposing identity as a motivating factor in moral motivation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Augusto|date=1980|title=Bridging moral cognition and moral action: A critical review of the literature.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=88|issue=1|pages=1\u201345|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.88.1.1|issn=0033-2909}}</ref> Blasi proposed the self model of moral functioning, which described the effects of the judgment of responsibility to perform a moral action, one's sense of moral identity, and the desire for self-consistency on moral action. Blasi also elaborates on the structure of identity and its connection to morality.  According to Blasi, there are two aspects that form identity. One of the aspects focuses on the specific contents that make up the self (objective identity content), which include moral ideals. The second refers to the ways in which identity is subjectively experienced (subjective identity experience). As the subjective side of identity matures, the objective side tends to lean towards internal contents like values, beliefs, and goals, rather than external identity contents like physical aspects, behaviors, and relationships. A mature subjective identity yearns for a greater sense of self-consistency. Therefore, identity would serve as a motivation for moral action. \nStudies of moral exemplars have shown that exemplary moral action often results from the intertwining of personal goals and desires with moral goals, and studies on moral behavior also show a correlation between moral identity and action. S. Hardy and G. Carlo raise critical questions about Blasi's model as well, and propose that researchers should seek to better operationalize and measure moral identity and apply findings to moral education and intervention programs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hardy | first1 = S.

This unity of their self and morality is what distinguishes them from non-exemplars and in turn makes them exceptional.<ref>{{cite book|title=Morality in Everyday Life: Developmental Perspectives|last1=Colby|first1=Anne|last2=Damon|first2=William|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-521-66586-5|editor-last=Killen|editor-first=Melanie|location=|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA362 362]|chapter=The Development of Extraordinary Moral Commitment|editor-last2=Hart|editor-first2=Daniel|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA342}}</ref> Colby and Damon studied moral identity through the narratives of civil rights activist [[Virginia Foster Durr]] and Suzie Valadez, who provided services for the poor, whose behavior, actions, and life's works were considered to be morally exemplary by their communities and those with whom they came in contact. Some common characteristics that these moral exemplars possess are certainty, positivity (e.g. enjoyment of work, and optimism), and unity of self and moral goals.{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA361 361\u2013362]}} The research suggests that a \"transformation of goals\" takes place during the evolution of one's moral identity and development and therefore is not an exercise of self-sacrifice but rather one done with great joy; moral exemplars see their personal goals and moral goals as synonymous. This transformation is not always a deliberate process and is most often a gradual process, but can also be rapidly set off by a triggering event.{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=354}} Triggering events can be anything from a powerful moment in a movie to a [[Trauma (psychology)|traumatic life event]], or as in the case of Suzie Valadez, the perception of a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision from God]]. In many of the moral exemplars interviewed, the triggering events and goal transformation did not take place until their 40s. Moral exemplars are said to have the same concerns and commitments as other moral people but to a greater degree, \"extensions in scope, intensity and breadth\".{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA364 364]}} Furthermore, exemplars possess the ability to be open to new ideas and experiences, also known as an \"active receptiveness\"{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=350}} to things exterior to themselves.\n\nDaniel Hart conducted a study to see how adolescents who engaged in exemplary levels of prosocial behavior viewed themselves. To empirically study self-concept, he used four different conceptual models to illustrate the concept of self: Self-Concept as Content, Self-Concept as Semantic Space, Self-Concept as Hierarchy of Selves, and Self-Concept as Theory. The findings suggested that adolescent caring exemplars formulated their self-concept differently from comparable peers. In a hierarchy of selves model, exemplars were shown to incorporate their \"ideal self\" into their \"actual self\". Among the exemplar group there was more incorporation of parental representations with the \"actual self\". Conversely, there was less incorporation of representations of their best friend or the self-expected by the best friend. It is theorized that this is because adolescents are less likely to pick a best friend who is a \"goody-goody\" and deeply involved in service, as well as exemplars possibly having to give up peer expectations in order to engage in service. In a Self-Concept as Theory model, exemplars were most commonly at level 4, a level of self-theory uncommonly reached by adolescents, but common among exemplars. They were also more likely to emphasize academic goals and moral typical activities. There were no significant differences between the exemplars and the control group concerning moral knowledge. On a [[semantic space]] analysis, the moral exemplars tended to view their actual self as more integrated with their ideal and expected self.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=D.|last2=Fegley|first2=S.|year=1995|title=Prosocial behavior and caring in adolescence: Relations to self-understanding and social judgment|url=http://www.uca.edu.ar/uca/common/grupo18/files/hartfegley1995CD.pdf|journal=Child Development|volume=66|issue=5|pages=1346\u20131359|doi=10.2307/1131651|pmid=7555220|via=|jstor=1131651}}</ref>\n\n[[David Wong (philosopher)|David Wong]] proposes that we think of cultures in an analogy to a conversation, there are people with different beliefs, values, and norms that can voice their opinion loudly or quietly, but over the course of time these factors can change. A moral culture can provide other members with a kind of \"language\" where there is plenty of room for different \"dialects\", this allows moral identities to be established and voiced more. Opposing ideas can create conflict between those who are close to us, such as family and friends, and strangers. This can bring a greater risk of trying to decide the best course of action in which either party will be affected by it. In essence the notion of Wong's theory is that in order to define our true morality it ultimately comes down to acceptance and being able to accommodate within and between cultures around the world. He also believes that the concept of culture as conversation will help reduce the problems with boundaries between cultures, reconcile the autonomy with the cultural aspect of moral identity and call into question the understanding of healthy and well developed moral identity.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Narvaez |first1=Darcia |last2=Lapsley |first2=Daniel K. |title=Personality, Identity, and Character: Explorations in Moral Psychology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-521-89507-1 |pages=79\u2013105 |chapter=Chapter 4}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Blasi's theory on [[moral character]], moral character is identified by the person's set of the morality of virtues and vices. He theorized [[Volition (psychology)|willpower]], moral desires, and integrity have the capability for a person to act morally by the hierarchical order of virtues. He believed that the \"highest\" and complex of virtues are expressed by willpower while the \"lowest\" and simplistic of virtues are expressed integrity. He essentially stated that to have the lower virtues, one must have one or more of the higher virtues.

With the research they reviewed and their own extension of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]], they conclude that value-attitude-behavior depends on the individual and their moral reasoning. They also pointed out that there are such things as good values and bad values. Good values are those that guide our attitudes and behaviors and allow us to express and define ourselves. It also involves the ability to know when values are appropriate in response to the situation or person that you are dealing with. Bad values on the other hand are those that are relied on so much that it makes you unresponsive to the needs and perspectives of others.\n\nAnother issue that Kristiansen and Hotte discovered through their research was that individuals tended to \"create\" values to justify their reactions to certain situations, which they called the \"value justification hypothesis\".<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d /> The authors use an example from feminist [[Susan Faludi]]'s journal entry of how during the period when women were fighting for their right to vote, a New Rights group appealed to society's ideals of \"traditional family values\" as an argument against the new law in order to mask their own \"anger at women's rising independence.\" Their theory is comparable to Jonathan Haidt's [[Social intuitionism|social intuition theory]], where individuals justify their intuitive emotions and actions through reasoning in a post-hoc fashion.\n\nKristiansen and Hotte also found that independent selves had actions and behaviors that are influenced by their own thoughts and feelings, but [[Interdependent]] selves have actions, behaviors and self-concepts that were based on the thoughts and feelings of others. Westerners have two dimensions of emotions, activation and pleasantness. The Japanese have one more, the range of their interdependent relationships. Markus and Kitayama found that these two different types of values had different motives. Westerners, in their explanations, show self-bettering biases. Easterners, on the other hand, tend to focus on \"other-oriented\" biases.<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d />\n\nPsychologist [[Shalom H. Schwartz|S. H.

They were interested in placing people into moral categories or stages of development instead of identifying how each individual's views and behaviors are affected by their background and personality. In 2004, D. Lapsley and D. Narvaez outlined how [[social cognition]] explains aspects of moral functioning.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Development, Self, and Identity|last1=Lapsley|first1=Daniel K.|last2=Narvaez|first2=Darcia|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-135-63233-5|location=|pages=189\u2013212|chapter=A social-cognitive approach to the moral personality|ref=harv|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=q054AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189}}</ref> The social cognitive approach to personality has six critical resources of moral personality: cognition, self-processes, affective elements of personality, changing social context, lawful situational variability, and the integration of other literature. Lapsley and Narvaez suggest that moral values and actions stem from more than our virtues and are controlled by a set of self-created [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] (cognitive structures that organize related concepts and integrate past events).

He proposed six stages and three levels of development (claiming that \"anyone who interviewed children about dilemmas and who followed them longitudinally in time would come to our six stages and no others).<ref>{{cite book|title=The Psychology of Moral Development: The Nature and Validity of Moral Stages|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1984|isbn=978-0-06-064761-2|series=Essays on Moral Developent|volume=2|location=|pages=195}}</ref> At the Preconventional level, the first two stages included the punishment-and-obedience orientation and the instrumental-relativist orientation.

According to this approach, through early interactions with the caregiver, the child acquires an internal representation of a system of rules that determine how right/wrong judgments are to be construed, used, and understood.

This [[Social intuitionism|social intuitionist]] model of moral motivation<ref>{{harvnb|Leffel|2008}}'s model draws heavily on {{harvnb|Haidt|2001}}'s social intuitionist model of moral judgment.</ref> suggests that moral behaviors are typically the product of multiple levels of moral functioning, and are usually energized by the \"hotter\" levels of intuition, emotion, and behavioral virtue/vice.

In fact, it seems to be more common for people to label their behaviors with a justifying value rather than having a value beforehand and then acting on it. There are some people that are more likely to act on their personal values: those low in self-monitoring and high in self-consciousness, due to the fact that they are more aware of themselves and less aware of how others may perceive them. Self-consciousness here means being literally more conscious of yourself, not fearing judgement or feeling anxiety from others. Social situations and the different categories of norms can be telling of when people may act in accordance with their values, but this still isn't concrete either. People will typically act in accordance with social, contextual and personal norms, and there is a likelihood that these norms can also follow one's moral values. Though there are certain assumptions and situations that would suggest a major value-attitude-behavior relation, there is not enough research to confirm this phenomenon.\n\n====Moral willpower====\n{{Main|Ego depletion|Self-control}}\n{{See also|Delayed gratification|Social cognitive theory of morality}}\nBuilding on earlier work by Metcalfe and [[Walter Mischel#Self-control|Mischel]] on delayed gratification,<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=Metcalfe|first1=J.|last2=Mischel|first2=W.|year=1999|title=A hot/cool-system analysis of delay of gratification: Dynamics of willpower|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13101564|journal=Psychological Review|volume=106|issue=1|pages=3\u201319|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.1.3|pmid=10197361|via=}}</ref> Baumeister, Miller, and Delaney explored the notion of willpower by first defining the self as being made up of three parts: reflexive consciousness, or the person's awareness of their environment and of himself as an individual; interpersonal being, which seeks to mold the self into one that will be accepted by others; and executive function.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite book|title=Judeo-Christian Perspectives on Psychology: Human Nature, Motivation, and Change|last=Baumeister|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59147-161-5|editor-last=Miller|editor-first=William|location=Washington, DC|pages=57\u201372|chapter=Self and volition|ref=harv|editor-last2=Delaney|editor-first2=Harold}}</ref> They stated, \"[T]he self can free its actions from being determined by particular influences, especially those of which it is aware\".{{Sfn|Baumeister|2005|p=68}} The three prevalent theories of willpower describe it as a limited supply of energy, as a cognitive process, and as a skill that is developed over time.

Moral intuitions happen immediately, automatically, and [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]], with reasoning largely serving to generate post-hoc rationalizations to justify one's instinctual reactions.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\">{{cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|date=October 2001|title=The Emotional Dog and Its Rational Tail|url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/reasoning_adler_rips.pdf#page=1036|journal=Psychological Review|volume=108|issue=4|pages=814\u2013834|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.4.814|pmid=11699120|ref=harv|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.620.5536}}</ref> He provides four arguments to doubt causal importance of reason. Firstly, Haidt argues that since there is a [[Dual process theory|dual process system]] in the brain when making automatic evaluations or assessments, this same process must be applicable to moral judgement as well. The second argument, based on research on [[motivated reasoning]], claims that people behave like \"intuitive lawyers\", searching primarily for evidence that will serve motives for social relatedness and attitudinal coherence. Thirdly, Haidt found that people have post hoc reasoning when faced with a moral situation, this a posteriori (after the fact) explanation gives the illusion of objective moral judgement but in reality is subjective to one's gut feeling. Lastly, research has shown that moral emotion has a stronger link to moral action than moral reasoning, citing Damasio's research on the [[somatic marker hypothesis]] and Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\" />\n\nIn 2008, Joshua Greene published a compilation which, in contrast to Haidt's model, suggested that fair moral reasoning does take place. A \"[[Deontological ethics|deontologist]]\" is someone who has rule-based morality that is mainly focused on duties and rights; in contrast, a \"[[Consequentialism|consequentialist]]\" is someone who believes that only the best overall consequences ultimately matter.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Psychology|last=Greene|first=Joshua|publisher=MIT Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-262-69355-4|editor-last=Sinnott-Armstrong|editor-first=Walter|volume=3|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=35\u201380|chapter=The secret joke of Kant\u2019s Soul|oclc=750463100}}</ref> Generally speaking, individuals who answer to moral dilemmas in a consequential manner take longer to respond and show [[Frontal lobe|frontal-lobe]] activity (associated with cognitive processing).

These Five Foundations of Morality and their importance vary throughout each culture and construct virtues based on their emphasized foundation. \nThey challenged individuals to question the legitimacy of their moral world and introduced the five psychological foundations of morality:\n* Harm/care, which starts with the sensitivity to signs of suffering in offspring and develops into a general dislike of seeing suffering in others and the potential to feel compassion in response.\n* Fairness/reciprocity, which is developed when someone observes or engages in reciprocal interactions. This foundation is concerned with virtues related to fairness and justice. \n* Ingroup/loyalty, which constitutes recognizing, trusting, and cooperating with members of one's ingroup as well as being wary of members of other groups.\n* Authority/respect, which is how someone navigates in a [[Hierarchical equations of motion|hierarchal]] ingroups and communities.\n* Purity/sanctity, which stems from the emotion of disgust that guards the body by responding to elicitors that are biologically or culturally linked to disease transmission.\nThe five foundations theory are both a [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] and cultural-psychological theory. Modern moral psychology concedes that \"morality is about protecting individuals\" and focuses primarily on issues of justice (harm/care and fairness/reciprocity).<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\" />{{rp|page=99}} Their research found that \"justice and related virtues\u2026make up half of the moral world for liberals, while justice-related concerns make up only one fifth of the moral world for conservatives\".<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\" />{{rp|page=99}} Liberals value harm/care and fairness/reciprocity significantly more than the other moralities, while conservatives value all five equally.\n\n===Moral emotions===\n{{Main|Moral emotions}}\n{{See also|Social emotions}}\nMoral emotions are a variety of social emotion that are involved in forming and communicating moral judgments and decisions, and in motivating behavioral responses to one's own and others' moral behavior.<ref name=\"Pizarro2007b\">{{cite book |last1=Pizarro |first1=David A. |editor1-last=Baumeister |editor1-first=Roy F |editor2-last=Vohs |editor2-first=Kathleen D |title=Encyclopedia of Social Psychology |date=2007 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |isbn=9781412956253 |pages=588\u2013589 |chapter=Moral Emotions|doi=10.4135/9781412956253.n350 }}</ref><ref name=\"Haidt, J. 2003 p. 855\">{{cite book|title=Handbook of Affective Sciences|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-512601-3|editor-last=Davidson|editor-first=Richard|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofaffect0000unse/page/855 855]|chapter=The Moral Emotions|ref=harv|editor-last2=Scherer|editor-first2=Klaus|editor-last3=Goldsmith|editor-first3=H.|chapter-url=http://www.gruberpeplab.com/teaching/psych3131_spring2015/documents/4.1_Haidt2003_Moralemotions.pdf|url=https://archive.org/details/handbookofaffect0000unse/page/855}}</ref><ref name=\"Tangney2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Tangney |first1=June Price |last2=Stuewig |first2=Jeff |last3=Mashek |first3=Debra J. |title=Moral Emotions and Moral Behavior |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |date=January 2007 |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=345\u2013372 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145 |pmid=16953797 |pmc=3083636 |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~squartz/Tangney.pdf}}</ref>\nWhile moral reasoning has been the focus of most study of morality dating all the way back to Plato and Aristotle, the emotive side of morality has been looked upon with disdain.<ref name=\"Pizarro2007b\" /> However, in the last 30\u201340 years, there has been a rise in a new front of research: moral emotions as the basis for moral behavior.

Namely, moral mandates derive their motivational force from their perceived universality, perceived objectivity, and strong ties to emotion.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Peace Psychology|last=Morgan|first=G. S.|last2=Skitka|first2=L. J.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-9644-4|editor=Christie|editor-first=Daniel J.|location=|pages=|chapter=Moral conviction}}</ref> Perceived universality refers to the notion that individuals experience moral mandates as transcending persons and cultures; additionally, they are regarded as matters of fact. Regarding association with emotion, ITMC is consistent with Jonathan Haidt's social intuitionist model in stating that moral judgments are accompanied by discrete moral emotions (i.e., disgust, shame, guilt). Importantly, Skitka maintains that moral mandates are not the same thing as moral values. Whether an issue will be associated with moral conviction varies across persons.\n\nOne of the main lines of IMTC research addresses the behavioral implications of moral mandates. Individuals prefer greater social and physical distance from attitudinally dissimilar others when moral conviction was high. This effect of moral conviction could not be explained by traditional measures of attitude strength, extremity, or centrality. Skitka, Bauman, and Sargis placed participants in either attitudinally heterogeneous or homogenous groups to discuss procedures regarding two morally mandated issues, [[abortion]] and [[capital punishment]]. Those in attitudinally heterogeneous groups demonstrated the least amount of goodwill towards other group members, the least amount of cooperation, and the most tension/defensiveness. Furthermore, individuals discussing a morally mandated issue were less likely to reach a consensus compared to those discussing non-moral issues.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skitka|first=L.

He is the adoptive father of Margo, Edith, and Agnes, husband of Lucy, and the boss of the Minions. At the beginning of the [[Despicable Me|original film]], Gru is an ambitious supervillain, and seeks approval from his mother, until the adoption of the trio convinces him that their happiness is important. In the [[Despicable Me 2|second film]], Gru leaves his villainous past behind to care for the girls, but then soon joins forces - unwillingly - with secret agent Lucy Wilde, whom he later marries. In the [[Despicable Me 3|third film]], after he and Lucy are fired from their jobs at the Anti-Villain League, Gru learns that he has a twin brother, Dru. Along with Lucy and the girls, Gru meets Dru at his mansion in Freedonia, and they form a brotherly relationship over the course of the film. Felonious Gru was originally conceived as a [[Count Dracula|Dracula]]-like character, but directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin later opted for a villain who would echo \"the world of [[James Bond]], thinking of characters like [[Auric Goldfinger|Goldfinger]] and obviously the Bond-ian world of technology\".<ref>[http://www.cartoonbrew.com/award-season-focus/directors-chris-renaud-and-pierre-coffin-on-creative-choices-and-challenges-in-despicable-me-films-93702.html Directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin on Creative Choices and Challenges in \u201cDespicable Me\u201d Films], cartoonbrew.com, 1 October 2014, C.

In the first film, among the trio, Margo was the most suspicious of Gru initially; but came to trust him at the end of the film. She is something of a protectress to her sisters.\n** Edith (voiced by [[Dana Gaier]]): The [[tomboy]]ish middle sister; the first to enjoy Gru's eclectic possessions, when adopted by him. Practices [[martial arts]] in the second film.\n** Agnes (voiced by [[Elsie Fisher]] in the first two films; Nev Scharrel in the third film): The happy-go-lucky youngest sister, and the quickest to trust Gru in the first film. She is presented as an innocent, against her more worldly sisters, and has a strong love for unicorns. In the third film, she \"adopts\" a one-horned goat whom she names Lucky after mistaking him for a unicorn. Even after learning he was a goat, Agnes continues to love Lucky.\n* Lucy Wilde (voiced by [[Kristen Wiig]]): A cunning secret agent who has teamed up with Gru to hunt down an extremely dangerous super-villain. She loves one-upping Gru with her quirky gadgets and has perfected her own form of martial arts by combining [[jujitsu]], [[krav maga]], [[Aztec warfare]] and [[krumping]]. After 147 dates, she marries Gru and becomes the girls' mother.\n* Dr. Nefario (voiced by [[Russell Brand]], JB Blanc in the video game): Gru's hearing-impaired inventor and partner-in-crime who speaks with a British accent. He seems to have a romantic interest in Gru's mother, Marlena. He is planned to join Gru, Lucy and the Girls to meet Dru in the third film, but absent from the film having accidentally frozen himself in carbonite, similar to that of [[Han Solo]] from ''[[Star Wars]]''.\n* Dru (voiced by Steve Carell): Gru's charming, happy-go-lucky long-lost twin brother, who is also in the super-villain business. Dru looks just like his brother, only he has blonde hair and wears white attire. He is Lucy's brother-in-law and the adoptive uncle of Margo, Edith, and Agnes.\n* Marlena (voiced by [[Julie Andrews]]): Gru and Dru's mother. Her neglect of Gru's ambitions is identified among the main reasons why he became a supervillain. In the denouement of the first film, she admits to him that he is a better parent than she. Marlena later makes a silent cameo appearance in the second film at Gru and Lucy's wedding. In the third film, Marlena reveals to Gru that after she and Gru and Dru's father divorced, they promised to never see each other again and they each got to take one son with them, with Marlena saying that she got \"second pick\".\n* Fritz (voiced by [[Steve Coogan]]): Dru's courteous, well mannered butler who speaks with a British accent. He takes Gru, Lucy, and the girls to meet Dru at his mansion in Freedonia.\n* Silas Ramsbottom (voiced by [[Steve Coogan]]): Director of the Anti-Villain League in the second film. The Minions (and Gru) make fun of his surname. In the third film, he retires from the AVL and is replaced by Valerie Da Vinci as the new Director of the AVL.\n* Valerie Da Vinci (voiced by [[Jenny Slate]]): A ruthless member of the Anti-Villain League who replaces Silas Ramsbottom as Director in the third film. She fires Gru and Lucy due to them failing to capture Balthazar Bratt, but rehires them in the end for capturing Bratt and returning the diamond, though it was not seen, but Gru imagines her rehiring him along with Lucy.\n\n===Antagonists===\n* Victor \"Vector\" Perkins (voiced by [[Jason Segel]], Jason Harris in the video game): In the first film, Gru's rival, and the son of Mr. Perkins, the President of the Bank of Evil that supplies loans to villains in their schemes (formerly including Gru). \n* Mr. Perkins (voiced by [[Will Arnett]]): The enormous and equally strong President of the Bank of Evil, responsible for giving out loans to villains in their schemes.\n* Miss Hattie (voiced by [[Kristen Wiig]]): The charismatic but cruel owner of the orphanage from which Gru adopts his daughters. She sends Margo, Edith, and Agnes out to sell cookies and makes them sleep in cardboard boxes if they fail to meet their quota.\n* Eduardo \"El Macho\" Perez (voiced by [[Benjamin Bratt]]): A Mexican-accented supervillain in the second film. As El Macho, he was believed to have died after strapping 250 pounds of TNT on himself and riding a shark into an active volcano. However, it turns out that he actually faked his death, and he became the owner of a Mexican restaurant. He has a son named Antonio, with whom Margo is infatuated at first, until Antonio abandons her. It turns out that Eduardo was aware of Gru's life as a villain and plans to abduct  most of Gru's minions and turn them into hairy, purple, savage, evil minions with a dangerous chemical compound he stole called PX-41 and send the mutated Minions to major cities to take over the world. In the final battle, as Gru manages to restore the mutated Minions to normal, Eduardo drinks the compound himself, turning into a big purple furry monster to fight Gru. He is defeated by Gru and Nefario.\n* Balthazar Bratt (voiced by [[Trey Parker]]): A supervillain in the [[Despicable Me 3|third film]]. A former 1980s child star, he adopts the identity of his supervillain character after the onset of puberty leads to the cancellation of his television series. He is obsessed with 1980s pop culture and uses a giant robot armed with a laser and inflatable bubble gum to exact revenge on Hollywood.\n* Clive (voiced by [[Andy Nyman]]): a robot who acts as Balthazar Bratt's sidekick.\n* Scarlet Overkill (voiced by [[Sandra Bullock]]): In ''[[Minions (film)|Minions]]'', she is the world's first female super-villain who is bent on world domination.\n* Herb Overkill (voiced by [[Jon Hamm]]): Scarlet's husband and an inventor.\n\n==Chronology==\n* <small>''[[#Cro Minion (2015)|Cro Minion]]'' (2015)</small>\n* '''''[[Minions (film)|Minions]]''''' (2015)\n* <small>''[[#Binky Nelson Unpacified (2015)|Binky Nelson Unpacified]]'' (2015)</small>\n* <small>''[[#Competition (2015)|Competition]]'' (2015)</small>\n* <small>''[[#Orientation Day (2010)|Orientation Day]]'' (2010)</small>\n* '''''[[Despicable Me]]''''' (2010)\n* <small>''[[#Home Makeover (2010)|Home Makeover]]'' (2010)</small>\n* <small>''[[#Banana (2010)|Banana]]'' (2010)</small>\n* <small>''[[Despicable Me Minion Mayhem]]'' (2012)</small>\n* <small>''[[#Puppy (2013)|Puppy]]'' (2013)</small>\n* <small>''[[#Training Wheels (2013)|Training Wheels]]'' (2013)</small>\n* '''''[[Despicable Me 2]]''''' (2013)\n* <small>''[[#Panic in the Mailroom (2013)|Panic in the Mailroom]]'' (2013)</small>\n* <small>''[[#Mower Minions (2016)|Mower Minions]]'' (2016)</small>\n* '''''[[Despicable Me 3]]''''' (2017)\n* <small>''[[#The Secret Life of Kyle|The Secret Life of Kyle]]'' (2017)</small>\n* <small>''[[#Yellow is the New Black (2018)|Yellow is the New Black]]'' (2018)</small>\n* <small>''[[#Minion Scouts (2019)|Minion Scouts]]'' (2019)</small>\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:10%;\"| Characters\n! colspan=\"3\" | Main films\n!

He is the adoptive father of Margo, Edith, and Agnes, husband of Lucy, and the boss of the Minions. At the beginning of the [[Despicable Me|original film]], Gru is an ambitious supervillain, and seeks approval from his mother, until the adoption of the trio convinces him that their happiness is important. In the [[Despicable Me 2|second film]], Gru leaves his villainous past behind to care for the girls, but then soon joins forces - unwillingly - with secret agent Lucy Wilde, whom he later marries. In the [[Despicable Me 3|third film]], after he and Lucy are fired from their jobs at the Anti-Villain League, Gru learns that he has a twin brother, Dru. Along with Lucy and the girls, Gru meets Dru at his mansion in Freedonia, and they form a brotherly relationship over the course of the film. Felonious Gru was originally conceived as a [[Count Dracula|Dracula]]-like character, but directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin later opted for a villain who would echo \"the world of [[James Bond]], thinking of characters like [[Auric Goldfinger|Goldfinger]] and obviously the Bond-ian world of technology\".<ref>[http://www.cartoonbrew.com/award-season-focus/directors-chris-renaud-and-pierre-coffin-on-creative-choices-and-challenges-in-despicable-me-films-93702.html Directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin on Creative Choices and Challenges in \u201cDespicable Me\u201d Films], cartoonbrew.com, 1 October 2014, C.

He is Lucy's brother-in-law and the adoptive uncle of Margo, Edith, and Agnes.\n* Marlena (voiced by [[Julie Andrews]]): Gru and Dru's mother. Her neglect of Gru's ambitions is identified among the main reasons why he became a supervillain. In the denouement of the first film, she admits to him that he is a better parent than she. Marlena later makes a silent cameo appearance in the second film at Gru and Lucy's wedding. In the third film, Marlena reveals to Gru that after she and Gru and Dru's father divorced, they promised to never see each other again and they each got to take one son with them, with Marlena saying that she got \"second pick\".\n* Fritz (voiced by [[Steve Coogan]]): Dru's courteous, well mannered butler who speaks with a British accent. He takes Gru, Lucy, and the girls to meet Dru at his mansion in Freedonia.\n* Silas Ramsbottom (voiced by [[Steve Coogan]]): Director of the Anti-Villain League in the second film. The Minions (and Gru) make fun of his surname. In the third film, he retires from the AVL and is replaced by Valerie Da Vinci as the new Director of the AVL.\n* Valerie Da Vinci (voiced by [[Jenny Slate]]): A ruthless member of the Anti-Villain League who replaces Silas Ramsbottom as Director in the third film. She fires Gru and Lucy due to them failing to capture Balthazar Bratt, but rehires them in the end for capturing Bratt and returning the diamond, though it was not seen, but Gru imagines her rehiring him along with Lucy.\n\n===Antagonists===\n* Victor \"Vector\" Perkins (voiced by [[Jason Segel]], Jason Harris in the video game): In the first film, Gru's rival, and the son of Mr. Perkins, the President of the Bank of Evil that supplies loans to villains in their schemes (formerly including Gru). \n* Mr. Perkins (voiced by [[Will Arnett]]): The enormous and equally strong President of the Bank of Evil, responsible for giving out loans to villains in their schemes.\n* Miss Hattie (voiced by [[Kristen Wiig]]): The charismatic but cruel owner of the orphanage from which Gru adopts his daughters. She sends Margo, Edith, and Agnes out to sell cookies and makes them sleep in cardboard boxes if they fail to meet their quota.\n* Eduardo \"El Macho\" Perez (voiced by [[Benjamin Bratt]]): A Mexican-accented supervillain in the second film. As El Macho, he was believed to have died after strapping 250 pounds of TNT on himself and riding a shark into an active volcano. However, it turns out that he actually faked his death, and he became the owner of a Mexican restaurant. He has a son named Antonio, with whom Margo is infatuated at first, until Antonio abandons her. It turns out that Eduardo was aware of Gru's life as a villain and plans to abduct  most of Gru's minions and turn them into hairy, purple, savage, evil minions with a dangerous chemical compound he stole called PX-41 and send the mutated Minions to major cities to take over the world. In the final battle, as Gru manages to restore the mutated Minions to normal, Eduardo drinks the compound himself, turning into a big purple furry monster to fight Gru. He is defeated by Gru and Nefario.\n* Balthazar Bratt (voiced by [[Trey Parker]]): A supervillain in the [[Despicable Me 3|third film]]. A former 1980s child star, he adopts the identity of his supervillain character after the onset of puberty leads to the cancellation of his television series. He is obsessed with 1980s pop culture and uses a giant robot armed with a laser and inflatable bubble gum to exact revenge on Hollywood.\n* Clive (voiced by [[Andy Nyman]]): a robot who acts as Balthazar Bratt's sidekick.\n* Scarlet Overkill (voiced by [[Sandra Bullock]]): In ''[[Minions (film)|Minions]]'', she is the world's first female super-villain who is bent on world domination.\n* Herb Overkill (voiced by [[Jon Hamm]]): Scarlet's husband and an inventor.\n\n==Chronology==\n* <small>''[[#Cro Minion (2015)|Cro Minion]]'' (2015)</small>\n* '''''[[Minions (film)|Minions]]''''' (2015)\n* <small>''[[#Binky Nelson Unpacified (2015)|Binky Nelson Unpacified]]'' (2015)</small>\n* <small>''[[#Competition (2015)|Competition]]'' (2015)</small>\n* <small>''[[#Orientation Day (2010)|Orientation Day]]'' (2010)</small>\n* '''''[[Despicable Me]]''''' (2010)\n* <small>''[[#Home Makeover (2010)|Home Makeover]]'' (2010)</small>\n* <small>''[[#Banana (2010)|Banana]]'' (2010)</small>\n* <small>''[[Despicable Me Minion Mayhem]]'' (2012)</small>\n* <small>''[[#Puppy (2013)|Puppy]]'' (2013)</small>\n* <small>''[[#Training Wheels (2013)|Training Wheels]]'' (2013)</small>\n* '''''[[Despicable Me 2]]''''' (2013)\n* <small>''[[#Panic in the Mailroom (2013)|Panic in the Mailroom]]'' (2013)</small>\n* <small>''[[#Mower Minions (2016)|Mower Minions]]'' (2016)</small>\n* '''''[[Despicable Me 3]]''''' (2017)\n* <small>''[[#The Secret Life of Kyle|The Secret Life of Kyle]]'' (2017)</small>\n* <small>''[[#Yellow is the New Black (2018)|Yellow is the New Black]]'' (2018)</small>\n* <small>''[[#Minion Scouts (2019)|Minion Scouts]]'' (2019)</small>\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:10%;\"| Characters\n! colspan=\"3\" | Main films\n!

He rose through the ranks of the SS, becoming one of the highest ranking men in the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) and eventually assumed the position as head of [[foreign intelligence]] for Nazi Germany following the abolition of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' in 1944.\n\n==Career==\nSchellenberg was born in [[Saarbr\u00fccken]], [[German Empire|Germany]].{{sfn|Hamilton|1996|p=64}} He was the seventh child born to his parents and his father was a piano manufacturer.{{sfn|Wistrich|1995|p=221}} Schellenberg moved with his family to [[Luxembourg]] when the [[France|French]] occupation of the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar Basin]] after the [[World War I|First World War]] triggered an economic crisis in the [[Weimar Republic]]. Like many young intellectuals who would later join the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD), Schellenberg was deeply affected by the economic woes which befell Germany in the wake of the First World War.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=255}}\n\nSchellenberg returned to Germany to attend university, first at the [[University of Marburg]] and then, in 1929, at the [[University of Bonn]]. He initially studied medicine, but soon switched to law. While in law school, Schellenberg performed some spy work for the SD.{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|2001|p=214}} He reported actually having been recruited by two SD agents who were college faculty, who also advised him to join the Civil Service.{{sfn|Browder|1996|pp=225\u2013226}} After graduating he joined the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] in 1933.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=141}} From what Schellenberg later wrote, the \"better type of people\" preferred the SS over the other Nazi organizations.{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|2001|p=132}} While educated as a lawyer, Schellenberg distrusted administrative attorneys and was intent on ensuring the SD could operate outside the constraints of normal law.{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|2001|pp=254\u2013255}} Subscribing to the ''[[F\u00fchrerprinzip]]'', Schellenberg also thought Hitler's directives were beyond the framework of the legal system and believed it was best to \"unquestioningly\" carry-out anything ordered by the Nazi leader.{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|2001|p=255}}\n\nIn 1935, Schellenberg met [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and worked for him in the [[counter-intelligence]] department of the SD.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=141}} Besides his native German, Schellenberg also spoke French and English fluently.{{sfn|Wistrich|1995|p=221}} Correspondingly, his first foreign-intelligence assignment was to Paris in 1934, where his role was to check up on the political views of a professor.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|pp=255\u2013256}} Then in 1937, Schellenberg was sent to Italy for a police assignment which included security duties for an upcoming visit by Mussolini; his outstanding work in providing security garnered positive attention from Heydrich, who then tasked him with additional organizational responsibilities, some of which later helped give birth to the [[Reich Security Main Office]] (RSHA).{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=256}} The official SS personnel report on Schellenberg described him as \"open, irreproachable, and reliable\"; the file also delineated him as \"firm, tough, possesses energy\" and one who was \"very sharp thinking\"; and his National Socialist worldview was labeled, \"thoroughly fortified.\"{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=258}} Many of the SS street-brawling types despised men like Schellenberg, considering them effete, but for the most part Schellenberg made a good impression on the Nazi elite.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=260}}\n\nSometime in 1938, Schellenberg married K\u00e4the Kortekamp, a seamstress three years his senior, whom he dated for seven years and had supported him through college. Their marriage was brief, due partially to her social standing and the fact many things about her embarrassed him; the relationship ended in divorce in 1939 but only after Schellenberg promised her an \"[[aryanized]]\" fashion business expropriated from Jewish owners.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|pp=256\u2013257}} Shortly thereafter, he married a more socially-acceptable woman named Irene Grosse-Sch\u00f6nepauck, the daughter of an insurance executive, but this relationship was also troubled.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=257}}\n\nAs the Nazis tightened their grip on German society, Hitler and ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] determined that the SS and police organs should merge, a move which Schellenberg fully supported by releasing a memorandum on 24 February 1939 which advocated further centralization within the state.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=204}} In summer 1939, Schellenberg became one of the directors of Heydrich's foundation, the ''[[Stiftung Nordhav]]''. Schellenberg was mentored by [[Herbert Mehlhorn]] while at the ''[[SS-Hauptamt]]''.{{sfn|Doerries|Weinberg|2009|pp=19\u201320}} When Heydrich announced his intentions to create the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) in July 1939, he had Schellenberg to thank as both the organisation's name and its existence were resultant from his plans. On 27 September 1939, Himmler made the RSHA an official state organ by decree.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=470}}\n\nAs the role of the SS and its action groups, the ''SS-[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', expanded in the war zones in May 1941, it was Schellenberg who negotiated with the [[Wehrmacht]] in acquiring logistical support from the army (both on the front-line and rear areas) so the ''Einsatzgruppen'' could carry out their killing operations more effectively.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=15}} Acting on behalf of Heydrich, Schellenberg issued a circular on 20 May 1941 to all segments of the German Security Police which forbade any Jews from emigrating out of German-controlled territory; this new policy was part of the nefarious [[Final Solution]].{{sfn|Gilbert|1989|pp=187\u2013188}} The language within the circular Schellenberg issued even contained the explicit expression, \"in view of the undoubtedly imminent Final Solution of the Jewish question\", a statement that makes it clear he was both complicit in and aware of the impending extermination activities.{{sfn|Fleming|1994|pp=44\u201345}} Despite being Heydrich's direct subordinate, Schellenberg skillfully ingratiated himself with Himmler by first delivering his intelligence reports to him instead of Heydrich, which earned him the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer's'' confidence.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=267}}  After Heydrich's death in June 1942, Schellenberg became the \"closest professional confidant\" of Himmler.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=398}} Himmler bestowed upon Schellenberg a unique position beyond that of a simple aide, making him his special [[plenipotentiary]] (''Sonderbevollm\u00e4chtigter'').{{sfn|Doerries|2003|p=29}}\n\n==SD operations==\nWhen Walter Schellenberg moved to Frankfurt in 1934, he recalled meeting an SS-''Oberf\u00fchrer'', who explained to him the mission of the SD; he was told the following, which he wrote in his memoirs: \n::The SD was the chief organ of the intelligence service of the party. Its task was to inform the top Party leaders of all opposition movements and forces at home and abroad. It covered the administration, the Party, industry, the theatre, journalism, the police\u2014in fact there was no sphere that was not under the watchful eye of the SD, no place where it did not seek out the first signs of opposition among movements or individuals 'hostile' to the state'.{{sfn|Schellenberg|1956|p=9}}\n \nIn March 1938, Schellenberg traveled with Himmler and Heydrich to Vienna for the impending ''[[Anschluss]]'' with Austria. One of the reasons for their journey was so the SD could \"confiscate Austrian secret service material.\"{{sfn|Gerwarth|2012|pp=163\u2013164}} During the trip, Schellenberg allegedly saved Himmler from a potential mishap when he noticed that the aircraft door that he had been leaning against was not properly secured. Throwing Himmler aside in the process, Schellenberg earned the gratitude of the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer'', who promised to reciprocate the favor if the chance ever presented itself.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|1987|p=68}} Following the exuberant reception of Hitler when he arrived in Vienna, Schellenberg later wrote, \"\u2018never...have I seen such tremendous, enthusiastic and joyous crowds.\"{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|1987|p=70}}\n\nMuch like Austria, the Nazis set their sights on the [[Sudetenland]] of [[Czechoslovakia]], a region with over three-million ethnic Germans which they wanted to incorporate into the Reich; more than that, Hitler once told his generals that he desired for Czechoslovakia to \"disappear from the map\".{{sfn|Evans|2006|pp=664\u2013667}} In the summer of 1938, the [[Gestapo]] and ''SD-Ausland'', which had taken control of the Secret Service in Czechoslovakia, helped the Sudeten Nazis from the ''Sudetendeutsche Partei'' infiltrate regional and local organizations, veterans groups, musical societies, sporting associations, sailing clubs, and cultural societies\u2014which gave them insight into the economic, political, and military situation there. So thorough was the Nazi penetration in much of the Sudetenland, that Schellenberg stated later it was necessary to establish two telephone transmission stations along the frontier to communicate with Berlin.{{sfn|Delarue|2008|pp=166\u2013167}} Eventually after strained negotiations with the West, Hitler acquired the Sudetenland when the [[Munich Agreement]] was concluded.{{sfn|Evans|2006|pp=678\u2013683}} Following this event, Schellenberg accompanied Hitler, Himmler, and Heydrich into Prague on 15 March 1939 and reported that Himmler was so pleased with the performance and racial makeup of the Czech police, that he incorporated them into the SS.{{sfn|Delarue|2008|pp=170\u2013171}} \n \nIn November 1939, Schellenberg played a major part in the [[Venlo Incident]], which led to the capture of two [[Secret Intelligence Service|British MI6 agents]], [[Sigismund Payne Best|Captain Sigismund Payne-Best]] and Major [[Richard Henry Stevens|Richard Stevens]].{{sfn|Waller|1996|pp=104\u2013118}} Schellenberg posed as a \"Major Schaemmel\" claiming to be part of an anti-Nazi group of officers planning a coup against Hitler. At Schellenberg's third meeting with Stevens and Best in the German-Dutch border town of Venlo, the trap was sprung; the two British agents were captured.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=147}} Hitler awarded Schellenberg the [[Iron Cross]] for his actions.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=259}}{{Efn|\"The Venlo Kidnapping\", ''[[The Times]]'', 19 February 1948.}} Success in this operation helped the SD acquire greater leverage in foreign policy and gave their police Attach\u00e9s access to foreign networks through the diplomatically immune offices of the German embassies abroad.{{sfn|Grunberger|1993|p=47}} The operation also damaged British morale and inclined them not to trust the opposition in Germany.{{sfn|Hassell|MacRae|Ameskamp|2006|p=60}}\n\nIn June 1940, he was charged with compiling the ''[[Informationsheft Grossbritannien|Informationsheft G.B.]]'', a blueprint for the occupation of Britain after a proposed invasion by Nazi Germany. The preparations for invasion, known as [[Operation Sea Lion]] (''Unternehmen Seel\u00f6we''), were ultimately abandoned. He based his work on the interrogations of British agents Best and Stevens, along with his own \"preconceptions\".{{sfn|Gerwarth|2012|p=177}} Part of what he prepared was described as \"a handbook for German troops and officials as a guide to the British institutions they would encounter.\"{{sfn|Evans|2010|p=139}} The extent of his direct involvement in compiling the book and its supplement, however, has been disputed.{{sfn|Doerries|Weinberg|2009|p=33}} The supplement was the \"Special Wanted List, GB\" (''Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.'', also known as \"The Black Book\"), which was a list of 2,300 prominent [[United Kingdom|Britons]] to be arrested immediately after the successful invasion of Britain.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=965}} Both Schellenberg and Heydrich perceived Great Britain as a country run by \"Freemasons, Jews, and a small public-school-trained elite.\"{{sfn|Gerwarth|2012|p=177}} Despite the poor opinion of Britain shared by both men, their full attention was turned there when on 10 May 1941, Deputy F\u00fchrer [[Rudolf Hess]] made his infamous flight to Scotland.{{sfn|Evans|2006|pp=167\u2013170}} Subsequently, SD Chief Schellenberg informed Hitler that Hess had been long under the influence of the British Secret Service and German collaborators.{{sfn|Waller|1996|p=178}} Upon further investigation, Schellenberg also reported to Hitler that Hess made his flight under the advice of an astrologer, which incited the activity of Heydrich who promptly arrested as many mediums, psychics, and astrologers he could round up in Berlin.{{sfn|Waller|1996|p=181}}\n\nBesides reactive intelligence reports like those he provided concerning Hess, Schellenberg arranged numerous plots of subterfuge and [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence gathering]], including the [[covert listening device|bugging]] of [[Salon Kitty]], a high-class Berlin brothel. Some of the Nazi regime's upper echelons even visited this brothel unaware at first, such as Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|1987|pp=80\u201381}} However, intelligence collection efforts at Salon Kitty were essentially a failure as they never revealed anything significant.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2012|p=166}}\n\nDirect access to Himmler also made Schellenberg privy to some of the Reich's most sensitive material. For example, Schellenberg knew early on about the arrangement between Germany and the Soviet Union concerning the partition of Poland, an agreement that presaged the military invasion.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|1987|p=83}} Once the Nazis invaded and occupied Polish territory, Schellenberg was entrusted with securing the rear areas by Himmler and Heydrich, which meant he oversaw the deployment of special commandos from the SD and Gestapo, units which carried-out brutal measures against the Poles.{{sfn|Delarue|2008|p=176}} Another one of his areas of responsibility was counter-espionage, both within Germany and the occupied territories\u2014a task for which Schellenberg seemed well-suited given his penchant for intrigue.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|1987|pp=83\u201384}} Operating as an intelligence adviser to Himmler in Poland meant Schellenberg was at the front edge of the spear, but this did not mean he was incapable of being surprised. In fact, he was particularly shocked at the utter devastation wrought by the Wehrmacht in Poland and commented in his ''Memoirs'' upon seeing it that, \"Until then I had no real conception of what total war meant.\"{{sfn|Schellenberg|1956|p=75}}\n\nIn 1940, Schellenberg was sent to [[Portugal]] by Heydrich at Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]'s request to intercept the [[Duke of Windsor|Duke and Duchess of Windsor]] and try to persuade them to work for Germany (\u2192 ''[[Operation Willi]]'').{{sfn|Read|2005|p=658}} Schellenberg was supposed to offer them $50 million Swiss francs to go to neutral Switzerland. However, [[Winston Churchill]] dispatched an attorney, an old friend of the Duke's, to convince them to leave Portugal.{{sfn|Hassell|MacRae|Ameskamp|2006|p=102}} In the end, the mission was a failure; Schellenberg managed nothing more than a delay of the Duke's baggage for a few hours.{{sfn|Hamilton|1996|p=64}} In March 1940, he did help convince Hitler that Dutch military intelligence was working closely with the British intelligence services, which Hitler used as a pretext to attack the Netherlands \"for violating their  neutrality.\"{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|1987|p=96}}\n\nIn February 1942, after the 1941 German attack on the Soviet Union had stalled, Schellenberg conceived and implemented a large-scale spy operation designed to penetrate into the Soviet Union, an initiative known as [[Operation Zeppelin (espionage plan)|Operation Zeppelin]] (''Unternehmen Zeppelin'').{{sfn|Biddiscombe|2000|pp=1115\u20131142}} Using anti-Communists selected from the many thousands of POWs captured by the Germans, he soon had anywhere from 10,000 to 15,000 potential candidates in training, who were accordingly indoctrinated. Only between 2,000 and 3,000 completed the training and as little as a few hundred of them ever were committed to the operation due to insufficient numbers of aircraft and radio communication equipment.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=360}} What started as a large-scale effort by Schellenberg, quickly became a precision one with very limited success. Most of them produced little to no useful intelligence and/or were killed once deployed. One German intelligence officer commented that if losses \"were not over 90 percent, we were satisfied.\"{{sfn|Kahn|1978|pp=360\u2013361}}\n\nIn March 1942, [[Heinz Jost]] was fired as RSHA Chief of Amt VI, ''[[Sicherheitsdienst#Ausland-SD|SD-Ausland]]'' (SD foreign intelligence).{{sfn|Doerries|2003|pp=21, 80}} In his place, Schellenberg was appointed chief of ''SD-Ausland'' by Heydrich.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=61}} Sometime in mid-1942, Schellenberg had been involved in planning operations in neutral [[Ireland]] including [[Operation Osprey|Operation ''Osprey'']], a plan involving No.1 SS Special Service Troop.{{Efn|Later becoming [[500th SS Parachute Battalion]] a/k/a/ SS-''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger-Bataillon 500'', an amalgamation of No. 1 Troop and various SS penal battalions. Notably participating in [[Operation R\u00f6sselsprung (1944)|Operation R\u00f6sselsprung]], the raid against Tito's HQ in 1944.}} Knowledge that Germany might lose the war prompted Schellenberg to open communication channels during the fall of 1942 with the Swiss intelligence chief, Colonel Roger Masson.{{sfn|Hassell|MacRae|Ameskamp|2006|p=196}} He even went so far as providing Masson with a list of all the ''[[Abwehr]]'' (military intelligence) agents operating in Switzerland with the intention of \"having them expelled.\"{{sfn|Halbrook|2010|p=293}}\n\nWhen the Allies invaded Italy in 1943, Schellenberg went to great lengths to ensure the safety of [[Amin al-Husseini]], the anti-Semitic and anti-British Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, who was residing in Rome, by having him transported away to Berlin.{{sfn|Hastings|2016|p=476}} As the Red Army repulsed the Germans and began driving their forces back towards the west, the German General Staff began planning a retreat into Fortress Europe which included the incorporation of  Switzerland into the defensive operation. Using his previous channels to Schellenberg, the Swiss intelligence chief Masson, who was privy to this plan known as \"Case Switzerland\", contacted Schellenberg as to whether or not an attack on Switzerland was imminent.{{sfn|Halbrook|2010|p=247}} By asking Schellenberg this question, Masson naively revealed to Schellenberg that a leak existed within Hitler's headquarters, but it also meant the Germans lost the opportunity for a surprise attack against Switzerland. To further ingratiate himself to the Swiss, Schellenberg claimed that he had convinced the German high-command of the needlessness for such an operation.{{sfn|Halbrook|2010|p=247}} Despite having direct contacts to Schellenberg himself, the Director in Switzerland of the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]], [[Allen Dulles]], expressed deep concern about the possible intelligence leaks between Masson and Schellenberg.{{sfn|Halbrook|2010|p=287}}\n\nSignals intelligence intercepts alerted the Gestapo and SD to [[Red Orchestra (spy)|the \"Red Orchestra\", the Soviet spy ring in Germany]].{{sfn|Richelson|1995|p=126}} Schellenberg led extensive efforts over many months to identify the participants. 116 were arrested by the Gestapo, half of whom were executed following intense interrogations.{{sfn|Hastings|2016|pp=241\u2013247}} By this time, Schellenberg had become a general (''Brigadef\u00fchrer'') in the ''[[Allgemeine-SS]]'' (General-SS).{{sfn|Zentner|Bedurftig|1997|pp=833\u2013834}} The operation was a major victory for the RSHA at the expense of the ''Abwehr'', who had been oblivious to the Soviet operation.{{sfn|Hastings|2016|p=243}} Historian Klaus Fischer asserts that Schellenberg's \"only major success was smashing the Red Orchestra.\"{{sfn|Fischer|1995|p=544}}\n\n===Control of all intelligence operations===\nReportedly, Schellenberg and [[Wilhelm Canaris]], the head of the ''Abwehr'', were friends. They would go horseback-riding together in Berlin's wooded Grunewald, where they would discuss the future of Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Doerries|Weinberg|2009|pp=51\u201352}} Often present at these equestrian outings were Heydrich and [[Werner Best]].{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|1979|pp=370\u2013371}} Their alleged friendship aside, Canaris was careful around Schellenberg, a man whose ambitions included controlling all intelligence for the Reich.{{sfn|Hassell|MacRae|Ameskamp|2006|p=24}} Like Heydrich, Schellenberg ultimately envisioned a centrally directed \"all-embracing security system\" and a singular \"Greater German Intelligence Service\" under direct Nazi control (unlike the ''Abwehr'', which was part of the Wehrmacht).{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|1979|p=371}} Nonetheless, there are indications that Schellenberg preferred to deal with Canaris' ''Abwehr'' over the Gestapo, particularly since he distrusted its chief, [[Heinrich M\u00fcller (Gestapo)|Heinrich M\u00fcller]].{{sfn|Doerries|Weinberg|2009|p=52}} However, after the [[20 July plot|attempted assassination of Hitler on 20 July 1944]], the ''Abwehr'' was dissolved and the SD was given additional powers over intelligence across the Reich.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=62}}{{Efn|Despite Canaris falling from grace and being implicated as a double-agent who worked against Germany, Schellenberg referred to Canaris as \"Germany's finest spy\" until the end of his life.{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|1979|p=371}} }} Canaris was arrested on 23 July 1944 on the basis of the interrogation of his successor at military intelligence, [[Georg Hansen]].{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|1979|pp=559\u2013570}}\n\nAs a result, sections of the ''Abwehr'' were incorporated into RSHA Amt VI ''SD-Ausland'' and therefore placed under Schellenberg's command.{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp=398, 400}} Assumption of these powers made Schellenberg the \"absolute master\" of Nazi intelligence\".{{sfn|Delarue|2008|p=320}} He was infamous for his \"office fortress\" desk, which had two automatic guns built into it that could be fired by the touch of a button.{{sfn|Infield|1981|pp=22\u201323}} According to the memoirs of SS intelligence officer Wilhelm Hoettl, Schellenberg was very suspicious of Gestapo Chief M\u00fcller, whom he claimed to have evidence against by way of radio surveillance recordings (allegedly revealing M\u00fcller's plans to work with the Soviets); when he informed then RSHA chief [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]] of possessing proof to that end, he was ignored.{{sfn|Waller|1996|p=297}} Kaltenbrunner disliked Schellenberg, perhaps due to his direct access to Himmler, and complained about him in particular on a number of occasions.{{sfn|Delarue|2008|p=267}} Despite Kaltenbrunner's animosity towards Schellenberg, the latter's soothing manners kept him in good graces with Himmler and allowed him to \"retain the ear of the SS overlord\".{{sfn|Hastings|2016|p=477}}\n\n===Operation \"Modellhut\"===\nAllied military intelligence documents dating from World War II, previously classified top secret, have been unearthed linking French couturier [[Coco Chanel]] to espionage activity in concert with Schellenberg, who reportedly was also one of her romantic liaisons.{{sfn|Zeitz, ''New York Times'' (8 May 2005)}} In 1943/44, an operation codenamed \"Modellhut\" ([[Coco Chanel#Operation Modellhut|Operation Model Hat]]) was conceived to capitalize on Chanel's long-standing associations with British aristocracy and specifically her friendship with Winston Churchill. Schellenberg recruited Chanel to act as an intermediary in a plan (proposed by Chanel) whose ultimate goal was to broker a separate peace between Nazi Germany and Britain independently of other Allied powers, but Operation Modellhut ultimately proved a failure.{{sfn|Vaughan|2011|pp=163\u2013175}}\n\n==Peace negotiations and capture==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S72707, Heinrich Himmler.jpg|thumb|125px|Himmler, 1942]]\nDuring early 1945, Schellenberg encouraged Himmler to overthrow Hitler in order to negotiate a separate peace with the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]], using as an excuse Hitler's poor health; however, Himmler never took action, but instead vacillated.{{sfn|Graber|1978|p=187}} He also convinced Himmler to meet with the former president of Switzerland, [[Jean-Marie Musy]], who promised to pay in Swiss francs for the release of Jews.{{sfn|Toland|1966|p=163}} At the end of the war, Schellenberg was able to persuade Himmler to try negotiating with the Western Allies through Count [[Folke Bernadotte]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=943}} Schellenberg had earlier in the year worked as an intermediary between Count Bernadotte and Himmler for the [[White Buses|release and safe passage of a number of prisoners and inmates]] held in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]]s through the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=943}}\n\nIn the spring of 1945, Schellenberg instigated further meetings with Count Bernadotte as an opening to the western powers.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=943}} He personally went to [[Stockholm]] in April 1945 to arrange the meetings for Himmler. Both Himmler and Schellenberg continued to believe that the Jews interned in concentration camps represented a bargaining chip for the Nazi leadership, one they could use to derive concessions from the Western allies.{{sfn|Mayer|2012|p=444}} To foster goodwill for their negotiations, Schellenberg\u2014with Himmler's consent\u2014organised the transport of 1,700 Jews out of German controlled territory to Switzerland and Sweden.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=944}} Hitler found out and put a stop to further evacuations.{{sfn|Doerries|2003|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nAfter the first set of failed meetings, Schellenberg requested Bernadotte to intercede directly with General Eisenhower but this final action proved futile as well.{{sfn|Mayer|2012|pp=444\u2013445}} At war's end, Schellenberg was in [[Denmark]] attempting to arrange his own surrender when the [[United Kingdom|British]] took him into custody in June 1945. The U.S., British, and Soviet intelligence services had all been searching for him as a valuable intelligence asset. Captain [[Horace Hahn]], a member of the OSS, was one of the few Americans allowed to interrogate Schellenberg.{{sfn|Doerries|2003|p=360}} Looking to recover as much information as they could from Schellenberg, the British sent him to London in July 1945 where he was extensively interrogated; their intention (along with the Americans) was to extract information on any remaining Nazi resistance yet to surface and to gather what they could on Germany's possible post-war intelligence activities. Schellenberg confirmed to the Allies that no such plans were in place, which was supported by Allied intelligence efforts.{{sfn|Breitman|Goda|Naftali|Wolfe|2005|p=113}} The fact that Schellenberg had been on the opposite side of the RSHA faction which included Kaltenbrunner, M\u00fcller, [[Otto Ohlendorf|Ohlendorf]], [[Otto Skorzeny|Skorzeny]], along with other war criminals, was the \"best thing\" he had going for him at the end of the war. Additional independent signals intelligence also proved helpful in evaluating Schellenberg.{{sfn|Breitman|Goda|Naftali|Wolfe|2005|pp=113\u2013114}}\n\n==Nuremberg trials==\nAfter the war, Schellenberg was arrested by British military police and eventually stood trial in Nuremberg.

He rose through the ranks of the SS, becoming one of the highest ranking men in the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) and eventually assumed the position as head of [[foreign intelligence]] for Nazi Germany following the abolition of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' in 1944.\n\n==Career==\nSchellenberg was born in [[Saarbr\u00fccken]], [[German Empire|Germany]].{{sfn|Hamilton|1996|p=64}} He was the seventh child born to his parents and his father was a piano manufacturer.{{sfn|Wistrich|1995|p=221}} Schellenberg moved with his family to [[Luxembourg]] when the [[France|French]] occupation of the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar Basin]] after the [[World War I|First World War]] triggered an economic crisis in the [[Weimar Republic]]. Like many young intellectuals who would later join the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD), Schellenberg was deeply affected by the economic woes which befell Germany in the wake of the First World War.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=255}}\n\nSchellenberg returned to Germany to attend university, first at the [[University of Marburg]] and then, in 1929, at the [[University of Bonn]]. He initially studied medicine, but soon switched to law. While in law school, Schellenberg performed some spy work for the SD.{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|2001|p=214}} He reported actually having been recruited by two SD agents who were college faculty, who also advised him to join the Civil Service.{{sfn|Browder|1996|pp=225\u2013226}} After graduating he joined the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] in 1933.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=141}} From what Schellenberg later wrote, the \"better type of people\" preferred the SS over the other Nazi organizations.{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|2001|p=132}} While educated as a lawyer, Schellenberg distrusted administrative attorneys and was intent on ensuring the SD could operate outside the constraints of normal law.{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|2001|pp=254\u2013255}} Subscribing to the ''[[F\u00fchrerprinzip]]'', Schellenberg also thought Hitler's directives were beyond the framework of the legal system and believed it was best to \"unquestioningly\" carry-out anything ordered by the Nazi leader.{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|2001|p=255}}\n\nIn 1935, Schellenberg met [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and worked for him in the [[counter-intelligence]] department of the SD.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=141}} Besides his native German, Schellenberg also spoke French and English fluently.{{sfn|Wistrich|1995|p=221}} Correspondingly, his first foreign-intelligence assignment was to Paris in 1934, where his role was to check up on the political views of a professor.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|pp=255\u2013256}} Then in 1937, Schellenberg was sent to Italy for a police assignment which included security duties for an upcoming visit by Mussolini; his outstanding work in providing security garnered positive attention from Heydrich, who then tasked him with additional organizational responsibilities, some of which later helped give birth to the [[Reich Security Main Office]] (RSHA).{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=256}} The official SS personnel report on Schellenberg described him as \"open, irreproachable, and reliable\"; the file also delineated him as \"firm, tough, possesses energy\" and one who was \"very sharp thinking\"; and his National Socialist worldview was labeled, \"thoroughly fortified.\"{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=258}} Many of the SS street-brawling types despised men like Schellenberg, considering them effete, but for the most part Schellenberg made a good impression on the Nazi elite.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=260}}\n\nSometime in 1938, Schellenberg married K\u00e4the Kortekamp, a seamstress three years his senior, whom he dated for seven years and had supported him through college. Their marriage was brief, due partially to her social standing and the fact many things about her embarrassed him; the relationship ended in divorce in 1939 but only after Schellenberg promised her an \"[[aryanized]]\" fashion business expropriated from Jewish owners.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|pp=256\u2013257}} Shortly thereafter, he married a more socially-acceptable woman named Irene Grosse-Sch\u00f6nepauck, the daughter of an insurance executive, but this relationship was also troubled.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=257}}\n\nAs the Nazis tightened their grip on German society, Hitler and ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] determined that the SS and police organs should merge, a move which Schellenberg fully supported by releasing a memorandum on 24 February 1939 which advocated further centralization within the state.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=204}} In summer 1939, Schellenberg became one of the directors of Heydrich's foundation, the ''[[Stiftung Nordhav]]''. Schellenberg was mentored by [[Herbert Mehlhorn]] while at the ''[[SS-Hauptamt]]''.{{sfn|Doerries|Weinberg|2009|pp=19\u201320}} When Heydrich announced his intentions to create the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) in July 1939, he had Schellenberg to thank as both the organisation's name and its existence were resultant from his plans. On 27 September 1939, Himmler made the RSHA an official state organ by decree.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=470}}\n\nAs the role of the SS and its action groups, the ''SS-[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', expanded in the war zones in May 1941, it was Schellenberg who negotiated with the [[Wehrmacht]] in acquiring logistical support from the army (both on the front-line and rear areas) so the ''Einsatzgruppen'' could carry out their killing operations more effectively.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=15}} Acting on behalf of Heydrich, Schellenberg issued a circular on 20 May 1941 to all segments of the German Security Police which forbade any Jews from emigrating out of German-controlled territory; this new policy was part of the nefarious [[Final Solution]].{{sfn|Gilbert|1989|pp=187\u2013188}} The language within the circular Schellenberg issued even contained the explicit expression, \"in view of the undoubtedly imminent Final Solution of the Jewish question\", a statement that makes it clear he was both complicit in and aware of the impending extermination activities.{{sfn|Fleming|1994|pp=44\u201345}} Despite being Heydrich's direct subordinate, Schellenberg skillfully ingratiated himself with Himmler by first delivering his intelligence reports to him instead of Heydrich, which earned him the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer's'' confidence.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=267}}  After Heydrich's death in June 1942, Schellenberg became the \"closest professional confidant\" of Himmler.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=398}} Himmler bestowed upon Schellenberg a unique position beyond that of a simple aide, making him his special [[plenipotentiary]] (''Sonderbevollm\u00e4chtigter'').{{sfn|Doerries|2003|p=29}}\n\n==SD operations==\nWhen Walter Schellenberg moved to Frankfurt in 1934, he recalled meeting an SS-''Oberf\u00fchrer'', who explained to him the mission of the SD; he was told the following, which he wrote in his memoirs: \n::The SD was the chief organ of the information service of the party. Its task was to inform the top Party leaders of all opposition movements and forces at home and abroad. It covered the administration, the Party, industry, the theatre, journalism, the police\u2014in fact there was no sphere that was not under the watchful eye of the SD, no place where it did not seek out the first signs of opposition among movements or individuals 'hostile' to the state'.{{sfn|Schellenberg|1956|p=9}}\n \nIn March 1938, Schellenberg traveled with Himmler and Heydrich to Vienna for the impending ''[[Anschluss]]'' with Austria. One of the reasons for their journey was so the SD could \"confiscate Austrian secret service material.\"{{sfn|Gerwarth|2012|pp=163\u2013164}} During the trip, Schellenberg allegedly saved Himmler from a potential mishap when he noticed that the aircraft door that he had been leaning against was not properly secured. Throwing Himmler aside in the process, Schellenberg earned the gratitude of the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer'', who promised to reciprocate the favor if the chance ever presented itself.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|1987|p=68}} Following the exuberant reception of Hitler when he arrived in Vienna, Schellenberg later wrote, \"\u2018never...have I seen such tremendous, enthusiastic and joyous crowds.\"{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|1987|p=70}}\n\nMuch like Austria, the Nazis set their sights on the [[Sudetenland]] of [[Czechoslovakia]], a region with over three-million ethnic Germans which they wanted to incorporate into the Reich; more than that, Hitler once told his generals that he desired for Czechoslovakia to \"disappear from the map\".{{sfn|Evans|2006|pp=664\u2013667}} In the summer of 1938, the [[Gestapo]] and ''SD-Ausland'', which had taken control of the Secret Service in Czechoslovakia, helped the Sudeten Nazis from the ''Sudetendeutsche Partei'' infiltrate regional and local organizations, veterans groups, musical societies, sporting associations, sailing clubs, and cultural societies\u2014which gave them insight into the economic, political, and military situation there. So thorough was the Nazi penetration in much of the Sudetenland, that Schellenberg stated later it was necessary to establish two telephone transmission stations along the frontier to communicate with Berlin.{{sfn|Delarue|2008|pp=166\u2013167}} Eventually after strained negotiations with the West, Hitler acquired the Sudetenland when the [[Munich Agreement]] was concluded.{{sfn|Evans|2006|pp=678\u2013683}} Following this event, Schellenberg accompanied Hitler, Himmler, and Heydrich into Prague on 15 March 1939 and reported that Himmler was so pleased with the performance and racial makeup of the Czech police, that he incorporated them into the SS.{{sfn|Delarue|2008|pp=170\u2013171}} \n \nIn November 1939, Schellenberg played a major part in the [[Venlo Incident]], which led to the capture of two [[Secret Intelligence Service|British MI6 agents]], [[Sigismund Payne Best|Captain Sigismund Payne-Best]] and Major [[Richard Henry Stevens|Richard Stevens]].{{sfn|Waller|1996|pp=104\u2013118}} Schellenberg posed as a \"Major Schaemmel\" claiming to be part of an anti-Nazi group of officers planning a coup against Hitler. At Schellenberg's third meeting with Stevens and Best in the German-Dutch border town of Venlo, the trap was sprung; the two British agents were captured.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=147}} Hitler awarded Schellenberg the [[Iron Cross]] for his actions.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=259}}{{Efn|\"The Venlo Kidnapping\", ''[[The Times]]'', 19 February 1948.}} Success in this operation helped the SD acquire greater leverage in foreign policy and gave their police Attach\u00e9s access to foreign networks through the diplomatically immune offices of the German embassies abroad.{{sfn|Grunberger|1993|p=47}} The operation also damaged British morale and inclined them not to trust the opposition in Germany.{{sfn|Hassell|MacRae|Ameskamp|2006|p=60}}\n\nIn June 1940, he was charged with compiling the ''[[Informationsheft Grossbritannien|Informationsheft G.B.]]'', a blueprint for the occupation of Britain after a proposed invasion by Nazi Germany. The preparations for invasion, known as [[Operation Sea Lion]] (''Unternehmen Seel\u00f6we''), were ultimately abandoned. He based his work on the interrogations of British agents Best and Stevens, along with his own \"preconceptions\".{{sfn|Gerwarth|2012|p=177}} Part of what he prepared was described as \"a handbook for German troops and officials as a guide to the British institutions they would encounter.\"{{sfn|Evans|2010|p=139}} The extent of his direct involvement in compiling the book and its supplement, however, has been disputed.{{sfn|Doerries|Weinberg|2009|p=33}} The supplement was the \"Special Wanted List, GB\" (''Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.'', also known as \"The Black Book\"), which was a list of 2,300 prominent [[United Kingdom|Britons]] to be arrested immediately after the successful invasion of Britain.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=965}} Both Schellenberg and Heydrich perceived Great Britain as a country run by \"Freemasons, Jews, and a small public-school-trained elite.\"{{sfn|Gerwarth|2012|p=177}} Despite the poor opinion of Britain shared by both men, their full attention was turned there when on 10 May 1941, Deputy F\u00fchrer [[Rudolf Hess]] made his infamous flight to Scotland.{{sfn|Evans|2006|pp=167\u2013170}} Subsequently, SD Chief Schellenberg informed Hitler that Hess had been long under the influence of the British Secret Service and German collaborators.{{sfn|Waller|1996|p=178}} Upon further investigation, Schellenberg also reported to Hitler that Hess made his flight under the advice of an astrologer, which incited the activity of Heydrich who promptly arrested as many mediums, psychics, and astrologers he could round up in Berlin.{{sfn|Waller|1996|p=181}}\n\nBesides reactive intelligence reports like those he provided concerning Hess, Schellenberg arranged numerous plots of subterfuge and [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence gathering]], including the [[covert listening device|bugging]] of [[Salon Kitty]], a high-class Berlin brothel. Some of the Nazi regime's upper echelons even visited this brothel unaware at first, such as Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|1987|pp=80\u201381}} However, intelligence collection efforts at Salon Kitty were essentially a failure as they never revealed anything significant.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2012|p=166}}\n\nDirect access to Himmler also made Schellenberg privy to some of the Reich's most sensitive material. For example, Schellenberg knew early on about the arrangement between Germany and the Soviet Union concerning the partition of Poland, an agreement that presaged the military invasion.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|1987|p=83}} Once the Nazis invaded and occupied Polish territory, Schellenberg was entrusted with securing the rear areas by Himmler and Heydrich, which meant he oversaw the deployment of special commandos from the SD and Gestapo, units which carried-out brutal measures against the Poles.{{sfn|Delarue|2008|p=176}} Another one of his areas of responsibility was counter-espionage, both within Germany and the occupied territories\u2014a task for which Schellenberg seemed well-suited given his penchant for intrigue.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|1987|pp=83\u201384}} Operating as an intelligence adviser to Himmler in Poland meant Schellenberg was at the front edge of the spear, but this did not mean he was incapable of being surprised. In fact, he was particularly shocked at the utter devastation wrought by the Wehrmacht in Poland and commented in his ''Memoirs'' upon seeing it that, \"Until then I had no real conception of what total war meant.\"{{sfn|Schellenberg|1956|p=75}}\n\nIn 1940, Schellenberg was sent to [[Portugal]] by Heydrich at Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]'s request to intercept the [[Duke of Windsor|Duke and Duchess of Windsor]] and try to persuade them to work for Germany (\u2192 ''[[Operation Willi]]'').{{sfn|Read|2005|p=658}} Schellenberg was supposed to offer them $50 million Swiss francs to go to neutral Switzerland. However, [[Winston Churchill]] dispatched an attorney, an old friend of the Duke's, to convince them to leave Portugal.{{sfn|Hassell|MacRae|Ameskamp|2006|p=102}} In the end, the mission was a failure; Schellenberg managed nothing more than a delay of the Duke's baggage for a few hours.{{sfn|Hamilton|1996|p=64}} In March 1940, he did help convince Hitler that Dutch military intelligence was working closely with the British intelligence services, which Hitler used as a pretext to attack the Netherlands \"for violating their  neutrality.\"{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|1987|p=96}}\n\nIn February 1942, after the 1941 German attack on the Soviet Union had stalled, Schellenberg conceived and implemented a large-scale spy operation designed to penetrate into the Soviet Union, an initiative known as [[Operation Zeppelin (espionage plan)|Operation Zeppelin]] (''Unternehmen Zeppelin'').{{sfn|Biddiscombe|2000|pp=1115\u20131142}} Using anti-Communists selected from the many thousands of POWs captured by the Germans, he soon had anywhere from 10,000 to 15,000 potential candidates in training, who were accordingly indoctrinated. Only between 2,000 and 3,000 completed the training and as little as a few hundred of them ever were committed to the operation due to insufficient numbers of aircraft and radio communication equipment.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=360}} What started as a large-scale effort by Schellenberg, quickly became a precision one with very limited success. Most of them produced little to no useful intelligence and/or were killed once deployed. One German intelligence officer commented that if losses \"were not over 90 percent, we were satisfied.\"{{sfn|Kahn|1978|pp=360\u2013361}}\n\nIn March 1942, [[Heinz Jost]] was fired as RSHA Chief of Amt VI, ''[[Sicherheitsdienst#Ausland-SD|SD-Ausland]]'' (SD foreign intelligence).{{sfn|Doerries|2003|pp=21, 80}} In his place, Schellenberg was appointed chief of ''SD-Ausland'' by Heydrich.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=61}} Sometime in mid-1942, Schellenberg had been involved in planning operations in neutral [[Ireland]] including [[Operation Osprey|Operation ''Osprey'']], a plan involving No.1 SS Special Service Troop.{{Efn|Later becoming [[500th SS Parachute Battalion]] a/k/a/ SS-''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger-Bataillon 500'', an amalgamation of No. 1 Troop and various SS penal battalions. Notably participating in [[Operation R\u00f6sselsprung (1944)|Operation R\u00f6sselsprung]], the raid against Tito's HQ in 1944.}} Knowledge that Germany might lose the war prompted Schellenberg to open communication channels during the fall of 1942 with the Swiss intelligence chief, Colonel Roger Masson.{{sfn|Hassell|MacRae|Ameskamp|2006|p=196}} He even went so far as providing Masson with a list of all the ''[[Abwehr]]'' (military intelligence) agents operating in Switzerland with the intention of \"having them expelled.\"{{sfn|Halbrook|2010|p=293}}\n\nWhen the Allies invaded Italy in 1943, Schellenberg went to great lengths to ensure the safety of [[Amin al-Husseini]], the anti-Semitic and anti-British Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, who was residing in Rome, by having him transported away to Berlin.{{sfn|Hastings|2016|p=476}} As the Red Army repulsed the Germans and began driving their forces back towards the west, the German General Staff began planning a retreat into Fortress Europe which included the incorporation of  Switzerland into the defensive operation. Using his previous channels to Schellenberg, the Swiss intelligence chief Masson, who was privy to this plan known as \"Case Switzerland\", contacted Schellenberg as to whether or not an attack on Switzerland was imminent.{{sfn|Halbrook|2010|p=247}} By asking Schellenberg this question, Masson naively revealed to Schellenberg that a leak existed within Hitler's headquarters, but it also meant the Germans lost the opportunity for a surprise attack against Switzerland. To further ingratiate himself to the Swiss, Schellenberg claimed that he had convinced the German high-command of the needlessness for such an operation.{{sfn|Halbrook|2010|p=247}} Despite having direct contacts to Schellenberg himself, the Director in Switzerland of the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]], [[Allen Dulles]], expressed deep concern about the possible intelligence leaks between Masson and Schellenberg.{{sfn|Halbrook|2010|p=287}}\n\nSignals intelligence intercepts alerted the Gestapo and SD to [[Red Orchestra (spy)|the \"Red Orchestra\", the Soviet spy ring in Germany]].{{sfn|Richelson|1995|p=126}} Schellenberg led extensive efforts over many months to identify the participants. 116 were arrested by the Gestapo, half of whom were executed following intense interrogations.{{sfn|Hastings|2016|pp=241\u2013247}} By this time, Schellenberg had become a general (''Brigadef\u00fchrer'') in the ''[[Allgemeine-SS]]'' (General-SS).{{sfn|Zentner|Bedurftig|1997|pp=833\u2013834}} The operation was a major victory for the RSHA at the expense of the ''Abwehr'', who had been oblivious to the Soviet operation.{{sfn|Hastings|2016|p=243}} Historian Klaus Fischer asserts that Schellenberg's \"only major success was smashing the Red Orchestra.\"{{sfn|Fischer|1995|p=544}}\n\n===Control of all intelligence operations===\nReportedly, Schellenberg and [[Wilhelm Canaris]], the head of the ''Abwehr'', were friends. They would go horseback-riding together in Berlin's wooded Grunewald, where they would discuss the future of Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Doerries|Weinberg|2009|pp=51\u201352}} Often present at these equestrian outings were Heydrich and [[Werner Best]].{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|1979|pp=370\u2013371}} Their alleged friendship aside, Canaris was careful around Schellenberg, a man whose ambitions included controlling all intelligence for the Reich.{{sfn|Hassell|MacRae|Ameskamp|2006|p=24}} Like Heydrich, Schellenberg ultimately envisioned a centrally directed \"all-embracing security system\" and a singular \"Greater German Intelligence Service\" under direct Nazi control (unlike the ''Abwehr'', which was part of the Wehrmacht).{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|1979|p=371}} Nonetheless, there are indications that Schellenberg preferred to deal with Canaris' ''Abwehr'' over the Gestapo, particularly since he distrusted its chief, [[Heinrich M\u00fcller (Gestapo)|Heinrich M\u00fcller]].{{sfn|Doerries|Weinberg|2009|p=52}} However, after the [[20 July plot|attempted assassination of Hitler on 20 July 1944]], the ''Abwehr'' was dissolved and the SD was given additional powers over intelligence across the Reich.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=62}}{{Efn|Despite Canaris falling from grace and being implicated as a double-agent who worked against Germany, Schellenberg referred to Canaris as \"Germany's finest spy\" until the end of his life.{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|1979|p=371}} }} Canaris was arrested on 23 July 1944 on the basis of the interrogation of his successor at military intelligence, [[Georg Hansen]].{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|1979|pp=559\u2013570}}\n\nAs a result, sections of the ''Abwehr'' were incorporated into RSHA Amt VI ''SD-Ausland'' and therefore placed under Schellenberg's command.{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp=398, 400}} Assumption of these powers made Schellenberg the \"absolute master\" of Nazi intelligence\".{{sfn|Delarue|2008|p=320}} He was infamous for his \"office fortress\" desk, which had two automatic guns built into it that could be fired by the touch of a button.{{sfn|Infield|1981|pp=22\u201323}} According to the memoirs of SS intelligence officer Wilhelm Hoettl, Schellenberg was very suspicious of Gestapo Chief M\u00fcller, whom he claimed to have evidence against by way of radio surveillance recordings (allegedly revealing M\u00fcller's plans to work with the Soviets); when he informed then RSHA chief [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]] of possessing proof to that end, he was ignored.{{sfn|Waller|1996|p=297}} Kaltenbrunner disliked Schellenberg, perhaps due to his direct access to Himmler, and complained about him in particular on a number of occasions.{{sfn|Delarue|2008|p=267}} Despite Kaltenbrunner's animosity towards Schellenberg, the latter's soothing manners kept him in good graces with Himmler and allowed him to \"retain the ear of the SS overlord\".{{sfn|Hastings|2016|p=477}}\n\n===Operation \"Modellhut\"===\nAllied military intelligence documents dating from World War II, previously classified top secret, have been unearthed linking French couturier [[Coco Chanel]] to espionage activity in concert with Schellenberg, who reportedly was also one of her romantic liaisons.{{sfn|Zeitz, ''New York Times'' (8 May 2005)}} In 1943/44, an operation codenamed \"Modellhut\" ([[Coco Chanel#Operation Modellhut|Operation Model Hat]]) was conceived to capitalize on Chanel's long-standing associations with British aristocracy and specifically her friendship with Winston Churchill. Schellenberg recruited Chanel to act as an intermediary in a plan (proposed by Chanel) whose ultimate goal was to broker a separate peace between Nazi Germany and Britain independently of other Allied powers, but Operation Modellhut ultimately proved a failure.{{sfn|Vaughan|2011|pp=163\u2013175}}\n\n==Peace negotiations and capture==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S72707, Heinrich Himmler.jpg|thumb|125px|Himmler, 1942]]\nDuring early 1945, Schellenberg encouraged Himmler to overthrow Hitler in order to negotiate a separate peace with the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]], using as an excuse Hitler's poor health; however, Himmler never took action, but instead vacillated.{{sfn|Graber|1978|p=187}} He also convinced Himmler to meet with the former president of Switzerland, [[Jean-Marie Musy]], who promised to pay in Swiss francs for the release of Jews.{{sfn|Toland|1966|p=163}} At the end of the war, Schellenberg was able to persuade Himmler to try negotiating with the Western Allies through Count [[Folke Bernadotte]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=943}} Schellenberg had earlier in the year worked as an intermediary between Count Bernadotte and Himmler for the [[White Buses|release and safe passage of a number of prisoners and inmates]] held in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]]s through the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=943}}\n\nIn the spring of 1945, Schellenberg instigated further meetings with Count Bernadotte as an opening to the western powers.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=943}} He personally went to [[Stockholm]] in April 1945 to arrange the meetings for Himmler. Both Himmler and Schellenberg continued to believe that the Jews interned in concentration camps represented a bargaining chip for the Nazi leadership, one they could use to derive concessions from the Western allies.{{sfn|Mayer|2012|p=444}} To foster goodwill for their negotiations, Schellenberg\u2014with Himmler's consent\u2014organised the transport of 1,700 Jews out of German controlled territory to Switzerland and Sweden.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=944}} Hitler found out and put a stop to further evacuations.{{sfn|Doerries|2003|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nAfter the first set of failed meetings, Schellenberg requested Bernadotte to intercede directly with General Eisenhower but this final action proved futile as well.{{sfn|Mayer|2012|pp=444\u2013445}} At war's end, Schellenberg was in [[Denmark]] attempting to arrange his own surrender when the [[United Kingdom|British]] took him into custody in June 1945. The U.S., British, and Soviet intelligence services had all been searching for him as a valuable intelligence asset. Captain [[Horace Hahn]], a member of the OSS, was one of the few Americans allowed to interrogate Schellenberg.{{sfn|Doerries|2003|p=360}} Looking to recover as much information as they could from Schellenberg, the British sent him to London in July 1945 where he was extensively interrogated; their intention (along with the Americans) was to extract information on any remaining Nazi resistance yet to surface and to gather what they could on Germany's possible post-war intelligence activities. Schellenberg confirmed to the Allies that no such plans were in place, which was supported by Allied intelligence efforts.{{sfn|Breitman|Goda|Naftali|Wolfe|2005|p=113}} The fact that Schellenberg had been on the opposite side of the RSHA faction which included Kaltenbrunner, M\u00fcller, [[Otto Ohlendorf|Ohlendorf]], [[Otto Skorzeny|Skorzeny]], along with other war criminals, was the \"best thing\" he had going for him at the end of the war. Additional independent signals intelligence also proved helpful in evaluating Schellenberg.{{sfn|Breitman|Goda|Naftali|Wolfe|2005|pp=113\u2013114}}\n\n==Nuremberg trials==\nAfter the war, Schellenberg was arrested by British military police and eventually stood trial in Nuremberg. On 4 November 1949, he was sentenced to six years in prison for his role in the murder of Soviet POWs who were employed as agents in Operation Zeppelin.{{sfn|Deutsche Biographie, ''Walter Schellenberg''}} During the postwar [[Nuremberg Trials]], Schellenberg testified about the SS organisation and the Nazi leaders in its fold.{{Efn|http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/01-04-46.asp ''Nuremberg Trial Proceedings'' Twenty-Seventh Day, Yale University's '''AVALON Project'''  (cited 15 April 2016)}} During the [[Ministries Trial]], he wrote his memoirs, ''The Labyrinth''. Historian Robert Gerwarth describes certain content of Schellenberg's memoirs as \"questionable.\"{{sfn|Gerwarth|2012|p=95}}{{Efn|A formerly classified book review by CIA intelligence officer Clinton Gallagher from 1957 reveals that doubt has long been cast on the validity of some of Schellenberg's claims.

The importance of industry dramatically increased during the [[Socialist]] period. In the era of economic planning,  industrial production accounted for more than 50% of national GDP. The main market for Bulgarian manufactured goods was [[Comecon]], the Communist economic organization (comparable to the EU).\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Before 1878 ===\nThe first factory in what is now Bulgaria was built by the [[industrialist]] Dobri Zhelyazkov in the town of Sliven, in 1833.  It manufactured woollen textiles and was the first textile mill in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Industrialisation before the independence in 1878 was largely concentrated around the major towns of [[Plovdiv]], [[Gabrovo]], [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]], Sliven, [[Karlovo]], [[Sofia]] and [[Samokov]]. These early companies were mostly  small firms with a handful of workers, involved in light manufacture producing high end goods such as textiles, soap, alcohol, wine and leather products. Competition from more established  Western European firms put many of these early enterprises out of business.<ref>{{cite book|title=\u0422\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e-\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f|last=\u0414\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0432|first=\u0414.|publisher=Ciela|year=2004|isbn=954-649-717-7|location=Sofia|pages=272|language=Bulgarian}}</ref>\n\n=== 1878-1945 ===\n[[Image:Kremikovtsi.JPG|250px|thumb|A steel-producing installation at the Kremikovtsi metallurgy works]]\nAfter the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] the new country settled upon a low [[tariff]] regime and as a result local industry suffered from the increased import of cheaper and high-quality goods from  more developed producers in Western Europe.  A number of [[protectionist]] laws passed by the government in the 1890s and early 20th century led to an increase in industrial output.  At this time Bulgaria received  an inflow of foreign capital largely from [[Germany]], [[Belgium]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] which was focused mainly in mining and agricultural processing industries.  In the 25 years between 1890 and 1915, industry provided 15% of the GDP.<ref name=\"ec\">{{cite book|title=\u0422\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e-\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f|last=\u0414\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0432|first=\u0414.|publisher=Ciela|year=2004|isbn=954-649-717-7|location=Sofia|pages=273|language=Bulgarian}}</ref>\n\nDespite the upheavals of [[World War I]], the number of manufacturing plants increased between the wars.

Ruse, Plovdiv, [[Varna]], Sofia, [[Pleven]], [[Stara Zagora]], and Gabrovo saw significant expansion between 1920 and 1940. Large parts of the country remained almost entirely agrarian. At the beginning of [[World War II]] only five cities, Sofia, Plovdiv, Ruse, Varna and Burgas, accounted for 46,5% of all industrial output.<ref>{{cite book|title=\u0422\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e-\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f|last=\u0414\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0432|first=\u0414.|publisher=Ciela|year=2004|isbn=954-649-717-7|location=Sofia|pages=274|language=Bulgarian}}</ref>\n\nManufacturing was still predominantly light and export focused: textiles, leather, footwear and perishables such as tobacco, sugar, butter and meat were produced in large quantities.

All existing plants were [[nationalize]]d and the entire Bulgarian economy was subjected to a [[planned economy]]. There was a sustained increase in production, and new industries were developed very quickly and, as in other Socialist countries, not always efficiently.  New industrial complexes on a scale not before seen in the [[Balkans]] were constructed. New power plants, chemical works, metallurgical smelters, military producers and other industries were inaugurated. The country's scientific and technical base was not neglected; new schools and universities were built which fed directly into the expanding industrial economy. The national economy was integrated in [[Comecon]] and Bulgaria specialized in the production of [[electronics]], [[motor truck]]s and [[tinned food]].\n\nDuring the 1940s the main objective of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] was to rebuild the damage caused during the Second World War.  New roads and railways were built, as well as small factories. During the 1950s massive expansion of the electro-transit network brought electricity to all parts of the country.  A number of hydro plants including the [[Batak Dam|Batak]] Hydro-power System and several coal plants were constructed.  The extraction of coal was increased and Bulgaria's first [[oil]] field, in [[Shabla]], went into production. During the next decade many military and metallurgical plants were constructed, including the [[Kremikovtsi]] and [[Stomana]] steelworks.  Cooperation on [[space technology|space technologies]] with the [[USSR]] was encouraged and the country supplied the [[Soviet space program]] with research devices and computers.  Many new factories in the field of micro and precision electronics were inaugurated. In the 1970s the industrial component of the Bulgarian economy continued to increase. In 1974 Bulgaria became the third communist state to have a functioning nuclear power station (see [[Kozloduy NPP]]). On 10 April 1979 Bulgaria became the sixth nation in the world to send a man into space using the Soviet [[Intercosmos]] program.<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/astros/ivaeorgi.htm Ivanov Georgi<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> During the 80s Bulgaria was a mass producer of [[Pravetz computers|Pravetz series 8]]), and in 1990 the computer technology industry produced 35% of [[FOREX]] earnings.\n\n=== After 1989 ===\nAfter the overthrow of the Communist Regime the inefficient Bulgarian economy was thrown into chaos. Years of inefficient state planning, environmental degradation and the use of outdated modes of production meant Bulgaria, lagging for years and heavily indebted, struggled to compete in free market conditions. Many manufacturing plants were closed and others went into [[bankruptcy]] as the state gave up the battle to try and bring them to profitability.<ref>[http://mrcenter.info/Doc/ConferencePapers/2016/paper%20Bogatzky%20MRC_Full%20EN.pdf Bogatzky Nikolay, ''Socialist industrialization and Infant industry argument'', Monetary Research Center, Sofia, 2017, Conference Papers ISSN 2534-9600]</ref> Due to lack of investment the high-tech component of the Bulgarian economy went into terminal decline, undercut by more modern Asian imports and the collapse of Comecon.

The importance of industry dramatically increased during the [[Socialist]] period. In the era of economic planning,  industrial production accounted for more than 50% of national GDP. The main market for Bulgarian manufactured goods was [[Comecon]], the Communist economic organization (comparable to the EU).\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Before 1878 ===\nThe first factory in what is now Bulgaria was built by the [[industrialist]] Dobri Zhelyazkov in the town of Sliven, in 1833.  It manufactured woollen textiles and was the first textile mill in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Industrialisation before the independence in 1878 was largely concentrated around the major towns of [[Plovdiv]], [[Gabrovo]], [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]], Sliven, [[Karlovo]], [[Sofia]] and [[Samokov]]. These early companies were mostly  small firms with a handful of workers, involved in light manufacture producing high end goods such as textiles, soap, alcohol, wine and leather products.

All existing plants were [[nationalize]]d and the entire Bulgarian economy was subjected to a [[planned economy]]. There was a sustained increase in production, and new industries were developed very quickly and, as in other Socialist countries, not always efficiently.  New industrial complexes on a scale not before seen in the [[Balkans]] were constructed. New power plants, chemical works, metallurgical smelters, military producers and other industries were inaugurated. The country's scientific and technical base was not neglected; new schools and universities were built which fed directly into the expanding industrial economy. The national economy was integrated in [[Comecon]] and Bulgaria specialized in the production of [[electronics]], [[motor truck]]s and [[tinned food]].\n\nDuring the 1940s the main objective of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] was to rebuild the damage caused during the Second World War.  New roads and railways were built, as well as small factories. During the 1950s massive expansion of the electro-transit network brought electricity to all parts of the country.  A number of hydro plants including the [[Batak Dam|Batak]] Hydro-power System and several coal plants were constructed.  The extraction of coal was increased and Bulgaria's first [[oil]] field, in [[Shabla]], went into production. During the next decade many military and metallurgical plants were constructed, including the [[Kremikovtsi]] and [[Stomana]] steelworks.  Cooperation on [[space technology|space technologies]] with the [[USSR]] was encouraged and the country supplied the [[Soviet space program]] with research devices and computers.  Many new factories in the field of micro and precision electronics were inaugurated. In the 1970s the industrial component of the Bulgarian economy continued to increase. In 1974 Bulgaria became the third communist state to have a functioning nuclear power station (see [[Kozloduy NPP]]). On 10 April 1979 Bulgaria became the sixth nation in the world to send a man into space using the Soviet [[Intercosmos]] program.<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/astros/ivaeorgi.htm Ivanov Georgi<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> During the 80s Bulgaria was a mass producer of [[Pravetz computers|Pravetz series 8]]), and in 1990 the computer technology industry produced 35% of [[FOREX]] earnings.\n\n=== After 1989 ===\nAfter the overthrow of the Communist Regime the inefficient Bulgarian economy was thrown into chaos.
