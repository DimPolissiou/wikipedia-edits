Retrieved on: 2010-05-19.</ref> Founder Reverend Thomas Nelson Haskell described it as a coeducational liberal arts college in the tradition of [[Oberlin College]]. Like many U.S. colleges and universities that have endured from the 19th century, it now is secular in outlook, and it retains its liberal arts focus.\n\n[[Cutler Hall]], the college's first building, was completed in 1880 and the first degrees were conferred in 1882.\n\n[[William F. Slocum]], president from 1888 to 1917, oversaw the initial building of the campus, expanded the library and recruited top scholars in a number of fields.<ref name=CChistory/>  In 1930, Shove Chapel was erected by Mr. John Gray, to meet the religious needs of the students (though Colorado College is not religiously affiliated).\n\n[[Katharine Lee Bates]] wrote \"[[America the Beautiful]]\" during her summer teaching position at Colorado College in 1893.\n\n==Academics==\n[[File:Russell T Tutt Science Center.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Russell T. Tutt Science Center at Colorado College]]\nThe college offers more than 80 majors, minors, and specialized programs including: Southwest studies, feminist and gender studies, [[Asian studies]], [[biochemistry]], [[environmental science]], [[neuroscience]], [[Latin American studies]], Russian and Eurasian studies, and American cultural studies, as well as an across-the-curriculum writing program. In addition to its undergraduate programs, the college offers a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree. Tutt Library has approximately half a million bound volumes. In 2012, Colorado College yielded a student-to-faculty ratio of 10:1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.locatecolleges.com/co/colorado-springs/colorado-college|title=Colorado College|work=locatecolleges.com}}</ref>\n\n===Block plan===\nColorado College follows a unique schedule known as the \"block plan\" in which students study one subject intensively for three-and-a-half-week \"blocks\", followed by a 4.5 day break. The intensity stems from the time commitment (classes meet for a minimum of three hours Monday through Friday) as well as the demand for engaging rapidly with complex content. Advocates say this allows for more lab time, field research, and an intensive hands-on learning experience with fewer distractions. Critics say that this approach to learning does not allow adequate time for students to digest complex topics.\n\nThe block plan epitomizes experiential learning. It is common for classes to take short or extended trips to apply classroom concepts in the real world. Because students only take one course for the duration of the block, professors have the flexibility to develop these types of excursions. For example, a renewable energy course might travel to a local wind farm or a geology class may take a week in Moab, Utah to study geological patterns in the region. A satellite campus in [[Crestone, Colorado]] at the base of the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] known as \"Baca Campus\" offers a retreat destination often utilized by language, philosophy, writing, and religion courses. Baca Campus boasts a lodge, conference center, classroom, restaurant, and student townhouse facilities. Some courses will even spend an entire block immersed in an area of interest. These occur both domestically and internationally.\n\nAfter each block, students are rewarded with 4.5 days off. Most students head off campus, often involving some type of outdoor exploration.\n\nEvery student begins the Colorado College journey with a \"First Year Experience\" course, or FYE. This is a back-to-back block spanning 8 weeks and functions as a freshmen seminar course.\n\nStudents can also take blocks during winter and summer breaks. In January, the college offers \"half blocks,\" an intensive 10-day course fulfilling a half credit. Meanwhile, summer blocks are three weeks long, and there are also graduate blocks of differing lengths. In parallel with the students, professors teach only one block at a time. Classes are generally capped at 25 students to encourage a more personalized academic experience.\n\n===Admissions===\nColorado College is considered a \"most selective school\" by ''U.S. News & World Report''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/colorado-college-1347|title=Colorado College|year=2016|magazine=U.S. News & World Report}}</ref>\n\nFor the Class of 2023 (enrolled fall 2019), Colorado College received a record 9,454 applications (an increase of nearly 1,000 applicants over the Class of 2022) and admitted 13.5%, the lowest acceptance rate in the school's history, with 547 incoming students.<ref name=\"Welcome2023\"/> Students of color make up 27 percent of the incoming class, 15 percent are Pell Grant recipients, 9 percent first-generation students, and 9 percent international students.

A 'work hard, play hard' motto is commonly referenced on campus. However, 'play' for Colorado College students is distinctive. Many students share a thirst for outdoor exploration, and can be found hiking, biking, climbing, and skiing, among other things. Colorado College's proximity to the Rocky Mountains and several mountain resort communities create an ideal environment for these types of activities. Students are also active in community engagement activities to advance social justice and sustainability.\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Cutler Hall.JPG|thumbnail|left|Cutler Hall, located at 912 North Cascade Avenue, on the Colorado College campus, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Professor Woodson \"Chief\" Tyree, Director of Radio and Drama Department at Colorado College was the founder and inspirational force in the program that one day became KRCC-FM. In 1946, KRCC moved to South Hall (where Packard Hall now stands) on campus where two students, Charles \"Bud\" Edmonds '51, and Margaret Merle-Smith '51, were instrumental in securing a war surplus FM transmitter. KRCC began over the air broadcasting in April 1951 as the first non-commercial educational FM radio station in the state of Colorado.\n\nKRCC broadcasts through a series of eleven transmitters and translators throughout southern Colorado and a portion of northern New Mexico.  KRCC's main transmitter, atop [[Cheyenne Mountain]], broadcasts three separate HD multi-cast channels, including a channel run completely by Colorado College students called the SOCC (Sounds of Colorado College).\n\n==Notable people==\n{{see also| List of Colorado College people}}\n\n===Alumni===\nColorado College's alumni include a [[Nobel Prize]] winner, a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner, 2 [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellows]], 14 [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]], 31 [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholars]], and 68 [[Thomas J.

Retrieved on: 2010-05-19.</ref> Founder Reverend Thomas Nelson Haskell described it as a coeducational liberal arts college in the tradition of [[Oberlin College]]. Like many U.S. colleges and universities that have endured from the 19th century, it now is secular in outlook, and it retains its liberal arts focus.\n\n[[Cutler Hall]], the college's first building, was completed in 1880 and the first degrees were conferred in 1882.\n\n[[William F. Slocum]], president from 1888 to 1917, oversaw the initial building of the campus, expanded the library and recruited top scholars in a number of fields.<ref name=CChistory/>  In 1930, Shove Chapel was erected by Mr. John Gray, to meet the religious needs of the students (though Colorado College is not religiously affiliated).\n\n[[Katharine Lee Bates]] wrote \"[[America the Beautiful]]\" during her summer teaching position at Colorado College in 1893.\n\n==Academics==\n[[File:Russell T Tutt Science Center.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Russell T. Tutt Science Center at Colorado College]]\nThe college offers more than 80 majors, minors, and specialized programs including: Southwest studies, feminist and gender studies, [[Asian studies]], [[biochemistry]], [[environmental science]], [[neuroscience]], [[Latin American studies]], Russian and Eurasian studies, and American cultural studies, as well as an across-the-curriculum writing program. In addition to its undergraduate programs, the college offers a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree. Tutt Library has approximately half a million bound volumes. In 2012, Colorado College yielded a student-to-faculty ratio of 10:1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.locatecolleges.com/co/colorado-springs/colorado-college|title=Colorado College|work=locatecolleges.com}}</ref>\n\n===Block plan===\nColorado College follows a unique schedule known as the \"block plan\" in which students study one subject intensively for three-and-a-half-week \"blocks\", followed by a 4.5 day break. The intensity stems from the time commitment (classes meet for a minimum of three hours Monday through Friday) as well as the demand for engaging rapidly with complex content. Advocates say this allows for more lab time, field research, and an intensive hands-on learning experience with fewer distractions. Critics say that this approach to learning does not allow adequate time for students to digest complex topics.\n\nThe block plan epitomizes experiential learning. It is common for classes to take short or extended trips to apply classroom concepts in the real world. Because students only take one course for the duration of the block, professors have the flexibility to develop these types of excursions. For example, a renewable energy course might travel to a local wind farm or a geology class may take a week in Moab, Utah to study geological patterns in the region. A satellite campus in [[Crestone, Colorado]] at the base of the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] known as \"Baca Campus\" offers a retreat destination often utilized by language, philosophy, writing, and religion courses. Baca Campus boasts a lodge, conference center, classroom, restaurant, and student townhouse facilities. Some courses will even spend an entire block immersed in an area of interest. These occur both domestically and internationally.\n\nAfter each block, students are rewarded with 4.5 days off. Most students head off campus, often involving some type of outdoor exploration.\n\nEvery student begins the Colorado College journey with a \"First Year Experience\" course, or FYE. This is a back-to-back block spanning 8 weeks and functions as a freshmen seminar course.\n\nStudents can also take blocks during winter and summer breaks. In January, the college offers \"half blocks,\" an intensive 10-day course fulfilling a half credit. Meanwhile, summer blocks are three weeks long, and there are also graduate blocks of differing lengths. In parallel with the students, professors teach only one block at a time. Classes are generally capped at 25 students to encourage a more personalized academic experience.\n\n===Admissions===\nColorado College is considered a \"most selective school\" by ''U.S. News & World Report''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/colorado-college-1347|title=Colorado College|year=2016|magazine=U.S. News & World Report}}</ref>\n\nFor the Class of 2023 (enrolled fall 2019), Colorado College received a record 9,454 applications (an increase of nearly 1,000 applicants over the Class of 2022) and admitted 13.5%, the lowest acceptance rate in the school's history, with 547 incoming students.<ref name=\"Welcome2023\"/> Students of color make up 27 percent of the incoming class, 15 percent are Pell Grant recipients, 9 percent first-generation students, and 9 percent international students.

A 'work hard, play hard' motto is commonly referenced on campus. However, 'play' for Colorado College students is distinctive. Many students share a thirst for outdoor exploration, and can be found hiking, biking, climbing, and skiing, among other things. Colorado College's proximity to the Rocky Mountains and several mountain resort communities create an ideal environment for these types of activities. Students are also active in community engagement activities to advance social justice and sustainability.\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Cutler Hall.JPG|thumbnail|left|Cutler Hall, located at 912 North Cascade Avenue, on the Colorado College campus, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

In 1944, [[KRCC]] began as a two-room public address system in the basement of Bemis Hall. Professor Woodson \"Chief\" Tyree, Director of Radio and Drama Department at Colorado College was the founder and inspirational force in the program that one day became KRCC-FM. In 1946, KRCC moved to South Hall (where Packard Hall now stands) on campus where two students, Charles \"Bud\" Edmonds '51, and Margaret Merle-Smith '51, were instrumental in securing a war surplus FM transmitter. KRCC began over the air broadcasting in April 1951 as the first non-commercial educational FM radio station in the state of Colorado.\n\nKRCC broadcasts through a series of eleven transmitters and translators throughout southern Colorado and a portion of northern New Mexico.  KRCC's main transmitter, atop [[Cheyenne Mountain]], broadcasts three separate HD multi-cast channels, including a channel run completely by Colorado College students called the SOCC (Sounds of Colorado College).\n\n==Notable people==\n{{see also| List of Colorado College people}}\n\n===Alumni===\nColorado College's alumni include a [[Nobel Prize]] winner, a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner, 2 [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellows]], 14 [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]], 31 [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholars]], and 68 [[Thomas J.

Keyless-Go is also an optional feature, as opposed to standard equipment. The GT is equipped with 19-inch wheels at the front and rear.\n\n===Mercedes-AMG GT S (2015\u2013present)===\nThe GT S is a more highly equipped variant of the Mercedes-AMG GT.

The key mechanical differences the GT S gains over the GT include an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, \"Race Mode\" and \"Race Start\" mode settings in the AMG Dynamic Select adaptive drivetrain system, AMG Ride Control adaptive suspensive system, an AMG Performance Exhaust System with dynamic flaps, and a lithium-ion battery. Keyless-Go is standard equipment, as is a staggered set of wheels (19-inch at the front, 20-inch at the rear).\n\n===Mercedes-AMG GT C (2017\u2013present)===\nThe GT C is a performance oriented variant of the Mercedes-AMG GT.

While the GT C retains the key mechanical differences the GT S gains over the GT, it also has a wider body ({{cvt|79|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}) and active rear steering, which the GT S does not have (even as options). In the United States, the Lane Tracking and AMG Dynamic Plus option packages are standard equipment on the GT C.\n\nA limited-edition model, the Edition 50, was released as part of the debut of the GT C variant at the [[Detroit Auto Show#2017|2017 Detroit Auto Show]]. The Edition 50 features: a choice of two shades of matte paint known as ''designo'' ''Graphite Grey Magno'' and ''designo Cashmere White Magno;'' black chrome exterior trim, headlight surrounds and forged / cross-spoke wheels; a two-tone silver pearl or black against grey quilted-leather interior which features a micro-suede wrapped steering wheel; and, \"Edition 50\" and \"1 of 500\" lettering on the steering wheel bezel and 12 o'clock mark in silver pearl.

As befitting of a high-performance variant, the GT R loses Keyless-Go, the integrated garage-door opener, the heated  and power-folding side mirrors, the auto-dimming interior and exterior mirrors and reverts to the basic light-weight 4-speaker audio system that the GT comes with.\n\nWhen it was launched, the GT R had several cosmetic changes compared with the standard car, notably the vertical slats in the front grille, an adjustable rear wing, new front air intakes and new front and rear diffusers. The styling of the GT R is more comparable to that of the AMG GT3 race car. However, the base GT variant gained several of these cosmetic changes as part of a mild facelift in the 2017 model year. The GT R went on sale in November 2016, with deliveries beginning in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topspeed.com/cars/mercedes/2018-mercedes-amg-gt-r-ar172305.html |title=2018 Mercedes-AMG GT R |publisher=Top Speed |date=2017-04-06 |accessdate=2018-08-04}}</ref>\n\nIt completed a lap of the [[N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife]] track in 7:10.92, in a test conducted by German magazine ''Sport Auto.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AtXzca-zSY |title=Mercedes-AMG GT R 7.10,92 min Nordschleife HOT LAP sport auto World's Exclusive First Test |publisher=YouTube |date=31 August 2016 |accessdate=4 August 2018}}</ref> hence earning it the seventh position for street legal vehicles in 2019.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA roadster version was introduced in March 2019 and would be limited to 750 units.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a26609170/2020-mercedes-amg-gt-r-roadster-photos-info/|title=The 2020 Mercedes-AMG GT R Roadster Is One Hair-Raising Car|work=[[Car and Driver]]|last=Wendler|first=Andrew|date=3 March 2019|accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Mercedes-AMG GT and GT C Roadster (2017\u2013present)===\n[[File:2016 LA Auto Show Mercedes AMG GT C Roadster.jpg|right|thumb|Mercedes-AMG GT C Roadster]]\n\nThe GT and GT C roadsters are the [[roadster (automobile)|roadster]] versions of the GT and GT C coup\u00e9s, and were announced shortly after the introduction of the GT R variant.<ref name=\"mercedes-benz2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/vehicles/passenger-cars/amg-gt/the-new-mercedes-amg-gt-roadster-and-mercedes-amg-gt-c-roadster/|title=The new Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster and Mercedes-AMG GT C Roadster.|date=14 September 2016|work=mercedes-benz.com|access-date=4 February 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Both variants made their debut at the [[2016 Paris Motor Show]].

The M178 engine in this variant is tuned to an output of {{cvt|350|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|465|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of torque, with the key differences between this and its more expensive siblings being a mechanical limited-slip differential, an absorbent glass mat battery, the lack of the \"Race Mode\" and \"Race Start\" mode settings in the AMG Dynamic Select adaptive drivetrain system, the lack of the AMG Ride Control adaptive suspensive system, and a passive AMG Sport Exhaust System. Keyless-Go is also an optional feature, as opposed to standard equipment. The GT is equipped with 19-inch wheels at the front and rear.\n\n===Mercedes-AMG GT S (2015\u2013present)===\nThe GT S is a more highly equipped variant of the Mercedes-AMG GT. The M178 engine in this variant is tuned to an output of {{cvt|385|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|495|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of torque. The key mechanical differences the GT S gains over the GT include an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, \"Race Mode\" and \"Race Start\" mode settings in the AMG Dynamic Select adaptive drivetrain system, AMG Ride Control adaptive suspensive system, an AMG Performance Exhaust System with dynamic flaps, and a lithium-ion battery. Keyless-Go is standard equipment, as is a staggered set of wheels (19-inch at the front, 20-inch at the rear).\n\n===Mercedes-AMG GT C (2017\u2013present)===\nThe GT C is a performance oriented variant of the Mercedes-AMG GT. The M178 engine in this variant is tuned to an output of {{cvt|415|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|502|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. While the GT C retains the key mechanical differences the GT S gains over the GT, it also has a wider body ({{cvt|79|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}) and active rear steering, which the GT S does not have (even as options). In the United States, the Lane Tracking and AMG Dynamic Plus option packages are standard equipment on the GT C.\n\nA limited-edition model, the Edition 50, was released as part of the debut of the GT C variant at the [[Detroit Auto Show#2017|2017 Detroit Auto Show]]. The Edition 50 features: a choice of two shades of matte paint known as ''designo'' ''Graphite Grey Magno'' and ''designo Cashmere White Magno;'' black chrome exterior trim, headlight surrounds and forged / cross-spoke wheels; a two-tone silver pearl or black against grey quilted-leather interior which features a micro-suede wrapped steering wheel; and, \"Edition 50\" and \"1 of 500\" lettering on the steering wheel bezel and 12 o'clock mark in silver pearl. In the United States, the Edition 50 is limited in production to 50 coupes and 50 roadsters. Globally, the Edition 50 is limited to 500 units, which explains the \"1 of 500\" on the steering wheel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pistonheads.com/news/mercedes/mercedes-amg-gt-c-edition-50-review/36717|title=Mercedes-AMG GT C Edition 50: Review {{!}} PistonHeads|website=www.pistonheads.com|access-date=2018-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/2018-mercedes-amg-gt-gt-c-gt-s-photos-and-info-news|title=2018 Mercedes-AMG GT / GT C / GT S Photos and Info \u2013 News \u2013 Car and Driver|work=Car and Driver|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"mercedes-benz1\"/>\n\n===Mercedes-AMG GT R (2017\u2013present)===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 200\n|image1= 2018 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT-R, designo matte Selenite Grey Magno, front right.jpg\n|image2= 2018 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT-R, designo matte Selenite Grey Magno, rear left.jpg\n|caption2= Mercedes-AMG GT R \n|image3= Mercedes-AMG GT R Roadster, GIMS 2019, Le Grand-Saconnex (GIMS0619).jpg\n|caption3= Mercedes-AMG GT R Roadster at Geneva International Motor Show 2019\n}}\n\nThe GT R is a high-performance variant of the Mercedes-AMG GT and was introduced at the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] on 24 June 2016. The M178 engine in this variant is tuned to an output of {{convert|430|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,250 rpm and {{convert|700|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 5,500 rpm.

As befitting of a high-performance variant, the GT R loses Keyless-Go, the integrated garage-door opener, the heated  and power-folding side mirrors, the auto-dimming interior and exterior mirrors and reverts to the basic light-weight 4-speaker audio system that the GT comes with.\n\nWhen it was launched, the GT R had several cosmetic changes compared with the standard car, notably the vertical slats in the front grille, an adjustable rear wing, new front air intakes and new front and rear diffusers. The styling of the GT R is more comparable to that of the AMG GT3 race car. However, the base GT variant gained several of these cosmetic changes as part of a mild facelift in the 2017 model year. The GT R went on sale in November 2016, with deliveries beginning in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topspeed.com/cars/mercedes/2018-mercedes-amg-gt-r-ar172305.html |title=2018 Mercedes-AMG GT R |publisher=Top Speed |date=2017-04-06 |accessdate=2018-08-04}}</ref>\n\nIt completed a lap of the [[N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife]] track in 7:10.92, in a test conducted by German magazine ''Sport Auto.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AtXzca-zSY |title=Mercedes-AMG GT R 7.10,92 min Nordschleife HOT LAP sport auto World's Exclusive First Test |publisher=YouTube |date=31 August 2016 |accessdate=4 August 2018}}</ref> hence earning it the seventh position for street legal vehicles in 2019.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA roadster version was introduced in March 2019 and would be limited to 750 units.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a26609170/2020-mercedes-amg-gt-r-roadster-photos-info/|title=The 2020 Mercedes-AMG GT R Roadster Is One Hair-Raising Car|work=[[Car and Driver]]|last=Wendler|first=Andrew|date=3 March 2019|accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Mercedes-AMG GT and GT C Roadster (2017\u2013present)===\n[[File:2016 LA Auto Show Mercedes AMG GT C Roadster.jpg|right|thumb|Mercedes-AMG GT C Roadster]]\n\nThe GT and GT C roadsters are the [[roadster (automobile)|roadster]] versions of the GT and GT C coup\u00e9s, and were announced shortly after the introduction of the GT R variant.<ref name=\"mercedes-benz2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/vehicles/passenger-cars/amg-gt/the-new-mercedes-amg-gt-roadster-and-mercedes-amg-gt-c-roadster/|title=The new Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster and Mercedes-AMG GT C Roadster.|date=14 September 2016|work=mercedes-benz.com|access-date=4 February 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Both variants made their debut at the [[2016 Paris Motor Show]].

Notable institutions and establishments in the city include the [[Asian Development Bank]], the headquarters of [[Banco De Oro]] and [[San Miguel Corporation]] and shopping malls like [[Shangri-La Plaza]] and [[SM Megamall]].\n\nThe city is bordered by Manila to the west, [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] to the north, [[Quezon City]] to the northeast, [[Pasig]] to the east, and [[Makati]] to the south. It is also the [[List of cities in the Philippines#List|6th-smallest city]] in the Philippines with a land area of {{convert|11.06|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Etymology==\nThere are different stories on the origin of the name ''Mandaluyong''.\n\nOne tells of how the place was abundant with a kind of tree called ''luyong'', now more commonly known as ''anahaw'' (''[[Saribus rotundifolius]]''<ref name=\"ERDB\">{{cite web | editor = Marcial C. Amaro Jr. | title = Anahaw | work = Some Familiar Philippine Palms that Produce High Food Value and Tikog | publisher = Ecosystems Research and Development Bureau of the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources | date = January\u2013April 2010 | url = http://erdb.denr.gov.ph/publications/rise/r_v22n1.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 1 April 2013 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130522064720/http://erdb.denr.gov.ph/publications/rise/r_v22n1.pdf| url-status =dead| archivedate =2013-05-22}}</ref>), from which canes and furniture were made.\n\nAnother claims that the Spaniards named the place based on the report of a navigator named Acapulco, who saw the rolling hills frequently being lashed at by ''daluyong'' (\u201cbig waves from the sea\u201d). {{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} This seems to confirm traditional pre-Hispanic stories that giant waves from the sea would meet the adjoining hills of the vast lowland, referred to as ''salpukan ng alon''. Felix dela Huerta, a [[Franciscan]] historian, observed that the rolling topography of this land resembled giant waves of the sea. As with the etymological legends of many Philippine places, when the foreigners asked as to what the place was called, the locals answered with the description \"''madaluyong''\" (\"undulating\"), later transcribed by Spanish writers into \"Mandaluyong\" with the addition of an \u201cn\u201d.\n\nRomantic residents, however, peddle the similarly formulaic legend of a [[Maharlika]] named Luyong who fell in love with Manda, the lovely daughter of a [[barangay]] chieftain. The chieftain had no personal liking for Luyong and forbade him Manda's hand. Luyong overcame this objection by winning a series of tribal contests which was the custom at the time. The couple settled thereafter in a place which was later called \u201cMandaluyong\" by means of [[portmanteau|joining their names]].<ref name=\"RidiculousEtymology\">{{Cite news |url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2019/09/22/murals-of-folklore-lovers-manda-luyong-brighten-shaw-blvd-flyover |title=Murals of folklore lovers \u2018Manda\u2019, \u2018Luyong\u2019 brighten Shaw Blvd flyover |access-date=2019-10-18 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==History<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mandaluyong.gov.ph/profile/history.aspx?node=1 |title=City of Mandaluyong : Brief History : Political History |publisher=Mandaluyong.gov.ph |date= |accessdate=2019-09-24}}</ref>==\n\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2018}}\n\n===14th century===\nResidents of Mandaluyong have always been known for their industry. Men did the laundry to the amusement of non-residents until shortly after the war, while the women ironed the clothes.\n\nThese industrious people trace their roots to Emperor Soledan (also known as \u201cAnka Widyaya\u201d of the Great Madjapahit Empire) and Empress Sasaban of the [[Namayan|Kingdom of Sapa]] whose son Prince Balagtas ruled as sovereign of the kingdom in about the year 1300.\n\nMore than a century later, in about the year 1470, it expanded and was called the \u201c[[Namayan|Kingdom of Namayan]]\u201d with \u201cLakan Takhan\u201d as sovereign. The vast Kingdom comprised what are now [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], [[San Miguel, Manila|San Miguel]], [[Santa Mesa, Manila|Sta, Mesa]], [[Paco, Manila|Paco]], [[Pandacan]], Malate, [[Manila|Malate]] and [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana]] in [[Manila]], and Mandaluyong, [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], [[Makati]], [[Pasay]], [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]], [[Taguig]], [[Para\u00f1aque]], and portions of [[Pasig]] and [[Quezon City]] up to [[Diliman]] that were then part of Mandaluyong.\n\n===19th century===\nMandaluyong was first known as a barrio of Santa Ana de Sapa which was part of the District of Paco, Province of Tondo. Named San Felipe Neri by the Spaniards in honor of the Patron Saint of [[Rome]], it was separated civilly from Santa Ana de Sapa in 1841.\n\nOn 15 September 1863 [[St. Philip Neri|San Felipe Neri]] established its own parish and under the administration of the Congregation \u201cDulc\u00edsimo Nombre de Jes\u00fas\u201d, it constructed its own church, convent and school.\n\nThe Parish of San Felipe Neri played a significant role as a relay station for propagating the Katipunan during the 1896\u20131898 Revolution.\n\nMandaluyong shows significance in the historic [[Philippine Revolution]] of 1896 as the baluarte (territory) of Katipunan or \"Makabuhay\" group with seventeen (17) branches.\n\nOn 29 August 1896, [[Andres Bonifacio]], together with [[Emilio Jacinto]] and other members of the [[Katipunan]] went into the house of Romualdo Vicencio at Sitio Balakbak (now Villa San Miguel) to prepare for the upcoming revolution against Spanish authority. In this site, Bonifacio read the last manifestation of the Katipunan before they transferred in Hagdan Bato, in the house of Felix Sanchez. This event is also known as the \"29 De Agosto\" and \"Pinagtipunan\" in which it is already named in two streets near the historic Barangay Hagdan Bato Itaas. It was in Barangay Hagdang Bato on 28 August 1896 where Andres Bonifacion issued a proclamation setting Saturday, 29 August 1896 as the date of the attack on Manila.\n\nOn 30 August 1896, after the successfully revolution in San Felipe Neri, the katipuneros went to San Juan del Monte and attacked the El Polvorin (gunpowder depot) in order to amass more weapons to use against the Spaniards. This event is popularly known as the [[Battle of San Juan del Monte]].\n\nIt was also in this town that the revolutionary paper, \u201cLa Republika\u201d, was established on 15 September 1896.\n\n===20th century===\nDuring the [[American Colonial Period (Philippines)|American Occupation]], San Felipe Neri was raised to a first class municipality with five (5) barrios, namely: Poblacion, Barangka, Hagdang Bato, Namayan and Hulo. Under Presidential Act No. 942, it was consolidated with the municipality of [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan del Monte]] and became the seat of government. For several months in 1904, San Felipe Neri became the capital of the province of [[Rizal Province|Rizal]].\n\nSan Felipe Neri was separated from San Juan and became an independent municipality on 27 March 1907. It was renamed the Municipality of Mandaluyong by virtue of House Bill No. 3836 which was authored and sponsored by Assemblyman Pedro Magsalin, then the Representative of the District of Rizal. Many government infrastructures are established during the American Period including the Correctional Institute for Women, Welfareville Compound, The Boy's Town, and the [[National Center for Mental Health]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Mandaluyong lost many of her people; among them were Catholic priests and civilians. Destruction was felt all over, but with the timely arrival of the American Liberation Forces and the Philippine Commonwealth troops on 9 February 1945, the municipality was saved from further damages. That day became a red calendar day for Mandaluyong marking its liberation from the Japanese Imperial forces by the Allies.\n\nAfter World War II, Mandaluyong began to become progressive and dramatically increase the economy. Many infrastructures, companies, and other businesses were developed in 1950s\u20131960s and as the result, Mandaluyong recognized as the most developed municipality in the Province of Rizal.\n\n====Separation from Rizal province====\n\nOn 7 November 1975, Mandaluyong was formally included in newly established Metropolitan Manila by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 824<ref>\"{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.ph/1975/11/07/presidential-decree-no-824-s-1975/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809192631/http://www.gov.ph/1975/11/07/presidential-decree-no-824-s-1975/ |archivedate=9 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}\"</ref> signed by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].\n\nBy virture of the 1987 Constitution Mandaluyong and the then municipality of San Juan were represented in congress by a single Congressman.\n\n====Cityhood====\nRep.

Ramos]] signed R.A. No. 7675 into law on 9 February 1994 (the 49th anniversary of its liberation from the Japanese), which was ratified through a plebiscite on 10 April 1994 making Mandaluyong the 5th city in [[Metro Manila]]. Mandaluyong became a lone district with its own Representative in Congress. Prior to the enactment of the assailed statute, the municipalities of Mandaluyong and San Juan belonged to only one legislative district.\n\n===21st century===\n\nMandaluyong today is composed of 27 barangays divided into two political districts mainly by Boni Avenue and G. Aglipay Street. As of 9 January 2002, it has 1,238 voting precincts and a total of 166,037 registered voters.\n\nIn 2003, Mandaluyong was recognized as \"The Tiger City of the Philippines\" because of dramatic improvement in the city's economy. {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nIn 2020, the city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==History of local barrios==\n\nAccording to Pedro Patricio in his book (Mandaluyong: 1837\u20131975<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elib.gov.ph/details.php?uid=a5f44949e8126bf8b90715cf7e41c083 |title=Philippine eLib |publisher=Elib.gov.ph |date=2008-06-16 |accessdate=2019-09-24}}</ref>), Mandaluyong had five original barrios (Poblacion, Barangka, Hagdang Bato, Namayan, & Hulo) as per the first recorded census in 1903.\n\nFrom these five evolved 22 sub-barrios which, like the original barrios, then became independent barangays.\n\n===Poblacion===\nThis place used to be called \u201cBuhangin\u201d (sand) before it was named Poblacion because the whole stretch of the area, from F. Blumentritt corner of New Panaderos Extension up until the Catholic Church and the cemetery, was topped with sandy soil of about 2\u20133 inches thick.\n\n===Namayan===\nThe first settlers of this place were Muslim Filipinos. They were later driven away by the Spanish colonizers who came to the place. Still unnamed till then, the inhabitants called it \u201cNamayan\u201d in memory of the original settlers of the place.\n\n===Hulo (San Pedrillo)===\nHulo means \u201couter part\u201d or \u201cexternal\u201d location of a barrio or town. When Barangka was still a sloping forest, Hulo was already a sitio with a few inhabitants. Early inhabitants of Mandaluyong used to call the place as such because of its remoteness of location. This place continued to be called as such until the name was officially adopted when it eventually became a barrio.\n\n===Buayang Bato===\nLocated at the southeast shoreline of Mandaluyong is a small barangay called Buayang Bato. Its legend tells of an old Chinese man long time ago who, despite conversion to Christianity of his fellow Chinese nationals residing in this place, ridicules the religion.\n\nOne day, while the old man was on a boat crossing the Pasig River, the Devil decided to take him to hell. Transforming into a crocodile, the Devil swam towards the boat. The old man, who had never seen such a huge crocodile, was terribly shaken. Realizing that the god he worships is too far away in China, he began to call on Saint Nicholas, whose statue he saw in Guadalupe Church across the Pasig River, to save him.\n\nMiraculously, the creature turned into a stone. Shortly after, the old man embraced Christianity. And the stone crocodile, it is said, could be found during low tide at the bank of the river near the Tawiran (ferry station). The place came to be known because of this stone crocodile, \u201cbuayang bato\u201d in Filipino.\n\n===Barangka===\nAlongside Barangay Buayang Bato is Barangka, then a single barangay but later divided into four (4) during the time of Municipal Mayor Bonifacio Javier: Barangka Ilaya (Uptown), Barangka Itaas (Upper) Barangka Ibaba (Lower), and Barangka Drive.\n\nIt was said that at the time when the Philippines was under the Spanish Regime, there lived an old woman named Barang who had a young daughter. The daughter was in the rice fields when she was attacked by a man. As she was calling her mother for help \u201cKa Barang, Ka Barang!\u201d the surrounding hills echoed her cry which was heard by the Spaniards. And as the story goes, the place came to be called Barangka.\n\n===Hagdang Bato===\nThis place is located on the uplands where steps are carved in its rocky hills and used as stairways. However, this place is better known for its historical significance because of the role it played during the Spanish occupation.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIt was in this place, where, on 28 August 1896, Andres Bonifacio issued a proclamation setting Saturday, 29 August, as the date of the attack on Manila. At 7:00 o\u2019clock on Saturday evening, Supremo Andres Bonifacio held a meeting which was attended by more or less 1000 \u201cKatipuneros\u201d. Weapons were distributed during this meeting and the revolution began as church bells tolled.\n\n===Zaniga===\nLying on the lowlands adjoining Hagdang Bato is Saniga which used to be a marshland teeming with various fruit-bearing and hardwood trees. The place was home to many local heroes who gallantly fought during the Spanish, American and Japanese occupations. Thus, some of its streets are named after them like Capt. Magtoto St., Capt. Gabriel St., and Pvt. E. Reyes St.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, progress gave way to concrete roads and houses sprouted in neighboring areas. This neighborhood was called New Zaniga Subdivision, while the original Saniga was renamed Old Zaniga.\n\n===Plainview===\nAs the name implies, this place is a vast plain used to be planted with rice and corn. The place abounded with trees and was popular to bird hunters. Once it was a private property developed by its owner, Ortigas, Madrigal and Company, into a subdivision providing a site for the municipal center. Afterwards, it was made a separate barangay through a Presidential Decree. Its original name, Plainview, was retained and at present, it hosts the Mandaluyong City Hall and other public institutions.\n\n===Wack-Wack===\nAt the northern part of the city is Barangay Wack-Wack, known internationally for the Golf and Country Club it hosts. Stories tell that many years ago, the place was a vast grassland which was home to numerous large glossy black birds called \u201cuwak\u201d (crow). It was from this \u201cuwak\u201d that the name \u201cWack-Wack\u201d was derived.\n\n==Geography==\n\nMandaluyong lies on a heart-shaped<ref>{{cite web |title=City of Mandaluyong : Introduction : Land Area |url=http://www.mandaluyong.gov.ph/profile/introduction.aspx?node=1 |website=www.mandaluyong.gov.ph |publisher=City of Mandaluyong |accessdate=28 December 2015}}</ref> {{convert|11.06|km2}}<ref name=\"arearef1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mbc.com.ph/engine/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Solidum-Update-of-Earthquake-Hazards-and-Risk-Assessment-of-MMla-14Nov2013.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624134051/http://www.mbc.com.ph/engine/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Solidum-Update-of-Earthquake-Hazards-and-Risk-Assessment-of-MMla-14Nov2013.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 June 2016 |title=An Update on the Earthquake Hazards and Risk Assessment of Greater Metropolitan Manila Area |publisher=[[Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology]] |date=14 November 2013 |accessdate=16 May 2016 }}</ref><ref name=\"arearef2\">{{cite web |url=http://ndrrmc.gov.ph/attachments/article/1509/Component_5_Earthquake_Risk_Analysis_Technical%20Report_-_Final_Draft_by_GA_and_PHIVOLCS.pdf |title=Enhancing Risk Analysis Capacities for Flood, Tropical Cyclone Severe Wind and Earthquake for the Greater Metro Manila Area Component 5 \u2013 Earthquake Risk Analysis |publisher=[[Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology]] and [[Geoscience Australia]] |accessdate=16 May 2016}}</ref> of land, {{convert|7|km}} southeast of Manila and {{convert|8|km}} west of Pasig.

Notable institutions and establishments in the city include the [[Asian Development Bank]], the headquarters of [[Banco De Oro]] and [[San Miguel Corporation]] and shopping malls like [[Shangri-La Plaza]] and [[SM Megamall]].\n\nThe city is bordered by Manila to the west, [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] to the north, [[Quezon City]] to the northeast, [[Pasig]] to the east, and [[Makati]] to the south. It is also the [[List of cities in the Philippines#List|6th-smallest city]] in the Philippines with a land area of {{convert|11.06|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Etymology==\nThere are different stories on the origin of the name ''Mandaluyong''.\n\nOne tells of how the place was abundant with a kind of tree called ''luyong'', now more commonly known as ''anahaw'' (''[[Saribus rotundifolius]]''<ref name=\"ERDB\">{{cite web | editor = Marcial C.

Felix dela Huerta, a [[Franciscan]] historian, observed that the rolling topography of this land resembled giant waves of the sea. As with the etymological legends of many Philippine places, when the foreigners asked as to what the place was called, the locals answered with the description \"''madaluyong''\" (\"undulating\"), later transcribed by Spanish writers into \"Mandaluyong\" with the addition of an \u201cn\u201d.\n\nRomantic residents, however, peddle the similarly formulaic legend of a [[Maharlika]] named Luyong who fell in love with Manda, the lovely daughter of a [[barangay]] chieftain. The chieftain had no personal liking for Luyong and forbade him Manda's hand. Luyong overcame this objection by winning a series of tribal contests which was the custom at the time. The couple settled thereafter in a place which was later called \u201cMandaluyong\" by means of [[portmanteau|joining their names]].<ref name=\"RidiculousEtymology\">{{Cite news |url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2019/09/22/murals-of-folklore-lovers-manda-luyong-brighten-shaw-blvd-flyover |title=Murals of folklore lovers \u2018Manda\u2019, \u2018Luyong\u2019 brighten Shaw Blvd flyover |access-date=2019-10-18 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==History<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mandaluyong.gov.ph/profile/history.aspx?node=1 |title=City of Mandaluyong : Brief History : Political History |publisher=Mandaluyong.gov.ph |date= |accessdate=2019-09-24}}</ref>==\n\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2018}}\n\n===14th century===\nResidents of Mandaluyong have always been known for their industry. Men did the laundry to the amusement of non-residents until shortly after the war, while the women ironed the clothes.\n\nThese industrious people trace their roots to Emperor Soledan (also known as \u201cAnka Widyaya\u201d of the Great Madjapahit Empire) and Empress Sasaban of the [[Namayan|Kingdom of Sapa]] whose son Prince Balagtas ruled as sovereign of the kingdom in about the year 1300.\n\nMore than a century later, in about the year 1470, it expanded and was called the \u201c[[Namayan|Kingdom of Namayan]]\u201d with \u201cLakan Takhan\u201d as sovereign. The vast Kingdom comprised what are now [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], [[San Miguel, Manila|San Miguel]], [[Santa Mesa, Manila|Sta, Mesa]], [[Paco, Manila|Paco]], [[Pandacan]], Malate, [[Manila|Malate]] and [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana]] in [[Manila]], and Mandaluyong, [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], [[Makati]], [[Pasay]], [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]], [[Taguig]], [[Para\u00f1aque]], and portions of [[Pasig]] and [[Quezon City]] up to [[Diliman]] that were then part of Mandaluyong.\n\n===19th century===\nMandaluyong was first known as a barrio of Santa Ana de Sapa which was part of the District of Paco, Province of Tondo. Named San Felipe Neri by the Spaniards in honor of the Patron Saint of [[Rome]], it was separated civilly from Santa Ana de Sapa in 1841.\n\nOn 15 September 1863 [[St. Philip Neri|San Felipe Neri]] established its own parish and under the administration of the Congregation \u201cDulc\u00edsimo Nombre de Jes\u00fas\u201d, it constructed its own church, convent and school.\n\nThe Parish of San Felipe Neri played a significant role as a relay station for propagating the Katipunan during the 1896\u20131898 Revolution.\n\nMandaluyong shows significance in the historic [[Philippine Revolution]] of 1896 as the baluarte (territory) of Katipunan or \"Makabuhay\" group with seventeen (17) branches.\n\nOn 29 August 1896, [[Andres Bonifacio]], together with [[Emilio Jacinto]] and other members of the [[Katipunan]] went into the house of Romualdo Vicencio at Sitio Balakbak (now Villa San Miguel) to prepare for the upcoming revolution against Spanish authority. In this site, Bonifacio read the last manifestation of the Katipunan before they transferred in Hagdan Bato, in the house of Felix Sanchez. This event is also known as the \"29 De Agosto\" and \"Pinagtipunan\" in which it is already named in two streets near the historic Barangay Hagdan Bato Itaas. It was in Barangay Hagdang Bato on 28 August 1896 where Andres Bonifacion issued a proclamation setting Saturday, 29 August 1896 as the date of the attack on Manila.\n\nOn 30 August 1896, after the successfully revolution in San Felipe Neri, the katipuneros went to San Juan del Monte and attacked the El Polvorin (gunpowder depot) in order to amass more weapons to use against the Spaniards. This event is popularly known as the [[Battle of San Juan del Monte]].\n\nIt was also in this town that the revolutionary paper, \u201cLa Republika\u201d, was established on 15 September 1896.\n\n===20th century===\nDuring the [[American Colonial Period (Philippines)|American Occupation]], San Felipe Neri was raised to a first class municipality with five (5) barrios, namely: Poblacion, Barangka, Hagdang Bato, Namayan and Hulo. Under Presidential Act No. 942, it was consolidated with the municipality of [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan del Monte]] and became the seat of government. For several months in 1904, San Felipe Neri became the capital of the province of [[Rizal Province|Rizal]].\n\nSan Felipe Neri was separated from San Juan and became an independent municipality on 27 March 1907. It was renamed the Municipality of Mandaluyong by virtue of House Bill No. 3836 which was authored and sponsored by Assemblyman Pedro Magsalin, then the Representative of the District of Rizal. Many government infrastructures are established during the American Period including the Correctional Institute for Women, Welfareville Compound, The Boy's Town, and the [[National Center for Mental Health]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Mandaluyong lost many of her people; among them were Catholic priests and civilians. Destruction was felt all over, but with the timely arrival of the American Liberation Forces and the Philippine Commonwealth troops on 9 February 1945, the municipality was saved from further damages. That day became a red calendar day for Mandaluyong marking its liberation from the Japanese Imperial forces by the Allies.\n\nAfter World War II, Mandaluyong began to become progressive and dramatically increase the economy. Many infrastructures, companies, and other businesses were developed in 1950s\u20131960s and as the result, Mandaluyong recognized as the most developed municipality in the Province of Rizal.\n\n====Separation from Rizal province====\n\nOn 7 November 1975, Mandaluyong was formally included in newly established Metropolitan Manila by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 824<ref>\"{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.ph/1975/11/07/presidential-decree-no-824-s-1975/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809192631/http://www.gov.ph/1975/11/07/presidential-decree-no-824-s-1975/ |archivedate=9 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}\"</ref> signed by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].\n\nBy virture of the 1987 Constitution Mandaluyong and the then municipality of San Juan were represented in congress by a single Congressman.\n\n====Cityhood====\nRep.

Ramos]] signed R.A. No. 7675 into law on 9 February 1994 (the 49th anniversary of its liberation from the Japanese), which was ratified through a plebiscite on 10 April 1994 making Mandaluyong the 5th city in [[Metro Manila]]. Mandaluyong became a lone district with its own Representative in Congress. Prior to the enactment of the assailed statute, the municipalities of Mandaluyong and San Juan belonged to only one legislative district.\n\n===21st century===\n\nMandaluyong today is composed of 27 barangays divided into two political districts mainly by Boni Avenue and G. Aglipay Street. As of 9 January 2002, it has 1,238 voting precincts and a total of 166,037 registered voters.\n\nIn 2003, Mandaluyong was recognized as \"The Tiger City of the Philippines\" because of dramatic improvement in the city's economy. {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nIn 2020, the city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==History of local barrios==\n\nAccording to Pedro Patricio in his book (Mandaluyong: 1837\u20131975<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elib.gov.ph/details.php?uid=a5f44949e8126bf8b90715cf7e41c083 |title=Philippine eLib |publisher=Elib.gov.ph |date=2008-06-16 |accessdate=2019-09-24}}</ref>), Mandaluyong had five original barrios (Poblacion, Barangka, Hagdang Bato, Namayan, & Hulo) as per the first recorded census in 1903.\n\nFrom these five evolved 22 sub-barrios which, like the original barrios, then became independent barangays.\n\n===Poblacion===\nThis place used to be called \u201cBuhangin\u201d (sand) before it was named Poblacion because the whole stretch of the area, from F. Blumentritt corner of New Panaderos Extension up until the Catholic Church and the cemetery, was topped with sandy soil of about 2\u20133 inches thick.\n\n===Namayan===\nThe first settlers of this place were Muslim Filipinos. They were later driven away by the Spanish colonizers who came to the place. Still unnamed till then, the inhabitants called it \u201cNamayan\u201d in memory of the original settlers of the place.\n\n===Hulo (San Pedrillo)===\nHulo means \u201couter part\u201d or \u201cexternal\u201d location of a barrio or town. When Barangka was still a sloping forest, Hulo was already a sitio with a few inhabitants. Early inhabitants of Mandaluyong used to call the place as such because of its remoteness of location. This place continued to be called as such until the name was officially adopted when it eventually became a barrio.\n\n===Buayang Bato===\nLocated at the southeast shoreline of Mandaluyong is a small barangay called Buayang Bato. Its legend tells of an old Chinese man long time ago who, despite conversion to Christianity of his fellow Chinese nationals residing in this place, ridicules the religion.\n\nOne day, while the old man was on a boat crossing the Pasig River, the Devil decided to take him to hell. Transforming into a crocodile, the Devil swam towards the boat. The old man, who had never seen such a huge crocodile, was terribly shaken. Realizing that the god he worships is too far away in China, he began to call on Saint Nicholas, whose statue he saw in Guadalupe Church across the Pasig River, to save him.\n\nMiraculously, the creature turned into a stone. Shortly after, the old man embraced Christianity. And the stone crocodile, it is said, could be found during low tide at the bank of the river near the Tawiran (ferry station). The place came to be known because of this stone crocodile, \u201cbuayang bato\u201d in Filipino.\n\n===Barangka===\nAlongside Barangay Buayang Bato is Barangka, then a single barangay but later divided into four (4) during the time of Municipal Mayor Bonifacio Javier: Barangka Ilaya (Uptown), Barangka Itaas (Upper) Barangka Ibaba (Lower), and Barangka Drive.\n\nIt was said that at the time when the Philippines was under the Spanish Regime, there lived an old woman named Barang who had a young daughter. The daughter was in the rice fields when she was attacked by a man. As she was calling her mother for help \u201cKa Barang, Ka Barang!\u201d the surrounding hills echoed her cry which was heard by the Spaniards. And as the story goes, the place came to be called Barangka.\n\n===Hagdang Bato===\nThis place is located on the uplands where steps are carved in its rocky hills and used as stairways. However, this place is better known for its historical significance because of the role it played during the Spanish occupation.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIt was in this place, where, on 28 August 1896, Andres Bonifacio issued a proclamation setting Saturday, 29 August, as the date of the attack on Manila. At 7:00 o\u2019clock on Saturday evening, Supremo Andres Bonifacio held a meeting which was attended by more or less 1000 \u201cKatipuneros\u201d. Weapons were distributed during this meeting and the revolution began as church bells tolled.\n\n===Zaniga===\nLying on the lowlands adjoining Hagdang Bato is Saniga which used to be a marshland teeming with various fruit-bearing and hardwood trees. The place was home to many local heroes who gallantly fought during the Spanish, American and Japanese occupations. Thus, some of its streets are named after them like Capt. Magtoto St., Capt. Gabriel St., and Pvt. E. Reyes St.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, progress gave way to concrete roads and houses sprouted in neighboring areas. This neighborhood was called New Zaniga Subdivision, while the original Saniga was renamed Old Zaniga.\n\n===Plainview===\nAs the name implies, this place is a vast plain used to be planted with rice and corn. The place abounded with trees and was popular to bird hunters. Once it was a private property developed by its owner, Ortigas, Madrigal and Company, into a subdivision providing a site for the municipal center. Afterwards, it was made a separate barangay through a Presidential Decree. Its original name, Plainview, was retained and at present, it hosts the Mandaluyong City Hall and other public institutions.\n\n===Wack-Wack===\nAt the northern part of the city is Barangay Wack-Wack, known internationally for the Golf and Country Club it hosts. Stories tell that many years ago, the place was a vast grassland which was home to numerous large glossy black birds called \u201cuwak\u201d (crow). It was from this \u201cuwak\u201d that the name \u201cWack-Wack\u201d was derived.\n\n==Geography==\n\nMandaluyong lies on a heart-shaped<ref>{{cite web |title=City of Mandaluyong : Introduction : Land Area |url=http://www.mandaluyong.gov.ph/profile/introduction.aspx?node=1 |website=www.mandaluyong.gov.ph |publisher=City of Mandaluyong |accessdate=28 December 2015}}</ref> {{convert|11.06|km2}}<ref name=\"arearef1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mbc.com.ph/engine/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Solidum-Update-of-Earthquake-Hazards-and-Risk-Assessment-of-MMla-14Nov2013.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624134051/http://www.mbc.com.ph/engine/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Solidum-Update-of-Earthquake-Hazards-and-Risk-Assessment-of-MMla-14Nov2013.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 June 2016 |title=An Update on the Earthquake Hazards and Risk Assessment of Greater Metropolitan Manila Area |publisher=[[Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology]] |date=14 November 2013 |accessdate=16 May 2016 }}</ref><ref name=\"arearef2\">{{cite web |url=http://ndrrmc.gov.ph/attachments/article/1509/Component_5_Earthquake_Risk_Analysis_Technical%20Report_-_Final_Draft_by_GA_and_PHIVOLCS.pdf |title=Enhancing Risk Analysis Capacities for Flood, Tropical Cyclone Severe Wind and Earthquake for the Greater Metro Manila Area Component 5 \u2013 Earthquake Risk Analysis |publisher=[[Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology]] and [[Geoscience Australia]] |accessdate=16 May 2016}}</ref> of land, {{convert|7|km}} southeast of Manila and {{convert|8|km}} west of Pasig.

Although prominent in the manufacture of foods, medicines and laboratory equipment, these industries are gradually declining in number, opting to relocate in newly developed industrial zones outside Metropolitan Manila. In the [[Pasig River]] area, particularly in Barangays Namayan and Mabini J. Rizal, areas formerly industrial are now the sites for residential subdivisions and townhouses. In the EDSA-Shaw-Pioneer area, the transformation is toward a more economically profitable and globally competitive commercial activity. And since December 2013, Mandaluyong is the home of one of the largest television networks in the country, [[The 5 Network]] (owned by [[TV5 Network]] located at the [[TV5 Media Center]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mandaluyong.gov.ph/profile/economy.aspx|title=Industrial Activities |accessdate=9 February 2014 |publisher=City Government of Mandaluyong}}</ref>\n\n===Shopping centers===\nThese super-regional supermalls each have over a hundred local and international stores and are anchored by at least one department store and supermarket or hypermarket. They are also the largest malls in Metro Manila which feature not just stores but also attractions: movie theaters, rides, skating rinks, bowling alleys and other recreational facilities. Each provides thousands of automobile parking spaces and are located mostly near [[List of Manila LRT and MRT stations|rail stations]] and established [[business district]]s within the metropolis.
