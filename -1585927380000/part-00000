Though he borrows many, Virgil gives Aeneas two epithets of his own in the ''Aeneid:'' ''pater'' and ''pius''. The epithets applied by Virgil are an example of an attitude different from that of Homer, for whilst Odysseus is ''poikilios'' (\"wily\"), Aeneas is described as ''pius'' (\"pious\"), which conveys a strong moral tone. The purpose of these epithets seems to enforce the notion of Aeneas' divine hand as father and founder of the Roman race, and their use seems circumstantial: when Aeneas is praying he refers to himself as pius, and is referred to as such by the author only when the character is acting on behalf of the gods to fulfill his divine mission. Likewise, Aeneas is called ''pater'' when acting in the interest of his men.<ref>Milman Parry (Author), Adam Parry (Editor), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cbvyswUgSnEC&lpg=PA169&ots=9KObiMHxbR&dq=aeneas%20epithets&pg=PA169#v=onepage&q&f=false The Making of Homeric Verse: The Collected Papers of Milman Parry]'' (1971) p.169</ref>\n\n==Greek myth and epos==\n\n===Homeric ''Hymn to Aphrodite''===\n[[File:William Blake Richmond - Venus and Anchises - Google Art Project.jpg|upright=1.5|Painting ''Venus and Anchises'' by [[William Blake Richmond]] (1889 or 1890)|thumb]]\n\nThe story of the birth of Aeneas is told in the \"Hymn to Aphrodite\", one of the major [[Homeric Hymns]]. Aphrodite has caused [[Zeus]] to fall in love with mortal women. In retaliation, Zeus puts desire in her heart for Anchises, who is tending his cattle among the hills near [[Mount Ida (Turkey)|Mount Ida]]. When Aphrodite sees him she is smitten. She adorns herself as if for a wedding among the gods and appears before him. He is overcome by her beauty, believing that she is a goddess, but Aphrodite identifies herself as a [[Phrygia]]n princess. After they make love, Aphrodite reveals her true identity to him and Anchises fears what might happen to him as a result of their liaison. Aphrodite assures him that he will be protected, and tells him that she will bear him a son to be called Aeneas. However, she warns him that he must never tell anyone that he has lain with a goddess. When Aeneas is born, Aphrodite takes him to the [[nymph]]s of Mount Ida. She directs them to raise the child to age five, then take him to Anchises.<ref>\"Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite.\" trans by Gregory Nagy, University of Houston.</ref> According to other sources, Anchises later brags about his encounter with Aphrodite, and as a result is struck in the foot with a thunderbolt by Zeus.

Aphrodite and Apollo rescue Aeneas from combat with [[Diomedes]] of [[Argos]], who nearly kills him, and carry him away to [[Pergamos]] for healing. Even [[Poseidon]], who normally favors the Greeks, comes to Aeneas's rescue after he falls under the assault of [[Achilles]], noting that Aeneas, though from a junior branch of the royal family, is destined to become king of the Trojan people.

Aeneas, after being commanded by the gods to flee, gathered a group, collectively known as the [[Aeneads]], who then traveled to [[Italy]] and became progenitors of [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The Aeneads included Aeneas's trumpeter [[Misenus]], his father [[Anchises]], his friends [[Achates]], [[Sergestus]], and [[Acmon, the Aenead|Acmon]], the healer [[Iapyx]], the helmsman [[Palinurus]], and his son [[Ascanius]] (also known as Iulus, Julus, or Ascanius Julius). He carried with him the [[Lares]] and [[Penates]], the statues of the household gods of Troy, and transplanted them to Italy.\n\nSeveral attempts to find a new home failed; one such stop was on [[Sicily]], where in [[Trapani|Drepanum]], on the island's western coast, his father, Anchises, died peacefully.\n\n[[File:Gu\u00e9rin \u00c9n\u00e9e racontant \u00e0 Didon les malheurs de la ville de Troie Louvre 5184.jpg|thumb|right|Aeneas tells Dido about the fall of Troy, by [[Pierre-Narcisse Gu\u00e9rin]]]]\n\nAfter a brief but fierce storm sent up against the group at [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]'s request, Aeneas and his fleet made landfall at [[Carthage]] after six years of wanderings.  Aeneas had a year-long affair with the Carthaginian queen [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] (also known as Elissa), who proposed that the Trojans settle in her land and that she and Aeneas reign jointly over their peoples. A marriage of sorts was arranged between Dido and Aeneas at the instigation of Juno, who was told that her favorite city would eventually be defeated by the Trojans' descendants. Aeneas's mother [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] (the Roman adaptation of Aphrodite) realized that her son and his company needed a temporary respite to reinforce themselves for the journey to come. However, the messenger god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] was sent by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and Venus to remind Aeneas of his journey and his purpose, compelling him to leave secretly. When Dido learned of this, she uttered a curse that would forever pit Carthage against Rome, an enmity that would culminate in the [[Punic Wars]]. She then committed suicide by stabbing herself with the same sword she gave Aeneas when they first met.\n\nAfter the sojourn in Carthage, the Trojans returned to Sicily where Aeneas organized [[funeral games (antiquity)|funeral games]] to honor his father, who had died a year before. The company traveled on and landed on the western coast of Italy. Aeneas descended into the underworld where he met Dido (who turned away from him to return to her husband) and his father, who showed him the future of his descendants and thus the history of Rome.\n\n[[File:Aeneas and Turnus.jpg|thumb|left|Aeneas defeats [[Turnus]], by [[Luca Giordano]], 1634\u20131705.

His daughter [[Lavinia]] had been promised to [[Turnus]], king of the [[Rutuli]], but Latinus received a prophecy that Lavinia would be betrothed to one from another land \u2013 namely, Aeneas. Latinus heeded the prophecy, and Turnus consequently declared war on Aeneas at the urging of Juno, who was aligned with King [[Mezentius]] of [[Etruscan civilization|the Etruscans]] and Queen [[Amata]] of the Latins. Aeneas's forces prevailed. Turnus was killed, and Virgil's account ends abruptly.\n\n===Other sources===\nThe rest of Aeneas's biography is gleaned from other ancient sources, including Livy and Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''. According to Livy, Aeneas was victorious but Latinus died in the war. Aeneas founded the city of [[Lavinium]], named after his wife. He later welcomed Dido's sister, [[Anna Perenna]], who then committed suicide after learning of Lavinia's jealousy. After Aeneas's death, Venus asked Jupiter to make her son immortal. Jupiter agreed. The river god [[Numicus]] cleansed Aeneas of all his mortal parts and Venus anointed him with ambrosia and nectar, making him a god. Aeneas was recognized as the god [[Jupiter Indiges]].<ref>Titus Livius. [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy01.html  ''The History of Rome''] (Rev. Canon Roberts, trans.), Vol. I, J. M.

Though he borrows many, Virgil gives Aeneas two epithets of his own in the ''Aeneid:'' ''pater'' and ''pius''. The epithets applied by Virgil are an example of an attitude different from that of Homer, for whilst Odysseus is ''poikilios'' (\"wily\"), Aeneas is described as ''pius'' (\"pious\"), which conveys a strong moral tone. The purpose of these epithets seems to enforce the notion of Aeneas' divine hand as father and founder of the Roman race, and their use seems circumstantial: when Aeneas is praying he refers to himself as pius, and is referred to as such by the author only when the character is acting on behalf of the gods to fulfill his divine mission. Likewise, Aeneas is called ''pater'' when acting in the interest of his men.<ref>Milman Parry (Author), Adam Parry (Editor), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cbvyswUgSnEC&lpg=PA169&ots=9KObiMHxbR&dq=aeneas%20epithets&pg=PA169#v=onepage&q&f=false The Making of Homeric Verse: The Collected Papers of Milman Parry]'' (1971) p.169</ref>\n\n==Greek myth and epos==\n\n===Homeric ''Hymn to Aphrodite''===\n[[File:William Blake Richmond - Venus and Anchises - Google Art Project.jpg|upright=1.5|Painting ''Venus and Anchises'' by [[William Blake Richmond]] (1889 or 1890)|thumb]]\n\nThe story of the birth of Aeneas is told in the \"Hymn to Aphrodite\", one of the major [[Homeric Hymns]]. Aphrodite has caused [[Zeus]] to fall in love with mortal women. In retaliation, Zeus puts desire in her heart for Anchises, who is tending his cattle among the hills near [[Mount Ida (Turkey)|Mount Ida]]. When Aphrodite sees him she is smitten. She adorns herself as if for a wedding among the gods and appears before him. He is overcome by her beauty, believing that she is a goddess, but Aphrodite identifies herself as a [[Phrygia]]n princess. After they make love, Aphrodite reveals her true identity to him and Anchises fears what might happen to him as a result of their liaison. Aphrodite assures him that he will be protected, and tells him that she will bear him a son to be called Aeneas. However, she warns him that he must never tell anyone that he has lain with a goddess. When Aeneas is born, Aphrodite takes him to the [[nymph]]s of Mount Ida. She directs them to raise the child to age five, then take him to Anchises.<ref>\"Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite.\" trans by Gregory Nagy, University of Houston.</ref> According to other sources, Anchises later brags about his encounter with Aphrodite, and as a result is struck in the foot with a thunderbolt by Zeus.

Aeneas, after being commanded by the gods to flee, gathered a group, collectively known as the [[Aeneads]], who then traveled to [[Italy]] and became progenitors of [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The Aeneads included Aeneas's trumpeter [[Misenus]], his father [[Anchises]], his friends [[Achates]], [[Sergestus]], and [[Acmon, the Aenead|Acmon]], the healer [[Iapyx]], the helmsman [[Palinurus]], and his son [[Ascanius]] (also known as Iulus, Julus, or Ascanius Julius). He carried with him the [[Lares]] and [[Penates]], the statues of the household gods of Troy, and transplanted them to Italy.\n\nSeveral attempts to find a new home failed; one such stop was on [[Sicily]], where in [[Trapani|Drepanum]], on the island's western coast, his father, Anchises, died peacefully.\n\n[[File:Gu\u00e9rin \u00c9n\u00e9e racontant \u00e0 Didon les malheurs de la ville de Troie Louvre 5184.jpg|thumb|right|Aeneas tells Dido about the fall of Troy, by [[Pierre-Narcisse Gu\u00e9rin]]]]\n\nAfter a brief but fierce storm sent up against the group at [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]'s request, Aeneas and his fleet made landfall at [[Carthage]] after six years of wanderings.  Aeneas had a year-long affair with the Carthaginian queen [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] (also known as Elissa), who proposed that the Trojans settle in her land and that she and Aeneas reign jointly over their peoples. A marriage of sorts was arranged between Dido and Aeneas at the instigation of Juno, who was told that her favorite city would eventually be defeated by the Trojans' descendants. Aeneas's mother [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] (the Roman adaptation of Aphrodite) realized that her son and his company needed a temporary respite to reinforce themselves for the journey to come. However, the messenger god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] was sent by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and Venus to remind Aeneas of his journey and his purpose, compelling him to leave secretly. When Dido learned of this, she uttered a curse that would forever pit Carthage against Rome, an enmity that would culminate in the [[Punic Wars]]. She then committed suicide by stabbing herself with the same sword she gave Aeneas when they first met.\n\nAfter the sojourn in Carthage, the Trojans returned to Sicily where Aeneas organized [[funeral games (antiquity)|funeral games]] to honor his father, who had died a year before. The company traveled on and landed on the western coast of Italy. Aeneas descended into the underworld where he met Dido (who turned away from him to return to her husband) and his father, who showed him the future of his descendants and thus the history of Rome.\n\n[[File:Aeneas and Turnus.jpg|thumb|left|Aeneas defeats [[Turnus]], by [[Luca Giordano]], 1634\u20131705.

His daughter [[Lavinia]] had been promised to [[Turnus]], king of the [[Rutuli]], but Latinus received a prophecy that Lavinia would be betrothed to one from another land \u2013 namely, Aeneas. Latinus heeded the prophecy, and Turnus consequently declared war on Aeneas at the urging of Juno, who was aligned with King [[Mezentius]] of [[Etruscan civilization|the Etruscans]] and Queen [[Amata]] of the Latins. Aeneas's forces prevailed. Turnus was killed, and Virgil's account ends abruptly.\n\n===Other sources===\nThe rest of Aeneas's biography is gleaned from other ancient sources, including Livy and Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''. According to Livy, Aeneas was victorious but Latinus died in the war. Aeneas founded the city of [[Lavinium]], named after his wife. He later welcomed Dido's sister, [[Anna Perenna]], who then committed suicide after learning of Lavinia's jealousy. After Aeneas's death, Venus asked Jupiter to make her son immortal. Jupiter agreed. The river god [[Numicus]] cleansed Aeneas of all his mortal parts and Venus anointed him with ambrosia and nectar, making him a god.

[[Ronald Lewis (actor)|Ronald Lewis]] portrayed Aeneas in ''[[Helen of Troy (1956 film)|Helen of Troy]]'', directed by Robert Wise, as a supporting character, who is a member of the Trojan Royal family, and a close and loyal friend to Paris, and escapes at the end of the film. Portrayed by [[Steve Reeves]], he was the main character in the 1961 [[sword and sandal]] film ''[[Guerra di Troia]]'' (''The Trojan War'').

Paris gives Aeneas Priam's sword, in order to give legitimacy and continuity to the royal line of Troy \u2013 and lay the foundations of Roman culture. In this film, he is not a member of the royal family and does not appear to fight in the war.\n\nIn the role-playing game ''[[Vampire: The Requiem]]'' by White Wolf Game Studios, Aeneas figures as one of the mythical founders of the [[Ventrue Clan]].\n\nin the action game ''[[Warriors: Legends of Troy]]'', Aeneas is a playable character. The game ends with him and the Aeneans fleeing Troy's destruction and, spurned by the words of a prophetess thought crazed, goes to a new country (Italy) where he will start an empire greater than Greece and Troy combined that shall rule the world for 1000 years, never to be outdone in the tale of men (The Roman Empire).\n\nIn the 2018 TV miniseries ''[[Troy: Fall of a City]]'', Aeneas is portrayed by [[Alfred Enoch]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://deadline.com/2017/03/troy-fall-of-a-city-cast-bella-dayne-louis-hunter-joseph-mawle-frances-oconnor-david-threlfall-bbc-netflix-1202055633/|title='Troy: Fall Of A City': Bella Dayne, Louis Hunter & More Join BBC/Netflix Epic|date=March 30, 2017|magazine=Deadline|language=en-US|access-date=April 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Depictions in art==\nScenes depicting Aeneas, especially from the Aeneid, have been the focus of study for centuries.

The work was first given by the [[The Royal Ballet|Royal Ballet]] at the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]], London, on 25 October 1968. It has been revived in every subsequent decade.\n\n==Background==\nElgar's variations portray, in his words, \"My friends pictured within\", celebrating, and in some cases caricaturing, members of his circle. He commented to one of them, Troyte Griffith, years after the premiere that if the variations had been written by a Russian rather than an Englishman they would long ago have been turned into a ballet.<ref name=jp/> It was not until six years after the composer's death that an attempt was made to do so, by the choreographer Frank Staff for [[Ballet Rambert]] in 1940.<ref name=jp>Percival, John. \"Ashton and the quality of friendship\", ''The Times'', 26 October 1968, p. 9</ref> Staff's ballet focused on the mood of the variations rather than on the personalities who inspired it.<ref name=jp/>\n\nThe idea for Ashton's ballet originated in the early 1950s, when the designer [[Julia Trevelyan Oman]], then still a student, submitted designs for a ballet to be based on Elgar's music. At the time the idea was not taken up, but in the 1960s Ashton had come round to it, and invited Trevelyan Oman, by then a rising star of theatre design, to collaborate.<ref name=cargill>Cargill, Mary.

When completing the score in 1898, Elgar had been persuaded by his publisher (portrayed as \"Nimrod\" of the variations) to add a further 96 bars to the ending. With the permission of the Elgar estate, Ashton used the shorter version, previously unheard by even the most dedicated Elgarians.<ref>Ward, David.\n[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/apr/16/arts.artsnews?INTCMP=SRCH \"Enigma of Elgar Variations finale on record at last\"], ''The Guardian'', 16 April 2003, p. 8</ref> The playing time of the ballet is about half an hour.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe piece shows an imaginary gathering of Elgar and his friends at the Elgars' house in Worcestershire. The composer, at this point in his career struggling and little known, is awaiting a message from London. While they are waiting, the Elgars and their friends are portrayed in dances representing their personalities. After the last of these, Ashton contributes his own \"enigma\"; a telegram arrives: the characters know, but the audience does not, that it is from the celebrated conductor [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] agreeing to conduct Elgar's new work. There is an exuberant finale.<ref name=jp/>\n\nAshton, drawing on a commentary written by the composer in 1929,{{#tag:ref|Notes for the Aeolian Company's [[piano roll]]s of a transcribed score of the piece.

The work was first given by the [[The Royal Ballet|Royal Ballet]] at the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]], London, on 25 October 1968. It has been revived in every subsequent decade.\n\n==Background==\nElgar's variations portray, in his words, \"My friends pictured within\", celebrating, and in some cases caricaturing, members of his circle. He commented to one of them, Troyte Griffith, years after the premiere that if the variations had been written by a Russian rather than an Englishman they would long ago have been turned into a ballet.<ref name=jp/> It was not until six years after the composer's death that an attempt was made to do so, by the choreographer Frank Staff for [[Ballet Rambert]] in 1940.<ref name=jp>Percival, John. \"Ashton and the quality of friendship\", ''The Times'', 26 October 1968, p. 9</ref> Staff's ballet focused on the mood of the variations rather than on the personalities who inspired it.<ref name=jp/>\n\nThe idea for Ashton's ballet originated in the early 1950s, when the designer [[Julia Trevelyan Oman]], then still a student, submitted designs for a ballet to be based on Elgar's music. At the time the idea was not taken up, but in the 1960s Ashton had come round to it, and invited Trevelyan Oman, by then a rising star of theatre design, to collaborate.<ref name=cargill>Cargill, Mary.

When completing the score in 1898, Elgar had been persuaded by his publisher (portrayed as \"Nimrod\" of the variations) to add a further 96 bars to the ending. With the permission of the Elgar estate, Ashton used the shorter version, previously unheard by even the most dedicated Elgarians.<ref>Ward, David.\n[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/apr/16/arts.artsnews?INTCMP=SRCH \"Enigma of Elgar Variations finale on record at last\"], ''The Guardian'', 16 April 2003, p. 8</ref> The playing time of the ballet is about half an hour.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe piece shows an imaginary gathering of Elgar and his friends at the Elgars' house in Worcestershire. The composer, at this point in his career struggling and little known, is awaiting a message from London. While they are waiting, the Elgars and their friends are portrayed in dances representing their personalities. After the last of these, Ashton contributes his own \"enigma\"; a telegram arrives: the characters know, but the audience does not, that it is from the celebrated conductor [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] agreeing to conduct Elgar's new work. There is an exuberant finale.<ref name=jp/>\n\nAshton, drawing on a commentary written by the composer in 1929,{{#tag:ref|Notes for the Aeolian Company's [[piano roll]]s of a transcribed score of the piece.

To obtain an application form, each aspiring candidate must give the party a non-refundable amount of $10,000. To make their candidacy official, each candidate must submit their ballot signed by at least 2,000 members from at least 9 administrative regions and at least 50 local associations and pay the party a non-refundable amount of $15,000.\n\nFor the first time, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois will allow both party members and supporters to participate in the election of the leader. Supporters will have to pay $5\u0329 to obtain the right to vote. Anyone enjoying the status of voter in Quebec can contribute to the campaign of a leadership contestant by paying him an amount that cannot exceed $500. Applicants' maximum campaign expenses cannot exceed $125,000. Two debates were to be organized by the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois between April 15 and May 20 - one in Montreal and the other in Center-du-Qu\u00e9bec, but have been postponed.\n\nThe voting period was to have begun on June 15 at 9 a.m. and end on June 19 at 3 p.m. but has been delayed until August. Voting will take place by preferential ballot . Thus, a candidate who collects 50% + 1 vote will win. If necessary, a second or even a third round will be held to, after distribution of the 2nd and 3rd choices, choose a winner. The results will be announced by the returning officer, in a location to be determined in the Capitale-Nationale or Chaudi\u00e8re-Appalaches regions.\n\n== Candidates ==\n=== Declared ===\n*

To obtain an application form, each aspiring candidate must give the party a non-refundable amount of $10,000. To make their candidacy official, each candidate must submit their ballot signed by at least 2,000 members from at least 9 administrative regions and at least 50 local associations and pay the party a non-refundable amount of $15,000.\n\nFor the first time, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois will allow both party members and supporters to participate in the election of the leader. Supporters will have to pay $5\u0329 to obtain the right to vote. Anyone enjoying the status of voter in Quebec can contribute to the campaign of a leadership contestant by paying him an amount that cannot exceed $500. Applicants' maximum campaign expenses cannot exceed $125,000. Two debates were to be organized by the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois between April 15 and May 20 - one in Montreal and the other in Center-du-Qu\u00e9bec, but have been postponed.\n\nThe voting period was to have begun on June 15 at 9 a.m. and end on June 19 at 3 p.m. but has been delayed until August. Voting will take place by preferential ballot . Thus, a candidate who collects 50% + 1 vote will win. If necessary, a second or even a third round will be held to, after distribution of the 2nd and 3rd choices, choose a winner. The results will be announced by the returning officer, in a location to be determined in the Capitale-Nationale or Chaudi\u00e8re-Appalaches regions.\n\n== Candidates ==\n=== Declared ===\n*

It is believed the resentment of competing interests led to the creation of the acerbic idea of a clique gaining headway through its closeness to power and thereby approximating resources of the state under the banner of [[capitalism]].\n\n==Usage of the term ''Mafia''==\nThe term Kaduna Mafia was supposedly popularised by journalist, Mvendaga Jibo.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Context===\n\nThe historical genetic configuration of most modern [[Africa]]n states is dominated by a coherent theme of an exploitative, cultural bourgeoisie who engage in chicanery and the ability to make docile the common man in order to engage in its greedy and selfish intentions and acquire power which is then used partly to mitigate against any opposition from [[cultural]] and political enemies. These states were originally made up of varied cultural, ethnic and racial groups with little intent to come under the same political tent under the principles of equity or fairness in the rocky political, economic, and  social terrain. The new colonial nation-state, a mixture of different religious, ethnic and cultural groups forced to unite without a common external enemy then becomes exposed sometimes violently to its inherent cultural, religious and ethnic cleavages. A fertile and emerging force of clientele economics, capitalism and favoritism based on cultural affiliations becomes a weapon that can be used to foster an individual's self-interest. The exploitation of the inherent cleavages by elites based on their own selfish and provincial interests becomes a political weapon to gain a strong foundation against destructive attacks from other groups, gain a strong foothold in the economy and weaken fair criticism based on viable objections. This is magnified by the herd support given to ethnic or provincial politicians and leaders.\n\n===Origins===\nThe origins of the Kaduna mafia revolves around the [[1966 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat|fall of the First Republic]]. The loss of many northern leaders in the coup prodded a group of northern civil servants to rally around and oppose the new government of General [[Aguiyi Ironsi]]. The group, a diverse mixture of aristocrats and civil servants who were predominantly [[Muslim]] and based in Kaduna. Many of its members were educated at the famous [[Barewa College]] in [[Zaria]], and had demonstrated a certain level of managerial competence in comparison to some of their older contemporaries. They were known for their intelligence, commitment to the traditional values and socio-political interests of Northern Nigeria and their internal camaraderie.

It is believed the resentment of competing interests led to the creation of the acerbic idea of a clique gaining headway through its closeness to power and thereby approximating resources of the state under the banner of [[capitalism]].\n\n==Usage of the term ''Mafia''==\nThe term Kaduna Mafia was supposedly popularised by journalist, Mvendaga Jibo.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Context===\n\nThe historical genetic configuration of most modern [[Africa]]n states is dominated by a coherent theme of an exploitative, cultural bourgeoisie who engage in chicanery and the ability to make docile the common man in order to engage in its greedy and selfish intentions and acquire power which is then used partly to mitigate against any opposition from [[cultural]] and political enemies. These states were originally made up of varied cultural, ethnic and racial groups with little intent to come under the same political tent under the principles of equity or fairness in the rocky political, economic, and  social terrain. The new colonial nation-state, a mixture of different religious, ethnic and cultural groups forced to unite without a common external enemy then becomes exposed sometimes violently to its inherent cultural, religious and ethnic cleavages. A fertile and emerging force of clientele economics, capitalism and favoritism based on cultural affiliations becomes a weapon that can be used to foster an individual's self-interest. The exploitation of the inherent cleavages by elites based on their own selfish and provincial interests becomes a political weapon to gain a strong foundation against destructive attacks from other groups, gain a strong foothold in the economy and weaken fair criticism based on viable objections. This is magnified by the herd support given to ethnic or provincial politicians and leaders.\n\n===Origins===\nThe origins of the Kaduna mafia revolves around the [[1966 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat|fall of the First Republic]]. The loss of many northern leaders in the coup prodded a group of northern civil servants to rally around and oppose the new government of General [[Aguiyi Ironsi]]. The group, a diverse mixture of aristocrats and civil servants who were predominantly [[Muslim]] and based in Kaduna. Many of its members were educated at the famous [[Barewa College]] in [[Zaria]], and had demonstrated a certain level of managerial competence in comparison to some of their older contemporaries. They were known for their intelligence, commitment to the traditional values and socio-political interests of Northern Nigeria and their internal camaraderie. Members were involved in varied aspects of the Nigerian nation, they were bank directors, ministers, military colonels and owners of business; their main differentiating symbol was the prominence of [[economic]] interest as a driving factor in their activities.\n\n===Military era===\nThe group supposedly achieved most success during the military regime of General [[Obasanjo]], where many of its members were appointed to key positions of power and used its alliance to obtain patronage and disburse favour to friends and associates.\n\n===Democratic era===\nThe group returned to prominence during the administration of President [[Umaru Musa Yar'Adua]].

The main campus is south of the city centre, adjacent to [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]]. In 1957, the university's predecessor ('''University College, Leicester''') gained university status.\n\nFor 2018/19, the university is nationally ranked 34th in [[Rankings of universities in the United Kingdom#The Times/The Sunday Times|''The Sunday Times Good University Guide'']], 63rd by The Guardian University Guide and 29th in [[Rankings of universities in the United Kingdom#The Complete University Guide|''The Complete University Guide'']]. It is ranked as one of the top 200 universities in the world by the 2018 [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]], and the 25th in the United Kingdom. The university had an income of \u00a3302.8 million in 2016/17, of which \u00a352.2 million was from research grants.<ref name=Leicester2017/>\n\nThe university is famous for the discovery of [[genetic fingerprinting]] and contributing to the discovery and identification of the remains of [[exhumation of Richard III|King Richard III]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Richard III Society pays tribute to exemplary archaeological research |url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/media-centre/non-university-press-releases/richard-iii-society-pays-tribute-to-exemplary-archaeological-research |date=15 October 2012 |publisher=University of Leicester |accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n===Desire for a university===\n[[Image:Fielding Johnson Building, University of Leicester.jpg|thumb|The Fielding Johnson Building (built 1837)]]\n\nIt is argued that the first serious suggestions for a university in Leicester began with the Leicester Literary and Philosophical society which had its interest in literature and philosophy in the old sense, meaning science.<ref>{{harvnb|Simmons|1958|p=51}}</ref>  With the success of [[Owen's College]] in Manchester, and the establishment of [[Birmingham University]] in 1900, and [[University of Nottingham|Nottingham University College]], it was thought that Leicester ought to have a university college too. [[University college#United Kingdom|University colleges]] could not award degrees; they were not fully independent universities but were associated with other Universities. In most cases students sat the exam of the [[University of London]].\n\nIn the late 19th century, presidents of the society Revered James Went, headmaster of the [[Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College|Wyggeston Boys' School]], and J. D. Paul regularly called for an establishment of a University College<ref>{{harvnb|Simmons|1958|p=58}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leicesterlitandphil.org.uk/history/ |title=History |last= |first= |date= |website=Leicester Lit and Phil Society |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> However, no private donations were forthcoming, and the [[Leicester City Council|Corporation of Leicester]] was busy funding the [[De Montfort University#Origins|School of Art and the Technical School]]. The matter was brought up again by Dr Astey V. Clarke (1870\u20131945) in 1912. Born in Leicester in 1870, he was educated at [[Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys|Wyggeston Grammar School]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] before receiving his medical training at [[Guy's Hospital]].  He was the new president of the Literary and Philosophy society. Reaction was mixed with some saying that Leicester's small size would mean lack of demand. With the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, talk of the University subsided. In 1917, during the despair of war, the ''Leicester Daily Post'' urged in an editorial that something more of practical utility than memorials ought to be used to commemorate the dead. With the ending of the war, the local newspapers, the ''Leicester Post'' and ''Leicester Mail'' encouraged donations to form the University. Some suggested that Leicester should join forces with neighbouring university colleges of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington and Loughborough, to create a federal East Midlands college, rather than an independent one.\n\n===Establishment===\nThe old asylum building had often been suggested as a site for the new university, and after it was due to be finished being used as a hospital for the wounded, Astley Clarke was keen to urge the citizens and local authorities to buy it. Fortunately, Clarke quickly learned the building had already been bought by [[Thomas Fielding Johnson]], a wealthy philanthropist who owned a [[worsted]] manufacturing business. He had bought 37 acres of land for \u00a340,000 and intended not only to house the college, but also the boys' and girls' grammar schools. Further donations soon topped \u00a3100,000: many were given in memory of loved ones lost during the war, while others were for those who had taken part and survived. King [[George V]] gave his blessing to the scheme after a visit to the town in 1919.<ref>{{harvnb|Simmons|1958|p=69}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatleft\"\n|-\n! Year !!

Others had higher hopes than just technical training.   The education acts of [[Education Act 1902|1902]] and [[Education Act 1918|1918]], which brought education to the masses was also thought to have increased the need for a college, not least to train the new teachers that were needed.  Talk of a federal university soured and the decision was for Leicester to become a stand-alone college.  In 1920, the college appointed its first official.  W.G. Gibbs, a long-standing supporter of the college while editor of the ''Leicester Daily Post'', was nominated as Secretary.  On 9 May 1921, Dr R.F Rattray (1886\u20131967),<ref>{{harvnb|Burch|1996|p=16}}</ref> was appointed Principal, aged 35.  Rattray was an impressive academic.  Having gained a first class English degree at Glasgow, he studied at [[Manchester College, Oxford]].  He then studied in Germany, and secured his Ph.D at Harvard.

The main campus is south of the city centre, adjacent to [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]]. In 1957, the university's predecessor ('''University College, Leicester''') gained university status.\n\nFor 2018/19, the university is nationally ranked 34th in [[Rankings of universities in the United Kingdom#The Times/The Sunday Times|''The Sunday Times Good University Guide'']], 63rd by The Guardian University Guide and 29th in [[Rankings of universities in the United Kingdom#The Complete University Guide|''The Complete University Guide'']]. It is ranked as one of the top 200 universities in the world by the 2018 [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]], and the 25th in the United Kingdom. The university had an income of \u00a3302.8 million in 2016/17, of which \u00a352.2 million was from research grants.<ref name=Leicester2017/>\n\nThe university is famous for the discovery of [[genetic fingerprinting]] and contributing to the discovery and identification of the remains of [[exhumation of Richard III|King Richard III]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Richard III Society pays tribute to exemplary archaeological research |url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/media-centre/non-university-press-releases/richard-iii-society-pays-tribute-to-exemplary-archaeological-research |date=15 October 2012 |publisher=University of Leicester |accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n===Desire for a university===\n[[Image:Fielding Johnson Building, University of Leicester.jpg|thumb|The Fielding Johnson Building (built 1837)]]\n\nIt is argued that the first serious suggestions for a university in Leicester began with the Leicester Literary and Philosophical society which had its interest in literature and philosophy in the old sense, meaning science.<ref>{{harvnb|Simmons|1958|p=51}}</ref>  With the success of [[Owen's College]] in Manchester, and the establishment of [[Birmingham University]] in 1900, and [[University of Nottingham|Nottingham University College]], it was thought that Leicester ought to have a university college too. [[University college#United Kingdom|University colleges]] could not award degrees; they were not fully independent universities but were associated with other Universities. In most cases students sat the exam of the [[University of London]].\n\nIn the late 19th century, presidents of the society Revered James Went, headmaster of the [[Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College|Wyggeston Boys' School]], and J. D. Paul regularly called for an establishment of a University College<ref>{{harvnb|Simmons|1958|p=58}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leicesterlitandphil.org.uk/history/ |title=History |last= |first= |date= |website=Leicester Lit and Phil Society |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> However, no private donations were forthcoming, and the [[Leicester City Council|Corporation of Leicester]] was busy funding the [[De Montfort University#Origins|School of Art and the Technical School]]. The matter was brought up again by Dr Astey V. Clarke (1870\u20131945) in 1912. Born in Leicester in 1870, he was educated at [[Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys|Wyggeston Grammar School]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] before receiving his medical training at [[Guy's Hospital]].  He was the new president of the Literary and Philosophy society. Reaction was mixed with some saying that Leicester's small size would mean lack of demand. With the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, talk of the University subsided. In 1917, during the despair of war, the ''Leicester Daily Post'' urged in an editorial that something more of practical utility than memorials ought to be used to commemorate the dead. With the ending of the war, the local newspapers, the ''Leicester Post'' and ''Leicester Mail'' encouraged donations to form the University. Some suggested that Leicester should join forces with neighbouring university colleges of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington and Loughborough, to create a federal East Midlands college, rather than an independent one.\n\n===Establishment===\nThe old asylum building had often been suggested as a site for the new university, and after it was due to be finished being used as a hospital for the wounded, Astley Clarke was keen to urge the citizens and local authorities to buy it. Fortunately, Clarke quickly learned the building had already been bought by [[Thomas Fielding Johnson]], a wealthy philanthropist who owned a [[worsted]] manufacturing business. He had bought 37 acres of land for \u00a340,000 and intended not only to house the college, but also the boys' and girls' grammar schools. Further donations soon topped \u00a3100,000: many were given in memory of loved ones lost during the war, while others were for those who had taken part and survived. King [[George V]] gave his blessing to the scheme after a visit to the town in 1919.<ref>{{harvnb|Simmons|1958|p=69}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatleft\"\n|-\n! Year !!

Others had higher hopes than just technical training.   The education acts of [[Education Act 1902|1902]] and [[Education Act 1918|1918]], which brought education to the masses was also thought to have increased the need for a college, not least to train the new teachers that were needed.  Talk of a federal university soured and the decision was for Leicester to become a stand-alone college.  In 1920, the college appointed its first official.  W.G. Gibbs, a long-standing supporter of the college while editor of the ''Leicester Daily Post'', was nominated as Secretary.  On 9 May 1921, Dr R.F Rattray (1886\u20131967),<ref>{{harvnb|Burch|1996|p=16}}</ref> was appointed Principal, aged 35.  Rattray was an impressive academic.  Having gained a first class English degree at Glasgow, he studied at [[Manchester College, Oxford]].  He then studied in Germany, and secured his Ph.D at Harvard.  After that, heworked as a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] Minister.  Rattray was to teach Latin and English.  He recruited others including Miss Measham to teach Botany, Miss Sarson to teach geography, and Miss Chapuzet to teach French.<ref>{{harvnb|Simmons|1958|p=81}}</ref>  In all, 14 people started at the University when it opened its doors in October 1921: the principal, the secretary, 3 lecturers and nine students (eight women and one man).  Two types of students were expected, around 100\u2013150 teachers in training, and undergraduates hoping to sit the external degrees of London University.  A students union was formed in 1923\u201324 with a Miss Bonsor as its first president.<ref>{{harvnb|Simmons|1958|p=94}}</ref>\n\nIn 1927, after it became University College, Leicester, students sat for the examinations for external degrees of the [[University of London]]. Two years later, it merged with the [[Vaughan College|Vaughan Working Men's College]], which had been providing adult education in Leicester since 1862.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brown|first=Cynthia|year=2012 |title=A Blessing to the Town: 150 Years of Vaughan College, Leicester|publisher=University of Leicester|isbn=9780901507723|page=42}}</ref>  In 1931, Dr Rattray resigned as principal.  He was replaced in 1932 by [[Frederick Attenborough]], who was the father of [[David Attenborough|David]] and [[Richard Attenborough|Richard]] Attenborough.  He was succeeded by [[Charles Wilson (political scientist)|Charles Wilson]] in 1952.\n\n===University status to modern day===\n[[File:Archaeologist working in Trench.jpg|right|thumb|Archaeologists working on the site of Richard III's grave, in the former Greyfriars Church, in September 2012]]\nIn 1957, the University College was granted its [[Royal Charter]], and has since then had the status of a university with the right to award its own degrees.
