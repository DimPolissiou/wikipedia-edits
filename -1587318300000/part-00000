One such example is the NYU Computer Science Department Showcase held every semester to showcase projects that have been completed in various computer science graduate and undergraduate courses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cims.nyu.edu/events/ |title=NYU > Courant Institute > Weekly Bulletin |publisher=Cims.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~wincweb/winc.html |title=New York University - Women in Computing |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~csstu/ |title=Courant Student Organization:: New York University |publisher=Cims.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/math_club/index.html |title=NYU Mathematics Society: Home |publisher=Math.nyu.edu |date=2010-04-24 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/~acmweb/wordpress/ |title=The ACM at NYU |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date=2011-02-22 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814133630/http://cs.nyu.edu/~acmweb/wordpress/ |archivedate=2011-08-14 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1934, [[Richard Courant]] left [[G\u00f6ttingen University]] in Germany to become a visiting professor at NYU. He was given the task of building up the Department of Mathematics at the [[NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science]]. He was later joined by [[Kurt O. Friedrichs]] and James J. Stoker. In 1946, the department was renamed \"Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics\". Also in 1946, NYU Professor [[Morris Kline]] focused on mathematical problems of electromagnetic wave propagation. This project gave rise to the Institute's Division of Wave Propagation and Applied Mathematics. In 1952, the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] installed one of the first (electronic) computers at New York University, which led to the creation of the Courant Mathematics and Computing Laboratory. The Division of Magnetofluid Dynamics was initiated by a project on plasma fusion by NYU Professor [[Harold Grad]] in 1954.  The Institute was in the forefront of advanced hardware use, with an early [[IBM 7094]] and the fourth produced [[CDC 6600]].  The Division of [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] was created in 1978, arising from a project of NYU Professor [[Paul Garabedian|Paul R. Garabedian]].\n\n==Directors==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Image\n! Name\n!

In addition it offers Master of Science degrees in computer science, information systems (in conjunction with the [[Stern School of Business]]), and in scientific computing. For the PhD program, every PhD computer science student must receive a grade of A or A- on the final examination for algorithms, systems, applications, and a PhD-level course chosen by the student that does not satisfy the first three requirements, such as cryptography and numerical methods. Students may take the final exam for any these courses without being enrolled in the course.\n\nThe Computer Science Masters program offers instruction in the fundamental principles, design and applications of computer systems and computer technologies. Students who obtain an MS degree in computer science are qualified to do significant development work in the computer industry or important application areas. Those who receive a doctoral degree are in a position to hold faculty appointments and do research and development work at the forefront of this rapidly changing and expanding field. The emphasis for the MS in Information Systems program is on the use of computer systems in business. For the Master of Science in Scientific Computing, it is designed to provide broad training in areas related to scientific computing using modern computing technology and mathematical modeling arising in various applications. The core of the curriculum for all computer science graduate students consists of courses in algorithms, programming languages, compilers, artificial intelligence, database systems, and operating systems. Advanced courses are offered in many areas such as natural language processing, the theory of computation, computer vision, software engineering, compiler optimization techniques, computer graphics, distributed computing, multimedia, networks, cryptography and security, groupware and [[computational finance]]. Adjunct faculty, drawn from outside academia, teach special topics courses in their areas of expertise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/graduate/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Graduate Programs in Computer Science |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nUnless outside fellowships or scholarships are available to the students, all admitted Courant PhD students are granted with the GSAS MacCracken award.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.math.nyu.edu/dynamic/phd/admissions-financial-support/financial-support/|title=Financial Support - Department of Mathematics - NYU Courant|author=|date=|website=www.math.nyu.edu}}</ref> The fellowship covers the tuition and provides 9 months of stipend along with other benefits such as health insurance and special housing opportunies.

In addition, CIMS provides opportunities and facilities for undergraduate students to do and discuss mathematical research, including an undergraduate math lounge on the 11th floor and an undergraduate computer science lounge on the 3rd floor of Warren Weaver Hall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/MathLounge.html |title=Math Lounge |publisher=Math.nyu.edu |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718174327/http://math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/MathLounge.html |archive-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.global-derivatives.com/index.php?Itemid=5&id=91&option=com_content&task=view |title=New York University - MSc Mathematics in Finance |publisher=Global-derivatives.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n[[File:CIMS Classroom.jpg|thumb|Classroom at Warren Weaver Hall]]\nThe mathematics and computer science undergraduate and graduate programs at the Courant Institute has a strong focus on building quantitative and problem-solving skills through teamwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Undergrad/ |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Undergraduate Program |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/ |title=Department of Mathematics, Courant Institute |publisher=Math.nyu.edu |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> An undergraduate computer science course on Computer Vision, for example, requires students to be in small teams to use and apply recently developed algorithms by researchers around the world on their own. One example assignment requires a student to study a paper written by researchers from [[Microsoft Research Cambridge]] in order to do an assignment on Segmentation and Graph Cut. To encourage innovation, students in advanced coursework are allowed to use any means to complete their assignment, such as a programming language of their choice and hacking a [[Kinect]] through legal means.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring11/V22.0480-001/index.html |title=V22.0480-001 |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThe Courant Institute's undergraduate program also encourages students to engage in research with professors and graduate students. About 30% of undergraduate students participate in academic research through the competitive [[Research Experiences for Undergraduates]] program funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] or research funded primarily by the Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund. The Courant Institute has one of the highest percentage of undergraduate students doing research within [[New York University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.DeansResearchFund.html |title=NYU > A & S > Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund |publisher=Cas.nyu.edu |accessdate=2011-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629120916/http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.DeansResearchFund.html |archive-date=2011-06-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Undergrad/spotlight.html |title=Undergraduate Student Spotlight - NYU Computer Science Department |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref><ref>[http://www.quantnet.com/review-nyu-mathematical-finance-program ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531134706/http://www.quantnet.com/review-nyu-mathematical-finance-program |date=May 31, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/ |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Undergraduate Program |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> With permission of their advisers or faculty, undergraduate students may take graduate-level courses. Courant undergraduate students through the years and alumni contribute greatly to the vitality of the Mathematics and Computer Science departments. Some accomplishments by current and former undergraduate Courant students include an Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Scholarship Winner, development of Object Category Recognition Techniques to sort garbage for recycling for the NYC's trash program, placement in 7th out of 42 in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), and inventors of the [[Diaspora (software)]] social network.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nThe undergraduate division of the Department of Mathematics offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Mathematics. It consists of a wide variety of courses in pure and applied mathematics taught by a distinguished faculty with a tradition of excellence in teaching and research. Students in advanced coursework often participate in formulating models outside the field of mathematics as well as in analyzing them. For example, an advanced mathematics course in Computers in Medicine and Biology requires a student to construct two computer models selected from the following list: circulation, gas exchange in the lung, control of cell volume, and the renal countercurrent mechanism. The student uses the models to conduct simulated physiological experiments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:vGj-HafADLoJ:math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/Math%2520major%2520bulletin%25202010-11%2520Final.pdf+Math+undergraduate+nyu+requirements&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESi4x3xv-_X-4B0Xil4BidRNWKCKg9smDHdaXmhcPNv2gRXB173WgH0mNEM6D-RGr6C-oEz4XoRNBZvoWRQ_RWpcHpNzWxe06LDC0hc2wG0Yi5rf6AFY3cYBVAKb3_wZ-EJjvU6I&sig=AHIEtbSCuQUYJiy-dq4Yg8t8z5z6AnV2Ig |title=Powered by Google Docs |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThe undergraduate division of the Department of Computer Science offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, and fours minors.

Students may combine the degree with other majors within the College of Arts and Science to create a personalized joint major. Two specific combined degrees are the joint major in computer science/economics and the joint major in computer science/mathematics. The Department of Computer Science also offers a BS/BE Dual Degree in computer science and engineering and an accelerated master's program available to qualifying undergraduates in conjunction with the [[Tandon School of Engineering]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Undergraduate CS Program Overview |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\n===Graduation===\nThe Courant Institute encourages students at any stage of their studies, including the very early stage, to seek summer employment opportunities at various government and industry facilities. In the past few years, Courant students have taken summer internships at the National Institute of Health, Los Alamos National Laboratory,  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NASA, as well as Wall Street firms. Such opportunities can greatly expand students' understanding of the mathematical sciences, offer them possible areas of interest for thesis research, and enhance their career options. Members of the faculty (and in particular the students' academic advisors) can assist students in finding appropriate summer employment. All graduate students are given official advisers, and  undergraduates are provided mentors from Courant faculty.\n\n===Academic research===\n[[File:Games for Learning Institute.jpg|thumb|The Courant Institute along with Microsoft Research are the founders of the Games for Learning Institute]]\nThe Department of Mathematics at Courant occupies a leading position in analysis and applied mathematics, including [[partial differential equations]], [[differential geometry]], [[dynamical systems]], [[probability]] and [[stochastic processes]], [[scientific computation]], [[mathematical finance]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. A special feature of the Institute is its highly interdisciplinary character \u2014 with courses, seminars, and active research collaborations in areas such as [[financial mathematics]], materials science, visual neural science, atmosphere/ocean science, cardiac fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and mathematical genomics. Another special feature is the central role of [[analysis]], which provides a natural bridge between pure and applied mathematics. The Department of Computer Science has strengths in multimedia, programming languages and systems, distributed and parallel computing, and the [[analysis of algorithms]].\n\nSince 1948, Courant Institute has maintained its own research journal, [[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]], which currently has the highest impact factor internationally among mathematics journals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/78504520/issue |title=Wiley Online Library |publisher=.interscience.wiley.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>   While the journal represents the full spectrum of the Institute's mathematical research activity, most articles are in  the fields of applied mathematics, mathematical analysis, or mathematical physics. Its contents over the years amount to a modern history of the theory of partial differential equations. Most articles originate within the Institute or are specially invited. The Institute also  publishes its own series of lecture notes. They are based on the research interests of the faculty and visitors of the   Institute, originated in advanced graduate courses and mini-courses offered at the Institute.\n\n==Resources==\n[[File:Applied Mathematics Lab.jpg|thumb|Applied Mathematics Laboratory]]\n\n===Warren Weaver Hall & 60 Fifth Avenue===\nCIMS consists of the [[NYU]] Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science as well as a variety of research activities.

He was given the task of building up the Department of Mathematics at the [[NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science]]. He was later joined by [[Kurt O. Friedrichs]] and James J. Stoker. In 1946, the department was renamed \"Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics\". Also in 1946, NYU Professor [[Morris Kline]] focused on mathematical problems of electromagnetic wave propagation. This project gave rise to the Institute's Division of Wave Propagation and Applied Mathematics. In 1952, the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] installed one of the first (electronic) computers at New York University, which led to the creation of the Courant Mathematics and Computing Laboratory. The Division of Magnetofluid Dynamics was initiated by a project on plasma fusion by NYU Professor [[Harold Grad]] in 1954.  The Institute was in the forefront of advanced hardware use, with an early [[IBM 7094]] and the fourth produced [[CDC 6600]].  The Division of [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] was created in 1978, arising from a project of NYU Professor [[Paul Garabedian|Paul R. Garabedian]].\n\n==Directors==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Image\n! Name\n!

This reflects the views of experts that cave bears may have spent more time in caves than the [[brown bear]], which uses caves only for [[hibernation]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Cave bear AMNH.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rearing ''Ursus spelaeus'' skeleton]]\nCave bear skeletons were first described in 1774 by Johann Friederich Esper in his book ''Newly Discovered Zoolites of Unknown Four Footed Animals''. While scientists at the time considered that the skeletons could belong to [[ape]]s, [[canid]]s, [[felid]]s, or even [[dragon]]s or [[unicorn]]s, Esper postulated that they actually belonged to [[polar bear]]s. Twenty years later, [[Johann Christian Rosenm\u00fcller]], an anatomist at the [[Leipzig University]], gave the species its binomial name. The bones were so numerous that most researchers had little regard for them. During [[World War I]], with the scarcity of [[phosphate]] dung, earth from the caves where cave bear bones occurred were used as a source of phosphates. When the \"dragon caves\" in Austria's [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]] region were exploited for this purpose, only the skulls and leg bones were kept.<ref name=\"Brunner2007\">{{cite book|author=Bernd Brunner|title=Bears: A Brief History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1W98s7aVy8cC&pg=PA41|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-12299-2|page=41}}</ref>\n\nMany caves in [[Central Europe]] have skeletons of cave bears inside, for example the ''Heinrichsh\u00f6hle'' in [[Hemer, Germany|Hemer]], the ''Dechenh\u00f6hle'' in [[Iserlohn]], [[Germany]].

The three anterior [[premolar]]s were gradually reduced, then disappeared, possibly in response to a largely vegetarian diet. In a fourth of the skulls found in the [[Conturines]], the third premolar is still present, while more [[Synapomorphy|derived]] specimens elsewhere lack it. The last remaining premolar became conjugated with the true [[Molar (tooth)|molars]], enlarging the crown and granting it more cusps and cutting borders. This phenomenon, called ''molarization'', improved the [[mastication]] capacities of the molars, facilitating the processing of tough vegetation. This allowed the cave bear to gain more energy for hibernation, while eating less than its ancestors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.altabadia.it/orsispelei/evoluzione_i.htm |title=Gli orsi spel\u00e8i delle Conturines / Ursus Spelaeus |website=Altabadia.it |access-date=2011-09-26 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, scientists recovered and [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] the [[nuclear DNA]] of a cave bear that lived between 42,000 and 44,000 years ago.

No traces of cave bears have been found in [[Scotland]], [[Scandinavia]] or the [[Baltic countries]], which were all covered in extensive [[glacier]]s at the time. The largest numbers of cave bear remains have been found in [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], northern Italy, northern Spain, southern France, and Romania, roughly corresponding with the Pyrenees, Alps, and Carpathians. The huge number of bones found in southern, central and eastern Europe has led some scientists to think Europe may have once had literally herds of cave bears. Others, however, point out that, though some caves have thousands of bones, they were accumulated over a period of 100,000 years or more, thus requiring only two deaths in a cave per year to account for the large numbers.<ref name=\"bieder\"/>\n\nThe cave bear inhabited low mountainous areas, especially in regions rich in [[limestone]] caves.

It also uncovered a stone chest or [[cist]] consisting of a low wall built from limestone slabs near a cave wall with a number of bear skulls inside it. Also, a cave bear skull was found with a femur bone from another bear stuck inside it. Scholarship speculated that this was proof of prehistoric human religious rites involving the cave bear, or that the Drachenloch cave bear were hunted as part of a hunting ritual or that the skulls were kept as trophies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.showcaves.com/english/ch/caves/Drachenloch.html |title=Caves of Switzerland: Drachenloch |access-date=2013-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508045303/http://www.showcaves.com/english/ch/caves/Drachenloch.html |archive-date=2013-05-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In ''Archaeology, Religion, Ritual'' (2004), archaeologist [[Timothy Insoll]] strongly questions whether the Drachenloch finds in the stone cist were the result of human interaction.

A rectangular pit contained the remains of at least twenty bears, covered by a massive stone slab.

This specialized hibernation behavior would have caused a high winter mortality rate for cave bears that failed to find available caves. Therefore, as human populations slowly increased, the cave bear faced a shrinking pool of suitable caves, and slowly faded away to extinction, as both Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans sought out caves as living quarters, depriving the cave bear of vital habitat. This hypothesis is being researched at this time. According to the research study, published in the journal ''Molecular Biology and Evolution'', radiocarbon dating of the fossil remains shows that the cave bear ceased to be abundant in Central Europe around 35,000 years ago. \"This can be attributed to increasing human expansion and the resulting competition between humans and bears for land and shelter,\" explains the scientist, who links this with the scarce fossil representation of the bear's prey in the abundant fossil record of this species.<ref>{{cite web|title=True Causes for Extinction of Cave Bear Revealed: More Human Expansion Than Climate Change|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100824082230.htm|website=ScienceDaily|publisher=Plataforma SINC|date=25 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019 the results of a large scale study of 81 bone specimens (resulting in 59 new sequences), and\u00a064 previously published complete mitochondrial genomes of cave bear mitochondrial DNA remains found in Switzerland, Poland, France, Spain, Germany, Italy and Serbia, indicated that the cave bear population drastically declined starting around 40,000 years ago at the onset of the [[Aurignacian]], coinciding with the arrival of anatomically modern humans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-49345392|title=Extinction: Humans played big role in demise of the cave bear|last=Briggs|first=Helen|date=16 August 2019|website=BBC News|access-date=17 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Gretzinger2019\">{{cite journal|last1= Gretzinger|first1= J.|last2= Molak|first2= M.|last3= Reiter|first3= E.|last4= Pfrengle|first4= S.|last5= Urban|first5= C.|last6= Neukamm|first6= J.|last7= Blant|first7= M.|last8= Conard|first8=N.

Twenty years later, [[Johann Christian Rosenm\u00fcller]], an anatomist at the [[Leipzig University]], gave the species its binomial name. The bones were so numerous that most researchers had little regard for them. During [[World War I]], with the scarcity of [[phosphate]] dung, earth from the caves where cave bear bones occurred were used as a source of phosphates.

This specialized hibernation behavior would have caused a high winter mortality rate for cave bears that failed to find available caves. Therefore, as human populations slowly increased, the cave bear faced a shrinking pool of suitable caves, and slowly faded away to extinction, as both Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans sought out caves as living quarters, depriving the cave bear of vital habitat. This hypothesis is being researched at this time.  According to the research study, published in the journal ''Molecular Biology and Evolution'', radiocarbon dating of the fossil remains shows that the cave bear ceased to be abundant in Central Europe around 35,000 years ago.\n\"This can be attributed to increasing human expansion and the resulting competition between humans and bears for land and shelter,\" explains the scientist, who links this with the scarce fossil representation of the bear's prey in the abundant fossil record of this species.<ref>{{cite web|title=True Causes for Extinction of Cave Bear Revealed: More Human Expansion Than Climate Change|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100824082230.htm|website=ScienceDaily|publisher=Plataforma SINC|date=25 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019 the results of a large scale study of 81 bone specimens (resulting in 59 new sequences), and\u00a064 previously published complete mitochondrial genomes of cave bear mitochondrial DNA remains found in Switzerland, Poland, France, Spain, Germany, Italy and Serbia, indicated that the cave bear population drastically declined starting around 40,000 years ago at the onset of the [[Aurignacian]], coinciding with the arrival of anatomically modern humans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-49345392|title=Extinction: Humans played big role in demise of the cave bear|last=Briggs|first=Helen|date=16 August 2019|website=BBC News|access-date=17 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Gretzinger2019\">{{cite journal|last1= Gretzinger|first1= J.|last2= Molak|first2= M.|last3= Reiter|first3= E.|last4= Pfrengle|first4= S.|last5= Urban|first5= C.|last6= Neukamm|first6= J.|last7= Blant|first7= M.|last8= Conard|first8=N.

He was also noted as a prominent [[atheist]], [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and opponent of [[eugenics]]. In the early 1920s, after the death of his wife, he turned towards [[spiritualism]].\n\n==Early life==\nRobert Blatchford was born 17 March 1851 in [[Maidstone]], [[Kent]]. His parents \u2013 John Glanville Blatchford, a strolling comedian, and Georgina Louisa Corri ''(maiden;'' 1821\u20131890), an actress \u2013 named him after the conservative [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]] who died the year before. His great-grandfather, by way of his mother, [[Domenico Corri]] (1746\u20131825), was an Italian musician and publisher who, in the late [[18th century]], moved from [[Rome]] to [[Edinburgh]] to teach music.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> One of his grandnieces, [[Christine Glanville]] (1924\u20131999), was an acclaimed English puppeteer.\n\nBlatchford's father died in 1853, leaving him in the care of his mother. She continued her acting career for nine years, and Blatchford spent much of his early life close to the stage. To help support the family, Blatchford and his brother Montagu would perform with their mother, doing comedic renditions and dances for extra income. In 1862 the family moved to [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], where it was hoped that Blatchford and his brother could learn a trade. Blatchford was first employed as an odd job boy in a lithographic printing works, for which he earned a salary of eighteen pence a week. As a child he attended school only occasionally, firstly in Halifax and later in Portsmouth. Despite the brevity of his educational experience, it provided him with enough insight that he called the education system a 'cram' method.\n\nThough lacking a formal education, Blatchford taught himself from the age of eight, reading the [[Bible]], ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'', and the works of [[Charles Dickens]]. Throughout his childhood he was frail and sickly, and doctors suggested that he would not reach adulthood. This illness gave Blatchford time to read, something he would not have been able to pursue as thoroughly if employed. Around 1864, Georgina secured full-time employment as a dressmaker and immediately apprenticed both her sons, sending Montagu to a lithographic printer and Robert to a brushmaker. At the brushmaker factory, Blatchford met Sarah Crossley, who he would marry in 1880.\n\nBy 1871 Blatchford left Halifax, though his reason for doing so has been the cause of debate. Laurence Thomson argues that the departure was due to a quarrel with his mother, but Blatchford's daughter Dorothea maintains that his decision to leave was caused by the difficulty of his life in Halifax. On [[May Day]] 1871, Blatchford walked to Hull, then continued on to London via Yarmouth.\n\n==Military and early journalistic career==\nAfter leaving Halifax, Blatchford joined the [[British Army|Army]] and rose to become a [[sergeant major]] by 1874. By the time of his promotion, he had also achieved the Army's second class certificate of education. Blatchford served with the Irish regiment 103rd [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers|Dublin Fusiliers]] and the [[96th Regiment of Foot]]. The pleasures of army life stimulated some of Blatchford's best writing, but in 1877 he left the army to become a clerk in the [[River Weaver|Weaver Navigation Company]]. While employed as a clerk, he carefully used his spare time to learn grammar, syntax, and shorthand. In 1880 he married Sarah Crossley, whom he met in Halifax, at the Zion Chapel in Halifax; they then settled in [[Norwich]]. Sarah was the daughter of a [[domestic worker|domestic servant]] and a mechanic. Around this time Blatchford became frustrated with his job, and decided that he wished to become an artist. Because employment opportunities for artists in Norwich were scarce, however, he instead decided to become a writer. Blatchford's writing career began in 1882 at the ''Yorkshireman'' newspaper, where he had a sketch published. He obtained his first full-time writing job through his friend Alexander Muttock Thompson, who worked for the Manchester ''[[Sporting Chronicle]]''. Thompson recommended Blatchford to a friend who ran the newspaper ''[[Bell's Life in London]]''. A year later, Blatchford moved his family to South London to write for ''Bell's Life'' and the ''Leeds Toby''.\n\nIn 1885, Blatchford began to write for the Manchester ''[[Sunday Chronicle]]''. When ''Bell's Life'' failed two years later, he moved to a full-time position at the ''Sunday Chronicle''. Before beginning at the ''Sunday Chronicle'', Blatchford took a short holiday on the Isle of Wight after the death of his two children. At this time he had not begun to espouse socialist views, but the societal reactions to the competitiveness of industrial society in Northern England began affecting his sentiments. The largest political influence on Blatchford was the South [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] [[Social Democratic Federation]]. This change is seen in a series of 1889 articles he wrote for the ''Sunday Chronicle'' which denounced the housing conditions in Manchester and organised two working men's Sanitary Organisations in the area.\n\nReflecting back on this period, Blatchford stated in the ''Fortnightly Review'' in 1907 that \"Dr. Cozier is mistaken if he thinks I took my Socialism from [[Karl Marx|Marx]], or that it depends upon the Marxian theory of value. I have never read a page of Marx. I got the idea of collective ownership from [[Henry Hyndman|H. M. Hyndman]]; the rest of my Socialism I thought out myself. English Socialism is not German: it is English. English Socialism is not Marxian; it is humanitarian. It does not depend upon any theory of 'economic justice' but upon humanity and common sense.\"\n\n==''The Clarion''==\nIn 1890, while based in [[Manchester]], Blatchford became actively involved in the Labour Movement. He founded the Manchester branch of the [[Fabian Society]], and launched a weekly socialist newspaper, ''[[The Clarion]]'', in 1891. Later that year, he used his column to announce that he had accepted the invitation of the [[Bradford Labour Union]] to become the Independent Labour candidate in [[Bradford East (UK Parliament constituency)|Bradford East]]. However, his socialist stance forced him to leave the ''[[Sunday Chronicle]],'' which in turn left him with a severe reduction in income.\n\nHaving left the newspaper on 12 December 1891, Blatchford set up ''The Clarion'', but a printing error made its first edition was almost completely illegible.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} Nevertheless, it still sold at least 40,000 copies. It continued to sell this number and more during the following years. By 1910 it was selling about 80,000 copies of each issue. [[Bernard Semmel]] described it as \"the most successful socialist publication in Great Britain during the period before the war of 1914\".<ref>Semmel, p. 214.</ref>\n\nBy 1892 Blatchford had removed himself from the candidature in Bradford East and began siding with the [[Social Democratic Federation]] (SDF) against the Fabians' policy of \"permeation.\" The joining of ''The Clarion'' and SDF resulted in the formation in 1892 of the Manchester Independent Labour Party, which soon devised the Manchester Fourth Clause. By 1893 Blatchford was the leader of his own clique within the newly founded national [[Independent Labour Party]], the Clarionettes, whose extraordinary dynamism was expressed in its numerous choral societies, [[National Clarion Cycling Club|''Clarion'' cycling clubs]], Socialist Scouts, and glee clubs.\n\nCentral to the ''Clarion'' movement were the ''Clarion'' cycling clubs, whose members, frequently accompanied by the \"''Clarion'' Van\", travelled the country distributing socialist literature and holding mass meetings. [[Robert Tressell]]'s socialist novel ''[[The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists]]'' contains a detailed account based on a meeting organised by the [[National Clarion Cycling Club#Clarion Scouts|''Clarion'' scouts]].\n\nThe ''Clarion'' movement also supported many industrial disputes at this time, including the three-year lockout of the slateworkers of the [[Penrhyn Quarry|Penrhyn]] [[Slate industry|slate quarry]] in North [[Wales]]. ''The Clarion'' collected \u00a31,500 to support the people of [[Bethesda, Wales|Bethesda]].\n\nThere was a revolt in the county federation created by the ILP in 1894, as Blatchford urged the formation of a united socialist party. In the same year he resigned from the editorship of ''The Clarion'' due to ill health and developed depression. He started to edit it again in 1896. He supported the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], which lost him support from some sections of the labour movement. Blatchford denounced his \"cosmopolitan friends, who are so cosmopolitan that they can admire every country but their own, and love all men except Englishmen\".<ref name=\"Semmel, p. 217\">Semmel, p. 217.</ref> He criticised the \"smug, self-righteous prigs\" in the labour movement who, while \"despising military glory, are yet so eloquent over the marksmanship and courage of the Boers\".<ref name=\"Semmel, p. 217\"/> He wrote that his \"whole heart is with the British troops ... When England is at war, I'm English. I have no politics and no party. I am English.\"<ref name=\"Semmel, p. 218\">Semmel, p. 218.</ref>  Responding to claims from the right-wing press that he wanted to \u2018turn people against their country\u2019, he retorted that he wanted \u2018to make people so fond of their country that they shall desire to possess it\u2019.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Swift|first=David|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5949/liverpool/9781786940025.001.0001|title=For Class and Country|date=2017-11-01|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-1-78694-002-5}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war Blatchford continued to agitate for a united socialist party and supported the London Progressive Party. He was critical of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], which was founded in 1900, for what he perceived as its complete subservience to Liberalism, especially in its [[Cobdenism|Cobdenite]] internationalist views on foreign policy.<ref>Semmel, p. 215.</ref> Blatchford said of himself and his colleagues at ''The Clarion'': \"We were out for Socialism and nothing but Socialism, and we were Britons first and Socialists next.\"<ref>Blatchford, p. 199.</ref>\n\nBlatchford criticised free trade from an economic nationalist perspective. Free trade had made it impossible for Britain to feed herself and had destroyed British agriculture. This was especially serious in wartime because Britain could be starved into submission due to the dependence for her food on foreign nations.<ref name=\"Semmel, p. 218\"/> When [[Joseph Chamberlain]] launched his crusade for [[Tariff Reform League|Tariff Reform]] in 1903, Blatchford's response was ambiguous. He did not formally endorse Chamberlain's campaign, but ''The Clarion'' praised his aims\u2014the revival of British agriculture, a self-sufficient Empire, and producer-focused instead of consumer-focused economic system.<ref>Semmel, p. 219.</ref> Blatchford said he did not believe in tariff reform as applied by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], but that a socialist government would find it a necessary instrument.<ref>Semmel, p. 220.</ref>\n \nA further development in Blatchford's thinking cost him further readers, when he began denouncing organised religion in such works as ''God and My Neighbour'' in 1903 and \u2018Not Guilty: A Defence of the Bottom Dog\u2019 1905. Again, to antagonise the ILP, the ''Clarion'' raised funds for Victor Grayson, whom the ILP had declined to support. He justified his attacks as being because Labour was too close to the Liberals.\n\n==''Merrie England''==\n{{main|Merrie England (Robert Blatchford book)|l1=Merrie England}}\nA series of articles on socialism in ''The Clarion'' were published in book form in 1893 as ''Merrie England''. The first edition sold 30,000 copies. The year after, a pocket-sized edition was published, which sold 25,000 copies.<ref>Thompson, p. 98.</ref> A penny edition was published in 1894, with 250,000 copies being ordered before publication and within a year 750,000 copies had been despatched across the English speaking world.<ref>Thompson, p. 99.</ref> In Britain and America, the book sold over two million copies. In the opinion of [[Robert Ensor]], the book \"helped to make socialism really well known in England for the first time...It was Blatchford's highest flight as a propagandist; he never surpassed it, and through it mainly he left his mark upon history\".<ref name=\"ODNB\">R.

The motion was seconded by [[Hilaire Belloc]].<ref>Thompson, pp. 100-101.</ref>\n\nBlatchford was a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] and in ''Merrie England'' he mentioned the economic, health and humanitarian benefits of a vegetarian diet.<ref>Li, Chien-hui.

ISBN 978-1-137-52650-2</ref>\n\n==War scare of 1909==\nAt the end of the second week of December 1909, Blatchford wrote ten daily articles for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' warning of the German menace:\n\n<blockquote>I write these articles because I believe that Germany is deliberately preparing to destroy the British Empire; and because I know that we are not ready or able to defend ourselves against a sudden and formidable attack...At the present moment the whole country is in a ferment about the Budget and the Peers and the Election. It seems sheer criminal lunacy to waste time and strength in chasing such political bubble when the existence of the Empire is threatened.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 213\">Morris, p. 213.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe articles received considerable attention in Britain and Germany, and when published as a pamphlet sold over one and a half million copies.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 213\"/> The [[Edward VII|King]] \"lamented Blatchford's violence\"<ref>Morris, p. 213</ref> and the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser]] read Blatchford's articles with care and denounced them as \"very mischievous and singularly ill-timed\".<ref>Morris, p. 423, p. 219.</ref> Sir [[Charles Ottley]], the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence, wrote to [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] that Blatchford's appeal was not based on a partisan, political basis as he had said that the country did not want a Liberal or Unionist government but a MAN: \"His strength is that he knows what he wants and is not afraid to ask for it in plain language...The burthen of the song is\u2014compulsory service, a strong navy and a general raising of the standard of education and living of the masses of the British people\".<ref name=\"Morris, p. 214\">Morris, p. 214.</ref> [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]] publicly declared that he shared Blatchford's patriotism.<ref>Morris, p. 216.</ref> The articles ensured that defence was a major issue in the ensuing [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|general election of January 1910]].<ref>Morris, p. 215.</ref> After the election the Liberal MP [[Reginald McKenna]] boasted that Blatchford had not cost the Liberals a single vote.<ref>Blatchford, p. 224.</ref><ref name=\"Thompson, p. 216\">Thompson, p. 216.</ref> Keir Hardie said that \"the whole Socialist movement was rocking with suppressed laughter\".<ref>Blatchford, p. 225.</ref>\n\nThe ''Daily Mail''\u2032s Berlin correspondent told [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]]: \"In a long experience...I do not recall a foreign journalistic event which so focussed the attention of the German press and public\".<ref name=\"Morris, p. 214\"/> There was universal condemnation in German newspapers, including Social Democratic, Catholic and Pan-German organs. When the German Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] complained to [[Edward Goschen]], the British ambassador in Berlin, the Foreign Secretary Sir [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] advised Goschen to explain the articles as \"not really anti-German but alarmist...to create a scare\".<ref name=\"Morris, p. 214\"/>\n\nShortly before the [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|general election of December 1910]], the ''Daily Mail'' published Blatchford's series of articles on \u2018The Greatest Issue of All\u2019, the German threat. However these were nowhere near as influential as his previous ones and defence was not an issue in the election.<ref>Morris, p. 221.</ref>\n\nIn 1909 he began advocating conscription but in 1912 troops were used for strike breaking and Blatchford turned against it: \"Universal military service under the (present) ruling classes would result in slavery. I regard invasion as the lesser evil\". However he supported conscription again in 1915, and proclaimed it should be implemented along with the \"conscription of wealth\".<ref>Thompson, p. 215 + n.</ref> Before the Great War, Blatchford toured Germany and after he returned to England he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I am convinced that...they will be plunged into war without their will. I like Germany; I like German cities; and I like the German people. But I believe that the rulers of the German people are deliberately and cynically preparing to hurl them into a wicked and a desperate war of conquest...The Germans cannot prevent that war, because they do not believe it is coming. The British could prevent that war if, before it is too late, they could be really convinced that it is coming. That is why I want to convince them that war is coming, because I want to prevent that horrible war.<ref>Thompson, p. 213.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBlatchford was impressed by the cleanliness and efficiency in Germany: \"You don't see anything like that in Germany. I thought to myself, is this how we are preparing to fight for the existence of our Empire? What use will these ragged, famished spectres be when we have our backs to the wall?\"<ref>Thompson, p. 214.</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nOn 4 August 1914, Blatchford wrote to his friend [[Alexander M. Thompson|Alexander Thompson]]: \"I shall write today a cautious article counselling peace and suggesting that Sir [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|E. Grey]] should ask Russia and Germany to suspend hostilities pending a friendly mediation by America, England and Italy, or any one of those powers. But I do not think really that European peace is possible until Germany has been defeated and humiliated. And I realise the great possibility that we shall be at war with Germany before the ''Clarion'' comes out. And I hope we are\".<ref>Thompson, pp. 222\u2013223.</ref> The Clarion Movement was split when Blatchford swung his paper in support of the British participation in the [[First World War]]. The circulation for ''The Clarion'' fell by 10,000 in a week but when in September 1914 Blatchford wrote a page of ''The Weekly Dispatch'' every Sunday its circulation rose by 50,000.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 223\">Thompson, p. 223.</ref> In his first article for that paper, Blatchford correctly predicted that the German Army would not reach Paris and of General Joffre's flank along the Marne.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 223\"/>\n\nBlatchford visited France in October 1914 and was shocked by the conduct of the Germans in waging war. Initially warning his readers of fake atrocity stories, Blatchford was shocked by the ruined villages in France and the stories he heard, \"too horrible and too unclean to be revealed in print\". He wrote to Thompson in 1933: \"In the early days of the war the movement howled with indignation about the lying charges brought against the German General Staff and troops. The noble Germans were incapable of such crimes. British and Belgian and American witnesses were all liars. Today the same intelligent comrades are denouncing the atrocities committed by the Nazi 'storm troops' upon innocent and helpless Jews. Well, old pal, may I suggest that if the Germans of today are guilty perhaps the Huns of 1914 were not quite innocent\".<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 223\"/>\n\nIn his articles during the war, Blatchford campaigned for better pay for the soldiers and considerable pensions for disabled soldiers, soldiers' widows and children.<ref>Thompson, p. 224, p. 226.</ref> When a soldier wrote to him, claiming his opinions would not be accepted by the Army but those of [[Philip Snowden]] and [[Ramsay MacDonald]] would, Blatchford replied: \"I am sorry. I cannot help it. You want peace. But you cannot have peace without victory...The struggle with Germany will not end with the present war, and we may some day have to fight Germany single-handed\".<ref>Thompson, p. 226.</ref>\n\nIn 1915, Blatchford formed the [[National Democratic and Labour Party]] (NDP) as a splinter from the right wing of the [[British Socialist Party]] and for the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 General Election]], the NDP stood in 18 constituencies and won 9 [[Member of parliament|members of Parliament]] with 156,834 votes. It thereby became the first party formed by a right-wing split from the Labour party in Britain to win seats in Parliament at a general election.\n\nBlatchford's wife died in 1921, and later he took an interest in Spiritualism. In 1923 he wrote in response to claims in the press that he had been converted away from socialism by reading [[Henry Ford]]'s autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>I have never been converted from Socialism. But careful observation of the facts of for the last twelve years or so has convinced me that Socialism will not work, and a study of Mr. Ford's methods has provided what seems to me as good a substitute as we may hope in this imperfect world. Socialism as I knew it in past years was an excellent, almost a perfect, theory...The [[golden rule]] will not work in international politics, because the nations are not good enough to live up to it. Real Socialism strongly resembles real Christianity. It is a counsel of perfection and cannot be adopted and adhered to by our imperfect humanity. There is nothing the matter with Socialism, but the people are neither wise enough nor good enough to make it a success. Socialism implies the self-abnegation of the individual for the good of the community.<ref>Thompson, pp. 229\u2013230.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen the first Labour government, led by Ramsay MacDonald, took office in 1924, Blatchford responded to Thompson's enthusiasm: \"I don't like their policy and I don't trust them. They are in no sense Socialists. At present they are Liberals and we shall have a blend of Liberal shibboleths and communist insanity\".<ref>Thompson, p. 230.</ref> When [[Sir Edward Hulton, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Hulton]] sold most of his newspapers to [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]], Blatchford wrote a letter to ''The Morning Post'':\n\n<blockquote>As a protest against the attempt of the syndicated newspapers to muzzle the press and dictate to the Government, I have resigned my position on ''The Sunday Chronicle'' and ''The Sunday Herald''...the public should be helped to realise that the political judgments of the syndicated newspapers are not sincere and considered opinions of trained, independent thinkers, but the broadcast railings of one rich man in a panic over the [[Capital Levy]]. It is important that this should be said, and that the country should understand that the voice of Lord Rothermere is not the voice of public opinion. His standardised newspapers are journalistic tied houses, where proprietorial dope is sold as honest beer.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 232\">Thompson, p. 232.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBlatchford voted Conservative in 1924.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 232\"/> However, his later books indicate a continued faith in his own English version of socialism. Moreover, the Clarion Movement carried on as a socialist popular movement, taking its cue from Blatchford, into the 1930s and beyond, as indicated by the continued existence of the Clarion rambling and cycling clubs and the founding of the newspaper ''The New Clarion'' in 1932. In a 1931 letter to Alexander Thompson, Blatchford proclaimed his last political credo, his language remaining fiery and eloquent:\n\n<blockquote>I have always been a [[Tory Democracy|Tory Democrat]]...You remember that from the first the Clarion crowd and the [[Keir Hardie|Hardie]] crowd were out of harmony ... I loathe the \u201ctop-hatted, frock-coated magnolia-scented\u201d snobocracy as much as you do; but I cannot away with the Keir Hardies and [[Arthur Henderson]]s and Ramsay MacDonalds and [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]]s and [[James Maxton|Maxton]]s. Not long ago you told me in a letter of some trade union delegates who were smoking cigars and drinking whisky at the House of Commons at the expense of their unions. You liked them not. Nor do I like the Trade Union bigots who have cheated [[J. H. Thomas]] of his pension...I am glad the Labour Party is defeated because I believe they would have disrupted the British Empire. I dreaded their childish cosmopolitanism; their foolish faith that we could abolish crime by reducing the police force. All the other nations are out for their own ends. American enthusiasm for Naval Disarmament is not dictated by a love of peace. It is an expression of naval rivalry. All the nations hated our naval supremacy. Do the Americans love us? Do the French love us? Is France, America, Italy, devoted to an unselfish and human peace? Can we dispel the bellicose sentiments of Russia and China and Japan by sending an old pantaloon to talk platitudes at Geneva, or by disbanding the Horse Guards and scrapping a few submarines?...The England of my affection and devotion is not a country nor a people: it is a tradition, the finest tradition the world has ever produced. The Labour Party do not subscribe to that tradition; do not know it; could not feel it. And if that tradition is to survive, the policy of scuttle and surrender must be abandoned. You agree with all this I feel sure. You always upheld the [[Pax Britannica]]. We have not drifted apart, old pal: our separation is only geographical.<ref>Thompson, pp. 230\u2013231.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter [[Adolf Hitler]] became German Chancellor in 1933, Blatchford \"began to smell brimstone\", in the words of his biographer Laurence Thompson. Blatchford said: \"The people ought to know; but who will let me say what ought to be said?\" Blatchford feared that people would say: \"Oh, ''Blatchford''. He has Germany on the brain.\"<ref>Thompson, p. 233.</ref> When [[Winston Churchill]] began warning of the dangers of Nazi Germany, Blatchford remarked: \"Ha! He's learning! Now watch ''him'' get it in the neck\". Later on, Blatchford believed Churchill's conduct redeemed what he considered his past political errors.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 216\"/>\n\nOn 17 December 1943, Blatchford died in [[Horsham, Sussex]] at the age of 92.\n\n==Legacy==\nBlatchford's 'love of country' themes were not a late aberration but can be found throughout his output. His combination of libertarianism, socialism and conservatism mark him out as one of the more original activists in English political history. The first Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden, said of Blatchford in his autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>In these years Mr. Blatchford gave invaluable help to Socialist propaganda. No man did more than he to make Socialism understood by the ordinary working man. His writings in them had nothing of economic abstruseness. He based his appeal on the principles of human justice. He preached Socialism as a system of industrial co-operation for the common good. His arguments and illustrations were drawn from facts and experiences within the knowledge of the common people. Socialism as he taught it was not a cold, materialistic theory, but the promise of a new life as full, sweet and noble as the world can give...Mr. Blatchford is still living, hale and hearty, his mental powers undiminished at the ripe age of eighty-three. I saw him recently, and we talked of those grand and inspiring times of forty years ago. Only the men who were in the Socialist movement in those days can know the great part Robert Blatchford took in making it popular, and of the personal devotion he inspired by his writings.<ref>Philip, Viscount Snowden, ''An Autobiography. Volume One. 1864\u20131919'' (London: Ivor Nicholson and Watson, 1934), pp. 58\u201359.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress from 1925 to 1946, Sir [[Walter Citrine]], was influenced by Blatchford's writings. He said of ''Britain for the British'': \"I found it a cogent and reasoned argument for Socialism. It was written with a clearness and bite which were unusual\".<ref>Lord Citrine, ''Men and Work. An Autobiography'' (London: Hutchinson, 1964), p. 62.</ref> [[Clement Attlee]] also spoke of Blatchford's influence on his beliefs.<ref name=osborne>{{cite journal |last=Osborne |first=John W.|year=1997 |title=Robert Blatchford: Neglected Socialist |journal= The Journal of the Rutgers University Libraries|publisher=[[Rutgers University Libraries]] |volume=58 |pages=62\u201367 |doi=10.14713/jrul.v58i0.26 |doi-access=free }}</ref> [[A.

He was also noted as a prominent [[atheist]], [[Nationalist|nationalist]] and opponent of [[eugenics]]. In the early 1920s, after the death of his wife, he turned towards [[spiritualism]].\n\n==Early life==\nRobert Blatchford was born 17 March 1851 in [[Maidstone]], [[Kent]]. His parents \u2013 John Glanville Blatchford, a strolling comedian, and Georgina Louisa Corri ''(maiden;'' 1821\u20131890), an actress \u2013 named him after the conservative [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]] who died the year before. His great-grandfather, by way of his mother, [[Domenico Corri]] (1746\u20131825), was an Italian musician and publisher who, in the late [[18th century]], moved from [[Rome]] to [[Edinburgh]] to teach music.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> One of his grandnieces, [[Christine Glanville]] (1924\u20131999), was an acclaimed English puppeteer.\n\nBlatchford's father died in 1853, leaving him in the care of his mother. She continued her acting career for nine years, and Blatchford spent much of his early life close to the stage. To help support the family, Blatchford and his brother Montagu would perform with their mother, doing comedic renditions and dances for extra income. In 1862 the family moved to [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], where it was hoped that Blatchford and his brother could learn a trade. Blatchford was first employed as an odd job boy in a lithographic printing works, for which he earned a salary of eighteen pence a week. As a child he attended school only occasionally, firstly in Halifax and later in Portsmouth. Despite the brevity of his educational experience, it provided him with enough insight that he called the education system a 'cram' method.\n\nThough lacking a formal education, Blatchford taught himself from the age of eight, reading the [[Bible]], ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'', and the works of [[Charles Dickens]]. Throughout his childhood he was frail and sickly, and doctors suggested that he would not reach adulthood. This illness gave Blatchford time to read, something he would not have been able to pursue as thoroughly if employed. Around 1864, Georgina secured full-time employment as a dressmaker and immediately apprenticed both her sons, sending Montagu to a lithographic printer and Robert to a brushmaker. At the brushmaker factory, Blatchford met Sarah Crossley, who he would marry in 1880.\n\nBy 1871 Blatchford left Halifax, though his reason for doing so has been the cause of debate. Laurence Thomson argues that the departure was due to a quarrel with his mother, but Blatchford's daughter Dorothea maintains that his decision to leave was caused by the difficulty of his life in Halifax. On [[May Day]] 1871, Blatchford walked to Hull, then continued on to London via Yarmouth.\n\n==Military and early journalistic career==\nAfter leaving Halifax, Blatchford joined the [[British Army|Army]] and rose to become a [[sergeant major]] by 1874. By the time of his promotion, he had also achieved the Army's second class certificate of education. Blatchford served with the Irish regiment 103rd [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers|Dublin Fusiliers]] and the [[96th Regiment of Foot]]. The pleasures of army life stimulated some of Blatchford's best writing, but in 1877 he left the army to become a clerk in the [[River Weaver|Weaver Navigation Company]]. While employed as a clerk, he carefully used his spare time to learn grammar, syntax, and shorthand. In 1880 he married Sarah Crossley, whom he met in Halifax, at the Zion Chapel in Halifax; they then settled in [[Norwich]]. Sarah was the daughter of a [[domestic worker|domestic servant]] and a mechanic. Around this time Blatchford became frustrated with his job, and decided that he wished to become an artist. Because employment opportunities for artists in Norwich were scarce, however, he instead decided to become a writer. Blatchford's writing career began in 1882 at the ''Yorkshireman'' newspaper, where he had a sketch published. He obtained his first full-time writing job through his friend Alexander Muttock Thompson, who worked for the Manchester ''[[Sporting Chronicle]]''. Thompson recommended Blatchford to a friend who ran the newspaper ''[[Bell's Life in London]]''. A year later, Blatchford moved his family to South London to write for ''Bell's Life'' and the ''Leeds Toby''.\n\nIn 1885, Blatchford began to write for the Manchester ''[[Sunday Chronicle]]''. When ''Bell's Life'' failed two years later, he moved to a full-time position at the ''Sunday Chronicle''. Before beginning at the ''Sunday Chronicle'', Blatchford took a short holiday on the Isle of Wight after the death of his two children. At this time he had not begun to espouse socialist views, but the societal reactions to the competitiveness of industrial society in Northern England began affecting his sentiments. The largest political influence on Blatchford was the South [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] [[Social Democratic Federation]]. This change is seen in a series of 1889 articles he wrote for the ''Sunday Chronicle'' which denounced the housing conditions in Manchester and organised two working men's Sanitary Organisations in the area.\n\nReflecting back on this period, Blatchford stated in the ''Fortnightly Review'' in 1907 that \"Dr. Cozier is mistaken if he thinks I took my Socialism from [[Karl Marx|Marx]], or that it depends upon the Marxian theory of value. I have never read a page of Marx. I got the idea of collective ownership from [[Henry Hyndman|H. M. Hyndman]]; the rest of my Socialism I thought out myself. English Socialism is not German: it is English. English Socialism is not Marxian; it is humanitarian. It does not depend upon any theory of 'economic justice' but upon humanity and common sense.\"\n\n==''The Clarion''==\nIn 1890, while based in [[Manchester]], Blatchford became actively involved in the Labour Movement. He founded the Manchester branch of the [[Fabian Society]], and launched a weekly socialist newspaper, ''[[The Clarion]]'', in 1891. Later that year, he used his column to announce that he had accepted the invitation of the [[Bradford Labour Union]] to become the Independent Labour candidate in [[Bradford East (UK Parliament constituency)|Bradford East]]. However, his socialist stance forced him to leave the ''[[Sunday Chronicle]],'' which in turn left him with a severe reduction in income.\n\nHaving left the newspaper on 12 December 1891, Blatchford set up ''The Clarion'', but a printing error made its first edition was almost completely illegible.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} Nevertheless, it still sold at least 40,000 copies. It continued to sell this number and more during the following years. By 1910 it was selling about 80,000 copies of each issue. [[Bernard Semmel]] described it as \"the most successful socialist publication in Great Britain during the period before the war of 1914\".<ref>Semmel, p. 214.</ref>\n\nBy 1892 Blatchford had removed himself from the candidature in Bradford East and began siding with the [[Social Democratic Federation]] (SDF) against the Fabians' policy of \"permeation.\" The joining of ''The Clarion'' and SDF resulted in the formation in 1892 of the Manchester Independent Labour Party, which soon devised the Manchester Fourth Clause. By 1893 Blatchford was the leader of his own clique within the newly founded national [[Independent Labour Party]], the Clarionettes, whose extraordinary dynamism was expressed in its numerous choral societies, [[National Clarion Cycling Club|''Clarion'' cycling clubs]], Socialist Scouts, and glee clubs.\n\nCentral to the ''Clarion'' movement were the ''Clarion'' cycling clubs, whose members, frequently accompanied by the \"''Clarion'' Van\", travelled the country distributing socialist literature and holding mass meetings. [[Robert Tressell]]'s socialist novel ''[[The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists]]'' contains a detailed account based on a meeting organised by the [[National Clarion Cycling Club#Clarion Scouts|''Clarion'' scouts]].\n\nThe ''Clarion'' movement also supported many industrial disputes at this time, including the three-year lockout of the slateworkers of the [[Penrhyn Quarry|Penrhyn]] [[Slate industry|slate quarry]] in North [[Wales]]. ''The Clarion'' collected \u00a31,500 to support the people of [[Bethesda, Wales|Bethesda]].\n\nThere was a revolt in the county federation created by the ILP in 1894, as Blatchford urged the formation of a united socialist party. In the same year he resigned from the editorship of ''The Clarion'' due to ill health and developed depression. He started to edit it again in 1896. He supported the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], which lost him support from some sections of the labour movement. Blatchford denounced his \"cosmopolitan friends, who are so cosmopolitan that they can admire every country but their own, and love all men except Englishmen\".<ref name=\"Semmel, p. 217\">Semmel, p. 217.</ref> He criticised the \"smug, self-righteous prigs\" in the labour movement who, while \"despising military glory, are yet so eloquent over the marksmanship and courage of the Boers\".<ref name=\"Semmel, p. 217\"/> He wrote that his \"whole heart is with the British troops ... When England is at war, I'm English. I have no politics and no party. I am English.\"<ref name=\"Semmel, p. 218\">Semmel, p. 218.</ref>  Responding to claims from the right-wing press that he wanted to \u2018turn people against their country\u2019, he retorted that he wanted \u2018to make people so fond of their country that they shall desire to possess it\u2019.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Swift|first=David|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5949/liverpool/9781786940025.001.0001|title=For Class and Country|date=2017-11-01|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-1-78694-002-5}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war Blatchford continued to agitate for a united socialist party and supported the London Progressive Party. He was critical of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], which was founded in 1900, for what he perceived as its complete subservience to Liberalism, especially in its [[Cobdenism|Cobdenite]] internationalist views on foreign policy.<ref>Semmel, p. 215.</ref> Blatchford said of himself and his colleagues at ''The Clarion'': \"We were out for Socialism and nothing but Socialism, and we were Britons first and Socialists next.\"<ref>Blatchford, p. 199.</ref>\n\nBlatchford criticised free trade from an economic nationalist perspective. Free trade had made it impossible for Britain to feed herself and had destroyed British agriculture. This was especially serious in wartime because Britain could be starved into submission due to the dependence for her food on foreign nations.<ref name=\"Semmel, p. 218\"/> When [[Joseph Chamberlain]] launched his crusade for [[Tariff Reform League|Tariff Reform]] in 1903, Blatchford's response was ambiguous. He did not formally endorse Chamberlain's campaign, but ''The Clarion'' praised his aims\u2014the revival of British agriculture, a self-sufficient Empire, and producer-focused instead of consumer-focused economic system.<ref>Semmel, p. 219.</ref> Blatchford said he did not believe in tariff reform as applied by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], but that a socialist government would find it a necessary instrument.<ref>Semmel, p. 220.</ref>\n \nA further development in Blatchford's thinking cost him further readers, when he began denouncing organised religion in such works as ''God and My Neighbour'' in 1903 and \u2018Not Guilty: A Defence of the Bottom Dog\u2019 1905. Again, to antagonise the ILP, the ''Clarion'' raised funds for Victor Grayson, whom the ILP had declined to support. He justified his attacks as being because Labour was too close to the Liberals.\n\n==''Merrie England''==\n{{main|Merrie England (Robert Blatchford book)|l1=Merrie England}}\nA series of articles on socialism in ''The Clarion'' were published in book form in 1893 as ''Merrie England''. The first edition sold 30,000 copies. The year after, a pocket-sized edition was published, which sold 25,000 copies.<ref>Thompson, p. 98.</ref> A penny edition was published in 1894, with 250,000 copies being ordered before publication and within a year 750,000 copies had been despatched across the English speaking world.<ref>Thompson, p. 99.</ref> In Britain and America, the book sold over two million copies. In the opinion of [[Robert Ensor]], the book \"helped to make socialism really well known in England for the first time...It was Blatchford's highest flight as a propagandist; he never surpassed it, and through it mainly he left his mark upon history\".<ref name=\"ODNB\">R.

P. Scott]] of the ''Manchester Guardian'' wrote to Blatchford, saying: \"I have been reading ''Merrie England'' and (''pace'' the reviewers) find a great deal in it!\"<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 100\"/> The ''Manchester Guardian'' said that for every British convert to socialism made by ''[[Das Kapital]]'' there were a hundred made by ''Merrie England''.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 101\"/>\n\nAt the [[Oxford Union]] a motion was approved by 103 to 54 that stated that \"the aims of the Socialist tract, ''Merrie England'', are but the baseless fabric of a vision\". The motion was seconded by [[Hilaire Belloc]].<ref>Thompson, pp. 100-101.</ref>\n\nBlatchford was a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] and in ''Merrie England'' he mentioned the economic, health and humanitarian benefits of a vegetarian diet.<ref>Li, Chien-hui.

ISBN 978-1-137-52650-2</ref>\n\n==War scare of 1909==\nAt the end of the second week of December 1909, Blatchford wrote ten daily articles for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' warning of the German menace:\n\n<blockquote>I write these articles because I believe that Germany is deliberately preparing to destroy the British Empire; and because I know that we are not ready or able to defend ourselves against a sudden and formidable attack...At the present moment the whole country is in a ferment about the Budget and the Peers and the Election. It seems sheer criminal lunacy to waste time and strength in chasing such political bubble when the existence of the Empire is threatened.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 213\">Morris, p. 213.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe articles received considerable attention in Britain and Germany, and when published as a pamphlet sold over one and a half million copies.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 213\"/> The [[Edward VII|King]] \"lamented Blatchford's violence\"<ref>Morris, p. 213</ref> and the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser]] read Blatchford's articles with care and denounced them as \"very mischievous and singularly ill-timed\".<ref>Morris, p. 423, p. 219.</ref> Sir [[Charles Ottley]], the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence, wrote to [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] that Blatchford's appeal was not based on a partisan, political basis as he had said that the country did not want a Liberal or Unionist government but a MAN: \"His strength is that he knows what he wants and is not afraid to ask for it in plain language...The burthen of the song is\u2014compulsory service, a strong navy and a general raising of the standard of education and living of the masses of the British people\".<ref name=\"Morris, p. 214\">Morris, p. 214.</ref> [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]] publicly declared that he shared Blatchford's patriotism.<ref>Morris, p. 216.</ref> The articles ensured that defence was a major issue in the ensuing [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|general election of January 1910]].<ref>Morris, p. 215.</ref> After the election the Liberal MP [[Reginald McKenna]] boasted that Blatchford had not cost the Liberals a single vote.<ref>Blatchford, p. 224.</ref><ref name=\"Thompson, p. 216\">Thompson, p. 216.</ref> Keir Hardie said that \"the whole Socialist movement was rocking with suppressed laughter\".<ref>Blatchford, p. 225.</ref>\n\nThe ''Daily Mail''\u2032s Berlin correspondent told [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]]: \"In a long experience...I do not recall a foreign journalistic event which so focussed the attention of the German press and public\".<ref name=\"Morris, p. 214\"/> There was universal condemnation in German newspapers, including Social Democratic, Catholic and Pan-German organs. When the German Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] complained to [[Edward Goschen]], the British ambassador in Berlin, the Foreign Secretary Sir [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] advised Goschen to explain the articles as \"not really anti-German but alarmist...to create a scare\".<ref name=\"Morris, p. 214\"/>\n\nShortly before the [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|general election of December 1910]], the ''Daily Mail'' published Blatchford's series of articles on \u2018The Greatest Issue of All\u2019, the German threat. However these were nowhere near as influential as his previous ones and defence was not an issue in the election.<ref>Morris, p. 221.</ref>\n\nIn 1909 he began advocating conscription but in 1912 troops were used for strike breaking and Blatchford turned against it: \"Universal military service under the (present) ruling classes would result in slavery. I regard invasion as the lesser evil\". However he supported conscription again in 1915, and proclaimed it should be implemented along with the \"conscription of wealth\".<ref>Thompson, p. 215 + n.</ref> Before the Great War, Blatchford toured Germany and after he returned to England he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I am convinced that...they will be plunged into war without their will. I like Germany; I like German cities; and I like the German people. But I believe that the rulers of the German people are deliberately and cynically preparing to hurl them into a wicked and a desperate war of conquest...The Germans cannot prevent that war, because they do not believe it is coming. The British could prevent that war if, before it is too late, they could be really convinced that it is coming. That is why I want to convince them that war is coming, because I want to prevent that horrible war.<ref>Thompson, p. 213.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBlatchford was impressed by the cleanliness and efficiency in Germany: \"You don't see anything like that in Germany. I thought to myself, is this how we are preparing to fight for the existence of our Empire? What use will these ragged, famished spectres be when we have our backs to the wall?\"<ref>Thompson, p. 214.</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nOn 4 August 1914, Blatchford wrote to his friend [[Alexander M. Thompson|Alexander Thompson]]: \"I shall write today a cautious article counselling peace and suggesting that Sir [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|E. Grey]] should ask Russia and Germany to suspend hostilities pending a friendly mediation by America, England and Italy, or any one of those powers. But I do not think really that European peace is possible until Germany has been defeated and humiliated. And I realise the great possibility that we shall be at war with Germany before the ''Clarion'' comes out. And I hope we are\".<ref>Thompson, pp. 222\u2013223.</ref> The Clarion Movement was split when Blatchford swung his paper in support of the British participation in the [[First World War]]. The circulation for ''The Clarion'' fell by 10,000 in a week but when in September 1914 Blatchford wrote a page of ''The Weekly Dispatch'' every Sunday its circulation rose by 50,000.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 223\">Thompson, p. 223.</ref> In his first article for that paper, Blatchford correctly predicted that the German Army would not reach Paris and of General Joffre's flank along the Marne.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 223\"/>\n\nBlatchford visited France in October 1914 and was shocked by the conduct of the Germans in waging war. Initially warning his readers of fake atrocity stories, Blatchford was shocked by the ruined villages in France and the stories he heard, \"too horrible and too unclean to be revealed in print\". He wrote to Thompson in 1933: \"In the early days of the war the movement howled with indignation about the lying charges brought against the German General Staff and troops. The noble Germans were incapable of such crimes. British and Belgian and American witnesses were all liars. Today the same intelligent comrades are denouncing the atrocities committed by the Nazi 'storm troops' upon innocent and helpless Jews. Well, old pal, may I suggest that if the Germans of today are guilty perhaps the Huns of 1914 were not quite innocent\".<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 223\"/>\n\nIn his articles during the war, Blatchford campaigned for better pay for the soldiers and considerable pensions for disabled soldiers, soldiers' widows and children.<ref>Thompson, p. 224, p. 226.</ref> When a soldier wrote to him, claiming his opinions would not be accepted by the Army but those of [[Philip Snowden]] and [[Ramsay MacDonald]] would, Blatchford replied: \"I am sorry. I cannot help it. You want peace. But you cannot have peace without victory...The struggle with Germany will not end with the present war, and we may some day have to fight Germany single-handed\".<ref>Thompson, p. 226.</ref>\n\nIn 1915, Blatchford formed the [[National Democratic and Labour Party]] (NDP) as a splinter from the right wing of the [[British Socialist Party]] and for the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 General Election]], the NDP stood in 18 constituencies and won 9 [[Member of parliament|members of Parliament]] with 156,834 votes. It thereby became the first party formed by a right-wing split from the Labour party in Britain to win seats in Parliament at a general election.\n\nBlatchford's wife died in 1921, and later he took an interest in Spiritualism. In 1923 he wrote in response to claims in the press that he had been converted away from socialism by reading [[Henry Ford]]'s autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>I have never been converted from Socialism. But careful observation of the facts of for the last twelve years or so has convinced me that Socialism will not work, and a study of Mr. Ford's methods has provided what seems to me as good a substitute as we may hope in this imperfect world. Socialism as I knew it in past years was an excellent, almost a perfect, theory...The [[golden rule]] will not work in international politics, because the nations are not good enough to live up to it. Real Socialism strongly resembles real Christianity. It is a counsel of perfection and cannot be adopted and adhered to by our imperfect humanity. There is nothing the matter with Socialism, but the people are neither wise enough nor good enough to make it a success. Socialism implies the self-abnegation of the individual for the good of the community.<ref>Thompson, pp. 229\u2013230.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen the first Labour government, led by Ramsay MacDonald, took office in 1924, Blatchford responded to Thompson's enthusiasm: \"I don't like their policy and I don't trust them. They are in no sense Socialists. At present they are Liberals and we shall have a blend of Liberal shibboleths and communist insanity\".<ref>Thompson, p. 230.</ref> When [[Sir Edward Hulton, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Hulton]] sold most of his newspapers to [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]], Blatchford wrote a letter to ''The Morning Post'':\n\n<blockquote>As a protest against the attempt of the syndicated newspapers to muzzle the press and dictate to the Government, I have resigned my position on ''The Sunday Chronicle'' and ''The Sunday Herald''...the public should be helped to realise that the political judgments of the syndicated newspapers are not sincere and considered opinions of trained, independent thinkers, but the broadcast railings of one rich man in a panic over the [[Capital Levy]]. It is important that this should be said, and that the country should understand that the voice of Lord Rothermere is not the voice of public opinion. His standardised newspapers are journalistic tied houses, where proprietorial dope is sold as honest beer.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 232\">Thompson, p. 232.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBlatchford voted Conservative in 1924.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 232\"/> However, his later books indicate a continued faith in his own English version of socialism. Moreover, the Clarion Movement carried on as a socialist popular movement, taking its cue from Blatchford, into the 1930s and beyond, as indicated by the continued existence of the Clarion rambling and cycling clubs and the founding of the newspaper ''The New Clarion'' in 1932. In a 1931 letter to Alexander Thompson, Blatchford proclaimed his last political credo, his language remaining fiery and eloquent:\n\n<blockquote>I have always been a [[Tory Democracy|Tory Democrat]]...You remember that from the first the Clarion crowd and the [[Keir Hardie|Hardie]] crowd were out of harmony ... I loathe the \u201ctop-hatted, frock-coated magnolia-scented\u201d snobocracy as much as you do; but I cannot away with the Keir Hardies and [[Arthur Henderson]]s and Ramsay MacDonalds and [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]]s and [[James Maxton|Maxton]]s. Not long ago you told me in a letter of some trade union delegates who were smoking cigars and drinking whisky at the House of Commons at the expense of their unions. You liked them not. Nor do I like the Trade Union bigots who have cheated [[J. H. Thomas]] of his pension...I am glad the Labour Party is defeated because I believe they would have disrupted the British Empire. I dreaded their childish cosmopolitanism; their foolish faith that we could abolish crime by reducing the police force. All the other nations are out for their own ends. American enthusiasm for Naval Disarmament is not dictated by a love of peace. It is an expression of naval rivalry. All the nations hated our naval supremacy. Do the Americans love us? Do the French love us? Is France, America, Italy, devoted to an unselfish and human peace? Can we dispel the bellicose sentiments of Russia and China and Japan by sending an old pantaloon to talk platitudes at Geneva, or by disbanding the Horse Guards and scrapping a few submarines?...The England of my affection and devotion is not a country nor a people: it is a tradition, the finest tradition the world has ever produced. The Labour Party do not subscribe to that tradition; do not know it; could not feel it. And if that tradition is to survive, the policy of scuttle and surrender must be abandoned. You agree with all this I feel sure. You always upheld the [[Pax Britannica]]. We have not drifted apart, old pal: our separation is only geographical.<ref>Thompson, pp. 230\u2013231.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter [[Adolf Hitler]] became German Chancellor in 1933, Blatchford \"began to smell brimstone\", in the words of his biographer Laurence Thompson. Blatchford said: \"The people ought to know; but who will let me say what ought to be said?\" Blatchford feared that people would say: \"Oh, ''Blatchford''. He has Germany on the brain.\"<ref>Thompson, p. 233.</ref> When [[Winston Churchill]] began warning of the dangers of Nazi Germany, Blatchford remarked: \"Ha! He's learning! Now watch ''him'' get it in the neck\". Later on, Blatchford believed Churchill's conduct redeemed what he considered his past political errors.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 216\"/>\n\nOn 17 December 1943, Blatchford died in [[Horsham, Sussex]] at the age of 92.\n\n==Legacy==\nBlatchford's 'love of country' themes were not a late aberration but can be found throughout his output. His combination of libertarianism, socialism and conservatism mark him out as one of the more original activists in English political history. The first Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden, said of Blatchford in his autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>In these years Mr. Blatchford gave invaluable help to Socialist propaganda. No man did more than he to make Socialism understood by the ordinary working man. His writings in them had nothing of economic abstruseness. He based his appeal on the principles of human justice. He preached Socialism as a system of industrial co-operation for the common good. His arguments and illustrations were drawn from facts and experiences within the knowledge of the common people. Socialism as he taught it was not a cold, materialistic theory, but the promise of a new life as full, sweet and noble as the world can give...Mr. Blatchford is still living, hale and hearty, his mental powers undiminished at the ripe age of eighty-three. I saw him recently, and we talked of those grand and inspiring times of forty years ago. Only the men who were in the Socialist movement in those days can know the great part Robert Blatchford took in making it popular, and of the personal devotion he inspired by his writings.<ref>Philip, Viscount Snowden, ''An Autobiography. Volume One. 1864\u20131919'' (London: Ivor Nicholson and Watson, 1934), pp. 58\u201359.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress from 1925 to 1946, Sir [[Walter Citrine]], was influenced by Blatchford's writings. He said of ''Britain for the British'': \"I found it a cogent and reasoned argument for Socialism. It was written with a clearness and bite which were unusual\".<ref>Lord Citrine, ''Men and Work. An Autobiography'' (London: Hutchinson, 1964), p. 62.</ref> [[Clement Attlee]] also spoke of Blatchford's influence on his beliefs.<ref name=osborne>{{cite journal |last=Osborne |first=John W.|year=1997 |title=Robert Blatchford: Neglected Socialist |journal= The Journal of the Rutgers University Libraries|publisher=[[Rutgers University Libraries]] |volume=58 |pages=62\u201367 |doi=10.14713/jrul.v58i0.26 |doi-access=free }}</ref> [[A.

It is located in Turi and often referred to by that name.\n\nSt Andrew\u2019s School is a co-educational, Christian boarding school offering the British Curriculum to pupils aged five to thirteen in the Preparatory school and thirteen to nineteen in the Senior School and College. The school sits on a grand {{convert|300|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate in the Kenyan Highlands. The school's curriculum is predominantly based on the British model, with students sitting IGCSE's and A' Levels, and as such, many of the teachers are British trained.\n\nThe student population is made up of pupils from a large number of countries; however, the overwhelming majority of students are Kenyan, Ugandan, Tanzanian, Nigerian and Rwandan. It also has a large expatriate contingent, many of whom are the children of [[Protestant]] [[missionaries]]. On completion of their studies at Turi, pupils go on to study at prestigious universities around the world, though predominantly in the UK.\n\nThe headmaster of the Senior School is Andrew Boulle and the headmaster of the Preparatory School is Fergus Llewelyn.\n\n==History==\nThe preparatory school was started in 1931 by Mr and Mrs Lavers, affectionately known as \"Ma and Pa Lavers\", to provide education for the children of local farmers. The first school had 15 children but steadily grew to serve over 100 children from Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyka by the 1940s. In 1944 the school was burnt to the ground after a fire in a kitchen. The Colonial British government gave permission for Italian [[prisoners of war]] to help construct a new school as the estimated cost of rebuilding was very high. The new school building was erected in stone instead of wood.\n\nThe crest of the school features a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] rising from the flames, and an annual [[bonfire]] night commemorates this episode in the school's history. In 1988 the secondary school was opened for 13- to 18-year-old children.\n\n==Preparatory School==\nPupils are taught in a class setting from the age of five. Thereafter, subject teaching is introduced gradually until all curriculum areas are taught by specialist teachers in Years 6 and 7. By the end of Year 8, pupils are prepared for the IAPS Common Entrance Exam in which pupils are tested in seven subjects (English, Maths, Science, French, Geography, History and Religious Studies).\n\n==Senior School==\nA wide curriculum is delivered in Year 9, ensuring informed choices for IGCSE study in Years 10 and 11. Following IGCSEs, students generally study four subjects at AS Level before finally selecting their three A2 courses. Students in the Sixth Form College also follow leadership and service programmes as part of their wider education and preparation for adult life.\n\n==College==\nThe school has a Sixth Form.  It provides \u2018A\u2019 Level education to prepare students for university.\n\n==Extra-curricular activities==\nFacilities on the {{convert|300|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate include a swimming pool, tennis courts, a squash court and pitches (turf wickets) which stay green all year round with green outfields. A new purpose-built sports centre has been built. In addition, horse riding and music (with numerous pianos) are key popular activities.\n\n==Pastoral Care==\nMost pupils board full-time, with a small minority opting to be weekly boarders.
