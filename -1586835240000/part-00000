Like all the other Arkansas regiments raised in the first wave of recruiting in 1861, they were taken into Confederate armies east of the Mississippi River, and only the few survivors made it back home after the war.  The 9th was present, across the river at Columbus Kentucky during the Battle of Belmont, Missouri and was subsequently retained at Bowling Green, Kentucky, for the defense of that post during the winter of 1861-1862. The regiment was assigned to General Bowen's Brigade, consisting of the 9th and [[10th Arkansas Infantry Regiment|10th Arkansas]], 5th Missouri and 10th Mississippi Infantry Regiments before they were moved to Kentucky.<ref name=\"Confederate Military History\">Harrell, Col.

After the losses of [[Fort Henry (site of the Battle of Fort Henry)|Fort Henry]] and [[Fort Donelson]] in February 1862, Confederate General [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] withdrew his forces into western Tennessee, northern Mississippi, and Alabama to reorganize. and then retreated through western Tennessee to Corinth, Mississippi. On March 29, 1862, the [[Army of Central Kentucky]] was merged into the [[Army of Mississippi]] in preparation for the Battle of Shiloh. Bowen's Brigade, including the 9th and 10th Arkansas Infantry Regiments, was then placed in General Brigadier General [[John C. Breckinridge]]'s Reserve Corps as part of the [[Army of Mississippi]]. It fought gallantly at Shiloh, charging repeatedly upon the \"Hornet's Nest\" where it lost Lieutenant Colonel Dunlop. It was through this regiment that General [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] rode from the rear to the front, with a tin cup he had appropriated earlier that morning, saying \"Men of Arkansas, the enemy is stubborn. I want you to show General Beauregard and General Bragg what you can do with your bayonets and toothpicks!\" The regiment went forward with a cheer and passed him at a run; in five minutes 130 men of their ranks were killed or wounded, but they did not falter. Lieutenant Duckworth was killed at the head of his company, and Captain Wallace was wounded. It closed up and disappeared into the thicket in front, followed by the whole Confederate line, and the enemy was silenced in twenty minutes. General Johnston, however, received a mortal wound while leading this charge, and shortly thereafter bled to death.  The unit reported 17 killed and 115 wounded at Shiloh.<ref name=\"nps\"/><ref>United States. War Department.

The 9th served in Brigadier General [[Abraham Buford]]'s brigade of Major General [[William W. Loring]]'s division of Lieutenant General [[John C. Pemberton]]'s Confederate Army at Champion Hill, and following that battle, Loring retreated north to join General [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s army near Jackson rather than being trapped with the rest of Pemberton's army in the Vicksburg defenses. Johnston had been gathering troops at Jackson, intending to relieve pressure on Lt. Gen. [[John C. Pemberton]]'s beleaguered garrison. Johnston cautiously advanced his 30,000 soldiers toward the rear of Grant's army surrounding Vicksburg.<ref name=\"Korn, Jerry 1985. Page 156\">Korn, Jerry, and the Editors of Time-Life Books.

Sherman used the newly arrived [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]] to counter this threat.

Like all the other Arkansas regiments raised in the first wave of recruiting in 1861, they were taken into Confederate armies east of the Mississippi River, and only the few survivors made it back home after the war.  The 9th was present, across the river at Columbus Kentucky during the Battle of Belmont, Missouri and was subsequently retained at Bowling Green, Kentucky, for the defense of that post during the winter of 1861-1862. The regiment was assigned to General Bowen's Brigade, consisting of the 9th and [[10th Arkansas Infantry Regiment|10th Arkansas]], 5th Missouri and 10th Mississippi Infantry Regiments before they were moved to Kentucky.<ref name=\"Confederate Military History\">Harrell, Col.

After the losses of [[Fort Henry (site of the Battle of Fort Henry)|Fort Henry]] and [[Fort Donelson]] in February 1862, Confederate General [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] withdrew his forces into western Tennessee, northern Mississippi, and Alabama to reorganize. and then retreated through western Tennessee to Corinth, Mississippi. On March 29, 1862, the [[Army of Central Kentucky]] was merged into the [[Army of Mississippi]] in preparation for the Battle of Shiloh. Bowen's Brigade, including the 9th and 10th Arkansas Infantry Regiments, was then placed in General Brigadier General [[John C. Breckinridge]]'s Reserve Corps as part of the [[Army of Mississippi]]. It fought gallantly at Shiloh, charging repeatedly upon the \"Hornet's Nest\" where it lost Lieutenant Colonel Dunlop. It was through this regiment that General [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] rode from the rear to the front, with a tin cup he had appropriated earlier that morning, saying \"Men of Arkansas, the enemy is stubborn. I want you to show General Beauregard and General Bragg what you can do with your bayonets and toothpicks!\" The regiment went forward with a cheer and passed him at a run; in five minutes 130 men of their ranks were killed or wounded, but they did not falter. Lieutenant Duckworth was killed at the head of his company, and Captain Wallace was wounded. It closed up and disappeared into the thicket in front, followed by the whole Confederate line, and the enemy was silenced in twenty minutes. General Johnston, however, received a mortal wound while leading this charge, and shortly thereafter bled to death.  The unit reported 17 killed and 115 wounded at Shiloh.<ref name=\"nps\"/><ref>United States. War Department.

The 9th served in Brigadier General [[Abraham Buford]]'s brigade of Major General [[William W. Loring]]'s division of Lieutenant General [[John C.

Johnston]]'s army near Jackson rather than being trapped with the rest of Pemberton's army in the Vicksburg defenses. Johnston had been gathering troops at Jackson, intending to relieve pressure on Lt. Gen. [[John C. Pemberton]]'s beleaguered garrison. Johnston cautiously advanced his 30,000 soldiers toward the rear of Grant's army surrounding Vicksburg.<ref name=\"Korn, Jerry 1985. Page 156\">Korn, Jerry, and the Editors of Time-Life Books.

By July 1, 1863, Johnston's force was in position along the [[Big Black River (Mississippi)|Big Black River]]. Sherman used the newly arrived [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]] to counter this threat. On July 5, the day after the surrender of Vicksburg was made official; Sherman was free to move against Johnston.
