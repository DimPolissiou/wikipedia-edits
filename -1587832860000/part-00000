The league was cancelled with Partizani Tiran\u00eb B in 1st place out of 8 teams and Partizani dissolved their reserve team soon after, as they finished with a record of 5 wins out 5 and a goalscoring record of 25 scored and 5 conceded.\n\n===FC Nacional (2003\u20132004)===\nIn 2003, Partizani took over local side FC Nacional Tiran\u00eb and used it as a reserve side in the 2003\u201304 [[Albanian Second Division]].\n\n===Partizani B (2013\u2013present)===\nOn 15 March 2013, Partizani B defeated IDS Tirana 8\u20131 away from home in an [[Albanian Third Division]] Group B game, making it the club's biggest ever victory.<ref>[http://www.fshf.org/garat/components/match.php?match_id=147948 IDS 1\u20138 Partizani B]</ref><ref>[http://www.panorama-sport.com/kategoria-e-dyte/shperthen-partizani-b-tete-gola-amatoreve/ Shp\u00ebrthen Partizani B, tet\u00eb gola amator\u00ebve] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221213004/http://www.panorama-sport.com/kategoria-e-dyte/shperthen-partizani-b-tete-gola-amatoreve/ |date=February 21, 2014 }}</ref> However, this record was broken a couple of months later on 1 May against FK Gostima in a 13\u20132 victory again away from home.<ref>[http://www.fshf.org/garat/components/match.php?match_id=147924 Gostimar 2\u201313 Partizani B]</ref> '''FK Partizani B''' gained promotion to the [[Albanian Second Division]]\n\nDuring the 2015\u201316 campaign in the [[Albanian Second Division]], Partizani B began the season inconsistently, winning just 6 of their first 14 games before going on to win 7 of their last 8 games, ending the season on a 16 game unbeaten run which earned them a runners up sport in Group A of the Second Division and a place in the [[Albanian First Division]] playoffs.

The Albanian FA decided to revoke Partizani B's promotion as they awarded the game to Sopoti Librazhd 3\u20130 due to Partizani B having broken the rules by featuring Ibrahimi and Ramadani, as a

[[Football club|club]] [[FK Partizani Tirana|Partizani Tirana]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Partizani reserves (1948\u20131949)===\nOn 3 October 1948 the [[Albanian Football Association]] launched a new format for the [[Albanian Superliga]] and [[Albanian First Division]] as they adopted the western format of a autumn to spring league competition. A reserve team representing [[Partizani Tirana]] was created following this announcement, and they competed in 1948\u201349 Albanian First Division, where they won their first 5 games in a row before the competition was cancelled on 31 March 1949 by the Albanian Football Association due to Soviet pressure to leave the western format and return to the Soviet league format. The league was cancelled with Partizani Tiran\u00eb B in 1st place out of 8 teams and Partizani dissolved their reserve team soon after, as they finished with a record of 5 wins out 5 and a goalscoring record of 25 scored and 5 conceded.\n\n===FC Nacional (2003\u20132004)===\nIn 2003 Partizani took over local side FC Nacional Tiran\u00eb and used it as a reserve side in the 2003\u201304 [[Albanian Second Division]].\n\n===Partizani B (2013\u2013present)===\nOn 15 March 2013 Partizani B defeated IDS Tirana 8\u20131 away from home in an [[Albanian Third Division]] Group B game, making it the club's biggest ever victory.<ref>[http://www.fshf.org/garat/components/match.php?match_id=147948 IDS 1\u20138 Partizani B]</ref><ref>[http://www.panorama-sport.com/kategoria-e-dyte/shperthen-partizani-b-tete-gola-amatoreve/ Shp\u00ebrthen Partizani B, tet\u00eb gola amator\u00ebve] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221213004/http://www.panorama-sport.com/kategoria-e-dyte/shperthen-partizani-b-tete-gola-amatoreve/ |date=February 21, 2014 }}</ref> However, this record was broken a couple of months later on 1 May against FK Gostima in a 13\u20132 victory again away from home.<ref>[http://www.fshf.org/garat/components/match.php?match_id=147924 Gostimar 2\u201313 Partizani B]</ref> '''FK Partizani B''' gained promotion to the [[Albanian Second Division]]\n\nDuring the 2015\u201316 campaign in the [[Albanian Second Division]] Partizani B began the season inconsistently, winning just 6 of their first 14 games before going on to win 7 of their last 8 games, ending the season on a 16 game unbeaten run which earned them a runners up sport in Group A of the Second Division and a place in the [[Albanian First Division]] playoffs.

Partizani B won the game and celebrated promotion to the First Division, but Sopoti Librazhd filed a complaint to the [[Albanian Football Association]] arguing that Patizani B had mainly used players from the [[Partizani Tirana|Partizani]] first team, including [[Labinot Ibrahimi]] and [[Ylber Ramadani]] who had featured in the first team against [[Teuta Durr\u00ebs]] the day before. The Albanian FA decided to revoke Partizani B's promotion as they awarded the game to Sopoti Librazhd 3\u20130 due to Partizani B having broken the rules by featuring Ibrahimi and Ramadani, as a player is not allowed to feature for both the first and reserve team of any club within 24 hours.<ref>[http://www.fshf.org/index.php/sq/vendimet/disiplina/5129-vendimi-i-komisionit-te-disiplines-se-fshf-date-06-07-2016 Vendimi i Komisionit te Disiplines se FSHF date 06.07.2016]</ref> However, due to stricter licensing measured enforced by the Albanian FA, First Division side [[KF Adriatiku Mamurras|Adriatiku Mamurras]] failed to meet the conditions to remain in the league and their place was given to Partizani B who were able to meet the necessary criteria, making them the only reserve team to have competed in the second tier of modern Albanian football.<ref>[http://telesport.al/partizani-b-ne-kategorine-e-pare-ja-dy-grupet-e-skuadrave/ Partizani B n\u00eb Kategorin\u00eb e Par\u00eb, ja dy grupet e skuadrave]</ref>\n\n==Current squad==\n{{updated|11 March 2019}}\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=98|pos=GK|nat=ALB|name=Livio Malaj}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=GK|nat=ALB|name=Ergys Hida}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=GK|nat=ALB|name=Holger Xhameta}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=DF|nat=ALB|name=Ilirian Dushaj}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=DF|nat=ALB|name=Kabir Tahiraga}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=DF|nat=ALB|name=Gentian Thercaj}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=MF|nat=ALB|name=Alesio Kolonja}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=MF|nat=MKD|name=Besnik Ferati}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=MF|nat=ALB|name=Mario Kacupaj}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=MF|nat=ALB|name=Maksimiliano Bajo}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=MF|nat=ALB|name=Gehard Hasa}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=MF|nat=ALB|name=Vilford Arbana}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=MF|nat=ALB|name=Enis Beqiraj}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=MF|nat=ALB|name=Klejdi Zenelak}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=MF|nat=ALB|name=Mario Farruku}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=MF|nat=ALB|name=Franci Lala}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=MF|nat=ALB|name=Armend Lataj}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=MF|nat=ALB|name=Ermir Gurra}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=FW|nat=ALB|name=Joan Cela}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=FW|nat=ALB|name=Frenkli Xhunga}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=FW|nat=ALB|name=Endi Jovani}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=FW|nat=ALB|name=Denis Balla}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014-|pos=FW|nat=ALB|name=Klejdi Daci}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n==Honours==\n*[[Albanian Third Division]]\n**2012\u201313<ref>[http://www.panorama-sport.com/kategoria-e-dyte/nje-tjeter-partizan-ne-te-dyten/ Nj\u00eb tjet\u00ebr Partizan n\u00eb t\u00eb Dyt\u00ebn] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221213120/http://www.panorama-sport.com/kategoria-e-dyte/nje-tjeter-partizan-ne-te-dyten/ |date=February 21, 2014 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.panorama-sport.com/kategoria-e-dyte/debutime-historike-dhe-ekipe-amatore-ja-te-vecantat-e-kampionatit/ Debutime historike dhe ekipe amatore, ja t\u00eb ve\u00e7antat e kampionatit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221210044/http://www.panorama-sport.com/kategoria-e-dyte/debutime-historike-dhe-ekipe-amatore-ja-te-vecantat-e-kampionatit/ |date=2014-02-21 }}</ref>\n\n==Staff==\n*'''President:''' Gazment Demi\n*'''Manager:''' Marko Pelinxhi\n*'''Assistant manager:'''Shahin Berberi\n*'''Academy director:''' Genc Tomori\n*'''Under 17s manager:''' Nikolin \u00c7o\u00e7lli\n*'''Under 12s manager:''' Evis \u00c7elmeta\n*'''Head scout:''' Ilir Bushati<ref>[http://www.panorama-sport.com/kategoria-superiore/ja-si-do-ringreme-akademine/ Ja si do ringrem\u00eb akademin\u00eb] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221213006/http://www.panorama-sport.com/kategoria-superiore/ja-si-do-ringreme-akademine/ |date=February 21, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Kategoria e dyt\u00eb}}\n{{Football in Albania}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Partizani}}\n[[Category:Football clubs in Albania]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 2013]]\n[[Category:2013 establishments in Albania]]\n[[Category:Football clubs in Tirana]]\n[[Category:FK Partizani Tirana]]\n", "name_user": "Serbianboy87", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KF_Partizani_Tirana_B"}

Plus, the show maintains a chaotic pace, and there are no real attempts to teach strong positive lessons. While Bessie's dedication to her goal could theoretically be considered admirable, the show makes light of her disregard for her adoring younger brother's feelings and her lack of real friends (in favor of an imaginary pal she draws on her finger and her reluctant dog sidekick).
