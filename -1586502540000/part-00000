Each figure is an original character with new clothing and facial designs, and most contain previously unseen accessories. Each series usually contain 16 different minifigures, however some series contain as few as 9 minifigures, while others contain up to 22.\n\n==Details==\nThe series consists of a number of individually themed collectible Lego minifigures based on movies, sports, history, and popular culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shop.lego.com/Product/?p=8683|title=LEGO Minifigures|publisher=[[Lego shop]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729192722/http://shop.lego.com/Product/?p=8683|archivedate=29 July 2010}}</ref> The figures are sold individually in sealed, unmarked packets, giving customers a random chance at obtaining any particular figurine. While considered a novel approach by some, it has raised controversy amongst enthusiasts and collectors, increasing the amount of difficulty in obtaining a complete collection{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. Purchases from many retailers make no guarantees regarding the contents of a particular packet. Despite attempts to obfuscate the contents of these packets, the bags of Series 1 and 2 have a second figurine-specific bar code on the rear of the packet, next to the EAN/UPC product bar code (which is unique to each series). This has allowed customers to identify individual figures within the packet, significantly decreasing the amount of money and effort required to obtain a complete collection, and eliminates the possibility of unintentionally receiving duplicates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bricks.inof.de/docs/minifig-barcodes/index-en.html|title=Barcodes of the Collectible Minifigures|publisher=bricks.inof.de}}</ref> There are also apps for both [[iPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices that utilize these bar codes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.betterthantomorrow.com/minicollector|title=Mini Collector|date=30 August 2010|access-date=17 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003125137/http://blog.betterthantomorrow.com/minicollector/|archive-date=3 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nLego has eliminated the figurine-specific bar codes on all Series 3 and 4 packets and replaced them with a braille-like system of dots embossed in the lower seal of the bag.

The game uses traditional click-to-move mechanics, allowing younger users to jump into the action. However, for advanced users, there are special abilities activated using the number pad. It is going to be free-to-play, but you can unlock Minifigures by purchasing one and entering a code, however they can also be obtained in-game. It was released in late 2014 for [[iPad|iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[Personal computer|PC]] as either a download client or in-[[Web browser|browser]] on the LEGO website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.funcom.com/scene/lego/1|title=funcom.com \u2013 LEGO Minifigures Online|publisher=funcom.com|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nFuncom announced that LEGO Minifigures Online will be closing on 30 September 2016. Starting 6 June 2016, new players will be unable to join the game and the in-game chat will be disabled.

While considered a novel approach by some, it has raised controversy amongst enthusiasts and collectors, increasing the amount of difficulty in obtaining a complete collection{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. Purchases from many retailers make no guarantees regarding the contents of a particular packet. Despite attempts to obfuscate the contents of these packets, the bags of Series 1 and 2 have a second figurine-specific bar code on the rear of the packet, next to the EAN/UPC product bar code (which is unique to each series). This has allowed customers to identify individual figures within the packet, significantly decreasing the amount of money and effort required to obtain a complete collection, and eliminates the possibility of unintentionally receiving duplicates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bricks.inof.de/docs/minifig-barcodes/index-en.html|title=Barcodes of the Collectible Minifigures|publisher=bricks.inof.de}}</ref> There are also apps for both [[iPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices that utilize these bar codes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.betterthantomorrow.com/minicollector|title=Mini Collector|date=30 August 2010|access-date=17 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003125137/http://blog.betterthantomorrow.com/minicollector/|archive-date=3 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nLego has eliminated the figurine-specific bar codes on all Series 3 and 4 packets and replaced them with a braille-like system of dots embossed in the lower seal of the bag.

The game uses traditional click-to-move mechanics, allowing younger users to jump into the action. However, for advanced users, there are special abilities activated using the number pad. It is going to be free-to-play, but you can unlock Minifigures by purchasing one and entering a code, however they can also be obtained in-game. It was released in late 2014 for [[iPad|iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[Personal computer|PC]] as either a download client or in-[[Web browser|browser]] on the LEGO website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.funcom.com/scene/lego/1|title=funcom.com \u2013 LEGO Minifigures Online|publisher=funcom.com|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nFuncom announced that LEGO Minifigures Online will be closing on 30 September 2016.

The capital is [[Bangalore]] and is the largest city.\n\nKarnataka is bordered by the [[Arabian Sea]] to the west, [[Goa]] to the northwest, [[Maharashtra]] to the north, [[Telangana]] to the northeast, [[Andhra Pradesh]] to the east, [[Tamil Nadu]] to the southeast, and [[Kerala]] to the south. The state covers an area of {{convert|191976|km2|mi2}}, or 5.83 percent of the total geographical area of India. It is the [[List of states of India by area|sixth largest Indian state by area]].

Most of these rivers flow out of Karnataka eastward, reaching the sea at the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Other prominent rivers such as the [[Sharavati]] in [[Shimoga]] and [[Netravati River|Netravati]] in [[Dakshina Kannada]] flow westward, reaching the sea at the Arabian Sea.\n\nThough [[Origin of Karnataka's name|several etymologies]] have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that ''Karnataka'' is derived from the Kannada words ''karu'' and ''n\u0101du'', meaning \"elevated land\". ''Karu Nadu'' may also be read as ''karu'', meaning \"black\" and ''nadu'', meaning \"region\", as a reference to the [[Vertisol|black cotton soil]] found in the [[Bayalu Seeme]] region of the state. The [[British Raj|British]] used the word [[Carnatic region|Carnatic]], sometimes ''Karnatak'', to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the Krishna.<ref>See [[Lord Macaulay]]'s life of Clive and James Talboys Wheeler: ''Early History of British India'', London (1878) p.98.

The decline of Satavahana power led to the rise of the earliest native kingdoms, the [[Kadambas]] and the [[Western Gangas]], marking the region's emergence as an independent political entity.

[[Madhvacharya]] (1238\u20131317) was the chief proponent of [[Dvaita Vedanta|Tattvavada]] (Philosophy of Reality), popularly known as [[Dvaita]] or Dualistic school of Hindu philosophy&nbsp;\u2014 one of the three most influential [[Vedanta]] philosophies. Madhvacharya was one of the important philosophers during the [[Bhakti movement]]. He was a pioneer in many ways, going against standard conventions and norms. According to tradition, Madhvacharya is believed to be the third incarnation of [[Vayu]] (Mukhyaprana), after [[Hanuman]] and [[Bhima]]. The [[Haridasa]] devotional movement is considered as one of the turning points in the cultural history of India. Over a span of nearly six centuries, several saints and mystics helped shape the culture, philosophy, and art of South India and Karnataka in particular by exerting considerable spiritual influence over the masses and kingdoms that ruled South India.\n\nThis movement was ushered in by the Haridasas (literally \"servants of Lord Hari\") and took shape in the 13th century \u2013 14th century CE, period, prior to and during the early rule of the Vijayanagara empire. The main objective of this movement was to propagate the Dvaita philosophy of Madhvacharya (Madhva Siddhanta) to the masses through a literary medium known as [[Dasa Sahitya]] literature of the servants of the Lord. [[Purandara Dasa|Purandaradasa]] is widely recognised as the ''\"Pithamaha\"'' of [[Carnatic Music|Carnatic music]] for his immense contribution. [[Ramanujacharya]], the leading expounder of ''[[Vishishtadvaita]]'', spent many years in [[Melkote]]. He came to Karnataka in 1098 AD and lived here until 1122 AD. He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melkote where the [[Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple]] and a well-organised ''matha'' were built. He was patronised by the Hoysala king, [[Vishnuvardhana]].<ref name=\"Kamath\">Kamath (2001), pp. 150\u2013152</ref>\n\nIn the twelfth century, [[Lingayatism]] emerged in northern Karnataka as a protest against the rigidity of the prevailing social and caste system. Leading figures of this movement were [[Basava]], [[Akka Mahadevi]] and [[Allama Prabhu]], who established the [[Anubhava Mantapa]] which was the centre of all religious and philosophical thoughts and discussions pertaining to Lingayats. These three social reformers did so by the literary means of ''\"Vachana Sahitya\"'' which is very famous for its simple, straight forward and easily understandable Kannada language. Lingayatism preached women equality by letting women wear ''Ishtalinga'' i.e. Symbol of god around their neck. [[Basava]] shunned the sharp hierarchical divisions that existed and sought to remove all distinctions between the hierarchically superior master class and the subordinate, servile class. He also supported inter-caste marriages and Kaayaka Tatva of Basavanna. This was the basis of the [[Lingayat]] faith which today counts millions among its followers.<ref name=\"basava\">Kamath (2001), pp. 152\u2013154.</ref>\n\nThe [[Jain]] philosophy and literature have contributed immensely to the religious and cultural landscape of Karnataka. [[Islam]], which had an early presence on the west coast of India as early as the tenth century, gained a foothold in Karnataka with the rise of the Bahamani and Bijapur sultanates that ruled parts of Karnataka.<ref name=\"bam\">Sastri (1955), p. 396.</ref> [[Christianity]] reached Karnataka in the sixteenth century with the arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[St. Francis Xavier]] in 1545.<ref name=\"chris\">Sastri (1955), p. 398.</ref>\n\n[[Buddhism]] was popular in Karnataka during the first millennium in places such as [[Gulbarga]] and [[Banavasi]]. A chance discovery of edicts and several [[Maurya]]n relics at [[Sannati]] in [[Gulbarga district]] in 1986 has proven that the [[Krishna River]] basin was once home to both [[Mahayana]] and [[Hinayana]] Buddhism.

It was [[Unification of Karnataka|formed]] on 1 November 1956, with the passage of the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|States Reorganisation Act]]. Originally known as the [[Mysore State|State of Mysore]], it was renamed ''Karnataka'' in 1973. The state corresponds to the [[Carnatic region]]. The capital is [[Bangalore]] and is the largest city.\n\nKarnataka is bordered by the [[Arabian Sea]] to the west, [[Goa]] to the northwest, [[Maharashtra]] to the north, [[Telangana]] to the northeast, [[Andhra Pradesh]] to the east, [[Tamil Nadu]] to the southeast, and [[Kerala]] to the south. The state covers an area of {{convert|191976|km2|mi2}}, or 5.83 percent of the total geographical area of India. It is the [[List of states of India by area|sixth largest Indian state by area]]. With 61,130,704 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Karnataka is the [[List of states of India by population|eighth largest state by population]], comprising 30 [[List of districts in India|districts]]. [[Kannada]], one of the [[classical language]]s of India, is the most widely spoken and official language of the state. Other languages spoken include [[Urdu]], [[Konkani]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Tulu language|Tulu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam]], [[Kodava language|Kodava]] and [[Beary]].

Most of these rivers flow out of Karnataka eastward, reaching the sea at the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Other prominent rivers such as the [[Sharavati]] in [[Shimoga]] and [[Netravati River|Netravati]] in [[Dakshina Kannada]] flow westward, reaching the sea at the Arabian Sea.\n\nThough [[Origin of Karnataka's name|several etymologies]] have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that ''Karnataka'' is derived from the Kannada words ''karu'' and ''n\u0101du'', meaning \"elevated land\". ''Karu Nadu'' may also be read as ''karu'', meaning \"black\" and ''nadu'', meaning \"region\", as a reference to the [[Vertisol|black cotton soil]] found in the [[Bayalu Seeme]] region of the state. The [[British Raj|British]] used the word [[Carnatic region|Carnatic]], sometimes ''Karnatak'', to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the Krishna.<ref>See [[Lord Macaulay]]'s life of Clive and James Talboys Wheeler: ''Early History of British India'', London (1878) p.98. The principal meaning is the western half of this area, but the rulers there controlled the [[Coromandel Coast]] as well.</ref>\n\nWith an antiquity that dates to the [[paleolithic]], Karnataka has been home to some of the most powerful [[Political history of medieval Karnataka|empires of ancient and medieval India]]. The philosophers and musical bards patronised by these empires launched socio-religious and literary movements which have endured to the present day.

[[Madhvacharya]] (1238\u20131317) was the chief proponent of [[Dvaita Vedanta|Tattvavada]] (Philosophy of Reality), popularly known as [[Dvaita]] or Dualistic school of Hindu philosophy&nbsp;\u2014 one of the three most influential [[Vedanta]] philosophies. Madhvacharya was one of the important philosophers during the [[Bhakti movement]]. He was a pioneer in many ways, going against standard conventions and norms. According to tradition, Madhvacharya is believed to be the third incarnation of [[Vayu]] (Mukhyaprana), after [[Hanuman]] and [[Bhima]]. The [[Haridasa]] devotional movement is considered as one of the turning points in the cultural history of India. Over a span of nearly six centuries, several saints and mystics helped shape the culture, philosophy, and art of South India and Karnataka in particular by exerting considerable spiritual influence over the masses and kingdoms that ruled South India.\n\nThis movement was ushered in by the Haridasas (literally \"servants of Lord Hari\") and took shape in the 13th century \u2013 14th century CE, period, prior to and during the early rule of the Vijayanagara empire. The main objective of this movement was to propagate the Dvaita philosophy of Madhvacharya (Madhva Siddhanta) to the masses through a literary medium known as [[Dasa Sahitya]] literature of the servants of the Lord. [[Purandara Dasa|Purandaradasa]] is widely recognised as the ''\"Pithamaha\"'' of [[Carnatic Music|Carnatic music]] for his immense contribution. [[Ramanujacharya]], the leading expounder of ''[[Vishishtadvaita]]'', spent many years in [[Melkote]]. He came to Karnataka in 1098 AD and lived here until 1122 AD. He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melkote where the [[Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple]] and a well-organised ''matha'' were built. He was patronised by the Hoysala king, [[Vishnuvardhana]].<ref name=\"Kamath\">Kamath (2001), pp. 150\u2013152</ref>\n\nIn the twelfth century, [[Lingayatism]] emerged in northern Karnataka as a protest against the rigidity of the prevailing social and caste system. Leading figures of this movement were [[Basava]], [[Akka Mahadevi]] and [[Allama Prabhu]], who established the [[Anubhava Mantapa]] which was the centre of all religious and philosophical thoughts and discussions pertaining to Lingayats. These three social reformers did so by the literary means of ''\"Vachana Sahitya\"'' which is very famous for its simple, straight forward and easily understandable Kannada language. Lingayatism preached women equality by letting women wear ''Ishtalinga'' i.e. Symbol of god around their neck. [[Basava]] shunned the sharp hierarchical divisions that existed and sought to remove all distinctions between the hierarchically superior master class and the subordinate, servile class. He also supported inter-caste marriages and Kaayaka Tatva of Basavanna. This was the basis of the [[Lingayat]] faith which today counts millions among its followers.<ref name=\"basava\">Kamath (2001), pp. 152\u2013154.</ref>\n\nThe [[Jain]] philosophy and literature have contributed immensely to the religious and cultural landscape of Karnataka. [[Islam]], which had an early presence on the west coast of India as early as the tenth century, gained a foothold in Karnataka with the rise of the Bahamani and Bijapur sultanates that ruled parts of Karnataka.<ref name=\"bam\">Sastri (1955), p. 396.</ref> [[Christianity]] reached Karnataka in the sixteenth century with the arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[St. Francis Xavier]] in 1545.<ref name=\"chris\">Sastri (1955), p. 398.</ref>\n\n[[Buddhism]] was popular in Karnataka during the first millennium in places such as [[Gulbarga]] and [[Banavasi]].

It is named as one of the official languages of the [[Union of the Comoros]] in the Comorian constitution.

Like [[Swahili language|Swahili]], the Comorian languages are [[Sabaki languages]], part of the Bantu language family. Each island has its own language and the four are conventionally divided into two groups: the eastern group is composed of ''Shindzuani'' (spoken on [[Anjouan|Ndzuani]]) and ''[[Shimaore dialect|Shimaore]]'' (Mayotte), while the western group is composed of ''Shimwali'' ([[Moh\u00e9li|Mwali]]) and ''Shingazija'' ([[Grande Comore|Ngazidja]]). Although the languages of different groups are not usually mutually intelligible, only sharing about 80% of their lexicon, there is [[mutually intelligible|mutual intelligibility]] between the languages within each group, suggesting that Shikomori should be considered as a two language groups rather than four distinct languages.<ref>Breslar, 1981; Ahmed-Chamanga, 2010</ref>\n\nHistorically, the language was written in the [[Ajami script]].

It is named as one of the official languages of the [[Union of the Comoros]] in the Comorian constitution. Shimaore, one of the languages, is spoken on the disputed island of [[Mayotte]], a [[departement of France|French department]] claimed by Comoros. Like [[Swahili language|Swahili]], the Comorian languages are [[Sabaki languages]], part of the Bantu language family. Each island has its own language and the four are conventionally divided into two groups: the eastern group is composed of ''Shindzuani'' (spoken on [[Anjouan|Ndzuani]]) and ''[[Shimaore dialect|Shimaore]]'' (Mayotte), while the western group is composed of ''Shimwali'' ([[Moh\u00e9li|Mwali]]) and ''Shingazija'' ([[Grande Comore|Ngazidja]]). Although the languages of different groups are not usually mutually intelligible, only sharing about 80% of their lexicon, there is [[mutually intelligible|mutual intelligibility]] between the languages within each group, suggesting that Shikomori should be considered as a two language groups rather than four distinct languages.<ref>Breslar, 1981; Ahmed-Chamanga, 2010</ref>\n\nHistorically, the language was written in the [[Ajami script]]. The [[French Comoros|French colonial administration]] introduced the [[Latin script]], of which a modified version was officially decreed in 2009.<ref>Ahmed-Chamanga, 2010</ref> Many Comorians now use the Latin script when writing the Comorian language although the [[Ajami script]] is still widely used, especially by women. \n\nIt is the language of ''Umodja wa Masiwa,'' the national anthem.\n\n==Phonology==\nThe consonants and vowels in the Comorian languages: \n=== Vowels ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!\n![[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n![[Close vowel|Close]]\n|{{IPA|i \u0129}}\n|{{IPA|u \u0169}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n![[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n|{{IPA|e}}\n|{{IPA|o}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n![[Open vowel|Open]]\n| colspan=\"2\" | {{IPA|a \u00e3}}\n|}\n\n=== Consonants ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n![[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n![[Labiodental consonant|Labio-<br>dental]]\n![[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n![[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n![[Palato-alveolar consonant|Palato-<br>alveolar]]\n![[Retroflex consonant|Retroflex]]\n![[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n![[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n![[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" |[[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n!<small>[[Voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n|{{IPA|p}}\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|t}}\n|\n|{{IPA|\u0288}}\n|\n|{{IPA|k}}\n|\n|-\n!<small>[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n|({{IPA|b}})\n|\n|\n|({{IPA|d}})\n|\n|{{IPA|\u0256}}\n|\n|{{IPA|\u0261}}\n|\n|-\n!<small>[[Implosive consonant|implosive]]</small>\n|{{IPA|\u0253}}\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|\u0257}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!<small>[[Voicelessness|vl.]] [[Prenasalized consonant|prenasal]]</small>\n|{{IPA|\u1d50p}}\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|\u207ft}}\n|\n|{{IPA|\u1daf\u0288}}\n|\n|{{IPA|\u1d51k}}\n|\n|-\n!<small>[[Voice (phonetics)|vd.]] [[Prenasalized consonant|prenasal]]</small>\n|({{IPA|\u1d50b}})\n|\n|\n|({{IPA|\u207fd}})\n|\n|{{IPA|\u1daf\u0256}}\n|\n|{{IPA|\u1d51\u0261}}\n|\n|-\n!<small>[[Implosive consonant|impl.]] [[Prenasalized consonant|prenasal]]</small>\n|{{IPA|\u1d50\u0253}}\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|\u207f\u0257}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" |[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n!<small>[[Voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n|\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|t\u0361s}}\n|{{IPA|t\u0361\u0283}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!<small>[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n|\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|d\u0361z}}\n|{{IPA|d\u0361\u0292}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!<small>[[Voicelessness|vl.]] [[Prenasalized consonant|prenasal]]</small>\n|\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|\u207ft\u0361s}}\n|{{IPA|\u207ft\u0361\u0283}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!<small>[[Voice (phonetics)|vd.]] [[Prenasalized consonant|prenasal]]</small>\n|\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|\u207fd\u0361z}}\n|{{IPA|\u207fd\u0361\u0292}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n!<small>[[Voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n|\n|{{IPA|f}}\n|{{IPA|\u03b8}}\n|{{IPA|s}}\n|{{IPA|\u0283}}\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|x}}\n|{{IPA|h}}\n|-\n!<small>[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n|{{IPA|\u03b2}}\n|{{IPA|v}}\n|{{IPA|\u00f0}}\n|{{IPA|z}}\n|{{IPA|\u0292}}\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|\u0263}}\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n|{{IPA|m}}\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|n}}\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|\u0272}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|{{IPA|w}}\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|l}}\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|j}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n|\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|r}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nThe consonants ''mb'', ''nd'', ''b'', ''d'' are phonetically recognized as ranging from {{IPA|[\u1d50\u0253~\u1d50b]}}, {{IPA|[\u207f\u0257~\u207fd]}}, {{IPA|[\u0253~b]}}, {{IPA|[\u0257~d]}}.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Ahmed-Chamanga, Mohamed.

It is the primary engineering innovation and the characteristic design component. The use of the pointed arch in turn led to the development of the pointed [[ribbed vault]], the [[flying buttress]] and window tracery.<ref>Bannister Fletcher, 17th edition, p.367, p.524</ref> These elements together formed a structurally and aesthetically integrated system, or style, that characterises the Gothic.<ref>Moffett, Fazio and Wodehouse, p.230</ref>\n\nAt the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], near Paris, the choir was reconstructed between 1140 and 1144, drawing together for the first time the developing Gothic architectural features. In doing so, a new architectural style emerged that internally emphasised verticality in the structural members, and the effect created by the transmission of light through [[stained glass window]]s.{{sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nGothic architecture is most common as [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Church architecture|ecclesiastical architecture]], characterising many mediaeval [[cathedral]]s, [[abbey]]s, and [[Parish church|parish churches]] of Europe. It is also the architecture of many [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[town hall]]s, [[guildhall]]<nowiki/>s, universities and less prominently, private dwellings. Many of the finest examples of mediaeval Gothic architecture are listed with [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Site]]s.\n\nWith the development of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Italy during the mid 15th century, the Gothic style was supplanted by the new style, but in some regions, notably England, Gothic continued to flourish and develop into the 16th century. A series of [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revivals]] began in mid-18th century England, spread through 19th century Europe and continued, largely for ecclesiastical and university structures, into the 20th century.\n\n==Name== \nGothic architecture is also known as pointed architecture or ogival architecture.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Citation|last=|first=|title=ogive|date=2015|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199674985.001.0001/acref-9780199674985-e-3177|work=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|volume=|pages=|editor-last=Curl|editor-first=James Stevens|edition=3rd|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199674985.001.0001/acref-9780199674985-e-3177|isbn=978-0-19-967498-5|access-date=2020-04-09|editor2-last=Wilson|editor2-first=Susan}}</ref> Mediaeval contemporaries described the style as {{Lang-la|opus Francigenum|lit=French work' or '[[Frankish]] work}}, as {{Lang-la|opus modernum|lit=modern work|label=none}}, {{Lang-la|novum opus|lit=new work|label=none}}, or as {{Lang-it|maniera tedesca|lit=German style}}.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bogdanovi\u0107|first=Jelena|title=opus Francigenum|date=2010-01-01|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198662624.001.0001/acref-9780198662624-e-4321|work=The Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages|volume=|pages=|editor-last=Bjork|editor-first=Robert E.|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198662624.001.0001/acref-9780198662624-e-4321|isbn=978-0-19-866262-4|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>Bannister Fletcher, p.524</ref>\n\nThe term \"[[Gothic (disambiguation)|Gothic]] architecture\" originated as a [[pejorative]] description.

But, without citing many authorities, such as [[Christopher Wren]], and others, who lent their aid in depreciating the old mediaeval style, which they termed Gothic, as synonymous with every thing that was barbarous and rude, it may be sufficient to refer to the celebrated Treatise of Sir [[Henry Wotton]], entitled ''The Elements of Architecture'', ... printed in London so early as 1624. ... But it was a strange misapplication of the term to use it for the pointed style, in contradistinction to the circular, formerly called Saxon, now Norman, Romanesque, &c. These latter styles, like [[Lombard architecture|Lombardic]], Italian, and the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]], of course belong more to the Gothic period than the light and elegant structures of the pointed order which succeeded them.<ref name=\"Ref_b\">''[[Notes and Queries]]'', No. 9. 29 December 1849</ref></blockquote>\n\n== History ==\nArchitecture \"became a leading form of artistic expression during the late Middle Ages\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Gothic architecture began in the earlier 12th century in northwest France and England and spread throughout Latin Europe in the 13th century; by 1300, a first \"international style\" of Gothic had developed, with common design features and formal language.

By the early 12th century the ribbed vaults, characteristic of Gothic architecture, were coming into use.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} They appeared at the naves of two Romanesque churches in Caen, France, the [[Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen|Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne]] and the [[Abbaye aux Dames]] in 1120.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The ribbed vault over the north transept at [[Durham Cathedral]] in England, built from 1128 to 1133, was the first time pointed arches were used in a high vault. Pointed ribbed vaults were used in the chancel of [[Cathedral of Cefal\u00f9]] in 1131.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe three-tiered interior elevation of arcade, gallery and clerestory that is typical of great Gothic churches, was well established in the Norman buildings of England, appearing at [[norwich Cathedral|Norwich]], [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough]] and Durham Cathedrals as well as the Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen, in France.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nOne of the features that unifies the internal appearance of a great Gothic church is the emphasis on vertical elements, in particular attached shafts that pass from the floor to the vault.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} These first appeared in France in the early 11th century in churches that have broad ribs reinforcing a barrel vault. They are also seen at [[Lisbon Cathedral|Lisbon]] and [[Speyer Cathedral]]s, [[Santiago de Compostela]] and [[V\u00e9zelay Abbey|la Madeleine Vezelay]] in conjunction with groin vaults, as well as at the three Norman cathedrals of East Anglia, of which Peterborough and Ely retain wooden ceilings, while Norwich was not vaulted until the 15th century.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe admission of light to the building through a multiplicity of windows was an important element in England. At Peterborough Cathedral, the polygonal Norman apse has remained, as has three tiers of large Norman windows, now filled with Gothic tracery and 19th century stained glass.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The transept ends at Peterborough, Ely and Norwich each have three rows of large Norman windows. This grouping of windows prefigures the clusters of Gothic lancet windows that are found in many English churches such [[Salisbury Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Rose window]]s, characteristic of the west fronts and transept ends of the cathedrals of France, were common in architecture of Germany in the Romanesque period, where they appear in various forms at [[Worms Cathedral]], and in Italy where they are either untraceried [[Oculus|oculi]] or wheel windows such as that at the [[Basilica of San Zeno]], Verona.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The first rose window above the west portal in France is said{{By whom|date=April 2020}} to be that at the [[Basilica of Saint Denis|Abbaye Saint-Denis]] 1140. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] is generally cited as the first truly Gothic building, however the distinction is best reserved for the choir, of which the [[ambulatory]] remains intact.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} [[Noyon Cathedral]] saw the earliest completion of a rebuilding of an entire French cathedral in the new style from 1150 to 1231.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} While using all those features that came to be known as Gothic, including pointed arches, flying buttresses and ribbed vaulting, the builders continued to employ many of the features and much of the character of Romanesque architecture including round-headed arch throughout the building, varying the shape to pointed where it was functionally practical to do so.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAt the Abbey Saint-Denis, [[Sens Cathedral]], Noyon Cathedral, [[Notre Dame de Paris]] and at the eastern end of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in England, simple cylindrical columns predominate over the Gothic forms of clustered columns and shafted piers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Wells Cathedral]] in England, commenced at the eastern end in 1175, was the first building in which the designer broke free from Romanesque forms. The architect entirely dispensed with the round arch in favour of the pointed arch and with cylindrical columns in favour of piers composed of clusters of shafts which lead into the mouldings of the arches. The transepts and nave were continued by Adam Locke in the same style and completed in about 1230. The character of the building is entirely Gothic. Wells Cathedral is thus considered the first truly Gothic cathedral.<ref>Cannon, J. 2007.

Their builders abandoned the traditional plans and introduced the new Gothic elements.  The builders of Notre Dame went further by introducing the flying buttress, heavy columns of support outside the walls connected by arches to the walls, which received and counterbalanced the thrust from the rib vaults of the roof.

The choir and west front of the Abbey of Saint-Denis both became the prototypes for further building in the royal domain of northern France and in the Duchy of Normandy.

In other words, when the arch is drafted, the [[radius]] is exactly the width of the opening and the centre of each arch coincides with the point from which the opposite arch springs. <small>(See diagram)</small> This makes the arch higher in relation to its width than a semi-circular arch which is exactly half as high as it is wide.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} The equilateral arch gives a wide opening of satisfying proportion useful for doorways, decorative arcades and large windows.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe structural beauty of the Gothic arch means that no set proportion had to be rigidly maintained.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The equilateral arch was employed as a useful tool, not as a principle of design.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This meant that narrower or wider arches were introduced into a building plan wherever necessity dictated.

The other structural advantage is that the pointed arch channels the weight onto the bearing piers or columns at a steep angle. This enabled architects to raise vaults much higher than was possible in Romanesque architecture.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn Romanesque architecture, the rounded arches of the [[barrel vault]]s that covered the nave pressed directly down on the walls with crushing weight. This required massive columns, thick walls and small windows, and naturally limited the height of the building. Gothic architects found a solution through an innovative use of the rib vault.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}\n\nAn early kind of rib vault, used at [[Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba]] (8th century), was found under a [[cupola]] or [[dome]], but was different in form and function from the later Gothic rib vault. The cupola itself was supported by [[pendentive]]s or [[squinch]]es, a practice used in [[Byzantine architecture]]. The ribs were decorative. The vaults in churches in [[Sicily]] dated to the 11th century, after Sicily had been conquered by the Normans, and resembled the vaults used at the same time in Normandy and England.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=188\u2013190}}\n\nGothic builders designed a new and lighter kind of rib vault. They divided into compartments by a diagonal crossing of thin stone ribs (''ogives''), and completed by two additional arcs perpendicular and parallel to the nave (''doubleaux'' and ''formerets''). They also made innovative use of the broken arch or pointed arch. In Islamic and Romanesque architecture, pointed arches had usually been used in doorways and windows. Gothic architects used them at the meeting points of the ribs at the top of the vaults, which distributed the weight of the roof downwards and outwards, not just downwards.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}} These ribs divided the early vaults into six compartments, each as wide as two traverses of the nave. Some of the ribs went downwards as [[colonette]]s and were bundled into pillars on the ground floor. Other ribs carried the thrust outwards to the walls, where it was counterbalanced by heavy flying buttresses outside the walls. Since the weight was supported by pillars and buttresses, the walls themselves could be much higher and thinner. This made possible the expanses of [[stained glass]] that were a characteristic of Gothic cathedrals.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}}\n\nThe earlier Gothic rib vaults, used at Notre-Dame, Noyon, and Laon, were divided by the ribs into six compartments, were very difficult to build, and could only cross a limited space. In later cathedral construction, the design was simplified, and the rib vaults had only four compartments, and could cover a wider span; a single vault could cross the nave, and fewer pillars were needed. The four-part vaults also made it possible to build the cathedrals even higher. [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], begun in 1163 with four-part vaults, reached a height of 35 meters, remarkable for the time. [[Amiens Cathedral]], begun in 1220 with four-part ribs, reached the height of 42.30 meters (138.8 feet) at the transept.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=18-28}}\n\n===Buttresses=== \n[[File:Strebewerk-2.jpg|thumb|Section of Reims Cathedral with flying buttress over aisles.]] \nAnother important feature of Gothic architecture was the [[flying buttress]], designed to support the walls by means of arches connected to counter-supports outside the walls. Flying buttresses had existed in simple forms since Roman times, but the Gothic builders raised their use to a fine art, balancing the thrust from the roof inside against the counter-thrust of the buttresses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The earliest Gothic churches, including Saint-Denis and Notre-Dame in its beginning stages, did not have flying buttresses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Their walls were supported by heavy stone [[abutment]]s placed directly against the walls.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The roof was supported by the ribs of the vaults, which were bundled with the columns below.\n\nIn the later 12th and early 13th century, the buttresses became more sophisticated. New arches carried the thrust of the weight entirely outside the walls, where it was met by the counter-thrust of stone columns, with pinnacles placed on top for decoration and for additional weight. Thanks to this system of external buttresses, the walls could be higher and thinner, and could support larger stained glass windows. The buttresses themselves became part of the decoration; the pinnacles became more and more ornate, becoming more and more elaborate, as at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]]. The arches had an additional practical purpose; they contained lead channels which carried rainwater off the roof; it was expelled from the mouths of stone [[gargoyles]] placed in rows on the buttresses.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=50\u201351}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Buttresses\n | image1    = \n | width1    = 160\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = \n | image2    =Lincoln, UK - panoramio (30).jpg\n | width2    = 247\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =  East end of Lincoln Cathedral, with wall buttress, and chapter house with flying buttresses. \n | image3    = Canterbury Cathedral 04.JPG\n | width3    = 245\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Wall buttresses and simple flying buttresses behind a parapet at Canterbury Cathedral\n | image4    = Amiens Cath\u00e9drale Notre-dame arc-boutant sud-est 4.jpg\n | width4    = 247\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The complex buttresses of Amiens Cathedral support one of the highest Gothic vaults \n | image5    = Arri\u00e8re de la cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris en mars 2014.jpg\n | width5    = 274\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  =  The east end of Notre Dame de Paris with flying buttresses supporting the high vault\n }}\n\n==Plan, elevation and parts of a Gothic Cathedral==\n\n===Plan===\n[[File:Cathedral schematic plan en vectorial.svg|thumb|350px|Plan of a Gothic Cathedral]]\nMost large Gothic churches and many smaller parish churches are of the [[Latin cross]] (or \"cruciform\") plan, with a long nave making the body of the church, a transverse arm called the [[transept]] and, beyond it, an extension which may be called the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]], chancel or presbytery. There are several regional variations on this plan. The area where the nave and transept meet is called the crossing, and in England is often surmounted by a stone tower, as at [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and [[York Minster]], visible on a ground-plan by the sturdy piers that support the tower.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} (see below)\n\nThe nave is generally flanked on either side by aisles, usually single as at York Minster and [[Florence Cathedral]] but sometimes double as at [[bourges Cathedral|Bourges]] and [[Cologne Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} (see plans below).

This term, used architecturally, does not have any ecclesiastical or spiritual significance such as is associated with Catholic basilicas that have been designated by the pope as a church of great significance, e.g. the [[Basilica of St Peter]], in Rome, or the [[Rosary Basilica|Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary]] at Lourdes. (see [[Papal Basilica]] and [[Minor Basilica]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nArchitecturally, a basilica is a church that has a longitudinal nave, with a lower aisle on each side, separated by rows of columns or piers, and generally with windows let into that part of the nave that rises above the outer roof of the aisles. This upper section is called the [[clerestory]]. This architectural form is so named because it was commonly used by ancient Roman builders as the structure for secular [[Basilica|basilicas]] used as halls for meetings, markets and as places of justice. Early Christian churches such as [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], Rome, and [[San Apollinare in Classe]] have this form, which was adopted by Romanesque builders for their great abbeys and cathedrals, across Europe, such as Durham Cathedral, Saint-Etienne, Caen, and Monreale Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nDuring the Gothic period, most cathedrals were built with a single aisle on each side of the nave, such as Salisbury Cathedral, but some had double aisles with the outer lower than the inner, such as Bourges Cathedral. In the South of France cathedrals are sometimes just a single high, wide hall, with tall windows but no aisles, and the lower stage giving a robust fortified appearance, such as [[Albi Cathedral]]. Gothic churches of the Germanic tradition, like [[Stephansdom (Vienna)|St. Stephen of Vienna]], often have nave and aisles of similar height, without clerestory, and are called ''[[Hall church|Hallenkirche]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nInternally, the nave and choir are usually divided horizontally into three stages, the arcade, the triforium gallery and the clerestorey.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This arrangement is usual in England where it can be seen at Salisbury, Lincoln, and Ely.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn some French Cathedrals, such as Laon and the nave of Rouen, there is a fourth stage, a shallow tribune gallery between the triforium and the clerestory.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In the transepts of Notre Dame, the wall above the triforium gallery is pierced with rose windows. In later Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches, the vertical members in the tracery of galleries and clerestory may merge into a single decorative unit where the stages are present but not clearly defined, as at Saint Ouen at Rouen and the choir of Gloucester Cathedral in England. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn the Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches of Italy, triforium galleries are most often found in churches influenced by the architecture of Normandy, and were used at abbeys of women, as a space for the nuns to attend services.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Elsewhere, many churches such as Florence Cathedral and the Abbey Church of Santa Maria Novella, had an interior elevation of two stages, the arcade and clerestory. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = French Gothic elevations\n | image1    = Notre Dame 531 transverse crop rot.jpg\n | width1    = 200\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Notre Dame de Paris, showing the nave and double aisles; vault and flying buttresses.\n | image2    =Vue.interieure.travee.cathedrale.Paris.png\n | width2    = 183\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Notre Dame de Paris.

One of the best known and most typical of such west fronts is that of Notre Dame de Paris.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} To emphasise its importance, the west front may be of a powerful design, with towers, imposing portals, jutting buttresses, gables, windows and an array of sculpture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nCentral to the west front is the main portal, often flanked by additional doors, after the manner of Suger's west front at the Basilica of Saint Denis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} In England, the lateral doors may be present but relatively insignificant. In the arch of the central door, particularly in France, the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], is often a significant piece of sculpture, most frequently ''Christ in Majesty'' or ''the [[Last Judgment]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} If there is a central doorjamb or a [[Trumeau (architecture)|trumeau]], then it frequently bears a statue of Jesus or the ''Madonna and Child'' if the dedication is to Mary.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Figures in niches set into the mouldings around the portals.  \n\nAbove the main portal there is a large window which lights the nave.

[[Chartres Cathedral]] has two on the western towers, of different dates and very different construction.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} That on the south is the tallest masonry spire of the 12th century, while that on the north is a highly elaborate Flamboyant design.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The irregularity seen at Chartres also occurs at Rouen where there is a central tower in addition to the western towers. This tower displays another distinctly French feature, a delicate openwork [[fl\u00e8che]] made of wood covered with lead.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nOpenwork spires of stone, sometimes of great height, were popular in the Flamboyant period, occurring singly at [[Strasbourg Cathedral]], Burgos Cathedral, Freiburg Cathedral, [[Stefansdom]], Vienna; and also at Cologne Cathedral and Ulm Minster, both designed in the mediaeval period but not realised until the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn England, during the Gothic era, there was a continuing fashion for three towers, with the largest being that over the crossing. This arrangement is seen at Canterbury, Wells, Lincoln, York, Lichfield. and Durham Cathedrals.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England, wherever the ground was considered stable, the central tower was surmounted by a spire. Like the south spire of Chartres Cathedral, English spires are often constructed of masonry. The earliest is the comparatively small spire at Oxford Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=the first spire in England surely isn't Christchurch Oxford}} The tallest mediaeval masonry spire is that built in the 13th century at Salisbury Cathedral (123 m - 404 ft).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Others exist at Norwich and [[Chichester Cathedral]]s, while [[Lichfield Cathedral]] has three. Other cathedrals had tall spires of wooden construction sheathed with lead or copper.

In Italy there is no defined stylistic break between Romanesque and Gothic, as the architects had a seemingly pragmatic approach to the use of round and pointed arches.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Towers of apparently Romanesque form often appear in conjunction with otherwise Gothic structures.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} They tend to have graded series of openings in the Romanesque manner like the tower of the [[Badia Fiorentina]]. Some, like the tower at Santa Croce, have large openings of Gothic form and are surmounted by spires.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn addition to towers and spires, great mediaeval churches, may have several other architectural forms, rising above the roof-line, particularly over the crossing.

The increasing height of cathedrals over the Gothic period was accompanied by an increasing proportion of the wall devoted to windows, until, by the late Gothic, the interiors became like cages of glass. This was made possible by the development of the flying buttress, which transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof to the supports outside the walls. As a result, the walls gradually became thinner and higher, and masonry was replaced with glass. The four-part elevation of the naves of early Cathedrals such as Notre-Dame (arcade, tribune, triforium, claire-voie) was transformed in the choir of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] to very tall arcades, a thin triforium, and soaring windows up to the roof.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nBeauvais Cathedral reached the limit of what was possible with Gothic technology. A portion of the choir collapsed in 1284, causing alarm in all of the cities with very tall cathedrals. Panels of experts were created in Sienna and Chartres to study the stability of those structures.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=86}} Only the transept and choir of Beauvais were completed, and in the 21st century, the transept walls were reinforced with cross-beams. No cathedral built since exceeded the height of the choir of Beauvais.{{Sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nA section of the main body of a Gothic church usually shows the [[nave]] as considerably taller than it is wide. In England, the proportion is sometimes greater than 2:1, while the greatest proportional difference achieved is at [[Cologne Cathedral]] with a ratio of 3.6:1. The highest internal vault is at Beauvais Cathedral at {{convert|48|m|ft}}.<ref name=BF/> --->\n\n====Vertical emphasis====\nThe pointed arch lends itself to a suggestion of height. This appearance is characteristically further enhanced by both the architectural features and the decoration of the building.<ref name=Swaan/>{{Page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn the exterior, the verticality is emphasised in a major way by the towers and spires and in a lesser way by strongly projecting vertical buttresses, by narrow half-columns called ''attached shafts'' which often pass through several storeys of the building, by long narrow windows, vertical mouldings around doors and figurative sculpture which emphasises the vertical and is often attenuated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The roof-line, gable ends, buttresses and other parts of the building are often terminated by small pinnacles, [[Milan Cathedral]] being an extreme example in the use of this form of decoration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn the interior of the building attached shafts often sweep unbroken from floor to ceiling and meet the ribs of the vault, like a tall tree spreading into branches. The verticals are generally repeated in the treatment of the windows and wall surfaces. In many Gothic churches, particularly in France, and in the ''Perpendicular period'' of [[English Gothic architecture]], the treatment of vertical elements in gallery and window tracery creates a strongly unifying feature that counteracts the horizontal divisions of the interior structure.<ref name=Swaan/>{{Page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Vertical elements\n | image1    = Reims - 2013-08-27 - IMG 2265.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = West front of Reims Cathedral \n\n | image2    = Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre de Beauvais ext 106.JPG\n | width2    = 167\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The exterior of the choir of Beauvais Cathedral \n\n | image3    = Cenral tympanum Chartres.jpg\n | width3    = 150\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Figures around the central door of Chartres Cathedral \n | image4    = The Five Sisters - geograph.org.uk - 770345.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The Five Sister windows in the north transept at York Minster\n | image5    = PM 103594 F Bourges.jpg\n | width5    = 150\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  =  A clustered column of the nave at Bourges Cathedral  \n | image6    = Koelner dom nordseite des chors.jpg\n | width6    = 167\n | alt6      = \n | caption6  = Vertical elements in the galleries at Cologne Cathedral \n | image7    =Koelner dom blick nach osten.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = The buttresses pinnacles of the choir at Cologne Cathedral \n\n }}\n\n===Light===\nExpansive interior light has been a feature of Gothic cathedrals since the first structure was opened.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The metaphysics of light in the Middle Ages led to clerical belief in its divinity and the importance of its display in holy settings. Much of this belief was based on the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a sixth-century mystic whose book {{Lang-la|[[De Coelesti Hierarchia]]|label=none}} was popular among monks in France.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Pseudo-Dionysius held that all light, even light reflected from metals or streamed through windows, was divine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} To promote such faith, the abbot in charge of the Saint-Denis church on the north edge of Paris, the [[Abbot Suger]], encouraged architects remodelling the building to make the interior as bright as possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nEver since the remodelled [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] opened in 1144, Gothic architecture has featured expansive windows, such as at [[Sainte-Chapelle]], [[York Minster]], [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. The increase in size between windows of the Romanesque and Gothic periods is related to the use of the ribbed vault, and in particular, the pointed ribbed vault which channelled the weight to a supporting shaft with less outward thrust than a semi-circular vault. Walls did not need to be so weighty.<ref name=NP/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=Swaan/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nA further development was the flying buttress which arched externally from the springing of the vault across the roof of the aisle to a large buttress pier projecting well beyond the line of the external wall.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} These piers were often surmounted by a [[pinnacle]] or [[statue]], further adding to the downward weight, and counteracting the outward thrust of the vault and buttress arch as well as stress from wind loading.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe internal columns of the arcade with their attached shafts, the ribs of the vault and the flying buttresses, with their associated vertical buttresses jutting at right-angles to the building, created a stone skeleton. Between these parts, the walls and the infill of the vaults could be of lighter construction. Between the narrow buttresses, the walls could be opened up into large windows.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThrough the Gothic period, thanks to the versatility of the pointed arch, the structure of Gothic windows developed from simple openings to immensely rich and decorative sculptural designs. The windows were very often filled with [[stained glass]] which added a dimension of colour to the light within the building, as well as providing a medium for figurative and narrative art.<ref name=Swaan/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Light\n | image1    =  Flying buttresses of Notre-Dame de Strasbourg.jpg\n | width1    = 185\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Large clerestory windows between flying buttresses at Strasbourg\n | image2    = Lyon 5 - Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Jean 03.jpg\n | width2    = 185\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Tall windows lighting the vault at [[Lyon Cathedral]], made possible by flying buttresses\n | image3    = Chapter House, Wells Cathedral 9 (9317650737).jpg\n | width3    = 185\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Windows in a polygonal arrangement, Lady Chapel, Wells Cathedral\n | image4    = Rouen (24748511178).jpg \n | width4    = 185\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Tall windows in the aisle at Rouen, with additional windows in the triforium   \n | image5    = York Minster, York (14047415195).jpg\n | width5    = 185\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = \"Heart of Yorkshire\" window at York Minster, the scale of most west windows in England. \n | image6    = Paris 2019 (31878003887).jpg\n | width6    = 185\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The array of glass between thin stone mullions, [[Sainte-Chapelle]], Paris\n }}\n\n\n\n==Evolving styles== \nBetween the dedication of the choir at the Abbey of St Denis, Paris, in 1144 and the completion of [[Henry VII's Chapel]] at Westminster Abbey in 1519, there were nearly 400 years of stylistic development in Gothic architecture. Nowhere was this more manifest that in the building of cathedrals and the great churches of abbeys, colleges and prosperous towns.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}  \n\nWhile the plan and elevation of the various types of Gothic ecclesiastical architecture remained consistently linked to purpose and to regional preferences, all the other elements developed, generally towards greater complexity, over the decades.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The piers, the arcades, the galleries, the vaults and the portals, all evolved. The evolution was largely linked to and dependent upon the structural and ornamental flexibility of the pointed arch.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThis development is traditionally divided into periods or styles according to the system of the 19th century French archaeologist [[Arcisse de Caumont]].<ref>Banister Fletcher, 17th edition, p. 534</ref> The periods are generally called Early Gothic (1137-1180), High Gothic (1180-1230), Rayonnant Gothic (1230-1350 and Flamboyant Gothic (1350-1530). These terms apply to the Gothic architecture of France and to those countries where the influence of French Gothic spread. These styles did not, however, progress at the same rate, or in the same way in every country.\n\nIn England, the reconstruction of Westminster Abbey and the east end of Canterbury Cathedral were both influenced by French Gothic, with the architect at Canterbury being [[William of Sens]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Wells Cathedral, however, takes a completely different direction to French Gothic, introducing an unprecedented use of fluted mouldings, and other decorative innovations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Salisbury Cathedral and the nave of Lincoln are also very different to the French prototypes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Hence, the styles of English Gothic are referred to as Early English (or Lancet) Gothic (c. 1180\u20131275), Geometric Decorated and Flamboyant Decorated Gothic, (c. 1275\u20131380); and Perpendicular Gothic, (c. 1380\u20131520), after the system proposed by [[Thomas Rickman]].<ref>Thomas Rickman,  ''Attempt to Discriminate the Style of Architecture in England'' (1812\u201315) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nOne of the indicators of style is the nature of the windows and doors, and their decorative treatment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This is strongly associated with and affected by the type of arches used within the particular building. \nThe Gothic styles, Lancet, Geometric, Rayonnant, Flamboyant and Perpendicular, affected all the various forms of architectonic decoration within the church - arcading, niches, shrines, wooden panelling, furniture of all sorts, reliquaries, vessels, and vestments.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Gothic styles\n | image1    = 0 Soissons - Nef et ch\u0153ur de la cath\u00e9drale Saint-Gervais-et-Saint-Protais (1).JPG\n | width1    = 244\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Early Gothic at Soissons Cathedral, France\n | image2    = 06-Lincoln-049.jpg\n | width2    = 220\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Geometric Gothic at Lincoln Cathedral, England\n | image3    = Auxerre Cath\u00e9drale St. \u00c9tienne Innen Langhaus West 2.jpg\n | width3    = 240\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Rayonnant Gothic at Auxerre Cathedral, France\n | image4    = 68532-Salamanca (49093734597).jpg\n | width4    = 240\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Flamboyant Gothic at Salamanca Cathedral, Spain \n | image5    = Gloucester Cathedral High Altar, Gloucestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg\n | width5    = 208\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Perpndicular Gothic at Gloucester, England\n }} \n\n\n===Arches, windows and tracery===\n====Early or Lancet Gothic====\nThe simplest shape of a Gothic window is a long opening with a pointed arch known in England as the lancet. Lancet windows may be used singly, as in the nave of Lincoln Cathedral, or grouped, as in the nave of Salisbury Cathedral where they are in two in the aisles and threes in the clerestory. Because large lancet windows, such as those lighting the aisles of a cathedral, may be wide in comparison to a single light in a traceried window, they often have armatures of wood or iron to support the glass. The arch of a lancet opening is often equilateral, but sometimes is much more acute, and when employed in the arcade of a choir apse, such as at Westminster Abbey, adds to the emphasis of height.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThe simple shape of the lancet arch may appear in Early Gothic buildings on openings of all types, doorways, niches, arcades, including galleries; and belfry openings.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\nThe use of lancet windows is found in the Early Gothic architecture of France, at the Abbey of St Denis, Sens and [[Senlis Cathedral]]s. At Chartres and Laon Cathedrals lancet windows are grouped beneath the rose windows. Tall narrow lancets are also found in radiating groups in the chancel apses of some cathedrals, such as Chartres.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} It is common in France for lancet windows to be used in smaller, narrower spaces, such as the chapels of a chevet, while traceries windows are used in the clerestory.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}  \n\nThe style Lancet Gothic is known in England as Early English Gothic, with Salisbury Cathedral being the prime example. [[York Minster]] has a group of lancet windows each fifty feet high and still containing ancient glass. They are known as the Five Sisters. <ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} Wells Cathedral is notable for the continuous rows of lancet openings that make up the triforiun galleries. \nLancet windows are used extensively in the Gothic churches of Italy, including Florence Cathedral and in the [[Brick Gothic]] churches of Germany and Poland.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\n====Geometric Gothic (England)====\nThe Equilateral Arch lends itself to filling with tracery of simple equilateral, circular and semi-circular forms. In France, windows of clerestorys, and other larger windows were commonly divided into two lights, with some simple Geometric tracery above, a circle or a cinquefoil or sexfoil. This style of window remained popular without great change until after 1300.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn England there was a much greater variation in the design of tracery that evolved to fill these spaces. The style is known as Geometric Decorated Gothic and can be seen to splendid effect at many English cathedrals and abbey churches, where both the eastern and the western terminations of the building may be occupied by a single large window such as the east window at Lincoln and the west window at Worcester Cathedral. Windows of complex design and of three or more ''lights'' or vertical sections, are often designed by overlapping two or more equilateral arches springing from the vertical mullions.<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n====Rayonnant Gothic====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nRayonnant Gothic is the term used particularly to described the style that produced the great rose windows of France. These windows deck not only the west fronts of cathedrals, but often, as at Notre Dame de Paris, the transept gables as well. It is common that although the transepts of French Cathedrals do not project strongly, they are given visual importance almost equal to the west front, including large decorated portals and a rose window. Particularly fine examples are at Notre Dame and Chartres Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n====Flamboyant Gothic====\nThe [[Flamboyant]] Arch is one that is drafted from four points, the upper part of each main arc turning upwards into a smaller arc and meeting at a sharp, flame-like point. These arches create a rich and lively effect when used for window tracery and surface decoration. The form is structurally weak and has very rarely been used for large openings except when contained within a larger and more stable arch. It is not employed at all for [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]].<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nSome of the most beautiful and famous traceried windows of Europe employ this type of tracery. It can be seen at [[St Stephen's Vienna]], [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris, at the Cathedrals of [[Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Limoges|Limoges]] and [[Rouen Cathedral|Rouen]] in France. In England the most famous examples are the West Window of [[York Minster]] with its design based on the [[Sacred Heart]], the extraordinarily rich nine-light East Window at [[Carlisle Cathedral]] and the exquisite East window of [[Selby Abbey]].<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=NP/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDoorways surmounted by Flamboyant mouldings are very common in both ecclesiastical and domestic architecture in France. They are much rarer in England. A notable example is the doorway to the Chapter Room at [[Rochester Cathedral]].<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe style was much used in England for wall arcading and niches. Prime examples in are in the Lady Chapel at [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], the Screen at [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and externally on the fa\u00e7ade of [[Exeter Cathedral]]. In German and Spanish Gothic architecture it often appears as openwork screens on the exterior of buildings. The style was used to rich and sometimes extraordinary effect in both these countries, notably on the famous pulpit in [[Vienna Cathedral]].<ref name=JH1/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Perpendicular Gothic (England)====\nThe depressed or [[four-centred arch]] is much wider than its height and gives the visual effect of having been flattened under pressure. Its structure is achieved by drafting two arcs which rise steeply from each springing point on a small [[radius]] and then turn into two arches with a wide radius and much lower springing point.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThis type of arch, when employed as a window opening, lends itself to very wide spaces, provided it is adequately supported by many narrow vertical shafts. These are often further braced by horizontal transoms. The overall effect produces a grid-like appearance of regular, delicate, rectangular forms with an emphasis on the perpendicular. It is also employed as a wall decoration in which arcade and window openings form part of the whole decorative surface.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe style, known as [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular]], that evolved from this treatment is specific to England, although very similar to contemporary Spanish style in particular, and was employed to great effect through the 15th century and first half of the 16th as Renaissance styles were much slower to arrive in England than in Italy and France.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt can be seen notably at the East End of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] where the East Window is said to be as large as a tennis court.

Columns of this type were used at the Abbey of St Denis, at Sens, at Notre Dame and at Canterbury in England. In buildings with sexpartite vaults, they sometimes alternated with piers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn the [[Brabantine Gothic architecture]] of the Holland and Belgium, columns remained part of the style into the 15th century, and have capitals of cabbage leaf foliage.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn France, the column developed in complexity by having a cluster of circular shafts grouped around the central circular core. This is seen a Reims, Amiens and Bourges Cathedrals, and also at Westminster Abbey and Salisbury Cathedral and in Spain at Burgos Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThe rectangular piers also developed, with attached shafts and mouldings which continue up the wall to support the vault, or into the decorative mouldings of the chancel arch, in a manner that had previously been utilised to decorate the arches of Romanesque portals. The eastern end of the Abbey of Saint Etienne, Caen, was rebuilt from 1166, with clustered piers. From 1176, Wells Cathedral was constructed with clustered piers throughout. Between the two buildings there is a great difference in the handling of the two. At Caen, the pier remains a decorated rectangular pier, set parallel to the wall surface. The shafts themselves maintain a circular, and classicising form. At Well, the core of the pier appears to have been rotated, and become a lozenge, angle-on to the lie of the arcade. The clusters of shafts are fluting. The capitals are of what is know as \"stiff-leaf\" foliage, and has a vitality of form different to any other foliage carving of that date.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nComplex clustered columns and fluted and shafted piers were subsequently widely adopted, and became part of the vertical visual character of Gothic cathedrals.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Columns and piers\n | image1    = Vue du choeur de la cath\u00e9drale.JPG\n | width1    = 197\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Corinthian columns in the choir at Rouen Cathedral\n | image2    = PM 103631 F Bourges.jpg\n | width2    = 175\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Tall columns with clusters of shafts, Bourges Cathedral \n | image3    = Salisbury 9978.jpg \n | width3    = 175\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  =  Columns in the nave of Salisbury Cathedral\n | image4    =  Wells Cathedral (St. Andrew) (16466400434).jpg\n | width4    = 175\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Fluted piers with Stiff Leaf capitals at Wells Cathedral\n | image5    = Seville Cathedral (6931811902).jpg\n | width5    = 175\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Very tall fluted piers at [[Seville Cathedral]], Spain\n  }}\n\n===Developments in ribbed vaulting===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}In France the vaults over the high spaces of nave and clerestory, in the Early Gothic period, was sexpartite, spanning two bays of the nave. This resulted in the vaulted space being almost square, and to diagoal ribs being semi-circular. Only the arches of the transverse ribs were pointed. This is the case at Sens, at Notre Dame de Paris and the Nave of Laon Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nAt Chartres Cathedral, and the choir of Laon Cathedral, however, the vault is in four parts, spans a single bay, is rectangular, and all the ribs are pointed. The quadripartite proved much easier to build because it required less centring. It is also stronger as the compartments are smaller. The quadripartite vault is used in the Early English cathedrals of Salisbury and Wells. It became the standard form of vault which leant itself to further development and elaboration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn the nave of Lincoln Cathedral the vault acquired extra ribs known as \"tiercerons\" which meet at a central \"ridge rib\" running the length of the nave. An additional elaboration, to span the wide nave, was the introduction of intermediate ribs which do not reach the centre of the vault, but join two small \"lierne\" ribs projecting from the ridge. Other cathedrals with tierceron vaulting are Norwich, and Exeter.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nLierne ribs became a feature of later Gothic design, as at [[Bristol Cathedral]] and led the way to elaborate patterns within the vault, including net or \"reticular\" vaulting and \"stellar\" vaulting. Stellar vaulting was particularly fashionable in Germany, Eastern Europe and Spain. The use of short ribs lent itself to the introduction of curved and ogee shaped ribs, in the Flamboyant style. Flamboynt vaulting is particularly prevalent in Spain.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\nIn England there are a number of chapter house, notably at Wells, Lincoln and Westminster abbey, where the vault is supported by a single central column from which many ribs radiate in every direction like a palm tree. This also occurs at the high vault behind the altar at [[Jacobins Church]], Toulouse, in France.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nA further development was many shallow ribs radiating in a fan shape, so that visually, the appearance of the structural ribs is minimised, and the emphasis is upon the curving surfaces. These fan vaults were used successfully for narrower and lower structures such as the cloister at Gloucester Cathedral and the retrochoir at Peterborough, before being employed on the high vaults at the Chapel of Kings College Cambridge, and even even more elaborate form with pendant lanterns attached, at Henry VII's Chapel at Westminster Abbey.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Style- Ribbed vaults\n | image1    = B\u00f3veda de catedral de Notre Dame de Par\u00eds 3.jpg\n | width1    = 144\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Notre Dame, Paris- square, sexpartite vaults spanning two nave bays\n | image2    = Salisbury Cathedral Interior 01.jpg\n | width2    = 162\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Salisbury Cathedral, England- rectangular quadripartite vault over single bay\n | image3    = Lincoln cathedral 13 Nave vault.jpg\n | width3    = 162\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Lincoln Cathedral, England- quadripartite form, with tierceron ribs and ridge rib with carved bosses. \n | image4    = \n | width4    = 155\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  =   \n | image5    = Bremer Dom Juli 2009 PD 060.JPG\n | width5    = 144\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Bremer Cathedral, Germany- north aisle, a reticular (net) vault with intersecting ribs. \n | image6    = Wolfsberg Sankt Marein Pfarrkirche Mariae Himmelfahrt Netzrippengewoelbe 03092014 742.jpg\n | width6    = 144\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = St Marien's, Wolfsberg, Austria- stellar vault with intersecting lierne ribs.  \n | image7    = B\u00f3vedas catedral Salamanca 40.jpg\n | width7    = 162\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Salamanca Cathedral, Spain- vault has Flamboyant S-shaped and circular lierne ribs, \n | image8    = Peterborough Retrochoir fan vaulting.JPG\n | width8    = 160\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  = Peterborough Cathedral retrochoir- fan vaulting, which further evolved into pemdant vaulting. \n }}\n\n<!---\n===Early Gothic architectural elements, 1137-1180 ===  \n\nThese elements are those to be found in the earliest Gothic buildings of France, Abbey, of St Denis, Sens Cathedral, Senlis Cathedral, Noyon Cathedral, and also affected the rebuilding of the choir at Canterbury in Kent, England, after a fire in 1174. \n\n* Pointed arches, often of equilateral projection \n* Continued use of semi-circular arches in conjunction with pointed arches e.g. in vaulting ribs \n* Ribbed vaulting\n* Nave vault sexpartite, spanning two bays \n* Quadripartite ailse vaults, trapezoid where necessary\n* Cylindrical columns, with simplified Corinthian capitals;

Historians including [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]], Focillon, Aubert, and [[Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] contended that this is one of the most universal features of the Gothic style.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=20}}\n\nReligious teachings in the Middle Ages, particularly the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a 6th-century mystic whose book, ''[[De Coelesti Hierarchia]]'', was popular among monks in France, taught that all light was divine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} When the Abbot [[Suger]] ordered the reconstruction of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]], he instructed that the windows in the choir admit as much light as possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nMany earlier Romanesque churches had stained glass windows, and many had round windows, called ''oculi'', but these windows were necessarily small, due to the thickness of the walls. The primary interior decorations of Romanesque cathedrals were painted murals. In the Gothic period, the improvements in rib vaults and flying buttresses allowed cathedral walls to be higher, thinner and stronger, and windows were consequently considerably larger, The windows of churches in the late Gothic period, such as [[Sainte Chapelle]] in Paris, filled the entire wall between the ribs of stone. Enormous windows were also an important element of [[York Minster]] and [[Gloucester Cathedral]].<ref name=Swaan/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe main threat to cathedral windows was the wind; frames had to be extremely strong. The early windows were fit into openings cut into the stone. The small pieces of coloured glass were joined together with pieces of lead, and then their surfaces were painted with faces and other details. and then the windows were mounted in the stone frames. Thin vertical and horizontal bars of iron, called ''vergettes'' or ''barlotierres'', were placed inside the window to reinforce the glass.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe stories told in the glass were usually episodes from the [[Bible]], but they also sometimes illustrated the professions of the guilds which had funded the windows, such as the drapers, stonemasons or the barrel-makers.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\nMuch of the stained glass in Gothic cathedrals today dates from later restorations, but a few cathedrals, notably [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Bourges Cathedral]], still have many of their original windows.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\n===Sculpture and decoration===\n\nThe exteriors and interiors of Gothic cathedrals, particularly in France, were lavishly ornamented with sculpture and decoration on religious themes, designed for the great majority of parishioners who could not read. They were described as \"Books for the poor.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} To add to the effect, all of the sculpture on the facades was originally painted and gilded.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Viollet-le-Duc, Eug\u00e9ne, ''Dictionnaire Raisonn\u00e9 de l'architecture Fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVI siecle'', Volume 6.

The main portals at [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], for instance, represented the entrance to paradise, with the [[Last Judgement]] depicted on the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the doors, showing Christ surrounded by the apostles, and by the signs of the zodiac, representing the movements of the heavens. The columns below the tympanum are in the form of statues of saints, literally reprinting them as \"the pillars of the church.\"{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}} Each Saint had his own symbol: a winged lion stood for [[Saint Mark]], an eagle with four wings meant [[Saint John the Apostle]], and a winged bull symbolized [[Saint Luke]]. Sculpted angels had specific functions, sometimes as heralds, blowing trumpets, or holding up columns, as guardian angels; or holding crowns of thorns or crosses, as symbols of the crucifixion of Christ, or waving a container with incense, to illustrate their function at the throne of God. Floral and vegetal decoration was also very common, representing the [[Garden of Eden]]; grapes represented the wines of [[Eucharist]].{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}}\n\nThe [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the central portal on the west facade of Notre-Dame de Paris vividly illustrates the Last Judgement, with figures of sinners being led off to hell, and good Christians taken to heaven. The sculpture of the right portal shows the coronation of the [[Virgin Mary]], and the left portal shows the lives of saints who were important to Parisians, particularly [[Saint Anne]], the mother of the Virgin Mary.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=35}}\n\nThe exteriors of cathedrals and other Gothic churches were also decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[Grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters. These included the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], a mythical hybrid creature which usually had the body of a lion and the head of a goat, and the [[Strix (mythology)|strix]] or stryge, a creature resembling an [[owl]] or [[bat]], which was said to eat human flesh. The strix appeared in classical Roman literature; it was described by the Roman poet [[Ovid]], who was widely read in the Middle Ages, as a large-headed bird with transfixed eyes, rapacious beak, and greyish white wings.<ref name=fasti>Frazer, James George (1933) ed., Ovid, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi007.perseus-lat1:6 ''Fasti''] VI. 131\u2013,{{harvp|Riley|1851|p=216}}, tr.</ref> They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshippers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=97\u201399}}\n\nThe [[gargoyle]]s, which were added to Notre-Dame in about 1240, had a more practical purpose. They were the rain spouts of the cathedral, designed to divide the torrent of water which poured from the roof after rain, and to project it outwards as far as possible from the buttresses and the walls and windows so that it would not erode the mortar binding the stone. To produce many thin streams rather than a torrent of water, a large number of gargoyles were used, so they were also designed to be a decorative element of the architecture. The rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses, then along a channel cut in the back of the gargoyle and out of the mouth away from the cathedral.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nMany of the statues, particularly the grotesques, were removed from the facade in the 17th and 18th century, or were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} They were replaced with figures in the Gothic style, designed by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]] during the 19th-century restoration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Similar figures appear on the other Gothic cathedrals of France.\n\nAnother common feature of Gothic cathedrals in France was a [[labyrinth]] or maze on the floor of the nave near the choir, which symbolized the difficult and often complicated journey of a Christian life before attaining paradise. Most labyrinths were removed by the 18th century, but a few, like the one at [[Amiens Cathedral]], have been reconstructed, and the labyrinth at [[Chartres Cathedral]] still exists essentially in its original form.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=99\u2013100}}\n\n==Synagogues==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"175\">\nFile:Blick von der Gartenseite der Synagoge Worms.jpg|Romanesque [[Worms Synagogue]] from the 11th century with Gothic windows (after 1355)\nFile:Scolanova Synagogue.jpg|[[Scolanova Synagogue]], [[Trani]] (1247)\nFile:20190204 OldSynagoga 3715 (33586950518).jpg|[[Old New Synagogue]], [[Prague]] (c. 1270)\nFile:Altneusynagoge - Portal.jpg|Main portal of the Old New Synagogue, Prague (c. 1270)\nFile:Erfurt Alte Synagoge 688.jpg|[[Old Synagogue (Erfurt)|Old Synagogue]], [[Erfurt]] (c. 1270)\nFile:Praha Pinkas Synagogue Interior 02.jpg|Late Gothic vaulting of [[Pinkas Synagogue]], Prague (1535)\nFile:Krakow Old Synagogue G21.jpg|Renaissance interior of the [[Old Synagogue in Krakow|Old Synagogue]] in [[Krak\u00f3w|Cracow]] using Gothic vaults (1570)\n</gallery>\n\nAlthough Christianity played a dominant role in the Gothic sacred architecture, Jewish communities were present in many European cities during the Middle Ages and they also built their [[Synagogue|houses of prayer]] in the Gothic style.

The new fortifications were more geometric, usually square, with a high main ''donjon'' or tower, in the centre, which could be defended even if the walls of the castle were captured. The Donjon of the [[Chateau de Vincennes]], begun by [[Philip VI of France]], was a good example. It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other. The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''cr\u00e9neaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings (''[[merlon]]s'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''[[Machicolation|m\u00e2chicoulis]]''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''[[Bartizan|\u00e9chauguettes]]'' and ''[[bret\u00e8che]]s'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below. In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''[[Arrowslit|meurtri\u00e8res]]'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbal\u00e8tes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=66\u201367}}\n\nCastles were surrounded by a deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge. The entrance was also protected by a grill of iron which could be opened and closed. The walls at the bottom were often sloping, and protected with earthen barriers.

They remained as symbols of the rank of their noble occupants; the narrowing openings in the walls were often widened into the windows of bedchambers and ceremonial halls.

The largest new church, [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]] (1532\u20131560), rivalled Notre-Dame in size, 105 meters long, 44 meters wide, and 35 meters high.

The term \"Gothic\" was first used as a [[pejorative]] description.

The appeal of this [[Gothic revival]] (which after 1837, in Britain, is sometimes termed [[Victorian Gothic]]), gradually widened to encompass \"low church\" as well as \"high church\" clients. This period of more universal appeal, spanning 1855\u20131885, is known in Britain as [[High Victorian Gothic]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in London by Sir [[Charles Barry]] with interiors by a major exponent of the early Gothic Revival, [[Augustus Welby Pugin]], is an example of the Gothic revival style from its earlier period in the second quarter of the 19th century. Examples from the ''High Victorian Gothic'' period include [[George Gilbert Scott]]'s design for the [[Albert Memorial]] in London, and [[William Butterfield]]'s chapel at [[Keble College, Oxford]]. From the second half of the 19th century onwards, it became more common in Britain for neo-Gothic to be used in the design of non-ecclesiastical and non-governmental buildings types. Gothic details even began to appear in working-class housing schemes subsidised by philanthropy, though given the expense, less frequently than in the design of upper and middle-class housing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe middle of the 19th century was a period marked by the restoration, and in some cases modification, of ancient monuments and the construction of neo-Gothic edifices such as the nave of [[Cologne Cathedral]] and the [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clotilde]] of [[Paris]] as speculation of mediaeval architecture turned to technical consideration.

The plan of the Gothic cathedral was based upon the plan of the ancient Roman [[basilica]], which was adopted by Romanesque architecture. The [[Latin cross]] form, with a [[nave]] and transept, choir, disambulatory, and radiating chapels, came from the Romanesque model. The grand arcades of columns separating the central vessel of the [[nave]] from the collateral aisles, the [[triforium]] over the grand arcades, and the windows high on the walls allowing light into the nave were all also adapted from the Romanesque model. The portal with a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] filled with sculpture was another characteristic Romanesque feature, as was the use of the buttress to support the walls from the outside. Gothic architects improved them by adding the [[flying buttress]] with high arches connecting the buttresses to the upper walls. In the interior, Romanesque architecture used the [[barrel vault]] with a round arch to cover the nave, and a [[groin vault]] when two barrel vaults met at right angles. These vaults were the immediate ancestors of the Gothic rib vault. The first use of the Gothic rib vaults to cover a nave was in the Romanesque [[Durham Cathedral]], (1093\u20131104).<ref name=\"auto\">Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2018), pp. 35-37</ref>\n\n[[Norman Architecture]], similar to the Romanesque style, also influenced the Gothic style. Early examples are found in [[Lessay Abbey]] in Normandy, which also featured early rib vaults in the nave similar to the Gothic vaults. [[Cefalu Cathedral]] (1131\u20131267) in Sicily, built when Sicily was under Norman rule, is another interesting example. It featured pointed arches and large Romanesque vaults combined with ornamental mosaic decoration.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nRomanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as [[Ireland]] and [[Croatia]], and [[Sweden]] and [[Sicily]]. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders did not define divisions of style. Many different factors like geographical/geological, economic, social, or political situations caused the regional differences in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period that would often become even more apparent in the Gothic. For example, studies of the population statistics reveals disparities such as the multitude of churches, abbeys, and cathedrals in northern [[France]] while in more urbanised regions construction activity of a similar scale was reserved to a few important cities. Such an example comes from Roberto L\u00f3pez, wherein the French city of [[Amiens]] was able to fund its architectural projects whereas [[Cologne]] could not because of the economic inequality of the two.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25-26}} This wealth, concentrated in rich monasteries and noble families, would eventually spread certain Italian, Catalan, and Hanseatic bankers.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25}} This would be amended when the economic hardships of the 13th century were no longer felt, allowing [[Normandy]], [[Tuscany]], [[Flanders]], and the southern [[Rhineland]] to enter into competition with France.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=26}} \n\n===Islamic and Armenian influence===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nAl-Ukhaidir Fortess.jpg|[[Al-Ukhaidir Fortress]] (completed 775 AD), Iraq\nJerusalem-2013-Al-Aqsa Mosque 04.jpg|[[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], Jerusalem\nCordoba, la Mezquita - C\u00fapula de la Maqsura.jpg|Vaulted central dome of [[Cordoba Cathedral|Cordoba Mosque-Cathedral]], Spain (784\u2013987 A.D.).

It is the primary engineering innovation and the characteristic design component. The use of the pointed arch in turn led to the development of the pointed [[ribbed vault]], the [[flying buttress]] and window tracery.<ref>Bannister Fletcher, 17th edition, p.367, p.524</ref> These elements together formed a structurally and aesthetically integrated system, or style, that characterises the Gothic.<ref>Moffett, Fazio and Wodehouse, p.230</ref>\n\nAt the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], near Paris, the choir was reconstructed between 1140 and 1144, drawing together for the first time the developing Gothic architectural features. In doing so, a new architectural style emerged that internally emphasised verticality in the structural members, and the effect created by the transmission of light through [[stained glass window]]s.{{sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nGothic architecture is most common as [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Church architecture|ecclesiastical architecture]], characterising many mediaeval [[cathedral]]s, [[abbey]]s, and [[Parish church|parish churches]] of Europe. It is also the architecture of many [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[town hall]]s, [[guildhall]]<nowiki/>s, universities and less prominently, private dwellings. Many of the finest examples of mediaeval Gothic architecture are listed with [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Site]]s.\n\nWith the development of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Italy during the mid 15th century, the Gothic style was supplanted by the new style, but in some regions, notably England, Gothic continued to flourish and develop into the 16th century. A series of [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revivals]] began in mid-18th century England, spread through 19th century Europe and continued, largely for ecclesiastical and university structures, into the 20th century.\n\n==Name== \nGothic architecture is also known as pointed architecture or ogival architecture.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Citation|last=|first=|title=ogive|date=2015|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199674985.001.0001/acref-9780199674985-e-3177|work=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|volume=|pages=|editor-last=Curl|editor-first=James Stevens|edition=3rd|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199674985.001.0001/acref-9780199674985-e-3177|isbn=978-0-19-967498-5|access-date=2020-04-09|editor2-last=Wilson|editor2-first=Susan}}</ref> Mediaeval contemporaries described the style as {{Lang-la|opus Francigenum|lit=French work' or '[[Frankish]] work}}, as {{Lang-la|opus modernum|lit=modern work|label=none}}, {{Lang-la|novum opus|lit=new work|label=none}}, or as {{Lang-it|maniera tedesca|lit=German style}}.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bogdanovi\u0107|first=Jelena|title=opus Francigenum|date=2010-01-01|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198662624.001.0001/acref-9780198662624-e-4321|work=The Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages|volume=|pages=|editor-last=Bjork|editor-first=Robert E.|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198662624.001.0001/acref-9780198662624-e-4321|isbn=978-0-19-866262-4|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>Bannister Fletcher, p.524</ref>\n\nThe term \"[[Gothic (disambiguation)|Gothic]] architecture\" originated as a [[pejorative]] description.

Vasari was echoed in the 16th century by [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]], who referred to [[Goths]] and [[Ostrogoths]] (''Gotz'' and ''Ostrogotz'').<ref name=\"Ref_a\">\"Gotz\" is rendered as \"Huns\" in [[Thomas Urquhart]]'s English translation.</ref>{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nAccording to a 19th-century correspondent in the London journal ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', Gothic was a derisive misnomer; the pointed arcs and architecture of the [[Late Middle Ages|later Middle Ages]] was quite different to the rounded arches prevalent in [[late antiquity]] and the period of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in Italy:\n<blockquote>There can be no doubt that the term 'Gothic' as applied to pointed styles of ecclesiastical architecture was used at first contemptuously, and in derision, by those who were ambitious to imitate and revive the Grecian orders of architecture, after the revival of classical literature. But, without citing many authorities, such as [[Christopher Wren]], and others, who lent their aid in depreciating the old mediaeval style, which they termed Gothic, as synonymous with every thing that was barbarous and rude, it may be sufficient to refer to the celebrated Treatise of Sir [[Henry Wotton]], entitled ''The Elements of Architecture'', ... printed in London so early as 1624. ... But it was a strange misapplication of the term to use it for the pointed style, in contradistinction to the circular, formerly called Saxon, now Norman, Romanesque, &c. These latter styles, like [[Lombard architecture|Lombardic]], Italian, and the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]], of course belong more to the Gothic period than the light and elegant structures of the pointed order which succeeded them.<ref name=\"Ref_b\">''[[Notes and Queries]]'', No. 9. 29 December 1849</ref></blockquote>\n\n== History ==\nArchitecture \"became a leading form of artistic expression during the late Middle Ages\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Gothic architecture began in the earlier 12th century in northwest France and England and spread throughout Latin Europe in the 13th century; by 1300, a first \"international style\" of Gothic had developed, with common design features and formal language.

By the early 12th century the ribbed vaults, characteristic of Gothic architecture, were coming into use.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} They appeared at the naves of two Romanesque churches in Caen, France, the [[Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen|Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne]] and the [[Abbaye aux Dames]] in 1120.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The ribbed vault over the north transept at [[Durham Cathedral]] in England, built from 1128 to 1133, was the first time pointed arches were used in a high vault. Pointed ribbed vaults were used in the chancel of [[Cathedral of Cefal\u00f9]] in 1131.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe three-tiered interior elevation of arcade, gallery and clerestory that is typical of great Gothic churches, was well established in the Norman buildings of England, appearing at [[norwich Cathedral|Norwich]], [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough]] and Durham Cathedrals as well as the Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen, in France.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nOne of the features that unifies the internal appearance of a great Gothic church is the emphasis on vertical elements, in particular attached shafts that pass from the floor to the vault.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} These first appeared in France in the early 11th century in churches that have broad ribs reinforcing a barrel vault. They are also seen at [[Lisbon Cathedral|Lisbon]] and [[Speyer Cathedral]]s, [[Santiago de Compostela]] and [[V\u00e9zelay Abbey|la Madeleine Vezelay]] in conjunction with groin vaults, as well as at the three Norman cathedrals of East Anglia, of which Peterborough and Ely retain wooden ceilings, while Norwich was not vaulted until the 15th century.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe admission of light to the building through a multiplicity of windows was an important element in England. At Peterborough Cathedral, the polygonal Norman apse has remained, as has three tiers of large Norman windows, now filled with Gothic tracery and 19th century stained glass.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The transept ends at Peterborough, Ely and Norwich each have three rows of large Norman windows. This grouping of windows prefigures the clusters of Gothic lancet windows that are found in many English churches such [[Salisbury Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Rose window]]s, characteristic of the west fronts and transept ends of the cathedrals of France, were common in architecture of Germany in the Romanesque period, where they appear in various forms at [[Worms Cathedral]], and in Italy where they are either untraceried [[Oculus|oculi]] or wheel windows such as that at the [[Basilica of San Zeno]], Verona.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The first rose window above the west portal in France is said{{By whom|date=April 2020}} to be that at the [[Basilica of Saint Denis|Abbaye Saint-Denis]] 1140. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] is generally cited as the first truly Gothic building, however the distinction is best reserved for the choir, of which the [[ambulatory]] remains intact.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} [[Noyon Cathedral]] saw the earliest completion of a rebuilding of an entire French cathedral in the new style from 1150 to 1231.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} While using all those features that came to be known as Gothic, including pointed arches, flying buttresses and ribbed vaulting, the builders continued to employ many of the features and much of the character of Romanesque architecture including round-headed arch throughout the building, varying the shape to pointed where it was functionally practical to do so.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAt the Abbey Saint-Denis, [[Sens Cathedral]], Noyon Cathedral, [[Notre Dame de Paris]] and at the eastern end of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in England, simple cylindrical columns predominate over the Gothic forms of clustered columns and shafted piers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Wells Cathedral]] in England, commenced at the eastern end in 1175, was the first building in which the designer broke free from Romanesque forms. The architect entirely dispensed with the round arch in favour of the pointed arch and with cylindrical columns in favour of piers composed of clusters of shafts which lead into the mouldings of the arches. The transepts and nave were continued by Adam Locke in the same style and completed in about 1230. The character of the building is entirely Gothic. Wells Cathedral is thus considered the first truly Gothic cathedral.<ref>Cannon, J. 2007.

One of the builders who is believed to have worked on Sens Cathedral, [[William of Sens]], later traveled to England and became the architect who, between 1175 and 1180, reconstructed the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in the new Gothic style. {{sfn|Mignon (2015|pp. 10-11}}\n\nSens was quickly followed by  [[Senlis Cathedral]] (begun 1160), and the most prominent of all, [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]] in Paris (begun 1160). Their builders abandoned the traditional plans and introduced the new Gothic elements.  The builders of Notre Dame went further by introducing the flying buttress, heavy columns of support outside the walls connected by arches to the walls, which received and counterbalanced the thrust from the rib vaults of the roof.  This allowed the builders to construct higher walls and larger windows.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 36</ref>  --->\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | perrow    = 4\n | total_width= \n\n | image1    = Ely Cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 1766558.jpg\n | width1    = 168\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = The south western tower at Ely Cathedral, England\n\n | image2    = Durham.2 crop.jpg\n | width2    = 160\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The nave vault with pointed transverse arches at Durham Cathedral\n\n | image3    = Abbaye aux hommes int\u00e9rieur 03.jpeg\n | width3    = 170\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = The sexpartite ribbed vault at Saint Etienne, Caen\n\n | image4    = Cefalu Cathedral interior BW 2012-10-11 12-07-53.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = interior of the [[Cathedral of Cefalu]].\n}}\n\n===Abbot Suger===\nThe eastern end of the [[St Denis Basilica|Basilica Church of Saint-Denis]], built by [[Abbot Suger]] and completed in 1144, is often cited{{By whom|date=April 2020}} as the first truly Gothic building, as it draws together many of architectural forms which had evolved from the Romanesque and typify the Gothic style.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nSuger, friend and confidant of the French Kings, [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] and [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], decided in about 1137, to rebuild the great Church of Saint-Denis, attached to an abbey which was also a royal residence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} He began with the West Front, reconstructing the original [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] fa\u00e7ade with its single door.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} He designed the west front of Saint-Denis to be an echo of the Roman [[Triumphal Arch of Constantine|Arch of Constantine]] with its three-part division and three large portals to ease the problem of congestion.

The choir and west front of the Abbey of Saint-Denis both became the prototypes for further building in the royal domain of northern France and in the Duchy of Normandy.

In other words, when the arch is drafted, the [[radius]] is exactly the width of the opening and the centre of each arch coincides with the point from which the opposite arch springs. <small>(See diagram)</small> This makes the arch higher in relation to its width than a semi-circular arch which is exactly half as high as it is wide.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} The equilateral arch gives a wide opening of satisfying proportion useful for doorways, decorative arcades and large windows.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe structural beauty of the Gothic arch means that no set proportion had to be rigidly maintained.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The equilateral arch was employed as a useful tool, not as a principle of design.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This meant that narrower or wider arches were introduced into a building plan wherever necessity dictated.

The other structural advantage is that the pointed arch channels the weight onto the bearing piers or columns at a steep angle. This enabled architects to raise vaults much higher than was possible in Romanesque architecture.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn Romanesque architecture, the rounded arches of the [[barrel vault]]s that covered the nave pressed directly down on the walls with crushing weight. This required massive columns, thick walls and small windows, and naturally limited the height of the building. Gothic architects found a solution through an innovative use of the rib vault.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}\n\nAn early kind of rib vault, used at [[Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba]] (8th century), was found under a [[cupola]] or [[dome]], but was different in form and function from the later Gothic rib vault. The cupola itself was supported by [[pendentive]]s or [[squinch]]es, a practice used in [[Byzantine architecture]]. The ribs were decorative. The vaults in churches in [[Sicily]] dated to the 11th century, after Sicily had been conquered by the Normans, and resembled the vaults used at the same time in Normandy and England.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=188\u2013190}}\n\nGothic builders designed a new and lighter kind of rib vault. They divided into compartments by a diagonal crossing of thin stone ribs (''ogives''), and completed by two additional arcs perpendicular and parallel to the nave (''doubleaux'' and ''formerets''). They also made innovative use of the broken arch or pointed arch. In Islamic and Romanesque architecture, pointed arches had usually been used in doorways and windows. Gothic architects used them at the meeting points of the ribs at the top of the vaults, which distributed the weight of the roof downwards and outwards, not just downwards.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}} These ribs divided the early vaults into six compartments, each as wide as two traverses of the nave. Some of the ribs went downwards as [[colonette]]s and were bundled into pillars on the ground floor. Other ribs carried the thrust outwards to the walls, where it was counterbalanced by heavy flying buttresses outside the walls. Since the weight was supported by pillars and buttresses, the walls themselves could be much higher and thinner. This made possible the expanses of [[stained glass]] that were a characteristic of Gothic cathedrals.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}}\n\nThe earlier Gothic rib vaults, used at Notre-Dame, Noyon, and Laon, were divided by the ribs into six compartments, were very difficult to build, and could only cross a limited space. In later cathedral construction, the design was simplified, and the rib vaults had only four compartments, and could cover a wider span; a single vault could cross the nave, and fewer pillars were needed. The four-part vaults also made it possible to build the cathedrals even higher. [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], begun in 1163 with four-part vaults, reached a height of 35 meters, remarkable for the time. [[Amiens Cathedral]], begun in 1220 with four-part ribs, reached the height of 42.30 meters (138.8 feet) at the transept.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=18-28}}\n\n===Buttresses=== \n[[File:Strebewerk-2.jpg|thumb|Section of Reims Cathedral with flying buttress over aisles.]] \nAnother important feature of Gothic architecture was the [[flying buttress]], designed to support the walls by means of arches connected to counter-supports outside the walls. Flying buttresses had existed in simple forms since Roman times, but the Gothic builders raised their use to a fine art, balancing the thrust from the roof inside against the counter-thrust of the buttresses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The earliest Gothic churches, including Saint-Denis and Notre-Dame in its beginning stages, did not have flying buttresses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Their walls were supported by heavy stone [[abutment]]s placed directly against the walls.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The roof was supported by the ribs of the vaults, which were bundled with the columns below.\n\nIn the later 12th and early 13th century, the buttresses became more sophisticated. New arches carried the thrust of the weight entirely outside the walls, where it was met by the counter-thrust of stone columns, with pinnacles placed on top for decoration and for additional weight. Thanks to this system of external buttresses, the walls could be higher and thinner, and could support larger stained glass windows. The buttresses themselves became part of the decoration; the pinnacles became more and more ornate, becoming more and more elaborate, as at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]].

The area where the nave and transept meet is called the crossing, and in England is often surmounted by a stone tower, as at [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and [[York Minster]], visible on a ground-plan by the sturdy piers that support the tower.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} (see below)\n\nThe nave is generally flanked on either side by aisles, usually single as at York Minster and [[Florence Cathedral]] but sometimes double as at [[bourges Cathedral|Bourges]] and [[Cologne Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} (see plans below). Aisles may extend along the sides of the transepts as well, as at Cologne, [[Amiens Cathedral]] and York Minster.(see plans) In the South of France there is often a single wide nave and no aisles, as at [[Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges]] and [[Albi Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn some churches with double aisles, or additional rows of chapels between the buttresses as at [[Notre Dame, Paris]], the transept does not project beyond the aisles (See plan).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In English cathedrals, transepts tend to project boldly and there may be two of them, as at Salisbury and [[Lincoln Cathedral]]s. The double transepts are to provide extra chapels, in lieu of the apsidal chapels found in French cathedrals (See Salisbury plan).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe eastern arm shows considerable diversity. In France and Germany, the eastern end is generally polygonal and surrounded by a continuation of the choir aisle called an [[ambulatory]]. Surrounding the ambulatory may be a ring of chapels called a \"[[chevet]]\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England the eastern arm is generally long and may have two distinct sections- choir and presbytery.

This term, used architecturally, does not have any ecclesiastical or spiritual significance such as is associated with Catholic basilicas that have been designated by the pope as a church of great significance, e.g. the [[Basilica of St Peter]], in Rome, or the [[Rosary Basilica|Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary]] at Lourdes. (see [[Papal Basilica]] and [[Minor Basilica]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nArchitecturally, a basilica is a church that has a longitudinal nave, with a lower aisle on each side, separated by rows of columns or piers, and generally with windows let into that part of the nave that rises above the outer roof of the aisles. This upper section is called the [[clerestory]]. This architectural form is so named because it was commonly used by ancient Roman builders as the structure for secular [[Basilica|basilicas]] used as halls for meetings, markets and as places of justice. Early Christian churches such as [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], Rome, and [[San Apollinare in Classe]] have this form, which was adopted by Romanesque builders for their great abbeys and cathedrals, across Europe, such as Durham Cathedral, Saint-Etienne, Caen, and Monreale Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nDuring the Gothic period, most cathedrals were built with a single aisle on each side of the nave, such as Salisbury Cathedral, but some had double aisles with the outer lower than the inner, such as Bourges Cathedral. In the South of France cathedrals are sometimes just a single high, wide hall, with tall windows but no aisles, and the lower stage giving a robust fortified appearance, such as [[Albi Cathedral]]. Gothic churches of the Germanic tradition, like [[Stephansdom (Vienna)|St. Stephen of Vienna]], often have nave and aisles of similar height, without clerestory, and are called ''[[Hall church|Hallenkirche]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nInternally, the nave and choir are usually divided horizontally into three stages, the arcade, the triforium gallery and the clerestorey.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This arrangement is usual in England where it can be seen at Salisbury, Lincoln, and Ely.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn some French Cathedrals, such as Laon and the nave of Rouen, there is a fourth stage, a shallow tribune gallery between the triforium and the clerestory.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In the transepts of Notre Dame, the wall above the triforium gallery is pierced with rose windows. In later Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches, the vertical members in the tracery of galleries and clerestory may merge into a single decorative unit where the stages are present but not clearly defined, as at Saint Ouen at Rouen and the choir of Gloucester Cathedral in England. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn the Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches of Italy, triforium galleries are most often found in churches influenced by the architecture of Normandy, and were used at abbeys of women, as a space for the nuns to attend services.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Elsewhere, many churches such as Florence Cathedral and the Abbey Church of Santa Maria Novella, had an interior elevation of two stages, the arcade and clerestory. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = French Gothic elevations\n | image1    = Notre Dame 531 transverse crop rot.jpg\n | width1    = 200\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Notre Dame de Paris, showing the nave and double aisles; vault and flying buttresses.\n | image2    =Vue.interieure.travee.cathedrale.Paris.png\n | width2    = 183\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Notre Dame de Paris.

One of the best known and most typical of such west fronts is that of Notre Dame de Paris.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} To emphasise its importance, the west front may be of a powerful design, with towers, imposing portals, jutting buttresses, gables, windows and an array of sculpture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nCentral to the west front is the main portal, often flanked by additional doors, after the manner of Suger's west front at the Basilica of Saint Denis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} In England, the lateral doors may be present but relatively insignificant. In the arch of the central door, particularly in France, the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], is often a significant piece of sculpture, most frequently ''Christ in Majesty'' or ''the [[Last Judgment]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} If there is a central doorjamb or a [[Trumeau (architecture)|trumeau]], then it frequently bears a statue of Jesus or the ''Madonna and Child'' if the dedication is to Mary.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Figures in niches set into the mouldings around the portals.  \n\nAbove the main portal there is a large window which lights the nave.

[[Chartres Cathedral]] has two on the western towers, of different dates and very different construction.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} That on the south is the tallest masonry spire of the 12th century, while that on the north is a highly elaborate Flamboyant design.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The irregularity seen at Chartres also occurs at Rouen where there is a central tower in addition to the western towers.

These include the octagonal tower at Burgos Cathedral, the wooden octagonal tower at Ely Cathedral and the octagonal dome of Florence Cathedral, conceived in the late Gothic period and engineered by the Renaissance architect, Filippo Brunelleschi.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Towers and spires\n\n | image1    = Cathedrale laon facade 2012.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Laon Cathedral- the strongly articulated towers of the west front. \n\n | image2    = Facade cathedral.jpg\n | width2    = 150\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Chartres Cathedral- C12th masonry spire, and Flamboyant spire \n\n | image3    = Canterbury-15.jpg\n | width3    = 167\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Canterbury Cathedral - the large tower over the crossing \n\n | image4    = Rouen Cathedral as seen from Gros Horloge 140215 4.jpg\n | width4    = 140\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Rouen Cathedral- three different towers and a lead-covered fleche\n\n | image5    = Spire Cathedral St Stephen Vienna Wien Steffl 1.jpg\n | width5    = 137\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = St Stephan's Cathedral, Vienna- openwork stone spire \n\n | image6    = Lichfield Cathedral.jpg\n | width6    = 167\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = Lichfield Cathedral- three masonry spires, the central being taller. \n\n | image7    = 26-Ely-004.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Ely Cathedral- the wooden octagon rises from an octagonal stone tower\n\n | image8    = Badia Fiorentina from Palazzo Vecchio n01.jpg\n | width8    = 150\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  = Badia Fiorentina, Florence- tall campanile with spire\n }}\n\n===Portals and the tympanum=== \n<!---\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Saint Denis PM 086190 F.jpg|North portal of [[Basilica of St Denis]], with early [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] and columns made of elongated figures (1135\u20131140)\nFile:Amiens cathedral Tympanumt.JPG|Day of Judgement [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] at [[Amiens Cathedral]] (1220\u20131270), the prototype for other high Gothic portals.\nFile:Frontispice cath\u00e9drale Strasbourg.JPG|Portals and tympanum of [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] (Begun 1176)\nFile:WestminsterNorth55.jpg|[[Westminster Abbey]] north portal (begun 1245)\n</gallery> --->\n\nEarly Gothic Cathedrals traditionally have their main entrance at the western end of the church, opposite the choir.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Based on the model of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] and [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], there are usually three doorways with pointed arches.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} During the Romanesque period cathedral and abbey portals were enriched by sculpture, and a carved figure often occupied the central jamb of the door.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The main pictorial representation occupied the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], the panel between the arch and the lintel of the door.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The subject was usually the [[Last Judgement]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This arrangement continued into the Gothic era.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nOne of the earliest portals of the Gothic period was that at Chartres Cathedral, where the three portals of the west front show three different aspects of the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} At Amiens, the tympanum over the central portal depicted the [[Last Judgement]], the right portal showed the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], and the left portal showed the lives of saints who were important in the diocese.

The increasing height of cathedrals over the Gothic period was accompanied by an increasing proportion of the wall devoted to windows, until, by the late Gothic, the interiors became like cages of glass. This was made possible by the development of the flying buttress, which transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof to the supports outside the walls. As a result, the walls gradually became thinner and higher, and masonry was replaced with glass. The four-part elevation of the naves of early Cathedrals such as Notre-Dame (arcade, tribune, triforium, claire-voie) was transformed in the choir of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] to very tall arcades, a thin triforium, and soaring windows up to the roof.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nBeauvais Cathedral reached the limit of what was possible with Gothic technology. A portion of the choir collapsed in 1284, causing alarm in all of the cities with very tall cathedrals. Panels of experts were created in Sienna and Chartres to study the stability of those structures.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=86}} Only the transept and choir of Beauvais were completed, and in the 21st century, the transept walls were reinforced with cross-beams. No cathedral built since exceeded the height of the choir of Beauvais.{{Sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nA section of the main body of a Gothic church usually shows the [[nave]] as considerably taller than it is wide. In England, the proportion is sometimes greater than 2:1, while the greatest proportional difference achieved is at [[Cologne Cathedral]] with a ratio of 3.6:1. The highest internal vault is at Beauvais Cathedral at {{convert|48|m|ft}}.<ref name=BF/> --->\n\n====Vertical emphasis====\nThe pointed arch lends itself to a suggestion of height. This appearance is characteristically further enhanced by both the architectural features and the decoration of the building.<ref name=Swaan/>{{Page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn the exterior, the verticality is emphasised in a major way by the towers and spires and in a lesser way by strongly projecting vertical buttresses, by narrow half-columns called ''attached shafts'' which often pass through several storeys of the building, by long narrow windows, vertical mouldings around doors and figurative sculpture which emphasises the vertical and is often attenuated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The roof-line, gable ends, buttresses and other parts of the building are often terminated by small pinnacles, [[Milan Cathedral]] being an extreme example in the use of this form of decoration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn the interior of the building attached shafts often sweep unbroken from floor to ceiling and meet the ribs of the vault, like a tall tree spreading into branches. The verticals are generally repeated in the treatment of the windows and wall surfaces. In many Gothic churches, particularly in France, and in the ''Perpendicular period'' of [[English Gothic architecture]], the treatment of vertical elements in gallery and window tracery creates a strongly unifying feature that counteracts the horizontal divisions of the interior structure.<ref name=Swaan/>{{Page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Vertical elements\n | image1    = Reims - 2013-08-27 - IMG 2265.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = West front of Reims Cathedral \n\n | image2    = Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre de Beauvais ext 106.JPG\n | width2    = 167\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The exterior of the choir of Beauvais Cathedral \n\n | image3    = Cenral tympanum Chartres.jpg\n | width3    = 150\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Figures around the central door of Chartres Cathedral \n | image4    = The Five Sisters - geograph.org.uk - 770345.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The Five Sister windows in the north transept at York Minster\n | image5    = PM 103594 F Bourges.jpg\n | width5    = 150\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  =  A clustered column of the nave at Bourges Cathedral  \n | image6    = Koelner dom nordseite des chors.jpg\n | width6    = 167\n | alt6      = \n | caption6  = Vertical elements in the galleries at Cologne Cathedral \n | image7    =Koelner dom blick nach osten.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = The buttresses pinnacles of the choir at Cologne Cathedral \n\n }}\n\n===Light===\nExpansive interior light has been a feature of Gothic cathedrals since the first structure was opened.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The metaphysics of light in the Middle Ages led to clerical belief in its divinity and the importance of its display in holy settings. Much of this belief was based on the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a sixth-century mystic whose book {{Lang-la|[[De Coelesti Hierarchia]]|label=none}} was popular among monks in France.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Pseudo-Dionysius held that all light, even light reflected from metals or streamed through windows, was divine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} To promote such faith, the abbot in charge of the Saint-Denis church on the north edge of Paris, the [[Abbot Suger]], encouraged architects remodelling the building to make the interior as bright as possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nEver since the remodelled [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] opened in 1144, Gothic architecture has featured expansive windows, such as at [[Sainte-Chapelle]], [[York Minster]], [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. The increase in size between windows of the Romanesque and Gothic periods is related to the use of the ribbed vault, and in particular, the pointed ribbed vault which channelled the weight to a supporting shaft with less outward thrust than a semi-circular vault. Walls did not need to be so weighty.<ref name=NP/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=Swaan/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nA further development was the flying buttress which arched externally from the springing of the vault across the roof of the aisle to a large buttress pier projecting well beyond the line of the external wall.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} These piers were often surmounted by a [[pinnacle]] or [[statue]], further adding to the downward weight, and counteracting the outward thrust of the vault and buttress arch as well as stress from wind loading.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe internal columns of the arcade with their attached shafts, the ribs of the vault and the flying buttresses, with their associated vertical buttresses jutting at right-angles to the building, created a stone skeleton. Between these parts, the walls and the infill of the vaults could be of lighter construction. Between the narrow buttresses, the walls could be opened up into large windows.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThrough the Gothic period, thanks to the versatility of the pointed arch, the structure of Gothic windows developed from simple openings to immensely rich and decorative sculptural designs. The windows were very often filled with [[stained glass]] which added a dimension of colour to the light within the building, as well as providing a medium for figurative and narrative art.<ref name=Swaan/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Light\n | image1    =  Flying buttresses of Notre-Dame de Strasbourg.jpg\n | width1    = 185\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Large clerestory windows between flying buttresses at Strasbourg\n | image2    = Lyon 5 - Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Jean 03.jpg\n | width2    = 185\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Tall windows lighting the vault at [[Lyon Cathedral]], made possible by flying buttresses\n | image3    = Chapter House, Wells Cathedral 9 (9317650737).jpg\n | width3    = 185\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Windows in a polygonal arrangement, Lady Chapel, Wells Cathedral\n | image4    = Rouen (24748511178).jpg \n | width4    = 185\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Tall windows in the aisle at Rouen, with additional windows in the triforium   \n | image5    = York Minster, York (14047415195).jpg\n | width5    = 185\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = \"Heart of Yorkshire\" window at York Minster, the scale of most west windows in England. \n | image6    = Paris 2019 (31878003887).jpg\n | width6    = 185\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The array of glass between thin stone mullions, [[Sainte-Chapelle]], Paris\n }}\n\n\n\n==Evolving styles== \nBetween the dedication of the choir at the Abbey of St Denis, Paris, in 1144 and the completion of [[Henry VII's Chapel]] at Westminster Abbey in 1519, there were nearly 400 years of stylistic development in Gothic architecture. Nowhere was this more manifest that in the building of cathedrals and the great churches of abbeys, colleges and prosperous towns.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}  \n\nWhile the plan and elevation of the various types of Gothic ecclesiastical architecture remained consistently linked to purpose and to regional preferences, all the other elements developed, generally towards greater complexity, over the decades.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The piers, the arcades, the galleries, the vaults and the portals, all evolved. The evolution was largely linked to and dependent upon the structural and ornamental flexibility of the pointed arch.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThis development is traditionally divided into periods or styles according to the system of the 19th century French archaeologist [[Arcisse de Caumont]].<ref>Banister Fletcher, 17th edition, p. 534</ref> The periods are generally called Early Gothic (1137-1180), High Gothic (1180-1230), Rayonnant Gothic (1230-1350 and Flamboyant Gothic (1350-1530). These terms apply to the Gothic architecture of France and to those countries where the influence of French Gothic spread. These styles did not, however, progress at the same rate, or in the same way in every country.\n\nIn England, the reconstruction of Westminster Abbey and the east end of Canterbury Cathedral were both influenced by French Gothic, with the architect at Canterbury being [[William of Sens]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Wells Cathedral, however, takes a completely different direction to French Gothic, introducing an unprecedented use of fluted mouldings, and other decorative innovations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Salisbury Cathedral and the nave of Lincoln are also very different to the French prototypes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Hence, the styles of English Gothic are referred to as Early English (or Lancet) Gothic (c. 1180\u20131275), Geometric Decorated and Flamboyant Decorated Gothic, (c. 1275\u20131380); and Perpendicular Gothic, (c. 1380\u20131520), after the system proposed by [[Thomas Rickman]].<ref>Thomas Rickman,  ''Attempt to Discriminate the Style of Architecture in England'' (1812\u201315) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nOne of the indicators of style is the nature of the windows and doors, and their decorative treatment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This is strongly associated with and affected by the type of arches used within the particular building. \nThe Gothic styles, Lancet, Geometric, Rayonnant, Flamboyant and Perpendicular, affected all the various forms of architectonic decoration within the church - arcading, niches, shrines, wooden panelling, furniture of all sorts, reliquaries, vessels, and vestments.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Gothic styles\n | image1    = 0 Soissons - Nef et ch\u0153ur de la cath\u00e9drale Saint-Gervais-et-Saint-Protais (1).JPG\n | width1    = 244\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Early Gothic at Soissons Cathedral, France\n | image2    = 06-Lincoln-049.jpg\n | width2    = 220\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Geometric Gothic at Lincoln Cathedral, England\n | image3    = Auxerre Cath\u00e9drale St. \u00c9tienne Innen Langhaus West 2.jpg\n | width3    = 240\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Rayonnant Gothic at Auxerre Cathedral, France\n | image4    = 68532-Salamanca (49093734597).jpg\n | width4    = 240\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Flamboyant Gothic at Salamanca Cathedral, Spain \n | image5    = Gloucester Cathedral High Altar, Gloucestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg\n | width5    = 208\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Perpndicular Gothic at Gloucester, England\n }} \n\n\n===Arches, windows and tracery===\n====Early or Lancet Gothic====\nThe simplest shape of a Gothic window is a long opening with a pointed arch known in England as the lancet. Lancet windows may be used singly, as in the nave of Lincoln Cathedral, or grouped, as in the nave of Salisbury Cathedral where they are in two in the aisles and threes in the clerestory. Because large lancet windows, such as those lighting the aisles of a cathedral, may be wide in comparison to a single light in a traceried window, they often have armatures of wood or iron to support the glass. The arch of a lancet opening is often equilateral, but sometimes is much more acute, and when employed in the arcade of a choir apse, such as at Westminster Abbey, adds to the emphasis of height.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThe simple shape of the lancet arch may appear in Early Gothic buildings on openings of all types, doorways, niches, arcades, including galleries; and belfry openings.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\nThe use of lancet windows is found in the Early Gothic architecture of France, at the Abbey of St Denis, Sens and [[Senlis Cathedral]]s. At Chartres and Laon Cathedrals lancet windows are grouped beneath the rose windows. Tall narrow lancets are also found in radiating groups in the chancel apses of some cathedrals, such as Chartres.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} It is common in France for lancet windows to be used in smaller, narrower spaces, such as the chapels of a chevet, while traceries windows are used in the clerestory.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}  \n\nThe style Lancet Gothic is known in England as Early English Gothic, with Salisbury Cathedral being the prime example. [[York Minster]] has a group of lancet windows each fifty feet high and still containing ancient glass. They are known as the Five Sisters. <ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} Wells Cathedral is notable for the continuous rows of lancet openings that make up the triforiun galleries. \nLancet windows are used extensively in the Gothic churches of Italy, including Florence Cathedral and in the [[Brick Gothic]] churches of Germany and Poland.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\n====Geometric Gothic (England)====\nThe Equilateral Arch lends itself to filling with tracery of simple equilateral, circular and semi-circular forms. In France, windows of clerestorys, and other larger windows were commonly divided into two lights, with some simple Geometric tracery above, a circle or a cinquefoil or sexfoil. This style of window remained popular without great change until after 1300.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn England there was a much greater variation in the design of tracery that evolved to fill these spaces. The style is known as Geometric Decorated Gothic and can be seen to splendid effect at many English cathedrals and abbey churches, where both the eastern and the western terminations of the building may be occupied by a single large window such as the east window at Lincoln and the west window at Worcester Cathedral. Windows of complex design and of three or more ''lights'' or vertical sections, are often designed by overlapping two or more equilateral arches springing from the vertical mullions.<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n====Rayonnant Gothic====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nRayonnant Gothic is the term used particularly to described the style that produced the great rose windows of France. These windows deck not only the west fronts of cathedrals, but often, as at Notre Dame de Paris, the transept gables as well. It is common that although the transepts of French Cathedrals do not project strongly, they are given visual importance almost equal to the west front, including large decorated portals and a rose window. Particularly fine examples are at Notre Dame and Chartres Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n====Flamboyant Gothic====\nThe [[Flamboyant]] Arch is one that is drafted from four points, the upper part of each main arc turning upwards into a smaller arc and meeting at a sharp, flame-like point. These arches create a rich and lively effect when used for window tracery and surface decoration. The form is structurally weak and has very rarely been used for large openings except when contained within a larger and more stable arch.

It can be seen at [[St Stephen's Vienna]], [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris, at the Cathedrals of [[Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Limoges|Limoges]] and [[Rouen Cathedral|Rouen]] in France. In England the most famous examples are the West Window of [[York Minster]] with its design based on the [[Sacred Heart]], the extraordinarily rich nine-light East Window at [[Carlisle Cathedral]] and the exquisite East window of [[Selby Abbey]].<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=NP/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDoorways surmounted by Flamboyant mouldings are very common in both ecclesiastical and domestic architecture in France.

A notable example is the doorway to the Chapter Room at [[Rochester Cathedral]].<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe style was much used in England for wall arcading and niches. Prime examples in are in the Lady Chapel at [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], the Screen at [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and externally on the fa\u00e7ade of [[Exeter Cathedral]]. In German and Spanish Gothic architecture it often appears as openwork screens on the exterior of buildings. The style was used to rich and sometimes extraordinary effect in both these countries, notably on the famous pulpit in [[Vienna Cathedral]].<ref name=JH1/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Perpendicular Gothic (England)====\nThe depressed or [[four-centred arch]] is much wider than its height and gives the visual effect of having been flattened under pressure. Its structure is achieved by drafting two arcs which rise steeply from each springing point on a small [[radius]] and then turn into two arches with a wide radius and much lower springing point.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThis type of arch, when employed as a window opening, lends itself to very wide spaces, provided it is adequately supported by many narrow vertical shafts. These are often further braced by horizontal transoms. The overall effect produces a grid-like appearance of regular, delicate, rectangular forms with an emphasis on the perpendicular. It is also employed as a wall decoration in which arcade and window openings form part of the whole decorative surface.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe style, known as [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular]], that evolved from this treatment is specific to England, although very similar to contemporary Spanish style in particular, and was employed to great effect through the 15th century and first half of the 16th as Renaissance styles were much slower to arrive in England than in Italy and France.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt can be seen notably at the East End of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] where the East Window is said to be as large as a tennis court.

Columns of this type were used at the Abbey of St Denis, at Sens, at Notre Dame and at Canterbury in England. In buildings with sexpartite vaults, they sometimes alternated with piers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn the [[Brabantine Gothic architecture]] of the Holland and Belgium, columns remained part of the style into the 15th century, and have capitals of cabbage leaf foliage.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn France, the column developed in complexity by having a cluster of circular shafts grouped around the central circular core. This is seen a Reims, Amiens and Bourges Cathedrals, and also at Westminster Abbey and Salisbury Cathedral and in Spain at Burgos Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThe rectangular piers also developed, with attached shafts and mouldings which continue up the wall to support the vault, or into the decorative mouldings of the chancel arch, in a manner that had previously been utilised to decorate the arches of Romanesque portals. The eastern end of the Abbey of Saint Etienne, Caen, was rebuilt from 1166, with clustered piers. From 1176, Wells Cathedral was constructed with clustered piers throughout. Between the two buildings there is a great difference in the handling of the two. At Caen, the pier remains a decorated rectangular pier, set parallel to the wall surface. The shafts themselves maintain a circular, and classicising form. At Well, the core of the pier appears to have been rotated, and become a lozenge, angle-on to the lie of the arcade. The clusters of shafts are fluting. The capitals are of what is know as \"stiff-leaf\" foliage, and has a vitality of form different to any other foliage carving of that date.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nComplex clustered columns and fluted and shafted piers were subsequently widely adopted, and became part of the vertical visual character of Gothic cathedrals.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Columns and piers\n | image1    = Vue du choeur de la cath\u00e9drale.JPG\n | width1    = 197\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Corinthian columns in the choir at Rouen Cathedral\n | image2    = PM 103631 F Bourges.jpg\n | width2    = 175\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Tall columns with clusters of shafts, Bourges Cathedral \n | image3    = Salisbury 9978.jpg \n | width3    = 175\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  =  Columns in the nave of Salisbury Cathedral\n | image4    =  Wells Cathedral (St. Andrew) (16466400434).jpg\n | width4    = 175\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Fluted piers with Stiff Leaf capitals at Wells Cathedral\n | image5    = Seville Cathedral (6931811902).jpg\n | width5    = 175\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Very tall fluted piers at [[Seville Cathedral]], Spain\n  }}\n\n===Developments in ribbed vaulting===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}In France the vaults over the high spaces of nave and clerestory, in the Early Gothic period, was sexpartite, spanning two bays of the nave. This resulted in the vaulted space being almost square, and to diagoal ribs being semi-circular. Only the arches of the transverse ribs were pointed. This is the case at Sens, at Notre Dame de Paris and the Nave of Laon Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nAt Chartres Cathedral, and the choir of Laon Cathedral, however, the vault is in four parts, spans a single bay, is rectangular, and all the ribs are pointed. The quadripartite proved much easier to build because it required less centring. It is also stronger as the compartments are smaller. The quadripartite vault is used in the Early English cathedrals of Salisbury and Wells. It became the standard form of vault which leant itself to further development and elaboration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn the nave of Lincoln Cathedral the vault acquired extra ribs known as \"tiercerons\" which meet at a central \"ridge rib\" running the length of the nave. An additional elaboration, to span the wide nave, was the introduction of intermediate ribs which do not reach the centre of the vault, but join two small \"lierne\" ribs projecting from the ridge. Other cathedrals with tierceron vaulting are Norwich, and Exeter.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nLierne ribs became a feature of later Gothic design, as at [[Bristol Cathedral]] and led the way to elaborate patterns within the vault, including net or \"reticular\" vaulting and \"stellar\" vaulting. Stellar vaulting was particularly fashionable in Germany, Eastern Europe and Spain. The use of short ribs lent itself to the introduction of curved and ogee shaped ribs, in the Flamboyant style. Flamboynt vaulting is particularly prevalent in Spain.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\nIn England there are a number of chapter house, notably at Wells, Lincoln and Westminster abbey, where the vault is supported by a single central column from which many ribs radiate in every direction like a palm tree. This also occurs at the high vault behind the altar at [[Jacobins Church]], Toulouse, in France.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nA further development was many shallow ribs radiating in a fan shape, so that visually, the appearance of the structural ribs is minimised, and the emphasis is upon the curving surfaces. These fan vaults were used successfully for narrower and lower structures such as the cloister at Gloucester Cathedral and the retrochoir at Peterborough, before being employed on the high vaults at the Chapel of Kings College Cambridge, and even even more elaborate form with pendant lanterns attached, at Henry VII's Chapel at Westminster Abbey.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Style- Ribbed vaults\n | image1    = B\u00f3veda de catedral de Notre Dame de Par\u00eds 3.jpg\n | width1    = 144\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Notre Dame, Paris- square, sexpartite vaults spanning two nave bays\n | image2    = Salisbury Cathedral Interior 01.jpg\n | width2    = 162\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Salisbury Cathedral, England- rectangular quadripartite vault over single bay\n | image3    = Lincoln cathedral 13 Nave vault.jpg\n | width3    = 162\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Lincoln Cathedral, England- quadripartite form, with tierceron ribs and ridge rib with carved bosses. \n | image4    = \n | width4    = 155\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  =   \n | image5    = Bremer Dom Juli 2009 PD 060.JPG\n | width5    = 144\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Bremer Cathedral, Germany- north aisle, a reticular (net) vault with intersecting ribs. \n | image6    = Wolfsberg Sankt Marein Pfarrkirche Mariae Himmelfahrt Netzrippengewoelbe 03092014 742.jpg\n | width6    = 144\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = St Marien's, Wolfsberg, Austria- stellar vault with intersecting lierne ribs.  \n | image7    = B\u00f3vedas catedral Salamanca 40.jpg\n | width7    = 162\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Salamanca Cathedral, Spain- vault has Flamboyant S-shaped and circular lierne ribs, \n | image8    = Peterborough Retrochoir fan vaulting.JPG\n | width8    = 160\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  = Peterborough Cathedral retrochoir- fan vaulting, which further evolved into pemdant vaulting. \n }}\n\n<!---\n===Early Gothic architectural elements, 1137-1180 ===  \n\nThese elements are those to be found in the earliest Gothic buildings of France, Abbey, of St Denis, Sens Cathedral, Senlis Cathedral, Noyon Cathedral, and also affected the rebuilding of the choir at Canterbury in Kent, England, after a fire in 1174. \n\n* Pointed arches, often of equilateral projection \n* Continued use of semi-circular arches in conjunction with pointed arches e.g. in vaulting ribs \n* Ribbed vaulting\n* Nave vault sexpartite, spanning two bays \n* Quadripartite ailse vaults, trapezoid where necessary\n* Cylindrical columns, with simplified Corinthian capitals;

Historians including [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]], Focillon, Aubert, and [[Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] contended that this is one of the most universal features of the Gothic style.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=20}}\n\nReligious teachings in the Middle Ages, particularly the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a 6th-century mystic whose book, ''[[De Coelesti Hierarchia]]'', was popular among monks in France, taught that all light was divine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} When the Abbot [[Suger]] ordered the reconstruction of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]], he instructed that the windows in the choir admit as much light as possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nMany earlier Romanesque churches had stained glass windows, and many had round windows, called ''oculi'', but these windows were necessarily small, due to the thickness of the walls. The primary interior decorations of Romanesque cathedrals were painted murals. In the Gothic period, the improvements in rib vaults and flying buttresses allowed cathedral walls to be higher, thinner and stronger, and windows were consequently considerably larger, The windows of churches in the late Gothic period, such as [[Sainte Chapelle]] in Paris, filled the entire wall between the ribs of stone. Enormous windows were also an important element of [[York Minster]] and [[Gloucester Cathedral]].<ref name=Swaan/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe main threat to cathedral windows was the wind; frames had to be extremely strong. The early windows were fit into openings cut into the stone. The small pieces of coloured glass were joined together with pieces of lead, and then their surfaces were painted with faces and other details. and then the windows were mounted in the stone frames. Thin vertical and horizontal bars of iron, called ''vergettes'' or ''barlotierres'', were placed inside the window to reinforce the glass.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe stories told in the glass were usually episodes from the [[Bible]], but they also sometimes illustrated the professions of the guilds which had funded the windows, such as the drapers, stonemasons or the barrel-makers.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\nMuch of the stained glass in Gothic cathedrals today dates from later restorations, but a few cathedrals, notably [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Bourges Cathedral]], still have many of their original windows.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\n===Sculpture and decoration===\n\nThe exteriors and interiors of Gothic cathedrals, particularly in France, were lavishly ornamented with sculpture and decoration on religious themes, designed for the great majority of parishioners who could not read. They were described as \"Books for the poor.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} To add to the effect, all of the sculpture on the facades was originally painted and gilded.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Viollet-le-Duc, Eug\u00e9ne, ''Dictionnaire Raisonn\u00e9 de l'architecture Fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVI siecle'', Volume 6.

The main portals at [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], for instance, represented the entrance to paradise, with the [[Last Judgement]] depicted on the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the doors, showing Christ surrounded by the apostles, and by the signs of the zodiac, representing the movements of the heavens. The columns below the tympanum are in the form of statues of saints, literally reprinting them as \"the pillars of the church.\"{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}} Each Saint had his own symbol: a winged lion stood for [[Saint Mark]], an eagle with four wings meant [[Saint John the Apostle]], and a winged bull symbolized [[Saint Luke]]. Sculpted angels had specific functions, sometimes as heralds, blowing trumpets, or holding up columns, as guardian angels; or holding crowns of thorns or crosses, as symbols of the crucifixion of Christ, or waving a container with incense, to illustrate their function at the throne of God. Floral and vegetal decoration was also very common, representing the [[Garden of Eden]]; grapes represented the wines of [[Eucharist]].{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}}\n\nThe [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the central portal on the west facade of Notre-Dame de Paris vividly illustrates the Last Judgement, with figures of sinners being led off to hell, and good Christians taken to heaven. The sculpture of the right portal shows the coronation of the [[Virgin Mary]], and the left portal shows the lives of saints who were important to Parisians, particularly [[Saint Anne]], the mother of the Virgin Mary.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=35}}\n\nThe exteriors of cathedrals and other Gothic churches were also decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[Grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters. These included the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], a mythical hybrid creature which usually had the body of a lion and the head of a goat, and the [[Strix (mythology)|strix]] or stryge, a creature resembling an [[owl]] or [[bat]], which was said to eat human flesh. The strix appeared in classical Roman literature; it was described by the Roman poet [[Ovid]], who was widely read in the Middle Ages, as a large-headed bird with transfixed eyes, rapacious beak, and greyish white wings.<ref name=fasti>Frazer, James George (1933) ed., Ovid, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi007.perseus-lat1:6 ''Fasti''] VI. 131\u2013,{{harvp|Riley|1851|p=216}}, tr.</ref> They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshippers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=97\u201399}}\n\nThe [[gargoyle]]s, which were added to Notre-Dame in about 1240, had a more practical purpose. They were the rain spouts of the cathedral, designed to divide the torrent of water which poured from the roof after rain, and to project it outwards as far as possible from the buttresses and the walls and windows so that it would not erode the mortar binding the stone. To produce many thin streams rather than a torrent of water, a large number of gargoyles were used, so they were also designed to be a decorative element of the architecture. The rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses, then along a channel cut in the back of the gargoyle and out of the mouth away from the cathedral.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nMany of the statues, particularly the grotesques, were removed from the facade in the 17th and 18th century, or were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} They were replaced with figures in the Gothic style, designed by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]] during the 19th-century restoration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Similar figures appear on the other Gothic cathedrals of France.\n\nAnother common feature of Gothic cathedrals in France was a [[labyrinth]] or maze on the floor of the nave near the choir, which symbolized the difficult and often complicated journey of a Christian life before attaining paradise. Most labyrinths were removed by the 18th century, but a few, like the one at [[Amiens Cathedral]], have been reconstructed, and the labyrinth at [[Chartres Cathedral]] still exists essentially in its original form.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=99\u2013100}}\n\n==Synagogues==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"175\">\nFile:Blick von der Gartenseite der Synagoge Worms.jpg|Romanesque [[Worms Synagogue]] from the 11th century with Gothic windows (after 1355)\nFile:Scolanova Synagogue.jpg|[[Scolanova Synagogue]], [[Trani]] (1247)\nFile:20190204 OldSynagoga 3715 (33586950518).jpg|[[Old New Synagogue]], [[Prague]] (c. 1270)\nFile:Altneusynagoge - Portal.jpg|Main portal of the Old New Synagogue, Prague (c. 1270)\nFile:Erfurt Alte Synagoge 688.jpg|[[Old Synagogue (Erfurt)|Old Synagogue]], [[Erfurt]] (c. 1270)\nFile:Praha Pinkas Synagogue Interior 02.jpg|Late Gothic vaulting of [[Pinkas Synagogue]], Prague (1535)\nFile:Krakow Old Synagogue G21.jpg|Renaissance interior of the [[Old Synagogue in Krakow|Old Synagogue]] in [[Krak\u00f3w|Cracow]] using Gothic vaults (1570)\n</gallery>\n\nAlthough Christianity played a dominant role in the Gothic sacred architecture, Jewish communities were present in many European cities during the Middle Ages and they also built their [[Synagogue|houses of prayer]] in the Gothic style.

The new fortifications were more geometric, usually square, with a high main ''donjon'' or tower, in the centre, which could be defended even if the walls of the castle were captured. The Donjon of the [[Chateau de Vincennes]], begun by [[Philip VI of France]], was a good example. It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other. The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''cr\u00e9neaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings (''[[merlon]]s'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''[[Machicolation|m\u00e2chicoulis]]''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''[[Bartizan|\u00e9chauguettes]]'' and ''[[bret\u00e8che]]s'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below. In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''[[Arrowslit|meurtri\u00e8res]]'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbal\u00e8tes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=66\u201367}}\n\nCastles were surrounded by a deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge.

The largest new church, [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]] (1532\u20131560), rivalled Notre-Dame in size, 105 meters long, 44 meters wide, and 35 meters high.

The appeal of this [[Gothic revival]] (which after 1837, in Britain, is sometimes termed [[Victorian Gothic]]), gradually widened to encompass \"low church\" as well as \"high church\" clients. This period of more universal appeal, spanning 1855\u20131885, is known in Britain as [[High Victorian Gothic]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in London by Sir [[Charles Barry]] with interiors by a major exponent of the early Gothic Revival, [[Augustus Welby Pugin]], is an example of the Gothic revival style from its earlier period in the second quarter of the 19th century. Examples from the ''High Victorian Gothic'' period include [[George Gilbert Scott]]'s design for the [[Albert Memorial]] in London, and [[William Butterfield]]'s chapel at [[Keble College, Oxford]]. From the second half of the 19th century onwards, it became more common in Britain for neo-Gothic to be used in the design of non-ecclesiastical and non-governmental buildings types. Gothic details even began to appear in working-class housing schemes subsidised by philanthropy, though given the expense, less frequently than in the design of upper and middle-class housing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe middle of the 19th century was a period marked by the restoration, and in some cases modification, of ancient monuments and the construction of neo-Gothic edifices such as the nave of [[Cologne Cathedral]] and the [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clotilde]] of [[Paris]] as speculation of mediaeval architecture turned to technical consideration.

The plan of the Gothic cathedral was based upon the plan of the ancient Roman [[basilica]], which was adopted by Romanesque architecture. The [[Latin cross]] form, with a [[nave]] and transept, choir, disambulatory, and radiating chapels, came from the Romanesque model. The grand arcades of columns separating the central vessel of the [[nave]] from the collateral aisles, the [[triforium]] over the grand arcades, and the windows high on the walls allowing light into the nave were all also adapted from the Romanesque model. The portal with a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] filled with sculpture was another characteristic Romanesque feature, as was the use of the buttress to support the walls from the outside. Gothic architects improved them by adding the [[flying buttress]] with high arches connecting the buttresses to the upper walls. In the interior, Romanesque architecture used the [[barrel vault]] with a round arch to cover the nave, and a [[groin vault]] when two barrel vaults met at right angles. These vaults were the immediate ancestors of the Gothic rib vault. The first use of the Gothic rib vaults to cover a nave was in the Romanesque [[Durham Cathedral]], (1093\u20131104).<ref name=\"auto\">Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2018), pp. 35-37</ref>\n\n[[Norman Architecture]], similar to the Romanesque style, also influenced the Gothic style. Early examples are found in [[Lessay Abbey]] in Normandy, which also featured early rib vaults in the nave similar to the Gothic vaults. [[Cefalu Cathedral]] (1131\u20131267) in Sicily, built when Sicily was under Norman rule, is another interesting example. It featured pointed arches and large Romanesque vaults combined with ornamental mosaic decoration.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nRomanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as [[Ireland]] and [[Croatia]], and [[Sweden]] and [[Sicily]]. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders did not define divisions of style. Many different factors like geographical/geological, economic, social, or political situations caused the regional differences in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period that would often become even more apparent in the Gothic. For example, studies of the population statistics reveals disparities such as the multitude of churches, abbeys, and cathedrals in northern [[France]] while in more urbanised regions construction activity of a similar scale was reserved to a few important cities. Such an example comes from Roberto L\u00f3pez, wherein the French city of [[Amiens]] was able to fund its architectural projects whereas [[Cologne]] could not because of the economic inequality of the two.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25-26}} This wealth, concentrated in rich monasteries and noble families, would eventually spread certain Italian, Catalan, and Hanseatic bankers.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25}} This would be amended when the economic hardships of the 13th century were no longer felt, allowing [[Normandy]], [[Tuscany]], [[Flanders]], and the southern [[Rhineland]] to enter into competition with France.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=26}} \n\n===Islamic and Armenian influence===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nAl-Ukhaidir Fortess.jpg|[[Al-Ukhaidir Fortress]] (completed 775 AD), Iraq\nJerusalem-2013-Al-Aqsa Mosque 04.jpg|[[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], Jerusalem\nCordoba, la Mezquita - C\u00fapula de la Maqsura.jpg|Vaulted central dome of [[Cordoba Cathedral|Cordoba Mosque-Cathedral]], Spain (784\u2013987 A.D.).

The war left the Company in control of most of India. It began with an invasion of the Maratha territory by British East India Company troops,{{sfn|Bakshi|Ralhan|2007|p=261}} and although the British were outnumbered, the Maratha army was decimated. The troops were led by the [[Governor-General of India|Governor General]] [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Hastings]] (no relation to [[Warren Hastings]], the first governor-general of Bengal) supported by a force under [[Sir Thomas Hislop, 1st Baronet|General Thomas Hislop]]. Operations began against the [[Pindaris]], a band of Muslim mercenaries and Marathas from central India.{{refn|\"Thus, many Pindaris were originally Muslim or Maratha cavalrymen who were disbanded or found Pindari life better than formal military service... Most Pindaris professed to be Muslims, but some could not even repeat the ''kalima'' or Muslim creed nor knew the name of the prophet.\"{{sfn|McEldowney|1966|p=18}}|group=note}}\n\n[[Peshwa]] [[Baji Rao II]]'s forces, supported by those of [[Mudhoji II Bhonsle]] of [[Nagpur]] and [[Holkar|Malharrao Holkar III]] of [[Indore]], rose against the East India Company. Pressure and diplomacy convinced the fourth major Maratha leader, [[Daulat Scindia|Daulatrao Shinde]] of [[Gwalior]], to remain neutral even though he lost control of [[Rajasthan]].\n\nBritish victories were swift, resulting in the breakup of the Maratha Empire and the loss of Maratha independence. The Peshwa was defeated in the battles of [[Battle of Khadki|Khadki]] and [[Battle of Koregaon|Koregaon]]. Several minor battles were fought by the Peshwa's forces to prevent his capture.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|pp=79\u201386}}\n\nThe Peshwa was eventually captured and placed on a small estate at [[Bithur]], near [[Kanpur]]. Most of his territory was annexed and became part of the [[Bombay Presidency]]. The Maharaja of Satara was restored as the ruler of his territory as a [[princely state]]. In 1848 this territory was also annexed by the Bombay Presidency under the [[doctrine of lapse]] policy of [[Lord Dalhousie]]. Bhonsle was defeated in the [[Sitabuldi Fort|battle of Sitabuldi]] and Holkar in the [[battle of Mahidpur]]. The northern portion of Bhonsle's dominions in and around Nagpur, together with the Peshwa's territories in [[Bundelkhand]], were annexed by British India as the [[Saugor and Nerbudda Territories]]. The defeat of the Bhonsle and Holkar also resulted in the acquisition of the Maratha kingdoms of Nagpur and Indore by the British. Along with Gwalior from Shinde and [[Jhansi]] from the Peshwa, all of these territories became princely states acknowledging British control. The British proficiency in Indian war-making was demonstrated through their rapid victories in Khadki, Sitabuldi, Mahidpur, Koregaon, and Satara.{{sfn|Black|2006|p=78}}\n\n==The Marathas and the British==\n[[File:Joppen1907India1805a-21.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of India after the Second Anglo-Maratha War, 1805]]\nThe Maratha Empire which was founded in 1674 by [[Shivaji]] of the [[Bhosle]] dynasty. Common elements among the citizens of Chatrapati Shivaji's Maratha Empire were the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] language, the Hindu religion, a strong sense of belonging, and a national feeling.{{sfn|Subburaj|2000|p=13}} Shivaji led resistance efforts to free the [[Hindus]] from the Mughals and Muslim [[Sultanate of Bijapur]] and established rule of the [[Hindus]]. This kingdom was known as the [[Hindavi Swarajya]] (\"Hindu self-rule\") in the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] language. Shivaji's capital was located at [[Raigad fort|Raigad]]. Chatrapati Shivaji successfully defended his empire from attacks by the [[Mughal Empire]] and his [[Maratha Empire]] went on to defeat and overtake it as the premier power in India within few decades. A key component of the Maratha administration was the council of eight ministers, called the ''[[Ashta Pradhan]]'' (council of eight). The senior-most member of the Ashta Pradhan was called the ''Peshwa'' or the ''Mukhya Pradhan'' (prime minister). {{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Growing British power===\nWhile the Marathas were fighting the Mughals in the early 18th century, the British held small trading posts in [[Mumbai]], [[Madras]] and [[Calcutta]]. The British fortified the naval post of Mumbai after they saw the Marathas defeat the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] at neighbouring [[Vasai]] in May 1739. In an effort to keep the Marathas out of Mumbai, the British sent envoys to negotiate a treaty. The envoys were successful, and a treaty was signed on 12 July 1739 that gave the [[British East India Company]] rights to free trade in Maratha territory.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=1}} In the south, the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] had enlisted the support of the French for his war against the Marathas.{{refn|Meaning \"Administrator of the Realm\", the title of Nizam was specific to the native sovereigns of [[Hyderabad State]], India, since 1719.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=2}}|group=note}} In reaction to this, the Peshwa requested support from the British, but was refused. Unable to see the rising power of the British, the Peshwa set a precedent by seeking their help to solve internal Maratha conflicts.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=2}} Despite the lack of support, the Marathas managed to defeat the Nizam over a period of five years.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=2}}\n\nDuring the period 1750\u20131761, British defeated the French East India Company in India, and by 1793 they were firmly established in [[Bengal]] in the east and [[Madras]] in the south.

They alienated other Hindu rulers such as the Rajputs, the Jats, and the Rohillas, and they failed to diplomatically win over other Muslim leaders.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=4}} A large blow to the Marathas came in their defeat on 14 January 1761 at Panipat against a combined Muslim force that gathered for Jihad (holy battle) led by the Afghan [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]]. An entire generation of Maratha leaders lay dead on the battlefield as a result of that conflict.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=4}} However, between 1761 and 1773, the Marathas regained the lost ground in the north.{{sfn|Sen|1994|pp=4\u20139}}\n\n===Anglo-Maratha relations===\nThe Maratha gains in the north were undone because of the contradictory policies of Holkar and Shinde and the internal disputes in the family of the Peshwa, which culminated in the murder of [[Narayanrao Peshwa]] in 1773.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=9}} Due to this, the Marathas virtually disappeared from north India. [[Raghunathrao]] was ousted from the seat of Peshwa due to continuing internal Maratha rivalries. He sought help from the British, and they signed the [[Treaty of Surat]] with him in March 1775.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=10}} This treaty gave him military assistance in exchange for control of [[Salsette Island]] and [[Bassein Fort]].{{sfn|Sen|1994|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nThe treaty set off discussions amongst the British in India as well as in Europe because of the serious implications of a confrontation with the powerful Marathas.

The foresight of [[Warren Hastings]] was the main reason for the success of the British in the war. He had destroyed the anti-British coalition and created a division between the Shinde, the Bhonsle, and the Peshwa.{{refn|With justifiable pride Hastings wrote to one of his friends on 7 February 1783: \"Indeed, my dear Sir, there have been three or four very critical periods in our affairs in which the existence of the Company and of the British dominion in India lay at my mercy and would have been lost had I coldly attended to the beaten path of duty and avoided personal responsibility. In the redress afforded to the Nizam I drew him to our interests from the most inveterate enmity. In my negotiations with Modajee Boosla ''(sic)'' I preserved these provinces from ravage and obtained evidence of his connections even beyond his own intentions; and I effected a peace and alliance with Madajee Sindhia ''(sic)'' which was in effect a peace with the Maratha State.\"{{sfn|Sen|1994|pp=12\u201313}}|group=note}}\n\nThe Marathas were still in a very strong position when the new Governor General of British controlled territories [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Cornwallis]] arrived in India in 1786.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=17}} After the treaty of Salabai, the British followed a policy of coexistence in the north. The British and the Marathas enjoyed more than two decades of peace, thanks to the diplomacy of [[Nana Phadnavis]], a minister in the court of the 11-year-old [[Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao]]. The situation changed soon after Nana's death in 1800. The power struggle between Holkar and Shinde caused Holkar to attack the Peshwa in [[Pune]] in 1801, since the Peshwa sided with Shinde. The Peshwa [[Baji Rao II]] fled Pune to safety on a British warship. Baji Rao feared loss of his own powers and signed the [[Treaty of Bassein (1802)|treaty of Bassein]]. This made the Peshwa in effect a subsidiary ally of the British.\n\nIn response to the treaty, the Bhonsle and Shinde attacked the British, refusing to accept the betrayal of their sovereignty to the British by the Peshwa. This was the start of the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]] in 1803. Both were defeated by the British, and all Maratha leaders lost large parts of their territory to the British.{{sfn|Schmidt|1995|p=64}}\n\n===The British East India Company===\nThe British had travelled thousands of miles to arrive in India. They studied Indian geography and mastered local languages to deal with the Indians.{{refn|\"Opposed to these were the British who had come all the way from England to establish an empire in India. They had a ''(sic)'' previous experience not only in many European wars, but also in many Indian ones. Whatever they did, they did in a planned manner. No step was taken blindly. Everything was thoroughly discussed and debated upon before it was taken up. The network of their spies spread far and wide.

Nothing was left to chance and guess-work.\"{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=40}}|group=note}} At the time, they were technologically advanced, with superior equipment in several critical areas to that available locally.

The British appointed [[Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet|Charles Malet]], a senior merchant from Bombay, to be a permanent [[Resident (title)|Resident]] at Pune because of his knowledge of the languages and customs of the region.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=20}}\n\n==Prelude==\nThe Maratha Empire had partly declined due to the Second Anglo-Maratha War.{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=39}} Efforts to modernize the armies were half-hearted and undisciplined: newer techniques were not absorbed by the soldiers, while the older methods and experience were outdated and obsolete.{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=39}} The Maratha Empire lacked an efficient spy system, and had weak diplomacy compared to the British. Maratha artillery was outdated, and weapons were imported. Foreign officers were responsible for the handling of the imported guns; the Marathas never used their own men in considerable numbers for the purpose. Although Maratha infantry was praised by the likes of Wellington, they were poorly led by their generals and heavily relied on mercenaries (known as Pindaris). The confederate-like structure that evolved within the empire created a lack of unity needed for the wars.{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=39}}\n\n[[File:Mountstuart-Elphinstone.jpg|left|thumb|Mountstuart Elphinstone]]\nAt the time of the war, the power of the British East India Company was on the rise, whereas the Maratha Empire was on the decline. The British had been victorious in the previous Anglo-Maratha war and the Marathas were at their mercy. The Peshwa of the Maratha Empire at this time was [[Baji Rao II]]. Several Maratha leaders who had formerly sided with the Peshwa were now under British control or protection. The British had an arrangement with the [[Gaekwad]] dynasty of the Maratha province of [[Baroda State|Baroda]] to prevent the Peshwa from collecting revenue in that province. Gaekwad sent an envoy to the Peshwa in Pune to negotiate a dispute regarding revenue collection. The envoy, Gangadhar Shastri, was under British protection. He was murdered, and the Peshwa's minister [[Trimbak Dengle]] was suspected of the crime.\n\nThe British seized the opportunity to force Baji Rao into a treaty.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|pp=79\u201380}} The treaty (The [[Treaty of Poona|Treaty of Pune]]) was signed on 13 June 1817.

These included his most important strongholds in the Deccan, the seaboard of Konkan, and all places north of the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] and south of the [[Tungabhadra]] rivers. The Peshwa was also not to communicate with any other powers in India.{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=17}} The British Resident [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]] also asked the Peshwa to disband his cavalry.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|pp=79\u201380}}\n\n===Maratha planning===\n[[File:RaigadFort1.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the old palace at Raigad fort]]\nThe Peshwa disbanded his cavalry, but secretly asked them to stand by, and offered them seven months' advance pay.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=80}} Baji Rao entrusted [[Bapu Gokhale]] with preparations for war.{{sfn|Duff|1921|pp=468\u2013469}} In August 1817, the forts at Sinhagad, Raigad, and Purandar were fortified by the Peshwa.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=468}} Gokhale secretly recruited troops for the impending war.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=468}} Many [[Bhils]] and [[Ramoshi|Ramoshis]] were hired.

Captain Stauton arrived near Koregaon along with 500 infantry, two six-pounder guns, and 200 irregular horsemen. Only 24 of the infantry were of European origin; they were from the Madras Artillery. The rest of the infantry was composed of Indians employed by the British.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=81}} The village of Koregaon was on the north bank of the river, which was shallow and narrow at this time of year. The village had a fortified enclosure constructed in the standard Maratha fashion. Stauton occupied the village but was unable to take the fortified enclosure, which was occupied by the Marathas. The British were cut off from the river, their only source of water. A fierce battle ensued that lasted the entire day. Streets and guns were captured and recaptured, changing hands several times. Baji Rao's commander Trimabkji killed Lt. Chishom thereby avenging the death of Govindrao Gokhle, the only son of Bapu Gokhle. {{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=84}} The Peshwa watched the battle from atop a nearby hill about two miles away. The Marathas evacuated the village and retreated during the night. This move on the part of the Marathas may seem justifiable because they were employing the tactics of Ganimi Kawa rather than Rangdi Maslat.{{sfn|Inamdar|1975|p= 7}} The British lost 175 men and about a third of the irregular horse, with more than half of the European officers wounded. The Marathas lost 500 to 600 men.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=487}} When the British found the village evacuated in the morning, Staunton took his battered troops and pretended to march on to Pune, but actually went to Shirur. The first authentic information about the Koregaon battle shows that it was a narrow escape rather than a heroic victory for the British. \"Accounts have been received from Lt Col Burr, dated the 3rd(January, 1818), intimating that Capt. Staunton, commanding the 2nd battalion 1st regiment of Bombay Native Infantry, had been fortunately able to commence his march back to Seroor, with 125 wounded, having buried 50 at Goregaum (sic), and left 12 or 15 there, badly wounded; that the Peshwa had proceeded Southward, General Smith in pursuit, which had probably saved the battalion.\" <ref>\"Interesting Intelligence from the London Gazette\" (June 1818) page 550. </ref>\n\n\nAfter the battle the British forces under general Pritzler{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=487}} pursued the Peshwa, who fled southwards towards [[Karnataka]] with the Raja of Satara.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=487}} The Peshwa continued his flight southward throughout the month of January.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=483}}{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=488}} Not receiving support from the Raja of Mysore, the Peshwa doubled back and passed General Pritzler to head towards [[Solapur]].{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=488}} Until 29 January the pursuit of the Peshwa had not been productive. Whenever Baji Rao was pressed by the British, Gokhale and his light troops hovered around the Peshwa and fired long shots. Some skirmishes took place, and the Marathas were frequently hit by shells from the horse artillery. There was, however, no advantageous result to either party.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=489}} On 7 February General Smith entered Satara and captured the royal palace of the Marathas. He symbolically raised the British flag.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=489}} The next day, the ''Bhagwa Zenda'' \u2014the flag of Shivaji and the Marathas\u2014 was raised in its place.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=489}} To gain the support of the population, the British declared that they would not interfere with the tenets of any religion. They announced that all Watans, [[Inamdar (feudal title)|Inams]],{{refn|Watans and Inams were the properties or lands of the absentee landlords, mostly the high caste Brahmins. ''Watan'' and ''Inam'' are terms specific to Maharasthra. [[Jagir]] is another such term in Maharashtra. Someone who held a Watan was called Watandar; a holder of an inam was an Inamdar. [[Zamindar]] is a similar term used in the state of [[Bengal]]. Watans and Inams were abolished in independent India.{{sfn|Government of Maharashtra|1961}}|group=note}} pensions, and annual allowances would be continued provided that the recipients withdrew from the service of Baji Rao.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=489}} During this time Baji Rao remained in the vicinity of Solapur.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=491}}\n\nOn 19 February, General Smith got word that the Peshwa was headed for [[Pandharpur]]. General Smith's troops attacked the Peshwa at Ashti en route. During this battle, Gokhale died while defending the Peshwa from the British. The Raja of Satara was captured along with his brother and mother. The Maratha king, first imprisoned by Tarabai in the 1750s had lost power much earlier but was reinstated by Madhav rao Peshwa in 1763 after Tarabai's death. Since then the king had retained a titular position of appointing the Peshwas. The Emperor Alamgir II in his farman to the Peshwa had complimented them for looking after the Chhatrapati family.<ref>Bharat Itihas Sanshodhan mandal Quarterly July 1920</ref> The Chhatrapati declared in favour of the British and this ended the Peshwa's legal position as head of the Maratha confederacy, this was done by a jahirnama which stated Peshwas were no longer the head of the Maratha confederacy. However [[Baji Rao II]] challenged the jahirnama of removing him from his position as [[Peshwa]] by issuing another jahirnama removing Mountstuart Elphinstone as British Resident to his state. The death of Gokhale and the skirmish at Ashti hastened the end of the war.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=493}} Soon after this Baji Rao was deserted by the [[Patwardhan]]s.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=494}}\n\nBy 10 April 1818, General Smith's forces had taken the forts of [[Sinhagad]] and Purandar.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=517}} Mountstuart Elphinstone mentions the capture of Sinhagadh in his diary entry for 13 February 1818: \"The garrison contained no Marathas, but consisted of 100 Arabs, 600 Gosains, and 400 Konkani. The Killadar was a boy of eleven; the real Governor, Appajee Punt Sewra, a mean-looking Carcoon. The garrison was treated with great liberality; and, though there was much property and money in the place, the Killadar was allowed to have whatever he claimed as his own.\"{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=517}}{{refn|Killadar means the commandant of a fort, castle or garrison.{{sfn|Yule|Burnell|1903|p=483}}|group=note}} On 3 June 1818 Baji Rao surrendered to the British and negotiated the sum of {{Indian Rupee}} eight [[lakhs]] as annual maintenance.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=513}} Baji Rao obtained promises from the British in favor of the [[Jagirdar]]s, his family, the Brahmins, and religious institutions.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=513}} The Peshwa was sent to [[Bithur]] near [[Kanpur]].{{sfn|Duff|1921|pp=513\u2013514}} While the downfall and banishment of the Peshwa was mourned all over the Maratha Empire as a national defeat, the Peshwa seemed unaffected. He contracted more marriages and spent his long life engaged in religious performances and excessive drinking.{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=21}}\n\n===Events in Nagpur===\n{{See also|Sitabuldi Fort}}\n[[File:Sitabuldi fort gate.JPG|thumb|250px|Sitabardi fort today]]\n[[File:Battle of Kirki, 1817.jpg|thumb|250px|Battle of Kirki, 1817]]\n\nMadhoji Bhonsle, also known as Appa Saheb, consolidated his power in Nagpur after the murder of his cousin, the imbecile ruler Parsoji Bhonsle. He entered into a treaty with the British on 27 May 1816.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=82}} He ignored the request of the British Resident Jenkins to refrain from contact with Baji Rao II. Jenkins asked Appa Saheb to disband his growing concentration of troops and come to the residency, which he also refused to do. Appa Saheb openly declared support for the Peshwa, who was already fighting the British near Pune. As it was now clear that a battle was in the offing, Jenkins asked for reinforcements from nearby British East India Company troops. He already had about 1,500 men under Lieutenant-Colonel Hopentoun Scott.{{sfn|Burton|1908|p=159}} Jenkins sent word for Colonel Adams to march to Nagpur with his troops.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=82}} Like other Maratha leaders, Appa Shaeb employed Arabs in his army.{{sfn|Burton|1908|p=53}} They were typically involved in holding fortresses. While they were known to be among the bravest of troops, they were not amenable to discipline and order. The total strength of the Marathas was about 18,000.{{sfn|Burton|1908|p=160}}\n\nThe Residency was to the west of the Sitabardi hill, a {{convert|300|yd|adj=on}} hillock running north\u2013south. The British East India Company troops occupied the north end of the hillock.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=83}} The Marathas, fighting with the Arabs, made good initial gains by charging up the hill and forcing the British to retreat to the south. British commanders began arriving with reinforcements: Lieutenant Colonel Rahan on 29 November, Major Pittman on 5 December, and Colonel Doveton on 12 December. The British counterattack was severe and Appa Saheb was forced to surrender. The British lost 300 men, of which 24 were Europeans; the Marathas lost an equal number. A treaty was signed on 9 January 1818. Appa Saheb was allowed to rule over nominal territories with several restrictions. Most of his territory, including the forts, was now controlled by the British. They built additional fortifications on Sitabardi hill.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=83}}\n\nA few days later Appa Saheb was arrested. He was being escorted to Allahabad when he escaped to Punjab to seek refuge with the Sikhs. They turned him down and he was captured once again by the British near Jodhpur. [[Raja Mansingh]] of Jodhpur stood surety for him and he remained in Jodhpur, where he died on 15 July 1849 at 44 years of age.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=83}}\n\n===Subjugation of Holkar===\n{{See also|Battle of Mahidpur}}\n[[File:Joppen1907India1823a.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of India after the Third Anglo-Maratha War, 1819]]\nHolkar was offered terms similar to those offered to Shinde; the only difference was that Holkar accepted and respected the independence of Amir Khan. The Court of Holkar was at this time practically nonexistent. When Tantia Jog, an official of the Holkar, urged acceptance of the offer he was suspected of being in collusion with the British. In reality he made the suggestion because he was aware of the power of the British as he had seen their armies in action when he had commanded a battalion in the past.{{sfn|Kibe|1904|pp=351\u2013352}} Holkar responded to the Peshwa's call for insurrection against the British by initiating a battle in Mahidpur.{{sfn|Bakshi|Ralhan|2007|p=315}}\n\nThe battle of Mahidpur between Holkar and the British was fought on 21 December 1817. The charge on the British side was led by Malcolm himself. A deadly battle ensued lasting from midday until 3:00&nbsp;am. Lieutenant General Thomas Hislop was commander in chief of the Madras army. Hislop came in sight of the Holkar army about 9:00&nbsp;am.{{sfn|Hough|1853|p=71}} The British East India Company's army lost 800 men{{sfn|Sarkar|Pati|2000|p=48}} but Holkar's force was destroyed.{{sfn|Prakash|2002|p=135}} The British East India Company's losses were 800 killed or wounded but Holkar's loss was much larger with about 3,000 killed or wounded.{{sfn|Keightley|1847|p=165}} These losses meant Holkar was deprived of any means of rising in arms against the British,{{sfn|Prakash|2002|p=136}} and this broke the power of the Holkar dynasty. The battle of Mahidpur proved disastrous for the Maratha fortunes. Henry Durand wrote, \"After the battle of Mahidpur not only the Peshwa's but the real influence of the Mahratta States of Holkar and Shinde were dissolved and replaced by British supremacy.\"{{sfn|Government of Madhya Pradesh|1827|p=79}} Although the power of the Holkar family was broken, the remaining troops remained hostile and a division was retained to disperse them.

Shinde and the Afghan Amir Khan were subdued by the use of diplomacy and pressure, which resulted in the [[Gwalior State|Treaty of Gwailor]]{{sfn|Prakash|2002|p=300}} on 5 November 1817. Under this treaty, Shinde surrendered Rajasthan to the British and agreed to help them fight the Pindaris.

The famed [[Nassak Diamond]] was acquired by the Company as part of the spoils of the war.{{sfn|United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals|1930|p=121}} The British acquired large chunks of territory from the Maratha Empire and in effect put an end to their most dynamic opposition.{{sfn|Black|2006|p=77}} The terms of surrender Malcolm offered to the Peshwa were controversial amongst the British for being too liberal: The Peshwa was offered a luxurious life near Kanpur and given a pension of about 80,000 pounds. A comparison was drawn with [[Napoleon]], who was confined to a small rock in the south Atlantic and given a small sum for his maintenance. Trimbakji Dengale was captured after the war and was sent to the fortress of Chunar<!--{{sfn|Wheeler|1880|p=495}} unattached reference -->in Bengal where he spent the rest of his life. With all active resistance over, John Malcolm played a prominent part in capturing and pacifying the remaining fugitives.{{sfn|Hunter|1907|p=204}}\n\nThe Peshwa's territories were absorbed into the [[Bombay Presidency]] and the territory seized from the Pindaris became the [[Central Provinces]] of British India.

The war left the Company in control of most of India. It began with an invasion of the Maratha territory by British East India Company troops,{{sfn|Bakshi|Ralhan|2007|p=261}} and although the British were outnumbered, the Maratha army was decimated. The troops were led by the [[Governor-General of India|Governor General]] [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Hastings]] (no relation to [[Warren Hastings]], the first governor-general of Bengal) supported by a force under [[Sir Thomas Hislop, 1st Baronet|General Thomas Hislop]]. Operations began against the [[Pindaris]], a band of Muslim mercenaries and Marathas from central India.{{refn|\"Thus, many Pindaris were originally Muslim or Maratha cavalrymen who were disbanded or found Pindari life better than formal military service... Most Pindaris professed to be Muslims, but some could not even repeat the ''kalima'' or Muslim creed nor knew the name of the prophet.\"{{sfn|McEldowney|1966|p=18}}|group=note}}\n\n[[Peshwa]] [[Baji Rao II]]'s forces, supported by those of [[Mudhoji II Bhonsle]] of [[Nagpur]] and [[Holkar|Malharrao Holkar III]] of [[Indore]], rose against the East India Company. Pressure and diplomacy convinced the fourth major Maratha leader, [[Daulat Scindia|Daulatrao Shinde]] of [[Gwalior]], to remain neutral even though he lost control of [[Rajasthan]].\n\nBritish victories were swift, resulting in the breakup of the Maratha Empire and the loss of Maratha independence. The Peshwa was defeated in the battles of [[Battle of Khadki|Khadki]] and [[Battle of Koregaon|Koregaon]]. Several minor battles were fought by the Peshwa's forces to prevent his capture.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|pp=79\u201386}}\n\nThe Peshwa was eventually captured and placed on a small estate at [[Bithur]], near [[Kanpur]]. Most of his territory was annexed and became part of the [[Bombay Presidency]]. The Maharaja of Satara was restored as the ruler of his territory as a [[princely state]]. In 1848 this territory was also annexed by the Bombay Presidency under the [[doctrine of lapse]] policy of [[Lord Dalhousie]]. Bhonsle was defeated in the [[Sitabuldi Fort|battle of Sitabuldi]] and Holkar in the [[battle of Mahidpur]]. The northern portion of Bhonsle's dominions in and around Nagpur, together with the Peshwa's territories in [[Bundelkhand]], were annexed by British India as the [[Saugor and Nerbudda Territories]]. The defeat of the Bhonsle and Holkar also resulted in the acquisition of the Maratha kingdoms of Nagpur and Indore by the British. Along with Gwalior from Shinde and [[Jhansi]] from the Peshwa, all of these territories became princely states acknowledging British control. The British proficiency in Indian war-making was demonstrated through their rapid victories in Khadki, Sitabuldi, Mahidpur, Koregaon, and Satara.{{sfn|Black|2006|p=78}}\n\n==The Marathas and the British==\n[[File:Joppen1907India1805a-21.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of India after the Second Anglo-Maratha War, 1805]]\nThe Maratha Empire was founded in 1674 by [[Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]] of the [[Bhosle]] dynasty. Common elements among the citizens of Chatrapati Shivaji's Maratha Empire were the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] language, the Hindu religion, a strong sense of belonging, and a national feeling.{{sfn|Subburaj|2000|p=13}} Shivaji led resistance efforts to free the [[Hindus]] from the Mughals and Muslim [[Sultanate of Bijapur]] and established rule of the [[Hindus]]. This kingdom was known as the [[Hindavi Swarajya]] (\"Hindu self-rule\") in the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] language. Chatrapati Shivaji's capital was located at [[Raigad fort|Raigad]]. Chatrapati Shivaji successfully defended his empire from attacks by the [[Mughal Empire]] and his [[Maratha Empire]] went on to defeat and overtake it as the premier power in India within few decades. A key component of the Maratha administration was the council of eight ministers, called the ''[[Ashta Pradhan]]'' (council of eight). The senior-most member of the Ashta Pradhan was called the ''Peshwa'' or the ''Mukhya Pradhan'' (prime minister). {{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Growing British power===\nWhile the Marathas were fighting the Mughals in the early 18th century, the British held small trading posts in [[Mumbai]], [[Madras]] and [[Calcutta]]. The British fortified the naval post of Mumbai after they saw the Marathas defeat the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] at neighbouring [[Vasai]] in May 1739. In an effort to keep the Marathas out of Mumbai, the British sent envoys to negotiate a treaty. The envoys were successful, and a treaty was signed on 12 July 1739 that gave the [[British East India Company]] rights to free trade in Maratha territory.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=1}} In the south, the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] had enlisted the support of the French for his war against the Marathas.{{refn|Meaning \"Administrator of the Realm\", the title of Nizam was specific to the native sovereigns of [[Hyderabad State]], India, since 1719.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=2}}|group=note}} In reaction to this, the Peshwa requested support from the British, but was refused. Unable to see the rising power of the British, the Peshwa set a precedent by seeking their help to solve internal Maratha conflicts.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=2}} Despite the lack of support, the Marathas managed to defeat the Nizam over a period of five years.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=2}}\n\nDuring the period 1750\u20131761, British defeated the French East India Company in India, and by 1793 they were firmly established in [[Bengal]] in the east and [[Madras]] in the south. They were unable to expand to the west as the Marathas were dominant there, but they entered [[Surat]] on the west coast via the sea.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=3}}\n\nThe Marathas marched beyond the [[Indus River|Indus]] as their empire grew.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=3}} The responsibility for managing the sprawling Maratha empire in the north was entrusted to two Maratha leaders, Shinde and Holkar, as the Peshwa was busy in the south.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=4}} The two leaders did not act in concert, and their policies were influenced by personal interests and financial demands. They alienated other Hindu rulers such as the Rajputs, the Jats, and the Rohillas, and they failed to diplomatically win over other Muslim leaders.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=4}} A large blow to the Marathas came in their defeat on 14 January 1761 at Panipat against a combined Muslim force that gathered for Jihad (holy battle) led by the Afghan [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]]. An entire generation of Maratha leaders lay dead on the battlefield as a result of that conflict.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=4}} However, between 1761 and 1773, the Marathas regained the lost ground in the north.{{sfn|Sen|1994|pp=4\u20139}}\n\n===Anglo-Maratha relations===\nThe Maratha gains in the north were undone because of the contradictory policies of Holkar and Shinde and the internal disputes in the family of the Peshwa, which culminated in the murder of [[Narayanrao Peshwa]] in 1773.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=9}} Due to this, the Marathas virtually disappeared from north India. [[Raghunathrao]] was ousted from the seat of Peshwa due to continuing internal Maratha rivalries. He sought help from the British, and they signed the [[Treaty of Surat]] with him in March 1775.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=10}} This treaty gave him military assistance in exchange for control of [[Salsette Island]] and [[Bassein Fort]].{{sfn|Sen|1994|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nThe treaty set off discussions amongst the British in India as well as in Europe because of the serious implications of a confrontation with the powerful Marathas. Another cause for concern was that the Bombay Council had exceeded its constitutional authority by signing such a treaty.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=11}} The treaty was the cause of the start of the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]].{{refn|This treaty, as Grant Duff says, occasioned infinite discussions amongst the British in India and in Europe, and started the First Maratha War.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=11}}|group=note}} This war was virtually a stalemate, with no side being able to defeat the other.{{sfn|Schmidt|1995|p=64}} The war concluded with the treaty of Salabai in May 1782, mediated by Mahadji Shinde. The foresight of [[Warren Hastings]] was the main reason for the success of the British in the war. He had destroyed the anti-British coalition and created a division between the Shinde, the Bhonsle, and the Peshwa.{{refn|With justifiable pride Hastings wrote to one of his friends on 7 February 1783: \"Indeed, my dear Sir, there have been three or four very critical periods in our affairs in which the existence of the Company and of the British dominion in India lay at my mercy and would have been lost had I coldly attended to the beaten path of duty and avoided personal responsibility. In the redress afforded to the Nizam I drew him to our interests from the most inveterate enmity. In my negotiations with Modajee Boosla ''(sic)'' I preserved these provinces from ravage and obtained evidence of his connections even beyond his own intentions; and I effected a peace and alliance with Madajee Sindhia ''(sic)'' which was in effect a peace with the Maratha State.\"{{sfn|Sen|1994|pp=12\u201313}}|group=note}}\n\nThe Marathas were still in a very strong position when the new Governor General of British controlled territories [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Cornwallis]] arrived in India in 1786.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=17}} After the treaty of Salabai, the British followed a policy of coexistence in the north. The British and the Marathas enjoyed more than two decades of peace, thanks to the diplomacy of [[Nana Phadnavis]], a minister in the court of the 11-year-old [[Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao]]. The situation changed soon after Nana's death in 1800. The power struggle between Holkar and Shinde caused Holkar to attack the Peshwa in [[Pune]] in 1801, since the Peshwa sided with Shinde. The Peshwa [[Baji Rao II]] fled Pune to safety on a British warship. Baji Rao feared loss of his own powers and signed the [[Treaty of Bassein (1802)|treaty of Bassein]]. This made the Peshwa in effect a subsidiary ally of the British.\n\nIn response to the treaty, the Bhonsle and Shinde attacked the British, refusing to accept the betrayal of their sovereignty to the British by the Peshwa. This was the start of the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]] in 1803. Both were defeated by the British, and all Maratha leaders lost large parts of their territory to the British.{{sfn|Schmidt|1995|p=64}}\n\n===The British East India Company===\nThe British had travelled thousands of miles to arrive in India. They studied Indian geography and mastered local languages to deal with the Indians.{{refn|\"Opposed to these were the British who had come all the way from England to establish an empire in India. They had a ''(sic)'' previous experience not only in many European wars, but also in many Indian ones. Whatever they did, they did in a planned manner. No step was taken blindly. Everything was thoroughly discussed and debated upon before it was taken up. The network of their spies spread far and wide. They mastered the Indian languages to deal with the Indians in a perfect manner. They mastered Indian geography before they made any military movement in any part of the country. Nothing was left to chance and guess-work.\"{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=40}}|group=note}} At the time, they were technologically advanced, with superior equipment in several critical areas to that available locally. Chhabra hypothesizes that even if the British technical superiority were discounted, they would have won the war because of the discipline and organization in their ranks.{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=40}} After the First Anglo-Maratha war, Warren Hastings declared in 1783 that the peace established with the Marathas was on such a firm ground that it was not going to be shaken for years to come.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=20}}\n\nThe British believed that a new permanent approach was needed to establish and maintain continuous contact with the Peshwa's court in [[Pune]]. The British appointed [[Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet|Charles Malet]], a senior merchant from Bombay, to be a permanent [[Resident (title)|Resident]] at Pune because of his knowledge of the languages and customs of the region.{{sfn|Sen|1994|p=20}}\n\n==Prelude==\nThe Maratha Empire had partly declined due to the Second Anglo-Maratha War.{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=39}} Efforts to modernize the armies were half-hearted and undisciplined: newer techniques were not absorbed by the soldiers, while the older methods and experience were outdated and obsolete.{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=39}} The Maratha Empire lacked an efficient spy system, and had weak diplomacy compared to the British. Maratha artillery was outdated, and weapons were imported. Foreign officers were responsible for the handling of the imported guns; the Marathas never used their own men in considerable numbers for the purpose. Although Maratha infantry was praised by the likes of Wellington, they were poorly led by their generals and heavily relied on mercenaries (known as Pindaris). The confederate-like structure that evolved within the empire created a lack of unity needed for the wars.{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=39}}\n\n[[File:Mountstuart-Elphinstone.jpg|left|thumb|Mountstuart Elphinstone]]\nAt the time of the war, the power of the British East India Company was on the rise, whereas the Maratha Empire was on the decline. The British had been victorious in the previous Anglo-Maratha war and the Marathas were at their mercy. The Peshwa of the Maratha Empire at this time was [[Baji Rao II]]. Several Maratha leaders who had formerly sided with the Peshwa were now under British control or protection. The British had an arrangement with the [[Gaekwad]] dynasty of the Maratha province of [[Baroda State|Baroda]] to prevent the Peshwa from collecting revenue in that province. Gaekwad sent an envoy to the Peshwa in Pune to negotiate a dispute regarding revenue collection. The envoy, Gangadhar Shastri, was under British protection. He was murdered, and the Peshwa's minister [[Trimbak Dengle]] was suspected of the crime.\n\nThe British seized the opportunity to force Baji Rao into a treaty.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|pp=79\u201380}} The treaty (The [[Treaty of Poona|Treaty of Pune]]) was signed on 13 June 1817. Key terms imposed on the Peshwa included the admission of Dengle's guilt, renouncing claims on Gaekwad, and surrender of significant swaths of territory to the British. These included his most important strongholds in the Deccan, the seaboard of Konkan, and all places north of the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] and south of the [[Tungabhadra]] rivers. The Peshwa was also not to communicate with any other powers in India.{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=17}} The British Resident [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]] also asked the Peshwa to disband his cavalry.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|pp=79\u201380}}\n\n===Maratha planning===\n[[File:RaigadFort1.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the old palace at Raigad fort]]\nThe Peshwa disbanded his cavalry, but secretly asked them to stand by, and offered them seven months' advance pay.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=80}} Baji Rao entrusted [[Bapu Gokhale]] with preparations for war.{{sfn|Duff|1921|pp=468\u2013469}} In August 1817, the forts at Sinhagad, Raigad, and Purandar were fortified by the Peshwa.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=468}} Gokhale secretly recruited troops for the impending war.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=468}} Many [[Bhils]] and [[Ramoshi|Ramoshis]] were hired. Efforts were made to unify Bhonsle, Shinde, and Holkar; even the mercenary [[Pindari]]s were approached.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=468}} The Peshwa identified unhappy Marathas in the service of the British Resident Elphinstone and secretly recruited them. One such person was Jaswant Rao Ghorpade. Efforts were made to secretly recruit Europeans as well, which failed.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=470}} Some people, such as [[Balaji Pant Natu]], stood steadfastly with the British.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=470}} Several of the sepoys rejected the Peshwa's offers,{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=474}} and others reported the matter to their superior officers.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=470}} On 19 October 1817, Baji Rao II celebrated the [[Vijayadashami|Dassera]] festival in Pune, where troops were assembled in large numbers.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=80}} During the celebrations, a large flank of the Maratha cavalry pretended they were charging towards the British sepoys but wheeled off at the last minute. This display was intended as a slight towards Elphinstone {{sfn|Duff|1921|p=471}} and as a scare tactic to prompt the defection and recruitment of British sepoys to the Peshwa's side.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=471}} The Peshwa made plans to kill Elphinstone, despite opposition from Gokhale. Elphinstone was fully aware of these developments thanks to the espionage work of Balaji Pant Natu and Ghorpade.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=80}}\n\nBurton provides an estimate of the strength of various Maratha powers in or around 1817:\nHe estimated the various Maratha powers totals to 81,000 infantry, 106,000 horse or cavalry and 589 guns. Of these the Peshwa had the highest number of cavalry at 28,000, along with 14,000 infantry and 37 guns. The Peshwa headquarters was in Pune, which was the southernmost location amongst the other Maratha powers. Holkar had the second largest cavalry, amounting to 20,000, and an infantry force of 8,000. His guns totaled to 107 guns. Shinde and Bhonsle had similar numbers of cavalry and infantry, with each having 15,000 and 16,000 cavalry, respectively. Shinde had 16,000 infantry and Bhonsle, 18,000. Shinde had the larger share of guns amounting to 140 whereas Bhonsle had 85. Holkar, Shinde and Bhonsle were headquartered in Indore, Gwalior and Nagpur respectively. The Afghan leader Amir Khan was located in Tonk in Rajputana and his strength was 12,000 cavalry, 10,000 infantry and 200 guns.{{sfn|Burton|1908|p=153}}{{sfn|Bakshi|Ralhan|2007|p=261}}{{sfn|United Service Institution of India|1901|p=96}} The Pindaris were located north of the Narmada valley in Chambal and Malwa region of central India. Three Pindari leaders sided with Shinde, these were Setu, Karim Khan and Dost Mohammad. They were mostly horsemen with strengths of 10,000, 6,000 and 4,000. The rest of the Pindari chiefs, Tulsi, Imam Baksh, Sahib Khan, Kadir Baksh, Nathu and Bapu were allied with Holkar. Tulsi and Imam Baksh each had 2,000 horsemen, Kadir Baksh, 21,500. Sahib Khan, Nathu and Bapu had 1,000, 750 and 150 horsemen.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|pp=86\u201387}}\n\n==Commencement==\n[[File:Richard Colley Wellesley.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley]], who rapidly expanded the Company's territories with victories in the [[Anglo-Maratha Wars]]]]\nThe Peshwa's territory was in an area called the [[Desh, Maharashtra|Desha]], now part of the modern state of Maharashtra. The region consists of the valleys of the [[Krishna River|Krishna]] and [[Godavari River|Godavari]] rivers and the plateaus of the [[Sahyadri Mountains]]. Shinde's territory around [[Gwalior]] and [[Bundelkhand]] was a region of rolling hills and fertile valleys that slopes down toward the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] to the north. The Pindari territory was the valleys and forests of the [[Chambal Division|Chambal]], the north western region of the modern state of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. It was a mountainous region with a harsh climate. The Pindaris also operated from [[Malwa]], a plateau region in the north west of the state of Madhya Pradesh, north of the [[Vindhya Range]]. Holkar was based in the upper [[Narmada River]] valley.{{sfn|Nadkarni|2000|p=10}}\n\n{{See also|Battle of Khadki}}\nThe war was mostly a mopping-up operation intended to complete the expansion of the earlier Anglo-Maratha war, which was stopped due to economic concerns of the British.{{sfn|Black|2006|pp=77\u201378}} The war began as a campaign against the Pindaris.{{sfn|Sarkar|Pati|2000|p=48}} Seeing that the British were in conflict with the Pindaris, the Peshwa's forces attacked the British at 16:00 on 5 November 1817 with the Maratha left attacking the British right. The Maratha forces comprised 20,000 cavalry, 8,000 infantry, and 20 guns{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=80}} whereas the British had 2,000 cavalry, 1,000 infantry, and eight guns.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=81}} On the Maratha side, an additional 5,000 horse and 1,000 infantry were guarding the Peshwa at [[Parvati Hill]]. The British numbers include Captain Ford's unit, which was en route from [[Dapodi]] to [[Khadki]].{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=81}} The British had also asked General Smith to come to Khadki for the battle but they did not anticipate he would arrive in time.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=81}}\n\nThree hills in the region were the Parvati Hill, the [[Chaturshringi Hill]], and the Khadki hill. The Peshwa watched the battle from the Parvati Hill whereas the British East India Company troops were based on the Khadki hill.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=80}} The two hills are separated by a distance of four kilometres. The river Mula is shallow and narrow and could be crossed at several locations.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=80}} A few canals (''nallas'' in Marathi) joined the river and though these were not obstacles, some of them were obscured due to the vegetation in the area.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=80}}\n\nThe Maratha army was a mix of [[Rohillas]], [[Rajputs]], and Marathas. It also included a small force of the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] under their officer, de Pinto.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=80}} The left flank of the Maratha army, commanded by Moropant Dixit and Raste, was stationed on the flat ground on which the [[University of Pune]] stands today.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=80}} The centre was commanded by Bapu Gokhale and the right was under Vinchurkar. British troop movements began on 1 November 1817 when Colonel Burr moved his forces towards what is now Bund Garden via the Holkar Bridge.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=81}} The Maratha were successful initially in creating and exploiting a gap in the British left and centre. These successes were nullified by the Maratha horses being thrown into disarray by a hidden canal and the temporary loss of command by Gokhale, whose horse was shot. The Marathas were rendered leaderless when Moropant Dixit on the right was shot dead. The British infantry advanced steadily, firing volley after volley, causing the Maratha cavalry to retreat in a matter of four hours. The British soon claimed victory. The British lost 86 men and the Maratha about 500.{{sfn|Murray|1901|p=324}}{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=19}}\n\n===The Pindaris===\n{{See also|Pindaris}}\n[[File:Malwa India 1823.png|thumb|Location of Malwa in an 1823 depiction of India.

They encouraged the Pindaris to raid the British territories.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=86}} The Pindaris, who were mostly cavalry, came to be known as the ''Shindeshahi'' and the ''Holkarshahi'' after the patronage they received from the respective defeated Maratha leaders.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|pp=86\u201387}} The Pindari leaders were Setu, Karim Khan, Dost Mohammad, Tulsi, Imam Baksh, Sahib Khan, Kadir Baksh, Nathu, and Bapu. Of these, Setu, Karim Khan, and Dost Mohammad belonged to Shindeshahi and the rest to Holkarshahi.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=87}} The total strength of the Pindaris in 1814 was estimated at 33,000.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=86}} The Pindaris frequently raided villages in Central India. The result of the Pindari raids was that Central India was being rapidly reduced to the condition of a desert because the peasants were unable to support themselves on the land. They had no option but to join the robber bands or starve.{{sfn|Russell|1916|p=396}} In 1815, 25,000 Pindaris entered the [[Madras Presidency]] and destroyed over 300 villages on the [[Coromandel coast]]. Another band swept the Nizam's kingdom while a third entered [[Malabar district|Malabar]]. Other Pindari raids on British territory followed in 1816 and 1817. [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings]] saw that there could not be peace or security in India until the predatory Pindaris were extinguished.{{sfn|Sinclair|1884|p=194}}\n\n===British planning===\nTo lead an army against the Pindaris in the hope of engaging them in a regular battle was not possible. To effectively crush the Pindaris, they would have to be surrounded so that they could have no means of escape.{{sfn|Sinclair|1884|p=194}} Francis Rawdon-Hastings obtained authority from the British government to take action against the Pindaris{{sfn|Russell|1916|p=396}} while performing diplomacy with the principal Maratha leaders to act in concert with him. The Pindaris continued to have the sympathy of almost all the Maratha leaders. In 1817 Rawdon-Hastings collected the strongest British army which had yet been seen in India, numbering roughly 120,000 men. The army was assembled from two smaller armies, the Grand Army or [[Bengal army]] in the north under his personal command, and the Army of the Deccan under [[Sir Thomas Hislop, 1st Baronet|General Hislop]] in the south.{{sfn|Bakshi|Ralhan|2007|p=259}} The British plan was to normalize relations with the Shinde, Holkar, and [[Muhammad Amir Khan|Amir Khan]]. The three were known to be well disposed towards the Pindaris and harboured them in their territories. Shinde was secretly planning with the Peshwa and the [[Kingdom of Nepal|Nepal]] Ministry to form a coalition against the British. His correspondence with Nepal was intercepted and presented to him in Durbar.{{sfn|Sinclair|1884|pp=194\u2013195}} He was forced to enter into a treaty by which he pledged to assist the British against the Pindaris and to prevent any new gangs being formed in his territory. Diplomacy, pressure, and the treaty of Gwalior kept Shinde out of the war. Amir Khan disbanded his army on condition of being guaranteed the possession of the principality of [[Tonk (princely state)|Tonk]] in [[Rajputana]]. He sold his guns to the British and agreed to prevent predatory gangs from operating from his territory.{{sfn|Sinclair|1884|pp=194\u2013195}} The army for the war was composed of two armies, the Grand Army or the Bengal Army with a strength of 40,000 troops and the Army of the Deccan with a strength of 70,400. The Grand Army was divided into three divisions and a reserve. The left division was led by Major General Marshall and the central division was under Francis Rawdon-Hastings. The reserve was under General Ochterlony.{{sfn|Bakshi|Ralhan|2007|pp=259\u2013261}} The second army, the Army of the Deccan was composed of five divisions. The divisions were led by [[Sir Thomas Hislop, 1st Baronet|General Hislop]], Brigadier General Doveton, General Malcolm, Brigadier General Smith, Lieutenant Colonel Adams. The Army of Deccan comprised 70,400 troops, bringing the total strength of the entire composite British East India Company army to 110,400.{{sfn|Bakshi|Ralhan|2007|pp=259\u2013262}} In addition the Madras and Pune residencies each had two battalions and a detail of an artillery unit. The Madras residency had an additional three troops of the 6th Bengal Cavalry.{{sfn|United Service Institution of India|1901|p=101}} In October and early November, the first division of the Grand Army was sent to Sind, the second to Chambal, the third to Eastern Narmada. The reserve division was used to pressurise Amir Khan. The effect of the dispatching of the first and second divisions was to cut off Shinde from his potential allies. He and Amir Khan were thus pressured into signing a treaty.{{sfn|United Service Institution of India|1901|p=101}}\n\nThe first and third division of the army of the Deccan were concentrated at Harda to hold the fords of the Narmada.

The Pindaris were attacked, and their homes were surrounded and destroyed. General Hislop from the Madras Residency attacked the Pindaris from the south and drove them beyond the Narmada river, where governor general Francis Rawdon-Hastings was waiting with his army.{{sfn|Sinclair|1884|pp=195\u2013196}} Karim Khan surrendered to the British and was given lands in Gorakhpur.{{sfn|Hunter|1909|p=495}} The principal routes from Central India were occupied by British detachments. The Pindari forces were completely broken up, scattered in the course of a single campaign. They made no stand against the regular troops, and even in small bands they were unable to escape the ring of forces drawn around them. The Pindaris rapidly dispersed over the country. The Pindari chiefs were reduced to the condition of hunted outlaws. The desperate Pindaris expected the Marathas to help them, but none dared to give them even a place of shelter for their families. Karim and Setu had still 23,000 men between them but such a force was no match for the armies that surrounded them. In whatever direction they turned they were met by British forces. Defeat followed defeat. One gang made their escape to the south, leaving all their baggage behind them. Many fled to the jungles and perished. Others sought refuge in the villages, but were killed without mercy by the villagers who had not forgotten the sufferings they had been inflicted upon by the Pindaris.{{sfn|Sinclair|1884|pp=195\u2013196}} The Pindari chiefs Karim Khan and Wasil Mohammed had been present with their Durras at the battle of Mahidpur. Since by this time the Maratha powers had been reduced significantly, the pursuit of Setu and the other leaders was resumed with vigor. All the leaders had surrendered before the end of February and the Pindari system and power was brought to a close. They were removed to Gorakhptir where they obtained grants of land for their subsistence. Karim Khan became a farmer on the small estate he received beyond the Ganges in Gorakpur. Wasil Mohammed attempted to escape. He was found and committed suicide by taking poison.{{sfn|Keightley|1847|p=165}} Setu, a [[Jat]] by caste,{{sfn|Travers|1919|p=19}} was hunted by John Malcolm from place to place until he had no followers left.

On the morning of 16 November, the Marathas were engaged in a battle with the British. While the Maratha generals such as Purandare, Raste, and Bapu Gokhale were ready to advance on to the British forces, they were demoralized after learning that the Peshwa and his brother had fled to [[Purandar fort|Purandar]]. A force of 5,000 additional Marathas was located at the confluence of two rivers\u2014the [[Mula River (India)|Mula]] and the [[Mutha River|Mutha]]\u2014under the leadership of Vinchurkar, but they remained idle. Bapu Gokhale retreated to guard the Peshwa in flight. The next morning, General Smith advanced towards the city of Pune and found that the Peshwa had fled towards the city of [[Satara (city)|Satara]].{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=482}} During the day Pune surrendered, and great care was taken by General Smith for the protection of the peaceful part of the community. Order was soon re-established.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=482}} The British forces entered [[Shanivar Wada]] on 17 November and the Union flag was hoisted by Balaji Pant Natu. However the saffron flags of the Peshwa were not removed from Kotwali Chavdi until the defeat of Baji Rao at Ashti; it might seem that the British still believed that the war was not raised by Baji Rao but he was forced to do so under pressure from Bapu Gokhle, [[Trimabkji Dengle]] and Moreshwar Dikshit. {{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=82}}{{sfn|Rao|1977|p=135}}\n\nThe Peshwa now fled to the town of [[Koregaon Bhima|Koregaon]]. The [[Battle of Koregaon]] (also known as the battle of Koregaon Bhima) took place on 1 January 1818 on the banks of the river Bhima, north west of Pune. Captain Stauton arrived near Koregaon along with 500 infantry, two six-pounder guns, and 200 irregular horsemen. Only 24 of the infantry were of European origin; they were from the Madras Artillery. The rest of the infantry was composed of Indians employed by the British.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=81}} The village of Koregaon was on the north bank of the river, which was shallow and narrow at this time of year. The village had a fortified enclosure constructed in the standard Maratha fashion. Stauton occupied the village but was unable to take the fortified enclosure, which was occupied by the Marathas. The British were cut off from the river, their only source of water. A fierce battle ensued that lasted the entire day. Streets and guns were captured and recaptured, changing hands several times. Baji Rao's commander Trimabkji killed Lt. Chishom thereby avenging the death of Govindrao Gokhle, the only son of Bapu Gokhle. {{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=84}} The Peshwa watched the battle from atop a nearby hill about two miles away. The Marathas evacuated the village and retreated during the night. This move on the part of the Marathas may seem justifiable because they were employing the tactics of Ganimi Kawa rather than Rangdi Maslat.{{sfn|Inamdar|1975|p= 7}} The British lost 175 men and about a third of the irregular horse, with more than half of the European officers wounded. The Marathas lost 500 to 600 men.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=487}} When the British found the village evacuated in the morning, Staunton took his battered troops and pretended to march on to Pune, but actually went to Shirur. The first authentic information about the Koregaon battle shows that it was a narrow escape rather than a heroic victory for the British. \"Accounts have been received from Lt Col Burr, dated the 3rd(January, 1818), intimating that Capt. Staunton, commanding the 2nd battalion 1st regiment of Bombay Native Infantry, had been fortunately able to commence his march back to Seroor, with 125 wounded, having buried 50 at Goregaum (sic), and left 12 or 15 there, badly wounded; that the Peshwa had proceeded Southward, General Smith in pursuit, which had probably saved the battalion.\" <ref>\"Interesting Intelligence from the London Gazette\" (June 1818) page 550. </ref>\n\n\nAfter the battle the British forces under general Pritzler{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=487}} pursued the Peshwa, who fled southwards towards [[Karnataka]] with the Raja of Satara.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=487}} The Peshwa continued his flight southward throughout the month of January.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=483}}{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=488}} Not receiving support from the Raja of Mysore, the Peshwa doubled back and passed General Pritzler to head towards [[Solapur]].{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=488}} Until 29 January the pursuit of the Peshwa had not been productive. Whenever Baji Rao was pressed by the British, Gokhale and his light troops hovered around the Peshwa and fired long shots. Some skirmishes took place, and the Marathas were frequently hit by shells from the horse artillery. There was, however, no advantageous result to either party.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=489}} On 7 February General Smith entered Satara and captured the royal palace of the Marathas. He symbolically raised the British flag.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=489}} The next day, the ''Bhagwa Zenda'' \u2014the flag of Shivaji and the Marathas\u2014 was raised in its place.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=489}} To gain the support of the population, the British declared that they would not interfere with the tenets of any religion.

General Smith's troops attacked the Peshwa at Ashti en route. During this battle, Gokhale died while defending the Peshwa from the British. The Raja of Satara was captured along with his brother and mother. The Maratha king, first imprisoned by Tarabai in the 1750s had lost power much earlier but was reinstated by Madhav rao Peshwa in 1763 after Tarabai's death. Since then the king had retained a titular position of appointing the Peshwas. The Emperor Alamgir II in his farman to the Peshwa had complimented them for looking after the Chhatrapati family.<ref>Bharat Itihas Sanshodhan mandal Quarterly July 1920</ref> The Chhatrapati declared in favour of the British and this ended the Peshwa's legal position as head of the Maratha confederacy, this was done by a jahirnama which stated Peshwas were no longer the head of the Maratha confederacy. However [[Baji Rao II]] challenged the jahirnama of removing him from his position as [[Peshwa]] by issuing another jahirnama removing Mountstuart Elphinstone as British Resident to his state. The death of Gokhale and the skirmish at Ashti hastened the end of the war.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=493}} Soon after this Baji Rao was deserted by the [[Patwardhan]]s.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=494}}\n\nBy 10 April 1818, General Smith's forces had taken the forts of [[Sinhagad]] and Purandar.{{sfn|Duff|1921|p=517}} Mountstuart Elphinstone mentions the capture of Sinhagadh in his diary entry for 13 February 1818: \"The garrison contained no Marathas, but consisted of 100 Arabs, 600 Gosains, and 400 Konkani.

He entered into a treaty with the British on 27 May 1816.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=82}} He ignored the request of the British Resident Jenkins to refrain from contact with Baji Rao II. Jenkins asked Appa Saheb to disband his growing concentration of troops and come to the residency, which he also refused to do. Appa Saheb openly declared support for the Peshwa, who was already fighting the British near Pune. As it was now clear that a battle was in the offing, Jenkins asked for reinforcements from nearby British East India Company troops. He already had about 1,500 men under Lieutenant-Colonel Hopentoun Scott.{{sfn|Burton|1908|p=159}} Jenkins sent word for Colonel Adams to march to Nagpur with his troops.{{sfn|Naravane|2006|p=82}} Like other Maratha leaders, Appa Shaeb employed Arabs in his army.{{sfn|Burton|1908|p=53}} They were typically involved in holding fortresses.

British commanders began arriving with reinforcements: Lieutenant Colonel Rahan on 29 November, Major Pittman on 5 December, and Colonel Doveton on 12 December. The British counterattack was severe and Appa Saheb was forced to surrender. The British lost 300 men, of which 24 were Europeans; the Marathas lost an equal number. A treaty was signed on 9 January 1818. Appa Saheb was allowed to rule over nominal territories with several restrictions.

The Court of Holkar was at this time practically nonexistent. When Tantia Jog, an official of the Holkar, urged acceptance of the offer he was suspected of being in collusion with the British. In reality he made the suggestion because he was aware of the power of the British as he had seen their armies in action when he had commanded a battalion in the past.{{sfn|Kibe|1904|pp=351\u2013352}} Holkar responded to the Peshwa's call for insurrection against the British by initiating a battle in Mahidpur.{{sfn|Bakshi|Ralhan|2007|p=315}}\n\nThe battle of Mahidpur between Holkar and the British was fought on 21 December 1817.

As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989_FIAT_Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions &mdash; with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989_Fiat_Panda_4x4_SISLEY_(3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors &mdash;in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox &mdash; with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time. \n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n*The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n*The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n*The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n*The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n\n*The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n*The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n*The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n*The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n\n*'''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

It was launched in the right-hand drive UK market in May 1981.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 1 h sst.jpg|thumb|left|Rear of pre-facelift Fiat Panda]]\nMechanically the first Pandas shared engines and transmissions with the [[Fiat 127]] and, in certain territories, the air-cooled 652&nbsp;cc two-cylinder powerplant of the [[Fiat 126]]. Rear suspension used a [[solid axle]] suspended on [[leaf spring]]s. Later versions added mechanical improvements while retaining a robust simplicity throughout its model life.\n\nLaunch models included the '''Panda 30''', powered by a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally-mounted]] [[Air cooling|air cooled]] 652&nbsp;cc [[Straight-twin engine|straight-two-cylinder engine]] derived from the 126,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Quattroruote |title=Anteprima: La \"Mini\" si toglie il cilindro: Tutte le bicilindriche |trans-title=Preview: The Mini loses a cylinder: All of the bicylinders |language=it |date=September 1984 |volume=29 |issue=347 |publisher=Editoriale Domus |location=Milan, Italy |first=Alessandro |last=Ferrari |pages=70\u201371}}</ref> and the '''Panda 45''', with a [[Transverse engine|transversely-mounted]] [[Water cooling|water cooled]] 903&nbsp;cc ([[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100 series]]) [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] from the 127. As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989_FIAT_Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions &mdash; with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989_Fiat_Panda_4x4_SISLEY_(3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors &mdash;in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox &mdash; with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time. \n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line.

Fiat did not say which country it was headed to.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fiat builds 2,000,000 Panda in Polish plant|url=http://europeancarnews.com/2011/07/04/fiat-builds-2000000-panda-in-polish-plant/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019113456/http://europeancarnews.com/2011/07/04/fiat-builds-2000000-panda-in-polish-plant/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-10-19|publisher=European Car News}}</ref>\n\n===Panda Classic===\nThe Panda Classic<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quattroruote.it/notizie/auto-novita/fiat-panda-classic-prezzo-di-lancio-da-7900-euro |title=Fiat panda Classic |language=it |publisher=Quattroruote.it |accessdate=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723012958/http://www.quattroruote.it/notizie/auto-novita/fiat-panda-classic-prezzo-di-lancio-da-7900-euro |archivedate=23 July 2012  }}</ref> was a second series Fiat Panda renamed and with a reduced list price to distinguish it from the new generation introduced in late 2011. The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n*The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n*The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n*The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n*The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n*The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n*The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n\n*The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n*The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n*The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n*The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n\n*'''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Pre-colonial history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=February 2013}}\n{{History of the DRC}}\nThe pre-colonial history of the modern-day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] encompasses the history of the [[Congo Basin|Congo Basin region]] up to the establishment of European colonial rule in the era of [[New Imperialism]] and particularly the creation of the [[Congo Free State]] and its expansion into the interior after 1885. As the modern territorial boundaries of the Democratic Republic of the Congo did not exist in this period, it is inseparable from the wider pre-colonial histories of [[Central Africa]], the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] and [[East African Rift|Rift Valley]] as well as the [[Atlantic World]] and [[Swahili coast]].\n\nThe current territory of the Democratic Republic of Congo was occupied by humans in the [[Paleolithic]] at least 80,000 years ago. Waves of [[Bantu expansion|Bantu migrations]] from 2000 BC to 500 AD moved into the basin from the northwest and covered the precolonial states absorbed or overthrown by the colonial powers.\n\nThe [[Bantu people|Bantu]] migrations added to and displaced the indigenous [[Pygmy peoples|Pygmy]] populations in the southern regions of the modern Congo states. The Bantu imported agriculture and iron-working techniques from [[West Africa]] into the area, as well as establishing the [[Bantu language]] family as the primary set of tongues for the Congolese. Subsequent migrations from the [[Darfur]] and [[Kurdufan]] regions of [[Sudan]] into the north of Congo, as well as [[East Africa]]ns migrating into the eastern [[Congo Basin|Congo]], added to the mix of ethnic groups.\n\n==Paleolithic==\n{{main|Central African foragers}}\nThe area now known as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] was populated as early as 80,000 years ago, as shown by the 1988 discovery of the [[Semliki harpoon]] at [[Katanda Territory|Katanda]], one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found, and which is believed to have been used to catch giant river catfish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/getting-food/katanda-bone-harpoon-point|title=Katanda Bone Harpoon Point|publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of National History|series=What Does It Mean to Be Human|date=February 9, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url = https://doi.org/10.1023%2FA%3A1021659928822 | doi=10.1023/A:1021659928822 | volume=15 | issue=3 | year=1998 | journal=African Archaeological Review | pages=173\u2013198 | last1 = Yellen | first1 = John E.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1960 the [[Ishango bone]] tool was discovered, fashioned from the [[fibula]] of a [[baboon]] with a sharp piece of [[quartz]] affixed to one end, perhaps for engraving.

The people living in the south and southwest were  hunter-gatherer groups, whose technology involved only minimal use of metal technologies. The development of metal tools during this time period revolutionized [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]]. This led to the displacement of the [[hunter-gatherer]] groups in the east and southeast.\n\nThe 10th century marked the final expansion of the Bantu in West-Central Africa.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}<!--[[Bantu expansion]] says 1000 BC-->\nRising population soon made intricate local, regional and foreign commercial nets possible, forming networks that traded mostly in [[salt]], [[iron]] and [[copper]].\n\n==Upemba culture==\nIn the 15th century, a society began to develop in the [[Lake Upemba|Upemba depression]] along the banks of the [[Lualaba River]] in [[Katanga Province|Katanga]]. This culture, known as the [[Upemba]], would eventually evolve into the more significant [[Luba Empire]], as well as the [[Kingdom of Lunda]].\n\nThe process in which the primitive original Upemba society transitioned into the Luba kingdom was gradual and complex. This transition ran without interruption, with several distinct societies developing out of the Upemba culture prior to the genesis of the Luba. Each of these societies based the foundation of their society on that of the one which preceded it (much in the way that many aspects of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] culture were borrowed from the [[Greeks]]). The 5th century saw this societal evolution develop in the area around present day [[Kamilamba]] at the [[Kabambasee]], which was followed and replaced by a number of other cultures which were based around the cities of [[Sanga, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Sanga]] and [[Katango]].\n\nThe region in which these cultures appeared is particularly rich in [[ore]] and these civilizations began to develop and implement [[iron]] and [[copper]] technology, in addition to trading in [[ivory trade|ivory]] and other goods. The Upemba established a strong commercial demand for their metal technologies and were able to institute a long-range commercial net (the business connections extended over 1500&nbsp;km, all the way to the [[Indian Ocean]]). Additionally, the region was endowed with favorable agricultural conditions and a wealth of [[fish]] and game.\n\nIts strong [[Economic system|economy]] and food-base allowed the region to become extremely wealthy. So wealthy, in fact, that cities and centralized government based on a [[tribal chief|chieftain]] system developed. The political institution of the chieftain became generally accepted and these rulers became increasingly powerful, especially at the end of the 16th century.\n\n==Effects of geography and climate==\nAdditionally, it must be mentioned that, as is this case today, the [[Congo River]] and its tributaries, as well as [[climate|climatic]] conditions in general, play a powerful role in shaping the lives of the inhabitants of the Congo. The [[river]]s are and were tremendously important to regional trade and provide a vast natural network for such activities, in addition to providing a source of food and water (which is needless to say, abundant) to the population.\n\nIt must also be mentioned that the climate is a major force in the Congo, which is made up primarily of [[tropical rainforest]] that sees some of the highest annual rainfall in the world. This high amount of [[rainfall]] makes it difficult to sustain [[agriculture]], and subsequently a large population because the [[soil]] is simply too watered-down and prone to periodic floods (which can ruin crops, of course) to produce large quantities of food. For this reason, the population of the Congo has maintained a low population in addition to an extremely low [[population density]].\n\nAlso, much has been made about the large number of primitive hunter-gatherer groups that inhabit the Congo, especially the Pygmy population. The reason for this particular life-style being so prominent in the Congo is [[geography|geographical]] and climatic: the area is simply not capable of producing a large amount of food from agriculture, and as a result, a portion of the population has continued to hunt and gather because it is a much more sustainable way of life.\n\n==Kingdom of Kongo (1390\u20131914)==\n{{main|Kingdom of Kongo}}\n\n[[Image:African-civilizations-map-pre-colonial.svg|thumb|550px|A map of pre-European African civilisations.]]\nThe dominant political force of the Congo region prior to and during the initial arrival of [[European ethnic groups|European]]s was the [[Kingdom of Kongo]]. The Kongo was a state located primarily in the southwest portion of the modern Congo, and also occupying portions of northern [[Angola]] and [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]]. At its greatest extent, the kingdom reached from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the west to the [[Kwango River]] in the east, and from the [[Point Noire]] in the north to the [[Loje River]] in the south.\n\nThe kingdom was headed by a king known as the [[Manikongo]], who exercised his authority over the six [[provinces]] that constituted the Kongo kingdom and the [[Bakongo]] (Kongo peoples). When the Kongo Kingdom was at its political apex in the 15th and 16th centuries, the King, who had to be a male descendant of Wene, reigned supreme.\n\nHe was elected by a group of governors, usually the heads of important families and occasionally including Portuguese officials. The activities of the [[court]] were supported by an extensive system of civil servants, and the court itself usually consisted of numerous male relatives of the King.\n\nThe villages were often governed by lesser relatives of the King who were responsible to him. All members of government were invested with their power under the auspices of a ritual specialist. The Manikongo personally appointed a kind of governor for each of the six provinces to oversee each from his capital, [[Mbanza-Kongo]]. The city is now known by the same name as the capital of an Angolan province, but was for a time renamed by the Manikongo to 'S\u00e3o Salvador' in an effort to adopt Portuguese culture.\n\nIn its prime, the Kingdom exacted taxes, forced labor, and collected fines from its citizens in order to prosper. At times, enslaved peoples, ivory, and copper were traded to the Europeans on the coast. The most important harbor was [[Mpinda]] (modern Soyo). In addition to the six provinces, the Kongo kingdom also established a [[sphere of influence]] in a number of outlying areas from which it was able to extract [[tribute]].\n\nThe kingdom was also at the center of an extensive Central African trade network in which it traded and produced large quantities of [[ivory]], as well as manufacturing copperware, raffia cloth, and pottery, along with other [[natural resources]] (The eastern region of the Congo [such as the province of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]]] is particularly rich in [[mineral]] resources, especially [[diamond]]s). These trade goods would also form, in addition to [[slaves]], the backbone of the Kongo's trade with Europeans (primarily the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]), upon their arrival.\n\nThe aforementioned slave trade was to be a significant factor in bringing about the end of Kongo, as the elites of the kingdom allowed European [[slave traders]] to eliminate a significant percentage of the population.\n\nWhen King \u00c1lvaro I, came to the throne in an environment of contestation in 1568, he immediately had to fight invaders from the east (who some authorities believe were actually rebels within the country, either peasants or discontented nobles) called the \"Jagas\". To do this, he had to enlist the aid of the Portuguese based at S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, who sent an expedition under Francisco de Gouveia Sottomaior to assist. At the same time, however, \u00c1lvaro had to allow the Portuguese to establish a colony in his province of Luanda in the south of his country.

The name \u201cKuba\u201d is derived from the term used by the Luba (whose kingdom lay to the south of the Kuba) for the civilization.\n\nBecause of its relative remoteness in the southern Congo, Kuba was largely spared the turmoil of both [[European ethnic groups|European]] and [[Arab]] slave trades. As a result, the civilization was able to maintain itself until the 19th century. Also due mainly to its location, even after [[Belgium]] officially established the [[Congo Free State]] in 1885, the Kuba were able to sustain their federation, which comprised some 100,000 square kilometers and had a population of approximately 150,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe Belgians began attempting to gain the acceptance of the Kuba in the early 1880s; however, the gifts Belgium attempted to give were always rejected and king [[aMbweeky aMileng]] threatened to behead any foreign intruders. As a result of their fear of white foreigners, it was not until the [[African-American]] missionary [[William Henry Sheppard|William Sheppard]] made contact with the Kuba that a foreigner would gain their acceptance. This was mainly due to his African blood and Sheppard was able to live amongst the Kuba for four months.\n\nEventually, after colonial officials were able to enforce their authority upon the Kuba near the end of the 19th century, the entire region became increasingly unstable. However, the well-organized Kuba fought relentlessly against the regime and the area was one of the main sectors of resistance to Belgium throughout its rule.\n\n==Other states==\nThe Kongo and the Kuba were the largest political entities in the precolonial Congo area. However, there were numerous other, much smaller states scattered throughout the territory in the north and northeast, with [[Pygmies]] and other primarily [[hunter-gatherer]] populations located mostly in the southern portions of the region.\n\nOf particular note is that the populations of the Eastern regions of the precolonial Congo were heavily disrupted by constant slaving, mainly from [[Zanzibari]] slave dealers such as the infamous [[Tippu Tip]] (though he would come after the Europeans' entrance onto the scene). The slave trade in this portion of Africa was primarily [[Arab]] in nature (in contrast to the European or [[Atlantic slave trade|Atlantic Slave Trade]], which took place primarily in West Africa, the [[Arab slave trade]] was located on the eastern coast of the continent), with captured persons being shipped off to the [[Middle East]] or to holdings of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian]] kingdoms for labor.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |last1=Vansina |first1=Jan |authorlink=Jan Vansina |title=Paths in the Rainforests: Toward a History of Political Tradition in Equatorial Africa |date=1990 |publisher=James Currey |location=Oxford |isbn=9780852550748}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Vansina |first1=Jan |authorlink=Jan Vansina |title=How Societies are Born: Governance in West Central Africa before 1600 |date=2005 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |isbn=9780813922805}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Vansina |first1=Jan |authorlink=Jan Vansina |title=The Children of Woot: A History of the Kuba Peoples |date=1978 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison |isbn=9780299074906}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Yoder |first1=John C. |title=The Kanyok of Zaire: an Institutional and Ideological History to 1895 |date=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=9780521412988}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Ndaywel \u00e8 Nziem |first1=Isidore |authorlink= Isidore Ndaywel \u00e8 Nziem |title=Nouvelle histoire du Congo : des origines \u00e0 la R\u00e9publique D\u00e9mocratique |date=2009 |publisher=Le Cri |location=Brussels |isbn=9782871065067}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Newbury |first1=David |authorlink=David Newbury |title=Kings and Clans: Ijwi Island and the Lake Kivu Rift, 1780-1840 |date=1992 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison |isbn=9780299128944}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Newbury |first1=David |authorlink=David Newbury |title=The Land beyond the Mists: Essays on Identity and Authority in Precolonial Congo and Rwanda |date=2009 |publisher=Ohio University Press |location=Athens |isbn=978-0-8214-1875-8}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Harms |first1=Robert |authorlink=Robert W.

As the modern territorial boundaries of the Democratic Republic of the Congo did not exist in this period, it is inseparable from the wider pre-colonial histories of [[Central Africa]], the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] and [[East African Rift|Rift Valley]] as well as the [[Atlantic World]] and [[Swahili coast]].\n\nThe current territory of the Democratic Republic of Congo was occupied by humans in the [[Paleolithic]] at least 80,000 years ago. Waves of [[Bantu expansion|Bantu migrations]] from 2000 BC to 500 AD moved into the basin from the northwest and covered the precolonial states absorbed or overthrown by the colonial powers.\n\nThe [[Bantu people|Bantu]] migrations added to and displaced the indigenous [[Pygmy peoples|Pygmy]] populations in the southern regions of the modern Congo states. The Bantu imported agriculture and iron-working techniques from [[West Africa]] into the area, as well as establishing the [[Bantu language]] family as the primary set of tongues for the Congolese. Subsequent migrations from the [[Darfur]] and [[Kurdufan]] regions of [[Sudan]] into the north of Congo, as well as [[East Africa]]ns migrating into the eastern [[Congo Basin|Congo]], added to the mix of ethnic groups.\n\n==Paleolithic==\n{{main|Central African foragers}}\nThe area now known as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] was populated as early as 80,000 years ago, as shown by the 1988 discovery of the [[Semliki harpoon]] at [[Katanda Territory|Katanda]], one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found, and which is believed to have been used to catch giant river catfish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/getting-food/katanda-bone-harpoon-point|title=Katanda Bone Harpoon Point|publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of National History|series=What Does It Mean to Be Human|date=February 9, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url = https://doi.org/10.1023%2FA%3A1021659928822 | doi=10.1023/A:1021659928822 | volume=15 | issue=3 | year=1998 | journal=African Archaeological Review | pages=173\u2013198 | last1 = Yellen | first1 = John E.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1960 the [[Ishango bone]] tool was discovered, fashioned from the [[fibula]] of a [[baboon]] with a sharp piece of [[quartz]] affixed to one end, perhaps for engraving.

The people living in the south and southwest were  hunter-gatherer groups, whose technology involved only minimal use of metal technologies. The development of metal tools during this time period revolutionized [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]]. This led to the displacement of the [[hunter-gatherer]] groups in the east and southeast.\n\nThe 10th century marked the final expansion of the Bantu in West-Central Africa.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}<!--[[Bantu expansion]] says 1000 BC-->\nRising population soon made intricate local, regional and foreign commercial nets possible, forming networks that traded mostly in [[salt]], [[iron]] and [[copper]].\n\n==Upemba culture==\nIn the 15th century, a society began to develop in the [[Lake Upemba|Upemba depression]] along the banks of the [[Lualaba River]] in [[Katanga Province|Katanga]]. This culture, known as the [[Upemba]], would eventually evolve into the more significant [[Luba Empire]], as well as the [[Kingdom of Lunda]].\n\nThe process in which the primitive original Upemba society transitioned into the Luba kingdom was gradual and complex. This transition ran without interruption, with several distinct societies developing out of the Upemba culture prior to the genesis of the Luba. Each of these societies based the foundation of their society on that of the one which preceded it (much in the way that many aspects of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] culture were borrowed from the [[Greeks]]). The 5th century saw this societal evolution develop in the area around present day [[Kamilamba]] at the [[Kabambasee]], which was followed and replaced by a number of other cultures which were based around the cities of [[Sanga, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Sanga]] and [[Katango]].\n\nThe region in which these cultures appeared is particularly rich in [[ore]] and these civilizations began to develop and implement [[iron]] and [[copper]] technology, in addition to trading in [[ivory trade|ivory]] and other goods. The Upemba established a strong commercial demand for their metal technologies and were able to institute a long-range commercial net (the business connections extended over 1500&nbsp;km, all the way to the [[Indian Ocean]]). Additionally, the region was endowed with favorable agricultural conditions and a wealth of [[fish]] and game.\n\nIts strong [[Economic system|economy]] and food-base allowed the region to become extremely wealthy. So wealthy, in fact, that cities and centralized government based on a [[tribal chief|chieftain]] system developed. The political institution of the chieftain became generally accepted and these rulers became increasingly powerful, especially at the end of the 16th century.\n\n==Effects of geography and climate==\nAdditionally, it must be mentioned that, as is this case today, the [[Congo River]] and its tributaries, as well as [[climate|climatic]] conditions in general, play a powerful role in shaping the lives of the inhabitants of the Congo. The [[river]]s are and were tremendously important to regional trade and provide a vast natural network for such activities, in addition to providing a source of food and water (which is needless to say, abundant) to the population.\n\nIt must also be mentioned that the climate is a major force in the Congo, which is made up primarily of [[tropical rainforest]] that sees some of the highest annual rainfall in the world. This high amount of [[rainfall]] makes it difficult to sustain [[agriculture]], and subsequently a large population because the [[soil]] is simply too watered-down and prone to periodic floods (which can ruin crops, of course) to produce large quantities of food. For this reason, the population of the Congo has maintained a low population in addition to an extremely low [[population density]].\n\nAlso, much has been made about the large number of primitive hunter-gatherer groups that inhabit the Congo, especially the Pygmy population. The reason for this particular life-style being so prominent in the Congo is [[geography|geographical]] and climatic: the area is simply not capable of producing a large amount of food from agriculture, and as a result, a portion of the population has continued to hunt and gather because it is a much more sustainable way of life.\n\n==Kingdom of Kongo (1390\u20131914)==\n{{main|Kingdom of Kongo}}\n\n[[Image:African-civilizations-map-pre-colonial.svg|thumb|550px|A map of pre-European African civilisations.]]\nThe dominant political force of the Congo region prior to and during the initial arrival of [[European ethnic groups|European]]s was the [[Kingdom of Kongo]]. The Kongo was a state located primarily in the southwest portion of the modern Congo, and also occupying portions of northern [[Angola]] and [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]]. At its greatest extent, the kingdom reached from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the west to the [[Kwango River]] in the east, and from the [[Point Noire]] in the north to the [[Loje River]] in the south.\n\nThe kingdom was headed by a king known as the [[Manikongo]], who exercised his authority over the six [[provinces]] that constituted the Kongo kingdom and the [[Bakongo]] (Kongo peoples). When the Kongo Kingdom was at its political apex in the 15th and 16th centuries, the King, who had to be a male descendant of Wene, reigned supreme.\n\nHe was elected by a group of governors, usually the heads of important families and occasionally including Portuguese officials. The activities of the [[court]] were supported by an extensive system of civil servants, and the court itself usually consisted of numerous male relatives of the King.\n\nThe villages were often governed by lesser relatives of the King who were responsible to him. All members of government were invested with their power under the auspices of a ritual specialist. The Manikongo personally appointed a kind of governor for each of the six provinces to oversee each from his capital, [[Mbanza-Kongo]]. The city is now known by the same name as the capital of an Angolan province, but was for a time renamed by the Manikongo to 'S\u00e3o Salvador' in an effort to adopt Portuguese culture.\n\nIn its prime, the Kingdom exacted taxes, forced labor, and collected fines from its citizens in order to prosper. At times, enslaved peoples, ivory, and copper were traded to the Europeans on the coast. The most important harbor was [[Mpinda]] (modern Soyo). In addition to the six provinces, the Kongo kingdom also established a [[sphere of influence]] in a number of outlying areas from which it was able to extract [[tribute]].\n\nThe kingdom was also at the center of an extensive Central African trade network in which it traded and produced large quantities of [[ivory]], as well as manufacturing copperware, raffia cloth, and pottery, along with other [[natural resources]] (The eastern region of the Congo [such as the province of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]]] is particularly rich in [[mineral]] resources, especially [[diamond]]s). These trade goods would also form, in addition to [[slaves]], the backbone of the Kongo's trade with Europeans (primarily the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]), upon their arrival.\n\nThe aforementioned slave trade was to be a significant factor in bringing about the end of Kongo, as the elites of the kingdom allowed European [[slave traders]] to eliminate a significant percentage of the population.\n\nWhen King \u00c1lvaro I, came to the throne in an environment of contestation in 1568, he immediately had to fight invaders from the east (who some authorities believe were actually rebels within the country, either peasants or discontented nobles) called the \"Jagas\". To do this, he had to enlist the aid of the Portuguese based at S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, who sent an expedition under Francisco de Gouveia Sottomaior to assist. At the same time, however, \u00c1lvaro had to allow the Portuguese to establish a colony in his province of Luanda in the south of his country. Kongo provided the Portuguese with support in their war against the Kingdom of [[Ndongo]], located in the interior east of [[Luanda]], when Portugal went to war with it in 1579. Eventually the Portuguese would gain control over most of the surrounding territory which led to increasing tensions with the Kongo.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Ambuila]] in 1665, the Portuguese forces from [[Angola]] defeated the forces of king [[Antonio I of Kongo]]; Antonio was killed with many of his courtiers and the Luso-African author [[Manuel Roboredo]], who had attempted to prevent this final war. Nevertheless, the country continued to exist, at least in name, for over two centuries, until the realm was divided among [[Portugal]], [[Belgium]], and [[France]] at the [[Conference of Berlin]] in 1884-1885.\n\n==Luba Kingdom (1585-1889)==\n[[File:Katanga-Kreuz.jpg|thumb|A \"[[Katanga Cross]]\", a form of pre-colonial [[money]] used in the [[Katanga]] and [[Copperbelt]] region testifies to pre-colonial mining and moulding of [[copper]] ]]\n{{Main|Luba Empire}}\n\nThe Luba Kingdom arose out of the [[Upemba]] culture and was founded by [[King Kongolo]] around 1585.

The name \u201cKuba\u201d is derived from the term used by the Luba (whose kingdom lay to the south of the Kuba) for the civilization.\n\nBecause of its relative remoteness in the southern Congo, Kuba was largely spared the turmoil of both [[European ethnic groups|European]] and [[Arab]] slave trades. As a result, the civilization was able to maintain itself until the 19th century. Also due mainly to its location, even after [[Belgium]] officially established the [[Congo Free State]] in 1885, the Kuba were able to sustain their federation, which comprised some 100,000 square kilometers and had a population of approximately 150,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe Belgians began attempting to gain the acceptance of the Kuba in the early 1880s; however, the gifts Belgium attempted to give were always rejected and king [[aMbweeky aMileng]] threatened to behead any foreign intruders. As a result of their fear of white foreigners, it was not until the [[African-American]] missionary [[William Henry Sheppard|William Sheppard]] made contact with the Kuba that a foreigner would gain their acceptance. This was mainly due to his African blood and Sheppard was able to live amongst the Kuba for four months.\n\nEventually, after colonial officials were able to enforce their authority upon the Kuba near the end of the 19th century, the entire region became increasingly unstable. However, the well-organized Kuba fought relentlessly against the regime and the area was one of the main sectors of resistance to Belgium throughout its rule.\n\n==Other states==\nThe Kongo and the Kuba were the largest political entities in the precolonial Congo area. However, there were numerous other, much smaller states scattered throughout the territory in the north and northeast, with [[Pygmies]] and other primarily [[hunter-gatherer]] populations located mostly in the southern portions of the region.\n\nOf particular note is that the populations of the Eastern regions of the precolonial Congo were heavily disrupted by constant slaving, mainly from [[Zanzibari]] slave dealers such as the infamous [[Tippu Tip]] (though he would come after the Europeans' entrance onto the scene). The slave trade in this portion of Africa was primarily [[Arab]] in nature (in contrast to the European or [[Atlantic slave trade|Atlantic Slave Trade]], which took place primarily in West Africa, the [[Arab slave trade]] was located on the eastern coast of the continent), with captured persons being shipped off to the [[Middle East]] or to holdings of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian]] kingdoms for labor.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |last1=Vansina |first1=Jan |authorlink=Jan Vansina |title=Paths in the Rainforests: Toward a History of Political Tradition in Equatorial Africa |date=1990 |publisher=James Currey |location=Oxford |isbn=9780852550748}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Vansina |first1=Jan |authorlink=Jan Vansina |title=How Societies are Born: Governance in West Central Africa before 1600 |date=2005 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |isbn=9780813922805}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Vansina |first1=Jan |authorlink=Jan Vansina |title=The Children of Woot: A History of the Kuba Peoples |date=1978 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison |isbn=9780299074906}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Yoder |first1=John C. |title=The Kanyok of Zaire: an Institutional and Ideological History to 1895 |date=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=9780521412988}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Ndaywel \u00e8 Nziem |first1=Isidore |authorlink= Isidore Ndaywel \u00e8 Nziem |title=Nouvelle histoire du Congo : des origines \u00e0 la R\u00e9publique D\u00e9mocratique |date=2009 |publisher=Le Cri |location=Brussels |isbn=9782871065067}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Newbury |first1=David |authorlink=David Newbury |title=Kings and Clans: Ijwi Island and the Lake Kivu Rift, 1780-1840 |date=1992 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison |isbn=9780299128944}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Newbury |first1=David |authorlink=David Newbury |title=The Land beyond the Mists: Essays on Identity and Authority in Precolonial Congo and Rwanda |date=2009 |publisher=Ohio University Press |location=Athens |isbn=978-0-8214-1875-8}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Harms |first1=Robert |authorlink=Robert W.

It was these two persons and their few colleagues who founded an organization with a fighting unit that bears the name of the Oromo people, although before them, many nationalists had fought and been martyred for the Oromo causes.\nIn addition, these men are credited with reviving and popularizing usage of the name ''Oromo'' in early 1970s.\n\n== Early life==\n\nAhmad Taqi was born to Sheikh Muhammad Rashid Bilal<ref name=\"BRAUK\">Ulrich Brauk\u00e4mper: ''Islamic History and Culture in Southern Ethiopia.

He is the third child born to the family of Sheikh Muhammad Rashid (but he becomes the fifth one if we count two children who died at infancy).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Interviews with Muteki Sheikh Muhammad Rashid, Gelemso, 2007</ref>\n\nAhmad Taqi lived in his early years at his birthplace, called Balbaletti in eastern [[Ethiopia]], in the Habro District of [[Hararghe]] province (modern-day [[Habro]] woreda in [[Mirab Hararghe Zone|West Hararghe Zone]] of the [[Oromia Region]]), and there he had studied [[Qur'an]] and other Islamic subjects, primarily under the tutorship of his father. Latter, he traveled in many areas of the Chercher Highlands with his elder brother Muttaqi Sheikh Muhammed-Rashid, and his favourite cousin Sheikh Abdinur Kabir Khalid. The three studied, under different masters, the major streams of Islamic Education, which included ''[[Nahw]]'' (Classical Arabic), ''[[Tafseer]]'' (Qur'anic exegesis), ''[[Hadith]]'', ''[[Sirah Rasul Allah|Sira]]'' (the traditions and life history of the Prophet), and other fields.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThey returned to continue their education once again at the center of Sheikh Muhammad Rashid. There, Ahmad Taqi learned not only Islamic courses, but also the history, culture, and ethnography of the Oromo people. Furthermore, he increased his knowledge in traditional Arabian and African Medicine.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhen he reached the age of 20, Ahmad Taqi moved to [[Gelemso]] town with his aforementioned brother, Muttaqi Sheikh Muhammad Rashid. They were joined by a third brother, Israfil. The three brothers started a business in the town, emerging as successful merchants in wholesale merchandising and the coffee trade. Throughout their career, all three brothers, especially [[Ahmad Taqi]], would support the poor and students of the area.\n\n== Career as an Oromo Nationalist ==\n\nLater on, he came to know General [[Taddese Birru]], one of the founders of [[Mecha and Tuluma Self-Help Association|Mecha and Tulama Self-Help Association]], who was under house arrest at that time in Gelemso. Tadesse and Ahmad Taqi began to teach the people that they have rights equal to those of the landlords of the area, and that being Oromo is not a curse, but a virtue to love. On his frequent travels to [[Dire Dawa]] and [[Addis Ababa]] (Finfine), he was  met by famous Oromo nationalists like Baro Tumsa, Jarra Abba Gada, and Ali Birra.<ref>Aladdin Alevi\u2019s interviews with Muttaqii Sheikh Mohammed Rashid, Haji Ahmed Alhadi (Gelemso), Mohammed Beker (Gelemso, 2006),Haji Ahmed Ashir (Addis Ababa, 2007), Ahmed Ibrahim (Ahmed Philips),Harar, 2008</ref>\n\n== His introduction to Elemo Kiltu ==\n\nIn September 1974, [[Haile Selassie I]] was confronted by the [[Derg]] in the [[Ethiopian Civil War|Ethiopian revolution]], and responded by abdicating from rulership. Ahmed Taqi had previously helped Taddese Birru escape house arrest, bringing him to Addis Ababa by night. At his stay in Addis Ababa, he met the activist Elemo Kiltu (also known as Hasan Ibrahim), who had returned from Syria to launch an armed struggle against the government. Elemo told Ahmad Taqi the idea of coming to Gelemso, and Ahmad Taqi accepted it.\n\n== Armed struggle ==\n\nIn May 1974, Elemo went to Gelemso, and made necessary arrangements to launch armed struggle against government authorities. He visited Sheikh Mohammed Rashid, Ahmad Taqi's father, and the sheikh advised him to begin the struggle in the mountains of Guba Koricha (50&nbsp;km north of Gelemso).\n\nElemo went with an army of 19 persons to Guba Koricha in June 1974. Then, he and his forces started to take measures against the rural landlords. They fought against the guards of Mulatu Tegegn, a notorious landlord who was harassing his Oromo tenants for higher rental shares of produce. Mulatu's guards killed Hajji Omar Khorchee instantly. The rebels then killed Mulatu and all his men, at a place called Hardim. Mulatu's dead body was brought to Gelemso. The landlord class were very angry, and vowed revenge. Local authorities started to detain suspects in the case. Ahmed Taqi was among the suspects, as he was prominent in preaching national pride and self governance for the Oromos.\n\nAhmad Taqi escaped arrest, and went to join the Oromo freedom army led by Elemo. As he was a merchant, he went with handful of money that might support the army with provisions. He met Elemo at a place called Bubbee (33&nbsp;km away from Gelemso town on the top of Bubbe mountain). The necessary arrangements were made for the leadership.

Finally, on September 6, 1974, both armies met each other at Tiro (26&nbsp;km East of Gelemso).

As the sheikh said, the name Oromo is a pride for Oromos today. Ahmad Taqi is still remembered when the Oromo freedom struggle is mentioned.\n\nAhmad Taqi was never married.

It was these two persons and their few colleagues who founded an organization with a fighting unit that bears the name of the Oromo people, although before them, many nationalists had fought and been martyred for the Oromo causes.\nIn addition, these men are credited with reviving and popularizing usage of the name ''Oromo'' in early 1970s.\n\n== Early life==\n\nAhmad Taqi was born to [[Sheikh Muhammad Rashid Bilal]]<ref name=\"BRAUK\">Ulrich Brauk\u00e4mper: ''Islamic History and Culture in Southern Ethiopia.

His mother was Mariyam Ahmad Hajji Salih Diimaa. He is the third child born to the family of Sheikh Muhammad Rashid (but he becomes the fifth one if we count two children who died at infancy).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Interviews with Muteki Sheikh Muhammad Rashid, Gelemso, 2007</ref>\n\nAhmad Taqi lived in his early years at his birthplace, called Balbaletti in eastern [[Ethiopia]], in the Habro District of [[Hararghe]] province (modern-day [[Habro]] woreda in [[Mirab Hararghe Zone|West Hararghe Zone]] of the [[Oromia Region]]), and there he had studied [[Qur'an]] and other Islamic subjects, primarily under the tutorship of his father. Latter, he traveled in many areas of the Chercher Highlands with his elder brother Muttaqi Sheikh Muhammed-Rashid, and his favourite cousin Sheikh Abdinur Kabir Khalid. The three studied, under different masters, the major streams of Islamic Education, which included ''[[Nahw]]'' (Classical Arabic), ''[[Tafseer]]'' (Qur'anic exegesis), ''[[Hadith]]'', ''[[Sirah Rasul Allah|Sira]]'' (the traditions and life history of the Prophet), and other fields.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThey returned to continue their education once again at the center of Sheikh Muhammad Rashid. There, Ahmad Taqi learned not only Islamic courses, but also the history, culture, and ethnography of the Oromo people. Furthermore, he increased his knowledge in traditional Arabian and African Medicine.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhen he reached the age of 20, Ahmad Taqi moved to [[Gelemso]] town with his aforementioned brother, Muttaqi Sheikh Muhammad Rashid. They were joined by a third brother, Israfil. The three brothers started a business in the town, emerging as successful merchants in wholesale merchandising and the coffee trade. Throughout their career, all three brothers, especially [[Ahmad Taqi]], would support the poor and students of the area.\n\n== Career as an Oromo Nationalist ==\n\nLater on, he came to know General [[Taddese Birru]], one of the founders of [[Mecha and Tuluma Self-Help Association|Mecha and Tulama Self-Help Association]], who was under house arrest at that time in Gelemso. Tadesse and Ahmad Taqi began to teach the people that they have rights equal to those of the landlords of the area, and that being Oromo is not a curse, but a virtue to love. On his frequent travels to [[Dire Dawa]] and [[Addis Ababa]] (Finfine), he was  met by famous Oromo nationalists like Baro Tumsa, Jarra Abba Gada, and Ali Birra.<ref>Aladdin Alevi\u2019s interviews with Muttaqii Sheikh Mohammed Rashid, Haji Ahmed Alhadi (Gelemso), Mohammed Beker (Gelemso, 2006),Haji Ahmed Ashir (Addis Ababa, 2007), Ahmed Ibrahim (Ahmed Philips),Harar, 2008</ref>\n\n== His introduction to Elemo Kiltu ==\n\nIn September 1974, [[Haile Selassie I]] was confronted by the [[Derg]] in the [[Ethiopian Civil War|Ethiopian revolution]], and responded by abdicating from rulership. Ahmed Taqi had previously helped Taddese Birru escape house arrest, bringing him to Addis Ababa by night. At his stay in Addis Ababa, he met the activist Elemo Kiltu (also known as Hasan Ibrahim), who had returned from Syria to launch an armed struggle against the government. Elemo told Ahmad Taqi the idea of coming to Gelemso, and Ahmad Taqi accepted it.\n\n== Armed struggle ==\n\nIn May 1974, Elemo went to Gelemso, and made necessary arrangements to launch armed struggle against government authorities. He visited Sheikh Mohammed Rashid, Ahmad Taqi's father, and the sheikh advised him to begin the struggle in the mountains of Guba Koricha (50&nbsp;km north of Gelemso).\n\nElemo went with an army of 19 persons to Guba Koricha in June 1974. Then, he and his forces started to take measures against the rural landlords. They fought against the guards of Mulatu Tegegn, a notorious landlord who was harassing his Oromo tenants for higher rental shares of produce. Mulatu's guards killed Hajji Omar Khorchee instantly. The rebels then killed Mulatu and all his men, at a place called Hardim. Mulatu's dead body was brought to Gelemso. The landlord class were very angry, and vowed revenge. Local authorities started to detain suspects in the case. Ahmed Taqi was among the suspects, as he was prominent in preaching national pride and self governance for the Oromos.\n\nAhmad Taqi escaped arrest, and went to join the Oromo freedom army led by Elemo. As he was a merchant, he went with handful of money that might support the army with provisions. He met Elemo at a place called Bubbee (33&nbsp;km away from Gelemso town on the top of Bubbe mountain). The necessary arrangements were made for the leadership. Elemo was chosen as the chairperson, and Ahmed Taqi was made the commander of the army.\n\nThe army of Oromo freedom fighters began more hostile actions and more resistance against the Ethiopian armed forces. Ahmed Taqi was given a nickname \"Hundee\" by his army. But the name had long been used by his father.\n\nAs the Ethiopian armed forces were seizing power from Haile Selassie in a military junta (Derg), they sent an army led by General Getachew Shibeshi eastward.
