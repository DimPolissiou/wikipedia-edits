It launched the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] with the objective of ending British monarchical rule over Ireland and founding a sovereign, independent Irish republic.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:United irishmen 1.jpg|thumb|<center>The United Irishmen</center>]]\n\nDuring the 1780s, a few liberal members of the ruling [[Protestant Ascendancy]], organised as the [[Irish Patriot Party]] led by [[Henry Grattan]], campaigned for the following: reform of the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]], a lessening of British interference in Ireland's affairs, and expanding the rights and voting franchise for Catholics and Presbyterians. Supporting them was the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Irish Volunteers]] movement, which had widespread Protestant support. Whilst they had limited success such as the establishment of [[Grattan's Parliament]] and the repeal of some of the discriminatory [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], they fell short of many of their aims. When the parliamentary reform movement collapsed in 1784, it left radicals without a political cause.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nBy the mid-1780s, radicalism in Ireland was taking a new, bolder form, typified by the letters penned by [[William Drennan]], which were published in the ''[[Belfast Newsletter]]'' and in pamphlets.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> In them he hit out at leaders of the Volunteers such as Grattan and Charlemont for their conservatism and restraint, and at the political establishment for preventing the reform of the Irish Parliament.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Most notably was his appeal for all Anglicans, Dissenters, and Roman Catholics to unite as one indifferent association, however he accepted that this would only appeal to the minority within each denomination.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Inspiring and increasing the radicalisation of Irish reformists was the [[French Revolution]] which had started in 1789, and had so far remained largely bloodless, with the French king forced to concede effective power to a National Assembly.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nAlso in 1778 the [[Whigs (Irish political party)|Whig party]] was founded in Ireland and soon it became an alliance of radicals, reform-minded parliamentarians, and dissident representatives of the governing class.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> By 1791 this alliance however was already fracturing, and several rival Whig clubs were set up by people such as [[Napper Tandy]] in Dublin and Belfast.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Another grouping was a \"shadowy\" organisation of eleven people headed by [[Samuel Neilson]], that sought to move the recently revived Volunteer movement in as far a radical direction as possible.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\n==Foundation==\n[[File:United Irishmen, Dublin.jpg|thumb|Plaque on the site of the Eagle Tavern, [[Eustace Street]], [[Dublin]], where the Dublin branch adopted Tone's resolutions on 9 November 1791.]]\nThe enthusiasm for the French Revolution saw great Irish interest in [[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[Rights of Man]]'', released in May 1791, which defended it and saw around 20,000 cheap copies printed for digest in Ireland.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> A couple of months later, the Belfast Volunteer company gathered to celebrate the second anniversary of the fall of the Bastille.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> It was intended that a new radical society was to be announced during the celebrations which William Drennan, who was to give a declaration, asked to add in resolutions.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Drennan refused, due to the short notice of the request, and suggested that [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]] be asked.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nTone's reformist radicalism had advanced beyond that of the Whigs, and he proposed three resolutions for the new society, which he named the ''Society of United Irishmen''.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The first resolution was for the denouncing of the continuing interference of the British establishment in Irish affairs.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The second was for the full reform of the Irish Parliament and its representation.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The last resolution called for a union of religious faiths in Ireland to \"abolish the differences that had long divided Irishmen\" and sought to give Catholics political rights.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> This last proposal however was quietly dropped by the Belfast Volunteers to ensure unanimity for the proposals amongst the people.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nThis seemed to delay the launch of the new society and by August 1791, Tone in response to the rebuff of his third resolution, published the popular and robust ''An Argument on Behalf of the Catholics of Ireland'', which argued why they should be included in attempts at reform.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> That October, Tone was invited to a debate on the creation of a new society by a group of people including Neilson.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Here he found that his resolutions were now found a few months later to be \"too tame\".<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> A new set of resolutions were drafted and agreed to on 14 October, which the Belfast branch of the Society of United Irishmen adopted on 18 October, and the Dublin branch on 9 November.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The main problem they identified for Ireland was the issue of national sovereignty:\n\n{{cquote|We have no national government; we are ruled by Englishmen, and thus servants of Englishmen, whose object is the interest of another country, whose instrument is corruption; whose strength is the weakness of Ireland.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>}}\n\nAll attendees at the first meeting of the Belfast branch were Protestant. Two ([[Theobald Wolfe Tone]] and [[Thomas Russell (rebel)|Thomas Russell]]) were [[Anglican]]s and the rest Presbyterian; most of whom were involved in the linen trade in Belfast. Along with Tone and Russell, the men involved were: [[William Sinclair (United Irishmen)|William Sinclair]], [[Henry Joy McCracken]], Samuel Neilson, [[Henry Haslett (United Irishmen)|Henry Haslett]], [[Gilbert McIlveen]], William Simms, [[Robert Simms (United Irishmen)|Robert Simms]], [[Thomas McCabe (United Irishmen)|Thomas McCabe]], [[William Tennant (United Irishmen)|William Tennant]], and Thomas Pearce.<ref>Cronin, Sea. ''Irish Nationalism: A History of Its Roots and Ideology''. Dublin: Academy, 1980.</ref> After forming, the Society named chandler [[Samuel McTier]] as its first President.\n\n===Movement spreads===\n[[File:Northern star.jpg|thumbnail|400px|[[Masthead (British publishing)|Masthead]] of the ''[[Northern Star (newspaper of the Society of United Irishmen)|Northern Star]]'']]\n[[File:1798 poem, Wexford 2.jpg|thumb|United Irish \"catechism\" carved in stone in [[Wexford]]. It makes explicit the connections of the United Irishmen with revolution in American and France.]]\nAs 1793 drew to a close there were references to other lesser branches of the United Irishmen in a number of places such as: [[Armagh]], [[Clonmel]], [[Limerick]], and [[Lisburn]], yet Belfast and Dublin retained their primacy.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The popularity of the society continued to grow throughout Ulster especially amongst the Presbyterians. In 1795 the United Irishmen linked up with the [[Defenders (Ireland)|Defenders]], a Catholic agrarian secret society.\n\nThe movement quickly developed a strategy of spreading its ideals by means of pamphlets, leaflets, newspapers, ballads, \"catechisms\" and travelling emissaries. Whilst the ''[[Belfast Newsletter]]'' was a liberal newspaper, the society sought the publication of a more radical one in Belfast, resulting in the ''[[Northern Star (newspaper of the Society of United Irishmen)|Northern Star]]''.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> It was especially successful, both commercially and politically, and had a wide readership until its suppression in 1797.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nThe spread of the Society was watched with growing alarm by the authorities, and it was banned in 1793 following the declaration of war by [[Revolutionary France|France]].\n\n==Differences of opinion==\nMembers of the United Irishmen had a varied range of differing and divisive views and opinions on different matters, some of which persisted even when the society had moved firmly in one direction. Whilst many of the divisions were between members, there were also some between the Belfast and Dublin branches.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nA problem in forming policies troubled the early years of the society. Issues such as universal male suffrage, restricting the franchise, and secret balloting etc. divided members of both the Belfast and Dublin branches. It has been suggested that one of the issues behind these differences was how the bulk of the population \u2014 who were property-less and thus without a vote \u2014 would use empowerment other than in a destructive manner.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nAnother divisive issue was that of Ireland's relationship with Britain.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The United Irishmen from the onset sought a fully independent and representative parliament for Ireland free from the interference of the British establishment, however retaining the [[Union of Crowns]] \u2014 ideals that followed those of the [[Irish Patriot Party|Patriot Party]].<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Some such as Tone however thought that complete separation would be a blessing for Ireland, yet refrained from mentioning anything of the sort in the society's resolutions.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The silence Tone showed at this time on the issue was no doubt shared by others, yet there were those who opposed such an idea.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> By the time the society had resolved to establishing an all out republic and instigated the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] to achieve it, there were still members who sought the retention of a shared monarch as long as Ireland had a free parliament.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nIn regards to cultural identity the time of the Patriot Party and the Volunteers in the late 1770s and early 1780s saw cultural nationalism become a central theme of the reformist tradition.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Yet cultural nationalism remained independent of political leanings, and even within the United Irishmen there were those such as Tone himself, who had no interest in it at all.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nBy 1794, the authorities had increased their suppression of the United Irishmen, and possibly as a result, they came up with the  extremely radical proposal for annually elected parliaments, with 300 equally-sized electoral districts where all males over the age of 21 would have a vote.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The Dublin society however would not commit to the abolition of the House of Lords, or even to the removal of the monarchy.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nThe makeup and conduct of the two main branches of the United Irishmen also revealed stark differences. The Belfast society was predominantly made up of a close-knit group of middle-class Presbyterians from the town, headed by an internal committee that met in secret.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The Dublin branch however held its meetings in public, and of its membership of 400, 140 are identified as being Catholic, whereas only 130 could be identified as Protestants.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> This membership consisted of people from a  wide range of occupations, including around 50 members from outside Dublin itself.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> When the Dublin society was recommended by Neilson from the Belfast society to form an inner committee to thwart informants, they outright refused.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\n==Catholic rights and emancipation==\nThe ideal of religious equality and [[Catholic Emancipation]] was a central commitment of the United Irishmen.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The reform movement on the early 1780s was limited to the Protestant minority in Ireland, and this was seen as key to the failure of it to gain emancipation.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Some such as Tone realised that this movement was \"built on too narrow a foundation\", and that for it to be successful it would need the support of Catholics themselves.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nIn 1790 the [[Catholic Convention]], which had lain dormant since 1784, was revived, seeking further reforms and relief bills for Irish Catholics.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Some Catholic Committee members such as [[John Keogh]] had already joined the United Irishmen, with Tone appointed secretary of the Committee.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The Committee would show a high level of political dexterity in campaigning for its aims.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nIn 1791, the British parliament passed the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791]], which gave some concession. In 1792, a town meeting in Belfast, saw a declaration in favour of full Catholic emancipation, opposing suggestions for a gradual process.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> In an attempt to prevent a union of the Catholic Committee and radicalised Protestants, the government during 1792 passed yet more bills repealing laws against Catholics.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Despite this, whilst they could appeal for further civil rights, Catholics were to be firmly refused political enfranchisement.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> This refusal only help cause the union that the establishment had been seeking to prevent.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nWhen the next Bastille Day celebrations were to be held that July, volunteer companies from throughout Ulster gathered in Belfast, such support was not secure.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Tone remarked that some of the volunteer companies who had gathered were no better than the sectarian anti-Catholic [[Peep o' Day Boys]] movement.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Despite having a resolution for full religious equality passed, it required nervous prior discussion, with the exact wording of it being changed so that: \"Irishmen of all religious denominations\" was changed to simply \"Catholic\".<ref name=\"Connolly\"/><ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nThe methods employed by the Catholic Committee to advance their cause caused mixed feelings amongst the United Irishmen, with some fearing that if things advanced too far, then they would lose the moderate conservatives in the society.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Drennan also observed that the Catholics sought to have \"two strings to their bow\" so that if one failed they could try the other, in reference to either working with the government or the Protestant radicals to achieve their aims.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nBy working together the Committee and United Irishmen had in 1793 earned more concessions for Catholics, resulting in the winding up of the committee and thus an end to their alliance.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> In a parting show of support the Committee declared its support for parliamentary reform.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Emancipation however had still not been secured, and the United Irishmen continued to press for it.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\n==1793\u201397==\nFollowing the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French declaration of war on Britain]] in February 1793, the movement was outlawed and went underground from 1794 as they became more determined to force a revolt against British rule. The leadership was divided into those who wished to wait for French aid before rising and the more radical elements that wished to press ahead regardless. However, the suppression of a bloody preemptive rebellion, which broke out in [[county Leitrim|Leitrim]] in 1793, led to the former faction prevailing and links were forged with the revolutionary French government with instructions to wait sent to all of the United Irish membership.\n\nWorried by its presence, the Dublin administration conceded some reforms, allowing Catholics the vote, to become barristers and to enroll at [[Trinity College Dublin]] in 1793. The [[Hearth Tax]], paid by all households, was abolished in 1795, and [[St Patrick's College, Maynooth|St Patrick's seminary]] at Maynooth was founded. Catholics were also expected to join the militia and to inform on any United Irish activities.\n\nIn 1794, [[William Drennan]] became the first leader to be arrested and tried for sedition as the authorities began to react to the growth of the United Irishmen, followed by the [[Reverend William Jackson]]. In 1795 the loyalty of the hierarchy of the [[Catholic church]] was confirmed with the founding of [[St Patrick's College, Maynooth|Maynooth College]]. At that stage, the Church and the French republic were enemies because of the [[dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution]].\n\nA [[Exp\u00e9dition d'Irlande|French fleet]] carrying 15,000 troops set sail for Ireland in 1796, under [[Louis Lazare Hoche|General Hoche]] and spent days in sight of the [[County Cork|Cork]] coast at [[Bantry Bay]] but weather conditions prevented its landing, and its remnants not wrecked or captured returned to France. The [[British government]] responded to the threat it represented by sweeping up much of the United Irish leadership. It imposed [[martial law]] from 2 March 1797 in an attempt to break the movement by the widespread use of terror during searches for weapons.\n\n==1798 Rebellion==\n{{Main|Irish Rebellion of 1798}}\nBy early 1798, the United Irish membership on the ground (by now 280,000 sworn members) was under severe pressure, suffering from the terror of a roving campaign of disarmament while under instructions to do nothing until the arrival of French aid. French support was always a dilemma for the movement. Without it, a successful rebellion would see Ireland easily cordoned off by the [[Royal Navy]]; with it, the movement would be seen as fighting to become yet another \"[[Sister republic]]\" that would be exploited and controlled by the [[French Directory]].\n\nIn March 1798, the bulk of the leadership was arrested and preemptive risings had already broken out in Tipperary but indecision still divided the rump leadership. Finally, the unrelenting pressure led the militant faction of the United Irishmen to set the date for a general uprising on 23 May without French aid. However, information from the [[informant|informer]]s Thomas Reynolds and [[Francis Magan]] led to the arrests of [[Lord Edward Fitzgerald]] and Samuel Neilson shortly before the rising but more crucially foiled the planned rising in Dublin which was to be the central core of the planned rebellion. On the 5 June, [[Sir Edward Crosbie]] of [[Carlow]] became the first United Irishman to be executed for [[treason]].\n[[File:20101225131825Archibel Wilsonheadstone.jpg|thumb|left|The grave in [[Bangor Abbey]], [[County Down]], of United Irishman Archibel Wilson, who was hanged for his part in the 1798 rebellion.]]\n\nGeneral Napper Tandy, a leader of the uprising, authored a proclamation entitled 'Liberty or Death': \"Can you think of entering into a treaty with a British Minister? A Minister too, who has left you at the mercy of an English soldiery, who has laid your cities waste, and massacred inhumanely your best Citizens ... Horrid crimes have been perpetrated in your country, your friends have fallen a sacrifice to their devotion to your cause, and their shadows are around you and call for vengeance ... wage a war of extermination against your oppressors, the war of Liberty against tyranny, and Liberty shall Triumph.\"<ref>''Liberty or Death'', by James Napper Tandy, 1798</ref>\n\nNevertheless, tens of thousands rose in the surrounding counties, only around 10% of the 280,000 membership. The resulting [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] was severely hampered by the lack of leadership and was crushed with vicious brutality. The campaign met with little success except in [[County Wexford|Wexford]] where a number of massacres of loyalist civilians who were largely Protestant raised the spectre of sectarianism which was seized upon by enemies of the United Irishmen to weaken their non-sectarian appeal. The eventual arrival of 1,000 French troops in Killala, [[County Mayo]] in August was too little and too late to turn the tide for the United Irishmen. In October, [[Wolfe Tone]] himself was captured when a supporting French fleet of 3,000 troops was [[Battle of Tory Island|intercepted and defeated]] by the [[Royal Navy]] near [[Lough Swilly]].\n\nUpon his capture, Wolfe Tone said, \"From my earliest youth I have regarded the connection between Ireland and Great Britain as the curse of the Irish nation, and felt convinced, that while it lasted, this country would never be free or happy. In consequence, I determined to apply all the powers which my individual efforts could move, in order to separate the two countries.\" After being denied a soldier's death by firing squad, Wolfe Tone cheated the hangman by cutting his own throat.\n\nThe suppression of the rising was followed by a period of renewed repression of the United Irishmen as the general amnesty offered by [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]] [[Cornwallis in Ireland|Cornwallis]] specifically excluded rebel leaders many of whom were United Irishmen. However the United Irishmen still managed to survive as both a functioning clandestine organisation, especially in Dublin and as a military force with several rebel bands still active, though severely reduced and confined to a few counties.\n\n==Desertion of the United Irishmen cause==\nPrior to uprising in County Antrim, some Belfast merchants who had been ardent supporters of revolution, abandoned the radical cause for economic reasons.<ref name=\"ATQ\">Stewart, A.T.Q., ''1798 in the North''.

While the United Irish had declared themselves to be non-sectarian from 1791, there were other liberal Protestants in the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] who were also anti-sectarian and sought a more democratic franchise, such as [[Henry Grattan]] and [[John Philpot Curran]]. Although the United Irishmen was a staunchly non-[[sectarianism|sectarian]] body which sought to unite all Irishmen, regardless of religion or descent many among their ranks were former [[Defenders (Ireland)|Defenders]], a term applied to many loosely connected, exclusively Catholic, agrarian resistance groups. Many of these men, as well as their [[Presbyterian]] counterparts in Ulster, had been shaped by the sectarianism that was prevalent in eighteenth century Ireland and it was no mean feat to persuade Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter to put aside their differences and view each other simply as fellow Irishmen. Although the project met with remarkable success, it was quickly recognised by the establishment that sectarianism was a useful ally in the fight against the United Irishmen.\n\nThe formation of the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]] in 1795 was to prove particularly useful as it provided the government with allies who had detailed local knowledge of the activities of their enemies. The brutal disarming of Ulster in 1797, where the United Irish had successfully radicalised both Presbyterians and Catholics, saw thousands of Catholics driven from counties [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Down|Down]] and [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and the murder, torture and imprisonment of hundreds of Protestants suspected of United Irish sympathies.\n\nAlso in 1795 the Dublin administration funded the new [[St Patrick's College, Maynooth|St Patrick's College]] seminary for Roman Catholic priests, which ensured the support of the Irish Catholic hierarchy. The church was opposed to republicanism, though individual priests were supportive. The French government that supported the United Irish had engaged in a policy of \"[[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|dechristianisation]]\" for some years, and in February 1798 its army had expelled [[Pope Pius VI]] from Rome and formed the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|\"Roman Republic\"]]. The Irish Catholic hierarchy remained totally opposed to the United Irish policy, and came to see the removal of the Protestant Irish Parliament by an [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union]] as a part of the solution to the social grievances of its members. This inevitable quiet opposition was clear, and made a huge difference in 1798, but was often played down by nationalist historians in the 1800s, being mostly Catholic.\n\nOn the other hand, some Protestant historians such as Musgrave tended to play up the rebellion as another sectarian peasant ''jacquerie'', similar to the [[1641 Irish Rebellion|1641 Rebellion]] and owing nothing to progressive ideals.\n\nReligious division and hatred was, therefore, never completely buried and a minority of the Defenders did not reject completely their previous anti-Protestant outlook. During the course of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]], the Defenders who had risen with the United Irishmen perpetrated several sectarian massacres, most notoriously in [[County Wexford]] at [[Scullabogue Barn Massacre|Scullabogue]] and Wexford Bridge. While sectarianism undoubtedly played a part in many murders during the rising, religion was often taken as a signifier of loyalty or disloyalty by both sides and the fact that Protestants were often among the perpetrators and Catholics among the victims of rebel massacres indicates that victims lost their lives for being perceived as loyalists as opposed to purely religious reasons. Such subtleties were ignored in the aftermath, as the memory of such massacres was simplified and exploited in following years by politicians to cement the sectarian divide and to ensure the loyalty of Protestants to the British Crown.\n\n==After 1798==\nThe decision to abolish the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] resulting in the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] in 1800, which came into force on the 1st January 1801 and created the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], played on sectarian hopes and fears and was to gradually erode the United Irishmen by playing Catholic against Protestant. This was despite the original recognition that the \"bigotry\" (to quote Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]]) of the Protestant Parliament in [[Dublin]] had only contributed to sedition in Ireland.\n\nThe failure of [[Robert Emmet]]'s rebellion in 1803 triggered the effective collapse of the Society of United Irishmen. The last armed rebel group led by [[James Corcoran]] was destroyed in 1804 and the first half of the 19th century saw sectarianism replace separatism as the touchstone for political unrest in Ireland. Not until the [[Young Ireland]] movement in the 1840s was an attempt made to resurrect the non-sectarian ideals of the United Irishmen. However, the alliance between Catholic and Protestant was never fully regained as Protestants were drawn closer to a \"British\" identity through fear of having a perceived position of privilege eroded by the slowly growing political power of the Catholic majority. As a consequence, subsequent organised [[Irish republicanism|republican]] resistance to British rule in Ireland was largely confined to the Catholic population and seen as a threat by the majority of the Protestant population.\n<!--PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABEITCAL ORDER-->\n\n==See also==\n*[[Radicalism (historical)]]\n*[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Fils de la Libert\u00e9]] in Quebec\n*[[United Irish Uprising in Newfoundland]]\n*[[United Scotsmen]] in Scotland\n<!--*[[List of United Irishmen]]-->\n\n;Selected Members\n*[[William Drennan]]\n*[[Michael Dwyer]]\n*[[Thomas Russell (rebel)|Thomas Russell]]\n*[[Robert Emmet]]\n*[[Thomas Addis Emmet]]\n*[[Bagenal Harvey]] (United Irishmen commander)\n*[[James Hope (Ireland)|James Hope]]\n* [[William James MacNeven]]\n*[[Henry Joy McCracken]]\n*[[Leonard McNally]] (informer)\n*[[Thomas Muir (political reformer)]]\n*[[Samuel Neilson]]\n*[[James Orr (poet)|James Orr]]\n*[[William Orr (United Irishman)|William Orr]]\n*[[Thomas Paine]] (Honorary member)<ref name=\"Pryce-Jones2013\">{{cite book|author=David Pryce-Jones|title=Treason of the Heart: From Thomas Paine to Kim Philby|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xkMCHUn4UEEC&pg=PA13|date=10 October 2013|publisher=Encounter Books|isbn=978-1-59403-549-4|page=13}}</ref>\n*[[Archibald Hamilton Rowan]]\n*[[William Sampson (attorney)|William Sampson]]\n*[[The Sheares Brothers]]\n*[[James Napper Tandy]]\n*[[William Tennant]]\n*[[Theobald Wolfe Tone]]\n*[[Staker Wallace]]\n*[[James Dempsey (builder)|James Dempsey]]\n\n;Fictional Members\n*[[Stephen Maturin]]\n\n{{Irish Rebellion of 1798|state=expanded}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Connolly\">{{Cite book |title=Divided Kingdom; Ireland 1630-1800 |author=Sean J.

It launched the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] with the objective of ending British monarchical rule over Ireland and founding a sovereign, independent Irish republic.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:United irishmen 1.jpg|thumb|<center>The United Irishmen</center>]]\n\nDuring the 1780s, a few liberal members of the ruling [[Protestant Ascendancy]], organised as the [[Irish Patriot Party]] led by [[Henry Grattan]], campaigned for the following: reform of the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]], a lessening of British interference in Ireland's affairs, and expanding the rights and voting franchise for Catholics and Presbyterians. Supporting them was the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Irish Volunteers]] movement, which had widespread Protestant support. Whilst they had limited success such as the establishment of [[Grattan's Parliament]] and the repeal of some of the discriminatory [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], they fell short of many of their aims. When the parliamentary reform movement collapsed in 1784, it left radicals without a political cause.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nBy the mid-1780s, radicalism in Ireland was taking a new, bolder form, typified by the letters penned by [[William Drennan]], which were published in the ''[[Belfast Newsletter]]'' and in pamphlets.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> In them he hit out at leaders of the Volunteers such as Grattan and Charlemont for their conservatism and restraint, and at the political establishment for preventing the reform of the Irish Parliament.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Most notably was his appeal for all Anglicans, Dissenters, and Roman Catholics to unite as one indifferent association, however he accepted that this would only appeal to the minority within each denomination.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Inspiring and increasing the radicalisation of Irish reformists was the [[French Revolution]] which had started in 1789, and had so far remained largely bloodless, with the French king forced to concede effective power to a National Assembly.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nAlso in 1778 the [[Whigs (Irish political party)|Whig party]] was founded in Ireland and soon it became an alliance of radicals, reform-minded parliamentarians, and dissident representatives of the governing class.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> By 1791 this alliance however was already fracturing, and several rival Whig clubs were set up by people such as [[Napper Tandy]] in Dublin and Belfast.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Another grouping was a \"shadowy\" organisation of eleven people headed by [[Samuel Neilson]], that sought to move the recently revived Volunteer movement in as far a radical direction as possible.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\n==Foundation==\n[[File:United Irishmen, Dublin.jpg|thumb|Plaque on the site of the Eagle Tavern, [[Eustace Street]], [[Dublin]], where the Dublin branch adopted Tone's resolutions on 9 November 1791.]]\nThe enthusiasm for the French Revolution saw great Irish interest in [[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[Rights of Man]]'', released in May 1791, which defended it and saw around 20,000 cheap copies printed for digest in Ireland.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> A couple of months later, the Belfast Volunteer company gathered to celebrate the second anniversary of the fall of the Bastille.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> It was intended that a new radical society was to be announced during the celebrations which William Drennan, who was to give a declaration, asked to add in resolutions.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Drennan refused, due to the short notice of the request, and suggested that [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]] be asked.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nTone's reformist radicalism had advanced beyond that of the Whigs, and he proposed three resolutions for the new society, which he named the ''Society of United Irishmen''.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The first resolution was for the denouncing of the continuing interference of the British establishment in Irish affairs.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The second was for the full reform of the Irish Parliament and its representation.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The last resolution called for a union of religious faiths in Ireland to \"abolish the differences that had long divided Irishmen\" and sought to give Catholics political rights.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> This last proposal however was quietly dropped by the Belfast Volunteers to ensure unanimity for the proposals amongst the people.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nThis seemed to delay the launch of the new society and by August 1791, Tone in response to the rebuff of his third resolution, published the popular and robust ''An Argument on Behalf of the Catholics of Ireland'', which argued why they should be included in attempts at reform.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> That October, Tone was invited to a debate on the creation of a new society by a group of people including Neilson.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Here he found that his resolutions were now found a few months later to be \"too tame\".<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> A new set of resolutions were drafted and agreed to on 14 October, which the Belfast branch of the Society of United Irishmen adopted on 18 October, and the Dublin branch on 9 November.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The main problem they identified for Ireland was the issue of national sovereignty:\n\n{{cquote|We have no national government; we are ruled by Englishmen, and thus servants of Englishmen, whose object is the interest of another country, whose instrument is corruption; whose strength is the weakness of Ireland.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>}}\n\nAll attendees at the first meeting of the Belfast branch were Protestant. Two ([[Theobald Wolfe Tone]] and [[Thomas Russell (rebel)|Thomas Russell]]) were [[Anglican]]s and the rest Presbyterian; most of whom were involved in the linen trade in Belfast. Along with Tone and Russell, the men involved were: [[William Sinclair (United Irishmen)|William Sinclair]], [[Henry Joy McCracken]], Samuel Neilson, [[Henry Haslett (United Irishmen)|Henry Haslett]], [[Gilbert McIlveen]], William Simms, [[Robert Simms (United Irishmen)|Robert Simms]], [[Thomas McCabe (United Irishmen)|Thomas McCabe]], [[William Tennant (United Irishmen)|William Tennant]], and Thomas Pearce.<ref>Cronin, Sea.

It makes explicit the connections of the United Irishmen with revolution in American and France.]]\nAs 1793 drew to a close there were references to other lesser branches of the United Irishmen in a number of places such as: [[Armagh]], [[Clonmel]], [[Limerick]], and [[Lisburn]], yet Belfast and Dublin retained their primacy.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The popularity of the society continued to grow throughout Ulster especially amongst the Presbyterians. In 1795 the United Irishmen linked up with the [[Defenders (Ireland)|Defenders]], a Catholic agrarian secret society.\n\nThe movement quickly developed a strategy of spreading its ideals by means of pamphlets, leaflets, newspapers, ballads, \"catechisms\" and travelling emissaries. Whilst the ''[[Belfast Newsletter]]'' was a liberal newspaper, the society sought the publication of a more radical one in Belfast, resulting in the ''[[Northern Star (newspaper of the Society of United Irishmen)|Northern Star]]''.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> It was especially successful, both commercially and politically, and had a wide readership until its suppression in 1797.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nThe spread of the Society was watched with growing alarm by the authorities, and it was banned in 1793 following the declaration of war by [[Revolutionary France|France]].\n\n==Differences of opinion==\nMembers of the United Irishmen had a varied range of differing and divisive views and opinions on different matters, some of which persisted even when the society had moved firmly in one direction. Whilst many of the divisions were between members, there were also some between the Belfast and Dublin branches.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nA problem in forming policies troubled the early years of the society. Issues such as universal male suffrage, restricting the franchise, and secret balloting etc. divided members of both the Belfast and Dublin branches. It has been suggested that one of the issues behind these differences was how the bulk of the population \u2014 who were property-less and thus without a vote \u2014 would use empowerment other than in a destructive manner.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nAnother divisive issue was that of Ireland's relationship with Britain.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The United Irishmen from the onset sought a fully independent and representative parliament for Ireland free from the interference of the British establishment, however retaining the [[Union of Crowns]] \u2014 ideals that followed those of the [[Irish Patriot Party|Patriot Party]].<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Some such as Tone however thought that complete separation would be a blessing for Ireland, yet refrained from mentioning anything of the sort in the society's resolutions.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The silence Tone showed at this time on the issue was no doubt shared by others, yet there were those who opposed such an idea.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> By the time the society had resolved to establishing an all out republic and instigated the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] to achieve it, there were still members who sought the retention of a shared monarch as long as Ireland had a free parliament.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nIn regards to cultural identity the time of the Patriot Party and the Volunteers in the late 1770s and early 1780s saw cultural nationalism become a central theme of the reformist tradition.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Yet cultural nationalism remained independent of political leanings, and even within the United Irishmen there were those such as Tone himself, who had no interest in it at all.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nBy 1794, the authorities had increased their suppression of the United Irishmen, and possibly as a result, they came up with the  extremely radical proposal for annually elected parliaments, with 300 equally-sized electoral districts where all males over the age of 21 would have a vote.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The Dublin society however would not commit to the abolition of the House of Lords, or even to the removal of the monarchy.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nThe makeup and conduct of the two main branches of the United Irishmen also revealed stark differences. The Belfast society was predominantly made up of a close-knit group of middle-class Presbyterians from the town, headed by an internal committee that met in secret.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The Dublin branch however held its meetings in public, and of its membership of 400, 140 are identified as being Catholic, whereas only 130 could be identified as Protestants.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> This membership consisted of people from a  wide range of occupations, including around 50 members from outside Dublin itself.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> When the Dublin society was recommended by Neilson from the Belfast society to form an inner committee to thwart informants, they outright refused.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\n==Catholic rights and emancipation==\nThe ideal of religious equality and [[Catholic Emancipation]] was a central commitment of the United Irishmen.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The reform movement on the early 1780s was limited to the Protestant minority in Ireland, and this was seen as key to the failure of it to gain emancipation.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Some such as Tone realised that this movement was \"built on too narrow a foundation\", and that for it to be successful it would need the support of Catholics themselves.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nIn 1790 the [[Catholic Convention]], which had lain dormant since 1784, was revived, seeking further reforms and relief bills for Irish Catholics.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Some Catholic Committee members such as [[John Keogh]] had already joined the United Irishmen, with Tone appointed secretary of the Committee.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> The Committee would show a high level of political dexterity in campaigning for its aims.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nIn 1791, the British parliament passed the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791]], which gave some concession. In 1792, a town meeting in Belfast, saw a declaration in favour of full Catholic emancipation, opposing suggestions for a gradual process.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> In an attempt to prevent a union of the Catholic Committee and radicalised Protestants, the government during 1792 passed yet more bills repealing laws against Catholics.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Despite this, whilst they could appeal for further civil rights, Catholics were to be firmly refused political enfranchisement.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> This refusal only help cause the union that the establishment had been seeking to prevent.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nWhen the next Bastille Day celebrations were to be held that July, volunteer companies from throughout Ulster gathered in Belfast, such support was not secure.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Tone remarked that some of the volunteer companies who had gathered were no better than the sectarian anti-Catholic [[Peep o' Day Boys]] movement.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Despite having a resolution for full religious equality passed, it required nervous prior discussion, with the exact wording of it being changed so that: \"Irishmen of all religious denominations\" was changed to simply \"Catholic\".<ref name=\"Connolly\"/><ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nThe methods employed by the Catholic Committee to advance their cause caused mixed feelings amongst the United Irishmen, with some fearing that if things advanced too far, then they would lose the moderate conservatives in the society.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Drennan also observed that the Catholics sought to have \"two strings to their bow\" so that if one failed they could try the other, in reference to either working with the government or the Protestant radicals to achieve their aims.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\nBy working together the Committee and United Irishmen had in 1793 earned more concessions for Catholics, resulting in the winding up of the committee and thus an end to their alliance.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> In a parting show of support the Committee declared its support for parliamentary reform.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/> Emancipation however had still not been secured, and the United Irishmen continued to press for it.<ref name=\"Connolly\"/>\n\n==1793\u201397==\nFollowing the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French declaration of war on Britain]] in February 1793, the movement was outlawed and went underground from 1794 as they became more determined to force a revolt against British rule. The leadership was divided into those who wished to wait for French aid before rising and the more radical elements that wished to press ahead regardless. However, the suppression of a bloody preemptive rebellion, which broke out in [[county Leitrim|Leitrim]] in 1793, led to the former faction prevailing and links were forged with the revolutionary French government with instructions to wait sent to all of the United Irish membership.\n\nWorried by its presence, the Dublin administration conceded some reforms, allowing Catholics the vote, to become barristers and to enroll at [[Trinity College Dublin]] in 1793. The [[Hearth Tax]], paid by all households, was abolished in 1795, and [[St Patrick's College, Maynooth|St Patrick's seminary]] at Maynooth was founded. Catholics were also expected to join the militia and to inform on any United Irish activities.\n\nIn 1794, [[William Drennan]] became the first leader to be arrested and tried for sedition as the authorities began to react to the growth of the United Irishmen, followed by the [[Reverend William Jackson]]. In 1795 the loyalty of the hierarchy of the [[Catholic church]] was confirmed with the founding of [[St Patrick's College, Maynooth|Maynooth College]]. At that stage, the Church and the French republic were enemies because of the [[dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution]].\n\nA [[Exp\u00e9dition d'Irlande|French fleet]] carrying 15,000 troops set sail for Ireland in 1796, under [[Louis Lazare Hoche|General Hoche]] and spent days in sight of the [[County Cork|Cork]] coast at [[Bantry Bay]] but weather conditions prevented its landing, and its remnants not wrecked or captured returned to France. The [[British government]] responded to the threat it represented by sweeping up much of the United Irish leadership. It imposed [[martial law]] from 2 March 1797 in an attempt to break the movement by the widespread use of terror during searches for weapons.\n\n==1798 Rebellion==\n{{Main|Irish Rebellion of 1798}}\nBy early 1798, the United Irish membership on the ground (by now 280,000 sworn members) was under severe pressure, suffering from the terror of a roving campaign of disarmament while under instructions to do nothing until the arrival of French aid. French support was always a dilemma for the movement. Without it, a successful rebellion would see Ireland easily cordoned off by the [[Royal Navy]]; with it, the movement would be seen as fighting to become yet another \"[[Sister republic]]\" that would be exploited and controlled by the [[French Directory]].\n\nIn March 1798, the bulk of the leadership was arrested and preemptive risings had already broken out in Tipperary but indecision still divided the rump leadership. Finally, the unrelenting pressure led the militant faction of the United Irishmen to set the date for a general uprising on 23 May without French aid. However, information from the [[informant|informer]]s Thomas Reynolds and [[Francis Magan]] led to the arrests of [[Lord Edward Fitzgerald]] and Samuel Neilson shortly before the rising but more crucially foiled the planned rising in Dublin which was to be the central core of the planned rebellion. On the 5 June, [[Sir Edward Crosbie]] of [[Carlow]] became the first United Irishman to be executed for [[treason]].\n[[File:20101225131825Archibel Wilsonheadstone.jpg|thumb|left|The grave in [[Bangor Abbey]], [[County Down]], of United Irishman Archibel Wilson, who was hanged for his part in the 1798 rebellion.]]\n\nGeneral Napper Tandy, a leader of the uprising, authored a proclamation entitled 'Liberty or Death': \"Can you think of entering into a treaty with a British Minister? A Minister too, who has left you at the mercy of an English soldiery, who has laid your cities waste, and massacred inhumanely your best Citizens ... Horrid crimes have been perpetrated in your country, your friends have fallen a sacrifice to their devotion to your cause, and their shadows are around you and call for vengeance ... wage a war of extermination against your oppressors, the war of Liberty against tyranny, and Liberty shall Triumph.\"<ref>''Liberty or Death'', by James Napper Tandy, 1798</ref>\n\nNevertheless, tens of thousands rose in the surrounding counties, only around 10% of the 280,000 membership. The resulting [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] was severely hampered by the lack of leadership and was crushed with vicious brutality. The campaign met with little success except in [[County Wexford|Wexford]] where a number of massacres of loyalist civilians who were largely Protestant raised the spectre of sectarianism which was seized upon by enemies of the United Irishmen to weaken their non-sectarian appeal. The eventual arrival of 1,000 French troops in Killala, [[County Mayo]] in August was too little and too late to turn the tide for the United Irishmen. In October, [[Wolfe Tone]] himself was captured when a supporting French fleet of 3,000 troops was [[Battle of Tory Island|intercepted and defeated]] by the [[Royal Navy]] near [[Lough Swilly]].\n\nUpon his capture, Wolfe Tone said, \"From my earliest youth I have regarded the connection between Ireland and Great Britain as the curse of the Irish nation, and felt convinced, that while it lasted, this country would never be free or happy. In consequence, I determined to apply all the powers which my individual efforts could move, in order to separate the two countries.\" After being denied a soldier's death by firing squad, Wolfe Tone cheated the hangman by cutting his own throat.\n\nThe suppression of the rising was followed by a period of renewed repression of the United Irishmen as the general amnesty offered by [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]] [[Cornwallis in Ireland|Cornwallis]] specifically excluded rebel leaders many of whom were United Irishmen. However the United Irishmen still managed to survive as both a functioning clandestine organisation, especially in Dublin and as a military force with several rebel bands still active, though severely reduced and confined to a few counties.\n\n==Desertion of the United Irishmen cause==\nPrior to uprising in County Antrim, some Belfast merchants who had been ardent supporters of revolution, abandoned the radical cause for economic reasons.<ref name=\"ATQ\">Stewart, A.T.Q., ''1798 in the North''.

While the United Irish had declared themselves to be non-sectarian from 1791, there were other liberal Protestants in the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] who were also anti-sectarian and sought a more democratic franchise, such as [[Henry Grattan]] and [[John Philpot Curran]]. Although the United Irishmen was a staunchly non-[[sectarianism|sectarian]] body which sought to unite all Irishmen, regardless of religion or descent many among their ranks were former [[Defenders (Ireland)|Defenders]], a term applied to many loosely connected, exclusively Catholic, agrarian resistance groups. Many of these men, as well as their [[Presbyterian]] counterparts in Ulster, had been shaped by the sectarianism that was prevalent in eighteenth century Ireland and it was no mean feat to persuade Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter to put aside their differences and view each other simply as fellow Irishmen. Although the project met with remarkable success, it was quickly recognised by the establishment that sectarianism was a useful ally in the fight against the United Irishmen.\n\nThe formation of the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]] in 1795 was to prove particularly useful as it provided the government with allies who had detailed local knowledge of the activities of their enemies. The brutal disarming of Ulster in 1797, where the United Irish had successfully radicalised both Presbyterians and Catholics, saw thousands of Catholics driven from counties [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Down|Down]] and [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and the murder, torture and imprisonment of hundreds of Protestants suspected of United Irish sympathies.\n\nAlso in 1795 the Dublin administration funded the new [[St Patrick's College, Maynooth|St Patrick's College]] seminary for Roman Catholic priests, which ensured the support of the Irish Catholic hierarchy. The church was opposed to republicanism, though individual priests were supportive. The French government that supported the United Irish had engaged in a policy of \"[[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|dechristianisation]]\" for some years, and in February 1798 its army had expelled [[Pope Pius VI]] from Rome and formed the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|\"Roman Republic\"]]. The Irish Catholic hierarchy remained totally opposed to the United Irish policy, and came to see the removal of the Protestant Irish Parliament by an [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union]] as a part of the solution to the social grievances of its members. This inevitable quiet opposition was clear, and made a huge difference in 1798, but was often played down by nationalist historians in the 1800s, being mostly Catholic.\n\nOn the other hand, some Protestant historians such as Musgrave tended to play up the rebellion as another sectarian peasant ''jacquerie'', similar to the [[1641 Irish Rebellion|1641 Rebellion]] and owing nothing to progressive ideals.\n\nReligious division and hatred was, therefore, never completely buried and a minority of the Defenders did not reject completely their previous anti-Protestant outlook. During the course of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]], the Defenders who had risen with the United Irishmen perpetrated several sectarian massacres, most notoriously in [[County Wexford]] at [[Scullabogue Barn Massacre|Scullabogue]] and Wexford Bridge. While sectarianism undoubtedly played a part in many murders during the rising, religion was often taken as a signifier of loyalty or disloyalty by both sides and the fact that Protestants were often among the perpetrators and Catholics among the victims of rebel massacres indicates that victims lost their lives for being perceived as loyalists as opposed to purely religious reasons. Such subtleties were ignored in the aftermath, as the memory of such massacres was simplified and exploited in following years by politicians to cement the sectarian divide and to ensure the loyalty of Protestants to the British Crown.\n\n==After 1798==\nThe decision to abolish the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] resulting in the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] in 1800, which came into force on the 1st January 1801 and created the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], played on sectarian hopes and fears and was to gradually erode the United Irishmen by playing Catholic against Protestant. This was despite the original recognition that the \"bigotry\" (to quote Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]]) of the Protestant Parliament in [[Dublin]] had only contributed to sedition in Ireland.\n\nThe failure of [[Robert Emmet]]'s rebellion in 1803 triggered the effective collapse of the Society of United Irishmen. The last armed rebel group led by [[James Corcoran]] was destroyed in 1804 and the first half of the 19th century saw sectarianism replace separatism as the touchstone for political unrest in Ireland. Not until the [[Young Ireland]] movement in the 1840s was an attempt made to resurrect the non-sectarian ideals of the United Irishmen. However, the alliance between Catholic and Protestant was never fully regained as Protestants were drawn closer to a \"British\" identity through fear of having a perceived position of privilege eroded by the slowly growing political power of the Catholic majority. As a consequence, subsequent organised [[Irish republicanism|republican]] resistance to British rule in Ireland was largely confined to the Catholic population and seen as a threat by the majority of the Protestant population.\n<!--PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABEITCAL ORDER-->\n\n==See also==\n*[[Radicalism (historical)]]\n*[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Fils de la Libert\u00e9]] in Quebec\n*[[United Irish Uprising in Newfoundland]]\n*[[United Scotsmen]] in Scotland\n<!--*[[List of United Irishmen]]-->\n\n;Selected Members\n*[[William Drennan]]\n*[[Michael Dwyer]]\n*[[Thomas Russell (rebel)|Thomas Russell]]\n*[[Robert Emmet]]\n*[[Thomas Addis Emmet]]\n*[[Bagenal Harvey]] (United Irishmen commander)\n*[[James Hope (Ireland)|James Hope]]\n* [[William James MacNeven]]\n*[[Henry Joy McCracken]]\n*[[Leonard McNally]] (informer)\n*[[Thomas Muir (political reformer)]]\n*[[Samuel Neilson]]\n*[[James Orr (poet)|James Orr]]\n*[[William Orr (United Irishman)|William Orr]]\n*[[Thomas Paine]] (Honorary member)<ref name=\"Pryce-Jones2013\">{{cite book|author=David Pryce-Jones|title=Treason of the Heart: From Thomas Paine to Kim Philby|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xkMCHUn4UEEC&pg=PA13|date=10 October 2013|publisher=Encounter Books|isbn=978-1-59403-549-4|page=13}}</ref>\n*[[Archibald Hamilton Rowan]]\n*[[William Sampson (attorney)|William Sampson]]\n*[[The Sheares Brothers]]\n*[[James Napper Tandy]]\n*[[William Tennant]]\n*[[Theobald Wolfe Tone]]\n*[[Staker Wallace]]\n*[[James Dempsey (builder)|James Dempsey]]\n\n;Fictional Members\n*[[Stephen Maturin]]\n\n{{Irish Rebellion of 1798|state=expanded}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Connolly\">{{Cite book |title=Divided Kingdom; Ireland 1630-1800 |author=Sean J.

Usually such patterns are used by [[string searching algorithm]]s for \"find\" or \"find and replace\" operations on [[String (computer science)|strings]], or for input validation. It is a technique developed in [[theoretical computer science]] and [[formal language]] theory.\n\nThe concept arose in the 1950s when the American mathematician [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] formalized the description of a ''[[regular language]]''. The concept came into common use with [[Unix]] text-processing utilities. Different [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntaxes]] for writing regular expressions have existed since the 1980s<!---introduction of POSIX and Perl--->, one being the [[POSIX]] standard and another, widely used, being the [[Perl]] syntax.\n\nRegular expressions are used in [[search engine]]s, search and replace dialogs of [[word processor]]s and [[text editor]]s, in text processing utilities such as [[sed]] and [[AWK]] and in [[lexical analysis]]. Many [[programming language]]s provide regex capabilities either built-in or via [[Library (computing)|libraries]].<!-- not too much info here. Put it into its own chapter--><!--, built-in (for example [[Perl language structure#Regular expressions|Perl]], [[JavaScript]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[AWK]], and [[Tcl]]) and others via a [[standard library]] (for example [[.NET Framework|.NET languages]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[C POSIX library#regex.h|POSIX C]], and [[C++]] since [[C++11#regex|C++11]]). Most other languages offer regexes via a library.-->\n\n==Patterns==\nThe phrase ''regular expressions'', also called ''regexes'', is often used to mean the specific, standard textual syntax for representing patterns for matching text, as distinct from the mathematical notation described below. Each character in a regular expression (that is, each character in the string describing its pattern) is either a [[metacharacter]], having a special meaning, or a regular character that has a literal meaning. For example, in the regex <code>a.</code>, ''a'' is a literal character which matches just 'a', while '.' is a metacharacter that matches every character except a newline. Therefore, this regex matches, for example, 'a ', or 'ax', or 'a0'. Together, metacharacters and literal characters can be used to identify text of a given pattern, or process a number of instances of it. Pattern matches may vary from a precise equality to a very general similarity, as controlled by the metacharacters. For example, <code>.</code> is a very general pattern, <code><nowiki>[a-z]</nowiki></code> (match all lower case letters from 'a' to 'z') is less general and <code>a</code> is a precise pattern (matches just 'a'). The metacharacter syntax is designed specifically to represent prescribed targets in a concise and flexible way to direct the automation of [[text processing]] of a variety of input data, in a form easy to type using a standard [[ASCII]] [[computer keyboard|keyboard]].\n\nA very simple case of a regular expression in this syntax is to locate a word spelled two different ways in a [[text editor]], the regular expression <code>seriali[sz]e</code> matches both \"serialise\" and \"serialize\". [[Wildcard character|Wildcards]] also achieve this, but are more limited in what they can pattern, as they have fewer metacharacters and a simple language-base.\n\nThe usual context of [[wildcard character]]s is in [[glob (programming)|globbing]] similar names in a list of files, whereas regexes are usually employed in applications that pattern-match text strings in general. For example, the regex <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>^[ \\t]+|[ \\t]+$</source> matches excess whitespace at the beginning or end of a line. An advanced regular expression that matches any numeral is <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[+-]?(\\d+(\\.\\d+)?|\\.\\d+)([eE][+-]?\\d+)?</source>.\n\n[[File:Thompson-kleene-star.svg|right|thumb|[[Thompson's construction algorithm|Translating]] the [[Kleene star]]<br/>(''s''* means 'zero or more of ''s'' ')]]\nA '''regex processor''' translates a regular expression in the above syntax into an internal representation which can be executed and matched against a [[string (computing)|string]] representing the text being searched in. One possible approach is the [[Thompson's construction algorithm]] to construct a [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] (NFA), which is then [[Powerset construction|made deterministic]] and the resulting [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA) is run on the target text string to recognize substrings that match the regular expression.\nThe picture shows the NFA scheme <code>''N''(''s''*)</code> obtained from the regular expression <code>''s''*</code>, where ''s'' denotes a simpler regular expression in turn, which has already been [[Recursion (computer science)|recursively]] translated to the NFA ''N''(''s'').\n\n==History==\nRegular expressions originated in 1951, when mathematician [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] described [[regular language]]s using his mathematical notation called ''regular events''.{{sfn|Kleene|1951}}<ref name = \"Leung, New Mexico State University, 2010\" >{{ Cite web | url = https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/historical-projects/Projects/kleene.9.16.10.pdf | title = Regular Languages and Finite Automata | access-date = 13 August 2019 | first = Hing | last = Leung | date = 16 September 2010 | website = [[New Mexico State University]] | quote = The concept of regular events was introduced by Kleene via the definition of regular expressions. | format = pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131205193130/https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/historical-projects/Projects/kleene.9.16.10.pdf | archive-date = 5 December 2013  | df = dmy-all }}</ref> These arose in [[theoretical computer science]], in the subfields of [[automata theory]] (models of computation) and the description and classification of [[formal language]]s. Other early implementations of [[pattern matching]] include the [[SNOBOL]] language, which did not use regular expressions, but instead its own pattern matching constructs.\n\nRegular expressions entered popular use from 1968 in two uses: pattern matching in a text editor{{sfn|Thompson|1968}} and lexical analysis in a compiler.{{sfn|Johnson|Porter|Ackley|Ross|1968}} Among the first appearances of regular expressions in program form was when [[Ken Thompson]] built Kleene's notation into the editor [[QED (text editor)|QED]] as a means to match patterns in [[text file]]s.{{sfn|Thompson|1968}}<ref name=\"Beautiful Code Kernighan\">{{cite book | last1 = Kernighan | first1 = Brian | authorlink1 = Brian Kernighan | title = Beautiful Code | chapter = A Regular Expressions Matcher | publisher = [[O'Reilly Media]] | pages = 1\u20132 | chapter-url = http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/beautiful.html | accessdate = 2013-05-15 | isbn = 978-0-596-51004-6| date = 2007-08-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/qed.html |title=An incomplete history of the QED Text Editor |last1=Ritchie |first1=Dennis M. |publisher= |accessdate=9 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990221023422/http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/qed.html |archive-date=1999-02-21 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>{{sfn|Aho|Ullman|1992|loc=10.11 Bibliographic Notes for Chapter 10, p. 589}} For speed, Thompson implemented regular expression matching by [[just-in-time compilation]] (JIT) to [[IBM 7094]] code on the [[Compatible Time-Sharing System]], an important early example of JIT compilation.{{sfn|Aycock|2003|loc=2. JIT Compilation Techniques, 2.1 Genesis, p. 98}} He later added this capability to the Unix editor [[ed (text editor)|ed]], which eventually led to the popular search tool [[grep]]'s use of regular expressions (\"grep\" is a word derived from the command for regular expression searching in the ed editor: <code>g/''re''/p</code> meaning \"Global search for Regular Expression and Print matching lines\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/G/grep.html | title=Jargon File 4.4.7: grep | author=[[Eric S.

Regexes were subsequently adopted by a wide range of programs, with these early forms standardized in the [[POSIX.2]] standard in 1992.\n\nIn the 1980s the more complicated regexes arose in [[Perl]], which originally derived from a regex library written by [[Henry Spencer]] (1986), who later wrote an implementation of ''Advanced Regular Expressions'' for [[Tcl]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tcl.tk/doc/howto/regexp81.html | title = New Regular Expression Features in Tcl 8.1 | accessdate = 2013-10-11}}</ref> The Tcl library is a hybrid [[Nondeterministic finite automaton|NFA]]/[[Deterministic finite automaton|DFA]] implementation with improved performance characteristics.

These rules maintain existing features of Perl 5.x regexes, but also allow [[Backus\u2013Naur form|BNF]]-style definition of a [[recursive descent parser]] via sub-rules.\n\nThe use of regexes in structured information standards for document and database modeling started in the 1960s and expanded in the 1980s when industry standards like [[Standard Generalized Markup Language|ISO SGML]] (precursored by ANSI \"GCA 101-1983\") consolidated. The kernel of the [[XML schema#Validation|structure specification language]] standards consists of regexes. Its use is evident in the [[Document Type Definition|DTD]] element group syntax.\n\nStarting in 1997, [[Philip Hazel]] developed [[Perl Compatible Regular Expressions|PCRE]] (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions), which attempts to closely mimic Perl's regex functionality and is used by many modern tools including [[PHP]] and [[Apache HTTP Server]].\n\nToday, regexes are widely supported in programming languages, text processing programs (particularly [[Lexical analysis|lexers]]), advanced text editors, and some other programs. Regex support is part of the [[standard library]] of many programming languages, including [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and is built into the syntax of others, including Perl and [[ECMAScript]]. Implementations of regex functionality is often called a '''regex engine''', and a number of libraries are available for reuse. In the late 2010s, several companies started to offer hardware, [[FPGA]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://grovf.com/products/gregex|title=GROVF {{!}} Big Data Analytics Acceleration|website=grovf.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>, [[GPU]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bkase.github.io/CUDA-grep/finalreport.html|title=CUDA grep|website=bkase.github.io|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref> implementations of [[PCRE]] compatible '''regex engines''' that are faster compared to [[Central processing unit|CPU]] implementations'''.'''\n\n==Basic concepts==\nA regular expression, often called a ''pattern'', specifies a [[Set (computer science)|set]] of strings required for a particular purpose. A simple way to specify a finite set of strings is to list its [[Data element|elements]] or members. However, there are often more concise ways: for example, the set containing the three strings \"Handel\", \"H\u00e4ndel\", and \"Haendel\" can be specified by the pattern <code>H(\u00e4|ae?)ndel</code>; we say that this pattern ''matches'' each of the three strings. In most [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]]s, if there exists at least one regular expression that matches a particular set then there exists an infinite number of other regular expressions that also match it\u2014the specification is not unique. Most formalisms provide the following operations to construct regular expressions.\n\n;Boolean \"or\"\n:A [[vertical bar]] separates alternatives. For example, {{code|lang=perl|code=gray{{!}}grey}} can match \"gray\" or \"grey\".\n;Grouping\n:[[Parentheses]] are used to define the scope and precedence of the [[Operator (programming)|operators]] (among other uses). For example, <code>gray|grey</code> and {{code|lang=perl|code=gr(a{{!}}e)y}} are equivalent patterns which both describe the set of \"gray\" or \"grey\".\n;Quantification\n:A [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] after a [[Lexical analysis#Token|token]] (such as a character) or group specifies how often that a preceding element is allowed to occur. The most common quantifiers are the [[question mark]] <code>?</code>, the [[asterisk]] <code>*</code> (derived from the [[Kleene star]]), and the [[plus sign]] <code>+</code> ([[Kleene plus]]).\n:{|\n| style=\"width:15px; vertical-align:top;\" | <code>'''?'''</code>\n|The question mark indicates ''zero or one'' occurrences of the preceding element. For example, <code><!--DON'T CHANGE THIS TO \"colo?r\"! REGULAR EXPRESSIONS DON'T WORK LIKE WILDCARDS!--><!--Why not? Give reason in main context.!-->colou?r</code> matches both \"color\" and \"colour\".\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" | <code>'''<nowiki>*</nowiki>'''</code>\n|The asterisk indicates ''zero or more'' occurrences of the preceding element. For example, <code>ab*c</code> matches \"ac\", \"abc\", \"abbc\", \"abbbc\", and so on.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" | <code>'''+'''</code>\n|The plus sign indicates ''one or more'' occurrences of the preceding element. For example, <code>ab+c</code> matches \"abc\", \"abbc\", \"abbbc\", and so on, but not \"ac\".\n|-\n|<code>'''{n}'''</code><ref name=\"grep\">grep(1) man page</ref>\n| The preceding item is matched exactly ''n'' times.\n|-\n|<code>'''{min,}'''</code><ref name=\"grep\"/>\n| The preceding item is matched ''min'' or more times.\n|-\n|<code>'''{min,max}'''</code><ref name=\"grep\"/>\n| The preceding item is matched at least ''min'' times, but not more than ''max'' times.\n|}\n;Wildcard\nThe wildcard <code>'''.'''</code> matches any character. For example, <code>a.b</code> matches any string that contains an \"a\", then any other character and then a \"b\", <code>a.*b</code> matches any string that contains an \"a\" and a \"b\" at some later point.\n\nThese constructions can be combined to form arbitrarily complex expressions, much like one can construct arithmetical expressions from numbers and the operations +, \u2212, \u00d7, and \u00f7. For example, <code>H(ae?|\u00e4)ndel</code> and {{code|lang=perl|code=H(a{{!}}ae{{!}}\u00e4)ndel}} are both valid patterns which match the same strings as the earlier example, <code>H(\u00e4|ae?)ndel</code>.\n\nThe precise [[syntax]] for regular expressions varies among tools and with context; more detail is given in {{slink||Syntax}}.\n\n==Formal language theory==\nRegular expressions describe [[regular language]]s in [[Formal language|formal language theory]]. They have the same expressive power as [[regular grammar]]s.\n\n===Formal definition===\nRegular expressions consist of constants, which denote sets of strings, and operator symbols, which denote operations over these sets. The following definition is standard, and found as such in most textbooks on formal language theory.<ref name=\"HopcroftMotwaniUllman01\">{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Motwani|Ullman|2000}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Sipser|1998}}</ref> Given a finite [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] \u03a3, the following constants are defined\nas regular expressions:\n*(''empty set'') \u2205 denoting the set \u2205.\n*(''[[empty string]]'') \u03b5 denoting the set containing only the \"empty\" string, which has no characters at all.\n*(''[[string literal|literal character]]'') <code>a</code> in \u03a3 denoting the set containing only the character ''a''.\n\nGiven regular expressions R and S, the following operations over them are defined\nto produce regular expressions:\n* (''[[concatenation]]'') ''RS'' denotes the set of strings that can be obtained by concatenating a string in R and a string in S. For example, let R = {\"ab\", \"c\"}, and S = {\"d\", \"ef\"}. Then, RS = {\"abd\", \"abef\", \"cd\", \"cef\"}.\n*(''[[alternation (formal language theory)|alternation]]'') ''R'' | ''S'' denotes the [[set union]] of sets described by ''R'' and ''S''. For example, if R describes {\"ab\", \"c\"} and S describes {\"ab\", \"d\", \"ef\"}, expression ''R'' | ''S'' describes {\"ab\", \"c\", \"d\", \"ef\"}.\n*(''[[Kleene star]]'') ''R''* denotes the smallest [[subset|superset]] of the set described by ''R'' that contains \u03b5 and is [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under string concatenation. This is the set of all strings that can be made by concatenating any finite number (including zero) of strings from the set described by ''R''. For example, {\"0\",\"1\"}* is the set of all finite [[binary string]]s (including the empty string), and {\"ab\", \"c\"}* = {\u03b5, \"ab\", \"c\", \"abab\", \"abc\", \"cab\", \"cc\", \"ababab\", \"abcab\", ... }.\n\nTo avoid parentheses it is assumed that the Kleene star has the highest priority, then concatenation and then alternation. If there is no ambiguity then parentheses may be omitted. For example, <code>(ab)c</code> can be written as <code>abc</code>, and <code>a|(b(c*))</code> can be written as <code>a|bc*</code>.\nMany textbooks use the symbols \u222a, +, or \u2228 for alternation instead of the vertical bar.\n\n'''Examples:'''\n*<code>a|b*</code> denotes {\u03b5, \"a\", \"b\", \"bb\", \"bbb\", ...}\n*<code>(a|b)*</code> denotes the set of all strings with no symbols other than \"a\" and \"b\", including the empty string: {\u03b5, \"a\", \"b\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"bb\", \"aaa\", ...}\n*<code>ab*(c|\u03b5)</code> denotes the set of strings starting with \"a\", then zero or more \"b\"s and finally optionally a \"c\": {\"a\", \"ac\", \"ab\", \"abc\", \"abb\", \"abbc\", ...}\n*<code>(0|(1(01*0)*1))*</code> denotes the set of binary numbers that are multiples of 3: { \u03b5, \"0\", \"00\", \"11\", \"000\", \"011\", \"110\", \"0000\", \"0011\", \"0110\", \"1001\", \"1100\", \"1111\", \"00000\", ... }\n\n===Expressive power and compactness===\nThe formal definition of regular expressions is minimal on purpose, and avoids defining <code>?</code> and <code>+</code>\u2014these can be expressed as follows: <code>a+</code> = <code>aa*</code>, and <code>a?</code> = <code>(a|\u03b5)</code>. Sometimes the [[set complement|complement]] operator is added, to give a ''generalized regular expression''; here ''R<sup>c</sup>'' matches all strings over \u03a3* that do not match ''R''. In principle, the complement operator is redundant, because it doesn't grant any more expressive power. However, it can make a regular expression much more concise\u2014eliminating all complement operators from a regular expression can cause a [[Double exponential function|double exponentially]] blow-up of its length.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gelade|Neven|2008}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Gruber|Holzer|2008}}</ref>\n\nRegular expressions in this sense can express the regular languages, exactly the class of languages accepted by [[deterministic finite automata]]. There is, however, a significant difference in compactness. Some classes of regular languages can only be described by deterministic finite automata whose size grows [[exponential growth|exponentially]] in the size of the shortest equivalent regular expressions. The standard example here is the languages\n''L<sub>k</sub>'' consisting of all strings over the alphabet {''a'',''b''} whose ''k''<sup>th</sup>-from-last letter equals&nbsp;''a''. On one hand, a regular expression describing ''L''<sub>4</sub> is given by\n<math>(a\\mid b)^*a(a\\mid b)(a\\mid b)(a\\mid b)</math>.\n\nGeneralizing this pattern to ''L<sub>k</sub>'' gives the expression:\n<math>(a\\mid b)^*a\\underbrace{(a\\mid b)(a\\mid b)\\cdots(a\\mid b)}_{k-1\\text{ times}}. \\, </math>\n\nOn the other hand, it is known that every deterministic finite automaton accepting the language ''L<sub>k</sub>'' must have at least 2<sup>''k''</sup> states. Luckily, there is a simple mapping from regular expressions to the more general [[nondeterministic finite automata]] (NFAs) that does not lead to such a blowup in size; for this reason NFAs are often used as alternative representations of regular languages. NFAs are a simple variation of the type-3 [[formal grammar|grammars]] of the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].<ref name=\"HopcroftMotwaniUllman01\"/>\n\nIn the opposite direction, there are many languages easily described by a DFA that are not easily described a regular expression. For instance, determining the validity of a given [[ISBN]] requires computing the modulus of the integer base 11, and can be easily implemented with an 11-state DFA. However, a regular expression to answer the same problem of divisibility by 11 is at least multiple megabytes in length.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nGiven a regular expression, [[Thompson's construction algorithm]] computes an equivalent nondeterministic finite automaton. A conversion in the opposite direction is achieved by [[Kleene's algorithm]].\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that many real-world \"regular expression\" engines implement features that cannot be described by the regular expressions in the sense of formal language theory; rather, they implement ''regexes''. See [[#Patterns for non-regular languages|below]] for more on this.\n\n===Deciding equivalence of regular expressions===\nAs seen in many of the examples above, there is more than one way to construct a regular expression to achieve the same results.\n\nIt is possible to write an [[algorithm]] that, for two given regular expressions, decides whether the described languages are equal; the algorithm reduces each expression to a [[minimal deterministic finite state machine]], and determines whether they are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] (equivalent).\n\nAlgebraic laws for regular expressions can be obtained using a method by Gischer which is best explained along an example: In order to check whether (''X''+''Y'')<sup>*</sup> and (''X''<sup>*</sup> ''Y''<sup>*</sup>)<sup>*</sup> denote the same regular language, for all regular expressions ''X'', ''Y'', it is necessary and sufficient to check whether the particular regular expressions (''a''+''b'')<sup>*</sup> and (''a''<sup>*</sup> ''b''<sup>*</sup>)<sup>*</sup> denote the same language over the alphabet \u03a3={''a'',''b''}. More generally, an equation ''E''=''F'' between regular-expression terms with variables holds if, and only if, its instantiation with different variables replaced by different symbol constants holds.<ref>{{cite report | url= | author=Jay L.

As simple as the regular expressions are, there is no method to systematically rewrite them to some normal form. The lack of axiom in the past led to the [[star height problem]]. In 1991, [[Dexter Kozen]] axiomatized regular expressions as a [[Kleene algebra#History|Kleene algebra]], using equational and [[Horn clause]] axioms.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kozen|1991}}{{page needed|date=February 2015}}</ref>\nAlready in 1964, Redko had proved that no finite set of purely equational axioms can characterize the algebra of regular languages.<ref>{{cite journal| author=V.N.

The pattern is composed of a sequence of ''atoms''. An atom is a single point within the regex pattern which it tries to match to the target string. The simplest atom is a literal, but grouping parts of the pattern to match an atom will require using <code>(&nbsp;)</code> as metacharacters. Metacharacters help form: ''atoms''; ''quantifiers'' telling how many atoms (and whether it is a [[#Lazy_matching|''greedy'' quantifier]] or not); a logical OR character, which offers a set of alternatives, and a logical NOT character, which negates an atom's existence; and backreferences to refer to previous atoms of a completing pattern of atoms. A match is made, not when all the atoms of the string are matched, but rather when all the pattern atoms in the regex have matched. The idea is to make a small pattern of characters stand for a large number of possible strings, rather than compiling a large list of all the literal possibilities.\n\nDepending on the regex processor there are about fourteen metacharacters, characters that may or may not have their [[literal (computer programming)|literal]] character meaning, depending on context, or whether they are \"escaped\", i.e. preceded by an [[escape sequence]], in this case, the backslash <code>\\</code>. Modern and POSIX extended regexes use metacharacters more often than their literal meaning, so to avoid \"backslash-osis\" or [[leaning toothpick syndrome]] it makes sense to have a metacharacter escape to a literal mode; but starting out, it makes more sense to have the four bracketing metacharacters <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>{&nbsp;}</code> be primarily literal, and \"escape\" this usual meaning to become metacharacters. Common standards implement both. The usual metacharacters are <code> {}[]()^$.|*+?</code> and <code>\\</code>. The usual characters that become metacharacters when escaped are <code>dswDSW</code> and <code>N</code>.\n\n===Delimiters===\nWhen entering a regex in a programming language, they may be represented as a usual string literal, hence usually quoted; this is common in C, Java, and Python for instance, where the regex <code>re</code> is entered as <code>\"re\"</code>. However, they are often written with slashes as [[delimiter]]s, as in <code>/re/</code> for the regex <code>re</code>. This originates in [[Ed (text editor)|ed]], where <code>/</code> is the editor command for searching, and an expression <code>/re/</code> can be used to specify a range of lines (matching the pattern), which can be combined with other commands on either side, most famously <code>g/re/p</code> as in [[grep]] (\"global regex print\"), which is included in most [[Unix]]-based operating systems, such as [[Linux]] distributions. A similar convention is used in [[sed]], where search and replace is given by <code>s/re/replacement/</code> and patterns can be joined with a comma to specify a range of lines as in <code>/re1/,/re2/</code>. This notation is particularly well known due to its use in [[Perl]], where it forms part of the syntax distinct from normal string literals. In some cases, such as sed and Perl, alternative delimiters can be used to avoid collision with contents, and to avoid having to escape occurrences of the delimiter character in the contents. For example, in sed the command <code>s,/,X,</code> will replace a <code>/</code> with an <code>X</code>, using commas as delimiters.\n\n===Standards===\n{{anchor|POSIX}}The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] [[POSIX]] standard has three sets of compliance: '''BRE''' (Basic Regular Expressions),<ref>ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993 ''Information technology \u2013 Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) \u2013 Part 2: Shell and Utilities'', successively revised as ISO/IEC 9945-2:2002 ''Information technology \u2013 Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) \u2013 Part 2: System Interfaces'', ISO/IEC 9945-2:2003, and currently ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945:2009 ''Information technology \u2013 Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX\u00ae) Base Specifications, Issue 7''</ref> '''ERE''' (Extended Regular Expressions), and '''SRE''' (Simple Regular Expressions). SRE is [[Deprecation|deprecated]],<ref>The Single Unix Specification (Version 2)</ref> in favor of BRE, as both provide [[backward compatibility]]. The subsection below covering the ''character classes'' applies to both BRE and ERE.\n\nBRE and ERE work together. ERE adds <code>?</code>, <code>+</code>, and <code>|</code>, and it removes the need to escape the metacharacters <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>{&nbsp;}</code>, which are ''required'' in BRE. Furthermore, as long as the POSIX standard syntax for regexes is adhered to, there can be, and often is, additional syntax to serve specific (yet POSIX compliant) applications. Although POSIX.2 leaves some implementation specifics undefined, BRE and ERE provide a \"standard\" which has since been adopted as the default syntax of many tools, where the choice of BRE or ERE modes is usually a supported option. For example, [[GNU]] <code>grep</code> has the following options: \"<code>grep -E</code>\" for ERE, and \"<code>grep -G</code>\" for BRE (the default), and \"<code>grep -P</code>\" for [[Perl]] regexes.\n\nPerl regexes have become a de facto standard, having a rich and powerful set of atomic expressions. Perl has no \"basic\" or \"extended\" levels. As in POSIX EREs, <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>{&nbsp;}</code> are treated as metacharacters unless escaped; other metacharacters are known to be literal or symbolic based on context alone. Additional functionality includes [[#Lazy matching|lazy matching]], [[backreferences]], named capture groups, and [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] patterns.\n\n====POSIX basic and extended====\nIn the [[POSIX]] standard, Basic Regular Syntax ('''BRE''') requires that the [[metacharacter]]s <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>{&nbsp;}</code> be designated <code>\\(\\)</code> and <code>\\{\\}</code>, whereas Extended Regular Syntax ('''ERE''') does not.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Metacharacter\n! Description\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>^</code>\n|Matches the starting position within the string. In line-based tools, it matches the starting position of any line.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>.</code>\n|Matches any single character (many applications exclude [[newline]]s, and exactly which characters are considered newlines is flavor-, character-encoding-, and platform-specific, but it is safe to assume that the line feed character is included). Within POSIX bracket expressions, the dot character matches a literal dot. For example, <code>a.c</code> matches \"abc\", etc., but <code>[a.c]</code> matches only \"a\", \".\", or \"c\".\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>[&nbsp;]</code>\n|A bracket expression. Matches a single character that is contained within the brackets. For example, <code>[abc]</code> matches \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\". <code>[a-z]</code> specifies a range which matches any lowercase letter from \"a\" to \"z\". These forms can be mixed: <code>[abcx-z]</code> matches \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"x\", \"y\", or \"z\", as does <code>[a-cx-z]</code>.\nThe <code>-</code> character is treated as a literal character if it is the last or the first (after the <code>^</code>, if present) character within the brackets: <code>[abc-]</code>, <code>[-abc]</code>. Note that backslash escapes are not allowed. The <code>]</code> character can be included in a bracket expression if it is the first (after the <code>^</code>) character: <code>[]abc]</code>.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>[^&nbsp;]</code>\n|Matches a single character that is not contained within the brackets. For example, <code>[^abc]</code> matches any character other than \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\". <code>[^a-z]</code> matches any single character that is not a lowercase letter from \"a\" to \"z\". Likewise, literal characters and ranges can be mixed.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>$</code>\n|Matches the ending position of the string or the position just before a string-ending newline. In line-based tools, it matches the ending position of any line.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>( )</code>\n|Defines a marked subexpression. The string matched within the parentheses can be recalled later (see the next entry, <code>\\''n''</code>). A marked subexpression is also called a block or capturing group. '''BRE mode requires {{nowrap|<code>\\(&nbsp;\\)</code>}}'''.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>\\''n''</code>\n|Matches what the ''n''th marked subexpression matched, where ''n'' is a digit from 1 to 9. This construct is vaguely defined in the POSIX.2 standard. Some tools allow referencing more than nine capturing groups. Also known as a backreference.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>*</code>\n|Matches the preceding element zero or more times. For example, <code>ab*c</code> matches \"ac\", \"abc\", \"abbbc\", etc. <code>[xyz]*</code> matches \"\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"zx\", \"zyx\", \"xyzzy\", and so on. <code>(ab)*</code> matches \"\", \"ab\", \"abab\", \"ababab\", and so on.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!{{nowrap|<code>{''m'',''n''}</code>}}\n|Matches the preceding element at least ''m'' and not more than ''n'' times. For example, <code>a{3,5}</code> matches only \"aaa\", \"aaaa\", and \"aaaaa\". This is not found in a few older instances of regexes. '''BRE mode requires <code>{{nowrap|\\{''m'',''n''\\}}}</code>'''.\n\n|}\n\n'''Examples:'''\n*<code>.at</code> matches any three-character string ending with \"at\", including \"hat\", \"cat\", and \"bat\".\n*<code>[hc]at</code> matches \"hat\" and \"cat\".\n*<code>[^b]at</code> matches all strings matched by <code>.at</code> except \"bat\".\n*<code>[^hc]at</code> matches all strings matched by <code>.at</code> other than \"hat\" and \"cat\".\n*<code>^[hc]at</code> matches \"hat\" and \"cat\", but only at the beginning of the string or line.\n*<code>[hc]at$</code> matches \"hat\" and \"cat\", but only at the end of the string or line.\n*<code>\\[.\\]</code> matches any single character surrounded by \"[\" and \"]\" since the brackets are escaped, for example: \"[a]\" and \"[b]\".\n*<code>s.*</code> matches s followed by zero or more characters, for example: \"s\" and \"saw\" and \"seed\".\n\n====POSIX extended====\nThe meaning of metacharacters [[escape character|escaped]] with a backslash is reversed for some characters in the POSIX Extended Regular Expression ('''ERE''') syntax. With this syntax, a backslash causes the metacharacter to be treated as a literal character. So, for example, <code>\\(&nbsp;\\)</code> is now <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>\\{&nbsp;\\}</code> is now <code>{&nbsp;}</code>. Additionally, support is removed for <code>\\''n''</code> backreferences and the following metacharacters are added:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Metacharacter\n! Description\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>?</code>\n|Matches the preceding element zero or one time. For example, <code>ab?c</code> matches only \"ac\" or \"abc\".\n|-\n!<code>+</code>\n|Matches the preceding element one or more times. For example, <code>ab+c</code> matches \"abc\", \"abbc\", \"abbbc\", and so on, but not \"ac\".\n|-\n!<code><nowiki>|</nowiki></code>\n|The choice (also known as alternation or set union) operator matches either the expression before or the expression after the operator. For example, <code><nowiki>abc|def</nowiki></code> matches \"abc\" or \"def\".</td>\n|}\n\n'''Examples:'''\n*<code>[hc]?at</code> matches \"at\", \"hat\", and \"cat\".\n*<code>[hc]*at</code> matches \"at\", \"hat\", \"cat\", \"hhat\", \"chat\", \"hcat\", \"cchchat\", and so on.\n*<code>[hc]+at</code> matches \"hat\", \"cat\", \"hhat\", \"chat\", \"hcat\", \"cchchat\", and so on, but not \"at\".\n*<code>cat|dog</code> matches \"cat\" or \"dog\".\n\nPOSIX Extended Regular Expressions can often be used with modern Unix utilities by including the [[command line]] flag <var>-E</var>.\n\n====Character classes====\nThe character class is the most basic regex concept after a literal match. It makes one small sequence of characters match a larger set of characters. For example, <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[A-Z]</source> could stand for the uppercase alphabet in the English language, and <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>\\d</source> could mean any digit. Character classes apply to both POSIX levels.\n\nWhen specifying a range of characters, such as <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[a-Z]</source> (i.e. lowercase ''<source lang=\"ragel\" inline>a</source>'' to uppercase ''<source lang=\"ragel\" inline>Z</source>''), the computer's locale settings determine the contents by the numeric ordering of the character encoding. They could store digits in that sequence, or the ordering could be ''abc\u2026zABC\u2026Z'', or ''aAbBcC\u2026zZ''. So the POSIX standard defines a character class, which will be known by the regex processor installed. Those definitions are in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! POSIX !!

For example, <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[[:upper:]ab]</source> matches the uppercase letters and lowercase \"a\" and \"b\".\n\nAn additional non-POSIX class understood by some tools is <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[:word:]</source>, which is usually defined as <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[:alnum:]</source> plus underscore. This reflects the fact that in many programming languages these are the characters that may be used in identifiers. The editor [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] further distinguishes ''word'' and ''word-head'' classes (using the notation <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>\\w</source> and <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>\\h</source>) since in many programming languages the characters that can begin an identifier are not the same as those that can occur in other positions: numbers are generally excluded, so an identifier would look like <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>\\h\\w*</source> or <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[[:alpha:]_][[:alnum:]_]*</source> in POSIX notation.\n\nNote that what the POSIX regex standards call ''character classes'' are commonly referred to as ''POSIX character classes'' in other regex flavors which support them. With most other regex flavors, the term ''character class'' is used to describe what POSIX calls ''bracket expressions''.\n\n===Perl and PCRE===\n{{See also|Perl Compatible Regular Expressions}}\nBecause of its expressive power and (relative) ease of reading, many other utilities and programming languages have adopted syntax similar to [[Perl]]'s &mdash; for example, [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Qt (software)|Qt]], Microsoft's [[.NET Framework]], and [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]]. Some languages and tools such as [[Boost C++ Libraries|Boost]] and [[PHP]] support multiple regex flavors. Perl-derivative regex implementations are not identical and usually implement a subset of features found in Perl 5.0, released in 1994. Perl sometimes does incorporate features initially found in other languages. For example, Perl 5.10 implements syntactic extensions originally developed in PCRE and Python.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#PCRE%2fPython-Support | title= Perl Regular Expression Documentation |publisher=perldoc.perl.org | accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Lazy matching===\nIn Python and some<!---should be 'many', or 'most', or 'a few', or ...?---> other implementations (e.g. Java), the three common quantifiers (<code>*</code>, <code>+</code> and <code>?</code>) are [[greedy algorithm|greedy]] by default because they match as many characters as possible.<ref name=py-re>{{cite web|title=Regular Expression Syntax|url=https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax|website=Python 3.5.0 documentation|publisher=[[Python Software Foundation]]|accessdate=10 October 2015}}</ref> The regex <code>\".+\"</code> (including the double-quotes) applied to the string\n\n \"Ganymede,\" he continued, \"is the largest moon in the Solar System.\"\n\nmatches the entire line (because the entire line begins and ends with a double-quote) instead of matching only the first part, <code>\"Ganymede,\"</code>. The aforementioned quantifiers may, however, be made ''lazy'' or ''minimal'' or ''reluctant'', matching as few characters as possible, by appending a question mark: <code>\".+?\"</code> matches only <code>\"Ganymede,\"</code>.<ref name=py-re/>\n\nHowever, the whole sentence can still be matched in some circumstances. The question-mark operator does not change the meaning of the dot operator, so this still can match the double-quotes in the input. A pattern like <code>\".*?\" EOF</code> will still match the whole input if this is the string:\n\n \"Ganymede,\" he continued, \"is the largest moon in the Solar System.\" EOF\n\nTo ensure that the double-quotes cannot be part of the match, the dot has to be replaced, e. g. like this: <code>\"[^\"]*\"</code> This will match a quoted text part without additional double-quotes in it. (By removing possibilities for a fixed suffix to be matched, one also transforms the lazy-match to a greedy-match.)\n\n===Possessive matching===\nIn Java, quantifiers may be made ''possessive'' by appending a plus sign, which disables backing off (in a backtracking engine), even if doing so would allow the overall match to succeed:<ref name=es-re>{{cite web|title=Essential classes: Regular Expressions: Quantifiers: Differences Among Greedy, Reluctant, and Possessive Quantifiers|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/quant.html#difs|website=The Java Tutorials|publisher=[[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref> While the regex <code>\".*\"</code> applied to the string\n\n \"Ganymede,\" he continued, \"is the largest moon in the Solar System.\"\n\nmatches the entire line, the regex <code>\".*+\"</code> does {{em|not match at all}}, because <code>.*+</code> consumes the entire input, including the final <code>\"</code>. Thus, possessive quantifiers are most useful with negated character classes, e.g. <code>\"[^\"]*+\"</code>, which matches <code>\"Ganymede,\"</code> when applied to the same string.\n\nAnother common extension serving the same function is atomic grouping, which disables backtracking for a parenthesized group. The typical syntax is {{mono|1=(?&gt;group)}}. For example, while {{mono|1=^(wi{{!}}w)i$}} matches both {{mono|wi}} and {{mono|wii}}, {{mono|1=^(?&gt;wi{{!}}w)i$}} only matches {{mono|wii}} because the engine is forbidden from backtracking and try with setting the group as \"w\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Atomic Grouping |url=https://www.regular-expressions.info/atomic.html |website=Regex Tutorial |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nPossessive quantifiers are easier to implement than greedy and lazy quantifiers, and are typically more efficient at runtime.<ref name=es-re/>\n\n==Patterns for non-regular languages==\nMany features found in virtually all modern regular expression libraries provide an expressive power that far exceeds the [[regular language]]s. For example, many implementations allow grouping subexpressions with parentheses and recalling the value they match in the same expression (''{{visible anchor|backreferences}}''). This means that, among other things, a pattern can match strings of repeated words like \"papa\" or \"WikiWiki\", called ''squares'' in formal language theory. The pattern for these strings is <code>(.+)\\1</code>.\n\nThe language of squares is not regular, nor is it [[context-free language|context-free]], due to the [[Pumping lemma for context-free languages|pumping lemma]]. However, [[pattern matching]] with an unbounded number of backreferences, as supported by numerous modern tools, is still [[context-sensitive language|context sensitive]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Cezar C\u00e2mpeanu and Kai Salomaa, and Sheng Yu | title=A Formal Study of Practical Regular Expressions | journal=International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science | volume=14 | number=6 | pages=1007\u20131018 | url=http://137.149.157.5/Articles/index.php?aid=1<!---This url was taken from C\u00e2mpeanu's publications page http://www.csit.upei.ca/~ccampeanu/Research/RJ--->| date=Dec 2003 | doi=10.1142/S012905410300214X }} Theorem 3 (p.9)</ref> The general problem of matching any number of backreferences is [[NP-complete]], growing exponentially by the number of backref groups used.<ref>{{cite web |title=Perl Regular Expression Matching is NP-Hard |url=https://perl.plover.com/NPC/ |website=perl.plover.com}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many tools, libraries, and engines that provide such constructions still use the term ''regular expression'' for their patterns. This has led to a nomenclature where the term regular expression has different meanings in [[formal language|formal language theory]] and pattern matching. For this reason, some people have taken to using the term ''regex'', ''regexp'', or simply ''pattern'' to describe the latter. [[Larry Wall]], author of the Perl programming language, writes in an essay about the design of Raku:\n\n{{bq|1=\"Regular expressions\" [\u2026] are only marginally related to real regular expressions. Nevertheless, the term has grown with the capabilities of our pattern matching engines, so I'm not going to try to fight linguistic necessity here. I will, however, generally call them \"regexes\" (or \"regexen\", when I'm in an Anglo-Saxon mood).<ref name=\"Apocalypse5\"/>}}\n\nOther features not found in describing regular languages include assertions. These include the ubiquitous {{mono|^}} and {{mono|$}}, as well as some more sophiscated extensions like lookaround. They define the surrounding of a match and don't spill into the match itself, a feature only relevant for the use-case of string searching. Some of them can be simulated in a regular language by treating the surroundings as a part of the language as well.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wandering Logic |title=How to simulate lookaheads and lookbehinds in finite state automata? |url=https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/40058 |website=Computer Science Stack Exchange |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Implementations}}Implementations and running times==\nThere are at least three different [[algorithm]]s that decide whether and how a given regex matches a string.\n\nThe oldest and fastest relies on a result in formal language theory that allows every [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] (NFA) to be transformed into a [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA). The DFA can be constructed explicitly and then run on the resulting input string one symbol at a time. Constructing the DFA for a regular expression of size ''m'' has the time and memory cost of [[Big O notation|''O'']](2<sup>''m''</sup>), but it can be run on a string of size ''n'' in time ''O''(''n'').  Note that the size of the expression is the size after abbreviations, such as numeric quantifiers, have been expanded.\n\nAn alternative approach is to simulate the NFA directly, essentially building each DFA state on demand and then discarding it at the next step. This keeps the DFA implicit and avoids the exponential construction cost, but running cost rises to ''O''(''mn''). The explicit approach is called the DFA algorithm and the implicit approach the NFA algorithm. Adding caching to the NFA algorithm is often called the \"lazy DFA\" algorithm, or just the DFA algorithm without making a distinction. These algorithms are fast, but using them for recalling grouped subexpressions, lazy quantification, and similar features is tricky.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cox|2007}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Laurikari|2009}}</ref> Modern implementations include the re1-re2-sregex family based on Cox's code.\n\nThe third algorithm is to match the pattern against the input string by [[backtracking]]. This algorithm is commonly called NFA, but this terminology can be confusing. Its running time can be exponential, which simple implementations exhibit when matching against expressions like {{code|lang=perl|code=(a{{!}}aa)*b}} that contain both alternation and unbounded quantification and force the algorithm to consider an exponentially increasing number of sub-cases. This behavior can cause a security problem called [[Regular expression Denial of Service]] (ReDoS).\n\nAlthough backtracking implementations only give an exponential guarantee in the worst case, they provide much greater flexibility and expressive power. For example, any implementation which allows the use of backreferences, or implements the various extensions introduced by Perl, must include some kind of backtracking. Some implementations try to provide the best of both algorithms by first running a fast DFA algorithm, and revert to a potentially slower backtracking algorithm only when a backreference is encountered during the match. GNU grep (and the underlying gnulib DFA) uses such a strategy.<ref>{{cite web |title=gnulib/lib/dfa.c |url=https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gnulib.git;a=blob;f=lib/dfa.c |quote=If the scanner detects a transition on backref, it returns a kind of \"semi-success\" indicating that the match will have to be verified with a backtracking matcher.}}</ref>\n\nSublinear runtime algorithms have been achieved using [[Boyer\u2013Moore string-search algorithm|Boyer-Moore (BM) based algorithms]] and related DFA optimization techniques such as the reverse scan.<ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Kearns |first=Steven |eprint=1308.3822 |title=Sublinear Matching With Finite Automata Using Reverse Suffix Scanning |date=August 2013}}</ref> GNU grep, which supports a wide variety of POSIX syntaxes and extensions, uses BM for a first-pass prefiltering, and then uses an implicit DFA.

One naive method that duplicates a non-backtracking NFA for each backreference note has a complexity of {{tmath|{\\mathrm O}(n^{2k+2})}} time and {{tmath|{\\mathrm O}(n^{2k+1})}} space for a haystack of length n and k backreferences in the RegExp.<ref>{{cite web |title=travisdowns/polyregex |url=https://github.com/travisdowns/polyregex |date=5 July 2019}}</ref> A very recent theoretical work based on memory automata gives a tighter bound based on \"active\" variable nodes used, and a polynomial possibility for some backreferenced regexps.<ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Schmid |first=Markus L. |eprint=1903.05896 |title=Regular Expressions with Backreferences: Polynomial-Time Matching Techniques |date=March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Unicode==\nIn theoretical terms, any token set can be matched by regular expressions as long as it is pre-defined. In terms of historical implementations, regexes were originally written to use [[American Standard Code for Information Interchange|ASCII]] characters as their token set though regex libraries have supported numerous other [[character set]]s. Many modern regex engines offer at least some support for [[Unicode]]. In most respects it makes no difference what the character set is, but some issues do arise when extending regexes to support Unicode.\n\n* '''Supported encoding'''. Some regex libraries expect to work on some particular encoding instead of on abstract Unicode characters. Many of these require the [[UTF-8]] encoding, while others might expect [[UTF-16]], or [[UTF-32]]. In contrast, Perl and Java are agnostic on encodings, instead operating on decoded characters internally.\n* '''Supported Unicode range'''. Many regex engines support only the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]], that is, the characters which can be encoded with only 16 bits. Currently (as of 2016) only a few regex engines (e.g., Perl's and Java's) can handle the full 21-bit Unicode range.\n* '''Extending ASCII-oriented constructs to Unicode'''. For example, in ASCII-based implementations, character ranges of the form <code>[x-y]</code> are valid wherever ''x'' and ''y'' have [[code point]]s in the range [0x00,0x7F] and codepoint(''x'') \u2264 codepoint(''y''). The natural extension of such character ranges to Unicode would simply change the requirement that the endpoints lie in [0x00,0x7F] to the requirement that they lie in [0x0000,0x10FFFF]. However, in practice this is often not the case. Some implementations, such as that of [[Gawk (GNU package)|gawk]], do not allow character ranges to cross Unicode blocks. A range like [0x61,0x7F] is valid since both endpoints fall within the Basic Latin block, as is [0x0530,0x0560] since both endpoints fall within the Armenian block, but a range like [0x0061,0x0532] is invalid since it includes multiple Unicode blocks. Other engines, such as that of the [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] editor, allow block-crossing but the character values must not be more than 256 apart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/pattern.html#/%5B%5D |title=Vim documentation: pattern |publisher=Vimdoc.sourceforge.net |accessdate=2013-09-25}}</ref>\n* '''Case insensitivity'''. Some case-insensitivity flags affect only the ASCII characters. Other flags affect all characters. Some engines have two different flags, one for ASCII, the other for Unicode. Exactly which characters belong to the POSIX classes also varies.\n* '''Cousins of case insensitivity'''. As ASCII has case distinction, case insensitivity became a logical feature in text searching. Unicode introduced alphabetic scripts without case like [[Devan\u0101gar\u012b|Devanagari]]. For these, [[case sensitivity]] is not applicable. For scripts like Chinese, another distinction seems logical: between traditional and simplified. In Arabic scripts, insensitivity to [[IMFI|initial, medial, final, and isolated position]] may be desired. In Japanese, insensitivity between [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] is sometimes useful.\n* '''Normalization'''. Unicode has [[Unicode#Combining characters|combining characters]]. Like old typewriters, plain letters can be followed by one or more non-spacing symbols (usually diacritics like accent marks) to form a single printing character, but also provides precomposed characters, i.e. characters that already include one or more combining characters. A sequence of a character + combining character should be matched with the identical single precomposed character. The process of standardizing sequences of characters + combining characters is called normalization.\n* '''New control codes'''. Unicode introduced amongst others, [[byte order mark]]s and text direction markers. These codes might have to be dealt with in a special way.\n* '''Introduction of character classes for Unicode blocks, scripts, and numerous other character properties'''. Block properties are much less useful than script properties, because a block can have code points from several different scripts, and a script can have code points from several different blocks.<ref name=\"unicode\">{{cite web\n| title = UTS#18 on Unicode Regular Expressions, Annex A: Character Blocks\n| url = http://unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Character_Blocks\n| accessdate = 2010-02-05}}</ref> In [[Perl]] and the {{Javadoc:SE|package=java.util.regex|java/util/regex}} library, properties of the form <code>\\p{InX}</code> or <code>\\p{Block=X}</code> match characters in block ''X'' and <code>\\P{InX}</code> or <code>\\P{Block=X}</code> matches code points not in that block. Similarly, <code>\\p{Armenian}</code>, <code>\\p{IsArmenian}</code>, or <code>\\p{Script=Armenian}</code> matches any character in the Armenian script. In general, <code>\\p{X}</code> matches any character with either the binary property ''X'' or the general category ''X''. For example, <code>\\p{Lu}</code>, <code>\\p{Uppercase_Letter}</code>, or <code>\\p{GC=Lu}</code> matches any uppercase letter. Binary properties that are ''not'' general categories include <code>\\p{White_Space}</code>, <code>\\p{Alphabetic}</code>, <code>\\p{Math}</code>, and <code>\\p{Dash}</code>. Examples of non-binary properties are <code>\\p{Bidi_Class=Right_to_Left}</code>, <code>\\p{Word_Break=A_Letter}</code>, and <code>\\p{Numeric_Value=10}</code>.\n\n==Uses==\nRegexes are useful in a wide variety of [[text processing]] tasks, and more generally [[string processing]], where the data need not be textual. Common applications include [[data validation]], [[data scraping]] (especially [[web scraping]]), [[data wrangling]], simple [[parsing]], the production of [[syntax highlighting]] systems, and many other tasks.\n\nWhile regexes would be useful on Internet [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]]s, processing them across the entire database could consume excessive computer resources depending on the complexity and design of the regex. Although in many cases system administrators can run regex-based queries internally, most search engines do not offer regex support to the public. Notable exceptions: [[Google Code Search]], [[Exalead]]. Google Code Search has been shut down as of January 2012.<ref>{{cite web |first=Bradley |last=Horowitz |author-link=Bradley Horowitz |url=https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/fall-sweep.html |title=A fall sweep |date=24 October 2011 |access-date=4 May 2019 |work=[[Google Blog]]}}</ref>\nIt used a trigram index to speed queries.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cox |first=Russ |date=January 2012 |url=https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html |title=Regular Expression Matching with a Trigram Index, or How Google Code Search Worked |access-date=4 May 2019 |work=swtch.com}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nThe specific syntax rules vary depending on the specific implementation, [[programming language]], or [[Library (computing)|library]] in use. Additionally, the functionality of regex implementations can vary between [[Software versioning|version]]s.\n\nBecause regexes can be difficult to both explain and understand without examples, interactive websites for testing regexes are a useful resource for learning regexes by experimentation.\nThis section provides a basic description of some of the properties of regexes by way of illustration.\n\nThe following conventions are used in the examples.<ref name=\"clarify000\">The character 'm' is not always required to specify a [[Perl]] match operation. For example, <code>m/[^abc]/</code> could also be rendered as <code>/[^abc]/</code>. The 'm' is only necessary if the user wishes to specify a match operation without using a forward-slash as the regex [[delimiter]]. Sometimes it is useful to specify an alternate regex delimiter in order to avoid \"[[delimiter collision]]\". See '[http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html perldoc perlre]' for more details.</ref>\n\n metacharacter(s) ;; the metacharacters column specifies the regex syntax being demonstrated\n =~ m//           ;; indicates a regex '''match''' operation in Perl\n =~ s///          ;; indicates a regex '''substitution''' operation in Perl\n\nAlso worth noting is that these regexes are all Perl-like syntax. Standard [[#POSIX Basic Regular Expressions|POSIX]] regular expressions are different.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, the following examples conform to the [[Perl]] programming language, release 5.8.8, January 31, 2006. This means that other implementations may lack support for some parts of the syntax shown here (e.g. basic vs. extended regex, <code>\\( \\)</code> vs. <code>()</code>, or lack of <code>\\d</code> instead of [[POSIX]] <code>[:digit:]</code>).\n\nThe syntax and conventions used in these examples coincide with that of other programming environments as well.<ref>E.g., see ''[[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[O'Reilly Media#In a Nutshell|in a Nutshell]]'', p. 213; ''[[Python (programming language)|Python]] Scripting for Computational Science'', p. 320; Programming [[PHP]], p. 106.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This is known as the [[induction of regular languages]], and is part of the general problem of [[grammar induction]] in [[computational learning theory]]. Formally, given examples of strings in a regular language, and perhaps also given examples of strings ''not'' in that regular language, it is possible to induce a grammar for the language, i.e., a regular expression that generates that language. Not all regular languages can be induced in this way (see [[language identification in the limit]]), but many can. For example, the set of examples {1, 10, 100}, and negative set (of counterexamples) {11, 1001, 101, 0} can be used to induce the regular expression 1\u22c50* (1 followed by zero or more 0s).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of regular-expression engines]]\n* [[Extended Backus\u2013Naur form]]\n* [[Matching wildcards]]\n* [[Regular tree grammar]]\n* [[Thompson's construction]] \u2013 converts a regular expression into an equivalent [[nondeterministic finite automaton|nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Aho\n | first = Alfred V.\n | author-link =Alfred Aho\n | year = 1990\n | title = Algorithms for finding patterns in strings\n | editor-last = van Leeuwen\n | editor-first = Jan | editor-link = Jan van Leeuwen\n | work = Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science, volume A: Algorithms and Complexity\n | publisher = The MIT Press\n | pages = 255\u2013300\n | ref = harv\n | postscript = <!--None-->\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last1 = Aho\n | first1 = Alfred V.\n | last2 = Ullman\n | first2 = Jeffrey D.\n | authorlink2 = Jeffrey Ullman\n | year = 1992\n | title = Foundations of Computer Science\n | url = http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/focs.html\n | chapter = Chapter 10.

Usually such patterns are used by [[string searching algorithm]]s for \"find\" or \"find and replace\" operations on [[String (computer science)|strings]], or for input validation. It is a technique developed in [[theoretical computer science]] and [[formal language]] theory.\n\nThe concept arose in the 1950s when the American mathematician [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] formalized the description of a ''[[regular language]]''. The concept came into common use with [[Unix]] text-processing utilities. Different [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntaxes]] for writing regular expressions have existed since the 1980s<!---introduction of POSIX and Perl--->, one being the [[POSIX]] standard and another, widely used, being the [[Perl]] syntax.\n\nRegular expressions are used in [[search engine]]s, search and replace dialogs of [[word processor]]s and [[text editor]]s, in text processing utilities such as [[sed]] and [[AWK]] and in [[lexical analysis]]. Many [[programming language]]s provide regex capabilities either built-in or via [[Library (computing)|libraries]].<!-- not too much info here. Put it into its own chapter--><!--, built-in (for example [[Perl language structure#Regular expressions|Perl]], [[JavaScript]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[AWK]], and [[Tcl]]) and others via a [[standard library]] (for example [[.NET Framework|.NET languages]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[C POSIX library#regex.h|POSIX C]], and [[C++]] since [[C++11#regex|C++11]]). Most other languages offer regexes via a library.-->\n\n==Patterns==\nThe phrase ''regular expressions'', also called ''regexes'', is often used to mean the specific, standard textual syntax for representing patterns for matching text, as distinct from the mathematical notation described below. Each character in a regular expression (that is, each character in the string describing its pattern) is either a [[metacharacter]], having a special meaning, or a regular character that has a literal meaning. For example, in the regex <code>a.</code>, ''a'' is a literal character which matches just 'a', while '.' is a metacharacter that matches every character except a newline. Therefore, this regex matches, for example, 'a ', or 'ax', or 'a0'. Together, metacharacters and literal characters can be used to identify text of a given pattern, or process a number of instances of it. Pattern matches may vary from a precise equality to a very general similarity, as controlled by the metacharacters. For example, <code>.</code> is a very general pattern, <code><nowiki>[a-z]</nowiki></code> (match all lower case letters from 'a' to 'z') is less general and <code>a</code> is a precise pattern (matches just 'a'). The metacharacter syntax is designed specifically to represent prescribed targets in a concise and flexible way to direct the automation of [[text processing]] of a variety of input data, in a form easy to type using a standard [[ASCII]] [[computer keyboard|keyboard]].\n\nA very simple case of a regular expression in this syntax is to locate a word spelled two different ways in a [[text editor]], the regular expression <code>seriali[sz]e</code> matches both \"serialise\" and \"serialize\". [[Wildcard character|Wildcards]] also achieve this, but are more limited in what they can pattern, as they have fewer metacharacters and a simple language-base.\n\nThe usual context of [[wildcard character]]s is in [[glob (programming)|globbing]] similar names in a list of files, whereas regexes are usually employed in applications that pattern-match text strings in general. For example, the regex <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>^[ \\t]+|[ \\t]+$</source> matches excess whitespace at the beginning or end of a line. An advanced regular expression that matches any numeral is <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[+-]?(\\d+(\\.\\d+)?|\\.\\d+)([eE][+-]?\\d+)?</source>.\n\n[[File:Thompson-kleene-star.svg|right|thumb|[[Thompson's construction algorithm|Translating]] the [[Kleene star]]<br/>(''s''* means 'zero or more of ''s'' ')]]\nA '''regex processor''' translates a regular expression in the above syntax into an internal representation which can be executed and matched against a [[string (computing)|string]] representing the text being searched in. One possible approach is the [[Thompson's construction algorithm]] to construct a [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] (NFA), which is then [[Powerset construction|made deterministic]] and the resulting [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA) is run on the target text string to recognize substrings that match the regular expression.\nThe picture shows the NFA scheme <code>''N''(''s''*)</code> obtained from the regular expression <code>''s''*</code>, where ''s'' denotes a simpler regular expression in turn, which has already been [[Recursion (computer science)|recursively]] translated to the NFA ''N''(''s'').\n\n==History==\nRegular expressions originated in 1951, when mathematician [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] described [[regular language]]s using his mathematical notation called ''regular events''.{{sfn|Kleene|1951}}<ref name = \"Leung, New Mexico State University, 2010\" >{{ Cite web | url = https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/historical-projects/Projects/kleene.9.16.10.pdf | title = Regular Languages and Finite Automata | access-date = 13 August 2019 | first = Hing | last = Leung | date = 16 September 2010 | website = [[New Mexico State University]] | quote = The concept of regular events was introduced by Kleene via the definition of regular expressions. | format = pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131205193130/https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/historical-projects/Projects/kleene.9.16.10.pdf | archive-date = 5 December 2013  | df = dmy-all }}</ref> These arose in [[theoretical computer science]], in the subfields of [[automata theory]] (models of computation) and the description and classification of [[formal language]]s.

Regexes were subsequently adopted by a wide range of programs, with these early forms standardized in the [[POSIX.2]] standard in 1992.\n\nIn the 1980s the more complicated regexes arose in [[Perl]], which originally derived from a regex library written by [[Henry Spencer]] (1986), who later wrote an implementation of ''Advanced Regular Expressions'' for [[Tcl]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tcl.tk/doc/howto/regexp81.html | title = New Regular Expression Features in Tcl 8.1 | accessdate = 2013-10-11}}</ref> The Tcl library is a hybrid [[Nondeterministic finite automaton|NFA]]/[[Deterministic finite automaton|DFA]] implementation with improved performance characteristics.

These rules maintain existing features of Perl 5.x regexes, but also allow [[Backus\u2013Naur form|BNF]]-style definition of a [[recursive descent parser]] via sub-rules.\n\nThe use of regexes in structured information standards for document and database modeling started in the 1960s and expanded in the 1980s when industry standards like [[Standard Generalized Markup Language|ISO SGML]] (precursored by ANSI \"GCA 101-1983\") consolidated. The kernel of the [[XML schema#Validation|structure specification language]] standards consists of regexes. Its use is evident in the [[Document Type Definition|DTD]] element group syntax.\n\nStarting in 1997, [[Philip Hazel]] developed [[Perl Compatible Regular Expressions|PCRE]] (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions), which attempts to closely mimic Perl's regex functionality and is used by many modern tools including [[PHP]] and [[Apache HTTP Server]].\n\nToday, regexes are widely supported in programming languages, text processing programs (particularly [[Lexical analysis|lexers]]), advanced text editors, and some other programs. Regex support is part of the [[standard library]] of many programming languages, including [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and is built into the syntax of others, including Perl and [[ECMAScript]]. Implementations of regex functionality is often called a '''regex engine''', and a number of libraries are available for reuse. In the late 2010s, several companies started to offer hardware, [[FPGA]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://grovf.com/products/gregex|title=GROVF {{!}} Big Data Analytics Acceleration|website=grovf.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>, [[GPU]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bkase.github.io/CUDA-grep/finalreport.html|title=CUDA grep|website=bkase.github.io|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref> implementations of [[PCRE]] compatible '''regex engines''' that are faster compared to [[Central processing unit|CPU]] implementations'''.'''\n\n==Basic concepts==\nA regular expression, often called a ''pattern'', specifies a [[Set (computer science)|set]] of strings required for a particular purpose. A simple way to specify a finite set of strings is to list its [[Data element|elements]] or members. However, there are often more concise ways: for example, the set containing the three strings \"Handel\", \"H\u00e4ndel\", and \"Haendel\" can be specified by the pattern <code>H(\u00e4|ae?)ndel</code>; we say that this pattern ''matches'' each of the three strings. In most [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]]s, if there exists at least one regular expression that matches a particular set then there exists an infinite number of other regular expressions that also match it\u2014the specification is not unique. Most formalisms provide the following operations to construct regular expressions.\n\n;Boolean \"or\"\n:A [[vertical bar]] separates alternatives. For example, {{code|lang=perl|code=gray{{!}}grey}} can match \"gray\" or \"grey\".\n;Grouping\n:[[Parentheses]] are used to define the scope and precedence of the [[Operator (programming)|operators]] (among other uses). For example, <code>gray|grey</code> and {{code|lang=perl|code=gr(a{{!}}e)y}} are equivalent patterns which both describe the set of \"gray\" or \"grey\".\n;Quantification\n:A [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] after a [[Lexical analysis#Token|token]] (such as a character) or group specifies how often that a preceding element is allowed to occur. The most common quantifiers are the [[question mark]] <code>?</code>, the [[asterisk]] <code>*</code> (derived from the [[Kleene star]]), and the [[plus sign]] <code>+</code> ([[Kleene plus]]).\n:{|\n| style=\"width:15px; vertical-align:top;\" | <code>'''?'''</code>\n|The question mark indicates ''zero or one'' occurrences of the preceding element. For example, <code><!--DON'T CHANGE THIS TO \"colo?r\"! REGULAR EXPRESSIONS DON'T WORK LIKE WILDCARDS!--><!--Why not? Give reason in main context.!-->colou?r</code> matches both \"color\" and \"colour\".\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" | <code>'''<nowiki>*</nowiki>'''</code>\n|The asterisk indicates ''zero or more'' occurrences of the preceding element. For example, <code>ab*c</code> matches \"ac\", \"abc\", \"abbc\", \"abbbc\", and so on.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" | <code>'''+'''</code>\n|The plus sign indicates ''one or more'' occurrences of the preceding element. For example, <code>ab+c</code> matches \"abc\", \"abbc\", \"abbbc\", and so on, but not \"ac\".\n|-\n|<code>'''{n}'''</code><ref name=\"grep\">grep(1) man page</ref>\n| The preceding item is matched exactly ''n'' times.\n|-\n|<code>'''{min,}'''</code><ref name=\"grep\"/>\n| The preceding item is matched ''min'' or more times.\n|-\n|<code>'''{min,max}'''</code><ref name=\"grep\"/>\n| The preceding item is matched at least ''min'' times, but not more than ''max'' times.\n|}\n;Wildcard\nThe wildcard <code>'''.'''</code> matches any character. For example, <code>a.b</code> matches any string that contains an \"a\", then any other character and then a \"b\", <code>a.*b</code> matches any string that contains an \"a\" and a \"b\" at some later point.\n\nThese constructions can be combined to form arbitrarily complex expressions, much like one can construct arithmetical expressions from numbers and the operations +, \u2212, \u00d7, and \u00f7. For example, <code>H(ae?|\u00e4)ndel</code> and {{code|lang=perl|code=H(a{{!}}ae{{!}}\u00e4)ndel}} are both valid patterns which match the same strings as the earlier example, <code>H(\u00e4|ae?)ndel</code>.\n\nThe precise [[syntax]] for regular expressions varies among tools and with context; more detail is given in {{slink||Syntax}}.\n\n==Formal language theory==\nRegular expressions describe [[regular language]]s in [[Formal language|formal language theory]]. They have the same expressive power as [[regular grammar]]s.\n\n===Formal definition===\nRegular expressions consist of constants, which denote sets of strings, and operator symbols, which denote operations over these sets. The following definition is standard, and found as such in most textbooks on formal language theory.<ref name=\"HopcroftMotwaniUllman01\">{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Motwani|Ullman|2000}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Sipser|1998}}</ref> Given a finite [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] \u03a3, the following constants are defined\nas regular expressions:\n*(''empty set'') \u2205 denoting the set \u2205.\n*(''[[empty string]]'') \u03b5 denoting the set containing only the \"empty\" string, which has no characters at all.\n*(''[[string literal|literal character]]'') <code>a</code> in \u03a3 denoting the set containing only the character ''a''.\n\nGiven regular expressions R and S, the following operations over them are defined\nto produce regular expressions:\n* (''[[concatenation]]'') ''RS'' denotes the set of strings that can be obtained by concatenating a string in R and a string in S. For example, let R = {\"ab\", \"c\"}, and S = {\"d\", \"ef\"}. Then, RS = {\"abd\", \"abef\", \"cd\", \"cef\"}.\n*(''[[alternation (formal language theory)|alternation]]'') ''R'' | ''S'' denotes the [[set union]] of sets described by ''R'' and ''S''. For example, if R describes {\"ab\", \"c\"} and S describes {\"ab\", \"d\", \"ef\"}, expression ''R'' | ''S'' describes {\"ab\", \"c\", \"d\", \"ef\"}.\n*(''[[Kleene star]]'') ''R''* denotes the smallest [[subset|superset]] of the set described by ''R'' that contains \u03b5 and is [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under string concatenation. This is the set of all strings that can be made by concatenating any finite number (including zero) of strings from the set described by ''R''. For example, {\"0\",\"1\"}* is the set of all finite [[binary string]]s (including the empty string), and {\"ab\", \"c\"}* = {\u03b5, \"ab\", \"c\", \"abab\", \"abc\", \"cab\", \"cc\", \"ababab\", \"abcab\", ... }.\n\nTo avoid parentheses it is assumed that the Kleene star has the highest priority, then concatenation and then alternation. If there is no ambiguity then parentheses may be omitted. For example, <code>(ab)c</code> can be written as <code>abc</code>, and <code>a|(b(c*))</code> can be written as <code>a|bc*</code>.\nMany textbooks use the symbols \u222a, +, or \u2228 for alternation instead of the vertical bar.\n\n'''Examples:'''\n*<code>a|b*</code> denotes {\u03b5, \"a\", \"b\", \"bb\", \"bbb\", ...}\n*<code>(a|b)*</code> denotes the set of all strings with no symbols other than \"a\" and \"b\", including the empty string: {\u03b5, \"a\", \"b\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"bb\", \"aaa\", ...}\n*<code>ab*(c|\u03b5)</code> denotes the set of strings starting with \"a\", then zero or more \"b\"s and finally optionally a \"c\": {\"a\", \"ac\", \"ab\", \"abc\", \"abb\", \"abbc\", ...}\n*<code>(0|(1(01*0)*1))*</code> denotes the set of binary numbers that are multiples of 3: { \u03b5, \"0\", \"00\", \"11\", \"000\", \"011\", \"110\", \"0000\", \"0011\", \"0110\", \"1001\", \"1100\", \"1111\", \"00000\", ... }\n\n===Expressive power and compactness===\nThe formal definition of regular expressions is minimal on purpose, and avoids defining <code>?</code> and <code>+</code>\u2014these can be expressed as follows: <code>a+</code> = <code>aa*</code>, and <code>a?</code> = <code>(a|\u03b5)</code>. Sometimes the [[set complement|complement]] operator is added, to give a ''generalized regular expression''; here ''R<sup>c</sup>'' matches all strings over \u03a3* that do not match ''R''. In principle, the complement operator is redundant, because it doesn't grant any more expressive power. However, it can make a regular expression much more concise\u2014eliminating all complement operators from a regular expression can cause a [[Double exponential function|double exponentially]] blow-up of its length.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gelade|Neven|2008}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Gruber|Holzer|2008}}</ref>\n\nRegular expressions in this sense can express the regular languages, exactly the class of languages accepted by [[deterministic finite automata]]. There is, however, a significant difference in compactness. Some classes of regular languages can only be described by deterministic finite automata whose size grows [[exponential growth|exponentially]] in the size of the shortest equivalent regular expressions. The standard example here is the languages\n''L<sub>k</sub>'' consisting of all strings over the alphabet {''a'',''b''} whose ''k''<sup>th</sup>-from-last letter equals&nbsp;''a''. On one hand, a regular expression describing ''L''<sub>4</sub> is given by\n<math>(a\\mid b)^*a(a\\mid b)(a\\mid b)(a\\mid b)</math>.\n\nGeneralizing this pattern to ''L<sub>k</sub>'' gives the expression:\n<math>(a\\mid b)^*a\\underbrace{(a\\mid b)(a\\mid b)\\cdots(a\\mid b)}_{k-1\\text{ times}}. \\, </math>\n\nOn the other hand, it is known that every deterministic finite automaton accepting the language ''L<sub>k</sub>'' must have at least 2<sup>''k''</sup> states. Luckily, there is a simple mapping from regular expressions to the more general [[nondeterministic finite automata]] (NFAs) that does not lead to such a blowup in size; for this reason NFAs are often used as alternative representations of regular languages. NFAs are a simple variation of the type-3 [[formal grammar|grammars]] of the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].<ref name=\"HopcroftMotwaniUllman01\"/>\n\nIn the opposite direction, there are many languages easily described by a DFA that are not easily described a regular expression. For instance, determining the validity of a given [[ISBN]] requires computing the modulus of the integer base 11, and can be easily implemented with an 11-state DFA. However, a regular expression to answer the same problem of divisibility by 11 is at least multiple megabytes in length.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nGiven a regular expression, [[Thompson's construction algorithm]] computes an equivalent nondeterministic finite automaton. A conversion in the opposite direction is achieved by [[Kleene's algorithm]].\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that many real-world \"regular expression\" engines implement features that cannot be described by the regular expressions in the sense of formal language theory; rather, they implement ''regexes''. See [[#Patterns for non-regular languages|below]] for more on this.\n\n===Deciding equivalence of regular expressions===\nAs seen in many of the examples above, there is more than one way to construct a regular expression to achieve the same results.\n\nIt is possible to write an [[algorithm]] that, for two given regular expressions, decides whether the described languages are equal; the algorithm reduces each expression to a [[minimal deterministic finite state machine]], and determines whether they are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] (equivalent).\n\nAlgebraic laws for regular expressions can be obtained using a method by Gischer which is best explained along an example: In order to check whether (''X''+''Y'')<sup>*</sup> and (''X''<sup>*</sup> ''Y''<sup>*</sup>)<sup>*</sup> denote the same regular language, for all regular expressions ''X'', ''Y'', it is necessary and sufficient to check whether the particular regular expressions (''a''+''b'')<sup>*</sup> and (''a''<sup>*</sup> ''b''<sup>*</sup>)<sup>*</sup> denote the same language over the alphabet \u03a3={''a'',''b''}. More generally, an equation ''E''=''F'' between regular-expression terms with variables holds if, and only if, its instantiation with different variables replaced by different symbol constants holds.<ref>{{cite report | url= | author=Jay L.

As simple as the regular expressions are, there is no method to systematically rewrite them to some normal form. The lack of axiom in the past led to the [[star height problem]]. In 1991, [[Dexter Kozen]] axiomatized regular expressions as a [[Kleene algebra#History|Kleene algebra]], using equational and [[Horn clause]] axioms.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kozen|1991}}{{page needed|date=February 2015}}</ref>\nAlready in 1964, Redko had proved that no finite set of purely equational axioms can characterize the algebra of regular languages.<ref>{{cite journal| author=V.N.

The pattern is composed of a sequence of ''atoms''. An atom is a single point within the regex pattern which it tries to match to the target string. The simplest atom is a literal, but grouping parts of the pattern to match an atom will require using <code>(&nbsp;)</code> as metacharacters. Metacharacters help form: ''atoms''; ''quantifiers'' telling how many atoms (and whether it is a [[#Lazy_matching|''greedy'' quantifier]] or not); a logical OR character, which offers a set of alternatives, and a logical NOT character, which negates an atom's existence; and backreferences to refer to previous atoms of a completing pattern of atoms. A match is made, not when all the atoms of the string are matched, but rather when all the pattern atoms in the regex have matched. The idea is to make a small pattern of characters stand for a large number of possible strings, rather than compiling a large list of all the literal possibilities.\n\nDepending on the regex processor there are about fourteen metacharacters, characters that may or may not have their [[literal (computer programming)|literal]] character meaning, depending on context, or whether they are \"escaped\", i.e. preceded by an [[escape sequence]], in this case, the backslash <code>\\</code>. Modern and POSIX extended regexes use metacharacters more often than their literal meaning, so to avoid \"backslash-osis\" or [[leaning toothpick syndrome]] it makes sense to have a metacharacter escape to a literal mode; but starting out, it makes more sense to have the four bracketing metacharacters <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>{&nbsp;}</code> be primarily literal, and \"escape\" this usual meaning to become metacharacters. Common standards implement both. The usual metacharacters are <code> {}[]()^$.|*+?</code> and <code>\\</code>. The usual characters that become metacharacters when escaped are <code>dswDSW</code> and <code>N</code>.\n\n===Delimiters===\nWhen entering a regex in a programming language, they may be represented as a usual string literal, hence usually quoted; this is common in C, Java, and Python for instance, where the regex <code>re</code> is entered as <code>\"re\"</code>. However, they are often written with slashes as [[delimiter]]s, as in <code>/re/</code> for the regex <code>re</code>. This originates in [[Ed (text editor)|ed]], where <code>/</code> is the editor command for searching, and an expression <code>/re/</code> can be used to specify a range of lines (matching the pattern), which can be combined with other commands on either side, most famously <code>g/re/p</code> as in [[grep]] (\"global regex print\"), which is included in most [[Unix]]-based operating systems, such as [[Linux]] distributions. A similar convention is used in [[sed]], where search and replace is given by <code>s/re/replacement/</code> and patterns can be joined with a comma to specify a range of lines as in <code>/re1/,/re2/</code>. This notation is particularly well known due to its use in [[Perl]], where it forms part of the syntax distinct from normal string literals. In some cases, such as sed and Perl, alternative delimiters can be used to avoid collision with contents, and to avoid having to escape occurrences of the delimiter character in the contents. For example, in sed the command <code>s,/,X,</code> will replace a <code>/</code> with an <code>X</code>, using commas as delimiters.\n\n===Standards===\n{{anchor|POSIX}}The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] [[POSIX]] standard has three sets of compliance: '''BRE''' (Basic Regular Expressions),<ref>ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993 ''Information technology \u2013 Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) \u2013 Part 2: Shell and Utilities'', successively revised as ISO/IEC 9945-2:2002 ''Information technology \u2013 Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) \u2013 Part 2: System Interfaces'', ISO/IEC 9945-2:2003, and currently ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945:2009 ''Information technology \u2013 Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX\u00ae) Base Specifications, Issue 7''</ref> '''ERE''' (Extended Regular Expressions), and '''SRE''' (Simple Regular Expressions). SRE is [[Deprecation|deprecated]],<ref>The Single Unix Specification (Version 2)</ref> in favor of BRE, as both provide [[backward compatibility]]. The subsection below covering the ''character classes'' applies to both BRE and ERE.\n\nBRE and ERE work together. ERE adds <code>?</code>, <code>+</code>, and <code>|</code>, and it removes the need to escape the metacharacters <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>{&nbsp;}</code>, which are ''required'' in BRE. Furthermore, as long as the POSIX standard syntax for regexes is adhered to, there can be, and often is, additional syntax to serve specific (yet POSIX compliant) applications. Although POSIX.2 leaves some implementation specifics undefined, BRE and ERE provide a \"standard\" which has since been adopted as the default syntax of many tools, where the choice of BRE or ERE modes is usually a supported option. For example, [[GNU]] <code>grep</code> has the following options: \"<code>grep -E</code>\" for ERE, and \"<code>grep -G</code>\" for BRE (the default), and \"<code>grep -P</code>\" for [[Perl]] regexes.\n\nPerl regexes have become a de facto standard, having a rich and powerful set of atomic expressions. Perl has no \"basic\" or \"extended\" levels. As in POSIX EREs, <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>{&nbsp;}</code> are treated as metacharacters unless escaped; other metacharacters are known to be literal or symbolic based on context alone. Additional functionality includes [[#Lazy matching|lazy matching]], [[backreferences]], named capture groups, and [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] patterns.\n\n====POSIX basic and extended====\nIn the [[POSIX]] standard, Basic Regular Syntax ('''BRE''') requires that the [[metacharacter]]s <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>{&nbsp;}</code> be designated <code>\\(\\)</code> and <code>\\{\\}</code>, whereas Extended Regular Syntax ('''ERE''') does not.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Metacharacter\n! Description\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>^</code>\n|Matches the starting position within the string. In line-based tools, it matches the starting position of any line.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>.</code>\n|Matches any single character (many applications exclude [[newline]]s, and exactly which characters are considered newlines is flavor-, character-encoding-, and platform-specific, but it is safe to assume that the line feed character is included). Within POSIX bracket expressions, the dot character matches a literal dot. For example, <code>a.c</code> matches \"abc\", etc., but <code>[a.c]</code> matches only \"a\", \".\", or \"c\".\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>[&nbsp;]</code>\n|A bracket expression. Matches a single character that is contained within the brackets. For example, <code>[abc]</code> matches \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\". <code>[a-z]</code> specifies a range which matches any lowercase letter from \"a\" to \"z\". These forms can be mixed: <code>[abcx-z]</code> matches \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"x\", \"y\", or \"z\", as does <code>[a-cx-z]</code>.\nThe <code>-</code> character is treated as a literal character if it is the last or the first (after the <code>^</code>, if present) character within the brackets: <code>[abc-]</code>, <code>[-abc]</code>. Note that backslash escapes are not allowed. The <code>]</code> character can be included in a bracket expression if it is the first (after the <code>^</code>) character: <code>[]abc]</code>.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>[^&nbsp;]</code>\n|Matches a single character that is not contained within the brackets. For example, <code>[^abc]</code> matches any character other than \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\". <code>[^a-z]</code> matches any single character that is not a lowercase letter from \"a\" to \"z\". Likewise, literal characters and ranges can be mixed.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>$</code>\n|Matches the ending position of the string or the position just before a string-ending newline. In line-based tools, it matches the ending position of any line.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>( )</code>\n|Defines a marked subexpression. The string matched within the parentheses can be recalled later (see the next entry, <code>\\''n''</code>). A marked subexpression is also called a block or capturing group. '''BRE mode requires {{nowrap|<code>\\(&nbsp;\\)</code>}}'''.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>\\''n''</code>\n|Matches what the ''n''th marked subexpression matched, where ''n'' is a digit from 1 to 9. This construct is vaguely defined in the POSIX.2 standard. Some tools allow referencing more than nine capturing groups. Also known as a backreference.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>*</code>\n|Matches the preceding element zero or more times. For example, <code>ab*c</code> matches \"ac\", \"abc\", \"abbbc\", etc. <code>[xyz]*</code> matches \"\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"zx\", \"zyx\", \"xyzzy\", and so on. <code>(ab)*</code> matches \"\", \"ab\", \"abab\", \"ababab\", and so on.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!{{nowrap|<code>{''m'',''n''}</code>}}\n|Matches the preceding element at least ''m'' and not more than ''n'' times. For example, <code>a{3,5}</code> matches only \"aaa\", \"aaaa\", and \"aaaaa\". This is not found in a few older instances of regexes. '''BRE mode requires <code>{{nowrap|\\{''m'',''n''\\}}}</code>'''.\n\n|}\n\n'''Examples:'''\n*<code>.at</code> matches any three-character string ending with \"at\", including \"hat\", \"cat\", and \"bat\".\n*<code>[hc]at</code> matches \"hat\" and \"cat\".\n*<code>[^b]at</code> matches all strings matched by <code>.at</code> except \"bat\".\n*<code>[^hc]at</code> matches all strings matched by <code>.at</code> other than \"hat\" and \"cat\".\n*<code>^[hc]at</code> matches \"hat\" and \"cat\", but only at the beginning of the string or line.\n*<code>[hc]at$</code> matches \"hat\" and \"cat\", but only at the end of the string or line.\n*<code>\\[.\\]</code> matches any single character surrounded by \"[\" and \"]\" since the brackets are escaped, for example: \"[a]\" and \"[b]\".\n*<code>s.*</code> matches s followed by zero or more characters, for example: \"s\" and \"saw\" and \"seed\".\n\n====POSIX extended====\nThe meaning of metacharacters [[escape character|escaped]] with a backslash is reversed for some characters in the POSIX Extended Regular Expression ('''ERE''') syntax. With this syntax, a backslash causes the metacharacter to be treated as a literal character. So, for example, <code>\\(&nbsp;\\)</code> is now <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>\\{&nbsp;\\}</code> is now <code>{&nbsp;}</code>. Additionally, support is removed for <code>\\''n''</code> backreferences and the following metacharacters are added:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Metacharacter\n! Description\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>?</code>\n|Matches the preceding element zero or one time. For example, <code>ab?c</code> matches only \"ac\" or \"abc\".\n|-\n!<code>+</code>\n|Matches the preceding element one or more times. For example, <code>ab+c</code> matches \"abc\", \"abbc\", \"abbbc\", and so on, but not \"ac\".\n|-\n!<code><nowiki>|</nowiki></code>\n|The choice (also known as alternation or set union) operator matches either the expression before or the expression after the operator. For example, <code><nowiki>abc|def</nowiki></code> matches \"abc\" or \"def\".</td>\n|}\n\n'''Examples:'''\n*<code>[hc]?at</code> matches \"at\", \"hat\", and \"cat\".\n*<code>[hc]*at</code> matches \"at\", \"hat\", \"cat\", \"hhat\", \"chat\", \"hcat\", \"cchchat\", and so on.\n*<code>[hc]+at</code> matches \"hat\", \"cat\", \"hhat\", \"chat\", \"hcat\", \"cchchat\", and so on, but not \"at\".\n*<code>cat|dog</code> matches \"cat\" or \"dog\".\n\nPOSIX Extended Regular Expressions can often be used with modern Unix utilities by including the [[command line]] flag <var>-E</var>.\n\n====Character classes====\nThe character class is the most basic regex concept after a literal match. It makes one small sequence of characters match a larger set of characters. For example, <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[A-Z]</source> could stand for the uppercase alphabet in the English language, and <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>\\d</source> could mean any digit. Character classes apply to both POSIX levels.\n\nWhen specifying a range of characters, such as <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[a-Z]</source> (i.e. lowercase ''<source lang=\"ragel\" inline>a</source>'' to uppercase ''<source lang=\"ragel\" inline>Z</source>''), the computer's locale settings determine the contents by the numeric ordering of the character encoding. They could store digits in that sequence, or the ordering could be ''abc\u2026zABC\u2026Z'', or ''aAbBcC\u2026zZ''. So the POSIX standard defines a character class, which will be known by the regex processor installed. Those definitions are in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! POSIX !!

For example, <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[[:upper:]ab]</source> matches the uppercase letters and lowercase \"a\" and \"b\".\n\nAn additional non-POSIX class understood by some tools is <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[:word:]</source>, which is usually defined as <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[:alnum:]</source> plus underscore. This reflects the fact that in many programming languages these are the characters that may be used in identifiers. The editor [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] further distinguishes ''word'' and ''word-head'' classes (using the notation <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>\\w</source> and <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>\\h</source>) since in many programming languages the characters that can begin an identifier are not the same as those that can occur in other positions: numbers are generally excluded, so an identifier would look like <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>\\h\\w*</source> or <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[[:alpha:]_][[:alnum:]_]*</source> in POSIX notation.\n\nNote that what the POSIX regex standards call ''character classes'' are commonly referred to as ''POSIX character classes'' in other regex flavors which support them. With most other regex flavors, the term ''character class'' is used to describe what POSIX calls ''bracket expressions''.\n\n===Perl and PCRE===\n{{See also|Perl Compatible Regular Expressions}}\nBecause of its expressive power and (relative) ease of reading, many other utilities and programming languages have adopted syntax similar to [[Perl]]'s &mdash; for example, [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Qt (software)|Qt]], Microsoft's [[.NET Framework]], and [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]]. Some languages and tools such as [[Boost C++ Libraries|Boost]] and [[PHP]] support multiple regex flavors. Perl-derivative regex implementations are not identical and usually implement a subset of features found in Perl 5.0, released in 1994. Perl sometimes does incorporate features initially found in other languages. For example, Perl 5.10 implements syntactic extensions originally developed in PCRE and Python.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#PCRE%2fPython-Support | title= Perl Regular Expression Documentation |publisher=perldoc.perl.org | accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Lazy matching===\nIn Python and some<!---should be 'many', or 'most', or 'a few', or ...?---> other implementations (e.g. Java), the three common quantifiers (<code>*</code>, <code>+</code> and <code>?</code>) are [[greedy algorithm|greedy]] by default because they match as many characters as possible.<ref name=py-re>{{cite web|title=Regular Expression Syntax|url=https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax|website=Python 3.5.0 documentation|publisher=[[Python Software Foundation]]|accessdate=10 October 2015}}</ref> The regex <code>\".+\"</code> (including the double-quotes) applied to the string\n\n \"Ganymede,\" he continued, \"is the largest moon in the Solar System.\"\n\nmatches the entire line (because the entire line begins and ends with a double-quote) instead of matching only the first part, <code>\"Ganymede,\"</code>. The aforementioned quantifiers may, however, be made ''lazy'' or ''minimal'' or ''reluctant'', matching as few characters as possible, by appending a question mark: <code>\".+?\"</code> matches only <code>\"Ganymede,\"</code>.<ref name=py-re/>\n\nHowever, the whole sentence can still be matched in some circumstances. The question-mark operator does not change the meaning of the dot operator, so this still can match the double-quotes in the input. A pattern like <code>\".*?\" EOF</code> will still match the whole input if this is the string:\n\n \"Ganymede,\" he continued, \"is the largest moon in the Solar System.\" EOF\n\nTo ensure that the double-quotes cannot be part of the match, the dot has to be replaced, e. g. like this: <code>\"[^\"]*\"</code> This will match a quoted text part without additional double-quotes in it. (By removing possibilities for a fixed suffix to be matched, one also transforms the lazy-match to a greedy-match.)\n\n===Possessive matching===\nIn Java, quantifiers may be made ''possessive'' by appending a plus sign, which disables backing off (in a backtracking engine), even if doing so would allow the overall match to succeed:<ref name=es-re>{{cite web|title=Essential classes: Regular Expressions: Quantifiers: Differences Among Greedy, Reluctant, and Possessive Quantifiers|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/quant.html#difs|website=The Java Tutorials|publisher=[[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref> While the regex <code>\".*\"</code> applied to the string\n\n \"Ganymede,\" he continued, \"is the largest moon in the Solar System.\"\n\nmatches the entire line, the regex <code>\".*+\"</code> does {{em|not match at all}}, because <code>.*+</code> consumes the entire input, including the final <code>\"</code>. Thus, possessive quantifiers are most useful with negated character classes, e.g. <code>\"[^\"]*+\"</code>, which matches <code>\"Ganymede,\"</code> when applied to the same string.\n\nAnother common extension serving the same function is atomic grouping, which disables backtracking for a parenthesized group. The typical syntax is {{mono|1=(?&gt;group)}}. For example, while {{mono|1=^(wi{{!}}w)i$}} matches both {{mono|wi}} and {{mono|wii}}, {{mono|1=^(?&gt;wi{{!}}w)i$}} only matches {{mono|wii}} because the engine is forbidden from backtracking and try with setting the group as \"w\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Atomic Grouping |url=https://www.regular-expressions.info/atomic.html |website=Regex Tutorial |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nPossessive quantifiers are easier to implement than greedy and lazy quantifiers, and are typically more efficient at runtime.<ref name=es-re/>\n\n==Patterns for non-regular languages==\nMany features found in virtually all modern regular expression libraries provide an expressive power that far exceeds the [[regular language]]s. For example, many implementations allow grouping subexpressions with parentheses and recalling the value they match in the same expression (''{{visible anchor|backreferences}}''). This means that, among other things, a pattern can match strings of repeated words like \"papa\" or \"WikiWiki\", called ''squares'' in formal language theory. The pattern for these strings is <code>(.+)\\1</code>.\n\nThe language of squares is not regular, nor is it [[context-free language|context-free]], due to the [[Pumping lemma for context-free languages|pumping lemma]]. However, [[pattern matching]] with an unbounded number of backreferences, as supported by numerous modern tools, is still [[context-sensitive language|context sensitive]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Cezar C\u00e2mpeanu and Kai Salomaa, and Sheng Yu | title=A Formal Study of Practical Regular Expressions | journal=International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science | volume=14 | number=6 | pages=1007\u20131018 | url=http://137.149.157.5/Articles/index.php?aid=1<!---This url was taken from C\u00e2mpeanu's publications page http://www.csit.upei.ca/~ccampeanu/Research/RJ--->| date=Dec 2003 | doi=10.1142/S012905410300214X }} Theorem 3 (p.9)</ref> The general problem of matching any number of backreferences is [[NP-complete]], growing exponentially by the number of backref groups used.<ref>{{cite web |title=Perl Regular Expression Matching is NP-Hard |url=https://perl.plover.com/NPC/ |website=perl.plover.com}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many tools, libraries, and engines that provide such constructions still use the term ''regular expression'' for their patterns. This has led to a nomenclature where the term regular expression has different meanings in [[formal language|formal language theory]] and pattern matching. For this reason, some people have taken to using the term ''regex'', ''regexp'', or simply ''pattern'' to describe the latter. [[Larry Wall]], author of the Perl programming language, writes in an essay about the design of Raku:\n\n{{bq|1=\"Regular expressions\" [\u2026] are only marginally related to real regular expressions. Nevertheless, the term has grown with the capabilities of our pattern matching engines, so I'm not going to try to fight linguistic necessity here. I will, however, generally call them \"regexes\" (or \"regexen\", when I'm in an Anglo-Saxon mood).<ref name=\"Apocalypse5\"/>}}\n\nOther features not found in describing regular languages include assertions. These include the ubiquitous {{mono|^}} and {{mono|$}}, as well as some more sophiscated extensions like lookaround. They define the surrounding of a match and don't spill into the match itself, a feature only relevant for the use-case of string searching. Some of them can be simulated in a regular language by treating the surroundings as a part of the language as well.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wandering Logic |title=How to simulate lookaheads and lookbehinds in finite state automata? |url=https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/40058 |website=Computer Science Stack Exchange |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Implementations}}Implementations and running times==\nThere are at least three different [[algorithm]]s that decide whether and how a given regex matches a string.\n\nThe oldest and fastest relies on a result in formal language theory that allows every [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] (NFA) to be transformed into a [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA). The DFA can be constructed explicitly and then run on the resulting input string one symbol at a time. Constructing the DFA for a regular expression of size ''m'' has the time and memory cost of [[Big O notation|''O'']](2<sup>''m''</sup>), but it can be run on a string of size ''n'' in time ''O''(''n'').  Note that the size of the expression is the size after abbreviations, such as numeric quantifiers, have been expanded.\n\nAn alternative approach is to simulate the NFA directly, essentially building each DFA state on demand and then discarding it at the next step. This keeps the DFA implicit and avoids the exponential construction cost, but running cost rises to ''O''(''mn''). The explicit approach is called the DFA algorithm and the implicit approach the NFA algorithm. Adding caching to the NFA algorithm is often called the \"lazy DFA\" algorithm, or just the DFA algorithm without making a distinction. These algorithms are fast, but using them for recalling grouped subexpressions, lazy quantification, and similar features is tricky.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cox|2007}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Laurikari|2009}}</ref> Modern implementations include the re1-re2-sregex family based on Cox's code.\n\nThe third algorithm is to match the pattern against the input string by [[backtracking]]. This algorithm is commonly called NFA, but this terminology can be confusing. Its running time can be exponential, which simple implementations exhibit when matching against expressions like {{code|lang=perl|code=(a{{!}}aa)*b}} that contain both alternation and unbounded quantification and force the algorithm to consider an exponentially increasing number of sub-cases. This behavior can cause a security problem called [[Regular expression Denial of Service]] (ReDoS).\n\nAlthough backtracking implementations only give an exponential guarantee in the worst case, they provide much greater flexibility and expressive power. For example, any implementation which allows the use of backreferences, or implements the various extensions introduced by Perl, must include some kind of backtracking. Some implementations try to provide the best of both algorithms by first running a fast DFA algorithm, and revert to a potentially slower backtracking algorithm only when a backreference is encountered during the match. GNU grep (and the underlying gnulib DFA) uses such a strategy.<ref>{{cite web |title=gnulib/lib/dfa.c |url=https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gnulib.git;a=blob;f=lib/dfa.c |quote=If the scanner detects a transition on backref, it returns a kind of \"semi-success\" indicating that the match will have to be verified with a backtracking matcher.}}</ref>\n\nSublinear runtime algorithms have been achieved using [[Boyer\u2013Moore string-search algorithm|Boyer-Moore (BM) based algorithms]] and related DFA optimization techniques such as the reverse scan.<ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Kearns |first=Steven |eprint=1308.3822 |title=Sublinear Matching With Finite Automata Using Reverse Suffix Scanning |date=August 2013}}</ref> GNU grep, which supports a wide variety of POSIX syntaxes and extensions, uses BM for a first-pass prefiltering, and then uses an implicit DFA.

One naive method that duplicates a non-backtracking NFA for each backreference note has a complexity of {{tmath|{\\mathrm O}(n^{2k+2})}} time and {{tmath|{\\mathrm O}(n^{2k+1})}} space for a haystack of length n and k backreferences in the RegExp.<ref>{{cite web |title=travisdowns/polyregex |url=https://github.com/travisdowns/polyregex |date=5 July 2019}}</ref> A very recent theoretical work based on memory automata gives a tighter bound based on \"active\" variable nodes used, and a polynomial possibility for some backreferenced regexps.<ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Schmid |first=Markus L. |eprint=1903.05896 |title=Regular Expressions with Backreferences: Polynomial-Time Matching Techniques |date=March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Unicode==\nIn theoretical terms, any token set can be matched by regular expressions as long as it is pre-defined. In terms of historical implementations, regexes were originally written to use [[American Standard Code for Information Interchange|ASCII]] characters as their token set though regex libraries have supported numerous other [[character set]]s. Many modern regex engines offer at least some support for [[Unicode]]. In most respects it makes no difference what the character set is, but some issues do arise when extending regexes to support Unicode.\n\n* '''Supported encoding'''. Some regex libraries expect to work on some particular encoding instead of on abstract Unicode characters. Many of these require the [[UTF-8]] encoding, while others might expect [[UTF-16]], or [[UTF-32]]. In contrast, Perl and Java are agnostic on encodings, instead operating on decoded characters internally.\n* '''Supported Unicode range'''. Many regex engines support only the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]], that is, the characters which can be encoded with only 16 bits. Currently (as of 2016) only a few regex engines (e.g., Perl's and Java's) can handle the full 21-bit Unicode range.\n* '''Extending ASCII-oriented constructs to Unicode'''. For example, in ASCII-based implementations, character ranges of the form <code>[x-y]</code> are valid wherever ''x'' and ''y'' have [[code point]]s in the range [0x00,0x7F] and codepoint(''x'') \u2264 codepoint(''y''). The natural extension of such character ranges to Unicode would simply change the requirement that the endpoints lie in [0x00,0x7F] to the requirement that they lie in [0x0000,0x10FFFF]. However, in practice this is often not the case. Some implementations, such as that of [[Gawk (GNU package)|gawk]], do not allow character ranges to cross Unicode blocks. A range like [0x61,0x7F] is valid since both endpoints fall within the Basic Latin block, as is [0x0530,0x0560] since both endpoints fall within the Armenian block, but a range like [0x0061,0x0532] is invalid since it includes multiple Unicode blocks. Other engines, such as that of the [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] editor, allow block-crossing but the character values must not be more than 256 apart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/pattern.html#/%5B%5D |title=Vim documentation: pattern |publisher=Vimdoc.sourceforge.net |accessdate=2013-09-25}}</ref>\n* '''Case insensitivity'''. Some case-insensitivity flags affect only the ASCII characters. Other flags affect all characters. Some engines have two different flags, one for ASCII, the other for Unicode. Exactly which characters belong to the POSIX classes also varies.\n* '''Cousins of case insensitivity'''. As ASCII has case distinction, case insensitivity became a logical feature in text searching. Unicode introduced alphabetic scripts without case like [[Devan\u0101gar\u012b|Devanagari]]. For these, [[case sensitivity]] is not applicable. For scripts like Chinese, another distinction seems logical: between traditional and simplified. In Arabic scripts, insensitivity to [[IMFI|initial, medial, final, and isolated position]] may be desired. In Japanese, insensitivity between [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] is sometimes useful.\n* '''Normalization'''. Unicode has [[Unicode#Combining characters|combining characters]]. Like old typewriters, plain letters can be followed by one or more non-spacing symbols (usually diacritics like accent marks) to form a single printing character, but also provides precomposed characters, i.e. characters that already include one or more combining characters. A sequence of a character + combining character should be matched with the identical single precomposed character. The process of standardizing sequences of characters + combining characters is called normalization.\n* '''New control codes'''. Unicode introduced amongst others, [[byte order mark]]s and text direction markers. These codes might have to be dealt with in a special way.\n* '''Introduction of character classes for Unicode blocks, scripts, and numerous other character properties'''. Block properties are much less useful than script properties, because a block can have code points from several different scripts, and a script can have code points from several different blocks.<ref name=\"unicode\">{{cite web\n| title = UTS#18 on Unicode Regular Expressions, Annex A: Character Blocks\n| url = http://unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Character_Blocks\n| accessdate = 2010-02-05}}</ref> In [[Perl]] and the {{Javadoc:SE|package=java.util.regex|java/util/regex}} library, properties of the form <code>\\p{InX}</code> or <code>\\p{Block=X}</code> match characters in block ''X'' and <code>\\P{InX}</code> or <code>\\P{Block=X}</code> matches code points not in that block. Similarly, <code>\\p{Armenian}</code>, <code>\\p{IsArmenian}</code>, or <code>\\p{Script=Armenian}</code> matches any character in the Armenian script. In general, <code>\\p{X}</code> matches any character with either the binary property ''X'' or the general category ''X''. For example, <code>\\p{Lu}</code>, <code>\\p{Uppercase_Letter}</code>, or <code>\\p{GC=Lu}</code> matches any uppercase letter. Binary properties that are ''not'' general categories include <code>\\p{White_Space}</code>, <code>\\p{Alphabetic}</code>, <code>\\p{Math}</code>, and <code>\\p{Dash}</code>. Examples of non-binary properties are <code>\\p{Bidi_Class=Right_to_Left}</code>, <code>\\p{Word_Break=A_Letter}</code>, and <code>\\p{Numeric_Value=10}</code>.\n\n==Uses==\nRegexes are useful in a wide variety of [[text processing]] tasks, and more generally [[string processing]], where the data need not be textual. Common applications include [[data validation]], [[data scraping]] (especially [[web scraping]]), [[data wrangling]], simple [[parsing]], the production of [[syntax highlighting]] systems, and many other tasks.\n\nWhile regexes would be useful on Internet [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]]s, processing them across the entire database could consume excessive computer resources depending on the complexity and design of the regex. Although in many cases system administrators can run regex-based queries internally, most search engines do not offer regex support to the public. Notable exceptions: [[Google Code Search]], [[Exalead]]. Google Code Search has been shut down as of January 2012.<ref>{{cite web |first=Bradley |last=Horowitz |author-link=Bradley Horowitz |url=https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/fall-sweep.html |title=A fall sweep |date=24 October 2011 |access-date=4 May 2019 |work=[[Google Blog]]}}</ref>\nIt used a trigram index to speed queries.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cox |first=Russ |date=January 2012 |url=https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html |title=Regular Expression Matching with a Trigram Index, or How Google Code Search Worked |access-date=4 May 2019 |work=swtch.com}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nThe specific syntax rules vary depending on the specific implementation, [[programming language]], or [[Library (computing)|library]] in use. Additionally, the functionality of regex implementations can vary between [[Software versioning|version]]s.\n\nBecause regexes can be difficult to both explain and understand without examples, interactive websites for testing regexes are a useful resource for learning regexes by experimentation.\nThis section provides a basic description of some of the properties of regexes by way of illustration.\n\nThe following conventions are used in the examples.<ref name=\"clarify000\">The character 'm' is not always required to specify a [[Perl]] match operation. For example, <code>m/[^abc]/</code> could also be rendered as <code>/[^abc]/</code>. The 'm' is only necessary if the user wishes to specify a match operation without using a forward-slash as the regex [[delimiter]]. Sometimes it is useful to specify an alternate regex delimiter in order to avoid \"[[delimiter collision]]\". See '[http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html perldoc perlre]' for more details.</ref>\n\n metacharacter(s) ;; the metacharacters column specifies the regex syntax being demonstrated\n =~ m//           ;; indicates a regex '''match''' operation in Perl\n =~ s///          ;; indicates a regex '''substitution''' operation in Perl\n\nAlso worth noting is that these regexes are all Perl-like syntax. Standard [[#POSIX Basic Regular Expressions|POSIX]] regular expressions are different.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, the following examples conform to the [[Perl]] programming language, release 5.8.8, January 31, 2006. This means that other implementations may lack support for some parts of the syntax shown here (e.g. basic vs. extended regex, <code>\\( \\)</code> vs. <code>()</code>, or lack of <code>\\d</code> instead of [[POSIX]] <code>[:digit:]</code>).\n\nThe syntax and conventions used in these examples coincide with that of other programming environments as well.<ref>E.g., see ''[[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[O'Reilly Media#In a Nutshell|in a Nutshell]]'', p. 213; ''[[Python (programming language)|Python]] Scripting for Computational Science'', p. 320; Programming [[PHP]], p. 106.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This is known as the [[induction of regular languages]], and is part of the general problem of [[grammar induction]] in [[computational learning theory]]. Formally, given examples of strings in a regular language, and perhaps also given examples of strings ''not'' in that regular language, it is possible to induce a grammar for the language, i.e., a regular expression that generates that language. Not all regular languages can be induced in this way (see [[language identification in the limit]]), but many can. For example, the set of examples {1, 10, 100}, and negative set (of counterexamples) {11, 1001, 101, 0} can be used to induce the regular expression 1\u22c50* (1 followed by zero or more 0s).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of regular-expression engines]]\n* [[Extended Backus\u2013Naur form]]\n* [[Matching wildcards]]\n* [[Regular tree grammar]]\n* [[Thompson's construction]] \u2013 converts a regular expression into an equivalent [[nondeterministic finite automaton|nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Aho\n | first = Alfred V.\n | author-link =Alfred Aho\n | year = 1990\n | title = Algorithms for finding patterns in strings\n | editor-last = van Leeuwen\n | editor-first = Jan | editor-link = Jan van Leeuwen\n | work = Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science, volume A: Algorithms and Complexity\n | publisher = The MIT Press\n | pages = 255\u2013300\n | ref = harv\n | postscript = <!--None-->\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last1 = Aho\n | first1 = Alfred V.\n | last2 = Ullman\n | first2 = Jeffrey D.\n | authorlink2 = Jeffrey Ullman\n | year = 1992\n | title = Foundations of Computer Science\n | url = http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/focs.html\n | chapter = Chapter 10.

According to Barakat's account, Khaled Mustafa Qurmo and Khaled Abdel Majid Qurmo, two cousins, were driving him home in Barisha on October 26 when helicopters fired on their white van. All three exited the vehicle, but one fell, his legs filled with [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]]. A follow-up strike targeted the group again, killing the two cousins and blowing off a chunk of Barakat's right arm. The cousins died of shrapnel wounds to the chest, according to autopsy reports by a Syrian doctor with the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations, an international medical group. Several relatives said the cousins operated a van service and had no connection to ISIL or any armed group; Barakat said the van carried no weapons.

Former Pentagon intelligence analyst [[Marc Garlasco]] suggested the shrapnel damage at the scene resembled that caused by [[Hydra 70]] rockets, a type used by U.S. military helicopters. Garlasco also suggested the secondary strikes on the men fleeing the van was consistent with a U.S. military practice of targeting \"squirters\"\u2014people perceived to be hostiles running away from an attack. The U.S. military has not confirmed whether it fired on the white van during the raid.<ref name=nprciv/>\n\n== Analysis ==\nA November 6, 2019 [[Brookings Institution]] analysis framed the raid's success as a reminder of the United States' \"power and resolve\" in the [[War on Terror]], remarking on three particular aspects of the operation: [[List of intelligence gathering disciplines|intelligence collection]], international cooperation, and operational capability. Brookings asserted that it was a combination of U.S. [[hard power]] and [[soft power]] that secured cooperation with Turkey, Russia, Iraq and the Kurds and noted that a synergized combination of [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|HUMINT]], [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]], and [[Imagery intelligence|visual intelligence]] gathering was the key to translating the ISIL informant's information into actionable operational intelligence, such as how the deployment of military dogs indicated U.S. forces were expecting [[Close-quarters combat|close-quarters]] obstacles thanks to intelligence reports. The analysis stated that despite Baghdadi's eight years of experience evading capture or death, the operation succeeded due to the U.S. professionally utilizing the \"Find, Fix, Finish\" intelligence cycle standard: Narrow down Baghdadi's suspected location (the Find), verify his identity and location and translate the intelligence into a feasible action plan (the Fix), and subdue the target (the Finish).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/11/06/what-we-can-learn-about-us-intelligence-from-the-baghdadi-raid/|date=November 6, 2019|title=What we can learn about US intelligence from the Baghdadi raid|work=Brookings Institution|accessdate=27 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127230050/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/11/06/what-we-can-learn-about-us-intelligence-from-the-baghdadi-raid/|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA November 19, 2019 [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|Department of Defense Inspector General]] report, citing [[Defense Intelligence Agency (United States)|Defense Intelligence Agency]] assessments, stated that Baghdadi's death was \"a significant blow to ISIS but would not likely end the ISIS threat\" and that his demise \"would likely have little effect on the ability of ISIS to reconstitute\" itself as a potent transnational threat, according to open-source analysis.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/11/19/isis-expected-to-revamp-operations-in-syria-grow-ability-to-target-the-west-says-pentagon-watchdog/|work=Military Times|date=19 November 2019|title=ISIS expected to revamp operations in Syria, grow ability to target the West, says Pentagon watchdog|accessdate=24 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127234504/https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/11/19/isis-expected-to-revamp-operations-in-syria-grow-ability-to-target-the-west-says-pentagon-watchdog/|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A report from the DIA in 2020 concluded that Baghdadi's death did not have an immediate impact on ISIL's abilities to operate.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2020/02/04/dia-says-isis-took-advantage-of-turkish-invasion-of-northern-syria-baghdadi-death-did-not-degrade-jihadi-group/ |title=DIA says ISIS took advantage of Turkish invasion of northern Syria, Baghdadi death did not degrade jihadi group |first=Shawn |last=Snow |date=February 4, 2020 |newspaper=[[Military Times]] |quote=Moreover, CENTCOM and the DIA both said in the IG report that the October raid that bagged ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has had no immediate impact on the group\u2019s ability to operate.}}</ref>\n\n== Reactions ==\n[[File:SDF statement on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death.ogg|thumb|Statement by SDF spokesman Redur Khalil on Baghdadi's death]]\nRepresentatives of several countries, including Australia,<ref name=videorelease>{{cite news |title=Trump says U.S. may release parts of Baghdadi raid video |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi/russia-guarded-over-baghdadi-killing-world-leaders-say-fight-goes-on-idUSKBN1X71DY |via=www.reuters.com |agency=Reuters |publisher=Reuters |date=October 28, 2019 |access-date=October 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028171220/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi/russia-guarded-over-baghdadi-killing-world-leaders-say-fight-goes-on-idUSKBN1X71DY |archive-date=October 28, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> France,<ref name=worldreact>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-reaction-fact/factbox-world-reacts-to-announcement-of-islamic-state-leader-baghdadis-death-idUSKBN1X60HS?il=0|title=Factbox: World reacts to announcement of Islamic State leader Baghdadi's death|date=October 27, 2019|website=www.reuters.com|access-date=October 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225111908/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-reaction-fact/factbox-world-reacts-to-announcement-of-islamic-state-leader-baghdadis-death-idUSKBN1X60HS?il=0|archive-date=December 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Israel,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-congratulates-trump-for-baghdadi-killing-1.8032102|title=Netanyahu Congratulates Trump for Baghdadi Killing|last=|first=|date=October 27, 2019|via=www.reuters.com|agency=Reuters|access-date=October 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029021640/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-congratulates-trump-for-baghdadi-killing-1.8032102|archive-date=October 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and the United Kingdom,<ref name=\"worldreact\" /> congratulated the United States and said that the death of Baghdadi marked a turning point in the fight against ISIL.

Former Pentagon intelligence analyst [[Marc Garlasco]] suggested the shrapnel damage at the scene resembled that caused by [[Hydra 70]] rockets, a type used by U.S. military helicopters. Garlasco also suggested the secondary strikes on the men fleeing the van was consistent with a U.S. military practice of targeting \"squirters\"\u2014people perceived to be hostiles running away from an attack. The U.S. military has not confirmed whether it fired on the white van during the raid.<ref name=nprciv/>\n\n== Analysis ==\nA November 6, 2019 [[Brookings Institution]] analysis framed the raid's success as a reminder of the United States' \"power and resolve\" in the [[War on Terror]], remarking on three particular aspects of the operation: [[List of intelligence gathering disciplines|intelligence collection]], international cooperation, and operational capability. Brookings asserted that it was a combination of U.S. [[hard power]] and [[soft power]] that secured cooperation with Turkey, Russia, Iraq and the Kurds and noted that a synergized combination of [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|HUMINT]], [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]], and [[Imagery intelligence|visual intelligence]] gathering was the key to translating the ISIL informant's information into actionable operational intelligence, such as how the deployment of military dogs indicated U.S. forces were expecting [[Close-quarters combat|close-quarters]] obstacles thanks to intelligence reports. The analysis stated that despite Baghdadi's eight years of experience evading capture or death, the operation succeeded due to the U.S. professionally utilizing the \"Find, Fix, Finish\" intelligence cycle standard: Narrow down Baghdadi's suspected location (the Find), verify his identity and location and translate the intelligence into a feasible action plan (the Fix), and subdue the target (the Finish).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/11/06/what-we-can-learn-about-us-intelligence-from-the-baghdadi-raid/|date=November 6, 2019|title=What we can learn about US intelligence from the Baghdadi raid|work=Brookings Institution|accessdate=27 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127230050/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/11/06/what-we-can-learn-about-us-intelligence-from-the-baghdadi-raid/|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA November 19, 2019 [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|Department of Defense Inspector General]] report, citing [[Defense Intelligence Agency (United States)|Defense Intelligence Agency]] assessments, stated that Baghdadi's death was \"a significant blow to ISIS but would not likely end the ISIS threat\" and that his demise \"would likely have little effect on the ability of ISIS to reconstitute\" itself as a potent transnational threat, according to open-source analysis.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/11/19/isis-expected-to-revamp-operations-in-syria-grow-ability-to-target-the-west-says-pentagon-watchdog/|work=Military Times|date=19 November 2019|title=ISIS expected to revamp operations in Syria, grow ability to target the West, says Pentagon watchdog|accessdate=24 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127234504/https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/11/19/isis-expected-to-revamp-operations-in-syria-grow-ability-to-target-the-west-says-pentagon-watchdog/|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A report from the DIA in 2020 concluded that Baghdadi's death did not have an immediate impact on ISIL's abilities to operate.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2020/02/04/dia-says-isis-took-advantage-of-turkish-invasion-of-northern-syria-baghdadi-death-did-not-degrade-jihadi-group/ |title=DIA says ISIS took advantage of Turkish invasion of northern Syria, Baghdadi death did not degrade jihadi group |first=Shawn |last=Snow |date=February 4, 2020 |newspaper=[[Military Times]] |quote=Moreover, CENTCOM and the DIA both said in the IG report that the October raid that bagged ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has had no immediate impact on the group\u2019s ability to operate.}}</ref>\n\n== Reactions ==\n[[File:SDF statement on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death.ogg|thumb|Statement by SDF spokesman Redur Khalil on Baghdadi's death]]\nRepresentatives of several countries, including Australia,<ref name=videorelease>{{cite news |title=Trump says U.S. may release parts of Baghdadi raid video |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi/russia-guarded-over-baghdadi-killing-world-leaders-say-fight-goes-on-idUSKBN1X71DY |via=www.reuters.com |agency=Reuters |publisher=Reuters |date=October 28, 2019 |access-date=October 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028171220/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi/russia-guarded-over-baghdadi-killing-world-leaders-say-fight-goes-on-idUSKBN1X71DY |archive-date=October 28, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> France,<ref name=worldreact>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-reaction-fact/factbox-world-reacts-to-announcement-of-islamic-state-leader-baghdadis-death-idUSKBN1X60HS?il=0|title=Factbox: World reacts to announcement of Islamic State leader Baghdadi's death|date=October 27, 2019|website=www.reuters.com|access-date=October 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225111908/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-reaction-fact/factbox-world-reacts-to-announcement-of-islamic-state-leader-baghdadis-death-idUSKBN1X60HS?il=0|archive-date=December 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Israel,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-congratulates-trump-for-baghdadi-killing-1.8032102|title=Netanyahu Congratulates Trump for Baghdadi Killing|last=|first=|date=October 27, 2019|via=www.reuters.com|agency=Reuters|access-date=October 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029021640/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-congratulates-trump-for-baghdadi-killing-1.8032102|archive-date=October 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and the United Kingdom,<ref name=\"worldreact\" /> congratulated the United States and said that the death of Baghdadi marked a turning point in the fight against ISIL.
