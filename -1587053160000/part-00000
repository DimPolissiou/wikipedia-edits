Often using a [[Standard 52-card deck|standard deck]], poker games vary in deck configuration, the number of cards in play, the number [[Poker dealer|dealt]] face up or face down, and the number [[Community card poker|shared by all players]], but all have rules which involve one or more rounds of betting.\n\nIn most modern poker games the first round of betting begins with one or more of the players making some form of a forced bet (the ''[[blind (poker)|blind]]'' or ''ante''). In standard poker, each player bets according to the rank they believe their hand is worth as compared to the other players. The action then proceeds clockwise as each player in turn must either match (or \"call\") the maximum previous bet, or [[betting (poker)#Fold|fold]], losing the amount bet so far and all further involvement in the hand. A player who matches a bet may also \"raise\" (increase) the bet. The betting round ends when all players have either called the last bet or folded. If all but one player folds on any round, the remaining player collects the pot without being required to reveal their hand. If more than one player remains in contention after the final betting round, a [[showdown (poker)|showdown]] takes place where the hands are revealed, and the player with the winning hand takes the pot.\n\nWith the exception of initial forced bets, money is only placed into the pot voluntarily by a player who either believes the bet has positive [[expected value]] or who is trying to [[Bluff (poker)|bluff]] other players for various strategic reasons. Thus, while the outcome of any particular hand significantly involves chance, the long-run expectations of the players are determined by their actions chosen on the basis of [[probability]], [[psychology]], and [[game theory]].\n\nPoker has increased in popularity since the beginning of the 20th century and has gone from being primarily a recreational activity confined to small groups of enthusiasts to a widely popular activity, both for participants and spectators, including online, with many professional players and multimillion-dollar tournament prizes.\n\n==History==\n{{summarize|from|better=y|History of poker|date=April 2018}}\n{{Main|History of poker}}\nPoker was developed sometime during the early 19th century in the United States. Since those early beginnings, the game has grown to become an extremely popular pastime worldwide.\n\nIn the 1937 edition of Foster's Complete [[Edmond Hoyle|Hoyle]], [[R. F. Foster (games)|R. F.

In a [[casino]], a house dealer handles the [[playing card|cards]] for each hand, but the button (typically a white plastic disk) is rotated clockwise among the players to indicate a nominal dealer to determine the order of betting. The cards are dealt clockwise around the [[poker table]], one at a time.\n\nOne or more players are usually required to make [[Betting (poker)#Forced bets|forced bets]], usually either an ''ante'' or a ''blind bet'' (sometimes both). The dealer [[shuffle]]s the cards, the player on the chair to his or her right [[cut (playing cards)|cuts]], and the dealer deals the appropriate number of cards to the players one at a time, beginning with the player to his or her left. Cards may be dealt either face-up or face-down, depending on the variant of poker being played. After the initial deal, the first of what may be several [[betting (poker)|betting]] rounds begins. Between rounds, the players' hands develop in some way, often by being dealt additional cards or replacing cards previously dealt. At the end of each round, all bets are gathered into the central pot.\n\nAt any time during a betting round, if one player bets, no opponents choose to ''call'' (match) the bet, and all opponents instead ''fold'', the hand ends immediately, the bettor is awarded the pot, no cards are required to be shown, and the next hand begins. This is what makes [[bluff (poker)|bluffing]] possible. Bluffing is a primary feature of poker, one that distinguishes it from other vying games and from other games that make use of [[hand rankings|poker hand rankings]].\n\nAt the end of the last betting round, if more than one player remains, there is a [[showdown (poker)|showdown]], in which the players reveal their previously hidden cards and evaluate their hands. The player with the best hand according to the poker variant being played wins the pot. A poker hand comprises five cards; in variants where a player has more than five cards available to them, only the best five-card combination counts.\n\n==Variants==\n{{Main|List of poker variants}}\n[[File:2006 WSOP Main Event Table.jpg|thumb|upright|[[2006 World Series of Poker|2006 WSOP]] Main Event table]]\n\nPoker variations are played where a \"high hand\" or a \"low hand\" may be the best desired hand.  In other words, when playing a poker variant with \"low poker\" the best hand is one that contains the lowest cards (and it can get further complicated by including or not including flushes and straights etc. from \"high hand poker\").  So while the \"majority\" of poker game variations are played \"high hand\", where the best high \"straight, flush etc.\" wins, there are poker variations where the \"worst hand\" wins, such as \"low ball, acey-deucey, high-lo split etc. game variations\".  To summarize, there can be variations that are \"high poker\", \"low poker\", and \"high low split\".  In the case of \"high low split\" the pot is divided among the best high hand and low hand.\n\nPoker has many [[List of poker variants|variations]],<ref>Richard D. Harroch, Lou Krieger.

Two Plus Two Pub, 1999.</ref> and generally using the same hand ranking hierarchy. There are four main families of variants, largely grouped by the protocol of card-dealing and betting:\n\n;Straight: A complete hand is dealt to each player, and players bet in one round, with raising and re-raising allowed. This is the oldest poker family; the root of the game as now played was a game known as [[Primero]], which evolved into the game [[three-card brag]], a very popular gentleman's game around the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]] and still enjoyed in the U.K. today. ''Straight'' hands of five cards are sometimes used as a final showdown, but poker is almost always played in a more complex form to allow for additional strategy.\n;[[Stud poker]]: Cards are dealt in a prearranged combination of face-down and face-up rounds, or ''streets'', with a round of betting following each. This is the next-oldest family; as poker progressed from three to five-card hands, they were often dealt one card at a time, either face-down or face-up, with a betting round between each. The most popular stud variant today, [[seven-card stud]], deals two extra cards to each player (three face-down, four face-up) from which they must make the best possible 5-card hand.\n;[[Draw poker]]: A complete hand is dealt to each player, face-down, and after betting, players are allowed to attempt to change their hand (with the object of improving it) by discarding unwanted cards and being dealt new ones. [[Five-card draw]] is the most famous variation in this family.\n;[[Community card poker]]: Also known as \"flop poker\", community card poker is a variation of stud poker.  Players are dealt an incomplete hand of face-down cards, and then a number of face-up community cards are dealt to the center of the table, each of which can be used by one or more of the players to make a 5-card hand. [[Texas hold 'em]] and [[Omaha hold 'em|Omaha]] are two well-known variants of the community card family.\n\nThere are several methods for defining the structure of betting during a hand of poker. The three most common structures are known as \"fixed-limit\", \"pot-limit\", and \"no-limit\". In fixed-limit poker, betting and raising must be done by standardized amounts. For instance, if the required bet is X, an initial bettor may only bet X; if a player wishes to raise a bet, they may only raise by X. In pot-limit poker, a player may bet or raise any amount up to the size of the pot. When calculating the maximum raise allowed, all previous bets and calls, including the intending raiser's call, are first added to the pot. The raiser may then raise the previous bet by the full amount of the pot. In no-limit poker, a player may wager their entire betting stack at any point that they are allowed to make a bet. In all games, if a player does not have enough betting chips to fully match a bet, they may go \"all-in\", allowing them to show down their hand for the amount of chips they have remaining.\n\nOther games that use poker hand rankings may likewise be referred to as ''poker''. [[Video poker]] is a [[single-player video game]] that functions much like a [[slot machine]]; most video poker machines play draw poker, where the player bets, a hand is dealt, and the player can discard and replace cards. Payout is dependent on the hand resulting after the draw and the player's initial bet.\n\n[[Strip poker]] is a traditional poker variation where players remove clothing when they lose bets. Since it depends only on the basic mechanic of betting in rounds, strip poker can be played with any form of poker; however, it is usually based on simple variants with few betting rounds, like five card draw.\n\nAnother game with the ''poker'' name, but with a vastly different mode of play, is called ''[[Acey Deucey (card game)|Acey-Deucey]]'' or ''[[Red dog poker|Red Dog]]'' poker. This game is more similar to [[Blackjack]] in its layout and betting; each player bets against the house, and then is dealt two cards. For the player to win, the third card dealt (after an opportunity to raise the bet) must have a value in-between the first two. Payout is based on the odds that this is possible, based on the difference in values of the first two cards. Other poker-like games played at casinos against the house include [[three card poker]] and [[pai gow poker]].\n\n==Computer programs==\nA variety of [[computer poker player]]s have been developed by researchers at the [[University of Alberta]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], and the [[University of Auckland]] amongst others.\n\nIn a January 2015 article<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1259433 |pmid=25574016 |title=Heads-up limit hold'em poker is solved |journal=Science |volume=347 |issue=6218 |pages=145\u2013149  |year=2015 |last1=Bowling |first1=M. |last2=Burch |first2=N. |last3=Johanson |first3=M. |last4=Tammelin |first4=O.|url=http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/%7Ebowling/papers/15science.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.697.72 }}</ref> published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', a group of researchers mostly from the [[University of Alberta]] announced that they \"essentially weakly solved\" [[Heads up poker|heads-up]] limit ''Texas Hold 'em'' with their development of their [[Cepheus (poker bot)|Cepheus poker bot]].

In 1943, Japan required Hong Kong to use [[Japanese military yen]] as a medium of exchange. In 1945, the Japanese surrendered during the Second World War, and their [[Japanese military yen|military yen]] became a useless paper. Most people went to a pawnbroker to obtain some Hong Kong Dollars for their daily life. To circulate funds and jump-start the economy, the Hong Kong Government urged the pawn industry to revive itself. With government support, the Hong Kong & Kowloon Pawnbrokers' Association Limited was established in 1947. There were only 11 members at the time. Between 1950 and 1960, the number of members increased to more than 90, reaching 138 in 1994. Today the Association has more than 161 members; combined with non-member pawn shops, there are approximately 250 pawn shops in Hong Kong. Pawn shops are mainly located on [[Hong Kong Island]], particularly [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and [[Kowloon]]. Because many jewelry and goldsmiths shops are located in Central, mortgage and loan facilities are more available here than elsewhere.<ref>\u65bc\u5f65\u5317. \u9999\u6e2f\u7576\u92ea\u4f55\u4ee5\u7d93\u4e45\u4e0d\u8870\uff1a\"\u62bc\"\u5b57\u62db\u724c\u540e\u6709\u4e7e\u5764 {{cite web |url=http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116213249/http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Extracted on 3/4 November 2013</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/checkconfig/checkClientConfig.jsp?applicationId=RA001|title=Hong Kong e-Legislation|website=www.elegislation.gov.hk|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\nIn order to prevent the sale of stolen property in pawn shops, Hong Kong law stipulates that pawnshops must check the IDs of prospective clients looking for pawn items which are under strict verification and registration.

The screen is tall enough to block passersby from seeing inside. Clients can be concealed by the board to avoid recognition.\n\n==== Pawning counter ====\nThe counter of the pawnshop, which is behind the tall board, is typically higher than the average person. There are window frames in the counter. Clients need to hand over their mortgaged properties at the pawning counter. This design is meant to emphasize the superior status of the pawnbroker in the transaction. Prices seem to be lower due to the psychological effect caused by this design{{Citation needed|reason=Need a source for psychological effect|date=January 2018}}.

In 1943, Japan required Hong Kong to use [[Japanese military yen]] to exchange inter-medium. In 1945, the Japanese announced surrender in the Second World War, and the [[Japanese military yen]] became useless paper. Most people went to a pawnbroker to obtain some Hong Kong Dollars for their daily life. To circulate funds and jump-start the economy, the Hong Kong Government urged the pawn industry to revive itself. With government support, The Hong Kong & Kowloon Pawnbrokers' Association Limited was set up in 1947. There were only 11 members at the time. Between 1950 and 1960, the number of members increased to more than 90, reaching 138 in 1994. Today the Association has more than 161 members and combined with non-member pawn shops, there are approximately 250 pawn shops in Hong Kong. Pawn shops are mainly located on [[Hong Kong Island]], particularly [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and [[Kowloon]]. Because many jewelers and goldsmiths' shops are located in Central, the mortgage and loan amount is usually higher.<ref>\u65bc\u5f65\u5317. \u9999\u6e2f\u7576\u92ea\u4f55\u4ee5\u7d93\u4e45\u4e0d\u8870\uff1a\"\u62bc\"\u5b57\u62db\u724c\u540e\u6709\u4e7e\u5764 {{cite web |url=http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116213249/http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Extracted on 3/4 November 2013</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=for entire paragraph|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn order to prevent the sale of stolen property in pawn shops, Hong Kong law stipulates that pawnshops must check the IDs of prospective clients looking to pawn items, which are under strict verification and registration.

It is sometimes served for breakfast and is best eaten hot.\n\nThere is also a dish called \"[[Beggar's Chicken]]\" ({{zh|t=\u53eb\u5316\u96de|p=ji\u00e0ohu\u0101 j\u012b|labels=no}}), which is a whole chicken marinated with spices and wrapped in aluminum foil. Contrary to its name, it is not the food for the homeless. Traditionally, beggar's chicken is wrapped in leaves or sometimes even in mud, thus allowing the full flavor of the chicken to be preserved.\n\nBecause [[Yangzhou]] is close to [[Nanjing]], people will be able to enjoy the mix of northern and southern cuisines. When in Nanjing, one unusual local dish is [[duck blood and vermicelli soup]], consisting of congealed duck's blood in noodle soup, another is its [[stinky tofu]].\n\n==Use in official dining==\nHuaiyang cuisine has been employed in official occasions by the Chinese government. Some examples include:\n\n* In 1949, for the first state banquet of the People's Republic of China.\n* In 1999, for China's 50th anniversary state banquet.\n* In 2002, for visiting U.S. President [[George W.
