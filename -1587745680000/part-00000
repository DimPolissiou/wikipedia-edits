These notes are designed to circulate on the islands and be deemed invalid in the event of a Japanese invasion.\n* 1948: The [[White House]] picture was updated to reflect renovations to the building itself, including the addition of the Truman Balcony, as well as the passage of time. Most notably, the trees are larger. The change occurred during production of Series 1934C.\n* 1950: Design elements like the serial numbers are reduced in size and moved around subtly, presumably for aesthetic reasons.\n* 1963: \"Will Pay To The Bearer On Demand\" is removed from the front of the bill below the portrait, and the legal tender designation is shortened to \"This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private\" (eliminating \"and is redeemable in lawful money at the United States Treasury, or at any Federal Reserve Bank.\") Also, \"In God We Trust\" is added above the White House on the reverse. These two acts (one taking U.S. currency off the silver backing, and the other authorizing the national motto) are coincidental, even if their combined result is implemented in one redesign. Also, several design elements are rearranged, less perceptibly than the change in 1950, mostly to make room for the slightly rearranged obligations.\n* 1969: The new treasury seal appears on all denominations, including the $20.\n* 1977: A new type of serial-number press results in a slightly different font. The old presses are gradually retired, and old-style serial numbers appear as late as 1981 for this denomination.\n* 1992: Anti-counterfeiting features are added: [[microprinting]] around the portrait, and a plastic strip embedded in the paper. Even though the bills read Series 1990, the first bills were printed in April 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f1990_v.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Series 1990 $20|publisher=}}</ref>\n* 1994: The first notes at the Western Currency Facility are printed in January late during production of Series 1990.\n* September 24, 1998: The Series 1996 $20 note was completely redesigned for the first time since 1929 to further deter counterfeiting; the picture of the White House was changed to the north side view.

The banknote is redeemable in gold or silver (at the bearer's discretion) at any [[Federal Reserve Bank]].\n* 1933: With the U.S. having abandoned the [[gold standard]], the bill is no longer redeemable in gold, but rather in \"lawful money\", meaning [[silver]].\n* 1942: [[HAWAII Overprint Note|A special emergency series]], with brown serial numbers and \"HAWAII\" overprinted on both the front and the back, is issued. These notes are designed to circulate on the islands and be deemed invalid in the event of a Japanese invasion.\n* 1948: The [[White House]] picture was updated to reflect renovations to the building itself, including the addition of the Truman Balcony, as well as the passage of time. Most notably, the trees are larger. The change occurred during production of Series 1934C.\n* 1950: Design elements like the serial numbers are reduced in size and moved around subtly, presumably for aesthetic reasons.\n* 1963: \"Will Pay To The Bearer On Demand\" is removed from the front of the bill below the portrait, and the legal tender designation is shortened to \"This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private\" (eliminating \"and is redeemable in lawful money at the United States Treasury, or at any Federal Reserve Bank.\") Also, \"In God We Trust\" is added above the White House on the reverse. These two acts (one taking U.S. currency off the silver backing, and the other authorizing the national motto) are coincidental, even if their combined result is implemented in one redesign. Also, several design elements are rearranged, less perceptibly than the change in 1950, mostly to make room for the slightly rearranged obligations.\n* 1969: The new treasury seal appears on all denominations, including the $20.\n* 1977: A new type of serial-number press results in a slightly different font. The old presses are gradually retired, and old-style serial numbers appear as late as 1981 for this denomination.\n* 1992: Anti-counterfeiting features are added: [[microprinting]] around the portrait, and a plastic strip embedded in the paper. Even though the bills read Series 1990, the first bills were printed in April 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f1990_v.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Series 1990 $20|publisher=}}</ref>\n* 1994: The first notes at the Western Currency Facility are printed in January late during production of Series 1990.\n* September 24, 1998: The Series 1996 $20 note was completely redesigned for the first time since 1929 to further deter counterfeiting; the picture of the White House was changed to the north side view.

Liv chants a resurrection spell after her brother has his neck snapped by Caroline, and meanwhile, Matt and Jeremy cause a gas leak under the Mystic Grill. Bonnie and Enzo search for a dead traveler who resides on the other side, who turns out to be Silas. In order to bring back Stefan and Enzo, Bonnie agrees to help Silas to also return. Just as the plan comes together, oblivion starts claiming more souls, and Bonnie refuses to help Silas not be sucked away, meanwhile Damon and Elena drive into the Mystic Grill, causing an explosion, killing every traveler gathered there. Bonnie waits in the woods for her Grams, who arrives and informs her that she will not pass through her as she has found peace by ensuring that Bonnie will find hers. Later, after Luke, Enzo, Tyler, Stefan and Elena have passed back through to the living, Luke tries to convince Liv to stop casting the spell. Tyler realizes that he is no longer a hybrid nor a triggered werewolf as he no longer heals. Lexi realizes that each passing weakens Bonnie further, reducing her chances of surviving to take Damon back to the living world and so after stopping Markos from travelling back through Bonnie, she disappears and finds peace. Alaric and Damon arrive and Bonnie pulls Alaric back through while Luke begins to perform a spell that counters Liv's spell, thus when Bonnie tries to help Damon though, she is unable to return him to the realm of the living. Bonnie reveals to Jeremy that there was never a way to save her and Damon says goodbye to Elena despite her not being able to hear him. Bonnie and Damon then stand looking into a bright white light holding hands.<!--It is not known whether or not they were sucked into Oblivion like Kat, Vicki, Silas and Markos.-->\n|LineColor=650C22\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n=== DVR viewers ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n!

Elena, Damon, and Stefan's daylight rings start to fail as does Liv and Luke's magic against them, giving them the opportunity to escape, and they take refuge to stay alive with the help of Matt. Everyone regroups to discuss ways to out run the spell in order to stay alive. Stefan and Caroline are left with Julian who is still occupying Tyler's body. Stefan breaks the news that Maria is dead and Julian, who is angry and determined to make someone pay, lashes out and rips Stefan's heart out killing him.\n|LineColor=650C22\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Vampire Diaries (season 5)\n|EpisodeNumber=111\n|EpisodeNumber2=22\n|Title= [[Home (The Vampire Diaries)|Home]]\n|DirectedBy= Chris Grismer\n|WrittenBy= Caroline Dries & Brian Young\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|5|15}}\n|ProdCode= 2J7522\n|Viewers= 1.61<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/05/16/thursday-final-ratings-the-big-bang-theory-reign-the-millers-adjusted-down/265025/|title=Thursday Final Ratings: 'The Big Bang Theory' & 'Grey's Anatomy' Adjusted Up; 'Reign' & 'The Millers' Adjusted Down|last=Bibel|first=Sara|work=TV by the Numbers|date=May 16, 2014|accessdate=May 16, 2014}}</ref>\n|ShortSummary=After the only traveler who would be willing to help them is sucked into oblivion, and with her the only chance of bringing Stefan back, Damon, Elena, Enzo, Bonnie and Caroline form a new plan for bringing back Stefan. Liv chants a resurrection spell after her brother has his neck snapped by Caroline, and meanwhile, Matt and Jeremy cause a gas leak under the Mystic Grill. Bonnie and Enzo search for a dead traveler who resides on the other side, who turns out to be Silas. In order to bring back Stefan and Enzo, Bonnie agrees to help Silas to also return. Just as the plan comes together, oblivion starts claiming more souls, and Bonnie refuses to help Silas not be sucked away, meanwhile Damon and Elena drive into the Mystic Grill, causing an explosion, killing every traveler gathered there. Bonnie waits in the woods for her Grams, who arrives and informs her that she will not pass through her as she has found peace by ensuring that Bonnie will find hers. Later, after Luke, Enzo, Tyler, Stefan and Elena have passed back through to the living, Luke tries to convince Liv to stop casting the spell. Tyler realizes that he is no longer a hybrid nor a triggered werewolf as he no longer heals. Lexi realizes that each passing weakens Bonnie further, reducing her chances of surviving to take Damon back to the living world and so after stopping Markos from travelling back through Bonnie, she disappears and finds peace. Alaric and Damon arrive and Bonnie pulls Alaric back through while Luke begins to perform a spell that counters Liv's spell, thus when Bonnie tries to help Damon though, she is unable to return him to the realm of the living. Bonnie reveals to Jeremy that there was never a way to save her and Damon says goodbye to Elena despite her not being able to hear him. Bonnie and Damon then stand looking into a bright white light holding hands.<!--It is not known whether or not they were sucked into Oblivion like Kat, Vicki, Silas and Markos.-->\n|LineColor=650C22\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n=== DVR viewers ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n!

While the Client is indifferent to the target's well-being, his colleague [[List of The Mandalorian characters#Dr. Pershing|Dr. Pershing]] insists the target be brought back alive. The Mandalorian is given a down payment of a single bar of [[Beskar steel]], sacred to his people. He takes it to a covert Mandalorian enclave where an [[The Armorer (Star Wars)|armorer]] uses it to make him a [[pauldron]]. Arriving at the planet of the target's last reported location, the Mandalorian is aided by a vapor farmer named [[Kuiil]]. Tired of the chaos that bounty hunters bring to the area, Kuiil leads him to the target's location and departs. Entering the remote and heavily defended encampment, the Mandalorian reluctantly teams up with bounty hunting droid [[IG-11]] to clear the camp and find the quarry: a [[The Child (Star Wars)|child]] of [[Yoda's species]].

The following day, Kuiil helps him locate the Jawas and negotiate for the return of his ship's components. The Mandalorian agrees to retrieve the egg of a rhinoceros-like Mudhorn in exchange for the stolen parts. He enters the Mudhorn's cave only to be hurled out by the angry beast inside, which attacks him repeatedly, damaging his armor. As the Mudhorn rushes in for the kill, the Child uses [[the Force]] to levitate the beast, allowing the surprised Mandalorian to stab and kill it. He collects the egg and takes it to the Jawas, who crack it open and eat its yellow insides.

Returning to the Mandalorian enclave, the Mandalorian has his damaged armor replaced and weapons upgraded by the Armorer, who forges a full [[cuirass]] from most of the Beskar steel, while the remainder goes to support Mandalorian foundling children. The Mandalorian accepts a new job from Greef Karga and prepares his ship to depart. Feeling guilty for abandoning the Child to the Empire, he turns back to attack the Client's base, killing most of the stormtroopers guarding it. He rescues the Child from Dr. Pershing's laboratory where it was being experimented on, but chooses not to kill the doctor. On the way back to his ship, the Mandalorian is ambushed by other bounty hunters and Greef Karga, who demand that he hand over the Child. He refuses, and a firefight breaks out.

They provoke the raiders at night, with Dune luring the AT-ST into a trap for the Mandalorian to blow up and forcing the remaining raiders to flee.

The Mandalorian sends the others through a sewer grate with the Child to find help from the Mandalorian enclave, while IG-11 removes his helmet to tend to a head injury. Joining the others, the Mandalorian finds the covert group of Mandalorians dead or escaped, except for the Armorer. She tasks him to care for the foundling Child like his own, discover its origins, and return it to its kind. The Armorer fashions the Mandalorian his own signet and gives him a jetpack. The group is ferried down an underground lava river, but when they are ambushed by stormtroopers, IG-11 self-destructs to eliminate the enemy. Gideon attacks in a [[TIE fighter]] and the Mandalorian uses the jetpack to bring the craft down, but the Moff survives and cuts himself out of the ship with the [[Darksaber (fictional weapon)|Darksaber]].<!-- The inclusion of the Darksaber in this plot summary, and the accompanying efn citation, were the result of a a consensus and compromise reached after an extensive talk page discussion.

While the Client is indifferent to the target's well-being, his colleague [[List of The Mandalorian characters#Dr. Pershing|Dr. Pershing]] insists the target be brought back alive. The Mandalorian is given a down payment of a single bar of [[Beskar steel]], sacred to his people. He takes it to a covert Mandalorian enclave where an [[The Armorer (Star Wars)|armorer]] uses it to make him a [[pauldron]]. Arriving at the planet of the target's last reported location, the Mandalorian is aided by a vapor farmer named [[Kuiil]]. Tired of the chaos that bounty hunters bring to the area, Kuiil leads him to the target's location and departs. Entering the remote and heavily defended encampment, the Mandalorian reluctantly teams up with bounty hunting droid [[IG-11]] to clear the camp and find the quarry: a [[The Child (Star Wars)|child]] of [[Yoda's species]].

The following day, Kuiil helps him locate the Jawas and negotiate for the return of his ship's components. The Mandalorian agrees to retrieve the egg of a rhinoceros-like Mudhorn in exchange for the stolen parts. He enters the Mudhorn's cave only to be hurled out by the angry beast inside, which attacks him repeatedly, damaging his armor. As the Mudhorn rushes in for the kill, the Child uses [[the Force]] to levitate the beast, allowing the surprised Mandalorian to stab and kill it. He collects the egg and takes it to the Jawas, who crack it open and eat its yellow insides.

Returning to the Mandalorian enclave, the Mandalorian has his damaged armor replaced and weapons upgraded by the Armorer, who forges a full [[cuirass]] from most of the Beskar steel, while the remainder goes to support Mandalorian foundling children. The Mandalorian accepts a new job from Greef Karga and prepares his ship to depart. Feeling guilty for abandoning the Child to the Empire, he turns back to attack the Client's base, killing most of the stormtroopers guarding it. He rescues the Child from Dr. Pershing's laboratory where it was being experimented on, but chooses not to kill the doctor. On the way back to his ship, the Mandalorian is ambushed by other bounty hunters and Greef Karga, who demand that he hand over the Child. He refuses, and a firefight breaks out.

They provoke the raiders at night, with Dune luring the AT-ST into a trap for the Mandalorian to blow up and forcing the remaining raiders to flee.

The Mandalorian sends the others through a sewer grate with the Child to find help from the Mandalorian enclave, while IG-11 removes his helmet to tend to a head injury. Joining the others, the Mandalorian finds the covert group of Mandalorians dead or escaped, except for the Armorer. She tasks him to care for the foundling Child like his own, discover its origins, and return it to its kind. The Armorer fashions the Mandalorian his own signet and gives him a jetpack. The group is ferried down an underground lava river, but when they are ambushed by stormtroopers, IG-11 self-destructs to eliminate the enemy. Gideon attacks in a [[TIE fighter]] and the Mandalorian uses the jetpack to bring the craft down, but the Moff survives and cuts himself out of the ship with the [[Darksaber (fictional weapon)|Darksaber]].<!-- The inclusion of the Darksaber in this plot summary, and the accompanying efn citation, were the result of a a consensus and compromise reached after an extensive talk page discussion.

Some of the design aspects of this note, such as the bottom border and numeral 10 overprinted with the word {{sc|TEN}}, were transferred over to the series of 1928 $10 bill.\n\n== Small size note history ==\n[[File:US-$10-GC-1928-Fr-2400.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Series 1928 $10 Gold Certificate]]\n[[File:US $10 1934 Note Front.jpg|thumb|left|250px|1934 A Federal Reserve $10 Note]]\n<!--[[File:US $10 1934 Note Back.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The back side of a Series 1934 Note.

All variations of the $10 bill would carry the same portrait of Alexander Hamilton, same border design on the [[obverse]], and the same [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] with a vignette of the U.S. Treasury building. The $10 bill was issued as a [[Federal Reserve Note]] with a green seal and serial numbers and as a [[gold certificate]] with a golden seal and serial numbers.  The car parked outside of the Treasury Department building is based on a number of different cars manufactured at the time and was the creation of the Bureau designer who developed the artwork that served as a model for the engraving, because government agencies were prohibited from endorsing any specific manufacturer or product, according to a bureau of engraving and printing pamphlet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneyfactory.gov/images/Currency_notes_508.pdf|title=Currency NOTES\n|work=Bureau of engraving and Printing}}</ref> The tiny building to the right rear of the treasury building is the [[American Security and Trust Company Building]], which for some years advertised itself as \"right on the money\".<ref>{{Cite book\n| title      = Fodor's Washington DC\n| publisher  = Random House\n| year       = 1991\n| location   =\n| page      = 76\n| quote      = American Security Bank likes to boast in its commercials that it's \"Right on the money\"\u2014\"the money\" in this case being a $10 bill.

This was the only small-sized $10 bill that had a different border design on the obverse. The serial numbers and seal on it were brown.\n* 1933: The first small sized $10 [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]] were issued with a blue seal and serial numbers. The obverse had a similar design style to the 1928 $1 Silver Certificates; however, phrasing on the $10 bill was different from the $1 bill. This issue, with the series date of 1933, was not widely released into general circulation. Surviving examples of these notes usually sell for $10,000 to $30,000 in the numismatic community depending on the condition of the paper.\n* 1934: The redeemable in gold clause was removed from Federal Reserve Notes due to the U.S. withdrawing from the [[gold standard]].\n* 1934: The $10 Silver Certificate was redesigned with a blue numeral 10 on the left side of the obverse and the treasury seal printed over the gray word {{sc|TEN}} on the right. Phrasing on the certificate was changed to reflect the [[Silver Purchase Act of 1934]].\n* 1942: Special World War II [[Hawaii overprint note|currency was issued.]] {{sc|HAWAII}} was overprinted on the front and back of the $10 Federal Reserve Note, and the seal and serial numbers were changed to brown.  This was done so that the currency could be declared worthless in case of Japanese invasion. A $10 Silver Certificate was printed with a yellow instead of blue treasury seal; these notes were given to U.S. troops in North Africa. These notes, too, could be declared worthless if seized by the enemy.\n* 1950: Many minor aspects on the obverse of the $10 Federal Reserve Note were changed. Most noticeably, the treasury seal, gray word {{sc|TEN}}, and the Federal Reserve Seal were made smaller, the words {{sc|WASHINGTON, D.C.}} were added between them and the serial number; also, the Federal Reserve seal had spikes added around it, like the Treasury seal.\n* 1953: The $10 silver certificate had several design changes analogous to the 1950 Federal Reserve Note design changes; also, the blue numeral 10 on the left side of the bill was changed to gray.\n* 1963: {{sc|WILL PAY TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND}} was removed from the obverse and [[United States national motto|{{small|IN GOD WE TRUST]]}} was added to the reverse of the $10 Federal Reserve Notes. Also, the obligation was shortened to its current wording, {{sc|THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE}}. Also during this time, production of Silver Certificates ends.\n* 1969: The $10 bill began using the new treasury seal with wording in [[English language|English]] that simply says, \"The Department of the Treasury,\" instead of [[Latin]] \"THESAUR. AMER. SEPTENT. SIGIL.,\" \"Seal of the Treasury of North America.\"\n* 1981: During production of Series 1977A, a few [[Replacement banknote|star notes]] from [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond|the Richmond FRB]] were made on experimental Natick paper, in the only experimental note series not involving the $1 bill.\n* 1992: The first modern anti-counterfeiting measures were introduced with microscopic printing around Hamilton's portrait and a plastic security strip on the left side of the bill. Even though the notes read Series 1990, the first bills were printed in July 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f1990_d.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Series 1990 $10}}</ref>\n* 1995: The first notes (for Series 1995) at the Western Currency Facility begin printing in November.\n* May 24, 2000: To combat evolving [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiting]], a new $10 bill, the first complete redesign since 1929, was issued under series 1999 whose design was similar in style to the $100, $50, $20, and $5 bills that had all undergone previous design changes. The major changes were a revised portrait of Hamilton and a revised vignette of the U.S. Treasury building, now facing front. The plastic security strip reads \"USA TEN\" and now glows orange under a  [[black light]]. Like the new $5, the bills were first printed in December 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f1999_d.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Series 1999 $10}}</ref>\n* March 2, 2006: In addition to design changes introduced in 2000, the obverse features red background images of the [[Statue of Liberty]]'s torch, the phrase {{sc|WE THE PEOPLE}} from the [[United States Constitution]], a smaller metallic representation of the Statue of Liberty's torch, orange and yellow background color, a borderless portrait of Hamilton, and to the left of Hamilton small yellow 10s whose zeros form the [[EURion constellation]]. The reverse features small yellow [[EURion]] 10s and have the fine lines removed from around the vignette of the United States Treasury building. These notes were issued in series 2004A with [[Anna Escobedo Cabral|Cabral]]-[[John W. Snow|Snow]] signatures. The first notes were printed in July 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f2004ad.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Series 2004A $10}}</ref>\n\n===Series dates===\n\n====Small size====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Many believed that Hamilton, as the first Secretary of the Treasury, should remain on U.S. Currency in some form, all the while thinking that U.S. Currency was long overdue to feature a female historical figure \u2013 names that had been raised included [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Harriet Tubman]], and [[Susan B. Anthony]]. This led to the Treasury Department stating that Hamilton would remain on the bill in some way. The $10 bill was chosen because it was scheduled for a regular security redesign, a years-long process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/17/investing/woman-10-bill-redesign-update/ |work=CNN|title=Woman 10 bill redesign update|date=2016}}</ref> The redesigned ten-dollar bill will be the first U.S. note to incorporate tactile features to assist those with visual disabilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bep.gov/images/Meaningful_Access_White_Paper_06-25-13.pdf|work=B of Engraving and Printing|title=Meaningful Access White Paper|date=2013}}</ref>\n\nOn April 20, 2016, it was announced that Alexander Hamilton would remain the primary face on the $10 bill, due in part to the sudden popularity of the first Treasury Secretary after the success of the Broadway musical [[Hamilton (musical)|''Hamilton'']].

This note is nicknamed a \"jackass note\" because the eagle on the front looks like a donkey when the note is turned upside down.\n* '''1870:''' [[National Gold Bank Note]]s, featuring a [[Vignette (graphic design)|vignette]] of [[Benjamin Franklin]] flying a kite on the left and liberty and an eagle on the right, were issued specifically for payment in gold coin by participating national banks. The back of the bill featured a vignette of U.S. gold coins.\n\n[[File:US-$10-SC-1880-Fr-287.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Series 1880 $10 [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificate]].]]\n\n* '''1875:''' The 1869 United States Note was revised. The blue and green tinting that was present on the obverse was removed and the design on the reverse was completely changed.\n* '''1878:''' The first $10 [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificate]] was issued with a portrait of [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] on the left side of the obverse. The reverse, unlike any other federally issued note, was printed in '''black''' ink and featured the word {{sc|SILVER}} in large block letters.\n* '''1879:''' [[Refunding Certificate]]s were issued that paid 4% interest annually.\n* 1886: A new $10 silver certificate with a portrait of [[Thomas A. Hendricks]] was issued.\n* 1890: Ten-dollar Treasury or \"Coin Notes\" were issued and given for government purchases of silver bullion from the silver mining industry. The note featured a portrait of General [[Philip Sheridan]].  The reverse featured an ornate design that took up almost the entire note.\n* 1891: The reverse of the 1890 Treasury Note was redesigned because the treasury felt that it was too \"busy\" which would make it too easy to [[counterfeit]].\n\n[[File:US-$10-LT-1901-Fr.114.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Series 1901 $10 Legal Tender depicting military explorers [[Meriwether Lewis]], [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]], and an [[American bison]].]]\n\n* 1901: The famous United States Note featuring portraits of [[Meriwether Lewis]] on the left, [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] on the right, and an [[American bison]] which is sometimes erroneously noted as being Black Diamond, the Bison which was depicted on the reverse of the Indian Head Nickel.  This United States Note was the only one to mention the legal provision that authorized its issuance. The reverse featured an allegorical figure representing [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] between two [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman]]-styled pillars.\n* 1907: Congress officially ended the interest paid on Refunding Certificates, forever making their face value $21.30.\n* 1907: The first $10 [[gold certificate]] with a portrait of [[Michael Hillegas]] on the front and orange-colored back was issued.\n* 1914: The first $10 [[Federal Reserve Note]] was issued with a portrait of [[Andrew Jackson]] on the obverse and vignettes of farming and industry on the reverse. The note initially had a red [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|treasury seal]] and serial numbers; however, they were changed to blue.\n\n[[File:US-$10-FRN-1914-Fr-919a.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1914 $10 Federal Reserve Note]]\n\n* '''1915:''' [[Federal Reserve Bank Note]]s (not to be confused with Federal Reserve Notes) were issued by 4 individual Federal Reserve banks. The obverse was similar to the 1914 Federal Reserve notes except for large wording in the middle of the bill and a portrait with no border on the left side of the bill. Each note was an obligation of the issuing bank and could only be redeemed at the corresponding bank.\n* '''1918:''' The 1915 Federal Reserve Bank Note was re-issued under series of 1918 by 4 Federal Reserve banks.\n* '''1923:''' The $10 United States Note was redesigned with a portrait of Andrew Jackson. Some of the design aspects of this note, such as the bottom border and numeral 10 overprinted with the word {{sc|TEN}}, were transferred over to the series of 1928 $10 bill.\n\n== Small size note history ==\n[[File:US-$10-GC-1928-Fr-2400.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Series 1928 $10 Gold Certificate]]\n[[File:US $10 1934 Note Front.jpg|thumb|left|250px|1934 A Federal Reserve $10 Note]]\n<!--[[File:US $10 1934 Note Back.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The back side of a Series 1934 Note.

All variations of the $10 bill would carry the same portrait of Alexander Hamilton, same border design on the [[obverse]], and the same [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] with a vignette of the U.S. Treasury building. The $10 bill was issued as a [[Federal Reserve Note]] with a green seal and serial numbers and as a [[gold certificate]] with a golden seal and serial numbers.  The car parked outside of the Treasury Department building is based on a number of different cars manufactured at the time and was the creation of the Bureau designer who developed the artwork that served as a model for the engraving, because government agencies were prohibited from endorsing any specific manufacturer or product, according to a bureau of engraving and printing pamphlet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneyfactory.gov/images/Currency_notes_508.pdf|title=Currency NOTES\n|work=Bureau of engraving and Printing}}</ref> The tiny building to the right rear of the treasury building is the [[American Security and Trust Company Building]], which for some years advertised itself as \"right on the money\".<ref>{{Cite book\n| title      = Fodor's Washington DC\n| publisher  = Random House\n| year       = 1991\n| location   =\n| page      = 76\n| quote      = American Security Bank likes to boast in its commercials that it's \"Right on the money\"\u2014\"the money\" in this case being a $10 bill.

This was the only small-sized $10 bill that had a different border design on the obverse. The serial numbers and seal on it were brown.\n* 1933: The first small sized $10 [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]] were issued with a blue seal and serial numbers. The obverse had a similar design style to the 1928 $1 Silver Certificates; however, phrasing on the $10 bill was different from the $1 bill. This issue, with the series date of 1933, was not widely released into general circulation. Surviving examples of these notes usually sell for $10,000 to $30,000 in the numismatic community depending on the condition of the paper.\n* 1934: The redeemable in gold clause was removed from Federal Reserve Notes due to the U.S. withdrawing from the [[gold standard]].\n* 1934: The $10 Silver Certificate was redesigned with a blue numeral 10 on the left side of the obverse and the treasury seal printed over the gray word {{sc|TEN}} on the right. Phrasing on the certificate was changed to reflect the [[Silver Purchase Act of 1934]].\n* 1942: Special World War II [[Hawaii overprint note|currency was issued.]] {{sc|HAWAII}} was overprinted on the front and back of the $10 Federal Reserve Note, and the seal and serial numbers were changed to brown.  This was done so that the currency could be declared worthless in case of Japanese invasion. A $10 Silver Certificate was printed with a yellow instead of blue treasury seal; these notes were given to U.S. troops in North Africa. These notes, too, could be declared worthless if seized by the enemy.\n* 1950: Many minor aspects on the obverse of the $10 Federal Reserve Note were changed. Most noticeably, the treasury seal, gray word {{sc|TEN}}, and the Federal Reserve Seal were made smaller, the words {{sc|WASHINGTON, D.C.}} were added between them and the serial number; also, the Federal Reserve seal had spikes added around it, like the Treasury seal.\n* 1953: The $10 silver certificate had several design changes analogous to the 1950 Federal Reserve Note design changes; also, the blue numeral 10 on the left side of the bill was changed to gray.\n* 1963: {{sc|WILL PAY TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND}} was removed from the obverse and [[United States national motto|{{small|IN GOD WE TRUST]]}} was added to the reverse of the $10 Federal Reserve Notes. Also, the obligation was shortened to its current wording, {{sc|THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE}}. Also during this time, production of Silver Certificates ends.\n* 1969: The $10 bill began using the new treasury seal with wording in [[English language|English]] that simply says, \"The Department of the Treasury,\" instead of [[Latin]] \"THESAUR. AMER. SEPTENT. SIGIL.,\" \"Seal of the Treasury of North America.\"\n* 1981: During production of Series 1977A, a few [[Replacement banknote|star notes]] from [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond|the Richmond FRB]] were made on experimental Natick paper, in the only experimental note series not involving the $1 bill.\n* 1992: The first modern anti-counterfeiting measures were introduced with microscopic printing around Hamilton's portrait and a plastic security strip on the left side of the bill. Even though the notes read Series 1990, the first bills were printed in July 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f1990_d.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Series 1990 $10}}</ref>\n* 1995: The first notes (for Series 1995) at the Western Currency Facility begin printing in November.\n* May 24, 2000: To combat evolving [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiting]], a new $10 bill, the first complete redesign since 1929, was issued under series 1999 whose design was similar in style to the $100, $50, $20, and $5 bills that had all undergone previous design changes. The major changes were a revised portrait of Hamilton and a revised vignette of the U.S. Treasury building, now facing front. The plastic security strip reads \"USA TEN\" and now glows orange under a  [[black light]]. Like the new $5, the bills were first printed in December 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f1999_d.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Series 1999 $10}}</ref>\n* March 2, 2006: In addition to design changes introduced in 2000, the obverse features red background images of the [[Statue of Liberty]]'s torch, the phrase {{sc|WE THE PEOPLE}} from the [[United States Constitution]], a smaller metallic representation of the Statue of Liberty's torch, orange and yellow background color, a borderless portrait of Hamilton, and to the left of Hamilton small yellow 10s whose zeros form the [[EURion constellation]]. The reverse features small yellow [[EURion]] 10s and have the fine lines removed from around the vignette of the United States Treasury building. These notes were issued in series 2004A with [[Anna Escobedo Cabral|Cabral]]-[[John W. Snow|Snow]] signatures. The first notes were printed in July 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f2004ad.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Series 2004A $10}}</ref>\n\n===Series dates===\n\n====Small size====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Many believed that Hamilton, as the first Secretary of the Treasury, should remain on U.S. Currency in some form, all the while thinking that U.S. Currency was long overdue to feature a female historical figure \u2013 names that had been raised included [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Harriet Tubman]], and [[Susan B. Anthony]]. This led to the Treasury Department stating that Hamilton would remain on the bill in some way. The $10 bill was chosen because it was scheduled for a regular security redesign, a years-long process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/17/investing/woman-10-bill-redesign-update/ |work=CNN|title=Woman 10 bill redesign update|date=2016}}</ref> The redesigned ten-dollar bill will be the first U.S. note to incorporate tactile features to assist those with visual disabilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bep.gov/images/Meaningful_Access_White_Paper_06-25-13.pdf|work=B of Engraving and Printing|title=Meaningful Access White Paper|date=2013}}</ref>\n\nOn April 20, 2016, it was announced that Alexander Hamilton would remain the primary face on the $10 bill, due in part to the sudden popularity of the first Treasury Secretary after the success of the Broadway musical [[Hamilton (musical)|''Hamilton'']].
