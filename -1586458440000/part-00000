In the US, the [[first-sale doctrine]] means that if you own an object, you have the right to sell it. That raises the question of whether a file on a computer is an object. In 2008, in the case of [[London-Sire Recordings, Inc. v. Doe 1]] it was decided that it is as long as the file has been obtained legally, and that the [[first sale doctrine]] should apply.\n\nSupreme Court rules in favor of First Sale Doctrine for resale of imported books. Ruling provides conduit for digital resale of books purchased outside of the United States into the United States.  \"In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit and held that Kirtsaeng's sale of lawfully-made copies purchased overseas was protected by the first-sale doctrine. The Court held that the first sale doctrine applies to goods manufactured outside of the United States, and the protections and exceptions offered by the Copyright Act to works \"lawfully made under this title\" is not limited by geography. Rather, it applies to all copies legally made anywhere, not just in the United States, in accordance with U.S. copyright law. So, wherever a copy of a book is first made and sold, it can be resold in the U.S. without permission from the publisher.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/03/opinion-analysis-justices-reject-publishers-claims-in-gray-market-copyright-case/ |title=Opinion analysis: Justices reject publisher\u2019s claims in gray-market copyright case |publisher=SCOTUSblog |date=2013-03-19 |accessdate=2020-03-11}}</ref>\n\nSupreme Court rules in favor of Patent/(Copyright) exhaustion in the Lexmark case.  \"The Supreme Court determined that when a patent owner sells a product the sale exhausted patent rights in the item being sold regardless of any restrictions the patentee attempts to impose on the location of the sale.

In 2010, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th circuit appeals court]] ruled that the iTunes terms of service clearly state that an iTunes purchase counts as a license rather than a sale, but there are ongoing court cases to establish this.

ReDigi preliminary hearing was focused on the aspect of the selling process.

However, \"[s]ound policy, as well as history, supports [the Court's] consistent deference to Congress when major technological innovations alter the market for copyrighted materials. Congress has the constitutional authority and the institutional ability to accommodate fully the varied permutations of competing interests that are inevitably implicated by such new technology. Sony, 464 U.S. at 431. Such deference often counsels for a limited interpretation of copyright protection.

Redigi Inc., 1:12-cv-00095 (S.D.N.Y.) via Docket Alarm|website=Docket Alarm}}</ref>\n\n==Legal aspects==\nA number of interesting legal questions are raised by the resale of digital audio files. In the US, the [[first-sale doctrine]] means that if you own an object, you have the right to sell it. That raises the question of whether a file on a computer is an object. In 2008, in the case of [[London-Sire Recordings, Inc. v. Doe 1]] it was decided that it is as long as the file has been obtained legally, and that the [[first sale doctrine]] should apply.\n\nSupreme Court rules in favor of First Sale Doctrine for resale of imported books. Ruling provides conduit for digital resale of books purchased outside of the United States into the United States.  \"In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit and held that Kirtsaeng's sale of lawfully-made copies purchased overseas was protected by the first-sale doctrine. The Court held that the first sale doctrine applies to goods manufactured outside of the United States, and the protections and exceptions offered by the Copyright Act to works \"lawfully made under this title\" is not limited by geography. Rather, it applies to all copies legally made anywhere, not just in the United States, in accordance with U.S. copyright law. So, wherever a copy of a book is first made and sold, it can be resold in the U.S. without permission from the publisher.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/03/opinion-analysis-justices-reject-publishers-claims-in-gray-market-copyright-case/ |title=Opinion analysis: Justices reject publisher\u2019s claims in gray-market copyright case |publisher=SCOTUSblog |date=2013-03-19 |accessdate=2020-03-11}}</ref>\n\nSupreme Court rules in favor of Patent/(Copyright) exhaustion in the Lexmark case.  \"The Supreme Court determined that when a patent owner sells a product the sale exhausted patent rights in the item being sold regardless of any restrictions the patentee attempts to impose on the location of the sale. In other words, a sale of a patented product exhausts all rights \u2014 both domestic and international.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2017/05/30/supreme-court-lexmark-sales-exhausted-patent-rights/id=83824/ |title=Supreme Court rules Lexmark sales exhausted patent rights domestically and internationally - IPWatchdog.com &#124; Patents & Patent Law |publisher=IPWatchdog.com |date= |accessdate=2020-03-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/impression-products-inc-v-lexmark-international-inc/ |title=Impression Products, Inc. v.

In 2010, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th circuit appeals court]] ruled that the iTunes terms of service clearly state that an iTunes purchase counts as a license rather than a sale, but there are ongoing court cases to establish this.  The recent class action suit of [[Rick James]] vs. Universal <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/52271231/Rick-James-v-UMG |title=Rick James v. UMG |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2011-04-04 |accessdate=2020-03-11}}</ref> is one such case.  Universal claims that a digital download constitutes a sale for one likely reason: when it comes to royalties paid to artists, payout percentages for a sale are significantly lower than a license.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matthew Perpetua |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kenny-rogers-sues-capitol-records-over-royalties-20120214 |title=Kenny Rogers Sues Capitol Records Over Royalties |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2012-02-14 |accessdate=2020-03-11}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the Capitol v. ReDigi preliminary hearing was focused on the aspect of the selling process.  In the oral argument, Capitol claimed that it is perfectly acceptable to sell an iPod containing copyrighted music, but that to do it without a transfer of the physical medium that the files are on constitutes a copyright infringement.<ref>http://beckermanlegal.com/Lawyer_Copyright_Internet_Law/capitol_redigi_120206TranscriptOralArgument.pdf</ref>  This is a legal gray area that is debated, but it is relevant because ReDigi is claiming that its technology allows it to avoid any unauthorised copies of files being created in the sale process.\n\nOn April 20, 2013, United States District Court, Southern District of New York has ruled that ReDigi is engaged in illegal activity. \nJudge Richard J.

For example, eBooks that might not be readily affordable to many consumers due to their high prices become more affordable in a secondary market place where there is competition. Fact: the cost of a used book is often less than new and the actual Cost to Read (CTR) is minimal within a resale marketplace, for example an ebook purchased at $10.00 and sold for $8.00 only cost the reader $2.00 to read, not $10.00.

ReDigi ruling on Page 5), opponents including [[RIAA]] and [[Capitol Records]] ([[EMI]]) believe{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} that the reality of uploading and downloading files from the authorized original are indeed copies of one-another by each transfer, and therefore are non-inventoried items, not physical objects in copyright law.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Online music stores of the United States]]\n[[Category:Online content distribution]]\n", "name_user": "The Editor's Apprentice", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed unnecessary link to a non-existent page", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDigi"}

The components can be used in web documents (without frameworks ) and web frameworks compatible with Web Components. These components are the core of Vaadin Flow, a Java web framework that offers a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Application programming interface|API]] on top the each Vaadin component.\n\n=== Basic usage ===\nThe Vaadin components are typically installed with [[Npm (software)|npm]] or Bower. For example, the following command installs the <code>vaadin-button</code> component:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"console\">\nbower install vaadin/vaadin-button\n</syntaxhighlight>Once installed, the component can be used in a web page as follows:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\">\n<html>\n<head>\n    <link rel=\"import\" href=\"bower_components/vaadin-button/vaadin-button.html\" />\n</head>\n<body>\n    <vaadin-button onclick='alert(\"Hello, World\")'>Click me</vaadin-button>\n</body>\n</html>\n</syntaxhighlight>The following is a screenshot of the previous page:\n[[File:Vaadin-components-hello-world-screenshot.png|none|thumb|600x600px]]\n\n=== Available components ===\nThe following table shows a list of the free open-source Web Components included in Vaadin:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" href=\"open source\"\n|+ href=\"Ajax (programming)\" |\nVaadin components\n! href=\"Swing (Java)\" |Component\n!Element name\n! href=\"IT Mill Toolkit\" |Description\n|- href=\"JavaScript\"\n| href=\"Google Web Toolkit\" |Button\n| href=\"Apache License\" |vaadin-button\n| href=\"Michael Widenius\" |Element for customized buttons\n|- href=\"MySQL\"\n|Checkbox\n| href=\"Vaadin Framework\" |vaadin-checkbox\n| href=\"List of animal names\" |Element for customized checkboxes\n|- href=\"reindeer\"\n|Combo box\n| href=\"Category:All articles with unsourced statements\" |vaadin-combo-box\n|Shows a list of items with filtering\n|-\n| href=\"Vaadin Components\" |Context menu\n| href=\"Web Components\" |vaadin-context-menu\n|Shows context dependent items for any element on the page\n|-\n| href=\"Vaadin Components\" |Date picker\n| href=\"Web Components\" |vaadin-date-picker\n| href=\"Application programming interface\" |A date selection field with a scrollable month calendar\n|-\n| href=\"Npm (software)\" |Dialog<td>vaadin-dialog</td>\n|Shows modal dialogs\n|-\n|Dropdown menu\n|vaadin-dropdown-menu\n| href=\"Web application\" |Customizable web component for dropdown menus\n|- href=\"Website\"\n| href=\"Vaadin Framework\" |Form layout\n| href=\"Java (programming language)\" |vaadin-form-layout\n| href=\"HTML\" |Configurable responsive layout for form elements\n|- href=\"Polymer (library)\"\n| href=\"API\" |Grid\n|vaadin-grid\n| href=\"Document Object Model\" |Data grid / data table element\n|-\n|UI icon set\n|vaadin-icons\n| href=\"File:Vaadin-flow-hello-world-screenshot.png\" |A collection of 600+ icons\n|- resource=\"File:Vaadin-flow-hello-world-screenshot.png\" height width\n|Item<td>vaadin-item</td>\n|A container for item elements\n|-<td>List box</td>\n|vaadin-list-box<td>Reusable list boxes</td><tr><td>Notification</td><td>vaadin-notification</td><td>Customized notifications</td></tr><tr><td>Ordered layout</td><td>vaadin-ordered-layout</td><td>Horizontally or vertically align HTML elements</td></tr>\n|-<td>Text field</td><td>[https://vaadin.com/components/vaadin-text-field vaadin-text-field]</td>\n|Themable input controls\n|-\n|Progress bar\n| href=\"Vaadin Components\" |vaadin-progress-bar\n| href=\"Vaadin Flow\" |Customized progress bars\n|-\n| href=\"Vaadin Framework\" |Radio button\n|vaadin-radio-button\n|Customized radio buttons<tr><td>Split layout</td><td>vaadin-split-layout</td><td href=\"GitHub\">Partition a layout into resizeable areas</td></tr><tr><td>Navigation tabs</td><td>vaadin-tabs</td><td>Customized tabs</td></tr><tr><td>Upload</td><td>vaadin-upload</td><td>Upload multiple files with progress indication</td></tr>\n|}\n\n==Vaadin Flow==\n{{Infobox software\n| name = Vaadin Flow\n| logo = Vaadin Logo.svg\n| logo size = 200px\n| logo alt = Vaadin-logo\n| screenshot = Vaadin-flow-bakery.png\n| caption = \n| developer = Vaadin Ltd.\n| latest release version = 2.0.10\n| latest release date = {{Start date and age|2019|09|03|df=yes}}<ref>{{cite web|url = https://github.com/vaadin/flow/releases/tag/2.0.10|title = Release 2.0.10 - Maintenance release \u00b7 vaadin/flow \u00b7 GitHub|website= [[GitHub]]}}</ref>\n| latest preview version = 3.0.0.alpha1\n| latest preview date = {{Start date and age|2019|08|16|df=yes}}<ref>{{cite web|url = https://github.com/vaadin/flow/releases/tag/3.0.0.alpha1|title = Release Vaadin Flow 3.0.0.alpha1 \u00b7 vaadin/flow \u00b7 GitHub|website= [[GitHub]]}}</ref>\n| repo = {{URL|https://github.com/vaadin/flow|Flow Repository}}\n| platform = Java\n| genre = [[Web framework]]\n| license = [[Apache License]] 2.0\n| website = {{URL|http://vaadin.com|vaadin.com/flow}}\n}}'''Vaadin Flow''' (previously [[Vaadin Framework]]) is a web framework for building [[web application]]s and [[website]]s. Vaadin Flow programming model is similar to Vaadin Framework's\u2013It uses [[Java (programming language)|Java]] as the programming language for creating web content. Vaadin Flow features a server-side architecture which means that most of the logic runs on the server. On the client-side, Vaadin Flow is built on top of Web Component standards.\n\nVaadin Flow includes Web Component support for Java developers and allows the use of [[HTML]] templates (based on [[Polymer (library)|Polymer]]) with automated client-server communication. It also includes [[API]]<nowiki/>s for routing (connecting user interface components to URLs), [[data binding]] (synchronizing input fields with server-side data models), and server-side [[Document Object Model|DOM]] manipulation.\n\n=== Basic usage ===\n\nThe following is an elementary example of Vaadin Flow usage: <syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\n@Route(\"hello-world\")\npublic class MainView extends VerticalLayout {\n\n    public MainView() {\n        TextField textField = new TextField(\"Enter your name\");\n\n        Button button = new Button(\"Click me\", event ->\n                add(new Span(\"Hello, \" + textField.getValue())));\n\n        add(textField, button);\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>The following is a screenshot of the previous application: \n[[File:Vaadin-flow-hello-world-screenshot.png|none|thumb|600x600px]]\n\n=== Features ===\n\n==== User interface implementation with only Java ====\nVaadin Flow allows the usage of existing interface components and the implementation of new ones by using Java code running on the server side. It is possible to create and modify the DOM from the server side. The constructor in the following snippet of code shows how to create a new HTML <code>div</code> element, set its <code>id</code> attribute, and add a click listener:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\n@Route(\"\")\npublic class MainView extends Div {\n    public MainView() {\n        Div div = new Div();\n        div.setText(\"Click me\");\n        div.getElement().setAttribute(\"id\", \"main\");\n        div.getElement().addEventListener(\"click\", (DomEventListener) event ->\n                add(new Span(\"Hello, World\")));\n        add(div);\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==== Web Components integration ====\nWeb Components integration is provided through the <code>@Tag</code> and <code>@Import</code> annotations. The following snippet of code shows how to wrap an existing web component in a server-side Java component:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\n@Tag(\"juicy-ace-editor\")\n@HtmlImport(\"bower_components/juicy-ace-editor/juicy-ace-editor.html\")\npublic class JuicyAceEditor extends Div {\n\n    public void setMode(String mode) {\n        getElement().setAttribute(\"mode\", mode);\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==== Router ====\nThe Router is a core concept in Vaadin Flow and enables navigation via URLs. The Router allows the connection of URLs to user interface components. It is based on the HTML5 History API which allows end users to navigate through pages while preserving the page state. The following snippet of code shows how to use the <code>@Route</code> annotation to show the annotated component when the end user requests a URL like <code>http://''yourdomain.com''/hello/world</code>:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\n@Route(\"hello/world\")\npublic class HelloWorldComponent extends Div {\n    public HelloWorldComponent() {\n        setText(\"Hello, World!\");\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==== Data binding ====\nData binding is done through the <code>Binder</code> class. It allows synchronizing the values in input fields with server-side data models. The following snippet of code shows how to bind the <code>name</code> Java field (through the corresponding [[Mutator method|getter and setter]]) of a hypothetical <code>Person</code> class to the value in a <code>TextField</code> component:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\nTextField nameField = new TextField();\n\nBinder<Person> binder = new Binder<>();\nbinder.bind(nameField, Person::getName, Person::setName);\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==== HTML templates ====\nVaadin Flow allows the definition of HTML templates with automated client-server communication and data binding (when using [[Polymer (library)|Polymer]]-based templates). The following is an example of a Polymer-based template:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\">\n<link rel=\"import\" href=\"../bower_components/polymer/polymer-element.html\">\n<link rel=\"import\" href=\"../bower_components/vaadin-text-field/vaadin-text-field.html\">\n\n<dom-module id=\"hello-world\">\n    <template>\n        <vaadin-text-field label=\"Your name\" value=\"{{name}}\"></vaadin-text-field>\n        <button on-click=\"greet\">Click me</button>\n        <div id=\"greeting\">[[greeting]]</div>\n    </template>\n    <script>\n        class HelloWorld extends Polymer.Element {\n            static get is() {\n                return 'hello-world'\n            }\n        }\n        customElements.define(HelloWorld.is, HelloWorld);\n    </script>\n</dom-module>\n</syntaxhighlight>The following snippet of code shows how to connect the previous template to a server-side Java component:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\n@Tag(\"hello-world\")\n@HtmlImport(\"src/hello-world.html\")\npublic class HelloWorld extends PolymerTemplate<HelloWorld.HelloWorldModel> {\n    \n    public interface HelloWorldModel extends TemplateModel {\n        String getName();\n        void setGreeting(String greeting);\n    }\n\n    @EventHandler\n    private void greet() {\n        getModel().setGreeting(\"Hello, \" + getModel().getName());\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==== Look and feel customization ====\nCustomization of the look and feel can be done with [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], HTML custom styles, or by ready-made themes configuration.\n\n==== Spring Integration ====\nVaadin Flow includes [[Spring Framework]] 5 and Spring Boot 2 integration.\n\n<br />\n\n== Certifications ==\nVaadin offered 2 paid [https://vaadin.com/training/certification certification tracks that are taken online] (not available as of November 8, 2019). This was to showcase the developer skills and knowledge about Vaadin Framework and related tools, for successful web application development.\n\n* Vaadin Online Exam for Vaadin 7 Certified Developer\n* Vaadin Online Exam for Vaadin 8 Certified Developer\n\nTo pass the certification you needed to go through the whole documentation and have completed a couple of web applications using the framework. The exams also test your knowledge in certain areas of Java SE, Java EE, GWT (Google Web Toolkit) and HTML/JS/CSS.\n\nCertifications for Vaadin 8, 10 and 14 are now available, since the release of the Learning Center on 3 December 2019. They consist of a series of videos divided into two main tracks, Foundation and Professional, and a final test to earn the certification.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of rich Internet application frameworks]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n<ul><li>Duarte, A.

The components can be used in web documents (without frameworks ) and web frameworks compatible with Web Components. These components are the core of Vaadin Flow, a Java web framework that offers a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Application programming interface|API]] on top the each Vaadin component.\n\n=== Basic usage ===\nThe Vaadin components are typically installed with [[Npm (software)|npm]] or Bower. For example, the following command installs the <code>vaadin-button</code> component:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"console\">\nbower install vaadin/vaadin-button\n</syntaxhighlight>Once installed, the component can be used in a web page as follows:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\">\n<html>\n<head>\n    <link rel=\"import\" href=\"bower_components/vaadin-button/vaadin-button.html\" />\n</head>\n<body>\n    <vaadin-button onclick='alert(\"Hello, World\")'>Click me</vaadin-button>\n</body>\n</html>\n</syntaxhighlight>The following is a screenshot of the previous page:\n[[File:Vaadin-components-hello-world-screenshot.png|none|thumb|600x600px]]\n\n=== Available components ===\nThe following table shows a list of the free open-source Web Components included in Vaadin:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" href=\"open source\"\n|+ href=\"Ajax (programming)\" |\nVaadin components\n! href=\"Swing (Java)\" |Component\n!Element name\n! href=\"IT Mill Toolkit\" |Description\n|- href=\"JavaScript\"\n| href=\"Google Web Toolkit\" |Button\n| href=\"Apache License\" |vaadin-button\n| href=\"Michael Widenius\" |Element for customized buttons\n|- href=\"MySQL\"\n|Checkbox\n| href=\"Vaadin Framework\" |vaadin-checkbox\n| href=\"List of animal names\" |Element for customized checkboxes\n|- href=\"reindeer\"\n|Combo box\n| href=\"Category:All articles with unsourced statements\" |vaadin-combo-box\n|Shows a list of items with filtering\n|-\n| href=\"Vaadin Components\" |Context menu\n| href=\"Web Components\" |vaadin-context-menu\n|Shows context dependent items for any element on the page\n|-\n| href=\"Vaadin Components\" |Date picker\n| href=\"Web Components\" |vaadin-date-picker\n| href=\"Application programming interface\" |A date selection field with a scrollable month calendar\n|-\n| href=\"Npm (software)\" |Dialog<td>vaadin-dialog</td>\n|Shows modal dialogs\n|-\n|Dropdown menu\n|vaadin-dropdown-menu\n| href=\"Web application\" |Customizable web component for dropdown menus\n|- href=\"Website\"\n| href=\"Vaadin Framework\" |Form layout\n| href=\"Java (programming language)\" |vaadin-form-layout\n| href=\"HTML\" |Configurable responsive layout for form elements\n|- href=\"Polymer (library)\"\n| href=\"API\" |Grid\n|vaadin-grid\n| href=\"Document Object Model\" |Data grid / data table element\n|-\n|UI icon set\n|vaadin-icons\n| href=\"File:Vaadin-flow-hello-world-screenshot.png\" |A collection of 600+ icons\n|- resource=\"File:Vaadin-flow-hello-world-screenshot.png\" height width\n|Item<td>vaadin-item</td>\n|A container for item elements\n|-<td>List box</td>\n|vaadin-list-box<td>Reusable list boxes</td><tr><td>Notification</td><td>vaadin-notification</td><td>Customized notifications</td></tr><tr><td>Ordered layout</td><td>vaadin-ordered-layout</td><td>Horizontally or vertically align HTML elements</td></tr>\n|-<td>Text field</td><td>[https://vaadin.com/components/vaadin-text-field vaadin-text-field]</td>\n|Themable input controls\n|-\n|Progress bar\n| href=\"Vaadin Components\" |vaadin-progress-bar\n| href=\"Vaadin Flow\" |Customized progress bars\n|-\n| href=\"Vaadin Framework\" |Radio button\n|vaadin-radio-button\n|Customized radio buttons<tr><td>Split layout</td><td>vaadin-split-layout</td><td href=\"GitHub\">Partition a layout into resizeable areas</td></tr><tr><td>Navigation tabs</td><td>vaadin-tabs</td><td>Customized tabs</td></tr><tr><td>Upload</td><td>vaadin-upload</td><td>Upload multiple files with progress indication</td></tr>\n|}\n\n==Vaadin Flow==\n{{Infobox software\n| name = Vaadin Flow\n| logo = Vaadin Logo.svg\n| logo size = 200px\n| logo alt = Vaadin-logo\n| screenshot = Vaadin-flow-bakery.png\n| caption = \n| developer = Vaadin Ltd.\n| latest release version = 2.0.10\n| latest release date = {{Start date and age|2019|09|03|df=yes}}<ref>{{cite web|url = https://github.com/vaadin/flow/releases/tag/2.0.10|title = Release 2.0.10 - Maintenance release \u00b7 vaadin/flow \u00b7 GitHub|website= [[GitHub]]}}</ref>\n| latest preview version = 3.0.0.alpha1\n| latest preview date = {{Start date and age|2019|08|16|df=yes}}<ref>{{cite web|url = https://github.com/vaadin/flow/releases/tag/3.0.0.alpha1|title = Release Vaadin Flow 3.0.0.alpha1 \u00b7 vaadin/flow \u00b7 GitHub|website= [[GitHub]]}}</ref>\n| repo = {{URL|https://github.com/vaadin/flow|Flow Repository}}\n| platform = Java\n| genre = [[Web framework]]\n| license = [[Apache License]] 2.0\n| website = {{URL|http://vaadin.com|vaadin.com/flow}}\n}}'''Vaadin Flow''' (previously [[Vaadin Framework]]) is a web framework for building [[web application]]s and [[website]]s. Vaadin Flow programming model is similar to Vaadin Framework's\u2013It uses [[Java (programming language)|Java]] as the programming language for creating web content. Vaadin Flow features a server-side architecture which means that most of the logic runs on the server. On the client-side, Vaadin Flow is built on top of Web Component standards.\n\nVaadin Flow includes Web Component support for Java developers and allows the use of [[HTML]] templates (based on [[Polymer (library)|Polymer]]) with automated client-server communication. It also includes [[API]]<nowiki/>s for routing (connecting user interface components to URLs), [[data binding]] (synchronizing input fields with server-side data models), and server-side [[Document Object Model|DOM]] manipulation.\n\n=== Basic usage ===\n\nThe following is an elementary example of Vaadin Flow usage: <syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\n@Route(\"hello-world\")\npublic class MainView extends VerticalLayout {\n\n    public MainView() {\n        TextField textField = new TextField(\"Enter your name\");\n\n        Button button = new Button(\"Click me\", event ->\n                add(new Span(\"Hello, \" + textField.getValue())));\n\n        add(textField, button);\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>The following is a screenshot of the previous application: \n[[File:Vaadin-flow-hello-world-screenshot.png|none|thumb|600x600px]]\n\n=== Features ===\n\n==== User interface implementation with only Java ====\nVaadin Flow allows the usage of existing interface components and the implementation of new ones by using Java code running on the server side. It is possible to create and modify the DOM from the server side. The constructor in the following snippet of code shows how to create a new HTML <code>div</code> element, set its <code>id</code> attribute, and add a click listener:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\n@Route(\"\")\npublic class MainView extends Div {\n    public MainView() {\n        Div div = new Div();\n        div.setText(\"Click me\");\n        div.getElement().setAttribute(\"id\", \"main\");\n        div.getElement().addEventListener(\"click\", (DomEventListener) event ->\n                add(new Span(\"Hello, World\")));\n        add(div);\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==== Web Components integration ====\nWeb Components integration is provided through the <code>@Tag</code> and <code>@Import</code> annotations. The following snippet of code shows how to wrap an existing web component in a server-side Java component:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\n@Tag(\"juicy-ace-editor\")\n@HtmlImport(\"bower_components/juicy-ace-editor/juicy-ace-editor.html\")\npublic class JuicyAceEditor extends Div {\n\n    public void setMode(String mode) {\n        getElement().setAttribute(\"mode\", mode);\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==== Router ====\nThe Router is a core concept in Vaadin Flow and enables navigation via URLs. The Router allows the connection of URLs to user interface components. It is based on the HTML5 History API which allows end users to navigate through pages while preserving the page state. The following snippet of code shows how to use the <code>@Route</code> annotation to show the annotated component when the end user requests a URL like <code>http://''yourdomain.com''/hello/world</code>:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\n@Route(\"hello/world\")\npublic class HelloWorldComponent extends Div {\n    public HelloWorldComponent() {\n        setText(\"Hello, World!\");\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==== Data binding ====\nData binding is done through the <code>Binder</code> class. It allows synchronizing the values in input fields with server-side data models. The following snippet of code shows how to bind the <code>name</code> Java field (through the corresponding [[Mutator method|getter and setter]]) of a hypothetical <code>Person</code> class to the value in a <code>TextField</code> component:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\nTextField nameField = new TextField();\n\nBinder<Person> binder = new Binder<>();\nbinder.bind(nameField, Person::getName, Person::setName);\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==== HTML templates ====\nVaadin Flow allows the definition of HTML templates with automated client-server communication and data binding (when using [[Polymer (library)|Polymer]]-based templates). The following is an example of a Polymer-based template:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\">\n<link rel=\"import\" href=\"../bower_components/polymer/polymer-element.html\">\n<link rel=\"import\" href=\"../bower_components/vaadin-text-field/vaadin-text-field.html\">\n\n<dom-module id=\"hello-world\">\n    <template>\n        <vaadin-text-field label=\"Your name\" value=\"{{name}}\"></vaadin-text-field>\n        <button on-click=\"greet\">Click me</button>\n        <div id=\"greeting\">[[greeting]]</div>\n    </template>\n    <script>\n        class HelloWorld extends Polymer.Element {\n            static get is() {\n                return 'hello-world'\n            }\n        }\n        customElements.define(HelloWorld.is, HelloWorld);\n    </script>\n</dom-module>\n</syntaxhighlight>The following snippet of code shows how to connect the previous template to a server-side Java component:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\n@Tag(\"hello-world\")\n@HtmlImport(\"src/hello-world.html\")\npublic class HelloWorld extends PolymerTemplate<HelloWorld.HelloWorldModel> {\n    \n    public interface HelloWorldModel extends TemplateModel {\n        String getName();\n        void setGreeting(String greeting);\n    }\n\n    @EventHandler\n    private void greet() {\n        getModel().setGreeting(\"Hello, \" + getModel().getName());\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==== Look and feel customization ====\nCustomization of the look and feel can be done with [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], HTML custom styles, or by ready-made themes configuration.\n\n==== Spring Integration ====\nVaadin Flow includes [[Spring Framework]] 5 and Spring Boot 2 integration.\n\n<br />\n\n== Certifications ==\nVaadin offered 2 paid [https://vaadin.com/training/certification certification tracks that are taken online] (not available as of November 8, 2019). This were to showcase the developer skills and knowledge about Vaadin Framework and related tools, for successful web application development.\n\n* Vaadin Online Exam for Vaadin 7 Certified Developer\n* Vaadin Online Exam for Vaadin 8 Certified Developer\n\nTo pass the certification you needed to go though the whole documentation and have completed a couple of web application using the framework. The exams also tests you knowledge in certain areas of Java SE, Java EE, GWT (Google Web Toolkit) and HTML/JS/CSS.\n\nCertifications for Vaadin 8, 10 and 14 are now available, since the release of the Learning Center in 3 December 2019. They consist of a series of videos divided in two main tracks, Foundation and Professional, and a final test to earn the certification.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of rich Internet application frameworks]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n<ul><li>Duarte, A.
