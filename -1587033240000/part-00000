It used to be in the abolished [[Marstal Municipality]].\n\nMarstal has a long maritime history. For centuries Marstal vessels have sailed the seven seas, and even today the town is the home port for a considerable number of coasters. Shipping is still the nerve of the town with its dockyards, its shipping companies and its maritime school which for more than a century has trained navigators for the Danish merchant fleet.\n\nMarstal is the economic center of Aeroe and the main industries are tourism, small industry and service.

During the 17th and 18th centuries its living depended predominantly on the building and sailing of wooden ships. In the harbour is a small island Frederiks\u00f8en, which today is called the Lime Kiln (Kalkovnen). The impressive [[fieldstone]] pier at the island was built in 1825 by local seamen on a voluntary basis. The island was in use as a repair yard for ships, until in 1863 it was rented out for lime burning.\n\nThe town did not grow around a square or a church, its houses were simply erected along the paths leading upwards from the jetties. As the town grew transverse ring-roads were added, and the narrowness of the settlement often meant that the houses were placed somewhat coincidentally.\n\nThe [[First World War]] put an end to optimism and changed the glorious maritime traditions of Marstal. 42 ships from Marstal were sunk at the loss of 53 seamen.

He currently plays for [[Jokerit]] of the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL). Anttila was selected by [[Chicago Blackhawks]] in the 9th round (260th overall) of the [[2004 NHL Entry Draft]]. His large physical stature has earned him the nickname [[The_Groke|the Groke]].<ref>https://www.iihf.com/en/events/2019/wm/news/13125/nothing-like-the-third-time</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nMarko Anttila played his first senior level ice hockey games during the 2003\u201304 season. Anttila's first team was his hometown team [[LeKi|Lemp\u00e4\u00e4l\u00e4n Kisa]] of [[Lemp\u00e4\u00e4l\u00e4]].\n[[File:Anttila Marko Ilves.jpg|thumb|left|Marko Anttila|190px]]\nAnttila scored 38 points in 22 [[Suomi-sarja]] regular season games during his debut season. Though playing in the 3rd highest level in Finland, Anttila was drafted by the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] in the [[2004 NHL Entry Draft]] while he was playing for LeKi. It is believed{{by whom|date=August 2014}} that Anttila's connections with Chicago's scout for Finland, [[Sakari Pietil\u00e4]], was the reason why he was drafted. His large size (over 6'8&nbsp;ft tall) combined to his hard slap shot were the most convincing factors that influenced Sakari Pietil\u00e4 suggested him to the Blackhawks.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nAfter being drafted while playing for small town's team, Anttila soon was reckoned as a player to invest on. Marko Anttila was contracted by [[Ilves]] in 2004. Anttila struggled during his first season in [[SM-liiga]] but soon got the hand of playing in bigger levels.\n\nIn 2007\u201308, Anttila scored his SM-liiga career-high when he racked 23 points in 56 games and he was selected to play for Finnish National team during the European Hockey Tour.\n\nOn 26 April 2011, Anttila made a one-year contract with [[HC TPS|TPS]]. In June 2013 it was announced that Anttila would join [[Metallurg Novokuznetsk]] of the [[Kontinental Hockey League|KHL]].\n\nAfter parts of three seasons with [[\u00d6rebro HK]] of the [[Swedish Hockey League]], Anttila returned to the KHL, linking up on a one-year deal with Finnish based club, Jokerit on April 20, 2016.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.jokerit.com/anttila-ja-marjamaki-hyokkaykseen | title = Anttila and Marjamaki added to attack |publisher=[[Jokerit]] |website=jokerit.com | language = Finnish | date = 2016-04-20 | accessdate = 2016-04-20}}</ref>\n\nIn the midst of the [[2016-17 KHL season|2016\u201317]] season, having added a physical presence to the checking lines, Anttila agreed to a two-year contract extension to remain with Jokerit on January 8, 2017.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.jokerit.com/anniversary-season | title = Jokerit extend Anttila for two years |website=jokerit.com |publisher=[[Jokerit]] | date = 2017-01-08 | accessdate = 2017-01-08 | language = Finnish}}</ref>\n\n==International play==\n{{MedalTableTop|name=}}\n{{MedalSport|[[Ice hockey]]}}\n{{MedalCountry|{{FIN}}}}\n{{MedalCompetition|[[Ice Hockey World Championships|World Championships]]}}\n{{MedalGold|[[2019 IIHF World Championship|2019 Slovakia]]|}}\n{{MedalBottom}}\nIn 2019, Anttila served as captain when [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] won their third [[2019 IIHF World Championship|gold medal]] in the [[Ice Hockey World Championships]].

Most (but not all) of Finland's curling medals have been achieved with Uusipaavalniemi as skip. Uusipaavalniemi's team won the [[European Curling Championships|European championship]] in 2000. He is also a two-time [[World Curling Championships]] bronze medalist (1998 and 2000) and two-time European Curling Championships bronze medalist (1999 and 2001).\n\nUusipaavalniemi's Finland team disappointingly finished fifth at the [[Curling at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Olympic tournament]].\n[[File:Markku Uusipaavalniemi at Oulunkyl\u00e4 Curling Hall March 02 2006.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Markku Uusipaavalniemi at Oulunkyl\u00e4 Curling Hall]]\nIn 2004, he and his somewhat altered Finland line-up pulled off the daunting task of securing qualification for the [[2005 Ford World Men's Curling Championship]]s from the 'B' competition at the European championships, where they languished following the country's relegation the previous season.  To do this, they had to win the competition outright, and then overcome [[Russia]] in an additional play-off match.\n \nAt the 2005 World Championship, Uusipaavalniemi's team finished the round-robin tied for first place with five other teams on an 8\u20133 record. In the tie-breakers however, they were knocked out of contention by [[Canada]]'s [[Randy Ferbey]]. Also in 2005, Uusipaavalniemi won the first ever [[European Mixed Curling Championships]] with teammates [[Kirsi Nyk\u00e4nen]], Teemu Salo and [[Tiina Kautonen]] in [[Andorra]].\n\nUusipaavalniemi's Finland team finished the round-robin at the [[Curling at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Olympic tournament]] in first place, with a 7\u20132 record. They beat [[Great Britain]] 4\u20133 in the semi-final, with the last stone of the final end \u2014 thrown by Uusipaavalniemi \u2014 giving the Finns the deciding point. Finland lost the final to Canada 10-4 taking the silver medal.\n\nTwo weeks before the start of the [[2006 World Men's Curling Championship]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], Uusipaavalniemi suffered a wrist injury that forced him to miss the team's first three games of the competition. He recovered enough to start playing in the fourth game, where he skipped and threw second rocks. He played out the rest of the competition throwing third rocks, but Finland did not make the playoff round, finishing tied for fifth with a 6\u20135 record.\n\nUusipaavalniemi returned to the [[2007 Ford World Men's Curling Championship]] but his team got off to a rough start, losing their first two games and stringing together back-to-back wins only twice. Finland qualified for a tiebreaker with a 6\u20135 record, but lost to [[Germany]] 8-5 and finished sixth. Markku admitted that his recent campaign for (and eventual election to) Finnish parliament had forced him to cut back on curling practice time, perhaps contributing to the team's early struggles.\n\nAfter the 2007 World Championships Uusipaavalniemi didn't play at a competitive level until he returned to curling in the [[2009\u201310 curling season|2009\u201310 season]] with a new team. The new team won the Finnish Championship in the [[2010\u201311 curling season]] and represented Finland in [[2011 European Curling Championships]]. The appearance in the 2011 Europeans was a disappointment when Finland finished 7th in the B-group.\n\n==Political career==\nOn 20 September 2006 Uusipaavalniemi announced his candidacy for [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish parliament]] in the [[2007 Finnish parliamentary election|2007 election]] for the [[Keskusta|Centre Party]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20061013200641/http://www.keskusta.fi/apila/uutiset/?article_id=13095]. Uusipaavalniemi was elected along with three other members of his party from the [[Uusimaa]] constituency.\nHe voted against the further privatization of government owned companies as well as against the Lisbon treaty, both of which were supported by the party.\n\nOn 11 November 2010 Uusipaavalniemi defected from the Centre Party and joined the ranks of the [[True Finns]] Party.<ref>http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/11/mp_defects_conservatives_take_top_spot_2134311.html</ref> He was not reelected in the 2011 election.\n\n==Personal life==\nUusipaavalniemi lives in [[Helsinki]]. He is divorced and has three children. His older brother [[Jussi Uusipaavalniemi|Jussi]] taught him how to curl.\n\n==Awards==\n* [[Colin Campbell Award]]: 1998, 2003\n* Markku of the Year, 2002.
