Both [[defendant]]s instructed [[Richard Rampton]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] while Penguin also instructed Heather Rogers as junior counsel. The expert witnesses for the defence included [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] historian [[Richard J. Evans]], [[Christopher Browning]], [[Robert Jan van Pelt]], and [[Peter Longerich]].\n\n[[English defamation law|English libel law]] places the burden of proof on the defendant rather than the plaintiff. [[wikisource:David Irving v. Penguin Books and Deborah Lipstadt|Lipstadt and Penguin won the case]] using the justification defence, namely by demonstrating in court that Lipstadt's accusations against Irving were substantially true and therefore not libelous. The case was argued as a [[bench trial]] before [[Charles Gray (English judge)|Mr Justice Gray]], who produced a written judgment 349 pages long detailing Irving's systematic distortion of the historical record of [[World War II]]. ''[[The Times]]'' (April 14, 2000, p.&nbsp;23) said of Lipstadt's victory, \"History has had its day in court and scored a crushing victory.\"<ref>[http://www.hdot.org/en/trial/index.html Holocaust Denial On Trial: Holocaust Denial and the 2000 Libel Trial in the U.K.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815102201/http://hdot.org/en/trial/index.html |date=2015-08-15 }}, a project of The Rabbi Donald A.

In Austria, minimizing the atrocities of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] is a crime punishable with up to 10 years' imprisonment. Speaking of Irving, Lipstadt said, \"I am uncomfortable with imprisoning people for speech. Let him go and let him fade from everyone's radar screens ...

Speaking of Nolte in a 2003 interview, Lipstadt stated:\n\n{{quote|Historians such as the German Ernst Nolte are, in some ways, even more dangerous than the deniers. Nolte is an anti-Semite of the first order, who attempts to rehabilitate [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] by saying that he was no worse than [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]; but he is careful not to deny the Holocaust. Holocaust-deniers make Nolte's life more comfortable. They have, with their radical argumentation, pulled the center a little more to their side. Consequently, a less radical extremist, such as Nolte, finds himself closer to the middle ground, which makes him more dangerous.<ref>[http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-11.htm \"Denial of the Holocaust and Immoral Equivalence\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816010915/http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-11.htm |date=2007-08-16 }} ''The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs'' (August 1, 2003).</ref>}}\n\nIn late 2011, Lipstadt attacked American and Israeli politicians for what she called their invocation of the Holocaust for contemporary political purposes, something she thought mangled history.

Both [[defendant]]s instructed [[Richard Rampton]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] while Penguin also instructed Heather Rogers as junior counsel. The expert witnesses for the defence included [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] historian [[Richard J.

[[wikisource:David Irving v.

The case was argued as a [[bench trial]] before [[Charles Gray (English judge)|Mr Justice Gray]], who produced a written judgment 349 pages long detailing Irving's systematic distortion of the historical record of [[World War II]]. ''[[The Times]]'' (April 14, 2000, p.&nbsp;23) said of Lipstadt's victory, \"History has had its day in court and scored a crushing victory.\"<ref>[http://www.hdot.org/en/trial/index.html Holocaust Denial On Trial: Holocaust Denial and the 2000 Libel Trial in the U.K.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815102201/http://hdot.org/en/trial/index.html |date=2015-08-15 }}, a project of The Rabbi Donald A.

Speaking of Nolte in a 2003 interview, Lipstadt stated:\n\n{{quote|Historians such as the German Ernst Nolte are, in some ways, even more dangerous than the deniers.

Holocaust-deniers make Nolte's life more comfortable. They have, with their radical argumentation, pulled the center a little more to their side. Consequently, a less radical extremist, such as Nolte, finds himself closer to the middle ground, which makes him more dangerous.<ref>[http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-11.htm \"Denial of the Holocaust and Immoral Equivalence\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816010915/http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-11.htm |date=2007-08-16 }} ''The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs'' (August 1, 2003).</ref>}}\n\nIn late 2011, Lipstadt attacked American and Israeli politicians for what she called their invocation of the Holocaust for contemporary political purposes, something she thought mangled history.

It occurred on January 7\u2013February 1, 1919, less than a year after [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|Bessarabia's annexation]] by the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]. The city it was centered on is now known as [[Khotyn]] (\u0425\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d), and is located in [[Chernivtsi Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]; in 1919, it was the capital of [[Hotin County]], on the unofficial border between Romania and the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR). The revolt was carried out by armed locals, mainly Ukrainian peasants, assisted by [[Cossack]] deserters from the [[Ukrainian People's Army]] and groups of [[Moldovans]], with some support from local [[Bolsheviks]] and [[White movement|White Russians]]. It forms part of the [[Ukrainian War of Independence]], though whether or not the UNR covertly supported it, beyond formally reneging it, is a matter of dispute. The role of Bolsheviks, which has been traditionally highlighted in Romanian and [[Soviet historiography]] alike, is similarly debated. The Khotin Uprising is therefore ambiguously linked to the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War]].\n\nAfter days of guerilla activities by peasants, a large contingent of trained partisans crossed the [[Dniester]] from UNR territory, and, on January 23, managed to capture the city, creating confusion among [[Romanian Army]] garrisons. This group then formed a \"Directorate\", acting as Khotin's unrecognized government. It aimed to change the status of the county, or of all Bessarabia, ahead of the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919\u20131920|Paris Peace Conference]], but remained internally divided into pro-UNR and pro-Bolshevik factions. Within days, the Directorate was toppled by the returning Romanian Army under General [[Cleante Davidoglu]], which also began a hunt for armed peasants. Critics of the intervention count 11,000 or more as killed during arbitrary shootings and shelling of localities on both banks of the Dniester, with 50,000 expelled. Romanian Army sources acknowledge that the repression was violent, while they may dispute the body count.\n\nParticipants in the revolt were generally alienated by the UNR's inaction, dividing themselves between the [[Red Army]] and the Whites. The Khotin Uprising was closely followed by a [[Bender Uprising|raid on Tighina]], carried out by the Bessarabian Bolshevik [[Grigory Kotovsky]], whose forces came to include Khotin veterans. Such incidents secured Bessarabia for [[Greater Romania]], seen by the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] as a guarantee against communist revolution. In late 1919, the [[Armed Forces of South Russia]], coalescing various White entities, sketched out an attempt to invade Bessarabia, but  [[Odessa Operation (1920)|lost ground to the Red Army]]. The emerging [[Soviet Union]] continued to back partisans in Hotin County during the interwar, until [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina|annexing Bessarabia entirely]] in 1940.\n\n==Background==\n===Before 1918===\nThe Ukrainian claim to Khotin (or Hotin) extends back to the [[Principality of Halych]], with reports that Ukrainians had settled there before the lands fell to the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1301\u20131526)|Hungarian Kingdom]].<ref>Potylchak, p. 205</ref> The city then belonged to the [[Principality of Moldavia]], which [[Foundation of Moldavia|grew out of a Hungarian fief]], before becoming a [[Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire|tributary state]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Imperial Russia]] began its incursions into Moldavia with the [[Pruth River Campaign]] of 1710\u20131711, prompting the Ottomans to annex [[Khotyn Fortress]] and reconstruct the corresponding [[Hotin County]] into a distinct ''[[Raya (country subdivision)|raya]]'' in 1714.<ref>Br\u0103tianu, pp. 53, 63\u201364</ref> The city was finally absorbed into Russia following the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Bucharest Treaty of 1812]], during which time it was recognized by all parties as being distinct from Bessarabia-proper.<ref>Br\u0103tianu, pp. 43, 53\u201354, 63\u201364; Cazacu, pp. 62\u201363</ref> A census conducted five years later reported that 7,000 \"[[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]]\" families had been colonized into the area by Russia.<ref>Br\u0103tianu, pp. 71\u201372</ref> Immigration continued at a steady pace, and was in large part a private enterprise, with hired hands needed for the \"immense estates\" of [[Boyars of Moldavia and Wallachia|Moldo-Bessarabian boyars]].<ref>Cazacu, p. 78</ref> By 1900, Ukrainians were a likely majority of the area's population,<ref>Br\u0103tianu, p. 133; Cazacu, p. 76</ref> although no definitive count exists. According to historian Nicolae Enciu, in 1918 there were 121 all-Ukrainian villages, 52 all-[[Romanians|Romanian]], and 16 mixed.<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, p. 81</ref> Khotin town was populated by [[Bessarabian Jews]], though accounts differ on their number, from a vast majority<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 18</ref> to a fifth of the inhabitants.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 26</ref>\n\nUnder Russian rule, Hotin County was incorporated with the [[Bessarabia Governorate]]. Its assembly, or ''[[Zemstvo]]'', overrepresented [[Russian nobility]], in particular the rival Krupensky and Lisovsky families; in 1900, it was dominated by members of the former, including [[Alexander N. Krupensky]].<ref>Coad\u0103, pp. 214\u2013217</ref> Its control was looser from 1912, when the ''Zemstvo'' presidency went to a [[Romanian nationalist]], Dimitrie A. Ouatul.<ref>Coad\u0103, pp. 243\u2013244</ref> Russian dominance was again being challenged during World War I, when the northern areas of Hotin were a devastated battlefield, along with the neighboring [[Duchy of Bukovina]].<ref>Basciani, pp. 98, 106; Gumen\u00e2i, p. 81</ref> The latter was an extension of [[Austria-Hungary]], which envisioned annexing Khotin upon defeating Russia and Romania.<ref>Ungureanu, p. 121</ref> Following the [[February Revolution]], Ouatul became Commissar for Khotin, appointed by the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. His attempt to reassert control was ineffectual, as previously disenfranchised social groups began forming their own [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] and refusing to abide by central laws.<ref>Cazacu, pp. 186, 194</ref> These decreed the [[Collective farming|socialization]] of all landed estates.<ref>Fostoy, p. 594</ref>\n\nThe Provisional Government fell during the [[November Revolution]], which left Bessarabia and Khotin with an uncertain status. Bessarabia formally reorganized itself into an autonomous [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]] (RDM), headed by the former Russian envoy, [[Ion Incule\u021b]]. Incule\u021b himself noted that the region, including Khotin, needed to be defended from Romanian and Ukrainian separatism, and remain attached to a [[Russian Republic|Russian Federated Republic]]. He cited \"devastation in the land of Hotin\" as one of the main reasons for establishing a regional government.<ref>Cazacu, pp. 232, 250</ref> Ten cohorts of the newly formed [[Armed Forces of the Republic of Moldova|Bessarabian Army]] were ordered to resume control of the region.<ref>Cazacu, p. 250</ref> \n\nAlso newly proclaimed, the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR) maintained friendly relations with the RDM and Romania.

Although Marghiloman went into the negotiations promising that \"under no circumstances would we lose Hotin\",<ref>Cancicov, p. 436</ref> the act ceded 600 [[square kilometer]]s of land to Austrian Bukovina, including parts of the county, alongside the neighboring [[Hertsa region]].<ref>Ungureanu, pp. 129\u2013130, 134</ref> Under the resulting regime, parts of Hotin that were either annexed or occupied by Austria were exploited, as a breadbasket for the peoples of Austria-Hungary. This tactic, which was enforced with Marghiloman's acquiescence,<ref>Meltyukhov, pp. 52\u201353</ref> led to severe shortages by June 1918. Within months, the Hungarian military administration dissolved all soviets and offices answering to the [[Central Council of Ukraine]], only delegating authority to the reestablished ''Zemstvo''.<ref>Dubitska, pp. 67\u201369</ref> Faced with such constraints, local Ukrainians began organizing into partisan units.<ref>Fostoy, pp. 594\u2013595; Potylchak, p. 208</ref> \n\nIn April, the UNR itself was replaced by a more Austrian- and White-friendly regime, the [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]], which made some efforts to extend itself into Hotin County and the \"four parishes\" of Soroca. A branch of the Ukrainian Army, including a 2nd Cavalry Division under Commandant Kolesnikov, was established in Khotin, whose civilian authorities argued that Marghiloman had willingly renounced his claims to the area.<ref>Rusnak ''et al.''. pp. 40\u201341</ref> On May 26, judge Oleksa Suharenko was appointed Khotin's ''[[Starosta]]'' by authorities from the [[Podolian Governorate]], situated across the [[Dniester]]; he never took charge, as he was soon replaced by a P.

The Austrian authorities ultimately consented to Izbytskyi's arrival, but stripped him of any real power.<ref>Rusnak ''et al.''. pp. 40\u201341</ref> By July 1918, Romanians grew alarmed about reports that Hetmanate representatives, including [[Oleksander Shulhyn]], were seeking to annex Bessarabia in its entirety.<ref>Iorga, pp. 29, 43</ref>\n\nIn November 1918, [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Germany's armistice]] changed the course of politics in the region. The unification of Bessarabia with Romania became effective the same month, when regional autonomy was dissolved. In Hotin County, control had remained notional until late autumn: on October 22, 1918, a majority of the ''Zemstvo'' voted in favor of the county's reunification with Russia,<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 17</ref> voicing their fear that the Romanian Army's presence in Bessarabia would end with annexation.<ref>Potylchak, p. 206</ref> As his final act in government, Marghiloman ordered his troops to take Hotin and Bukovina, together.<ref>Cazacu, p. 331</ref> The 1st Romanian Cavalry Division, part of the [[Fifth Army (Romania)|Fifth Army]], moved into the former region; it was spearheaded by the 3rd [[Ro\u0219iori (military unit)|Redcoats]] Regiment and the 40th Infantry Regiment, both of which were placed under General [[Cleante Davidoglu]].<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 14.

He had by then been ordered to leave the county, and was issuing his official acts from across the river, in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]].<ref>Rusnak ''et al.'', p. 41</ref> In his own proclamation from Khotin, Davidoglu insisted that \"Bessarabia was a Romanian province until 1812, and it remains Romanian land today and forever\", warning those who disagreed with him that they could leave for Podolia.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 20</ref>\n\nIn December, the UNR was reestablished, and its leaders resumed their observation of Romanian activities in Hotin County. Its [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] heard reports according to which \"all peasant, provincial, county and even district congresses\" supported the notion that Khotin belonged in a [[Greater Ukraine]].<ref>Potylchak, pp. 205\u2013206</ref> UNR sources describe late 1918 as marked by a \"terror policy\", including \"shootings of mostly innocent people, the torture of women, children and the elderly, looting, bullying and violence against women [and] a broad system of denunciation\".<ref>Potylchak, pp. 206\u2013207</ref> Ukrainian peasants on the Romanian side of the border were additionally troubled by the newly adopted [[Land reform in Romania|land reform legislation]], which returned some land to owners that local soviets had dispossessed, and made other plots subject to ransom.<ref>Potylchak, p. 207</ref> \n\nReports by UNR Podolian officials noted that by December \"gangs of [[Moldovans]]\", assisted by the Ukrainians of [[Stara Ushytsia]], made random attacks on Romanian border guards across the Dniester. Following one such killing, Romanian artillery shelled Stara Ushytsia on December 24.<ref>Potylchak, p. 207</ref> UNR officials initially agreed with Davidoglu that these were \"bandit\" raids. They became reluctant when Romanians presented them with an ultimatum to hand in those responsible, and were further alienated when Romanian troops beat up an UNR border guard at [[Zhvanets]].<ref>Potylchak, pp. 207\u2013208, 210</ref> However, on January 5, they refused to acknowledge an appeal by the \"Bessarabian National Union\", which asked for intervention in support of Hotin County refugees.<ref>Stopchak, p. 346</ref> Instead, Khotin's inhabitants found support from the Committee for the Salvation of Bessarabia, which reunited [[Russian nationalism|Russian nationalists]] associated with the Whites. With funds received from the [[Volunteer Army]], ''[[Polkovnik]]'' Zhurari began the training of guerillas at [[Tiraspol]].<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 80\u201381</ref>\n\n==Unfolding==\n[[File:Ignacy Pawe\u0142 Fudakowski - Most na Dniestrze w \u017bwa\u0144cu na Podolu (94-111-3).jpg|thumb|400px|[[Zhvanets]] and wooden bridge over the [[Dniester]], seen from [[Ataky|Atachi]] (1915 photograph)]]\nAccording to [[Transnistria]]n academic [[Piotr \u0218ornikov]], Zhurari and his Committee planned for the rebellion to ignite just before the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919\u20131920|Paris Peace Conference]], which was to analyze the issue of Bessarabia and Khotin.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 82</ref> Romanian rule was still consolidating<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, p. 81</ref> when the armed rebellion began.

In the early stages of the rebellion, it acted out on its previous warnings, repeatedly shelling the Podolian villages of [[Nahoriany]] and [[Kozliv, Mohyliv-Podilskyi|Kozliv]].<ref>Potylchak, pp. 208, 210</ref> During this interval, Davidoglu's troops were joined by various units, including the entire 37th Infantry Regiment, which moved from [[Bac\u0103u]] to Noua Suli\u021b\u0103, and the machine-gunners of [[B\u0103l\u021bi]].<ref>Moisa, pp. 160\u2013162; St\u0103nescu, p. 24</ref> On January 28\u201330, the regrouped units, under Colonel Victor Tomoroveanu, forced rebels out of Noua Suli\u021b\u0103, Ned\u0103b\u0103u\u021bi, D\u0103nc\u0103u\u021bi and [[Hinc\u0103u\u021bi|Clisc\u0103u\u021bi]], reaching Anadol\u0219 other groups retook Ruc\u0219in and [[Rashkiv|Ra\u0219cov]].<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 24</ref> A [[state of siege]] was imposed in neighboring Bukovina, before troops from there could be marched into Hotin County;<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> \"already on February 1, the insurgent forces were pushed back over the Dniester, and internal rebellions were repressed\".<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, p. 82</ref> A force still answering to the Khotin Directorate was able to cross the Dniester back into Podolia, reportedly \"without losses\".<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 24</ref>\n\nFrom January 28, the intervention was nominally led by [[Nicolae Petala]], who had taken over from Davidoglu. However, he could not be replaced in time, and, with his aide Ressel, was the one to actually take Khotin; they had already received orders to quell any incursion or revolt \"with the greatest violence, including the complete destruction of any [rebel] locality\".<ref>Giurc\u0103, pp. 14\u201315</ref> Davidoglu is therefore widely seen as responsible for the bloody interlude which followed. Although Giurc\u0103 believes that Davidoglu acted \"within the confines of wartime regulations\",<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 15</ref> fellow generals, including [[Ion Antonescu]], criticized his random killing of civilians, noting that it enshrined Romania's negative image as a \"country of savages\".<ref>Popenko, p. 11.

Nicolae Coroiu of the 37th Regiment recalls that Davidoglu informed his soldiers to shoot down any armed homeowners and burn down their houses, then \"dress up in the clothes of the offending parties.\"<ref>Moisa, p. 162</ref> Coroiu recalls however that his troops did not shoot to kill, allowing wounded civilians to flee for safety.<ref>Moisa, p. 162</ref> General [[Constantin Prezan]], [[Chief of the Romanian General Staff]], approved of the violence, having issued orders that the peaceful civilians be protected, whereas \"no pity, no tolerance should be displayed\" toward rebels.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 23</ref> General Schina's initial proclamations called on local Russians and Moldovans to acts as \"Christians and good Romanians [...] for there is no sweeter, gentler and more protective country on this earth than the land of Romanians.\"<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 24</ref> When confronted with reports of rebel atrocities, Schina pressured Davidoglu to \"corral every village, all Bolshevik gangs and rebellious inhabitants\"; if rebel activities continued, he was to set whole localities on fire.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 24</ref>\n\nSt\u0103nescu, relying on \"Romanian military documents\", notes that \"during the aggression they initiated, the Bolsheviks had about 300\u2013400 dead, with several localities whose population had supported them in their actions being destroyed in whole or in part.\"<ref>St\u0103nescu, pp. 24\u201325</ref> Other Romanian military records, republished by Potylchak, boasted that seven rebel villages were burned to the ground, with as many as 5,000 insurgents killed; Potylchak himself counts 22 villages destroyed and 11,000 victims, including arbitrary executions of 165 railwaymen and 500 unarmed civilians.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> He also notes that estimates of 15,000 and higher are probably exaggerated.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209. See also Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, p. 123</ref> The latter claim is qualified in Smele's account: \"Ukrainian sources suggest that [...] at least 15,000 of those who did not flee were slaughtered by the Romanians.\"<ref>Smele, p. 97</ref> Similar numbers are advanced by [[Mikhail Meltyukhov]], who concludes that \"according to official Romanian data, more than 5,000 were killed\", and that \"15,000 people suffered in one form or another\".<ref>Meltyukhov, p. 66</ref> Scholars I. P. Fostoy and V. M. Podlubny also report 160 railway workers being killed, one of them through [[Death by burning|immolation]]. They note that the 11,000 total can be traced to an estimate first publicized by the [[International Red Aid]] in 1925.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 26</ref> Romanian losses, meanwhile, amounted to 369; this includes 159 killed in action, 93 wounded, and a further 117 missing.<ref>Meltyukhov, p. 66; St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref>\n\nSome of murders of civilians are described in Romanian sources. According to Lieutenant Gheorghe Eminescu, his colleague, Captain Mociulschi, shot a railway [[signalman]] held responsible for assisting the partisans with their raid on Ocni\u021ba.<ref>Moisa, p. 162</ref> The measures were observed by McLaren and two other British officers touring the UNR; one of them is identified by St\u0103nescu as Lieutenant Edwin Boxhall of [[Naval Intelligence Division (United Kingdom)|Naval Intelligence]].<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref> According to Giurc\u0103, they favored the UNR and \"Ukrainian Bolshevik troops\", with reports which exaggerated the scale of repression and victimized non-Romanians, in particular Jews caught between the two sides. Petala, who was ordered to investigate Davidoglu, suggested that the McLaren group were of \"doubtful good faith\".<ref>Giurc\u0103, pp. 15\u201317</ref> Likewise, St\u0103nescu reads the British report as a \"complete denaturation\", with \"Bolsheviks\" being depicted as \"victims of Romanian repressions.\"<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref>\n\nInterrogated by the Romanian side, McLaren noted that Khotin had been shelled by the Romanians until a civilian delegation had declared it an [[open city]]. The occupiers, he recalled, had engaged in widespread looting and \"barbaric\" beatings.<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 16</ref> He recalled witnessing one botched execution, in which a suspected robber was left to agonize for hours,<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 16</ref> as well as the shooting of 53 peasants in Ned\u0103b\u0103u\u021bi.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 20\u201325; \u0218ornikov, p. 82</ref> According to his reports, several boys and old men were shot during robberies condoned by Davidoglu, while a man of unspecified age, Nikita Zankovsky, was [[bayonet]]ted in front of his family.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 20\u201325</ref> Similar accounts mention other acts of cruelty, including at Ruc\u0219in, where Major Popescu shot 12 captives after forcing them to dig their own grave, also killing any disabled men he found in civilian homes.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nBy contrast, Coroiu reports that the one robber to be executed in Khotin was a Romanian sergeant, caught looting despite an explicit ban.<ref>Moisa, p. 163</ref> McLaren's account also conflicted with a testimony by Khotin's deposed mayor, who had been imprisoned alongside the British officers. Gachikevich argued that local Jews appreciated the restoration of order, and that Romanians \"caused no harm, other than a few incidents on the city's outskirts.\"<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 17. See also St\u0103nescu, pp. 25\u201326</ref> His report was backed by similar statements from two of Khotin's [[rabbi]]s, Samuel Haiss and Nahiev I\u021bikovici, the former of whom also expressed his thanks in a letter to [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania]].<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 26. See also Giurc\u0103, p. 17</ref> The McLaren issue was escalated to General Prezan, who asked and obtained that the three British envoys be expelled from Bessarabia.<ref>Giurc\u0103, pp. 17\u201318; St\u0103nescu, p. 26</ref>\n\n==Revivals==\n===Raid on Tighina===\n[[File:Former Bender bridge after its destruction in WWI.jpg|thumb|400px|The bridge at [[Bender, Moldova|Tighina]], destroyed by Romanian troops after [[Grigory Kotovsky]]'s raid]]\nOn February 2, guerilla units made a futile attempt to return at Khotin through Atachi, prompting another retaliatory bombardment by Romanian artillery units, which consequently became a systematic response to any perceived agitation.<ref>Potylchak, pp. 209\u2013210</ref> This approach led to conciliatory displays by the UNR. That same day, its representatives issued orders for the returning rebels to disarm, and pledge to assist with the investigation into their activities. Podolia's Commissioner declared his conviction that Romanians had no aggressive intent, and acknowledged that they were justified to be in a \"nervous mood\", with ultimatums as an ultimate \"bluff\".<ref>Potylchak, pp. 211\u2013212</ref> On February 8, Davidoglu's men machine-gunned the urban center of [[Mohyliv-Podilskyi]], killing two.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> Before the end of the month, they destroyed all bridges on the upper Dniester, to ensure that communications between Ukrainian groups were rendered more difficult.<ref>Potylchak, p. 210</ref> While Petala asked to command an expeditionary force that would establish a bridgehead in Podolia, Prezan continued to discuss the matter with UNR authorities, warning them to disarm any groups still hiding on the Dniester.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref>\n\nZhurari's Whites in Tiraspol attempted to provide assistance to the rebels, but moved in too late. In early February, they reportedly acted as negotiators between armed Bolsheviks, led by the Bessarabian [[Grigory Kotovsky]], and the UNR authorities, allowing the latter to withdraw peacefully from Tiraspol.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 82, 83</ref> Kotovsky was then pushed out by French troops of the [[150th Infantry Regiment (France)|58th Infantry Regiment]], and found himself crossing into Bessarabia, where he managed to chase Romanian soldiers out of [[Bender, Moldova|Tighina]].<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 83\u201385</ref> A French\u2013Romanian division-strength force, assisted by the [[Blue Army (Poland)|Polish Blue Army]], stepped in to repel Kotovsky's partisans, and reoccupied Tiraspol. Zhurari's men declared their neutrality, but nevertheless found themselves labeled as enemy troops by the French army command; they then joined the intervention forces and participated in political repression, executing among others the father of Bolshevik leader [[Pavel Tcacenco]].<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 85\u201386</ref>\n\nThe Khotin Uprising coincided with the final stages of the [[Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War|Soviet Russian offensive]] into the UNR's territory, which also led to the establishment of a subordinate [[Ukrainian SSR]]. On January 25, the latter's Premier, [[Christian Rakovsky]], had effectively declared war on Romania by stating a Ukrainian Bolshevik claim to both Bessarabia and Bukovina.<ref>Basciani, pp. 133\u2013134; Meltyukhov, pp. 74\u201375</ref> By contrast, UNR Directors openly rejected \"territorial maximalism\", in hopes to obtain weapons from [[Bucharest]]; these were promised, but never actually arrived.<ref>Stopchak, p. 346</ref> In March 1919, the Directorate moved to [[Husiatyn]], and failed to maintain a grip on Podolia. The area came to be governed by the [[Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] (allegedly answering to [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]]), though military control was resumed after a counter-coup.<ref>Oliynyk, p. 139</ref> In [[Dunaivtsi Raion]], veterans of the Khotin Uprising formed a Bessarabian Brigade, which restated its alliance with Russia and commitment to Bolshevism. It nevertheless refused to do battle against the UNR, and was disarmed by envoys from Husiatyn in early April.<ref>Oliynyk, p. 136</ref>\n\nAs many as 50,000 peasants from around Khotin, and some 4,000 to 10,000 armed rebels, crossed the Dniester, settling in either UNR or Soviet territories.<ref>Potylchak, pp. 209\u2013210. See also Basciani, p. 134; Meltyukhov, p. 66; Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, pp. 122\u2013123</ref> Meanwhile, those refugees who still rejected communism appealed for support from the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]: on February 4, their \"general assembly\" in Zhvanets pleaded with the Entente to demand the immediate withdrawal of Romanian troops from Hotin County.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> Other circles in the Ukraine also embraced the cause. On February 12, the British legation in [[Odessa]] received a letter of protest from a self-proclaimed delegation of Bessarabians, which included S. M. Wolkenstein and H. M. Kudik as Khotin delegates. This text affirmed commitment not the UNR, but to Russia, depicting Romania as an \"invader\", and its culture as \"Asian\".<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2014), p. 150</ref> \n\n[[File:The two stages of Denikin's offensive (Nikolay Pomanskiy).png|thumb|300px|The two stages of [[Advance on Moscow (1919)|Denikin's offensive]], as depicted by the Bolshevik poster artist Nikolay Pomanskiy in 1919]]\nThe [[Red Army]], under [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko]], advanced southwards and [[Ukraine Offensive (1919)|conquered most of Podolia by April]]. The region was incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR; this new regime quickly restored the Bessarabian Brigade, but purged it of political suspects.<ref>Oliynyk, pp. 135, 140\u2013141</ref> During the early days of May, Antonov considered plans for immediately \"freeing Bessarabia\" by invading through Khotin. He was finally dissuaded from ordering it by Romanian successes on the [[Hungarian\u2013Romanian War|Hungarian Front]], and by supply inadequacies.<ref>Meltyukhov, pp. 79\u201381</ref> Ukrainian\u2013Romanian skirmishes continued over several months, just as the Peace Conference began analyzing the eastern borders of [[Greater Romania]]. Atachi's inhabitants remained exceptionally hostile to Romanian rule, and Soviet soldiers felt encouraged to fire on Romanian positions during May 30; suspicions arose in Romanian circles that an \"international battalion\" was being trained to invade Bessarabia from Mohyliv.<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2010), pp. 64\u201365</ref> \n\nRomanians were still pained by echoes of Davidoglu's action, and knew that the Conference could recognize Ukrainian demands in Hotin County. As noted by Ukrainian historian Yaroslav Popenko: \"From the very first days of the conference, Romanian diplomats had been active in arguing that the Khotin Uprising was an attempt by the Bolsheviks to destabilize the country and spread its ideology further into Europe. Against the background of anti-Bolshevik sentiments among the major states, such an 'interpretation' of events was an extremely successful diplomatic and propaganda step.\"<ref>Popenko, p. 11</ref> Popenko also notes that this approach came to be favored by the [[Southern Russia intervention|Allied intervention forces in Russia]], who advised the UNR to settle its border issues with Romania, viewing the latter as the \"final bulwark against Bolshevism\".<ref>Popenko, p. 13</ref>\n\n===VSYuR and ''Zakordot''===\nZhurari sealed a pact with the Red Army and was allowed to leave Tiraspol unharmed; some of his men returned to Bessarabia, while others were admitted into the Red Army. Both groups may have played a part in the Bolshevik attempt to seize Tighina, on May 27, 1919 ''(see [[Bender Uprising]])''.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 86\u201388</ref> Whites, unlike communists, were generally spared by the Romanian Army, but the authorities still intervened when, in June, a ''Polkovnik'' Gagauz was caught preaching revolution to the inhabitants of [[Comrat]].<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 87\u201388</ref> Such agitation largely ceased in June, when the Romanian government allowed N. N. Kozlov and A. A. Gepetskiy to recruit Bessarabian White officers for service in the [[Armed Forces of South Russia]] (VSYuR), which secured a base in Odessa and pushed Antonov's forces out of the region. Various members of the Salvation Committee proposed to [[Anton Denikin]] that they stage instead a takeover of Bessarabia, and Denikin promised to assist them after first \"finish[ing] off\" the UNR.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 88\u201389</ref> In August, [[Konstantyn A. Matsevych]], who served as UNR diplomatic representative in Romania, made a futile effort to reconcile the Directorate with Denikin.<ref>Vlasenko & Guzun, p. 31</ref>\n\nWhile acting as head of the VSYuR counterintelligence in Odessa, Gepetskiy permitted Bolsheviks to assemble, despite Denikin's [[Advance on Moscow (1919)|large-scale offensive into Russia]]. As \u0218ornikov notes, he still prioritized the Bessarabian takeover ahead of all other issues, and effectively had a truce with communist partisans.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 91\u201393, 95</ref> The All-Russian National Center, functioning in the White-held city on [[Rostov-on-Don]], maintained a claim to both Bessarabia and the Ukraine, accusing Romania and the UNR of colluding with each other to partition the area.<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2014), pp. 163\u2013165</ref> Also working under Denikin's watch, N. A. Zelenetskiy began forming the 14th Infantry Division and 14th Artillery Brigade, specifically for the recovery of Bessarabia.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 93</ref> \n\nDenikin's successes also rekindled partisan activity in Podolia. VSYuR's Gagauz was able to recruit some 13,000 veterans from the [[Ukrainian Galician Army]], who were then distributed to garrisons along the Dniester, ostensibly preparing to \"liberate Bessarabia\" upon the end of the [[Russian Civil War]]. In November, following Denikin's [[Orel\u2013Kursk operation|defeat at Orel]], these units were moved to assist against the advancing Red Army.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 93\u201394</ref> Gepetskiy's men were still preparing for an attack on Bessarabia, and collected 12 million rubles for this goal. These were confiscated by Kotovsky and the Red Army, which [[Odessa Operation (1920)|retook Tiraspol without a fight]] in February 1920.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 94\u201395</ref> These units included various veterans of Filipchuk's army in Khotin, including Shynkarenko and M. I. Nyagu, both of whom had command roles.<ref>Fostoy, pp. 595\u2013596</ref> Shynkarenko was later called up to fight the [[Basmachi movement]] in [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkestan]].<ref>Fostoy, p. 596; Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 41</ref>\n\nThe Red Army allowed VSYuR survivors under [[Nikolai Bredov]] to move into [[Nova Ushytsia]], just north of Khotin. They surrendered to the [[Polish Army]], with Romania having repeatedly refused them entry.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 95</ref> From that moment on, the Soviets could form their own networks in Khotin; a Romanian diplomatic cable from June 1920 claims that 200 recruiters for the Red Army were active in the county.<ref>Basciani, pp. 165\u2013166</ref> From October, the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Ukrainian Communist Party]]'s office for foreign infiltration, ''[[Zakordot]]'', took over the task of destabilizing the Romanian presence. By 1921, they had organized a network of small-scale guerilla units, which crossed the Dniester for hit-and-run attacks on Romanian targets.<ref>Meltyukhov, pp. 110\u2013120; Ponomariov, pp. 103, 108\u2013110</ref> ''Zakordot'' raids in mid 1921 resulted in the targeted murders of officials and clergymen in [[Dankivtsi|D\u0103nc\u0103u\u021bi]], [[Hinc\u0103u\u021bi|Poiana]] and [[Rashkiv|Ra\u0219cov]].<ref>Ponomariov, pp. 109\u2013110; Suveic\u0103 (2010), p. 251</ref> These groups also made efforts to find and punish landowner Mo\u0219an, who stood accused of having organized violent retribution after the 1919 uprising. In August 1921, they attacked Mo\u0219an's manor outside [[Stalnivtsi|St\u0103line\u0219ti]], killing several members of his family.<ref>Ponomariov, pp. 109\u2013110</ref> Meanwhile, the anti-communist segment of the Ukrainian diaspora was strengthened by some 400 UNR refugees, some of whom found work at Hotin County's [[sugar mill]].<ref>Vlasenko & Guzun, p. 32</ref>\n\nAhead of the [[1919 Romanian general election|November 1919 elections]], Hotin County became a hub of the [[Bessarabian Peasants' Party]] (P\u021aB), which canvassed among the Jewish and Ukrainian populace. The group was the only one to submit a list, which had support from some 62% of registered voters (an additional 7.6% cast blank votes).<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, pp. 84\u201386</ref> All of the county's first representatives in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]] were P\u021aB members, but represented three distinct ethnicities: [[Daniel Ciugureanu]] stood for the Romanians, Iancu Melic-Melicsohn for the Jews, and Pavel Kitaigorodski for the Ukrainians.<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, pp. 84\u201389</ref> [[Romanian Police]] officials in the region reportedly viewed all Hotin deputies as \"more than suspicious\", in that they endorsed the notion of an autonomous Bessarabia.<ref>Iorga, p. 267</ref>\n\n===Later history===\n[[File:Kotovsky's partisan conference, 1922.png|thumb|440px|Veterans of Kotovsky's Bolshevik partisan units reunited for a conference in Soviet territory, 1922.

Oliynyk]]\nThe UNR was dissolved upon the conclusion of its war with Russia in late 1921, leaving Khotin and Bessarabia to be governed by Romania, directly on its closed border with the [[Soviet Union]]. Prosecution of the 1919 rebels was pursued over several years. Rebels captured before January 23 were treated with more leniency, and made subject to trials by military courts. Examples include Alexei Borodaty and M. V. Bulkat, the latter of whom died in [[Craiova]] prison in 1924.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 25\u201326</ref> B\u0103rbu\u021b\u0103's aide S.

Officials intended to subvert the trend by closing down Russian-language education and enforcing [[Romanianization]].<ref>Basciani, pp. 175\u2013176</ref> During the early 1930s, the region was more heavily impacted by the [[Great Depression]], prompting renewed activities by communist agents, but also agitation the antisemitic [[National-Christian Defense League]].<ref>Basciani, pp. 235\u2013236, 259\u2013260</ref> In May 1933, Vasily Gotinchan attempted to establish a local chapter of the pro-communist [[Ukrainian Workers' Party of Romania|Liberation Party]], but was apprehended and put on trial.<ref>Fostoy, p. 566</ref> A Ukrainian branch of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] was finally set up regionally, with Shulim Abramovich Kryvyi emerging as its chief organizer in 1939.<ref>Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, pp. 58\u201359</ref> In 1938, the [[National Renaissance Front]] regime bid on subverting traditional loyalties in Bessarabia, dividing the region into larger administrative units that straddled old borders into Bukovina and [[Western Moldavia]]. As a result, Hotin County was dissolved, and its territory was assigned to ''[[\u021ainutul Suceava]]''.<ref>Basciani, pp. 342\u2013343</ref> The passage of [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|antisemitic laws]] also came with targeted persecution, including the attempted expulsion of all Jews living in [[Zelena, Kelmentsi Raion|Zelena]].<ref>Basciani, pp. 333\u2013334</ref> \n\nThis episode ended in 1940, as most of Khotin was annexed to the Ukrainian SSR during the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina]]; the core areas of Bessarabia, meanwhile, formed a separate [[Moldavian SSR]]. The border between these two Soviet entities was settled on August 2, 1940 (effectively on November 4), when the southern third of Hotin County was recognized as part of the Moldavian SSR.<ref>Lavric, p. 124. See also Prodanyk, p. 28</ref> The northern regions, which remained under Ukrainian administration, had an Ukrainian plurality of 41.6%,<ref>Lavric, p. 127</ref> and were amalgamated with Bukovinan areas into [[Chernivtsi Oblast]]. As noted by van Meurs, this arrangement was due to Ukrainian officials using their \"political clout\", as a \"strong Ukrainian involvement\" had underpinned the Soviet moves of 1940.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 87\u201388</ref> Approval was obtained from the [[Prime Minister of Moldova|Moldavian SSR Premier]], [[Tihon Konstantinov]], but not from the Moldovan population. This reportedly contradicted fundamental laws of the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian Autonomous Republic]], which were still in place before the passage of a [[Constitution of the Moldavian SSR (1941)|1941 Constitution]].<ref>Lavric, p. 129</ref> \n\nThe Soviet annexation occurred after the [[Great Purge]], which had seen Shynkarenko being sidelined by the Soviets and narrowly escaping execution; several Khotin refugees were shot at that stage by the [[NKVD]], followed by at least 224 new Soviet citizens in 1940\u20131941.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 41\u201342, 44\u201345, 51, 89\u201390.

From September 4, 1941, Hotin County was attached to a Romanian Governorate of Bukovina.<ref>Deletant, pp. 83, 305, 318\u2013319</ref> Shortly before this formal reoccupation, Romanian troops in Atachi tried to [[Holocaust in Romania|expel the entire Jewish population]] from Hotin County into ''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]'', a matter which caused tension between them and [[Nazi Germany]]. More than 1,000 \"slow-moving\" Jews where shot by the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' during the subsequent push-back.<ref>Deletant, pp. 150\u2013151</ref> All surviving returnees were then expelled into camps in [[Transnistria Governorate]], with many more killed by the Romanian Army on the way there.<ref>Deletant, pp. 151\u2013154; Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 75\u201378</ref> The Governorate was also set to welcome the entire Ukrainian and [[Lipovans|Lipovan]] population of Bessarabia, in exchange for any Romanian-speakers on that side.<ref>Achim, pp. 594, 603, 606, 610\u2013611, 614\u2013617</ref> Antonescu and his favorite demographer, [[Sabin Manuil\u0103]], viewed the Dniester as a defensible frontier, but agreed to relinquish northern Hotin and [[Cern\u0103u\u021bi County|Cern\u0103u\u021bi counties]] to a Ukrainian state, in exchange for [[Pokuttya]].<ref>Achim, pp. 601, 604, 611, 616</ref> Ukrainian culture was banned, and its advocates were forced to assimilate or be marginalized.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 77</ref>\n\nUnder the Antonescu regime, [[Soviet partisans|pro-Soviet resistance]] was mounted by the ''[[Komsomol]]'', which attempted sabotage and assassination.

Br\u0103tianu]]: \"not one uprising took place in Bessarabia that was not directly organized and supervised by communist partisans sent in from areas across the Dniester. An attack of some importance took place in late December 1918 {{sic}} and created troubles among the Ruthenian population in Hotin county; Romanian general Poeta\u0219 was killed during these fights. But aside from this insurrection, which had been long in preparation, and supported by gangs moving in from the Ukraine, there was no other movement against the union, which represented the will of an uncontested majority.\"<ref>Br\u0103tianu, p. 146</ref> Br\u0103tianu sees a direct link between the Khotin events and the [[Tatarbunary uprising|1924 rebellion at Tatarbunar]], \"also involving a foreign population.\"<ref>Br\u0103tianu, pp. 165\u2013166</ref> \n\nThe non-communist orientation of at least part of the Uprising was attested as early as 1919 by another Romanian scholar, [[Nicolae Iorga]]. His diaries initially referred to the rebels as \"Bolsheviks\", before noting that they were \"in fact [UNR] soldiers\".<ref>Iorga, pp. 149\u2013150</ref> However, in 1995, St\u0103nescu referred to the Khotin affair as \"orchestrated by the Bolshevik government\", and suggests that all rebel \"commissions and committees\" had \"direct links with the Bolshevik army\".<ref>St\u0103nescu, pp. 22, 25</ref> \n\nPotylchak views Romanian historiography in both the royal period and the [[National communism in Romania|national communism]] of the 1980s as having \"reduce[d] the uprising to solely a 'Bolshevik revolt', and minimize[d] the anti-Ukrainian actions\" undertaken in its wake.<ref>Potylchak, pp. 204, 212\u2013213</ref> In his reading, the quashing of the uprising signified a \"colonial expansion\", to which the UNR could only oppose \"neutrality\", despite being fundamentally sympathetic to the rebels.<ref>Potylchak, p. 212</ref> Potylchak also proposes a critical view of post-Soviet Ukrainian readings of Khotin, in that it fails to account for the popular and spontaneous nature of the struggle and instead overemphasizes Mayevski's alleged contribution.<ref>Potylchak, pp. 204\u2013205</ref> Another Ukrainian scholar, V. Kroytor, is openly critical of the UNR's \"excessively cautious and inconsistent\" behavior in respect to Romanian maneuvers.<ref>Stopchak, p. 346</ref>\n\n[[Soviet historiography]] and [[Moldovenism|Moldovenist]] authors focused on claims that the revolt was indicative of a brewing [[class conflict]], with Romanian authorities depicted as irredeemably [[reactionary]]; as noted by Suveic\u0103, Soviet monographs on the revolt achieved this goal by relying on autobiographical writings contributed by the rebels, and by citing [[Soviet propaganda]] from ca. 1920 as a primary source.<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2010), p. 34</ref> Such reviews also highlighted the connections between Khotin and Tatarbunar, but ascribed them a different meaning, as samples of \"heroic struggle\" by the \"Bessarabian workers.\"<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2010), pp. 34, 65; van Meurs, pp. 289\u2013291</ref> As noted by van Meurs, the proletarian component was spuriously highlighted, and the revolt described as related to the Red Army's clashes with the UNR and the Allied intervention forces. A 1976 monograph advanced the claim that Bolsheviks prepared the revolt to coincide with the Red Army's advance into Podolia, but that they could not control its timing.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 79</ref> These narratives also contradicted themselves in claiming that UNR agents had \"infiltrated the leadership of the revolt\", accounting for its ultimate failure.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 290, 293</ref> Potylchak argues that such sources also distort the truth by arguing that Romanians intervened in order to assist the UNR.<ref>Potylchak, p. 204</ref>\n\nThe earliest author to include Khotin into the Soviet pantheon was Rakovsky, in 1925; his account was expanded upon by Naum Narcov in 1940. Narcov reported the mainstream view, according to which 50,000 peasants had fled into newly conquered Soviet territory during the Romanian backlash, but, as noted by van Meurs, his count was later \"revised as 50,000 casualties.\"<ref>van Meurs, pp. 289, 292\u2013293</ref> Soviet authors then claimed that an additional 30,000 were refugees, and changed the chronological setting to argue that at least some of the flights had taken place before the uprising; this allowed them to claim that any participation from across the Dniester was in fact also Bessarabian, rather than Ukrainian.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 289\u2013290</ref> Within this setting, a dispute ensued between the official historiographers of Soviet Moldavia and Soviet Ukraine, after the former included references to Khotin into Moldavian history textbooks of the early 1950s. Unusually, these commented on the both Khotin and Tatarbunar as \"weak, isolated, ill-prepared, and mismanaged\" uprisings.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 183\u2013184</ref> The standard view was wholly replaced in 1960s works, which depicted Khotin as a \"major revolt\".<ref>van Meurs, pp. 276, 290</ref> In 1970\u20131978, a large-scale effort was made to collect and publish documents on the uprising from the various Soviet archives.<ref>Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, pp. 123\u2013124</ref>\n\nThough present in both Romanian and Soviet interpretations, any claims of Soviet participation in the Khotin revolt are reviewed with skepticism by van Meurs, who notes that the movement was local. He proposes that both the Hotin revolt, and the May 1919 skirmish in Tighina had support from across the Dniester, but that only the latter of the two was Soviet-sponsored.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 76\u201377, 289\u2013291. See also Suveic\u0103 (2010), p. 65</ref> In 2017, Romanian military historian Alexandru Madgearu made a note that, despite being embraced by \"several historians\", any claim that the revolt was Bolshevik-instigated had been proven counterfactual.<ref>Madgearu, p. 17</ref> Kroytor suggests that the UNR's hesitation to assist pushed Khotin rebels to join the [[45th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|45th Rifle Division]] in June 1919\u2014thus effectively contributing to the destruction of Ukrainian independence.<ref>Stopchak, p. 346. See also Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, p. 123</ref> Even under these circumstances, UNR spies, which remained active in Podolia as it fell to the Soviets, reported that the population of Hotin County remained anti-Russian, whereas \"the majority of Bessarabia's population\" was won over by communism.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> The latter claim is partly backed by records of both the ''[[Siguran\u021ba]]'' and the Whites, though these suggest that Bessarabians were generally pro-Russian, rather than specifically Bolshevik.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 88, 89</ref>\n\nHistorian Mitru Ghi\u021biu proposes that any Moldovan resistance to communism was casually silenced by Soviet writers: \"the issue was never even up for discussion, with authorities fearing that any glimpse of the truth could bring into question the Romanian's 'boundless joy' at being 'liberated' by the Bolsheviks.\"<ref>Ghi\u021biu, p. 141</ref> Soviet authors ignored all talk of contributions by the Whites and their Committee for the Salvation of Bessarabia. This connection had already been brought up in 1919 by Major McLaren. In their interviews with Romanian officials, both he and Gachikevich dismissed all accounts of Bolshevik agitation.<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 16</ref> During their stay in Khotin, McLaren and Boxhall had resided with the Krupenskys. According to St\u0103nescu, this was an additional proof of continuity between Russian loyalism and the rebels of 1919, over a shared agenda of \"keeping these territories inside Russia, even if it were a Soviet Russia\".<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref> Researchers of various backgrounds, including \u0218ornikov<ref>\u0218ornikov, ''passim''</ref> and Ludmila Rotari,<ref>Madgearu, p. 17; Suveic\u0103 (2010), p. 65</ref> have returned focus on the rebellion's connection with Russian monarchism. According to \u0218ornikov, the Whites and the communists had maintained the exact same policy on the Bessarabian question, seeing Khotin as an integral component of Russia.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 79</ref> Zhurari had unwittingly served Romanian interests by relocating to Tiraspol, instead of forming his unit in Bessarabia itself, but as \u0218ornikov notes, had later built his force into one highly threatening for the Romanian grip on Bessarabia.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 87\u201388</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Viorel Achim]], \"The Romanian Population Exchange Project Elaborated by Sabin Manuil\u0103 in October 1941\", in ''Annali dell'Istituto Storico Italo-germanico in Trento'', Vol. XXVII, 2001, pp. 593\u2013617.\n*Alberto Basciani, ''La difficile unione.

It occurred on January 7\u2013February 1, 1919, less than a year after [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|Bessarabia's annexation]] by the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]. The city it was centered on is now known as [[Khotyn]] (\u0425\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d), and is located in [[Chernivtsi Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]; in 1919, it was the capital of [[Hotin County]], on the unofficial border between Romania and the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR). The revolt was carried out by armed locals, mainly Ukrainian peasants, assisted by [[Cossack]] deserters from the [[Ukrainian People's Army]] and groups of [[Moldovans]], with some support from local [[Bolsheviks]] and [[White movement|White Russians]]. It forms part of the [[Ukrainian War of Independence]], though whether or not the UNR covertly supported it, beyond formally reneging it, is a matter of dispute. The role of Bolsheviks, which has been traditionally highlighted in Romanian and [[Soviet historiography]] alike, is similarly debated. The Khotin Uprising is therefore ambiguously linked to the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War]].\n\nAfter days of guerilla activities by peasants, a large contingent of trained partisans crossed the [[Dniester]] from UNR territory, and, on January 23, managed to capture the city, creating confusion among [[Romanian Army]] garrisons. This group then formed a \"Directorate\", acting as Khotin's unrecognized government. It aimed to change the status of the county, or of all Bessarabia, ahead of the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919\u20131920|Paris Peace Conference]], but remained internally divided into pro-UNR and pro-Bolshevik factions. Within days, the Directorate was toppled by the returning Romanian Army under General [[Cleante Davidoglu]], which also began a hunt for armed peasants. Critics of the intervention count 11,000 or more as killed during arbitrary shootings and shelling of localities on both banks of the Dniester, with 50,000 expelled. Romanian Army sources acknowledge that the repression was violent, while they may dispute the body count.\n\nParticipants in the revolt were generally alienated by the UNR's inaction, dividing themselves between the [[Red Army]] and the Whites. The Khotin Uprising was closely followed by a [[Bender Uprising|raid on Tighina]], carried out by the Bessarabian Bolshevik [[Grigory Kotovsky]], whose forces came to include Khotin veterans. Such incidents secured Bessarabia for [[Greater Romania]], seen by the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] as a guarantee against communist revolution. In late 1919, the [[Armed Forces of South Russia]], coalescing various White entities, sketched out an attempt to invade Bessarabia, but  [[Odessa Operation (1920)|lost ground to the Red Army]]. The emerging [[Soviet Union]] continued to back partisans in Hotin County during the interwar, until [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina|annexing Bessarabia entirely]] in 1940.\n\n==Background==\n===Before 1918===\nThe Ukrainian claim to Khotin (or Hotin) extends back to the [[Principality of Halych]], with reports that Ukrainians had settled there before the lands fell to the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1301\u20131526)|Hungarian Kingdom]].<ref>Potylchak, p. 205</ref> The city then belonged to the [[Principality of Moldavia]], which [[Foundation of Moldavia|grew out of a Hungarian fief]], before becoming a [[Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire|tributary state]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Imperial Russia]] began its incursions into Moldavia with the [[Pruth River Campaign]] of 1710\u20131711, prompting the Ottomans to annex [[Khotyn Fortress]] and reconstruct the corresponding [[Hotin County]] into a distinct ''[[Raya (country subdivision)|raya]]'' in 1714.<ref>Br\u0103tianu, pp. 53, 63\u201364</ref> The city was finally absorbed into Russia following the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Bucharest Treaty of 1812]], during which time it was recognized by all parties as being distinct from Bessarabia-proper.<ref>Br\u0103tianu, pp. 43, 53\u201354, 63\u201364; Cazacu, pp. 62\u201363</ref> A census conducted five years later reported that 7,000 \"[[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]]\" families had been colonized into the area by Russia.<ref>Br\u0103tianu, pp. 71\u201372</ref> Immigration continued at a steady pace, and was in large part a private enterprise, with hired hands needed for the \"immense estates\" of [[Boyars of Moldavia and Wallachia|Moldo-Bessarabian boyars]].<ref>Cazacu, p. 78</ref> By 1900, Ukrainians were a likely majority of the area's population,<ref>Br\u0103tianu, p. 133; Cazacu, p. 76</ref> although no definitive count exists. According to historian Nicolae Enciu, in 1918 there were 121 all-Ukrainian villages, 52 all-[[Romanians|Romanian]], and 16 mixed.<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, p. 81</ref> Khotin town was populated by [[Bessarabian Jews]], though accounts differ on their number, from a vast majority<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 18</ref> to a fifth of the inhabitants.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 26</ref>\n\nUnder Russian rule, Hotin County was incorporated with the [[Bessarabia Governorate]]. Its assembly, or ''[[Zemstvo]]'', overrepresented [[Russian nobility]], in particular the rival Krupensky and Lisovsky families; in 1900, it was dominated by members of the former, including [[Alexander N. Krupensky]].<ref>Coad\u0103, pp. 214\u2013217</ref> Its control was looser from 1912, when the ''Zemstvo'' presidency went to a [[Romanian nationalist]], Dimitrie A. Ouatul.<ref>Coad\u0103, pp. 243\u2013244</ref> Russian dominance was again being challenged during World War I, when the northern areas of Hotin were a devastated battlefield, along with the neighboring [[Duchy of Bukovina]].<ref>Basciani, pp. 98, 106; Gumen\u00e2i, p. 81</ref> The latter was an extension of [[Austria-Hungary]], which envisioned annexing Khotin upon defeating Russia and Romania.<ref>Ungureanu, p. 121</ref> Following the [[February Revolution]], Ouatul became Commissar for Khotin, appointed by the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. His attempt to reassert control was ineffectual, as previously disenfranchised social groups began forming their own [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] and refusing to abide by central laws.<ref>Cazacu, pp. 186, 194</ref> These decreed the [[Collective farming|socialization]] of all landed estates.<ref>Fostoy, p. 594</ref>\n\nThe Provisional Government fell during the [[November Revolution]], which left Bessarabia and Khotin with an uncertain status. Bessarabia formally reorganized itself into an autonomous [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]] (RDM), headed by the former Russian envoy, [[Ion Incule\u021b]]. Incule\u021b himself noted that the region, including Khotin, needed to be defended from Romanian and Ukrainian separatism, and remain attached to a [[Russian Republic|Russian Federated Republic]]. He cited \"devastation in the land of Hotin\" as one of the main reasons for establishing a regional government.<ref>Cazacu, pp. 232, 250</ref> Ten cohorts of the newly formed [[Armed Forces of the Republic of Moldova|Bessarabian Army]] were ordered to resume control of the region.<ref>Cazacu, p. 250</ref> \n\nAlso newly proclaimed, the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR) maintained friendly relations with the RDM and Romania. [[Prime Minister of Romania|Romanian Premier]] [[Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu]], who still hoped to maintain the [[Romania during World War I|Moldavian Front]] against encroachment by the [[Central Powers]], hoped to bring the new regime to his side.<ref>Cancicov, pp. 204, 225, 259, 266\u2013267, 272</ref> By January 1918, the [[Imperial Russian Army]] spread out along the [[Siret River]] had divided itself into [[Bolsheviks]] and UNR loyalists\u2014the latter helped Romanian authorities by repressing the former.<ref>Cancicov, pp. 266\u2013267, 273\u2013274</ref> The [[Romanian Army]] sought both RDM and UNR approval for its subsequent incursion into Bessarabia, where it helped neutralize Bolshevik centers.<ref>Cancicov, pp. 273\u2013274</ref> In the event, the UNR agreed to recognize the RDM, but made specific claims to Hotin and [[Cetatea Alb\u0103 County|Cetatea Alb\u0103 counties]].<ref>Br\u0103tianu, p. 133. See also Gumen\u00e2i, p. 81</ref> Meanwhile, rival claims on the region were made by both the [[White movement]] and [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], both of which fomented dissent among local Ukrainians.<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, p. 81</ref> \n\nIn the [[1917 Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii election|elections of November 1917]], UNR opponents in Hotin County had chosen [[Nicolae Bosie-Codreanu]], [[Nicolae Cern\u0103u\u021beanu]], and [[Constantin Iurcu]] as its delegates to the Bessarabian people's assembly, or ''[[Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii]]''.<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, pp. 80\u201381. See also Cazacu, pp. 240\u2013242</ref> A UNR diplomat, [[Otto Eichelmann]], argued that there were no Hotin representatives on show in March 1918, when this legislature voted in favor of [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|union with Romania]];<ref>Iorga, p. 28</ref> nevertheless, ''Sfatul'' resolutions made specific reference to unified Bessarabia as extending \"from Hotin to [[Izmail|Ismail]]\".<ref>Cazacu, pp. 307\u2013309</ref> Following the [[Operation Faustschlag|Eleven Days' War]] against [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], the [[Central Powers]], including Austria, could impose these borders on their defeated adversaries. The Romanian presence in Bessarabia, which coincided with the start of a working alliance between the UNR and the Central Powers, stood as a \"clue that [Romanians] too are out of the war with the Central Powers.\"<ref>Cancicov, p. 286</ref> Trilateral peace negotiations began in February, when Austria announced Romanian diplomats that Bessarabia question was largely irrelevant to the Central Powers: \"the [Bessarabian] question is to be solved directly between Romania, which occupies it militarily, and the Ukrainian and Moldavian republics\".<ref>Cancicov, p. 321</ref>\n\n===Austrian\u2013Romanian\u2013Ukrainian dispute===\n[[File:Hotin issue, 1918.svg|thumb|400px|Map of the Hotin issue in 1918]]\nOn March 3, the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest]] effectively meant that the UNR renounced its claims in northern Bessarabia to Austria.<ref>Cancicov, pp. 406, 409, 447; Ungureanu, p. 130</ref> Hotin County was occupied by the [[Royal Hungarian Honv\u00e9d]], on behalf of Austria, that same month. Hungarians controlled the county down to (and including) [[Ocni\u021ba]], as well as the northern extremity of [[Soroca County (Romania)|Soroca County]]; under the terms of an armistice, the Romanian Army held on to the remaining areas, including 8 villages in Hotin.<ref>Dubitska, p. 65. See also Meltyukhov, pp. 44\u201345, 52\u201353</ref> UNR\u2013Romanian relations grew more hostile in early April, when rumors emerged that the Ukrainian side had formally protested against the Romanian presence in Bessarabia.<ref>Cancicov, pp. 405\u2013406, 408\u2013409</ref> \n\nIn early May, a new Romanian government, headed by [[Alexandru Marghiloman]], agreed to sign [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|peace with the Central Powers]]. Although Marghiloman went into the negotiations promising that \"under no circumstances would we lose Hotin\",<ref>Cancicov, p. 436</ref> the act ceded 600 [[square kilometer]]s of land to Austrian Bukovina, including parts of the county, alongside the neighboring [[Hertsa region]].<ref>Ungureanu, pp. 129\u2013130, 134</ref> Under the resulting regime, parts of Hotin that were either annexed or occupied by Austria were exploited, as a breadbasket for the peoples of Austria-Hungary. This tactic, which was enforced with Marghiloman's acquiescence,<ref>Meltyukhov, pp. 52\u201353</ref> led to severe shortages by June 1918. Within months, the Hungarian military administration dissolved all soviets and offices answering to the [[Central Council of Ukraine]], only delegating authority to the reestablished ''Zemstvo''.<ref>Dubitska, pp. 67\u201369</ref> Faced with such constraints, local Ukrainians began organizing into partisan units.<ref>Fostoy, pp. 594\u2013595; Potylchak, p. 208</ref> \n\nIn April, the UNR itself was replaced by a more Austrian- and White-friendly regime, the [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]], which made some efforts to extend itself into Hotin County and the \"four parishes\" of Soroca. A branch of the Ukrainian Army, including a 2nd Cavalry Division under Commandant Kolesnikov, was established in Khotin, whose civilian authorities argued that Marghiloman had willingly renounced his claims to the area.<ref>Rusnak ''et al.''. pp. 40\u201341</ref> On May 26, judge Oleksa Suharenko was appointed Khotin's ''[[Starosta]]'' by authorities from the [[Podolian Governorate]], situated across the [[Dniester]]; he never took charge, as he was soon replaced by a P. Izbytskyi. The Austrian authorities ultimately consented to Izbytskyi's arrival, but stripped him of any real power.<ref>Rusnak ''et al.''. pp. 40\u201341</ref> By July 1918, Romanians grew alarmed about reports that Hetmanate representatives, including [[Oleksander Shulhyn]], were seeking to annex Bessarabia in its entirety.<ref>Iorga, pp. 29, 43</ref>\n\nIn November 1918, [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Germany's armistice]] changed the course of politics in the region. The unification of Bessarabia with Romania became effective the same month, when regional autonomy was dissolved. In Hotin County, control had remained notional until late autumn: on October 22, 1918, a majority of the ''Zemstvo'' voted in favor of the county's reunification with Russia,<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 17</ref> voicing their fear that the Romanian Army's presence in Bessarabia would end with annexation.<ref>Potylchak, p. 206</ref> As his final act in government, Marghiloman ordered his troops to take Hotin and Bukovina, together.<ref>Cazacu, p. 331</ref> The 1st Romanian Cavalry Division, part of the [[Fifth Army (Romania)|Fifth Army]], moved into the former region; it was spearheaded by the 3rd [[Ro\u0219iori (military unit)|Redcoats]] Regiment and the 40th Infantry Regiment, both of which were placed under General [[Cleante Davidoglu]].<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 14.

See also Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 19; Meltyukhov, p. 60; St\u0103nescu, p. 22</ref> Soon after taking over, the Romanian garrison was joined by the 3rd Border Guards Regiment, responding to \"alarmist claims\" about \"Bolshevik\" concentrations on the Dniester.<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 14</ref> A one-kilometer exclusion zone was enforced around the city, food was requisitioned, and the population was ordered to hand in all weapons and ammunition.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 19\u201320; Meltyukhov, p. 60</ref> Davidoglu also announced the swift and exemplary execution of a man from [[Lipcani]] \"who incited the soldiers to Bolshevism\".<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 19</ref> The incursion also touched [[Mohyliv-Podilskyi]], on the Dniester's left bank, pacified by Romanian troops by request of the Ukrainian mission in [[Bucharest]].<ref>Iorga, pp. 108, 122</ref> On November 20, Izbytskyi registered his protest with General Davidoglu and Redcoats Colonel Gheorghe Moruzzi, reaffirming his belief that Khotin city was a \"territory of the Ukrainian state\". He had by then been ordered to leave the county, and was issuing his official acts from across the river, in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]].<ref>Rusnak ''et al.'', p. 41</ref> In his own proclamation from Khotin, Davidoglu insisted that \"Bessarabia was a Romanian province until 1812, and it remains Romanian land today and forever\", warning those who disagreed with him that they could leave for Podolia.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 20</ref>\n\nIn December, the UNR was reestablished, and its leaders resumed their observation of Romanian activities in Hotin County. Its [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] heard reports according to which \"all peasant, provincial, county and even district congresses\" supported the notion that Khotin belonged in a [[Greater Ukraine]].<ref>Potylchak, pp. 205\u2013206</ref> UNR sources describe late 1918 as marked by a \"terror policy\", including \"shootings of mostly innocent people, the torture of women, children and the elderly, looting, bullying and violence against women [and] a broad system of denunciation\".<ref>Potylchak, pp. 206\u2013207</ref> Ukrainian peasants on the Romanian side of the border were additionally troubled by the newly adopted [[Land reform in Romania|land reform legislation]], which returned some land to owners that local soviets had dispossessed, and made other plots subject to ransom.<ref>Potylchak, p. 207</ref> \n\nReports by UNR Podolian officials noted that by December \"gangs of [[Moldovans]]\", assisted by the Ukrainians of [[Stara Ushytsia]], made random attacks on Romanian border guards across the Dniester. Following one such killing, Romanian artillery shelled Stara Ushytsia on December 24.<ref>Potylchak, p. 207</ref> UNR officials initially agreed with Davidoglu that these were \"bandit\" raids. They became reluctant when Romanians presented them with an ultimatum to hand in those responsible, and were further alienated when Romanian troops beat up an UNR border guard at [[Zhvanets]].<ref>Potylchak, pp. 207\u2013208, 210</ref> However, on January 5, they refused to acknowledge an appeal by the \"Bessarabian National Union\", which asked for intervention in support of Hotin County refugees.<ref>Stopchak, p. 346</ref> Instead, Khotin's inhabitants found support from the Committee for the Salvation of Bessarabia, which reunited [[Russian nationalism|Russian nationalists]] associated with the Whites. With funds received from the [[Volunteer Army]], ''[[Polkovnik]]'' Zhurari began the training of guerillas at [[Tiraspol]].<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 80\u201381</ref>\n\n==Unfolding==\n[[File:Ignacy Pawe\u0142 Fudakowski - Most na Dniestrze w \u017bwa\u0144cu na Podolu (94-111-3).jpg|thumb|400px|[[Zhvanets]] and wooden bridge over the [[Dniester]], seen from [[Ataky|Atachi]] (1915 photograph)]]\nAccording to [[Transnistria]]n academic [[Piotr \u0218ornikov]], Zhurari and his Committee planned for the rebellion to ignite just before the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919\u20131920|Paris Peace Conference]], which was to analyze the issue of Bessarabia and Khotin.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 82</ref> Romanian rule was still consolidating<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, p. 81</ref> when the armed rebellion began.

Historian Ion Gumen\u00e2i sees him as an actual commander of the rebel troops;<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, p. 81</ref> a similar verdict was advanced by a collective of authors from the State Archives of [[Chernivtsi]], who suggest that Mayevski distributed arms to the Bessarabian Directorate.<ref>Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, p. 122</ref> Potylchak favorably quotes academic and UNR political figure [[Dmytro Doroshenko]] denying that the revolt had any assistance from Mayevski.<ref>Potylchak, p. 208</ref> \n\nScholar Jonathan Smele argues that the UNR, \"at a critical point of the [[Soviet\u2013Ukrainian War]], could not afford to become embroiled in conflict with Romania\".<ref>Smele, p. 97</ref> An explicit order from the UNR General Staff banned the Podolia Army Corps from intervening to assist the uprising.<ref>Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, pp. 123\u2013124</ref> In his memoirs, however, Doroshenko hints that the UNR's 60th Infantry Regiment was moved to Zhvanets specifically in order to help the rebel expedition, or at least to cover its retreat in case of a Romanian counterattack.<ref>Oliynyk, p. 135</ref> St\u0103nescu claims that the UNA directly assisted the rebels with constructing a makeshift bridge at Ocni\u021ba.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 23</ref> Major M.

Their reaction was not registered by the Romanian Army, who responded by capturing 16 [[Free Cossacks]] from Tiraspol as hostages.<ref>Potylchak, p. 211</ref>\n\n==Violent repression==\nOverall, Liskun's incursion was quickly rejected by the returning Romanian Army. In the early stages of the rebellion, it acted out on its previous warnings, repeatedly shelling the Podolian villages of [[Nahoriany]] and [[Kozliv, Mohyliv-Podilskyi|Kozliv]].<ref>Potylchak, pp. 208, 210</ref> During this interval, Davidoglu's troops were joined by various units, including the entire 37th Infantry Regiment, which moved from [[Bac\u0103u]] to Noua Suli\u021b\u0103, and the machine-gunners of [[B\u0103l\u021bi]].<ref>Moisa, pp. 160\u2013162; St\u0103nescu, p. 24</ref> On January 28\u201330, the regrouped units, under Colonel Victor Tomoroveanu, forced rebels out of Noua Suli\u021b\u0103, Ned\u0103b\u0103u\u021bi, D\u0103nc\u0103u\u021bi and [[Hinc\u0103u\u021bi|Clisc\u0103u\u021bi]], reaching Anadol\u0219 other groups retook Ruc\u0219in and [[Rashkiv|Ra\u0219cov]].<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 24</ref> A [[state of siege]] was imposed in neighboring Bukovina, before troops from there could be marched into Hotin County;<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> \"already on February 1, the insurgent forces were pushed back over the Dniester, and internal rebellions were repressed\".<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, p. 82</ref> A force still answering to the Khotin Directorate was able to cross the Dniester back into Podolia, reportedly \"without losses\".<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 24</ref>\n\nFrom January 28, the intervention was nominally led by [[Nicolae Petala]], who had taken over from Davidoglu. However, he could not be replaced in time, and, with his aide Ressel, was the one to actually take Khotin; they had already received orders to quell any incursion or revolt \"with the greatest violence, including the complete destruction of any [rebel] locality\".<ref>Giurc\u0103, pp. 14\u201315</ref> Davidoglu is therefore widely seen as responsible for the bloody interlude which followed. Although Giurc\u0103 believes that Davidoglu acted \"within the confines of wartime regulations\",<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 15</ref> fellow generals, including [[Ion Antonescu]], criticized his random killing of civilians, noting that it enshrined Romania's negative image as a \"country of savages\".<ref>Popenko, p. 11. See also Meltyukhov, pp. 65\u201365; \u0218ornikov, p. 86</ref> \n\nSome such reports concentrate on looting, since Romanian troops were generally ill-prepared for a wintertime action, lacking any winter clothing. Nicolae Coroiu of the 37th Regiment recalls that Davidoglu informed his soldiers to shoot down any armed homeowners and burn down their houses, then \"dress up in the clothes of the offending parties.\"<ref>Moisa, p. 162</ref> Coroiu recalls however that his troops did not shoot to kill, allowing wounded civilians to flee for safety.<ref>Moisa, p. 162</ref> General [[Constantin Prezan]], [[Chief of the Romanian General Staff]], approved of the violence, having issued orders that the peaceful civilians be protected, whereas \"no pity, no tolerance should be displayed\" toward rebels.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 23</ref> General Schina's initial proclamations called on local Russians and Moldovans to acts as \"Christians and good Romanians [...] for there is no sweeter, gentler and more protective country on this earth than the land of Romanians.\"<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 24</ref> When confronted with reports of rebel atrocities, Schina pressured Davidoglu to \"corral every village, all Bolshevik gangs and rebellious inhabitants\"; if rebel activities continued, he was to set whole localities on fire.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 24</ref>\n\nSt\u0103nescu, relying on \"Romanian military documents\", notes that \"during the aggression they initiated, the Bolsheviks had about 300\u2013400 dead, with several localities whose population had supported them in their actions being destroyed in whole or in part.\"<ref>St\u0103nescu, pp. 24\u201325</ref> Other Romanian military records, republished by Potylchak, boasted that seven rebel villages were burned to the ground, with as many as 5,000 insurgents killed; Potylchak himself counts 22 villages destroyed and 11,000 victims, including arbitrary executions of 165 railwaymen and 500 unarmed civilians.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> He also notes that estimates of 15,000 and higher are probably exaggerated.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209. See also Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, p. 123</ref> The latter claim is qualified in Smele's account: \"Ukrainian sources suggest that [...] at least 15,000 of those who did not flee were slaughtered by the Romanians.\"<ref>Smele, p. 97</ref> Similar numbers are advanced by [[Mikhail Meltyukhov]], who concludes that \"according to official Romanian data, more than 5,000 were killed\", and that \"15,000 people suffered in one form or another\".<ref>Meltyukhov, p. 66</ref> Scholars I. P. Fostoy and V. M. Podlubny also report 160 railway workers being killed, one of them through [[Death by burning|immolation]]. They note that the 11,000 total can be traced to an estimate first publicized by the [[International Red Aid]] in 1925.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 26</ref> Romanian losses, meanwhile, amounted to 369; this includes 159 killed in action, 93 wounded, and a further 117 missing.<ref>Meltyukhov, p. 66; St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref>\n\nSome of murders of civilians are described in Romanian sources. According to Lieutenant Gheorghe Eminescu, his colleague, Captain Mociulschi, shot a railway [[signalman]] held responsible for assisting the partisans with their raid on Ocni\u021ba.<ref>Moisa, p. 162</ref> The measures were observed by McLaren and two other British officers touring the UNR; one of them is identified by St\u0103nescu as Lieutenant Edwin Boxhall of [[Naval Intelligence Division (United Kingdom)|Naval Intelligence]].<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref> According to Giurc\u0103, they favored the UNR and \"Ukrainian Bolshevik troops\", with reports which exaggerated the scale of repression and victimized non-Romanians, in particular Jews caught between the two sides. Petala, who was ordered to investigate Davidoglu, suggested that the McLaren group were of \"doubtful good faith\".<ref>Giurc\u0103, pp. 15\u201317</ref> Likewise, St\u0103nescu reads the British report as a \"complete denaturation\", with \"Bolsheviks\" being depicted as \"victims of Romanian repressions.\"<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref>\n\nInterrogated by the Romanian side, McLaren noted that Khotin had been shelled by the Romanians until a civilian delegation had declared it an [[open city]]. The occupiers, he recalled, had engaged in widespread looting and \"barbaric\" beatings.<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 16</ref> He recalled witnessing one botched execution, in which a suspected robber was left to agonize for hours,<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 16</ref> as well as the shooting of 53 peasants in Ned\u0103b\u0103u\u021bi.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 20\u201325; \u0218ornikov, p. 82</ref> According to his reports, several boys and old men were shot during robberies condoned by Davidoglu, while a man of unspecified age, Nikita Zankovsky, was [[bayonet]]ted in front of his family.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 20\u201325</ref> Similar accounts mention other acts of cruelty, including at Ruc\u0219in, where Major Popescu shot 12 captives after forcing them to dig their own grave, also killing any disabled men he found in civilian homes.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nBy contrast, Coroiu reports that the one robber to be executed in Khotin was a Romanian sergeant, caught looting despite an explicit ban.<ref>Moisa, p. 163</ref> McLaren's account also conflicted with a testimony by Khotin's deposed mayor, who had been imprisoned alongside the British officers. Gachikevich argued that local Jews appreciated the restoration of order, and that Romanians \"caused no harm, other than a few incidents on the city's outskirts.\"<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 17. See also St\u0103nescu, pp. 25\u201326</ref> His report was backed by similar statements from two of Khotin's [[rabbi]]s, Samuel Haiss and Nahiev I\u021bikovici, the former of whom also expressed his thanks in a letter to [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania]].<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 26. See also Giurc\u0103, p. 17</ref> The McLaren issue was escalated to General Prezan, who asked and obtained that the three British envoys be expelled from Bessarabia.<ref>Giurc\u0103, pp. 17\u201318; St\u0103nescu, p. 26</ref>\n\n==Revivals==\n===Raid on Tighina===\n[[File:Former Bender bridge after its destruction in WWI.jpg|thumb|400px|The bridge at [[Bender, Moldova|Tighina]], destroyed by Romanian troops after [[Grigory Kotovsky]]'s raid]]\nOn February 2, guerilla units made a futile attempt to return at Khotin through Atachi, prompting another retaliatory bombardment by Romanian artillery units, which consequently became a systematic response to any perceived agitation.<ref>Potylchak, pp. 209\u2013210</ref> This approach led to conciliatory displays by the UNR. That same day, its representatives issued orders for the returning rebels to disarm, and pledge to assist with the investigation into their activities. Podolia's Commissioner declared his conviction that Romanians had no aggressive intent, and acknowledged that they were justified to be in a \"nervous mood\", with ultimatums as an ultimate \"bluff\".<ref>Potylchak, pp. 211\u2013212</ref> On February 8, Davidoglu's men machine-gunned the urban center of [[Mohyliv-Podilskyi]], killing two.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> Before the end of the month, they destroyed all bridges on the upper Dniester, to ensure that communications between Ukrainian groups were rendered more difficult.<ref>Potylchak, p. 210</ref> While Petala asked to command an expeditionary force that would establish a bridgehead in Podolia, Prezan continued to discuss the matter with UNR authorities, warning them to disarm any groups still hiding on the Dniester.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref>\n\nZhurari's Whites in Tiraspol attempted to provide assistance to the rebels, but moved in too late. In early February, they reportedly acted as negotiators between armed Bolsheviks, led by the Bessarabian [[Grigory Kotovsky]], and the UNR authorities, allowing the latter to withdraw peacefully from Tiraspol.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 82, 83</ref> Kotovsky was then pushed out by French troops of the [[150th Infantry Regiment (France)|58th Infantry Regiment]], and found himself crossing into Bessarabia, where he managed to chase Romanian soldiers out of [[Bender, Moldova|Tighina]].<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 83\u201385</ref> A French\u2013Romanian division-strength force, assisted by the [[Blue Army (Poland)|Polish Blue Army]], stepped in to repel Kotovsky's partisans, and reoccupied Tiraspol. Zhurari's men declared their neutrality, but nevertheless found themselves labeled as enemy troops by the French army command; they then joined the intervention forces and participated in political repression, executing among others the father of Bolshevik leader [[Pavel Tcacenco]].<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 85\u201386</ref>\n\nThe Khotin Uprising coincided with the final stages of the [[Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War|Soviet Russian offensive]] into the UNR's territory, which also led to the establishment of a subordinate [[Ukrainian SSR]]. On January 25, the latter's Premier, [[Christian Rakovsky]], had effectively declared war on Romania by stating a Ukrainian Bolshevik claim to both Bessarabia and Bukovina.<ref>Basciani, pp. 133\u2013134; Meltyukhov, pp. 74\u201375</ref> By contrast, UNR Directors openly rejected \"territorial maximalism\", in hopes to obtain weapons from [[Bucharest]]; these were promised, but never actually arrived.<ref>Stopchak, p. 346</ref> In March 1919, the Directorate moved to [[Husiatyn]], and failed to maintain a grip on Podolia. The area came to be governed by the [[Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] (allegedly answering to [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]]), though military control was resumed after a counter-coup.<ref>Oliynyk, p. 139</ref> In [[Dunaivtsi Raion]], veterans of the Khotin Uprising formed a Bessarabian Brigade, which restated its alliance with Russia and commitment to Bolshevism. It nevertheless refused to do battle against the UNR, and was disarmed by envoys from Husiatyn in early April.<ref>Oliynyk, p. 136</ref>\n\nAs many as 50,000 peasants from around Khotin, and some 4,000 to 10,000 armed rebels, crossed the Dniester, settling in either UNR or Soviet territories.<ref>Potylchak, pp. 209\u2013210. See also Basciani, p. 134; Meltyukhov, p. 66; Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, pp. 122\u2013123</ref> Meanwhile, those refugees who still rejected communism appealed for support from the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]: on February 4, their \"general assembly\" in Zhvanets pleaded with the Entente to demand the immediate withdrawal of Romanian troops from Hotin County.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> Other circles in the Ukraine also embraced the cause. On February 12, the British legation in [[Odessa]] received a letter of protest from a self-proclaimed delegation of Bessarabians, which included S. M. Wolkenstein and H. M. Kudik as Khotin delegates. This text affirmed commitment not the UNR, but to Russia, depicting Romania as an \"invader\", and its culture as \"Asian\".<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2014), p. 150</ref> \n\n[[File:The two stages of Denikin's offensive (Nikolay Pomanskiy).png|thumb|300px|The two stages of [[Advance on Moscow (1919)|Denikin's offensive]], as depicted by the Bolshevik poster artist Nikolay Pomanskiy in 1919]]\nThe [[Red Army]], under [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko]], advanced southwards and [[Ukraine Offensive (1919)|conquered most of Podolia by April]]. The region was incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR; this new regime quickly restored the Bessarabian Brigade, but purged it of political suspects.<ref>Oliynyk, pp. 135, 140\u2013141</ref> During the early days of May, Antonov considered plans for immediately \"freeing Bessarabia\" by invading through Khotin. He was finally dissuaded from ordering it by Romanian successes on the [[Hungarian\u2013Romanian War|Hungarian Front]], and by supply inadequacies.<ref>Meltyukhov, pp. 79\u201381</ref> Ukrainian\u2013Romanian skirmishes continued over several months, just as the Peace Conference began analyzing the eastern borders of [[Greater Romania]]. Atachi's inhabitants remained exceptionally hostile to Romanian rule, and Soviet soldiers felt encouraged to fire on Romanian positions during May 30; suspicions arose in Romanian circles that an \"international battalion\" was being trained to invade Bessarabia from Mohyliv.<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2010), pp. 64\u201365</ref> \n\nRomanians were still pained by echoes of Davidoglu's action, and knew that the Conference could recognize Ukrainian demands in Hotin County. As noted by Ukrainian historian Yaroslav Popenko: \"From the very first days of the conference, Romanian diplomats had been active in arguing that the Khotin Uprising was an attempt by the Bolsheviks to destabilize the country and spread its ideology further into Europe. Against the background of anti-Bolshevik sentiments among the major states, such an 'interpretation' of events was an extremely successful diplomatic and propaganda step.\"<ref>Popenko, p. 11</ref> Popenko also notes that this approach came to be favored by the [[Southern Russia intervention|Allied intervention forces in Russia]], who advised the UNR to settle its border issues with Romania, viewing the latter as the \"final bulwark against Bolshevism\".<ref>Popenko, p. 13</ref>\n\n===VSYuR and ''Zakordot''===\nZhurari sealed a pact with the Red Army and was allowed to leave Tiraspol unharmed; some of his men returned to Bessarabia, while others were admitted into the Red Army. Both groups may have played a part in the Bolshevik attempt to seize Tighina, on May 27, 1919 ''(see [[Bender Uprising]])''.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 86\u201388</ref> Whites, unlike communists, were generally spared by the Romanian Army, but the authorities still intervened when, in June, a ''Polkovnik'' Gagauz was caught preaching revolution to the inhabitants of [[Comrat]].<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 87\u201388</ref> Such agitation largely ceased in June, when the Romanian government allowed N. N. Kozlov and A. A. Gepetskiy to recruit Bessarabian White officers for service in the [[Armed Forces of South Russia]] (VSYuR), which secured a base in Odessa and pushed Antonov's forces out of the region. Various members of the Salvation Committee proposed to [[Anton Denikin]] that they stage instead a takeover of Bessarabia, and Denikin promised to assist them after first \"finish[ing] off\" the UNR.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 88\u201389</ref> In August, [[Konstantyn A. Matsevych]], who served as UNR diplomatic representative in Romania, made a futile effort to reconcile the Directorate with Denikin.<ref>Vlasenko & Guzun, p. 31</ref>\n\nWhile acting as head of the VSYuR counterintelligence in Odessa, Gepetskiy permitted Bolsheviks to assemble, despite Denikin's [[Advance on Moscow (1919)|large-scale offensive into Russia]]. As \u0218ornikov notes, he still prioritized the Bessarabian takeover ahead of all other issues, and effectively had a truce with communist partisans.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 91\u201393, 95</ref> The All-Russian National Center, functioning in the White-held city on [[Rostov-on-Don]], maintained a claim to both Bessarabia and the Ukraine, accusing Romania and the UNR of colluding with each other to partition the area.<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2014), pp. 163\u2013165</ref> Also working under Denikin's watch, N. A. Zelenetskiy began forming the 14th Infantry Division and 14th Artillery Brigade, specifically for the recovery of Bessarabia.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 93</ref> \n\nDenikin's successes also rekindled partisan activity in Podolia. VSYuR's Gagauz was able to recruit some 13,000 veterans from the [[Ukrainian Galician Army]], who were then distributed to garrisons along the Dniester, ostensibly preparing to \"liberate Bessarabia\" upon the end of the [[Russian Civil War]]. In November, following Denikin's [[Orel\u2013Kursk operation|defeat at Orel]], these units were moved to assist against the advancing Red Army.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 93\u201394</ref> Gepetskiy's men were still preparing for an attack on Bessarabia, and collected 12 million rubles for this goal. These were confiscated by Kotovsky and the Red Army, which [[Odessa Operation (1920)|retook Tiraspol without a fight]] in February 1920.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 94\u201395</ref> These units included various veterans of Filipchuk's army in Khotin, including Shynkarenko and M. I. Nyagu, both of whom had command roles.<ref>Fostoy, pp. 595\u2013596</ref> Shynkarenko was later called up to fight the [[Basmachi movement]] in [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkestan]].<ref>Fostoy, p. 596; Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 41</ref>\n\nThe Red Army allowed VSYuR survivors under [[Nikolai Bredov]] to move into [[Nova Ushytsia]], just north of Khotin. They surrendered to the [[Polish Army]], with Romania having repeatedly refused them entry.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 95</ref> From that moment on, the Soviets could form their own networks in Khotin; a Romanian diplomatic cable from June 1920 claims that 200 recruiters for the Red Army were active in the county.<ref>Basciani, pp. 165\u2013166</ref> From October, the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Ukrainian Communist Party]]'s office for foreign infiltration, ''[[Zakordot]]'', took over the task of destabilizing the Romanian presence. By 1921, they had organized a network of small-scale guerilla units, which crossed the Dniester for hit-and-run attacks on Romanian targets.<ref>Meltyukhov, pp. 110\u2013120; Ponomariov, pp. 103, 108\u2013110</ref> ''Zakordot'' raids in mid 1921 resulted in the targeted murders of officials and clergymen in [[Dankivtsi|D\u0103nc\u0103u\u021bi]], [[Hinc\u0103u\u021bi|Poiana]] and [[Rashkiv|Ra\u0219cov]].<ref>Ponomariov, pp. 109\u2013110; Suveic\u0103 (2010), p. 251</ref> These groups also made efforts to find and punish landowner Mo\u0219an, who stood accused of having organized violent retribution after the 1919 uprising. In August 1921, they attacked Mo\u0219an's manor outside [[Stalnivtsi|St\u0103line\u0219ti]], killing several members of his family.<ref>Ponomariov, pp. 109\u2013110</ref> Meanwhile, the anti-communist segment of the Ukrainian diaspora was strengthened by some 400 UNR refugees, some of whom found work at Hotin County's [[sugar mill]].<ref>Vlasenko & Guzun, p. 32</ref>\n\nAhead of the [[1919 Romanian general election|November 1919 elections]], Hotin County became a hub of the [[Bessarabian Peasants' Party]] (P\u021aB), which canvassed among the Jewish and Ukrainian populace. The group was the only one to submit a list, which had support from some 62% of registered voters (an additional 7.6% cast blank votes).<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, pp. 84\u201386</ref> All of the county's first representatives in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]] were P\u021aB members, but represented three distinct ethnicities: [[Daniel Ciugureanu]] stood for the Romanians, Iancu Melic-Melicsohn for the Jews, and Pavel Kitaigorodski for the Ukrainians.<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, pp. 84\u201389</ref> [[Romanian Police]] officials in the region reportedly viewed all Hotin deputies as \"more than suspicious\", in that they endorsed the notion of an autonomous Bessarabia.<ref>Iorga, p. 267</ref>\n\n===Later history===\n[[File:Kotovsky's partisan conference, 1922.png|thumb|440px|Veterans of Kotovsky's Bolshevik partisan units reunited for a conference in Soviet territory, 1922.

Oliynyk]]\nThe UNR was dissolved upon the conclusion of its war with Russia in late 1921, leaving Khotin and Bessarabia to be governed by Romania, directly on its closed border with the [[Soviet Union]]. Prosecution of the 1919 rebels was pursued over several years. Rebels captured before January 23 were treated with more leniency, and made subject to trials by military courts. Examples include Alexei Borodaty and M. V. Bulkat, the latter of whom died in [[Craiova]] prison in 1924.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 25\u201326</ref> B\u0103rbu\u021b\u0103's aide S.

Officials intended to subvert the trend by closing down Russian-language education and enforcing [[Romanianization]].<ref>Basciani, pp. 175\u2013176</ref> During the early 1930s, the region was more heavily impacted by the [[Great Depression]], prompting renewed activities by communist agents, but also agitation the antisemitic [[National-Christian Defense League]].<ref>Basciani, pp. 235\u2013236, 259\u2013260</ref> In May 1933, Vasily Gotinchan attempted to establish a local chapter of the pro-communist [[Ukrainian Workers' Party of Romania|Liberation Party]], but was apprehended and put on trial.<ref>Fostoy, p. 566</ref> A Ukrainian branch of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] was finally set up regionally, with Shulim Abramovich Kryvyi emerging as its chief organizer in 1939.<ref>Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, pp. 58\u201359</ref> In 1938, the [[National Renaissance Front]] regime bid on subverting traditional loyalties in Bessarabia, dividing the region into larger administrative units that straddled old borders into Bukovina and [[Western Moldavia]]. As a result, Hotin County was dissolved, and its territory was assigned to ''[[\u021ainutul Suceava]]''.<ref>Basciani, pp. 342\u2013343</ref> The passage of [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|antisemitic laws]] also came with targeted persecution, including the attempted expulsion of all Jews living in [[Zelena, Kelmentsi Raion|Zelena]].<ref>Basciani, pp. 333\u2013334</ref> \n\nThis episode ended in 1940, as most of Khotin was annexed to the Ukrainian SSR during the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina]]; the core areas of Bessarabia, meanwhile, formed a separate [[Moldavian SSR]]. The border between these two Soviet entities was settled on August 2, 1940 (effectively on November 4), when the southern third of Hotin County was recognized as part of the Moldavian SSR.<ref>Lavric, p. 124. See also Prodanyk, p. 28</ref> The northern regions, which remained under Ukrainian administration, had an Ukrainian plurality of 41.6%,<ref>Lavric, p. 127</ref> and were amalgamated with Bukovinan areas into [[Chernivtsi Oblast]]. As noted by van Meurs, this arrangement was due to Ukrainian officials using their \"political clout\", as a \"strong Ukrainian involvement\" had underpinned the Soviet moves of 1940.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 87\u201388</ref> Approval was obtained from the [[Prime Minister of Moldova|Moldavian SSR Premier]], [[Tihon Konstantinov]], but not from the Moldovan population.

From September 4, 1941, Hotin County was attached to a Romanian Governorate of Bukovina.<ref>Deletant, pp. 83, 305, 318\u2013319</ref> Shortly before this formal reoccupation, Romanian troops in Atachi tried to [[Holocaust in Romania|expel the entire Jewish population]] from Hotin County into ''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]'', a matter which caused tension between them and [[Nazi Germany]]. More than 1,000 \"slow-moving\" Jews where shot by the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' during the subsequent push-back.<ref>Deletant, pp. 150\u2013151</ref> All surviving returnees were then expelled into camps in [[Transnistria Governorate]], with many more killed by the Romanian Army on the way there.<ref>Deletant, pp. 151\u2013154; Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 75\u201378</ref> The Governorate was also set to welcome the entire Ukrainian and [[Lipovans|Lipovan]] population of Bessarabia, in exchange for any Romanian-speakers on that side.<ref>Achim, pp. 594, 603, 606, 610\u2013611, 614\u2013617</ref> Antonescu and his favorite demographer, [[Sabin Manuil\u0103]], viewed the Dniester as a defensible frontier, but agreed to relinquish northern Hotin and [[Cern\u0103u\u021bi County|Cern\u0103u\u021bi counties]] to a Ukrainian state, in exchange for [[Pokuttya]].<ref>Achim, pp. 601, 604, 611, 616</ref> Ukrainian culture was banned, and its advocates were forced to assimilate or be marginalized.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 77</ref>\n\nUnder the Antonescu regime, [[Soviet partisans|pro-Soviet resistance]] was mounted by the ''[[Komsomol]]'', which attempted sabotage and assassination.

Br\u0103tianu]]: \"not one uprising took place in Bessarabia that was not directly organized and supervised by communist partisans sent in from areas across the Dniester. An attack of some importance took place in late December 1918 {{sic}} and created troubles among the Ruthenian population in Hotin county; Romanian general Poeta\u0219 was killed during these fights. But aside from this insurrection, which had been long in preparation, and supported by gangs moving in from the Ukraine, there was no other movement against the union, which represented the will of an uncontested majority.\"<ref>Br\u0103tianu, p. 146</ref> Br\u0103tianu sees a direct link between the Khotin events and the [[Tatarbunary uprising|1924 rebellion at Tatarbunar]], \"also involving a foreign population.\"<ref>Br\u0103tianu, pp. 165\u2013166</ref> \n\nThe non-communist orientation of at least part of the Uprising was attested as early as 1919 by another Romanian scholar, [[Nicolae Iorga]]. His diaries initially referred to the rebels as \"Bolsheviks\", before noting that they were \"in fact [UNR] soldiers\".<ref>Iorga, pp. 149\u2013150</ref> However, in 1995, St\u0103nescu referred to the Khotin affair as \"orchestrated by the Bolshevik government\", and suggests that all rebel \"commissions and committees\" had \"direct links with the Bolshevik army\".<ref>St\u0103nescu, pp. 22, 25</ref> \n\nPotylchak views Romanian historiography in both the royal period and the [[National communism in Romania|national communism]] of the 1980s as having \"reduce[d] the uprising to solely a 'Bolshevik revolt', and minimize[d] the anti-Ukrainian actions\" undertaken in its wake.<ref>Potylchak, pp. 204, 212\u2013213</ref> In his reading, the quashing of the uprising signified a \"colonial expansion\", to which the UNR could only oppose \"neutrality\", despite being fundamentally sympathetic to the rebels.<ref>Potylchak, p. 212</ref> Potylchak also proposes a critical view of post-Soviet Ukrainian readings of Khotin, in that it fails to account for the popular and spontaneous nature of the struggle and instead overemphasizes Mayevski's alleged contribution.<ref>Potylchak, pp. 204\u2013205</ref> Another Ukrainian scholar, V. Kroytor, is openly critical of the UNR's \"excessively cautious and inconsistent\" behavior in respect to Romanian maneuvers.<ref>Stopchak, p. 346</ref>\n\n[[Soviet historiography]] and [[Moldovenism|Moldovenist]] authors focused on claims that the revolt was indicative of a brewing [[class conflict]], with Romanian authorities depicted as irredeemably [[reactionary]]; as noted by Suveic\u0103, Soviet monographs on the revolt achieved this goal by relying on autobiographical writings contributed by the rebels, and by citing [[Soviet propaganda]] from ca. 1920 as a primary source.<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2010), p. 34</ref> Such reviews also highlighted the connections between Khotin and Tatarbunar, but ascribed them a different meaning, as samples of \"heroic struggle\" by the \"Bessarabian workers.\"<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2010), pp. 34, 65; van Meurs, pp. 289\u2013291</ref> As noted by van Meurs, the proletarian component was spuriously highlighted, and the revolt described as related to the Red Army's clashes with the UNR and the Allied intervention forces. A 1976 monograph advanced the claim that Bolsheviks prepared the revolt to coincide with the Red Army's advance into Podolia, but that they could not control its timing.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 79</ref> These narratives also contradicted themselves in claiming that UNR agents had \"infiltrated the leadership of the revolt\", accounting for its ultimate failure.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 290, 293</ref> Potylchak argues that such sources also distort the truth by arguing that Romanians intervened in order to assist the UNR.<ref>Potylchak, p. 204</ref>\n\nThe earliest author to include Khotin into the Soviet pantheon was Rakovsky, in 1925; his account was expanded upon by Naum Narcov in 1940. Narcov reported the mainstream view, according to which 50,000 peasants had fled into newly conquered Soviet territory during the Romanian backlash, but, as noted by van Meurs, his count was later \"revised as 50,000 casualties.\"<ref>van Meurs, pp. 289, 292\u2013293</ref> Soviet authors then claimed that an additional 30,000 were refugees, and changed the chronological setting to argue that at least some of the flights had taken place before the uprising; this allowed them to claim that any participation from across the Dniester was in fact also Bessarabian, rather than Ukrainian.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 289\u2013290</ref> Within this setting, a dispute ensued between the official historiographers of Soviet Moldavia and Soviet Ukraine, after the former included references to Khotin into Moldavian history textbooks of the early 1950s. Unusually, these commented on the both Khotin and Tatarbunar as \"weak, isolated, ill-prepared, and mismanaged\" uprisings.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 183\u2013184</ref> The standard view was wholly replaced in 1960s works, which depicted Khotin as a \"major revolt\".<ref>van Meurs, pp. 276, 290</ref> In 1970\u20131978, a large-scale effort was made to collect and publish documents on the uprising from the various Soviet archives.<ref>Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, pp. 123\u2013124</ref>\n\nThough present in both Romanian and Soviet interpretations, any claims of Soviet participation in the Khotin revolt are reviewed with skepticism by van Meurs, who notes that the movement was local. He proposes that both the Hotin revolt, and the May 1919 skirmish in Tighina had support from across the Dniester, but that only the latter of the two was Soviet-sponsored.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 76\u201377, 289\u2013291. See also Suveic\u0103 (2010), p. 65</ref> In 2017, Romanian military historian Alexandru Madgearu made a note that, despite being embraced by \"several historians\", any claim that the revolt was Bolshevik-instigated had been proven counterfactual.<ref>Madgearu, p. 17</ref> Kroytor suggests that the UNR's hesitation to assist pushed Khotin rebels to join the [[45th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|45th Rifle Division]] in June 1919\u2014thus effectively contributing to the destruction of Ukrainian independence.<ref>Stopchak, p. 346. See also Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, p. 123</ref> Even under these circumstances, UNR spies, which remained active in Podolia as it fell to the Soviets, reported that the population of Hotin County remained anti-Russian, whereas \"the majority of Bessarabia's population\" was won over by communism.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> The latter claim is partly backed by records of both the ''[[Siguran\u021ba]]'' and the Whites, though these suggest that Bessarabians were generally pro-Russian, rather than specifically Bolshevik.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 88, 89</ref>\n\nHistorian Mitru Ghi\u021biu proposes that any Moldovan resistance to communism was casually silenced by Soviet writers: \"the issue was never even up for discussion, with authorities fearing that any glimpse of the truth could bring into question the Romanian's 'boundless joy' at being 'liberated' by the Bolsheviks.\"<ref>Ghi\u021biu, p. 141</ref> Soviet authors ignored all talk of contributions by the Whites and their Committee for the Salvation of Bessarabia. This connection had already been brought up in 1919 by Major McLaren. In their interviews with Romanian officials, both he and Gachikevich dismissed all accounts of Bolshevik agitation.<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 16</ref> During their stay in Khotin, McLaren and Boxhall had resided with the Krupenskys. According to St\u0103nescu, this was an additional proof of continuity between Russian loyalism and the rebels of 1919, over a shared agenda of \"keeping these territories inside Russia, even if it were a Soviet Russia\".<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref> Researchers of various backgrounds, including \u0218ornikov<ref>\u0218ornikov, ''passim''</ref> and Ludmila Rotari,<ref>Madgearu, p. 17; Suveic\u0103 (2010), p. 65</ref> have returned focus on the rebellion's connection with Russian monarchism. According to \u0218ornikov, the Whites and the communists had maintained the exact same policy on the Bessarabian question, seeing Khotin as an integral component of Russia.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 79</ref> Zhurari had unwittingly served Romanian interests by relocating to Tiraspol, instead of forming his unit in Bessarabia itself, but as \u0218ornikov notes, had later built his force into one highly threatening for the Romanian grip on Bessarabia.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 87\u201388</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Viorel Achim]], \"The Romanian Population Exchange Project Elaborated by Sabin Manuil\u0103 in October 1941\", in ''Annali dell'Istituto Storico Italo-germanico in Trento'', Vol. XXVII, 2001, pp. 593\u2013617.\n*Alberto Basciani, ''La difficile unione.
