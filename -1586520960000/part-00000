Some Magyars (Hungarians), left behind during the main migration to the [[Pannonian plain|Pannonian basin]], still lived on the banks of the upper [[Volga]] (it is believed by some that the descendants of this group are the modern-day [[Bashkirs]], although this people now speaks a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language, not Magyar). In 1237 a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]], [[Friar Julian|Julianus]], set off on an expedition to lead them back, and was sent back to King B\u00e9la with a letter from [[Batu Khan]]. In this letter, Batu called upon the Hungarian king to surrender his kingdom unconditionally to the [[Tatar]] forces or face complete destruction. B\u00e9la did not reply, and two more messages were later delivered to Hungary. The first, in 1239, was sent by the defeated [[Cumans|Cuman]] tribes, who asked for and received asylum in Hungary. The second was sent in February 1241 from Poland which was facing an invasion from another Mongol force.\n\n===Cuman refugees===\nFollowing their defeat in 1239 soon after the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']], many Cuman-Kipchak peoples were driven from their steppe further west or south. One such tribe was that of Khan [[K\u00f6ten]]. According to Rogerius, K\u00f6ten led a group consisting of 40,000 ''familias'' (a Latin phrase with multiple meanings) into Hungary. Some historians interpret this as K\u00f6ten's tribe consisting of 40,000 families, though as pointed out by Hungarian historian Andr\u00e1s P\u00e1l\u00f3czi-Horv\u00e1th the land the Cumans were expected to settle on could only support 17,000 families, suggesting K\u00f6ten led 40,000 people in total.<ref>Salagean, p. 16</ref><ref>Nora Berend. \"At the Gate of Christendom: Jews, Muslims and 'Pagans' in Medieval Hungary.\" Page 71.</ref> K\u00f6ten sought asylum in the nearby kingdom of Hungary; the king responded that they could do so as long as the Cumans would convert to Catholicism and acknowledge him as their overlord, providing military service.<ref>Salagean, p.15</ref>\n\nK\u00f6ten agreed to B\u00e9la's conditions, promising to convert to Christianity and fight the Mongols (referred to as \"Tatars\" by the Hungarians).<ref>Cartledge, p. 29</ref> The king promptly gave them leave to settle in the plains along the [[Tisza River]]. However the Cumans, used to a nomadic and raid-based lifestyle, did not get on well with the sedentary population of Hungary. Many cases of robbery and rape were reported with Cumans as the perpetrators; B\u00e9la often refused to punish these transgressions, as he was reluctant to start a conflict with the Cumans, especially when he was already expecting a Mongol invasion. Townspeople also accused the Cumans of being agents of the Mongols.<ref>Cartledge, p. 29-30.</ref>\n\n===Hungarian preparations===\n\n==Invasion==\nFive separate Mongol armies invaded Hungary in 1241. The main army under Batu and Subutai crossed through the [[Verecke Pass]]. The army of [[Qadan]] and [[B\u00fcri]] crossed through the [[Tihu\u021ba Pass]]. Two smaller forces under B\u00f6chek and the ''[[noyan]]'' Bogutai entered Hungar from the southeast. The army that had [[First Mongol invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] under [[Orda Khan|Orda]] and [[Baidar]] invaded Hungary from the northwest.{{sfn|Jackson|2005|pp=63\u201364}}\n\n===Transylvania===\n====Brass\u00f3====\n====Nagyszeben====\n\n===Hungary===\n====Mohi====\n{{main|Battle of Mohi}}\n\n====Pest====\n====Esztergom====\n{{main|Siege of Esztergom (1241)}}\n\n===Croatia===\n\n==Mongol withdrawal==\n{{for|the withdrawal from Dalmatia|Mongol invasion of Bulgaria and Serbia}}\nDuring the summer and autumn of 1241, most of the Mongol forces were resting on the Hungarian Plain. In late March, 1242, they began to withdraw. The most common reason given for this withdrawal is the Great Khan [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]]'s death on December 11, 1241, which supposedly forced the Mongols to retreat to Mongolia so that the princes of the blood could be present for the election of a new great khan. This is attested to by one primary source: the chronicle of [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], who after visiting the Mongol court, stated that the Mongols withdrew for this reason; he further stated that [[God]] had caused the Great Khan's death to protect Latin Christendom.<ref>John of Plano Carpini, \u201cHistory of the Mongols,\u201d in The Mission to Asia, ed. Christopher Dawson (London:Sheed and Ward, 1955), 44</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid Al-Din]], a high minister and historian of the Mongol [[Ilkhanate]], specifically states that Batu did not know about Ogedei's death when he decided to withdraw. He states that they withdrew from Hungary to put down a Cuman rebellion, and then left Europe later in 1242 because they felt they had completed their mission, not because of the influence of any outside force.<ref>7 Rashid al-Din, \"Successors of Genghis Khan\", trans. John Boyle 1971, p. 70-71: \"The princes, proceeding by these five routes, seized all the territories of the Bashgh'ird, Majar, and Sas [all refer to the Hungarians], and put their king, Keler [Bela], to flight. They spent the summer on the Tisa [Tisza] and Tanha rivers. Qadan now took the field with an army, captured the territories of the Taqut (Croatians), Arbaraq (Serbs), and Asraf (Vlachs), and pursued Keler, the king of those countries, to the seacoast. When [Keler] embarked on a ship, Qadan turned back... The news of Qa'an's (Ogodei's) death had not yet reached them...  In the autumn they returned and passed into the region of Temur-Qahalqa (Caucasus)...  they proceeded thither and defeated the Qipchaq (Kipchak/Cumans), who had fled to that region... In the beginning of the taulai yil, that is, the Year of the Hare, corresponding to the months of the year 640/1242, having completed the task of conquering the country, they turned back.\"</ref> Rashid had access to the official Mongol history when writing the Ilkhanate's history ([[Altan Debter]]); additionally as historian John Andrew Boyle points out, the section where Rashid addresses the Mongol withdrawal from central Europe contains orthography that indicates he took this version of the events directly from earlier Mongol records.<ref>Rashid al-Din, Successors, 10-11. Translated by John Andrew Boyle. Boyle's preamble notes: \"There are not infrequent interpolations from the Mongolian chronicle, and he even adopts its faulty chronology, in accordance with which the events of the European campaign take place a year later than in reality. In the present volume, Juvaini is down to the reign of Mongke (1251-1259) Rashid al-Din's main authority, but with considerable additional material from other sources. Thus the earlier historian's account of the invasion of eastern Europe (1241-1242) is repeated almost verbatim and is then followed, in a later chapter, by a much more detailed version of the same events, based, like the preceding description of the campaigns in Russia (1237-1240), on Mongol records, as is evident from the orthography of the proper names.\"</ref> By Carpini's account, a messenger would have to be able to make the journey from Mongolia to Central Europe in a little over 3 months in the middle of winter. Carpini himself accompanied a Mongol party in a much shorter journey (from Kiev to Mongolia) during the summer and fall of 1246, where the party \"made great speed\" in order to reach the election ceremony in time, and made use of several horses per person while riding nearly all day and night. It took five months.<ref>Carpini, \u201cHistory of the Mongols,\u201d 60.</ref> The ''[[History of Yuan]]'' does not mention any particular reason for the withdrawal, but does note that Batu did not seek to attend a kurultai at all, and was only convinced to attend by Subutai in the year 1244, long after he had left Hungary.<ref>\"Journal of the North-China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\" Volume 10, page 168. Translated excerpt from the Yuanshi: \"After the death of Ogotai, a great meeting of all the princes was convoked, in the year 1243. Batu refused to go, when Subutai persuaded him, saying:\u2014'You are now the eldest among the princes; it is not wise to refuse.' Batu accordingly left next year to attend the meeting.\"</ref>\n \t\nThe true reasons for the Mongol withdrawal are not fully known, but numerous plausible explanations exist. The Mongol invasion had bogged down into a series of costly and frustrating sieges, where they gained little loot and ran into stiff resistance. They had lost a large number of men despite their victories (see above). Finally, they were stretched thin in the European theater, and were experiencing a rebellion by the [[Cumans]] in what is now southern Russia, and the [[Caucasus]] (Batu returned to put it down, and spent roughly a year doing so).<ref>Rashid al-Din, Successors, 71\u201372.</ref> Another theory relates to Europe's weather: Hungary has a high water table and floods easily. An analysis of tree rings by modern researchers has found that Hungary had a cold wet winter in early 1242 (contributing to the famine), which likely turned Hungary's central plain into a huge swamp. Lacking pastures for their horses, the Mongols would have had to fall back to Russia in search of better grasslands.<ref>Nicola Di Cosmo and Ulf Bungten. \"Climactic and environmental aspects of the Mongol withdrawal from Hungary in 1242 CE.\" nature.com. Published 26 May 2016.</ref>\n\nRegardless of their reasons, the Mongols had completely withdrawn from Central Europe by mid-1242, though they still launched military operations in the west at this time, most notably the 1241\u20131243 [[Mongol invasion of Anatolia]].<ref>J. J. Saunders, The History of the Mongol Conquests (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1971), 79.</ref> After the withdrawal of the Mongol troops, Subutai was reassigned by Guyuk to engage the [[Southern Song]], and died of old age in 1248.\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Devastation of Hungary===\nThe effects of the Mongol invasion were tremendous in the kingdom of the Hungary. The worst damage was incurred on the plains regions, where 50-80% of settlements were destroyed.<ref>Peter F. Sugar, P\u00e9ter Han\u00e1k, Tibor Frank -- A History of Hungary. Page 28.</ref> The combination of massacres perpetrated by the Mongols, the famines induced by their foraging, and the simultaneous devastation of the countryside by the fleeing Cumans resulted in an estimated loss of 15-25% of Hungary's population, some 300,000-500,000 people in total.<ref>Sugar, p.27: \"In the plains, between 50 and 80 percent of the settlements were destroyed. In forested areas, in the mountains, and in Transylvania, the demographic loss is estimated at 25-30 percent\".</ref> The only places that held in the face of Mongol assaults were approximately eighty fortified places, including all of the few stone castles in the kingdom. Among these places were Esztergom, [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]], and the Pannonhalma Archabbey.<ref>Makkai, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 (1994a). \"Transformation into a Western-type state, 1196\u20131301\".

None of them were willing to provide significant support to Hungary, either during or after the invasion. Pope Gregory XI called a Crusade against the Mongols, wrote to numerous German princes telling them to gather their forces, and ordered the clergy to give refuge to the Hungarian king and his subjects should they seek refuge from the Mongols. However, he warned the Hungarian king that help was unlikely to materialize as long as the Holy Roman Emperor remained belligerent and in conflict with the church.<ref>Jackson, pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nHis prediction was ultimately correct, as the Holy Roman Empire (HRE) took little part in fighting the Mongols, bar repelling minor scouting parties in Bohemia, Moravia, Bavaria, and Austria. Emperor Frederick II, in his warning letter to Christiandom, grimly assessed the situation but also tried to use it as leverage over the Papacy.<ref>Matthew Paris, 341-344.</ref> However, Frederick was well aware of the threat they posed. Even before the Pope's summons, Emperor Frederick II and his son, Conrad IV, called a Landfrieden throughout Germany. Conrad ordered the magnates to levy their armies, while Frederick II ordered them to strengthen their defenses.<ref>Jackson, pp. 66\u201367</ref> The states of the Holy Roman Empire intended to bog the Mongols down laying siege to thousands of castles and fortified towns and fighting thousands of small sallying forces, rather than riding out to meet the Mongols in one large field battle as the Hungarians and Poles had done. A letter written by Emperor Frederick II, found in the Regesta Imperii, dated to June 20, 1241 and intended for all his vassals in Swabia, Austria, and Bohemia, included a number of specific military instructions. His forces were to avoid engaging the Mongols in field battles, hoard all food stocks in every fortress and stronghold, and arm all possible levies as well as the general populace.<ref>\nRegesta Imperii, (RI V) n. 3210, http://regesten.regesta-imperii.de/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717102325/http://regesten.regesta-imperii.de/ |date=2009-07-17 }}\n</ref> Duke Frederick of Austria paid to have Austria's border castles strengthened at his own expense.<ref>Master Roger, Epistle, 195</ref> In Bohemia king Wenceslaus I had every castle strengthened and provisioned, as well as providing soldiers and armaments to monasteries in order to turn them into refuges for the civilian population.<ref>Harold T. Cheshire, \u201cThe Great Tartar Invasion of Europe,\u201d The Slavonic Review 5 (1926): 97.</ref> In the end these preparations were unnecessary, as the Mongols never launched a full-scale invasion of the Holy Roman Empire. There were Mongol raids and sieges in the HRE border states in the aftermath of their victories in Poland and Hungary, in which Frederick's instructions seemed to have been followed, but these were minor affairs and quickly abandoned.<ref>Howorth, Sir Henry Hoyle.

During the second half of 1242, following the Mongol withdrawal,\nthe Hungarians mustered their remaining troops and invaded the disputed counties. They would be fought over infrequently for the next four years, until the [[Battle of the Leitha River]], where Frederick's death resulted in the counties being ceded to Hungary.<ref>\u00c9rszegi, G\u00e9za; Solymosi, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 (1981). \"Az \u00c1rp\u00e1dok kir\u00e1lys\u00e1ga, 1000\u20131301 [The Monarchy of the \u00c1rp\u00e1ds, 1000\u20131301]\".

Within a year of the withdrawal of the Mongols, the three westernmost counties ([[Moson]], [[Sopron]], and [[Vas]]) that were extorted as ransom by Duke Frederick of Austria were recaptured, and a local uprising in [[Slavonia]] was quashed. In the decades following, the khans of the Golden Horde would repeatedly demand submission from Hungary- for example, Berke demanded once in 1259 and again in 1264 that Hungary become part of his empire and contribute its army to his planned invasion of central Europe in exchange for tax exemption and a share of the plunder- but were always ignored.<ref>Jean W. Sedlar, East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000\u20131500 (Seattle: University of Washington Press), 379.</ref> The threat of another Mongol invasion, this time taken seriously, was the source of national unity and provided the impetus for B\u00e9la IV's extensive expansion of Hungarian defenses, especially the building of new stone castles (forty-four in the first ten years) and the revitalization of the army, including expanding the number of heavily armoured cavalry and knights in the royal army. B\u00e9la IV is seen now as a second founder of the nation, partly in recognition of all that was done during his reign to reconstruct and fortify the country against foreign invasion from the east. These improvements were to pay off in 1285 when [[Nogai Khan]] [[Second Mongol invasion of Hungary|attempted an invasion of the country]] (raids along the frontier had been frequent in the intervening years, but Nogai's attack was the first major invasion since 1242). In that event, the invasion was defeated quickly,<ref>Kosztolnyik, Z. J., pp. 284\u201387</ref> as were a number of other attacks before and after.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lament for the Destruction of Hungary by the Tartars]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Cartledge, Bryan (2011).

Some Magyars (Hungarians), left behind during the main migration to the [[Pannonian plain|Pannonian basin]], still lived on the banks of the upper [[Volga]] (it is believed by some that the descendants of this group are the modern-day [[Bashkirs]], although this people now speaks a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language, not Magyar). In 1237 a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]], [[Friar Julian|Julianus]], set off on an expedition to lead them back, and was sent back to King B\u00e9la with a letter from [[Batu Khan]]. In this letter, Batu called upon the Hungarian king to surrender his kingdom unconditionally to the [[Tatar]] forces or face complete destruction. B\u00e9la did not reply, and two more messages were later delivered to Hungary. The first, in 1239, was sent by the defeated [[Cumans|Cuman]] tribes, who asked for and received asylum in Hungary. The second was sent in February 1241 from Poland which was facing an invasion from another Mongol force.\n\n===Cuman refugees===\nFollowing their defeat in 1239 soon after the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']], many Cuman-Kipchak peoples were driven from their steppe further west or south. One such tribe was that of Khan [[K\u00f6ten]]. According to Rogerius, K\u00f6ten led a group consisting of 40,000 ''familias'' (a Latin phrase with multiple meanings) into Hungary. Some historians interpret this as K\u00f6ten's tribe consisting of 40,000 families, though as pointed out by Hungarian historian Andr\u00e1s P\u00e1l\u00f3czi-Horv\u00e1th the land the Cumans were expected to settle on could only support 17,000 families, suggesting K\u00f6ten led 40,000 people in total.<ref>Salagean, p. 16</ref><ref>Nora Berend. \"At the Gate of Christendom: Jews, Muslims and 'Pagans' in Medieval Hungary.\" Page 71.</ref> K\u00f6ten sought asylum in the nearby kingdom of Hungary; the king responded that they could do so as long as the Cumans would convert to Catholicism and acknowledge him as their overlord, providing military service.<ref>Salagean, p.15</ref> \n\nK\u00f6ten agreed to B\u00e9la's conditions, promising to convert to Christianity and fight the Mongols (referred to as \"Tatars\" by the Hungarians).<ref>Cartledge, p. 29</ref> The king promptly gave them leave to settle in the plains along the [[Tisza River]]. However the Cumans, used to a nomadic and raid-based lifestyle, did not get on well with the sedentary population of Hungary. Many cases of robbery and rape were reported with Cumans as the perpetrators; B\u00e9la often refused to punish these transgressions, as he was reluctant to start a conflict with the Cumans, especially when he was already expecting a Mongol invasion. Townspeople also accused the Cumans of being agents of the Mongols.<Ref>Cartledge, p. 29-30.</ref>\n\n===Hungarian preparations===\n==Invasion==\nFive separate Mongol armies invaded Hungary in 1241. The main army under Batu and Subutai crossed through the [[Verecke Pass]]. The army of [[Qadan]] and [[B\u00fcri]] crossed through the [[Tihu\u021ba Pass]]. Two smaller forces under B\u00f6chek and the ''[[noyan]]'' Bogutai entered Hungar from the southeast.

In late March, 1242, they began to withdraw. The most common reason given for this withdrawal is the Great Khan [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]]'s death on December 11, 1241, which supposedly forced the Mongols to retreat to Mongolia so that the princes of the blood could be present for the election of a new great khan. This is attested to by one primary source: the chronicle of [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], who after visiting the Mongol court, stated that the Mongols withdrew for this reason; he further stated that [[God]] had caused the Great Khan's death to protect Latin Christendom.<ref>John of Plano Carpini, \u201cHistory of the Mongols,\u201d in The Mission to Asia, ed. Christopher Dawson (London:Sheed and Ward, 1955), 44</ref> \n\nHowever, [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid Al-Din]], a high minister and historian of the Mongol [[Ilkhanate]], specifically states that Batu did not know about Ogedei's death when he decided to withdraw. He states that they withdrew from Hungary to put down a Cuman rebellion, and then left Europe later in 1242 because they felt they had completed their mission, not because of the influence of any outside force.<ref>7 Rashid al-Din, \"Successors of Genghis Khan\", trans. John Boyle 1971, p. 70-71: \"The princes, proceeding by these five routes, seized all the territories of the Bashgh'ird, Majar, and Sas [all refer to the Hungarians], and put their king, Keler [Bela], to flight. They spent the summer on the Tisa [Tisza] and Tanha rivers. Qadan now took the field with an army, captured the territories of the Taqut (Croatians), Arbaraq (Serbs), and Asraf (Vlachs), and pursued Keler, the king of those countries, to the seacoast. When [Keler] embarked on a ship, Qadan turned back... The news of Qa'an's (Ogodei's) death had not yet reached them...  In the autumn they returned and passed into the region of Temur-Qahalqa (Caucasus)...  they proceeded thither and defeated the Qipchaq (Kipchak/Cumans), who had fled to that region... In the beginning of the taulai yil, that is, the Year of the Hare, corresponding to the months of the year 640/1242, having completed the task of conquering the country, they turned back.\"</ref> Rashid had access to the official Mongol history when writing the Ilkhanate's history ([[Altan Debter]]); additionally as historian John Andrew Boyle points out, the section where Rashid addresses the Mongol withdrawal from central Europe contains orthography that indicates he took this version of the events directly from earlier Mongol records.<Ref>Rashid al-Din, Successors, 10-11. Translated by John Andrew Boyle. Boyle's preamble notes: \"There are not infrequent interpolations from the Mongolian chronicle, and he even adopts its faulty chronology, in accordance with which the events of the European campaign take place a year later than in reality. In the present volume, Juvaini is down to the reign of Mongke (1251-1259) Rashid al-Din's main authority, but with considerable additional material from other sources. Thus the earlier historian's account of the invasion of eastern Europe (1241-1242) is repeated almost verbatim and is then followed, in a later chapter, by a much more detailed version of the same events, based, like the preceding description of the campaigns in Russia (1237-1240), on Mongol records, as is evident from the orthography of the proper names.\"</ref> By Carpini's account, a messenger would have to be able to make the journey from Mongolia to Central Europe in a little over 3 months in the middle of winter. Carpini himself accompanied a Mongol party in a much shorter journey (from Kiev to Mongolia) during the summer and fall of 1246, where the party \"made great speed\" in order to reach the election ceremony in time, and made use of several horses per person while riding nearly all day and night. It took five months. <ref>Carpini, \u201cHistory of the Mongols,\u201d 60.</ref> The ''[[History of Yuan]]'' does not mention any particular reason for the withdrawal, but does note that Batu did not seek to attend a kurultai at all, and was only convinced to attend by Subutai in the year 1244, long after he had left Hungary.<Ref>\"Journal of the North-China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\" Volume 10, page 168. Translated excerpt from the Yuanshi: \"After the death of Ogotai, a great meeting of all the princes was convoked, in the year 1243. Batu refused to go, when Subutai persuaded him, saying:\u2014'You are now the eldest among the princes; it is not wise to refuse.' Batu accordingly left next year to attend the meeting.\"</ref>\n \t\nThe true reasons for the Mongol withdrawal are not fully known, but numerous plausible explanations exist. The Mongol invasion had bogged down into a series of costly and frustrating sieges, where they gained little loot and ran into stiff resistance. They had lost a large number of men despite their victories (see above). Finally, they were stretched thin in the European theater, and were experiencing a rebellion by the [[Cumans]] in what is now southern Russia, and the [[Caucasus]] (Batu returned to put it down, and spent roughly a year doing so).<ref>Rashid al-Din, Successors, 71\u201372.</ref> Another theory relates to Europe's weather: Hungary has a high water table and floods easily. An analysis of tree rings by modern researchers has found that Hungary had a cold wet winter in early 1242 (contributing to the famine), which likely turned Hungary\u2019s central plain into a huge swamp. Lacking pastures for their horses, the Mongols would have had to fall back to Russia in search of better grasslands.<ref>Nicola Di Cosmo and Ulf Bungten. \"Climactic and environmental aspects of the Mongol withdrawal from Hungary in 1242 CE.\" nature.com. Published 26 May 2016.</ref>\n\nRegardless of their reasons, the Mongols had completely withdrawn from Central Europe by mid-1242, though they still launched military operations in the west at this time, most notably the 1241\u20131243 [[Mongol invasion of Anatolia]].<ref>J. J. Saunders, The History of the Mongol Conquests (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1971), 79.</ref> After the withdrawal of the Mongol troops, Subutai was reassigned by Guyuk to engage the [[Southern Song]], and died of old age in 1248.\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Devastation of Hungary===\nThe effects of the Mongol invasion were tremendous in the kingdom of the Hungary. The worst damage was incurred on the plains regions, where 50-80% of settlements were destroyed.<REf>Peter F. Sugar, P\u00e9ter Han\u00e1k, Tibor Frank -- A History of Hungary. Page 28.</ref> The combination of massacres perpetrated by the Mongols, the famines induced by their foraging, and the simultaneous devastation of the countryside by the fleeing Cumans resulted in an estimated loss of 15-25% of Hungary's population, some 300,000-500,000 people in total.<ref>Sugar, p.27: \"In the plains, between 50 and 80 percent of the settlements were destroyed. In forested areas, in the mountains, and in Transylvania, the demographic loss is estimated at 25-30 percent\".</ref> The only places that held in the face of Mongol assaults were approximately eighty fortified places, including all of the few stone castles in the kingdom. Among these places were Esztergom, [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]], and the Pannonhalma Archabbey.<ref>Makkai, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 (1994a). \"Transformation into a Western-type state, 1196\u20131301\".

Indiana University Press. pp. 23\u201333. {{ISBN|963-7081-01-1}}.</ref> However, these places were relatively few; a German chronicler in 1241 noted that Hungary \"had almost no city protected by strong walls or fortresses\", so the majority of settled areas were extremely vulnerable.<Ref>Peter Jackson, \"The Mongols and the West\", p. 66</ref>\n\n===Reaction from other European rulers===\nWhile the king kept himself apprised of the situation in the rest of the country, he made numerous attempts to contact other rulers of Europe, including the Pope, the Holy Roman Emperor, and the King of France. None of them were willing to provide significant support to Hungary, either during or after the invasion. Pope Gregory XI called a Crusade against the Mongols, wrote to numerous German princes telling them to gather their forces, and ordered the clergy to give refuge to the Hungarian king and his subjects should they seek refuge from the Mongols. However, he warned the Hungarian king that help was unlikely to materialize as long as the Holy Roman Emperor remained belligerent and in conflict with the church.<REf>Jackson, pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nHis prediction was ultimately correct, as the Holy Roman Empire (HRE) took little part in fighting the Mongols, bar repelling minor scouting parties in Bohemia, Moravia, Bavaria, and Austria. Emperor Frederick II, in his warning letter to Christiandom, grimly assessed the situation but also tried to use it as leverage over the Papacy.<Ref>Matthew Paris, 341-344.</ref> However, Frederick was well aware of the threat they posed. Even before the Pope's summons, Emperor Frederick II and his son, Conrad IV, called a Landfrieden throughout Germany. Conrad ordered the magnates to levy their armies, while Frederick II ordered them to strengthen their defenses.<Ref>Jackson, pp. 66\u201367</ref> The states of the Holy Roman Empire intended to bog the Mongols down laying siege to thousands of castles and fortified towns and fighting thousands of small sallying forces, rather than riding out to meet the Mongols in one large field battle as the Hungarians and Poles had done. A letter written by Emperor Frederick II, found in the Regesta Imperii, dated to June 20th 1241 and intended for all his vassals in Swabia, Austria, and Bohemia, included a number of specific military instructions. His forces were to avoid engaging the Mongols in field battles, hoard all food stocks in every fortress and stronghold, and arm all possible levies as well as the general populace.<REf>\nRegesta Imperii, (RI V) n. 3210, http://regesten.regesta-imperii.de/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717102325/http://regesten.regesta-imperii.de/ |date=2009-07-17 }}\n</ref> Duke Frederick of Austria paid to have Austria's border castles strengthened at his own expense.<Ref>Master Roger, Epistle, 195</ref> In Bohemia king Wenceslaus I had every castle strengthened and provisioned, as well as providing soldiers and armaments to monasteries in order to turn them into refuges for the civilian population.<Ref>Harold T. Cheshire, \u201cThe Great Tartar Invasion of Europe,\u201d The Slavonic Review 5 (1926): 97.</ref> In the end these preparations were unnecessary, as the Mongols never launched a full-scale invasion of the Holy Roman Empire. There were Mongol raids and sieges in the HRE border states in the aftermath of their victories in Poland and Hungary, in which Frederick's instructions seemed to have been followed, but these were minor affairs and quickly abandoned.<ref>Howorth, Sir Henry Hoyle.

Tauris Parke Paperbacks (January 17, 2004). p. 173. {{ISBN|978-1860649721}}</ref>\n\nThe Duke of Austria and Styria, Frederick I, took advantage of the chaos of the invasion to occupy three Hungarian counties which he then had fortified. During the second half of 1242, following the Mongol withdrawal,\nthe Hungarians mustered their remaining troops and invaded the disputed counties. They would be fought over infrequently for the next four years, until the [[Battle of the Leitha River]], where Frederick's death resulted in the counties being ceded to Hungary.<Ref>\u00c9rszegi, G\u00e9za; Solymosi, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 (1981). \"Az \u00c1rp\u00e1dok kir\u00e1lys\u00e1ga, 1000\u20131301 [The Monarchy of the \u00c1rp\u00e1ds, 1000\u20131301]\".

Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3. pp. 149.</ref>\n\n===Hungarian reforms and future raids===\n{{main|Second Mongol invasion of Hungary}}\n\nWhile devastated, the kingdom of Hungary was intact. Within a year of the withdrawal of the Mongols, the three westernmost counties ([[Moson]], [[Sopron]], and [[Vas]]) that were extorted as ransom by Duke Frederick of Austria were recaptured, and a local uprising in [[Slavonia]] was quashed. In the decades following, the khans of the Golden Horde would repeatedly demand submission from Hungary- for example, Berke demanded once in 1259 and again in 1264 that Hungary become part of his empire and contribute its army to his planned invasion of central Europe in exchange for tax exemption and a share of the plunder- but were always ignored.<ref>Jean W. Sedlar, East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000\u20131500 (Seattle: University of Washington Press), 379.</ref> The threat of another Mongol invasion, this time taken seriously, was the source of national unity and provided the impetus for B\u00e9la IV's extensive expansion of Hungarian defenses, especially the building of new stone castles (forty-four in the first ten years) and the revitalization of the army, including expanding the number of heavily armoured cavalry and knights in the royal army. B\u00e9la IV is seen now as a second founder of the nation, partly in recognition of all that was done during his reign to reconstruct and fortify the country against foreign invasion from the east. These improvements were to pay off in 1285 when [[Nogai Khan]] [[Second Mongol invasion of Hungary|attempted an invasion of the country]] (raids along the frontier had been frequent in the intervening years, but Nogai's attack was the first major invasion since 1242). In that event, the invasion was defeated quickly,<ref>Kosztolnyik, Z. J., pp. 284\u201387</ref> as were a number of other attacks before and after.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lament for the Destruction of Hungary by the Tartars]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Cartledge, Bryan (2011).

In the painting, Matisse replicated the background setting of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s original, but omitted the [[eponymous]] subject Mona Lisa from the scene.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS A&GT\"/> It was the first of what became her signature ''Be Back in 5 Minutes'' series.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\n\nThe ''Be Back in Five Minutes'' series gave Matisse her first widespread exposure as an artist, in her own right, and informed her work for years thereafter. In those paintings, Matisse reproduced the recognizable settings of famous paintings, always omitting the figures; as if the models had \"stepped out for the moment\".<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\nFamous works of [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]] also figured prominently in other early entries to the series; ''[[Young Woman with a Water Pitcher]]'', ''[[The Art of Painting]]'', and ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]''  were all reinterpreted by Matisse in the late 1990s, minus the figures portrayed by Vermeer.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\n\n==Exhibitions==\nAlthough she had previously participated in group exhibitions in New York and elsewhere, Matisse's first solo exhibition opened in January 2002, at the gallery which continued to represent her in New York, Francis Naumann Fine Art. It was the gallery's first exhibition of [[Contemporary art]].<ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/> Matisse's ''Monna Lisa (Be Back in Five Minutes)'' was featured in this first exhibition along with over twenty others of the artist's absentee paintings.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\n\nAmong American artworks from which Matisse \"removed\" the occupants are [[Grant Wood]]'s ''[[American Gothic]]'', in which the [[pitchfork]] is left standing alone in the foreground, and [[Edward Hopper]]'s ''[[Nighthawks (painting)|Nighthawks]]'', in which the [[diner]] is replicated devoid of customers and staff. Both of these were painted in 2001.<ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\nThe artwork of Henri Matisse is also among those reinterpreted. ''Goldfish'' reproduces the scene as originally portrayed by him, minus the [[goldfish]]. ''[[The Conversation (painting)|The Conversation]]'' leaves an empty chair by the window.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\n\nArtwork from this series was also assembled for an exhibition titled \"Once Removed\" at the [[Upstate New York|upstate New York]] [[Katonah Museum of Art]] in the summer of 2005.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS A&GT\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS ZSPcat\"/>\n\n===Matisse's reinterpretation of ''Guernica''===\nIn 2003, Matisse added [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' to the number of paintings she reinterpreted.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> This time, Matisse opted to \"colorize\" Picasso's [[monochrome|monochromatic]] \"anti-war testament\" \u2014 a painting to which she had never actually stood \"face to face\".<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> \nDespite her great-grandfather and Picasso's \"rocky relationship\".<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/><ref>{{cite web |publisher=Vanity Fair|first=John|last=Richardson|date=February 2003 |title=Between Picasso and Matisse |accessdate=14 April 2013|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/style/features/2003/02/picasso-matisse200302}}</ref>\nMatisse followed her own color sensibilities, as opposed to mimicking those of her great-grandfather.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/>\n\nMatisse used Guerra Paint acrylics and painted on canvas,<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> testing color combinations by first painting many small sketches.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/> She kept true to the impact of Picasso's original by painting it large-scale, approximately {{convert|8|by|20|ft}}. Her efforts yielded several paintings and various drawings, which culminated in her Sophie Matisse Does Guernica exhibition, early in 2003 in New York.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> One piece, ''911 Guernica'', uses ''Guernica'' as the motif to convey her own first hand experiences witnessing the terrorist attack on New York's [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|Twin Towers]] from her neighborhood near the site.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> Matisse's ''Guernica'' exhibition was scheduled to coincide with the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s dual survey exhibiting the works of both Picasso and Matisse.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/>\n\nThe artist and her \"Be Back in 5 minutes\" series faced as much opposition as they did praise, with some critics deriding her \"coloring-in\" of Picasso by comparing it with the colorization of black and white movies.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Tele\"/> Art critic [[Arthur Danto]] said Matisse's work \"demonstrates why Picasso was right to use black and white and gray, and why Matisse was exactly right never to have attempted to depict violence\".\n\nMatisse in 2003 also participated in a project coordinated by [[Dodie Kazanjian]] for ''[[Vogue magazine|Vogue]]'' magazine.\n\"Self Portraits: A Vogue Portfolio\" appeared in print as a ten-page feature in the December 2003, issue of the magazine.<ref name=\"Self portrait Vogue03\"/> As the title suggests, each artist submitted a \"self-portrait\". Matisse was featured among other female artists of her generation such as [[Kiki Smith]]. Matisse's contribution was a \"Be Back in 5 Minutes\" interpretation of [[Gustave Courbet]]'s erotic painting ''[[L'Origine du monde|The Origin of the World]]'', this time removing the 19th century French painter's graphically portrayed [[Nude (painting)|nude]] model, leaving only the rumpled bedsheets. The completed artworks were exhibited at [[Deitch Projects]] SoHo gallery space at the time of publication.<ref name=\"Self portrait Vogue03\"/>\n\n===Zebra stripe paintings===\nMatisse began a new series of paintings in the Spring of 2004, which culminated in her third solo exhibition, the Zebra Stripe Paintings,<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS ZSPcat\"/> debuting in New York in the latter months of 2005.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS ZSPcat\"/><ref name=\"Sophies Choices\"/> Matisse once again appropriated historically significant artworks, this time superimposing her own imagery in the form of zebra stripes overlapping the originals. In these paintings, all acrylics and oil on canvas, the appropriated originals are somewhat obscured by the stripes, rendering them less readily identifiable,<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> and the artist herself has joked that her dyslexia may have been helpful in creating these works.<ref name=\"Sophies Choices\"/> The series was compared to [[James Rosenquist]]'s later works, juxtaposing and overlapping seemingly unrelated imagery.<ref name=\"artnet ALAIN\"/> Matisse again appropriated one of her great-grandfather's artworks, this time overlaying his ''Blue Nude'' with her zebra stripes.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/>\n\n==Special projects==\nMatisse has provided artwork in collaboration with business interests and also in support of charitable causes. In 2008, She collaborated with [[Kilian Hennessy]], heir to the [[Hennessy]] lineage of [[cognac]] makers, providing artwork for a line of fragrances. Matisse added her personal touch to fifty bottles of Kilian perfumes, hand-painting, signing and numbering every bottle and its box. Each of the limited edition creations bore a design different from the others.  Additionally, Matisse collaborated with @byKilian in December 2009 on 15 hand-painted, Special Edition (Gold) perfume bottles, which were sold to key By Kilian clients.<ref name=\"Kilian\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net OBJECT\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2008\"/>\n\nFor an exhibition titled The Art of the Game coinciding with [[San Diego]]'s Beyond the Border International Contemporary Art Fair of 2009, Matisse created five chess sets of her own design. She considered her participation \"a tribute\" to the game's presence within her family in general, and her upbringing personally.<ref name=\"Chess\"/>\n\nIn 2010, Matisse participated in the New York installment of an international campaign produced by the non-profit group [[Sing For Hope]].\nThe project called for 60 pianos to be placed in specifically chosen public places around a chosen city, in this case New York City, each first hand-painted by participating artists and amateurs alike. The decorated pianos remained at their specified locations for two weeks in July 2010, with the instructions \"Play me, I'm yours\" clearly marked, and an attendant present to oversee and invite passersby. Matisse hand-painted four [[Kimball International#Kimball piano and organ|Kimball]] pianos, all of which had been donated for the cause, even painting the piano keys. Some, if not all, of Sophie's four were displayed in the lobby of [[Avery Fisher Hall]] and [[Lincoln Center]] [[esplanade|promenade]]. All 60 pianos were auctioned that fall.<ref name=\"Pianos1\"/><ref name=\"Pianos2\"/><ref name=\"Pianos3\"/>\n\nMatisse is represented by Francis Naumann Fine Art, LLC, in New York City.<ref name=\"Chess\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1992, when she was 27, Matisse married [[Pop art]]ist [[Alain Jacquet]], whom she had met during her years at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, Paris. Jacquet similarly reworked classic artworks into his own creations, which have been described as \"Pop subterfuge\".<ref name=\"artnet ALAIN\"/> The marriage produced a daughter, [[Ga\u00efa Jacquet-Matisse]], born in 1993.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> Matisse and Jacquet were considered a \"perfect couple\" by friends and acquaintances, and remained married until Jacquet's death, at age 69, in 2008.<ref name=\"artnet ALAIN\"/>\nMatisse later married Amar Zribi in St. Martin FWI, in 2012.<ref name=\"marriage Vogue\"/>\n\n===Family background===\nMatisse's father is the sculptor and inventor [[Paul Matisse]], a [[Harvard]] graduate.<ref name=\"Chess\"/> Her grandfather, Paul's father, was [[Modern art]] dealer [[Pierre Matisse]], who had moved to America in the 1920s.<ref name=\"Chess\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/> Pierre was the youngest child of 20th century painter [[Henri Matisse]], Sophie's great-grandfather.<ref name=\"Chess\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\n\nHenri Matisse died in 1954, aged 85, eleven years before Sophie's birth. Family members expressed concern for Sophie's future as an artist in her own right, and suggested she use her great grandmother, Amelie Pareyre as her family name to avoid constant comparison to Henri Matisse. Only by incidentally noticing her family name on museum walls did Sophie, as a young child, come to consider that her great-grandfather may have been someone \"exceptional\".<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Tele\"/>\n\nMatisse's step-grandfather was the artist [[Marcel Duchamp]], who [[Mona Lisa replicas and reinterpretations|reinterpreted Leonardo da Vinci's ''Mona Lisa'']] in his ''[[L.H.O.O.Q.]]'' by adding a mustache.<ref name=\"Chess\"/><ref name=\"New Yorker\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/> Duchamp married Matisse's grandmother Alexina \"Teeny\" Matisse, an American,<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> in 1954 after she and Pierre Matisse had divorced.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/> Matisse has cited Duchamp as an influence, once saying \"his presence stopped me from getting too serious\".<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/> Art writers have pointed to the \"[[visual pun|visual jokes]]\" sometimes apparent in Matisse's own work as a sign of Duchamp's influence.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"s.m.net BIO\">{{cite web | url =

paintings, in which she appropriated and embellished upon, or subtracted from, recognizable works from art history.\n\nMedia coverage is often quick to note Matisse's family background, an art [[pedigree chart|pedigree]] originating with her great-grandfather, the 20th century painter [[Henri Matisse]]. [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'' newspaper in 2003 referred to Matisse as \"art royalty\",<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/> a term occasionally [[paraphrase]]d when discussing Matisse and her artwork.\n\n==Early life==\nMatisse was born in [[Boston]] on February 13, 1965,<ref name=\"s.m.net BIO\"/><ref name=\"Chess\"/>\nand was raised in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]],<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> having what has been described as a \"[[hippie]] childhood\".<ref name=\"artnet ALAIN\"/> Her father is the sculptor [[Paul Matisse]], whose grandfather was [[Henri Matisse]].<ref name=\"Chess\"/>\nMatisse had \"serious\" [[dyslexia]] in her youth,<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> which she remedied through creative pursuits.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/>\n\n==Education==\nMatisse began studies in 1985 at the [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]] in Boston, but she dropped out after her first year.<ref name=\"s.m.net BIO\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> In 1990, she relocated to [[Paris, France|Paris]] and attended the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]],<ref name=\"s.m.net BIO\"/><ref name=\"Chess\"/> the same institution where her great-grandfather [[Henri Matisse]] had studied.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> She also bought supplies at the same art-supply store where he had shopped.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/>\n\nMatisse lived with her grandmother Teeny Duchamp in France for a time.

Her efforts yielded several paintings and various drawings, which culminated in her Sophie Matisse Does Guernica exhibition, early in 2003 in New York.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> One piece, ''911 Guernica'', uses ''Guernica'' as the motif to convey her own first hand experiences witnessing the terrorist attack on New York's [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|Twin Towers]] from her neighborhood near the site.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> Matisse's ''Guernica'' exhibition was scheduled to coincide with the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s dual survey exhibiting the works of both Picasso and Matisse.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/>\n\nThe artist and her \"Be Back in 5 minutes\" series faced as much opposition as they did praise, with some critics deriding her \"coloring-in\" of Picasso by comparing it with the colorization of black and white movies.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Tele\"/> Art critic [[Arthur Danto]] said Matisse's work \"demonstrates why Picasso was right to use black and white and gray, and why Matisse was exactly right never to have attempted to depict violence\".\n\nMatisse in 2003 also participated in a project coordinated by [[Dodie Kazanjian]] for ''[[Vogue magazine|Vogue]]'' magazine.\n\"Self Portraits: A Vogue Portfolio\" appeared in print as a ten-page feature in the December 2003, issue of the magazine.<ref name=\"Self portrait Vogue03\"/> As the title suggests, each artist submitted a \"self-portrait\". Matisse was featured among other female artists of her generation such as [[Kiki Smith]]. Matisse's contribution was a \"Be Back in 5 Minutes\" interpretation of [[Gustave Courbet]]'s erotic painting ''[[L'Origine du monde|The Origin of the World]]'', this time removing the 19th century French painter's graphically portrayed [[Nude (painting)|nude]] model, leaving only the rumpled bedsheets. The completed artworks were exhibited at [[Deitch Projects]] SoHo gallery space at the time of publication.<ref name=\"Self portrait Vogue03\"/>\n\n===Zebra stripe paintings===\nMatisse began a new series of paintings in the Spring of 2004, which culminated in her third solo exhibition, the Zebra Stripe Paintings,<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS ZSPcat\"/> debuting in New York in the latter months of 2005.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS ZSPcat\"/><ref name=\"Sophies Choices\"/> Matisse once again appropriated historically significant artworks, this time superimposing her own imagery in the form of zebra stripes overlapping the originals. In these paintings, all acrylics and oil on canvas, the appropriated originals are somewhat obscured by the stripes, rendering them less readily identifiable,<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> and the artist herself has joked that her dyslexia may have been helpful in creating these works.<ref name=\"Sophies Choices\"/> The series was compared to [[James Rosenquist]]'s later works, juxtaposing and overlapping seemingly unrelated imagery.<ref name=\"artnet ALAIN\"/> Matisse again appropriated one of her great-grandfather's artworks, this time overlaying his ''Blue Nude'' with her zebra stripes.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/>\n\n==Special projects==\nMatisse has provided artwork in collaboration with business interests and also in support of charitable causes. In 2008, She collaborated with [[Kilian Hennessy]], heir to the [[Hennessy]] lineage of [[cognac]] makers, providing artwork for a line of fragrances. Matisse added her personal touch to fifty bottles of Kilian perfumes, hand-painting, signing and numbering every bottle and its box. Each of the limited edition creations bore a design different from the others.  Additionally, Matisse collaborated with @byKilian in December 2009 on 15 hand-painted, Special Edition (Gold) perfume bottles, which were sold to key By Kilian clients.<ref name=\"Kilian\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net OBJECT\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2008\"/>\n\nFor an exhibition titled The Art of the Game coinciding with [[San Diego]]'s Beyond the Border International Contemporary Art Fair of 2009, Matisse created five chess sets of her own design. She considered her participation \"a tribute\" to the game's presence within her family in general, and her upbringing personally.<ref name=\"Chess\"/>\n\nIn 2010, Matisse participated in the New York installment of an international campaign produced by the non-profit group [[Sing For Hope]].\nThe project called for 60 pianos to be placed in specifically chosen public places around a chosen city, in this case New York City, each first hand-painted by participating artists and amateurs alike. The decorated pianos remained at their specified locations for two weeks in July 2010, with the instructions \"Play me, I'm yours\" clearly marked, and an attendant present to oversee and invite passersby. Matisse hand-painted four [[Kimball International#Kimball piano and organ|Kimball]] pianos, all of which had been donated for the cause, even painting the piano keys. Some, if not all, of Sophie's four were displayed in the lobby of [[Avery Fisher Hall]] and [[Lincoln Center]] [[esplanade|promenade]]. All 60 pianos were auctioned that fall.<ref name=\"Pianos1\"/><ref name=\"Pianos2\"/><ref name=\"Pianos3\"/>\n\nMatisse is represented by Francis Naumann Fine Art, LLC, in New York City.<ref name=\"Chess\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1992, when she was 27, Matisse married French [[Pop art]]ist [[Alain Jacquet]], who was then 53,<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/> whom she had met during her years at \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, Paris. Jacquet similarly reworked classic artworks into his own creations, which have been described as \"Pop subterfuge\".<ref name=\"artnet ALAIN\"/> The marriage produced a daughter, [[Ga\u00efa Jacquet-Matisse]], born in 1993.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> Matisse and Jacquet were considered a \"perfect couple\" by friends and acquaintances, and remained married until Jacquet's death, at age 69, in 2008.<ref name=\"artnet ALAIN\"/>\nMatisse married Amar Zribi in St. Martin FWI, in 2012.<ref name=\"marriage Vogue\"/>\n\n===Family background===\nMatisse's father is the sculptor and inventor [[Paul Matisse]], a [[Harvard]] graduate.<ref name=\"Chess\"/> Her grandfather, Paul's father, was [[Modern art]] dealer [[Pierre Matisse]], who had moved to America in the 1920s.<ref name=\"Chess\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/> Pierre was the youngest child of 20th century painter [[Henri Matisse]], Sophie's great-grandfather.<ref name=\"Chess\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\n\nHenri Matisse died in 1954, aged 85, eleven years before Sophie's birth. Family members expressed concern as to Sophie's use of the Matisse name, and in her youth she was discouraged from admitting to be a descendant of her great-grandfather. Only by incidentally noticing her family name on museum walls did Sophie come to consider that her great-grandfather may have been someone \"exceptional\".<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Tele\"/>\n\nMatisse's step-grandfather was the artist [[Marcel Duchamp]], who [[Mona Lisa replicas and reinterpretations|reinterpreted Leonardo da Vinci's ''Mona Lisa'']] in his ''[[L.H.O.O.Q.]]'' by adding a mustache.<ref name=\"Chess\"/><ref name=\"New Yorker\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/> Duchamp married Matisse's grandmother Alexina \"Teeny\" Matisse, an

{"title_page": "Psychology of self", "text_new": "{{short description|The study of either the cognitive, conative or affective representation of one's identity, or the subject of experience}}\n{{distinguish|Self psychology}}\nThe '''psychology of self''' is the study of either the [[cognitive]], [[Conative function|conative]] or [[affective]] representation of one's identity, or the subject of experience. The earliest formulation of the self in modern psychology derived from the distinction between the self as ''I,'' the subjective knower, and the self as ''Me'', the object that is known.<ref>James, W. (1891).  ''The Principles of Psychology, Vol.1.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. (Original work published 1891)</ref>\n\nCurrent views of the self in psychology position the self as playing an integral part in human motivation, cognition, affect, and [[social identity]].<ref>Sedikides, C. & Spencer, S. J. (Eds.) (2007). ''The Self''. New York: Psychology Press</ref> It may be the case that we can now usefully attempt to ground experience of self in a neural process with cognitive consequences, which will give us insight into the elements of which the complex multiply situated selves of modern identity are composed.\n\nThe self has many facets that help make up integral parts of it, such as [[self-awareness]], [[self-esteem]], [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], and [[self-perception]]. All parts of the self enable people to alter, change, add, and modify aspects of themselves in order to gain social acceptance in society. \n\nA useful accounting of contributing factors to what we call \"selfhood\" is the self gradually emerges and arises at the intersection between:\n*the habits in our biological-metabolic processes,\n*the socio-cultural habits of local culture inculcated into us,\n*our role models, good and bad,\n*how much responsibility the individual takes to make healthy choices gain and again, develop and strengthen their own Chooser self.\n\n==Kohut's formulation==\n{{Main|Heinz Kohut}}\nHeinz Kohut<ref>H. Kohut (1966), \"Forms and Transformations of Narcissism\" in C. Strozier (Ed.), ''Self Psychology and the Humanities'', New York: Norton, 1985 pp. 97\u2013123</ref> initially proposed a bipolar self compromising two systems of [[narcissistic]] perfection:'' 1) a system of ambitions and, 2) a system of ideals.''  Kohut called the pole of ambitions the ''narcissistic self'' (later, the ''grandiose self''<ref>H. Kohut (1971), ''The Analysis of the Self.'' New York: International Universities Press</ref>), while the pole of ideals was designated the ''idealized parental [[imago]]''. According to Kohut, these poles of the self represented natural progressions in the psychic life of infants and toddlers.\n\nKohut argued that when the child's ambitions and exhibitionistic strivings were chronically frustrated, arrests in the grandiose self led to the preservation of a false, expansive sense of self that could manifest outwardly in the visible [[grandiosity]] of the frank narcissist, or remain hidden from view, unless discovered in a narcissistic therapeutic [[transference]] (or ''selfobject transference'') that would expose these primitive grandiose fantasies and strivings.  Kohut termed this form of transference a ''mirror transference''.  In this transference, the strivings of the grandiose self are mobilized and the patient attempts to use the therapist to gratify these strivings.\n\nKohut proposed that arrests in the pole of ideals occurred when the child suffered chronic and excessive disappointment over the failings of early idealized figures.  Deficits in the pole of ideals were associated with the development of an idealizing transference to the therapist who becomes associated with the patient's primitive fantasies of omnipotent parental perfection.\n\nKohut believed that [[narcissistic injuries]] were inevitable and, in any case, necessary to temper ambitions and ideals with realism through the experience of more manageable frustrations and disappointments.  It was the chronicity and lack of recovery from these injuries (arising from a number of possible causes) that he regarded as central to the preservation of primitive self systems untempered by realism.\n\nAccording to the 1984 book, ''How Does Analysis Cure'',<ref>A. Goldberg and P. Stepansky (Eds.), ''How Does Analysis Cure'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press</ref> Kohut's observation of patients led him to propose two additional forms of transference associated with self deficits: ''1) the twinship and, 2) the merger transference''.  In his later years, Kohut believed that selfobject needs were both present and quite varied in normal individuals, as well as in narcissistic individuals.  To be clear, selfobjects are not external persons.  Kohut and Wolf, 1978<ref>\"Disorders of the Self and Their Treatment\", ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'', 59: 413-425</ref> explain:\n\n''\"Self objects are objects which we experience as part of our self; the expected control over them is, therefore, closer to the concept of control which a grownup expects to have over his own body and mind than to the concept of control which he expects to have over others. (p.413)\"''\n\nKohut's notion of the self can be difficult to grasp because it is experience-distant, although it is posited based upon experience-near observation of the therapeutic transference.  Kohut relied heavily on empathy as a method of observation.  Specifically, the clinician's observations of his or her own feelings in the transference help the clinician see things from the subjective view of the patient\u2014to experience the world in ways that are closer to the way the patient experiences it. (note: Kohut did not regard empathy as curative. Empathy is a method of observation).\n\n==Winnicott's selves==\n{{Main|Donald Winnicott|True self and false self}}\nDonald Winnicott distinguished what he called the \"true self\" from the \"false self\" in the human personality, considering the true self as one based on the individual's sense of being, not doing, something which was rooted in the experiencing body.<ref>Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others and its Roots in Infancy'' (London 1994) p. 230</ref> As he memorably put it to [[Harry Guntrip]], 'You know about \"being active\", but not about \"just growing, just breathing\"':<ref>Quoted in Michael Parsons, ''The Dove that Return, the Dove that Vanishes'' (London 2000) p. 82</ref> it was the latter qualities that went to form the true self.\n\nNevertheless, Winnicott did not undervalue the role of the false self in the human personality, regarding it in fact as a necessary form of defensive organization \u2013 a kind of caretaker, a survival suit behind the protection of which the true self was able to continue to exist.<ref>Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others and its Roots in Infancy'' (London 1994) p.  318</ref>\nFive levels of false self organization were identified by Winnicott, running along a kind of continuum.<ref name=\"Jacki Watts 2009 p. 148\">Jacki Watts et al, ''Developmental Psychology'' (2009) p. 148</ref> \n# In the most severe instance,  the false self completely replaces and ousts the true self, leaving the latter a mere possibility.<ref>Jacki Watts et al, ''Developmental Psychology'' (2009) p. 149</ref>  \n# Less severely, the false self protects the true self, which remains unactualised - for Winnicott a clear example of a clinical condition organised for the positive goal of preserving the individual in spite of abnormal environmental conditions of the environment.\n# Closer to health, the false self supports the individual's search for conditions that will allow the true self to recover its well-being - its own identity.\n# Even closer to health, we find the false self \"... established on the basis of identifications\".<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Maturational Processes and the Facilitating Environment'' (New York 1965) p. 121</ref>\n# Finally, in a healthy person, the false self is composed of that which facilitates social behavior, the manners and courtesy that allows for a smooth social life, with emotions expressed in socially acceptable forms.<ref name=\"Jacki Watts 2009 p. 148\"/>\n\nAs for the true self, Winnicott linked it both to playing, and to a kind of  \"hide and seek\"' designed to protect creative ownership of one's real self against exploitation,<ref>Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (1996) p. 121</ref> without entirely forfeiting the ability to relate to others.<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Maturational Processes and the Facilitating Environment'' (New York 1965) p. 187</ref>\n\n==Berne's transactional analysis==\n<!--This section is linked from [[Inner critic]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])-->\n{{Main|Eric Berne|Transactional analysis}}\nIn his transactional analysis theory Eric Berne distinguished the personality's [[Transactional Analysis#The Ego-State (or Parent-Adult-Child, PAC) model|ego states]] - Parent, Adult and Child - from what he called 'the real Self, the one that can move from one ego state to another'.<ref>Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello? (1974) p. 276</ref>\n* The parent ego consists of borrowed behaviors and feelings from previous caregivers. The parent ego can consist of either the Nurturing or Critical Parent.  The Nurturing Parent contains a more loving nature, whereas the Critical (or Prejudiced) Parent consists of preconceived ideas, thoughts, and behaviors learned from previous parents or caregivers. Some of this information can be beneficial, while others are not.\n* The adult ego is otherwise known as our data-processing center. This ego state is able to judge information based on facts, rather than emotions or preconceived beliefs.\n* The child ego is identified as the state that holds all of our memories, emotions, and feelings. People carry this ego state with them all of the time and can reflect back on it at any time. This state can also be divided into two segments: the Free (or Natural) child and the Adapted (and/or Rebellious) child. The Free child represents spontaneity, creativity, and a direct way of perceiving the world. Intimate relationships are able to form due to a person's contact with their own inner child. The less people are in touch with their inner child, the less they are able to form intimate relationships with other people. The Adapted child is the state in which people are able to comply and respond with parental commands and messages. If a parental command is viewed as too strong and demanding, a child ego can rebel against it, which is why this state can also become the Rebellious Child.<ref name=\"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.carolsolomonphd.com/web_pdfs/Transact.pdf|title=Solomon, Carol, Ph.D. \"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics.\" Transactional Analysis Journal 33.1 (2003): 15-22.}}</ref>\nBerne considered that 'the feeling of \"Self\" is a mobile one. It can reside in any of the three ego states at any given moment, and can jump from one to the other as occasion arises'.<ref>Berne, p. 248-9</ref>\n\nA person's tone, gestures, choice of words, posture, and emotional state can portray which ego state they are currently in. By knowing about their own ego states, a person can use each one in particular situations in order to enhance their experience or make new social connections. For example, a person would most likely want to be in a Free Child state along with the Adult state while attending a party in order to maximize the fun they are having while also being able to make wise choices.<ref name=\"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics\"/>\n\nTransactions is another concept in the transactional theory that relates to how people of a certain ego state interact with people of the same or different ego state at a particular moment. Straight transactions are complementary and result in clear communication among other people. On the contrary, crossed transactions are of diverging ego states that make communication either hard or frustrating. These provoke emotional stress and negative feedback.<ref name=\"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics\"/> Nevertheless, Berne saw the Self as the most valuable part of the personality: 'when people get to know each other well, they penetrate into the depths where this real Self resides, and that is the part of the other person they respect and love'<ref>Berne, p. 276</ref>\n\n== Jungian archetype of the self ==\n{{Main|Self (Jung)}}\nIn classical Jungian analysis, the Self is the central archetype of several [[Jungian archetypes|archetype]]s, which are apriori or predispositions of responding to the world in particular ways.<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\">Fadiman, J. [http://www.sofia.edu/about/carl_jung.php Transpersonal Pioneers: Carl Jung.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425105134/http://www.sofia.edu/about/carl_jung.php |date=2013-04-25 }} Personality and Personal Growth. By R. Frager. Excerpt from ''Personality and Personal Growth'' 6th ed. New York: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2005. 56. Sofia University.</ref> The Self signifies the coherent whole, unifying both the consciousness and unconscious mind of a person. The Self, according to Jung, is the most important and difficult archetype to understand.<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\"/> It is realized as the product of individuation, which is defined as the process of integrating one's personality.<ref name=\"Man and his Symbols\"/> The self can appear to the individual both impersonally as dreams and images (circle, mandala, crystal, or stone) or personally (royal couple, divine child, or another divine symbol). Symbolic spiritual people, such as Christ and Mohammed, are also seen as symbols of the self, because they represent unity and equilibrium.<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\"/> The [[Wise Old Woman/Man]] can also serve as 'a symbolic personification of the Self'.<ref name=\"Man and his Symbols\">Marie-Louise von Franz, in C. G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 208</ref>\n\nWhat distinguishes classical Jungian psychology from earlier theories is the idea that there are two centers of the personality. The ego is the center of conscious identity, whereas the Self is the center of the total personality\u2014including consciousness, the unconscious, and the ego. The Self is both the whole and the center. While the ego is a self-contained little circle off the center contained within the whole, the Self can be understood as the greater circle.<ref name=\"Man and his Symbols\"/> People know of this Self, yet it is not known. Jung expresses it in this way: \"If the Self could be wholly experienced, it would be a limited experience, whereas in reality its experience is unlimited and endless.... If I were one with the Self I would have knowledge of everything, I would speak Sanskrit, read cuneiform script, know the events that took place in pre-history be acquainted with the life of other planets, etc.\"<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\"/>\n\nThe Self, besides being the centre of the psyche, is also autonomous, meaning that it exists outside of time and space. Jung also called the Self an ''[[imago dei]]''. The Self is the source of dreams and often appears as an authority figure in dreams with the ability to perceive the future or guide one in the present.<ref name=\"Thompson\">{{cite book | title=Waking, Dreaming, Being.

[[Edward E. Sampson]] (1989) argues that the preoccupation with independence is harmful in that it creates racial, sexual and national divides and does not allow for observation of the self-in-[[Other (philosophy)|other]] and other-in-self.\n\nThe very notion of selfhood has been attacked on the grounds that it is seen as necessary for the mechanisms of advanced capitalism to function. In ''Inventing our selves: Psychology, power, and personhood'', [[Nikolas Rose]] (1998) proposes that psychology is now employed as a technology that allows humans to buy into an invented and arguably false sense of self. In this way, '[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s theories of self have been extensively developed by Rose to explore techniques of governance via self-formation...the self has to become an enterprising subject, acquiring [[cultural capital]] in order to gain employment',<ref>Lisa Adkins, ''Feminism after Bourdieu'' (2004) p. 78</ref> thus contributing to self-[[wikt:exploit|exploitation]].\n\n<!-- Commenting this out for now; needs to be written/explained more clearly: The quantifying and classifying process is referred to by [[Michel Foucault]] (1975, 1977) as being the issue of [[\u2018the calculable man']]: when the masses are classified they can be exploited as individuals and it is individuality that allows this to occur. -->\nIt is suggested by Kohut that for an individual to talk about, explain, understand or judge oneself is linguistically impossible, since it requires the self to understand its ''self''. This is seen as philosophically invalid, being self-referential, or [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]], also known as a [[circular argument]]. Thus, if actions arise so that the self attempts self-explanation, confusion may well occur within linguistic mental pathways and processes.\n\nAs for the theorists of the self, Winnicott has his critics, suggesting that his theory of the way 'the False Self is invented to manage a prematurely important object...enacts a kind of dissociated regard or recognition of the object'<ref>Adam Phillips, ''On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored'' (1994) p. 31</ref> is itself rooted in 'his own childhood experience of trying to \"make my living\" by keeping his mother alive'.<ref>Minsky, p. 134</ref>\n\nThe self has long been considered as the central element and support of any experience.<ref name=Self>Tapu, CS (2001). ''[http://relationtherapy.webs.com/Hypostatic_Personality/Hypostatic_Personality.htm Hypostatic Personality: Psychopathology of Doing and Being Made]''. Premier, p. 114. {{ISBN|973-8030-59-5}}.</ref> The self is not 'permanently stuck into the heart of [[consciousness]]'.\n\"I am not always as intensively aware of me as an agent, as I am of my actions. That results from the fact that I perform only part of my actions, the other part being conducted by my thought, expression, practical operations, and so on.\"<ref name=Self />\n\n==Memory and the self==\n\nMemory and the self are interconnected with each other that, combined, can be defined as the Self-Memory System (SMS). The self is viewed as a combination of memories and self-images (working self). Conway proposes that a person's long-term memory and working self are dependent on each other. Our prior knowledge of our self puts constraints on what our working self is and the working self modifies the access to our long-term memory, as well as, what it consists of.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/k.allan/pages/dept/webfiles/4thyear/conway%202005%20jml.pdf|title=Conway, Martin A. \"Memory and the Self.\" Journal of Memory and Language 53 (2005): 594-628.

One example of this is a study by Conway and Ross,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Conway|first=Michael|last2=Ross|first2=Michael|title=Getting what you want by revising what you had.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=47|issue=4|pages=738\u2013748|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.47.4.738|year=1984}}</ref> which demonstrates that if a change in skill is expected, but there is no actual improvement, people will believe that their past skill state was worse than it was.\n\n=== Recalling Pain ===\nIn general recollection of pain is fairly accurate, although differences are seen between recollection of acute and chronic pain. Research suggests that recall for acute pain is more accurate than recall for chronic pain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Myra|last2=Philips|first2=Clare|last3=Rachman|first3=Stanley|title=Memory for pain|journal=Pain|volume=6|issue=1|pages=35\u201346|doi=10.1016/0304-3959(79)90138-6|pmid=424233|year=1979}}</ref>\n\nAn interesting phenomenon seen in recollection of pain in the self is the peak-end phenomenon. Research has shown that when enduring painful experiences, people will 'prefer' more drawn out experiences that end with lower levels of pain, over shorter experiences that end with higher levels of pain, even though the shorter experiences provide less pain overall.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Redelmeier|first=Donald A|last2=Katz|first2=Joel|last3=Kahneman|first3=Daniel|title=Memories of colonoscopy: a randomized trial|journal=Pain|volume=104|issue=1|pages=187\u2013194|doi=10.1016/s0304-3959(03)00003-4|year=2003|hdl=10315/7959}}</ref>\n\nRecalled ratings of pain are more closely related to a combination of the peak pain in the experience, and the end pain of the experience.

The self is made up of three main parts that, incorporated, allow for the self to maintain its function. The parts of the self include: [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]], interpersonal self, and the agent self.<ref name=\"The Self\">Baumeister, Roy F., and Brad J. Bushman. \"The Self.\" Social Psychology and Human Nature. 2nd ed. Belmont, CA: Cengage Learning, 2011. 57\u201396. Print.</ref>\n\n===Self-knowledge===\n{{Main|Self-knowledge (psychology)}}\nSelf-knowledge is sometimes referred to as self-concept. This feature allows for people to gather information and beliefs about themselves. A person's self-awareness, self-esteem, and self-deception all fall under the self-knowledge part of self.  We learn about ourselves through our looking-glass selves, introspection, social comparisons, and self-perception.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nThe '''[[looking glass self]]''' is a term to describe a theory that people learn about themselves through other people. In the looking-glass self proposal, a person visualizes how they appear to others, the person imagines how other people will judge them, and they then develop a response to the judgment they receive from other people. The response will likely be something viewed as pride or shame about themselves. The looking-glass self has proved to be partially accurate and inaccurate. A person's self-concept does not solely depend on how others view them. A person can view themselves as friendly; however they may appear to be quiet and uptight to another person that may not know them very well.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n'''[[Introspection]]''' refers to the manner in which a person gathers information about oneself through mental functions and emotions. Although a person might not know why they are thinking or feeling in such a way, they are able to know what it is they are feeling. However, developmental stages in life might affect introspection. In a Rosenburg study, children up to a certain stage in development showed that they knew that their parents actually knew them better than they knew themselves. Also, studies done by [[Richard E. Nisbett|Nisbett]] and [[Timothy Wilson|Wilson]] uncovered the fact that people might not actually know what they are thinking all of the time. In one particular study, they discovered that many people bought the first stockings that they saw and gave the reasoning behind their choice for buying being based on the color or softness. So, in conclusion, introspection is a way of gaining knowledge about yourself through your inner emotions and thinking, however it is a conscious part of the brain. The automatic part of the brain can make us do a lot of unconscious acts that people have no reasoning for.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n'''Social comparison''' is regarded as the way in which we compare ourselves to other people around us. By looking to other people, we can rate our work and behaviors as good, neutral, or bad. The most beneficial or useful comparisons are those of people that are in the same category as ourselves. For example, a high school football player would be more appropriate in comparing himself to an all-star high school football player, rather than a Super Bowl-winning football player with over 10 years of experience. An upward social comparison refers to a person comparing themself to a person that is perceived as better than them in a particular area. This can be either motivational or discouraging to the person comparing themself. A downward social comparison refers to a person comparing themself to a person that is perceived as worse than them, which can make that person feel better about their self.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nThe '''[[self-perception theory]]''' is another theory in which a person infers about themselves through their behavior. Their behavior can give them insight as to how their feelings and emotions truly are. If a person regards their self as being smart, however they continuously receive bad grades over the years, that person might rearrange their thinking that they are not as smart as they previously thought. This helps readjust a person's thoughts in order to match their behavior better.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nSelf-knowledge is a desire for the majority of human beings. In knowing about ourselves, we are more capable of knowing how to be socially acceptable and desirable. We seek out self-knowledge due to the [[Appraisal theory|appraisal motive]], self-enhancement motive, and consistency motive. The appraisal motive describes the desire to learn the truth about oneself in general. The self-enhancement motive is the desire to learn about one's good qualities only. The consistency motive is the desire to receive reinforcement of those preconceived notions that a person has about their self. This feedback will verify the thoughts and beliefs they already had relating to their self.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:'''[[Self-awareness]]''' can be divided into two categories: private self-awareness and public self-awareness. Private self-awareness is defined as the self looking inward at oneself, including emotions, thoughts, beliefs, and feelings. All of these cannot be discovered by anyone else. Public self-awareness is defined by gathering information about your self through the perceptions of others. The actions and behaviors that others show towards a person will help that person establish a sense of how others perceive them. For example, if a person likes to sing, however many other people discourage their singing, that person can conclude that they might not be the best at singing. Therefore, in this situation, they are gaining public self-awareness about an aspect of themselves.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:'''[[Self-esteem]]''' describes how a person evaluates their self positively or negatively. Four factors that contribute to self-esteem are the reactions we get from other people, how we compare people to ourselves, social roles, and our identification. Our social roles can sometimes be conceived as higher intelligence or ability, such as an Olympic athlete or biotechnologist. Other social roles might be stigmatized as being negative, such as a criminal or homeless person.<ref name= \"McLeod\">[http://www.simplypsychology.org/self-concept.html McLeod, S. A. (2008). Self Concept. Retrieved from simplypsychology.org]</ref> People with high self-esteem view their selves as containing positive traits. They are more willing to take more risks and aim for success. People with high self-esteem tend to be confident, gain self-acceptance, do not worry as much about what others think about them, and think more optimistically.<ref name=\"McLeod\"/> In contrast, people with low self-esteem view their selves as containing few or no positive traits, rather than viewing their selves as containing negative traits.<ref name=\"The Self\"/> It is rare for a person to rate their overall self as being terrible.<ref name=\"The Self\"/> People with low self-esteem typically:\n\n:*do not wish to fail\n:*are less confident in their success rate\n:*have confused and diverged notions about their self (self-concept confusion)\n:*focus on self-protection more so than [[self-enhancement]]\n:*are more prone to emotional imbalances<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n:*are less confident about their success than high self-esteemed people\n:*worry what others think about them consistently\n:*have more pessimistic thinking\n:*desire to resemble others more than high self-esteemed people<ref name=\"McLeod\"/>\n\n:Our self-concept entails the thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that each of us uniquely foster. However, many psychologists have questioned whether our self-concept is more realistic or filled with '''[[illusion]]s''' about ourselves and the world around us. Clinical psychologists have studied depressed people with perceived low self-esteem in order to observe if their perceptions were fabricated or not. Contrary to their hypothesis, they found that depressed people have a more realistic view of the world, the qualities they obtain, and the control they have over situations in their life. It was proposed by psychologists Shelley Taylor and Jonathon Brown that the majority of people in normal-functioning mental states display and are instilled with [[positive illusions]] including:<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:*overestimating their own good qualities\n:*their control over happenings in their life\n:*an unrealistic portrayal of optimism<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:Positive illusions remain constant for the majority of one's life due to self-deception. '''[[Self-deception]]''' strategies are mental tricks of a person's mind that hide the truth and constitute false beliefs. Due to self-deception, people are able to obtain resiliency upon negative events that might occur throughout life. This also can reinforce different ideas or thoughts that the person wishes and hopes for. The [[self-serving bias]] is a strategy in which a person titles acknowledgment for success and rejects blame for failure. For example, a person who wins a track meet would glorify their ability as an athlete. However, if that person were to come in last in the meet, the person would most likely put blame on constituting factors such as a muscle cramp or previous injury preventing a good performance. Another strategy that people use is greater criticism involving bad feedback rather than good. A person would judge a situation more harshly when they did worse, while the opposite would occur for a situation that entailed good feedback.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n===Interpersonal self===\nInterpersonal self can also be referred to as your public self. This feature allows for social connection to others. With the interpersonal self, a person is able to display themselves to the others around them. Interpersonal self is apparent in situations of self-presentation, being a group member or partner in a relationship, a person's social roles, and their reputation. For example, a person might show confidence and determination in their work atmosphere, whereas they show more of their emotional and nurturing side in their romantic relationship.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nSocial roles are defined as the parts that a person plays in different situations and with other people. Our roles change in order to fit the \"expected\" behaviors in various scenarios. For example, a person may be a mother, a doctor, a wife, and daughter. Her behavior would most likely change in her transition from being a doctor to coming home to her daughter.<ref name=\"Social Roles and Social Norms\">[http://www.simplypsychology.org/social-roles.html McLeod, S. A. (2008). Social Roles and Social Norms. Retrieved from simplypsychology.org]</ref>\n\nSocial norms constitute the \"unwritten rules\" that we have about how to act in certain scenarios and with various people in our lives. For example, when a person is in a classroom, they are more likely to be quiet and attentive; whereas at a party, they are more likely to be socially engaged and standing. Norms act as guidelines that shape our behavior. Without them, there would not be any order, as well as lack of understanding in situations in society.<ref name=\"Social Roles and Social Norms\"/>\n\n===Agent self===\nThe agent self is known as the executive function that allows for actions. This is how we, as individuals, make choices and utilize our control in situations and actions. The agent self resides over everything that involves decision making, self-control, taking charge in situations, and actively responding. A person might desire to eat unhealthy foods, however it is their agent self that allows that person to choose to avoid eating them and make a healthier food choice.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n{{Main|Outline of self}}\n*[[Identity (social science)]]\n*[['I' and the 'me']]\n*[[Personality psychology|Personality]]\n*[[Self-concept]]\n*[[Self-discovery]]\n*[[Self-schema]]\n*[[Self (philosophy)]]\n*[[Self psychology]]\n*[[Self (sociology)]]\n*[[Ego (spirituality)]]\n*[[Ho'oponopono]]\n*[[Dialogical self]]\n*[[Reflexive self-consciousness]]\n*[[Future self]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wilderdom.com/self Definitions of Various Self Constructs] - Self-esteem, self-efficacy, self-confidence & self-concept.\n*[http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/self.htm Discussion of Self] \u2013 Page of the Emotional Competency website.\n*[http://iautistic.com/autism-theory-of-mind-revisited.php Theory of Self] - Proposed by an autistic to explain autism\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=OE0yeuILAlMC&pg=PA1 Images of the Self]\n*[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/false-self False self]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Self (Psychology)}}\n[[Category:Self|*]]\n[[Category:Conceptions of self|Psychological]]\n[[Category:Ego psychology]]\n[[Category:Personal development]]\n\n[[cs:Bytostn\u00e9 j\u00e1]]\n[[da:Selvet (psykologi)]]\n[[fr:Soi (psychologie)]]\n[[ja:\u81ea\u5df1]]\n[[sk:Selbst]]\n[[sr:\u0408\u0430]]\n[[sv:Sj\u00e4lvet]]\n[[yi:\u05d6\u05e2\u05d9\u05dc]]\n[[zh:\u81ea\u6027]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|The study of either the cognitive, conative or affective representation of one's identity, or the subject of experience}}\n{{distinguish|Self psychology}}\nThe '''psychology of self''' is the study of either the [[cognitive]], [[Conative function|conative]] or [[affective]] representation of one's identity, or the subject of experience.

All parts of the self enable people to alter, change, add, and modify aspects of themselves in order to gain social acceptance in society. \n\nA useful accounting of contributing factors to what we call \"selfhood\" is the self gradually emerges and arises at the intersection between:\n*the habits in our biological-metabolic processes,\n*the socio-cultural habits of local culture inculcated into us,\n*our role models, good and bad,\n*how much responsibility the individual takes to make healthy choices gain and again, develop and strengthen their own Chooser self.\n\n==Kohut's formulation==\n{{Main|Heinz Kohut}}\nHeinz Kohut<ref>H. Kohut (1966), \"Forms and Transformations of Narcissism\" in C. Strozier (Ed.), ''Self Psychology and the Humanities'', New York: Norton, 1985 pp. 97\u2013123</ref> initially proposed a bipolar self compromising two systems of [[narcissistic]] perfection:'' 1) a system of ambitions and, 2) a system of ideals.''  Kohut called the pole of ambitions the ''narcissistic self'' (later, the ''grandiose self''<ref>H. Kohut (1971), ''The Analysis of the Self.'' New York: International Universities Press</ref>), while the pole of ideals was designated the ''idealized parental [[imago]]''. According to Kohut, these poles of the self represented natural progressions in the psychic life of infants and toddlers.\n\nKohut argued that when the child's ambitions and exhibitionistic strivings were chronically frustrated, arrests in the grandiose self led to the preservation of a false, expansive sense of self that could manifest outwardly in the visible [[grandiosity]] of the frank narcissist, or remain hidden from view, unless discovered in a narcissistic therapeutic transference (or ''selfobject transference'') that would expose these primitive grandiose fantasies and strivings.  Kohut termed this form of transference a ''mirror transference''.  In this transference, the strivings of the grandiose self are mobilized and the patient attempts to use the therapist to gratify these strivings.\n\nKohut proposed that arrests in the pole of ideals occurred when the child suffered chronic and excessive disappointment over the failings of early idealized figures.  Deficits in the pole of ideals were associated with the development of an idealizing transference to the therapist who becomes associated with the patient's primitive fantasies of omnipotent parental perfection.\n\nKohut believed that [[narcissistic injuries]] were inevitable and, in any case, necessary to temper ambitions and ideals with realism through the experience of more manageable frustrations and disappointments.  It was the chronicity and lack of recovery from these injuries (arising from a number of possible causes) that he regarded as central to the preservation of primitive self systems untempered by realism.\n\nAccording to the 1984 book, ''How Does Analysis Cure'',<ref>A. Goldberg and P. Stepansky (Eds.), ''How Does Analysis Cure'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press</ref> Kohut's observation of patients led him to propose two additional forms of transference associated with self deficits: ''1) the twinship and, 2) the merger transference''.  In his later years, Kohut believed that selfobject needs were both present and quite varied in normal individuals, as well as in narcissistic individuals.  To be clear, selfobjects are not external persons.  Kohut and Wolf, 1978<ref>\"Disorders of the Self and Their Treatment\", ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'', 59: 413-425</ref> explain:\n\n''\"Self objects are objects which we experience as part of our self; the expected control over them is, therefore, closer to the concept of control which a grownup expects to have over his own body and mind than to the concept of control which he expects to have over others. (p.413)\"''\n\nKohut's notion of the self can be difficult to grasp because it is experience-distant, although it is posited based upon experience-near observation of the therapeutic transference.  Kohut relied heavily on empathy as a method of observation.  Specifically, the clinician's observations of his or her own feelings in the transference help the clinician see things from the subjective view of the patient\u2014to experience the world in ways that are closer to the way the patient experiences it. (note: Kohut did not regard empathy as curative. Empathy is a method of observation).\n\n==Winnicott's selves==\n{{Main|Donald Winnicott|True self and false self}}\nDonald Winnicott distinguished what he called the \"true self\" from the \"false self\" in the human personality, considering the true self as one based on the individual's sense of being, not doing, something which was rooted in the experiencing body.<ref>Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others and its Roots in Infancy'' (London 1994) p. 230</ref> As he memorably put it to [[Harry Guntrip]], 'You know about \"being active\", but not about \"just growing, just breathing\"':<ref>Quoted in Michael Parsons, ''The Dove that Return, the Dove that Vanishes'' (London 2000) p. 82</ref> it was the latter qualities that went to form the true self.\n\nNevertheless, Winnicott did not undervalue the role of the false self in the human personality, regarding it in fact as a necessary form of defensive organization \u2013 a kind of caretaker, a survival suit behind the protection of which the true self was able to continue to exist.<ref>Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others and its Roots in Infancy'' (London 1994) p.  318</ref>\nFive levels of false self organization were identified by Winnicott, running along a kind of continuum.<ref name=\"Jacki Watts 2009 p. 148\">Jacki Watts et al, ''Developmental Psychology'' (2009) p. 148</ref> \n# In the most severe instance,  the false self completely replaces and ousts the true self, leaving the latter a mere possibility.<ref>Jacki Watts et al, ''Developmental Psychology'' (2009) p. 149</ref>  \n# Less severely, the false self protects the true self, which remains unactualised - for Winnicott a clear example of a clinical condition organised for the positive goal of preserving the individual in spite of abnormal environmental conditions of the environment.\n# Closer to health, the false self supports the individual's search for conditions that will allow the true self to recover its well-being - its own identity.\n# Even closer to health, we find the false self \"... established on the basis of identifications\".<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Maturational Processes and the Facilitating Environment'' (New York 1965) p. 121</ref>\n# Finally, in a healthy person, the false self is composed of that which facilitates social behavior, the manners and courtesy that allows for a smooth social life, with emotions expressed in socially acceptable forms.<ref name=\"Jacki Watts 2009 p. 148\"/>\n\nAs for the true self, Winnicott linked it both to playing, and to a kind of  \"hide and seek\"' designed to protect creative ownership of one's real self against exploitation,<ref>Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (1996) p. 121</ref> without entirely forfeiting the ability to relate to others.<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Maturational Processes and the Facilitating Environment'' (New York 1965) p. 187</ref>\n\n==Berne's transactional analysis==\n<!--This section is linked from [[Inner critic]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])-->\n{{Main|Eric Berne|Transactional analysis}}\nIn his transactional analysis theory Eric Berne distinguished the personality's [[Transactional Analysis#The Ego-State (or Parent-Adult-Child, PAC) model|ego states]] - Parent, Adult and Child - from what he called 'the real Self, the one that can move from one ego state to another'.<ref>Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello? (1974) p. 276</ref>\n* The parent ego consists of borrowed behaviors and feelings from previous caregivers. The parent ego can consist of either the Nurturing or Critical Parent.  The Nurturing Parent contains a more loving nature, whereas the Critical (or Prejudiced) Parent consists of preconceived ideas, thoughts, and behaviors learned from previous parents or caregivers. Some of this information can be beneficial, while others are not.\n* The adult ego is otherwise known as our data-processing center. This ego state is able to judge information based on facts, rather than emotions or preconceived beliefs.\n* The child ego is identified as the state that holds all of our memories, emotions, and feelings. People carry this ego state with them all of the time and can reflect back on it at any time. This state can also be divided into two segments: the Free (or Natural) child and the Adapted (and/or Rebellious) child. The Free child represents spontaneity, creativity, and a direct way of perceiving the world. Intimate relationships are able to form due to a person's contact with their own inner child. The less people are in touch with their inner child, the less they are able to form intimate relationships with other people. The Adapted child is the state in which people are able to comply and respond with parental commands and messages. If a parental command is viewed as too strong and demanding, a child ego can rebel against it, which is why this state can also become the Rebellious Child.<ref name=\"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.carolsolomonphd.com/web_pdfs/Transact.pdf|title=Solomon, Carol, Ph.D. \"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics.\" Transactional Analysis Journal 33.1 (2003): 15-22.}}</ref>\nBerne considered that 'the feeling of \"Self\" is a mobile one. It can reside in any of the three ego states at any given moment, and can jump from one to the other as occasion arises'.<ref>Berne, p. 248-9</ref>\n\nA person's tone, gestures, choice of words, posture, and emotional state can portray which ego state they are currently in. By knowing about their own ego states, a person can use each one in particular situations in order to enhance their experience or make new social connections. For example, a person would most likely want to be in a Free Child state along with the Adult state while attending a party in order to maximize the fun they are having while also being able to make wise choices.<ref name=\"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics\"/>\n\nTransactions is another concept in the transactional theory that relates to how people of a certain ego state interact with people of the same or different ego state at a particular moment. Straight transactions are complementary and result in clear communication among other people. On the contrary, crossed transactions are of diverging ego states that make communication either hard or frustrating. These provoke emotional stress and negative feedback.<ref name=\"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics\"/> Nevertheless, Berne saw the Self as the most valuable part of the personality: 'when people get to know each other well, they penetrate into the depths where this real Self resides, and that is the part of the other person they respect and love'<ref>Berne, p. 276</ref>\n\n== Jungian archetype of the self ==\n{{Main|Self (Jung)}}\nIn classical Jungian analysis, the Self is the central archetype of several [[Jungian archetypes|archetype]]s, which are apriori or predispositions of responding to the world in particular ways.<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\">Fadiman, J. [http://www.sofia.edu/about/carl_jung.php Transpersonal Pioneers: Carl Jung.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425105134/http://www.sofia.edu/about/carl_jung.php |date=2013-04-25 }} Personality and Personal Growth. By R. Frager. Excerpt from ''Personality and Personal Growth'' 6th ed. New York: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2005. 56. Sofia University.</ref> The Self signifies the coherent whole, unifying both the consciousness and unconscious mind of a person. The Self, according to Jung, is the most important and difficult archetype to understand.<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\"/> It is realized as the product of individuation, which is defined as the process of integrating one's personality.<ref name=\"Man and his Symbols\"/> The self can appear to the individual both impersonally as dreams and images (circle, mandala, crystal, or stone) or personally (royal couple, divine child, or another divine symbol). Symbolic spiritual people, such as Christ and Mohammed, are also seen as symbols of the self, because they represent unity and equilibrium.<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\"/> The [[Wise Old Woman/Man]] can also serve as 'a symbolic personification of the Self'.<ref name=\"Man and his Symbols\">Marie-Louise von Franz, in C. G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 208</ref>\n\nWhat distinguishes classical Jungian psychology from earlier theories is the idea that there are two centers of the personality. The ego is the center of conscious identity, whereas the Self is the center of the total personality\u2014including consciousness, the unconscious, and the ego. The Self is both the whole and the center. While the ego is a self-contained little circle off the center contained within the whole, the Self can be understood as the greater circle.<ref name=\"Man and his Symbols\"/> People know of this Self, yet it is not known. Jung expresses it in this way: \"If the Self could be wholly experienced, it would be a limited experience, whereas in reality its experience is unlimited and endless.... If I were one with the Self I would have knowledge of everything, I would speak Sanskrit, read cuneiform script, know the events that took place in pre-history be acquainted with the life of other planets, etc.\"<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\"/>\n\nThe Self, besides being the centre of the psyche, is also autonomous, meaning that it exists outside of time and space. Jung also called the Self an ''[[imago dei]]''. The Self is the source of dreams and often appears as an authority figure in dreams with the ability to perceive the future or guide one in the present.<ref name=\"Thompson\">{{cite book | title=Waking, Dreaming, Being. Self and Consciousness in Neuroscience, Meditation, and Philosophy| author=Thompson, E | publisher=Columbia University Press | year=2017 | url=https://cup.columbia.edu/book/waking-dreaming-being/9780231137096}}</ref>\n\n==Critiques of the concept==\n'Selfhood' or complete autonomy is a common Western approach to psychology and models of self are employed constantly in areas such as [[psychotherapy]] and [[self-help]]. [[Edward E. Sampson]] (1989) argues that the preoccupation with independence is harmful in that it creates racial, sexual and national divides and does not allow for observation of the self-in-[[Other (philosophy)|other]] and other-in-self.\n\nThe very notion of selfhood has been attacked on the grounds that it is seen as necessary for the mechanisms of advanced capitalism to function. In ''Inventing our selves: Psychology, power, and personhood'', [[Nikolas Rose]] (1998) proposes that psychology is now employed as a technology that allows humans to buy into an invented and arguably false sense of self. In this way, '[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s theories of self have been extensively developed by Rose to explore techniques of governance via self-formation...the self has to become an enterprising subject, acquiring [[cultural capital]] in order to gain employment',<ref>Lisa Adkins, ''Feminism after Bourdieu'' (2004) p. 78</ref> thus contributing to self-[[wikt:exploit|exploitation]].\n\n<!-- Commenting this out for now; needs to be written/explained more clearly: The quantifying and classifying process is referred to by [[Michel Foucault]] (1975, 1977) as being the issue of [[\u2018the calculable man']]: when the masses are classified they can be exploited as individuals and it is individuality that allows this to occur. -->\nIt is suggested by Kohut that for an individual to talk about, explain, understand or judge oneself is linguistically impossible, since it requires the self to understand its ''self''. This is seen as philosophically invalid, being self-referential, or [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]], also known as a [[circular argument]]. Thus, if actions arise so that the self attempts self-explanation, confusion may well occur within linguistic mental pathways and processes.\n\nAs for the theorists of the self, Winnicott has his critics, suggesting that his theory of the way 'the False Self is invented to manage a prematurely important object...enacts a kind of dissociated regard or recognition of the object'<ref>Adam Phillips, ''On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored'' (1994) p. 31</ref> is itself rooted in 'his own childhood experience of trying to \"make my living\" by keeping his mother alive'.<ref>Minsky, p. 134</ref>\n\nThe self has long been considered as the central element and support of any experience.<ref name=Self>Tapu, CS (2001).

Premier, p. 114. {{ISBN|973-8030-59-5}}.</ref> The self is not 'permanently stuck into the heart of [[consciousness]]'.\n\"I am not always as intensively aware of me as an agent, as I am of my actions. That results from the fact that I perform only part of my actions, the other part being conducted by my thought, expression, practical operations, and so on.\"<ref name=Self />\n\n==Memory and the self==\n\nMemory and the self are interconnected with each other that, combined, can be defined as the Self-Memory System (SMS). The self is viewed as a combination of memories and self-images (working self). Conway proposes that a person's long-term memory and working self are dependent on each other. Our prior knowledge of our self puts constraints on what our working self is and the working self modifies the access to our long-term memory, as well as, what it consists of.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/k.allan/pages/dept/webfiles/4thyear/conway%202005%20jml.pdf|title=Conway, Martin A. \"Memory and the Self.\" Journal of Memory and Language 53 (2005): 594-628.

One example of this is a study by Conway and Ross,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Conway|first=Michael|last2=Ross|first2=Michael|title=Getting what you want by revising what you had.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=47|issue=4|pages=738\u2013748|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.47.4.738|year=1984}}</ref> which demonstrates that if a change in skill is expected, but there is no actual improvement, people will believe that their past skill state was worse than it was.\n\n=== Recalling Pain ===\nIn general recollection of pain is fairly accurate, although differences are seen between recollection of acute and chronic pain. Research suggests that recall for acute pain is more accurate than recall for chronic pain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Myra|last2=Philips|first2=Clare|last3=Rachman|first3=Stanley|title=Memory for pain|journal=Pain|volume=6|issue=1|pages=35\u201346|doi=10.1016/0304-3959(79)90138-6|pmid=424233|year=1979}}</ref>\n\nAn interesting phenomenon seen in recollection of pain in the self is the peak-end phenomenon. Research has shown that when enduring painful experiences, people will 'prefer' more drawn out experiences that end with lower levels of pain, over shorter experiences that end with higher levels of pain, even though the shorter experiences provide less pain overall.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Redelmeier|first=Donald A|last2=Katz|first2=Joel|last3=Kahneman|first3=Daniel|title=Memories of colonoscopy: a randomized trial|journal=Pain|volume=104|issue=1|pages=187\u2013194|doi=10.1016/s0304-3959(03)00003-4|year=2003|hdl=10315/7959}}</ref>\n\nRecalled ratings of pain are more closely related to a combination of the peak pain in the experience, and the end pain of the experience.

The self is made up of three main parts that, incorporated, allow for the self to maintain its function. The parts of the self include: [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]], interpersonal self, and the agent self.<ref name=\"The Self\">Baumeister, Roy F., and Brad J. Bushman. \"The Self.\" Social Psychology and Human Nature. 2nd ed. Belmont, CA: Cengage Learning, 2011. 57\u201396. Print.</ref>\n\n===Self-knowledge===\n{{Main|Self-knowledge (psychology)}}\nSelf-knowledge is sometimes referred to as self-concept. This feature allows for people to gather information and beliefs about themselves. A person's self-awareness, self-esteem, and self-deception all fall under the self-knowledge part of self.  We learn about ourselves through our looking-glass selves, introspection, social comparisons, and self-perception.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nThe '''[[looking glass self]]''' is a term to describe a theory that people learn about themselves through other people. In the looking-glass self proposal, a person visualizes how they appear to others, the person imagines how other people will judge them, and they then develop a response to the judgment they receive from other people. The response will likely be something viewed as pride or shame about themselves. The looking-glass self has proved to be partially accurate and inaccurate. A person's self-concept does not solely depend on how others view them. A person can view themselves as friendly; however they may appear to be quiet and uptight to another person that may not know them very well.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n'''[[Introspection]]''' refers to the manner in which a person gathers information about oneself through mental functions and emotions. Although a person might not know why they are thinking or feeling in such a way, they are able to know what it is they are feeling. However, developmental stages in life might affect introspection. In a Rosenburg study, children up to a certain stage in development showed that they knew that their parents actually knew them better than they knew themselves. Also, studies done by [[Richard E. Nisbett|Nisbett]] and [[Timothy Wilson|Wilson]] uncovered the fact that people might not actually know what they are thinking all of the time. In one particular study, they discovered that many people bought the first stockings that they saw and gave the reasoning behind their choice for buying being based on the color or softness. So, in conclusion, introspection is a way of gaining knowledge about yourself through your inner emotions and thinking, however it is a conscious part of the brain. The automatic part of the brain can make us do a lot of unconscious acts that people have no reasoning for.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n'''Social comparison''' is regarded as the way in which we compare ourselves to other people around us. By looking to other people, we can rate our work and behaviors as good, neutral, or bad. The most beneficial or useful comparisons are those of people that are in the same category as ourselves. For example, a high school football player would be more appropriate in comparing himself to an all-star high school football player, rather than a Super Bowl-winning football player with over 10 years of experience. An upward social comparison refers to a person comparing themself to a person that is perceived as better than them in a particular area. This can be either motivational or discouraging to the person comparing themself. A downward social comparison refers to a person comparing themself to a person that is perceived as worse than them, which can make that person feel better about their self.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nThe '''[[self-perception theory]]''' is another theory in which a person infers about themselves through their behavior. Their behavior can give them insight as to how their feelings and emotions truly are. If a person regards their self as being smart, however they continuously receive bad grades over the years, that person might rearrange their thinking that they are not as smart as they previously thought. This helps readjust a person's thoughts in order to match their behavior better.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nSelf-knowledge is a desire for the majority of human beings. In knowing about ourselves, we are more capable of knowing how to be socially acceptable and desirable. We seek out self-knowledge due to the [[Appraisal theory|appraisal motive]], self-enhancement motive, and consistency motive. The appraisal motive describes the desire to learn the truth about oneself in general. The self-enhancement motive is the desire to learn about one's good qualities only. The consistency motive is the desire to receive reinforcement of those preconceived notions that a person has about their self. This feedback will verify the thoughts and beliefs they already had relating to their self.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:'''[[Self-awareness]]''' can be divided into two categories: private self-awareness and public self-awareness. Private self-awareness is defined as the self looking inward at oneself, including emotions, thoughts, beliefs, and feelings. All of these cannot be discovered by anyone else. Public self-awareness is defined by gathering information about your self through the perceptions of others. The actions and behaviors that others show towards a person will help that person establish a sense of how others perceive them. For example, if a person likes to sing, however many other people discourage their singing, that person can conclude that they might not be the best at singing. Therefore, in this situation, they are gaining public self-awareness about an aspect of themselves.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:'''[[Self-esteem]]''' describes how a person evaluates their self positively or negatively. Four factors that contribute to self-esteem are the reactions we get from other people, how we compare people to ourselves, social roles, and our identification. Our social roles can sometimes be conceived as higher intelligence or ability, such as an Olympic athlete or biotechnologist. Other social roles might be stigmatized as being negative, such as a criminal or homeless person.<ref name= \"McLeod\">[http://www.simplypsychology.org/self-concept.html McLeod, S. A. (2008). Self Concept. Retrieved from simplypsychology.org]</ref> People with high self-esteem view their selves as containing positive traits. They are more willing to take more risks and aim for success. People with high self-esteem tend to be confident, gain self-acceptance, do not worry as much about what others think about them, and think more optimistically.<ref name=\"McLeod\"/> In contrast, people with low self-esteem view their selves as containing few or no positive traits, rather than viewing their selves as containing negative traits.<ref name=\"The Self\"/> It is rare for a person to rate their overall self as being terrible.<ref name=\"The Self\"/> People with low self-esteem typically:\n\n:*do not wish to fail\n:*are less confident in their success rate\n:*have confused and diverged notions about their self (self-concept confusion)\n:*focus on self-protection more so than [[self-enhancement]]\n:*are more prone to emotional imbalances<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n:*are less confident about their success than high self-esteemed people\n:*worry what others think about them consistently\n:*have more pessimistic thinking\n:*desire to resemble others more than high self-esteemed people<ref name=\"McLeod\"/>\n\n:Our self-concept entails the thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that each of us uniquely foster. However, many psychologists have questioned whether our self-concept is more realistic or filled with '''[[illusion]]s''' about ourselves and the world around us. Clinical psychologists have studied depressed people with perceived low self-esteem in order to observe if their perceptions were fabricated or not. Contrary to their hypothesis, they found that depressed people have a more realistic view of the world, the qualities they obtain, and the control they have over situations in their life. It was proposed by psychologists Shelley Taylor and Jonathon Brown that the majority of people in normal-functioning mental states display and are instilled with [[positive illusions]] including:<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:*overestimating their own good qualities\n:*their control over happenings in their life\n:*an unrealistic portrayal of optimism<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:Positive illusions remain constant for the majority of one's life due to self-deception. '''[[Self-deception]]''' strategies are mental tricks of a person's mind that hide the truth and constitute false beliefs. Due to self-deception, people are able to obtain resiliency upon negative events that might occur throughout life. This also can reinforce different ideas or thoughts that the person wishes and hopes for. The [[self-serving bias]] is a strategy in which a person titles acknowledgment for success and rejects blame for failure. For example, a person who wins a track meet would glorify their ability as an athlete. However, if that person were to come in last in the meet, the person would most likely put blame on constituting factors such as a muscle cramp or previous injury preventing a good performance. Another strategy that people use is greater criticism involving bad feedback rather than good. A person would judge a situation more harshly when they did worse, while the opposite would occur for a situation that entailed good feedback.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n===Interpersonal self===\nInterpersonal self can also be referred to as your public self. This feature allows for social connection to others. With the interpersonal self, a person is able to display themselves to the others around them. Interpersonal self is apparent in situations of self-presentation, being a group member or partner in a relationship, a person's social roles, and their reputation. For example, a person might show confidence and determination in their work atmosphere, whereas they show more of their emotional and nurturing side in their romantic relationship.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nSocial roles are defined as the parts that a person plays in different situations and with other people. Our roles change in order to fit the \"expected\" behaviors in various scenarios. For example, a person may be a mother, a doctor, a wife, and daughter. Her behavior would most likely change in her transition from being a doctor to coming home to her daughter.<ref name=\"Social Roles and Social Norms\">[http://www.simplypsychology.org/social-roles.html McLeod, S. A. (2008). Social Roles and Social Norms. Retrieved from simplypsychology.org]</ref>\n\nSocial norms constitute the \"unwritten rules\" that we have about how to act in certain scenarios and with various people in our lives. For example, when a person is in a classroom, they are more likely to be quiet and attentive; whereas at a party, they are more likely to be socially engaged and standing. Norms act as guidelines that shape our behavior. Without them, there would not be any order, as well as lack of understanding in situations in society.<ref name=\"Social Roles and Social Norms\"/>\n\n===Agent self===\nThe agent self is known as the executive function that allows for actions. This is how we, as individuals, make choices and utilize our control in situations and actions. The agent self resides over everything that involves decision making, self-control, taking charge in situations, and actively responding. A person might desire to eat unhealthy foods, however it is their agent self that allows that person to choose to avoid eating them and make a healthier food choice.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n{{Main|Outline of self}}\n*[[Identity (social science)]]\n*[['I' and the 'me']]\n*[[Personality psychology|Personality]]\n*[[Self-concept]]\n*[[Self-discovery]]\n*[[Self-schema]]\n*[[Self (philosophy)]]\n*[[Self psychology]]\n*[[Self (sociology)]]\n*[[Ego (spirituality)]]\n*[[Ho'oponopono]]\n*[[Dialogical self]]\n*[[Reflexive self-consciousness]]\n*[[Future self]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wilderdom.com/self Definitions of Various Self Constructs] - Self-esteem, self-efficacy, self-confidence & self-concept.\n*[http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/self.htm Discussion of Self] \u2013 Page of the Emotional Competency website.\n*[http://iautistic.com/autism-theory-of-mind-revisited.php Theory of Self] - Proposed by an autistic to explain autism\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=OE0yeuILAlMC&pg=PA1 Images of the Self]\n*[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/false-self False self]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Self (Psychology)}}\n[[Category:Self|*]]\n[[Category:Conceptions of self|Psychological]]\n[[Category:Ego psychology]]\n[[Category:Personal development]]\n\n[[cs:Bytostn\u00e9 j\u00e1]]\n[[da:Selvet (psykologi)]]\n[[fr:Soi (psychologie)]]\n[[ja:\u81ea\u5df1]]\n[[sk:Selbst]]\n[[sr:\u0408\u0430]]\n[[sv:Sj\u00e4lvet]]\n[[yi:\u05d6\u05e2\u05d9\u05dc]]\n[[zh:\u81ea\u6027]]\n", "name_user": "Esponenziale", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eKohut's formulation:Added wikilink totransference", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology_of_self"}

In the Caribbean, roti is commonly eaten as an accompaniment to various curries and stews. The traditional way of eating roti is to break the roti by hand, using it to sop up sauce and pieces of meat from the curry. However, in the Caribbean, the term roti may refer to both the flatbread (roti) itself and the more popular [[street food]] item, in which the roti is folded around a savory filling in the form of a wrap.\n\nThe [[Wrap roti|roti wrap]] is the commercialization of roti and curry together as a fast-food or street-food item in the Caribbean. This wrap form of roti originated in southern Trinidad. It was first created in the mid-1940s by Sackina Karamath, who later founded Hummingbird Roti Shop in [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago]]. The wrap was convenient, as the meal could be eaten faster and while on the go, as well as keeping one's hands from getting dirty. In Trinidad and Tobago, various wrapped roti are served, including chicken, conch, goat, beef, and shrimp. Vegetables can also be added including potato, pumpkin, and spinach as well a variety of local condiments, with pepper sauce (hot sauce) and mango [[chutney]] being the most popular. The roti wrap quickly gained popularity across the island and spread throughout the rest of the Caribbean.  The wrap is now simply referred to as a roti or just roti.  The growth in popularity has recently led to referring to the flatbread itself (roti) that surrounds the filling as a \"roti skin\" or \"roti shell\", a practice that is now common in both restaurants and commercial companies. Various types of roti are eaten throughout the West Indies. They are most prominently featured in the diets of people in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Jamaica, and Suriname. Caribbean-style roti is primarily made from wheat flour, baking powder, salt, and water, and cooked on a ''tawa''. Certain rotis are also made with [[ghee]] or butter.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Roti in Trinidad and the [[Leeward Islands]]\n!Food\n!Image\n!Description\n|-\n|Sada roti\n|\n|This is a plain roti, made of white flour.

This gives the roti a crisp outside and small patches of light browning. When the roti is almost finished cooking, the cook begins to beat the roti while it is on the tawa, causing it to become light and flaky. ''Paratha roti'' is more rich and flavorful than plain roti. ''Paratha'' is enjoyed with almost any accompaniment. As with other rotis, it is commonly eaten with curries and stews. It is also traditionally eaten with fried eggs or egg dishes and a cup of tea. In Trinidad, ''parathas'' are colloquially called \"buss-up shut\" (\"busted-up shirt\") because the roti resembles a tattered and torn-up shirt.\n|-\n|[[Puri (food)|Puri]]\n|[[File:Poori.jpg|145px]]\n|This is a roti where two layers are rolled out together and cooked on the ''[[tava]]''.

The cumin is toasted until black and also ground. The stuffing is pushed into the roti dough, and sealed. When rolled flat, the filling is distributed within the roti. It is cooked on the ''tava'' and rubbed with oil for ease of cooking. This type of roti is most commonly eaten with a variety of curries. It is also the roti of choice for the making of wrap rotis.\n|-\n|[[Wrap roti]]\n|[[File:Lamb Roti Rolls.jpg|145px]]\n|A popular wrap made by folding a combination of meat and vegetable curries inside of a dhalpuri roti: The curry or stew often contains potatoes and/or chickpeas as a filler as well as the essential meat component, although vegetarian options are common as well. Popular fillings include curried chicken, goat, conch, duck, beef, shrimp, and vegetable. An assortment of optional condiments are also common such as pepper sauce and mango chutney.\n|-\n|Aloopuri\n|\n|A roti similar to a ''dhalpuri'', but with ''aloo'' (potato) substituted for the ''dhal''. The ''aloo'' is boiled and milled, and spices and seasonings are added before being sealed in the dough.

ROTI Table 1 shows the differences between eight different types of roti as used by Indo-Guyanese: paratha, dosti, cassava, daalpuri, aluu, chotha, puri and sada.\"<ref>{{cite book | last=Rickford | first=J.R. | title=A Festival of Guyanese Words | publisher=University of Guyana | year=1978 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdAuAAAAYAAJ | access-date=9 February 2018 | page=127}}</ref>}} A small amount of fat is placed in each piece of dough before it is rolled out to make the roti softer. Usually, [[vegetable oil]] is used, but butter, or [[margarine]] can also be used. Ghee is not used in everyday cooking, but is used on special occasions, especially amongst Hindus. The roti is usually clapped by hand or beaten a bit, hot off the ''tava'', so it softens but does not break.\n* A good roti in Guyana is very soft, with layers (almost like [[pastry]] layers if possible), which remains whole.\n* The type of roti is determined by what is placed in the dough before it is rolled out. Various types include ''dhalpuri, aloo'' (potato) roti, and even sugar (to keep the kids busy, while the mother finishes cooking).\n* In Guyana, a rolled-out, thin, flat dough like a roti that is deep-fried in ghee is called a [[Puri (food)|''puri'']]. Therefore, a ''dhalpuri'' is not really a puri.\n* Another item prepared like roti is bake or bakes or floats. A Guyanese or Trinidadian fry bake seems to be more similar to an Indian puri. A bake is made with butter or margarine and has a different ratio of flour to fat. It is made much quicker than roti and is usually made in the mornings. Dough is rolled out and cut into shapes or rolled into small rounds. Guyanese bakes are fried, but bakes from other parts of the West Indies can be baked in an oven. Bakes are usually paired with a quick [[Full English breakfast|fry-up]] for breakfast or dinner, [[stewing|stewed]] saltfish, or eggs (\"western\" style, with onions, tomatoes, green peppers). Bakes are also made in other parts of the West Indies, including Trinidad, Barbados, and St. Vincent. In Trinidad and Tobago, a \"bake and shark\" is a popular street-food sandwich in which fried shark is placed between two halves of a sliced bake with local condiments. Pepper sauce, ''shado beni'', [[garlic sauce]], tamarind, and mango chutney are most common, as well as lettuce, tomato, and cucumber for fillers.\n\n====Suriname====\nIn Suriname, roti refers mainly to ''dhalpuri'' or ''aloo puri''. It is most often eaten with curried chicken. As in Trinidad and the West Indies, roti can also refer to the stuffed roti wrap. This dish is usually eaten out of hand. Due to a mass emigration of Indian Surinamese in the 1970s, roti became a popular [[take-out]] dish in the Netherlands. It usually includes chicken [[curry]], potatoes, a boiled egg, and various vegetables, most notably the ''kousenband'' or [[yardlong bean]]. Another variation includes shrimp and [[aubergine]]. The meat with gravy, potatoes, egg, and yardlong beans are served side by side on a plate, with the ''aloo puri'' folded in fours on top. <!-- lots of options, why list this?, uncited One then has the option to spice the dish with a very hot chutney made of [[Madame Jeanette]] pepper. -->\n===Southeast Asia===\n[[File:Roti kluai khai chiang mai 04.jpg|thumb|A Thai \"\u0e42\u0e23\u0e15\u0e35\u0e01\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22\u0e44\u0e02\u0e48 /r\u0252ti\u02d0 kl\u00fbaj k\u02b0\u00e0j/\": roti with banana and egg, drizzled with sweetened condensed milk]]\nIn [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], the term encompasses all forms of bread, including Western-style bread, as well as the traditional [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] breads.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=63wtZx7UAucC&pg=PT4&dq=%22Roti%22+-wikipedia&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi34tGo2cblAhUGmeAKHaIeAF8Q6AEIUjAG#v=onepage&q=%22Roti%22+-wikipedia&f=false|title=Roti manis & donat|first=Haryanto|last=Makmoer|date=10 April 2003|publisher=Gramedia Pustaka Utama|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Thailand]], \u0e42\u0e23\u0e15\u0e35 refers to the [[Maida flour|''maida'']] ''[[paratha]]''\u2014known in Indonesia as ''roti maryam, [[roti cane]]'', or ''[[roti konde]]'', in [[Malaysia]] as ''[[roti canai]]'', and in Singapore as ''[[roti prata]]''.\n\n===South Africa===\nRoti was initially introduced to South Africa by Indian migrants during the 19th century, and subsequently became incorporated into [[Durban]] cuisine.

Owing to Canada's considerable immigrant populations from both South Asia and the Caribbean, roti and its variants are popular there.

In the Caribbean, roti is commonly eaten as an accompaniment to various curries and stews. The traditional way of eating roti is to break the roti by hand, using it to sop up sauce and pieces of meat from the curry. However, in the Caribbean, the term roti may refer to both the flatbread (roti) itself and the more popular [[street food]] item, in which the roti is folded around a savory filling in the form of a wrap.\n\nThe [[Wrap roti|roti wrap]] is the commercialization of roti and curry together as a fast-food or street-food item in the Caribbean. This wrap form of roti originated in southern Trinidad. It was first created in the mid-1940s by Sackina Karamath, who later founded Hummingbird Roti Shop in [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago]]. The wrap was convenient, as the meal could be eaten faster and while on the go, as well as keeping one's hands from getting dirty. In Trinidad and Tobago, various wrapped roti are served, including chicken, conch, goat, beef, and shrimp. Vegetables can also be added including potato, pumpkin, and spinach as well a variety of local condiments, with pepper sauce (hot sauce) and mango [[chutney]] being the most popular. The roti wrap quickly gained popularity across the island and spread throughout the rest of the Caribbean.  The wrap is now simply referred to as a roti or just roti.  The growth in popularity has recently led to referring to the flatbread itself (roti) that surrounds the filling as a \"roti skin\" or \"roti shell\", a practice that is now common in both restaurants and commercial companies. Various types of roti are eaten throughout the West Indies. They are most prominently featured in the diets of people in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Jamaica, and Suriname. Caribbean-style roti is primarily made from wheat flour, baking powder, salt, and water, and cooked on a ''tawa''.

This gives the roti a crisp outside and small patches of light browning. When the roti is almost finished cooking, the cook begins to beat the roti while it is on the tawa, causing it to become light and flaky. ''Paratha roti'' is more rich and flavorful than plain roti. ''Paratha'' is enjoyed with almost any accompaniment. As with other rotis, it is commonly eaten with curries and stews. It is also traditionally eaten with fried eggs or egg dishes and a cup of tea. In Trinidad, ''parathas'' are colloquially called \"buss-up shut\" (\"busted-up shirt\") because the roti resembles a tattered and torn-up shirt.\n|-\n|[[Puri (food)|Puri]]\n|[[File:Poori.jpg|145px]]\n|This is a roti where two layers are rolled out together and cooked on the ''[[tava]]''.

ROTI Table 1 shows the differences between eight different types of roti as used by Indo-Guyanese: paratha, dosti, cassava, daalpuri, aluu, chotha, puri and sada.\"<ref>{{cite book | last=Rickford | first=J.R. | title=A Festival of Guyanese Words | publisher=University of Guyana | year=1978 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdAuAAAAYAAJ | access-date=9 February 2018 | page=127}}</ref>}} A small amount of fat is placed in each piece of dough before it is rolled out to make the roti softer. Usually, [[vegetable oil]] is used, but butter, or [[margarine]] can also be used. Ghee is not used in everyday cooking, but is used on special occasions, especially amongst Hindus. The roti is usually clapped by hand or beaten a bit, hot off the ''tava'', so it softens but does not break.\n* A good roti in Guyana is very soft, with layers (almost like [[pastry]] layers if possible), which remains whole.\n* The type of roti is determined by what is placed in the dough before it is rolled out. Various types include ''dhalpuri, aloo'' (potato) roti, and even sugar (to keep the kids busy, while the mother finishes cooking).\n* In Guyana, a rolled-out, thin, flat dough like a roti that is deep-fried in ghee is called a [[Puri (food)|''puri'']]. Therefore, a ''dhalpuri'' is not really a puri.\n* Another item prepared like roti is bake or bakes or floats. A Guyanese or Trinidadian fry bake seems to be more similar to an Indian puri. A bake is made with butter or margarine and has a different ratio of flour to fat. It is made much quicker than roti and is usually made in the mornings. Dough is rolled out and cut into shapes or rolled into small rounds. Guyanese bakes are fried, but bakes from other parts of the West Indies can be baked in an oven. Bakes are usually paired with a quick [[Full English breakfast|fry-up]] for breakfast or dinner, [[stewing|stewed]] saltfish, or eggs (\"western\" style, with onions, tomatoes, green peppers). Bakes are also made in other parts of the West Indies, including Trinidad, Barbados, and St. Vincent. In Trinidad and Tobago, a \"bake and shark\" is a popular street-food sandwich in which fried shark is placed between two halves of a sliced bake with local condiments. Pepper sauce, ''shado beni'', [[garlic sauce]], tamarind, and mango chutney are most common, as well as lettuce, tomato, and cucumber for fillers.\n\n====Suriname====\nIn Suriname, roti refers mainly to ''dhalpuri'' or ''aloo puri''. It is most often eaten with curried chicken. As in Trinidad and the West Indies, roti can also refer to the stuffed roti wrap. This dish is usually eaten out of hand. Due to a mass emigration of Indian Surinamese in the 1970s, roti became a popular [[take-out]] dish in the Netherlands. It usually includes chicken [[curry]], potatoes, a boiled egg, and various vegetables, most notably the ''kousenband'' or [[yardlong bean]]. Another variation includes shrimp and [[aubergine]]. The meat with gravy, potatoes, egg, and yardlong beans are served side by side on a plate, with the ''aloo puri'' folded in fours on top. <!-- lots of options, why list this?, uncited One then has the option to spice the dish with a very hot chutney made of [[Madame Jeanette]] pepper. -->\n===Southeast Asia===\n[[File:Roti kluai khai chiang mai 04.jpg|thumb|A Thai \"\u0e42\u0e23\u0e15\u0e35\u0e01\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22\u0e44\u0e02\u0e48 /r\u0252ti\u02d0 kl\u00fbaj k\u02b0\u00e0j/\": roti with banana and egg, drizzled with sweetened condensed milk]]\nIn [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], the term encompasses all forms of bread, including Western-style bread, as well as the traditional [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] breads.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=63wtZx7UAucC&pg=PT4&dq=%22Roti%22+-wikipedia&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi34tGo2cblAhUGmeAKHaIeAF8Q6AEIUjAG#v=onepage&q=%22Roti%22+-wikipedia&f=false|title=Roti manis & donat|first=Haryanto|last=Makmoer|date=10 April 2003|publisher=Gramedia Pustaka Utama|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Thailand]], \u0e42\u0e23\u0e15\u0e35 refers to the [[Maida flour|''maida'']] ''[[paratha]]''\u2014known in Indonesia as ''roti maryam, [[roti cane]]'', or ''[[roti konde]]'', in [[Malaysia]] as ''[[roti canai]]'', and in Singapore as ''[[roti prata]]''.\n\n===South Africa===\nRoti was initially introduced to South Africa by Indian migrants during the 19th century, and subsequently became incorporated into [[Durban]] cuisine.

Owing to Canada's considerable immigrant populations from both South Asia and the Caribbean, roti and its variants are popular there. As [[Indo-Caribbeans]] moved to North American cities such as Toronto, New York City, Miami, Los Angeles, and Montreal, they exported with them the wrapped version of roti.

The proIAPP acts as a seed, collecting matured IAPP within the vesicles, forming intracellular amyloid. When the vesicles are released, the amyloid grows as it collects even more IAPP outside the cell. The overall effect is an apoptosis cascade initiated by the influx of ions into the \u03b2-cells.\n\n[[Image:Amyloid Formation.jpg|thumb|General Scheme for Amyloid Formation]]\n\nIn summary, impaired N-terminal processing of proIAPP is an important factor initiating amyloid formation and \u03b2-cell death.

However, it is still unclear as to whether amyloid formation is involved in or merely a consequence of type 2 diabetes.<ref name=Marzban2006 />  Nevertheless, it is clear that amyloid formation reduces working \u03b2-cells in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

The overall effect is to slow the rate of appearance (Ra) of glucose in the blood after eating; this is accomplished via coordinate slowing down gastric emptying, inhibition of digestive secretion [gastric acid, pancreatic enzymes, and bile ejection], and a resulting reduction in food intake. Appearance of new glucose in the blood is reduced by inhibiting secretion of the gluconeogenic hormone [[glucagon]]. These actions, which are mostly carried out via a glucose-sensitive part of the brain stem, the [[area postrema]], may be over-ridden during hypoglycemia.

The Taurini chief town (''Taurasia'') was captured by Hannibal's forces after a three-day siege.<ref>[[Polybius]] iii. 60, 8</ref> As a people they are rarely mentioned in history. It is believed that a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] colony was established after 28 BC under the name of ''Julia Augusta Taurinorum'' (modern Turin). Both [[Livy]]<ref>v. 34</ref> and [[Strabo]]<ref>iv. p.&nbsp;209</ref> mention the Taurini's country as including one of the passes of the [[Alps]], which points to a wider use of the name in earlier times.\n\n=== Roman era ===\nIn the 1st century BC (probably 28 BC), the Romans founded  ''Augusta Taurinorum''. The typical Roman street grid can still be seen in the modern city, especially in the neighbourhood known as the ''Quadrilatero Romano'' (Roman Quadrilateral). Via Garibaldi traces the exact path of the Roman city's [[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]] which began at the ''Porta Decumani'', later incorporated into the ''Castello'' or ''Palazzo Madama''. The ''Porta Palatina'', on the north side of the current city centre, is still preserved in a park near the Cathedral. Remains of the Roman-period [[Roman theatre (structure)| theatre]] are preserved in the area of the ''Manica Nuova''. Turin reached about 5,000 inhabitants at the time, all living inside the high city walls.\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n[[File:Arduino d'ivrea.jpg|thumb|right|[[Arduin of Italy|Arduin d'Ivrea]].]]\nAfter the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the town was conquered by the [[Heruli]] and the [[Ostrogoths]], recaptured by the [[Byzantine Empire|Romans]], but then conquered again by the [[Lombards]] and then the [[Franks]] of [[Charlemagne]] (773). The ''[[March of Turin|Contea di Torino]]'' (countship) was founded in the 940s and was held by the [[Arduin of Italy|Arduinic]] dynasty until 1050. After the marriage of [[Adelaide of Susa]] with [[Humbert I, Count of Savoy|Humbert Biancamano]]'s son [[Otto, Count of Savoy|Otto]], the family of the [[House of Savoy|Counts of Savoy]] gained control. While the title of count was held by the Bishop as count of [[County of Turin|Turin]] (1092\u20131130 and 1136\u20131191) it was ruled as a [[Prince-Bishop|prince-bishopric]] by the Bishops. In 1230\u20131235 it was a lordship under the [[List of rulers of Montferrat|Marquess of Montferrat]], styled Lord of Turin. At the end of the 13th century, when it was annexed to the Duchy of Savoy, the city already had 20,000 inhabitants. Many of the gardens and palaces were built in the 15th century when the city was redesigned. The [[University of Turin]] was also founded during this period.\n\n=== Early modern ===\n[[File:Torino 1500-1600 vista dall'alto.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Turin in the 17th century.]]\n[[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy|Emmanuel Philibert]], also known under the nickname of ''Iron Head'' (Testa 'd Fer), made Turin the capital of the Duchy of Savoy in 1563. Piazza Reale (named [[Piazza San Carlo]] today) and Via Nuova (current Via Roma) were added along with the first enlargement of the walls, in the first half of the 17th century; in the same period the ''Palazzo Reale'' ([[Royal Palace of Turin]]) was also built. In the second half of that century, a second enlargement of the walls was planned and executed, with the building of the arcaded Via Po, connecting Piazza Castello with the bridge on the Po through the regular street grid.\n\nIn 1706, during the [[Battle of Turin]], the French besieged the city for 117 days without conquering it. By the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] the Duke of Savoy acquired [[Sicily]], soon traded for [[Sardinia]], and part of the former [[Duchy of Milan]], and was elevated to king; thus Turin became the capital of a European kingdom. The architect [[Filippo Juvarra]] began a major redesign of the city; Turin had about 90,000 inhabitants at the time.\n\n=== Late modern and contemporary ===\n[[File:Maggi, Giovanni Battista - Torino - Panorama.jpg|thumb|left|A view of Turin in the late 19th century. In the background, the [[Mole Antonelliana]] under construction.]]\n\nTurin, like the rest of [[Piedmont]], was annexed by the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] in 1802. The city thus became the seat of the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of [[P\u00f4 (department)|P\u00f4]] [[Departments of France|department]] until the fall of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] in 1814, when the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia was restored with Turin as its capital. In the following decades, the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia led the struggle towards the [[Italian unification|unification of Italy]]. In 1861, Turin became the capital of the newly proclaimed united [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italiansrus.com/articles/torinohistory_part4.htm |title=Turin's History |publisher=Italianrus.com. Anthony Parenti |accessdate=9 May 2010}}</ref> until 1865, when the capital was moved to [[Florence]], and then to [[Rome]] after the 1870 conquest of the [[Papal States]]. The 1871 opening of the [[Fr\u00e9jus Rail Tunnel|Fr\u00e9jus Tunnel]] made Turin an important communication node between Italy and France. The city in that period had 250,000 inhabitants. Some of the most iconic landmarks of the city, like the [[Mole Antonelliana]], the [[Museo Egizio|Egyptian Museum]], the [[Gran Madre di Dio, Turin|Gran Madre di Dio church]] and ''Piazza Vittorio Veneto'' were built in this period. The late 19th century was also a period of rapid industrialization, especially in the automotive sector: in 1899 [[Fiat]] was established in the city, followed by [[Lancia]] in 1906. The [[Prima Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa Moderna|Universal Exposition]] held in Turin in 1902 is often regarded as the pinnacle of [[Art Nouveau]] design, and the city hosted the same event in [[Turin International|1911]]. By this time, Turin had grown to 430,000 inhabitants.\n[[File:19TorinoGranMadreDio.JPG|thumb|[[Gran Madre di Dio, Turin|Gran Madre di Dio]].]]\n\nAfter [[World War I]], harsh conditions brought a wave of strikes and workers' protests. In 1920 the [[Lingotto]] Fiat factory was occupied. The Fascist regime put an end to the social unrest, banning trade unions and jailing socialist leaders, notably [[Antonio Gramsci]]. On the other hand, [[Benito Mussolini]] largely subsidised the automotive industry, to provide vehicles to the army. \n\nTurin [[Bombing of Turin in World War II|was then a target of Allied strategic bombing during World War II]], being heavily damaged by the air raids in its industrial areas as well as in the city centre. Along with [[Milan]], [[Genoa]], and [[La Spezia]], Turin was one of Italy's four cities that experienced [[area bombing]] by the RAF; the heaviest raid took place on 13 July 1943, when 295 bombers dropped 763 tons of bombs, killing 792 people.<ref>[http://www.museotorino.it/view/s/3e6222e913ac45a49cbd7f81960f1cc7 Museotorino - Bombardamento 13 luglio 1943]</ref> Overall, these raids killed 2,069 inhabitants of Turin, and destroyed or damaged 54 % of all buildings in the city.<ref>[http://www.istoreto.it/torino38-45/download/torino38-45.pdf TORINO 1938|45.

Turin was not captured by the Allies until the end of [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|Spring Offensive of 1945]]. By the time the vanguard of the armoured reconnaissance units of [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] reached the city, it was already freed by the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian Partisans]], that had begun revolting against the Germans on 25 April 1945. Days later, troops from the US Army's [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored]] and [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd Infantry Divisions]] came to substitute the Brazilians.<ref>[[Willis D. Crittenberger]], \"The final campaign across Italy\"; year of edition 1952 {{ISBN|85-7011-219-X}}</ref><ref>[[Mascarenhas de Moraes]], ''The Brazilian Expeditionary Force, By Its Commander'' US Government Printing Office, 1966. ASIN B000PIBXCG</ref>\n\nIn the postwar years, Turin was rapidly rebuilt. The city's automotive industry played a pivotal role in the [[Italian economic miracle]] of the 1950s and 1960s, attracting hundreds of thousands of immigrants to the city, particularly from the rural southern regions of Italy. The number of immigrants was so big that Turin was said to be \"the third southern Italian city after [[Naples]] and [[Palermo]]\". The population soon reached 1 million in 1960 and peaked at almost 1.2 million in 1971. The exceptional growth gains of the city gained it the nickname of ''the Automobile Capital of Italy'' and ''the [[Detroit]] of Italy'' (Turin has been \"twinned\" with Detroit since 1998). In the 1970s and 1980s, the oil and automotive industry crisis severely hit the city, and its population began to sharply decline, losing more than one-fourth of its total in 30 years. The long population decline of the city has begun to reverse itself only in recent years, as the population grew from 865,000 to slightly over 900,000 by the end of the century. In 2006, Turin hosted the [[2006 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympic Games]].\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Torino panorama Superga.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|left|Turin today]]\nTurin is located in [[northwest Italy]]. It is surrounded on the western and northern front by the Alps and on the eastern front by a high hill that is the natural continuation of the hills of [[Montferrat|Monferrato]]. Four major rivers pass through the city: the Po and three of its tributaries, the [[Dora Riparia]] (once known as ''Duria Minor'' by the Romans, from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] noun ''duria'' meaning \"water\"), the [[Stura di Lanzo]] and the [[Sangone (torrent)|Sangone]].\n\n=== Climate ===\nTurin features a European-[[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfa''), as does most of northern Italy. \n\nWinters are moderately cold and dry, summers are mild in the hills and quite hot in the plains. Rain falls mostly during spring and autumn; during the hottest months, otherwise, rains are less frequent but heavier (thunderstorms are frequent). During the winter and autumn months banks of fog, which are sometimes very thick, form in the plains<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.torino.it/canaleturismo/en/clima.htm |title=Torino Turistica \u2013 Servizio Telematico Pubblico \u2013 Citt\u00e0 di Torino |publisher=Comune.torino.it |accessdate=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429121444/http://www.comune.torino.it/canaleturismo/en/clima.htm |archivedate=29 April 2009}}</ref> but rarely on the city because of its location at the end of the [[Susa Valley]].\n\nIts position on the east side of the [[Alps]] makes the weather drier than on the west side because of the [[f\u00f6hn wind]] effect.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|37.1|C|F}}, while the lowest was {{convert|-21.8|C|F}}.\n{{Weather box\n|width = 100%\n|location = Torino (Giardini Reali), 1971\u20132000 normals, extremes 1946\u2013present\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 25.1\n|Feb record high C = 26.6\n|Mar record high C = 27.4\n|Apr record high C = 31.0\n|May record high C = 32.3\n|Jun record high C = 35.6\n|Jul record high C = 36.8\n|Aug record high C = 37.1\n|Sep record high C = 32.2\n|Oct record high C = 30.0\n|Nov record high C = 22.8\n|Dec record high C = 21.4\n|year record high C = 37.1\n|Jan high C = 6.6\n|Feb high C = 9.1\n|Mar high C = 13.4\n|Apr high C = 16.6\n|May high C = 20.7\n|Jun high C = 24.8\n|Jul high C = 27.9\n|Aug high C = 27.1\n|Sep high C = 23.0\n|Oct high C = 17.3\n|Nov high C = 11.1\n|Dec high C = 7.6\n|year high C = 17.1\n|Jan mean C = 2.0\n|Feb mean C = 4.3\n|Mar mean C = 8.1\n|Apr mean C = 11.1\n|May mean C = 15.5\n|Jun mean C = 19.4\n|Jul mean C = 22.4\n|Aug mean C = 21.8\n|Sep mean C = 17.8\n|Oct mean C = 12.4\n|Nov mean C = 6.5\n|Dec mean C = 3.1\n|year mean C = 12.0\n|Jan low C = -2.5\n|Feb low C = -0.7\n|Mar low C = 2.7\n|Apr low C = 5.7\n|May low C = 10.4\n|Jun low C = 14.0\n|Jul low C = 16.9\n|Aug low C = 16.5\n|Sep low C = 12.7\n|Oct low C = 7.4\n|Nov low C = 1.9\n|Dec low C = -1.6\n|year low C = 7.0\n|Jan record low C = -18.5\n|Feb record low C = -21.8\n|Mar record low C = -10.5\n|Apr record low C = -3.8\n|May record low C = -2.3\n|Jun record low C = 4.3\n|Jul record low C = 6.6\n|Aug record low C = 6.3\n|Sep record low C = 1.8\n|Oct record low C = -3.9\n|Nov record low C = -8.2\n|Dec record low C = -13.8\n|year record low C = -21.8\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 47.8\n|Feb precipitation mm = 47.1\n|Mar precipitation mm = 72.5\n|Apr precipitation mm = 113.3\n|May precipitation mm = 145.3\n|Jun precipitation mm = 104.3\n|Jul precipitation mm = 70.5\n|Aug precipitation mm = 76.1\n|Sep precipitation mm = 83.8\n|Oct precipitation mm = 106.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 69.1\n|Dec precipitation mm = 45.1\n|year precipitation mm = 981.0\n|Jan humidity = 75\n|Feb humidity = 75\n|Mar humidity = 67\n|Apr humidity = 72\n|May humidity = 75\n|Jun humidity = 74\n|Jul humidity = 72\n|Aug humidity = 73\n|Sep humidity = 75\n|Oct humidity = 79\n|Nov humidity = 80\n|Dec humidity = 80\n|year humidity = 75\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 5.4\n|Feb precipitation days = 4.4\n|Mar precipitation days = 5.8\n|Apr precipitation days = 8.6\n|May precipitation days = 11.2\n|Jun precipitation days = 8.6\n|Jul precipitation days = 5.8\n|Aug precipitation days = 7.7\n|Sep precipitation days = 6.4\n|Oct precipitation days = 7.0\n|Nov precipitation days = 5.6\n|Dec precipitation days = 4.4\n|year precipitation days = 80.9\n|Jan sun = 111.6\n|Feb sun = 118.7\n|Mar sun = 158.1\n|Apr sun = 180.0\n|May sun = 195.3\n|Jun sun = 219.0\n|Jul sun = 260.4\n|Aug sun = 223.2\n|Sep sun = 168.0\n|Oct sun = 142.6\n|Nov sun = 105.0\n|Dec sun = 108.5\n|year sun = 1990.4\n|source 1 = Italian Air Force Meteorological Service<ref name=MAM>{{cite web\n|url = http://clima.meteoam.it/AtlanteClim2/pdf/(059)Torino%20Caselle.pdf\n|title = Torino/Caselle (TO)\n|work = Atlante climatico\n|publisher = Servizio Meteorologico\n|accessdate = 11 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://clima.meteoam.it/web_clima_sysman/Clino6190/CLINO059.txt\n|title = STAZIONE  059-TORINO CASELLE: medie mensili periodo  61 \u2013 90\n|publisher = Servizio Meteorologico\n|language = Italian\n|accessdate = 11 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://climaintoscana.altervista.org/italia/stazioni-wmo/torino-caselle/\n|title = Torino Caselle: Record mensili dal 1946\n|publisher = Servizio Meteorologico dell\u2019Aeronautica Militare\n|language = Italian\n|accessdate = 11 December 2014}}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n{{Weather box    \n| width        = 100% <!-- 77% if there is a template or image next to it -->\n| collapsed    = y <!-- y, if you have normal updates -->\n| open         = \n| metric first = y <!-- always, except UK or US cities -->\n| single line  = y\n| location     = Turin ([[Italian Air Force]] -

Nonetheless the main street of the city centre, ''Via Roma'', was built during the Fascist era (from 1931 to 1937) as an example of [[Italian Rationalism]], replacing former buildings already present in this area.\n\nVia Roma runs between [[Piazza Carlo Felice]] and [[Piazza Castello, Turin|Piazza Castello]]. Buildings on the portion between Piazza Carlo Felice and [[Piazza San Carlo]] were designed by rationalist architect [[Marcello Piacentini]]. These blocks were built into a reticular system, composed by austere buildings in clear rationalist style, such as the impressive ''Hotel Principi di Piemonte'' and the former ''Hotel Nazionale'' in ''Piazza CLN''. Porches are built in a continuous [[entablature]] and marked with double columns, to be consistent with those of Piazza San Carlo. The section of the street between Piazza San Carlo and Piazza Castello was built in eclectic style, with arcades characterised by [[Serliana]]-type arches. To this day Via Roma is the street featuring the most fashionable boutiques of the city.\n\n[[File:Torino - Caval \u00ebd Brons latoB.jpg|thumb|right|''Piazza San Carlo'' and the ''Caval 'd Brons'' (Bronze Horse in Piedmontese language) equestrian monument to [[Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Savoy|Emmanuel Philibert]].]]\n\nVia Roma crosses one of the main squares of the city: the pedestrianized Piazza San Carlo, built by [[Carlo di Castellamonte]] in the 17th century. In the middle of the square stands the equestrian monument to [[Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Savoy|Emmanuel Philibert]], also known as ''Caval \u00ebd Brons'' in local dialect (\"Bronze Horse\"); the monument depicts the Duke sheathing his sword after the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Battle of St. Quentin]]. Piazza San Carlo arcades host the most ancient caf\u00e9s of the city, such as ''Caff\u00e9 Torino'' and ''Caff\u00e9 San Carlo''.\n\n[[File:529TorinoPalazzoReale.JPG|thumb|left|''Piazza Castello'' with [[Royal Palace of Turin|Palazzo Reale]] (Royal Palace) in the background.]]\n\nOn the northern edge of Via Roma stands ''Piazza Castello'', regarded as the heart of the city. The half-pedestrianized square hosts some significant buildings such as ''Palazzo Reale'' (Former Savoy Royal House), the ''Palazzo Madama'' (which previously hosted the Savoy senate and, for few years, the Italian senate after Italian unification), the former Baroque [[Teatro Regio di Torino]] (rebuilt in modern style in the 1960s, after being destroyed by fire), the [[Royal Library of Turin]] which hosts the [[Portrait of a man in red chalk (Leonardo)|Leonardo da Vinci self-portrait]], and the baroque [[San Lorenzo, Turin|Royal Church of San Lorenzo]]. Moreover, Piazza Castello hosts a Fascist era building, the [[Torre Littoria]], a sort of skyscraper which was supposed to become the headquarters of the Fascist party, although it never served as such. The building's style is quite different from the Baroque style of Piazza Castello. The square regularly hosts the main open space events of the city, live concerts included.\n\n[[File:Porta Nuova Piazza Carlo Felice Torino.JPG|thumb|left|''Porta Nuova'' main railway station, in front of ''Piazza Carlo Felice'' square (before restyling).]]\n\nAs for the southern part of the street, Via Roma ends in ''Piazza Carlo Felice'' and in its ''Giardino Sambuy'', a wide fenced garden right in the middle of the square. Across from Piazza Carlo Felice stands the monumental fa\u00e7ade of [[Torino Porta Nuova railway station|Porta Nuova railway station]], the central station of the city built between 1861 and 1868 by the architect Alessandro Mazzucchetti. The passengers building was  renovated to host a shopping mall and more efficient passenger service offices. However, it is still an example of monumental architecture, with its stately foyer and some Baroque sights, such as the ''Sala Reale'' (the former Royal waiting room).\n\n[[File:Torino, piazza Vittorio Veneto (04).jpg|thumb|right|''Piazza Vittorio Veneto'' square.]]\n\nIn ''Piazza Castello'' converge some of the main streets of the city centre. Among them one of the most significant is the arcaded ''Via Po'', built by [[Amedeo di Castellamonte]] in 1868 and featuring some interesting buildings, such as the first and original building of the [[University of Turin]] and the historical [[Caff\u00e8 Fiorio]], which was the favourite caf\u00e9 of the 19th-century politicians. Via Po ends in [[Piazza Vittorio Veneto, Turin|Piazza Vittorio Veneto]] (simply called Piazza Vittorio locally), the largest Baroque square in Europe and today heart of Turin nightlife. Piazza Vittorio features the most fashionable bars and not far from here, along the [[Po (river)|Po]] riverfront, the ''Murazzi'' quays used to host several bars and nightclubs open till the morning until a few years ago.\n\n[[File:Museo del Risorgimento italiano.JPG|thumb|right|Baroque fa\u00e7ade of [[Palazzo Carignano]], the [[Museum of the Risorgimento (Turin)|Museum of the Risorgimento]].]]\n\nParallel to Via Roma, other two popular pedestrian streets, namely ''Via Lagrange'' and ''Via Carlo Alberto'', cross the old town from Via Po to ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II''. Their recent pedestrianisation has improved their original commercial vocation. In particular, Via Lagrange has recently increased the presence of luxury boutiques. This street also hosts the [[Museo Egizio|Egyptian Museum of Turin]], home to what is regarded as one of the largest collections of Egyptian antiquities outside of Egypt.\n\nVia Lagrange and Via Carlo Alberto cross two significant squares of the city, respectively. The former crosses ''Piazza Carignano'', well known mainly for the undulating \u201cconcave \u2013 convex \u2013 concave\u201d Baroque fa\u00e7ade of [[Palazzo Carignano]]. This building used to host the ''Parlamento Subalpino'' (the \u201cSubalpine Parliament\u201d, [[Parliament of the Kingdom of Sardinia]] which also became the Italian Parliament for a few years, after the Italian unification) and today houses the [[Museum of the Risorgimento (Turin)|Museum of the Risorgimento]]. The square also features the [[Teatro Carignano]], a well-conserved Baroque theatre.\nVia Carlo Alberto crosses ''Piazza Carlo Alberto'', a big square hosting the rear fa\u00e7ade of Palazzo Carignano, in eclectic style. On the other side stands the monumental ''Biblioteca Nazionale'' (National Library).\n\n[[File:Torino-mole10.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mole Antonelliana]] some years ago.]]\n\nNot far from Via Po stands the symbol of Turin, namely the [[Mole Antonelliana]], so named after the architect who built it, [[Alessandro Antonelli]]. Construction began in 1863 as a Jewish [[synagogue]]. Nowadays it houses the [[National Museum of Cinema]] and it is believed to be the tallest museum in the world at {{convert|167|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The building is depicted on the Italian 2-cent coin.\n\n[[File:Cupola sindone.jpg|thumb|left|Dome of [[Turin Cathedral]].]]\n\nJust behind ''Piazza Castello'' stands the [[Turin Cathedral]], dedicated to Saint [[John the Baptist]], which is the major church of the city. It was built during 1491\u20131498 and is adjacent to an earlier [[bell tower]] (1470). Annexed to the cathedral is the [[Chapel of the Holy Shroud]], the current resting place of the [[Shroud of Turin]]. The Chapel was added to the structure in 1668\u20131694, designed by [[Guarino Guarini|Guarini]]. The [[Basilica of Corpus Domini]] was built to celebrate an alleged miracle which took place during the sack of the city in 1453, when a soldier was carrying off a [[monstrance]] containing the [[Blessed Sacrament]]; the monstrance fell to the ground, while the [[Sacramental bread|host]] remained suspended in air. The present church, erected in 1610 to replace the original chapel which stood on the spot, is the work of [[Ascanio Vitozzi]].\n\n[[File:Torino - Porta Palatina.jpg|thumb|Right|[[Palatine Towers]].]]\n\nNext to the Turin Cathedral stand the [[Palatine Towers]], an ancient [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman]]-medieval structure that served as one of four Roman [[city gate]]s along the [[city walls]] of Turin. This gate allowed access from north to the ''[[cardo]] maximus'', the typical second main street of a Roman town. The Palatine Towers are among the best preserved Roman remains in northern Italy. Close to this site, the {{convert|51,300|m2|0|adj=mid|abbr=off}} ''Piazza della Repubblica'' plays host to the biggest open market in Europe, locally known as ''mercato di Porta Palazzo'' (''Porta Palazzo'' or ''Porta Pila'' are the historical and local names of this area).\n\nWest of the Porte Palatine stands the ''Quadrilatero Romano'' (Roman Quadrilateral), the old medieval district recently renewed. The current neighbourhood is characterised by its tiny streets and its several medieval buildings and today it is popular for its ''[[Ap\u00e9ritif and digestif|aperitivo]]'' bars and its small shops run by local artisans. The hub of the Quadrilatero is ''Piazza Emanuele Filiberto''.\n\nSouth of the Quadrilatero Romano stands ''Via Garibaldi'', another popular street of the city. It is a {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} pedestrian street between Piazza Castello and ''Piazza Statuto'' which features some of the old shops of the city. Large ''Piazza Statuto'' is another example of Baroque square with arcades.\n\n[[File:Nouvelle gare TGV de Turin Porta Susa.jpg|thumb|left|[[Torino Porta Susa railway station|''Porta Susa'' railway station]].]]\n\nAnother main street of downtown is ''Via Pietro Micca'', which starts in Piazza Castello and ends in the large ''Piazza Solferino''. The street continues in ''Via Cernaia'' up to ''Piazza XXV Dicembre'', which features the former [[Porta Susa]] passengers building, relocated in 2012  a little more southward. The  new and larger passengers building is situated between ''Corso Bolzano'' and ''Corso Inghilterra'' and  is an example of contemporary architecture, being a {{convert|300|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and {{convert|19|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-high}} glass and steel structure. Porta Susa is currently the international central station of the city (high speed trains to Paris) and it is becoming the central hub of railway transportation of the city, being the station in which local trains (so-called ''Ferrovie Metropolitane''), national trains and high-speed national and international trains converge.\n\nClose to Via Cernaia stands the ''Cittadella'' (Citadel), located in the ''Andrea Guglielminetti garden''. What remains of the old medieval and modern fortress of the city, it is a starting point for a tour into the old tunnels below the city.\n\n=== San Salvario ===\n[[File:Borgo medievale TO.jpg|thumb|''Borgo Medievale''.]]\n[[File:Valentino castle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Castello del Valentino]] in [[Parco del Valentino]].]]\n\nSoutheast of the city centre stands ''San Salvario'' district, which extends from ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II'' to ''Corso Bramante'' and is delimited by the [[Turin-Genoa railway]] on the west side and by the Po river on the east side. Home to an increasing immigrants' community, the district is an example of integration among different cultures; it also features an incremented  nightlife after the opening of several low-cost bars and restaurants.\n\nSan Salvario is crossed by two main roads, ''Via Nizza'' and ''Via Madama Cristina'', and just as the city centre it is characterised by the [[grid plan]] typical of Turin's old neighbourhoods. The hub of the district is ''Piazza Madama Cristina'' which hosts a big open market, while several commercial activities flourish around it.\n\nThe celebrated [[Parco del Valentino]] is situated in the east side of San Salvario and, albeit not in downtown, it represents kind of central park of Turin. Thanks to the vicinity to the city centre, the park is very popular among the local people, during the day but also at night, because of the several bars and nightclubs placed here. From the terraces of Parco del Valentino, many sights of the hills on the other side of the river can be appreciated.\n\nIn the centre of the park stands the [[Castello del Valentino]], built in the 17th century. This castle has a horseshoe shape, with four rectangular towers, one at each angle, and a wide inner court with a marble pavement. The ceilings of the false upper floors are in ''transalpino'' (i.e. French) style. The fa\u00e7ade sports the huge coat of arms of the [[House of Savoy]]. Today, Castello del Valentino serves as the faculty of Architecture of the ''[[Polytechnic University of Turin|Polytechnic University of Turin]]''.\n\nAnother  cluster of buildings in the park is the ''Borgo Medievale'' (Medieval village), a replica of medieval mountain castles of Piedmont and Aosta Valley, built for the 1884 [[World's fair|International Exhibition]].\n\nOther  buildings in ''Corso Massimo d'Azeglio'' include the [[Torino Esposizioni]] complex (Turin's exhibition hall built in the 1930s) featuring a monumental entrance with a large full height porch, the circular building which hosts a night club, and the ''Teatro Nuovo'', a theatre mostly focused on ballets exhibitions. Another  building is the largest synagogue of the city, located in ''Piazzetta Primo Levi'' square. Its architecture stands in the main sight of the city, as characterised by four large towers \u2013 {{convert|27|m|ft|abbr=off}} high \u2013 topped by four onion-shaped domes.\n\n=== Crocetta ===\n[[File:MonumentoVittorioEmanueleII.JPG|thumb|right|''Monumento a Vittorio Emanuele II'']]\n[[File:Politecnico Torino.JPG|thumb|The [[Polytechnic University of Turin]].|alt=]]\n[[File:Boulevard Spina Centrale Torino.JPG|thumb|left|The ''Spina Centrale'' is a new under-construction boulevard built over the undergrounded railway. It is already completed in ''Crocetta.'']]\n\nSouth of ''Centro'' stands the ''Crocetta'' district, considered one of the most exclusive districts of the city, because of highly rated residential buildings. At the heart of the district is the partially pedestrianised area crossed by ''Corso Trieste'', ''Corso Trento'' and ''Corso Duca D'Aosta'', plenty of some notable residential buildings in eclectic, neo-Gothic and Art Nouveau style. The area was built between 1903 and 1937 replacing the old [[parade ground]], which was moved in the Southern part of the city.\n\nNorth of this area stands the ''GAM (Galleria d'Arte Moderna)'', one of the two Museum of Modern Arts of the Turin Metro area (the second and largest one is hosted in ''Castello di Rivoli'', a former Savoy Royal castle in the suburbs). The Museum stands in front a huge monument situated in the centre of the roundabout between ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II'' and ''Corso Galileo Ferraris'': the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II (Turin)|Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II]], a King of Savoy statue situated on a 39-meters high column. Next to the Museum, another significant residential building previously hosted the head office of [[Juventus]], one of the two main Turin football clubs.\n\nWest of this area, the main building of [[Polytechnic University of Turin]] stands along ''Corso Duca Degli Abruzzi''. The 1958 building, a {{convert|122,000|m2|0|adj=mid|abbr=off}} complex, hosts approximately 30,000 students and is considered one of the major Institutes of Technology of the country \u2013 mainly due to the vocation of the city for the industrialisation, pushed by the automotive sector. This institute recently expanded in the western district of ''Cenisia'' with additional modern buildings.\n\nCrocetta is crossed by large and modern avenues, such as ''Corso Duca degli Abruzzi'', ''Corso Galileo Ferraris'', and ''Corso Einaudi''. These avenues feature long rows of trees, symbolic of Turin's typical urbanity. However, the most popular avenue is ''Corso De Gasperi'', which, albeit smaller than other avenues of the district, hosts one of the most fashionable open markets of the city, the so-called ''Mercato della Crocetta'', in which it is possible to find some discounted branded clothing among the more popular ones.\n\nThe Western border of Crocetta is instead an example of contemporary architecture. The huge avenue, made up of ''Corso Mediterraneo'' and ''Corso Castelfidardo'', is part of ''Spina Centrale'' boulevard and was recently built over the old railway (now undergrounded): as a result, the avenue is very large (up to {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=off}}) and modern, having been rebuilt with valuable materials, including a characteristic lighting system supported by white high poles. This avenue hosts some examples of contemporary art, such as [[Mario Merz]]'s ''Igloo'' fountain or the [[Per Kirkeby]]'s ''Opera per Torino'' monument in ''Largo Orbassano''.\n\nThe East side of the district is also known as ''Borgo San Secondo'' and was so named after the church of the same name standing in ''Via San Secondo'', a major street in the neighbourhood. This area is located near ''Porta Nuova'' railway station and is actually older than the rest of the district, featuring several apartment buildings from the late 19th century, to include the birthplace and home of author [[Primo Levi]] on Corso Re Umberto.<ref>https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1989/01/19/my-house/</ref> A local open market is held in ''Piazza San Secondo'' and along ''Via Legnano''. The market square also hosts the former washhouse and public baths of the neighbourhood, among the oldest examples of their kind in Turin (1905).\n\nOne of the main thoroughfares crossing Borgo San Secondo is ''Via Sacchi'', which serves as an ideal gate to the city centre: its Serlian arcades on the west side of the street (the east side is enclosed by ''Porta Nuova'' railway station service buildings) host some significant boutiques and hotels, such as the historic ''Pfatisch'' pastry shop and the ''Turin Palace Hotel'' (totally refurbished and reopened in 2015). South of ''Via Sacchi'', ''Ospedale Mauriziano'' is one of the ancient and major hospitals of the city. Going further southwards, it is possible to appreciate an interesting residential cluster of old public housing gravitating around ''Via Arquata''.\n\n=== Cenisia ===\n\n[[File:PiazzaCarloAlbertoTorino.jpg|thumb|left|The Piazza Carlo Alberto.]]\n[[File:Aperitif for four.JPG|thumb|left|A typical Italian ''[[Aperitivo]]'']]\n\nBordered by ''Corso Castelfidardo'', ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II'', ''Corso Trapani'' and ''Corso Peschiera'', this small district is mainly significant for hosting the recent expansion of Turinese [[Institute of Technology]] ''[[Polytechnic University of Turin|Politecnico]]''. The expansion was possible after under-grounding the railway under ''Corso Castelfidardo'' and the subsequent disposal of the old buildings dedicated to the train maintenance present in this area (so-called ''Officine Grandi Riparazioni'' or ''OGR''). ''Politecnico'' expanded its facilities through two huge overpass buildings over the avenue, linked to new buildings on the west side. This cluster of buildings forms an evocative square with a unique architectural style. The main building on the west side hosts a [[General Motors]] research centre, the ''General Motors Global Propulsion Systems'' (formerly known as ''General Motors Powertrain Europe''). ''Politecnico'' area extends till ''Via Boggio'' with further facilities hosted in the former ''OGR'' facilities. The Institute plans to further build new facilities in the current parking area.\n\nNorth of ''Politecnico'' facilities, the main building of the ''OGR'' former cluster, which consists in three 180-meters long joint parallel buildings, became recently a big open space which hosts temporary exhibitions and during the hot seasons, its external spaces became a fashionable site to have a typical Italian ''[[aperitivo]]''.\n\nNorth of ''OGR'', a former prison complex called ''Le Nuove'' is a significant example of old European prison building. The complex was built between 1857 and 1869 during the reign of Victor Emmanuel II. After being disposed of during the 1990s, the complex was changed into a museum and it is possible to visit its facilities.\n\nAn example of contemporary art is the heating plant in ''Corso Ferrucci'', which has been covered with aluminium panels. Another building (19th century), now abandoned, is the former [[Westinghouse Brakes#Rail vehicles|Westinghouse]] factory of train brakes situated in ''Via Borsellino''.\n\nThe remaining part of the district is mainly formed by residential buildings with not significant architectural value. The district had its development mainly after the World War II, following the industrial development of the town \u2013 in particular, the expansion of [[Lancia]] automotive factories in the ''Borgo San Paolo'' neighbourhood, culminated in the construction of [[Palazzo Lancia]] in 1954, the company's former headquarters. Industrialization led to consequent population growth in the nearby areas, including ''Cenisia''. Main avenues which are crossing the district are ''Corso Ferrucci'' and ''Corso Racconigi''. This last one is hosting a huge daily open market, the ''Mercato di Corso Racconigi''.\n\n=== Cit Turin ===\n[[File:Palazzo della Vittoria - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|''Casa della Vittoria'' (1918-1920) is an example of Turin's neo-gothic architecture.]]\n\nThe smallest district of the city is ''Cit Turin'' (\"Little Turin\" in [[Piedmontese language]]). This small triangle surrounded by ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II'', ''Corso Francia'' and ''Corso Inghilterra'' hosts some high rated residential buildings and is regarded as a prestigious residential neighbourhood by local people.\n\n[[File:Grattacielo Intesa San Paolo - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|left|[[Intesa Sanpaolo]] banking group headquarters]]\n\nThe district features many buildings in [[Art Nouveau]], [[Art Deco]] and [[Neo-Gothic]] style. Among them, one of the most impressive and well known is the ''Casa Della Vittoria'' (architect ''Gottardo Gussoni''). Another notable example is [[Casa Fenoglio-Lafleur]]. Both buildings face Corso Francia.\n\nThe district is well known for its commercial vocation mainly in its two main streets, ''Via Duchessa Jolanda'' and ''Via Principi d'Acaja'', ideally crossing each other among the gardens ''Giardino Luigi Martini'', locally called ''Piazza Benefica'', which hosts a popular open market.\n\nThe district is also characterised by two massive recent buildings: the ''Palazzo di Giustizia'', Turin's new courthouse built in the 1990s (in a 350-metre long facility), and the first real skyscraper of Turin, the [[Torre Intesa Sanpaolo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world.intesasanpaolo.com/en/call_to_action/intesa-s-turin-tower-is-named-one-of-the-10-most-environmentally-friendly-new-buildings-in-the-world|title=Intesa\u2019s Turin tower is named one of the 10 most environmentally friendly new buildings in the world \u2013 Intesa Sanpaolo World|author=|date=|work=intesasanpaolo.com}}</ref> which house the headquarters of one of the major Italian private banks.\n\n=== San Donato ===\n[[File:Torino-CampanileChiesaDiNostraSignoradelSuffragio.png|thumb|upright=0.7|''Chiesa di Nostra Signora del Suffragio e Santa Zita'']]\n[[File:Torre littoria Torino.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The [[Torre Littoria]]]]\n\n''San Donato'' district is located between ''Corso Francia'', ''Corso Lecce'', ''Corso Potenza'', ''Via Nole'', the ''Parco Dora'' and ''Corso Principe Oddone''. It was populated since the medieval era, but becomes bigger during the 19th century, prospering around the canal ''Canale di San Donato'', which does not exist any more, currently replaced by the central street of the district, ''Via San Donato''. Buildings in the district are relatively recent (around 1820), except for the oldest group of small houses located in the area of ''Brusach\u0153r'' (''Palazzo Forneris'' building) located along ''Via Pacinotti'' near the small ''Piazza Paravia''. The conservation of the street and of this old building influences the straightness of ''Via San Donato'', which makes a slight curve to result in parallel with ''Via Pacinotti'' before ending in central ''Piazza Statuto ''square.\n\nMain church of the district is the ''Chiesa di Nostra Signora del Suffragio e Santa Zita'', which with its {{convert|83|m|ft|abbr=off}} height of its bell tower, is well known to be the fifth tallest structure in the city of Turin, after the [[Mole Antonelliana]], the [[Intesa Sanpaolo|Intesa-Sanpaolo skyscraper]], the [[Torre Littoria]] and the two pennons of the [[Juventus Stadium]]. The church is hosting the ''Istituto Suore Minime di Nostra Signora del Suffragio'' and it was promoted and designed by [[Francesco Fa\u00e0 di Bruno]]. The legend says, that he wanted to build the tallest bell tower of the town and put a clock on the top, to all the poor people to know the time for free. The small building near the church is what remains of ''Casa Tartaglino'', a small residential building which was also extended and modified by Faa di Bruno.\n\n''Villino Cibrario'' in ''Via Saccarelli'' is another significant building designed by Barnaba Panizza in 1842. The building was equipped with a large garden which was eliminated to host the street. The neighbourhood has a high concentration of historic buildings in Art Nouveau style designed by architect Pietro Fenoglio (among the others, the prestigious ''Villino Raby'' in Corso Francia 8). Other significant buildings are the  ''Villa Boringhieri'' in Via San Donato, and other Art Nouveau and Neo-Gothic buildings are situated in ''Via Piffetti ''and ''Via Durandi.''\n\nAmong the modern buildings of the district, the most significant one is, of course, the ''Torre BBPR'' Tower (which took the name from the architecture office who designed it). The building is representing the ''post-rationalism Italian architecture'' (same style of the better known [[Torre Velasca]] tower in the city of Milan). The tower is facing the central ''Piazza Statuto'' square.\nThe district is crossed by some significant avenues: on ''Corso Svizzera'', which crosses the district from North To South, faces the Business Centre ''Piero Della Francesca'', where the offices of ''Tuttosport,'' one of the three national sports daily newspapers has its head offices. Also on ''Corso Svizzer''a, stands one of the oldest hospitals of the city, the ''Ospedale Amedeo di Savoia'', specialised in infectious diseases. Other major avenues are ''Corso Umbria'' and ''Corso Tassoni''.\n\nAnother big avenue, which borders the district on its East, is ''Corso Principe Oddone'', which in the past was along the railway to Milan. Currently the railway has been under-grounded: the avenue will be enlarged and have same architecture style of southern ''Corso Inghilterra'' in downtown, becoming one of the major avenue of Turin.\nThe northern part of the district was part of the former industrial district of Turin, recently reconverted to a park called ''Parco Dora''. Mainly, in ''San Donato'' the portion reconverted was the one occupied by the plant of [[Michelin]] (west of ''Via Livorno'') and [[Fiat|FIAT]] ironwork plants (on the East). Differently for other portions of ''Parco Dora'', this part has been totally reconverted to park without letting any evidence of the industrial area except for the cooling tower which stands along ''Corso Umbria'' and became a symbol of the park. Works are completed in the western area, where ''Corso Mortara'' has been closed to traffic and moved just a bit northern and covered by an artificial tunnel. It is possible to access the southern shore of the ''Dora'' river. South of the Park, an interesting architecture of different levels is hosting a new shopping mall called ''Centro Commerciale Parco Dora''. East of ''Via Livorno'', works are still partially in progress, with the Dora river still to be uncovered by a big slab, on which the [[Fiat|FIAT]] plants used to stand). West of ''Via Livorno'', the ''Environment Park'' is a research centre for renewable energy.\n\n=== Aurora ===\n[[File:BorgoDora.JPG|thumb|right|Tiny streets of ''Borgo Dora'']]\n\n''Aurora'' is one of the most ancient districts which developed out of the medieval [[Defensive wall|city walls]], north of the historical city centre. It stretches from downtown northern boundaries in ''Corso Regina Margherita'' (an extended and important thoroughfare of Turin) up to ''Corso Vigevano'' and ''Corso Novara'' in the North Side (namely the old [[excise]] boundary till the early 20th century); the western boundary is ''Corso Principe Oddone'' (now part of the ''Spina Centrale'' boulevard) and the eastern border is the Dora river.\n\nThe district was named Aurora after the so-called ''Cascina Aurora'', an old farmstead lying north of the Dora river, right at the intersection between ''Corso Giulio Cesare'' and ''Corso Emilia''. The farmstead has long been demolished and the area has been converted to office buildings, hosting the Turinese textile company ''Gruppo Finanziario Tessile'' (''GFT'') headquarters until the early 21st century.\n\nThe historical hub of the district is ''Borgo Dora'' (The \"Dora Borough\"), a small neighbourhood next to ''Porta Palazzo'' and enclosed by ''Corso Regina Margherita'', ''Via Cigna'', the Dora river and ''Corso Giulio Cesare''. Once known as ''Borgo del Pallone'' (literally \"Ball Borough\") or ''Balon'' in [[Piedmontese dialect]] ({{IPA-it|ba\u02c8lun|local}}), this neighbourhood is famous for its ''mercatino del Balon'' or simply ''Balon'', the Turinese [[flea market]] that opens every Saturday in its tiny and twisted streets. Borgo Dora hosts several remarkable places, such as: ''Piccola Casa della Divina Provvidenza'' (\"Little House of the Divine Providence\"), also known as ''Cottolengo'', a well-known charitable organization which has been operating for almost 200 years in the city; ''Arsenale della Pace'' (\"Arsenal of Peace\"), a former weapons factory that currently hosts the headquarters of ''SERMIG'' (''Servizio Missionario Giovani''), a nonprofit association which assists poor and homeless people; ''Caserma Cavalli'' (\"Cavalli Barracks\"), one of the most representative buildings of the district, a former barracks topped by a clock tower which now hosts ''Scuola Holden'', a storytelling and performing arts school; the evocative ''Cortile del Maglio'' (\"Mallet Courtyard\"), a covered pedestrian area featuring bars and clubs. Across from Cortile del Maglio and Arsenale della Pace stands a wide pedestrian area which features a [[hot air balloon]], a clear allusion to the neighbourhood's old name ''Balon'': recently installed, the balloon is open to public which can now take an interesting view of the city from this new high observation point.\n\nRight at the borders of Borgo Dora stands part of ''Porta Palazzo'' open market which hosts the [[New Exhibition Hall (Turin)|New Exhibition Hall]], designed by the Italian architect [[Massimiliano Fuksas]]. The building has replaced the ''Clothes Market'', one of the four covered pavilions of Porta Palazzo market, but unfortunately, this glass green-shaded building has been highly criticized because of its lack of usability for commercial activities, albeit an example of contemporary architecture.\n\nAnother interesting building at the borders of the neighbourhood is [[Torino Porta Milano railway station|Porta Milano]] (a.k.a. ''stazione della Ciri\u00e8-Lanzo''), a former 19th-century railway station that marked the terminus of Ciri\u00e8-Lanzo railway line until the 1980s. To this day, the station is no longer in use as well as the rails up to ''Piazza Baldissera''. The station building was recently renovated and now hosts some old locomotives, even though it is not open to the public. Unfortunately, the old rails crossing the district are totally disused and neglected, adding decay to the whole area.\n\nBorgo Dora, as many other pockets of Aurora, is characterized by the marked multi-ethnicity of its population, being home to a large community of immigrants from emerging countries.\n\n[[File:Santuario di Maria Ausiliatrice Torino.jpg|thumb|right|''Santuario di Maria Ausiliatrice'']]\n\nWest of Borgo Dora stands ''Rione Valdocco'' (\"Valdocco neighbourhood\"), enclosed by ''Via Cigna'', ''Corso Regina Margherita'', ''Corso Principe Oddone'' and the Dora river. This neighbourhood hosts the significant architecture of ''Santuario di Maria Ausiliatrice'' (\"Maria Ausiliatrice Sanctuary\") in the homonymous square and behind the church stands ''San Pietro in Vincoli'' old cemetery.\n\nOverall, the main thoroughfares of the West side of Aurora are ''Via Cigna'', which crosses the district from North to South, ''Corso Vercelli'', a historical avenue starting north of the Dora river, and ''Corso Principe Oddone'', part of the long ''Spina Centrale'' boulevard that will be built over the underground [[Turin-Milan railway]]. However, the Spina Centrale project is proceeding slowly because of the lack of funds and the boulevard is still occupied by a large worksite along its span. Once completed, Aurora district will be connected to Eastern ''San Donato'', thanks to a better connection among the roads of the two adjacent districts (i.e. ''Corso Ciri\u00e8'' will continue in ''Corso Gamba'' and ''Strada del Fortino'' in ''Corso Rosai'').\n\nAs for the rest of Aurora, the district is crossed by an important thoroughfare named ''Corso Giulio Cesare'', a long boulevard that extends from Porta Palazzo up to [[Autostrada A4 (Italy)|Turin-Trieste motorway]] entrance in the Northern urban fringe of Turin. Other significant roads are ''Corso Palermo'', ''Via Bologna'' and ''Corso Regio Parco'', mostly in the East side of Aurora which is known as ''Borgo Rossini'' (\"Rossini Borough\"). Albeit not a road, the Dora river is also a significant element for the whole district, since it completely crosses it from West to East.\n\n[[File:Caff\u00e8 corretto (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Lavazza]], famous Turin coffee brand]]\n\nThe area north of the river features a mix of old residential buildings and remains of former factories and facilities from the 20th century. An example are the remains of [[FIAT]] ''Officine Grandi Motori'' (''OGM'') in Corso Vigevano, an old factory that produced big industrial and automotive Diesel engines, a sort of symbol of the industrial history of Turin. Another disused facility is ''Astanteria Martini'' (\"Martini Emergency Department\") in Via Cigna, a former emergency department from the 1920s which has been lying vacant since long.\n\nAs for the old residential buildings of the area, this part of Aurora hosts the oldest [[public housing]] block of the city, built by ''Istituto Autonomo Case Popolari'' (''IACP'') in 1908 in lieu of an old dilapidated small farm once known as ''Chiabotto delle Merle''.\n\nDespite its run-down look, the famous [[Lavazza]] coffee company, along with ''IAAD'' School of Design, chose this part of the city as the location for their new headquarters, which will be built in a contemporary building dubbed ''Nuvola'' (\"Cloud\") right at the borders of ''Borgo Rossini''. Designed by the architect Gino Zucchi, this project is still a work in progress but excavations in the area revealed the remains of a medieval cemetery and an early Christian basilica; these findings will be preserved and will be shown to the public.\n\n''Borgo Rossini'' hosts a number of businesses, for instance, the ''[[Kappa (company)|Robe di Kappa]]'' flagship store (Kappa is a noted Italian sportswear brand founded in Turin) and the ''Cineporto'' (\"Cineport\") a.k.a. ''La Casa dei Produttori'' (\"The Filmmakers' House\", which hosts the ''Turin Piedmont Film Commission Foundation'').\n\n=== Vanchiglia ===\n[[File:Torino, grattacielo della Regione Piemonte (03).jpg|right|thumb|[[Piedmont Region Headquarters]] (209 m), one of the tallest skyscrapers in Italy.]]\n[[File:La Fetta di Polenta - panoramio.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Fetta Di Polenta, northern side]]\n''Vanchiglia'' is bordered by ''Corso San Maurizio, Corso Regio Parco'' and the Po river, crossed also by the [[Dora Riparia]] river and by two big avenues, ''Corso Regina Margherita'' and ''Corso Tortona''.\n\n''Borgo Vanchiglia'' is the historical district: a little triangle next to downtown, situated between ''Corso San Maurizio, Corso Regina Margherita'' and the [[Po (river)|Po]] river. The district is quite popular nowadays because being quite closer to the heart of Turin nightlife ''Piazza Vittorio Veneto,'' many bars and restaurants opened recently in this area. However, Vanchiglia also includes the area called ''Vanchiglietta'', north of ''Borgo Vanchiglia''.\n\nNotable church in ''Borgo Vanchiglia'' is the French neo-Gothic ''Chiesa di Santa Giulia'' situated into ''Piazza Santa Giulia''.\n\nA notable and unusual building in the area is the so-called ''\"[[Fetta di Polenta]]\"'' (literally: \"[[polenta]] slice\"), formerly known as ''Casa Scaccabarozzi.'' This building is located at the intersection of ''Corso San Maurizio'' and ''Via Giulia di Barolo'', and it is one of the most peculiar examples of Turin architecture: a thin trapezoid 27 meters wide on ''Via Giulia Di Barolo'', 5 meters on ''Corso San Maurizio'' and just 0.70 meters wide on the opposite end. It was designed in 1840 by [[Alessandro Antonelli]] for his wife, Francesca Scaccabarozzi, probably because of a bet. The curious name comes from the shape of the palace, which resembles a \"slice of polenta\", and also because it is painted with an ocher colour.\n\nIn the surroundings, in ''Via Vanchiglia 8'', (although in downtown and not really in ''Vanchiglia'' anymore) there is another trapezoid house, albeit with less extreme design: similarly, this building is nicknamed ''\"Fetta di Formaggio\"'' (cheese slice), built in 1832 for the rich ''Marchese Birago di Vische'' by the architect ''Antonio Talentino''.\n\nOther notable buildings are the town public baths, eclectic building built in 1905 (''Corso Regina Margherita'' crossing ''Via Vanchiglia''), and the''Teatro della Caduta'' theatre, opened in 2003 in ''Via Michele Buniva 23'', which with its 45 seats is the smallest theatre in Turin and among the smallest theatres in Europe.\n\nIn Corso Regina Margherita, another notable building is the former ''Opera pia Reynero'', a charitable organization. The building was built in 1892. Being abandoned for a long time after it closed in 1996, it was then occupied by the Askatasuna Social Center, a non-profit anarchic organization, hosting since then various activities such as concerts, dinners, seminars and homeless solidarity initiatives.\n[[File:Campus Luigi Einaudi Torino - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|upright=2.8|Campus Luigi Einaudi]]\nNorth of ''Corso Regina Margherita'', district is losing the flavour and architecture typical of Turin downtown, cause a significant portion of the district was formerly occupied by factories, nowadays partially abandoned or replaced by modern buildings. A significant example was the area occupied by gas companies between Corso Regina Margherita and the Dora river, which were partially demolished to make place to the new modern Faculty of Law building (Campus \"Luigi Einaudi\"), designed by the architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]]. This building was classified by the American television company CNN among the 10 most spectacular university buildings in the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/spectacular-university-buildings/index.html|title=10 of the world's most spectacular university buildings to impress travellers |date=19 February 2014|work=CNN Travel|access-date=10 August 2017}}</ref> In the campus courtyard, a large wood statue representing a bull (symbol of Turin) has been erected by [[Mario Ceroli]]. The area hosts also a student campus.\n\nNext to the campus, a new cycling and pedestrian bridge on the Dora river was opened on 16 April 2010, linking the campus area to ''Corso Verona.'' Bridge is entitled to the architect ''Franco Mellano''.\n\n''Parco Colletta'' is a big park area touched by the two rivers of the district, which also hosts some sport facilities, mainly football fields and a swimming pool.\n\nThe district is completed by the ''Cimitero Monumentale'' cemetery. This huge complex (formerly known as ''Cimitero Generale'') is the largest cemetery in Turin, and among the first in Italy for the number of buried people (over 400,000). It is located close to the ''Colletta'' park. The ancient part of the cemetery rises from the main entrance of Corso Novara with his octagonal shape. It contains numerous historical tombs and 12&nbsp; km of arcades, enriched by artistic sculptures (that's why is called \"monumental cemetery\"). Over the years there have been subsequent extensions of the central historical body in the direction of the Colletta park. In the cemetery, there is a crematory temple built in 1882, the second largest in Italy after that of Milan one.\n\n=== Main churches ===\n[[File:Duomo Torino.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turin Cathedral]] featuring the [[Sindone Chapel|Chapel of the Holy Shroud]].]]\n[[File:Basilica di superga.jpg|thumb|right|[[Basilica of Superga]].]]\n{{See also|List of places of worship in Turin}}\nThe [[Santuario della Consolata]], a sanctuary much frequented by pilgrims, stands on the site of the 10th-century Monastery of St. Andrew, and is a work by Guarini. It was sumptuously restored in 1903.

The basilica holds the tombs of many of the dukes of Savoy, as well as many of the kings of Sardinia. Superga can be reached by means of the [[Superga Rack Railway]] from Sassi suburb. The Basilica of Superga was built by [[Amadeus II of Savoy]] as an ex-voto for the liberation of Turin (1706), and served  as a royal mausoleum since 1772.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Turin |title=Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Turin \u2013 Wikisource |publisher=En.wikisource.org |date=7 March 2007 |accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Villas, parks and gardens ===\n\n[[File:Borgomedievale sul PO.jpg|thumb|The medieval village in [[Parco del Valentino|Valentino Park]].]]\n[[File:Area dei Laghi.jpg|thumb|[[La Mandria Regional Park]].]]\n\nThe most popular park in the city is [[Parco del Valentino]]. In 1961, during the celebrations of ''Italia61'' ([[Italian unification]] centenary), an important international exhibition (''FLOR61: Flowers of the world in Turin'') took place in the park with 800 exhibitors from 19 countries. For the occasion the plan for the new lighting of the park, along with its fountains and paths, was assigned to Guido Chiarelli, the head engineer at the city hall.\n\nOther large parks are ''Parco della Pellerina'', ''Parco Colletta'', ''Parco Rignon'', ''Parco Colonnetti'' and the [[Orto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Torino|University botanical gardens]]. Around the city, there are several other parks, such as [[La Mandria Regional Park]] and the [[Parco naturale di Stupinigi|Parco della Palazzina di Caccia di Stupinigi]], once hunting grounds of the Savoy, and those situated on the hill of Turin. Many parks are smaller, located in the various districts: there is also a total of 240 playgrounds in these parks. In the early 1960s, mayor [[Amedeo Peyron]] had the first garden in Italy with games for children inaugurated. According to a [[Legambiente]] report from 2007, Turin is the first Italian city as far as structures and policies on childcare are concerned.<ref>[http://www.legambientepiemonte.it/doc/05-01-07% 20com% 20St% 20ecosistema% 20bambino% 202007.pdf Ecosystem child.

The park is located in Parella suburb (Turin's West Side) and it plays host to various concerts in summer.\n\n[[Rosa Vercellana]], commonly known as ''Rosina'' and, in [[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]] as ''La Bela Rosin'' (\"the beautiful Rosin\"), was the [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] and later wife of King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]]. She was made Countess of Mirafiori and Fontanafredda, but never Queen of Italy. As the Savoy family refused to allow her to be buried next to her husband in the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], her children had a mausoleum built for her in a similar form and on a smaller scale in Turin, next to the road to the Castello di Mirafiori. The circular copper-domed [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] monument, surmounted by a [[Latin cross]] and surrounded by a large park, was designed by [[Angelo Dimezzi]] and completed in 1888.<ref>[http://www.piemontefeel.org/en/interesse/elemento-206.html \u2018Mausoleo della Bela Rosin\u2019], ''Piemontefeel'' (Regione Piemonte, 2005).</ref><ref name=\"parks\">[http://www.parks.it/parco.po.to/pun.torinese.html \u2018Parco fluviale del Po tratto torinese: Punti di Interesse\u2019], Parks.it (Rome: Federazione Italiana Parchi e Riserve Natural).</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Historical populations\n|type=\n|footnote= Source: [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] 2001\n|1901 |329691\n|1911 |415667\n|1921 |499823\n|1931 |590753\n|1936 |629115\n|1951 |719300\n|1961 |1025822\n|1971 |1167968\n|1981 |1117154\n|1991 |962507\n|2001 |865263\n|2011 |872367\n|2015 |897265\n}}\n\nIn 2009, the city proper had a population of about 910,000, which is a significant increase on the 2001 census figure.

The Duke had the ambition to transform the city into a major artistic and cultural capital, and in the following centuries numerous  artists were to work at the Savoy court, especially architects and planners like [[Carlo di Castellamonte]] and his son [[Amedeo Castellamonte|Amedeo]], [[Guarino Guarini]] and, in the 18th century, [[Filippo Juvarra]] and [[Benedetto Alfieri]].\n\n[[File:Palazzo Madama, Torino (9).JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Palazzo Madama, Turin|Palazzo Madama e Casaforte degli Acaja]]]]\nAs for the painting and the visual arts, Turin became a point of reference, especially in the 20th century.

Artists  born in Turin include the sculptor [[Umberto Mastroianni]] and the architect [[Carlo Mollino]]. Between the 1960s and the 1970s, the international centre of Turin ([[Arte Povera]]), the presence in the city of artists like [[Alighiero Boetti]], [[Mario Merz]], [[Giuseppe Penone]], [[Piero Gilardi]] and [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]]. In those years there was a strong artistic influence of designer [[Armando Testa]]. Artists currently operating in the city include [[Ugo Nespolo]] and [[Carol Rama]].\n\n=== The Opera Houses ===\nOne of these was [[Teatro Regio di Torino]] where Puccini premiered his ''[[La Boh\u00e8me]]'' in 1896. It burned down in 1936 and was rebuilt after WW II.\n\n=== Literature ===\n[[File:Biblioteca Nazionale di Torino.jpg|thumb|right|National Library]]\nA literary centre for many centuries, Turin began to attract writers only after the establishment of the court of the [[House of Savoy|Dukes of Savoy]]. One of the most famous writers of the 17th century was [[Giambattista Marino]], which in 1608 moved to the court of [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy|Charles Emmanuel I]]. Marino suffered an assassination attempt by a rival, [[Gaspare Murtola]], and was later imprisoned for a year because of gossip that he had said and written against the duke. Perhaps, because of this, in 1615 Marino left Turin and moved to France.\n\nThe main literary figures during the Baroque age in Turin were [[Emanuele Tesauro]] and [[Alessandro Tassoni]]. In the next century Torino hosted the poet [[Vittorio Alfieri]] from Asti for a while. The situation was very different in the 19th century, especially since the city became a point of reference for Italian unification and, subsequently, the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. Indeed, in those years Tommaseo, Settembrini and [[John Meadows (author)|John Meadows]] resided in the city. A major literary and cultural woman of that time was [[Olimpia Savio]]. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Turin was home to writers such as [[Guido Gozzano]], [[Edmondo De Amicis]], [[Emilio Salgari]] and Dino Segre, the latter known by the pseudonym of [[Pitigrilli]].\n[[File:IB teatro regio.jpg|thumb|right|Teatro Regio]]\nTurin had a very important role in Italian literature after World War II. For the publishing house founded by [[Giulio Einaudi]]  worked figures such as [[Cesare Pavese]], [[Italo Calvino]], [[Vitaliano Brancati]], [[Primo Levi]], [[Natalia Ginzburg]], [[Fernanda Pivano]], [[Beppe Fenoglio]], [[Carlo Fruttero]] and [[Franco Lucentini]]. In more recent years, writers active in the city are [[Giovanni Arpino]], [[Nico Orengo]], [[Giuseppe Culicchia]], [[Margherita Oggero]], [[Laura Mancinelli]], [[Alessandra Montrucchio]], [[Alessandro Perissinotto]], [[Guido Quartz]], [[Piero Soria]] and [[Alessandro Baricco]].

As such, it forms the birthplace of [[Italian cinema]]. Because of its historic, geographical and cultural proximity to France, Italian filmmakers were naturally influenced by [[Cinema of France|French cinema]] and the [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8re brothers]]. The first Italian cinema screening occurred in Turin in March 1896. In November 1896, Italian filmmakers performed the first cinema screening of a film before a fee-paying audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaniaci.it/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=38 |title=\"Le proiezioni cinematografiche a Torino\" \u2013 di Pierluigi Capra |publisher=Cinemaniaci.it |date=|accessdate=12 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nBy the start of the 20th century (especially after 1907), a number of the first Italian films were aired in Turin. Examples include [[Giovanni Pastrone]] ''[[Cabiria]]'', in 1914, one of the first [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] in history.\n\nThe Turin-based company [[Ambrosio Film]], established in 1906 by [[Arturo Ambrosio]], was one of the leading forces in Italian cinema and boosted the importance of the city as a filmmaking destination. The company, noted in particular for its historical epics, produced a large number of films until it was dissolved in 1924.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 30s, Turin hosted a number of film productions and major film studios (''film houses''), such as the [[Itala film]], [[Aquila (studio)|Aquila]] and [[Fert Studios]]. Today their heritage is located in the modern [[Lumiq Studios]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lumiq.com|title=Lumiq.com|work=lumiq.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115222940/http://www.lumiq.com/|archivedate=15 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and [[Virtual Reality Multi Media Spa]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vrmmp.it|title=Vrmmp \u2013 Notizie e guide online|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.torino.it/torinoplus/italiano/portrait/novecento.html |title=Torino nel Novecento, Torino |publisher=Comune.torino.it |date=|accessdate=12 April 2011}}</ref> Turin's prominence in Italian film continued until 1937, the year [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] was inaugurated in Rome.\n\nAfter World War II, the cinematic scene in Turin continued to thrive. 1956 saw the opening of the [[National Museum of Cinema]], first housed in the [[Palazzo Chiablese]] and then, from 2000, in the imposing headquarters of the [[Mole Antonelliana]]. In 1982 the film critic [[Gianni Rondolino]] created Festival Internazionale Cinema Giovani,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torinofilmfest.org/?action=history&id=1 |title=TFF |publisher=Torinofilmfest.org |date=25 September 1982 |accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref> which later became the [[Torino Film Festival]].\n\nToday Turin is one of the main cinematographic and television centres in Italy, thanks to the role of the [[Turin Film Commission]] that reports the production of many feature films, soap operas and commercials.\n\nTurin streets were  the locations where [[Audrey Hepburn]] played ''[[War and Peace (1956 film)|War and Peace]]'', [[Michael Caine]] drove a Mini Cooper in ''[[The Italian Job]]'', [[Claudio Bisio]] becomes the president of the Italian Republic, [[Carlo Verdone]] set his version of ''[[Cinderella (2013 film)|Cinderella]]'', [[Marco Tullio Giordana]] shot ''[[Piazza Fontana: The Italian Conspiracy]]'', [[Woody Allen]] shot ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', [[Cate Blanchett]] played ''[[Heaven (2002 film)|Heaven]]'', [[Giovanna Mezzogiorno]] ''[[Vincere]]'', [[Marcello Mastroianni]] and [[Jacqueline Bisset]] ''[[The Sunday Woman (film)|The Sunday Woman]]'', and [[Harvey Keitel]] ''[[The Stone Merchant]]''.

Another established university in the city is the [[Polytechnic University of Turin]], ranking among Top 50 universities in the world and #1 in Italy in the fields of engineering, technology and computer science (\"Academic Ranking of World Universities\" published by [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]). Turin also hosts the [[United Nations System Staff College]], the [[European Training Foundation]], and a campus of the [[ESCP Europe]] business school, ranked among the 10 best business schools in Europe. Moreover, the city hosts three small English language post-secondary institutions: [[St. John International University]], [[International University College of Turin]], and the  [[Turin School of Development]], as well as [http://www.buddies.it/ Buddies Elementary School].\n\n== Transport ==\n{{See also|Gruppo Torinese Trasporti|ToBike}}\n[[File:Torino PortaSusa galleria.jpg|thumb|left|[[Porta Susa]] railway station]]\nThe city currently has a large number of rail and road work sites. Although this activity has increased as a result of the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], parts of it had long been planned. Some of the work sites deal with general roadworks to improve traffic flow, such as underpasses and flyovers, but two projects are of major importance and will radically change the shape of the city.\n\nOne is the ''Spina Centrale'' (\"Central Spine\") project which includes the doubling of a major railway crossing the city, the [[Turin-Milan railway]] locally known as ''Passante Ferroviario di Torino'' (\"Turin Railway Bypass\"). The railroad previously ran in a trench, which will now be covered by a major boulevard running from North to South of Turin, in a central position along the city. [[Torino Porta Susa railway station|Porta Susa]], on this section, will become Turin's main station to substitute the terminus of [[Torino Porta Nuova railway station|Porta Nuova]] with a through station. Other important stations are [[Torino Stura railway station|Stura]], [[Torino Rebaudengo Fossata railway station|Rebaudengo]], [[Torino Lingotto railway station|Lingotto]] and [[Madonna di Campagna]] railway stations, though not all of them belong to the layout of the Spina Centrale.\n\n[[File:MetroTorinoMassaua.jpg|thumb|right|Turin [[Massaua (Turin Metro)|Massaua]] metro station]]\n\nThe other major project is the construction of a subway line based on the [[V\u00e9hicule Automatique L\u00e9ger|VAL]] system, known as [[Turin Metro|Metrotorino]]. This project is expected to continue for years and to cover a larger part of the city, but its first phase was finished in time for the [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Olympic Games]], inaugurated on 4 February 2006 and opened to the public the day after. The first leg of the subway system linked the nearby town of [[Collegno]] with Porta Susa in Turin's city centre. On 4 October 2007, the line was extended to Porta Nuova and then, in March 2011, to Lingotto. A new extension of the so-called ''Linea 1'' (\"Line 1\") is expected in the near future, reaching both [[Rivoli, Piedmont|Rivoli]] (up to Cascine Vica hamlet) in the Western belt of Turin and ''Piazza Bengasi'' in the Southeast side of the city. Furthermore, a ''Linea 2'' is in the pipeline that will connect the south-western district of Mirafiori with Barriera di Milano in the north end. In June 2018, the project entered the public consultation phase with the proposed list of 23 stations published on the city's website.<ref>{{cite web|title=M2TO Progetto Premliminare della Linea 2|url=http://www.comune.torino.it/trasporti/bm%7Edoc/180626_ppt_invio.pdf|publisher=Citta di Torino|accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref> \n[[File:Air Dolomiti E195 (8542367226) (2).jpg|thumb|right|[[Turin Caselle Airport|Turin Caselle International Airport]]]]\n\nThe main street in the city centre, ''Via Roma'', runs atop a tunnel built during the fascist era (when ''Via Roma'' itself was totally refurbished and took on its present-day aspect). The tunnel was supposed to host the underground line but it is now used as an underground car park. A project to build an underground system was ready in the 1970s, with government funding for it and for similar projects in [[Milan]] and Rome. Whilst the other two cities went ahead with the projects, Turin's local government led by mayor Diego Novelli shelved the proposal as it believed it to be too costly and unnecessary.\n\nThe city has an international airport known as [[Turin Caselle Airport|Caselle International Airport]] [[Sandro Pertini]] (TRN), located in [[Caselle Torinese]], about {{convert|13|km|0|abbr=on}} from the centre of Turin and connected to the city by a railway service (from Dora Station) and a bus service (from Porta Nuova and Porta Susa railway stations).\n\n{{As of|2010}} a [[bicycle sharing system]], the [[ToBike]], is operational.\n\nThe metropolitan area is served by [[Turin metropolitan railway service]].\n\nCentral districts are served by [[Trams in Turin|tram]], lines 3,4,9 are light-rail.\n[[File:Tram_in_Torino,_Italy.jpg|thumb|right|City tram, bus can be seen behind]]\n\n===Turin Public Transportation Statistics===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Turin, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 65 min. 14.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

Both [[Livy]]<ref>v. 34</ref> and [[Strabo]]<ref>iv. p.&nbsp;209</ref> mention the Taurini's country as including one of the passes of the [[Alps]], which points to a wider use of the name in earlier times.\n\n=== Roman era ===\nIn the 1st century BC (probably 28 BC), the Romans founded  ''Augusta Taurinorum''. The typical Roman street grid can still be seen in the modern city, especially in the neighbourhood known as the ''Quadrilatero Romano'' (Roman Quadrilateral). Via Garibaldi traces the exact path of the Roman city's [[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]] which began at the ''Porta Decumani'', later incorporated into the ''Castello'' or ''Palazzo Madama''. The ''Porta Palatina'', on the north side of the current city centre, is still preserved in a park near the Cathedral. Remains of the Roman-period [[Roman theatre (structure)| theatre]] are preserved in the area of the ''Manica Nuova''. Turin reached about 5,000 inhabitants at the time, all living inside the high city walls.\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n[[File:Arduino d'ivrea.jpg|thumb|right|[[Arduin of Italy|Arduin d'Ivrea]].]]\nAfter the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the town was conquered by the [[Heruli]] and the [[Ostrogoths]], recaptured by the [[Byzantine Empire|Romans]], but then conquered again by the [[Lombards]] and then the [[Franks]] of [[Charlemagne]] (773). The ''[[March of Turin|Contea di Torino]]'' (countship) was founded in the 940s and was held by the [[Arduin of Italy|Arduinic]] dynasty until 1050. After the marriage of [[Adelaide of Susa]] with [[Humbert I, Count of Savoy|Humbert Biancamano]]'s son [[Otto, Count of Savoy|Otto]], the family of the [[House of Savoy|Counts of Savoy]] gained control. While the title of count was held by the Bishop as count of [[County of Turin|Turin]] (1092\u20131130 and 1136\u20131191) it was ruled as a [[Prince-Bishop|prince-bishopric]] by the Bishops. In 1230\u20131235 it was a lordship under the [[List of rulers of Montferrat|Marquess of Montferrat]], styled Lord of Turin. At the end of the 13th century, when it was annexed to the Duchy of Savoy, the city already had 20,000 inhabitants. Many of the gardens and palaces were built in the 15th century when the city was redesigned. The [[University of Turin]] was also founded during this period.\n\n=== Early modern ===\n[[File:Torino 1500-1600 vista dall'alto.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Turin in the 17th century.]]\n[[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy|Emmanuel Philibert]], also known under the nickname of ''Iron Head'' (Testa 'd Fer), made Turin the capital of the Duchy of Savoy in 1563. Piazza Reale (named [[Piazza San Carlo]] today) and Via Nuova (current Via Roma) were added along with the first enlargement of the walls, in the first half of the 17th century; in the same period the ''Palazzo Reale'' ([[Royal Palace of Turin]]) was also built. In the second half of that century, a second enlargement of the walls was planned and executed, with the building of the arcaded Via Po, connecting Piazza Castello with the bridge on the Po through the regular street grid.\n\nIn 1706, during the [[Battle of Turin]], the French besieged the city for 117 days without conquering it. By the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] the Duke of Savoy acquired [[Sicily]], soon traded for [[Sardinia]], and part of the former [[Duchy of Milan]], and was elevated to king; thus Turin became the capital of a European kingdom. The architect [[Filippo Juvarra]] began a major redesign of the city; Turin had about 90,000 inhabitants at the time.\n\n=== Late modern and contemporary ===\n[[File:Maggi, Giovanni Battista - Torino - Panorama.jpg|thumb|left|A view of Turin in the late 19th century. In the background, the [[Mole Antonelliana]] under construction.]]\n\nTurin, like the rest of [[Piedmont]], was annexed by the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] in 1802. The city thus became the seat of the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of [[P\u00f4 (department)|P\u00f4]] [[Departments of France|department]] until the fall of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] in 1814, when the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia was restored with Turin as its capital. In the following decades, the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia led the struggle towards the [[Italian unification|unification of Italy]]. In 1861, Turin became the capital of the newly proclaimed united [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italiansrus.com/articles/torinohistory_part4.htm |title=Turin's History |publisher=Italianrus.com. Anthony Parenti |accessdate=9 May 2010}}</ref> until 1865, when the capital was moved to [[Florence]], and then to [[Rome]] after the 1870 conquest of the [[Papal States]]. The 1871 opening of the [[Fr\u00e9jus Rail Tunnel|Fr\u00e9jus Tunnel]] made Turin an important communication node between Italy and France. The city in that period had 250,000 inhabitants. Some of the most iconic landmarks of the city, like the [[Mole Antonelliana]], the [[Museo Egizio|Egyptian Museum]], the [[Gran Madre di Dio, Turin|Gran Madre di Dio church]] and ''Piazza Vittorio Veneto'' were built in this period. The late 19th century was also a period of rapid industrialization, especially in the automotive sector: in 1899 [[Fiat]] was established in the city, followed by [[Lancia]] in 1906. The [[Prima Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa Moderna|Universal Exposition]] held in Turin in 1902 is often regarded as the pinnacle of [[Art Nouveau]] design, and the city hosted the same event in [[Turin International|1911]]. By this time, Turin had grown to 430,000 inhabitants.\n[[File:19TorinoGranMadreDio.JPG|thumb|[[Gran Madre di Dio, Turin|Gran Madre di Dio]].]]\n\nAfter [[World War I]], harsh conditions brought a wave of strikes and workers' protests. In 1920 the [[Lingotto]] Fiat factory was occupied. The Fascist regime put an end to the social unrest, banning trade unions and jailing socialist leaders, notably [[Antonio Gramsci]]. On the other hand, [[Benito Mussolini]] largely subsidised the automotive industry, to provide vehicles to the army. \n\nTurin [[Bombing of Turin in World War II|was then a target of Allied strategic bombing during World War II]], being heavily damaged by the air raids in its industrial areas as well as in the city centre. Along with [[Milan]], [[Genoa]], and [[La Spezia]], Turin was one of Italy's four cities that experienced [[area bombing]] by the RAF; the heaviest raid took place on 13 July 1943, when 295 bombers dropped 763 tons of bombs, killing 792 people.<ref>[http://www.museotorino.it/view/s/3e6222e913ac45a49cbd7f81960f1cc7 Museotorino - Bombardamento 13 luglio 1943]</ref> Overall, these raids killed 2,069 inhabitants of Turin, and destroyed or damaged 54 % of all buildings in the city.<ref>[http://www.istoreto.it/torino38-45/download/torino38-45.pdf TORINO 1938|45. Una guida per la memoria]</ref><ref>[http://www.torinoinguerra.it/scheda_parola.asp?ID=10 Torinoinguerra - Bombardamenti]</ref>\n\nThe Allied's [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|campaign in Italy]] started off from the [[Southern Italy|South]] and slowly moved northwards in the following two years, leaving the northern regions occupied by Germans and collaborationist forces for several years. Turin was not captured by the Allies until the end of [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|Spring Offensive of 1945]]. By the time the vanguard of the armoured reconnaissance units of [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] reached the city, it was already freed by the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian Partisans]], that had begun revolting against the Germans on 25 April 1945. Days later, troops from the US Army's [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored]] and [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd Infantry Divisions]] came to substitute the Brazilians.<ref>[[Willis D. Crittenberger]], \"The final campaign across Italy\"; year of edition 1952 {{ISBN|85-7011-219-X}}</ref><ref>[[Mascarenhas de Moraes]], ''The Brazilian Expeditionary Force, By Its Commander'' US Government Printing Office, 1966. ASIN B000PIBXCG</ref>\n\nIn the postwar years, Turin was rapidly rebuilt. The city's automotive industry played a pivotal role in the [[Italian economic miracle]] of the 1950s and 1960s, attracting hundreds of thousands of immigrants to the city, particularly from the rural southern regions of Italy. The number of immigrants was so big that Turin was said to be \"the third southern Italian city after [[Naples]] and [[Palermo]]\". The population soon reached 1 million in 1960 and peaked at almost 1.2 million in 1971. The exceptional growth gains of the city gained it the nickname of ''the Automobile Capital of Italy'' and ''the [[Detroit]] of Italy'' (Turin has been \"twinned\" with Detroit since 1998). In the 1970s and 1980s, the oil and automotive industry crisis severely hit the city, and its population began to sharply decline, losing more than one-fourth of its total in 30 years. The long population decline of the city has begun to reverse itself only in recent years, as the population grew from 865,000 to slightly over 900,000 by the end of the century. In 2006, Turin hosted the [[2006 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympic Games]].\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Torino panorama Superga.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|left|Turin today]]\nTurin is located in [[northwest Italy]]. It is surrounded on the western and northern front by the Alps and on the eastern front by a high hill that is the natural continuation of the hills of [[Montferrat|Monferrato]]. Four major rivers pass through the city: the Po and three of its tributaries, the [[Dora Riparia]] (once known as ''Duria Minor'' by the Romans, from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] noun ''duria'' meaning \"water\"), the [[Stura di Lanzo]] and the [[Sangone (torrent)|Sangone]].\n\n=== Climate ===\nTurin features a European-[[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfa''), as does most of northern Italy. \n\nWinters are moderately cold and dry, summers are mild in the hills and quite hot in the plains. Rain falls mostly during spring and autumn; during the hottest months, otherwise, rains are less frequent but heavier (thunderstorms are frequent). During the winter and autumn months banks of fog, which are sometimes very thick, form in the plains<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.torino.it/canaleturismo/en/clima.htm |title=Torino Turistica \u2013 Servizio Telematico Pubblico \u2013 Citt\u00e0 di Torino |publisher=Comune.torino.it |accessdate=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429121444/http://www.comune.torino.it/canaleturismo/en/clima.htm |archivedate=29 April 2009}}</ref> but rarely on the city because of its location at the end of the [[Susa Valley]].\n\nIts position on the east side of the [[Alps]] makes the weather drier than on the west side because of the [[f\u00f6hn wind]] effect.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|37.1|C|F}}, while the lowest was {{convert|-21.8|C|F}}.\n{{Weather box\n|width = 100%\n|location = Torino (Giardini Reali), 1971\u20132000 normals, extremes 1946\u2013present\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 25.1\n|Feb record high C = 26.6\n|Mar record high C = 27.4\n|Apr record high C = 31.0\n|May record high C = 32.3\n|Jun record high C = 35.6\n|Jul record high C = 36.8\n|Aug record high C = 37.1\n|Sep record high C = 32.2\n|Oct record high C = 30.0\n|Nov record high C = 22.8\n|Dec record high C = 21.4\n|year record high C = 37.1\n|Jan high C = 6.6\n|Feb high C = 9.1\n|Mar high C = 13.4\n|Apr high C = 16.6\n|May high C = 20.7\n|Jun high C = 24.8\n|Jul high C = 27.9\n|Aug high C = 27.1\n|Sep high C = 23.0\n|Oct high C = 17.3\n|Nov high C = 11.1\n|Dec high C = 7.6\n|year high C = 17.1\n|Jan mean C = 2.0\n|Feb mean C = 4.3\n|Mar mean C = 8.1\n|Apr mean C = 11.1\n|May mean C = 15.5\n|Jun mean C = 19.4\n|Jul mean C = 22.4\n|Aug mean C = 21.8\n|Sep mean C = 17.8\n|Oct mean C = 12.4\n|Nov mean C = 6.5\n|Dec mean C = 3.1\n|year mean C = 12.0\n|Jan low C = -2.5\n|Feb low C = -0.7\n|Mar low C = 2.7\n|Apr low C = 5.7\n|May low C = 10.4\n|Jun low C = 14.0\n|Jul low C = 16.9\n|Aug low C = 16.5\n|Sep low C = 12.7\n|Oct low C = 7.4\n|Nov low C = 1.9\n|Dec low C = -1.6\n|year low C = 7.0\n|Jan record low C = -18.5\n|Feb record low C = -21.8\n|Mar record low C = -10.5\n|Apr record low C = -3.8\n|May record low C = -2.3\n|Jun record low C = 4.3\n|Jul record low C = 6.6\n|Aug record low C = 6.3\n|Sep record low C = 1.8\n|Oct record low C = -3.9\n|Nov record low C = -8.2\n|Dec record low C = -13.8\n|year record low C = -21.8\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 47.8\n|Feb precipitation mm = 47.1\n|Mar precipitation mm = 72.5\n|Apr precipitation mm = 113.3\n|May precipitation mm = 145.3\n|Jun precipitation mm = 104.3\n|Jul precipitation mm = 70.5\n|Aug precipitation mm = 76.1\n|Sep precipitation mm = 83.8\n|Oct precipitation mm = 106.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 69.1\n|Dec precipitation mm = 45.1\n|year precipitation mm = 981.0\n|Jan humidity = 75\n|Feb humidity = 75\n|Mar humidity = 67\n|Apr humidity = 72\n|May humidity = 75\n|Jun humidity = 74\n|Jul humidity = 72\n|Aug humidity = 73\n|Sep humidity = 75\n|Oct humidity = 79\n|Nov humidity = 80\n|Dec humidity = 80\n|year humidity = 75\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 5.4\n|Feb precipitation days = 4.4\n|Mar precipitation days = 5.8\n|Apr precipitation days = 8.6\n|May precipitation days = 11.2\n|Jun precipitation days = 8.6\n|Jul precipitation days = 5.8\n|Aug precipitation days = 7.7\n|Sep precipitation days = 6.4\n|Oct precipitation days = 7.0\n|Nov precipitation days = 5.6\n|Dec precipitation days = 4.4\n|year precipitation days = 80.9\n|Jan sun = 111.6\n|Feb sun = 118.7\n|Mar sun = 158.1\n|Apr sun = 180.0\n|May sun = 195.3\n|Jun sun = 219.0\n|Jul sun = 260.4\n|Aug sun = 223.2\n|Sep sun = 168.0\n|Oct sun = 142.6\n|Nov sun = 105.0\n|Dec sun = 108.5\n|year sun = 1990.4\n|source 1 = Italian Air Force Meteorological Service<ref name=MAM>{{cite web\n|url = http://clima.meteoam.it/AtlanteClim2/pdf/(059)Torino%20Caselle.pdf\n|title = Torino/Caselle (TO)\n|work = Atlante climatico\n|publisher = Servizio Meteorologico\n|accessdate = 11 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://clima.meteoam.it/web_clima_sysman/Clino6190/CLINO059.txt\n|title = STAZIONE  059-TORINO CASELLE: medie mensili periodo  61 \u2013 90\n|publisher = Servizio Meteorologico\n|language = Italian\n|accessdate = 11 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://climaintoscana.altervista.org/italia/stazioni-wmo/torino-caselle/\n|title = Torino Caselle: Record mensili dal 1946\n|publisher = Servizio Meteorologico dell\u2019Aeronautica Militare\n|language = Italian\n|accessdate = 11 December 2014}}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n{{Weather box    \n| width        = 100% <!-- 77% if there is a template or image next to it -->\n| collapsed    = y <!-- y, if you have normal updates -->\n| open         = \n| metric first = y <!-- always, except UK or US cities -->\n| single line  = y\n| location     = Turin ([[Italian Air Force]] -

Nonetheless the main street of the city centre, ''Via Roma'', was built during the Fascist era (from 1931 to 1937) as an example of [[Italian Rationalism]], replacing former buildings already present in this area.\n\nVia Roma runs between [[Piazza Carlo Felice]] and [[Piazza Castello, Turin|Piazza Castello]]. Buildings on the portion between Piazza Carlo Felice and [[Piazza San Carlo]] were designed by rationalist architect [[Marcello Piacentini]]. These blocks were built into a reticular system, composed by austere buildings in clear rationalist style, such as the impressive ''Hotel Principi di Piemonte'' and the former ''Hotel Nazionale'' in ''Piazza CLN''. Porches are built in a continuous [[entablature]] and marked with double columns, to be consistent with those of Piazza San Carlo. The section of the street between Piazza San Carlo and Piazza Castello was built in eclectic style, with arcades characterised by [[Serliana]]-type arches. To this day Via Roma is the street featuring the most fashionable boutiques of the city.\n\n[[File:Torino - Caval \u00ebd Brons latoB.jpg|thumb|right|''Piazza San Carlo'' and the ''Caval 'd Brons'' (Bronze Horse in Piedmontese language) equestrian monument to [[Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Savoy|Emmanuel Philibert]].]]\n\nVia Roma crosses one of the main squares of the city: the pedestrianized Piazza San Carlo, built by [[Carlo di Castellamonte]] in the 17th century. In the middle of the square stands the equestrian monument to [[Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Savoy|Emmanuel Philibert]], also known as ''Caval \u00ebd Brons'' in local dialect (\"Bronze Horse\"); the monument depicts the Duke sheathing his sword after the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Battle of St. Quentin]]. Piazza San Carlo arcades host the most ancient caf\u00e9s of the city, such as ''Caff\u00e9 Torino'' and ''Caff\u00e9 San Carlo''.\n\n[[File:529TorinoPalazzoReale.JPG|thumb|left|''Piazza Castello'' with [[Royal Palace of Turin|Palazzo Reale]] (Royal Palace) in the background.]]\n\nOn the northern edge of Via Roma stands ''Piazza Castello'', regarded as the heart of the city. The half-pedestrianized square hosts some significant buildings such as ''Palazzo Reale'' (Former Savoy Royal House), the ''Palazzo Madama'' (which previously hosted the Savoy senate and, for few years, the Italian senate after Italian unification), the former Baroque [[Teatro Regio di Torino]] (rebuilt in modern style in the 1960s, after being destroyed by fire), the [[Royal Library of Turin]] which hosts the [[Portrait of a man in red chalk (Leonardo)|Leonardo da Vinci self-portrait]], and the baroque [[San Lorenzo, Turin|Royal Church of San Lorenzo]]. Moreover, Piazza Castello hosts a Fascist era building, the [[Torre Littoria]], a sort of skyscraper which was supposed to become the headquarters of the Fascist party, although it never served as such. The building's style is quite different from the Baroque style of Piazza Castello. The square regularly hosts the main open space events of the city, live concerts included.\n\n[[File:Porta Nuova Piazza Carlo Felice Torino.JPG|thumb|left|''Porta Nuova'' main railway station, in front of ''Piazza Carlo Felice'' square (before restyling).]]\n\nAs for the southern part of the street, Via Roma ends in ''Piazza Carlo Felice'' and in its ''Giardino Sambuy'', a wide fenced garden right in the middle of the square. Across from Piazza Carlo Felice stands the monumental fa\u00e7ade of [[Torino Porta Nuova railway station|Porta Nuova railway station]], the central station of the city built between 1861 and 1868 by the architect Alessandro Mazzucchetti. The passengers building was  renovated to host a shopping mall and more efficient passenger service offices. However, it is still an example of monumental architecture, with its stately foyer and some Baroque sights, such as the ''Sala Reale'' (the former Royal waiting room).\n\n[[File:Torino, piazza Vittorio Veneto (04).jpg|thumb|right|''Piazza Vittorio Veneto'' square.]]\n\nIn ''Piazza Castello'' converge some of the main streets of the city centre. Among them one of the most significant is the arcaded ''Via Po'', built by [[Amedeo di Castellamonte]] in 1868 and featuring some interesting buildings, such as the first and original building of the [[University of Turin]] and the historical [[Caff\u00e8 Fiorio]], which was the favourite caf\u00e9 of the 19th-century politicians. Via Po ends in [[Piazza Vittorio Veneto, Turin|Piazza Vittorio Veneto]] (simply called Piazza Vittorio locally), the largest Baroque square in Europe and today heart of Turin nightlife. Piazza Vittorio features the most fashionable bars and not far from here, along the [[Po (river)|Po]] riverfront, the ''Murazzi'' quays used to host several bars and nightclubs open till the morning until a few years ago.\n\n[[File:Museo del Risorgimento italiano.JPG|thumb|right|Baroque fa\u00e7ade of [[Palazzo Carignano]], the [[Museum of the Risorgimento (Turin)|Museum of the Risorgimento]].]]\n\nParallel to Via Roma, other two popular pedestrian streets, namely ''Via Lagrange'' and ''Via Carlo Alberto'', cross the old town from Via Po to ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II''. Their recent pedestrianisation has improved their original commercial vocation. In particular, Via Lagrange has recently increased the presence of luxury boutiques. This street also hosts the [[Museo Egizio|Egyptian Museum of Turin]], home to what is regarded as one of the largest collections of Egyptian antiquities outside of Egypt.\n\nVia Lagrange and Via Carlo Alberto cross two significant squares of the city, respectively. The former crosses ''Piazza Carignano'', well known mainly for the undulating \u201cconcave \u2013 convex \u2013 concave\u201d Baroque fa\u00e7ade of [[Palazzo Carignano]]. This building used to host the ''Parlamento Subalpino'' (the \u201cSubalpine Parliament\u201d, [[Parliament of the Kingdom of Sardinia]] which also became the Italian Parliament for a few years, after the Italian unification) and today houses the [[Museum of the Risorgimento (Turin)|Museum of the Risorgimento]]. The square also features the [[Teatro Carignano]], a well-conserved Baroque theatre.\nVia Carlo Alberto crosses ''Piazza Carlo Alberto'', a big square hosting the rear fa\u00e7ade of Palazzo Carignano, in eclectic style. On the other side stands the monumental ''Biblioteca Nazionale'' (National Library).\n\n[[File:Torino-mole10.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mole Antonelliana]] some years ago.]]\n\nNot far from Via Po stands the symbol of Turin, namely the [[Mole Antonelliana]], so named after the architect who built it, [[Alessandro Antonelli]]. Construction began in 1863 as a Jewish [[synagogue]]. Nowadays it houses the [[National Museum of Cinema]] and it is believed to be the tallest museum in the world at {{convert|167|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The building is depicted on the Italian 2-cent coin.\n\n[[File:Cupola sindone.jpg|thumb|left|Dome of [[Turin Cathedral]].]]\n\nJust behind ''Piazza Castello'' stands the [[Turin Cathedral]], dedicated to Saint [[John the Baptist]], which is the major church of the city. It was built during 1491\u20131498 and is adjacent to an earlier [[bell tower]] (1470). Annexed to the cathedral is the [[Chapel of the Holy Shroud]], the current resting place of the [[Shroud of Turin]]. The Chapel was added to the structure in 1668\u20131694, designed by [[Guarino Guarini|Guarini]]. The [[Basilica of Corpus Domini]] was built to celebrate an alleged miracle which took place during the sack of the city in 1453, when a soldier was carrying off a [[monstrance]] containing the [[Blessed Sacrament]]; the monstrance fell to the ground, while the [[Sacramental bread|host]] remained suspended in air. The present church, erected in 1610 to replace the original chapel which stood on the spot, is the work of [[Ascanio Vitozzi]].\n\n[[File:Torino - Porta Palatina.jpg|thumb|Right|[[Palatine Towers]].]]\n\nNext to the Turin Cathedral stand the [[Palatine Towers]], an ancient [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman]]-medieval structure that served as one of four Roman [[city gate]]s along the [[city walls]] of Turin. This gate allowed access from north to the ''[[cardo]] maximus'', the typical second main street of a Roman town. The Palatine Towers are among the best preserved Roman remains in northern Italy. Close to this site, the {{convert|51,300|m2|0|adj=mid|abbr=off}} ''Piazza della Repubblica'' plays host to the biggest open market in Europe, locally known as ''mercato di Porta Palazzo'' (''Porta Palazzo'' or ''Porta Pila'' are the historical and local names of this area).\n\nWest of the Porte Palatine stands the ''Quadrilatero Romano'' (Roman Quadrilateral), the old medieval district recently renewed. The current neighbourhood is characterised by its tiny streets and its several medieval buildings and today it is popular for its ''[[Ap\u00e9ritif and digestif|aperitivo]]'' bars and its small shops run by local artisans. The hub of the Quadrilatero is ''Piazza Emanuele Filiberto''.\n\nSouth of the Quadrilatero Romano stands ''Via Garibaldi'', another popular street of the city. It is a {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} pedestrian street between Piazza Castello and ''Piazza Statuto'' which features some of the old shops of the city. Large ''Piazza Statuto'' is another example of Baroque square with arcades.\n\n[[File:Nouvelle gare TGV de Turin Porta Susa.jpg|thumb|left|[[Torino Porta Susa railway station|''Porta Susa'' railway station]].]]\n\nAnother main street of downtown is ''Via Pietro Micca'', which starts in Piazza Castello and ends in the large ''Piazza Solferino''. The street continues in ''Via Cernaia'' up to ''Piazza XXV Dicembre'', which features the former [[Porta Susa]] passengers building, relocated in 2012  a little more southward. The  new and larger passengers building is situated between ''Corso Bolzano'' and ''Corso Inghilterra'' and  is an example of contemporary architecture, being a {{convert|300|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and {{convert|19|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-high}} glass and steel structure. Porta Susa is currently the international central station of the city (high speed trains to Paris) and it is becoming the central hub of railway transportation of the city, being the station in which local trains (so-called ''Ferrovie Metropolitane''), national trains and high-speed national and international trains converge.\n\nClose to Via Cernaia stands the ''Cittadella'' (Citadel), located in the ''Andrea Guglielminetti garden''. What remains of the old medieval and modern fortress of the city, it is a starting point for a tour into the old tunnels below the city.\n\n=== San Salvario ===\n[[File:Borgo medievale TO.jpg|thumb|''Borgo Medievale''.]]\n[[File:Valentino castle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Castello del Valentino]] in [[Parco del Valentino]].]]\n\nSoutheast of the city centre stands ''San Salvario'' district, which extends from ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II'' to ''Corso Bramante'' and is delimited by the [[Turin-Genoa railway]] on the west side and by the Po river on the east side. Home to an increasing immigrants' community, the district is an example of integration among different cultures; it also features an incremented  nightlife after the opening of several low-cost bars and restaurants.\n\nSan Salvario is crossed by two main roads, ''Via Nizza'' and ''Via Madama Cristina'', and just as the city centre it is characterised by the [[grid plan]] typical of Turin's old neighbourhoods. The hub of the district is ''Piazza Madama Cristina'' which hosts a big open market, while several commercial activities flourish around it.\n\nThe celebrated [[Parco del Valentino]] is situated in the east side of San Salvario and, albeit not in downtown, it represents kind of central park of Turin. Thanks to the vicinity to the city centre, the park is very popular among the local people, during the day but also at night, because of the several bars and nightclubs placed here. From the terraces of Parco del Valentino, many sights of the hills on the other side of the river can be appreciated.\n\nIn the centre of the park stands the [[Castello del Valentino]], built in the 17th century. This castle has a horseshoe shape, with four rectangular towers, one at each angle, and a wide inner court with a marble pavement. The ceilings of the false upper floors are in ''transalpino'' (i.e. French) style. The fa\u00e7ade sports the huge coat of arms of the [[House of Savoy]]. Today, Castello del Valentino serves as the faculty of Architecture of the ''[[Polytechnic University of Turin|Polytechnic University of Turin]]''.\n\nAnother  cluster of buildings in the park is the ''Borgo Medievale'' (Medieval village), a replica of medieval mountain castles of Piedmont and Aosta Valley, built for the 1884 [[World's fair|International Exhibition]].\n\nOther  buildings in ''Corso Massimo d'Azeglio'' include the [[Torino Esposizioni]] complex (Turin's exhibition hall built in the 1930s) featuring a monumental entrance with a large full height porch, the circular building which hosts a night club, and the ''Teatro Nuovo'', a theatre mostly focused on ballets exhibitions. Another  building is the largest synagogue of the city, located in ''Piazzetta Primo Levi'' square. Its architecture stands in the main sight of the city, as characterised by four large towers \u2013 {{convert|27|m|ft|abbr=off}} high \u2013 topped by four onion-shaped domes.\n\n=== Crocetta ===\n[[File:MonumentoVittorioEmanueleII.JPG|thumb|right|''Monumento a Vittorio Emanuele II'']]\n[[File:Politecnico Torino.JPG|thumb|right|[[Polytechnic University of Turin|Turinese Institute of Technology ''Politecnico'']]]]\n[[File:Boulevard Spina Centrale Torino.JPG|thumb|left|The ''Spina Centrale'' is a new under-construction boulevard built over the undergrounded railway. It is already completed in ''Crocetta'']]\n\nSouth of ''Centro'' stands the ''Crocetta'' district, considered one of the most exclusive districts of the city, because of highly rated residential buildings. At the heart of the district is the partially pedestrianised area crossed by ''Corso Trieste'', ''Corso Trento'' and ''Corso Duca D'Aosta'', plenty of some notable residential buildings in eclectic, neo-Gothic and Art Nouveau style. The area was built between 1903 and 1937 replacing the old [[parade ground]], which was moved in the Southern part of the city.\n\nNorth of this area stands the ''GAM (Galleria d'Arte Moderna)'', one of the two Museum of Modern Arts of the Turin Metro area (the second and largest one is hosted in ''Castello di Rivoli'', a former Savoy Royal castle in the suburbs). The Museum stands in front a huge monument situated in the centre of the roundabout between ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II'' and ''Corso Galileo Ferraris'': the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II (Turin)|Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II]], a King of Savoy statue situated on a 39-meters high column. Next to the Museum, another significant residential building previously hosted the head office of [[Juventus]], one of the two main Turin football clubs.\n\nWest of this area, the main building of [[Polytechnic University of Turin]] stands along ''Corso Duca Degli Abruzzi''. The 1958 building, a {{convert|122,000|m2|0|adj=mid|abbr=off}} complex, hosts approximately 30,000 students and is considered one of the major Institutes of Technology of the country \u2013 mainly due to the vocation of the city for the industrialisation, pushed by the automotive sector. This institute recently expanded in the western district of ''Cenisia'' with additional modern buildings.\n\nCrocetta is crossed by large and modern avenues, such as ''Corso Duca degli Abruzzi'', ''Corso Galileo Ferraris'', and ''Corso Einaudi''. These avenues feature long rows of trees, symbolic of Turin's typical urbanity. However, the most popular avenue is ''Corso De Gasperi'', which, albeit smaller than other avenues of the district, hosts one of the most fashionable open markets of the city, the so-called ''Mercato della Crocetta'', in which it is possible to find some discounted branded clothing among the more popular ones.\n\nThe Western border of Crocetta is instead an example of contemporary architecture. The huge avenue, made up of ''Corso Mediterraneo'' and ''Corso Castelfidardo'', is part of ''Spina Centrale'' boulevard and was recently built over the old railway (now undergrounded): as a result, the avenue is very large (up to {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=off}}) and modern, having been rebuilt with valuable materials, including a characteristic lighting system supported by white high poles. This avenue hosts some examples of contemporary art, such as [[Mario Merz]]'s ''Igloo'' fountain or the [[Per Kirkeby]]'s ''Opera per Torino'' monument in ''Largo Orbassano''.\n\nThe East side of the district is also known as ''Borgo San Secondo'' and was so named after the church of the same name standing in ''Via San Secondo'', a major street in the neighbourhood. This area is located near ''Porta Nuova'' railway station and is actually older than the rest of the district, featuring several apartment buildings from the late 19th century, to include the birthplace and home of author [[Primo Levi]] on Corso Re Umberto.<ref>https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1989/01/19/my-house/</ref> A local open market is held in ''Piazza San Secondo'' and along ''Via Legnano''. The market square also hosts the former washhouse and public baths of the neighbourhood, among the oldest examples of their kind in Turin (1905).\n\nOne of the main thoroughfares crossing Borgo San Secondo is ''Via Sacchi'', which serves as an ideal gate to the city centre: its Serlian arcades on the west side of the street (the east side is enclosed by ''Porta Nuova'' railway station service buildings) host some significant boutiques and hotels, such as the historic ''Pfatisch'' pastry shop and the ''Turin Palace Hotel'' (totally refurbished and reopened in 2015). South of ''Via Sacchi'', ''Ospedale Mauriziano'' is one of the ancient and major hospitals of the city. Going further southwards, it is possible to appreciate an interesting residential cluster of old public housing gravitating around ''Via Arquata''.\n\n=== Cenisia ===\n\n[[File:PiazzaCarloAlbertoTorino.jpg|thumb|left|The Piazza Carlo Alberto.]]\n[[File:Aperitif for four.JPG|thumb|left|A typical Italian ''[[Aperitivo]]'']]\n\nBordered by ''Corso Castelfidardo'', ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II'', ''Corso Trapani'' and ''Corso Peschiera'', this small district is mainly significant for hosting the recent expansion of Turinese [[Institute of Technology]] ''[[Polytechnic University of Turin|Politecnico]]''. The expansion was possible after under-grounding the railway under ''Corso Castelfidardo'' and the subsequent disposal of the old buildings dedicated to the train maintenance present in this area (so-called ''Officine Grandi Riparazioni'' or ''OGR''). ''Politecnico'' expanded its facilities through two huge overpass buildings over the avenue, linked to new buildings on the west side. This cluster of buildings forms an evocative square with a unique architectural style. The main building on the west side hosts a [[General Motors]] research centre, the ''General Motors Global Propulsion Systems'' (formerly known as ''General Motors Powertrain Europe''). ''Politecnico'' area extends till ''Via Boggio'' with further facilities hosted in the former ''OGR'' facilities. The Institute plans to further build new facilities in the current parking area.\n\nNorth of ''Politecnico'' facilities, the main building of the ''OGR'' former cluster, which consists in three 180-meters long joint parallel buildings, became recently a big open space which hosts temporary exhibitions and during the hot seasons, its external spaces became a fashionable site to have a typical Italian ''[[aperitivo]]''.\n\nNorth of ''OGR'', a former prison complex called ''Le Nuove'' is a significant example of old European prison building. The complex was built between 1857 and 1869 during the reign of Victor Emmanuel II. After being disposed of during the 1990s, the complex was changed into a museum and it is possible to visit its facilities.\n\nAn example of contemporary art is the heating plant in ''Corso Ferrucci'', which has been covered with aluminium panels. Another building (19th century), now abandoned, is the former [[Westinghouse Brakes#Rail vehicles|Westinghouse]] factory of train brakes situated in ''Via Borsellino''.\n\nThe remaining part of the district is mainly formed by residential buildings with not significant architectural value. The district had its development mainly after the World War II, following the industrial development of the town \u2013 in particular, the expansion of [[Lancia]] automotive factories in the ''Borgo San Paolo'' neighbourhood, culminated in the construction of [[Palazzo Lancia]] in 1954, the company's former headquarters. Industrialization led to consequent population growth in the nearby areas, including ''Cenisia''. Main avenues which are crossing the district are ''Corso Ferrucci'' and ''Corso Racconigi''. This last one is hosting a huge daily open market, the ''Mercato di Corso Racconigi''.\n\n=== Cit Turin ===\n[[File:Palazzo della Vittoria - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|''Casa della Vittoria'' (1918-1920) is an example of Turin's neo-gothic architecture.]]\n\nThe smallest district of the city is ''Cit Turin'' (\"Little Turin\" in [[Piedmontese language]]). This small triangle surrounded by ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II'', ''Corso Francia'' and ''Corso Inghilterra'' hosts some high rated residential buildings and is regarded as a prestigious residential neighbourhood by local people.\n\n[[File:Grattacielo Intesa San Paolo - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|left|[[Intesa Sanpaolo]] banking group headquarters]]\n\nThe district features many buildings in [[Art Nouveau]], [[Art Deco]] and [[Neo-Gothic]] style. Among them, one of the most impressive and well known is the ''Casa Della Vittoria'' (architect ''Gottardo Gussoni''). Another notable example is [[Casa Fenoglio-Lafleur]]. Both buildings face Corso Francia.\n\nThe district is well known for its commercial vocation mainly in its two main streets, ''Via Duchessa Jolanda'' and ''Via Principi d'Acaja'', ideally crossing each other among the gardens ''Giardino Luigi Martini'', locally called ''Piazza Benefica'', which hosts a popular open market.\n\nThe district is also characterised by two massive recent buildings: the ''Palazzo di Giustizia'', Turin's new courthouse built in the 1990s (in a 350-metre long facility), and the first real skyscraper of Turin, the [[Torre Intesa Sanpaolo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world.intesasanpaolo.com/en/call_to_action/intesa-s-turin-tower-is-named-one-of-the-10-most-environmentally-friendly-new-buildings-in-the-world|title=Intesa\u2019s Turin tower is named one of the 10 most environmentally friendly new buildings in the world \u2013 Intesa Sanpaolo World|author=|date=|work=intesasanpaolo.com}}</ref> which house the headquarters of one of the major Italian private banks.\n\n=== San Donato ===\n[[File:Torino-CampanileChiesaDiNostraSignoradelSuffragio.png|thumb|upright=0.7|''Chiesa di Nostra Signora del Suffragio e Santa Zita'']]\n[[File:Torre littoria Torino.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The [[Torre Littoria]]]]\n\n''San Donato'' district is located between ''Corso Francia'', ''Corso Lecce'', ''Corso Potenza'', ''Via Nole'', the ''Parco Dora'' and ''Corso Principe Oddone''. It was populated since the medieval era, but becomes bigger during the 19th century, prospering around the canal ''Canale di San Donato'', which does not exist any more, currently replaced by the central street of the district, ''Via San Donato''. Buildings in the district are relatively recent (around 1820), except for the oldest group of small houses located in the area of ''Brusach\u0153r'' (''Palazzo Forneris'' building) located along ''Via Pacinotti'' near the small ''Piazza Paravia''. The conservation of the street and of this old building influences the straightness of ''Via San Donato'', which makes a slight curve to result in parallel with ''Via Pacinotti'' before ending in central ''Piazza Statuto ''square.\n\nMain church of the district is the ''Chiesa di Nostra Signora del Suffragio e Santa Zita'', which with its {{convert|83|m|ft|abbr=off}} height of its bell tower, is well known to be the fifth tallest structure in the city of Turin, after the [[Mole Antonelliana]], the [[Intesa Sanpaolo|Intesa-Sanpaolo skyscraper]], the [[Torre Littoria]] and the two pennons of the [[Juventus Stadium]]. The church is hosting the ''Istituto Suore Minime di Nostra Signora del Suffragio'' and it was promoted and designed by [[Francesco Fa\u00e0 di Bruno]]. The legend says, that he wanted to build the tallest bell tower of the town and put a clock on the top, to all the poor people to know the time for free. The small building near the church is what remains of ''Casa Tartaglino'', a small residential building which was also extended and modified by Faa di Bruno.\n\n''Villino Cibrario'' in ''Via Saccarelli'' is another significant building designed by Barnaba Panizza in 1842. The building was equipped with a large garden which was eliminated to host the street. The neighbourhood has a high concentration of historic buildings in Art Nouveau style designed by architect Pietro Fenoglio (among the others, the prestigious ''Villino Raby'' in Corso Francia 8). Other significant buildings are the  ''Villa Boringhieri'' in Via San Donato, and other Art Nouveau and Neo-Gothic buildings are situated in ''Via Piffetti ''and ''Via Durandi.''\n\nAmong the modern buildings of the district, the most significant one is, of course, the ''Torre BBPR'' Tower (which took the name from the architecture office who designed it). The building is representing the ''post-rationalism Italian architecture'' (same style of the better known [[Torre Velasca]] tower in the city of Milan). The tower is facing the central ''Piazza Statuto'' square.\nThe district is crossed by some significant avenues: on ''Corso Svizzera'', which crosses the district from North To South, faces the Business Centre ''Piero Della Francesca'', where the offices of ''Tuttosport,'' one of the three national sports daily newspapers has its head offices. Also on ''Corso Svizzer''a, stands one of the oldest hospitals of the city, the ''Ospedale Amedeo di Savoia'', specialised in infectious diseases. Other major avenues are ''Corso Umbria'' and ''Corso Tassoni''.\n\nAnother big avenue, which borders the district on its East, is ''Corso Principe Oddone'', which in the past was along the railway to Milan. Currently the railway has been under-grounded: the avenue will be enlarged and have same architecture style of southern ''Corso Inghilterra'' in downtown, becoming one of the major avenue of Turin.\nThe northern part of the district was part of the former industrial district of Turin, recently reconverted to a park called ''Parco Dora''. Mainly, in ''San Donato'' the portion reconverted was the one occupied by the plant of [[Michelin]] (west of ''Via Livorno'') and [[Fiat|FIAT]] ironwork plants (on the East). Differently for other portions of ''Parco Dora'', this part has been totally reconverted to park without letting any evidence of the industrial area except for the cooling tower which stands along ''Corso Umbria'' and became a symbol of the park. Works are completed in the western area, where ''Corso Mortara'' has been closed to traffic and moved just a bit northern and covered by an artificial tunnel. It is possible to access the southern shore of the ''Dora'' river. South of the Park, an interesting architecture of different levels is hosting a new shopping mall called ''Centro Commerciale Parco Dora''. East of ''Via Livorno'', works are still partially in progress, with the Dora river still to be uncovered by a big slab, on which the [[Fiat|FIAT]] plants used to stand). West of ''Via Livorno'', the ''Environment Park'' is a research centre for renewable energy.\n\n=== Aurora ===\n[[File:BorgoDora.JPG|thumb|right|Tiny streets of ''Borgo Dora'']]\n\n''Aurora'' is one of the most ancient districts which developed out of the medieval [[Defensive wall|city walls]], north of the historical city centre. It stretches from downtown northern boundaries in ''Corso Regina Margherita'' (an extended and important thoroughfare of Turin) up to ''Corso Vigevano'' and ''Corso Novara'' in the North Side (namely the old [[excise]] boundary till the early 20th century); the western boundary is ''Corso Principe Oddone'' (now part of the ''Spina Centrale'' boulevard) and the eastern border is the Dora river.\n\nThe district was named Aurora after the so-called ''Cascina Aurora'', an old farmstead lying north of the Dora river, right at the intersection between ''Corso Giulio Cesare'' and ''Corso Emilia''. The farmstead has long been demolished and the area has been converted to office buildings, hosting the Turinese textile company ''Gruppo Finanziario Tessile'' (''GFT'') headquarters until the early 21st century.\n\nThe historical hub of the district is ''Borgo Dora'' (The \"Dora Borough\"), a small neighbourhood next to ''Porta Palazzo'' and enclosed by ''Corso Regina Margherita'', ''Via Cigna'', the Dora river and ''Corso Giulio Cesare''. Once known as ''Borgo del Pallone'' (literally \"Ball Borough\") or ''Balon'' in [[Piedmontese dialect]] ({{IPA-it|ba\u02c8lun|local}}), this neighbourhood is famous for its ''mercatino del Balon'' or simply ''Balon'', the Turinese [[flea market]] that opens every Saturday in its tiny and twisted streets. Borgo Dora hosts several remarkable places, such as: ''Piccola Casa della Divina Provvidenza'' (\"Little House of the Divine Providence\"), also known as ''Cottolengo'', a well-known charitable organization which has been operating for almost 200 years in the city; ''Arsenale della Pace'' (\"Arsenal of Peace\"), a former weapons factory that currently hosts the headquarters of ''SERMIG'' (''Servizio Missionario Giovani''), a nonprofit association which assists poor and homeless people; ''Caserma Cavalli'' (\"Cavalli Barracks\"), one of the most representative buildings of the district, a former barracks topped by a clock tower which now hosts ''Scuola Holden'', a storytelling and performing arts school; the evocative ''Cortile del Maglio'' (\"Mallet Courtyard\"), a covered pedestrian area featuring bars and clubs. Across from Cortile del Maglio and Arsenale della Pace stands a wide pedestrian area which features a [[hot air balloon]], a clear allusion to the neighbourhood's old name ''Balon'': recently installed, the balloon is open to public which can now take an interesting view of the city from this new high observation point.\n\nRight at the borders of Borgo Dora stands part of ''Porta Palazzo'' open market which hosts the [[New Exhibition Hall (Turin)|New Exhibition Hall]], designed by the Italian architect [[Massimiliano Fuksas]]. The building has replaced the ''Clothes Market'', one of the four covered pavilions of Porta Palazzo market, but unfortunately, this glass green-shaded building has been highly criticized because of its lack of usability for commercial activities, albeit an example of contemporary architecture.\n\nAnother interesting building at the borders of the neighbourhood is [[Torino Porta Milano railway station|Porta Milano]] (a.k.a. ''stazione della Ciri\u00e8-Lanzo''), a former 19th-century railway station that marked the terminus of Ciri\u00e8-Lanzo railway line until the 1980s. To this day, the station is no longer in use as well as the rails up to ''Piazza Baldissera''. The station building was recently renovated and now hosts some old locomotives, even though it is not open to the public. Unfortunately, the old rails crossing the district are totally disused and neglected, adding decay to the whole area.\n\nBorgo Dora, as many other pockets of Aurora, is characterized by the marked multi-ethnicity of its population, being home to a large community of immigrants from emerging countries.\n\n[[File:Santuario di Maria Ausiliatrice Torino.jpg|thumb|right|''Santuario di Maria Ausiliatrice'']]\n\nWest of Borgo Dora stands ''Rione Valdocco'' (\"Valdocco neighbourhood\"), enclosed by ''Via Cigna'', ''Corso Regina Margherita'', ''Corso Principe Oddone'' and the Dora river. This neighbourhood hosts the significant architecture of ''Santuario di Maria Ausiliatrice'' (\"Maria Ausiliatrice Sanctuary\") in the homonymous square and behind the church stands ''San Pietro in Vincoli'' old cemetery.\n\nOverall, the main thoroughfares of the West side of Aurora are ''Via Cigna'', which crosses the district from North to South, ''Corso Vercelli'', a historical avenue starting north of the Dora river, and ''Corso Principe Oddone'', part of the long ''Spina Centrale'' boulevard that will be built over the underground [[Turin-Milan railway]]. However, the Spina Centrale project is proceeding slowly because of the lack of funds and the boulevard is still occupied by a large worksite along its span. Once completed, Aurora district will be connected to Eastern ''San Donato'', thanks to a better connection among the roads of the two adjacent districts (i.e. ''Corso Ciri\u00e8'' will continue in ''Corso Gamba'' and ''Strada del Fortino'' in ''Corso Rosai'').\n\nAs for the rest of Aurora, the district is crossed by an important thoroughfare named ''Corso Giulio Cesare'', a long boulevard that extends from Porta Palazzo up to [[Autostrada A4 (Italy)|Turin-Trieste motorway]] entrance in the Northern urban fringe of Turin. Other significant roads are ''Corso Palermo'', ''Via Bologna'' and ''Corso Regio Parco'', mostly in the East side of Aurora which is known as ''Borgo Rossini'' (\"Rossini Borough\"). Albeit not a road, the Dora river is also a significant element for the whole district, since it completely crosses it from West to East.\n\n[[File:Caff\u00e8 corretto (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Lavazza]], famous Turin coffee brand]]\n\nThe area north of the river features a mix of old residential buildings and remains of former factories and facilities from the 20th century. An example are the remains of [[FIAT]] ''Officine Grandi Motori'' (''OGM'') in Corso Vigevano, an old factory that produced big industrial and automotive Diesel engines, a sort of symbol of the industrial history of Turin. Another disused facility is ''Astanteria Martini'' (\"Martini Emergency Department\") in Via Cigna, a former emergency department from the 1920s which has been lying vacant since long.\n\nAs for the old residential buildings of the area, this part of Aurora hosts the oldest [[public housing]] block of the city, built by ''Istituto Autonomo Case Popolari'' (''IACP'') in 1908 in lieu of an old dilapidated small farm once known as ''Chiabotto delle Merle''.\n\nDespite its run-down look, the famous [[Lavazza]] coffee company, along with ''IAAD'' School of Design, chose this part of the city as the location for their new headquarters, which will be built in a contemporary building dubbed ''Nuvola'' (\"Cloud\") right at the borders of ''Borgo Rossini''. Designed by the architect Gino Zucchi, this project is still a work in progress but excavations in the area revealed the remains of a medieval cemetery and an early Christian basilica; these findings will be preserved and will be shown to the public.\n\n''Borgo Rossini'' hosts a number of businesses, for instance, the ''[[Kappa (company)|Robe di Kappa]]'' flagship store (Kappa is a noted Italian sportswear brand founded in Turin) and the ''Cineporto'' (\"Cineport\") a.k.a. ''La Casa dei Produttori'' (\"The Filmmakers' House\", which hosts the ''Turin Piedmont Film Commission Foundation'').\n\n=== Vanchiglia ===\n[[File:Torino, grattacielo della Regione Piemonte (03).jpg|right|thumb|[[Piedmont Region Headquarters]] (209 m), one of the tallest skyscrapers in Italy.]]\n[[File:La Fetta di Polenta - panoramio.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Fetta Di Polenta, northern side]]\n''Vanchiglia'' is bordered by ''Corso San Maurizio, Corso Regio Parco'' and the Po river, crossed also by the [[Dora Riparia]] river and by two big avenues, ''Corso Regina Margherita'' and ''Corso Tortona''.\n\n''Borgo Vanchiglia'' is the historical district: a little triangle next to downtown, situated between ''Corso San Maurizio, Corso Regina Margherita'' and the [[Po (river)|Po]] river. The district is quite popular nowadays because being quite closer to the heart of Turin nightlife ''Piazza Vittorio Veneto,'' many bars and restaurants opened recently in this area. However, Vanchiglia also includes the area called ''Vanchiglietta'', north of ''Borgo Vanchiglia''.\n\nNotable church in ''Borgo Vanchiglia'' is the French neo-Gothic ''Chiesa di Santa Giulia'' situated into ''Piazza Santa Giulia''.\n\nA notable and unusual building in the area is the so-called ''\"[[Fetta di Polenta]]\"'' (literally: \"[[polenta]] slice\"), formerly known as ''Casa Scaccabarozzi.'' This building is located at the intersection of ''Corso San Maurizio'' and ''Via Giulia di Barolo'', and it is one of the most peculiar examples of Turin architecture: a thin trapezoid 27 meters wide on ''Via Giulia Di Barolo'', 5 meters on ''Corso San Maurizio'' and just 0.70 meters wide on the opposite end. It was designed in 1840 by [[Alessandro Antonelli]] for his wife, Francesca Scaccabarozzi, probably because of a bet. The curious name comes from the shape of the palace, which resembles a \"slice of polenta\", and also because it is painted with an ocher colour.\n\nIn the surroundings, in ''Via Vanchiglia 8'', (although in downtown and not really in ''Vanchiglia'' anymore) there is another trapezoid house, albeit with less extreme design: similarly, this building is nicknamed ''\"Fetta di Formaggio\"'' (cheese slice), built in 1832 for the rich ''Marchese Birago di Vische'' by the architect ''Antonio Talentino''.\n\nOther notable buildings are the town public baths, eclectic building built in 1905 (''Corso Regina Margherita'' crossing ''Via Vanchiglia''), and the''Teatro della Caduta'' theatre, opened in 2003 in ''Via Michele Buniva 23'', which with its 45 seats is the smallest theatre in Turin and among the smallest theatres in Europe.\n\nIn Corso Regina Margherita, another notable building is the former ''Opera pia Reynero'', a charitable organization. The building was built in 1892. Being abandoned for a long time after it closed in 1996, it was then occupied by the Askatasuna Social Center, a non-profit anarchic organization, hosting since then various activities such as concerts, dinners, seminars and homeless solidarity initiatives.\n[[File:Campus Luigi Einaudi Torino - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|upright=2.8|Campus Luigi Einaudi]]\nNorth of ''Corso Regina Margherita'', district is losing the flavour and architecture typical of Turin downtown, cause a significant portion of the district was formerly occupied by factories, nowadays partially abandoned or replaced by modern buildings. A significant example was the area occupied by gas companies between Corso Regina Margherita and the Dora river, which were partially demolished to make place to the new modern Faculty of Law building (Campus \"Luigi Einaudi\"), designed by the architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]]. This building was classified by the American television company CNN among the 10 most spectacular university buildings in the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/spectacular-university-buildings/index.html|title=10 of the world's most spectacular university buildings to impress travellers |date=19 February 2014|work=CNN Travel|access-date=10 August 2017}}</ref> In the campus courtyard, a large wood statue representing a bull (symbol of Turin) has been erected by [[Mario Ceroli]]. The area hosts also a student campus.\n\nNext to the campus, a new cycling and pedestrian bridge on the Dora river was opened on 16 April 2010, linking the campus area to ''Corso Verona.'' Bridge is entitled to the architect ''Franco Mellano''.\n\n''Parco Colletta'' is a big park area touched by the two rivers of the district, which also hosts some sport facilities, mainly football fields and a swimming pool.\n\nThe district is completed by the ''Cimitero Monumentale'' cemetery. This huge complex (formerly known as ''Cimitero Generale'') is the largest cemetery in Turin, and among the first in Italy for the number of buried people (over 400,000). It is located close to the ''Colletta'' park. The ancient part of the cemetery rises from the main entrance of Corso Novara with his octagonal shape. It contains numerous historical tombs and 12&nbsp; km of arcades, enriched by artistic sculptures (that's why is called \"monumental cemetery\"). Over the years there have been subsequent extensions of the central historical body in the direction of the Colletta park. In the cemetery, there is a crematory temple built in 1882, the second largest in Italy after that of Milan one.\n\n=== Main churches ===\n[[File:Duomo Torino.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turin Cathedral]] featuring the [[Sindone Chapel|Chapel of the Holy Shroud]].]]\n[[File:Basilica di superga.jpg|thumb|right|[[Basilica of Superga]].]]\n{{See also|List of places of worship in Turin}}\nThe [[Santuario della Consolata]], a sanctuary much frequented by pilgrims, stands on the site of the 10th-century Monastery of St. Andrew, and is a work by Guarini. It was sumptuously restored in 1903. Outside the city are: the [[Basilica of Our Lady Help of Christians, Turin|Basilica of Our Lady, Help of Christians]] built by St. [[John Bosco]], the [[Gran Madre di Dio, Turin|Gran Madre]] built in 1818 on occasion of the return of King [[Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia]] and [[Monte dei Cappuccini, Turin|Santa Maria del Monte]] (1583) on Monte dei Cappuccini.\n\nIn the hills overlooking the city, the [[Basilica of Superga]] provides a view of Turin against a backdrop of the snow-capped Alps. The basilica holds the tombs of many of the dukes of Savoy, as well as many of the kings of Sardinia. Superga can be reached by means of the [[Superga Rack Railway]] from Sassi suburb. The Basilica of Superga was built by [[Amadeus II of Savoy]] as an ex-voto for the liberation of Turin (1706), and served  as a royal mausoleum since 1772.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Turin |title=Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Turin \u2013 Wikisource |publisher=En.wikisource.org |date=7 March 2007 |accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Villas, parks and gardens ===\n\n[[File:Borgomedievale sul PO.jpg|thumb|The medieval village in [[Parco del Valentino|Valentino Park]].]]\n[[File:Area dei Laghi.jpg|thumb|[[La Mandria Regional Park]].]]\n\nThe most popular park in the city is [[Parco del Valentino]]. In 1961, during the celebrations of ''Italia61'' ([[Italian unification]] centenary), an important international exhibition (''FLOR61: Flowers of the world in Turin'') took place in the park with 800 exhibitors from 19 countries. For the occasion the plan for the new lighting of the park, along with its fountains and paths, was assigned to Guido Chiarelli, the head engineer at the city hall.\n\nOther large parks are ''Parco della Pellerina'', ''Parco Colletta'', ''Parco Rignon'', ''Parco Colonnetti'' and the [[Orto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Torino|University botanical gardens]]. Around the city, there are several other parks, such as [[La Mandria Regional Park]] and the [[Parco naturale di Stupinigi|Parco della Palazzina di Caccia di Stupinigi]], once hunting grounds of the Savoy, and those situated on the hill of Turin. Many parks are smaller, located in the various districts: there is also a total of 240 playgrounds in these parks. In the early 1960s, mayor [[Amedeo Peyron]] had the first garden in Italy with games for children inaugurated. According to a [[Legambiente]] report from 2007, Turin is the first Italian city as far as structures and policies on childcare are concerned.<ref>[http://www.legambientepiemonte.it/doc/05-01-07% 20com% 20St% 20ecosistema% 20bambino% 202007.pdf Ecosystem child.

The park is located in Parella suburb (Turin's West Side) and it plays host to various concerts in summer.\n\n[[Rosa Vercellana]], commonly known as ''Rosina'' and, in [[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]] as ''La Bela Rosin'' (\"the beautiful Rosin\"), was the [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] and later wife of King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]]. She was made Countess of Mirafiori and Fontanafredda, but never Queen of Italy. As the Savoy family refused to allow her to be buried next to her husband in the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], her children had a mausoleum built for her in a similar form and on a smaller scale in Turin, next to the road to the Castello di Mirafiori. The circular copper-domed [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] monument, surmounted by a [[Latin cross]] and surrounded by a large park, was designed by [[Angelo Dimezzi]] and completed in 1888.<ref>[http://www.piemontefeel.org/en/interesse/elemento-206.html \u2018Mausoleo della Bela Rosin\u2019], ''Piemontefeel'' (Regione Piemonte, 2005).</ref><ref name=\"parks\">[http://www.parks.it/parco.po.to/pun.torinese.html \u2018Parco fluviale del Po tratto torinese: Punti di Interesse\u2019], Parks.it (Rome: Federazione Italiana Parchi e Riserve Natural).</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Historical populations\n|type=\n|footnote= Source: [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] 2001\n|1901 |329691\n|1911 |415667\n|1921 |499823\n|1931 |590753\n|1936 |629115\n|1951 |719300\n|1961 |1025822\n|1971 |1167968\n|1981 |1117154\n|1991 |962507\n|2001 |865263\n|2011 |872367\n|2015 |897265\n}}\n\nIn 2009, the city proper had a population of about 910,000, which is a significant increase on the 2001 census figure.

It is kept in the royal chapel of the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in the city centre. The shroud is one of the city's main symbols and tourist attractions, and despite historical and scientific evidence pointing to it being a 14th-century forgery, it is a symbol of [[Catholic devotion|religious devotion]].\n\nAfter it had been little more than a town for a long time, in 1559 the Duke [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy|Emmanuel Philibert]] of Savoy made Turin the capital of his domains. The Duke had the ambition to transform the city into a major artistic and cultural capital, and in the following centuries numerous  artists were to work at the Savoy court, especially architects and planners like [[Carlo di Castellamonte]] and his son [[Amedeo Castellamonte|Amedeo]], [[Guarino Guarini]] and, in the 18th century, [[Filippo Juvarra]] and [[Benedetto Alfieri]].\n\n[[File:Palazzo Madama, Torino (9).JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Palazzo Madama, Turin|Palazzo Madama e Casaforte degli Acaja]]]]\nAs for the painting and the visual arts, Turin became a point of reference, especially in the 20th century. In the 1920s, the painter [[Felice Casorati (painter)|Felice Casorati]] inspired a number of students called [[The group of six of Turin]] and these included [[Carlo Levi]], [[Henry Paolucci]], [[Gigi Chessa]], [[Francis Menzio]], [[Nicola Galante]] and [[Jessie Boswell]]. Artists  born in Turin include the sculptor [[Umberto Mastroianni]] and the architect [[Carlo Mollino]]. Between the 1960s and the 1970s, the international centre of Turin ([[Arte Povera]]), the presence in the city of artists like [[Alighiero Boetti]], [[Mario Merz]], [[Giuseppe Penone]], [[Piero Gilardi]] and [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]]. In those years there was a strong artistic influence of designer [[Armando Testa]]. Artists currently operating in the city include [[Ugo Nespolo]] and [[Carol Rama]].\n\n=== The Opera Houses ===\nOne of these was [[Teatro Regio di Torino]] where Puccini premiered his ''[[La Boh\u00e8me]]'' in 1896. It burned down in 1936 and was rebuilt after WW II.\n\n=== Literature ===\n[[File:Biblioteca Nazionale di Torino.jpg|thumb|right|National Library]]\nA literary centre for many centuries, Turin began to attract writers only after the establishment of the court of the [[House of Savoy|Dukes of Savoy]]. One of the most famous writers of the 17th century was [[Giambattista Marino]], which in 1608 moved to the court of [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy|Charles Emmanuel I]]. Marino suffered an assassination attempt by a rival, [[Gaspare Murtola]], and was later imprisoned for a year because of gossip that he had said and written against the duke. Perhaps, because of this, in 1615 Marino left Turin and moved to France.\n\nThe main literary figures during the Baroque age in Turin were [[Emanuele Tesauro]] and [[Alessandro Tassoni]]. In the next century Torino hosted the poet [[Vittorio Alfieri]] from Asti for a while. The situation was very different in the 19th century, especially since the city became a point of reference for Italian unification and, subsequently, the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. Indeed, in those years Tommaseo, Settembrini and [[John Meadows (author)|John Meadows]] resided in the city. A major literary and cultural woman of that time was [[Olimpia Savio]]. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Turin was home to writers such as [[Guido Gozzano]], [[Edmondo De Amicis]], [[Emilio Salgari]] and Dino Segre, the latter known by the pseudonym of [[Pitigrilli]].\n[[File:IB teatro regio.jpg|thumb|right|Teatro Regio]]\nTurin had a very important role in Italian literature after World War II. For the publishing house founded by [[Giulio Einaudi]]  worked figures such as [[Cesare Pavese]], [[Italo Calvino]], [[Vitaliano Brancati]], [[Primo Levi]], [[Natalia Ginzburg]], [[Fernanda Pivano]], [[Beppe Fenoglio]], [[Carlo Fruttero]] and [[Franco Lucentini]]. In more recent years, writers active in the city are [[Giovanni Arpino]], [[Nico Orengo]], [[Giuseppe Culicchia]], [[Margherita Oggero]], [[Laura Mancinelli]], [[Alessandra Montrucchio]], [[Alessandro Perissinotto]], [[Guido Quartz]], [[Piero Soria]] and [[Alessandro Baricco]]. Baricco was also among the founders of the [[Scuola Holden]], dedicated to writing techniques teaching.\n\nIn the local [[Piedmontese language]] has a literary tradition, with names such as [[Nicoletto da Torino]], [[Ignas Isler]], author of epic poems, and [[Eduard Calv]].\n\n=== Media ===\n{{Main|List of radio stations in Turin}}\nAfter [[Alexandria]], [[Madrid]], [[New Delhi]], [[Antwerp]] and [[Montreal]], Turin was chosen by [[UNESCO]] as [[World Book Capital]] for the year 2006.

As such, it forms the birthplace of [[Italian cinema]]. Because of its historic, geographical and cultural proximity to France, Italian filmmakers were naturally influenced by [[Cinema of France|French cinema]] and the [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8re brothers]]. The first Italian cinema screening occurred in Turin in March 1896. In November 1896, Italian filmmakers performed the first cinema screening of a film before a fee-paying audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaniaci.it/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=38 |title=\"Le proiezioni cinematografiche a Torino\" \u2013 di Pierluigi Capra |publisher=Cinemaniaci.it |date=|accessdate=12 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nBy the start of the 20th century (especially after 1907), a number of the first Italian films were aired in Turin.

Every year Turin organizes ''CioccolaT\u00d2'', a two-week chocolate festival run with the main Piedmontese chocolate producers, such as [[Pierre Paul Caffarel|Caffarel]], Streglio, [[Venchi]] and others, as well as some big international companies, such as [[Lindt & Spr\u00fcngli]].\n\nAs for [[snack food]], the now popular [[Tramezzino|tramezzini]] were first served in a historic caf\u00e9 of downtown Turin, namely ''Caff\u00e8 Mulassano'', where they were devised in 1925 as an alternative to [[Cuisine of England|English]] [[tea sandwich]]es.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.lastampa.it/Torino/cmsSezioni/costume/200808rticoli/7805girata.asp |title=Il tramezzino \u00e8 nato da Mulassano |newspaper=La Stampa |date=8 May 2008 |language=Italian}}{{dead link|date=February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://lastampa.it/2013/11/04/societa/cucina/reportage/a-tavola/recensione/il-pranzo/qui-nato-il-tramezzino-e-si-sente-12q3K83mI7IQoam7Bsc44O/pagina.html |language=Italian |newspaper=La Stampa |title=Qui \u00e8 nato il tramezzino e si sente |first=Rocco |last=Moliterni |date=11 April 2013 |access-date=8 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032031/http://lastampa.it/2013/11/04/societa/cucina/reportage/a-tavola/recensione/il-pranzo/qui-nato-il-tramezzino-e-si-sente-12q3K83mI7IQoam7Bsc44O/pagina.html |archive-date=2 May 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In recent years, another trademark drink of the city is ''MoleCola'', an Italian [[Coca-Cola]] that entered production in 2012 and quickly spread both in Italy and outside its native country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bevimolecola.it/la-storia/ |title=La Storia \u2013 Molecola |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |language=Italian |website=Bevimolecola.it |trans-title=History \u2013 Molecola |access-date=8 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nLocal cuisine also features a particular type of pizza, so-called ''[[Pizza#Italy|pizza al padellino]]'' or ''[[Pizza#Italy|pizza al tegamino]]'', which is basically a small-sized, thick-crust and deep-dish pizza typically served in several Turin pizza places.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agrodolce.it/2014/04/03/torino-la-riscoperta-della-pizza-al-padellino/ |title=Torino: la riscoperta della pizza al padellino |publisher=Agrodolce |accessdate=8 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gelapajo.it/pizza-al-padellino-che-cose/ |title=Pizza al padellino (o tegamino): che cos'\u00e8? |publisher=Gelapajo.it |accessdate=8 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210202900/http://www.gelapajo.it/pizza-al-padellino-che-cose/ |archivedate=10 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://torino.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/01/19/news/beniamino_il_profeta_della_pizza_gourmet-50867170/?refresh_ce |title=Beniamino, il profeta della pizza gourmet |publisher=Torino \u2013 Repubblica.it |accessdate=8 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nSince the mid-1980s, Piedmont has also benefited from the start of the [[Slow Food]] movement and [[Terra Madre]], events that have highlighted the rich agricultural and vinicultural value of the [[Po Valley]] and [[northern Italy]].\n\n== Education ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Luigi enaudi campus.jpg|thumb|right|[[University of Turin]]: the Einaudi campus.]] -->\n\n:''Main page: [[:category:Education in Turin|Education in Turin]]''\n[[File:Loggiato Universit\u00e0 di Torino.jpg|right|235px|thumb|Hall of the Rectorate Palace of the University of Turin]]\nTurin is home to one of Italy's oldest universities, the [[University of Turin]], including its affiliated [[Collegio Carlo Alberto]], which ranks among the best universities in the country. Another established university in the city is the [[Polytechnic University of Turin]], ranking among Top 50 universities in the world and #1 in Italy in the fields of engineering, technology and computer science (\"Academic Ranking of World Universities\" published by [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]). Turin also hosts the [[United Nations System Staff College]], the [[European Training Foundation]], and a campus of the [[ESCP Europe]] business school, ranked among the 10 best business schools in Europe. Moreover, the city hosts three small English language post-secondary institutions: [[St. John International University]], [[International University College of Turin]], and the  [[Turin School of Development]], as well as [http://www.buddies.it/ Buddies Elementary School].\n\n== Transport ==\n{{See also|Gruppo Torinese Trasporti|ToBike}}\n[[File:Torino PortaSusa galleria.jpg|thumb|left|[[Porta Susa]] railway station]]\nThe city currently has a large number of rail and road work sites. Although this activity has increased as a result of the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], parts of it had long been planned. Some of the work sites deal with general roadworks to improve traffic flow, such as underpasses and flyovers, but two projects are of major importance and will radically change the shape of the city.\n\nOne is the ''Spina Centrale'' (\"Central Spine\") project which includes the doubling of a major railway crossing the city, the [[Turin-Milan railway]] locally known as ''Passante Ferroviario di Torino'' (\"Turin Railway Bypass\"). The railroad previously ran in a trench, which will now be covered by a major boulevard running from North to South of Turin, in a central position along the city. [[Torino Porta Susa railway station|Porta Susa]], on this section, will become Turin's main station to substitute the terminus of [[Torino Porta Nuova railway station|Porta Nuova]] with a through station. Other important stations are [[Torino Stura railway station|Stura]], [[Torino Rebaudengo Fossata railway station|Rebaudengo]], [[Torino Lingotto railway station|Lingotto]] and [[Madonna di Campagna]] railway stations, though not all of them belong to the layout of the Spina Centrale.\n\n[[File:MetroTorinoMassaua.jpg|thumb|right|Turin [[Massaua (Turin Metro)|Massaua]] metro station]]\n\nThe other major project is the construction of a subway line based on the [[V\u00e9hicule Automatique L\u00e9ger|VAL]] system, known as [[Turin Metro|Metrotorino]]. This project is expected to continue for years and to cover a larger part of the city, but its first phase was finished in time for the [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Olympic Games]], inaugurated on 4 February 2006 and opened to the public the day after. The first leg of the subway system linked the nearby town of [[Collegno]] with Porta Susa in Turin's city centre. On 4 October 2007, the line was extended to Porta Nuova and then, in March 2011, to Lingotto. A new extension of the so-called ''Linea 1'' (\"Line 1\") is expected in the near future, reaching both [[Rivoli, Piedmont|Rivoli]] (up to Cascine Vica hamlet) in the Western belt of Turin and ''Piazza Bengasi'' in the Southeast side of the city. Furthermore, a ''Linea 2'' is in the pipeline that will connect the south-western district of Mirafiori with Barriera di Milano in the north end. In June 2018, the project entered the public consultation phase with the proposed list of 23 stations published on the city's website.<ref>{{cite web|title=M2TO Progetto Premliminare della Linea 2|url=http://www.comune.torino.it/trasporti/bm%7Edoc/180626_ppt_invio.pdf|publisher=Citta di Torino|accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref> \n[[File:Air Dolomiti E195 (8542367226) (2).jpg|thumb|right|[[Turin Caselle Airport|Turin Caselle International Airport]]]]\n\nThe main street in the city centre, ''Via Roma'', runs atop a tunnel built during the fascist era (when ''Via Roma'' itself was totally refurbished and took on its present-day aspect). The tunnel was supposed to host the underground line but it is now used as an underground car park. A project to build an underground system was ready in the 1970s, with government funding for it and for similar projects in [[Milan]] and Rome. Whilst the other two cities went ahead with the projects, Turin's local government led by mayor Diego Novelli shelved the proposal as it believed it to be too costly and unnecessary.\n\nThe city has an international airport known as [[Turin Caselle Airport|Caselle International Airport]] [[Sandro Pertini]] (TRN), located in [[Caselle Torinese]], about {{convert|13|km|0|abbr=on}} from the centre of Turin and connected to the city by a railway service (from Dora Station) and a bus service (from Porta Nuova and Porta Susa railway stations).\n\n{{As of|2010}} a [[bicycle sharing system]], the [[ToBike]], is operational.\n\nThe metropolitan area is served by [[Turin metropolitan railway service]].\n\nCentral districts are served by [[Trams in Turin|tram]], lines 3,4,9 are light-rail.\n[[File:Tram_in_Torino,_Italy.jpg|thumb|right|City tram, bus can be seen behind]]\n\n===Turin Public Transportation Statistics===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Turin, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 65 min. 14.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

Increased attention has been given to this season as authorities and government attempt to preempt any future loss of life after the [[Black Saturday bushfires]] during the previous season, [[2008\u201309 Australian bushfire season|2008\u201309]]. Long range weather observations predict very hot, dry and windy weather conditions during the [[summer]] months, leading to a high risk of bushfire occurrence.\n\nIn late September, several bushfires affected southeastern and northern [[Queensland]]. In October, bushfires affected much of the central latitudes of Australia, across [[Western Australia]], Queensland and [[New South Wales]]. In early November, a heat wave across southeastern Australia and high bushfire risk weather, precipitated a series of bushfires in those states, particularly [[South Australia]], where 6 people were injured in separate incidents. In December, a further 5 people were injured and a helicopter pilot killed, whilst fighting bushfires in NSW. Later that month, a 60-year-old man and three other men suffered burns whilst fighting fires in Southern NSW, while major fires burnt in the [[Riverina]], far east [[Gippsland]] and [[Port Lincoln, South Australia|Port Lincoln]].\n\nBetween Christmas and New Years 2009, bushfires affected the northern and central [[Wheatbelt (Western Australia)|Wheatbelt]] of Western Australia, destroying 37 homes and about 3,000 hectares (7,410 acres) of bushland. In early January 2010, Victoria and South Australia experienced \"Catastrophic\" category fire conditions, and on 10 January, a CFA volunteer was killed and 2 others injured after a fire truck rolled en route to a fire near Mansfield, in Victoria's north east.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Major Victorian bushfires in the 2000s.PNG|thumb|right|350px|Major bushfires in Victoria throughout the 2000s]]\nMany parts of Australia, particularly southeastern Australia, have been in drought for the last 10\u201315 years. This has increased the fuel load potential by drying out vegetation, and increases the potential occurrence of hot temperature and high wind combinations that precipitate extreme bushfire conditions. The drought has increased potential for extreme conditions throughout the last decade.\n\nMajor fires in the Victorian Alps during the 2003 and 2006/07 seasons and areas north-east of Melbourne in 2009, burnt large areas of vegetation in these areas resulting in reduced fuel loads in large areas of Victoria. However, other regions have not experienced major bushfires for a decade or longer, notably in the [[Otway Ranges|Otways]], Mount Macedon, Southwest coast and much of the [[Dandenong Ranges|Dandenongs]], requiring increased awareness and preparedness preceding the 2009-10 season, including controlled burns, general community preparations and overall education and awareness of the general population.\n\n==Predictions and assessments==\nThroughout mid-2009, the Victorian State Government has warned that the 2009\u201310 season has the potential to be \"worse\" than the 2008\u201309 season, however opponents suggest that this coming season has the same potential risk as several of the preceding seasons, but that increased awareness of the future bushfire season in general is a positive thing. A list of 52 towns in Victoria that are deemed to be most at risk was released by the Victorian State Government in August 2009. This list is separate from the Royal Commission's interim report released around the same time. The nominated centers will take priority for developing \"township protection plans\".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/08/18/2659099.htm | title=Bushfire hit list: 52 towns at risk | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date=18 August 2009 | accessdate=27 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe Royal Commission into the [[Black Saturday bushfires]] of the preceding season released its interim report on 17 August 2009, including recommendations for the 2009-10 season and other future seasons. The recommendations included, better warning systems, increased public awareness and education preceding the season, and better chain of command within and between all relevant authorities, amongst much else.\n\n==Fires of note==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"6%\" align=\"center\" | State\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" | Start date\n!

of the state. From 22 September, fires were burning west of [[Ingham, Queensland|Ingham]] where half a dozen properties were affected by fires. Another fire began the same day on the Mount Lindsay Highway at Cedar Creek, south-west of [[Brisbane]].\n\nAs of the 25 September, seven bushfires were burning at Coochin Creek, Cedar Pocket, east of Gympie, Neurum, west of Woodford, Beelbi Creek, north of Maryborough, at Johnstown, south-east of Murgon and near Roma and Injune in southern Queensland. Around half of the state has been under total fire ban since the 22 September.\n\n===October===\nStrong westerly winds fanned several bushfires across the central latitudes of Australia during October 2009, mostly in the states of [[Western Australia]], [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]]. At least 20 fires are burning across Queensland, several large fires in Western Australia's Kimberly region and several fires on NSW Central Coast, as of 16 October.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/10/15/2715357.htm |work= ABC.net.au | title=Homes threatened as fires ravage three states | date=15 October 2009 | accessdate=27 August 2010 | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] }}</ref>\n\n;WA\nThroughout October, bushfires burnt around 800,000 hectares of land in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]].

This was the second major heatwave in the region within 10 months. On 19 November, strong winds and storms abated the heat wave and increased risk of bushfires.\n\n;VIC\nOn 10 November, three controlled burns in Victoria breached containment lines following wind gusts and high 30 degree temperatures, one 15 hectare fire in Point Nepean and two in Gippsland, one of which burnt over 1,000 hectares. On 20 November, a cool change brought strong winds and storms to much of the state causing damage to buildings and other structures. The high winds fanned several small bushfires including a 40-hectare fire at Dorodong, north-west of Casterton and a 180-hectare fire in the [[Cobboboonee National Park]] near Heywood in the state's south west.\n\n;SA\nOn 19 November, Around 20,000 lightning strikes occurred in South Australia as storms and cold fronts abated the November heat wave, Adelaide recording a temperature of 43. The strikes ignited over 100 fires across the state. Over 1,000 hectares have thus far been burnt on the [[Yorke Peninsula]], where five people were injured when two CFS trucks collided in heavy smoke near [[Curramulka, South Australia|Curramulka]]. Another firefighter near Kingston was injured in a separate incident. Over 2,000 personnel aided firefighting efforts across the state during these fires.\n\n;NSW\nDozens of fires ignited between the 19 and 20 November were burning in north, central and western New South Wales, and on Sydney's northern outskirts. 1000 personnel were deployed on the fire front, 2 homes were damaged and approximately 3,000 hectares burnt in NSW in total.\n\n;TAS\nA number of bushfires near Swansea and St Helens on the east coast of Tasmania destroyed 5 houses, no one was injured.\n\n===December===\n;NSW\n\n[[File:Aftermath of the Gregadoo bushfire.jpg|thumb|A field burnt during the [[Gregadoo, New South Wales|Gregadoo]] bushfire, in southern New South Wales, December 2009]]\n\nOn 8 December, 90 fires were burning across New South Wales with 1,600 firefighters in attendance. A father and son suffered serious burns whilst defending property after a bushfire flared up in the central-west New South Wales town of Vittoria, near [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]]. Both were taken to [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] Base Hospital for treatment before being transferred to Concord Hospital in [[Sydney]].\n\nThe same fire forced the closure of the [[Mitchell Highway]], between Bathurst and Orange. Every region of NSW was under a high to catastrophic fire danger for 9 December and total fire bans remained in effect for the central ranges, northern slopes, northwestern and upper central west plains regions.\n\nBetween 9 and 10 December, 3 helicopters were involved in separate incidents fighting the fires.

In December, a further 5 people were injured and a helicopter pilot killed, whilst fighting bushfires in NSW. Later that month, a 60-year-old man and three other men suffered burns whilst fighting fires in Southern NSW, while major fires burnt in the [[Riverina]], far east [[Gippsland]] and [[Port Lincoln, South Australia|Port Lincoln]].\n\nBetween Christmas and New Years 2009, bushfires affected the northern and central [[Wheatbelt (Western Australia)|Wheatbelt]] of Western Australia, destroying 37 homes and about 3,000 hectares (7,410 acres) of bushland. In early January 2010, Victoria and South Australia experienced \"Catastrophic\" category fire conditions, and on 10 January, a CFA volunteer was killed and 2 others injured after a fire truck rolled en route to a fire near Mansfield, in Victoria's north east.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Major Victorian bushfires in the 2000s.PNG|thumb|right|350px|Major bushfires in Victoria throughout the 2000s]]\nMany parts of Australia, particularly southeastern Australia, have been in drought for the last 10\u201315 years. This has increased the fuel load potential by drying out vegetation, and increases the potential occurrence of hot temperature and high wind combinations that precipitate extreme bushfire conditions. The drought has increased potential for extreme conditions throughout the last decade.\n\nMajor fires in the Victorian Alps during the 2003 and 2006/07 seasons and areas north-east of Melbourne in 2009, burnt large areas of vegetation in these areas resulting in reduced fuel loads in large areas of Victoria. However, other regions have not experienced major bushfires for a decade or longer, notably in the [[Otway Ranges|Otways]], Mount Macedon, Southwest coast and much of the [[Dandenong Ranges|Dandenongs]], requiring increased awareness and preparedness preceding the 2009-10 season, including controlled burns, general community preparations and overall education and awareness of the general population.\n\n==Predictions and assessments==\nThroughout mid-2009, the Victorian State Government has warned that the 2009-10 season has the potential to be \"worse\" than the 2008-09 season, however opponents suggest that this coming season has the same potential risk as several of the preceding seasons, but that increased awareness of the future bushfire season in general is a positive thing. A list of 52 towns in Victoria that are deemed to be most at risk was released by the Victorian State Government in August 2009. This list is separate from the Royal Commission's interim report released around the same time. The nominated centers will take priority for developing \"township protection plans\".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/08/18/2659099.htm | title=Bushfire hit list: 52 towns at risk | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date=18 August 2009 | accessdate=27 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe Royal Commission into the [[Black Saturday bushfires]] of the preceding season released its interim report on 17 August 2009, including recommendations for the 2009-10 season and other future seasons. The recommendations included, better warning systems, increased public awareness and education preceding the season, and better chain of command within and between all relevant authorities, amongst much else.\n\n==Fires of note==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"6%\" align=\"center\" | State\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" | Start date\n!

Another fire began the same day on the Mount Lindsay Highway at Cedar Creek, south-west of [[Brisbane]].\n\nAs of the 25 September, seven bushfires were burning at Coochin Creek, Cedar Pocket, east of Gympie, Neurum, west of Woodford, Beelbi Creek, north of Maryborough, at Johnstown, south-east of Murgon and near Roma and Injune in southern Queensland. Around half of the state has been under total fire ban since the 22 September.\n\n===October===\nStrong westerly winds fanned several bushfires across the central latitudes of Australia during October 2009, mostly in the states of [[Western Australia]], [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]].
