The song was written by Alex Geringas, Paddy Dalton and songwriter [[Busbee (songwriter)|Busbee]], which lyrically talks about how actions talk louder than words. Musically, the song is a [[club music|club]]-inspired song. \"Show Me\" premiered on [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] on August 3, 2011, and was released on August 23, 2011 via [[Hollywood Records]].\n\n\"Show Me\" is composed as an uptempo [[dance-pop]] and [[electropop]] song with a [[synthpop]] beat. The song received mostly positive reviews, with [[music critics]] complimenting its club anthem-like nature and the synth pop associated with it. The song peaked at number one on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] in the United States, becoming Sutta's first solo number-one single and first [[The Pussycat Dolls|Pussycat Doll]] to ever top the Billboard Club chart as a solo artist. \"Show Me\" is Jessica's second time at the top following her 2007 collaboration with [[Dave Aud\u00e9]], \"[[Make It Last (Dave Aud\u00e9 song)|Make It Last]]\" while her [[Paul Van Dyk]] feature \"[[White Lies (Paul van Dyk song)|White Lies]]\" peaked at No. 3 in the same year.<ref>http://blog.divareport.com/2011/11/fromer-pcd-member-jessica-sutta-tops.html</ref>\n\nA music video was shot for the single, featuring Sutta in an underground club, dancing to the track. The video received positive reviews, with some finding similarities to [[Janet Jackson]]'s \"[[All Nite (Don't Stop)]]\" and [[Britney Spears]]' \"[[Till the World Ends]]\". The song was featured in the [[ABC Family]] original movie \"[[Teen Spirit (2011 film)|Teen Spirit]]\". A remix EP was released on iTunes.\n\n==Background and release==\nWritten by [[Busbee (songwriter)|Busbee]], [[Alex Geringas]] and Paddy Dalton, and produced by Busbee (who has also penned tracks for [[Timbaland]] and [[Katy Perry]]'s \"[[If We Ever Meet Again]]\" and [[Lady Antebellum]]), \"Show Me\" explodes with shuffle-fueled energy, reaffirming Jessica as the soulful vocalist. \"\n{{cquote|\"I've had a love of dance music for as long as I can remember.

It then goes underground and the song starts to play. Sutta is seen walking with a smile, while the other people are dancing around her. As she walks to the dance floor, a guy catches her eye and she smiles flirtatiously at him before she walks away and the guy proceeds to follow after her. During the video, Jessica and her crew crank the floor-shaking energy up so high that the power goes out. This doesn't stop the party, however, as everyone seems to have brought their flashlights along and begin to dance seductively while some of the dancers engage in public displays of affections with their love interests. This is followed by the flashlight-wielding guy she conveniently bumps into earlier looking for her at the party, searching various rooms filled with some couples making out while a girl applying her makeup writes the song's title on the bathroom mirror in lipstick. Before the clip is over, the power comes back on and everyone on the dance floor dances more energetically while the flashlight-wielding guy finally reunites with his love interest Sutta and the two of them proceed to bump and grind in dance-pop bliss. The video then ends while Jessica smiles to the camera and then fades away.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://idolator.com/5977131/jessica-sutta-show-me-video|title=Jessica Sutta Finds Love In The Underground In Her \"Show Me\" Video|publisher=Idolator|accessdate=2010-08-18}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Digital download <ref name=\"US Single\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GLS5O6|title=Show Me - Jessica Sutta: MP3 Downloads|publisher=Amazon.com|date=2011-08-23|accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref>\n| title1  = Show Me\n| length1 = 3:44\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Remixes EP <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GLS5IW|title=Show Me - Jessica Sutta: MP3 Downloads|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref>\n| title1  = Show Me\n| note1   = [[Dave Aud\u00e9]] Club Mix\n| length1 = 7:09\n| title2  = Show Me\n| note2   = [[Alex Gaudino]] and Jason Rooney Club Mix\n| length2 = 6:34\n| title3  = Show Me\n| note3   = [[Ralphi Rosario]] Club Mix\n| length3 = 8:09\n}}\n\n==Chart performance==\n\"Show Me\" debuted as the No. 1 Breakout Song <ref name=\"Show me Dave Aud\u00e9 Remix\">{{cite web |url=http://www.daveaude.com/news/2011/jessica-sutta-show-me-billboard-hot-shot-debut/|title=Dave Aud\u00e9 remix of Show Me is this week's Billboard Hot Shot Debut|publisher=([[Dave Aud\u00e9]].com)|accessdate=2011-08-23}}</ref> on the Billboard Dance Chart entering the [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] at number 39 on the issue dated 23 August 2011.<ref name=\"Billboard Charts\">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/column/chartbeat/chart-highlights-dance-club-play-country-1005324502.story|title=Billboard Chart Highlights: Dance/Club Play|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=2011-08-23}}</ref> The following week, August 31, 2011, \"Show Me\" climbed to number twenty-nine.

It then goes underground and the song starts to play. Sutta is seen walking with a smile, while the other people are dancing around her. As she walks to the dance floor, a guy catches her eye and she smiles flirtatiously at him before she walks away and the guy proceeds to follow after her. During the video, Jessica and her crew crank the floor-shaking energy up so high that the power goes out. This doesn\u2019t stop the party, however, as everyone seems to have brought their flashlights along and begin to dance seductively while some of the dancers engage in public displays of affections with their love interests. This is followed by the flashlight-wielding guy she conveniently bumps into earlier looking for her at the party, searching various rooms filled with some couples making out while a girl applying her makeup writes the song's title on the bathroom mirror in lipstick. Before the clip is over, the power comes back on and everyone on the dance floor dances more energetically while the flashlight-wielding guy finally reunites with his love interest Sutta and the two of them proceed to bump and grind in dance-pop bliss. The video then ends while Jessica smiles to the camera and then fades away.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://idolator.com/5977131/jessica-sutta-show-me-video|title=Jessica Sutta Finds Love In The Underground In Her \"Show Me\" Video|publisher=Idolator|accessdate=2010-08-18}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Digital download <ref name=\"US Single\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GLS5O6|title=Show Me - Jessica Sutta: MP3 Downloads|publisher=Amazon.com|date=2011-08-23|accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref>\n| title1  = Show Me\n| length1 = 3:44\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Remixes EP <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GLS5IW|title=Show Me - Jessica Sutta: MP3 Downloads|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref>\n| title1  = Show Me\n| note1   = [[Dave Aud\u00e9]] Club Mix\n| length1 = 7:09\n| title2  = Show Me\n| note2   = [[Alex Gaudino]] and Jason Rooney Club Mix\n| length2 = 6:34\n| title3  = Show Me\n| note3   = [[Ralphi Rosario]] Club Mix\n| length3 = 8:09\n}}\n\n==Chart performance==\n\"Show Me\" debuted as the No. 1 Breakout Song <ref name=\"Show me Dave Aud\u00e9 Remix\">{{cite web |url=http://www.daveaude.com/news/2011/jessica-sutta-show-me-billboard-hot-shot-debut/|title=Dave Aud\u00e9 remix of Show Me is this week's Billboard Hot Shot Debut|publisher=([[Dave Aud\u00e9]].com)|accessdate=2011-08-23}}</ref> on the Billboard Dance Chart entering the [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] at number 39 on the issue dated 23 August 2011.<ref name=\"Billboard Charts\">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/column/chartbeat/chart-highlights-dance-club-play-country-1005324502.story|title=Billboard Chart Highlights: Dance/Club Play|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=2011-08-23}}</ref> The following week, August 31, 2011, \"Show Me\" climbed to number twenty-nine.

The Prep School kept the original houses.\nThe new houses are named after other Brothers of the Sacred Heart schools in North America (given in brackets):\n*{{color box|lightblue}} Charles ([[Mount Saint Charles Academy]])\n*{{color box|green}} Guertin ([[Bishop Guertin High School]])\n*{{color box|navy}} Joseph ([[St. Joseph High School (Metuchen, New Jersey)|St. Joseph High School]])\n*{{color box|gold}} Martin ([[Brother Martin High School]]), formerly Vandebilt ([[Vandebilt Catholic High School]]), until 2011\n*{{color box|red}} McClancy ([[Monsignor McClancy Memorial High School]])\n*{{color box|purple}} Stanislaus ([[Saint Stanislaus College]])\nCurrent students were assigned to the new Houses by drawing balls from a hat. New students entering the College that year were assigned randomly and this practice continued for all new students afterwards, however students related to other boys already enrolled in the college in the school are usually placed in the same house.\n\nStudents houses are represented in the school uniform by the colour of their tie (taking the respective colours as given above). Prep and Sixth Form Students have their own school tie, as do [[prefects]].\n\n== Curriculum ==\nSt Columba's College provides a broad curriculum linked to the national curriculum and also to [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster|Diocese of Westminster]] rules - mandating the teaching of Religious Studies for a set period every week. At [[GCSE]], core subjects include English (Literature and Language), Mathematics, Double Science and Religious Studies. It is also compulsory for [[Key Stage 4]] students to take a modern language for at least one out of their three GCSE options.\n\nSince September 2012, the College introduced a new timetable of 7x 50 minute lessons, designed to give students more teaching time during the week. This was a change from the previous 7x 45 minute lessons, plus a 20-minute tutor period. This change resulted in the school day ending at 3.45pm, instead of 3.40pm.\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n{{alumni|date=March 2019}}\n[[Alumnus|Old boys]] of the school are called [[:Category:People educated at St Columba's College, St Albans|Old Columbans]].\n*[[Conor Burns]], MP for [[Bournemouth West (UK Parliament constituency)|Bournemouth West]] and Minister of State for International Trade\n*[[Bill Grimsey]], CEO of [[Focus (DIY)]], formerly CEO of [[Wickes]], [[The Big Food Group]] and [[Iceland (supermarket)|Iceland]].\n*[[Mark Lawson]], broadcaster\n*[[Mick Luckhurst]], former [[American football]] player\n*[[Jim McCaffrey]], former professional footballer\n*[[John Payne (singer)]], singer with rock band Asia\n*[[Julian Perretta]], [[singer-songwriter]]\n*[[Saving Aimee]], band\n*[[Matt Ball (footballer)|Matt Ball]], footballer\n*[[Colin Grant (author)|Colin Grant]], author\n*[[Peter Townsend (golfer)|Peter Townsend]], golfer.\n*[[Sacha Baron Cohen#Education|Sacha Baron Cohen]], actor, attended St. Columba\u2019s Prep School\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://www.stcolumbascollege.org/}}\n\n{{Schools in Hertfordshire|independent}}\n{{Schools of the Brothers of the Sacred Heart|Europe}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Columba's College, St Albans}}\n[[Category:Roman Catholic independent schools in the Archdiocese of Westminster]]\n[[Category:Member schools of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]]\n[[Category:Independent schools in Hertfordshire]]\n[[Category:Boys' schools in Hertfordshire]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1939]]\n[[Category:1939 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Schools in St Albans]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2015}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2019}}\n{{Infobox school\n| name                    = bob's school\n| image                   = \n| alt                     = \n| caption                 = \n| motto                   = {{Lang-la|Cor ad Cor Loquitur}}\n| motto_translation       = Heart speaketh to heart\n| address                 = King Harry Lane\n| city                    = [[St Albans]]\n| county                  = [[Hertfordshire]]\n| postcode                = AL3 4AW\n| country                 = UK\n| coordinates             = {{Coord|51.743|-0.35|type:edu_region:GB_dim:100|format=dec|display=inline,title}}\n| other_name              = <!-- or | other_names = -->\n| former_name             = <!-- or | former_names = -->\n| type                    = [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|Independent]] [[day school]]\n| religious_affiliation   = [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]\n| established             = {{Start date|1939}}\n| founder                 = Phillip O\u2019Neil\n| closed                  = \n| local_authority         = [[Hertfordshire County Council]]\n| oversight               = [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster]]\n| trust                   = \n| urn                     = 117638\n| ofsted                  = \n| headmaster              = David Buxton<ref>{{cite web |title=Welcome from the Headmaster |url=http://www.stcolumbascollege.org/389/about-us/welcome-from-the-headmaster |website=St Columba's College |accessdate=29 January 2019}}</ref>\n| staff                   = \n| gender                  = [[Single-sex education|Boys]]\n| age_range               = 4\u201318\n| enrolment               = 835 (2018)<ref name=\"GOV.UK\">{{cite web |title=St Columba's College |url=https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/Establishments/Establishment/Details/117638 |website=Get information about schools |publisher=GOV.UK |accessdate=29 January 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n| capacity                = 865<ref name=\"GOV.UK\" />\n| campus_size             = \n| campus_type             = \n| houses                   = {{Unbulleted list|{{Color box|Lightblue}} Charles|{{Color box|Green}} Guertin|{{Color box|Navy}} Joseph|{{Color box|Gold}} Martin|{{Color box|Red}} McClancy|{{Color box|Indigo}} Stanislaus}} Prep School Houses: {{Unbulleted list|{{Color box|Darkgreen}} Alban|{{Color box|Yellow}} Becket|{{Color box|Red}} Fisher| {{Color box|Darkblue}} More}}\n| colours                 = Black, red and white {{Color box|Black}}{{Color box|Red}}{{Color box|White}}\n| accreditation           = <!-- or | accreditations = -->\n| publication             = {{Hlist|Opus|The Columban}}\n| newspaper               = \n| yearbook                = \n| affiliation             = [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]]\n| alumni                  = [[#Notable alumni|Old Columbans]]\n| website                 = {{URL|www.stcolumbascollege.org}}\n| footnotes               = \n}}\n\n'''St Columba's College''' is a 4\u201318 [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent]], [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[day school]] and [[sixth form]] for [[Single-sex education|boys]] in [[St Albans]], [[Hertfordshire]], England.

It reached number three on the U.S. ''[[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]'' chart in September 1984. Worldwide, the song is her most commercially successful single after \"[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]\" and \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\", and reached number 46 on the ''[[UK Singles Chart]]'' and number 6 on the ''[[ARIA Singles Chart]]''. \"She Bop\" was her third consecutive Top 5 on the ''Hot 100''. The song is also featured in the film ''[[Never Been Kissed]].''\n\n==Song information==\nThe song was considered controversial, as it dealt with the subject matter of female  [[masturbation]]. It was also included on the [[Parents Music Resource Center]]'s \"Filthy Fifteen\" list, due to its sexual lyrics;  this led to the creation of the [[Parental Advisory]] sticker.  (Other songs on the \"[[Parents Music Resource Center|Filthy Fifteen]]\" list included tracks by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and [[AC/DC]].) In an interview on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', Lauper stated that she recorded the vocals of the song while nude.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/archive/peoplearchive.php/Cyndi_Lauper/biography/|title=Cyndi Lauper Biography|work=Monsters and Critics|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829165412/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/archive/peoplearchive.php/Cyndi_Lauper/biography/|archivedate=August 29, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nLauper said she wanted little kids [[Double entendre|to think the song was about dancing, and to understand the real meaning as they got older]].

(This was done in metaphor showing teenagers as fast-food-consuming zombies.) There are many [[double entendre]]s indicating the song's true meaning, including a magazine that Lauper is staring at titled \"[[Beefcake magazine|Beefcake]]\" and other sexual meanings such as the \"self-service\" sign and three gas pumps with the signs Good, Better and Nirvana in the cartoon part of the video, the vibrating motorcycle, the \"masterbingo\" part of the video with \"Uncle Siggy\" [[Sigmund Freud]] as host, and Lauper wearing blackout glasses with a white cane in several scenes of the video.  The video is highly suggestive that the term \"She Bop\" is referencing female masturbation. The video does not go as far as the lyrics, as the magazine referenced in the song (\"...in the pages of a ''[[Blueboy (magazine)|Blueboy]]'' magazine\") was a popular gay erotica magazine of the time, whereas the magazine Lauper holds represents the tamer \u2014 and somewhat closeted \u2014 erotica of an earlier era. Nor did the lyrical reference come out of the blue: Lauper has stated that finding a copy of ''Blueboy'' lying around in the recording studio provided the impetus for writing \"She Bop.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/03/cyndi-lauper-she-bop-_n_5083703.html|title=Cyndi Lauper\u2019s \u2018She Bop\u2019 Was Inspired By Gay Porn Magazine Blueboy |website=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=February 2, 2016 |accessdate=September 18, 2016}}</ref>\nThe music video was directed by Edd Griles.<ref>http://www.mvdbase.com/video.php?id=16169</ref> Mark Marek designed the characters in the animated sections of this music video, which were produced and directed by Jerry Lieberman, of NYC's Jerry Lieberman Productions. <ref>{{cite web|title=Toonzone Goes \"MAD\" Interviewing Kevin Shinick and Mark Marek|url=https://www.toonzone.net/toonzone-goes-mad-interviewing-kevin-shinick-and-mark-marek/|website=Toonzone.|accessdate=4 April 2018|date=6 September 2010}}</ref> and the cover of the US 12\" version.<ref>http://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-She-Bop/release/531814</ref> [[Wendi Richter]] and [[Lou Albano]] appear in the video, with Richter lip-synching the first few lines of the song.<ref>http://whatculture.com/wwe/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-wendi-richter?page=6</ref>\n\n==Formats and track listings==\n'''US/UK 7\" Single'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=She Bop|others=[[Cyndi Lauper]]|date=1984|type=US 7-inch Single liner notes|publisher=[[Portrait Records]]|id=37-04516}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=She Bop|others=[[Cyndi Lauper]]|date=1984|type=UK 7-inch Single liner notes|publisher=[[Portrait Records]]|id=A 4620}}</ref>\n#\"She Bop\" \u2013 3:47\n#\"Witness\" \u2013 3:40\n\n'''US 12\" Single'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=She Bop|others=[[Cyndi Lauper]]|date=1984|type=US 12-inch Single liner notes|publisher=[[Portrait Records]]|id=4R9 05011}}</ref>\n#\"She Bop\" (Special Dance Mix) \u2013 6:16\n#\"She Bop\" (Instrumental) \u2013 6:30\n\n'''UK 12\" Single'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=She Bop|others=[[Cyndi Lauper]]|date=1984|type=UK 12-inch Single liner notes|publisher=[[Portrait Records]]|id=TA 4620}}</ref>\n#\"She Bop\" (Special Dance Mix) \u2013 6:16\n#\"She Bop\" (Instrumental) \u2013 5:20 (stated)\n#\"Witness\" \u2013 3:40\n\n==Official Versions==\n#Album Version - 3:42\n#Single Version - 3:47 <small>(7\" Single)</small>\n#Special Dance Mix - 6:27 <small>(12\" Single)</small>\n#Instrumental - 5:21 <small>(12\" Single)</small>\n#Video Mix - 4:35 <small>(Philippines 7\" Single)</small> <ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-She-Bop/release/7306961</ref>\n#Live at Le Zenith <small>(Recorded 1987)</small> - 5:12 <small>(From ''[[Heading West (song)|Heading West]]'' UK Single - CD & 12\" Versions)</small>\n#Live at Irvine Meadows <small>(Recorded 1983)</small> - 5:20 <small>(From ''[[She's So Unusual]]'' 2000 CD Reissue)</small>\n#The Body Acoustic Version - 4:16 <small>(From ''[[The Body Acoustic]]'')</small>\n#Live <small>(True Colors Live 2008)</small> - 3:46 <small>(From ''True Colors Live 2008'' EP)</small><ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-True-Colors-Live-2008/release/7286262</ref>\n#Live at the Warehouse, Memphis - 4:04 <small>(From ''[[To Memphis, with Love]]'')</small>\n#Live <small>(Front and Center Presents)</small> - 3:59 <small>(From ''Front and Center Presents Cyndi Lauper'') (2014)</small><ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-Front-And-Center/release/7351985</ref>\n\n==Cover versions==\n* Hong Kong singer [[Aaron Kwok]] recorded a Cantonese and a Mandarin version of the song, both called \u7d55\u5c0d\u7f8e\u9e97.\n* [[Greece|Greek]] band [[Matisse (band)|Matisse]] covered the song for their 2007 album, ''[[Toys Up]]''.\n* In July 2008, [[J-pop]] singer [[Nana Kitade]] covered \"She Bop\" for the album ''We Love Cyndi - Tribute to Cyndi Lauper''; another version of the cover was featured on her 2009 album ''[[Bondage (album)|Bondage]]''.\n* South Korean pop singer [[Wax (singer)|Wax]] has covered the song.

It reached number three on the U.S. ''[[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]'' chart in September 1984. Worldwide, the song is her most commercially successful single after \"[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]\" and \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\", and reached number 46 on the ''[[UK Singles Chart]]'' and number 6 on the ''[[ARIA Singles Chart]]''. \"She Bop\" was her third consecutive Top 5 on the ''Hot 100''. The song is also featured in the film ''[[Never Been Kissed]].''\n\n==Song information==\nThe song was considered controversial, as it dealt with the subject matter of female  [[masturbation]]. It was also included on the [[Parents Music Resource Center]]'s \"Filthy Fifteen\" list, due to its sexual lyrics;  this led to the creation of the [[Parental Advisory]] sticker.  (Other songs on the \"[[Parents Music Resource Center|Filthy Fifteen]]\" list included tracks by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and [[AC/DC]].) In an interview on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', Lauper stated that she recorded the vocals of the song while nude.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/archive/peoplearchive.php/Cyndi_Lauper/biography/|title=Cyndi Lauper Biography|work=Monsters and Critics|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829165412/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/archive/peoplearchive.php/Cyndi_Lauper/biography/|archivedate=August 29, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nLauper said she wanted little kids [[Double entendre|to think the song was about dancing, and to understand the real meaning as they got older]]. It could receive airplay as she never directly stated in the song what the meaning was.\n\nThe single has been released in over 32 variations across the world, the most common being a two-track 7\" [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] single (with varying covers) and a two-track 12\" vinyl single (also with varying covers).\n\nLauper recorded a slow ballad version of the song for her album ''[[The Body Acoustic]]''.\n\nLauper stated at a concert during her 2013 ''[[She's So Unusual]]'' anniversary tour that she recorded the song topless in a dark room, while tickling herself.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Kca1UkrkiQ|title=Cyndi Lauper Speaks In 2013 Concert}}</ref>\n\n==Chart performance==\n\"She Bop\" was released on July 2, 1984 and became a success.

(This was done in metaphor showing teenagers as fast-food-consuming zombies.) There are many [[double entendre]]s indicating the song's true meaning, including a magazine that Lauper is staring at titled \"[[Beefcake magazine|Beefcake]]\" and other sexual meanings such as the \"self-service\" sign and three gas pumps with the signs Good, Better and Nirvana in the cartoon part of the video, the vibrating motorcycle, the \"masterbingo\" part of the video with \"Uncle Siggy\" [[Sigmund Freud]] as host, and Lauper wearing blackout glasses with a white cane in several scenes of the video.  The video is highly suggestive that the term \"She Bop\" is referencing female masturbation. The video does not go as far as the lyrics, as the magazine referenced in the song (\"...in the pages of a ''[[Blueboy (magazine)|Blueboy]]'' magazine\") was a popular gay erotica magazine of the time, whereas the magazine Lauper holds represents the tamer \u2014 and somewhat closeted \u2014 erotica of an earlier era. Nor did the lyrical reference come out of the blue: Lauper has stated that finding a copy of ''Blueboy'' lying around in the recording studio provided the impetus for writing \"She Bop.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/03/cyndi-lauper-she-bop-_n_5083703.html|title=Cyndi Lauper\u2019s \u2018She Bop\u2019 Was Inspired By Gay Porn Magazine Blueboy |website=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=February 2, 2016 |accessdate=September 18, 2016}}</ref>\nThe music video was directed by Edd Griles.<ref>http://www.mvdbase.com/video.php?id=16169</ref> Mark Marek designed the characters in the animated sections of this music video, which were produced and directed by Jerry Lieberman, of NYC\u2019s Jerry Lieberman Productions. <ref>{{cite web|title=Toonzone Goes \"MAD\" Interviewing Kevin Shinick and Mark Marek|url=https://www.toonzone.net/toonzone-goes-mad-interviewing-kevin-shinick-and-mark-marek/|website=Toonzone.|accessdate=4 April 2018|date=6 September 2010}}</ref> and the cover of the US 12\" version.<ref>http://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-She-Bop/release/531814</ref> [[Wendi Richter]] and [[Lou Albano]] appear in the video, with Richter lip-synching the first few lines of the song.<ref>http://whatculture.com/wwe/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-wendi-richter?page=6</ref>\n\n==Formats and track listings==\n'''US/UK 7\" Single'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=She Bop|others=[[Cyndi Lauper]]|date=1984|type=US 7-inch Single liner notes|publisher=[[Portrait Records]]|id=37-04516}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=She Bop|others=[[Cyndi Lauper]]|date=1984|type=UK 7-inch Single liner notes|publisher=[[Portrait Records]]|id=A 4620}}</ref>\n#\"She Bop\" \u2013 3:47\n#\"Witness\" \u2013 3:40\n\n'''US 12\" Single'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=She Bop|others=[[Cyndi Lauper]]|date=1984|type=US 12-inch Single liner notes|publisher=[[Portrait Records]]|id=4R9 05011}}</ref>\n#\"She Bop\" (Special Dance Mix) \u2013 6:16\n#\"She Bop\" (Instrumental) \u2013 6:30\n\n'''UK 12\" Single'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=She Bop|others=[[Cyndi Lauper]]|date=1984|type=UK 12-inch Single liner notes|publisher=[[Portrait Records]]|id=TA 4620}}</ref>\n#\"She Bop\" (Special Dance Mix) \u2013 6:16\n#\"She Bop\" (Instrumental) \u2013 5:20 (stated)\n#\"Witness\" \u2013 3:40\n\n==Official Versions==\n#Album Version - 3:42\n#Single Version - 3:47 <small>(7\" Single)</small>\n#Special Dance Mix - 6:27 <small>(12\" Single)</small>\n#Instrumental - 5:21 <small>(12\" Single)</small>\n#Video Mix - 4:35 <small>(Philippines 7\" Single)</small> <ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-She-Bop/release/7306961</ref>\n#Live at Le Zenith <small>(Recorded 1987)</small> - 5:12 <small>(From ''[[Heading West (song)|Heading West]]'' UK Single - CD & 12\" Versions)</small>\n#Live at Irvine Meadows <small>(Recorded 1983)</small> - 5:20 <small>(From ''[[She's So Unusual]]'' 2000 CD Reissue)</small>\n#The Body Acoustic Version - 4:16 <small>(From ''[[The Body Acoustic]]'')</small>\n#Live <small>(True Colors Live 2008)</small> - 3:46 <small>(From ''True Colors Live 2008'' EP)</small><ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-True-Colors-Live-2008/release/7286262</ref>\n#Live at the Warehouse, Memphis - 4:04 <small>(From ''[[To Memphis, with Love]]'')</small>\n#Live <small>(Front and Center Presents)</small> - 3:59 <small>(From ''Front and Center Presents Cyndi Lauper'') (2014)</small><ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-Front-And-Center/release/7351985</ref>\n\n==Cover versions==\n* Hong Kong singer [[Aaron Kwok]] recorded a Cantonese and a Mandarin version of the song, both called \u7d55\u5c0d\u7f8e\u9e97.\n* [[Greece|Greek]] band [[Matisse (band)|Matisse]] covered the song for their 2007 album, ''[[Toys Up]]''.\n* In July 2008, [[J-pop]] singer [[Nana Kitade]] covered \"She Bop\" for the album ''We Love Cyndi - Tribute to Cyndi Lauper''; another version of the cover was featured on her 2009 album ''[[Bondage (album)|Bondage]]''.\n* South Korean pop singer [[Wax (singer)|Wax]] has covered the song.

[[File:Tanki X Area159.jpg|thumb|Capture the Flag on Tanki X map \"Area 159\".]]\n\n=== In-game Currency and Ranking System ===\nFor every tank destroyed or flag captured, players build up a number of XP (rank experience points) which they are rewarded, and container points. The number of experience gained is based on various factors including the number of opponents destroyed, killstreak and the amount of XP earned throughout the match. The amount of XP players gain has its own set of rewards. Players gain new ranks at particular XP milestones which publicly represent their level of skill, dedication, and time playing the game.\n\nPlayers can also buy X Crystals. X Crystals are a premium currency, which is bought with real world money, and unlocks special skins, graffiti, special shell colors for turret ammo, paints for tanks and containers for module blueprints. X crystals can also be earned by completing missions and entering certain promo codes.\n\n=== Ranked Battles ===\nThe ranked battle system is a ranking ladder which organizes players using RP (reputation points), which are rewarded or lost at the end of a completed battle. These points place players within a certain league, depending on how much RP they have. From lowest to highest, there are 5 leagues: Training, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Masters.

It was created on the Unity engine by [[AlternativaPlatform]], a Russia-based game developing company. The game uses the [[free-to-play]] business model, where players can download and play the game for free. However, players can also pay real world money in the form of [[Micro-transactions|micro transactions]] to get \"X Crystals\".

[[File:Tanki X Area159.jpg|thumb|Capture the Flag on Tanki X map \"Area 159\".]]\n\n=== In-game Currency and Ranking System ===\nFor every tank destroyed or flag captured, players build up a number of XP (rank experience points) which they are rewarded, and container points. The number of experience gained is based on various factors including the number of opponents destroyed, killstreak and the amount of XP earned throughout the match. The amount of XP players gain has its own set of rewards. Players gain new ranks at particular XP milestones which publicly represent their level of skill, dedication, and time playing the game.\n\nPlayers can also buy X Crystals. X Crystals are a premium currency, which is bought with real world money, and unlocks special skins, graffiti, special shell colors for turret ammo, paints for tanks and containers for module blueprints. X crystals can also be earned by completing missions and entering certain promo codes.\n\n=== Ranked Battles ===\nThe ranked battle system is a ranking ladder which organizes players using RP (reputation points), which are rewarded or lost at the end of a completed battle. These points place players within a certain league, depending on how much RP they have. From lowest to highest, there are 5 leagues: Training, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Masters. Upon entering a league for the first time, the game will grant players with the paint and 5 containers for the corresponding league. Every 2 months, the league system enters a new season. At that time, the game will award players with crystals, x crystals, and league containers for the league they ended the season in.

The 1928 Blue's were led by [[Jack Ellison]]. He was named to the All Star team and the [[Pinconning MI]] native had a 15\u20138 record.  [[Spud Owen]] averaged .343 and was also named to the All Star team.  In 1929 the [[Norton Jayhawks]] took over the franchise.\n\nWhen the [[York Dukes]] dropped out of the [[Nebraska State League]] after the 1931 season Beatrice reentered the league and remained through the 1938 season. The 1932 Blues were led by [[Mike Pociask]] and [[Cotton Pippen]]. During the playoffs, Cotton pitched the third game of the series and won 5\u20133. He came back in the sixth game of the series and pitched a 2-hitter as Beatrice won 9\u20130. The next day he pitched the seventh game of the series.  There were 3,000 fans in the Beatrice stands. Cotton went 2 for 3 at the plate and won 4\u20133. He did not give up an earned run in four playoff appearances. 1933 was a near repeat of the previous year. Led by pitcher [[Mike Pociask]] they once again wound up in second place. Cotton won one of the playoff games and hit two home runs during the game.  Beatrice won the playoffs 5 games to 4. 1934 and 1935 were cellar years for the team. In 1936 the team secured a working agreement with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].

Inspired by this, Epic created a variation of ''Fortnite'' and released it as ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' in September 2017. While [[free-to-play]], the game was supported by [[microtransaction]]s. ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' rapidly became popular, and by June 2018, with the game ported to computer, consoles, and mobile devices, had reached 125 million players.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17456814/fortnite-battle-royale-epic-games-125-million-players-first-year-e3-2018 | title = Fortnite now has 125 million players just one year after launch | first = Nick | last = Statt | date = June 12, 2018 | accessdate = June 12, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180613155733/https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17456814/fortnite-battle-royale-epic-games-125-million-players-first-year-e3-2018 | archivedate = June 13, 2018 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Total 2018 revenue for ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' was estimated at {{USD|2.4 billion|long=no}} by analysis firm SuperData Research.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-01-16-fortnite-tops-2018-superdata-chart-with-usd2-4b-digital-revenue | title = Fortnite tops SuperData's 2018 chart with $2.4 billion digital revenue | first=  Matthew | last =Handrahan | date = January 16, 2019 | accessdate = January 16, 2019 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref> Epic designated {{USD|100 million}} of these revenues to position ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' as an esport.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/epic-makes-fornite-biggest-esport-with-100-million-in-prize-money.html | title = Epic makes \u2018Fortnite\u2019 biggest esport in the world with $100 million in prize money. | first = Tae | last = Kim | date = May 21, 2018 | accessdate = July 15, 2018 | website = [[CNBC]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180715210712/https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/epic-makes-fornite-biggest-esport-with-100-million-in-prize-money.html | archive-date = July 15, 2018 | url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nThe inaugural Fortnite World Cup was first announced in February 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235132/fortnite-world-cup-final-date-prize-money-new-york-esports | title = Fortnite\u2019s $30 million World Cup final is happening in July | first = Andrew | last = Webster | date = February 22, 2019 | accessdate = February 22, 2019 | work = [[The Verge]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190223102447/https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235132/fortnite-world-cup-final-date-prize-money-new-york-esports | archive-date = February 23, 2019 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Vincent |first1=Brittany |title=The next World Cup?

The cup included three different creative game maps: a king of the hill map, a prop hunt map, and a death run map. Each map had one round with three matches dedicated to it, and the final round had one match on each map. In the end, the \u201cFish Fam\u201d led by Faze Cizzorz won the creative World Cup.\n\nCreative Cup final standings:\n<ref name=\"fortnite\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!

A total {{USD|30 million}} prize pool was available across the various competitions.\n\n==Overview==\nThe Fortnite World Cup uses two of the game modes available to the video game, ''Fortnite''. The main World Cup event as well as the Pro-Am use ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', a [[battle royale game]] where up to 100 players airdrop onto an island without any weapons or armor, save for a pickaxe. Once on the ground, players must scavenge for weapons, armor, and healing items, as well as using their pickaxe to knock down existing features to gather wood, stone, and metal resources. This all must be done while avoiding attacks from other players, as well as staying within a shrinking circle on the map or risk taking fatal damage outside it. Players can use gathered resources to build walls, floors, and stairs and ramps to use as cover from attacks. The last player or team left alive wins. In ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'', players can build unique courses at their own pace, which can be used to create competitive events that can then share with others.\n\nThe Fortnite World Cup had online events over 10 weeks from April to June 2019 for people to place. The weeks alternated between solo players and duos teams. During the Saturday of each week, any player or duo could compete with others by geographic region, playing up to 10 matches to earn points through eliminations and victories. The top three thousand players/teams from each region then competed on the Sunday event, again playing up to ten matches to earn points. The top point-scorers in each region from the Sunday event then proceed through to the World Cup, a total of about twenty players/teams each week.<ref name=\"epicgames.com\">[https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/events/world-cup/about]</ref> An estimated 40 million players vied for spots in the solo and duos World Cup.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/fortnite-world-cup-winner-bugha.html | title = This Fortnite World Cup Winner Is 16 and $3 Million Richer | first1 = Derrick Bryson | last1= Taylor | first2=Niraj | last2= Chokshi | date = July 29, 2019 | accessdate = July 29, 2019 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref> In the World Cup finals, the competitors played a total of six matches, with points earned for the highest finishers.

Similarly, each duo team in the final received a minimum of {{USD|100,000}} with the top team winning {{USD|3 million}}.<ref name=\"variety viewership\"/>\n\nThe Fortnite Creative Cup had a similar online process to select the players for the finals, taking place over five two-week periods from April to June 2019. Each active week, a new Creative challenge is available. Players, once completed with their Creative island, must submit a video of that challenge to Epic in that period. For each period, Epic selected three of the best entries by a panel of judges. Each selected entry earns a cash prize of {{USD|5,000}} and a guaranteed spot in the Creative Cup finals. From the fifteen winning entries, five were selected by Epic to be used in the Creative Cup finales.<ref>[https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-world-cup-creative-competitions-official-rules]</ref> In the finales, eight teams of four, consisting of those that had their Creative island selected and other notable ''Fortnite'' players, complete in these five events to earn the best overall score. The winners in the finale split a {{USD|3 million}} prize pool.<ref name=\"epicgames.com\"/>\n\nThe teams for the Fortnite Pro-Am are selected by Epic Games, with each team made up of a ''Fortnite'' streamer and a celebrity. The teams each played five matches, with a scoring system for the winning teams. The team with the highest overall score after five matches won the Pro-Am. Each team received a minimum of {{USD|20,000}} with the winning team receiving {{USD|1 million}}.\n\n==History==\n[[Epic Games]] had launched ''Fortnite'' in its original planned form, now known as ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'', as an [[early access]] title in July 2017, around the same time that the first influential [[battle royale game]], ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]''(PUBG) was released. Inspired by this, Epic created a variation of ''Fortnite'' and released it as ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' in September 2017. While [[free-to-play]], the game was supported by [[microtransaction]]s. ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' rapidly became popular, and by June 2018, with the game ported to computer, consoles, and mobile devices, had reached 125 million players.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17456814/fortnite-battle-royale-epic-games-125-million-players-first-year-e3-2018 | title = Fortnite now has 125 million players just one year after launch | first = Nick | last = Statt | date = June 12, 2018 | accessdate = June 12, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180613155733/https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17456814/fortnite-battle-royale-epic-games-125-million-players-first-year-e3-2018 | archivedate = June 13, 2018 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Total 2018 revenue for ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' was estimated at {{USD|2.4 billion|long=no}} by analysis firm SuperData Research.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-01-16-fortnite-tops-2018-superdata-chart-with-usd2-4b-digital-revenue | title = Fortnite tops SuperData's 2018 chart with $2.4 billion digital revenue | first=  Matthew | last =Handrahan | date = January 16, 2019 | accessdate = January 16, 2019 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref> Epic designated {{USD|100 million}} of these revenues to position ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' as an esport.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/epic-makes-fornite-biggest-esport-with-100-million-in-prize-money.html | title = Epic makes \u2018Fortnite\u2019 biggest esport in the world with $100 million in prize money. | first = Tae | last = Kim | date = May 21, 2018 | accessdate = July 15, 2018 | website = [[CNBC]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180715210712/https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/epic-makes-fornite-biggest-esport-with-100-million-in-prize-money.html | archive-date = July 15, 2018 | url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nThe inaugural Fortnite World Cup was first announced in February 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235132/fortnite-world-cup-final-date-prize-money-new-york-esports | title = Fortnite\u2019s $30 million World Cup final is happening in July | first = Andrew | last = Webster | date = February 22, 2019 | accessdate = February 22, 2019 | work = [[The Verge]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190223102447/https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235132/fortnite-world-cup-final-date-prize-money-new-york-esports | archive-date = February 23, 2019 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Vincent |first1=Brittany |title=The next World Cup?
