It can describe a mixed ethnic community area where multiple cultural traditions exist (such as [[New York City]]) or a single country within which they do (such as Switzerland, Belgium or Russia). Groups associated with an indigenous or [[wikt:autochthonous|autochthonous]] ethnic group and foreigner ethnic groups are often the focus.\n\nIn reference to sociology, multiculturalism is the end-state of either a natural or artificial process (for example: legally-controlled [[immigration]]) and occurs on either a large national scale or on a smaller scale within a nation's communities. On a smaller scale this can occur artificially when a jurisdiction is established or expanded by amalgamating areas with two or more different cultures (e.g. [[French Canada]] and [[English Canada]]). On a large scale, it can occur as a result of either legal or illegal [[human migration|migration]] to and from different jurisdictions around the world (for example, [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] by Angles, Saxons and Jutes in the 5th century or the colonization of the Americas by Europeans, Africans and Asians since the 16th century). \n\nIn reference to political science, Multiculturalism can be defined as a states capacity to effectively and efficiently deal with cultural plurality within its sovereign borders.

It is often associated with \"identity politics\", \"the politics of difference\", and \"the politics of recognition\". It is also a matter of economic interests and [[Power (social and political)|political power]].<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiculturalism/ Multiculturalism] \u2013 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> In more recent times political multiculturalist ideologies have been expanding in their use to include and define disadvantaged groups such as [[African American]]s, [[LGBT]], with arguments often focusing on ethnic and religious minorities, minority nations, [[indigenous peoples]] and even the disabled. It is within this context in which the term is most commonly understood and the broadness and scope of the definition, as well as its practical use, has been the subject of serious debate.\n\nMost debates over multiculturalism center around whether or not multiculturalism is the appropriate way to deal with diversity and immigrant integration. The arguments regarding the perceived rights to a multicultural education include the proposition that it acts as a way to demand recognition of aspects of a group's culture subordination and its entire experience in contrast to a [[melting pot]] or non-multicultural societies.\n\nThe term multiculturalism is most often used in reference to Western [[nation-state]]s, which had seemingly achieved a de facto single national identity during the 18th and/or 19th centuries.<ref name=\"ZarateLevy2011\">{{cite book|author1=Genevi\u00e8ve Zarate|author2=Danielle Levy|author3=Claire Kramsch|title=Handbook of Multilingualism and Multiculturalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYL4_6SvxewC&pg=PA377|date=19 April 2011|publisher=Archives contemporaines|isbn=978-2-8130-0039-2|page=377}}</ref>\nMulticulturalism has been official policy in several [[Western world|Western nations]] since the 1970s, for reasons that varied from country to country,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/most/pp4.htm |title=Policy Paper no. 4 \u2013 Multiculturalism: New Policy Responses to Diversity |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ai-ia/rir-iro/gbll/divers/index-eng.cfm |title=Multiculturalism in Canada |publisher=Pch.gc.ca |date=9 April 2009 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www4.gu.edu.au/ext/civics/cv02/mod03/cv02m03t02.htm |title=Immigration and Multiculturalism |publisher=.gu.edu.au |accessdate=2010-12-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219034150/http://www4.gu.edu.au/ext/civics/cv02/mod03/cv02m03t02.htm |archivedate=19 February 2011 }}</ref> including the fact that many of the great cities of the Western world are increasingly made of a mosaic of cultures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unu.edu/dialogue/papers/claval-s2.pdf |title=Multiculturalism and the Dynamics of Modern Civilizations |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Canadian government]] has often been described as the instigator of multicultural ideology because of its public emphasis on the [[Economic impact of immigration to Canada|social importance of immigration]].<ref>{{cite news|doi=10.1163/15718119720907408|title=Immigration, Multiculturalism and National Identity in Canada|journal= International Journal of Group Rights|first=Shara|last=Wayland|year=1997|volume=5|issue=1|pages= 33\u201358}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/ujjal-dosanjh-by-silencing-white-men-canada-cant-have-an-honest-debate-about-equality-race-and-culture|title=Ujjal Dosanjh: By silencing white men, Canada can't have an honest debate about equality, race and culture|last=|first=|date=4 January 2016|work=|newspaper=National Post|access-date=2017-01-16|via=}}</ref> The Canadian [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] is often referred to as the origins of modern political awareness of multiculturalism.<ref name=\"II2010.\">{{cite book|author=Ronald L.

The report found that while the second generation non-Western immigrants do better than the first generation, the third generation of immigrants with non-Western background do no better education and employment wise than the second generation. One of the reasons was that second generation immigrants from non-Western countries marry someone from their country of origin and so Danish is not spoken at home which disadvantages children in school.

In May 1975, a unanimous Swedish parliament passed an act on a new multiculturalist immigrant and ethnic minority policy put forward by the [[social democracy|social democratic]] government, that explicitly rejected the ideal ethnic homogeneity and the policy of assimilation. The three main principles of the new policy were equality, partnership and freedom of choice. The explicit policy aim of the freedom of choice principle was to create the opportunity for minority groups in Sweden to retain their own languages and cultures. From the mid-1970s, the goal of enabling the preservation of minorities and creating a positive attitude towards the new officially endorsed multicultural society among the majority population became incorporated into the Swedish constitution as well as cultural, educational and media policies.

In [[sociology]] and in everyday usage, it is a synonym for \"[[Pluralism (political theory)|ethnic pluralism]]\", with the two terms often used interchangeably, for example, a [[cultural pluralism]]<ref>{{Citation|last=Staff|chapter=Pluralism, Cultural|date=2008-07-15|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-0470373699|doi=10.1002/9780470373699.speced1627|title=Encyclopedia of Special Education}}</ref> in which various ethnic groups collaborate and enter into a dialogue with one another without having to sacrifice their particular identities. It can describe a mixed ethnic community area where multiple cultural traditions exist (such as [[New York City]]) or a single country within which they do (such as Switzerland, Belgium or Russia). Groups associated with an indigenous or [[wikt:autochthonous|autochthonous]] ethnic group and foreigner ethnic groups are often the focus.\n\nIn reference to sociology, multiculturalism is the end-state of either a natural or artificial process (for example: legally-controlled [[immigration]]) and occurs on either a large national scale or on a smaller scale within a nation's communities. On a smaller scale this can occur artificially when a jurisdiction is established or expanded by amalgamating areas with two or more different cultures (e.g. [[French Canada]] and [[English Canada]]). On a large scale, it can occur as a result of either legal or illegal [[human migration|migration]] to and from different jurisdictions around the world (for example, [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] by Angles, Saxons and Jutes in the 5th century or the colonization of the Americas by Europeans, Africans and Asians since the 16th century). \n\nIn reference to political science, Multiculturalism can be defined as a states capacity to effectively and efficiently deal with cultural plurality within its sovereign borders.

It is often associated with \"identity politics\", \"the politics of difference\", and \"the politics of recognition\". It is also a matter of economic interests and [[Power (social and political)|political power]].<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiculturalism/ Multiculturalism] \u2013 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> In more recent times political multiculturalist ideologies have been expanding in their use to include and define disadvantaged groups such as [[African American]]s, [[LGBT]], with arguments often focusing on ethnic and religious minorities, minority nations, [[indigenous peoples]] and even the disabled. It is within this context in which the term is most commonly understood and the broadness and scope of the definition, as well as its practical use, has been the subject of serious debate.\n\nMost debates over multiculturalism center around whether or not multiculturalism is the appropriate way to deal with diversity and immigrant integration. The arguments regarding the perceived rights to a multicultural education include the proposition that it acts as a way to demand recognition of aspects of a group's culture subordination and its entire experience in contrast to a [[melting pot]] or non-multicultural societies.\n\nThe term multiculturalism is most often used in reference to Western [[nation-state]]s, which had seemingly achieved a de facto single national identity during the 18th and/or 19th centuries.<ref name=\"ZarateLevy2011\">{{cite book|author1=Genevi\u00e8ve Zarate|author2=Danielle Levy|author3=Claire Kramsch|title=Handbook of Multilingualism and Multiculturalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYL4_6SvxewC&pg=PA377|date=19 April 2011|publisher=Archives contemporaines|isbn=978-2-8130-0039-2|page=377}}</ref>\nMulticulturalism has been official policy in several [[Western world|Western nations]] since the 1970s, for reasons that varied from country to country,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/most/pp4.htm |title=Policy Paper no. 4 \u2013 Multiculturalism: New Policy Responses to Diversity |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ai-ia/rir-iro/gbll/divers/index-eng.cfm |title=Multiculturalism in Canada |publisher=Pch.gc.ca |date=9 April 2009 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www4.gu.edu.au/ext/civics/cv02/mod03/cv02m03t02.htm |title=Immigration and Multiculturalism |publisher=.gu.edu.au |accessdate=2010-12-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219034150/http://www4.gu.edu.au/ext/civics/cv02/mod03/cv02m03t02.htm |archivedate=19 February 2011 }}</ref> including the fact that many of the great cities of the Western world are increasingly made of a mosaic of cultures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unu.edu/dialogue/papers/claval-s2.pdf |title=Multiculturalism and the Dynamics of Modern Civilizations |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Canadian government]] has often been described as the instigator of multicultural ideology because of its public emphasis on the [[Economic impact of immigration to Canada|social importance of immigration]].<ref>{{cite news|doi=10.1163/15718119720907408|title=Immigration, Multiculturalism and National Identity in Canada|journal= International Journal of Group Rights|first=Shara|last=Wayland|year=1997|volume=5|issue=1|pages= 33\u201358}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/ujjal-dosanjh-by-silencing-white-men-canada-cant-have-an-honest-debate-about-equality-race-and-culture|title=Ujjal Dosanjh: By silencing white men, Canada can't have an honest debate about equality, race and culture|last=|first=|date=4 January 2016|work=|newspaper=National Post|access-date=2017-01-16|via=}}</ref> The Canadian [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] is often referred to as the origins of modern political awareness of multiculturalism.<ref name=\"II2010.\">{{cite book|author=Ronald L.

In May 1975, a unanimous Swedish parliament passed an act on a new multiculturalist immigrant and ethnic minority policy put forward by the [[social democracy|social democratic]] government, that explicitly rejected the ideal ethnic homogeneity and the policy of assimilation. The three main principles of the new policy were equality, partnership and freedom of choice. The explicit policy aim of the freedom of choice principle was to create the opportunity for minority groups in Sweden to retain their own languages and cultures. From the mid-1970s, the goal of enabling the preservation of minorities and creating a positive attitude towards the new officially endorsed multicultural society among the majority population became incorporated into the Swedish constitution as well as cultural, educational and media policies. Despite the anti-multiculturalist protestations of the [[Sweden Democrats]], multiculturalism remains official policy in Sweden.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The multicultural moment: the history of the idea and politics of multiculturalism in Sweden in comparative, transnational and biographical context, 1964\u20131975|last=Wickstr\u00f6m|first=Mats|publisher=\u00c5bo Akademi|year=2015|isbn=978-952-12-3133-9|url=http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fe201501071068|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nA 2008 study which involved questionnaires sent to 5,000 people, showed that less than a quarter of the respondents (23%) wanted to live in areas characterised by cultural, ethnic and social diversity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.svd.se/svenskar-vill-ha-inhagnat-boende|title=Svenskar vill ha inh\u00e4gnat boende {{!}} SvD|last=TT|first=|date=|work=SvD.se|access-date=2018-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322170850/http://www.svd.se/svenskar-vill-ha-inhagnat-boende|archive-date=22 March 2016|language=sv}}</ref>\n\nA 2014 study published by [[G\u00e4vle University College]] showed that 38% of the population never interacted with anyone from Africa and 20% never interacted with any non-Europeans.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.hig.se/download/18.4db66897149b264e1ba4df24/1417115797086/mangfald.pdf|title=M\u00e5ngfaldsbarometern 2014|last=|first=|publisher=G\u00e4vle University College|year=October 2014|isbn=|location=|pages=7\u20138|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621094211/https://www.hig.se/download/18.4db66897149b264e1ba4df24/1417115797086/mangfald.pdf|archive-date=21 June 2016}}</ref> The study concluded that while physical distance to the country of origin, also religion and other cultural expressions are significant for the perception of cultural familiarity.

The violence targeting Chinese Indonesians erupted during [[Fall of Suharto#Riots of 13\u201314 May|riots in 1998.]] As the looting and destruction took place, a number of Chinese Indonesians, as well as looters, were killed. The Chinese Indonesians were treated as the scapegoat of [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]], a result of ongoing discrimination and segregation policies enforced during Suharto's New Order regime.

More Malays however have moved into the cities since the 1970s, and the proportion of the non-Malays have been decreasing continually, especially the Chinese, due in large part to lower birth-rate and emigration as a result of [[institutionalized discrimination]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1804:honey-i-shrunk-the-chinese-&catid=198:helen-ang&Itemid=156 |title=Honey, I shrunk the Chinese! |publisher=CPI |date=9 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525132129/http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1804:honey-i-shrunk-the-chinese-&catid=198:helen-ang&Itemid=156 |archivedate=25 May 2012 }}</ref>\n\nPreceding independence of the [[Federation of Malaya]], a [[social contract (Malaysia)|social contract]] was negotiated as the basis of a new society.

[...] Having a two percent foreign population unquestionably causes ripples, but having one million temporary foreign residents does not make Korea a multicultural society. [...] In many ways, this homogeneity is one of Korea\u2019s greatest strengths. Shared values create harmony. Sacrifice for the nation is a given. Difficult and painful political and economic initiatives are endured without discussion or debate. It is easy to anticipate the needs and behavior of others. It is the cornerstone that has helped Korea survive adversity. But there is a downside, too. [...] Koreans are immersed in their culture and are thus blind to its characteristics and quirks. Examples of group think are everywhere. Because Koreans share values and views, they support decisions even when they are obviously bad.

Molotov served as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Premier) from 1930 to 1941, and as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1939 to 1949 and from 1953 to 1956. He served as [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] from 1942 to 1957, when he was dismissed from the Presidium of the Central Committee by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Molotov was removed from all positions in 1961 after several years of obscurity.\n\nMolotov was the principal Soviet signatory of the [[Nazi Germany|German]]\u2013Soviet [[non-aggression pact]] of 1939 (also known as the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]), whose most important provisions were added in the form of a secret protocol that stipulated an invasion of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and partition of its territory between [[Nazi Germany]] and the Soviet Union. \n\nAfter World War II (the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]), Molotov was involved in negotiations with the Western allies, in which he became noted for his diplomatic skills. He retained his place as a leading Soviet diplomat and politician until March 1949, when he fell out of Stalin's favour and lost the foreign affairs ministry leadership to [[Andrei Vyshinsky]]. Molotov's relationship with Stalin deteriorated further, with Stalin criticising Molotov in a speech to the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Congress]]. However, after Stalin's death in 1953, Molotov was staunchly opposed to Khrushchev's [[de-Stalinisation]] policy. Molotov defended Stalin's policies and legacy until his death in 1986, and harshly criticised Stalin's successors, especially Khrushchev.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and career (1890\u20131930)===\n[[Image:Molotov house Kukarka.JPG|thumb|200px|Molotov's birth house in [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast]].|left]]\n\nMolotov was born Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Skryabin in the village of [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast|Kukarka]], [[Yaransk]] [[Uyezd]], [[Vyatka Governorate]] (now Sovetsk in [[Kirov Oblast]]), the son of a butter churner.

Molotov had made it clear that improved relations with Hitler's Germany could only develop if Germany's policy changed. Molotov then stated that one of the best ways for Germany to improve relations was by re-joining the [[League of Nations]], but even that was not sufficient. Germany still had to give proof 'of its respect for international obligations in keeping with the real interests of peace in Europe and peace generally'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Molotov and the Sovnarkom 1930\u20131941|last=Watson|first=Derek|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=161}}</ref> As Litvinov during 1933 and 1934 had done his best to prevent the cordial relations created by Rapallo from declining, some do not think Litvinov would have disapproved of that statement; and if German policy had changed, Litvinov would have been delighted. However, Robert Conquest, unlike Watson, believed that the reason for Stalin's temporary rift with Molotov was not concerned with foreign policy but stemmed from the fact that Stalin was incensed with Molotov for attempting to try and dissuade Stalin from staging the famous trials against the old colleagues of Lenin.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Great Terror|last=Conquest|first=Robert|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=91}}</ref> Molotov, in the same interview, denied the continued existence of internal enemies except for a few isolated cases.

Molotov's detestation for Litvinov was purely of a personal nature.  No Moscovite I have ever known, whether a friend of Molotov or of Litvinov, has ever taken exception to this view.  Molotov was always resentful of Litvinov's fluency in French, German and English, as he was distrustful of Litvinov's easy manner with foreigners.  Never having lived abroad, Molotov always suspected that there was something impure and sinful in Litvinov's broad mindedness and appreciation of Western civilisation.<ref>Hindus Maurice Crisis in the Kremlin</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough Litvinov never mentioned his relationship with Molotov in the foreign commissariat, Narkomindel press officer Genedin states: even though Litvinov never referred to their relationship (between Litvinov and Molotov) it was nevertheless well known it was bad.

In January 1941, the British Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] visited Turkey in an attempt to get the Turks to enter the war on the Allies' side. Though the purpose of Eden's visit was anti-German rather than anti-Soviet, Molotov assumed otherwise, and in a series of conversations with the Italian Ambassador Augusto Rosso, Molotov claimed that the Soviet Union would soon be faced with an Anglo\u2013Turkish invasion of the [[Crimea]]. The British historian D.C. Watt argued that, on the basis of Molotov's statements to Rosso, it would appear that, in early 1941, Stalin and Molotov viewed Britain rather than Germany as the principal threat.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Cameron Watt, Donald | title = Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy | publisher = [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-415-14435-3 | pages = 276\u2013286 }}</ref>\n[[File:Molotov with Ribbentrop.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Molotov meets with [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] before signing the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|German\u2013Soviet non-aggression pact]]]] \nThe Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact governed Soviet\u2013German relations until June 1941 when Hitler, having occupied France and neutralised Britain, turned east and [[German invasion of the Soviet Union|attacked the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Service|2003|pp=158\u2013160}} Molotov was responsible for telling the [[Soviet people]] of the attack, when he instead of Stalin announced the war.

In general, he was distinguished by an uncooperative attitude towards the Western powers. Molotov, at the direction of the Soviet government, condemned the [[Marshall Plan]] as imperialistic and claimed it was dividing Europe into two camps, one capitalist and the other communist. In response, the Soviet Union, along with the other [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, initiated what is known as the [[Molotov Plan]].

Molotov served as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Premier) from 1930 to 1941, and as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1939 to 1949 and from 1953 to 1956. He served as [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] from 1942 to 1957, when he was dismissed from the Presidium of the Central Committee by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Molotov was removed from all positions in 1961 after several years of obscurity.\n\nMolotov was the principal Soviet signatory of the [[Nazi Germany|German]]\u2013Soviet [[non-aggression pact]] of 1939 (also known as the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]), whose most important provisions were added in the form of a secret protocol that stipulated an invasion of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and partition of its territory between [[Nazi Germany]] and the Soviet Union. \n\nAfter World War II (the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]), Molotov was involved in negotiations with the Western allies, in which he became noted for his diplomatic skills. He retained his place as a leading Soviet diplomat and politician until March 1949, when he fell out of Stalin's favour and lost the foreign affairs ministry leadership to [[Andrei Vyshinsky]]. Molotov's relationship with Stalin deteriorated further, with Stalin criticising Molotov in a speech to the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Congress]]. However, after Stalin's death in 1953, Molotov was staunchly opposed to Khrushchev's [[de-Stalinisation]] policy. Molotov defended Stalin's policies and legacy until his death in 1986, and harshly criticised Stalin's successors, especially Khrushchev.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and career (1890\u20131930)===\n[[Image:Molotov house Kukarka.JPG|thumb|200px|Molotov's birth house in [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast]].|left]]\n\nMolotov was born Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Skryabin in the village of [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast|Kukarka]], [[Yaransk]] [[Uyezd]], [[Vyatka Governorate]] (now Sovetsk in [[Kirov Oblast]]), the son of a butter churner. Contrary to a commonly repeated error, he was not related to the composer [[Alexander Scriabin]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=40}} Throughout his teen years, he was described as \"shy\" and \"quiet\", always assisting his father with his business. He was educated at a secondary school in [[Kazan]], and joined the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP) in 1906, soon gravitating toward that organisation's radical [[Bolshevik]] faction, headed by [[V. I. Lenin]].<ref name=Roberts5>[[Geoffrey Roberts]], ''Molotov: Stalin's Cold Warrior.''

In 1911, he enrolled at [[St Petersburg]] Polytechnic. Molotov joined the editorial staff of a new underground Bolshevik newspaper called ''[[Pravda]]'', meeting [[Joseph Stalin]] for the first time in association with the project.<ref name=Roberts6>Roberts, ''Molotov'', pg. 6.</ref> This first association between the two future Soviet leaders proved to be brief, however, and did not lead to an immediate close political association.<ref name=Roberts6 />\n\n[[File:Molotov VM.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Molotov in 1917]]\n\nMolotov worked as a so-called \"professional revolutionary\" for the next several years, writing for the party press and attempting to better organize the underground party.<ref name=Roberts6 /> He moved from St. Petersburg to Moscow in 1914 at the time of the outbreak of [[World War I]].<ref name=Roberts6 /> It was in Moscow the following year that Molotov was again arrested for his party activity, this time being deported to [[Irkutsk]] in eastern [[Siberia]].<ref name=Roberts6 /> In 1916, he escaped from his Siberian exile and returned to the capital city, now called Petrograd by the Tsarist regime, which thought the name St. Petersburg sounded excessively German.<ref name=Roberts6 />\n\nMolotov became a member of the Bolshevik Party's committee in [[Petrograd]] in 1916. When the [[February Revolution]] occurred in 1917, he was one of the few Bolsheviks of any standing in the capital.

Since he was not a military man, he took no part in the fighting. In 1920, he became secretary to the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Bolshevik Party. Lenin recalled him to Moscow in 1921, elevating him to full membership of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and [[Orgburo]], and putting him in charge of the party secretariat. He was voted in as a non-voting member of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] in 1921 and held the office of [[Responsible Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Responsible Secretary]] and also married the Soviet politician [[Polina Zhemchuzhina]].\n\nHis Responsible Secretaryship was criticised by Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]], with Lenin noting his \"shameful bureaucratism\" and stupid behaviour.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=40}} On the advice of Molotov and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], the Central Committee decided to reduce Lenin's work hours.{{sfn|Service|2003|p=151}} In 1922, Stalin became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Bolshevik Party]] with Molotov as the ''de facto'' [[Second Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Second Secretary]].

Molotov had made it clear that improved relations with Hitler's Germany could only develop if Germany's policy changed. Molotov then stated that one of the best ways for Germany to improve relations was by re-joining the [[League of Nations]], but even that was not sufficient. Germany still had to give proof 'of its respect for international obligations in keeping with the real interests of peace in Europe and peace generally'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Molotov and the Sovnarkom 1930\u20131941|last=Watson|first=Derek|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=161}}</ref> As Litvinov during 1933 and 1934 had done his best to prevent the cordial relations created by Rapallo from declining, some do not think Litvinov would have disapproved of that statement; and if German policy had changed, Litvinov would have been delighted. However, Robert Conquest, unlike Watson, believed that the reason for Stalin's temporary rift with Molotov was not concerned with foreign policy but stemmed from the fact that Stalin was incensed with Molotov for attempting to try and dissuade Stalin from staging the famous trials against the old colleagues of Lenin.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Great Terror|last=Conquest|first=Robert|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=91}}</ref> Molotov, in the same interview, denied the continued existence of internal enemies except for a few isolated cases.

In his book ''Crisis in the Kremlin'', he states:\n\n<blockquote>It is well known in Moscow that Molotov always detested Litvinov.  Molotov's detestation for Litvinov was purely of a personal nature.  No Moscovite I have ever known, whether a friend of Molotov or of Litvinov, has ever taken exception to this view.  Molotov was always resentful of Litvinov's fluency in French, German and English, as he was distrustful of Litvinov's easy manner with foreigners.  Never having lived abroad, Molotov always suspected that there was something impure and sinful in Litvinov's broad mindedness and appreciation of Western civilisation.<ref>Hindus Maurice Crisis in the Kremlin</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough Litvinov never mentioned his relationship with Molotov in the foreign commissariat, Narkomindel press officer Genedin states: even though Litvinov never referred to their relationship (between Litvinov and Molotov) it was nevertheless well known it was bad.  Litvinov had no respect for a small minded intriguer and accomplice in terror like Molotov, and Molotov for his part had no love for Litvinov, who incidentally was the one people's commissioner to retain his independence.<ref>Medvedev All Stalin's Men p.488</ref>\n\n[[File:Great Purge Stalin Voroshilov Kaganovich Zhdanov Molotov.jpg|thumb|A list from the [[Great Purge]] signed by Molotov, Stalin, [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich|Kaganovich]] and [[Andrei Zhdanov|Zhdanov]]|293x293px]]\n\nMolotov was succeeded in his post as Premier by Stalin.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=141}}\n\nAt first, Hitler rebuffed Soviet diplomatic hints that Stalin desired a treaty; but in early August 1939, Hitler authorised Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] to begin serious negotiations. A trade agreement was concluded on 18 August; and on 22 August, Ribbentrop flew to Moscow to conclude a formal non-aggression treaty. Although the treaty is known as the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], it was Stalin and Hitler, and not Molotov and Ribbentrop, who decided the content of the treaty.\n\nThe most important part of the agreement was the secret protocol, which provided for the partition of [[Poland]], [[Finland]], and the [[Baltic States]] between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and for the Soviet annexation of [[Bessarabia]] (then part of [[Romania]], now [[Moldova]]).{{sfn|Service|2003|p=256}} This protocol gave Hitler the green light for his [[German invasion of Poland|invasion of Poland]], which began on 1 September.{{sfn|Brown|2009|pp=90\u201392}} On 5 March 1940, [[Lavrentiy Beria]] gave Molotov, along with [[Anastas Mikoyan]], [[Kliment Voroshilov]] and Stalin, a note proposing the execution of 25,700 Polish officers and [[anti-Soviet]]s, in what has become known as the [[Katyn massacre]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=141}}\n\nUnder the Pact's terms, Hitler was, in effect, given authorisation to occupy two-thirds of [[Western Poland]], as well as [[Lithuania]]. Molotov was given a free hand in relation to Finland. In the [[Winter War]] that ensued, a combination of fierce Finnish resistance and Soviet mismanagement resulted in Finland losing parts of its territory, but not its independence.{{sfn|Service|2003|pp=256\u2013257}} The Pact was later amended to allocate Lithuania to the Soviet sphere in exchange for a more favourable border in Poland.

Though the purpose of Eden's visit was anti-German rather than anti-Soviet, Molotov assumed otherwise, and in a series of conversations with the Italian Ambassador Augusto Rosso, Molotov claimed that the Soviet Union would soon be faced with an Anglo\u2013Turkish invasion of the [[Crimea]]. The British historian D.C. Watt argued that, on the basis of Molotov's statements to Rosso, it would appear that, in early 1941, Stalin and Molotov viewed Britain rather than Germany as the principal threat.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Cameron Watt, Donald | title = Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy | publisher = [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-415-14435-3 | pages = 276\u2013286 }}</ref>\n[[File:Molotov with Ribbentrop.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Molotov meets with [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] before signing the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|German\u2013Soviet non-aggression pact]]]] \nThe Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact governed Soviet\u2013German relations until June 1941 when Hitler, having occupied France and neutralised Britain, turned east and [[German invasion of the Soviet Union|attacked the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Service|2003|pp=158\u2013160}} Molotov was responsible for telling the [[Soviet people]] of the attack, when he instead of Stalin announced the war.

From there, he took a train to London to discuss with the [[British government]] the possibility of opening a second front against Germany.\n\nAfter signing the [[Anglo\u2013Soviet Treaty of 1942]] on 26 May, Molotov left for Washington, D.C., in the United States. Molotov met with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the President of the United States, and ratified a [[Lend-Lease]] Treaty between the USSR and the US.

In general, he was distinguished by an uncooperative attitude towards the Western powers. Molotov, at the direction of the Soviet government, condemned the [[Marshall Plan]] as imperialistic and claimed it was dividing Europe into two camps, one capitalist and the other communist. In response, the Soviet Union, along with the other [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, initiated what is known as the [[Molotov Plan]].

Molotov had no communication with her, save for the scant news that he got from Beria, whom he loathed.

To the east of the Greuthungi, living near the Don river, were the [[Alans]].\n\nWhen the [[Huns]] arrived in the European Steppe region in the 4th century, first the Alans were forced to join them, and then a large part of the Greuthungi. Alans and Goths became an important part of [[Attila]]'s forces, together with other eastern European peoples. Other Greuthungi, together with some Alans and Huns, crossed the [[Lower Danube]] to join a large group of Tervingi who had entered the [[Roman empire]] in 376. These peoples defeated an imperial army in the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, and came to a settlement agreement within the Roman empire by 382. \n\nThe original tribal names of the Goths fell out of use within the empire. Many of the 382 settlers appear to have been an important component of the [[Visigoths]] who formed under [[Alaric I]]. Based upon interpretations of the ''Getica'' by the 6th century writer [[Jordanes]], although it never mentions the Greuthungi, the Greuthungi are more strongly associated with both the Gothic king [[Ermanaric]], and the later [[Amal dynasty]] who were among Attila's Goths. After the collapse of Attila's empire, the Amals founded the [[Ostrogothic]] kingdom in the Roman Balkans.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe root ''greut-'' is probably related to the [[Old English]] ''greot'', meaning \"gravel, grit, earth\", thus implying that the name refers to a geographical region where the Greuthungi lived.<ref>Sch\u00f6feld, ''W\u00f6rterbuch der altgermanischen personen- und v\u00f6lkernamen'', [https://archive.org/details/wrterbuchderaltg00schn/page/113/ p.113]</ref><ref>{{citation|first=Thomas S. |last=Burns |title=A History of the Ostrogoths |publication-place=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1984 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=dw3FEpOUrRkC}}</ref> \n\nIt has therefore been argued, for example by [[Herwig Wolfram]], who agrees with the older position of [[Franz Altheim]], that this is supported by evidence that geographic descriptors were commonly used to distinguish people living north of the Black Sea both before and after Gothic settlement there.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n58\">Wolfram387&ndash;388 n58.</ref>\n\nMore specifically, he argues that ''Greuthungi'' may indicate that they lived on gritty steppes or \"pebbly coasts\", and should be seen as contrasting with the Tervingi, whose name may be related to the English word \"tree\" and indicate a forest origin.<ref name=\"Wolfram25\">{{citation|first=Herwig |last=Wolfram |title=History of the Goths | translator-last =Dunlap | translator-first =Thomas J. |publication-place=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1988 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=xsQxcJvaLjAC}}</ref> \n\nIt has also been proposed that the name ''Greuthungi'' has pre-Pontic Scandinavian origins.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n58\"/> Wolfram for example notes that J. Svennung for example, has proposed that it may mean \"rock people\", and refer to a rocky homeland west of the [[Geats|Gauts]] in what is today Sweden.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n58\"/> \n\nIt has also been noted by some scholars, starting with [[Karl M\u00fcllenhoff]] in the 19th century, that in a list of peoples living on the island of [[Scandza]], [[Jordanes]] listed \"Mixi, Evagre, and Otingis\" among those who \"live like wild animals in rocks hewn out like castles\".<ref name=chr>Latin and translation given at {{cite book|last=Christensen |first=Arne S\u00f8by|title=Cassiodorus, Jordanes and the History of the Goths: Studies in a Migration Myth |year=2002| location=Copenhagen|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=AcLDHOqOt4cC |ref=harv|pages=267-268}}</ref> M\u00fcllenhoff proposed that the last part referred to the Greutungi, but no consensus has arisen to explain all the terms.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=296\u2013298}}\n\n==History==\n{{see|Ostrogoths#History}}\nAn unreliable later text, the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' text for the Emperor [[Probus]] (died 282), mentions the Greuthungi together with [[Vandals]] and [[Gepids]], who were supposedly settled in [[Thrace]] together with 100,000 [[Bastarnae]]. While the Bastarnae remained faithful, the other three peoples broke faith and were crushed by Probus.<ref>''Historia Augusta'', \"[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Probus*.html Probus]\". See {{harvtxt|Christensen|2002|p=212}}.</ref>\n\nThe first event which can confidently be ascribed to the Greuthungi was much later, in the 369 campaign against the Goths by Emperor [[Valens]], in retribution for the support of the usurper [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]] (died 366). This was described by Ammianus writing in the 390s.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/27*.html Book 27], 5.6.</ref> Valens crossed the Lower Danube at [[Noviodunum (castra)|Novidunum]] and went deep into Gothic territory where he came across the warlike people called the Greuthungi. Their apparent leader [[Athanaric]] who was, in this passage, described by Ammianus as their most powerful judge \"''iudicem potentissimum''\", was compelled to flee, and then make a peace agreement in the middle of the Danube, promising to never set foot on Roman soil. This same Athanaric is later described by Ammianus as a judge of the [[Tervingi]], raising questions about the nature of the distinction between the Tervingi and Greuthungi. Ammianus specifically describes the Greuthungi as Goths.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=212}}\n\nThe Greuthungi were next mentioned by Ammianus as defeated by the invading Huns in the early 370s.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/31*.html Book 31].</ref> The Huns first plundered and recruited the Alans of the Don river (the classical Tanais) and then attacked the domain of the warlike monarch King Ermenric, who was apparently king of the Greuthungi, who eventually committed suicide. \n\n[[Jordanes]] in his history of the Goths, the ''[[Getica]]'', written about 551, does not mention the Greuthungi, but instead writes as if the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothi]] of the 5th and 6th centuries already existed in the 3rd and 4th centuries. Jordanes does on the other hand describe a single large Gothic empire until the late 4th-century, ruled by Ermanaric. In contrast, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], himself writing in the late 4th-century, mentions Ermanaric as the Greuthungi leader, but implies that his kingdom was relatively small compared to the large empire described by Jordanes.<ref>Heather, Peter, 1998, ''The Goths,'' Blackwell, Malden, pp. 53-55.</ref><ref>Kulikowski, Michael, 2007, ''Rome's Gothic Wars'', Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, pp. 54-56, 111-112.</ref>\n\nThe defense against the Huns and Alans continued under a new king Vithimer, who also had Hunnic allies on his side. After he died, the defense was led by two generals Alatheus and Saphrax, while Videricus, Vithimer's son, was a boy. In the meantime, Athanaric, now described by Ammianus as leader of the Tervingi, first moved to the Greuthungi position at the Dniester to block the westward movement of the Huns but was defeated, and then moved his people into a more defensible position further west near the [[Carpathians]]. \n\nIn 376 a large part of the Tervingi were allowed to cross the [[Lower Danube]] entering the Roman Empire with weapons. As tensions rose, Alatheus and Saphrax also crossed with Greuthingi and their king Videricus, despite their requests for permission having been rejected. Athanaric, who was apparently with them before they crossed, moved instead to a mountainous and forested region called Caucalanda, forcing Sarmatians out of the area. Alans and Huns also crossed in 377. The displacement of the Goths into the Balkans peninsula led to the [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)|Gothic War of 376\u2013382]] during which the Greuthungi were allied with the Tervingi. Greuthungi cavalry contributed to the decisive Gothic victory at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] of 9 August 378. In 382 there a more lasting settlement agreement was made for the large number of Goths to settle peacefully in the Balkans and contribute to the Roman military. Unfortunately, the details of this agreement are now unclear.\n\nIn 380, some of the Greuthungi under Alatheus and Saphrax appear to have separated from the main force of the Tervingi, invading the [[Diocese of Pannonia]] in the Northern Balkans, but were defeated by Emperor [[Gratian]]. The outcome of this invasion is unclear, it is possible that they were defeated and dispersed by [[Gratian]], or that they reached a separate peace agreement and settled in Pannonia.<ref>[[Peter Heather]], ''The Fall of the Roman Empire.

To the east of the Greuthungi, living near the Don river, were the [[Alans]].\n\nWhen the [[Huns]] arrived in the European Steppe region in the 4th century, first the Alans were forced to join them, and then a large part of the Greuthungi. Alans and Goths became an important part of [[Attila]]'s forces, together with other eastern European peoples. Other Greuthungi, together with some Alans and Huns, crossed the [[Lower Danube]] to join a large group of Tervingi who had entered the [[Roman empire]] in 376. These peoples defeated an imperial army in the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, and came to a settlement agreement within the Roman empire by 382. \n\nThe original tribal names of the Goths fell out of use within the empire. Many of the 382 settlers appear to have been an important component of the [[Visigoths]] who formed under [[Alaric I]]. Based upon interpretations of the ''Getica'' by the 6th century writer [[Jordanes]], although it never mentions the Greuthungi, the Greuthungi are more strongly associated with both the Gothic king [[Ermanaric]], and the later [[Amal dynasty]] who were among Attila's Goths. After the collapse of Attila's empire, the Amals founded the [[Ostrogothic]] kingdom in the Roman Balkans.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe root ''greut-'' is probably related to the [[Old English]] ''greot'', meaning \"gravel, grit, earth\", thus implying that the name refers to a geographical region where the Greuthungi lived.<ref>Sch\u00f6feld, ''W\u00f6rterbuch der altgermanischen personen- und v\u00f6lkernamen'', [https://archive.org/details/wrterbuchderaltg00schn/page/113/ p.113]</ref><ref>{{citation|first=Thomas S. |last=Burns |title=A History of the Ostrogoths |publication-place=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1984 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=dw3FEpOUrRkC}}</ref> \n\nIt has therefore been argued, for example by [[Herwig Wolfram]], who agrees with the older position of [[Franz Altheim]], that this is supported by evidence that geographic descriptors were commonly used to distinguish people living north of the Black Sea both before and after Gothic settlement there.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n58\">Wolfram387&ndash;388 n58.</ref>\n\nMore specifically, he argues that ''Greuthungi'' may indicate that they lived on gritty steppes or \"pebbly coasts\", and should be seen as contrasting with the Tervingi, whose name may be related to the English word \"tree\" and indicate a forest origin.<ref name=\"Wolfram25\">{{citation|first=Herwig |last=Wolfram |title=History of the Goths | translator-last =Dunlap | translator-first =Thomas J. |publication-place=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1988 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=xsQxcJvaLjAC}}</ref> \n\nIt has also been proposed that the name ''Greuthungi'' has pre-Pontic Scandinavian origins.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n58\"/> Wolfram for example notes that J.

While the Bastarnae remained faithful, the other three peoples broke faith and were crushed by Probus.<ref>''Historia Augusta'', \"[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Probus*.html Probus]\". See {{harvtxt|Christensen|2002|p=212}}.</ref>\n\nThe first event which can confidently be ascribed to the Greuthungi was much later, in the 369 campaign against the Goths by Emperor [[Valens]], in retribution for the support of the usurper [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]] (died 366). This was described by Ammianus writing in the 390s.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/27*.html Book 27], 5.6.</ref> Valens crossed the Lower Danube at [[Noviodunum (castra)|Novidunum]] and went deep into Gothic territory where he came across the warlike people called the Greuthungi. Their apparent leader [[Athanaric]] who was, in this passage, described by Ammianus as their most powerful judge \"''iudicem potentissimum''\", was compelled to flee, and then make a peace agreement in the middle of the Danube, promising to never set foot on Roman soil. This same Athanaric is later described by Ammianus as a judge of the [[Tervingi]], raising questions about the nature of the distinction between the Tervingi and Greuthungi. Ammianus specifically describes the Greuthungi as Goths.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=212}}\n\nThe Greuthungi were next mentioned by Ammianus as defeated by the invading Huns in the early 370s.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/31*.html Book 31].</ref> The Huns first plundered and recruited the Alans of the Don river (the classical Tanais) and then attacked the domain of the warlike monarch King Ermenric, who was apparently king of the Greuthungi, who eventually committed suicide. \n\n[[Jordanes]] in his history of the Goths, the ''[[Getica]]'', written about 551, does not mention the Greuthungi, but instead writes as if the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothi]] of the 5th and 6th centuries already existed in the 3rd and 4th centuries. Jordanes does on the other hand describe a single large Gothic empire until the late 4th-century, ruled by Ermanaric. In contrast, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], himself writing in the late 4th-century, mentions Ermanaric as the Greuthungi leader, but implies that his kingdom was relatively small compared to the large empire described by Jordanes.<ref>Heather, Peter, 1998, ''The Goths,'' Blackwell, Malden, pp. 53-55.</ref><ref>Kulikowski, Michael, 2007, ''Rome's Gothic Wars'', Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, pp. 54-56, 111-112.</ref>\n\nThe defense against the Huns and Alans continued under a new king Vithimer, who also had Hunnic allies on his side. After he died, the defense was led by two generals Alatheus and Saphrax, while Videricus, Vithimer's son, was a boy. In the meantime, Athanaric, now described by Ammianus as leader of the Tervingi, first moved to the Greuthungi position at the Dniester to block the westward movement of the Huns but was defeated, and then moved his people into a more defensible position further west near the [[Carpathians]]. \n\nIn 376 a large part of the Tervingi were allowed to cross the [[Lower Danube]] entering the Roman Empire with weapons.

At times the Pandyas drove deep into Kerala and reaching up to Kanetti near Karunagapally. At other times the Cheras went up to Madurai and beyond.

Modifications to the ''Java Edition'' of ''Minecraft'' are possible because for each new major version of the game, the community reverse-engineers ''Minecraft''{{'s}} source code, which is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].<ref>Koene 2015, Hour 1, pg. 1</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=November 2019}}.  Mojang and Microsoft provide little official support for this (for example, the game provides no modding API for Java, although Mojang does provide methods for deobfuscating the game), but the EULA permits non-commercial mods.\n\nModding to the mobile and console versions of ''Minecraft'' on the [[Minecraft#Pocket/Bedrock Edition|Bedrock codebase]] are different, because that iteration of the game is written in C++ rather than Java.<ref name=\"ViceModding\" /> Players who wish to mod their game on Bedrock codebase versions have a simpler process, due to the version's built-in official support for \"add-ons\", which can be installed faster than ''Java Edition'' mods, and require no external mod loaders.\n\n== History ==\nAlthough the first version of ''Minecraft'' was released in May 2009,<ref name=\"PcGamerFirstMoments\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-first-moments-of-minecraft/ |title=The First Moments of Minecraft |last=Smith |first=Graham |date=6 February 2012 |website=PC Gamer |publisher=Future plc |access-date=12 February 2016}}</ref> client-side modding of the game did not become popular in earnest until the game reached its [[Software release life cycle#Alpha|alpha stage]] in June 2010. The only mods that were released during ''Minecraft''{{'s}} Indev and Infdev development stages were a few client-side mods which had minor changes to the game.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the release of Alpha, the first server-side mods began to appear.{{cn|date=April 2020}} One of them was hMod, which added some simple but necessary tools to manage a server.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Michael Stoyke, also known as Searge who would later go on to work for Mojang, created Minecraft Coder Pack (MCP), which was later renamed to Mod Coder Pack, keeping the same acronym. MCP was a tool which decompiled and deobfuscated ''Minecraft'' code. MCP would recompile and reobfuscate new and changed classes, which can be injected into the game. But, if multiple mods modified the same base code, it would conflict. To solve this problem, Risugami's Modloader was created; Modloader prevented any conflict occurring due to multiple mods modifying the same base classes or game resources.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nTowards the end of 2010, new mods were released which featured more content than previous ones. ''Minecraft'' was now preparing to move into its [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta development phase]], and popular mods such as ''IndustrialCraft'', ''Railcraft'' and ''BuildCraft'' were first released. As opposed to their predecessors, these mods had the potential to change the entire game instead of simply tweaking minor aspects of it.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> Bukkit, a server-side mod intended to replace hMod was also released during this time. CraftBukkit, a server software which implemented the Bukkit API was also released. Bukkit allowed server owners to install plug-ins which modified the server's way of taking input and giving output to the player without players having to install client-side mods.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nAround November 2011, the Forge Mod Loader and Minecraft Forge were released. Forge allowed players to be able to run several mods simultaneously. Forge utilized MCP mappings. Forge also released a server version of  Forge, which allowed mods to be run on servers, which eventually led to people creating modded servers. Forge ended the necessity to manipulate the base source code, allowing separate mods to run together without requiring them to touch the base source code.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> Forge also included many libraries and hooks which made mod development easier.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:@jeb talking at the modders panel @ MineCon 2012.jpg|thumb|In 2012, Mojang organized a panel on modding at [[MineCon#2012|MineCon 2012]], where ''Minecraft''{{'s}} lead developer [[Jens Bergensten]] held a talk.]]\nAfter ''Minecraft'' was fully released in November 2011, the game's modding community continued to grow.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> In February 2012, Mojang hired developers of the Bukkit to work on an official modding [[Application programming interface|API]], allowing mod developers easier access to the ''Minecraft'' game files.<ref name=\"ModdingAPIEurogamer\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-29-mojang-hires-bukkit-server-mod-team-to-make-official-minecraft-api |title=Mojang hires Bukkit server-mod team to make official Minecraft API |last=Purchese |first=Robert |date=29 February 2012 |website=Eurogamer |publisher=Gamer Network |access-date=13 February 2016}}</ref> Bukkit was then maintained by the community. A fork of CraftBukkit, called Spigot which was backward compatible with plugins was also in development. An Alternative to forge named Liteloader was released. Liteloader made modding very simple and promoted adding new content instead of modifying existing content. Like forge, Liteloader also used MCP mappings.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 2013, Forge Mod Loader soon replaced Risugami's Modloader as Modloader wasn't being updated in time by its developers.{{cn|date=April 2020}} In early 2014, a new server software named Sponge, which had a very powerful plugin API compared to Bukkit, and was also compatible with running Forge mods was released. Sponge also introduced [[mixin]]s, an alternatively to modifying byte code. Soon, Liteloader implemented mixins into their API allowing developers to modify in-game content.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn mid-2014, Spigot released a server software made to link many servers together. The project was called BungeeCord, and had a separate plugin API from spigot and spigot plugins could work side by side with BungeeCord. Many popular Minecraft servers use BungeeCord to link up Minecraft servers together.{{cn|date=April 2020}} PaperMC also released a modified version of BungeeCord called Waterfall, which included optimizations that were not present in Spigot.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nConcern arose following Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang in late 2014. Members of the modding community feared that ''Minecraft''{{'}}s new American owners would put an end to Mojang's established practice of giving free rein to mod developers.<ref name=\"BloombergEdu\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-19/microsoft-turns-a-minecraft-mod-into-an-education-business |title=Microsoft Turns a Minecraft Mod Into an Education Business |last=Brustein |first=Joshua |date=19 January 2016 |website=Bloomberg L.P. |publisher=Bloomberg |access-date=13 February 2016}}</ref> Despite the concerns, Microsoft did not announce any changes to Mojang's policies, and modding was unaffected.<ref name=\"BloombergEdu\" />\n\nIn April 2015, Microsoft announced that it was adding a ''Minecraft'' Mod Developer Pack to [[Microsoft Visual Studio]], granting users of the application creation software an easier way to program ''Minecraft'' mods.<ref name=\"GeekVisualStudio\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.geek.com/microsoft/microsoft-embraces-minecraft-modding-with-new-visual-studio-tools-1621890/ |title=Microsoft embraces Minecraft modding with new Visual Studio tools |last=Mathews |first=Lee |date=1 May 2015 |website=Geek.com |publisher=Ziff Davis Media |access-date=13 February 2016}}</ref> Microsoft released the new pack open source and free of charge, amidst a drive to push towards more open source software.<ref name=\"GeekVisualStudio\" /><ref name=\"MicrosoftOpenSource\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/08/microsoft-moves-toward-open-source-linux-fills-cloud/ |title=Microsoft Moves Toward Open Source as Linux Fills Its Cloud |last=Metz |first=Cade |date=12 August 2015 |website=Wired |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast Publishing |access-date=14 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2016, a new modding toolchain known as Fabric was released. Fabric devised its own set of free mappings to use instead of MCP mappings. Fabric also used Sponge's mixins.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Fabric was very light and did not have all the elements of a forge mod, and could also be released from developmental snapshot versions of Minecraft, which other mod loaders could not.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nA new [[Windows 10]] version of ''Minecraft'' was announced shortly after which, unlike the previous versions, was to be programmed in [[C++]].<ref name=\"ViceModding\">{{Cite web |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-gamers-are-worried-about-minecraft-windows-10-edition |title='Why Gamers Are Worried About 'Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition' |last=Maiberg |first=Emanuel |date=6 July 2015 |website=VICE |publisher=Motherboard |access-date=18 February 2016}}</ref> This announcement sparked concern amongst the game's fanbase that the Java-based versions would end up being phased out entirely, which would hamper the production of mods as C++ is not as \"reverse engineerable\" as Java is known to be. However, Mojang developer Tommaso Checchi reassured fans on [[Reddit]] that modding was \"too important\" to ''Minecraft'' for the Java-based versions to be discontinued.<ref name=\"ViceModding\" />\n\nIn April 2017, Mojang announced the upcoming creation of the ''Minecraft Marketplace'', where players would be able to sell user-created content for the Windows 10 version of the game (running on the Bedrock codebase).<ref name=\"PcGamesMarketplace\" /> Although this new digital store would specialize in adventure maps, skins, texture packs, PC World did note that this addition would move the Windows 10 version \"a bit closer to the moddable worlds familiar to classic players\" of the original ''Java Edition''.<ref name=\"PcWorldMarketplace\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3188093/gaming/minecraft-pulls-pocket-users-closer-to-windows-with-paid-dlc-and-paint-3d-support.html |title=Minecraft pulls Pocket users closer to Windows with paid DLC and Paint 3D support |last=Hachman |first=Mark |date=10 April 2017 |website=PCWorld |publisher=IDG |access-date=27 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Forge underwent a large rewrite, partially because of the large changes in ''Java Edition'' version 1.13 and to support their new long-term support system for upcoming versions.{{cn|date=April 2020}} This made many modders use 1.12.2 as their primary version.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Mod Coder Pack stopped receiving updates after 1.12.2. Liteloader was not updated for 1.13, and in its succession came Rift. Rift was a light mod loader for 1.13 to 1.13.2 which also used mixins. However, Liteloader and Rift did not release a mod loader for servers, so Liteloader and Rift mods could only run on the game client.{{cn|date=April 2020}} A new server software for 1.12.2 named Magma was released, which allowed using PaperMC plugins and Forge mods together.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn late 2018, Fabric underwent a complete rewrite. Mappings' names were changed and more hooks were added to make modding easier. Fabric also began becoming very popular and 1.14 modding began to split between Forge and Fabric.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Forge released their new long-term support system for ''Java Edition'' version 1.14, and updating mods to newer versions was made easier.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn August 2019, Microsoft decided to partnering with [[Nvidia]] to add support for ray tracing technology. This new update is expected to be released in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.minecraftglobal.com/minecraft-with-ray-tracing/ |title=Minecraft with Ray Tracing explained |date=8 November 2019 |website=Minecraft Global |access-date=9 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, as of 2020, the modding community is split up between Forge and Fabric. Server modding is split up between CraftBukkit, Spigot, PaperMC and Sponge. Server linking software is split between BungeeCord and Waterfall.{{cn|date=April 2020}} \n\n===Controversies===\nOver the course of the years, there have been mod-related controversies with ''Minecraft''. One surrounded a mod called GregTech, which was aimed at increasing ''Minecraft''{{'}}s difficulty.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://crysis.tv/feed-the-beast-the-mod-wars/ |title=Feed The Beast: The Mod Wars |last=Stitz |first=Joe |date=18 August 2013 |website=CrysisTV |publisher=CrysisTV |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216051233/http://crysis.tv/feed-the-beast-the-mod-wars/ |archive-date=16 February 2016 |access-date=11 February 2016}}</ref> In 2013, its developer, Greg, noticed that some of GregTech's added recipes had been overwritten by another mod named Tinkers' Construct. Greg, in retaliation, deliberately inserted code into GregTech which would crash the game client if it detected any other mods (such as Tinkers' Construct). The authors of both mods later settled their dispute.<ref name=\"RockPaperShotgun\" /><ref name=\"PcGamesGregTinkers\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcgamesn.com/minecraft/minecraft-mod-gregtech-contains-code-crash-game-should-its-changes-be-undone-other-mods |title=Minecraft mod GregTech contains code to crash game |last=Benson |first=Julian |date=30 June 2013 |website=PCGamesN |publisher=Network N |access-date=18 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nAnother surrounded the mod Bukkit, an API which enabled others to install server-side mods.<ref name=\"Cadenhead2\">Cadenhead 2014, p. 2</ref> In 2014, the leader of the Bukkit team Warren \"EvilSeph\" Loo (who previously worked for Mojang) announced that development would cease, and Mojang stepped in to save the project.<ref name=\"AsModTurns\" /> With Mojang's announcement, the intellectual rights to the project became ambiguous.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> Licensing conflicts arose between the original creators of Bukkit and maintainers, largely revolving around the who \"owned\" the project after the primary maintainers resigned.

Mojang and Microsoft provide little official support for this (for example, the game provides no modding API for Java, although Mojang does provide methods for deobfuscating the game), but the EULA permits non-commercial mods.\n\nModding to the mobile and console versions of ''Minecraft'' on the [[Minecraft#Pocket/Bedrock Edition|Bedrock codebase]] are different, because that iteration of the game is written in C++ rather than Java.<ref name=\"ViceModding\" /> Players who wish to mod their game on Bedrock codebase versions have a simpler process, due to the version's built-in official support for \"add-ons\", which can be installed faster than ''Java Edition'' mods, and require no external mod loaders.\n\n== History ==\nAlthough the first version of ''Minecraft'' was released in May 2009,<ref name=\"PcGamerFirstMoments\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-first-moments-of-minecraft/ |title=The First Moments of Minecraft |last=Smith |first=Graham |date=6 February 2012 |website=PC Gamer |publisher=Future plc |access-date=12 February 2016}}</ref> client-side modding of the game did not become popular in earnest until the game reached its [[Software release life cycle#Alpha|alpha stage]] in June 2010. The only mods that were released during ''Minecraft''{{'s}} Indev and Infdev development stages were a few client-side mods which had minor changes to the game.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the release of Alpha, the first server-side mods began to appear.{{cn|date=April 2020}} One of them was hMod, which added some simple but necessary tools to manage a server.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Michael Stoyke, also known as Searge who would later go on to work for Mojang, created Minecraft Coder Pack (MCP), which was later renamed to Mod Coder Pack, keeping the same acronym. MCP was a tool which decompiled and deobfuscated ''Minecraft'' code. MCP would recompile and reobfuscate new and changed classes, which can be injected into the game. But, if multiple mods modified the same base code, it would conflict. To solve this problem, Risugami's Modloader was created; Modloader prevented any conflict occurring due to multiple mods modifying the same base classes or game resources.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nTowards the end of 2010, new mods were released which featured more content than previous ones. ''Minecraft'' was now preparing to move into its [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta development phase]], and popular mods such as ''IndustrialCraft'', ''Railcraft'' and ''BuildCraft'' were first released. As opposed to their predecessors, these mods had the potential to change the entire game instead of simply tweaking minor aspects of it.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> Bukkit, a server-side mod intended to replace hMod was also released during this time. CraftBukkit, a server software which implemented the Bukkit API was also released. Bukkit allowed server owners to install plug-ins which modified the server's way of taking input and giving output to the player without players having to install client-side mods.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nAround November 2011, the Forge Mod Loader and Minecraft Forge were released. Forge allowed players to be able to run several mods simultaneously. Forge utilized MCP mappings. Forge also released a server version of  Forge, which allowed mods to be run on servers, which eventually led to people creating modded servers. Forge ended the necessity to manipulate the base source code, allowing separate mods to run together without requiring them to touch the base source code.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> Forge also included many libraries and hooks which made mod development easier.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:@jeb talking at the modders panel @ MineCon 2012.jpg|thumb|In 2012, Mojang organized a panel on modding at [[MineCon#2012|MineCon 2012]], where ''Minecraft''{{'s}} lead developer [[Jens Bergensten]] held a talk.]]\nAfter ''Minecraft'' was fully released in November 2011, the game's modding community continued to grow.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> In February 2012, Mojang hired developers of the Bukkit to work on an official modding [[Application programming interface|API]], allowing mod developers easier access to the ''Minecraft'' game files.<ref name=\"ModdingAPIEurogamer\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-29-mojang-hires-bukkit-server-mod-team-to-make-official-minecraft-api |title=Mojang hires Bukkit server-mod team to make official Minecraft API |last=Purchese |first=Robert |date=29 February 2012 |website=Eurogamer |publisher=Gamer Network |access-date=13 February 2016}}</ref> Bukkit was then maintained by the community. A fork of CraftBukkit, called Spigot which was backward compatible with plugins was also in development. An Alternative to forge named Liteloader was released. Liteloader made modding very simple and promoted adding new content instead of modifying existing content. Like forge, Liteloader also used MCP mappings.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 2013, Forge Mod Loader soon replaced Risugami's Modloader as Modloader wasn't being updated in time by its developers.{{cn|date=April 2020}} In early 2014, a new server software named Sponge, which had a very powerful plugin API compared to Bukkit, and was also compatible with running Forge mods was released. Sponge also introduced [[mixin]]s, an alternatively to modifying byte code. Soon, Liteloader implemented mixins into their API allowing developers to modify in-game content.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn mid-2014, Spigot released a server software made to link many servers together. The project was called BungeeCord, and had a separate plugin API from spigot and spigot plugins could work side by side with BungeeCord. Many popular Minecraft servers use BungeeCord to link up Minecraft servers together.{{cn|date=April 2020}} PaperMC also released a modified version of BungeeCord called Waterfall, which included optimizations that were not present in Spigot.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nConcern arose following Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang in late 2014. Members of the modding community feared that ''Minecraft''{{'}}s new American owners would put an end to Mojang's established practice of giving free rein to mod developers.<ref name=\"BloombergEdu\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-19/microsoft-turns-a-minecraft-mod-into-an-education-business |title=Microsoft Turns a Minecraft Mod Into an Education Business |last=Brustein |first=Joshua |date=19 January 2016 |website=Bloomberg L.P. |publisher=Bloomberg |access-date=13 February 2016}}</ref> Despite the concerns, Microsoft did not announce any changes to Mojang's policies, and modding was unaffected.<ref name=\"BloombergEdu\" />\n\nIn April 2015, Microsoft announced that it was adding a ''Minecraft'' Mod Developer Pack to [[Microsoft Visual Studio]], granting users of the application creation software an easier way to program ''Minecraft'' mods.<ref name=\"GeekVisualStudio\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.geek.com/microsoft/microsoft-embraces-minecraft-modding-with-new-visual-studio-tools-1621890/ |title=Microsoft embraces Minecraft modding with new Visual Studio tools |last=Mathews |first=Lee |date=1 May 2015 |website=Geek.com |publisher=Ziff Davis Media |access-date=13 February 2016}}</ref> Microsoft released the new pack open source and free of charge, amidst a drive to push towards more open source software.<ref name=\"GeekVisualStudio\" /><ref name=\"MicrosoftOpenSource\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/08/microsoft-moves-toward-open-source-linux-fills-cloud/ |title=Microsoft Moves Toward Open Source as Linux Fills Its Cloud |last=Metz |first=Cade |date=12 August 2015 |website=Wired |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast Publishing |access-date=14 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2016, a new modding toolchain known as Fabric was released. Fabric devised its own set of free mappings to use instead of MCP mappings. Fabric also used Sponge's mixins.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Fabric was very light and did not have all the elements of a forge mod, and could also be released from developmental snapshot versions of Minecraft, which other mod loaders could not.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nA new [[Windows 10]] version of ''Minecraft'' was announced shortly after which, unlike the previous versions, was to be programmed in [[C++]].<ref name=\"ViceModding\">{{Cite web |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-gamers-are-worried-about-minecraft-windows-10-edition |title='Why Gamers Are Worried About 'Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition' |last=Maiberg |first=Emanuel |date=6 July 2015 |website=VICE |publisher=Motherboard |access-date=18 February 2016}}</ref> This announcement sparked concern amongst the game's fanbase that the Java-based versions would end up being phased out entirely, which would hamper the production of mods as C++ is not as \"reverse engineerable\" as Java is known to be. However, Mojang developer Tommaso Checchi reassured fans on [[Reddit]] that modding was \"too important\" to ''Minecraft'' for the Java-based versions to be discontinued.<ref name=\"ViceModding\" />\n\nIn April 2017, Mojang announced the upcoming creation of the ''Minecraft Marketplace'', where players would be able to sell user-created content for the Windows 10 version of the game (running on the Bedrock codebase).<ref name=\"PcGamesMarketplace\" /> Although this new digital store would specialize in adventure maps, skins, texture packs, PC World did note that this addition would move the Windows 10 version \"a bit closer to the moddable worlds familiar to classic players\" of the original ''Java Edition''.<ref name=\"PcWorldMarketplace\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3188093/gaming/minecraft-pulls-pocket-users-closer-to-windows-with-paid-dlc-and-paint-3d-support.html |title=Minecraft pulls Pocket users closer to Windows with paid DLC and Paint 3D support |last=Hachman |first=Mark |date=10 April 2017 |website=PCWorld |publisher=IDG |access-date=27 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Forge underwent a large rewrite, partially because of the large changes in ''Java Edition'' version 1.13 and to support their new long-term support system for upcoming versions.{{cn|date=April 2020}} This made many modders use 1.12.2 as their primary version.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Mod Coder Pack stopped recieving updates after 1.12.2. Liteloader was not updated for 1.13, and in its succession came Rift. Rift was a light mod loader for 1.13 to 1.13.2 which also used mixins. However, Liteloader and Rift did not release a mod loader for servers, so Liteloader and Rift mods could only run on the game client.{{cn|date=April 2020}} A new server software for 1.12.2 named Magma was released, which allowed using PaperMC plugins and Forge mods together.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn late 2018, Fabric underwent a complete rewrite. Mappings' names were changed and more hooks were added to make modding easier. Fabric also began becoming very popular and 1.14 modding began to split between Forge and Fabric.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Forge released their new long-term support system for ''Java Edition'' version 1.14, and updating mods to newer versions was made easier.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn August 2019, Microsoft decided to partnering with [[Nvidia]] to add support for ray tracing technology. This new update is expected to be released in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.minecraftglobal.com/minecraft-with-ray-tracing/ |title=Minecraft with Ray Tracing explained |date=8 November 2019 |website=Minecraft Global |access-date=9 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, as of 2020, the modding community is split up between Forge and Fabric. Server modding is split up between CraftBukkit, Spigot, PaperMC and Sponge. Server linking software is split between BungeeCord and Waterfall.{{cn|date=April 2020}} \n\n===Controversies===\nOver the course of the years, there have been mod-related controversies with ''Minecraft''. One surrounded a mod called GregTech, which was aimed at increasing ''Minecraft''{{'}}s difficulty.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://crysis.tv/feed-the-beast-the-mod-wars/ |title=Feed The Beast: The Mod Wars |last=Stitz |first=Joe |date=18 August 2013 |website=CrysisTV |publisher=CrysisTV |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216051233/http://crysis.tv/feed-the-beast-the-mod-wars/ |archive-date=16 February 2016 |access-date=11 February 2016}}</ref> In 2013, its developer, Greg, noticed that some of GregTech's added recipes had been overwritten by another mod named Tinkers' Construct. Greg, in retaliation, deliberately inserted code into GregTech which would crash the game client if it detected any other mods (such as Tinkers' Construct). The authors of both mods later settled their dispute.<ref name=\"RockPaperShotgun\" /><ref name=\"PcGamesGregTinkers\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcgamesn.com/minecraft/minecraft-mod-gregtech-contains-code-crash-game-should-its-changes-be-undone-other-mods |title=Minecraft mod GregTech contains code to crash game |last=Benson |first=Julian |date=30 June 2013 |website=PCGamesN |publisher=Network N |access-date=18 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nAnother surrounded the mod Bukkit, an API which enabled others to install server-side mods.<ref name=\"Cadenhead2\">Cadenhead 2014, p. 2</ref> In 2014, the leader of the Bukkit team Warren \"EvilSeph\" Loo (who previously worked for Mojang) announced that development would cease, and Mojang stepped in to save the project.<ref name=\"AsModTurns\" /> With Mojang's announcement, the intellectual rights to the project became ambiguous.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> Licensing conflicts arose between the original creators of Bukkit and maintainers, largely revolving around the who \"owned\" the project after the primary maintainers resigned.

Some circulating miRNAs are specific to tumour patients, while miR-92 on the other-hand is present in healthy individuals in the serum, but levels are variable and appear to change in response to the onset of some cancers.<ref name=pmid19440243/>\n\n==Family==\nmiR-92 is part of a large precursor sequence that forms a [[Stem-loop|stem loop]] once transcribed into RNA. This long precursor sequence is a component of the mir-17-92 cluster which contains 5 additional mir precursor sequences: [[Mir-17 microRNA precursor family|mir-17]], mir-18a, [[Mir-19 microRNA precursor family|mir-19a]], mir-20a and mir19b-1.<ref name=pmid20484043/> The components have related functions and also exist in their mature form as part of RNP complexes.<ref name=pmid11914277/> The cluster is called Oncomir-1 because all members have been connected with inducing enhanced cell proliferation and suppression of apoptosis.<ref name=pmid20484043/> Oncomir-1 has 2 paralogs, miR-106a-363 and mir-106b-25.

MB can be induced by 2 inherited cancer syndromes, one of which is called the [[Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome|Gorlin syndrome]] and is caused by a mutated [[Patched|PATCHED]](PTCH) gene. PTCH is the receptor for [[Sonic hedgehog]] (SHH). This SHH signalling pathway is crucial during early development and SSH is the major mitogen for GNP proliferation.<ref name=pmid19196975/> [[Mismatch repair cancer syndrome|Turcots's syndrome]] can give rise to MB as well, resulting from a mutated adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene (a member of the [[Wnt signaling pathway|wingless]] (WNT signalling pathway). But only Gorlin syndrome and the SHH pathway is thought to incorporate the mode of action of the miR-17-92 cluster.\n\n==Expression patterns==\nExpression patterns of many miRNAs are timing and organ specific, especially those involved in the regulation of development. miRNA libraries constructed from cloning and sequencing short RNAs derived from cultures of mouse embryonic stem cells have shown miR-92 to be expressed. These totipotent cells represent the earliest stages of mammalian development (they are derived from the inner cells of the blastocyst<ref name=pmid12919684>{{cite journal | vauthors = Houbaviy HB, Murray MF, Sharp PA | title = Embryonic stem cell-specific MicroRNAs | journal = Developmental Cell | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 351\u20138 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12919684 | doi = 10.1016/S1534-5807(03)00227-2 }}</ref>\n). However, mir-92 was also present in libraries constructed from four-day-old fully differentiated cells, as well as libraries constructed from adult tissues. An miRNA that remains constant in its expression through these stages is proposed to have a role in regulating general aspects of cell physiology.<ref name=pmid12919684/> Thus it was becoming evident in 2003 shortly after its discovery, that the mir-92 miRNA and associated family members are providing functional roles to the cell cycle and to cell signalling, and to general cell physiology.\n\nAs there is a relatively small number of miRNAs encoded in the human genome compared with the number of protein coding genes, miRNAs are becoming the biomarkers of choice to characterise the state of a tissue or cell sample. Also there are no mRNA markers that show consistent differential expression between tumours and normal tissues but profiling all of the miRNAs has proved much more informative with respect to cancer diagnosis and its developmental origins.<ref name=pmid15944708>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu J, Getz G, Miska EA, Alvarez-Saavedra E, Lamb J, Peck D, Sweet-Cordero A, Ebert BL, Mak RH, Ferrando AA, Downing JR, Jacks T, Horvitz HR, Golub TR | title = MicroRNA expression profiles classify human cancers | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7043 | pages = 834\u20138 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15944708 | doi = 10.1038/nature03702 | bibcode = 2005Natur.435..834L }}</ref> The extent of differential expression of miRNAs is even high enough that hierarchical clustering has enabled petitioning of samples within a single developmental lineage reflecting mechanisms of transformation and providing miRNA finger prints that encode the development of typical human cancers.<ref name=pmid15944708/> As mir-92 is expressed in the majority of cells at all times, its expression profiles will form a reliable part of diagnosis and detection of disease. miR-92a is also present in the blood plasma of humans along with 91 other miRNAs.<ref name=pmid18663219>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitchell PS, Parkin RK, Kroh EM, Fritz BR, Wyman SK, Pogosova-Agadjanyan EL, Peterson A, Noteboom J, O'Briant KC, Allen A, Lin DW, Urban N, Drescher CW, Knudsen BS, Stirewalt DL, Gentleman R, Vessella RL, Nelson PS, Martin DB, Tewari M | title = Circulating microRNAs as stable blood-based markers for cancer detection | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 30 | pages = 10513\u20138 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18663219 | pmc = 2492472 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0804549105 | bibcode = 2008PNAS..10510513M }}</ref>\n\nThe level of miR-92a in the circulation has been shown to reflect the onset of certain types of leukaemia (see experimental evidence section).\n\n==Gene targets==\nAs miR recognition elements are typically found in the 3' UTR of the target gene mRNA, bioinformatics alone can identify putative miR-92 targets using resources such as miRGen database. In one report, miRanda software found 300 different genes that have putative miR-92a binding sites conserved among Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Rattus norvegicus at the 3' UTR regions of their transcripts.<ref name=pmid20518884/> Two genes brought into the limelight by such means were [[Estrogen receptor beta|ER\u03b2]] and [[CA-125|MUC16]].<ref name=pmid20484043/> Down regulation of oestrogen receptors \u03b21 and \u03b1 have been associated with various forms of breast cancer. While the mode of action of ER\u03b1 is not well established there is strong evidence supporting a role for miR-92 within the regulatory pathway of ER\u03b21.<ref name=pmid20484043/> Profiling different breast cancer cell lines against non cancerous control cell lines demonstrated a significant inverse relationship between expression of ER\u03b21 and miR-92. Specifically, MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines transfected with anti-miR-92 showed an increase in ER\u03b21 whereas transfection with pre-miR-92 resulted in down regulation of ER\u03b21. Similarly, and as a side experiment, the knock down of miR-92 had equivalent action of restoring MUC16 expression in the same cell type.<ref name=pmid20484043/> Further evidence came when transfecting MCF-7 cells with a GFP reporter cloned to contain the ER\u03b21 3' UTR region. Flow cytometry revealed significant increase in green fluorescence upon transfection with anti-miR-92. This evidence suggests that miR-92 targets both ER\u03b21 and MUC16 mRNA and in doing so suppresses their expression.<ref name=pmid20484043/>\n\n==Experimental evidence==\n\n===First clues for the function of mir-17-92===\nmiR-92 miRNA was first isolated from Hela cell lysate from a ~15S sediment particle.

This was concluded after [[microarray]] screening of blood plasma from leukaemia patients against healthy samples. Although the over-all expression profiles were not significantly different the rank order of intensity of a few key small RNAs changed drastically enough to encourage attention and specific analysis. MiR-92 was one of these.<ref name=pmid19440243/> [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|RT-PCR]] confirmed a down regulation of miR-92a in patients of acute myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. MiR-92a is strongly expressed in the leukaemia cells themselves with no expression detected in normal blasts ([[In situ hybridization|''in situ'' hybridisation]]).<ref name=pmid19440243/> This appears counter-intuitive firstly because there is no obvious source for miRNA production or maintenance in blood plasma, and secondly because there seems to be an inverse relationship between leukaemia cell miR-92 levels and blood plasma miR-92 levels in patients with the disease. 91 miRNAs are present in human plasma<ref name=pmid18663219/> and it has been proposed that miR-92a along with other serum-typical miRs such as miR-638, are packaged inside exosomes that are secreted from cells. For miRNAs to exist in plasma they need to be in a form that is resistant to [[Ribonuclease|RNase]] activity<ref name=pmid18663219/> and this could be achieved from within exosomes. Since we have established that miR-92 is such a prominent feature in many cancers it is tempting to conclude that cancer cells may take in the exosomes to supplement the amount of locally expressed miR-92a.<ref name=pmid19440243/> The result of this action would be a corresponding decrease of miR-92a in blood plasma.\n\n===Role of miR-92 in Hepatocellular Cancer===\nEvidence supporting a role for miR-92 in hepatocellular cancer (HCC) was derived from ''in situ'' hybridisation experiments of tumours.<ref name=pmid20518884/> Over expression of miR-92 was well pronounced across sex, age, virus type, clinical stage, and tumour differentiation stage, making miR-92 a potential robust biomarker for HCC.

An abnormal functioning of which can induce the GNP tumours typical of Medullablastoma. This hypothesis was arrived at by taking miRNA expression profiles of GNP-like tumour cells from mouse mutants.<ref name=pmid19196975/> There are various mouse knock out mutants that show a spontaneous development of MB within 5 months of life. They form a classic group for the study of medullablastoma and other cancers and include mice lines that are KO for [[p53]], [[PTCH1|Ptch1]], and Ink4c. Of the 26 miRNAs showing higher expression levels (in one of the mutant groups) against wild type mice, 9 of them were from the mir-17-92 cluster and its 2 paralogs. Overall signature changes across mutant groups and control groups were largely insignificant and the mir-17-92 cluster was only implicated in mutant mice that had an active SHH pathway.<ref name=pmid19196975/> These observations merited further focus on the cluster and QRT-PCR was used to measure  the expression of the oncogenic cluster in samples of MB tumours more accurately. Over expression was particularly pronounced for miR-92 and miR20a. Similarly, these trends were only present in tumours whose expression profiles revealed an activated SHH pathway.<ref name=pmid19196975/>\n\nThe implication is that miR-92 and other miRNAs from mir-17-92 drive the formation of human MB by acting upon the SHH/PTCH pathway. In further studies with mice, an inhibitor of the SHH pathway (cyclopamine drug) was sufficient to reduce proliferation of tumour cells that had been infected with a retro virus encoding mir-17-92 (plus a GFP reporter). The level of reduction in proliferation was towards background levels of normal MB tumours: as in those uninfected with the retro virus. Once again, an aberrant SHH/PTCH pathway was necessary for these observations.<ref name=pmid19196975/>\n\n===Role of miR-92 ortholog in ''Caenorhabditis elegans''===\nThe miR-92 family is evolutionally conserved microRNAs,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Olive V, Jiang I, He L | year = 2010 | title = mir-17-92, a cluster of miRNAs in the midst of the cancer network | url = | journal = Int.

Thanks to the level of diversity in miRNA expression across cancers, using them as a diagnosis and classification tool has serious potential. The modest number of miRNAs present in the genome and in specific profiling experiments allow for highly resolved patterns without overly complex data sets. As an example, a set of miRNA profiles of well differentiated cancers was used to train a decision algorithm for application on another set of poorly differentiated tumours (for which clinical diagnosis is normally established by anatomical means). Successful diagnosis of the test set was significantly increased.<ref name=pmid15944708/>\n\nApart from diagnosis and characterisation of cancers, there is also therapeutic value to the discovery of miR-92s involvement in essential cell physiology and in promoting cancer. Returning to our review of breast cancer, the isoform ER\u03b21 is well studied as having anti-proliferative effects and pro-apoptotic effects.<ref name=pmid20484043/> We discussed that miR-92 targets and down regulates ER\u03b21, and evidence suggests that miR-92 is regulated by oestrogen which is upstream of the ER\u03b21.<ref name=pmid20484043/> Evidence for this was demonstrated by growing MCF-7 cells in oestrogen depleted conditions and adding antagonists to the oestrogen receptors: [[Tamoxifen]] and E2. miR-92 was upregulated in response, suggesting that the likely oncogenic role for miR-92 in this context is inhibition of ER\u03b21 expression in the presence of oestrogen. Thus, a therapeutic strategy against breast cancer could be aimed at re-activating expression of ER\u03b21 through manipulation of miR-92 expression.<ref name=pmid20484043/>\n\nFor HCC patients (discussed in the previous section), quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated a reduction of miR-92a in the plasma against healthy blood samples.<ref name=pmid20518884/> Similarly, the over-expression of miR-92a can also be detected in human faeces in colorectal cancer patients.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yau |first1=Tung On |last2=Tang |first2=Ceen-Ming |last3=Harriss |first3=Elinor K. |last4=Dickins |first4=Benjamin |last5=Polytarchou |first5=Christos |title=Faecal microRNAs as a non-invasive tool in the diagnosis of colonic adenomas and colorectal cancer: A meta-analysis |journal=Scientific Reports |date=1 July 2019 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=9491 |doi=10.1038/s41598-019-45570-9 |pmid=31263200 |pmc=6603164 }}</ref> This bears similarities to the discoveries made by profiling leukaemia patients (also discussed in the previous section).<ref name=pmid19440243/> The expression differences in both cases was relative to miR-638 levels. miR-638 is an miRNA that seems to have a consistent presence in human blood plasma and may be physiologically necessary.

MB can be induced by 2 inherited cancer syndromes, one of which is called the [[Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome|Gorlin syndrome]] and is caused by a mutated [[Patched|PATCHED]](PTCH) gene. PTCH is the receptor for [[Sonic hedgehog]] (SHH). This SHH signalling pathway is crucial during early development and SSH is the major mitogen for GNP proliferation.<ref name=pmid19196975/> [[Mismatch repair cancer syndrome|Turcots's syndrome]] can give rise to MB as well, resulting from a mutated adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene (a member of the [[Wnt signaling pathway|wingless]] (WNT signalling pathway). But only Gorlin syndrome and the SHH pathway is thought to incorporate the mode of action of the miR-17-92 cluster.\n\n==Expression patterns==\nExpression patterns of many miRNAs are timing and organ specific, especially those involved in the regulation of development. miRNA libraries constructed from cloning and sequencing short RNAs derived from cultures of mouse embryonic stem cells have shown miR-92 to be expressed. These totipotent cells represent the earliest stages of mammalian development (they are derived from the inner cells of the blastocyst<ref name=pmid12919684>{{cite journal | vauthors = Houbaviy HB, Murray MF, Sharp PA | title = Embryonic stem cell-specific MicroRNAs | journal = Developmental Cell | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 351\u20138 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12919684 | doi = 10.1016/S1534-5807(03)00227-2 }}</ref>\n).

In one report, miRanda software found 300 different genes that have putative miR-92a binding sites conserved among Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Rattus norvegicus at the 3' UTR regions of their transcripts.<ref name=pmid20518884/> Two genes brought into the limelight by such means were [[Estrogen receptor beta|ER\u03b2]] and [[CA-125|MUC16]].<ref name=pmid20484043/> Down regulation of oestrogen receptors \u03b21 and \u03b1 have been associated with various forms of breast cancer. While the mode of action of ER\u03b1 is not well established there is strong evidence supporting a role for miR-92 within the regulatory pathway of ER\u03b21.<ref name=pmid20484043/> Profiling different breast cancer cell lines against non cancerous control cell lines demonstrated a significant inverse relationship between expression of ER\u03b21 and miR-92. Specifically, MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines transfected with anti-miR-92 showed an increase in ER\u03b21 whereas transfection with pre-miR-92 resulted in down regulation of ER\u03b21. Similarly, and as a side experiment, the knock down of miR-92 had equivalent action of restoring MUC16 expression in the same cell type.<ref name=pmid20484043/> Further evidence came when transfecting MCF-7 cells with a GFP reporter cloned to contain the ER\u03b21 3' UTR region. Flow cytometry revealed significant increase in green fluorescence upon transfection with anti-miR-92.

This was concluded after [[microarray]] screening of blood plasma from leukaemia patients against healthy samples. Although the over-all expression profiles were not significantly different the rank order of intensity of a few key small RNAs changed drastically enough to encourage attention and specific analysis. MiR-92 was one of these.<ref name=pmid19440243/> [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|RT-PCR]] confirmed a down regulation of miR-92a in patients of acute myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. MiR-92a is strongly expressed in the leukaemia cells themselves with no expression detected in normal blasts ([[In situ hybridization|''in situ'' hybridisation]]).<ref name=pmid19440243/> This appears counter-intuitive firstly because there is no obvious source for miRNA production or maintenance in blood plasma, and secondly because there seems to be an inverse relationship between leukaemia cell miR-92 levels and blood plasma miR-92 levels in patients with the disease. 91 miRNAs are present in human plasma<ref name=pmid18663219/> and it has been proposed that miR-92a along with other serum-typical miRs such as miR-638, are packaged inside exosomes that are secreted from cells. For miRNAs to exist in plasma they need to be in a form that is resistant to [[Ribonuclease|RNase]] activity<ref name=pmid18663219/> and this could be achieved from within exosomes. Since we have established that miR-92 is such a prominent feature in many cancers it is tempting to conclude that cancer cells may take in the exosomes to supplement the amount of locally expressed miR-92a.<ref name=pmid19440243/> The result of this action would be a corresponding decrease of miR-92a in blood plasma.\n\n===Role of miR-92 in Hepatocellular Cancer===\nEvidence supporting a role for miR-92 in hepatocellular cancer (HCC) was derived from ''in situ'' hybridisation experiments of tumours.<ref name=pmid20518884/> Over expression of miR-92 was well pronounced across sex, age, virus type, clinical stage, and tumour differentiation stage, making miR-92 a potential robust biomarker for HCC.

An abnormal functioning of which can induce the GNP tumours typical of Medullablastoma. This hypothesis was arrived at by taking miRNA expression profiles of GNP-like tumour cells from mouse mutants.<ref name=pmid19196975/> There are various mouse knock out mutants that show a spontaneous development of MB within 5 months of life. They form a classic group for the study of medullablastoma and other cancers and include mice lines that are KO for [[p53]], [[PTCH1|Ptch1]], and Ink4c. Of the 26 miRNAs showing higher expression levels (in one of the mutant groups) against wild type mice, 9 of them were from the mir-17-92 cluster and its 2 paralogs. Overall signature changes across mutant groups and control groups were largely insignificant and the mir-17-92 cluster was only implicated in mutant mice that had an active SHH pathway.<ref name=pmid19196975/> These observations merited further focus on the cluster and QRT-PCR was used to measure  the expression of the oncogenic cluster in samples of MB tumours more accurately. Over expression was particularly pronounced for miR-92 and miR20a. Similarly, these trends were only present in tumours whose expression profiles revealed an activated SHH pathway.<ref name=pmid19196975/>\n\nThe implication is that miR-92 and other miRNAs from mir-17-92 drive the formation of human MB by acting upon the SHH/PTCH pathway. In further studies with mice, an inhibitor of the SHH pathway (cyclopamine drug) was sufficient to reduce proliferation of tumour cells that had been infected with a retro virus encoding mir-17-92 (plus a GFP reporter). The level of reduction in proliferation was towards background levels of normal MB tumours: as in those uninfected with the retro virus. Once again, an aberrant SHH/PTCH pathway was necessary for these observations.<ref name=pmid19196975/>\n\n===Role of miR-92 ortholog in ''Caenorhabditis elegans''===\nThe miR-92 family is evolutionally conserved microRNAs,<ref>Olive, V., Jiang, I. & He, L. mir-17-92, a cluster of miRNAs in the midst of the cancer network.

Epub 2013 May 5.</ref> Furthermore, ''mir-235'' directly represses the expression of ''[[nhr-91]]'', which is an ortholog of mammalian germ cell nuclear factor ([[GCNF]]), to keep stem cell quiescent.<ref name=\" nature 2013\" /> The expression of ''mir-235'' is regulated by the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling (IIS) pathway in respond to nutritional state. Once nutritional conditions becomes favorable, the expression of ''mir-235'' is downregulated by IIS pathway, and stem cells leave from quiescent state and resume the developmental program, such as self-renewal, migration and differentiation.<ref name=\" nature 2013\" />\n\nIn ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'', ''mir-235'' is a sole ortholog of miR-92 family. However, ''mir-235'' does not form the cluster structure and is not clear whether the biological functions have been conserved between human and ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]''.<ref name=\"PLoS ONE 2008\" />\n\n==Clinical implications==\nFrom the investigations that have been reviewed in this article we can draw some direction as to how miR-92 could have important clinical implications. Thanks to the level of diversity in miRNA expression across cancers, using them as a diagnosis and classification tool has serious potential. The modest number of miRNAs present in the genome and in specific profiling experiments allow for highly resolved patterns without overly complex data sets. As an example, a set of miRNA profiles of well differentiated cancers was used to train a decision algorithm for application on another set of poorly differentiated tumours (for which clinical diagnosis is normally established by anatomical means). Successful diagnosis of the test set was significantly increased.<ref name=pmid15944708/>\n\nApart from diagnosis and characterisation of cancers, there is also therapeutic value to the discovery of miR-92s involvement in essential cell physiology and in promoting cancer. Returning to our review of breast cancer, the isoform ER\u03b21 is well studied as having anti-proliferative effects and pro-apoptotic effects.<ref name=pmid20484043/> We discussed that miR-92 targets and down regulates ER\u03b21, and evidence suggests that miR-92 is regulated by oestrogen which is upstream of the ER\u03b21.<ref name=pmid20484043/> Evidence for this was demonstrated by growing MCF-7 cells in oestrogen depleted conditions and adding antagonists to the oestrogen receptors: [[Tamoxifen]] and E2. miR-92 was upregulated in response, suggesting that the likely oncogenic role for miR-92 in this context is inhibition of ER\u03b21 expression in the presence of oestrogen. Thus, a therapeutic strategy against breast cancer could be aimed at re-activating expression of ER\u03b21 through manipulation of miR-92 expression.<ref name=pmid20484043/>\n\nFor HCC patients (discussed in the previous section), quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated a reduction of miR-92a in the plasma against healthy blood samples.<ref name=pmid20518884/> Similarly, the over-expression of miR-92a can also be detected in human faeces in colorectal cancer patients.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yau |first1=Tung On |last2=Tang |first2=Ceen-Ming |last3=Harriss |first3=Elinor K. |last4=Dickins |first4=Benjamin |last5=Polytarchou |first5=Christos |title=Faecal microRNAs as a non-invasive tool in the diagnosis of colonic adenomas and colorectal cancer: A meta-analysis |journal=Scientific Reports |date=1 July 2019 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=9491 |doi=10.1038/s41598-019-45570-9 |pmid=31263200 |pmc=6603164 }}</ref> This bears similarities to the discoveries made by profiling leukaemia patients (also discussed in the previous section).<ref name=pmid19440243/> The expression differences in both cases was relative to miR-638 levels. miR-638 is an miRNA that seems to have a consistent presence in human blood plasma and may be physiologically necessary. This demonstrates that a decrease in the miR-92a:miR-638 ratio in human plasma may serve as a valuable diagnostic marker not only for leukaemia but also for solid tumours such as HCC.<ref name=pmid19440243/>\n\nIn respect to the Medullablastoma studies, therapeutic strategy could include using antigomirs against the oncomir-1 cluster in patients harbouring an aberrant SHH/PATCHED pathway.<ref name=pmid19196975/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = He L, Thomson JM, Hemann MT, Hernando-Monge E, Mu D, Goodson S, Powers S, Cordon-Cardo C, Lowe SW, Hannon GJ, Hammond SM | title = A microRNA polycistron as a potential human oncogene | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7043 | pages = 828\u201333 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15944707 | pmc = 4599349 | doi = 10.1038/nature03552 | bibcode = 2005Natur.435..828H | authorlink8 = Carlos Cordon-Cardo }}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Kovalchuk O, Tryndyak VP, Montgomery B, Boyko A, Kutanzi K, Zemp F, Warbritton AR, Latendresse JR, Kovalchuk I, Beland FA, Pogribny IP | title = Estrogen-induced rat breast carcinogenesis is characterized by alterations in DNA methylation, histone modifications and aberrant microRNA expression | journal = Cell Cycle | volume = 6 | issue = 16 | pages = 2010\u20138 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17700064 | doi = 10.4161/cc.6.16.4549 }}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Sempere LF, Christensen M, Silahtaroglu A, Bak M, Heath CV, Schwartz G, Wells W, Kauppinen S, Cole CN | title = Altered MicroRNA expression confined to specific epithelial cell subpopulations in breast cancer | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 67 | issue = 24 | pages = 11612\u201320 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18089790 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5019 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Rfam|id=RF00464|name=mir-92 microRNA precursor family}}\n* [http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/sequences/mirna_entry.pl?acc=MI0000093 MI0000093]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n* [https://archive.is/20121223203921/http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/sequences/mirna_entry.pl?acc=MI0000094 MI0000094]\n* [http://www.mirbase.org/search.shtml  miRBase]\n* [http://diana.imis.athena-innovation.gr/DianaTools/index.php?r=microtv4/index  mirGen database]\n* [http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do  miRanda]\n{{miRNA precursor families}}\n\n[[Category:MicroRNA]]\n[[Category:MicroRNA precursor families]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRole of miR-92 ortholog in ''Caenorhabditis elegans'':Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir-92_microRNA_precursor_family"}

It decided not to allow the construction of any additional skyscrapers in the city center, while at the same time greatly increasing the construction of skyscrapers in the east. The ban extends to an area between the coast and [[Ibn Gabirol Street]], and also between the [[Yarkon River]] and Eilat Street. It did not extend to towers already under construction or approved. One final proposed skyscraper project was approved, while dozens of others had to be scrapped. Any new buildings there will usually not be allowed to rise above six and a half stories. However, hotel towers along almost the entire beachfront will be allowed to rise up to 25 stories. According to the plan, large numbers of skyscrapers and high-rise buildings at least 18 stories tall would be built in the entire area between Ibn Gabirol Street and the eastern city limits, as part of the master plan's goal of doubling the city's office space to cement Tel Aviv as the business capital of Israel. Under the plan, \"forests\" of corporate skyscrapers will line both sides of the [[Highway 20 (Israel)|Ayalon Highway]]. Further south, skyscrapers rising up to 40 stories will be built along the old Ottoman railway between [[Neve Tzedek]] and [[Florentin, Tel Aviv|Florentine]], with the first such tower there being the [[Neve Tzedek Tower]]. Along nearby Shlavim Street, passing between Jaffa and south Tel Aviv, office buildings up to 25 stories will line both sides of the street, which will be widened to accommodate traffic from the city's southern entrance to the center.<ref>Fox, Jesse: ''Tel Aviv's skyline in 2025'' (21 May 2011)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3888492,00.html |title=No new skyscrapers in central Tel Aviv \u2013 Israel Business, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=6 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2012, it was announced that to encourage investment in the city's architecture, residential towers throughout Tel Aviv would be extended in height.

It decided not to allow the construction of any additional skyscrapers in the city center, while at the same time greatly increasing the construction of skyscrapers in the east. The ban extends to an area between the coast and [[Ibn Gabirol Street]], and also between the [[Yarkon River]] and Eilat Street. It did not extend to towers already under construction or approved. One final proposed skyscraper project was approved, while dozens of others had to be scrapped. Any new buildings there will usually not be allowed to rise above six and a half stories. However, hotel towers along almost the entire beachfront will be allowed to rise up to 25 stories. According to the plan, large numbers of skyscrapers and high-rise buildings at least 18 stories tall would be built in the entire area between Ibn Gabirol Street and the eastern city limits, as part of the master plan's goal of doubling the city's office space to cement Tel Aviv as the business capital of Israel. Under the plan, \"forests\" of corporate skyscrapers will line both sides of the [[Highway 20 (Israel)|Ayalon Highway]].
