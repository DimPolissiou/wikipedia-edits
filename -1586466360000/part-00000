The establishment of the city is attributed to [[Artaxerxes I of Persia]]. The [[Sassanid]] monument of Qadamg\u0101h is located to the south of the city , experts believe the monument was constructed during the late Sasanian dynastic era (224-651 AD), and it was a Zoroastrian shrine, probably a fire temple. Jahrom is the birthplace of [[Barbod]], who became the main lyricist and musician in the court of the great Sassanid king [[Khosrau II]] (Parviz).\n\nJahrom was [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquered by the Muslims]] in 641 or 644 after a fierce battle. \"The Valley of the Martyrs\" in west of the city was the site of this battle, which is why it is called so. As it is described in [[Fars-Nama]], Jahrom's taxes were paid to the Crown Prince during the [[Buyid]] period. In the late [[Safavid]] and early [[Zand dynasty|Zand]] periods, was the start date of planting trees in Jahrom, specially [[Arecaceae|palm]] trees.\n\nDuring the [[Qajar]] period, the ruler of this city began to build buildings and places for urban affairs, including the construction of the bazaar, as well as numerous caravanserais and the development of the city. In 1887, Mohammad Hassan Mirza Mohandes, introduced Jahrom as the largest and most prosperous city in Persia after [[Shiraz]] and [[Bushehr]]. Etemad os-Saltanah describes Jahrom in the late [[Qajar]] period a larger city than cities like [[Qom]] and [[Kashan]].<ref name=\"encyclopedia\">{{cite web | url=https://rch.ac.ir/article/Details/7739 | title=Jahrom | publisher=Islamic World Encyclopedia | accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> People of Jahrom had an important rule in [[tobacco protest]]s of 1890 and [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] of ealry 20th century. [[Abd al-Husayn Najafi Lari]] was the Islamic leader of the city in this period.\n\nJahrom also had an important role in the [[Islamic revolution of Iran]] and was one of the 11 cities with [[Martial law]] in pre-revolution protests. [[Seyyed Hossein ayatollahi]] was the Islamic leader of Jahrom in that period. A soldier killed the military governor of Jahrom on the birthday of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] on October 6, 1978. 1,200 people of Jahrom were martyred during [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]].<ref name=\"mehromah\">{{cite web | url=http://home.mehromah.ir/fun/touring-iran/4010-Urban-arranged-in-the-East-Empire-of-Ardashir.html | title=Jahrom, a city in the east of Ardeshir's empire | accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Martyrs\">{{cite web | url=https://defapress.ir/fa/news/225110/%D8%AC%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%85-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%A7-11-%D8%B4%D9%87%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%A8 | title=Jahrom county with 11 Martyrs | publisher=Defa press | accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nJahrom has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''BSh''); The average rainfall is about {{convert|285|mm|in}} per year.

The establishment of the city is attributed to [[Artaxerxes I of Persia]]. The [[Sassanid]] monument of Qadamg\u0101h is located to the south of the city , experts believe the monument was constructed during the late Sasanian dynastic era (224-651 AD), and it was a Zoroastrian shrine, probably a fire temple. Jahrom is the birthplace of [[Barbod]], who became the main lyricist and musician in the court of the great Sassanid king [[Khosrau II]] (Parviz).\n\nJahrom was [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquered by the Muslims]] in 641 or 644 after a fierce battle. \"The Valley of the Martyrs\" in west of the city was the site of this battle, which is why it is called so. As it is described in [[Fars-Nama]], Jahrom's taxes were paid to the Crown Prince during the [[Buyid]] period. In the late [[Safavid]] and early [[Zand dynasty|Zand]] periods, was the start date of planting trees in Jahrom, specially [[palm]] trees.\n\nDuring the [[Qajar]] period, the ruler of this city began to build buildings and places for urban affairs, including the construction of the bazaar, as well as numerous caravanserais and the development of the city. In 1887, Mohammad Hassan Mirza Mohandes, introduced Jahrom as the largest and most prosperous city in Persia after [[Shiraz]] and [[Bushehr]]. Etemad os-Saltanah describes Jahrom in the late [[Qajar]] period a larger city than cities like [[Qom]] and [[Kashan]].<ref name=\"encyclopedia\">{{cite web | url=https://rch.ac.ir/article/Details/7739 | title=Jahrom | publisher=Islamic World Encyclopedia | accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> People of Jahrom had an important rule in [[tobacco protest]]s of 1890 and [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] of ealry 20th century. [[Abd al-Husayn Najafi Lari]] was the Islamic leader of the city in this period.\n\nJahrom also had an important role in the [[Islamic revolution of Iran]] and was one of the 11 cities with [[Martial law]] in pre-revolution protests. [[Seyyed Hossein ayatollahi]] was the Islamic leader of Jahrom in that period. A soldier killed the military governor of Jahrom on the birthday of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] on October 6, 1978. 1,200 people of Jahrom were martyred during [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]].<ref name=\"mehromah\">{{cite web | url=http://home.mehromah.ir/fun/touring-iran/4010-Urban-arranged-in-the-East-Empire-of-Ardashir.html | title=Jahrom, a city in the east of Ardeshir's empire | accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Martyrs\">{{cite web | url=https://defapress.ir/fa/news/225110/%D8%AC%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%85-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%A7-11-%D8%B4%D9%87%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%A8 | title=Jahrom county with 11 Martyrs | publisher=Defa press | accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nJahrom has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''BSh''); The average rainfall is about {{convert|285|mm|in}} per year.

Her son, Eddie, has been arrested for the crime, despite allegedly being innocent, and so over the course of six months she works to befriend fellow maids - Rosie Falta, Carmen Luna, and Zoila Diaz - and find out everything they know about Flora. Taking a job at the Stappord house, while also working part-time for the Powells (Flora's old bosses), Marisol eventually tracks down the true culprit, Philippe Delatour, and her son is exonerated.<ref name=\"1x13\"/>\n\nThree months pass by the time of the [[Devious Maids (season 2)|second season]], and by then she has entered into a relationship with the mysterious Nicholas Deering. He quickly proposes marriage to her and they move in together, but Marisol can't quite shake there being something secretive about him... and his maid, Opal. Upon doing a whole new investigation, Marisol comes to find out that Nick is responsible for the death of Evelyn and Adrian Powell's son, Barrett.

Marisol's book is now being made into a movie, and she enters into a new relationship with head of the studio, Peter Hudson. Jesse pops back up in her life, however, and it turns out he never moved back to Seattle like he originally claimed.<ref name=\"4x01\"/> Drama strikes when Peter turns out to be Genevieve Delatour's ex-husband, and she comes to claim him back;<ref name=\"4x02\"/><ref name=\"4x03\"/> Marisol also has a brief affair with Jesse.<ref name=\"4x07\"/> Meanwhile, she also helps Rosie with solving the murder of Peri Westmore, and after that is all complete, Peter and Marisol make amends for the latter's affair, and Peter proposes marriage. She accepts, and a time jump to one year later shows them about to get married; however, Marisol doesn't make it down the aisle. The maids go to investigate and it appears she has been kidnapped.<ref name=\"4x10\"/>\n\n===Rosie Falta===\n'''Rosie Westmore''' ([[Dania Ramirez]]) originates from [[Guadalajara, Mexico]], having immigrated to the [[United States]] and takes a job for Peri and Spence Westmore as their maid. While saving money to get her son, Miguel, to America, Rosie goes about life serving the Westmores and also tending to their one-year-old son, Tucker.<ref name=\"1x01\"/> Rosie winds up entering into an affair with the unhappily married Spence, and is the first to learn that her new friend, Marisol, isn't really a maid, but undercover. While deciding to help Marisol in her investigation, Rosie also keeps hiding her and Spence's affair from Peri.<ref name=\"1x04\"/><ref name=\"1x07\">Episode 1.07 \"Taking a Message\"</ref> Spence finally decides he wishes to leave Peri and proposes to Rosie, but when Peri sneaks Miguel into America and reunites him with Rosie, she can't bring herself to hurt Mrs. Westmore in such a way.<ref name=\"1x12\"/> It's only then that Peri learns of Rosie and Spence's affair, as they're about to call it quits, and she puts in a call to immigration and has the maid arrested.<ref name=\"1x13\"/>\n\nThree months later, in the [[Devious Maids (season 2)|second season]], Rosie goes on trial and is allowed to stay in America until scheduled to seek asylum six months later. She goes to reunite with Spence, who ends his marriage with Peri, but they're forbidden to be together when Peri threatens to destroy her husband's career if the world finds out he's leaving her for the maid. Meanwhile, Rosie finds work in the dysfunctional Miller household, headed by the post-stroke patriarch Kenneth Miller.<ref name=\"2x01\"/><ref name=\"2x02\"/> She also starts seeing Kenneth's nephew, Reggie Miller, but overtime she comes to realize Reggie's been working to tear the family apart, getting wife Didi and daughter Lucinda kicked out, and is prepared to take all of Kenneth's money for himself.<ref name=\"2x04\">Episode 2.04 \"Crimes of the Heart\"</ref><ref name=\"2x08\">Episode 2.08 \"Night, Mother\"</ref><ref name=\"2x09\">Episode 2.09 \"The Visit\"</ref> Rosie works to stop Reggie and reunite the Millers, and ends up reuniting with Spence. They get married, but when exiting the church, Rosie is shot by Ty McKay and winds up in a coma for the next four months.<ref name=\"2x12\"/><ref name=\"2x13\"/>\n\nBringing the show into the [[Devious Maids (season 3)|third season]], Rosie finally wakes up from her coma and goes to be with Spence, finally... until her supposedly deceased husband, Ernesto Falta, returns to the picture. Apparently he faked his death and has spent the last five years with the Gaviota Cartel.<ref name=\"3x01\"/><ref name=\"3x03\"/> Rosie fights her feelings for both Spence and Ernesto, but ends up choosing Ernesto. In the meantime she finds work in the Stappord house, but starts to notice something going on with their daughter, Katy.<ref name=\"3x06\"/> Meanwhile, Ernesto turns out to have been ''working'' for the cartel, and he tries to kidnap Katy, really named Violeta, who the cartel has been after for quite sometime.<ref name=\"3x11\"/> Rosie finds out the truth and condemns her for it, and he decides to do the right thing and leave to settle things once and for all with the cartel, in order to ensure Rosie and Miguel's safety. This means he is stepping aside for her to be with Spence, but when she leaves to do so, she learns he has been beaten to the point of losing his memory of the last three years... giving Peri the perfect opportunity to return and brainwash her ex-husband against their former maid.<ref name=\"3x12\"/><ref name=\"3x13\"/>\n\nSix months later, in the [[Devious Maids (season 4)|fourth season]], Rosie is now working for Genevieve Delatour, and still longs to be with Spence, who has gotten back together with Peri.

Once she is arrested, Spence is exonerated, and Rosie reveals she is pregnant from one of their conjugal visits. A year passes and Rosie's baby is born, and she attends Marisol's wedding where she and the other maids find that Marisol has been kidnapped.<ref name=\"4x10\"/>\n\n===Carmen Luna===\n'''Carmen Luna''' ([[Roselyn Sanchez]]) longs to be a famous singer, which is why she takes the job of being a maid for popstar Alejandro Rubio. While trying to get close to him in hopes he'll make her a star, she also has to battle the Russian housekeeper, Odessa. Meanwhile, Sam Alexander, the butler, is also crushing hard on Carmen, despite her not necessarily reciprocating his feelings... or so she thought.<ref name=\"1x01\"/><ref name=\"1x06\">Episode 1.06 \"Walking the Dog\"</ref> While they go through obstacles, Carmen comes to realize that she wants to be with Sam and they decide to move in together. However, word gets out that Alejandro is gay, and so his agents decide that he needs to marry a woman to convince the press otherwise; they make a deal with Carmen that if she marries Alejandro they'll make her a star, but that means breaking off her relationship with Sam. She chooses stardom.<ref name=\"1x12\"/><ref name=\"1x13\"/>\n\nIn the [[Devious Maids (season 2)|second season]], Carmen lives a life of luxury as Alejandro's glamorous fianc\u00e9e, but this is cut short when he is shot dead by a band of robbers stealing from the rich in [[Beverly Hills]].<ref name=\"2x02\"/> Carmen and Odessa mourn his loss, and from there Carmen is forced to find work elsewhere, that being in the home of Rosie's former boss, Spence Westmore.<ref name=\"2x03\">Episode 2.03 \"Dangerous Liaisons\"</ref><ref name=\"2x04\"/> She becomes his new live-in maid, just as his nephew Ty McKay comes for an extensive stay. As it turns out, he's one of the robbers from the gang that killed Alejandro, not that Carmen knows that, and Ty starts to develop an unhealthy obsession for the maid. Once it becomes quite clear how mentally unstable he is, Spence is forced to make him leave as Carmen refuses to be anywhere near him.<ref name=\"2x05\">Episode 2.05 \"The Bad Seed\"</ref><ref name=\"2x08\"/> Spence ends up firing Carmen though, when he and Rosie are about to get married, and at a bar she meets Sebastien, who she sleeps with after he promises to introduce her to the Head of Talent for Discerna Records... then he finds out that it's really his wife. Carmen attends Rosie's wedding, but notices Ty just as he is about to drive and shoot it up.<ref name=\"2x13\"/>\n\nFour months pass by the time of the [[Devious Maids (season 3)|third season]], and Carmen is in an ongoing affair with Sebastien.<ref name=\"3x01\"/> Marisol, who has started up her own maid placement agency, sets Carmen up with a job for Evelyn and Adrian Powell, the latter of which she becomes the dominatrix of. With Adrian having learned of Carmen's affair with Sebastien, who is acting as his and his wife's realtor, he threatens to go to Sebastien's wife if they do not continue their S&M sessions.<ref name=\"3x02\"/><ref name=\"3x04\">Episode 3.04 \"Since You Went Away\"</ref> It's all put to a stop when Carmen finally goes to Evelyn though, and she finally gets the time to meet Sebastien's wife, Jacklyn, about making her a true star. Jacklyn becomes quite the fan of Carmen, and even interested in her in a more romantic way, but this is all cut short when she becomes aware of her affair with Sebastien.<ref name=\"3x06\"/><ref name=\"3x07\">Episode 3.07 \"The Turning Point\"</ref><ref name=\"3x08\">Episode 3.08 \"Cries and Whispers\"</ref><ref name=\"3x09\"/> To punish the maid, she holds her under an exclusive contract to prevent her from making music anywhere else.<ref name=\"3x10\">Episode 3.10 \"Whiplash\"</ref> Carmen's relationship winds up not even being worth it though, as it turns out Sebastien killed Louie Becker and Blanca Alvarez, and he winds up dying in the explosion of the Powell mansion.<ref name=\"3x13\"/>\n\nSix months later, in the [[Devious Maids (season 4)|fourth season]], Carmen continues to work for the Powells when she finds herself being visited by Daniela Mercado, the daughter she gave up years before. Initially Daniela believes the two of them are cousins, and Carmen chooses to keep it that way all throughout her stay in Beverly Hills, but she soon finds out the truth when Carmen argues over it with Danni's adoptive mother, Josefina.<ref name=\"4x01\"/><ref name=\"4x04\"/> Carmen decides to push Danni away, however, and she decides to go on the hunt for her birth father instead.<ref name=\"4x05\"/> Mad at Carmen though, she returns claiming that he - Lucas - is dead, when in reality he is very much alive and wishes to see his high school lover.<ref name=\"4x08\"/> Carmen and Danni wind up becoming close again when Carmen saves her from being drugged and raped by Hugh Metzger, and the two decide to start their relationship over, but Carmen remains oblivious to the truth regarding Lucas. A year passes though, and Carmen attends Marisol's wedding where she and the other maids find that Marisol has been kidnapped.<ref name=\"4x10\"/>\n\n===Zoila Diaz===\n'''Zoila Diaz''' ([[Judy Reyes]]) is the maid of Genevieve Delatour, and mother of the teenaged Valentina. While her whole world revolves around her daughter's success, this means that she must prevent her from engaging in a relationship with Genevieve's son, Remi, as Zoila believes rich boys never fall for the help.<ref name=\"1x01\"/> This is because years ago Zoila had a relationship with Genevieve's brother, Henri, that didn't go so well, and when Valentina confronts her mother over this, she finally understands that she must let her daughter make her own decisions.<ref name=\"1x04\"/> Zoila stands by as Genevieve starts to go through a financial crisis and Valentina builds a relationship with Remi.<ref name=\"1x06\"/><ref name=\"1x10\"/> What she does not support, however, is Valentina giving up her dream to go to Africa with Remi for a year. She convinces him to go without her, and to leave a note Zoila has previously already written.<ref name=\"1x12\"/> Valentina ends up finding out the truth though, and leaves for Africa without telling her mother. Meanwhile, Genevieve gets back together with her ex-husband, Philippe Delatour, something that goes unblessed by Zoila. The maid winds up taking part in unmasking him as having killed Flora Hernandez.<ref name=\"1x11\"/><ref name=\"1x13\"/>\n\nBy the [[Devious Maids (season 2)|second season]], three months have passed, and Zoila struggles to get in touch with Valentina. She soon returns from Africa though, having broken things off with Remi, and the two wind up making amends as Zoila decides to finally quit meddling in her life.<ref name=\"2x01\"/><ref name=\"2x05\"/> Pablo, Zoila's husband, has previously left her for this, sending Zoila into the arms of chef Javier Mendoza.<ref name=\"2x02\"/><ref name=\"2x06\">Episode 2.06 \"Private Lives\"</ref> As the two fall hard and fast for one another, their relationship goes interrupted when Pablo returns to Zoila's life when Valentina gets into some trouble with the law. As the two start to spend more time together they wind up having an affair, and Zoila is left to choose which man she wishes to be with. She confesses the affair to Javier, but chooses Pablo... until she finds out he only wanted her back because he was homeless. She reconsiders her decision and return to Javier, but then finds out she's pregnant and doesn't know who the father is.<ref name=\"2x11\">Episode 2.11 \"You Can't Take It With You\"</ref><ref name=\"2x12\"/><ref name=\"2x13\"/>\n\nFour months later, in the [[Devious Maids (season 3)|third season]], Zoila gets through mourning the death of Pablo, who was shot dead at Rosie's wedding, and is now more focused on revealing her pregnancy and confessing to whether or not the baby is his. Genevieve convinces her to pass it off as his, but when Zoila and Javier prepare to get married, she tells him the truth and he leaves her at the altar.<ref name=\"3x01\"/><ref name=\"3x03\"/> This makes way for Zoila and Genevieve to start building on their own relationship, relying on one another, that is, until Genevieve begins seeing Dr. Christopher Neff, who frowns upon his girlfriend's closeness with the help. He works to sabotage their friendship, only for Genevieve to choose Zoila over him in the end.<ref name=\"3x04\"/><ref name=\"3x12\"/> Zoila and Genevieve realize they do need to work on their relationship though, but now is not the time as Zoila goes into labor. Complications occur, however, and Genevieve is left to decide whom to prioritize: Zoila or her baby.<ref name=\"3x13\"/>\n\nSix months pass, into the [[Devious Maids (season 4)|fourth season]], and it's revealed Genevieve chose to prioritize Zoila and that she lost her baby in the hospital. Zoila is unable to forgive Genevieve, and winds up quitting, taking a job for an away fashion executive instead. As she'll be gone for six months though, Zoila starts to pass herself off as the owner of the house, which gets her into a relationship with a man named Kyle.<ref name=\"4x01\"/> This doesn't go approved by his mother Frances though, who works to sabotage it.<ref name=\"4x02\"/> Zoila also befriends Adrian Powell to fill the void Genevieve has left, but Zoila's fantasy starts to die down and she slowly breaks things off with Kyle.<ref name=\"4x04\"/><ref name=\"4x07\"/> This is just as her employer, Fiona, is returning home though.<ref name=\"4x08\"/> Zoila plays a part in helping Rosie solve Peri Westmore's murder, as Kyle and Frances run a cult known as \"The Circle\" that has something to do with it, and Zoila quits her job for Fiona and returns to Genevieve. The two have made amends and decide to not meddle in each other's lives, which prevents Zoila from saying anything when she finds her boss has begun dating a woman named Lori. A year passes though, and Zoila attends Marisol's wedding, where she and Adrian exchange questionable glances. She and the other maids soon find that Marisol has been kidnapped.<ref name=\"4x09\"/><ref name=\"4x10\"/>\n\n===Valentina Diaz===\n'''Valentina Diaz''' ([[Edy Ganem]]) is one of the maids of Genevieve Delatour, and the daughter of Zoila Diaz. She longs for the love of Genevieve's son, Remi, and attempts to form a relationship with him to her mother's dismay. Zoila works to prevent Valentina from getting close to him, as she believes rich boys never fall for the help, but after stepping aside she is proven wrong.
