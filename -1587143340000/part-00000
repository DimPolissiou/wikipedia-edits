In 1931, [[AS 23 Sofia|AS-23]] won their first Bulgarian championship and The Tsar's Cup, followed by another Tsar's Cup in 1941. The club's stadium (completed in 1938) was named Athletic Park and was situated where the [[Bulgarian Army Stadium]] now resides.\n\nOn 9 November 1944, with the support of Mihail Mihaylov, an accountant at the Ministry of War and a patron of Shipka Sofia, a unifying agreement was signed, merging [[AS 23 Sofia|AS-23]], ''Shipka'', and ''Spartak'' (Poduene) to form [[Chavdar Sofia]]. Gen. [[Vladimir Stoychev]] from [[AS 23 Sofia|AS-23]], who at the time was fighting on the front in World War II, was appointed (by [[telegram]]) as the new club's chairman.

Looking for ways to stop the club's decline, CDV's administrators sought to merge it with another club. In May 1948, an agreement was reached between CDV and [[FC Septemvri Sofia|Septemvri Sofia]] (which had already earned a place in the play-offs) for uniting the clubs under the name \"Septemvri pri CDV\" (Septemvri at CDV). The contract was signed on 5 May 1948, which is officially considered the club's date of foundation.\n\nThe club's played its first official match on 19 May 1948 against [[PFC Slavia Sofia|Slavia Sofia]] at Yunak Stadium, a 1\u20131 draw. Septemvri pri CDV eliminated Aprilov ([[Gabrovo]]) and [[PFC Spartak 1918|Spartak Varna]] en route to the final, where it faced [[PFC Levski Sofia|Levski Sofia]], losing 1\u20132 in the first leg. The decisive second match occurred on 9 September 1948. Septemvri pri CDV's lineup consisted of: Stefan Gerenski, Borislav Futekov, [[Manol Manolov]], Dimitar Cvetkov, Nikola Aleksiev, Nako Chakmakov (captain), [[Dimitar Milanov]], Stoyne Minev, [[Stefan Bozhkov]], Nikola Bozhilov and Kiril Bogdanov. The score was 3\u20133 on aggregate, as Septemvri pri CDV led 2\u20131 near the end of regulation time, when a last-minute goal by Nako Chakmakov gave the club its first ever title.\n\nIn 1950, the word \"''Narodna''\" (\"Peoples\" in English) was added to the name of the Central House of the Troops, changing it to '''Central House of the People's Troops''' (\"Centralen Dom na Narodnata Voiska\" in English), or C.D.N.V. for short, also effectively changing the club's name. The following two years, C.D.N.V. won two consecutive titles. In 1951, the Army club clinched their first double. In [[A PFG 1953|1953]], the club was again renamed by the authorities, this time to '''Otbor na Sofiyskiya Garnizon''' (\"Team of the Sofia Garrison\"), and most of the key players were illegally transferred out. The title was lost undeservedly.\n\nThe following year, the club was renamed to '''CDNA''' ('''Central House of the People's Army''), and the years between 1954 and 1962 marked one of the most successful periods for ''the Reds'', who won nine consecutive titles (an unprecedented achievement in Bulgarian football to this day) and, in 1956, took part in the second installment of the newly created [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] competition.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1956/clubs/club=50076/matches/index.html UEFA Champions League 1956/57&nbsp;\u2013 History&nbsp;\u2013 CSKA Sofia] ''UEFA.com'' Retrieved 22 December 2011.</ref>\n\n=== 1960s ===\nIn 1962, CDNA was united with DSO Cherveno Zname to form '''CSKA Cherveno Zname''' (\"CSKA Red Flag\"). The Central House of the People's Troops ceased its affiliation with the club, which was taken over by the Ministry of People's Defense. CSKA finished third after [[FC Spartak Plovdiv|Spartak Plovdiv]] and [[PFC Botev Plovdiv|Botev Plovdiv]] in the [[A PFG 1962-63|1962\u201363 season]]. The [[1963\u201364 A PFG|following season]], CSKA had its worst performance in the [[A PFG|Bulgarian championship]] to date, finishing 11th in the final table, only three points from relegation. This led to the sacking of legendary coach [[Krum Milev]] after 16 years. CSKA did not recapture the title until [[1965\u201366 A PFG|1966]]. However, during the [[1966\u201367 A PFG|1966\u201367 season]], CSKA recorded its first major international achievement after reaching the semi-finals of the [[1966\u201367 European Cup|European Cup]] for the first time, where they faced Italian giants [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]]. After two hard-fought 1\u20131 draws, a third decisive match was played, which CSKA lost 0\u20131.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1966/clubs/club=50076/matches/index.html UEFA Champions League 1966/67&nbsp;\u2013 History&nbsp;\u2013 CSKA Sofia] ''UEFA.com'' Retrieved 22 December 2011.</ref>\n\nThe next two seasons were unmemorable for the ''Army Men'', as they finished in fifth and second place respectively. In 1968, CSKA underwent another merger, joining with [[FC Septemvri Sofia|Septemvri Sofia]] and taking the name '''CSKA Septemvriysko Zname''' (\"CSKA September Flag\"). The club clinched the title in [[1968\u201369 A PFG|1969]] with the help of the recent acquisition of [[Petar Zhekov]], who would go on to become the top Bulgarian goalscorer of all time&nbsp;\u2013 a record he still holds today.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:CSKA Sofia team 1973.jpg|thumb|right|230px|CSKA Sofia in 1973]]\nThe 1970s are widely considered the period when CSKA made its name on the European stage.

In the semi-final, the ''Reds'' again faced Bayern Munich. The first leg was held in Sofia and started with a full dominance over Bayern, as by the 16th minute, CSKA were leading 3\u20130 in front of 85,000 jubilant spectators who saw the European final in their dreams. But the final result was 4\u20133 for CSKA.

The match was marked by many questionable referee decisions and saw several brutal fights, including an assault on a referee by some of Levski's players. CSKA won the match 2\u20131, even though they had missed a penalty when the score was 2\u20130. By decree of the Central Committee of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]], both teams were disbanded and re-founded under new management. CSKA was renamed '''Sredets''' while Levski was renamed ''Vitosha''. Several players were banned from participating in official matches for varying periods of time, including [[Hristo Stoichkov]] and [[Kostadin Yanchev]] from CSKA. One year later, the committee's decision was reversed and the players were reinstated.\n\nAs Sredets, the club finished in fourth place in the [[1985\u201386 A PFG|1985\u201386 season]]. In 1987, the club was renamed '''CFKA Sredets''' (\"Central Football Club of the Army Sredets\"), and the following three years were marked by a formidable performance, even as [[FC Septemvri Sofia|Septemvri Sofia]] ended their 20-year partnership with CFKA in 1988 and became an independent club again. Coached by [[Dimitar Penev]], CFKA won the title in 1987 and 1989 and reached the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] semi-finals against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in 1989. In reaching this stage, CFKA had eliminated [[Roda JC Kerkrade|Roda JC]] after penalty kicks following a 2\u20131 win at home and a 1\u20132 loss away. Barcelona, coached by former Dutch international [[Johan Cruyff]], won both matches (4\u20132 in [[Barcelona]] and 2\u20131 in Sofia) and CFKA were eliminated, but Cruyff did notice the talent of Hristo Stoichkov and decided to bring him to Barcelona the following year, effectively launching Stoichkov's international career.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThe decade, immediately following the [[fall of communism]], brought turbulent changes to Bulgarian football, and the club was not spared. The  '''CSKA''' name was restored starting with the [[1989\u201390 A PFG|1989\u201390 season]] and they won the title again. In March 1991, former footballer and administrator [[Valentin Mihov]] was chosen as president of CSKA. The club bought some of the most talented Bulgarian players, including [[Yordan Letchkov]], [[Ivaylo Andonov]] and [[Stoycho Stoilov]], among others. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defense concluded their affiliation with the club. Despite the uncertainty and the numerous problems that followed, CSKA won the title again in 1992. They were later eliminated in the first round of the [[1992\u201393 UEFA Champions League]] by [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]] after losing 1\u20133 in [[Vienna]] and winning 3\u20132 in Sofia.\n\nIn the meantime, [[Valentin Mihov]] was appointed president of the [[Bulgarian Football Union]] and Petar Kalpakchiev was chosen to replace him at the helm of CSKA. However, Kalpakchiev wrangled with the club's administration over their decisions to replace several coaches, one of which was [[Gjoko Had\u017eievski]], considered to be leading the club in the right direction, and eventually he was fired. The owner of the [[Multigroup]] conglomerate, [[Iliya Pavlov]], took over as president, but ultimately his sponsorship proved insufficient to overcome the club's ineffective management. Five coaches were changed in just one season, with Tsvetan Yonchev being coach for just one day. In Europe, CSKA nevertheless defeated [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] 3\u20132 in the first round of the [[1994\u201395 UEFA Cup]], but the result was annulled by [[UEFA]] because of the delayed player-indexing of forward [[Petar Mihtarski]], and Juventus were awarded a 3\u20130 victory by default. In the second leg in [[Turin]], CSKA succumbed to a 5\u20131 defeat.\n\nIn the summer of 1995, CSKA made a strong selection and eventually the club included half of the youth national football team of Bulgaria. [[Plamen Markov]] was appointed head coach, but after a disappointing first half of the season, he was replaced by [[Georgi Vasilev (footballer, born 1946)|Georgi Vasilev]], who had previously won three Bulgarian titles (one with [[FC Etar Veliko Tarnovo|Etar Veliko Tarnovo]] and two with Levski Sofia). Vasilev managed to win a double with CSKA for the [[1996\u201397 A PFG|1996\u201397 season]], entering the second qualifying round of the Champions League against [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]]. After a dramatic 3\u20133 in [[Bucharest]], CSKA fell 0\u20132 at home. Vasilev was unexpectedly released from the club at the beginning of the second half of the [[1996\u201397 A PFG|1997\u201398 season]] after a 3\u20130 win over [[PFC Spartak Pleven|Spartak Pleven]]. Coach [[Petar Zehtinski]] took his place. That year, the club saw the return of Hristo Stoichkov, [[Emil Kostadinov]] and [[Trifon Ivanov]], but the three of them challenged each other for the captain's band. Stoichkov played in only four matches and left CSKA right before the derby with Levski to play for a club in Saudi Arabia. After the end of the season, Ivanov also left the club. CSKA finished the season in third place.\n\nIn the summer of 1998, Dimitar Penev took the lead as coach for a second time. CSKA reached the second round of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], and won the Bulgarian Cup, but disappointed in the domestic league, finishing in fifth place in [[1998\u201399 A PFG|1999]]. That season, the young talents of [[Martin Petrov]], [[Stilian Petrov]], [[Dimitar Berbatov]] and [[Vladimir Manchev]] started to play a bigger role in the team. There were problems with player-indexing due to some unpaid obligations to [[PFC Naftex Burgas|Neftochimik]]. In the domestic championship, CSKA had only 16 players registered for the [[1999\u20132000 A PFG|1999\u20132000 season]] and some un-indexed players took part in official UEFA games. Consequently, at the shareholders meeting at the end of 1999, the club ownership was transferred to businessman Vasil Bozhkov, who became majority owner.\n\n=== 2000s ===\nAfter the first two fixtures in the spring of 2000, Dimitar Penev was relieved as coach because of the consecutive losses and in his place was appointed [[Georgi Dimitrov (footballer born 1959)|Georgi Dimitrov&nbsp;\u2013 Jacky]], who was later replaced by [[Spas Dzhevizov]]. After a 1\u20131 draw with [[PFC Pirin Blagoevgrad (1922)|Pirin]] at [[Bulgarian Army Stadium]], Dzhevizov handed in his resignation and [[Aleksandar Stankov (manager)|Aleksandar Stankov]] took his place. Even though at times CSKA had fallen as far as nine points behind league leaders Levski, the club shortened the difference to only two points before the decisive match for the title at [[Georgi Asparuhov Stadium]]. CSKA dominated Levski for most of the match, as Dimitar Berbatov made several serious misses, but a last-minute goal from [[Georgi Ivanov (footballer, born 1976)|Georgi Ivanov]] secured the title for Levski. In the summer of 2000, the Italian Enrico Catuzzi was retained as head coach, who managed to revive the team. However, even though the ''Army Men'' played attractive matches under his leadership, Catuzzi resigned in the winter, citing family problems. [[Aleksandar Stankov (manager)|Aleksandar Stankov]] was appointed as coach again, but was replaced by Catuzzi again after two losses from Litex for the cup and the championship. ''The Reds'' finished second, seven points behind Levski.\n\nTo start the [[2001\u201302 A PFG|2001\u201302 season]], CSKA's head coach was [[Asparuh Nikodimov]], however he would be fired during the winter break, as CSKA was situated two points behind Levski. He was replaced by another Italian, [[Luigi Simoni]]. Simoni failed to make CSKA champions as the club finished third and lost the [[Bulgarian Cup]] final to Levski. Simoni left at the end of the season.\n\nIn the summer of 2002, former player Stoycho Mladenov was appointed as head coach. With him, the team set a record with 13 consecutive wins in 13 matches in the Bulgarian Championship and CSKA became champions for the first time since 1997. However, Mladenov was fired the following season after losing to [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] in the qualifying rounds of the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League]] and after giving a less than impressive performance in the first round of the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], where the club lost on penalty kicks to [[FC Torpedo Moscow|Torpedo Moscow]]. Immediately after, two of the new arrivals, [[L\u00e9o Lima]] and [[Rodrigo de Souza Cardoso|Rodrigo Sousa]], purchased for 3 million dollars the year before, left the club on the grounds they had not received two monthly salaries. [[FIFA]] decided they had the right to leave and that CSKA had to pay them and return the players to their former club, [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]]. Alexander Stankov was temporarily appointed as head coach until the winter break, when [[Ferario Spasov]] officially took over the position. In the end of 2004, Spasov was replaced by Serbian coach [[Miodrag Je\u0161i\u0107]], despite the team finishing as champions in the league. Notwithstanding the club's selection issues, CSKA won their record 30th domestic title in 2005.\n\nFor the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League]], after eliminating [[KF Tirana|Tirana]] in the second qualifying round, CSKA were paired against reigning European champions Liverpool. The club lost 1\u20133 in the first match in Sofia, but surprisingly won the second leg 1\u20130 away at [[Anfield]], though CSKA was still eliminated on aggregate.<ref>[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=51536 CSKA Claim Amazing 1\u20130 over Liverpool] ''Novinite.com'' 23 August 2005.

During the winter break of the [[2005\u201306 A PFG|2005\u201306 season]], the club was in first position, seven points ahead of Levski. However, during the spring, CSKA lost the seven-point advantage and ultimately finished second, three points behind Levski. Club president Vasil Bozhkov blamed head coach Miodrag Je\u0161i\u0107 for the failure to capture the title and fired him, while some supporters blamed Bozhkov instead.\n\nFormer CSKA head coach Plamen Markov was appointed in Je\u0161i\u0107's place. Bozhkov then announced that he would restrict the finances of the club and that during the upcoming season CSKA will not be aiming at the title. In December 2006, Bozhkov sold the club to Indian steel tycoon and owner of [[Kremikovtzi AD]], [[Pramod Mittal]], brother of [[ArcelorMittal]]'s [[Lakshmi Mittal]]. Former Bulgarian politician [[Aleksandar Tomov (politician)|Aleksandar Tomov]] became president of the club and assured the supporters that CSKA would, in fact, be aiming at both the championship and the cup. After two draws in the beginning of the spring half of [[2006\u201307 A PFG|2006\u201307]], CSKA found themselves six points behind Levski. As a result, Plamen Markov was replaced by Stoycho Mladenov, who returned to lead the club after three-and-a-half years. CSKA finished second.\n\nDuring the beginning of the [[2007\u201308 A PFG|2007\u201308]] season, CSKA purchased players for more than \u20ac2&nbsp;million. The team was unluckily eliminated from the [[2007\u201308 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] in the first round by French side [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]] after a 96th-minute goal from [[Andr\u00e9-Pierre Gignac]] in the second leg for 1\u20131. CSKA was also eliminated from the [[Bulgarian Cup]] in the round of 16 by Lokomotiv Plovdiv. The match was engulfed in a scandal because of three CSKA players who at the time were on loan at Lokomotiv ([[Stoyko Sakaliev]], [[Aleksandar Branekov]] and [[Ivan Ivanov (footballer)|Ivan Ivanov]]). The players had clauses in their contracts restricting them from playing matches against CSKA, but Lokomotiv's management used the players anyway. At the end of the season, the ''Army Men'' secured the title in advance, finishing 16 points ahead of second-placed rivals Levski without losing a match from 30 championship matches. On 5 May 2008, the club marked its 60th anniversary with big celebrations organized by the management. An alley of fame was built, comprising the names of the most successful current and former players of CSKA. On 24 May 2008, an exhibition match was played between the current squad and a mixed team of Bulgarian and foreign football stars. The mixed team was coached by former [[Germany national football team|German international]] [[Lothar Matth\u00e4us]], who was a special guest for the anniversary celebrations. The match ended 6\u20136.\n\nIn June 2008, only days after CSKA won its 31st title, UEFA notified the [[Bulgarian Football Union]] (BFU) that the club would not receive a license for participating in the [[2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League]] because of unpaid obligations.<ref>[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=93746 Bulgaria FC CSKA Without License, Out of Champions' League] ''Novinite.com'' 3 June 2008.

The future of CSKA looked grim, its status as a professional club hanging in the balance. In the midst of the crisis, Dimitar Penev was given the head coach's job for the third time and burdened with the task of saving the club. With almost all senior players gone, Penev was left to rely on members of the CSKA youth squad.

His place was taken by the relatively unknown Macedonian manager [[Gjore Jovanovski]], who kept his job for just three months before being replaced by his assistant [[Milen Radukanov]]. Under Radukanov, CSKA won the [[2011 Bulgarian Cup Final|2011 Bulgarian Cup]] and the [[Bulgarian Super Cup|Bulgarian SuperCup]], beating league champions Litex Lovech 3\u20131.\n\nCSKA started 2011\u201312 with eight-straight league victories, but after a 1\u20132 defeat against Slavia Sofia and a 0\u20130 draw against [[PFC Cherno More Varna|Cherno More Varna]], Radukanov was unexpectedly fired by chairman Dimitar Borisov.

While the first leg in Slovenia ended in a 0\u20130 draw, a 1\u20131 tie at home eliminated the ''Reds'' from the [[2012\u201313 UEFA Europa League]] in the second qualifying round. The start of the domestic championship was unimpressive as well&nbsp;\u2013- a 0\u20131 loss to Litex, in which the club had no right to use its new signings due to administrative restrictions. However, in the middle of the autumn half of the season, CSKA achieved some significant wins, defeating Levski 1\u20130 in the Eternal Derby and eliminating Ludogorets Razgrad in the round of 32 of the Bulgarian Cup.\n\nIn late December 2012, head coach Stoycho Mladenov was abruptly fired by the club owners for \"disciplinary\" reasons, and Miodrag Je\u0161i\u0107 was appointed in his place. During the winter transfer window, CSKA made several signings, such as Bulgarian internationals [[Martin Kamburov]] and [[Spas Delev]], in addition to South-American players [[M\u00e1rcio de Souza Greg\u00f3rio J\u00fanior|Marcinho]] and [[Ignacio Lores Varela|Ignacio Varela]]. After managing the team for only two matches in the spring, Je\u0161i\u0107 was sacked and replaced by fan favourite Milen Radukanov, with whom the club managed to finish the season with the bronze medals.\n\nIn June 2013, former [[FIFA Ballon d'Or]] winner Hristo Stoichkov was released from Litex Lovech to replace Radukanov on the bench, but the poor financial condition of the club forced him to leave shortly after his arrival without even having signed a contract.

In 1931, [[AS 23 Sofia|AS-23]] won their first Bulgarian championship and The Tsar's Cup, followed by another Tsar's Cup in 1941. The club's stadium (completed in 1938) was named Athletic Park and was situated where the [[Bulgarian Army Stadium]] now resides.\n\nOn 9 November 1944, with the support of Mihail Mihaylov, an accountant at the Ministry of War and a patron of Shipka Sofia, a unifying agreement was signed, merging [[AS 23 Sofia|AS-23]], ''Shipka'', and ''Spartak'' (Poduene) to form [[Chavdar Sofia]]. Gen. [[Vladimir Stoychev]] from [[AS 23 Sofia|AS-23]], who at the time was fighting on the front in World War II, was appointed (by [[telegram]]) as the new club's chairman.

Looking for ways to stop the club's decline, CDV's administrators sought to merge it with another club. In May 1948, an agreement was reached between CDV and [[FC Septemvri Sofia|Septemvri Sofia]] (which had already earned a place in the play-offs) for uniting the clubs under the name \"Septemvri pri CDV\" (Septemvri at CDV). The contract was signed on 5 May 1948, which is officially considered the club's date of foundation.\n\nThe club's played its first official match on 19 May 1948 against [[PFC Slavia Sofia|Slavia Sofia]] at Yunak Stadium, a 1\u20131 draw. Septemvri pri CDV eliminated Aprilov ([[Gabrovo]]) and [[PFC Spartak 1918|Spartak Varna]] en route to the final, where it faced [[PFC Levski Sofia|Levski Sofia]], losing 1\u20132 in the first leg. The decisive second match occurred on 9 September 1948. Septemvri pri CDV's lineup consisted of: Stefan Gerenski, Borislav Futekov, [[Manol Manolov]], Dimitar Cvetkov, Nikola Aleksiev, Nako Chakmakov (captain), [[Dimitar Milanov]], Stoyne Minev, [[Stefan Bozhkov]], Nikola Bozhilov and Kiril Bogdanov. The score was 3\u20133 on aggregate, as Septemvri pri CDV led 2\u20131 near the end of regulation time, when a last-minute goal by Nako Chakmakov gave the club its first ever title.\n\nIn 1950, the word \"''Narodna''\" (\"Peoples\" in English) was added to the name of the Central House of the Troops, changing it to '''Central House of the People's Troops''' (\"Centralen Dom na Narodnata Voiska\" in English), or C.D.N.V. for short, also effectively changing the club's name. The following two years, C.D.N.V. won two consecutive titles. In 1951, the Army club clinched their first double. In [[A PFG 1953|1953]], the club was again renamed by the authorities, this time to '''Otbor na Sofiyskiya Garnizon''' (\"Team of the Sofia Garrison\"), and most of the key players were illegally transferred out. The title was lost undeservedly.\n\nThe following year, the club was renamed to '''CDNA''' ('''Central House of the People's Army''), and the years between 1954 and 1962 marked one of the most successful periods for ''the Reds'', who won nine consecutive titles (an unprecedented achievement in Bulgarian football to this day) and, in 1956, took part in the second installment of the newly created [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] competition.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1956/clubs/club=50076/matches/index.html UEFA Champions League 1956/57&nbsp;\u2013 History&nbsp;\u2013 CSKA Sofia] ''UEFA.com'' Retrieved 22 December 2011.</ref>\n\n=== 1960s ===\nIn 1962, CDNA was united with DSO Cherveno Zname to form '''CSKA Cherveno Zname''' (\"CSKA Red Flag\").

In Munich, the club suffered a 4\u20130 defeat, ending what is still the deepest run by a Bulgarian side in the European Cup or UEFA Champions League.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1981/clubs/club=50076/matches/index.html UEFA Champions League 1981/82&nbsp;\u2013 History&nbsp;\u2013 CSKA Sofia] ''UEFA.com'' Retrieved 22 December 2011.</ref> In the domestic league, CSKA did not let go of the title until the [[1984\u201385 A PFG|1984\u201385 season]], where they finished second behind arch-rivals Levski Sofia, but still managed to reach the [[Bulgarian Cup]] final.\n\nOn 18 June 1985, the final for the Bulgarian Cup was held at the [[Vasil Levski National Stadium]] between CSKA and Levski Sofia. The match was marked by many questionable referee decisions and saw several brutal fights, including an assault on a referee by some of Levski's players. CSKA won the match 2\u20131, even though they had missed a penalty when the score was 2\u20130. By decree of the Central Committee of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]], both teams were disbanded and re-founded under new management. CSKA was renamed '''Sredets''' while Levski was renamed ''Vitosha''. Several players were banned from participating in official matches for varying periods of time, including [[Hristo Stoichkov]] and [[Kostadin Yanchev]] from CSKA. One year later, the committee's decision was reversed and the players were reinstated.\n\nAs Sredets, the club finished in fourth place in the [[1985\u201386 A PFG|1985\u201386 season]]. In 1987, the club was renamed '''CFKA Sredets''' (\"Central Football Club of the Army Sredets\"), and the following three years were marked by a formidable performance, even as [[FC Septemvri Sofia|Septemvri Sofia]] ended their 20-year partnership with CFKA in 1988 and became an independent club again. Coached by [[Dimitar Penev]], CFKA won the title in 1987 and 1989 and reached the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] semi-finals against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in 1989. In reaching this stage, CFKA had eliminated [[Roda JC Kerkrade|Roda JC]] after penalty kicks following a 2\u20131 win at home and a 1\u20132 loss away. Barcelona, coached by former Dutch international [[Johan Cruyff]], won both matches (4\u20132 in [[Barcelona]] and 2\u20131 in Sofia) and CFKA were eliminated, but Cruyff did notice the talent of Hristo Stoichkov and decided to bring him to Barcelona the following year, effectively launching Stoichkov's international career.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThe decade, immediately following the [[fall of communism]], brought turbulent changes to Bulgarian football, and the club was not spared. The  '''CSKA''' name was restored starting with the [[1989\u201390 A PFG|1989\u201390 season]] and they won the title again. In March 1991, former footballer and administrator [[Valentin Mihov]] was chosen as president of CSKA. The club bought some of the most talented Bulgarian players, including [[Yordan Letchkov]], [[Ivaylo Andonov]] and [[Stoycho Stoilov]], among others. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defense concluded their affiliation with the club. Despite the uncertainty and the numerous problems that followed, CSKA won the title again in 1992. They were later eliminated in the first round of the [[1992\u201393 UEFA Champions League]] by [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]] after losing 1\u20133 in [[Vienna]] and winning 3\u20132 in Sofia.\n\nIn the meantime, [[Valentin Mihov]] was appointed president of the [[Bulgarian Football Union]] and Petar Kalpakchiev was chosen to replace him at the helm of CSKA. However, Kalpakchiev wrangled with the club's administration over their decisions to replace several coaches, one of which was [[Gjoko Had\u017eievski]], considered to be leading the club in the right direction, and eventually he was fired. The owner of the [[Multigroup]] conglomerate, [[Iliya Pavlov]], took over as president, but ultimately his sponsorship proved insufficient to overcome the club's ineffective management. Five coaches were changed in just one season, with Tsvetan Yonchev being coach for just one day. In Europe, CSKA nevertheless defeated [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] 3\u20132 in the first round of the [[1994\u201395 UEFA Cup]], but the result was annulled by [[UEFA]] because of the delayed player-indexing of forward [[Petar Mihtarski]], and Juventus were awarded a 3\u20130 victory by default. In the second leg in [[Turin]], CSKA succumbed to a 5\u20131 defeat.\n\nIn the summer of 1995, CSKA made a strong selection and eventually the club included half of the youth national football team of Bulgaria. [[Plamen Markov]] was appointed head coach, but after a disappointing first half of the season, he was replaced by [[Georgi Vasilev (footballer, born 1946)|Georgi Vasilev]], who had previously won three Bulgarian titles (one with [[FC Etar Veliko Tarnovo|Etar Veliko Tarnovo]] and two with Levski Sofia). Vasilev managed to win a double with CSKA for the [[1996\u201397 A PFG|1996\u201397 season]], entering the second qualifying round of the Champions League against [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]]. After a dramatic 3\u20133 in [[Bucharest]], CSKA fell 0\u20132 at home. Vasilev was unexpectedly released from the club at the beginning of the second half of the [[1996\u201397 A PFG|1997\u201398 season]] after a 3\u20130 win over [[PFC Spartak Pleven|Spartak Pleven]]. Coach [[Petar Zehtinski]] took his place. That year, the club saw the return of Hristo Stoichkov, [[Emil Kostadinov]] and [[Trifon Ivanov]], but the three of them challenged each other for the captain's band. Stoichkov played in only four matches and left CSKA right before the derby with Levski to play for a club in Saudi Arabia. After the end of the season, Ivanov also left the club. CSKA finished the season in third place.\n\nIn the summer of 1998, Dimitar Penev took the lead as coach for a second time. CSKA reached the second round of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], and won the Bulgarian Cup, but disappointed in the domestic league, finishing in fifth place in [[1998\u201399 A PFG|1999]]. That season, the young talents of [[Martin Petrov]], [[Stilian Petrov]], [[Dimitar Berbatov]] and [[Vladimir Manchev]] started to play a bigger role in the team. There were problems with player-indexing due to some unpaid obligations to [[PFC Naftex Burgas|Neftochimik]]. In the domestic championship, CSKA had only 16 players registered for the [[1999\u20132000 A PFG|1999\u20132000 season]] and some un-indexed players took part in official UEFA games. Consequently, at the shareholders meeting at the end of 1999, the club ownership was transferred to businessman Vasil Bozhkov, who became majority owner.\n\n=== 2000s ===\nAfter the first two fixtures in the spring of 2000, Dimitar Penev was relieved as coach because of the consecutive losses and in his place was appointed [[Georgi Dimitrov (footballer born 1959)|Georgi Dimitrov&nbsp;\u2013 Jacky]], who was later replaced by [[Spas Dzhevizov]]. After a 1\u20131 draw with [[PFC Pirin Blagoevgrad (1922)|Pirin]] at [[Bulgarian Army Stadium]], Dzhevizov handed in his resignation and [[Aleksandar Stankov (manager)|Aleksandar Stankov]] took his place. Even though at times CSKA had fallen as far as nine points behind league leaders Levski, the club shortened the difference to only two points before the decisive match for the title at [[Georgi Asparuhov Stadium]]. CSKA dominated Levski for most of the match, as Dimitar Berbatov made several serious misses, but a last-minute goal from [[Georgi Ivanov (footballer, born 1976)|Georgi Ivanov]] secured the title for Levski. In the summer of 2000, the Italian Enrico Catuzzi was retained as head coach, who managed to revive the team. However, even though the ''Army Men'' played attractive matches under his leadership, Catuzzi resigned in the winter, citing family problems. [[Aleksandar Stankov (manager)|Aleksandar Stankov]] was appointed as coach again, but was replaced by Catuzzi again after two losses from Litex for the cup and the championship. ''The Reds'' finished second, seven points behind Levski.\n\nTo start the [[2001\u201302 A PFG|2001\u201302 season]], CSKA's head coach was [[Asparuh Nikodimov]], however he would be fired during the winter break, as CSKA was situated two points behind Levski. He was replaced by another Italian, [[Luigi Simoni]]. Simoni failed to make CSKA champions as the club finished third and lost the [[Bulgarian Cup]] final to Levski. Simoni left at the end of the season.\n\nIn the summer of 2002, former player Stoycho Mladenov was appointed as head coach. With him, the team set a record with 13 consecutive wins in 13 matches in the Bulgarian Championship and CSKA became champions for the first time since 1997. However, Mladenov was fired the following season after losing to [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] in the qualifying rounds of the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League]] and after giving a less than impressive performance in the first round of the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], where the club lost on penalty kicks to [[FC Torpedo Moscow|Torpedo Moscow]]. Immediately after, two of the new arrivals, [[L\u00e9o Lima]] and [[Rodrigo de Souza Cardoso|Rodrigo Sousa]], purchased for 3 million dollars the year before, left the club on the grounds they had not received two monthly salaries. [[FIFA]] decided they had the right to leave and that CSKA had to pay them and return the players to their former club, [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]]. Alexander Stankov was temporarily appointed as head coach until the winter break, when [[Ferario Spasov]] officially took over the position. In the end of 2004, Spasov was replaced by Serbian coach [[Miodrag Je\u0161i\u0107]], despite the team finishing as champions in the league. Notwithstanding the club's selection issues, CSKA won their record 30th domestic title in 2005.\n\nFor the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League]], after eliminating [[KF Tirana|Tirana]] in the second qualifying round, CSKA were paired against reigning European champions Liverpool. The club lost 1\u20133 in the first match in Sofia, but surprisingly won the second leg 1\u20130 away at [[Anfield]], though CSKA was still eliminated on aggregate.<ref>[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=51536 CSKA Claim Amazing 1\u20130 over Liverpool] ''Novinite.com'' 23 August 2005.

Retrieved 2 April 2010.</ref> For the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], ''the Reds'' eliminated [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] (with Dimitar Berbatov in the team) with two 1\u20130 wins and entered the group stage, where they finished fifth with three points from four matches and were eliminated. During the winter break of the [[2005\u201306 A PFG|2005\u201306 season]], the club was in first position, seven points ahead of Levski. However, during the spring, CSKA lost the seven-point advantage and ultimately finished second, three points behind Levski. Club president Vasil Bozhkov blamed head coach Miodrag Je\u0161i\u0107 for the failure to capture the title and fired him, while some supporters blamed Bozhkov instead.\n\nFormer CSKA head coach Plamen Markov was appointed in Je\u0161i\u0107's place. Bozhkov then announced that he would restrict the finances of the club and that during the upcoming season CSKA will not be aiming at the title. In December 2006, Bozhkov sold the club to Indian steel tycoon and owner of [[Kremikovtzi AD]], [[Pramod Mittal]], brother of [[ArcelorMittal]]'s [[Lakshmi Mittal]]. Former Bulgarian politician [[Aleksandar Tomov (politician)|Aleksandar Tomov]] became president of the club and assured the supporters that CSKA would, in fact, be aiming at both the championship and the cup. After two draws in the beginning of the spring half of [[2006\u201307 A PFG|2006\u201307]], CSKA found themselves six points behind Levski. As a result, Plamen Markov was replaced by Stoycho Mladenov, who returned to lead the club after three-and-a-half years. CSKA finished second.\n\nDuring the beginning of the [[2007\u201308 A PFG|2007\u201308]] season, CSKA purchased players for more than \u20ac2&nbsp;million. The team was unluckily eliminated from the [[2007\u201308 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] in the first round by French side [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]] after a 96th-minute goal from [[Andr\u00e9-Pierre Gignac]] in the second leg for 1\u20131. CSKA was also eliminated from the [[Bulgarian Cup]] in the round of 16 by Lokomotiv Plovdiv. The match was engulfed in a scandal because of three CSKA players who at the time were on loan at Lokomotiv ([[Stoyko Sakaliev]], [[Aleksandar Branekov]] and [[Ivan Ivanov (footballer)|Ivan Ivanov]]). The players had clauses in their contracts restricting them from playing matches against CSKA, but Lokomotiv's management used the players anyway. At the end of the season, the ''Army Men'' secured the title in advance, finishing 16 points ahead of second-placed rivals Levski without losing a match from 30 championship matches. On 5 May 2008, the club marked its 60th anniversary with big celebrations organized by the management. An alley of fame was built, comprising the names of the most successful current and former players of CSKA. On 24 May 2008, an exhibition match was played between the current squad and a mixed team of Bulgarian and foreign football stars. The mixed team was coached by former [[Germany national football team|German international]] [[Lothar Matth\u00e4us]], who was a special guest for the anniversary celebrations. The match ended 6\u20136.\n\nIn June 2008, only days after CSKA won its 31st title, UEFA notified the [[Bulgarian Football Union]] (BFU) that the club would not receive a license for participating in the [[2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League]] because of unpaid obligations.<ref>[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=93746 Bulgaria FC CSKA Without License, Out of Champions' League] ''Novinite.com'' 3 June 2008.

Retrieved 8 April 2010.</ref> The BFU then speculated this could also result in CSKA not being able to take part in the domestic championship, effectively turning it into an amateur club. Attempts to arrange a settlement with UEFA proved unsuccessful and CSKA lost its right to compete in the Champions League in favor of runners-up Levski Sofia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/news/kind=1/newsid=731486.html |publisher=Uefa.com | title=Levski aim to ride their luck|accessdate=10 July 2008}}</ref> The person widely blamed for the crisis was club president Aleksandar Tomov, who resigned shortly after and was arrested and sued for embezzling millions of [[Bulgarian lev|levs]] from CSKA and [[Kremikovtzi AD]].<ref>[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=109077 Bulgaria Court Resumes Trial against CSKA Ex-President Tomov] ''Novinite.com'' 20 October 2009.

The future of CSKA looked grim, its status as a professional club hanging in the balance. In the midst of the crisis, Dimitar Penev was given the head coach's job for the third time and burdened with the task of saving the club. With almost all senior players gone, Penev was left to rely on members of the CSKA youth squad. Ultimately, CSKA managed to fulfill all licensing requirements set by the BFU and was allowed to compete in A Group.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bfunion.bg/index.php?request=news&set_month=8&news_id=1009 | publisher=(in Bulgarian) BFUnion.bg | title=\u0421\u044a\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u041b\u0438\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0411\u0424\u0421 | accessdate=5 August 2008}}</ref> Despite all the difficulties, and to the surprise of the whole football community, Penev's young squad claimed the [[Bulgarian Supercup]] in August 2008, overcoming Litex 1\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football24.bg/?gg=3&hh=4&ii=140&jj=6&ll=8725&mm=140|publisher=Football24.bg | title=CSKA won the Supercup Final|accessdate=4 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the [[2008\u201309 A PFG|2008\u201309 season]], the club managed to strengthen their ranks by signing Bulgarian internationals [[Zdravko Lazarov]] and [[Vladimir Manchev]].

His place was taken by the relatively unknown Macedonian manager [[Gjore Jovanovski]], who kept his job for just three months before being replaced by his assistant [[Milen Radukanov]]. Under Radukanov, CSKA won the [[2011 Bulgarian Cup Final|2011 Bulgarian Cup]] and the [[Bulgarian Super Cup|Bulgarian SuperCup]], beating league champions Litex Lovech 3\u20131.\n\nCSKA started 2011\u201312 with eight-straight league victories, but after a 1\u20132 defeat against Slavia Sofia and a 0\u20130 draw against [[PFC Cherno More Varna|Cherno More Varna]], Radukanov was unexpectedly fired by chairman Dimitar Borisov. Dimitar Penev was appointed as a temporary manager with [[Adalbert Zafirov]] as his assistant. In the spring, Stoycho Mladenov was again hired as head coach, and he led the club to a second-place league finish, a single point behind champions [[PFC Ludogorets Razgrad|Ludogorets Razgrad]] after losing on the final day of the season.\n\n==== 2012\u20132013 ====\nCSKA began the season by being surprisingly eliminated from international football by Slovenian football dwarf [[ND Mura 05|Mura 05]]. While the first leg in Slovenia ended in a 0\u20130 draw, a 1\u20131 tie at home eliminated the ''Reds'' from the [[2012\u201313 UEFA Europa League]] in the second qualifying round. The start of the domestic championship was unimpressive as well&nbsp;\u2013- a 0\u20131 loss to Litex, in which the club had no right to use its new signings due to administrative restrictions. However, in the middle of the autumn half of the season, CSKA achieved some significant wins, defeating Levski 1\u20130 in the Eternal Derby and eliminating Ludogorets Razgrad in the round of 32 of the Bulgarian Cup.\n\nIn late December 2012, head coach Stoycho Mladenov was abruptly fired by the club owners for \"disciplinary\" reasons, and Miodrag Je\u0161i\u0107 was appointed in his place. During the winter transfer window, CSKA made several signings, such as Bulgarian internationals [[Martin Kamburov]] and [[Spas Delev]], in addition to South-American players [[M\u00e1rcio de Souza Greg\u00f3rio J\u00fanior|Marcinho]] and [[Ignacio Lores Varela|Ignacio Varela]]. After managing the team for only two matches in the spring, Je\u0161i\u0107 was sacked and replaced by fan favourite Milen Radukanov, with whom the club managed to finish the season with the bronze medals.\n\nIn June 2013, former [[FIFA Ballon d'Or]] winner Hristo Stoichkov was released from Litex Lovech to replace Radukanov on the bench, but the poor financial condition of the club forced him to leave shortly after his arrival without even having signed a contract.

Founded out of the remains of a defunct [[Packet trade|packet company]], it gradually rose up as one of the most prominent shipping lines in the world, providing passenger and cargo services between the British Empire and the United States. While many other shipping lines focused primarily on speed, White Star branded their services by focusing more on providing steady and comfortable passages, for both upper class travellers and immigrants. Today, it is most famous for the innovative vessel [[RMS Oceanic (1870)|''Oceanic'']] of 1870, and for the losses of some of their best passenger liners, including the wrecking of [[RMS Atlantic|RMS ''Atlantic'']] at Halifax in 1873, the sinking of [[RMS Republic|RMS ''Republic'']] off Nantucket in 1909, the loss of [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1912 and [[HMHS Britannic|HMHS ''Britannic'']] in 1916 while serving as a hospital ship. And the RMS Buttanic. Which collided with a set of rocks. Despite its casualties, the company retained a prominent hold on shipping markets around the globe before falling into decline during the [[Great Depression]], which ultimately led to a merger with its chief rival, [[Cunard Line]], which operated as [[Cunard-White Star Line]] until 1950. Cunard Line then operated as a separate entity until 2005 and is now part of [[Carnival Corporation & plc]]. As a lasting reminder of the White Star Line, modern Cunard ships use the term ''White Star Service'' to describe the level of customer care expected of the company.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thecunarders.co.uk/cunard%20white%20star%20service.html |title=The Legendary Cunard White Star Service |website=The Cunarders |access-date=25 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117120152/http://www.thecunarders.co.uk/cunard%20white%20star%20service.html |archive-date=17 January 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:White Star flag NEW.svg|thumb|180px|White Star Line flag]]\nThe first company bearing the name ''White Star Line'' was founded in [[Liverpool]], England, by John Pilkington and Henry Wilson in 1845. It focused on the UK\u2013Australia trade, which increased following the [[Australian gold rushes|discovery of gold]] in Australia. The fleet initially consisted of the chartered sailing ships [[RMS Tayleur|RMS ''Tayleur'']], ''[[Blue Jacket (clipper)|Blue Jacket]]'', ''White Star'', ''[[Red Jacket (clipper)|Red Jacket]]'', ''Ellen'', ''Ben Nevis'', ''Emma'', ''Mermaid'' and ''Iowa''. ''Tayleur'', the largest ship of its day, was wrecked on its maiden voyage to Australia at [[Lambay Island]], near Ireland, a disaster that haunted the company for years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourke|first=Edward J|title=Bound for Australia|year=2003|page=18|isbn=0-9523027-3-X}}</ref>\n\nIn 1863, the company acquired its first steamship, ''Royal Standard''.<ref>http://www.tynebuiltships.co.uk/R-Ships/royalstandard1863.html</ref>\n\nThe original White Star Line merged with two other small lines in 1864, The Black Ball Line and The Eagle Line, to form a conglomerate, the [[Liverpool]], [[Melbourne]] and Oriental Steam Navigation Company Limited.<ref name=\"gracesguide.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/White_Star_Line|title=White Star Line|website=Gracesguide.co.uk|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref> This did not prosper and White Star broke away. White Star concentrated on Liverpool to [[New York City]] services. Heavy investment in new ships was financed by borrowing, but the company's bank, the [[Royal Bank of Liverpool]], failed in October 1867. White Star was left with an incredible debt of \u00a3527,000 ({{Inflation|UK|572000|1867|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} and was forced into bankruptcy.<ref name=\"gracesguide.co.uk\"/>\n\n=== The Oceanic Steam Navigation Company ===\nOn 18 January 1868, [[Thomas Henry Ismay|Thomas Ismay]], a director of the [[National Line]], purchased the house flag, trade name and goodwill of the bankrupt company for \u00a31,000 ({{Inflation|UK|1000|1868|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} with the intention of operating large ships on the North Atlantic service between Liverpool and New York. Ismay established the company's headquarters at [[Albion House, Liverpool]].\n[[File:Albion House (White Star Building), Lobby, Liverpool.jpg|thumb|left|Albion House (White Star Line Building), Interior Lobby, Liverpool]]\n\nIsmay was approached by [[Gustav Christian Schwabe]], a prominent [[Liverpool]] merchant, and his nephew, the shipbuilder [[Gustav Wilhelm Wolff]], during a game of billiards. Schwabe offered to finance the new line if Ismay had his ships built by Wolff's company, [[Harland and Wolff]].<ref name=\"Titanic\">{{cite book |title=Titanic: A Night Remembered |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBQWD4fhCN4C&pg=PA213&lpg=PA213&dq=Gustav+Schwabe+game+of+billiards&source=web&ots=psjaVRmtdT&sig=WQaXZUgcwHN8hI7uNa8s0b0caS4&hl=en\n|accessdate=27 March 2008|last=Barczewski |first=Stephanie |year=2006 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=1-85285-500-2 |page=213}}</ref> Ismay agreed, and a partnership with Harland and Wolff was established. The shipbuilders received their first orders on 30 July 1869. The agreement was that Harland and Wolff would build the ships at cost plus a fixed percentage and would not build any vessels for the White Star's rivals. In 1870, [[William Imrie]] joined the managing company. As the first ship was being commissioned, Ismay formed the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company to operate the steamers under construction.\n\n==The North Atlantic Run==\n===The ''Oceanic'' class===\nWhite Star began its North Atlantic run between Liverpool and New York with six nearly identical ships, also known as the 'Oceanic' class: [[RMS Oceanic (1870)|''Oceanic'' (I)]], [[RMS Atlantic|''Atlantic'']], [[SS Baltic (1871)|''Baltic'']], and [[SS Republic (1872)|''Republic'']], followed by the slightly larger [[SS Celtic (1872)|''Celtic'']] and [[SS Adriatic (1871)|''Adriatic'']]. It had long been customary for many shipping lines to have a common theme for the names of their ships. White Star gave their ships names ending in ''-ic''. The line also adopted a buff-coloured funnel with a black top as a distinguishing feature for their ships, as well as a distinctive [[Maritime flags|house flag]], a red [[broad pennant]] with two tails, bearing a white five-pointed star. In the initial designs for this first fleet of liners, each ship was to measure 420 feet in length, 40 feet in width and approximately 3,707 in gross tonnage, equipped with compound expansion engines powering a single screw, and capable of speeds of up to 14 knots. They were also identical in passenger accommodations based on a two-class system, providing accommodations for 166 First Class passengers amidships, which in those days was commonly referred to as 'Saloon Class' and 1,000 Steerage passengers.\n\nIt was within the circles of the massive tides of immigrants flowing from Europe to North America that the White Star Line aimed to be revered by, as throughout the company's full history they regularly strived to provide passage for steerage passengers which greatly exceeded that seen with other shipping lines. With the 'Oceanic' class, one of the most notable developments in steerage accommodations was the division of steerage at opposite ends of the vessels, with single men being berthed forward, and single women and families berthed aft, with later developments allowing married couples berths aft as well. \n[[File:Adriatic (1871).jpg|thumb|''Adriatic'' of 1871, (3,888 GRT)]]\nWhite Star's entry into the Trans-Atlantic passenger market in the spring of 1871 got off to a rocky start. When ''Oceanic'' sailed on her maiden voyage on 2 March, she departed Liverpool with only 64 passengers aboard, from whence she was expected to make port at Queenstown the following day to pick up more passengers before proceeding to New York. However, before she had cleared the Welsh coast her bearings overheated off Holyhead and she was forced to return for repairs. She resumed her crossing on 17 March and ended up not completing the crossing to New York until 28 March. However, upon her arrival in New York, she drew considerable attention, as by the time she departed on her return crossing to Liverpool on 15 April, some 50,000 spectators had looked her over.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 11\u201312.</ref> White Star's troubles with their first ship were short lived, as on ''Oceanic'''s second crossing to New York, on which she departed Liverpool on 11 May and arrived in New York on 23 May, she completed the crossing timely and with 407 passengers aboard.\n\nIn the eighteen months to follow, the five remaining ships were completed, and one by one, joined her on the North Atlantic run. ''Atlantic'' sailed on her maiden voyage from Liverpool on 8 June without incident. However, later that summer another problem surfaced which posed a threat to public opinion of the line. Of the six ships, the names originally selected for third and sixth ships of the fleet had initially been selected as ''Pacific'' and ''Arctic'', which when mentioned in the press appeared alongside references two ships of the same names which had belonged to the since defunct [[Collins Line]], both of which were lost at sea with large losses of life. In the cases of those ships, both of which had been wooden hulled paddle steamers, the ''[[SS Arctic|Arctic]]'' had foundered of the coast of Newfoundland in September 1854 after colliding with another ship, resulting in the loss of over 300 lives, while the ''[[SS Pacific (1849)|Pacific]]'' vanished with 186 on board in January 1856. As a result, White Star made arrangements to change the names of these two ships. The third ship of the fleet, which had been launched as ''Pacific'' on 8 March 1871 was renamed ''Baltic'' prior to its completion, a name which she sailed under on her maiden voyage on 14 September. At that same time, the keel of the last ship in the fleet, which had been named ''Arctic'' had just been laid at Harland & Wolff, and was thus renamed ''Celtic'' prior to her launch.\n\nThe fourth vessel of the ''Oceanic'' class, ''Republic'' sailed on her maiden voyage on 1 February 1872, around which time modifications were being made to the last two ships still under construction. Alterations in their designs called for their hulls to be extended in length by 17 feet, which for the ''Adriatic'' increased her gross tonnage to 3,888, and for ''Celtic'' her tonnage was increased to 3,867. ''Adriatic'' entered service on 11 April 1872, followed by ''Celtic'' six months later on 24 October. These ships began their careers with notable success, the most notable being ''Adriatic'', which after barely a month in service became the first White Star ship to capture the Blue Riband, having completed a record westbound crossing in 7 days, 23 hours and 17 minutes at an average speed of 14.53 knots. In January 1873, ''Baltic'' became the first of the line to capture the Blue Riband for an eastbound crossing, having completed a return trip to Liverpool in 7 days, 20 hours and 9 minutes at an average speed of 15.09 knots.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 17, 20, 22\u201323.</ref>\n\nThe first substantial loss for the company came only four years after its founding, occurring 31 March 1873 with the sinking of the [[RMS Atlantic|RMS ''Atlantic'']] and the loss of 535 lives near [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. While en route to New York from Liverpool amidst a vicious storm, the ''Atlantic'' attempted to make port at Halifax when a concern arose that the ship would run out of coal before reaching New York. However, when attempting to enter Halifax, she ran aground on the rocks and sank in shallow waters. Despite being so close to shore, a majority of the victims of the disaster drowned. The crew were blamed for serious navigational errors by the Canadian Inquiry, although a British Board of Trade investigation cleared the company of all extreme wrongdoing.<ref>Greg Cochkanoff and Bob Chaulk, ''SS Atlantic: The White Star Line's First Disaster at Sea'', (Goose Lane Editions, Fredericton, 2009) p. 99.</ref>\n\n===''Britannic'' and ''Germanic''===\n[[File:SS Britannic.jpg|thumb|SS Britannic of 1874 underway.]]\nIn the wake of the ''Atlantic'' disaster, White Star ordered two new steamers from Harland & Wolff, both of which were designed as considerably larger, two-funneled versions of the ''Oceanic'' class steamers. These two ships measured in design at 455 feet in length, 45 in width, each with a gross tonnage of roughly 5,000 tons and with engines of similar design as seen in the earlier ships, with the exception of greater horsepower, capable of driving their single screws at speeds of up to 15 knots. Also increased was passenger capacity, as designs for these ships provided for 200 Saloon passengers and 1,500 Steerage passengers. The first of the pair, which had initially been named ''Hellenic'', was launched as ''[[SS Britannic (1874)|Britannic]]'' on 3 February 1874 and commenced on her maiden voyage to New York on 25 June. Her sister, ''[[SS Germanic (1874)|Germanic]]'' was launched on 15 July of that same year, but due to a rather unsightly complication in her construction involving an experimental 'adjustable' propeller shaft which had to be removed, ''Germanic'' did not enter service until 20 May 1875. One notable development with the addition of these two ships was that with this addition, ''Oceanic'' was declared surplus and in the spring of 1875 was chartered to one of White Star's subsidiaries, the Occidental & Oriental Shipping company, under which she operated on their Trans-Pacific route between San Francisco, Yokohama and Hong Kong until her retirement in 1895.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 25\u201330.</ref> The two new steamers proved immensely popular on the North Atlantic run, and both would end up capturing the Blue Riband on two eastbound and three westbound crossings within a two-year period. The ''Germanic'' captured the westbound record first in August 1875, then captured the eastbound record in February 1876, while ''Britannic'' captured both records within less than two months of each other, beating the westbound record in November and the eastbound record in December. ''Germanic'' captured the westbound record for the last time in April 1877.<ref name=\"auto\">[[Blue Riband#List of record breakers]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=June 2018}}\n\n===''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic''===\n\nOver the next 12 years, White Star focused their attention on other matters of business, expanding their services with the introduction of several cargo and livestock carriers on the North Atlantic as well as establishing a small but lucrative passenger and cargo service to New Zealand. By 1887, however, the ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic'' and the four remaining ''Oceanic'' class liners had aged significantly and were now being outdone in speed and comfort by newer ships brought into service by White Star's competitors such as Cunard and Inman. In an effort to outdo their competitors, White Star began making plans to put two new liners into service which would prove to be exceptionally innovative in design for the time, ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic''. In order to build these new ships, Thomas Ismay made arrangements with the British Government under which in exchange for financial support from the British government, the two new ships would be designed as not only passenger liners, but also as armed merchant cruisers which could be requisitioned by the British Navy in times of war. Measuring at 565 feet in length and 57 feet in width and with a gross tonnage of just under 10,000 tons, the new liners would be nearly twice the size of ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic''. Additionally, owing to the arrangement with the British Government, the ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' were the first White Star liners to be built with twin screws, powered by triple expansion engines capable of driving the ships at speeds of up to 19 knots. \n[[File:Teutonic1890-1900.jpg|thumb|''Teutonic'' of 1889, (9,984 GRT)]]\nIn all, ''[[RMS Teutonic|Teutonic]]'' and ''[[RMS Majestic (1889)|Majestic]]'' were designed to be built with accommodations for 1,490 passengers in three classes across four decks, titled 'Promenade', 'Upper', 'Saloon' and 'Main'; with 300 in First Class, 190 in Second Class and 1,000 in Third Class. Their First Class accommodations, were located amidships on all four decks, with Second Class located abaft of first on the three uppermost decks on ''Teutonic'' and all four decks on ''Majestic'', and Third Class located at the far forward and aft ends of the vessel on the Saloon and Main decks.\n\nOne notable development associated with the introduction of these two new ships was that they were the first White Star liners to incorporate the three-class passenger system. Prior to this, White Star had made smaller attempts to enter the market for Second Class travelers on the North Atlantic by adding limited spaces for Second Class passengers on their older liners. According to De Kerbrech, spaces for Second Class were added to ''Adriatic'' in 1884, ''Celtic'' in 1887 and ''Republic'' in 1888, often occupying one or two compartments formerly occupied by Steerage berths.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 19, 22, 24.</ref>\n\nIn March 1887, the first keel plates of the ''Teutonic'' were laid at Harland & Wolff, while construction on ''Majestic'' commenced the following September. Construction on the two liners progressed in roughly six-month intervals, with the Teutonic being launched in January 1889 and sailing on her maiden voyage to New York the following August; while ''Majestic'' was launched in June 1889 and entered service in April 1890.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 45, 51.</ref> Prior to her entry into service, ''Teutonic'' made a rather noteworthy appearance at the 1889 Naval Review at Spithead, which was also set to commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. Although due to scheduling commitments she could not take part in the actual review, she anchored briefly amidst a line of merchant ships awaiting review, complete with four guns mounted, during which time she was toured by the Prince of Wales and Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Kaiser, much impressed with what he saw in ''Teutonic'', is rumored to have mentioned to others in his party \"We must have one of these!\".<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". p. 46.</ref> They would be White Star's last speed record breakers, as both ships would capture the Blue Riband in the summer of 1891 within two weeks of each other. ''Majestic'' beat the westbound record first on 5 August 1891, arriving in New York in 5 days, 18 hours and 8 minutes after keeping an average speed of 20.1 knots. This record was beat by ''Teutonic'', which arrived in New York on 19 August and beat the previous record by 1 hour and 37 minutes, this time maintaining an average speed of 20.35 knots.<ref name=\"auto\"/>{{Circular reference|date=June 2018}}\n\nWith the introduction of ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'', White Star did away with some of their aging fleet to make room for the new ships. Prior to the completion of the two new ships, ''Baltic'' and ''Republic'' were both sold to the [[Holland America Line]] and respectively renamed ''Veendam'' and ''Maasdam'', after which they were put into service on the company's main Trans-Atlantic route between Rotterdam and New York. ''Veendam'' was lost at sea without loss of life after striking a submerged object in 1898, while ''Maasdam'' was again sold in 1902 to La Veloce Navigazione Italiana and renamed ''Citta di Napoli'', after which she was used as an emigrant ship for an additional eight years before being sold for scrap at Genoa in 1910.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 17, 19.</ref> In 1893, by which time ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' had established themselves on the North Atlantic run, White Star sold ''Celtic'' to the Danish [[Thingvalla Line]], who renamed her ''Amerika'' and attempted to use her for their own emigrant service from Copenhagen to New York. This, however, failed to prove profitable for the line and she was sold for scrap at Brest in 1898.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". p. 24.</ref>\n\n===''Cymric'' and the move from speed to comfort===\n\nBeginning in the late 1890s, White Star experienced an explosion of rapid growth and expansion of its services, highlighted by a dramatic shift in focus from building the fastest ships on the North Atlantic to building the most comfortable and luxurious. Their first step in this direction came in 1897 during the construction of a new ship, ''[[SS Cymric|Cymric]]''. Initially designed as an enlarged version of the livestock carrier ''[[SS Georgic (1895)|Georgic]]'', which had entered service in 1895, ''Cymric'' had been planned as a combination passenger and livestock carrier, and thus was not designed with engines necessary to qualify her for the express service maintained by ''Britannic'', ''Germanic'', ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic''. However, while she was under construction at Harland & Wolff, a decision was made to convert spaces aboard her designated for cattle into Third Class accommodations after it was deemed that carrying passengers and livestock aboard the same vessel would not likely prove a popular venture. Therefore, in addition to the accommodations planned for 258 First Class passengers, her designs were altered to include berthing for 1,160 Third Class passengers.<ref name=\"auto1\">De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". p. 65</ref>\n\nOverall, her modest layout and design placed her with a footing directly between that of the aged but well reputable ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic'' and that of the more modern ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic''. Measuring at just over 13,000 tons and with a length of 585 feet and a beam of 64 feet, she was to be the largest liner in the White Star fleet, for a time at least. Additionally, her more utilitarian appearance with a single funnel and four masts contrasted her against her four running mates considerably. Because of this design, she was considered the first of White Star's 'intermediate' liners. However, as a result of this partial transition from livestock carrier to passenger liner, ''Cymric'' came to attain several noteworthy advantages which White Star would employ on several other liners. While her passenger accommodations had been modified, the specifications of her machinery and engines were left in place. Like ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'', ''Cymric'' was fitted with twin screws, but was instead powered by quadruple expansion engines capable of achieving a modest speed of 15 knots commonly seen in cargo and livestock carriers of that time. The major difference was that because these engines were designed for more modest speeds, they were considerably smaller and required only seven boilers, leaving more space within the hull for passenger and crew accommodations.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. 'The Big Four of the White Star Line'. pp. 9\u201310.</ref> At the same time, this also meant she consumed much less coal than steamers designed with larger engines, making her more economical. ''Cymric'' was launched at Harland & Wolff in October 1897 and entered White Star's North Atlantic service in February 1898, and in time proved a popular and profitable addition to the fleet.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n[[File:Colorful Oceanic.jpg|thumb|''Oceanic'' of 1899, (17,272 GRT)]]\n\n===''Oceanic'' and the death of Thomas Ismay===\n\nIn the early months of 1897, while ''Cymric'' was still under construction at Harland & Wolff, it became clear to Thomas Ismay and other line officials that a new addition to the North Atlantic fleet was needed, as compared to the fleets of many of their competitors such as Cunard and North German Lloyd, White Star was lagging behind. By this point, the only remaining ship of the original 'Oceanic' class of liners was the ''Adriatic'', and in her old age of a full quarter century, her days on the North Atlantic were now numbered. ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic'' were not too far behind after more than twenty years service, and with the advancements seen in shipbuilding during the 1890s ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' had been eclipsed by several newer vessels, most recently North German Lloyd's ''Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse''. In response to this lagging, Ismay and his partners at Harland & Wolff set out to design two new liners for the North Atlantic run which would, in a fashion similar to how ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' had done, go down in shipbuilding history.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". p. 81.</ref>\n\nThe new steamers, which were intended to be named ''[[RMS Oceanic (1899)|Oceanic]]'' and ''Olympic'', were designed to be both the largest and most luxurious the world had ever seen. In March 1897, the first keel plates for ''Oceanic'' were laid at Harland & Wolff, but almost immediately problems arose. Because the shipbuilder had never constructed a vessel of this size, work on the ship was delayed until an overhead gantry crane could be built. Her launch on 14 January 1899 drew an immense crowd of spectators numbering more than 50,000, as the launch placed ''Oceanic'' in history as the last British Trans-Atlantic liner to be launched in the 19th century as well as the first to exceed the ''Great Eastern'' in length. In all, she measured in at 704 feet in length with a beam of 68 feet, and had a gross tonnage of 17,254, making her a full 42% larger than North German Lloyd's ''Kaiser Wilhelm Der Grosse''. Like ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'', ''Oceanic'' was designed with capabilities to be converted to an armed merchant cruiser in time of war if needed, specifications for which included her to be built with a double-plated hull and turrets on her upper decks which could be quickly mounted with guns.<ref name=\"auto2\">The Titanic Commutator: Vol II, Issue 23, Fall 1979: pp. 4\u20135.</ref> She was also built with triple expansion engines geared to twin screws capable of achieving a respectable, if not record breaking, service speed of 19 knots. Additionally, she had a considerably larger passenger capacity of just over 1,700, providing for 410 First Class, 300 Second Class and 1,000 Third Class.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n\n''Oceanic'' sailed on her maiden voyage from Liverpool on 6 September 1899, arriving in New York to much added fanfare on the morning of 13 September with 1,456 passengers aboard, many of whom were well satisfied with how the crossing had gone. Among those travelling aboard in First Class were Harland & Wolff's managing director, Lord Pirrie, and Thomas Andrews, who had designed ''Oceanic'' under Thomas Ismay's direction. At the time ''Oceanic'' made her departure from Liverpool a fireman's strike had been ensuing at the docks, which in turn meant she sailed with a boiler room crew consisting of fewer men than her specifications called for. Thus, during her maiden voyage her engines had been run and maintained an average speed of just under 19 knots. In an interview, Lord Pirrie had been asked why she hadn't broken any speed records. His reply was thus as follows: \"The only record she is built to beat is that for regular running. She is to swing back and forth across the Atlantic with the regularity of a pendulum.\"<ref>The Titanic Commutator: Vol II, Issue 23, Fall 1979: pp. 7, 9\u201310.</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, Thomas Ismay was unable to enjoy the fruits of his labor, much to the dismay of his family and his colleagues. Just a few weeks after ''Oceanic'' was launched, Thomas began complaining of pains in his chest, from whence his health steadily began to decline. In fact, his health began to deteriorate so rapidly that managers with White Star and Harland & Wolff both decided to cancel plans to construct the second ship which was to serve as running mate to ''Oceanic'', ''Olympic''. The name was shelved, only to be reused 12 years later. His health improved for a brief time, allowing him to visit ''Oceanic'' upon her completion in Belfast that July. During his visit, Belfast officials awarded him with a key to the city, citing his contributions to the local economy and to British merchant shipping. Unfortunately, in late August he took a turn for the worse and he underwent two operations to alleviate his ailment, both of which proved unsuccessful, and Thomas suffered a heart attack on 14 September. He lingered in worsening agony for another ten weeks until his death on 23 November 1899 at the age of 62. In the immediate aftermath, control of the company was passed to Thomas' son Bruce, who was named chairman of the line.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==='The Big Four'===\n{{main|Big Four (White Star Line)}}\n[[File:RMS Adriatic postcard.jpg|thumb|''Adriatic'' of 1907 (24,541 GRT), the largest of the ''Big Four'']]\nEven before ''Oceanic'' had been completed, White Star had already started making plans for a considerably larger addition to their fleet. In September 1898, before his health began failing, Thomas Ismay negotiated the terms for the orders for the last passenger liner he would ever order for the line he'd built. This time around, plans were essentially the same as they had been with ''Oceanic'', only taking considerable more steps in innovation. While staying with the trend in focusing more on comfort than speed as had been set with ''Cymric'' and ''Oceanic'', Ismay's plans called for a new passenger liner of dimensions the world had never seen, and her chosen name was to be ''[[RMS Celtic (1901)|Celtic]]'', a name taken and reused from the original ''Oceanic'' class. The initial designs for ''Celtic'' had her at 680 feet in length, a tad bit shorter than ''Oceanic'', but with a greater breadth of her predecessor at 75 feet. Additionally, while the ''Oceanic'' had set the record for length, ''Celtic'' would triumph in tonnage, weighing in at just over 20,000 tons.<ref>https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/SS_Celtic</ref>\n\n====Engines====\nOne interesting note about this new ship was in regards to her engines. Historian Mark Chirnside made a notable comparison between the machinery installed aboard ''Cymric'' and that placed in ''Oceanic''. Because ''Cymric'' had initially been designed as a livestock carrier, she was built with smaller engines capable of modest speeds which both consumed less coal and occupied less space within the hull. As a result, there was an astonishing difference which gave ''Cymric'' a considerable advantage over ''Oceanic''. Although ''Cymric'' was overall only about two-thirds the size of ''Oceanic'' in terms of gross tonnage (12,552 to 17,274), her net tonnage, a unit of measurement used to account for space aboard a ship usable for passengers and cargo was actually greater than what was seen in the larger vessel (8,123 net tons aboard ''Cymric'' compared to only 6,996 with the ''Oceanic''). According to Chirnside, builders and designers used this as a baseline for engine designs for ''Celtic''.<ref name=\"auto3\">Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". pp. 10\u201311, 13.</ref> She was to be equipped with quadruple expansion engines geared to twin screws capable of considerably modest speeds of just over 16 knots. Because she was geared to set lower service speeds, her coal consumption was far less at only 260 tons per day, which compared to the 400 tons per day needed to power ''Oceanic'' made her much more economical.<ref>Gardiner, Robin. \"The History of the White Star Line\". p. 121.</ref> At the same time, owing to her broad hull, she was designed with cargo holds capable of storing up to 18,500 tons of commercial cargo, a strategic placement in her design as that cargo was to serve as ballast, keeping her steady in even the roughest seas.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n====Capacities====\nAdditionally, ''Celtic'' was to be designed with far greater capacities for both passengers and cargo. Her plans called for accommodations for a staggering 2,859 passengers: 347 in First Class, 160 in Second Class, and a total of 2,352 in Third Class, the latter being largest capacity seen of any liner on the North Atlantic at the time. Passenger accommodations were spread across six decks, titled from top to bottom: Boat Deck (A Deck), Upper Promenade (B Deck), Promenade (C Deck), Saloon (D Deck), Upper (E Deck) and Lower (F Deck). First Class accommodations were located amidships on the uppermost four decks and included a lounge and smoke room on the Boat Deck, as well as a grand and spacious dining room on the Saloon Deck. Second Class accommodations were allocated to the starboard sides of the Saloon and Upper Decks. Like as seen aboard ''Teutonic'', ''Majestic'', and ''Oceanic'', Second Class passengers were provided with their own smoke room and library, housed within a separate deckhouse situated just aft of the main superstructure, directly beneath which on the Saloon Deck was located their dining room.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". pp. 13, 20</ref>\n\nWhat made ''Celtic'' rather exceptional for the time was her Third Class accommodations, which in addition to ample open deck space on the Promenade Deck, were located on the Saloon, Upper and Lower Decks at both the forward and aft ends of the vessel, with a vast majority being located aft. The pattern followed that as was seen on all White Star vessels on the North Atlantic, with single men berthed forward, and single women, married couples and families berthed aft. On the Saloon Deck, in addition to baths and lavatories both forward and aft, were located two large dining rooms at the far after end of the deck, situated side by side, which when meals weren't being served respectively functioned as smoke and general rooms. An additional, fairly larger dining room was located directly beneath these on the Upper Deck, while a fourth dining room was located forward where single men were to be berthed, for which this dining room was equipped with a service bar. Aside from this, the biggest change brought by the ''Celtic'' for Third Class passengers was in sleeping quarters. In these days, open berths were still fairly common on the North Atlantic, which White Star had from the start gradually shied away from. Aboard the ''Oceanic'' class liners, ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic'', steerage passengers had been provided with large rooms which generally slept around 20 people, while aboard ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' the usage of two and four berth cabins had been introduced, but only for married couples and families with children, a policy which also held with ''Cymric'' and ''Oceanic''. ''Celtic'' broke that mould. At the forward end of the vessel, located in two compartments on the Lower Deck were accommodations of the older style of sleeping arrangements, each compartment providing for 300 single men. The remaining 1,752 berths were located aft, all of which consisted of two, four and six berth cabins.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". pp. 13, 20.</ref>\n\n====Construction====\nOn 22 March 1899, just two months after ''Oceanic'' was launched, the first keel plates of the ''Celtic'' were laid at Harland & Wolff. Construction progressed on her rapidly, and as White Star had planned, the new fleet of liners would be constructed in overlapping succession, as in October 1900, while ''Celtic'''s hull was nearing completion, construction began on the second ship, ''[[RMS Cedric|Cedric]]''. When ''Celtic'' was launched in April 1901, there was much fanfare, as she was hailed the largest ship in the world in terms of tonnage, as well as being the first to exceed the tonnage of the infamous ''Great Eastern''. She took a mere four additional months for fitting out before sailing on her maiden voyage from Liverpool on 26 July of that year.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". pp. 10, 15\u201320.</ref> Upon her entry into service, one of her most attractive features was her seaworthiness, as on her maiden voyage it was noted how while at sea, she was \"as steady as the Rock of Gibraltar.\"<ref>\"The Titanic Commutator\", Volume VII, Issue II, Summer 1983. \"The Big Four of the White Star, Part 1\", p. 7</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, construction on ''Cedric'' had proceeded as planned and she was launched on 21 August 1902. Although she was of exactly the same dimensions as ''Celtic'' in length and width, she outweighed her twin by a mere 155 tons, making her now the largest ship in the world. Despite their similarities, the two had distinct differences. Aboard ''Cedric'', First Class accommodations included more private bathrooms as well as more suites consisting of interconnecting cabins provided with sitting rooms.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". p. 33</ref> In all, she had accommodations for 2,600 passengers, with a slightly increased number of First Class passengers at 350, her Second Class capacity was increased to 250, while Third Class was scaled back to approximately 2,000. ''Cedric'' entered service later that winter, departing Liverpool on her maiden voyage on 11 February 1903.<ref>\"The Titanic Commutator\", Volume VII, Issue II, Summer 1983. \"The Big Four of the White Star, Part 1\", p. 9</ref>\n\nThe keel of the third sister, ''[[RMS Baltic (1903)|Baltic]]'' had been laid down at Harland & Wolff in June 1902, while construction on ''Cedric'' was still underway. One notable instance in her construction was once her keel was fitted in place, White Star gave orders for her length to be extended by 28 feet. This change in plans required builders to cut her keel in two, move the after end backwards and install the new addition in between. Their reasons for this addition was likely to provide more spaces for passenger accommodations, which combined added up to 2,850 passengers Although ''Baltic'' was designed with the same layout for Third Class passengers as ''Cedric'', with a capacity of 2,000, her First and Second Class capacities were significantly greater. First Class was increased to a capacity for 425 passengers, while capacity for Second Class was extended to 450 passengers, almost twice that of ''Cedric'' and three times that of ''Celtic''. Simultaneously, the added length also increased her gross tonnage to 23,884, making her now the largest ship in the world. ''Baltic'' was launched on 12 November 1903, subsequently fitted out and delivered to White Star on 23 June 1904, and sailed on her maiden voyage on 29 June.<ref>\"The Titanic Commutator\", Volume VII, Issue II, Summer 1983. \"The Big Four of the White Star, Part 1\", pp. 13\u201315.</ref>\n\nWhile the first three members of the highly regarded quartet of liners were built and put into service with little problems, the fourth and final ship, ''[[RMS Adriatic (1906)|Adriatic]]'', experienced a considerable delay in her construction. Initially, her construction had commenced in November 1902 while ''Baltic'' was still being built, but a series of delays slowed her construction to a snail's pace as compared to that of her sisters. For example, the timeline of construction on ''Baltic'' between the laying of her keel and her launch was roughly 17 months. By the time ''Adriatic'' was finally launched in September 1906, she'd been under construction for almost 46 months, more than twice the time needed to construct her twin.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". p. 54</ref> In her design, her passenger accommodations followed the same trend as seen with ''Baltic'', with added focus on the upper two classes while still maintaining the high standard for Third Class. Her overall passenger capacity was also identical to that of ''Baltic'' at 2,850, but with differences in capacities for each class, with First Class increased to 450, Second Class increased to 500 and Third Class scaled back to 1,900. Unlike her sisters however, she was unable to attain the title of world's largest ship at the time of her completion, as her 24,451 gross tonnage was just barely outmatched by Hamburg Amerika's ''Kaiserin Auguste Victoria'', which measured at 24,581 tons and entered service four months prior to the launch of ''Adriatic''. She would, however, rank briefly as the largest British-built ship until Cunard's famous greyhound ''Lusitania'' came into service the following year.<ref>\"The Titanic Commutator\", Volume VII, Issue II, Summer 1983. \"The Big Four of the White Star, Part 1\", pp. 16\u201317.</ref> She sailed on her maiden voyage to New York on 8 May 1907, and not long afterwards gained a considerable reputation for her interiors, enough for the British tabloid ''The Bystander'' to dub her 'The Liner Luxurious'. One of her most notable innovations was that she was the first liner to have an onboard Turkish Bath and swimming pool.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". p. 61</ref>\n\n===Intermediate liners and rapid expansion, 1903\u201307===\n\nAs White Star gradually brought the 'Big Four' into service, they also attained several smaller 'intermediate' liners in preparation for a considerable expansion of their passenger services on the North Atlantic. In 1903 alone they came to obtain five new liners, beginning with ''Arabic''. Originally laid down as ''Minnewaska'' for the Atlantic Transport Line, she was transferred to White Star prior to completion and was launched under her new name on 18 December 1902. Similar in size and appearance to ''Cymric'' with a single funnel and four masts, she measured at 600 feet in length with a beam of 65 feet, weighing in at 15,801 gross tons with quadruple expansion engines geared to twin screws capable of a service speed of 16 knots. She was fitted with fairly modest accommodations for 1,400 passengers: 200 in First Class, 200 in Second Class and 1,000 in Third Class. She sailed on her maiden voyage out of Liverpool to New York on 26 June 1903.\n\nMeanwhile, as a result of the IMMCo. takeover under J. Pierpont Morgan, White Star obtained four newly completed liners in the last months of 1903, they being the ''Columbus'', ''Commonwealth'', ''New England'' and ''Mayflower''. These four liners had been owned and operated by the Dominion Line for their services between Liverpool and Boston as well as their Mediterranean cruising and emigrant route, which also connected to Boston. However, the Dominion Line was also absorbed into the IMM scheme and the four ships were transferred to White Star. In addition to the acquisition of these ships, White Star also acquired control of the routes as well. Upon their acquisition by White Star, the four liners were respectively renamed ''Republic'', ''Cretic'', ''Romanic'' and ''Canopic''. These four ships were greatly similar in appearance to the ''Cymric'' and ''Arabic'', all with a single funnel with two or four masts, with engines geared to twin screws capable of service speeds between 14 and 16 knots. They all also fell within the same range in terms of dimensions, with lengths between 550 and 582 feet, beams between 59 and 67 feet, and gross tonnage as follows, ''Republic'' at 15,378 tons, ''Cretic'' 13,518 tons, ''Romanic'' at 11,394 tons and ''Canopic'' at 12,097 tons. There was, however, considerable variances in passenger capacities. ''Republic'', which in time would come to obtain the nickname 'The Millionaire's Ship', had the largest capacity with accommodations for 2,400 passengers (200 First Class, 200 Second Class, 2,000 Third Class). The three remaining ships had considerably smaller capacities, with the ''Cretic'' designed with accommodations for 1,510 passengers (260 First Class, 250 Second Class, 1,000 Third Class), ''Romanic'' with accommodations for 1,200 passengers (200 First Class, 200 Second Class, 800 Third Class) and ''Canopic'' with accommodations for 1,277 passengers (275 First Class, 232 Second Class, 770 Third Class).<ref name=\"Kerbrech, Richard p. 113-118\">De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 113\u2013118.</ref>\n\nFollowing the conclusion of their service under Dominion in the late fall of 1903, the four liners were briefly withdrawn from service, their names redone, funnels repainted in White Star colors, and made ready for their new services. ''Romanic'' was the first to enter service under White Star, sailing for Boston on 19 November, followed by ''Cretic'' on 26 November. In order to balance the schedule between the Liverpool and Mediterranean services to Boston, ''Cymric'' was transferred to the Liverpool-Boston route, departing Liverpool for her first trip to Boston on 10 December, while ''Republic'' entered service to Boston on 17 December. ''Canopic'' completed the service upon her departure from Liverpool on 14 January 1904. Upon their arrivals in Boston, ''Romanic'' and ''Canopic'' were both immediately transferred to the Mediterranean services formerly upheld by the Dominion Line. This route followed a line which first made port at [[Sao Miguel Island|Sao Miguel]] in the [[Azores]] before passing through the straits of Gibraltar and making port in Naples and Genoa. ''Republic'' was also put into service on the Mediterranean route following her first crossing to Boston, but only for the first half of the 1904 season, as come summer she was switched back to the Liverpool-Boston service until winter, a pattern of divided seasons between  the North Atlantic and Mediterranean routes which she would follow for the remainder of her career. ''Cretic'' remained on the Liverpool-Boston service running opposite ''Cymric'' for a full year until November 1904, when alongside ''Republic'' she began sailing on a secondary service to the Mediterranean from New York.<ref name=\"Kerbrech, Richard p. 113-118\"/>\n\n[[File:Canute Chambers.jpg|thumb|upright|Canute Chambers, former White Star Line offices in Southampton]]\nIn the early months of 1907, White Star began preparations for another extension of their services on the North Atlantic by establishing an 'Express' service to New York. The new service would terminate out of Southampton every Wednesday, first heading south across the English Channel to the French port of Cherbourg that evening, then sailing back across the channel to Queenstown the following morning before proceeding to New York. On eastbound crossings, ships would forego calling at Queenstown and make port at Plymouth, before proceeding to Cherbourg and Southampton. Because of its proximity to London, Southampton had a clear advantage over Liverpool in reducing travelling time, while by establishing a terminal at Cherbourg White Star had established a route which allowed travelers to embark or disembark at either a British or Continental port.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". p. 66</ref> Another subsidiary of IMM, the [[American Line]], had moved their operations to Southampton in 1893 and established an express service via Cherbourg which had proved very successful, thus prompting White Star to make a similar move.<ref>Flayhart, William H. \"The American Line: 1871\u20131902\". p. 139.</ref> ''Celtic'' embarked on two experimental crossings from Southampton to New York via Cherbourg and Queenstown, first on 20 April and then again on 18 May, which proved successful and set the way for the establishment of the route, which was to be maintained by ''Teutonic'', ''Majestic'', ''Oceanic'' and the newly completed ''Adriatic''. ''Celtic'' was returned to the Liverpool service after the second crossing, and her place taken on the new run by ''Adriatic'', which sailed from Southampton for the first time on 5 June, followed by ''Teutonic'' on 12 June, ''Oceanic'' on 19 June and ''Majestic'' on 26 June.\n\n=== Olympic class ships ===\n{{Main|Olympic-class ocean liner}}\n[[File:RMS Titanic 1.jpg|thumb|''Titanic'' of 1912 (46,328 GRT)]]\nThe Cunard Line was the chief competitor to White Star. In response to Cunard's [[RMS Lusitania|''Lusitania'']] and [[RMS Mauretania (1906)|''Mauretania'']], White Star ordered the ''Olympic'' class liners: [[RMS Olympic|''Olympic'']], [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] and [[HMHS Britannic|''Britannic'']]. While Cunard was famed for the speed of their ships, the ''Olympic'' class were to be the largest and most luxurious ships in the world. ''Olympic'', however, was the only ship of this class to have a successful career. ''Titanic'' sank on her maiden voyage in April 1912, while ''Britannic'' was requisitioned by the British government while she was still being fitted out, and was used as a [[hospital ship]] during [[World War I]]. ''Britannic'' hit an underwater mine in the Kea Channel and sank on the morning of 21 November 1916.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/britannic-sinks-in-aegean-sea|title=Britannic sinks in Aegean Sea \u2013 Nov 21, 1916 |website=History.com|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===First World War===\nLike many other shipping lines, the White Star Line suffered heavy losses during the [[First World War]] which began in August 1914, including some of their most prestigious vessels. The first major war loss was of [[RMS Oceanic (1899)|RMS ''Oceanic'']] of 1899, which was converted into an [[armed merchant cruiser]] and ran aground near the [[Shetland Islands]] due to navigational error in September 1914. The first White Star ship lost to enemy action was the liner [[SS Arabic (1902)|''Arabic'']] which was torpedoed off the Irish coast in August 1915 with the loss of 44 lives.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\">{{cite book|last1=Kerbrech|first1=Richard De|title=Ships of the White Star Line|date=2009|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|pages=181\u2013183|ISBN=978 0 7110 3366 5}}</ref>\n\n1916 would see the largest loss of the war, Titanic's sister ship [[HMHS Britannic|''Britannic'']] which was sunk near the Greek island of [[Kea (island)|Kea]] in May after striking a [[naval mine]], while in service as a [[hospital ship]]. ''Britannic'' was the largest loss for the company, and also the [[List of the largest ships hit by U-boats in World War I|largest ship sunk]] during the conflict. 1916 also saw the loss of the liner [[SS Cymric|''Cymric'']] which was torpedoed off the Irish coast in May, and also of the cargo ship [[SS Georgic (1895)|''Georgic'']], which was scuttled in December with its cargo of 1,200 horses still on board, after being intercepted in the Atlantic by the German [[merchant raider]] {{SMS|M\u00f6we|1914|6}}.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\"/>\n\n1917 saw the loss of the liner [[SS Laurentic (1908)|''Laurentic'']] in January which struck a mine off the Irish coast and sank with the loss of 354 lives and 3,211 gold ingots. The following month the liner [[SS Afric|''Afric'']] was sunk by a torpedo in the English Channel, as was the liner [[SS Delphic (1897)|''Delphic'']] in August.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\"/>\n\nMany White Star vessels were requisitioned for various types of war service, most commonly for use as [[troop ship]]s, the most notable of these was the [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']] which transported over 200,000 troops during the conflict.<ref>Chirnside, Mark (2011).

In 1922 the White Star Line obtained two former German liners which had been ceded to Britain as [[World War I reparations|war reparations]] under the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], ostensibly as replacements for the war losses of ''Britannic'', ''Oceanic'', ''Arabic'', ''Cymric'' and ''Laurentic''.: The former ''SS Bismarck'' which was renamed [[RMS Majestic (1914)|''Majestic'']], and the former ''SS Columbus'' which was renamed [[RMS Homeric (1913)|''Homeric'']]. At 56,551 gross tons,  ''Majestic'' was then the world's largest liner and became the company's flagship. The two former German liners operated successfully alongside ''Olympic'' for an express service on the Southampton\u2013New York route until the [[Great Depression]] reduced demand after 1930.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\"/>\n\nIn the immediate post-war period there was a boom in the transatlantic emigrant trade, from which White Star was able to benefit for a time, however this trade was badly affected by the American [[Immigration Act of 1924]] which introduced quotas for immigrants to the United States. This hit the profits of the shipping lines, for whom the emigrant trade had been a staple for nearly a century. However the growth in [[tourism]] was to some degree able to offset the decline of the emigrant trade, and White Star made efforts to appeal to this new breed of traveller by gradually overhauling liners still in service and re-configuring Third Class accommodations as Tourist Class.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\"/>\n\nIn 1927 the White Star Line was purchased by the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]] (RMSPC), making RMSPC the largest shipping group in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plimsoll.org/OnTheLine/ShippingLines/royalmail/default.asp#2 |title=Fact file \u2013 PortCities Southampton |website=Plimsoll.org |date= |accessdate=17 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.users.on.net/~snicol/story/index3.html |title=The Royal Mail Story: The Kylsant years |website=Users.on.net |accessdate=17 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208010107/http://www.users.on.net/~snicol/story/index3.html |archive-date=8 December 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1928 a new [[Oceanic (unfinished ship)|Oceanic (III)]] was proposed and her keel was laid down that year at Harland and Wolff. The thousand foot long liner was to have been a [[motor ship]] propelled by the new diesel-electric propulsion system, but the ship was never completed due to financial issues. ''Oceanic'''s keel was dismantled and the steel was used in two new smaller motor ships: [[MV Britannic (1929)|''Britannic'' (III)]] and [[MV Georgic (1932)|''Georgic'' (II)]]. Both of these ships entered service by 1932; they were the last liners White Star had built.\n\nRMSPC ran into financial trouble, and was liquidated in 1932. A new company, Royal Mail Lines Limited, took over the ships of RMSPC and their subordinate lines including White Star.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.users.on.net/~snicol/story/index4.html |title=The Royal Mail Story: Royal Mail Lines, Ltd |website=Users.on.net |accessdate=17 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316083323/http://www.users.on.net/~snicol/story/index4.html |archive-date=16 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Georgic postcard.jpg|thumb|[[MV Georgic (1932)|MV ''Georgic'']]; the last ship to be built for the White Star Line before the merger.]]\n\n=== Cunard merger ===\n[[File:Cunard White Star Line Logo.JPG|thumbpx|thumbnail|left|''Cunard-White Star'' Logo]]\nIn 1933 White Star and Cunard were both in serious financial difficulties because of the [[Great Depression]], falling passenger numbers and the advanced age of their fleets. Work was halted on Cunard's new giant, Hull 534 (later the [[RMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']]) in 1931 to save money. In 1933 the British government agreed to provide assistance to the two competitors on the condition that they merge their North Atlantic operations. The agreement was completed on 30 December 1933.\n\nThe merger took place on 10 May 1934, creating [[Cunard-White Star Limited]]. White Star contributed ten ships to the new company while Cunard contributed 15 ships. Because of this, and since Hull 534 was Cunard's ship, 62% of the company was owned by Cunard's shareholders and 38% of the company was owned for the benefit of White Star's creditors. White Star's Australia and New Zealand services were not involved in the merger, but were separately disposed of to Shaw, Savill & Albion later in 1934. A year after this merger, [[RMS Olympic|''Olympic'']], the last of her class, was removed from service. She was scrapped in 1937.\n\nIn 1947 Cunard acquired the 38% of Cunard White Star they did not already own, and on 31 December 1949 they acquired Cunard-White Star's assets and operations, and reverted to using the name \"Cunard\" on 1 January 1950. From the time of the 1934 merger, the house flags of both lines had been flown on all their ships, with each ship flying the flag of its original owner above the other, but from 1950, even [[MV Georgic (1931)|''Georgic'']]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chriscunard.com/history-fleet/cunard-white-star/fleet-details/georgic/ |title=Georgic |work=Chris' Cunard Page |date= |accessdate=17 February 2010 }}</ref> and [[MV Britannic (1929)|''Britannic'']],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chriscunard.com/history-fleet/cunard-white-star/fleet-details/britannic/ |title=Britannic |work=Chris' Cunard Page |date= |accessdate=17 February 2010}}</ref> the last surviving White Star liners, flew the Cunard house flag above the White Star burgee until they were each withdrawn from service, in 1956 and 1961 respectively.

However, in the late 1890s White Star decided to reinstate a service to Australia, partly because of the discovery of further gold deposits in [[Western Australia]] leading to another series of gold rushes and an increased traffic in emigrants to Australia, while there was also an increasing trade in minerals, agricultural produce, wool and meat in the other direction. The latter had become a major source of revenue for shipping lines already on the route after the advent of effective mechanical [[refrigeration]] systems in the late 1880s, allowing large quantities of cattle carcasses to be preserved on the long voyage back to the [[British Isles]].\n\nThomas Ismay decided to re-enter the Australian run in 1897 with a monthly service between [[Liverpool]], [[Cape Town]] and [[Sydney]]. A stop at [[Tenerife]] was included in the schedule both outbound and inbound. Outbound ships would call at [[Adelaide]] and [[Melbourne]] and the return trip would call at [[Plymouth]] before ending at Liverpool. With that route taking six weeks, five ships would be needed to maintain the service in both directions. The specification for the new ships was drawn up and the order placed with Harland & Wolff in the summer of 1897, coinciding with the [[Queen Victoria#Diamond Jubilee|Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria]], thus they became known as the [[Jubilee-class ocean liner]]s.<ref name=\"Kerbrech\">{{cite book|last1=Kerbrech|first1=Richard De|title=Ships of the White Star Line|date=2009|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|pages=78\u201389|ISBN=978 0 7110 3366 5}}</ref> In keeping with White Star's new philosophy on the Atlantic of size over speed, the Jubilee-class were to be the largest ships ever put on the Australia run, at 550&nbsp;ft (168 metres) in length and nearly 12,000 gross tons. They were single-funnel, twin-screw ships designed as mixed cargo/passenger vessels, being in essence enlarged versions of White Star's [[SS Naronic|Naronic-class]] ships.<ref name=\"Haws\">{{cite book |last1=Haws |first1=Duncan |title=White Star Line (Oceanic Steam Navigation Company) |date=1990 |isbn=0 946378 16 9 |pages=50\u201354}}</ref> With a service speed of 14 knots the Jubilee-class were significantly slower than the smaller mailships run by the [[Orient Line]] and [[P&O (company)|P&O]]. Their size meant they could not transit the [[Suez Canal]] and would have to take the long route via South Africa so would not attract first-class passengers. Instead they were intended for the emigrant/seasonal worker traffic, carrying 320 passengers solely in what was described as third-class accommodation. However, following White Star's long tradition of improving standards for third-class passengers, these facilities were considerably ahead of the equivalent on other lines, being broadly in line with second-class facilities on other ships. Although all of the same class, prices for berths on the Jubilee-class varied, allowing passengers the choice of two- or four-berth cabins for a premium or open dormitories. Passengers had use of facilities such as a large dining room, a library and a smoking room, as well as free run of nearly all the ship's deck space during the voyage. The ships could carry 15,000 tons of cargo in seven holds, including capacity for 100,000 meat carcasses.<ref name=\"NQR\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81645587 |title=A Mammoth Steamship.

The final pair of ships for the Australia run were to a modified design following the experiences with the original trio. The Australia Run proved to be more popular with passengers than expected so these two ships, [[SS Runic (1900)|''Runic'']] and [[SS Suevic|''Suevic'']] had their bridges moved forward and their poop decks extended.<ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/><ref name=\"Haws\"/> As well as slightly increasing their gross tonnage this gave them capacity for a further 50 passengers, bringing the total to 400. ''Suevic'' made her maiden voyage in May 1901, bringing White Star's new Australian service to full strength. By now the return voyage also included a stop at [[London]] \u2013 most passengers from Australia disembarked at Plymouth, to go to their final destination by railway, while much of the cargo was bound for London. The ship would then steam back through the [[English Channel]] to offload the last of her cargo and passengers at Liverpool before preparing for the next voyage. \n[[File:PERSIC_on_left_and_CERAMIC_on_right,_both_of_the_White_Star_Line._(3307507923).jpg|thumb|''Persic'' (left) and ''Ceramic'' (right) loading at [[Sydney]] in the 1920s.]]\nThe Australian Run was successful and profitable for White Star, and largely uneventful for the ships. In the earliest days of the route the initial three ships were heavily used to transport men, soldiers and supplies to South Africa during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], while ''Suevic'' [[SS Suevic#Shipwreck|ran aground]] off [[Lizard Point, Cornwall]] in dramatic fashion in 1907, but there were no casualties and, despite the ship being broken in two, she was repaired and reentered service in January 1908.<ref name=\"Haws\"/> The success of the new Australian service in terms of freight led to White Star transferring an older cargo-only ship of a similar size to the Jubilee-class, the [[SS Cevic (1893)|''Cevic'']], from the New York service to the Australia Run. In 1910 ''Cevic'' was used to experiment with routing ships to Australia via the [[Suez Canal]] but she ran aground several times in the canal and the ships remained on the route via the Cape. ''Cevic'' was used on the Australia Run on a seasonale basis, mainly carrying cattle and wool at the end of the Australian autumn (February\u2013April) and then being switched to the New York Run during the Atlantic summer.\n\nContinued demand for extra passenger capacity led to White Star building a one-off ship for the route. Launched in 1913, [[SS Ceramic|''Ceramic'']] was a larger, more sophisticated development of the Jubilee-class, at 655 feet (200 metres) in length and 18,495 gross tons. Like the [[SS Laurentic (1908)|''Laurentic'']] and the [[Olympic-class ocean liner|Olympic-class]], ''Ceramic'' was a triple-screw ship with the central propeller driven by a low-pressure turbine using exhaust from the two recriprocating steam engines. This enabled her to be slightly faster \u2013 16 knots \u2013 than the Jubilee-class vessels despite her extra size for a minimal increase in coal consumption. The new ship had a significantly larger superstructure and nearly double the passenger capacity of the Jubilee-class ships \u2013 a total of 600 passengers, still carried only in what was advertised as third-class accommodation. She could also carry 19,000 tons cargo in eight holds, including 321,000 cubic feet of refrigerated space.<ref name=\"Hardy\">{{cite book|last1=Hardy|first1=Clare|title=SS Ceramic, The Untold Story|date=2006|pages=19\u201320|ISBN=1 904908 64 0}}</ref> The dimensions of ''Ceramic'' were restricted by the length of the quay at London's [[Port of Tilbury]] and the clearance for the masts under the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]]. When she arrived in Sydney in September 1914 she took the place of the Jubilee-class ships as the largest vessels put on the Australia Run from Britain and became the tallest ship to pass under the bridge.<ref name=\"Hardy\"/>\n\nAll seven ships were requisitioned as troop transports during the [[World War I]], forcing White Star to suspend the regular Australia service. ''Afric'' was torpedoed by a [[U-Boat]] in the English Channel in 1917 and ''Cevic'' remained in the ownership of the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] after the war but the other five ships were returned to White Star and the service was resumed in 1919. The remaining Jubilee-class liners were withdrawn from White Star service in the late 1920s. ''Persic'' was scrapped in 1926 while the other three were sold in 1928 (''Medic'' and ''Suevic'') and 1929 (''Runic''). All were converted into whaling [[factory ship]]s on account of their size and cargo capacity. The Australia Run was no longer so lucrative or as heavily-trafficked as it had been before the war and the route was no longer a priority for White Star, especially once it came under the ownership of the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]] in 1927. A new ship, intended to be the first of a new class to replace the Jubilee-class, had been launched in 1917 - the [[SS Vedic|''Vedic'']]. This was the first White Star Line ship to be powered solely by [[steam turbine|turbines]] and had the same emigrant/cargo-carrying role as her predecessors, although at 460 feet (140 metres) and 9,332 gross tons she was smaller than the older ships. ''Vedic'' went straight from the builders to service as a troopship and was initially used on White Star's Canadian service until she was put on the Australia Run in 1925. Between them ''Ceramic'' and ''Vedic'' maintained a less-intensive Australian service until their owners merged with the [[Cunard Line]].

Founded out of the remains of a defunct [[Packet trade|packet company]], it gradually rose up as one of the most prominent shipping lines in the world, providing passenger and cargo services between the British Empire and the United States. While many other shipping lines focused primarily on speed, White Star branded their services by focusing more on providing steady and comfortable passages, for both upper class travellers and immigrants. Today, it is most famous for the innovative vessel [[RMS Oceanic (1870)|''Oceanic'']] of 1870, and for the losses of some of their best passenger liners, including the wrecking of [[RMS Atlantic|RMS ''Atlantic'']] at Halifax in 1873, the sinking of [[RMS Republic|RMS ''Republic'']] off Nantucket in 1909, the loss of [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1912 and [[HMHS Britannic|HMHS ''Britannic'']] in 1916 while serving as a hospital ship. Despite its casualties, the company retained a prominent hold on shipping markets around the globe before falling into decline during the [[Great Depression]], which ultimately led to a merger with its chief rival, [[Cunard Line]], which operated as [[Cunard-White Star Line]] until 1950. Cunard Line then operated as a separate entity until 2005 and is now part of [[Carnival Corporation & plc]]. As a lasting reminder of the White Star Line, modern Cunard ships use the term ''White Star Service'' to describe the level of customer care expected of the company.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thecunarders.co.uk/cunard%20white%20star%20service.html |title=The Legendary Cunard White Star Service |website=The Cunarders |access-date=25 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117120152/http://www.thecunarders.co.uk/cunard%20white%20star%20service.html |archive-date=17 January 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:White Star flag NEW.svg|thumb|180px|White Star Line flag]]\nThe first company bearing the name ''White Star Line'' was founded in [[Liverpool]], England, by John Pilkington and Henry Wilson in 1845. It focused on the UK\u2013Australia trade, which increased following the [[Australian gold rushes|discovery of gold]] in Australia. The fleet initially consisted of the chartered sailing ships [[RMS Tayleur|RMS ''Tayleur'']], ''[[Blue Jacket (clipper)|Blue Jacket]]'', ''White Star'', ''[[Red Jacket (clipper)|Red Jacket]]'', ''Ellen'', ''Ben Nevis'', ''Emma'', ''Mermaid'' and ''Iowa''. ''Tayleur'', the largest ship of its day, was wrecked on its maiden voyage to Australia at [[Lambay Island]], near Ireland, a disaster that haunted the company for years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourke|first=Edward J|title=Bound for Australia|year=2003|page=18|isbn=0-9523027-3-X}}</ref>\n\nIn 1863, the company acquired its first steamship, ''Royal Standard''.<ref>http://www.tynebuiltships.co.uk/R-Ships/royalstandard1863.html</ref>\n\nThe original White Star Line merged with two other small lines in 1864, The Black Ball Line and The Eagle Line, to form a conglomerate, the [[Liverpool]], [[Melbourne]] and Oriental Steam Navigation Company Limited.<ref name=\"gracesguide.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/White_Star_Line|title=White Star Line|website=Gracesguide.co.uk|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref> This did not prosper and White Star broke away. White Star concentrated on Liverpool to [[New York City]] services. Heavy investment in new ships was financed by borrowing, but the company's bank, the [[Royal Bank of Liverpool]], failed in October 1867. White Star was left with an incredible debt of \u00a3527,000 ({{Inflation|UK|572000|1867|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} and was forced into bankruptcy.<ref name=\"gracesguide.co.uk\"/>\n\n=== The Oceanic Steam Navigation Company ===\nOn 18 January 1868, [[Thomas Henry Ismay|Thomas Ismay]], a director of the [[National Line]], purchased the house flag, trade name and goodwill of the bankrupt company for \u00a31,000 ({{Inflation|UK|1000|1868|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} with the intention of operating large ships on the North Atlantic service between Liverpool and New York.

The shipbuilders received their first orders on 30 July 1869. The agreement was that Harland and Wolff would build the ships at cost plus a fixed percentage and would not build any vessels for the White Star's rivals. In 1870, [[William Imrie]] joined the managing company. As the first ship was being commissioned, Ismay formed the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company to operate the steamers under construction.\n\n==The North Atlantic Run==\n===The ''Oceanic'' class===\nWhite Star began its North Atlantic run between Liverpool and New York with six nearly identical ships, also known as the 'Oceanic' class: [[RMS Oceanic (1870)|''Oceanic'' (I)]], [[RMS Atlantic|''Atlantic'']], [[SS Baltic (1871)|''Baltic'']], and [[SS Republic (1872)|''Republic'']], followed by the slightly larger [[SS Celtic (1872)|''Celtic'']] and [[SS Adriatic (1871)|''Adriatic'']]. It had long been customary for many shipping lines to have a common theme for the names of their ships. White Star gave their ships names ending in ''-ic''. The line also adopted a buff-coloured funnel with a black top as a distinguishing feature for their ships, as well as a distinctive [[Maritime flags|house flag]], a red [[broad pennant]] with two tails, bearing a white five-pointed star. In the initial designs for this first fleet of liners, each ship was to measure 420 feet in length, 40 feet in width and approximately 3,707 in gross tonnage, equipped with compound expansion engines powering a single screw, and capable of speeds of up to 14 knots. They were also identical in passenger accommodations based on a two-class system, providing accommodations for 166 First Class passengers amidships, which in those days was commonly referred to as 'Saloon Class' and 1,000 Steerage passengers.\n\nIt was within the circles of the massive tides of immigrants flowing from Europe to North America that the White Star Line aimed to be revered by, as throughout the company's full history they regularly strived to provide passage for steerage passengers which greatly exceeded that seen with other shipping lines. With the 'Oceanic' class, one of the most notable developments in steerage accommodations was the division of steerage at opposite ends of the vessels, with single men being berthed forward, and single women and families berthed aft, with later developments allowing married couples berths aft as well. \n[[File:Adriatic (1871).jpg|thumb|''Adriatic'' of 1871, (3,888 GRT)]]\nWhite Star's entry into the Trans-Atlantic passenger market in the spring of 1871 got off to a rocky start. When ''Oceanic'' sailed on her maiden voyage on 2 March, she departed Liverpool with only 64 passengers aboard, from whence she was expected to make port at Queenstown the following day to pick up more passengers before proceeding to New York. However, before she had cleared the Welsh coast her bearings overheated off Holyhead and she was forced to return for repairs. She resumed her crossing on 17 March and ended up not completing the crossing to New York until 28 March. However, upon her arrival in New York, she drew considerable attention, as by the time she departed on her return crossing to Liverpool on 15 April, some 50,000 spectators had looked her over.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 11\u201312.</ref> White Star's troubles with their first ship were short lived, as on ''Oceanic'''s second crossing to New York, on which she departed Liverpool on 11 May and arrived in New York on 23 May, she completed the crossing timely and with 407 passengers aboard.\n\nIn the eighteen months to follow, the five remaining ships were completed, and one by one, joined her on the North Atlantic run. ''Atlantic'' sailed on her maiden voyage from Liverpool on 8 June without incident. However, later that summer another problem surfaced which posed a threat to public opinion of the line. Of the six ships, the names originally selected for third and sixth ships of the fleet had initially been selected as ''Pacific'' and ''Arctic'', which when mentioned in the press appeared alongside references two ships of the same names which had belonged to the since defunct [[Collins Line]], both of which were lost at sea with large losses of life. In the cases of those ships, both of which had been wooden hulled paddle steamers, the ''[[SS Arctic|Arctic]]'' had foundered of the coast of Newfoundland in September 1854 after colliding with another ship, resulting in the loss of over 300 lives, while the ''[[SS Pacific (1849)|Pacific]]'' vanished with 186 on board in January 1856. As a result, White Star made arrangements to change the names of these two ships. The third ship of the fleet, which had been launched as ''Pacific'' on 8 March 1871 was renamed ''Baltic'' prior to its completion, a name which she sailed under on her maiden voyage on 14 September. At that same time, the keel of the last ship in the fleet, which had been named ''Arctic'' had just been laid at Harland & Wolff, and was thus renamed ''Celtic'' prior to her launch.\n\nThe fourth vessel of the ''Oceanic'' class, ''Republic'' sailed on her maiden voyage on 1 February 1872, around which time modifications were being made to the last two ships still under construction. Alterations in their designs called for their hulls to be extended in length by 17 feet, which for the ''Adriatic'' increased her gross tonnage to 3,888, and for ''Celtic'' her tonnage was increased to 3,867. ''Adriatic'' entered service on 11 April 1872, followed by ''Celtic'' six months later on 24 October. These ships began their careers with notable success, the most notable being ''Adriatic'', which after barely a month in service became the first White Star ship to capture the Blue Riband, having completed a record westbound crossing in 7 days, 23 hours and 17 minutes at an average speed of 14.53 knots. In January 1873, ''Baltic'' became the first of the line to capture the Blue Riband for an eastbound crossing, having completed a return trip to Liverpool in 7 days, 20 hours and 9 minutes at an average speed of 15.09 knots.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 17, 20, 22\u201323.</ref>\n\nThe first substantial loss for the company came only four years after its founding, occurring 31 March 1873 with the sinking of the [[RMS Atlantic|RMS ''Atlantic'']] and the loss of 535 lives near [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. While en route to New York from Liverpool amidst a vicious storm, the ''Atlantic'' attempted to make port at Halifax when a concern arose that the ship would run out of coal before reaching New York. However, when attempting to enter Halifax, she ran aground on the rocks and sank in shallow waters. Despite being so close to shore, a majority of the victims of the disaster drowned. The crew were blamed for serious navigational errors by the Canadian Inquiry, although a British Board of Trade investigation cleared the company of all extreme wrongdoing.<ref>Greg Cochkanoff and Bob Chaulk, ''SS Atlantic: The White Star Line's First Disaster at Sea'', (Goose Lane Editions, Fredericton, 2009) p. 99.</ref>\n\n===''Britannic'' and ''Germanic''===\n[[File:SS Britannic.jpg|thumb|SS Britannic of 1874 underway.]]\nIn the wake of the ''Atlantic'' disaster, White Star ordered two new steamers from Harland & Wolff, both of which were designed as considerably larger, two-funneled versions of the ''Oceanic'' class steamers. These two ships measured in design at 455 feet in length, 45 in width, each with a gross tonnage of roughly 5,000 tons and with engines of similar design as seen in the earlier ships, with the exception of greater horsepower, capable of driving their single screws at speeds of up to 15 knots. Also increased was passenger capacity, as designs for these ships provided for 200 Saloon passengers and 1,500 Steerage passengers. The first of the pair, which had initially been named ''Hellenic'', was launched as ''[[SS Britannic (1874)|Britannic]]'' on 3 February 1874 and commenced on her maiden voyage to New York on 25 June. Her sister, ''[[SS Germanic (1874)|Germanic]]'' was launched on 15 July of that same year, but due to a rather unsightly complication in her construction involving an experimental 'adjustable' propeller shaft which had to be removed, ''Germanic'' did not enter service until 20 May 1875. One notable development with the addition of these two ships was that with this addition, ''Oceanic'' was declared surplus and in the spring of 1875 was chartered to one of White Star's subsidiaries, the Occidental & Oriental Shipping company, under which she operated on their Trans-Pacific route between San Francisco, Yokohama and Hong Kong until her retirement in 1895.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 25\u201330.</ref> The two new steamers proved immensely popular on the North Atlantic run, and both would end up capturing the Blue Riband on two eastbound and three westbound crossings within a two-year period. The ''Germanic'' captured the westbound record first in August 1875, then captured the eastbound record in February 1876, while ''Britannic'' captured both records within less than two months of each other, beating the westbound record in November and the eastbound record in December. ''Germanic'' captured the westbound record for the last time in April 1877.<ref name=\"auto\">[[Blue Riband#List of record breakers]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=June 2018}}\n\n===''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic''===\n\nOver the next 12 years, White Star focused their attention on other matters of business, expanding their services with the introduction of several cargo and livestock carriers on the North Atlantic as well as establishing a small but lucrative passenger and cargo service to New Zealand. By 1887, however, the ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic'' and the four remaining ''Oceanic'' class liners had aged significantly and were now being outdone in speed and comfort by newer ships brought into service by White Star's competitors such as Cunard and Inman. In an effort to outdo their competitors, White Star began making plans to put two new liners into service which would prove to be exceptionally innovative in design for the time, ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic''. In order to build these new ships, Thomas Ismay made arrangements with the British Government under which in exchange for financial support from the British government, the two new ships would be designed as not only passenger liners, but also as armed merchant cruisers which could be requisitioned by the British Navy in times of war. Measuring at 565 feet in length and 57 feet in width and with a gross tonnage of just under 10,000 tons, the new liners would be nearly twice the size of ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic''. Additionally, owing to the arrangement with the British Government, the ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' were the first White Star liners to be built with twin screws, powered by triple expansion engines capable of driving the ships at speeds of up to 19 knots. \n[[File:Teutonic1890-1900.jpg|thumb|''Teutonic'' of 1889, (9,984 GRT)]]\nIn all, ''[[RMS Teutonic|Teutonic]]'' and ''[[RMS Majestic (1889)|Majestic]]'' were designed to be built with accommodations for 1,490 passengers in three classes across four decks, titled 'Promenade', 'Upper', 'Saloon' and 'Main'; with 300 in First Class, 190 in Second Class and 1,000 in Third Class. Their First Class accommodations, were located amidships on all four decks, with Second Class located abaft of first on the three uppermost decks on ''Teutonic'' and all four decks on ''Majestic'', and Third Class located at the far forward and aft ends of the vessel on the Saloon and Main decks.\n\nOne notable development associated with the introduction of these two new ships was that they were the first White Star liners to incorporate the three-class passenger system. Prior to this, White Star had made smaller attempts to enter the market for Second Class travelers on the North Atlantic by adding limited spaces for Second Class passengers on their older liners. According to De Kerbrech, spaces for Second Class were added to ''Adriatic'' in 1884, ''Celtic'' in 1887 and ''Republic'' in 1888, often occupying one or two compartments formerly occupied by Steerage berths.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 19, 22, 24.</ref>\n\nIn March 1887, the first keel plates of the ''Teutonic'' were laid at Harland & Wolff, while construction on ''Majestic'' commenced the following September. Construction on the two liners progressed in roughly six-month intervals, with the Teutonic being launched in January 1889 and sailing on her maiden voyage to New York the following August; while ''Majestic'' was launched in June 1889 and entered service in April 1890.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 45, 51.</ref> Prior to her entry into service, ''Teutonic'' made a rather noteworthy appearance at the 1889 Naval Review at Spithead, which was also set to commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. Although due to scheduling commitments she could not take part in the actual review, she anchored briefly amidst a line of merchant ships awaiting review, complete with four guns mounted, during which time she was toured by the Prince of Wales and Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Kaiser, much impressed with what he saw in ''Teutonic'', is rumored to have mentioned to others in his party \"We must have one of these!\".<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". p. 46.</ref> They would be White Star's last speed record breakers, as both ships would capture the Blue Riband in the summer of 1891 within two weeks of each other. ''Majestic'' beat the westbound record first on 5 August 1891, arriving in New York in 5 days, 18 hours and 8 minutes after keeping an average speed of 20.1 knots. This record was beat by ''Teutonic'', which arrived in New York on 19 August and beat the previous record by 1 hour and 37 minutes, this time maintaining an average speed of 20.35 knots.<ref name=\"auto\"/>{{Circular reference|date=June 2018}}\n\nWith the introduction of ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'', White Star did away with some of their aging fleet to make room for the new ships. Prior to the completion of the two new ships, ''Baltic'' and ''Republic'' were both sold to the [[Holland America Line]] and respectively renamed ''Veendam'' and ''Maasdam'', after which they were put into service on the company's main Trans-Atlantic route between Rotterdam and New York. ''Veendam'' was lost at sea without loss of life after striking a submerged object in 1898, while ''Maasdam'' was again sold in 1902 to La Veloce Navigazione Italiana and renamed ''Citta di Napoli'', after which she was used as an emigrant ship for an additional eight years before being sold for scrap at Genoa in 1910.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 17, 19.</ref> In 1893, by which time ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' had established themselves on the North Atlantic run, White Star sold ''Celtic'' to the Danish [[Thingvalla Line]], who renamed her ''Amerika'' and attempted to use her for their own emigrant service from Copenhagen to New York. This, however, failed to prove profitable for the line and she was sold for scrap at Brest in 1898.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". p. 24.</ref>\n\n===''Cymric'' and the move from speed to comfort===\n\nBeginning in the late 1890s, White Star experienced an explosion of rapid growth and expansion of its services, highlighted by a dramatic shift in focus from building the fastest ships on the North Atlantic to building the most comfortable and luxurious. Their first step in this direction came in 1897 during the construction of a new ship, ''[[SS Cymric|Cymric]]''. Initially designed as an enlarged version of the livestock carrier ''[[SS Georgic (1895)|Georgic]]'', which had entered service in 1895, ''Cymric'' had been planned as a combination passenger and livestock carrier, and thus was not designed with engines necessary to qualify her for the express service maintained by ''Britannic'', ''Germanic'', ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic''. However, while she was under construction at Harland & Wolff, a decision was made to convert spaces aboard her designated for cattle into Third Class accommodations after it was deemed that carrying passengers and livestock aboard the same vessel would not likely prove a popular venture. Therefore, in addition to the accommodations planned for 258 First Class passengers, her designs were altered to include berthing for 1,160 Third Class passengers.<ref name=\"auto1\">De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". p. 65</ref>\n\nOverall, her modest layout and design placed her with a footing directly between that of the aged but well reputable ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic'' and that of the more modern ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic''. Measuring at just over 13,000 tons and with a length of 585 feet and a beam of 64 feet, she was to be the largest liner in the White Star fleet, for a time at least. Additionally, her more utilitarian appearance with a single funnel and four masts contrasted her against her four running mates considerably. Because of this design, she was considered the first of White Star's 'intermediate' liners. However, as a result of this partial transition from livestock carrier to passenger liner, ''Cymric'' came to attain several noteworthy advantages which White Star would employ on several other liners. While her passenger accommodations had been modified, the specifications of her machinery and engines were left in place. Like ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'', ''Cymric'' was fitted with twin screws, but was instead powered by quadruple expansion engines capable of achieving a modest speed of 15 knots commonly seen in cargo and livestock carriers of that time. The major difference was that because these engines were designed for more modest speeds, they were considerably smaller and required only seven boilers, leaving more space within the hull for passenger and crew accommodations.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. 'The Big Four of the White Star Line'. pp. 9\u201310.</ref> At the same time, this also meant she consumed much less coal than steamers designed with larger engines, making her more economical. ''Cymric'' was launched at Harland & Wolff in October 1897 and entered White Star's North Atlantic service in February 1898, and in time proved a popular and profitable addition to the fleet.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n[[File:Colorful Oceanic.jpg|thumb|''Oceanic'' of 1899, (17,272 GRT)]]\n\n===''Oceanic'' and the death of Thomas Ismay===\n\nIn the early months of 1897, while ''Cymric'' was still under construction at Harland & Wolff, it became clear to Thomas Ismay and other line officials that a new addition to the North Atlantic fleet was needed, as compared to the fleets of many of their competitors such as Cunard and North German Lloyd, White Star was lagging behind. By this point, the only remaining ship of the original 'Oceanic' class of liners was the ''Adriatic'', and in her old age of a full quarter century, her days on the North Atlantic were now numbered. ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic'' were not too far behind after more than twenty years service, and with the advancements seen in shipbuilding during the 1890s ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' had been eclipsed by several newer vessels, most recently North German Lloyd's ''Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse''. In response to this lagging, Ismay and his partners at Harland & Wolff set out to design two new liners for the North Atlantic run which would, in a fashion similar to how ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' had done, go down in shipbuilding history.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". p. 81.</ref>\n\nThe new steamers, which were intended to be named ''[[RMS Oceanic (1899)|Oceanic]]'' and ''Olympic'', were designed to be both the largest and most luxurious the world had ever seen. In March 1897, the first keel plates for ''Oceanic'' were laid at Harland & Wolff, but almost immediately problems arose. Because the shipbuilder had never constructed a vessel of this size, work on the ship was delayed until an overhead gantry crane could be built. Her launch on 14 January 1899 drew an immense crowd of spectators numbering more than 50,000, as the launch placed ''Oceanic'' in history as the last British Trans-Atlantic liner to be launched in the 19th century as well as the first to exceed the ''Great Eastern'' in length. In all, she measured in at 704 feet in length with a beam of 68 feet, and had a gross tonnage of 17,254, making her a full 42% larger than North German Lloyd's ''Kaiser Wilhelm Der Grosse''. Like ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'', ''Oceanic'' was designed with capabilities to be converted to an armed merchant cruiser in time of war if needed, specifications for which included her to be built with a double-plated hull and turrets on her upper decks which could be quickly mounted with guns.<ref name=\"auto2\">The Titanic Commutator: Vol II, Issue 23, Fall 1979: pp. 4\u20135.</ref> She was also built with triple expansion engines geared to twin screws capable of achieving a respectable, if not record breaking, service speed of 19 knots. Additionally, she had a considerably larger passenger capacity of just over 1,700, providing for 410 First Class, 300 Second Class and 1,000 Third Class.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n\n''Oceanic'' sailed on her maiden voyage from Liverpool on 6 September 1899, arriving in New York to much added fanfare on the morning of 13 September with 1,456 passengers aboard, many of whom were well satisfied with how the crossing had gone. Among those travelling aboard in First Class were Harland & Wolff's managing director, Lord Pirrie, and Thomas Andrews, who had designed ''Oceanic'' under Thomas Ismay's direction. At the time ''Oceanic'' made her departure from Liverpool a fireman's strike had been ensuing at the docks, which in turn meant she sailed with a boiler room crew consisting of fewer men than her specifications called for. Thus, during her maiden voyage her engines had been run and maintained an average speed of just under 19 knots. In an interview, Lord Pirrie had been asked why she hadn't broken any speed records. His reply was thus as follows: \"The only record she is built to beat is that for regular running. She is to swing back and forth across the Atlantic with the regularity of a pendulum.\"<ref>The Titanic Commutator: Vol II, Issue 23, Fall 1979: pp. 7, 9\u201310.</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, Thomas Ismay was unable to enjoy the fruits of his labor, much to the dismay of his family and his colleagues. Just a few weeks after ''Oceanic'' was launched, Thomas began complaining of pains in his chest, from whence his health steadily began to decline. In fact, his health began to deteriorate so rapidly that managers with White Star and Harland & Wolff both decided to cancel plans to construct the second ship which was to serve as running mate to ''Oceanic'', ''Olympic''. The name was shelved, only to be reused 12 years later. His health improved for a brief time, allowing him to visit ''Oceanic'' upon her completion in Belfast that July. During his visit, Belfast officials awarded him with a key to the city, citing his contributions to the local economy and to British merchant shipping. Unfortunately, in late August he took a turn for the worse and he underwent two operations to alleviate his ailment, both of which proved unsuccessful, and Thomas suffered a heart attack on 14 September. He lingered in worsening agony for another ten weeks until his death on 23 November 1899 at the age of 62. In the immediate aftermath, control of the company was passed to Thomas' son Bruce, who was named chairman of the line.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==='The Big Four'===\n{{main|Big Four (White Star Line)}}\n[[File:RMS Adriatic postcard.jpg|thumb|''Adriatic'' of 1907 (24,541 GRT), the largest of the ''Big Four'']]\nEven before ''Oceanic'' had been completed, White Star had already started making plans for a considerably larger addition to their fleet. In September 1898, before his health began failing, Thomas Ismay negotiated the terms for the orders for the last passenger liner he would ever order for the line he'd built. This time around, plans were essentially the same as they had been with ''Oceanic'', only taking considerable more steps in innovation. While staying with the trend in focusing more on comfort than speed as had been set with ''Cymric'' and ''Oceanic'', Ismay's plans called for a new passenger liner of dimensions the world had never seen, and her chosen name was to be ''[[RMS Celtic (1901)|Celtic]]'', a name taken and reused from the original ''Oceanic'' class. The initial designs for ''Celtic'' had her at 680 feet in length, a tad bit shorter than ''Oceanic'', but with a greater breadth of her predecessor at 75 feet. Additionally, while the ''Oceanic'' had set the record for length, ''Celtic'' would triumph in tonnage, weighing in at just over 20,000 tons.<ref>https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/SS_Celtic</ref>\n\n====Engines====\nOne interesting note about this new ship was in regards to her engines. Historian Mark Chirnside made a notable comparison between the machinery installed aboard ''Cymric'' and that placed in ''Oceanic''. Because ''Cymric'' had initially been designed as a livestock carrier, she was built with smaller engines capable of modest speeds which both consumed less coal and occupied less space within the hull. As a result, there was an astonishing difference which gave ''Cymric'' a considerable advantage over ''Oceanic''. Although ''Cymric'' was overall only about two-thirds the size of ''Oceanic'' in terms of gross tonnage (12,552 to 17,274), her net tonnage, a unit of measurement used to account for space aboard a ship usable for passengers and cargo was actually greater than what was seen in the larger vessel (8,123 net tons aboard ''Cymric'' compared to only 6,996 with the ''Oceanic''). According to Chirnside, builders and designers used this as a baseline for engine designs for ''Celtic''.<ref name=\"auto3\">Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". pp. 10\u201311, 13.</ref> She was to be equipped with quadruple expansion engines geared to twin screws capable of considerably modest speeds of just over 16 knots. Because she was geared to set lower service speeds, her coal consumption was far less at only 260 tons per day, which compared to the 400 tons per day needed to power ''Oceanic'' made her much more economical.<ref>Gardiner, Robin. \"The History of the White Star Line\". p. 121.</ref> At the same time, owing to her broad hull, she was designed with cargo holds capable of storing up to 18,500 tons of commercial cargo, a strategic placement in her design as that cargo was to serve as ballast, keeping her steady in even the roughest seas.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n====Capacities====\nAdditionally, ''Celtic'' was to be designed with far greater capacities for both passengers and cargo. Her plans called for accommodations for a staggering 2,859 passengers: 347 in First Class, 160 in Second Class, and a total of 2,352 in Third Class, the latter being largest capacity seen of any liner on the North Atlantic at the time. Passenger accommodations were spread across six decks, titled from top to bottom: Boat Deck (A Deck), Upper Promenade (B Deck), Promenade (C Deck), Saloon (D Deck), Upper (E Deck) and Lower (F Deck). First Class accommodations were located amidships on the uppermost four decks and included a lounge and smoke room on the Boat Deck, as well as a grand and spacious dining room on the Saloon Deck. Second Class accommodations were allocated to the starboard sides of the Saloon and Upper Decks. Like as seen aboard ''Teutonic'', ''Majestic'', and ''Oceanic'', Second Class passengers were provided with their own smoke room and library, housed within a separate deckhouse situated just aft of the main superstructure, directly beneath which on the Saloon Deck was located their dining room.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". pp. 13, 20</ref>\n\nWhat made ''Celtic'' rather exceptional for the time was her Third Class accommodations, which in addition to ample open deck space on the Promenade Deck, were located on the Saloon, Upper and Lower Decks at both the forward and aft ends of the vessel, with a vast majority being located aft. The pattern followed that as was seen on all White Star vessels on the North Atlantic, with single men berthed forward, and single women, married couples and families berthed aft. On the Saloon Deck, in addition to baths and lavatories both forward and aft, were located two large dining rooms at the far after end of the deck, situated side by side, which when meals weren't being served respectively functioned as smoke and general rooms. An additional, fairly larger dining room was located directly beneath these on the Upper Deck, while a fourth dining room was located forward where single men were to be berthed, for which this dining room was equipped with a service bar. Aside from this, the biggest change brought by the ''Celtic'' for Third Class passengers was in sleeping quarters. In these days, open berths were still fairly common on the North Atlantic, which White Star had from the start gradually shied away from. Aboard the ''Oceanic'' class liners, ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic'', steerage passengers had been provided with large rooms which generally slept around 20 people, while aboard ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' the usage of two and four berth cabins had been introduced, but only for married couples and families with children, a policy which also held with ''Cymric'' and ''Oceanic''. ''Celtic'' broke that mould. At the forward end of the vessel, located in two compartments on the Lower Deck were accommodations of the older style of sleeping arrangements, each compartment providing for 300 single men. The remaining 1,752 berths were located aft, all of which consisted of two, four and six berth cabins.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". pp. 13, 20.</ref>\n\n====Construction====\nOn 22 March 1899, just two months after ''Oceanic'' was launched, the first keel plates of the ''Celtic'' were laid at Harland & Wolff. Construction progressed on her rapidly, and as White Star had planned, the new fleet of liners would be constructed in overlapping succession, as in October 1900, while ''Celtic'''s hull was nearing completion, construction began on the second ship, ''[[RMS Cedric|Cedric]]''. When ''Celtic'' was launched in April 1901, there was much fanfare, as she was hailed the largest ship in the world in terms of tonnage, as well as being the first to exceed the tonnage of the infamous ''Great Eastern''. She took a mere four additional months for fitting out before sailing on her maiden voyage from Liverpool on 26 July of that year.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". pp. 10, 15\u201320.</ref> Upon her entry into service, one of her most attractive features was her seaworthiness, as on her maiden voyage it was noted how while at sea, she was \"as steady as the Rock of Gibraltar.\"<ref>\"The Titanic Commutator\", Volume VII, Issue II, Summer 1983. \"The Big Four of the White Star, Part 1\", p. 7</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, construction on ''Cedric'' had proceeded as planned and she was launched on 21 August 1902. Although she was of exactly the same dimensions as ''Celtic'' in length and width, she outweighed her twin by a mere 155 tons, making her now the largest ship in the world. Despite their similarities, the two had distinct differences. Aboard ''Cedric'', First Class accommodations included more private bathrooms as well as more suites consisting of interconnecting cabins provided with sitting rooms.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". p. 33</ref> In all, she had accommodations for 2,600 passengers, with a slightly increased number of First Class passengers at 350, her Second Class capacity was increased to 250, while Third Class was scaled back to approximately 2,000. ''Cedric'' entered service later that winter, departing Liverpool on her maiden voyage on 11 February 1903.<ref>\"The Titanic Commutator\", Volume VII, Issue II, Summer 1983. \"The Big Four of the White Star, Part 1\", p. 9</ref>\n\nThe keel of the third sister, ''[[RMS Baltic (1903)|Baltic]]'' had been laid down at Harland & Wolff in June 1902, while construction on ''Cedric'' was still underway. One notable instance in her construction was once her keel was fitted in place, White Star gave orders for her length to be extended by 28 feet. This change in plans required builders to cut her keel in two, move the after end backwards and install the new addition in between. Their reasons for this addition was likely to provide more spaces for passenger accommodations, which combined added up to 2,850 passengers Although ''Baltic'' was designed with the same layout for Third Class passengers as ''Cedric'', with a capacity of 2,000, her First and Second Class capacities were significantly greater. First Class was increased to a capacity for 425 passengers, while capacity for Second Class was extended to 450 passengers, almost twice that of ''Cedric'' and three times that of ''Celtic''. Simultaneously, the added length also increased her gross tonnage to 23,884, making her now the largest ship in the world. ''Baltic'' was launched on 12 November 1903, subsequently fitted out and delivered to White Star on 23 June 1904, and sailed on her maiden voyage on 29 June.<ref>\"The Titanic Commutator\", Volume VII, Issue II, Summer 1983. \"The Big Four of the White Star, Part 1\", pp. 13\u201315.</ref>\n\nWhile the first three members of the highly regarded quartet of liners were built and put into service with little problems, the fourth and final ship, ''[[RMS Adriatic (1906)|Adriatic]]'', experienced a considerable delay in her construction. Initially, her construction had commenced in November 1902 while ''Baltic'' was still being built, but a series of delays slowed her construction to a snail's pace as compared to that of her sisters. For example, the timeline of construction on ''Baltic'' between the laying of her keel and her launch was roughly 17 months. By the time ''Adriatic'' was finally launched in September 1906, she'd been under construction for almost 46 months, more than twice the time needed to construct her twin.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". p. 54</ref> In her design, her passenger accommodations followed the same trend as seen with ''Baltic'', with added focus on the upper two classes while still maintaining the high standard for Third Class. Her overall passenger capacity was also identical to that of ''Baltic'' at 2,850, but with differences in capacities for each class, with First Class increased to 450, Second Class increased to 500 and Third Class scaled back to 1,900. Unlike her sisters however, she was unable to attain the title of world's largest ship at the time of her completion, as her 24,451 gross tonnage was just barely outmatched by Hamburg Amerika's ''Kaiserin Auguste Victoria'', which measured at 24,581 tons and entered service four months prior to the launch of ''Adriatic''. She would, however, rank briefly as the largest British-built ship until Cunard's famous greyhound ''Lusitania'' came into service the following year.<ref>\"The Titanic Commutator\", Volume VII, Issue II, Summer 1983. \"The Big Four of the White Star, Part 1\", pp. 16\u201317.</ref> She sailed on her maiden voyage to New York on 8 May 1907, and not long afterwards gained a considerable reputation for her interiors, enough for the British tabloid ''The Bystander'' to dub her 'The Liner Luxurious'. One of her most notable innovations was that she was the first liner to have an onboard Turkish Bath and swimming pool.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". p. 61</ref>\n\n===Intermediate liners and rapid expansion, 1903\u201307===\n\nAs White Star gradually brought the 'Big Four' into service, they also attained several smaller 'intermediate' liners in preparation for a considerable expansion of their passenger services on the North Atlantic. In 1903 alone they came to obtain five new liners, beginning with ''Arabic''. Originally laid down as ''Minnewaska'' for the Atlantic Transport Line, she was transferred to White Star prior to completion and was launched under her new name on 18 December 1902. Similar in size and appearance to ''Cymric'' with a single funnel and four masts, she measured at 600 feet in length with a beam of 65 feet, weighing in at 15,801 gross tons with quadruple expansion engines geared to twin screws capable of a service speed of 16 knots. She was fitted with fairly modest accommodations for 1,400 passengers: 200 in First Class, 200 in Second Class and 1,000 in Third Class. She sailed on her maiden voyage out of Liverpool to New York on 26 June 1903.\n\nMeanwhile, as a result of the IMMCo. takeover under J. Pierpont Morgan, White Star obtained four newly completed liners in the last months of 1903, they being the ''Columbus'', ''Commonwealth'', ''New England'' and ''Mayflower''. These four liners had been owned and operated by the Dominion Line for their services between Liverpool and Boston as well as their Mediterranean cruising and emigrant route, which also connected to Boston. However, the Dominion Line was also absorbed into the IMM scheme and the four ships were transferred to White Star. In addition to the acquisition of these ships, White Star also acquired control of the routes as well. Upon their acquisition by White Star, the four liners were respectively renamed ''Republic'', ''Cretic'', ''Romanic'' and ''Canopic''. These four ships were greatly similar in appearance to the ''Cymric'' and ''Arabic'', all with a single funnel with two or four masts, with engines geared to twin screws capable of service speeds between 14 and 16 knots. They all also fell within the same range in terms of dimensions, with lengths between 550 and 582 feet, beams between 59 and 67 feet, and gross tonnage as follows, ''Republic'' at 15,378 tons, ''Cretic'' 13,518 tons, ''Romanic'' at 11,394 tons and ''Canopic'' at 12,097 tons. There was, however, considerable variances in passenger capacities. ''Republic'', which in time would come to obtain the nickname 'The Millionaire's Ship', had the largest capacity with accommodations for 2,400 passengers (200 First Class, 200 Second Class, 2,000 Third Class). The three remaining ships had considerably smaller capacities, with the ''Cretic'' designed with accommodations for 1,510 passengers (260 First Class, 250 Second Class, 1,000 Third Class), ''Romanic'' with accommodations for 1,200 passengers (200 First Class, 200 Second Class, 800 Third Class) and ''Canopic'' with accommodations for 1,277 passengers (275 First Class, 232 Second Class, 770 Third Class).<ref name=\"Kerbrech, Richard p. 113-118\">De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 113\u2013118.</ref>\n\nFollowing the conclusion of their service under Dominion in the late fall of 1903, the four liners were briefly withdrawn from service, their names redone, funnels repainted in White Star colors, and made ready for their new services. ''Romanic'' was the first to enter service under White Star, sailing for Boston on 19 November, followed by ''Cretic'' on 26 November. In order to balance the schedule between the Liverpool and Mediterranean services to Boston, ''Cymric'' was transferred to the Liverpool-Boston route, departing Liverpool for her first trip to Boston on 10 December, while ''Republic'' entered service to Boston on 17 December. ''Canopic'' completed the service upon her departure from Liverpool on 14 January 1904. Upon their arrivals in Boston, ''Romanic'' and ''Canopic'' were both immediately transferred to the Mediterranean services formerly upheld by the Dominion Line. This route followed a line which first made port at [[Sao Miguel Island|Sao Miguel]] in the [[Azores]] before passing through the straits of Gibraltar and making port in Naples and Genoa. ''Republic'' was also put into service on the Mediterranean route following her first crossing to Boston, but only for the first half of the 1904 season, as come summer she was switched back to the Liverpool-Boston service until winter, a pattern of divided seasons between  the North Atlantic and Mediterranean routes which she would follow for the remainder of her career. ''Cretic'' remained on the Liverpool-Boston service running opposite ''Cymric'' for a full year until November 1904, when alongside ''Republic'' she began sailing on a secondary service to the Mediterranean from New York.<ref name=\"Kerbrech, Richard p. 113-118\"/>\n\n[[File:Canute Chambers.jpg|thumb|upright|Canute Chambers, former White Star Line offices in Southampton]]\nIn the early months of 1907, White Star began preparations for another extension of their services on the North Atlantic by establishing an 'Express' service to New York. The new service would terminate out of Southampton every Wednesday, first heading south across the English Channel to the French port of Cherbourg that evening, then sailing back across the channel to Queenstown the following morning before proceeding to New York. On eastbound crossings, ships would forego calling at Queenstown and make port at Plymouth, before proceeding to Cherbourg and Southampton. Because of its proximity to London, Southampton had a clear advantage over Liverpool in reducing travelling time, while by establishing a terminal at Cherbourg White Star had established a route which allowed travelers to embark or disembark at either a British or Continental port.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". p. 66</ref> Another subsidiary of IMM, the [[American Line]], had moved their operations to Southampton in 1893 and established an express service via Cherbourg which had proved very successful, thus prompting White Star to make a similar move.<ref>Flayhart, William H. \"The American Line: 1871\u20131902\". p. 139.</ref> ''Celtic'' embarked on two experimental crossings from Southampton to New York via Cherbourg and Queenstown, first on 20 April and then again on 18 May, which proved successful and set the way for the establishment of the route, which was to be maintained by ''Teutonic'', ''Majestic'', ''Oceanic'' and the newly completed ''Adriatic''. ''Celtic'' was returned to the Liverpool service after the second crossing, and her place taken on the new run by ''Adriatic'', which sailed from Southampton for the first time on 5 June, followed by ''Teutonic'' on 12 June, ''Oceanic'' on 19 June and ''Majestic'' on 26 June.\n\n=== Olympic class ships ===\n{{Main|Olympic-class ocean liner}}\n[[File:RMS Titanic 1.jpg|thumb|''Titanic'' of 1912 (46,328 GRT)]]\nThe Cunard Line was the chief competitor to White Star. In response to Cunard's [[RMS Lusitania|''Lusitania'']] and [[RMS Mauretania (1906)|''Mauretania'']], White Star ordered the ''Olympic'' class liners: [[RMS Olympic|''Olympic'']], [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] and [[HMHS Britannic|''Britannic'']]. While Cunard was famed for the speed of their ships, the ''Olympic'' class were to be the largest and most luxurious ships in the world. ''Olympic'', however, was the only ship of this class to have a successful career. ''Titanic'' sank on her maiden voyage in April 1912, while ''Britannic'' was requisitioned by the British government while she was still being fitted out, and was used as a [[hospital ship]] during [[World War I]]. ''Britannic'' hit an underwater mine in the Kea Channel and sank on the morning of 21 November 1916.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/britannic-sinks-in-aegean-sea|title=Britannic sinks in Aegean Sea \u2013 Nov 21, 1916 |website=History.com|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===First World War===\nLike many other shipping lines, the White Star Line suffered heavy losses during the [[First World War]] which began in August 1914, including some of their most prestigious vessels. The first major war loss was of [[RMS Oceanic (1899)|RMS ''Oceanic'']] of 1899, which was converted into an [[armed merchant cruiser]] and ran aground near the [[Shetland Islands]] due to navigational error in September 1914. The first White Star ship lost to enemy action was the liner [[SS Arabic (1902)|''Arabic'']] which was torpedoed off the Irish coast in August 1915 with the loss of 44 lives.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\">{{cite book|last1=Kerbrech|first1=Richard De|title=Ships of the White Star Line|date=2009|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|pages=181\u2013183|ISBN=978 0 7110 3366 5}}</ref>\n\n1916 would see the largest loss of the war, Titanic's sister ship [[HMHS Britannic|''Britannic'']] which was sunk near the Greek island of [[Kea (island)|Kea]] in May after striking a [[naval mine]], while in service as a [[hospital ship]]. ''Britannic'' was the largest loss for the company, and also the [[List of the largest ships hit by U-boats in World War I|largest ship sunk]] during the conflict. 1916 also saw the loss of the liner [[SS Cymric|''Cymric'']] which was torpedoed off the Irish coast in May, and also of the cargo ship [[SS Georgic (1895)|''Georgic'']], which was scuttled in December with its cargo of 1,200 horses still on board, after being intercepted in the Atlantic by the German [[merchant raider]] {{SMS|M\u00f6we|1914|6}}.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\"/>\n\n1917 saw the loss of the liner [[SS Laurentic (1908)|''Laurentic'']] in January which struck a mine off the Irish coast and sank with the loss of 354 lives and 3,211 gold ingots. The following month the liner [[SS Afric|''Afric'']] was sunk by a torpedo in the English Channel, as was the liner [[SS Delphic (1897)|''Delphic'']] in August.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\"/>\n\nMany White Star vessels were requisitioned for various types of war service, most commonly for use as [[troop ship]]s, the most notable of these was the [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']] which transported over 200,000 troops during the conflict.<ref>Chirnside, Mark (2011).

In 1922 the White Star Line obtained two former German liners which had been ceded to Britain as [[World War I reparations|war reparations]] under the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], ostensibly as replacements for the war losses of ''Britannic'', ''Oceanic'', ''Arabic'', ''Cymric'' and ''Laurentic''.: The former ''SS Bismarck'' which was renamed [[RMS Majestic (1914)|''Majestic'']], and the former ''SS Columbus'' which was renamed [[RMS Homeric (1913)|''Homeric'']]. At 56,551 gross tons,  ''Majestic'' was then the world's largest liner and became the company's flagship. The two former German liners operated successfully alongside ''Olympic'' for an express service on the Southampton\u2013New York route until the [[Great Depression]] reduced demand after 1930.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\"/>\n\nIn the immediate post-war period there was a boom in the transatlantic emigrant trade, from which White Star was able to benefit for a time, however this trade was badly affected by the American [[Immigration Act of 1924]] which introduced quotas for immigrants to the United States. This hit the profits of the shipping lines, for whom the emigrant trade had been a staple for nearly a century. However the growth in [[tourism]] was to some degree able to offset the decline of the emigrant trade, and White Star made efforts to appeal to this new breed of traveller by gradually overhauling liners still in service and re-configuring Third Class accommodations as Tourist Class.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\"/>\n\nIn 1927 the White Star Line was purchased by the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]] (RMSPC), making RMSPC the largest shipping group in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plimsoll.org/OnTheLine/ShippingLines/royalmail/default.asp#2 |title=Fact file \u2013 PortCities Southampton |website=Plimsoll.org |date= |accessdate=17 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.users.on.net/~snicol/story/index3.html |title=The Royal Mail Story: The Kylsant years |website=Users.on.net |accessdate=17 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208010107/http://www.users.on.net/~snicol/story/index3.html |archive-date=8 December 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1928 a new [[Oceanic (unfinished ship)|Oceanic (III)]] was proposed and her keel was laid down that year at Harland and Wolff. The thousand foot long liner was to have been a [[motor ship]] propelled by the new diesel-electric propulsion system, but the ship was never completed due to financial issues. ''Oceanic'''s keel was dismantled and the steel was used in two new smaller motor ships: [[MV Britannic (1929)|''Britannic'' (III)]] and [[MV Georgic (1932)|''Georgic'' (II)]]. Both of these ships entered service by 1932; they were the last liners White Star had built.\n\nRMSPC ran into financial trouble, and was liquidated in 1932. A new company, Royal Mail Lines Limited, took over the ships of RMSPC and their subordinate lines including White Star.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.users.on.net/~snicol/story/index4.html |title=The Royal Mail Story: Royal Mail Lines, Ltd |website=Users.on.net |accessdate=17 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316083323/http://www.users.on.net/~snicol/story/index4.html |archive-date=16 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Georgic postcard.jpg|thumb|[[MV Georgic (1932)|MV ''Georgic'']]; the last ship to be built for the White Star Line before the merger.]]\n\n=== Cunard merger ===\n[[File:Cunard White Star Line Logo.JPG|thumbpx|thumbnail|left|''Cunard-White Star'' Logo]]\nIn 1933 White Star and Cunard were both in serious financial difficulties because of the [[Great Depression]], falling passenger numbers and the advanced age of their fleets. Work was halted on Cunard's new giant, Hull 534 (later the [[RMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']]) in 1931 to save money. In 1933 the British government agreed to provide assistance to the two competitors on the condition that they merge their North Atlantic operations. The agreement was completed on 30 December 1933.\n\nThe merger took place on 10 May 1934, creating [[Cunard-White Star Limited]]. White Star contributed ten ships to the new company while Cunard contributed 15 ships. Because of this, and since Hull 534 was Cunard's ship, 62% of the company was owned by Cunard's shareholders and 38% of the company was owned for the benefit of White Star's creditors. White Star's Australia and New Zealand services were not involved in the merger, but were separately disposed of to Shaw, Savill & Albion later in 1934. A year after this merger, [[RMS Olympic|''Olympic'']], the last of her class, was removed from service. She was scrapped in 1937.\n\nIn 1947 Cunard acquired the 38% of Cunard White Star they did not already own, and on 31 December 1949 they acquired Cunard-White Star's assets and operations, and reverted to using the name \"Cunard\" on 1 January 1950. From the time of the 1934 merger, the house flags of both lines had been flown on all their ships, with each ship flying the flag of its original owner above the other, but from 1950, even [[MV Georgic (1931)|''Georgic'']]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chriscunard.com/history-fleet/cunard-white-star/fleet-details/georgic/ |title=Georgic |work=Chris' Cunard Page |date= |accessdate=17 February 2010 }}</ref> and [[MV Britannic (1929)|''Britannic'']],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chriscunard.com/history-fleet/cunard-white-star/fleet-details/britannic/ |title=Britannic |work=Chris' Cunard Page |date= |accessdate=17 February 2010}}</ref> the last surviving White Star liners, flew the Cunard house flag above the White Star burgee until they were each withdrawn from service, in 1956 and 1961 respectively.

However, in the late 1890s White Star decided to reinstate a service to Australia, partly because of the discovery of further gold deposits in [[Western Australia]] leading to another series of gold rushes and an increased traffic in emigrants to Australia, while there was also an increasing trade in minerals, agricultural produce, wool and meat in the other direction. The latter had become a major source of revenue for shipping lines already on the route after the advent of effective mechanical [[refrigeration]] systems in the late 1880s, allowing large quantities of cattle carcasses to be preserved on the long voyage back to the [[British Isles]].\n\nThomas Ismay decided to re-enter the Australian run in 1897 with a monthly service between [[Liverpool]], [[Cape Town]] and [[Sydney]]. A stop at [[Tenerife]] was included in the schedule both outbound and inbound. Outbound ships would call at [[Adelaide]] and [[Melbourne]] and the return trip would call at [[Plymouth]] before ending at Liverpool. With that route taking six weeks, five ships would be needed to maintain the service in both directions. The specification for the new ships was drawn up and the order placed with Harland & Wolff in the summer of 1897, coinciding with the [[Queen Victoria#Diamond Jubilee|Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria]], thus they became known as the [[Jubilee-class ocean liner]]s.<ref name=\"Kerbrech\">{{cite book|last1=Kerbrech|first1=Richard De|title=Ships of the White Star Line|date=2009|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|pages=78\u201389|ISBN=978 0 7110 3366 5}}</ref> In keeping with White Star's new philosophy on the Atlantic of size over speed, the Jubilee-class were to be the largest ships ever put on the Australia run, at 550&nbsp;ft (168 metres) in length and nearly 12,000 gross tons. They were single-funnel, twin-screw ships designed as mixed cargo/passenger vessels, being in essence enlarged versions of White Star's [[SS Naronic|Naronic-class]] ships.<ref name=\"Haws\">{{cite book |last1=Haws |first1=Duncan |title=White Star Line (Oceanic Steam Navigation Company) |date=1990 |isbn=0 946378 16 9 |pages=50\u201354}}</ref> With a service speed of 14 knots the Jubilee-class were significantly slower than the smaller mailships run by the [[Orient Line]] and [[P&O (company)|P&O]]. Their size meant they could not transit the [[Suez Canal]] and would have to take the long route via South Africa so would not attract first-class passengers. Instead they were intended for the emigrant/seasonal worker traffic, carrying 320 passengers solely in what was described as third-class accommodation. However, following White Star's long tradition of improving standards for third-class passengers, these facilities were considerably ahead of the equivalent on other lines, being broadly in line with second-class facilities on other ships. Although all of the same class, prices for berths on the Jubilee-class varied, allowing passengers the choice of two- or four-berth cabins for a premium or open dormitories. Passengers had use of facilities such as a large dining room, a library and a smoking room, as well as free run of nearly all the ship's deck space during the voyage. The ships could carry 15,000 tons of cargo in seven holds, including capacity for 100,000 meat carcasses.<ref name=\"NQR\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81645587 |title=A Mammoth Steamship.

The final pair of ships for the Australia run were to a modified design following the experiences with the original trio. The Australia Run proved to be more popular with passengers than expected so these two ships, [[SS Runic (1900)|''Runic'']] and [[SS Suevic|''Suevic'']] had their bridges moved forward and their poop decks extended.<ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/><ref name=\"Haws\"/> As well as slightly increasing their gross tonnage this gave them capacity for a further 50 passengers, bringing the total to 400. ''Suevic'' made her maiden voyage in May 1901, bringing White Star's new Australian service to full strength. By now the return voyage also included a stop at [[London]] \u2013 most passengers from Australia disembarked at Plymouth, to go to their final destination by railway, while much of the cargo was bound for London. The ship would then steam back through the [[English Channel]] to offload the last of her cargo and passengers at Liverpool before preparing for the next voyage. \n[[File:PERSIC_on_left_and_CERAMIC_on_right,_both_of_the_White_Star_Line._(3307507923).jpg|thumb|''Persic'' (left) and ''Ceramic'' (right) loading at [[Sydney]] in the 1920s.]]\nThe Australian Run was successful and profitable for White Star, and largely uneventful for the ships. In the earliest days of the route the initial three ships were heavily used to transport men, soldiers and supplies to South Africa during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], while ''Suevic'' [[SS Suevic#Shipwreck|ran aground]] off [[Lizard Point, Cornwall]] in dramatic fashion in 1907, but there were no casualties and, despite the ship being broken in two, she was repaired and reentered service in January 1908.<ref name=\"Haws\"/> The success of the new Australian service in terms of freight led to White Star transferring an older cargo-only ship of a similar size to the Jubilee-class, the [[SS Cevic (1893)|''Cevic'']], from the New York service to the Australia Run. In 1910 ''Cevic'' was used to experiment with routing ships to Australia via the [[Suez Canal]] but she ran aground several times in the canal and the ships remained on the route via the Cape. ''Cevic'' was used on the Australia Run on a seasonale basis, mainly carrying cattle and wool at the end of the Australian autumn (February\u2013April) and then being switched to the New York Run during the Atlantic summer.\n\nContinued demand for extra passenger capacity led to White Star building a one-off ship for the route. Launched in 1913, [[SS Ceramic|''Ceramic'']] was a larger, more sophisticated development of the Jubilee-class, at 655 feet (200 metres) in length and 18,495 gross tons. Like the [[SS Laurentic (1908)|''Laurentic'']] and the [[Olympic-class ocean liner|Olympic-class]], ''Ceramic'' was a triple-screw ship with the central propeller driven by a low-pressure turbine using exhaust from the two recriprocating steam engines. This enabled her to be slightly faster \u2013 16 knots \u2013 than the Jubilee-class vessels despite her extra size for a minimal increase in coal consumption. The new ship had a significantly larger superstructure and nearly double the passenger capacity of the Jubilee-class ships \u2013 a total of 600 passengers, still carried only in what was advertised as third-class accommodation. She could also carry 19,000 tons cargo in eight holds, including 321,000 cubic feet of refrigerated space.<ref name=\"Hardy\">{{cite book|last1=Hardy|first1=Clare|title=SS Ceramic, The Untold Story|date=2006|pages=19\u201320|ISBN=1 904908 64 0}}</ref> The dimensions of ''Ceramic'' were restricted by the length of the quay at London's [[Port of Tilbury]] and the clearance for the masts under the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]]. When she arrived in Sydney in September 1914 she took the place of the Jubilee-class ships as the largest vessels put on the Australia Run from Britain and became the tallest ship to pass under the bridge.<ref name=\"Hardy\"/>\n\nAll seven ships were requisitioned as troop transports during the [[World War I]], forcing White Star to suspend the regular Australia service. ''Afric'' was torpedoed by a [[U-Boat]] in the English Channel in 1917 and ''Cevic'' remained in the ownership of the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] after the war but the other five ships were returned to White Star and the service was resumed in 1919. The remaining Jubilee-class liners were withdrawn from White Star service in the late 1920s. ''Persic'' was scrapped in 1926 while the other three were sold in 1928 (''Medic'' and ''Suevic'') and 1929 (''Runic''). All were converted into whaling [[factory ship]]s on account of their size and cargo capacity. The Australia Run was no longer so lucrative or as heavily-trafficked as it had been before the war and the route was no longer a priority for White Star, especially once it came under the ownership of the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]] in 1927. A new ship, intended to be the first of a new class to replace the Jubilee-class, had been launched in 1917 - the [[SS Vedic|''Vedic'']]. This was the first White Star Line ship to be powered solely by [[steam turbine|turbines]] and had the same emigrant/cargo-carrying role as her predecessors, although at 460 feet (140 metres) and 9,332 gross tons she was smaller than the older ships. ''Vedic'' went straight from the builders to service as a troopship and was initially used on White Star's Canadian service until she was put on the Australia Run in 1925. Between them ''Ceramic'' and ''Vedic'' maintained a less-intensive Australian service until their owners merged with the [[Cunard Line]]. The new management immediately decided to end White Star's routes to the southern hemisphere \u2013 ''Ceramic'' was sold to [[Shaw, Savill & Albion Line]], which continued to operate her on the same route, while ''Vedic'' was scrapped.\n\n== White Star Line today ==\n\n[[File:SS Nomadic March 2012.jpg|thumb|Last surviving White Star ship, [[SS Nomadic (1911)|SS ''Nomadic'']], as she appeared in 2012, drydocked in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland]]\n\nThe White Star Line's Head Offices still exist in Liverpool, standing in James Street within sight of the more grandiose headquarters of their rivals, the Cunard Building.

Wreckage found included deck spars and at least two lifeboats, but no trace of her crew. Her wreck has never been found.\n*In 1907 {{SS|Suevic||2}} ran aground off the southwest coast of England, but in the largest rescue of its kind, all 597 persons (456 passengers + 141 crew) were rescued. The ship was later deliberately severed in two with explosives, with the stern half being rebuilt with a new bow.\n*In 1909 the {{RMS|Republic|1903|2}} foundered off the New England coast after a collision with the Italian liner {{SS|Florida||2}}. Four lives were lost in the collision and the ship remained afloat for over 39 hours before foundering. The remaining passengers were rescued.\n*In September 1911 {{RMS|Olympic||2}} was involved in a collision with the warship [[HMS Hawke (1891)|HMS ''Hawke'']] in the [[Solent]], badly damaging both ships.\n*In February 1912, ''Olympic'' lost a propeller blade on an eastbound voyage from New York after apparently striking an unknown object floating just below the surface.\n*On 14\u201315 April 1912 {{RMS|Titanic||2}} was [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|lost]] after colliding with an iceberg, taking upwards of 1,500 passengers and crew with her.\n*The first White Star ship lost during World War I was ''[[Arabic Case|Arabic]]'', torpedoed off the [[Old Head of Kinsale]] Ireland on 19 August 1915 killing 44.\n*In 1915 the {{SS|Ionic (1902)||2}} was narrowly missed by a German torpedo in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. No lives were lost.\n*On 28 June 1915 the {{SS|Armenian||2}}, a vessel built for the [[Leyland Line]] but leased to the White Star Line, was sunk by a torpedo fired by {{SMU|U-24}} 20 miles off the coast of Cornwall, carrying a cargo of 1,400 mules. 29 crew and all the mules were lost.\n*On 3 May 1915 the former {{SS|Germanic|1875|2}} (then in service as a Turkish troop transport) was torpedoed by the British submarine {{HMS|E14}}. The ship survived the attack with no fatalities.\n*In May 1916 {{SS|Ceramic|1913|2}} was narrowly missed by two torpedoes from unidentified U-boat in [[Mediterranean Sea]].\n*In 1916 the {{SS|Cymric||2}} was torpedoed three times and sunk off the southern coast of Ireland by {{SMU|U-20|Germany|2}}, noted as the same submarine responsible for the tragic sinking of the ''Lusitania'' the year before. Five lives were lost and the ship stayed afloat for almost three days before foundering.\n*On 21 November 1916, the second sister ship of ''Titanic'', {{HMHS|Britannic}}, was lost after striking a mine laid by {{SMU|U-73||2}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/6696.html|title=Hospital ship Britannic \u2013 Ships hit by U-boats \u2013 German and Austrian U-boats of World War One \u2013 Kaiserliche Marine|work=uboat.net}}</ref> in the [[Kea Channel]] of the Aegean Sea off the coast of Greece.

However, several bow plates on ''Olympic'' were dented from the collision with the U-boat. Later, while ''Olympic'' was in Dry Dock, a large circular-shaped dent was found in the side of her hull, appearing to be the same size as the head of the standard torpedoes used by the German U-Boats.\n*On 19\u201320 July 1918 {{SS|Justicia||2}} (owned by the British Government and managed by White Star) was torpedoed twice by {{SMU|U-46||2}} but she remained afloat. Later in the same day, she was torpedoed two more times by {{SMU|U-46||2}} and again managed to stay afloat. The next morning, as she was towed by HMS ''Sonia'', she was torpedoed two more times by {{SMU|U-124|2}} and finally sank, killing 16 crew members.\n*In September 1918 {{SS|Persic||2}} was torpedoed by {{SMU|U-87||2}} off of the [[Isles of Scilly]], but was able to limp off and outrun the sub. She was towed in and repaired, resuming service.\n*In October 1917 {{RMS|Celtic}} ran up on a mine laid by {{SMU|U-88||2}} near Cobh, Ireland, killing 17. She was repaired and put back into military service. In June 1918, she was torpedoed by {{SMU|UB-77||2}} in the Irish Sea, killing seven. Once again, she was able to escape the sub and limp into port with her own steam. She was repaired and once again put back into service, serving through the remainder of the war without incident.\n* On 3 October 1932 {{SS|Laurentic|1927|2}} collided with ''Lurigethen'' of the HE Moss Line. Both vessels remained afloat following the collision.\n* On 15 May 1934, while steaming in a fog, ''Olympic'' rammed the ''[[United States lightship LV-117|Lightship Nantucket]]'', sinking it and killing seven of the crew.\n* On 18 August 1935 {{SS|Laurentic|1927|2}} collided with ''Napier Star'' of the [[Blue Star Line]], leaving six dead among the crew of ''Laurentic''.\n*In November 1940 {{SS|Laurentic|1927|2}} was torpedoed and sunk by {{GS|U-99|1940|2}} off Northern Ireland with the loss of 49 lives.\n\n== Notable captains ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2010}}\n* [[Commodore (rank)#Merchant and boating rank|Commodore]] Sir [[Bertram Fox Hayes]] [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]] [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] [[Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve|RD]] [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNR]] \u2013 Commodore, White Star Line\n* Captain [[Sir Digby Murray|Digby Murray]], Commodore, best known as captain of ''Republic'' and ''Atlantic''.<ref>{{Citation | last = Love | first = Bob | title = Destiny's Voyage: SS Atlantic, the Titanic of 1873| place = | publisher = AuthorHouse | year = 2006 | chapter = Sixth Day | pages = 256\u2013257 | language = English | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3OKolR-9dtoC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false | isbn = 1425930395}}</ref>\n* Captain [[J.
