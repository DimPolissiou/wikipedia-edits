{"title_page": "Celebrity culture", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2010}}\n{{original research|date=September 2007}}\n}}\n\n'''Celebrity culture''' is a high-volume perpetuation of [[celebrities]]' personal lives on a global scale. It is inherently tied to consumer interests where celebrities transform their fame to become [[product brand]]s.\n\nWhereas a culture can usually be physically identified, and its group characteristics easily observed, celebrity culture exists solely as a collection of individuals' desires for increased celebrity viewing. Celebrities themselves do not form a cohesive and identifiable group with which they identify themselves. Celebrities are found across a spectrum of activities and communities including acting, politics, fashion, sports and music. The \"culture\" is created when it is common knowledge within a society that people are interested in celebrities and are willing to alter their own lives to take part in celebrities' lives. The \"culture\" is first defined by factors outside of celebrities themselves, and then augmented by celebrities' involvement within that publicly constructed culture. Celebrity culture has become a part of everyday society and functions as a form of entertainment.<ref name=\"tandfonline.com\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/19392390903519057|title = The promotion and presentation of the self: Celebrity as marker of presentational media| journal=Celebrity Studies| volume=1| pages=35\u201348|year = 2010|last1 = Marshall|first1 = P. David|doi-access=free}}</ref> Today, everyday citizens play an important role in the perpetuation of celebrity culture by constantly checking the whereabouts of celebrities, the trends within celebrity culture, and the general lives of celebrity via media.<ref name=\"tandfonline.com\"/> Celebrity culture is now reflected in social norms and values because of the extreme citizen involvement.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=3sKwWqBQpbUC&pg=PR1&dq=celebrity+culture+in+social+media#v=snippet&q=celebrity%20culture&f=false | title=Framing Celebrity: New Directions in Celebrity Culture| isbn=9780415377096| last1=Holmes| first1=Su| last2=Redmond| first2=Sean| year=2006}}</ref> Today, as it is now used as entertainment, celebrity culture is viewed as a form of \"[[escapism]]\" from reality and a means of preoccupation for everyday people.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jo-piazza/americans-unhealthy-obsession-with-celebrities_b_1385405.html | title=Americans Have an Unhealthy Obsession with Celebrities| date=2012-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==Promotion from celebrities==\nThere have been multiple phases in the popularity of celebrity culture. The earliest examples would include the broadcasting of [[television programs]] where human beings could reach wider audiences and individuals could be given rise to fame. As different technologies were released, the manipulation of audiences changed, and the reaches of celebrity culture has greatly expanded. Entrepreneurial individuals began to recognize the financial value in purposefully promoting certain individuals, and thus a consumer approach to celebrities as brands emerged. A culture began to take shape as consumers accepted celebrities as a part of society. This acceptance along with shrewd marketing perpetuates celebrity culture with its constantly shifting customs and beliefs. Celebrity culture can be viewed as synonymous with celebrity industry, where celebrities are treated as products to be sold. Celebrity culture differs from consumer culture in that celebrity culture is a single aspect of consumer culture. Celebrity culture could not exist without consumer culture, as people are consistently buying magazines, apps for celebrities, and other celebrity-related merchandise. Consumers' choices are thus influenced by celebrities' choices. By following celebrities, consumers are invited to take part in the collective society created by the existence of celebrity culture, unknowingly perpetuated by the consumers themselves. Participants of the celebrity culture phenomenon also include the celebrities themselves, being aware they can brand themselves and achieve financial gains through their own fame and status, apart from the foundation of their celebrity pre-branding.\n\n\"To people who have grown tired of self-government, the belief in kings and queens and fairy tales seems easier and more comfortable than the practice of politics,\" wrote Lewis Lapham in his book, ''The Wish For Kings''. This notion is the basis for the naturally occurring relationship between \"regular\" men and women, and those on a pedestal.\n\nThe famous religious books of the world's [[faith]]s are replete with examples of individuals who are well known by the general public. Some of the [[pharaohs]] of ancient [[Egypt]] set in motion devices to ensure their own fame for centuries to come.\n\nCelebrity culture, once restricted to royalty and biblical/mythical figures, has pervaded many sectors of society including business, publishing, and even academia (the [[scilebrities]]). With every scientific advance names have become attached to discoveries. Especially for large contributions to humanity, the contributor is usually regarded honourably. [[Mass media]] has increased the exposure and power of celebrity. A trend has developed that celebrity carries with it increasingly more [[social capital]] than in earlier times. Each nation or cultural community (linguistic, ethnic, religious) has its own independent celebrity system, but this is becoming less the case due to [[globalization]] (see [[J-pop]] or [[K-pop]]).\n\n== Perpetuation of celebrity culture ==\nAccording to Oliver Dreissens, celebrity\u2019s social and cultural prominence can be traced back to the success of the [[mass media]].<ref>Driessens, Olivier. \u201cThe Celebritization of Society and Culture: Understanding the Structural Dynamics of Celebrity Culture.\u201d International Journal of Cultural Studies, vol. 16, no. 6, 2013, pp. 641\u2013657., doi:10.1177/1367877912459140.

The first way is celebrity politicians, which crosses an elected office of government with celebritization. The second way is with political activism, a newly popular method which avoids directly participating in government itself.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Street|first=John|date=2004-2011|title=Celebrity Politicians: Popular Culture and Political Representation|journal=The British Journal of Politics and International Relations|language=en-US|volume=6|issue=4|pages=435\u2013452|doi=10.1111/j.1467-856x.2004.00149.x|issn=1369-1481}}</ref>\n\n=== Celebrity politicians ===\nCelebrity politicians can be divided into two categories: celebrities that go over to government and hold an elected office and politicians that become celebrities.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[List of actor-politicians|Celebrities that have held a government office]] are not uncommon. Donald Trump is an example of one. A businessman and real estate dealer who has licensed his name to properties and other brands, Trump gained national fame when he starred in the television show ''The Apprentice'' in 2004, and again during the 2012 presidential election by implying that then presidential candidate Barack Obama was not a natural born United States citizen. He then successfully ran for the United States presidency in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Donald-Trump|title=Donald Trump {{!}} Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> Ronald Reagan is another example. He was a career actor that appeared in 53 films over two decades. He first became governor of California in 1966, and then became president of the United States in 1980.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/ronald-reagan/|title=Ronald Reagan|website=The White House|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref>\n\nPoliticians have also become celebrities themselves, either naturally or by copying celebrity traits. The Democratic group \"The Squad\" is an example. Consisting of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Talib, they are four Democrat representatives that first formed after the 2018 midterm elections, when Ocasio-Cortez posted a picture of the four seated together on Instagram, playing off of the colloquial term 'squad goals.'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/23/squad-congress-how-aoc-omar-tlaib-and-pressley-got-name/1804557001/|title=Why are they called the 'Squad'?

This is a result of the large platform given to celebrities;{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} as Jane Johnson, a reporter for the popular British celebrity publication [[Closer (magazine)|Closer]] observed, the gossip surrounding celebrities is a nationally unifying factor among all social groups.<ref name=\":2\" /> This unification and large platform provided by celebrities has been a point of interest for political leaders and groups to gain farther reach within various campaigns. Young adults have had historically lower [[voter turnout]] than any other voting age group. Knowing this, politicians and public figures draw from the cultural resources curated by celebrities by mimicking the popular, accessible public persona given off by today's celebrities.<ref name=\":2\" /> As noted by author [[Frank Furedi]], \u201cPoliticians self consciously attempt to either acquire a celebrity image or to associate themselves with individuals who possess this status\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> This can be seen with [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Justin Trudeau]] who has become somewhat of a celebrity because of the perception of being personable and supporting progressive, liberal policies. Another example of this was  [[Katy Perry]] campaigning and performing for [[Hillary Clinton]] during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 Presidential election]].\n\n=== Celebrities and political issues ===\nCelebrities have used their actions to highlight political issues. Jane Fonda has tried to promote awareness of climate change through being arrested for civil disobedience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/jane-fondas-climate-change-star-power|title=The Star Power of Jane Fonda's Climate-Change Arrests|last=Demick|first=Barbara|website=The New Yorker|language=en|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> With the rise of social media, celebrities have been able to express their opinions on controversial topics to get immediate feedback from their fans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/28/think-celebrities-get-punished-being-political-fact-they-get-retweeted/|title=Analysis {{!}} Think celebrities get punished for being political?

Michael Jordan allegedly said, \"Republicans buy sneakers, too.\" when turning down a politician looking for an endorsement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/4424493/michael-jordan-statement-history/|title=The Tragic History Behind Michael Jordan's Statement on Police Shootings|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref>\n\n==Today==\nCelebrity status is widely sought by many people. Celebrities are often displeased by their status. [[Paparazzi]] are a problem for celebrities. Another problem is [[celebrity marriage]]. There is research{{Clarify|date=October 2011}} that suggests child celebrities have poor emotional health in adulthood, and often turn to drug abuse. Celebrity status is ranked by an \"A-list\" or \"B-list\" hierarchy. Sometimes people who achieved celebrity status come to regret it, e.g. [[Bart Spring in 't Veld]], who came to loathe the [[reality TV]] celebrity culture which ''[[Big Brother 1999 (Netherlands)|Big Brother]]'', of which he was the first winner in the world, instigated.\n\n===Celebrity gossip===\nCelebrity gossip has become an integral part of American culture, acting as not only a form of entertainment, but a form of social involvement and social order.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/19392390903519057|title = The promotion and presentation of the self: Celebrity as marker of presentational media| journal=Celebrity Studies| volume=1| pages=35\u201348|year = 2010|last1 = Marshall|first1 = P. David|doi-access=free}}</ref> Gossip allows people to connect and interact with one another, providing a sense of community within society. Through gossip, people are able to affirm their values and ideas by hearing about celebrity struggle via tabloids and other forms of media. The information given to people to consume and discuss allows for civic engagement on a global scale as there is material to talk about with others that is generally known through gossip.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Vehicles===\nIn the US, celebrity culture is created and disseminated by television talk shows such as ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', where actors and music stars promote their latest films and albums, and by many celebrity magazines such as ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', ''[[Us Weekly|Us]]'', and ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]''. Another phenomenon is the arrival and rise of \"micro-celebrities\" through the [[WWW]] ([[internet celebrity|internet celebrities]]).\n\n==Social media==\nCelebrity culture is a constantly changing topic that grows as technology does. Different platforms are being implemented: Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook, all of which provide a new outlet for celebrities to express their thoughts. Twitter is constantly changing celebrity views and provides an unmonitored space for opinions to be shared. It provides a platform for celebrities to re-share ideas and safely share theirs. It also allows for people to comment, making it engaging to fans and followers. Instagram is also growing and continues to be a popular outlet for celebrities, as it provides an outlet for purely pictures. Many of these pictures also include other people who are famous, boosting their image and reaching to different fan bases. Lastly, Facebook is still a common used platform that many celebrities use, especially older demographics. Many older generation prefer Facebook because it is easy to navigate and people can share and write posts that are of importance to them.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Celebrity Culture and Public Connection|journal = International Journal of Cultural Studies|volume = 10|issue = 4|pages = 403\u2013421|last=Couldry|first=Nick|doi=10.1177/1367877907083077|year = 2007|url = http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/4813/1/4813.pdf}}</ref>\n \n===Twitter===\n[[Twitter]] allowed higher frequency of interaction with people, thus increasing intimacy and the perception of culture. Twitter users could now directly interact with celebrities with the expectation of a public response.\n\n===Instagram===\nThrough [[Instagram]]'s unique format another layer of celebrity culture was added, allowing celebrities to further their intimacy with followers by sharing selected photos and videos with their audience. With each additional platform a celebrity uses to promote themselves, a wider view is created thus enhancing the perception of culture. Instagram also recently changed the layout to try to help celebrities become more noticed.They use an algorithm that determines what pictures are at the top of a person's feed and what pictures are at the bottom and are harder to find.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/421169/most-followers-instagram/|title=Statista Instagram Facts}}</ref> Trends of celebrities found on Instagram have a massive cultural impact as the platform allows for people to see and imitate a celebrities via clothing, speech, or humor allowing them to indirectly engage with celebrity culture.<ref name=\"tandfonline.com\"/> Today, Instagram can be used as a platform for marketing as celebrities can be paid huge sums of money for product placement or usage in their posts.<ref>{{cite book|title=Framing celebrity : new directions in celebrity culture|last1=Homes, Redmond|first1=Su, Sean|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415377102|location=London, England|pages=[https://archive.org/details/framingcelebrity0000unse/page/369 369]|hdl=10536/DRO/DU:30032850|url=https://archive.org/details/framingcelebrity0000unse/page/369}}</ref>\n\n===YouTube===\nRecently, [[YouTube]] has also become a large part of the growth of social media. On this site, there are YouTube influencers that have become to be a new group of celebrities. These influencers may post videos about their daily life in vlogs, beauty, playing videogames, and many other genres. They have become so popular in recent years because viewers see them as more relatable than movie stars or other groups of celebrities. Since they are exposed to very personal videos, fans are able to from a strong bond with these influencers.\n\n==Tantrums==\nSome celebrities are known for \"throwing tantrums\" to get their way. They are also known for getting in debates with their friends, who are also celebrities, in order to amp up the drama and let their names be seen. When an individual is in the public eye, it changes how they act and their behavior. Usually it encourages people to act in extremes, whether that be extremely good or extremely bad. Most of the time, publicity only goes to celebrities who are going against the social norm, and doing something different. People are more interested in reading about something crazy a celebrity did, rather than them going out and having a respectful lunch.\n\n==Complaints==\nA common complaint of modern celebrity culture is that the public, instead of seeking virtues or talents in celebrities, seek those who are the most willing to break ethical boundaries, or those who are most aggressive in self-promotion. In other words, [[infamy]] has replaced fame. The social role of the [[town drunk]], the [[court jester]], or the sexually indiscreet are not new, but arguably, the glorification of these individuals is. Society selects celebrities that provide the most entertainment and news stories as the most notorious.\n\n===Explanations===\nOne possible explanation of this trend is that an artificial importance has been created in order to promote a product or a service, rather than to record a purely biographical event. As more new products are launched in a world market that is constantly expanding, the need for more celebrities has become an [[industry]] in itself.\n\nAnother explanation, used by [[Chuck Palahniuk]], is that this exaggeration of modern celebrity culture is created out of a need for drama and spectacle. In the book ''[[Haunted (Palahniuk novel)|Haunted]]'', he describes the pattern of creating a celebrity as a god-like figure, and once this image is created, the desire to destroy it and shame the individual in the most extreme ways possible. [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|Tabloid]] magazines are the prototype example of this theory.\n\n==Posthumous fame==\nSome creators such as poets, artists, musicians, and inventors are little-known and little-appreciated during their lives but are feted as brilliant innovators after their deaths. In some cases, after historians uncover a creator's role in the development of some type of cultural or technical process, the contributions of these little-known individuals become more widely known. A desire to achieve this type of posthumous fame may have motivated [[Alan Abel]], [[Adam Rich]] and [[Pauly Shore Is Dead|Pauly Shore]] to stage their own deaths.\n\nSometimes a false death mention can cause a person to rethink their legacy. [[Alfred Nobel]] founded the [[Nobel Prize]]s after an erroneous obituary labelled him a \"merchant of death\" due to his invention and selling of [[dynamite]].\n\nPeople who were far more famous after their deaths than during their lifetime (and often were completely or relatively unknown) include Greek philosopher [[Socrates]]; scientist [[Galileo Galilei]]; 1800s-era poet [[John Keats]]; painter [[Posthumous fame of Vincent van Gogh|Vincent van Gogh]]; poet and novelist [[Edgar Allan Poe]]; singer [[Eva Cassidy]]; comedian [[Bill Hicks]]; writer [[Emily Dickinson]]; artist [[Edith Holden]], whose 1906 diary was a best-seller when published posthumously in 1977; writer [[Franz Kafka]]; singer [[Jeff Buckley]]; diarist [[Anne Frank]]; philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]]; writer [[John Kennedy Toole]] (who posthumously won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] 12 years after his death); author [[Stieg Larsson]] (who died with his ''[[Millennium series|Millennium]]'' novels unpublished); musician, artist and poet [[Rozz Williams]]; and [[William Webb Ellis]], the alleged inventor of [[Rugby football]].\n\n[[Herostratus]], a young Greek man [[arson]]ed the [[Temple of Artemis]] (one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]) in 356 BC in order to immortalize his name. Although authorities at the time tried to expunge him from history and punished people with the [[death penalty]] for even merely mentioning his name, he succeeded in achieving lasting fame, as his name is well known to this day.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Celebrity]]\n*[[Superstar]]\n*[[Popularity]]\n*[[Fifteen minutes of fame]]\n*[[Hollywood marriage]]s\n*[[Scientific celebrity]]\n*[[Starsuckers]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite book|author=Gamson, Joshua|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OWNLM_1u-r8C|title=Claims to Fame: Celebrity in Contemporary America|publisher=Berkeley: University of California Press|year=1999|isbn= 9780520914155}}\n*Schickel, Richard.

It is inherently tied to consumer interests where celebrities transform their fame to become [[product brand]]s.\n\nWhereas a culture can usually be physically identified, and its group characteristics easily observed, celebrity culture exists solely as a collection of individuals' desires for increased celebrity viewing. Celebrities themselves do not form a cohesive and identifiable group with which they identify themselves. Celebrities are found across a spectrum of activities and communities including acting, politics, fashion, sports and music. The \"culture\" is created when it is common knowledge within a society that people are interested in celebrities and are willing to alter their own lives to take part in celebrities' lives. The \"culture\" is first defined by factors outside of celebrities themselves, and then augmented by celebrities' involvement within that publicly constructed culture. Celebrity culture has become a part of everyday society and functions as a form of entertainment.<ref name=\"tandfonline.com\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/19392390903519057|title = The promotion and presentation of the self: Celebrity as marker of presentational media| journal=Celebrity Studies| volume=1| pages=35\u201348|year = 2010|last1 = Marshall|first1 = P.

The earliest examples would include the broadcasting of [[television programs]] where human beings could reach wider audiences and individuals could be given rise to fame. As different technologies were released, the manipulation of audiences changed, and the reaches of celebrity culture has greatly expanded. Entrepreneurial individuals began to recognize the financial value in purposefully promoting certain individuals, and thus a consumer approach to celebrities as brands emerged. A culture began to take shape as consumers accepted celebrities as a part of society. This acceptance along with shrewd marketing perpetuates celebrity culture with its constantly shifting customs and beliefs. Celebrity culture can be viewed as synonymous with celebrity industry, where celebrities are treated as products to be sold. Celebrity culture differs from consumer culture in that celebrity culture is a single aspect of consumer culture. Celebrity culture could not exist without consumer culture, as people are consistently buying magazines, apps for celebrities, and other celebrity-related merchandise. Consumers' choices are thus influenced by celebrities' choices. By following celebrities, consumers are invited to take part in the collective society created by the existence of celebrity culture, unknowingly perpetuated by the consumers themselves. Participants of the celebrity culture phenomenon also include the celebrities themselves, being aware they can brand themselves and achieve financial gains through their own fame and status, apart from the foundation of their celebrity pre-branding.\n\n\"To people who have grown tired of self-government, the belief in kings and queens and fairy tales seems easier and more comfortable than the practice of politics,\" wrote Lewis Lapham in his book, ''The Wish For Kings''. This notion is the basis for the naturally occurring relationship between \"regular\" men and women, and those on a pedestal.\n\nThe famous religious books of the world's [[faith]]s are replete with examples of individuals who are well known by the general public. Some of the [[pharaohs]] of ancient [[Egypt]] set in motion devices to ensure their own fame for centuries to come.\n\nCelebrity culture, once restricted to royalty and biblical/mythical figures, has pervaded many sectors of society including business, publishing, and even academia (the [[scilebrities]]). With every scientific advance names have become attached to discoveries. Especially for large contributions to humanity, the contributor is usually regarded honourably. [[Mass media]] has increased the exposure and power of celebrity. A trend has developed that celebrity carries with it increasingly more [[social capital]] than in earlier times. Each nation or cultural community (linguistic, ethnic, religious) has its own independent celebrity system, but this is becoming less the case due to [[globalization]] (see [[J-pop]] or [[K-pop]]).\n\n== Perpetuation of celebrity culture ==\nAccording to Oliver Dreissens, celebrity\u2019s social and cultural prominence can be traced back to the success of the [[mass media]].<ref>Driessens, Olivier. \u201cThe Celebritization of Society and Culture: Understanding the Structural Dynamics of Celebrity Culture.\u201d International Journal of Cultural Studies, vol. 16, no. 6, 2013, pp. 641\u2013657., doi:10.1177/1367877912459140.

The first way is celebrity politicians, which crosses an elected office of government with celebritization. The second way is with political activism, a newly popular method which avoids directly participating in government itself.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Street|first=John|date=2004-2011|title=Celebrity Politicians: Popular Culture and Political Representation|journal=The British Journal of Politics and International Relations|language=en-US|volume=6|issue=4|pages=435\u2013452|doi=10.1111/j.1467-856x.2004.00149.x|issn=1369-1481}}</ref>\n\n=== Celebrity politicians ===\nCelebrity politicians can be divided into two categories: celebrities that go over to government and hold an elected office and politicians that become celebrities.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[List of actor-politicians|Celebrities that have held a government office]] are not uncommon. Donald Trump is an example of one. A businessman and real estate dealer who has licensed his name to properties and other brands, Trump gained national fame when he starred in the television show ''The Apprentice'' in 2004, and again during the 2012 presidential election by implying that then presidential candidate Barack Obama was not a natural born United States citizen. He then successfully ran for the United States presidency in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Donald-Trump|title=Donald Trump {{!}} Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> Ronald Reagan is another example. He was a career actor that appeared in 53 films over two decades. He first became governor of California in 1966, and then became president of the United States in 1980.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/ronald-reagan/|title=Ronald Reagan|website=The White House|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref>\n\nPoliticians have also become celebrities themselves, either naturally or by copying celebrity traits. The Democratic group \"The Squad\" is an example. Consisting of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Talib, they are four Democrat representatives that first formed after the 2018 midterm elections, when Ocasio-Cortez posted a picture of the four seated together on Instagram, playing off of the colloquial term 'squad goals.'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/23/squad-congress-how-aoc-omar-tlaib-and-pressley-got-name/1804557001/|title=Why are they called the 'Squad'?

This is a result of the large platform given to celebrities;{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} as Jane Johnson, a reporter for the popular British celebrity publication [[Closer (magazine)|Closer]] observed, the gossip surrounding celebrities is a nationally unifying factor among all social groups.<ref name=\":2\" /> This unification and large platform provided by celebrities has been a point of interest for political leaders and groups to gain farther reach within various campaigns. Young adults have had historically lower [[voter turnout]] than any other voting age group. Knowing this, politicians and public figures draw from the cultural resources curated by celebrities by mimicking the popular, accessible public persona given off by today's celebrities.<ref name=\":2\" /> As noted by author [[Frank Furedi]], \u201cPoliticians self consciously attempt to either acquire a celebrity image or to associate themselves with individuals who possess this status\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> This can be seen with [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Justin Trudeau]] who has become somewhat of a celebrity because of the perception of being personable and supporting progressive, liberal policies. Another example of this was  [[Katy Perry]] campaigning and performing for [[Hillary Clinton]] during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 Presidential election]].\n\n=== Celebrities and political issues ===\nCelebrities have used their actions to highlight political issues. Jane Fonda has tried to promote awareness of climate change through being arrested for civil disobedience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/jane-fondas-climate-change-star-power|title=The Star Power of Jane Fonda's Climate-Change Arrests|last=Demick|first=Barbara|website=The New Yorker|language=en|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> With the rise of social media, celebrities have been able to express their opinions on controversial topics to get immediate feedback from their fans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/28/think-celebrities-get-punished-being-political-fact-they-get-retweeted/|title=Analysis {{!}} Think celebrities get punished for being political?

Michael Jordan allegedly said, \"Republicans buy sneakers, too.\" when turning down a politician looking for an endorsement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/4424493/michael-jordan-statement-history/|title=The Tragic History Behind Michael Jordan's Statement on Police Shootings|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref>\n\n==Today==\nCelebrity status is widely sought by many people. Celebrities are often displeased by their status. [[Paparazzi]] are a problem for celebrities. Another problem is [[celebrity marriage]]. There is research{{Clarify|date=October 2011}} that suggests child celebrities have poor emotional health in adulthood, and often turn to drug abuse. Celebrity status is ranked by an \"A-list\" or \"B-list\" hierarchy. Sometimes people who achieved celebrity status come to regret it, e.g. [[Bart Spring in 't Veld]], who came to loathe the [[reality TV]] celebrity culture which ''[[Big Brother 1999 (Netherlands)|Big Brother]]'', of which he was the first winner in the world, instigated.\n\n===Celebrity gossip===\nCelebrity gossip has become an integral part of American culture, acting as not only a form of entertainment, but a form of social involvement and social order.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/19392390903519057|title = The promotion and presentation of the self: Celebrity as marker of presentational media| journal=Celebrity Studies| volume=1| pages=35\u201348|year = 2010|last1 = Marshall|first1 = P. David|doi-access=free}}</ref> Gossip allows people to connect and interact with one another, providing a sense of community within society. Through gossip, people are able to affirm their values and ideas by hearing about celebrity struggle via tabloids and other forms of media. The information given to people to consume and discuss allows for civic engagement on a global scale as there is material to talk about with others that is generally known through gossip.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Vehicles===\nIn the USA, celebrity culture is created and disseminated by television talk shows such as ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', where actors and music stars promote their latest films and albums, and by many celebrity magazines such as ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', ''[[Us Weekly|Us]]'', and ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]''. Another phenomenon is the arrival and rise of \"micro-celebrities\" through the [[WWW]] ([[internet celebrity|internet celebrities]]).\n\n==Social media==\nCelebrity culture is a constantly changing topic that grows as technology does. Different platforms are being implemented: Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook, all of which provide a new outlet for celebrities to express their thoughts. Twitter is constantly changing celebrity views and provides an unmonitored space for opinions to be shared. It provides a platform for celebrities to re-share ideas and safely share theirs. It also allows for people to comment, making it engaging to fans and followers. Instagram is also growing and continues to be a popular outlet for celebrities, as it provides an outlet for purely pictures. Many of these pictures also include other people who are famous, boosting their image and reaching to different fan bases. Lastly, Facebook is still a common used platform that many celebrities use, especially older demographics. Many older generation prefer Facebook because it is easy to navigate and people can share and write posts that are of importance to them.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Celebrity Culture and Public Connection|journal = International Journal of Cultural Studies|volume = 10|issue = 4|pages = 403\u2013421|last=Couldry|first=Nick|doi=10.1177/1367877907083077|year = 2007|url = http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/4813/1/4813.pdf}}</ref>\n \n===Twitter===\n[[Twitter]] allowed higher frequency of interaction with people, thus increasing intimacy and the perception of culture.

[[Alfred Nobel]] founded the [[Nobel Prize]]s after an erroneous obituary labelled him a \"merchant of death\" due to his invention and selling of [[dynamite]].\n\nPeople who were far more famous after their deaths than during their lifetime (and often were completely or relatively unknown) include Greek philosopher [[Socrates]]; scientist [[Galileo Galilei]]; 1800s-era poet [[John Keats]]; painter [[Posthumous fame of Vincent van Gogh|Vincent van Gogh]]; poet and novelist [[Edgar Allan Poe]]; singer [[Eva Cassidy]]; comedian [[Bill Hicks]]; writer [[Emily Dickinson]]; artist [[Edith Holden]], whose 1906 diary was a best-seller when published posthumously in 1977; writer [[Franz Kafka]]; singer [[Jeff Buckley]]; diarist [[Anne Frank]]; philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]]; writer [[John Kennedy Toole]] (who posthumously won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] 12 years after his death); author [[Stieg Larsson]] (who died with his ''[[Millennium series|Millennium]]'' novels unpublished); musician, artist and poet [[Rozz Williams]]; and [[William Webb Ellis]], the alleged inventor of [[Rugby football]].\n\n[[Herostratus]], a young Greek man [[arson]]ed the [[Temple of Artemis]] (one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]) in 356 BC in order to immortalize his name. Although authorities at the time tried to expunge him from history and punished people with the [[death penalty]] for even merely mentioning his name, he succeeded in achieving lasting fame, as his name is well known to this day.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Celebrity]]\n*[[Superstar]]\n*[[Popularity]]\n*[[Fifteen minutes of fame]]\n*[[Hollywood marriage]]s\n*[[Scientific celebrity]]\n*[[Starsuckers]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite book|author=Gamson, Joshua|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OWNLM_1u-r8C|title=Claims to Fame: Celebrity in Contemporary America|publisher=Berkeley: University of California Press|year=1999|isbn= 9780520914155}}\n*Schickel, Richard.

The joint incursion, in addition to the Qatari counter-attack, prompted British Political Resident, Colonel [[Lewis Pelly]] to impose a settlement in 1868. His mission to Bahrain and Qatar and the resulting peace treaty were milestones because they implicitly recognised the distinctness of Qatar from Bahrain and explicitly acknowledged the position of Mohammed bin Thani. In addition to censuring Bahrain for its breach of agreement, the British [[protectorate]] asked to negotiate with a representative from Qatar, a role which Mohammed bin Thani was selected to fulfil. The negotiations were the first stage in the development of Qatar as a sheikhdom.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilkinson |first1=John Craven |title=Arabia's Frontiers: The Story of Britin's Boundary Drawing in the Desert |date=1991 |isbn=IB Tauris |pages=46-47 |accessdate=24 April 2020}}</ref> However, Qatar was not officially recognised as a British protectorate until 1916.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rahman |first1=Habibur |title=The Emergence of Qatar: The Turbulent Years 1627-1916 |date=2005 |publisher=Routledge |page=235 |accessdate=24 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===The Ottoman period (1871\u20131915)===\n[[File:Qatar in Stielers Handatlas 1891 59.JPG|thumb|Qatar in an 1891 [[Adolf Stieler]] map]]\n[[File:Olddoha2-771x410.jpg|thumb|left|Old city of Doha, January 1904.]]\nUnder military and political pressure from the governor of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Vilayet of Baghdad]], [[Midhat Pasha]], the ruling [[House of Thani|Al Thani]] tribe submitted to Ottoman rule in 1871.<ref name=\"Rogan1199\">{{cite journal |last1 = Rogan|first1 = Eugene|date = November 1999|title = Review of The Ottoman Gulf: The Creation of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Qatar by Frederick F.

Qatari-Ottoman relations, however, soon stagnated, and in 1882 they suffered further setbacks when the Ottomans refused to aid Al Thani in his expedition of [[Abu Dhabi]]-occupied [[Khawr al Udayd]].

Fearing that he would face death or imprisonment, Jassim retreated to Al Wajbah ({{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=on|order=flip|disp=or}} west of [[Doha]]), accompanied by several tribe members. Mehmed's demand that Jassim disbands his troops and pledge his loyalty to the Ottomans was met with refusal. In March, Mehmed imprisoned Jassim's brother and 13 prominent Qatari tribal leaders on the Ottoman [[corvette]] ''Merrikh'' as punishment for his insubordination. After Mehmed declined an offer to release the captives for a fee of 10,000 [[Turkish lira|liras]], he ordered a column of approximately 200 troops to advance towards Jassim's [[Al Wajbah Fort]] under the command of Yusuf Effendi, thus signalling the start of the [[Battle of Al Wajbah]].<ref name=\"fromherz\"/>\n\nEffendi's troops came under heavy gunfire by a sizable troop of Qatari infantry and cavalry shortly after arriving at Al Wajbah. They retreated to Shebaka fortress, where they were again forced to draw back from a Qatari incursion. After they withdrew to Al Bidda fortress, Jassim's advancing column besieged the fortress, resulting in the Ottomans' concession of defeat and agreement to relinquish their captives in return for the safe passage of Mehmed Pasha's cavalry to [[Hofuf]] by land.<ref>Habibur Rahman, p. 152</ref> Although Qatar did not gain full independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]], the result of the battle forced a treaty that would later form the basis of Qatar's emerging as an autonomous country within the empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qatarvisitor.com/index.php?cID=439&pID=1701 |title=Battle of Al Wajbah |publisher=Qatar Visitor |date=2 June 2007 |accessdate=22 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117024415/http://www.qatarvisitor.com/index.php?cID=439&pID=1701 |archivedate=17 January 2013  }}</ref>\n\n===British period (1916\u20131971)===\n[[File:Al Zubarah (6989829695).jpg|thumb|left|[[Zubarah Fort]] built in 1938.]]\nBy the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, the Ottomans agreed to renounce their claim to Qatar and withdraw their garrison from Doha.

OPEC quotas on crude oil production, the [[1980s oil glut|lower price for oil]], and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings. In turn, the Qatari government's spending plans had to be cut to match lower income. The resulting recessionary local business climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff. With the economy recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from [[Egypt]] and South Asia, have grown again.\n\n[[File:Qatar Export Treemap.png|thumb|Graphical depiction of Qatar's product exports in 28 color-coded categories (2011).]]\nOil production will not remain at the peak level of 500,000 barrels (80,000 m\u00b3) per day for long as the national oil fields are projected to be largely depleted by 2023. Large natural gas reserves have, however, been located off Qatar's northeast coast. Qatar's proved reserves of gas are the third-largest in the world, exceeding 250 trillion cubic feet (7,000&nbsp;km\u00b3). The economy was boosted in 1991 by completion of the $1.5-billion Phase I of North Field gas development. In 1996, the Qatargas project began exporting [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) to Japan. Further phases of North Field gas development costing billions of dollars are in various stages of planning and development.\n\nQatar's heavy industrial projects, all based in [[Umm Said]], include a refinery with a 50,000 barrels (8,000 m\u00b3) per day capacity, a fertiliser plant for urea and ammonia, a steel plant, and a petrochemical plant. All these industries use gas for fuel. Most are joint ventures between European and Japanese firms and the state-owned [[Qatar Petroleum|Qatar General Petroleum Corporation]] (QGPC). The US is the major equipment supplier for Qatar's oil and gas industry, and US companies are playing a major role in North Field gas development.<ref name=\"bdlive.co.za\" />\n\nQatar's [[Qatar National Vision 2030|National Vision 2030]] has made investment in renewable resources a major goal for the country over the next two decades.<ref name=\"Qatar National Vision 2030\" /> Qatar pursues a vigorous programme of \"[[Qatarization|Qatarisation]]\", under which all joint venture industries and government departments strive to move Qatari nationals into positions of greater authority. Growing numbers of foreign-educated Qataris, including many educated in the US, are returning home to assume key positions formerly occupied by expatriates. To control the influx of expatriate workers, Qatar has tightened the administration of its foreign manpower programmes over the past several years. Security is the principal basis for Qatar's strict entry and immigration rules and regulations.<ref name=\"bdlive.co.za\" />\n\nQatar may suffer significant geopolitical losses if there is a global transition to renewable energy; it is ranked 152 out of 156 countries in the index of Geopolitical Gains and Losses after energy transition (GeGaLo).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Overland|first=Indra|last2=Bazilian|first2=Morgan|last3=Ilimbek Uulu|first3=Talgat|last4=Vakulchuk|first4=Roman|last5=Westphal|first5=Kirsten|date=2019|title=The GeGaLo index: Geopolitical gains and losses after energy transition|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211467X19300999|journal=Energy Strategy Reviews|language=en|volume=26|pages=100406|doi=10.1016/j.esr.2019.100406|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n{{Main|Transport in Qatar}}\n[[File:Hamad International Airport Doha Qatar 6.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hamad International Airport]]]]\nWith a fast-expanding population and substantial economic growth over the past decade, a reliable and extensive transportation network is becoming increasingly necessary within Qatar. So far the government, the primary transport developer, has done well in terms of keeping up with demand for new transportation options. In 2008 the [[Ashghal|Public Works Authority]] (Ashghal), one of the bodies that oversees infrastructure development, underwent a major reorganisation in order to streamline and modernise the authority in preparation for major project expansions across all segments in the near future. Ashghal works in tandem with the Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA), the body that designed the transportation master plan, instituted in March 2006 and running to 2025.\n\nAs driving is the primary mode of transport in Qatar, the road network is a major focus of the plan. Project highlights in this segment include the multibillion-dollar Doha Expressway and the [[Qatar Bahrain Causeway]], which will connect Qatar to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and is considered a milestone in regional interconnectivity.\n\n[[File:QTR A7-APA A380!137 EDHI 16-04-14.jpg|thumb|[[Qatar Airways]] [[Airbus A380]], Qatar Airways, one of the world's largest airlines, links over 150 international destinations from its base in [[Doha]].]]\nMass-transit options, such as a [[Doha metro]], light-rail system and more extensive bus networks, are also under development to ease road congestion.

In March, Mehmed imprisoned Jassim's brother and 13 prominent Qatari tribal leaders on the Ottoman [[corvette]] ''Merrikh'' as punishment for his insubordination. After Mehmed declined an offer to release the captives for a fee of 10,000 [[Turkish lira|liras]], he ordered a column of approximately 200 troops to advance towards Jassim's [[Al Wajbah Fort]] under the command of Yusuf Effendi, thus signalling the start of the [[Battle of Al Wajbah]].<ref name=\"fromherz\"/>\n\nEffendi's troops came under heavy gunfire by a sizable troop of Qatari infantry and cavalry shortly after arriving at Al Wajbah.

Additionally, the country has seen job cuts in 2016 from its petroleum companies and other sectors in the government.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dohanews.co/taxes-on-junk-food-luxury-items-to-be-rolled-out-in-qatar-soon/|title=Taxes on junk food, luxury items to be rolled out in Qatar soon|date=16 February 2017|accessdate=5 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://dohanews.co/tag/layoffs/|title=layoffs Archives \u2013 Doha News|website=Doha News|accessdate=5 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Energy===\n{{main|Energy in Qatar}}\n[[File:ORYX GTL Plant - Qatar.jpg|thumb|Oryx [[Gas to liquids|GTL]] plant in Qatar]]\n{{As of|2012}}, Qatar has proven oil reserves of 15 billion barrels and gas fields that account for more than 13% of the global resource. As a result, it is the richest state per-capita in the world. None of its 2 million residents live below the poverty line and less than 1% are unemployed.<ref name=\"bdlive.co.za\">{{cite web|author=Simon Lincoln Reader |url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/opinion/columnists/2013/11/12/qatar-shows-how-money-can-solve-most-problems |title=Qatar shows how money can solve most problems |publisher=Bdlive.co.za |date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nQatar's economy was in a downturn from 1982 to 1989. OPEC quotas on crude oil production, the [[1980s oil glut|lower price for oil]], and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings. In turn, the Qatari government's spending plans had to be cut to match lower income. The resulting recessionary local business climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff. With the economy recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from [[Egypt]] and South Asia, have grown again.\n\n[[File:Qatar Export Treemap.png|thumb|Graphical depiction of Qatar's product exports in 28 color-coded categories (2011).]]\nOil production will not remain at the peak level of 500,000 barrels (80,000 m\u00b3) per day for long as the national oil fields are projected to be largely depleted by 2023. Large natural gas reserves have, however, been located off Qatar's northeast coast. Qatar's proved reserves of gas are the third-largest in the world, exceeding 250 trillion cubic feet (7,000&nbsp;km\u00b3). The economy was boosted in 1991 by completion of the $1.5-billion Phase I of North Field gas development. In 1996, the Qatargas project began exporting [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) to Japan. Further phases of North Field gas development costing billions of dollars are in various stages of planning and development.\n\nQatar's heavy industrial projects, all based in [[Umm Said]], include a refinery with a 50,000 barrels (8,000 m\u00b3) per day capacity, a fertiliser plant for urea and ammonia, a steel plant, and a petrochemical plant. All these industries use gas for fuel. Most are joint ventures between European and Japanese firms and the state-owned [[Qatar Petroleum|Qatar General Petroleum Corporation]] (QGPC). The US is the major equipment supplier for Qatar's oil and gas industry, and US companies are playing a major role in North Field gas development.<ref name=\"bdlive.co.za\" />\n\nQatar's [[Qatar National Vision 2030|National Vision 2030]] has made investment in renewable resources a major goal for the country over the next two decades.<ref name=\"Qatar National Vision 2030\" /> Qatar pursues a vigorous programme of \"[[Qatarization|Qatarisation]]\", under which all joint venture industries and government departments strive to move Qatari nationals into positions of greater authority. Growing numbers of foreign-educated Qataris, including many educated in the US, are returning home to assume key positions formerly occupied by expatriates. To control the influx of expatriate workers, Qatar has tightened the administration of its foreign manpower programmes over the past several years. Security is the principal basis for Qatar's strict entry and immigration rules and regulations.<ref name=\"bdlive.co.za\" />\n\nQatar may suffer significant geopolitical losses if there is a global transition to renewable energy; it is ranked 152 out of 156 countries in the index of Geopolitical Gains and Losses after energy transition (GeGaLo).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Overland|first=Indra|last2=Bazilian|first2=Morgan|last3=Ilimbek Uulu|first3=Talgat|last4=Vakulchuk|first4=Roman|last5=Westphal|first5=Kirsten|date=2019|title=The GeGaLo index: Geopolitical gains and losses after energy transition|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211467X19300999|journal=Energy Strategy Reviews|language=en|volume=26|pages=100406|doi=10.1016/j.esr.2019.100406|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n{{Main|Transport in Qatar}}\n[[File:Hamad International Airport Doha Qatar 6.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hamad International Airport]]]]\nWith a fast-expanding population and substantial economic growth over the past decade, a reliable and extensive transportation network is becoming increasingly necessary within Qatar. So far the government, the primary transport developer, has done well in terms of keeping up with demand for new transportation options. In 2008 the [[Ashghal|Public Works Authority]] (Ashghal), one of the bodies that oversees infrastructure development, underwent a major reorganisation in order to streamline and modernise the authority in preparation for major project expansions across all segments in the near future. Ashghal works in tandem with the Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA), the body that designed the transportation master plan, instituted in March 2006 and running to 2025.\n\nAs driving is the primary mode of transport in Qatar, the road network is a major focus of the plan. Project highlights in this segment include the multibillion-dollar Doha Expressway and the [[Qatar Bahrain Causeway]], which will connect Qatar to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and is considered a milestone in regional interconnectivity.\n\n[[File:QTR A7-APA A380!137 EDHI 16-04-14.jpg|thumb|[[Qatar Airways]] [[Airbus A380]], Qatar Airways, one of the world's largest airlines, links over 150 international destinations from its base in [[Doha]].]]\nMass-transit options, such as a [[Doha metro]], light-rail system and more extensive bus networks, are also under development to ease road congestion. In addition, the railway system is being significantly expanded and could eventually form an integral part of a GCC-wide network linking all the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. The airport, too, is expanding capacity to keep up with rising visitor numbers.\n\n[[Hamad International Airport]] is the [[international airport]] of [[Doha]].
