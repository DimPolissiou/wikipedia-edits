Although he died in 1928, he is considered the founder of the school. The school's first [[Head teacher|headmaster]] was an Englishman, [[Arthur Foot|Arthur E.

He was the fourth British headmaster in Doon's history and a member of [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], [[UK]].\n\nDoon houses roughly 500 pupils aged 13 to 18, and admission is based on a competitive entrance examination, a group discussion and an interview with the headmaster. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can opt for either [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum. Doon remains a boys-only school despite continued pressure from political leaders, including former [[President of India|President]] [[Pratibha Patil]], to become [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]]. [[Old boy network|Old boys]] of the school are known as 'Doscos'. \n\nDoon has been consistently ranked the best all-boys residential school in [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/17-schools-from-u---khand-secure-top-10-positions-in-ewisr.html|title=17 schools from U\u2019khand secure Top 10 positions in EWISR|first=The|last=Pioneer|website=The Pioneer}}</ref> Although the school has often been cited as 'Eton of India' by media outlets such as the [[BBC]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02c3zgq|title=BBC World Service - Witness, India's Eton|website=BBC}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news|author=STEVEN R.

He travelled widely in [[India]] with the goal of collecting {{Indian Rupee}}4&nbsp;million, but at the time of his death had raised only {{Indian Rupee}}1 million in cash and a further {{Indian Rupee}}1&nbsp;million in promises. With the money, Das formed the Indian Public Schools' Society (IPSS), which had the objective of founding new public schools in [[India]] that would admit students regardless of caste, creed or social status. Under the IPSS, a Board of Governors supervises all matters of Doon.<ref>Sanjay Srivastava, ''Constructing post-colonial India: national character and the Doon School (London: Routledge, 1998), p. 41: \"...the body founded by Das for the purposes of establishing the Doon School, the Indian Public Schools Society\"</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Das in 1928, the IPSS accomplished little, and by 1934 some of the original lenders had begun to inquire about the return of their money. To solve this problem, Sir Joseph Bhore, then Railway Minister of [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Lord Willingdon's]] Council, became IPSS chairman and, with [[Akbar Hydari|Sir Akbar Hydari]] as secretary, worked to obtain the former estate of the [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]] in [[Dehra Dun]] on favourable terms. Sir Frank Noyce also joined the team. [[E. F. L.

Although he died in 1928, he is considered the founder of the school. The school's first [[Head teacher|headmaster]] was an Englishman, [[Arthur Foot|Arthur E.

He was the fourth British headmaster in Doon's history and a member of [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], [[UK]].\n\nDoon houses roughly 500 pupils aged 13 to 18, and admission is based on a competitive entrance examination, a group discussion and an interview with the headmaster. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can opt for either [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]]. Doon remains a boys-only school despite continued pressure from political leaders, including former [[President of India|President]] [[Pratibha Patil]], to become [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]]. [[Old boy network|Old boys]] of the school are known as 'Doscos'. \n\nDoon has been consistently ranked the best all-boys residential school in [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/17-schools-from-u---khand-secure-top-10-positions-in-ewisr.html|title=17 schools from U\u2019khand secure Top 10 positions in EWISR|first=The|last=Pioneer|website=The Pioneer}}</ref> Although the school has often been cited as 'Eton of India' by media outlets such as the [[BBC]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02c3zgq|title=BBC World Service - Witness, India's Eton|website=BBC}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news|author=STEVEN R.

He travelled widely in [[India]] with the goal of collecting {{Indian Rupee}}4&nbsp;million, but at the time of his death had raised only {{Indian Rupee}}1 million in cash and a further {{Indian Rupee}}1&nbsp;million in promises. With the money, Das formed the Indian Public Schools' Society (IPSS), which had the objective of founding new public schools in [[India]] that would admit students regardless of caste, creed or social status. Under the IPSS, a Board of Governors supervises all matters of Doon.<ref>Sanjay Srivastava, ''Constructing post-colonial India: national character and the Doon School (London: Routledge, 1998), p. 41: \"...the body founded by Das for the purposes of establishing the Doon School, the Indian Public Schools Society\"</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Das in 1928, the IPSS accomplished little, and by 1934 some of the original lenders had begun to inquire about the return of their money. To solve this problem, Sir Joseph Bhore, then Railway Minister of [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Lord Willingdon's]] Council, became IPSS chairman and, with [[Akbar Hydari|Sir Akbar Hydari]] as secretary, worked to obtain the former estate of the [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]] in [[Dehra Dun]] on favourable terms.
